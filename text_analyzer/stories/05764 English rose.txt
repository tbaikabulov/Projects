The
English Rose

&nbsp;

1.

&nbsp;

Spencer Thomas was a balding man in
his late forties. He wore a golfing tie � white golf balls against a vivid
green field. He rotated the nearly empty pint glass in the slick of spilt beer
on the bar, making trails along the bar-top. It was three in the afternoon and
he really should be getting on the road again. He looked up at the fake
oak-stained beam over the bar and read the curious announcement over for the
third time - 

�The Black Bull
presents the St George�s
Day Prize Draw Extravaganza. An opportunity not to be missed
� an experience never to be forgotten. First prize: one English Rose. Runner up prizes including � a keg of Old Streaky Ale.
Limited to one hundred tickets � enter now while stocks last.�

Spencer muttered
to himself � �one English rose�. Then he shrugged and called over to the barman
� �well alright, if you twist my arm, one more then.�

����������� The
barman was sitting over the other end looking at the racing on the TV. There
was no one else in the place. There had been a rather tasty young blonde, cute
little thing of eighteen or so in tight jeans, clearing away the last lunchtime
table when he�d come in. But she�d disappeared back into the kitchen to be seen
no more. 

Rather grudgingly
the barman walked over to serve his sole customer. 

�Same again mate?�

�Same
again. Pint of Best.�

The traveller watched
the barman�s big red hands on the pump. Faded blue ink dots
on the knuckles, nine carat gold links around the left wrist. When the
pint was done, Spence took a big swallow. �Aaah.
That�s the job.�

The barman
grunted. �Just passing through, is it?�

�Just
passing through. That�s right. Not going far, mind. I�ll be stopping in town
for the night. I�ve got to be there at four
 o�clock for a meeting. The Travis conference centre. But I was
making good progress. You know how it is, when you�re
on the road it�s nice to break the journey. Saw your sign � surprised to find a
place that does real ale on this soulless stretch of road � so I thought I�d
stop in and have a quick one � or two. Nice place you�ve got here, as well.
You�re the landlord?�

�Yup.�

�Yeah,
not bad at all. Maybe I�ll come through again on my way back tomorrow. You
can keep your bra-sseries and your trendy chain bars, give
me the English country pub � original and best. And you�ve got some kind of do
on for St George�s
day tomorrow then, I see?�

�Yup.
We always do something for St George�s
Day.�

The traveller�s face
was flushed a rosy colour � it was a hot day. He loosened his tie a little. Nodding. 

�So maybe I should
buy a prize draw ticket for tomorrow. How much to enter?�

The barman put
down the glass he was polishing and looked at the traveller. 

�Thirty
quid.�

Spence gave out a little
chortle. �Thirty quid? That all?�

�Yup.�

�And � have you
sold many tickets?�

�They�re�s five
left.�

�So you�ve sold
ninety five tickets at thirty quid each? That�s not a bad little sum. And
what�s the prize � one English rose?�

�It�s for charity,�
said the barman. �Sort of a tradition round here for the regulars.�

�For
charity then? Oh, I see.�

The barman nodded.
And went back over to the TV.

&nbsp;

Seven o�clock the next evening, St George�s day, the Black Bull was filling
up. Here was Spence Thomas sitting at the bar again, nursing another slow pint
of Best. He smiled and shrugged apologetically when a hefty young lad with an England shirt
on, all tattooes and close-cropped hair, bumped against him getting his beers.
The youngster gave him a frosty look. The crowd in here was raucous and
familiar. You could tell that everyone knew each other, and there was a buzz in
the air like before a big match. Spence was enjoying himself. Yes he was
plainly the only stranger here, and no one was doing anything to make him feel
welcome. But he didn�t seem to mind. Spence thought of himself as a kind of worldly,
knowing observer. Always passing through, he didn�t stay long enough to get caught
up in a place, to get stuck. He just saw enough to pass the time, meet new
people, maybe pick up a few stories, impressions. That
way you see things about the world that maybe others don�t. Life, that�s what
it was. You only get one, so you best live it, savour to the full. 

One thing he observed
� there were no women in the pub. Except of course for the barmaid, she seemed
to be the landlord�s mrs. Not bad looking at all, in a
cheap bleached-blonde red lipstick kind of way. And showing
plenty of cleavage and a decent pair of pins under a short denim skirt. Not
in the same class at that little hottie he�d caught sight of yesterday, but you
wouldn�t say no. None of the men in here seemed to give her
much trouble though � not with the landlord looking on, and you could
see he was a force to be reckoned with. 

Now the landlord
was coming over to where Spence was sitting at the corner of the bar. And
slowly leaning over to say quietly � �I�m afraid the do�s about to start
shortly. No big rush though, take your time and finish
that pint.�

�Oh,� said Spence.
�Oh. But I was going to stay for the do.�

�Sorry, mate. It�s
ticket holders only tonight.�

�I see,� said
Spence. And started to stand up. Then
stopped, �well, alright then landlord, maybe I�ll just have to buy one of your
tickets. Thirty quid, is it?�

The landlord�s
face was blank. �Look, mate, this do is for the regulars.�

�You don�t want my
money?�

There was an
elderly man standing next to Spence now. Full thick head of
white hair and a big crooked smile in the creases of his face. �Come on there
John,� he was saying, �let the man in on it. Sell him a ticket.�

Spence waited
while the landlord considered. Then the girl with the cleavage was standing in
front of him. A hard, puckered little mouth, Spence thought. There was a strong
smell of some sharp, lemony scent. She whispered something in the landlord�s
ear. 

�Alright,� the
boss said. �Fifty quid visitors� price.�

Maybe it was
extortion, but Spence wasn�t going to back out now. He was a traveller, an
observer of life. He was intrigued now. Whatever was going to happen, he wanted
in.

&nbsp;

Some of the lads near the bar were
singing. At the far end of the bar room was a dark corner with a little stage,
a PA system set up as for karaoke, and two boxes from which coloured spotlights
lazily circled round the stage. The landlord was testing the microphone �One �
two.�

�Buckle me bloody
shoe,� shouted a man at one of the tables close up against the stage.�� 

�Gi�s a song then,�
someone else shouted.

�Ne�er mind all
that,� another voice, �lets have a look at our little rosebud then.�

Slow clapping
spread through the room, and whistles. 

The landlord held
his hands up, tapped the microphone.

�Patience,
gentlemen, patience. Just a few moments now.
Our delightful prize of the evening is just being prepared for your inspection.
And have we got a treat in store for you, gentlemen.�

The lights were
dimmed, the coloured spotlights swirled. �And here we go gentlemen, and let�s
all have a welcome for our very own English Rose of 2007, the lovely little
miss Kimberly.�

Out of the upstairs
doorway came the barmaid in the denim skirt, strutting towards the stage on
four inch high stilettoes. And with her, in fact led by the hand, came the sweetest
thing that Spence had ever seen in his life. The crowd were whooping and
whistling. The old boy gripped on Spence�s arm, �there you see? There she is. Worth every penny for the chance of a go on that.�

�The barmaid led the English Rose of 2007 onto
the stage. Next to the hard pouting face and denim skirt, here was a vision of
pure, innoccent, radiant beauty. The perfect English Rose. Soft,
wavy blonde tresses. Sapphire blue eyes shooting off
sparks from behind bashful, blinking lids.� Peaches and cream
complexion, blushing rosy cheeks. Gorgeously shaped pink lips, only
occasionally she was softly biting on the upper lip. Which
only added to her demure perfection. Eighteen if that, thought Spence. 

Yes, it was the
girl he�d seen briefly yesterday. But now rather transformed,
as she was dressed � or undressed � not at all demurely, to show her off to
perfection. 

Her peachy soft
skin, smooth teenage curves, brought off by the cutest little pink and white
lingerie. Little white triangle panties covering just her triangle, held
together by pink ribbons tied in bows across her hip-bones. On
the front a motif of a pink rose-bud. Matching bra
with another rosebud between the cups, matching garter belt and suspenders holding
up sheer white stockings. And to top it off a white ribbon round her
neck with another pink rosebud that wobbled on her throat when she swallowed. Medium height, everything fresh and pert, standing in white
stiletto pumps on a stage in front of a hundred whistling, leering men.

�Oh my word,�
groaned Spence, feeling a twitch down in his balls, �oh fuck me backwards.� 

�Fuck her
backwards,� said the old man next to him, �backwards forwards sideways and any which
ways if you�re the lucky one.�

��Here she is gentlemen,� the landlord
repeated, �our very own English Rose. Miss Kimberly Heston,
eighteen years of age. All of you here know young Kimberly, you will
have seen her collecting your empty glasses or empying your ashtray for you.
Now for one lucky fellow here tonight she�s going to be emptying a lot more
than that � (drowned out by whistles) � So for one night only, our little
Kimberly, in the first flush of youth, and � listen to this gentlemen � a bona
fide, absolute 100% genuine virgin � (cheers) � yes gentlemen, absolutely 100% medically
guaranteed this girl�s rosebud has never been plucked, this girl�s petals have
been unfurled for no man � (guffaws) � until tonight, and the honour and privilege
of plucking our little Kimmy�s little rosebud will go to one lucky � lucky?
I�ll say - fellow amongst you. For one night only, the lucky sod will get to
take our little Kimmie away with him for the night and show her a good time. In
fact he can show her whatever he pleases, and do with her � within reason, of
course, gentlemen � whatever he pleases and as much and as often as he pleases,
for one whole night. Now how does that sound to you?�

�Sounds pretty
good,� Spence shouted in the old boy�s ear, just about making himself heard over the din. The old man was nodding and
grinning like crazy, a little trail of saliva starting to run down the corner
of his open mouth. He wiped it with a frayed shirt sleeve.

Spence swigged at
his pint again and went back to gawping at Kimberley. Though he did feel one momentary twang
of conscience � it didn�t exactly look like she was enjoying all the attention.
The way she stood there, very stiff, with her head bowed a little, like she was
trying to look down and not see all the leering eyes on her. And biting her lip
more now, her face bright red with embarassment, and perhaps � though Spence
couldn�t really see from here � maybe she was shaking a bit. She certainly
looked very nervous, on edge, maybe as if she were about to cry. But of course,
she would be nervous. That didn�t mean she wasn�t happy to go along with this. 

Anyway now the
landlord did something to reassure Spence on that point. �And perhaps just a
little word from our little English Rose,� he said, and passed the microphone
to Kimberley. 

�Never mind a
word,� someone shouted, �let�s see her tits.� 

But Kimberley held the
microphone in both hands. You could clearly see she was shaking now. She lifted
the mike up to her mouth and said, in a stilted, wobbling voice � �thankyou,
gentlemen. I am very pleased to be here tonight � your
� your English Rose of 2007. I .. I would like to
thank Uncle John for giving me � this opportunity.� She stopped for a minute,
and smiled at the audience. And rushed through the last
lines. �I hope that you like your little rosebud. Thankyou
for showing me a good time.�

Wild
applause. Shouts of � I�ll show you a good time darling � Look, she�s fucking dying for it, in�t she? � She can�t
wait. � Come and sit on my lap little girl �

The landlord had
taken the microphone back again. �Now, before we get to the draw gentlemen, I�m
sure we�d all like to take the time to get to know young Kimberly a little bit
better. What do you say, gents, how�s about we ask
young Kimmie to show us a bit more of her delicious charms ��

But before they
got the chance to ask, the English Rose suddenly went all a-quiver. Covering
her face in her hands, she turned and ran off the stage towards the upstairs
doorway. Hands grabbed out at her as she ran past the tables and into the
doorway, the denim-skirted barmaid following quickly behind. 

�I�m very sorry,�
said the landlord into a shocked pause, �just a momentary hiccup, gentlemen.
The show will go on in one minute.�

�Bloody right,�
said one man, �we�ve paid good money for this you know.�

�Don�t worry, don�t worry,� said the barman, �just a few nerves.
I�ll just go and see what�s the matter.�

&nbsp;

The crowd seemed happy for the
moment to take the chance to refill glasses. There were two more barmaids
serving now � they had come down just after Kimberley�s entrance. Both of them were
lookers, two brunettes showing plenty of breast in low cut tops. �Come and get
your drinks in gents, Kimmie�ll be alright in a minute. She�s not used to all
the attention, poor girl. All the kleenex we had to
use on her upstairs, she wouldn�t stop running her make-up. Don�t worry, she�s well up for it though. I bet she�ll be a real
goer once one of you lads gets her home and starts pressing her buttons.�

Spence offered to
buy the old boy a drink. Jimmy, his name was. �So Jimmy, what can you tell me
about the de-lovely young Kimberley then?�

Jimmy took a big
gulp and explained. 

John, the
landlord, came down from London
some five years ago and took over the tenancy of the Black Bull. He said he was
a retired taxi driver. Like not a few Londoners, it was his dream to save up
enough money to move out and run a country pub. 

Deborah, the
bar-maid with the pinched mouth and the nice legs, was John�s girlfriend. She
had come with him from London
at the start. Though after a year or so she had left � they were often arguing,
and sometimes it seemed to get violent and Debbie wouldn�t come down for a few
days, or only be seen wearing dark glasses, long trousers and blouses that
covered up a lot more than usual. Then after a year she left. For a couple of
years John ran the pub on his own, and he got a
reputation for sleeping with a few of the local women, occasionally ending in
fights with their husbands. Once a mechanic called Donavan had ended up in
hospital with two broken arms after smashing all the pub�s windows and
scratching up John�s car. 

Then Debs came
back. No one knew how or why, but she was back, and things settled down again
with her and John together at the helm. 

Six months after that
� or about two years ago now � her teenaged half-sister Kimberly had moved in
with them. It seems she and Debbie shared a father. Debbie�s mum had left � or
maybe died, Jimmy wasn�t sure�
- when she was just a few years old. Her dad had met up with
Kimberly�s mum and produced the little blonde stunner. Then he � Lisa and
Kimberly�s dad � had left Kimberly�s mum, leaving her with one seven year old
daughter and one teenage step-daughter to care for. Debbie had been a
difficult, rebellious, child, insecure in her stepmother�s home, and had taken
to disappearing for weeks at a time, hitching up with undesirable men, drugs, and
all the rest of it. Kimberly was the good girl, her mother�s darling. But her
mother, broken by the father�s desertion, was weak, she didn�t know how to
control Lisa and she didn�t do much of a job of looking after Kimberly. Then
she had married again, but � as is so often the way � to another bad sort. He
had beaten her, run around with other women. Then, the story was, he had tried
to rape Kimmie. The mother had come home and stopped it just in time, putting
herself between them and getting the beating of her life for it.� (The rape hadn�t gone all the way, as Jimmy
had indeed seen the medical proof of Kimberly�s virginity test result which
John had shown round the regulars). The mother was hospitalised, the
step-father fled. Then mum came out of hospital, good daughter Kimberly had
nursed her back to health. Only to get the shock of her life one day when,
coming home from school, who should she find but the same wicked stepfather
eating his tea at the mother�s table, with Kimmie�s mum lovingly waiting on
him.

�Yes, that�s how
it goes,� said Spence, the observer of life. �Some women can�t keep away from a
bad man.�

But Kimberly knew
what she had to do. She packed a bag and left that night. She had no one else
to turn to but her half-sister Debbie, so she headed for the Black Bull. 

You couldn�t say
that the relationship between the two sisters was particularly close, but how
could Debbie turn her away? So Kimberly, then sixteen, had settled in at the pub,
collecting glasses and wiping tables to pay her way. Obviously, the way she was
put together, more than a few of the lads had tried it on with her at one time
or another. But Kimmie was always the good girl, always a bit shy, covering
herself up. Some of the men called her a tease, but that wasn�t it. She was
never one to flaunt her looks or try and use them to her advantage. She
wouldn�t have known where to start - though she might have gone to her big
sister for a few pointers. 

Of course the
other story was that John was saving her up for himself, and he didn�t seem too
keen on lads trying it on with his half-sister-in-law. With his past
reputation, Jimmy thought that was quite likely his plan. 

So, Spence didn�t
understand, how had the virginal little miss goodie-two-shoes become tonight�s
English Rose 2007? 

�Aaah�, said old
Jimmy. �You see, it�s for charity.� And he touched the side of his nose with
his bony old finger. 

&nbsp;

The crowd hushed again. Out she
came again. Trotting unsteadily up to the stage in her heels,
John walking behind with his right just hovering behind, giving her a little
push on her waist or her bum to keep her going. Then she was standing up
on the stage like before, hands by here sides, make-up run and sniffling a
little, but the tears over now. Nearby, just off the stage, the half-sister
stood just blocking the way back to the door.

�Well, well,� the
landlord said into the microphone. �Here we are again gentlemen, our little miss Kimmie had a little touch of nerves, but it�s all alright
now isn�t it darling.� Kimberly nodded her head. �Good girl. And to make up for
her little tantrum, which I understand may have had you all a little bit
worried for her, our English Rose has promised to give you an extra special
little show now. Isn�t that right darling?�

Kimberly nodded
again. Still biting her lip. More pronounced now, like
she was tearing shreds off the sensitive skin.

�So, my lovely
assistant, music please �� Debbie, standing by the tape-deck near at the side of
the stage, pressed the button, and the PA started up with �I�m horny � horny,
horny, horny ��

Gradually, hardly
at all at first, Kimberly started swaying in time with the music. Then she
found the rhythm, swung her hips into it � indeed, she smiled. Shut her eyes,
moved, and her lips � like rose petals, Spence couldn�t help rhapsodising � opened into a soft,
lost, coy little smile.

Her body took to
the rhythm � her hips back and forward, her breasts starting to bounce with it,
while the men clapped in time. She started to turn. Slowly, like a music box
ballerina, she rotated, lifting her feet in the
perilous white pumps only an inch or so each step. Until her arse � and here
Spence sighed again, what a fucking perfect delight of an arse � was jiggling
side to side in front of them, just the little white strip of flimsy cloth
stretched over the inner parts of her cheeks and disappearing into that � sweet
god � that little shadowy cleft between her legs. And then she started to bend.
She tossed her head, once, the hair running off her shoulder blades. And
began to bend at the waist, slowly gyrating down, thrusting out that snatch of
cloth between the bottoms of her bum-cheeks, then, stepping her legs a bit
wider, down more, thrusting out the little pocket between the tops of her
thighs. Jutting out her covered pouch of her pussy
towards the open-mouthed crowd, and still swinging side to side as her hair
brushed on the stage floor.

Then she started
coming up again. And stood with her back to the crowd again
moving side to side. Then as she moved her two hands came behind her
back, and her fingers � the long French-manicured nails against her back �
fiddling with the clasp of her bra. 

�Here she comes,�
old Jimmy sighing, shaking here his head, as she turned again, holding the
unstrapped cloth of the little white bra in her hands over her tits. Then, with
an intake of breath from the whole room, she pulled her hands and the material
away. �Perfect,� Spence exhaled as the plump eighteen year old tits swung free.
�I�m biting on those nipples now.�

She was massaging
the tits, plumping them up, then dropping her hands, letting her arms and the
tits sway as she moved side to side. Her eyes were shut again, her lips tightly
bunched up. Now she seemed to be biting on her lower lip as she danced. 

�Come on Kimmie,�
the youngster who had bumped against Spence before was shouting. �Come on girl,
let�s get those knickers off. Let�s see that snatch you little tart.�

Kimberly had her
fingers looped in the ribbon of the little white panties. Her fingers fumbled,
made to tug down at the pink ribbon. But not yet. She
just carried on swaying side to side. The men whistled, they
started slow clapping. Eyes shut, she just
carried on doing the same thing, swaying side to side. Then the song finished.

�Come on, Kimmie,�
shouted the man again. Others started jeering, shouting: �Off! Off! Off!� 

The landlord came
back up on to the stage and took the microphone. �Alright,
alright. Don�t you worry, the show�s not over
yet. Don�t you worry, you�ll see the lot. Maybe � (his voice lowered to a stage
whisper) � maybe though, our Kimmie could do with a little bit of help ��

A mass out-take of
breath around the room. Spence put down his beer glass afraid it would snap
with the tension. This was something, alright. This was something to see. A
hundred men in the room poised to jump up and tear this little rosebud to
shreds. And now the thought of getting your fingers and easing off those tiny
little panties � 

�I do believe,�
said the landlord, �that time has come for the draw. And I�ll ask the lucky
winner to join us up here on stage and personally remove this pair of panties
from our delectable young English Rose of 2007. I�m sure the winner won�t mind
sharing the sight with all our friends here ��

Cacophony
of whistles and cheers. Up walked Debbie with the hat in which the
hundred names were placed. Spence�s too. It could just be �

The girl stood
trembling, the crowd hushed and open-mouthed, as the landlord dragged out every
last drop of tension � �and the second prize, a keg of Old Streaky, that king
of real ales �� - but no one would remember the name of the winner of the keg
of Old Streaky - �and the winner, that lucky feller, tonight�s star prize goes
to � well if it isn�t young David Baxter.

This, it turned
out, was the young bruiser who had nearly spilled Spence�s beer earlier on. The
young shaven-headed gentleman just stood shaking his head with a grin the size
of England
across his face. His mates were clapping him on the back and giving him evil
jealous curses. As he walked over to the stage, all swagger and shoulders, the
cheers broke out again. 

Old Jimmy was
nudging Spence on the shoulder. �Well, that�s how it goes,� he said. �But never
mind. And that�s gonna be something, that David Baxter.
You see, there�s a history between those two. There�s a bit of a history. Young
Dave�s a bit of a jack the lad round here, you see, and he�s always been trying
it on with her. She kept her distance though. But then one night her sister
convinced her into going out for a date with that Dave, kind of set them up. He
had to promise John he wouldn�t try anything on, but it was allowed, because
John has a bit of a soft spot for the lad � there�ll be some saying it was a
fix of course - but there�s always gonna be talk like that. 

�Anyways, what
happened was young Dave took her out for the evening. The story is he tried to
give her just a little goodnight peck, and she slapped him one in the face.
Slapped him right in the face �� the old vulture was guffawing � �now, she�s
gonna get her comeuppance, and then some.�

Then they turned
to look back at the stage again, as the crowd was chanting � �Off! Off! Off!
Off!� Dave the once-slapped suitor was bending in front of the little beauty,
pale as everything and now with tears plainly rolling down her cheeks � did
anyone see? Did anyone care? It was a feeding frenzy now. Spence, the observer
of life, he observed those tears � but the show was too strong, too wild, and �
well there�s no question anything could be done now, even if you started to
have a doubt � the game was well underway now. Dave was fumbling over the
little bows that held up the panties on her hips. Undid one,
then the other. He pulled the cloth away. Stepped back to stare at what
was revealed. So sweet, thought Spence, craning his neck over
a shoulder to look as close as he could, so white, so delicate. The
little bush trimmed into one little strip, landing strip it�s called. What you
wouldn�t give �

Dave was alive
again now. He was going to give them all a show. He handled her like a toy,
pushing her knees to shuffle open in the stiletto pumps. Turned round to look
at the crowd and sucked his thumb like Peter Piper, leering. �It�s going in,�
he said. 

The half-sister Debbie
was standing next to the girl now, holding her up. She had her eyes shut. Dave
stroked her little strip of fur and ran his fingers over her pussy-lips. Then parted the lips with his left hand as the wet thumb probed at
the opening.

�Yes my friends,�
he shouted back at the crowd, �it�s tight alright. But sonny-boy�s going in
there.�

After he�d got the
thumb in and made her jiggle for the crowd on it, shaking her tits, the next
trick was for her to turn round and bend over. �Touch your toes girlie. That�s
right you little tart, all the way over. Spread them legs for us.�

And to the crowd �
�take a good look gents. Take a look at that tight
little virgin snatch. That�s all for Davey-boy.� He slapped her on the rump.
�Not long now girlie, you�re going to find out what that little hole of yours
was made for.�

It wasn�t long
before the first ordeal was over. They put a coat on her and Dave led her away
to a car and her �big night of passion.� As the regulars filed out at closing
time, Spence was one of the last, sitting up with Jimmy silent now on another
pint and a chaser. 

�Well that was
something,� the old man was slurring to himself, �that was some show.�

Spence nodded. He
saw a flash of the girl bent over, white thighs strained, tight calves in those
stockings, blonde hair brushing the floor, and her cunt winking at you like a
beautiful dreamy eye. Then he saw her walking out of the pub, or walked out
rather, that lucky hooligan supporting her every step � she was lifeless, in
shock, her eyes beyond the world, even beyond crying, just the lines of her dead
tears down her thickly powdered face, and her lip bitten purple. For one
second, Spence thought, as she passed, their eyes met. Something in him
quivered. It was that look he remembered when he was beating off that night
back in the hotel room. It was that look he couldn�t get out of him all the
days to come.

2.

Spence Thomas was passing through
town again about two weeks after St
  George�s day, and this is what he did. Again it was a
quiet afternoon when he drove up to the Black Bull, placed himself at the bar and
ordered a pint of Best. John, the landlord, nodded at him with recognition, but
no more welcome than he�d expected. But the next half hour found them huddled
together in conversation, free drinks were served, and the upshot was a
substantial amount of money changed hands. 

����������� It
was the next day, Spence Thomas was sitting in a quiet
room, the private room that was rarely opened, at the back of the pub. The
light was dim with thick lace curtains over the fake-Tudor paned windows �
anyway the day was dull. She came in alone, Kimberly, and sat down across the
table. 

����������� �Would
you like a drink of something,� asked Spence.

����������� She
asked for a coke. Spence bustled round to the bar and brought it back. She sat
there wearing jeans and a gap sweatshirt, her hair tied back in a ponytail, her
hands clasped in her lap under the table. She looked down or around, but Spence
could remember those eyes. 

����������� �So,
Kimberly, like John said, I�d just like you to tell me, just talk me through
what happened that night. You don�t worry about me, I�m just your uncle Spence,
I�m nobody, you just go on.�

����������� She
drank a sip of the coke and began.

����������� �The
car was waiting, it was his friend driving. He opened the door for me and I got
in the back seat. He got in. He took me to a flat � I don�t know what flat, I
think he still lives with his mum so ��

����������� �Wait,
slow down, slow down. What about in the car � didn�t
he do anything in the car?�

����������� �I
was wearing that coat, like, I don�t know, like an old kind of overcoat. That�s
all I had on, and those white stockings and shoes. He got in and sat right next
to me. He put his hand in the coat, that was the first
thing. He opened the coat up � it wasn�t buttoned up � like he was unwrapping some kind of present or something. He was gentle,
then. Like a present. He didn�t even say nothing. He
was gentle. He even stroked my hair. He said � don�t worry Kimmie, don�t be so
scared. I�m not gonna hurt you am I? Just gonna play with you a little. I
always liked you Kimmie. Don�t worry, not about all the things I did in there.
That was just playing, I had to give them a show
didn�t I? 

����������� �He was almost like
whispering. Relax, he said. Give me a kiss. He kissed me. He had his hand on �
on my tummy, on my side. He was stroking me with his hand. But gentle like. On my tits. On my tummy. On my legs.

����������� �There, he said, don�t
worry. It�s just you and me now, I�m not gonna hurt you. You see, you shouldn�t
have slapped me that time, I�m not so rough. I know how to treat a girl.�

����������� �What were you thinking
when he said that? Did you believe him?� 

����������� �I was thinking about
his friend, in the front. I don�t know what I believed. But it wasn�t just us,
I thought, there�s his friend in the front. He�s saying it�s just us but his
friend is watching it all in the mirror isn�t it.�

����������� �You let him kiss you?�

����������� �Let him kiss me? He
had his hands all over me.�

����������� �How did it feel, how
did his hands feel?�

����������� �He was gentle. But �
look, I tried to relax. I thought � whatever�s gonna happen it�s gonna happen
isn�t it. It wasn�t so bad now without all the people watching, maybe he�s
right. All the lights, and � it was dark in the car, just the streetlights, the
car moving. That�s all that happened in the car, it wasn�t a long drive.�

����������� �Okay. So you got to
this flat. You don�t know whose flat it was. Tell me what happened then. And
remember, I want details. I even want you to tell me about the flat, what it
was like, little details. Okay?�

����������� She nodded. Sipped some more coke. Her voice was flat, something like
metal, like iron, like tin. It had all the fresh tones of youth in it � she was
eighteen years old � but just stayed within this narrow register. But she told
it all very well. She didn�t stop to cry or choke. She was doing a good job.
Spence even told her so � �you�re doing very well. It�s
okay, you can do it. Just tell me the details, that�ll be easier, think of it
like you�re looking from a distance, the details, don�t think about what it all
means. It doesn�t mean anything, it�s over now. You can do it, you�re a strong
girl. You�re a brave girl.�

����������� �Am I?� she said. �I
don�t know. We�re at the flat, then. He walks me up the steps,
I�m still wearing the coat. And those bleeding high heels.
Like a bambi, I can hardly walk. He walks me up the steps with his hand round
my arse. His hand keeps moving, on my arse. A little pat.
Like I�m his dog or something. I guess I am. 

����������� �He opens the door. Switches on the light. What�s the flat like? It�s a nice
flat. There�s one of those wooden floors down in the hallway, what�s it called
��

����������� �Laminate, wood
laminate.�

����������� �That�s it, laminate.
It�s tidy. There�s coats hung up on hooks in the corridor. Spotlights.
And, I remember, a little tricycle, you know a plastic kiddie�s tricycle.
Whoever lives in the flat has got kids. I guess one of his mates, with kids. He
says � let�s get you out of that coat, and slips it off me, and hangs it up on
one of the hooks. So � you want details � there I am, all naked, just wearing
those white high heels, and he looks me all over.
�You�re a beauty alright,� he says. And runs this one finger over
me. Down my shoulders, down my arms. Just touching me with one finger. Circling
it on my tummy. Then down on � on my hair, down there. And between my legs. I�m just standing there while he does
this. He wants to play with his toy, doesn�t he. He�s
like a kid with a toy. He puts his finger down between my legs and rubs it
there � rubs it against my pussy. Then trying to push it in
my pussy. �You beauty,� he says, �you little beauty.� He keeps repeating
himself, you see. Rubbing his finger in my pussy. How
does it feel? Nothing much. Nothing
much really. Something stiff, something raw.
I�m very tight, he says, I need to relax.�

����������� �Did you have your eyes
closed?�

����������� �No. I remember � I was
looking over at the wall, along the corridor, there was an open door, I was
looking at the doorframe, I was looking at the
paintwork on the bleeding doorframe.�

����������� �Did he get his finger
in your pussy?�

����������� �Yes. But it was very
tight, like he said. It hurt. Not really hurt. It irritated.�

����������� �Then
what?�

����������� �Then, he held my hand,
and he led me into the flat. He said � I need to piss, it�s all that beer
girlie. So what did he want me to do about it? He wanted me to go with him. We
went into the bathroom. He wanted me to watch while he took a leak.�

����������� Well it was more than
that. They go into the bathroom, he unzips his fly and
takes out his dick. His dick isn�t hard? No, it wasn�t hard. Well, kind of a
little bit. He�d been drinking a lot, it�s true. It wasn�t so hard he couldn�t
piss while this naked eighteen year old virgin in white high-heeled pumps stood
there ready to be fucked. When he was pretty much finished pissing he got her
to put his hold his dick as he shook out the last few drops. Good girl, he
says, that�s it, now let�s get this sonny-boy all nice and clean and ready for
that little pussy of yours. 

����������� He got her to kneel on
the floor and lick the end of his dick. She didn�t really care about the taste, that was the last thing she was had to worry about.
They stayed there in the bathroom a while with her licking his dick, then he
showed her how to suck on it, stroking her head and calling her �a good girl�,
like his little pet. How did she feel about that? No, she didn�t mind. It was
almost kind of reassuring, Spence gathered, soft and gentle like, to be stroked
on the head and him talking softly to her. And actually she was concentrating
hard on trying to suck his dick, it wasn�t all that easy. Yes, he had a big
dick, as far as she knew, now it was getting hard,
anyway it was big in her mouth. She had to stretch her mouth hard not to scrape
it with her teeth. Once she scraped it and he patted her on the cheek and said
� �I don�t want to feel your teeth girlie. You do that again and it won�t be so
gentle.�

����������� Then he started to push
back on her head until she was choking. He kept pushing. �Don�t fight,� he
said. �Don�t you fight me. I�ve been nice to you up to
now.�

����������� This went on for a long
time. It must have been all the beer, thought Spence. You�d think you�d be
coming in her mouth within seconds. But he didn�t come. He just gripped the
back of her head and fucked her mouth harder. He seemed to have got frustrated
after a while. Anyway this was when he stopped being so nice. When he was
pounding her head, saying � �you little slut, don�t let me feel those fucking
teeth or I�ll knock them out of your mouth. You understand?�

����������� She started to be
afraid again. She was crying. It was just too much. She had been numb, then he�d calmed her, even warmed her a little. Isn�t it
strange how a few soft words can calm you even in a situation like that? Like you�ve got something to hold onto. But now it was like
it was starting all over again. He pulled his dick out of her mouth and pulled
her up by the hand. He took her in the bedroom. He got her to sit on the end of
the bed and try her mouth on his cock again. After a while he took it out and
that was the first time he slapped her. 

����������� �You remember, Kimmie?
You remember when you were too good for me? How does it feel now my little
princess? How does it feel now you�re my little slut?�

����������� Then it just went on
and on. He lay her down on the bed and fucked her. Yes, she bled. Yes, it hurt
like crazy at first. But maybe the pain was something to hold onto. There would
be more pain, later, when he whipped her with his belt. Then
fucked her again, every time he fucked her. Did he look like he was
enjoying it? She supposed so. Yes, he was enjoying it alright. His face all
twisted up as he drilled into her dry cunt. Pound into it
when the juices started to flow. �You little whore,
you�re loving it now you dirty little whore.� Yes, he had a great time. 

����������� She, she was his toy,
she was a rag doll. There was no life in her. It just happened to her. He
fucked her and came and even slept a bit � she didn�t sleep � and woke up and
turned her on her front and fucked her again. �Wake up darling, here�s what
you�ve been dreaming of.�

����������� In the morning John
picked her up in his car. It was nine, ten
 o�clock. Dave kissed her on the mouth at the doorway of the flat,
put his arm round her. �That�s my girlie.�

����������� �Have you seen him
since?�

����������� �Yeah, of course, he
comes in the pub don�t he.�

����������� �What happens when you
see him?�

����������� �Nothing.
Well, if he�s with his mates he has to make a bit of a show of it. Squeezes my arse. Says something.
They all laugh. He has to be the jack the lad doesn�t he.
Like, I wonder about that night, he had to fuck me all those times, sometimes I
don�t even know if he wanted to so much, but he had to have something to tell
his mates didn�t he.�

����������� �But he never fucked
you in the arse?�

����������� �No.�

����������� �Why
not?�

����������� �Well, actually, I
think he tried to. I don�t know. But I think it just wasn�t going in.�

����������� This was the first time
she looked up at Spence with a stroke of life, of defiance. Something, Spence hoped, that she would carry forever. She even laughed. She
had some guts, that girl. Somehow, Spence thought, we are nothing to her. She�s
got something, that girl. They do have, don�t they, women. We fuck them
backwards, forwards, whatever way you like, we fuck them around, and they�ve
still got something we can�t take away. Don�t think you�ll ever take it away.
And isn�t that why we just keep coming back for more? 

����������� 

Spence went back to the bar for another pint. Just one more, take it easy boy. And this one needs savouring. 

&nbsp;

Upstairs they�d got her all ready now. She was wearing the same things
as on St George�s
night. Just as he�d ordered, right down to the white stockings and the little
white bow around her neck, with the rosebud on her throat. He moved her off the
bed and put her over the dressing table, he could see her face in the mirror. 

����������� �That�s my girl,� he
said, �I�m not gonna hurt you. It�ll be alright.�

����������� He didn�t bother with
untying the ribbons � that had ben done before after all � but slid the little
white panties over her hips, slowly down her legs. Stroked her belly and her
bottom, ran his finger between her legs. Pulled her bottom
out so it brushed against his crotch. He had to turn away for a moment
to get the lubricant and squeeze some out on his finger. Even turning away was
losing a moment of this perfect spectacle, this little beauty. But then his
finger was between her legs with the cold gel and pressing on the little �
well, it�s more than a clich� now, but on the little bud of her arsehole. In it
went. This was going to be something very special.
