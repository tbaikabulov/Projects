Synopsis: Spreading some good cheer around the holidays.A Strip Searchin' Santa  
By  
  Deputy Duffy   
The distinctive tick of the large oak grandfather clock was the only
    sound heard, as the two lawyers sat in wonderment. Their boss had just called
    them into his office, presented his proposal, and left them alone to make
    their decisions.
 
&quot;What do you think, Stewart?&quot;
 
  Stewart looked at the pretty blonde who had asked the question and tried to
  play it tough. &quot;Doesn't look like we have much choice, now. We blew it,
  plain and simple.&quot;
 
&quot;I still don't know...maybe....&quot;
 
&quot;What, after this case, you wanna look for another job?&quot;
 
&quot;No, it's not that, it's just....&quot;
 
&quot;Look Alexandra, I'm not that happy about it either, and I know, I know,&quot; Stewart
said, reading her face. &quot;I know I'm a guy, and it's a little different.
But it's only once, and we get to go home after that, and, most important, we
keep our jobs.&quot;
 
&quot;But, I don't know...I'll...I mean, we'll be the laughing stock of the....&quot;
 
&quot;We already are!&quot; Stewart interrupted. &quot;We already are.&quot;
 
  The room fell deathly silent, except for the clock. The ticking seemed to hypnotize
  Alexandra. Her mind raced back in time, nearly a year. It was another Christmas
  season.
 
  She had a good paying job as a defense attorney, with a large, well-known firm,
  located high in a skyscraper. She had so many reasons besides the holidays
  to be excited. She had just celebrated her first wedding anniversary. She had
  finally moved out of the big city, into a large home with a white picket fence.
  She was looking forward to starting a family. She seemingly had it all going
  for her, when she got the call she had been waiting for.
 
  Her first murder defense.
 
  Her client was Heather Bracey, the wife of a wealthy real-estate developer,
  who had turned up dead. The evidence was thin and circumstantial, but Heather
  was arrested and charged with his murder.
 
  Alexandra was happy that her boss, Ben Davis, had finally called her number.
  She had been working at the firm for 10 years and was starting to think that
  the old boys system might be more than just her imagination.
 
  Of course, she still had to work on the case with Stewart Hart, a handsome
  lawyer, known for his smooth style. They worked night and day, much to the
  chagrin of her new husband. Their first success was getting Heather freed on
  bail. Their second was getting a predominantly female jury. Then the case finally
  came to trial.
 
  In the much publicized case, everything was going well for the defense...that
  is, until a surprise witness turned up at the last moment, a woman who said
  she heard Heather threaten to kill her husband, &quot;one of these days, for
  his life insurance money.&quot; It was questionable, but it seemed to swing
  the jury. The guilty verdict blared from news reports for days. That verdict
  meant life without parole for Heather and a black eye for the firm.
 
&quot;Well, I'm signing the damn thing,&quot; Stewart cried out, startling Alexandra
back to reality. &quot;There, now I need a drink. Care to follow?&quot;
 
&quot;Huh?&quot; She blinked. &quot;Aren't we supposed....&quot;
 
&quot;I don't know,&quot; Stewart snapped. &quot;Fuck if I know anything anymore...other
than there's a bottle of bourbon out there with my name on it.&quot;
 
  The sound of the slamming door jarred Alexandra's already frayed nerves. It
  also reminded her of her client, locked away behind bars.
 
&quot;Just think of what she's going through. Isn't that what Mr. Davis said?&quot; Alexandra
sighed, and then she signed her name to the papers that her boss had drawn up.
She almost laughed at the pen's red ink. It was like she'd just signed in her
own blood. She knew there was no going back, now.
 
  She rose from her seat just as her boss opened the door. &quot;All signed?&quot; he
  asked. Alexandra couldn't even look him in the eye. She just nodded in passing. &quot;Good.
  Then I guess we'll see you Friday night.&quot; Alexandra cringed at just how
  literal his comment was.
 
  She fled to the parking lot, hopped in her new car, and then drove and drove.
  She didn't even know where to go. She thought about joining Stewart for some
  drinks. But she knew how that would look. She could go home to her husband.
  But he would just have sex on his mind, and that's the last thing she wanted
  right now. She finally found herself at her favorite aunt's house, some two
  hours away from where she'd started.
 
  Alexandra was an orphan and an only child. Aunt Mildred was all she had in
  the way of family and had seemingly always been there for her. Mildred also
  put her through law school. She sat in the car almost afraid to move, but she
  just had to tell someone, and mostly she needed someone to tell her it was
  going to be alright.
 
  Alexandra finally got the courage to ring the doorbell. Her aunt was happy
  to see her, but not surprised, because she had been following the case on TV.
  After some small talk, Mildred asked the crucial question: &quot;How'd things
  go with your boss?&quot;
 
  Alexandra, through a flood of tears, went on to burble a rambling blow-by-blow
  account of that meeting.
 
&quot;Here, now, it's not that bad,&quot; her aunt said, wiping some tears with
a hankie. &quot;I mean, I'm not sure I heard you right.&quot;
 
&quot;I know...I-I still...c-can't believe it.&quot; Alexandra sniffled.
 
&quot;So, let's see if I got this straight,&quot; her aunt said, handing over
the hankie. &quot;First your boss tells you that he's angry with your courtroom
performance, and he scolds you for missing that witness. He goes on to say that
you should experience just a small taste of what your client will endure in her
trip to prison, and then maybe next time you won't be so careless. He says he
should fire both of you, but he will give you one more shot, if you....&quot;
 
&quot;Yep,&quot; Alexandra said, nodding her head, and then she blew her nose.
 
&quot;Oh my!&quot;
 
&quot;And it's all in writing, like it was my idea, and I already signed it,&quot; Alexandra
moaned.
 
&quot;Oh, my dear!&quot;
 
&quot;Yeah, I'm going to have to do it now...I guess.&quot;
 
&quot;H-have you ever...&quot; her aunt mumbled, looking for the words.
 
&quot;What, been Strip-Searched?&quot; Alexandra gasped, and then just shook
her head.
 
&quot;Ok, ah, I knew that, but did you ever see someone else?&quot;
 
&quot;Nope,&quot; Alexandra groaned. &quot;I can only imagine.&quot;
 
&quot;Not for long.&quot;
 
&quot;Auntie!&quot;
 
  Both women enjoyed a nervous giggle, before Aunt Mildred scratched her head. &quot;You
  said you wouldn't know who was strip-searching you. I don't get it.&quot;
 
&quot;Well, that's where the firm's Christmas party comes into play,&quot; Alexandra
said, as she stood up and started to nervously pace the floor. &quot;It's like
a costume party, too. We all dress up in Christmas-like costumes, so....&quot;
 
&quot;Oh, so the guy will be wearing a costume?&quot;
 
&quot;Yep. A Santa costume.&quot;
 
&quot;A Santa costume!&quot; her aunt said with a laugh. &quot;Funny -- A Strip-Searchin'
Santa.&quot;
 
&quot;Oh, funny, Ha-Ha.&quot;
 
&quot;No..., I believe that's 'HO-HO.'&quot;
 
&quot;Auntie!&quot;
 
&quot;I'm just trying to lighten you up a bit. Geez, it's not the end of the
world. It's just a little nudity. It's not like you're old or overweight or anything.&quot;
 
&quot;It's not that, Auntie. I didn't tell the worst part.... The guys I work
with...my fellow lawyers...well, they get to, ah, watch, too,&quot; Alexandra
stammered.
 
&quot;What?&quot;
 
&quot;Yeah, the way my boss put it...it's like I'm their naked Christmas present,
because they've been good and I've been bad.&quot;
 
&quot;But, how?&quot;
 
&quot;Though this glass window in one of the conference rooms...worst part is
I won't be able to see them, but they'll .... Oh, I don't want to even think
about it.&quot;
 
&quot;Ok, if you can't see 'em, then just pretend they're not there.&quot;
 
&quot;Easier said....&quot;
 
&quot;I know, but you have to try to put it out of mind...and from the sound
of it, you have little choice. You just have to get some more cases under your
belt and then find a better place to work, maybe even go out on your own.&quot;
 
&quot;Yeah, that sounds good, Auntie.&quot; Alexandra hugged her.
 
"Now, go make me proud." Her aunt walked her to the door and gave one last piece
of advice. &quot;Don't tell your hubby.&quot;
 
  Alexandra agreed. She remembered how mad he'd gotten last year when he found
  out that her boss had made a new rule that spouses weren't allowed at the firm's
  Christmas party -- and how jealous he was about her spending so much time with
  Stewart. Alexandra was less depressed as she made the long drive home. Even
  though her aunt had had some fun teasing her, she felt better.
 
  As the days passed, Alexandra's nerves were fraying. She spent some time searching
  for a costume, until her boss informed her that he had special costumes for
  her and Stewart to wear at the party. Alexandra tried to put it out of her
  mind, but she just couldn't. She remembered the see-through elf costume that
  her boss made Victoria, the only other female attorney, wear last year.
 
&quot;But at least she had something on,&quot; Alexandra sighed, as she stood
in front of the full length mirror on the back of her bathroom door. Wrapped
in a towel, she stared at her reflection. &quot;God, I'm even afraid to drop
the towel now. How am I ever going to get through it?&quot;
 
  Finally, it was Friday afternoon, and Alexandra found herself in her boss's
  office. She looked at the tall clock. &quot;In less then an hour I'll probably
  be naked,&quot; she sighed.
 
  Stewart joined her a short time later, followed by her boss, who promptly pulled
  two shopping bags from his closet. &quot;Here are your costumes; everything
  you need is inside,&quot; he said, handing each of them a bag. &quot;Mr. Hart,
  you can change in the bathroom across the hall. Mrs. Montana, you can use my
  private bath...right here.&quot;
 
  Alexandra made her way past her boss and into a small bathroom. She locked
  the door behind her and put the bag down on the counter next to the sink. After
  slipping off her suit coat. she just stared at the brown bag for several minutes,
  too scared to look inside. She could hear the sounds of music, so she knew
  the party was underway, and they were probably all waiting for her.
 
&quot;God, how did I get myself into this?&quot; She opened the bag and slowly
took out the items one by one. &quot;Well, I guess it could have been worse.&quot;
 
  She took a deep breath, kicked off her shoes, and slipped out of her red silk
  blouse, folding it neatly on the counter. Her black skirt and sheer white stockings
  followed. She wiped a bead of sweat from her forehead. The heat from the bright
  lights, she surmised.
 
  She glanced at the door, just to double-check the lock, before unhooking and
  removing her white lacy bra and then she rolled down her matching panties.
  She was now standing stark naked in her boss's bathroom. That simple fact made
  her heart begin to race, and she sped up her movements. She grabbed the plastic
  bag that had a small pair of panties in them. It was a struggle to rip open
  the bag, her ample breasts bouncing and shaking with the effort.
 
&quot;Finally,&quot; Alexandra gasped as she pulled the panties out. She shook
her head at the small red and green candy-canes print on the white cotton panties. "What
am I twelve!" she sputtered, felling like a little girl when she wiggled into
them.   
Next was a flimsy, makeshift bra, little more than a strapless strip
    of white silk. Like the panties, it was just a little too small. Then she
    reached for the tiny skirt. It was red (with white fur trim), extremely low-rise,
    and held together by only two buttons. There was a matching red crop-top
    that she slipped on. She dropped the black high-heeled pumps on the floor
    and shook her head, wondering how they knew her size. But when she stepped
    into them, she found that they were a bit too big, so she figured someone
    had just guessed -- and nearly got it right.
 
  Finally, she put on the stocking cap, also red with white fur trim, and then
  stepped back to look at herself in the mirror that hung over the sink. She
  just shook her head. &quot;I'm like Santa's slutty little helper,&quot; she
  muttered.   
Her eyes roamed over her body. &quot;Let's see. My skirt's too short,
    my top's too small, and the silk bandeau ought to have been a real bra. And
    what's with these stripper heels -- could they be any taller?&quot; Alexandra
    stared at her reflection. &quot;Oh yeah, Mr. Davis picked out this costume...no
    doubt about it!&quot; Anger replaced sarcasm in her voice.
 
  A knock on the door startled Alexandra, and it was a moment before she could
  open the door. She expected to see her boss, but it was Stewart, instead, wearing
  his costume. She let out a small giggle, before she quickly apologized. He
  was wearing the same costume as she was, except he was carrying his high heels. &quot;If
  they think I'm wearing these they're crazy.&quot; Alexandra couldn't help giggling
  again. It was strange, but seeing him in that outfit relaxed her.   
"It really could have been worse," she sighed.
 
  Tom Jackson, one of their colleagues, came up at that moment and immediately
  started to guffaw. Eventually, after he calmed down, he lead them to the conference
  rooms. Alexandra went into the large conference room, Stewart into the smaller
  one.
 
  Once inside, Alexandra spotted the mirror and blushed at her reflection. She
  knew there were faces behind there, but not exactly who or exactly how many.
  But she got the feeling that there were a lot, because she could hear hooting
  and hollering, even though the conference rooms were supposed to be soundproof.
  She spent some time scanning the room looking for hidden cameras. She had made
  sure that the proposal she signed stated that there were to be no cameras and
  no photos of her search. She looked back at the glass. She shrugged, praying
  that her boss was the man of his word that he'd always said he was.
 
  Then the door opened, startling Alexandra. The sight of a large woman dressed
  all in black entering the conference room startled her more, even though she
  knew the woman was coming. Her boss told her that he had hired a prison guard
  from out of state to train and then to assist the mystery Santa with the strip-search.
 
&quot;Hi, Alexandra, my name is Beth, and I'm Santa's little helper.&quot; Alexandra
extended her hand in greeting, but the large woman just shook her head. &quot;No.
Don't be misled by my civil greeting. I am not your friend. In fact, I'm just
the opposite. I'm here to make sure that Santa does his job and that he doesn't
take it easy on ya. I was hired to do a job, and I plan on doing it.&quot;
 
  Alexandra shivered. She didn't know if Beth was just trying to scare her, but
  it was certainly working.
 
&quot;Now, seeing as Santa's a man of few words, he will be carrying a cane,
and he'll use it to point to an article of your clothing. You will then take
it off -- and no crying, no complaining. Clear?&quot;
 
  Alexandra could only nod in disbelief.
 
&quot;Is that clear?&quot; Beth hissed.
 
&quot;Yes,&quot; Alexandra moaned, and then, reading the woman's look, she added, &quot;Yes,
Ma'am.&quot;
 
&quot;Good, and just so you know -- it's ALL coming off.... We are going to be
using the policies for new jailbirds entering my prison, set in place by MY boss.
And, honestly, I'm going to enjoy it, 'cause if there is one thing I can't stand,
it's a lousy shyster -- especially a defense attorney.&quot;
 
&quot;Oh great!&quot; Alexandra groaned to herself.
 
&quot;Are you ready to start? We have a lot of anxious faces on the other side
of the glass waiting, and I have one lucky Santa with his magic cane.&quot;
 
  Alexandra just shook her head. She never remembered being this nervous her
  whole life, even when she took her boards.
 
&quot;Oh, so we need a little more time.&quot; Alexandra cringed at the teasing
way the woman said it. &quot;Well, tough shit! 'cause it's show-time.&quot;
 
  Alexandra could also hear a loud roar from the hidden crowd. She looked to
  the door, and in walked a classically dressed Santa.
 
&quot;Ho-Ho-Ho.&quot; was all he said, and Alexandra immediately tried to figure
out who he was.
 
&quot;Over here now, stand on this.&quot; Alexandra watched in horror as Beth
dropped a holiday place-mat onto the floor, right in front of the mirror. &quot;Move
it!&quot;
 
  Alexandra couldn't move. Her mind was telling her legs to make a run for it,
  but they were frozen. Beth snapped her fingers several times, before she lunged
  at Alexandra, grabbed her by the wrist, and dragged her over to the mat. She
  surprised Alexandra by spinning her towards the conference table and draping
  her across the polished mahogany.
 
&quot;When I tell you to move, you move!&quot; Beth spat, and her hand came crashing
down on Alexandra's backside. Alexandra let out a squeal -- just as she did when
the first swat was followed by four more, each landing hard and on target.
 
&quot;Now stand your ass up,&quot; Beth said, helping her up. &quot;And dry those
tears. I told you no crying.&quot; Alexandra did her best, while also pulling
her skirt down, but she was just so humiliated, to be given a spanking right
in front of Santa (and God only knows who else).
 
  They allowed her a couple of minutes to regain her composure. Beth even gave
  her a small paper cup of water, but soon enough announced that it was &quot;time
  to get on with it.&quot; Alexandra sniffled and looked sidelong at the mirror.
  She knew she would be giving the spectators a good profile view. Santa waddled
  up in front of her. She stared into his eyes, searching for a clue there, but
  they didn't look familiar. She then watched, trembling, as his cane slowly
  rose, stopping only inches from her breasts.
 
  Alexandra gulped, the search had begun.
 
  Santa's cane dropped to the floor. Alexandra looked down at her crop-top. It
  wasn't much, but she had to really force herself to take it off. Her hands
  were trembling, and she could feel her heart pounding. She clutched the garment
  to her chest until she saw Santa's cane rise again. Confused, it took Alexandra
  a couple of seconds to interpret Beth's impatient gestures. Finally understanding,
  she wistfully draped the crop-top over Santa's cane. Santa, with a snap, flipped
  it into the corner behind them. Alexandra gasped, picturing the rest of her
  costume piled up there in the corner. Even though it was mere feet away, it
  seemed like miles.
 
  Alexandra watched wide-eyed as Santa tapped his cane on the floor, twice. It
  began to rise slowly, higher and higher, until it stopped inches from her breasts
  again. She shuddered. She knew she was seconds from exposing her breasts to
  all. She looked down at her heaving chest, remembering that she'd sworn none
  of the guys at work would ever see them. For ten years, she had kept them hidden
  under suit coats or baggy tops. That was ten years of fighting to be respected
  for her brainpower, rather than being judged merely by the size of her chest,
  down the tubes.
 
  Santa's cane again tapped the floor twice and then lifted. And Alexandra hadn't
  moved. She tried to focus on her aunt's words, as she slid an arm under the
  makeshift bra and lifted it off. She watched as it slid down the cane a few
  inches, before it sailed into the air and landed next to her top. She shivered.
 
&quot;Ho-Ho-Ho,&quot; Santa bellowed, while Beth chuckled at the folded-arms-across-the-chest
pose Alexandra had struck.
 
&quot;Well, Santa, looks like someone's a little tease, or maybe a little embarrassed,&quot; Beth
said, never taking her eyes off the pink-faced Alexandra. &quot;But I've seen
it before, and I have the cure. It looks like this.&quot;
 
  Alexandra inhaled sharply, as she watched Beth put both of her hands behind
  her head before spreading her elbows back. &quot;Well, what you waiting for?&quot;
 
&quot;You can't be serious,&quot; Alexandra groaned. &quot;I am not a conv....&quot;
 
&quot;You're to do what we say, bitch!&quot; Beth shouted. &quot;Or the next
spanking will be on your bare ass.&quot;
 
  It took several seconds for Alexandra to muster the courage to move into the
  humiliating position.
 
&quot;Now, I want you too make a slow circle all the way around,&quot; Beth ordered.
 
  Alexandra's body quivered. She knew what that would do. It was also sinking
  in that Beth was here to do much more than just assist Santa. Alexandra looked
  to her left and then made a quick circuit to her right.
 
  Beth frowned. &quot;Not good enough. This time, go the other way...and much
  slower.&quot; Oh, yes. Beth was definitely here to humiliate. And Alexandra
  was humiliated, when she turned left and saw her naked breasts in the mirror.
  She could also hear muttering from the other side of the glass, as she made
  her slow circle.
 
&quot;Well, well, Santa, looks like someone is happy to see yah,&quot; Beth said,
nudging him.
 
  Alexandra cringed, even though she had heard the jokes about her erect nipples
  before. And she was certain someone had turned the AC on high, even on this
  cold winter's night.
 
  Beth moved over and stood right by Alexandra's side, facing the mirror. She
  leaned forward, her face only inches away from Alexandra's breasts. She gasped,
  as Beth cupped her nearest breast in her hand.   
&quot;I've seen a lot of tits in my job, so, in my professional opinion,
  they're 32 or 34D. I'll go with 34.&quot; Alexandra grimaced at Beth's nerve,
  but also blushed at just how right the guess was.  
Beth turned her gaze to the glass. &quot;That's a full cup, 34d, brown,
    bee-bee nips, nice and hard.&quot; Beth pinched a nipple.
 
&quot;What the...!&quot; Alexandra gasped, batting Beth's hand away, and then
quickly turning her face towards the mirror and then just as quickly back. She
had heard some rumors about there being some sort of pool or betting about what
she would look like naked. But she had shrugged off those stories, seeing as
they were lawyers and all.
 
  The cane banged on the floor three times, and Alexandra shuddered with every
  one of them. The cane rose to her waist, while Beth moved back over to Santa's
  side. Alexandra wanted to slap that smirk off her face, but instead she docilely
  unbuttoned her skirt. She slid it down the cane, and it joined the pile.
 
  Alexandra could hear some laughter, and her face flushed, remembering her childish
  like panties. And yet, when the cane struck the floor four times, she didn't
  want to give them up. But she did, and they, too, were sent into the corner.
  She was left standing only in her high heeled shoes and her stocking cap, sheepishly
  waiting for a command that she just knew was coming, but prayed was not.
 
&quot;Hands behind your head, BLONDIE, and make a slow turn.&quot;
 
  Alexandra burned. She knew it was a dig at her dark pubic hair. She also knew
  that everyone knew the truth now. Beth snapped her fingers. Alexandra made
  the turn, slower this time. Her nerves were finally settling down, since she
  figured that the search was now over -- and she deduced that the crowd couldn't
  really see anything between her legs anyways. She was a little embarrassed
  about her naked ass, but everyone had always said she had a nice one. She sighed.
  She knew everyone could see for himself or herself now. She also knew the high
  heels were helping her in that area.
 
&quot;Ok, you guys had your fun, and I get the point..., really I did,&quot; Alexandra
said, as she started shuffling towards her discarded pile of clothes.
 
&quot;And, where do you think you're going?&quot; Beth asked, grabbing a handful
of Alexandra's hair, causing the blonde to screech. &quot;We ain't done yet,&quot; Beth
hissed. With a final tug, she had Alexandra back on the mat.
 
&quot;Please!&quot; Alexandra snapped. &quot;I'm cold.&quot;
 
&quot;I can see that!&quot; Beth said with a laugh, while pinching an erect nipple,
once again. &quot;We can all see that.&quot;
 
"Jesus!" Alexandra batted her hand away and crossed her arms in front of her
chest. &quot;This has gone far enough,&quot; she said, trying to sound authoritative.
 
&quot;I'm surprised at you,&quot; Beth said, shaking her head. &quot;You're supposed
to be highly educated, and yet you don't understand the meaning of 'strip-search.'
I mean, you've done the STRIP and now it's time for the SEARCH.&quot;
 
&quot;Look, I get it. It was totally humiliating for my client, and I'll never
forget it,&quot; Alexandra pleaded, in desperation, before she turned her eyes
to Santa. &quot;Please, Santa, I was a good girl this year.&quot;
 
  As soon as she said it, she regretted it, wincing at the laughter that echoed
  from the unseen audience.
 
&quot;Turn around and spread'em!&quot; Beth barked out.
 
&quot;You must be joking.... I'm not a criminal here,&quot; Alexandra said, while
striking a defensive pose. &quot;Jesus, I'm a lawyer, god-dammit!&quot;
 
&quot;It's an awful strange time to use that language, little lady,&quot; Beth
teased. &quot;Especially in front of Santa. You were, after all, saying something
about being a good girl.&quot;
 
&quot;Fuck you!&quot;
 
&quot;Owww, looks like we'll do this the hard way,&quot; Beth said, lunging forward
and grabbing Alexandra and pushing her face down on the table, again. Alexandra's
protests were interrupted by a flurry of powerful swats to her bare butt. She
tried hard to struggle free, but Beth was too strong for her. Beth pulled Alexandra's
arms behind her back.   
&quot;Handkerchief Santa,&quot; Beth said. Santa chuckled and then dug into
  his pocket and pulled out a white one.  
&quot;Spin it.&quot;  
Santa followed orders and spun it tight. Santa moved over and wrapped it
  around Alexandra's wrists. Beth took over and tied it tight.  
&quot;Hey, what the fuck!&quot; Alexandra cried out, realizing her predicament. &quot;Look,
  I never would have agreed to this. Let me go, you cunt!&quot;  
&quot;Someone needs an attitude adjustment,&quot; Beth said with huff. She
  looked at Santa. &quot;Santa, take off the gloves and help me out over here.&quot;  
Several seconds later, Alexandra felt another blow to her ass, only
    this time the hand felt rougher and struck more painfully.
 
&quot;Santa, no!&quot; Alexandra cried out. Several stinging slaps followed,
as Alexandra cried tears, more of shame than of pain.
 
&quot;Now that we have her attention, put on them rubber gloves,&quot; Beth said.
The sound of snapping rubber followed. Alexandra was sniffling, as she knew what
this meant. She wanted to offer a plea, but knew it would be futile. 
 
  She felt a hand spread an ass cheek, while Beth still had her in a waist-lock.
  Alexandra's high heels barely touched the floor. Alexandra let out a gasp as
  she felt pressure on her pussy. She realized it was a pair of fingers, slowly
  spreading her lips apart. She suddenly remembered her shaved state. She also
  wished she could go back in time and just bend over.
 
&quot;Kind of funny, guys, natural on top, yet shaved clean down below, where
it counts,&quot; Beth teased. Alexandra cringed, as it seemed like the rumors
she heard about bets on her naked body might actually be true. &quot;And stand
by her side Santa, so everyone can watch.&quot;
 
&quot;Santa...owww...Santa,&quot; Alexandra moaned, as she felt a finger slid
slowly into her pussy, maybe two.
 
&quot;I was gunna tell you to use that tube of lubricant, &quot; Beth said with
a laugh. &quot;But it doesn't look like you needed it at all, at least not yet.&quot;
 
&quot;Hey!&quot; Alexandra objected, when she felt pressure on her clitoris.
 
&quot;Ah, sorry,&quot; Beth said with a giggle. &quot;But if you stop squirming
around, I could let go of you.&quot; Alexandra tried to stop her movements, but
Santa wasn't stopping his probing, and the finger flicking her clit didn't stop
either.
 
&quot;Well Santa, it looks like she is free of contraband, and we better move
on, before she bursts,&quot; Beth said freshly, before adding, &quot;it's time
for that lubricant.&quot;
 
&quot;No way!&quot; Alexandra snapped, as she realized what Beth meant to search
next. She tried to break free, but Beth had a good hold on her. Alexandra's feet
were moving but, with a little lift, her feet weren't on the floor; they were
just running in place. Alexandra gasped, as she felt her legs being lifted and
spread apart. Looking back in horror, she saw that her knees had been placed
into two depressions at the table's edge, usually reserved for coffee cups. She
could also she her naked reflection -- and just how exposed she was, now, to
the spectators.
 
&quot;Noooo...it's cold.&quot; Alexandra whined, as she felt the drips of lubricant.
She slithered on the desk and tried to soldier crawl forward across it, but Beth's
hold on her was too effective. She also couldn't free her bound hands. The harder
she tried, the more it dug into her flesh.
 
&quot;Make sure you lube your finger, too, or fingers if you prefer,&quot; Beth
said. &quot;But, by the looks of it, her asshole matches her personality, so
you better start with just one.&quot;
 
  Alexandra didn't have time to respond to Beth's teasing words, as she felt
  a finger rubbing her asshole. Santa's finger!
 
&quot;Owww...Santa!&quot; Alexandra moaned as she felt his finger slowly twist
its way in. Slowly it moved, but always pressing deeper. She also felt more pressure
on her clit. She jerked her head around, only to see Beth staring back, hungrily,
and smiling slyly. Alexandra lowered her face to the table. She didn't want them
to see her face when, minutes later, the inevitable happened, but her body's
tremors loudly announced the fact when she climaxed. Beth's laughter drowned
out Alexandra's shameful sniffles. Alexandra crashed down on the table when Beth
finally let go, and she felt her hands being untied. She quickly used them to
dry her tears and then she took some time to try to regain her composure.   
&quot;My god! They made me cum in front of everyone.&quot;
 
  The sound of a slamming door startled Alexandra out of her trance. She opened
  her eyes and gasped. She was still lying naked on the conference table and
  not back in her bed as she had prayed. She noticed her reflection in the mirror
  -- her red, puffy, mascara-streaked face, staring back at her.
 
&quot;Oh god!&quot; she gasped, quickly remembering what was on the mirror's
other side. She jumped off the table and took a step, before freezing in horror.
 
  Her costume was gone.
 
  Alexandra looked around in a panic. She was hunting for anything to cover herself
  with, but was coming up empty. Even the place-mat was gone. Glancing at the
  glass, she figured everyone was getting a good laugh at her once again, although
  she couldn't hear anything. 
 
  She decided to make a run for it, since her boss's office was just two hallways
  away. Flinging the door open, she headed down the hall at a dead run. She turned
  the corner and ran right into portly Tom Jackson, bounced off him, and fell
  to the floor.
 
&quot;Merry Christmas, Alexandra.... Here, let me help you up. You really should
watch were you're going, running around all naked....&quot;
 
  Alexandra only vaguely heard his voice, for lining the hallway on both sides
  were her co-workers, who began cheering and clapping. Alexandra slowly got
  to her feet, cursing her high heels, her face burning. She was able to bat
  their hands away from her chest as she made her way past, but her ass received
  countless slaps and pinches, until she finally reached her boss's office.
 
  She ran into the bathroom and locked the door behind her.
 
&quot;Oh, thank god!&quot; she cried, when she spotted her clothing. She looked
in the mirror, shaking her head, wondering how she could ever face her co-workers
again. It was also killing her that she didn't have a clue who Santa really was.
She thought about suing, but she had signed that agreement. She moved to the
small shower stall and turned it on, hoping the hot water would sooth her body
and spirit. She could also feel the lubricant oozing from her asshole. 
 
  Meanwhile, Santa and Beth had said their goodbyes, and Santa was sitting in
  the janitor's room. He turned awkwardly as the door opened and the senior janitor
  walked in.
 
&quot;Oh, I'm sorry Santa, I thought you'd left for the North Pole by now.&quot;
 
&quot;Knock it off, Earl, and help me out of this fat suit.... I'm sweating my
ass off.&quot;
 
&quot;Yes, sir,&quot; Earl said, moving over to Santa and unzipping the back
of his costume. Santa stepped out of the jumpsuit and then with some help, the
fat suit.
 
&quot;Wow, that feels better, and now I have to get this beard off and these
contacts out.&quot;
 
&quot;Contacts, Sir?&quot;
 
&quot;Yeah, colored contacts.&quot;
 
&quot;Nice touch, sir.&quot;
 
&quot;Earl, you've worked here for thirty years, how many times do I have to
tell you to call me Ben, when we're alone?&quot;
 
&quot;Sorry, Mr. Davis...I mean, Ben.&quot;
 
&quot;Hey, Earl, give me some of that eggnog. I need something to cool down.&quot;
 
&quot;I bet you do, sir.&quot; Earl went over to the little fridg and poured
two glasses. When he returned, his boss was sitting in his underwear watching
a color monitor. (Can this day get any weirder? Earl thought.) He sat down and
slid a glass over.
 
&quot;Picture comes in good,&quot; Ben said, pointing to the screen.
 
&quot;Yeah, it does,&quot; Earl said, leaning closer to the screen. &quot;Who
would have thought she was hiding that bod, under her stuffy clothes?&quot;
 
&quot;Yeah, I was pleasantly surprised,&quot; Ben said, with a chuckle. &quot;I
loved her hard nipples.... By the way, who won the pool?&quot;
 
&quot;Oh, fucking Peterson,&quot; Earl said, shaking his head.
 
&quot;Peterson, well that figures, he's been undressing her with his eyes for
years,&quot; Ben grinned. &quot;She shaved around her pussy, who would have thought?&quot;
 
&quot;I know, ten bucks it was her husbands idea, but it gave us all a good view.
We could even see some pink...well, at least in the front row,&quot; Earl said,
playing it back in his head. &quot;And thanks for the seat up front, I couldn't
have afforded....&quot;
 
&quot;Don't mention it. Merry Christmas Earl. It all went to the food bank, anyway,
but I'm surprised at just how much some of the front row seats went for, and
at just how much it cost ME to be Santa.&quot;
 
&quot;I guess some guys really wanted to know what she looked like in her birthday
suit.&quot;
 
&quot;I guess, and it was probably their only hope. But then again, if she had
just done what she should have, they never would have known. She thought the
guys chased her before!&quot;
 
&quot;Think she'll be back on Monday?&quot; Earl said, pouring some brandy from
his flask.
 
&quot;If she has what it takes, she will. Remember, Victoria did, even after....
Hey, I'm in the mood for some cheer, too.&quot; Ben held up his glass. &quot;Plus
I need some liquid courage tonight, 'cause I'll soon have to go home to the old
lady. But at least I'll have Alexandra's back side view on my brain, as well
as the feel of her tight asshole gripping my finger...ummm.&quot;
 
&quot;I think she liked that.... She was flopping around like a fish out of water.
Too bad there is no tape of her search, though.&quot;
 
&quot;Yeah, but I gave my word...and it's in writing.&quot;
 
&quot;But you didn't say anything about the hidden cameras in your bathroom,
now did yah?&quot;
 
&quot;Must have slipped my mind. But it shouldn't have slipped hers. I didn't
know if she'd shower or not, but I was hoping. I also skipped the clean up part
at the end...ah, her end.&quot;
 
  The old janitor chuckled. &quot;How much moola do you think this shower tape
  and the one of her stripping out of her fancy suit earlier is gunna fetch for
  the food bank?&quot;
 
&quot;Earl, I wouldn't dream....&quot;
 
&quot;Of course not,&quot; Earl said, with a snicker, while also a little disappointed
that Alexandra had now turned off the shower.   
&quot;And I'm sure you wouldn't try and blackmail her with it and try and
  get some of that, eh.&quot;  
&quot;Earl, I'm shocked...then again you've seen my wife...so....&quot;  
&quot;And we're not getting any younger.&quot;  
&quot;True, but Earl I'd never....&quot;  
Earl chuckled, "I know boss." (But he knew that's exactly what he
    did to Victoria last year.) He wondered if he'd get the two of them together.
    His face light up. "And what was with that lezbo guard?&quot;
 
&quot;She was good, eh? Played her role to the T.&quot; Ben said proudly, while
sitting back in his chair as Alexandra stepped out of the shower. &quot;But she
isn't a guard...and she isn't a lesbian. She's married, in fact. She just looked
the part.&quot;
 
&quot;What?&quot;
 
&quot;Yeah, I didn't want someone who could lose their job over this. Her name
is Beth, though.&quot;
 
&quot;Sorry, but I'm not as schooled as you.&quot;
 
&quot;I found her at the food bank, where Alexandra was supposed to spend some
time there volunteering; and then had the gall to tell me that she did, when
she didn't. When I told all this to Beth, and what I wanted from her, she was
shocked, but she has a couple of kids, and a few dead presidents sweetened the
deal.&quot;
 
&quot;I don't think that food bank would survive without you.&quot;
 
&quot;Well, let's just say it's good to give back to those less fortunate, you
know, especially around the holidays.&quot;
 
&quot;Ah huh, and it's also good for the firm's PR.&quot;
 
&quot;See Earl, you're smarter than you think,&quot; Ben said, with a raised
glass. &quot;Even Stewart finds the time.... And speaking of Stew..., how long
before he realized that no one was coming in to search him?&quot;
 
&quot;Oh, Stewmantha,&quot; Earl said, laughing. &quot;I think he joined the
party, ah, made it in 'bout the time big boobs' panties hit the floor. He was
even still wearing that skirt, though. Nice touch.&quot;
 
&quot;It was the best I could come up with, after everyone told me they wanted
to watch Alexandra's search, instead, even Victoria. Hey, I couldn't let him
off the hook, totally. After all, he lost that case, too.&quot;
 
&quot;Ah huh, and I guess your record is safe, eh?&quot;
 
&quot;Earl, what are you trying to say?&quot;
 
&quot;Funny, all of your lawyers seem to lose at least one case.&quot;
 
&quot;Jesus, Earl, you think I had something to do with it?&quot;
 
&quot;Of course not,&quot; Earl said, smirking.
 
&quot;Right. I wouldn't do that to a client.&quot;
 
&quot;Even, one who, the evidence strongly indicates, certainly had a lot to
do with planning her husband's murder, even if she might not have actually pulled
the trigger herself,'&quot; Earl said. &quot;That's pretty close to a direct
quote of what you told me late one night during the trial.&quot;
 
  Ben's eye's widened.
 
&quot;No...,&quot; Earl went on. &quot;Not even if you do have some friends at
the Woman's State Prison, who I'm sure took it easy on her...I mean, they probably
get lookers like her, every day.&quot;
 
&quot;Oh my god!&quot; Ben gasped, and dropped his head into his hand.
 
&quot;And what were the chances that you learned the strip-search procedures
that you used today, from watching them process her, from behind the glass...hum,
sound familiar?&quot;
 
&quot;Jesus, I have to stop drinking with the help!&quot; Ben said, pushing the
flask aside. &quot;Look Earl, if those words left my lips, they were not meant
to be repeated, so I strongly suggest you forget them.&quot;
 
&quot;Gee, Ben, awful defensive for an innocent man.&quot;
 
&quot;Ok, Earl, I'll give it to you straight. I knew from the beginning that
it was going to be a tough case, and that's why I put Alexandra on it in the
first place, and I gave her Stewart, too, so she still had a fighting chance.
Things were going well too, and we were winning. Then, more than half-way through,
I discovered a bushel of damning evidence -- and none of it admissible. So, there
was a very good chance that a murderess was going to get off....&quot;
 
&quot;And then, from nowhere comes that...that fortuitous witness, who knew just
what to say,&quot; Earl interjected.
 
&quot;We call it 'being well-prepped.' And yeah, Stew and Alexandra got blind-sided,&quot; Ben
said, watching Alexandra leaving his office on the monitor. &quot;But it all
worked out in the end. Think about it, a husband-killer got sent to jail. We
all got a chance to see Alexandra au naturel, and watch Santa check her oil...while
Stewart got to eat some humble pie. I call that...JUSTICE.&quot;
 
  Ben lowered his voice. &quot;And she may have been a 'fortunate' witness, from
  the standpoint of justice, but she was not necessarily 'fortuitous.' He had
  a twinkle in his eye.
 
&quot;'Fortunate'...'fortuitous'.... What's the difference?&quot;
 
&quot;I gave you a dictionary twenty years ago. Look it up,&quot; Ben said, laying
a finger beside his nose.
 
&quot;Wow...lawyers!"   
"Anyways, Earl, just never repeat my words again."  
"Don't worry boss, your secrets are always safe with me."  
"Good."  
"Of course, I have one small request."  
"Earl, don't get any ideas. Our friendship has its limits."  
"I just want to be Santa next year, that's all."  
Ben laughed. "Yeah, I bet. It was a blast."  
"It looked it, but next year I want to be on the other side of the glass,
  for once."  
"I see, nice metaphor, but you didn't happen to spot the new redhead I just
  hired, did you?"  
"Redhead?" Earl shrugged and then laughed.  
"I should have known...you see everything around here."  
"Me sir, I'm just the lonely old janitor."  
Ben burned but he knew it was the truth. "I'll see what I can do, just don't
  do anything foolish. Just wait until they mess up...they always do."  
Earl smiled. "Well, Alexandra sure dressed quickly, not like the slow
    way you stripped her.... And to think, this all happened because she didn't
    want to spread the cheer.&quot;
 
&quot;Well, Earl, isn't that what Christmas is all about...spreading good cheer?&quot;
 
&quot;THAT'S NOT ALL YOU SPREAD THIS YEAR!&quot;
 
&quot;Ho-Ho-Ho! Merry Christmas!&quot;
