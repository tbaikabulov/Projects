1. 
It had all begun with an invitation to the annual summer charity ball. Being
  an ambitious young attorney and recently arrived, Judith Jackson had been thrilled
  at the chance to make such an important set of acquaintances. Her firm handled
  estate and tax work and was very talented at it. They were also relatively
  new though. The fact that a girl fresh out of law school had even been asked
  to the event surprised not only her but the three senior partners of her firm
  as well. 
The moment she'd received that invitation, a secret hope had sprung up in
  Judith. If she could woo some of the old money in town away from their more
  established competitors she might be offered a junior partnership. 
The hostess for the event was Mrs. Dawes-Smith, wealthy widow of the recently
  late Harold Andrew Smith III and the city's uncontested social dragon. It was
  this woman whom Judith most hoped to meet and impress. 
At the ball Mrs. Dawes-Smith had been first in the receiving line. Judith
  had expected a dowager type but the woman was younger than she had thought
  and completely gorgeous. Her gown, which Judith later learned had come from
  Guesquiere himself, was a deep wine red set off by an understated ensemble
  of diamonds and rubies. Stunning as they were, the dress and jewels were a
  mere setting for the beauty of the woman herself. 
Judith's carefully rehearsed charm and wit deserted her as she took the cool
  and beautifully manicured hand offered her. She did manage to get out an introduction
  and a thank you for her invitation. For this she received a brilliant smile
  and a brief squeeze before the lovely hand left her and the deep green eyes
  moved on to the person behind her. 
She did her best to mix and mingle and did meet and exchange casual promises
  of further contact with a number of people she thought might prove worth knowing.
  At no time during the evening, however, did the charmed circle surrounding
  the hostess drift near enough to include her. Judith knew that the last thing
  she must do was appear pushy. She left feeling disappointed but with a faint
  hope that she'd made a good enough impression to be included on other �A' lists
  down the road. 
The following Monday a note was hand delivered to her office by messenger.
  A cream colored envelope complete with a red wax seal. Inside, on a crested
  sheet of the same heavy bond, was an invitation to luncheon the following Saturday.
  It was signed by Emily Dawes-Smith. 
Thunderstruck might have come close to describing Judith's reaction. Throughout
  the following week the invitation intruded constantly on her thoughts. Two
  futile evenings of going through her wardrobe had landed her at the city's
  most exclusive boutique where she almost drove the saleswoman to distraction
  with her indecision. She did not wish to show up over dressed but then being
  too casual could be dangerous also. 
At last she settled on a silk blouse in sunny yellow and a pants suit of cream
  linen above a pair of lemon and lime espadrilles. 
She spent Friday evening at a spa being done from head to toes. There were
  moments when she felt foolish over her obsessive behavior. It was a luncheon
  for God's sake and here she was preparing for a royal presentation. Still,
  she knew instinctively that she was going to be judged and being accepted into
  such a set could make all the difference to her future. It never occurred to
  her that the woman she was taking such pains to impress might have an agenda
  of her own. 
2. 
&nbsp; 
Saturday dawned at last. A perfect summer day and traffic was light. There
  was no sign announcing River Oaks. One recognized the trappings of wealth immediately.
  The stately homes were set back, many behind stone walls with tall, wrought
  iron gates. Just driving along the wide ivy and oak lined streets and knowing
  that she was there by invitation thrilled Judith. 
She slowed before a drive where a pair of granite posts held aloft a filigreed
  arch bearing a weathered green plaque engraved simply �Smith'. The gate was
  standing open and after the briefest pause to collect her wits, Judith drove
  through. 
The drive wound its way up to a circle that passed under the portico of a
  Georgian Mansion . She was met by a silver haired black man wearing a white
  jacketed uniform. He opened the car door for her. 
�Mistress is expecting you. This way if you please, Miss.� 
His accent had an island flavor, Jamaican perhaps, she mused as she followed
  him into a cool, high-ceilinged hall. He did not pause but led her from one
  opulent room to another until, at last, he ushered her outside again through
  a set of French doors which he closed behind her. 
Taking in the terraced garden leading to a swimming pool, Judith thought she
  had been left alone until she noticed the long, tan form stretched out in a
  low chaise lounge facing away from her. So much for all of her second guessing
  about what to wear, Emily Dawes-Smith had decided to receive her wearing nothing
  more than a pair of sunglasses. 
�Well, don't just stand there. Join me, please. Blackjack is bringing you
  a drink.� 
When she reached her hostess she held out a hand in greeting but it was used
  it to pull her down onto an adjacent chaise and kept hold of. While trying
  to find an appropriate place for her eyes, she began making her �Thank you
  for having me �speech but she was cut off. 
�Just call me Em and you are more than welcome here. Let's not be formal,
  Judy. As you can see I am not dressed for it.� 
Her laugh was rich and throaty. As she flashed a great smile at Judith from
  behind a pair of very dark Versace lenses, Judith became aware that her hand
  was still being held. She was searching for a reply when a bottle of coca oil
  was thrust at her. 
�It is time for me to flip over. Be a dear, Judy and oil me up won't you?� 
She was already turning so there was no tactful way to refuse her. Judith
  pushed up her sleeves and unscrewed the cap. 
�Oh wait! I would never forgive myself if you got oil on such a lovely new
  outfit.� 
New outfit? God, this woman had seen right through her. Judith thought she
  must seem like a complete bumpkin. 
�Just take off your things and drape them on the table. Blackjack will put
  them on hangers for you.� 
�But I�� 
�Oh, don't mind Blackjack. He sees nothing. Don't be shy now. After all, you
  are a bit over dressed. You would not want to have me feeling uncomfortable
  in my own home, I'm sure.� 
Again the warm laughter. Once more there was no way out without appearing
  to be some provincial little prude. 
�Sure. Great idea.� Judith finally said. 
Hoping it seemed as though baring her body before a stranger and her manservant
  was an everyday occurrence, she shrugged out of her jacket and followed it
  with the rest of her clothes as quickly and gracefully as possible. 
Emily watched with amusement as the girl struggled to hide her modesty behind
  a casual front. She did so enjoy manipulating others. Smiling at how well her
  little seduction was going, she turned her face away and lay there loosely,
  basking in her anticipation of the girl's hands on her hungry body. 
Judith was bent down, just stepping out of the white thong she had chosen,
  when Blackjack reappeared with a tall frosted drink in hand. He wore the same
  pleasant expression as when he had escorted her in. Clearly this was nothing
  out of the ordinary in his eyes. 
Without a word Blackjack carefully gathered up her garments and shoes and
  walked off with them. Judith suddenly realized that she was trapped without
  a stitch until such time as her hostess chose to tell her where her clothes
  had gone. Blushing in spite of her best efforts at nonchalance, she took up
  the oil and settled herself down alongside her new friend's sun bronzed back. 
Emily felt the warm drizzle down her spine followed by the brush of Judith's
  hesitant fingers as they smoothed the slick substance over her. 
�Be a darling, Judy, and rub it in deeper. You may as well give me a little
  massage while you are at it.� 
The whole situation was growing bizarre to Judith's mind. She was beginning
  to feel more like a handmaiden than a luncheon guest. Shrugging aside her doubts,
  she bore down with her fingers and began working the oil into the woman's undeniably
  attractive skin. As she started to knead Emily's well toned shoulders the woman
  made no attempt to stifle her moan of pleasure. 
�Oh God, Judy, that feels delicious. I think I shall keep you at it until
  lunch is served� You wouldn't mind, would you?� 
�No� If it pleases you, I don't mind, Em.� 
Judith was thinking she must sound like a total suck up but in truth the feel
  of the woman's body under her hands was not unpleasant. She had never thought
  of another woman in sexual terms but being nude together under the warm sun
  and hearing the soft sighs of pleasure that her hands were bringing forth was
  somewhat sensual. 
By the time she made her way to Emily's lower back muscles she was not overly
  bothered by her impromptu role as a masseuse. 
�Do my ass, Judy.� Emily said casually. �I love having my ass massaged. I
  must take you with me to my spa some day as my treat. The girls there are fabulous
  at massage.� 
There it was, thought Judith. �I must take you with me some day'�the promise
  of acceptance. With those words in her ears she compliantly moved her hands
  down to squeeze the firm globes of Emily's ass. 
With a louder groan Emily spread her legs to allow the girl's hands a free
  play. Corrupting these bright and accomplished young women was always so arousing.
  She had singled out this attractive lawyer girl from several candidates she
  had invited to her annual fundraiser. Just another little whore at heart, she
  thought contentedly as she gave herself over to the sensations she was enjoying. 
Judith could not miss the shift of the legs under her gaze. Emily's darkish
  pucker was revealed to her along with the flowery lips below in their nest
  of glistened fur. She began to feel a bit over heated as she worked her way
  down to the gleaming thighs. She studiously avoided any contact that might
  seem too intimate. 
�Mmm. So good, Judy. You have me feeling all hot and randy now. Give me a
  little cum to ease things, dear.� 
�I'm sorry, Em...I don't understand�� 
Judith was truly wondering if she had just heard Emily correctly. 
�Oh don't be a priss. Just dip your fingers in my quim and frig me a bit.
  It will be our little secret. Do yourself at the same time and we'll both have
  a little afternoon delight, darling. � 
The words hung there while Judith's mind raced. She knew she was being seduced.
  Perhaps used even. But then beauty, wealth and power�everything this woman
  had was seductive. And what was her alternative? She could cry foul, demand
  her clothing and leave in a huff. Remain the morally upright little lawyer
  who had alienated herself from a rich future. That was if Emily even decided
  to allow her to have a practice after such a scene. Judith knew that it was
  no longer a good impression that was at stake. It was survival itself. 
All this passed through her head in seconds and her decision was to slowly
  slide her hands up the inside of those wide spread thighs. 
Unseen by Judith, Emily smiled as she felt the fingers slide hesitantly into
  her slick pussy. She had won again. With her eyes closed she began to slowly
  grind her mound onto the towel beneath her, sucking Judith's fingers deeper
  into herself as she did so. 
�Now reach down and do yourself for me too, Judy. Cum with me, baby.� 
The hot perfumed air of the garden was heavy with silence. Judith could hear
  clearly the squish squish sound her fingers were making in both of their holes.
  She saw the two of them from outside herself and the very decadence of the
  vision grew a greater heat within her. When Emily at last let out a short cry
  of victory, it acted as a trigger and Judith's own head rocked back in open
  mouthed ecstasy. 
When she regained her senses, her eyes focused and she saw that Blackjack
  was back, standing a few feet away in his immaculate white jacket. 
�Luncheon is served, Ladies.� 
3. 
&nbsp; 
Judith sat; hunched over and more than a bit ashamed of what she had just
  participated in. Emily however, merely stood and stretched luxuriously. Judith
  caught herself staring. She had always felt she had a pleasing figure but alongside
  Emily's spectacular body she suddenly felt inadequate. 
�Your talented little fingers have made me ravenous. Come along. We'll eat
  inside where it is cool.� 
Judith followed her inside to a dayroom and a table by a large window looking
  out on the terrace. They had obviously been in plain view while Blackjack had
  been setting the table. A table that was set for three, Judith noticed. She
  had to wonder if her eccentric hostess was going to have the manservant sit
  down with them. 
Blackjack was holding a chair and at a gesture from Emily, Judith allowed
  him to seat her. He then moved to a settee and retrieved a long silk robe which
  he held open. Emily slipped into it, belted it and then took the seat opposite
  Judith. 
Judith felt her cheeks flush with the realization that she was purposely being
  left nude. Perhaps, she thought, if she complained of the room's air conditioning
  her clothes would be brought. Before she could utter the request she was startled
  speechless when a stunning redhead strode into the room smiling broadly. The
  woman was wearing a smart summer outfit similar to the one Judith should have
  had on. It took every ounce of her will to keep from covering her bareness
  as best she could and bolting from the room. 
�Ah, there you are, Sophia! I was beginning to doubt you were coming. This
  is my new friend, Judy.� 
�You know me, Em, always fashionably late. Hello, Judy.� 
Judith managed to choke out a hello in return while trying to cover herself
  a bit without her distress appearing obvious. 
�Sophia has just returned from Rome , Judy. Sit down and tell us all about
  your adventures, darling.� 
Sophia launched into an account of her shopping spree along the exclusive
  Via Condotti. Emily appeared to be listening raptly while Blackjack quietly
  circled the table pouring wine. It was completely surreal. Instead of the delightful
  visit she had envisioned, Judith was living through a waking nightmare. 
Angry and embarrassed at being forced to remain nude before yet another stranger,
  her only escape was to withdraw into a helpless funk. When a plate was placed
  before her, Judith gratefully concentrated on her food, using her knife and
  fork tightly in front of her to hide her traitorous nipples as best she could.
  She had become all too aware that her exposed feeling, coupled with the chill
  of the room, had made them hard as bullets. All week long Judith had been hoping
  to appear self-assured and worthy of attention but her poise had disappeared
  with her clothing. Now, naked and insecure, she was only too happy that she
  was seemingly being ignored. 
4. 
&nbsp; 
Emily had been quietly digesting every moment of the torture she was inflicting
  on Judith. Out of the corner of her eye she had observed the young lawyer shrinking
  into herself. She had looked into Judith's background before selecting her.
  She knew the girl was bright, competent and ambitious. It was that very ambition
  that she had made her accomplice in destroying whatever self-confidence Judith
  had arrived with. It had been almost disappointingly easy. 
The girl's longish and very erect nipples had not escaped her eye. She decided
  it was time for the third act of the little play she had so carefully scripted. 
�Doesn't that deserve a thank you, Judy?� she asked sharply, jerking her victim
  back into awareness. 
Judith was forced to look up. 
�I'm sorry. My mind must have been wandering, Em.� 
�Really? I am sorry if we are boring you.� 
�Nno. It just that the sorbet was so delicious...� Judith stammered out the
  polite lie. 
�Well, we forgive you. Sophia was just complimenting your nipples. Hers are
  inverted and I think she is jealous of your long teats.� Emily chuckled. 
Judith reddened under the other two women's obvious focus on her exposed body. 
Sophia knew she had said no such thing but she understood her part in this
  little set piece of Emily's and she came in on cue. 
�Guilty. I admit I'm envious as hell. Sit up, Judy, don't be so modest. If
  I had those I'd want to show them off.� 
Thinking she should have her head examined, Judith, straightened somewhat.
  She was furious to feel her blush deepening further. 
�Oh my.� Sophia observed, �You must have been out in the sun. Your poor boobies
  have gotten a bit burned.� 
�I'm afraid that is my fault, Sophia. I should not have had her out there
  without any sun blocker. Blackjack! Fetch some Aloe Vera for Judy's burnt boobies.� 
�No really�I'm fine, Em.� Judith demurred. 
�Nonsense! I will feel guilty if you blister.� 
She was still protesting when a gasp was forced from her as her breasts were
  cupped from behind. Looking down she saw a pair of large dark hands that could
  only belong to the ever obedient Blackjack. The hands began to massage a soothing
  lotion into her breasts. Judith had reached her breaking point. 
�Tell him to take his hands off of me. � she blurted. 
�Oh for pity's sake, don't act as though you are being molested, Judy! Blackjack
  might as well be a eunuch. In my home no one does anything for themselves.
  That is what servants are for.� 
Emily winked at Sophia to signal her amusement at Judith's discomfit and then
  gave her a slight nod. Sophia rose and went to Judith comfortingly. 
�Poor girl, she is just not used to all of this.� Sophia filled her voice
  with concern. �To you he is a servant but to Judy he is a strange male. Send
  him away, Em.� 
Judith relaxed somewhat. At last someone seemed to be in tune with her feelings.
  The big hands disappeared from her chest only to be replaced with more lotion
  and the light stroking of Sophia's fingers. Judith tensed again initially but
  found herself easing up under Sophia's soft words and softer hands. 
�There...see � he is gone. No need to be embarrassed now. I will doctor you
  all up my self.� Sophia said soothingly. 
�Earlier Judy gave me a relaxing massage, Sophia. I think she might feel a
  bit looser if you did the same for her.� 
Judith knew that she should just politely request her clothes and make the
  most graceful departure she could manage but the soothing fingers had moved
  to her temples and she felt her eyes closing. 
Emily smiled as she observed the young woman's eyelids lower and her body
  slump into resigned relaxation. The sorbet had indeed been exquisite but as
  far as Emily was concerned the afternoon's dessert was only just being served.
  She waved her hand and Blackjack silently cleared and lifted away the table
  leaving Emily with an unobstructed view of the oblivious Judith. 
Sophia was humming what was almost a lullaby as she applied more scented lotion
  to her magic hands and eased the tension from Judith's neck and shoulders. 
�You are right, Sophia. Her nipples are amazing.� 
Emily observed slyly. �I am curious as to how long they become when fully
  aroused.� 
Judith's eyes flew open as Sophia's hands slid down to her breasts. She felt
  the fingers capture her nipples and begin to gently milk them. She covered
  Sophia's hands with her own and pulled weakly at them but to no avail. With
  a sigh she lowered her arms and surrendered to the sweet sensation spreading
  through her. She watched helplessly as Emily rose and moved forward. The woman
  placed a hand on each of her knees and lowered herself onto her haunches in
  front of her. 
�That's better, Judy. Stop fighting it. You mustn't feel guilty about your
  body's response to pleasure.� 
�You're right.� Judith said weakly. �It does feel good�and I did not mind
  being nice to you outside but I'm sorry� this is just not my thing. Other women,
  I mean.� 
�No? Sophia, lean over and suck on one of those buds you have teased up so
  nicely.� 
Judith could not repress a shiver as the moist heat of Sophia's mouth closed
  over her right nipple. With her eyes held helplessly by Emily's, she felt her
  self being spread by the hands at her knees. She knew her arousal had to be
  clearly visible. 
�You say that this is not your thing but I can smell you, Judy.� 
Unable to refute the testimony of her own body, she could only look back at
  Emily in silence. Sophia's mouth at her breast had been making her moist but
  the feeling of Emily's hands inching their way up her inner thighs started
  a veritable flow. 
Emily let her fingers trace up the length of Judith's flowering sex and watched
  the young woman's belly quiver in response. She then pinched each slippery
  lip and drew them apart to reveal a slick coral interior before pushing them
  wetly together again. She repeated this rapidly and smiled at the sound. 
�You say this is not your thing� but just listen.� 
Defeated by her desire, Judith could only moan in response. Through half closed
  eyes she watched as Emily leaned in toward her aching pussy. Emily used her
  thumb to peel back the engorged hood and fully expose Judith's swollen clit.
  She blew softly on it. 
�Yes.� Judith gasped. 
Emily raised her head in satisfaction. 
�Yes? Yes what?� she demanded. 
�Yes, it feels good.� Judith hissed. 
�How good?� 
�Very good. Please...� 
�Please what? Sophia, that's enough! Answer me, Judy. Do you want to cum?� 
Judith groaned in frustration as the sucking lips released her and the chilled
  air attacked her saliva soaked nipple. 
�No�I mean, yes. Yes I need to cum!� 
�Then ask nicely.� 
�Please may I cum.� 
�Louder! 
�PLEASE MAKE ME CUM, EM!� 
Emily stood up, smiling broadly. She turned her back on Judith and moved to
  the settee. 
�Blackjack, bring Miss Judy's clothes to her. She's ready to leave now. I
  am so glad you could join us today, Judy. Blackjack will show you out once
  you have dressed.� 
Emily smiled momentarily at the young lawyer's amazed expression and then
  ignored her. 
�Come over here with me, Sophia. We have so much to catch up on.� She said,
  patting the cushion beside her. 
By the time Judith reached the safety of her car she was sobbing. She had
  only barely managed to hold back her tears of anger and embarrassment long
  enough to get out the front door. 
Instead of being shown to a guest room, her clothes, beginning with her thong,
  had been handed to her item by item. She had been forced to dress there in
  the dayroom before an expressionless Blackjack while that bitch and her friend
  chatted away as if she had ceased to exist. 
�What na&iuml;ve damn fool I am.� She muttered with self-loathing. 
She had obviously been invited as nothing more than an afternoon's cruel sport.
  How they must be laughing now, she thought bitterly. 
The Rich homes that had seemed so welcoming hours before were now monuments
  of scorn and she drove away from them as quickly as her welling eyes would
  allow. 
5. 
Judith had spent the day following her ordeal in a listless daze. On Monday
  morning she retreated into the welter of complex new tax laws in a desperate
  attempt to put any memory of the whole business behind her. 
Throughout the previous week Judith had been so full of herself that she had
  been unable to resist letting it be known within the firm that she would be
  lunching with Mrs. Dawes-Smith over the weekend. By hiding in her office she
  hoped to avoid any curiosity her name dropping might have aroused. Her attention
  was pulled up by the intrusion of one of the secretaries. 
�Mr. Geller would like to see you in his office.� 
She had not seen the inside of that office since having been taken there for
  an introduction on her first day. There could only be one reason for the head
  cheddar wanting to see her now. 
When she entered he looked up with a warm smile and rose to greet her. He
  seated her in a plush leather chair before retreating behind a massive teakwood
  desk. 
�Join me for a taste of single malt, Judith? It's past five.� 
�No thank you, sir. I still have a bit of work to get through yet.� 
�The hours you have been putting in have been noticed. The other partners
  and I are pleased.� 
He poured himself a good measure and held the amber liquid up to admire before
  taking a good sized swallow. 
�Great stuff!� 
�I'll make it a point to try some, sir.� 
�Judith, I won't tiptoe around this� One of the powers that be in this city
  has taken a shine to you. I had a call from Mrs. Dawes-Smith today. It seems
  that she is quite impressed. 
Judith had been about to downplay her connection with the woman and hope she
  could make a quick escape. This new development took her completely by surprise
  and made her instantly wary. 
�I don't know if you are fully aware of what this could mean to the firm.
  This woman inherited massive wealth from her late husband. Not only would her
  business be a huge plum�but where she goes others follow. I am talking about
  millions in fees here, Judith.� 
Judith fought desperately to maintain a poised and assured countenance. What
  he was describing was far greater than the boost to her career she had first
  envisioned. She did not feel elated though. She felt trapped. The bitch had
  neatly penned her between whatever further cruel game she had in mind and the
  great expectations that had now been engendered in Geller's head. 
�Very wealthy and powerful people can be�well, let's just say eccentric. If
  you should feel you need any advice my door is always open. You are young,
  Judith. I would hate to see over-confidence trip you up here.� 
If only he had a clue, she thought miserably. Over-confidence, hell! Judith
  was scared silly. She heard little else that was said to her and was lost in
  thought all the way back to her own office. 
What would be expected of her now, she wondered. The woman had obviously decided
  that she was nothing but a weak, greedy little harlot for hire. Who could blame
  her after the way she had allowed herself to be used. 
What was really worrying Judith now was what the woman wanted with her. With
  the looks and money Emily Dawes-Smith had she could have her pick. Of women
  or men. Hell the woman could have a lesbian harem if she chose. It had been
  obvious that even someone as wealthy as Sophia was at her beck and call. 
All the way to her apartment two words echoed repeatedly through Judith's
  head, 
�Why me?� 
At home she had no expensive scotch to admire and suck down but she did have
  vodka. She doctored some cranberry juice stiffly and took it with her to the
  bath. With the light out and a damp washcloth over her eyes she soaked and
  sipped, willing her head to remain empty. 
She heard the phone ring in the bedroom but left it to the machine. From the
  dark of her damp cocoon, Judith listened. 
�Judy, darling, it's Em. Call me as soon as you get in. I'm in the book.� 
No apology. No explanation. Just the irony of �Judy, darling' and another
  arrogant demand... Judith sighed and took a deep sip. 
There was no choice but to make the call. It was answered on the third ring
  by the island accent she remembered all too well. She was not surprised when
  she was made to wait before Emily came on the line. 
�You're home so late, darling. That nasty Geller must treat you like a slave.� 
�I enjoy my work.� 
Judith could not hide the terseness of her reply but if Emily noticed, she
  ignored it. 
�And I am sure you are very good at it. After all you made the law review.
  The only woman in your graduating class to do so. Very impressive but this
  is a social call�Our bridge club meets this coming Friday evening.� 
Judith had been listening warily but now relief washed over her. 
�I would be thrilled,� she lied, �but I know literally nothing about bridge.
  I am sorry, Em.� 
�That won't matter a whit. I'll send the car for you at seven.� 
�Thank you but�� 
The line went dead. She had been dismissed. 
�Fuck!� 
Judith hurled the phone and watched it shatter against the far wall. She stalked
  her room then, cursing. She swore she would do pro bono work for legal aid
  and starve before she would place herself at that bitch's mercy again. Once
  her fury had drained she sank slackly onto the bed. 
She knew she was kidding herself. She was a slave to her ambition. It was
  what had driven her to excel all her young life. In athletics. In her studies.
  She had always been a leader. She hated feeling like a slut on this woman's
  string. Judith found herself weeping in frustration and hating herself for
  her weakness. She finally fell into exhausted sleep 
6. 
&nbsp; 
Friday evening at seven sharp her intercom buzzed. Even through the metallic
  speaker the voice was unmistakable. Politely, Blackjack informed her that he
  had been sent for her. 
The rear compartment of the Mercedes limousine was shielded from the driver
  by a partition. Judith stared at her reflection in the black glass as she was
  ferried to her fate in isolated splendor. The limo had everything from a bar
  to a DVD screen. She would have felt like a queen save for the knot of apprehension
  that had been growing in her belly over the last few days. The gentle music
  and soft leather did little to relax her churning thoughts. 
�Get a grip on yourself, girl.� She thought aloud. 
She must find some way to convince this bored bitch of a woman that she would
  be far more valuable as a tax guru than as a minor amusement. Once this Dawes-Smith
  woman understood how much money Judith could save her she would forget all
  about this game she was playing. She had just begun to take some of comfort
  from this bit of logic when the DVD player lit up. 
Moments later she was watching the whole scene she had lived through at Emily's
  luncheon. There she was� not only butt naked but with swollen nipples and gaping
  thighs. By the time she heard her own voice loudly begging to cum Judith knew
  that no amount of logic was going to solve her problem. If she was to survive
  this it was imperative that she toughen up. 
She felt the car glide to a standstill and sensed that she had arrived. The
  door opened for her and instead of the ever present Blackjack she was greeted
  by the bitch herself. Naturally Emily was wearing a beautiful smile which Judith
  was forced to return. 
�You look lovely, Judy. I am so pleased you decided to join us.� 
�Well, after the little talk you had with my boss� I could scarcely refuse
  any invitation from you. And of course you sent the car.� 
Emily loved the thinly disguised irony behind the young lawyer's words. It
  seemed that there was still a bit of pride that needed peeling. She was quite
  confident that the coming evening would see an end to that. 
�Our little clubhouse is quite remote. I doubted you would find it alone.
  As for the other�well, you won't be playing bridge tonight but if you play
  the other cards you will be offered correctly� your Mr. Geller will be kissing
  the ground you walk on.� 
There it was�.the big, juicy carrot. All that remained was a look at the nasty
  stick behind it, Judith thought. 
�You made a movie of me, Emily. Is this some form of blackmail?� 
Emily threw her head back and laughed delightedly. 
�Heavens no, silly girl! That was for my own entertainment and as insurance
  that you won't take a hare brained notion to reveal what you will learn this
  evening.� 
�Just what am I going to learn?� 
�To begin with you will see that none of the ladies are here for cards. Our
  bridge club is a useful fiction we invented. Unlike my self, some of the married
  ladies need an excuse for their monthly escape. Come along, the girls will
  be serving dinner soon.� 
Inside the �little clubhouse' Emily had so lightly referred to, Judith found
  a vaulted foyer at the foot of a massive stairway. Italian marble glowed under
  a brilliant crystal chandelier. 
A beautiful raven haired woman met them as they entered. Judith had to force
  her startled mouth to close. The woman was nude save for a silver choker. 
�This is V. Give her your wrap, Judy.� 
As the girl disappeared with her jacket, a heavy door of carved walnut slid
  open and was held for them by yet another nude young woman. This one also attractive
  but with short blonde hair. 
Judith followed Emily into a ballroom every bit as elegant as the foyer had
  hinted at. There were half a dozen tables under damask set with crystal and
  heavy silver. At the far end of the long room a large collection of elegantly
  dressed ladies of varying ages were chatting in scattered groups. Moving among
  them were just as many women serving cocktails and hors d'oeuvres, all were
  wearing nothing but identical silver chokers. 
Their entrance had been well noted. There were smiles and a flutter of hands
  directed at Emily, while Judith received several appraising glances and more
  than a few outright stares. Emily smiled and waved at the room in general and
  then pulled Judith down to an antique sofa in an empty corner. 
As she studied Emily's friends, Judith could not help but notice that their
  hands were very free with the women serving them. Almost casually, nipples
  were tweaked and buttocks were squeezed, often to the accompaniment of coarse
  remarks and laughter. 
�I know what you are thinking, Judy. That we are a depraved bunch of arrogant
  bitches. And of course you are right� but you see�we can afford to be. All
  of us are swimming in idle wealth and we need these monthly interludes to make
  our lives bearable.� 
�And the other women? The ones wearing collars. Are they enjoying these� interludes?� 
This occasioned a throaty chuckle from Emily. 
�They are not here to enjoy. But in return for meeting our needs we meet theirs.
  The slave who took your coat is a doctor. She arrived here a year ago, fresh
  from her internship. She was struggling. Her practice is thriving now. She
  has a waiting list.� 
Emily watched the comprehension suffuse Judith's eyes. She loved watching
  the little whores struggle through the loss of their self-image. 
�The one with the drink tray nearest us is our stockbroker and the one just
  beyond her is a talented artist that we are all patronizing.� 
�They are your things�and you want me to be your thing as well.� 
�Thing is a bit harsh. We want you as one of our slaves�one night a month
  for a mere two years. In return you will become a senior partner with your
  firm almost immediately. By the time your �interlude...with us has passed you
  will probably no longer even need Geller. You would be able to start your own
  firm. Our business will follow you. The woman you would be replacing is doing
  very well indeed. We won't be deserting her for you. This is world class money.
  There is plenty to go around.� 
�And if I decline this outlandish proposal you will destroy me?� 
�Don't be absurd, Judy. We may be decadent but we are not entirely malevolent.
  Naturally there would no longer be any hospitality for you in big league financial
  circles. But I am sure an attorney of your talent could still eke out a living
  with an obscure and needy little firm somewhere.� 
�A mere two years.� Judith repeated quietly, wondering to herself if a person's
  self image could survive two dozen such humiliating assaults. 
As she spoke she was watching one of the ladies blatantly drag a finger up
  between her server's legs and hold it briefly to her nose. She then turned
  her attention back to her group and absently held her finger out. Without instruction
  the young woman set down her serving tray and leaned forward. She sucked the
  shiny digit into her mouth, cleaning her own residue from it. Emily had followed
  her eyes. 
�You think cleaning a finger is beneath you, don't you, Judy? You think it
  looks slutty. 
Judith immediately shifted her gaze but was at a loss to reply. Emily quickly
  wet a finger in her mouth and leaned forward to dip it into a sugar bowl on
  the coffee table. She then pressed it past a startled Judith's parted lips.
  Emily pressed the sweetness onto the retreating tongue. 
�Suck.� She commanded. 
Reflexively Judith drew back but Emily's hand had grasped the back of her
  neck. Hoping the moment would pass quickly she hesitantly did as she was bid.
  Emily's voice grew soft then. 
�I know you are a sharp and talented young professional. That is why you are
  here. And yes� you do look quite the slut with your lips around my finger�but
  you can taste the sugar as well. We have lots of sugar, Judy� 
Emily released Judith's head and slowly withdrew her finger, wiping it on
  a cheek already shiny from a single tear. The short haired blonde had appeared
  before them in answer to some unseen signal and stood waiting silently. Emily
  patted Judith's hand affectionately. 
�You just follow D here back out to the foyer and make your decision there.
  If you are willing to serve us she will prepare you. If not�well, Blackjack
  is waiting outside to drive you home.� 
Smiling, Emily rose and without a backward glance walked away from Judith
  to join her bridge club. 
7. 
Judith scarcely noticed herself being led out of the ballroom. It was only
  the brilliance of the overhead chandelier in the foyer that reawakened her
  to the fact that the moment of decision was truly upon her. 
There was the door. No one was blocking it. Outside the obsequious Blackjack
  was no doubt waiting just as she had been told. Off to her left, the nude woman
  she had heard referred to merely as D held open the door to what appeared to
  be a powder room. She studied this D's face for some sign of warning or encouragement
  but the woman's expression was completely neutral. 
The one that had taken her wrap had been called V. Judith realized suddenly
  that if she accepted this mad bargain and entered that powder room she herself
  would probably thereafter be referred to as J. No more Judith�just plain J. 
She had no need to weigh what had been offered. She had imagined to perquisites
  of success often enough. She was only twenty six. The very real possibility
  of heading up her own firm before she was thirty was so unheard of as to be
  totally intoxicating. 
And what really was being demanded after all? That she trot around in the
  nude fetching and carrying for these spoiled bitches. Remembering her time
  with Emily by the pool she knew that there would probably be sex involved.
  She would be prostituting herself. But then it had already happened more or
  less, hadn't it. She had already allowed herself to be used and humiliated.
  She might as well make them pay for it. 
Law school had been three hard years of struggle for her tuition. Long nights
  of study and a daily grind of tough classes under merciless professors. Once
  the initial embarrassment passed, a single evening a month would be a walk
  in the park comparatively. Just a few more of the dues one paid along the way,
  she rationalized. It was the smart thing to do. 
Almost decisively she turned her back on escape and entered the powder room.
  Standing before a mirror she saw the nude form of D come up behind her. 
�What else is expected, D?� She asked the woman quietly. �Beyond the fetching
  and carrying and being groped, I mean.� 
�Shhh. We are not allowed to talk amongst ourselves. All you need know is
  that during your time with the Mistresses you must obey. Undress.� 
Judith's fingers went slowly down the buttons on her blouse. With it undone,
  she looked at herself in the glass and paused. Obey. Her mind rebelled at the
  ominous tone of the word. 
�Tell this beautiful slave of theirs to get your coat.� Her inner voice screamed
  at her, �Get your coat and get your ass out of here!� 
Instead her hands began to hurry. She almost tore her clothes off in a rush
  escape the voice� to reach the point of no return. 
�Lift your hair.� 
She did as instructed and watched as D's delicate hands encircled her throat
  with one of the sturdy silver chokers and fastened it. From it hung a ring
  and from the ring a silver tag engraved with the letter J. It was of jeweler's
  quality but it still looked exactly like what it was�A naked bitch's collar.
  Another tear ran down her cheek. A tear for the departure of Judith. 
�Bend forward and spread your legs, J.� 
Staring into her own wet eyes she mechanically she lowered her breasts onto
  the cool marble surface of the vanity and widened her stance. She felt something
  hard and smooth being rolled along the length of her pussy. She uttered a small
  gasp as it penetrated her. She spread her legs wider to accommodate the intrusion
  only to feel it being quickly withdrawn. 
�Good. You are a bit moist. The plug will go in more easily.� 
She caught a glimpse of shiny red rubber in D's hand. The object looked rather
  like a stubby red carrot attached to a drain stopper. Before the truth fully
  registered she felt a firm pressure against her anus. 
�No.� It was uttered reflexively. 
She heard the woman behind her mutter derisively. 
�You lost the right to say no when you accepted your letter.� Then a more
  sympathetic tone crept into D's voice. �Squat and relax your ass� as if you
  are about to shit. It won't hurt as much.� 
The pressure against her nether hole increased and she groaned as she felt
  it being stretched. She desperately bore down; trying to comply with the advice
  she had been given. At last the anal muscle gave way and her sphincter finally
  contracted again. The plug had lodged firmly in her ass leaving her feeling
  awkward and uncomfortably full. She felt lighter touches of something on the
  skin of her back and the cheeks of her ass. 
�Turn around and hold your hair back again, J.� 
She did as instructed wondering at how quickly she was responding the abbreviated
  form of address. D was holding a bright red lipstick and used it to make up
  her mouth. As she tasted the heavy coating on her lips she looked down to find
  D coloring her areola. The woman then began writing on her face. 
�Hold still, J.� 
More writing on her breasts and belly. She tried to decipher the words being
  applied to her body but the letters came to her backwards from the mirror and
  D gave her no time to linger. 
�Come with me now.� 
With an arm across her breasts and a hand covering her mound she followed
  D. Her eyes were drawn to the swaying ass in front of her. Protruding from
  it was a round red stopper. Only too aware of the fullness in her own ass she
  now knew the view she herself presented from the rear. 
Back out in the intimidating brightness of the foyer she now saw a rectangular
  box on rollers. It was covered in black velvet and slightly larger than an
  old fashioned steamer trunk. 
She knew immediately that it was for her and she almost let out a nervous
  giggle. Was she meant to pop out of this silly box like a nudie treat at some
  stag party, she wondered, smiling in spite of herself at the absurd image the
  idea conjured. 
�Get down on your hands and knees, J.� 
Slowly she lowered herself onto the cold tiles. It turned out that the black
  velvet was a fitted cover which D pulled away to reveal a steel cage. The lingering
  smile in her mind vanished and a sick, hollow feeling filled her belly. Nervously
  she watched D swing open the barred door at one of its ends. 
�Crawl inside, J.� 
Almost in a trance, she did as D bid her. Shivering as she heard the door
  fastened behind her. D then appeared at the end she was facing and swung open
  another door. She squatted before J and fastened a short leather leash to the
  ring of her choker. 
�Open your mouth.� 
When she did, D placed the leash in her teeth and told her to hold it there.
  D closed and fastened the door. She saw that the woman inside had begun to
  cry again. For the first time she felt a stab of pity. She knew nothing of
  this J other than that her background must be similar in many respects to her
  own. A year ago it had been her palms and knees on the metal floor of this
  same cage. Impulsively she reached through the barred door and stroked J's
  damp cheek. 
�Just listen and obey, sweetie. I cannot tell you it will be easy but I came
  through it and so will you.� She whispered. 
With that D stood and pulled the black cover down over the cage and left J
  in utter blackness. 
The steel bars of the cage pressed in on her shoulders and those above forced
  her head down. With her long legs folded under her Judith had never felt so
  confined. It was almost claustrophobic. 
She felt the cage begin to roll and then she heard muffled conversation and
  snatches of laughter. She realized that the cage had been rolled back into
  the ball room. It sounded as though the ladies were dining. 
�Ladies!' She thought wryly and then corrected herself, �The Mistresses. And
  I am now J. It is like a play and my role is to be J. It is just a game.' 
It was hot under the black cover and she began to sweat. Disjointed thoughts
  wandered through her mind. So unreal. Them out there, dressed to the nines
  and chatting away over dinner and drinks. Just a game. A very weird game. I,
  naked and sweating in a draped cage awaiting God only knew what. It will be
  worth it in the end. One down after tonight and only twenty three to go. All
  a crazy, rich bitch game. The inner voice eventually quieted and the heat and
  blackness sank her into a trancelike state. 
8. 
�Ladies! Your attention please!� 
Emily, as Mistress of ceremonies had risen. Immediately conversation in the
  room died away and was replaced by an almost tangible air of anticipation. 
�Once again we come to our favorite part of the evening. The dealing of the
  cards�.after all this is a card club.� 
A titter of general amusement rippled through her audience. At a gesture from
  Emily the slave V began working her way around the tables offering a deck of
  cards. As each lady drew her card she held it up displaying a single letter. 
Across the room were gathered the slaves with attached leads in their mouths.
  As each saw her letter raised, she detached herself from the group, lowered
  herself to all fours, and crawled to kneel at that lady's feet. In this position
  her lead was offered to the lady who would be her sole Mistress for the remainder
  of the night. 
When all the cards had been drawn only one lady was left with no girl attending
  her. An obese, middle aged woman, far plainer than the Armani she was wearing,
  was holding the letter J aloft and smiling hugely. 
�Well, it looks as though Mistress Mildred has drawn the honor of breaking
  in our novice. You may take the throne, Mildred. Will the rest of you ladies
  please take your places for the initiation.� 
All of this had been plainly audible to J in her black isolation. In spite
  of all the mental preparation she had strived to pull around herself every
  nerve grew taut at the realization that her time was at hand. 
J heard a scraping of chairs and a shuffle of momentary movement and then
  her darkness was joined by a creeping stillness that raised gooseflesh on her
  crouched, sweating body and sent a shiver through her. 
�It's just a game.� She began to whisper repeatedly. �All a game. Just a game.� 
This mantra was swept from her head as the cage's drape was yanked away, leaving
  her exposed and cringing. Instantly her ears were filled with a cacophony of
  catcalls and whistles. The sudden flood of light had blinded her but through
  slitted eyes she saw before her a long, red carpet runner. Lined up on either
  side of this were the ladies of the bridge club. Their leering faces had a
  nightmare quality. Painted lips and wild eyes jeered and sneered at her. Their
  taunts battered her like heavy hail. 
�Whore!� 
�Slut!� 
�Cunt!� 
�Start the bitch! START HER!� 
The door to the cage was swung open and J stared down through the gauntlet
  of screaming, crop waving women. It was no game before her. It was a scene
  straight from hell. 
At the end of the long red path ahead of her waited a lone woman in a gilt
  chair so large that it dwarfed her. A swarthy, double chinned woman whose chubby
  legs were so short that they dangled above the floor. Ludicrously, she realized
  that this must be the Mistress Mildred that had drawn her card. 
The absurd vision gave J a flash of courage. �Fuck them.' Her mind said, �They
  may be rich and powerful but they are also small and ugly. That is why they
  need me.' Almost arrogantly she emerged from the cage and began crawling. 
Emily stood aside from the excitement, quietly relishing her success. Seeing
  the once proud young woman emerge from her cage was definitely doing it for
  her. Judith Jackson, class of 2001, summa cum laude� crawling along now with �I
  AM THE SLAVE WHORE J' scrawled across her ass in red lipstick. 
Emily drank in the irony of the scene as she did with every new arrival. If
  only all of these snotty bitches she called her friends knew of her own background,
  she thought with secret amusement. J's first cry of distress refocused her
  attention and she began savoring the pain and humiliation of her latest victim
  anew. 
J had briefly thought she might travel the length of the carpet in some manner
  of perverted but defiant dignity. The notion vanished almost instantly. The
  tip of a crop made square contact with the base of the plug in her ass and
  tore a howl of animal agony from her. Reflexively she curled into a fetal ball
  with her hands twitching here and there in a vain attempt to ward off the rain
  of blows. If she covered her rear, her breasts were belabored. When she hugged
  her chest her thighs were punished. Her cries and pleas for mercy were met
  with scorn. 
�Don't you dare keep Mistress Mildred waiting, you spineless slut!� 
J heard this through the riotous welter of insults and curses and realized
  that she must crawl on. The women above her were in a frenzy of lust and the
  blows would not stop until she presented herself to the short, fat bitch in
  the gold chair. 
She struggled up and forced her hands and knees forward. Her eyes locked on
  the close set ones of the distant woman awaiting her. The double chin and stubby
  legs that had only moments before struck her as ridiculous now appeared as
  the very embodiment of salvation. 
Cunning upward slashes burned her pussy and stung her swaying nipples and
  it felt as though the plug in her ass was being driven into her bowels. All
  that allowed her to continue was the fact each slap of a crop distracted from
  the pain of the previous one. The pain moved and she moved with it � foot by
  torturous foot�until, an eternity later, her nose touched the frame of the
  gilt chair and the blows ceased. 
With a single sob of relief her head drooped and hung low. Dripping snot and
  drool, she sucked desperately for air. Her sides heaved and her welted flanks
  were slick with sweat and smeared lipstick. 
Mildred Hunsacker, with her bird's eye view of J's ordeal down the gauntlet,
  had felt no pity. She had seen the girl's eyes lock on to her own when she
  had finally managed to pull herself up. She had watched the spirit fade from
  those eyes with each successive jolt of pain and had enjoyed every moment of
  it. 
Mildred had long ago decided that she was unlucky. When the bastard she had
  married used to insist that she accompany him to Vegas�back when she'd still
  had her figure, she thought bitterly�On those trips she had never cashed a
  single chip. Turning over her card earlier to find the letter J had thrilled
  her. Mildred had never had one of the brand new ones to play with and as she
  looked down at the beaten body before her she could feel her plump, bald cunt
  begin to flow. 
She leaned forward and taking a handful of damp hair, jerked J's head back.
  The girl's eyes were glazed. Mildred slapped the slack cheek sharply until
  she saw them focus and then released her hank of hair. 
�You seem to have dropped your lead, bitch. Get hold of it and offer it to
  me properly.� 
As comprehension made its way through the pain daze, J clawed the lead from
  between her breasts and held it out only to have it slapped from her hand. 
�Bitches offer with their mouths.� 
Bending hurriedly, J clumsily retrieved the lead with her teeth and presented
  it again. It was taken from her mouth and she felt her head being petted. A
  good bitch's reward, she thought dully. The shame she felt was overwhelmed
  by her relief at having pleased this woman. The woman who, by the luck of a
  draw, had it in her power make her immediate life bearable. She tried desperately
  to fill her eyes with gratitude. 
Mildred grasped the hem of her skirt and bouncing with a hitching motion,
  rucked it up over her ample hips. She then took hold of J's ears with her small,
  pudgy hands. 
�Hang out your tongue, bitch.� Mildred ordered sweetly. 
J stared at the bald and obviously wet gash that now gaped before her. Even
  had the gorgeous Emily ordered it she would have been repulsed�but this wrinkled,
  sloppy thing was� The extraneous thought that all pussies were not created
  equal careened through her head. Then she felt her ears twisted sharply. She
  screwed her eyes shut and quickly stuck out her tongue. 
�Open those fucking eyes and look at me, bitch.� 
J opened her eyes and fixed them on the face above her and felt her head being
  pulled forward. Then her nose filled with musk and her protruding tongue was
  coated with a thick briny taste. 
�Lick.� 
J's half hearted effort fetched another painful twist of her ears and a hiss
  from above. 
�We can either spend the night with you helping me cum on your smug face or
  I can get my jollies otherwise, bitch.� 
So saying, Mildred lurched forward over J's back with one short arm extended
  and hammered her fat little fist onto the plug in J's ass. J screamed into
  her Mistress's pussy and was left gasping as Mildred settled back into her
  throne. 
�Well, bitch?� 
Thoroughly cowed now, J began lapping away in what could only be described
  as a fever to please. 
She was oblivious to the sudden cheers and laughter of the ladies who had
  been quietly watching to see how Mildred would handle her first newbie. Among
  them stood Emily. She vastly enjoyed her view of J on her knees, with her plugged
  ass jutting out, slurping madly away at dumpy Mildred's repulsive cunt. Turning
  her back on the scene at last, she gave V's lead a smart tug. 
�Heel.� 
Walking away, she reminded herself that she would have to reward V for making
  sure the right card had wound up in Mildred's fat little paw. After a night
  with that Emily was quite certain that J would deem it a privilege to be used
  by her. 
9. 
J for her part was so desperately involved that she had no inkling of Emily's
  departure. Her entire being was focused only on pleasing. She had decided that
  complete surrender on her part was all that would ease and speed the hours
  ahead. 
Mildred was completely enthralled with her moment in the sun. Playing to her
  audience, she used her grip on J's ears to wrestle the young woman's face viciously
  into her pussy. When at last she orgasmed, it owed itself as much to the thrill
  of being watched as to J's frantic tongue. 
With a final grunt of satisfaction she wrenched J's shiny face from between
  her thighs and forced it up and back for all to admire. Satisfied with her
  performance, Mildred struggled up out of the huge chair and made the announcement
  she had heard often but never, until then, had the pleasure of voicing. 
�If the Mistresses will again form the gauntlet�the slave, J� my slave� will
  thank you for your attentions on our way out.� 
Once more the ladies of the bridge club aligned themselves along the red carpet
  and Mildred jerked sharply on J's lead to get her attention. 
�As I walk you out, you will keep your head low and kiss each Mistress's foot
  in gratitude for your first lesson in humility. If you embarrass me you will
  regret it, bitch. Now�Heel!� 
With that, J began crawling again. At each pair of feet she paused and lowered
  her lips. Her mouth paid homage to one foot after the other as she was led
  along back up the red plush under her knees. J kept her head down but from
  above the comments of unseen lips drifted down to her. 
At a pair of highly arched black patents, 
�Save something for us, Mildred.� 
A set of highly glossed toes in heeled lame sandals. 
�If I had drawn her she would be crawling along with a belly full of piss
  by now.� 
A nylon clad foot that was slipped from its shoe and presented with its sour
  scent. 
�Check out the freaky nipples on the slut. I have a sharp new set of clamps
  that I can't wait to try out.� 
And then, finally, the floor ahead of J was empty. Her knees had begun to
  ache beyond all of her other pains and she was thankful for the short legs
  she followed during her struggle up the hard marble stairs. Upstairs, she was
  led into a private bedroom. During the hours that followed she was never urged
  to make love. Her face was repeatedly used more or less as a saddle. Something
  her Mistress rode for her pleasure. In the periods between her orgasms, Mistress
  Mildred aroused herself by slapping, pinching and twisting J's most tender
  parts. Often J had the distinct impression that she was being punished for
  being tall and attractive. 
At the very end of the ordeal the Mistress Mildred decided that J had earned
  a cum of her own and had begun stroking her. It was impossible. Save for the
  sweat and slobber coating its exterior, J's pussy was as arid as the Sahara
  . In a fury Mildred had almost yanked out the hair on both J's head and mound
  before thrusting her out into the hall in frustrated disgust. 
The slave V had been waiting and collected the sobbing heap she had become.
  J had been led downstairs and bathed. She was helped into her clothes. All
  of this was done in silence. The last thing J remembered was being handed into
  the limo. Knowing that she was at last out of danger must have shut down her
  memory. Her next awareness came with an awakening in her own bed. 
Once her mind focused, J thanked God that it was a weekend. Every muscle cried
  at the least movement and her immediate thought was to quit. There was no way
  she could see herself surviving two years of this. She limped to the shower,
  swallowing several Ibuprophin on her way. 
All of Saturday was spent easing herself back into rationality. Sunday was
  little better. She was so afraid of any contact from the woman she now thought
  of as Mistress Emily that she had unplugged her phone. There was nothing else
  for it. When she returned to the office she would tender her resignation and
  pack her bags. She would find a small town somewhere and begin again. A town
  where wealth would probably be measured by the number of cattle a person owned
  but fuck it�at least she would be safe. 
On Monday morning J walked into her firm half expecting snide glances. The
  shame of her evening at the bridge club was so fresh that she felt she must
  appear branded. If anything though, to her surprise, the secretaries greeted
  her more warmly than she was accustomed to. Even so, it was a relief to reach
  her office and close the door behind her. 
It was empty. Other than the furniture dimples in the carpet the room was
  almost bare. Almost� because a single, beribboned bottle sat on the floor where
  her desk had stood. Stooping she picked it up and recognized the label. Macallan.
  The exclusive scotch Geller had offered her earlier. She heard the door open
  behind her and turned. 
�Congratulations, Miss. Jackson . Or perhaps I should call you Judy now and
  you call me Sid.� 
�Mr. Geller, I�� 
�Me first. I had a call Saturday from Mrs. Dawes-Smith. She advised me that
  you would be representing her interests henceforth and that she did not feel
  it suitable that her tax attorney of record be so junior here. Needless to
  say, I agreed wholeheartedly.� 
�Mr. Geller�� 
�I am going to be honest with you, Judy. I suggested a junior partnership.
  She said that if that was best I could do she would take you without us. I
  called a meeting of senior partners at the country club over the weekend. It
  was unanimous. This firm is now Geller, Gant, Perkins and� Jackson .� 
�I'm speechless. I...well, I thank you. All of you.� 
�This is all the thanks we need.� He replied, waving a sheet of paper. 
�What is it?� 
�A power of attorney, in your name, that grants this firm access to the financial
  records of ASSCO Inc. The major holding company of the Smith assets. I had
  your stuff moved last night to one of the corner suites. It's only temporary.
  I sent for a decorator. Have her do your office anyway you like. The sky's
  the limit. You did it, Judy. I don't know how but you really did it. You got
  her for us, baby!� 
So there it all was, J thought. Just as Mistress Emily had said it would be. 
10. 
There was no letter of resignation. Judith allowed herself to be swept along
  by Geller's enthusiasm and attended the welcoming dinner they put on in her
  honor. With an unlimited future on a plate before her, Judith had been unable
  to turn away. If her dreams of arriving had been alluring enough draw her into
  Emily's web, her first taste of the real thing was instantly and totally addictive.
  She pushed her deal with the devil to the back of her mind and bathed in the
  sudden shower of professional praise and acceptance. 
It was only when she was alone, at night, that the dread of her obligation
  to the bridge club returned to haunt her. Even though Judith had buried the
  silver choker under a seldom worn sweater in a bottom drawer, she was all too
  aware that soon she would be wearing it again. 
As if those disturbing thoughts were not enough, Judith had also begun to
  question her sexuality. Her reaction to all of the kinky hoops Emily had jumped
  her through had run the gamut from anger and humiliation to fear and disgust.
  Still, she could dot deny that there had been moments when she had become aroused�very
  aroused. Judith told herself that it was merely because she had been so focused
  on her career and had denied herself a social life. She had been celibate save
  for bouts of self-pleasure for too long. She made up her mind that she would
  accept the next time an attractive man asked her out. 
All of Judith's previous work was shunted to junior associates to allow her
  to concentrate solely on the affairs of Amalgamated Smith Systems Corporation.
  A whirlwind of financial consultations with the officers of its various companies
  ensued. She was flown between them by private jet and at every stop she found
  a limo and first class accommodations awaiting her. As a representative of
  ASSCO's major shareholder she was accorded a polite, if guarded, respect. 
As she began to digest what she'd learned, Judith saw immediate avenues for
  improvement. She could not help but feel a guilty pleasure at finding matters
  in some disarray. The situation guaranteed that her efforts would be quickly
  reflected in an improved bottom line. 
It seemed that the late Harold Smith had been a dynamo who had not believed
  in delegating decisions. Neither had he believed letting the left hand know
  very much about the right hand's affairs. His unexpected passing had left considerable
  confusion behind. A year old power struggle for control was still ongoing.
  Many entrenched interests and large egos were involved and the prize they were
  after was the widow's proxy. Judith realized that, even with the backing of
  the lady in question, she would need to tread softly to avoid being crushed
  in the melee. 
A very full two weeks had passed with no word at all from the woman who had
  changed her existence so dramatically. This left Judith alternating between
  moods of relief and disquiet. The moments of relief vanished with the arrival
  of a summons on Emily's now familiar stationery. It informed her that she would
  be expected at one p.m. and to keep her future Monday afternoons clear as well.
  Judith instructed her new private secretary to hold this day completely clear
  as she would want those mornings to prepare for each meeting. 
Judith could not help but wonder whether these afternoons would revolve around
  serious solutions to the problems she had identified or if there were more
  games in store. The woman obviously saw life as one big sexual circus with
  herself as its Ring Mistress. 
Judith was on time to the minute when she pulled up under the mansion's portico.
  As expected, she was met by the immaculately uniformed Blackjack and was once
  more led out to the garden. This time, however, Emily was dressed. She wore
  a bright batik sundress in shades of red and motioned for Judith to join her
  at a shaded table. Blackjack moved quickly to offer her a chair and then stationed
  himself behind his Mistress. 
�I'm pleased, Judy. You seem to have impressed everyone. In fact, I think
  they are a bit afraid of you�or at least what you may tell me.� Emily laughed. 
Judith barely contained an audible sigh of relief when she heard Emily address
  her as Judy. For all of her deviousness it seemed that Emily was turning out
  to be a lady of her word. Not that she would be any easier to deal with once
  Judith's next installment as J came due. She cleared her head and began opening
  the portfolio she'd brought with her. 
�I have some initial recommendations here that...� 
�Save all that for now. Go fetch her out here, Blackjack.� 
Judith eyes followed Blackjack's departure uneasily and wondered what new
  twist was in store for her now. 
�It may amaze you to learn that, after their period of conditioning, few of
  our slaves resent their time at the club. In fact, some crave the hours they
  spend with us.� 
As Judith read between the lines of what Emily was saying, Blackjack reappeared
  followed by a young Asian woman on a lead. A delicately boned and exquisitely
  doll-like woman. Judith had always marveled that so many Oriental women seemed
  to retain a girlish quality well into their twenties. 
This one was nude and wearing one of the silver chokers. As they drew near,
  Judith saw that it sported the letter T. Blackjack unclipped her lead and T
  immediately dropped to all fours, and crawled to Emily's knees with her head
  lowered. The girl's hair was cut in a longish bob and Emily ran a hand casually
  through the dark silk of it and smiled at Judith. 
�T is one of those that crave. Of course, the extra time she spends with me
  has made me quite fond of her. Some of the ladies in the club are more vicious
  than others with regard to the pain they inflict. For some reason T's card
  has never been drawn by any of them.� 
Emily continued to smile and stroke T while she watched her message sink in.
  She saw the turmoil behind the eyes across from her. She loved these moments.
  Just as surely as her hand was toying with T's hair, her will was toying with
  Judith's mind. Without shifting her gaze, Emily slowly drew up the skirt of
  her dress and let her legs fall open. She took a fist full of hair and pulled
  T's face onto her sex. 
Judith tried to remain detached. She was being let know that if she just lowered
  herself from her chair and joined T that the time ahead would be much easier.
  She detested herself for being tempted and she also hated the fact that the
  lewd display she was being treated to was arousing her. 
Emily was still smiling at her but had also begun slowly humping the face
  she held hard between her thighs. The girl's ass was open to Judith's view
  and the sight of all that warm, gold toned skin was making her wet in spite
  of herself. She again felt like an unwilling voyeur caught up in an erotic
  dream where time moved in slow, sensuous motion. Emily was using the girl's
  face almost lazily and the raw sexuality of the scene was unnerving. The urge
  to just give in and go with the flow was strong but Judith's fear of losing
  her identity totally was stronger and she managed to remain seated. 
Emily saw Judith's resolve reassert itself and knew that this would not be
  the day. With a final push and pull she let herself cum on T's mashed lips.
  With a grunt of satisfaction, she leaned back in her chair and clasped her
  hands behind her head while T lapped her clean. 
Emily was not upset. She had feared at first that Judith was going to be too
  easy. This fresh show of resistance pleased her. It was so much more fun to
  break the stubborn ones�to feed them their pride bite by bite. The longer it
  took the sweeter it was when they finally came crawling. She watched Judith
  search for words and then clear her throat. 
�Would you care to go over these ideas of mine for ASSCO now, Em?� 
Emily almost burst out laughing. The damn girl did have poise. 
�No, sweetie. In addition to being one of my needy, little sluts, T is also
  a very sharp accountant.� 
Emily pushed T's shiny face away and lowered her dress. 
�She has her own firm. ASSCO is not her client but she translates the statements
  they send me so that I can understand what is going on. I pay her well for
  this even though she has offered to do it gratis. Haven't you, pet?� 
�Yes, Mistress. Gladly.� T answered quietly. 
�Now, get your tiny, yellow ass dressed. I want you to go off somewhere with
  Judy. Listen to what she has to say and you can explain it all to me later.� 
�Yes, Mistress.� 
T remained on all fours and crawled off toward the house. Reluctantly, Judith
  shifted her gaze from the girl's swaying haunches. She decided that she had
  been dismissed as well and stood up. She started to say good bye but Emily
  had picked up a magazine and merely waved her away. 
Through slitted eyes Emily watched Judith's back and ass as she walked away.
  She wondered how much starch would be left in her after a second evening at
  the club. She hadn't been exaggerating when she'd said that some of the ladies
  were real sadists. One was a particularly mean bitch. Melinda Stephens had
  a cruel streak that put the rest in the shade. Emily now thought her the perfect
  one to next draw the letter J. 
11. 
&nbsp;
Out front, under the portico, Judith waited impatiently for T to join her.
  The woman who finally emerged was sharply turned out in a suit of light grey
  pin stripes and patent heels. She was every inch the picture of a self-assured
  young lady. An image of the slender, golden T on her hands and knees had been
  so imprinted on Judith's mind that she was taken aback. T smiled and extended
  her hand. 
�Traci Hepburn. Pleased to meet you, Miss. Jackson.� 
�Call me Judith. Nice to meet you as well, Traci.� 
How bizarre, Judith thought�there they were exchanging polite introductions
  as if they had just set eyes on one another. 
�You look rather surprised. Perhaps you were expecting something different.
  Velly solly, Missee but only my mother is Japanese.� 
Judith did not reply, deciding to ignore the hint of sarcasm. It was only
  natural that Traci would be a bit defensive after the display Emily had made
  of her. 
�I was driven here so I shall have to go with you. I can call for a ride after
  we are through if bringing me back will be a bother.� 
�Where is your office, Traci?� 
�If you have everything with you there is a quiet little bistro nearby. We
  can go over things there.� 
The short drive was made in silence. Traci volunteered no small talk and Judith
  remembered that D had told her that the slaves of the bridge club were not
  allowed to talk amongst themselves. Judith would have loved to ask a few questions
  but was sure anything said would find its way back to Emily. 
They sat across from one another at a quiet corner table and ordered espressos.
  Judith unfolded her suggestions for streamlining Assco's financial structure
  to take advantage of tax benefits that were being overlooked. She found Traci
  to be a quick study. Judith decided the girl must have a phenomenal memory.
  She was able to call up facts and figures pertaining to Emily's holdings at
  will. 
�So, those are my broad recommendations. There is still much that I am unfamiliar
  with. I would like copies of everything you have in Emily's file. In time I
  will forward the details of a comprehensive plan to your office for an appraisal
  if that is what Emily wishes.� 
�I shall explain all of this to Mistress Emily. She assured me that you are
  competent in your field and it appears she was not mistaken. I am impressed
  by what you have accomplished in so short a time.� 
Hearing Traci refer to Emily as Mistress unsettled Judith. The bridge club
  was extreme enough but it seemed that the bright woman across from her was
  held in thrall beyond any one night a month agreement. She tried not to let
  her disdain for this show but promised herself that whatever was ahead she
  would never allow this to happen to her. 
�Now that we are finished�shall we have a drink before I drive you back?� 
Traci looked at her steadily but did not respond until Judith lifted an eyebrow. 
�I see how you regard me. Well, I was there when you crawled your ass along
  the red carpet. Don't be feeling sorry for me. For all of your airs, J� you
  are her slut too.� 
Without even thinking, Judith whipped her hand across the table and slapped
  Traci's face a sharp one. She was as surprised by her reflex as Traci was by
  the blow. Immediately, conflicting emotions flashed through her. There was
  a certainty that the woman had deserved it but also an urge to apologize. Stronger
  than either of these though was a rush of arousal. The sting on her palm seemed
  to be sending signals to her pussy. 
She half expected some retaliation but instead, within an instant, Traci's
  wide eyes dropped submissively and it was she that apologized. 
�Forgive me. I spoke incorrectly.� 
Judith stood up and covered her confusion by gathering her things. 
�I think we'll skip the drink and probably it would be better if you called
  for a ride.� 
�As you wish.� Traci acquiesced with her eyes still lowered. 
Judith made her way to the door without looking back. She was up on the expressway
  before her thoughts settled enough to think rationally. Probably the entire
  incident would be related back to Emily. She laughed aloud ruefully. She should
  have known that no meeting involving Emily would ever end in any predictable
  manner. 
Looking back over the afternoon, she was no longer surprised at having slapped
  Traci. Judith had been businesslike and polite. There had been no need for
  the woman to play the bitch and rub her face in the memory of her own humiliating
  ordeal. No, she was no longer shocked that she had lashed out� but she was
  still in wonder that slapping the little bitch had aroused her. She glanced
  down to find that she had actually been driving with a hand between her thighs. 
More busy days ensued for Judith. Other friends of Emily's had retained the
  firm to handle their affairs and Geller was falling all over himself to please
  Judith. She meanwhile heard nothing further from Emily but as the end of the
  month approached her dread of a second night with the ladies of the bridge
  club became ever heavier. When the summons at last arrived, Judith found it
  bitterly ironic that it was worded as an invitation to �another evening of
  fun and frolic'. 
That evening, even though she knew that any choice of clothing would be immaterial,
  she still bathed and dressed with care, almost if she were preparing for her
  own execution. She had taken the silver choker from its hiding place and laid
  it atop her dresser, refusing to put it on until the last possible moment.
  That arrived when her intercom buzzed and Blackjack politely informed her that
  he was waiting downstairs. 
12. 
There was no limo this time. Instead she was helped up into the rear of a
  large, windowless commercial van. Inside, by the light of single dim bulb,
  she saw a number of nude women seated along each side on bare steel benches.
  Among them she recognized V. 
�Take a place and undress, J. You may place your clothes beneath the bench.� V
  told her. 
The van had already begun to move. J began removing her clothing, bracing
  as best she could against the van's swaying motion. With her clothes finally
  on the floor under her, J became just another nude body. She studied the others
  surreptitiously but each of them seemed locked in a private silence. �We are
  being transported like livestock.' The phrase came unbidden to J's mind and
  hung there. 
The vehicle stopped, occasioning apprehension in J, but it was only to add
  another woman. It was T. She watched her sit and calmly start to unbutton her
  blouse. J felt she should avert her eyes but could not. As
  the Amer-Asian woman's small breasts were revealed J felt herself flush. T's
  eyes then came up to meet her own. There was no resentment in them at the fact
  that J was watching her. In fact, J thought she detected a slight lift at the
  corners of T's mouth. Suddenly all of the nude flesh around her seemed to crowd
  the van. J shifted slightly and realized that the hard metal under her ass
  had become damp. 
When they arrived, J followed the other women out of the van and inside. She
  found her self in a large kitchen. Where covered trays of hors d'oeuvres had
  been set out. Several clothed women, caterers, J assumed, moved busily about
  preparing food and drinks and gave their arrival but cursory notice. 
V informed her that she would be serving during the social hour. Her only
  instructions were to be silent unless addressed, to be pleasing and to remember
  that this night she was a slave. 
How did one even serve a snack without at least asking if something was desired,
  J wondered? She decided that she would just have to emulate the other slaves
  as best she could. At some unseen signal the women took up trays and began
  filing out of the kitchen. J took up a salver of canap&eacute;s and followed. 
Out in the ballroom, J found she needn't have worried about how to approach
  the ladies. She was fresh meat as far as they were concerned and she received
  plenty of attention. Her tray was emptied repeatedly to the accompaniment of
  casual caresses, squeezes and sometimes painful pinches. She endured it all,
  doing her best to display the same submissive acceptance she observed in the
  other slaves. 
There was no respite until the group sat down to dinner and had been served.
  By then J was flushed and perspiring both from her many trips back and forth
  to the kitchen and the frequent fondling of her breasts and ass. 
She saw Emily seated at the head table. It suddenly occurred to J that Emily's
  hands had not been among the many that had touched her. She had passed near
  her with her offerings but club's uncrowned queen had always seemed unaware
  of her. Perhaps as far as Emily was concerned J had become just another letter.
  If so, it was more than fine with her. It would be hard enough to just fulfill
  her commitment with no added attention. 
When Emily arose and announced that it was time for the Mistresses to draw
  their cards the slaves moved to line up and stand with lowered eyes. J followed
  their lead, knowing that the evening's real test was about to begin. The slave
  D moved along their line attaching leads to their chokers. At a light tap to
  her lips, J opened and felt the leather strap placed between her teeth. 
One by one, letters were called out and the slaves moved to kneel beside their
  respective Mistresses. She was just beginning to fear that she might be the
  last drawn and left standing alone when she heard her letter called. Raising
  her eyes slightly she saw a darkly fierce, Mediterranean looking woman holding
  her card up. J remembered that this woman had several times given her nipples
  vicious tugs. It was just her damned luck to be given to one of the mean ones.
  With an inner dismay she moved to the woman's side, knelt, and offered up the
  lead in her mouth. 
J was given no time dwell on what might be in store for her. The woman took
  the lead and immediately stood, gave it a sharp yank and started out of the
  room. 
�Heel, bitch.� 
The command came as J was already crawling as fast as she could to keep up
  with the woman's stride. By the time they were going up the stairs she felt
  as though she was being dragged along by the taut leash. She was gulping air
  when they entered a room and she heard the door slam behind her. 
�My, what recalcitrant bitch you are. No matter. I shall soon teach you to
  hurry along when you are with me. Get on the bed� hands and knees!� 
J bit back a desperate urge to snap back a reply. Knowing there was no help
  for it, she did as she was bid without looking at her new tormentor. 
Both pillows were snatched from the head of the bed and placed under her. 
�Down.� 
J lowered her body onto the pillows and lay still with her ass raised and
  her face buried in the coverlet. She heard the woman humming softly to herself
  and felt cuffs being attached to her ankles before her legs were rudely pulled
  wide and secured. Her wrists received the same treatment and J knew that she
  was completely helpless and could only pray that is woman, mean as she seemed,
  was not completely crazy. 
�I am Mistress Melinda. Earlier I was visiting with Emily...she mentioned
  that she thought you a bit uppity. Said she hoped that whichever of us got
  you for the night would cure you of your airs.� 
The last word was followed instantly by a blazing hurt that set J's left buttock
  afire and tore a scream from her. She pulled her head to the side and saw that
  Mistress Melinda held a long, thin cane. 
�What a lovely shade of red.� 
The woman's mouth seemed to move in slow motion and J heard the words from
  the far side of a haze of pain. 
�Thwack!� 
Her right buttock flamed and she screamed again and then sagged over the pillows,
  panting. 
�Loud bitch as well. I have a gag here...but I like the sound of pain and
  this room is somewhat removed�so make all the noise you like.� 
Hearing this, J determined that she would die before she gave this devil bitch
  the pleasure of hearing her howl again but when the sole of her left foot erupted
  in pain another scream was barely held back to a hard grunt. 
�Let's play twenty questions, J. Shall we?� 
Before J realized an answer was wanted her right foot was burned by the cane
  and even biting her lip she could not restrain an agonized groan. 
�You must answer up, girl. Now, tell me what you are?� 
�I am a slave of the bridge club, Mistress.� 
J threw out the answer with a desperate haste to appease her inquisitor. 
�Yes� you are certainly that. What else? Are you also a worthless whore?� 
J hesitated at this and the thin fire laced across her left thigh. 
�Yes.� She gasped. 
�Yes? Not yes, Mistress? Are you also a slut? A bit of trash who has sold
  her self for the business I have sent your firm?� 
Before J could utter a word the cane thwacked hotly across her right thigh,
  and after that the questions came too fast to answer, each punctuated by the
  white heat of the cane. The insults and blows rained down upon her defenseless
  form until she was reduced to nothing more than a moaning reservoir of pain. 
She must have passed out for, when she came round, she found that although
  bound and spread eagled as before, she was now on her back. The Mistress Melinda
  was now nude as well and sitting astride her belly. The dusky shine of the
  woman's skin seemed to add to the malevolence gazing down at her. It was the
  pain in her nipples that had revived her. They felt as if they were being pulled
  from her body. 
�Ah, there you are, back with me at last.� 
J's nipples were let go and the woman reversed her position and lowered her
  ass over J's face. 
�Now get your proud little tongue up inside my asshole and please me or I
  shall really hurt you.� 
Barely able to breathe and truly afraid of what further pain the woman might
  visit upon her, J complied. Her tongue in another woman's ass was something
  she had never envisioned but in her present disembodied state even disgust
  was beyond her. She wanted only to reach the end of the night. 
After what seemed an age, the woman grinding down on her face was apparently
  nearing completion as the rear opening mashing her mouth was replaced by a
  very wet pussy. She then felt a mouth at her own sex and despite her condition,
  she came alive to it. Perhaps it was only that at last she was being given
  a sensation other than pain to respond to. No sooner had she begun thrusting
  up to meet the hot licking she was receiving than the woman's orgasm flooded
  her tired tongue. Even swallowing, she thought she was about to cum as well,
  but at just that moment her clit was bitten harshly and she screamed horribly
  into a descending blackness. 
13. 
J regained consciousness in stages as her various hurts reasserted their complaints.
  The throbbing of her abused clit was joined by the aching in the soles of her
  feet. Each in their turn, the thin welts covering the back of her body joined
  the overall misery. A symphony of dull pain. She curled into a ball on her
  side and opened her eyes as she became aware of a softly hummed tune. 
At the mirror, Mistress Melinda was dressed and freshening her make up. The
  eyes in the glass became aware of her. 
�You faint easily. A pity. My own girl at home has a much higher tolerance.� 
The observation was made offhandedly. Clearly there was no remorse or concern
  over the agony she had inflicted on J. 
�Even though you are not very entertaining, I would spend more time with you,
  but I have a late date, so you may take your sorry ass downstairs now. I promise
  you though that if I draw you again, bitch, you will learn that tonight was
  a walk in the park.� 
She dabbed at her lipstick and then walked to the bed and pushed the blotted
  tissue past J's lips. 
�A farewell kiss for you�Swallow it.� 
The woman watched and waited until she saw J's throat constrict and then turned
  on her heel with a little laugh. When the door closed behind her, J pulled
  the soggy wad from between cheek and gum and threw it weakly after the woman.
  She groaned as she rolled from the bed onto her tender feet and made her way
  to the bathroom. Carefully, she stepped into the tub and turned on the shower.
  She leaned forward against the tiles and let its cool cascade ease her backside. 
There was no relief from the thoughts in her head though. She knew that, unless
  she became as willing as T was to crawl for Emily on demand, her future would
  be ever more painful. The sadistic bitch that had just left would have twenty-two
  more chances to make good on her cruel promise. And there might be others among
  the Mistresses that were as bad or worse. 
The ride home on the steel bench of the jostling van had been miserable. Though
  all had been silent, some of the women looked as though they had been used
  harder than others. T had showed no signs of wear. J suspected there might
  be many side arrangements such as the one between T and Emily. 
Judith limped through the entire weekend recovering. It angered her to realize
  that, in effect, her bargain was going to cost her three days of misery a month. 
Monday came and she threw herself into the complexities of financial analysis
  in an effort to blot out the memory of Mistress Melinda's soft humming and
  fiery cane. The temptation of Emily's inferred offer of protection intruded
  often though. 
As the firm's list of new clients continued to grow, the partner's came to
  treat Judith as if she were the goose that had laid the golden egg. 
She'd been invited to join their country club. They'd ordered that fresh flowers
  be delivered to her office daily and had leased a new Mercedes for her and
  a light remark about the color of the upholstery had caused it to be replaced
  immediately with one more to her taste. Geller had even gone so far as to mention
  an elegant new home near is own, assuring her that she would easily be able
  to afford it when the yearly bonuses were awarded. 
Their increasing attentions made it clear that it had dawned on them that,
  at some future point, she might strike out on her own, taking her clientele
  along with her. 
Well, she thought, before the money had rolled in they'd not had two thoughts
  about her. She did nothing to ease their anxiety. After all, it was she that
  was paying their way. Paying a debt that was beyond their ken. 
Several files arrived from T's office. They contained all of the details of
  Emily's business transactions since shortly after the death of her husband. 
Odd, Judith thought, that while she was insisting on retaining her identity
  and hated the idea of being J, she continued to think of Traci as T. What did
  this say about her? Perhaps she was the self-deluded hypocrite T had accused
  her of being�No... It had not been her that had crawled voluntarily between
  Emily's legs outside the confines of the club. It had not been her that had
  offered her face as a toy and her hair as a cunt rag. 
The intercom interrupted her musings. 
�Miss Jackson, The CEO of Data Engineering is on the line. He wants to know
  when it would be convenient for you to meet with him. He indicates that he
  could fly here if you are too busy.� 
Judith hesitated for a bare instant. 
�Ask him how soon he can get here. Set it up and then come in�I need to dictate
  a few letters.� 
They would be coming to her. This was a huge development. She was being recognized
  as a power. The only possible snag was Emily. Judith knew that, at a whim,
  the unpredictable woman might snatch it all out from under her. She had been
  trying to gather the courage to face the pain ahead without surrendering her
  last vestige of pride. 
But what if Emily grew irritated and bored by her attitude? 
All of her suffering could easily turn out to have been for naught. 
�Damn it all to hell.� She muttered aloud. 
A quotation she remembered from her Latin studies summed up her situation
  perfectly: A fronte praecipitium a tergo lupi�A precipice ahead and the wolves
  behind. 
14. 
&nbsp;
All too soon, she was again summoned by Emily. The garden surrounding the
  pool had almost begun to feel familiar. That fact that Blackjack remained in
  attendance and that T was curled like a pet cat at Emily's feet did not surprise
  Judith. 
�All of the big, bad men that are running my companies continue to be impressed
  with your expertise, Judy. But I am being pressed by them to commit my proxy.
  You have met them all now, which of them would you recommend?� 
As she was speaking, Emily had slipped off a sandal and begun playing her
  toes across T's lips. Judith lifted her eyes from this and took a deep breath. 
�None. We think you should rest your proxy with us until we can bring them
  all in line with my restructuring program. After that, we will give you our
  opinion. You will need to make a choice quickly then as any further in-fighting
  might begin to be reflected in your stock price.� 
Emily nodded thoughtfully and changed the subject entirely. 
�How was your time with Melinda? Her tastes tend to run to the extreme.� 
�It was no fun, Emily. Would you like a detailed account? Will hearing about
  my pain turn you on?� 
Instead of answering, Emily merely smiled and sighed contentedly. Judith looked
  down to find that T now had her mouth stretched over Emily's toes and was sucking
  at them slavishly. Emily saw that Judith had noticed. She slipped her other
  foot free and extended it off to one side invitingly. 
The choice was being offered again. How long would Emily tolerate her refusal
  of total submission before becoming vindictive? This was a woman obsessed with
  having her own way. Judith had no doubt that, if thwarted, Emily would become
  vicious. 
Judith's new stature, the Mercedes and promised new home, the limitless future�none
  of these things rested on a firm foundation. Her new life was merely a house
  of cards. A single gust of Emily's displeasure and it would all be swept away.
  Having had a taste of it all, she hated the idea that it might disappear. 
Above her smile, Emily was very much aware of the churning thoughts in Judith's
  head. She took her eyes from Judith's and looked pointedly down at her foot.
  She wriggled its toes, making it plain that they desired the same attention
  their mates were receiving from T. Still smiling and saying nothing further,
  she waited. 
Every fiber of Judith's being wanted to stand and politely take her leave,
  to gamble that Emily would keep her half of the bargain they had already made. 
No. She was not willing to risk losing the ground she had gained. She slowly
  rose up from her chair and ignoring Blackjack's presence, she began undressing. 
Emily's smile broadened as she watched each item of clothing removed and folded.
  When J was completely nude she got down on her hands and knees and crawled
  forward. Emily saw her head lower and felt her toes drawn inside J's moist
  mouth. It was the sight of J's surrender more than the moist sensations at
  her feet that set her cunt flowing. Pulling up her skirt, Emily used both hands,
  one set of fingers pulled hard at her lips while the others stroked feverishly
  at the fat nub that emerged from its hood. When she finally came it was a victory
  celebration. 
Almost lazily, she reached down and pulled her slaves' heads up between her
  splayed thighs. As the two tongues cleaned her she signaled Blackjack for another
  glass of wine. Emily settled back to enjoy her afterglow. It felt good to be
  the Queen. 
As she bent to her task, J looked sideways. Although T's tongue was as busy
  as her own she was sure the smaller woman's eyes were laughing at her. J felt
  Emily's hand push her head. 
�Enough.� 
T backed away and assumed a kneeling posture with her head down and J copied
  her. 
Emily got up from her chaise and stretched. She was luxuriating in thoughts
  of the fun that lay ahead. She was not fooled by J's token submission. They'd
  had two battles of wills and Emily had won both but it still remained to totally
  break the girl's spirit. It had been unnecessary with T. In her, Emily had
  found a natural submissive. 
�You won't come to me again without your collar, will you, J?� 
�No, Mistress.� 
�You were a very bad girl� making me wait so long.� 
�Yes, Mistress.� 
Emily chuckled inwardly. The responses were right on cue but she would soon
  drag this little actress out of the role she was trying to play and into the
  harsh light of reality. 
�Stretch out on your back for me, J� 
�Yes, Mistress.� 
J moved quickly to comply, hoping that whatever games Emily had in mind would
  soon be over and that she would be dismissed. 
�You have a lovely body, J. Do you feel attractive?� 
�This girl hopes it pleases her Mistress.� 
Emily hiked her skirt up to her waist and moved to squat above J's face and
  reached down to part her labia. J looked up at the pink interior she'd just
  licked clean. Deciding that Emily wished further pleasure, she extended her
  tongue. Instead, Emily released her bladder, soaking J's face with a slow,
  steady stream of the wine she had consumed. When she was finished she stood
  and backed off. 
�T, come clean me. J's face is too messy to be of any further use.� 
While J struggled with her stinging eyes and the acrid taste in her mouth,
  T crawled eagerly forward. When she was satisfied, Emily dropped her skirt
  and moved toward the house. 
�Heel, T.� 
Then she paused and looked back over her shoulder, 
�Oh...I'm done with you for today, J. Run along home.� 
Emily did not see the look in the eyes that followed her departure. 
Left with only the stoic presence of Blackjack, Judith made her way quickly
  over to the pool and dived into the water. When she climbed out, even though
  the pissy smell in her hair had been replaced by the faint tang of chlorine,
  she still felt stained. She ignored Blackjack and a proffered towel, pulling
  her clothes on over her still dripping body. 
�If you are ready to leave, Miss, I'll show you out.� 
There was no sarcasm or sympathy in the man's voice or expression, just the
  same maddening neutrality. 
�I believe you really are a damned eunuch! � She snapped. 
Blackjack merely looked back at her impassively and made no reply. Without
  waiting for his lead Judith made her way out of the house, leaving him to follow
  her. He was only just able to prevent the door she yanked behind her from slamming.
