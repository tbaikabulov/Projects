No Place for 
Pets

Chapter 1: Passion rules the night&nbsp;&nbsp; 
The frigid cold of winter had given way to the first brisk days of spring. The cool draft that ran through the old farmhouse sent goose bumps crawling across her skin. At this hour she should have been asleep, and yet sleep would not find her. The slow steady breathing of her slumbering boyfriend beside her was a testament to the fact. But despite her best efforts she lay awake tossing and turning atop the heavy covers. She was sprawled out on her back, eyes staring up at cracks running across the ceiling. The stifling warmth of the bed sheets bunched at her feet. Her fingers were sensually tracing lines across her smooth supple skin. Teasingly they worked their way along her slim frame, over her ribs and caressing her breasts until reaching the only piece of clothing she wore. The leather band of material would be an odd sight to see, the thin black leather wrapped around her neck was held firmly in place by a silver buckle. It looked almost strangely like a dog's collar. She let her fingers trace the old smooth leather as her thoughts began to wonder.
The fifth child of a prairie farming couple, life had never been easy for her growing up. Life on a farm was hard work with little time to relax. All the children had been expected to help with the daily duties and to take time off from school to help with the harvest. Kara had never enjoyed farming. It was dirty hard work that often left you sunburned and tired to the bone. As a young girl she had always tried to avoid working in the fields as much as possible. She had much preferred her father's other business. He had always been an avid hunter. The dog kennels were his way of feeding his hobby and making a little money on the side. Kara like most little girls was fascinated with the dogs from the very beginning. Although bred for their size and strength they were not house pets. Her father often warned her not to get too attached as they were working dogs and could be sold at any time. But having never had a pet herself, all the dogs soon became hers. Many a summer afternoon was spent playing with the big dogs, which would all go loping off in a big scrambling pack every time she would play fetch with them. Of course she had her favourites who would get special attention and even scrapes from her own plate snuck out after dinner. 
The memories of her childhood brought a smile to her face. She had always loved the old farm house and the wilderness that she spent many a lazy afternoon exploring. So when her parents finally retired she had bought the old place from them. The many acres of fields in which her father used to grow his crops were now full of weeds and untended. For neither she nor her boyfriend were farmers. That did not matter for both of them made enough money to live comfortably in the old farm house. He worked as an online IT consultant working from an office in what used to be the houses den, while she had taken over right where her father left off with the dogs, giving up a promising start to a career as a nurse. 
She had been surprised and delighted when she went out to the kennels after coming back from 4 years studying at university, to find that her favourite old friend was still there. It had been almost 13 years since she had first met Sandy. Even as a little puppy Kara and the golden bundle of fur had been inseparable. A large pointer bitch, Sandy and she had been the best of friends. Often a day of exploring would end with her head on Sandy's furry belly while the two of them watched the sun go down together. 
Kara's thoughts returned to the present. That afternoon she had buried her old faithful friend. 13 years was a long time for any dog, and death was nothing new to Kara. She had seen countless of the animals come and go in her time spent around the breeding kennels. Yet there was something about her old friends passing that was keeping her awake even now as the moon was at its highest point in the sky. It was sad to see her old friend go. But she was not stricken with grief at the loss. Growing up on a farm you quickly learn to accept the natural course of life. The old bitch had lived a full and vibrant life, and Kara would treasure the memories they shared forever. Yet still she tossed and turned atop the covers. 
Kara had always been different. It was something she had grown to accept. Not that the affections of boys and men had ever been a problem for her. A reckless tomboy in her youth she had blossomed into a strong and beautiful young woman. Her silken hair the colour of straw, cute freckles covered her cheeks and full bosom, exercise had always ensured a sleek figure, and skin gorgeously tanned by a lifetime of working under the sun's rays. No it was not her appearance that drove them away it was her habits in the bedroom. Her first boyfriend had been appalled when she had voiced her desire. That first tender relationship had ended when she had shown him her collar. It was an old dog's collar she had taken from her father's kennels. She had confessed herself to him in her youthful naivety and he had scorned her. It had crushed her physically and mentally, the names he had called her still stung even now, when thinking about it. 
It had only become worse as she grew older. Her attempts to hide the secret from her lovers only lead to sexual frustration and emotional pain. Self-enjoyment became her only escape. Masturbation a dirty word she had learned from school soon became the only way for her to derive any sexual pleasure in life. While her teachers and priests extolled the virtues of womanly chastity, Kara was thinking about the sexual bliss her fingers would bring her that evening as she lay hidden beneath her covers her moans of pleasure muffled by a towel clenched between her teeth. She tried she truly did but achieving orgasmic ecstasy became impossible without the smooth leather collar wrapped around her neck. The few boyfriends she did try and confide in reacted much the same way as her first. Lovemaking soon became a chore as she was forced to act out her pleasure. Kara began to distance herself from others. Her last years away at school were spent in almost complete despair and loneliness.
Then she met Jim. It was truly by chance, she was walking to class when a patch of ice sent her tumbling. It was only the timely grasp of a strong pair of hands that kept her from striking her head against the hard concrete. Talking to him was so easy and his compassionate personality made her open up to him like no other before. By the end of the year they had become inseparable. Jim must have thought her a nun though for Kara delayed the inevitable sexual aspects of any relationships for as long as she dared. When it could wait no longer she finally told him about her fantasies, and about the burning desire she felt within her. He had silently listened only nodding his head in response. When she had finished Kara braced for the humiliation and anger that she had experienced from so many lovers before. 
But that didn't happen instead he took her into a loving embrace, his chest pressed up against hers his eyes staring down into her own. He told her that no matter what he would always love her, and that she would never have to hide her true self from him again. That night with her collar wrapped around her neck Jim made love to her like no man had ever done before. There was no need to fake her pleasure for by the time he finally finished she was gasping for breath her mind numb with pleasure. Kara had never felt the full power of an orgasm brought on by the sexual exertions of another and that night she experienced more then she could count. 
As the memories of that first night began to fade, she turned her mind back to the question that was keeping her awake. While she had grown up and left the old farm to go and explore the world, her old faithful friend Sandy had stayed behind. But of course she was only a farmyard bitch born to breed with the studs that strutted around the yard. To nurse her offspring until they were old enough to be taken from her and trained to hunt and work. The old dog had lived her entire life from birth to death on the farm. Most of it trapped within the wire mesh of her cage. Kara had a choice she got to leave but Sandy didn't, and that was what was keeping her awake. 
Perhaps it was wrong, many a would be lover had told her just so. But Kara had been asking herself that question since that day so long ago when she first wrapped the leather collar around her neck. She wanted to lose control, to have her free will stripped away. Not just for a night of passion beneath the sheets but to truly lose control of all decisions. She wanted her responsibilities stripped away until she could just enjoy the moment, no worrying about deadlines or chores. In her mind it was the ultimate show of trust more than any meaningless marriage vows between couples. She wanted a lover that would not only understand her but also to care for her completely. Kara wanted to truly be at the mercy of another, to offer her undying loyalty and obedience in return for loving care. That would be her marriage vows. 
Her fingers tugged at the band of leather lying against her skin. The material had become brittle and cracked in its old age and frequent use. But still it brought the same excitement to her as that first day so long ago. It had been years since the first time she had snuck into the bathroom with the stolen collar in hand. Something had changed in her that afternoon, and it had all started with a daydream. Kara didn&#8217;t know where the dream had come from. It seemed to form within her consciousness from the deep dark corners of her mind. Even today it was as vivid as that first time. It always began in a room so dark that she was afraid of never seeing light again. The door would open and the man would come in. Naked and trembling she stood before him. With a silent command she would slump to her knees, eyes staring at the ground. Caring hands would buckle the collar tightly about her neck. Suddenly any fear she felt would be gone. A gentle finger would lift her chin until her eyes met those of the man before her. No malice was in his eyes only loving care. Kneeling before him she wore no clothing, only her master's collar about her neck.
She took a deep breath, the chilly air doing little to cool her rising passion. Kara was feeling hot. Her old day dream had started a fire deep within her loins, as it had so often before. The room suddenly felt like a sauna, perspiration began to form upon her skin. The tingling feeling between her legs that was once just a distant thought began to pulse, its pace slowly increasing. Each breath of air she took felt dry and humid as it passed down her throat filling her rising chest. Tossing and turning would do her no good. Only one thing would satisfy the need that her body now desperately craved.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
He barely flinched as she drew back the warm covers revealing his naked form beneath. The sight of him always made her pause. He was handsome, in rugged outdoorsman sort of way. But it was not his looks that Kara was after at the moment. With cat like movements she moved upon her prey zeroing in on what she desired. With one knee on either side of his body she was straddling him like a seasoned cowgirl about to mount a bucking bull. But first she would have to give him a little encouragement. One hand ever so gently wrapped itself around his limp but still impressive cock. While her other began to massage his twin balls, so full of what she desired. Licking her lips she leaned forward to meet his already rising member.&nbsp; 
"Kara, honey what are doing? Ughhh�." A very groggy Jim had just awoken as her warm wet lips wrapped themselves around his eager cock. Whatever further questions he may have had for her were stolen from his thoughts as she began to lick and suck her way from tip to base and back again. He was rock hard before he finally managed to regain some sense "huh�honey as much as 'groan', I appreciate the effort its 3 in the morning." He managed to gasp out between moaning. 
A loud wet sucking sound was heard as Kara withdrew her lips from his now very attentive cock. Wiping drool away with the back of her hand she looked into her lovers eyes. "I can't fall asleep I've been laying here awake all night thinking about Sandy." 
Jim gave her a startled look "I'm sorry about your dog but that really doesn't explain the midnight blowjob baby." Jim eyes went wide as Kara teased her tongue over the head of his cock. The first traces of his pre ejaculate being greedily licked up. Kara's eyes were locked with his as her tongue moved from the tip of his member down its entire length before running all the way back. Jim had to bite the inside of his cheek just to keep from releasing his load there and then.&nbsp; "Not that I'm complaining" he said gasping between breaths. 
With satisfied look on her face Kara licked her full luscious lips clean. She could taste the faint traces of her lover's sweet juices. Like an appetizer before the main meal she was left wanting more. "No it's not Sandy that's keeping me awake." Kara had begun to edge her body forward, ever so gradually inching her way along the mattress, her knees still straddling her lover. "Well okay it is Sandy but not what you think." Her movements ceased as now her hips were positioned just above his own. Kara new this next part would be the hardest. She had to convince him to agree with her plan, luckily for her men are easily persuaded. 
"I want to know what it feels like." His cock standing rigid as a redwood was now directly beneath her slick and inviting entrance. "I need you to take control. Not just for an hour or two at night but for longer." Her thigh muscles were stretched tight as slowly she began to lower her body, the gap between them growing smaller by the second. "I need this baby. It's like an itch that I just can't scratch." If Jim had barely been listening before Kara's next move didn't help. As her pussy lips finally touched the engorged tip of his cock they stopped just before giving Jim the satisfaction he craved. "I need someone to treat me like the bad girl that I am." Kara began to tease the head of his cock brushing her puffy red lips against its sensitive skin. "I want to do it for a month" Each teasing brush was a bright burst of pleasure only to be snuffed out as her glistening lips moved away. His cock was quickly covered in not only his own lubricating desire but also that of her own. "Will you be this needy puppy's owner?"
Kara had Jim right where she wanted him. He was fully awake now but his cognitive functions were being seriously impaired for obvious reasons. Even just trying to put coherent thoughts together must have felt impossible. Kara knew she had to be relentless. She could not let him compose himself. Teasingly she continued to brush her glistening lips against him. Pretty soon his pelvis was involuntarily thrusting at her, his hardened member pressing upward, only each time to be denied by her quick reactions as she pulled just out of reach.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
It was too much for her poor boyfriend. His cock was throbbing beneath her, and it was the one making the decisions right now. "Yes! Fucking yes! Just fuck me already!" his voice filled with desperate need.
That was all the confirmation that Kara needed. Her own moan was only eclipsed by that of his own as she finally eased herself down onto him, her labia's lips parting for the enlarged head of his cock as it slipped within her. Her teasing had ensured ample lubrication as his thick shaft pressed ever deeper, each inch of it sending spasms of pleasure racing through her body. Jim let out a long drawn out gasp as her warm snatch fully enclosed around him. His cock now buried up to the hilt within her warm wet embrace. 
With barely a pause to catch her breath Kara began to move her hips above him, slowly lifting herself up, pausing only just before the tip of his cock sprang free, before slipping right back down again. Pretty soon powerful hands had a hold of her sides, his fingers almost encircling her waist, now her own downward thrusts were aided by his own forceful pull. Her thrusts were becoming faster, his cock slamming into her sensitive sex harder, and harder. His own pelvis thrusting up to meet her downward movements, their bodies meeting together as one, over and over again. Heavy panting soon filled the room as the pair of lovers looked deep into one another's eyes. Kara could feel the pressure ready to burst within her. Her movements became increasingly erratic as she focused all of her attention on the growing pleasure between her legs. Exhausted muscles driven on only by need now. All that teasing had taken its toll as with one last thrust she quivered with bliss, as Kara's release overwhelmed her. Her pleasure sent Jim groaning into ecstasy, as he too could hold on no longer. A satisfied smile spread across her lips as the fire within her was sated at least for the moment, as her lovers warm cum filled her womb. 
Exhausted, and with his slowly softening member still deep within her Kara collapsed atop her lover. She let out one last gasp of pleasure as her clit ground into pelvis. Kara needed this, after all her fruitless hours awake this was the relief she needed. Embraced in each other's arms blankets and modesty forgotten they fell asleep in the warm afterglow of their lovemaking.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
