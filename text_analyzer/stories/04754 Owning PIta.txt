A Romance of Submission and Dominance

&nbsp;

Is this the first chapter of a
novel? The decision partly depends on the interest of readers like you who are
willing to express your reaction in emails, PMs, or
public comments. 

����������� The story
is true. Some of it is factual. Thank you to pita, my submissive partner in D/s
and crime, for helping me to live it, to write it, and to dig deeper into
myself. Thank you to Sophia Jane, my partner in writing, for helping me to dig
deeper into my characters. And thanks to you for reading it. � Joe

Prelude: What Will Be 

&nbsp;

On the front porch, a woman stands naked except for a collar
and cuffs. She goes to her knees in the yellow mist of a Georgia
morning before a naked man, somewhat older than she, who sits in a wicker
chair. Neither of them preen nor hide from the other.
They are comfortable in their nudity. Water dripping from leaves and branches
makes the only sound a summer shower has left behind.

&nbsp;

Her knees are spread and her hips rest against her heels.
Her hands rest palm upward on her thighs. Her head tilts down as if it would be
presumptuous to look up. She is not only at peace, she
is stunningly beautiful to him. The way he looks at her is tender. 

&nbsp;

She waits. His voice is quiet, deep, and affectionate. �A
beautiful morning,� he tells her.

&nbsp;

�Yes, Sir,� the woman responds, and then adds, �I suppose
�.�

&nbsp;

�How can you doubt it, little one?�

&nbsp;

�It is beautiful,� she admits, �but I hate having my new hairstyle
caught in the rain.�

&nbsp;

He is silent, regarding her carefully. Then he asks gently, �Is
there something I should know?� Their conversation is a morning ritual, and he
is watchful at any note of discontent in her.

&nbsp;

She shakes her head slowly; her red hair catches the sun as
it moves softly across her shoulders, and light sparkles off of her collar.
�No. The day will be what it will be, Sir.�

&nbsp;

His brow furrows. The creases in his forehead are deep and his
eyes penetrate her. Like the gray wolf in a picture on the wall in their den,
she finds this look omniscient and emotionless when she is fixed by it. Her
head bows further, and her breath comes faster. She doesn�t always understand
what makes him look at her this way.

&nbsp;

�I think it is best if you spend a few minutes in your room,
dear one.� His voice is low and friendly. �You are unsettled,� he explains. �I
will call you in a bit.�

&nbsp;

The woman rises gracefully, in a single, fluid motion and
pads into the house with short, silent steps. She likes it that he sees into
her heart so easily, but it is unsettling. She goes to a door off the living area
that leads to a room, which once was a large closet but is now hers. 

&nbsp;

She has had such a room in every place they have lived. This
one is painted pink. It has a pink rug, a chair that has been hers ever since
she has been with the man, a white and pink rabbit, and is organized around a
picture of a child ballerina who is looking wistfully out of a window. When the
man gave her the picture years before, he told her it could tell her everything
she needed to know. The child soon became comfort and inspiration to her. 

&nbsp;

On the porch, the man finishes a mug of chai
she had brought to him. He stands and stretches in the yellow light, a lean and
weathered body freeing itself from the gray night he carries from bed each
morning now. He is thinking of her. 

&nbsp;

She is unsettled; he might guess part of the reason, but she
is able to sometimes settle herself, and that is preferable; but when she can�t
understand the problem, whether it is hers or his, she
will ask him for help to find her focus and natural docility.

&nbsp;

He moves easily and swiftly, arranging furniture so there is
space around the large, white column at the corner of the porch. From there it
is possible to see three counties. He quickly arranges loops, cuffs, and hooks
that tinkle and rattle from heavy eye hooks at the top, middle, and base of the
column. He goes indoors and returns with a black whip called a
cat-o�-nine-tails.� He brings a towel and
a container of water with ice rattling against the sides and places a holder of
straws next to it. Finally, he adjusts a clear path to the hammock suspended at
the shady end of the porch.

&nbsp;

When he is done, he goes in, knocks on the door to her
little room and asks the woman to come out. When she re-enters the living room,
her hands are fluttering like birds; she is anxious. She turns to him and, head
down, asks if she may ask a favor.

&nbsp;

�Of course,� he says with concern. �You know I am yours.�

&nbsp;

She goes again to her knees. �It�s nothing serious, Master,�
she says, speaking clearly. �I need help dealing with hormones and the crazy
energy in me. I feel scattered and self-absorbed.�

&nbsp;

The man bends down to take her hands in his. As he
straightens, she raises her head to look into his eyes for the first time since
she knelt before him on the porch. 

&nbsp;

�What do you want me to do?� he asks her.

&nbsp;

The woman tells him what she wants, bowing her head again,
and the man nods; he helps her to her feet and they walk, he a step behind her
with his palm resting lightly on the cool skin just beneath her waist, back
onto the porch. There, she goes to face the corner post he has prepared and
takes a deep breath. 

&nbsp;

She adjusts the cuffs on her own wrists and ankles. He snaps
a quick release latch from the ceiling through her outstretched wrists, gently
spreads her ankles, and latches one end of the lower chain through the left �D�
ring of her ankle cuff, and the other end through the right ring. 

&nbsp;

He moves up her body. He has designed restraints that allow
her maximum sensation and some control over the feeling she receives. She has
small rings through her nipples and each of her major labia; he hooks the small
chain around the column at the height of her hips to the labial rings, and then
the chain at chest height to the nipple rings. The woman is quiet, eyes closed,
head tilted back and her lips slightly parted. She is waiting patiently for
what will be. There is neither need nor desire in her to struggle.

&nbsp;

When he is done, he stands by her and bends his head to kiss
her open mouth. His sex stirs. He asks her if she is alright and ready to
begin. She nods. He gives her a sip of the water and, when he sets the water
back on the table, picks up the whip. 

&nbsp;

The knotted leather whispers through the quiet air of the Georgia
morning. Against her shoulders it makes a snapping sound. At first, each time
it lands the woman cries out and writhes against it. His motion is fluid,
controlled, and he gradually moves the strokes lower on her body. He watches
each stroke hit its target. Her bottom quickly becomes pink and then shows a
series of crisscrossing welts. He is listening to her and after each stroke his
eyes scan her body and her face for the signs of what she wants and needs from
him.

&nbsp;

The whip hums and snaps through the morning air again and
again. After awhile, the woman no longer cries out but softly moans and then,
gradually, becomes silent. She has stopped writhing and she seems to be pushing
into the strokes and pulling gently against the nipple and labial clamps. 

&nbsp;

A drop of spittle trickles from the corner of her mouth. His
sex is hard with the energy he feels at owning her in this way. His rhythm
never varies, and he sees small spots and streaks on her skin where blood has
begun to seep. 

&nbsp;

He is watching her carefully still and begins to see the
signs of what some call subspace, a trancelike euphoria where she is no longer
capable of good judgment but is afloat on waves of sensation, like a hawk on high
winds that soars and floats above sparkling trees and grasses far below. Her
head rolls in circles from shoulder to shoulder. Subspace was, from the first,
easily won, but still it is a prize they both cherish.

&nbsp;

He allows her to remain in the place she loves, a head space
free of the need to be locked in herself and her stresses, for as long as he
feels he safely can. 

&nbsp;

Then he changes his rhythms, interrupts his strokes, pauses,
gives rapid, staccato flourishes until he sees he is
disrupting her stupor. He speaks her name and stops the flogging. 

&nbsp;

Now he moves as quickly as he has all morning and loosens
her fastenings, beginning with her feet and ending with her hands, after he has
turned her toward him and put his shoulder so that she can lean against him
when he frees her. 

&nbsp;

He carries her to the hammock, gives her water to drink and unwraps a large piece of the dark chocolate she loves. While
she nibbles on it, he spreads cool lotion on her welts and on abrasions left by
the whip. He notices that the morning birds sing louder. Later he will help her
apply an antibacterial cream.

&nbsp;

For now, he climbs into the hammock and holds her to him,
her face against his throat, and she cries with the release of the emotions
that had been unsettling her. At first she cries sporadically, then with a burst she sobs and at last settles to a low,
soft keening. He holds her continually and tells her she is his good girl. 

&nbsp;

After a time, she dozes. He continues to hold her and finds
himself dozing off, too, grateful that his tired right arm no longer needs to
be under constant control. He visits the place inside himself where darkness often
hides and decides it has retreated once again, perhaps into the forest across
the field. He feels the muscles begin to twitch in his triceps, and feels the
ripples of muscle in her back as she, too, relaxes. 

&nbsp;

He listens to the birds and thinks �This is what the day
should be� while the hammock barely moves. When she wakes, the sun is high. She
is playful now and begins to touch his soft penis. As he begins to stir at her
touch, he teases her �What�s a fatalist like you doing in a nice hammock like
this?�

&nbsp;

She is playful now. �I�ve told you, my submission is what I
am, Sir.� But she is also intent. Her hand and fingertips bring him, quickly,
to full erection. Her touch is magic, and his cock begins to twitch of its own
accord.

&nbsp;

She caresses him for a long time. Finally, she raises her
head and asks: �Sir, will you come for me this beautiful morning?�

&nbsp;

�No, pita,� the man says, smiling at her. �Your submission
is beautiful, and you, and your lust � but I�ll give you that part some other
day perhaps.� 

&nbsp;

�It�s a long day, Sir,� she says, �and it will be what we
make of it.� But her fingers slow, and minutes later he becomes aware of a soft
breeze at his loins. He has to think whether it is her breath or a lost breeze.

&nbsp;

�I wonder,� she says quietly, �what Lexi�s
new med student boyfriend is like.�

&nbsp;

Her comments often sound irrelevant. �Are you concerned she
isn�t ready to be submissive?� he asks.

&nbsp;

�Oh, I still think she�ll be more of a domme.�
She pauses, then thinks out loud. �I was just hoping
my daughter finds someone who will fly a thousand miles to give her a pink
rose.� 

&nbsp;

He listens to her breath as she drifts off into a deep sleep.
Her shoulders rise and fall in rhythm with the slight motion of the hammock.

&nbsp;

The man watches across the field where cottonwoods at the
edge of the woods shimmer in the sun. Beyond them, from a tall, shadowy oak he
sees a hawk leap forward and climb toward the sky where it will search for
prey. 

&nbsp;

He smiles as he recalls, as he does every day, the woman who
taught him to love, and he thinks, too, about the woman asleep on his shoulder who has brought him back to it. 

&nbsp;

From the line of trees, a mockingbird begins its list of
songs. He knows there is darkness deep in the woods and imagines gray forms moving
silently from shadow to shadow. He wonders what the wolf will be doing on such
a beautiful morning.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Chapter 1: Touching Down������������� 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

�Touch yourself. Sit where you are, pita, and lift your skirt.�

&nbsp;

�I�m in the front hall. Someone ��

&nbsp;

�Sit on the steps.�

&nbsp;

�The guy next door is paint...�

&nbsp;

�Pita, no one can see.
Touch yourself.�

&nbsp;

��Yes, Sir.�
He heard her sigh but ignored it.

&nbsp;

�You don�t have panties on, do you? Are you aroused?�

&nbsp;

�No, Sir. And no, I�m not.�

&nbsp;

�I want to tell you about your spanking bench�. I finished it.�

&nbsp;

�Thank you �. Sir, what is that?�

&nbsp;

�Yours is like a saw
horse with leather cushions for the sides and top. The wood is cherry. There
are shackles for your ankles and wrists and a collar.�

&nbsp;

For a second he heard
silence on the phone. �It sounds lovely, Sir. Will you punish me on it?�

&nbsp;

�Probably not. It is for my pleasure, pita, but I think
you�ll like it.�

&nbsp;

�Why, Sir?�

&nbsp;

�If I bend you over
it, you can be spanked. If you straddle it, I can have your bottom or pussy, or
I can use your face.�

&nbsp;

�Sir�.� She was quiet,
but then from the back of her throat he heard heat rising. �How does it ....�
She became quiet.

&nbsp;

�A dildo is harnessed to
the top. I can put a butterfly against your clit, and you can mount the bench
and lower yourself onto them. They both have remote controls.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Sir�.� Her voice
was nearly a whisper. He smiled, imagining what was in her mind. 

&nbsp;

�Are you wet now?� 

&nbsp;

�A little. Sir.�

&nbsp;

�Is your clit enjoying the spanking bench?�

&nbsp;

�Sir, could I come today?� Her breath had become deeper, eager.

&nbsp;

�I thought you weren�t
aroused,� he teased, then spoke succinctly. �Am I your dominant, pita?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Sir, of course.�

&nbsp;

�Then I�ll decide if you want to come. Isn�t that the way it works?

&nbsp;

�For now, keep
touching yourself.� His voice was a low growl, but he was smiling. Through his
kitchen screen, he could hear crickets chirping and the motion of wind in maple
leaves.

&nbsp;

�Thank you, Sir.�

&nbsp;

�Imagine you are in my
house; the shirt I�ve had you wear is off. You have cuffs on your ankles and
wrists, and the training collar is snug. You are being my good girl. You wear a
butterfly and straddle the spanking bench, waiting, my pussy an inch above the
dildo. Your open hands rest on your thighs.�

&nbsp;

She hummed, �Yes, I await your pleasure.� He listened to her breathe.

&nbsp;

�I will use you, pita. Someday soon. I
promise.�

&nbsp;

�You know I want that, Sir.� 

&nbsp;

�When I come into the
room, I�ll blindfold you and lock your ankles to the bench and your wrists
together. I�ll have you lower yourself gently until pussy�s lips touch the
dildo. You will move your ass forward and back, so the dildo just slips past
your lips and begins to open your cunt. 

&nbsp;

�Are you still wet, pita?�

&nbsp;

�Yesssss.� Sir. 

&nbsp;

�You will lower
yourself slowly, dear one, onto the dildo, just an inch. Then come back up, and
again down. Each time go deeper, until the dildo is buried and pussy is pressed
against the leather.� Her breathing followed the motion he imagined; she inhaled
as he described the dildo sinking into her, and she exhaled as he told her it withdrew.

&nbsp;

�Ummm,� she sighed. 

&nbsp;

�Are you comfortable, pita? Your hands are on the bench?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Sir, for balance.�

&nbsp;

�I�ll put a line
through the rings in your cuffs to a ceiling shackle. If you put your weight
against the rope and hang from it, your body can press against the butterfly
and the dildo.�

&nbsp;

He heard her moan, a
little louder. His eyes were closed to imagine both the scene he was describing
and the submissive on the other end of the phone as she touched herself. 

&nbsp;

�Think of the touch of
the floggers, pita. Imagine the soft deerskin stroking your flesh, over your
hips to your shoulders, and back down, caressing like warm night wind. I will heat
your skin. Deerskin will pink your pale flesh quickly. And when I lash you
hard, first your shoulders, then across your ass, you will begin to lean into
the whips on each stroke.

&nbsp;

�I know you are wet
now. Feel the sweetness that will seep past the dildo. Are you wet, pita?�

&nbsp;

�Ohhh.�

&nbsp;

�I�ll turn on the
butterfly so you can grind pussy against your bench. Hear the buzz as it boils
up the orgasm in your clit. Does the vibration feel as delicious as you taste?�

&nbsp;

�Yesss,� she hissed.

&nbsp;

�And when I turn on
the vibe in the dildo, feel it curve into your G-spot. You�ve been moving your
hips to touch it harder.�

&nbsp;

�Ohhhh, yes, Sir, yesss.�
Her breathing was quick and shallow.

&nbsp;

�You�re a good girl, pita. You�re getting turned on for me.�

&nbsp;

He waited. She was
quiet except for the soft cooing of her arousal. Then he heard a quiet, nearly
silent whisper: �Please,� she said.

&nbsp;

He ignored her. �You
will be ready for the whip, pita. The blows will fall across your shoulders. Feel
the heat, and in my opposite hand another flogger, this one rabbit fur. I will stroke
it over your breasts, then slap them with it. How your
nipples will stand out! What a pretty sight.�

&nbsp;

He heard her say it again, louder: �Please, Sir.�

&nbsp;

�Please what, pita?� 

&nbsp;

�I want to come,� she said. �Please, Sir.�

&nbsp;

�No, pita,� he said,
the growl back in his voice. �Wait.� He went on. �I want to whip your breasts
and move my deerskin lashes down to your ass, and turn the butterfly and dildo
to a higher speed. If you are my good girl, you will press down against them, and
let your weight carry you so they will make you come, but not until I say you
can.�

&nbsp;

�Ohhhh,� she moaned, then �Yes, Sir.�

&nbsp;

�Does it feel good, pita? Do you still want to come?�

&nbsp;

�Ohhh, Sir, yes.�

&nbsp;

�Can you ask, nicely, pita?�

&nbsp;

�Please, Sir.�

&nbsp;

�You don�t sound
serious, pita. It doesn�t matter to me if you come. Maybe you would really want
it if I made you suck on my cock. I�m very hard. If you really wanted to come,
you�d beg me.�

&nbsp;

�Oh,
my Joe. Please let me come. I
need to come so bad. Please Sir. Please my Joe, I want to come. Ohh, fuck, fuck.�

&nbsp;

�Pita,� he said to her
over her chant. �Pita ��� and he counted slowly to ten while she moaned,
listening and straining against her own desire. Perhaps there was the sheen of
sweat on her forehead.

&nbsp;

He snarled: �Come hard, slut. Come for Me. Now. Right now.
Come for me, be my slut.�

&nbsp;

She erupted, her voice a shrill cry that fell to a squeal and became a
soft keening.

&nbsp;

Her voice was full of heat, even on the phone. She responded
eagerly when he prodded her. And then she was catching her breath with no inkling
of the effect she had on him.

&nbsp;

What dragged him from the memory right now was not so clear.
It could have been the pulse of his erection, or a stewardess� voice, or the
woman in the blue hat across the aisle who kept glancing his way. He wondered
if his lust was obvious. But the woman was looking at his hand.

&nbsp;

He was holding a snapshot. He knew he had been staring at the
grainy, webcam photo of a girl-woman with a halo of red hair. He took a long breath.
She had an angelic and mischievous look.�
She had sent him the .jpeg print one night with a note joking that her
picture �is better than I usually look.� In it she was dressed for her job as
chief hostess at �The Boheme,� the upscale restaurant
for well-dressed dining and debauchery at the Orlando Westin Grand Bohemian.
She stood erect, smiling, confident, and in control, charming, and beautiful; but
her eyes seemed bottomless and wanting.

&nbsp;

Part of her work was to manage the wait-staff. But she
dismissed it as unwanted stress. She liked her job, she said, because she got
to people-watch close up. �It�s given me a good crap detector,� she said, �they
talk like I�m not there.�

&nbsp;

After one bad night at work she said, �When I went there I
guess I thought people would be nice because they�re supposed to have money. But
they just know how to look nice. I�ve seen a lot of ugliness, and overheard
worse.� 

&nbsp;

When the blue hat again turned his way, he raised his eyes �
Mattie had once described his look as �penetrating� � and the woman turned
away. If blue hat recalled him later, she would describe a man in his fifties,
too tall for airline seats, perhaps handsome if not for acne scars on one side
of his face � his famous �bad skin� � and black, wire-framed glasses. She might
recall his conservative and neatly pressed suit, or the way he smiled briefly
when he looked off into space. He had the look of a man used to standing before
a board of directors, but surely such a man would travel first class. She perhaps
noticed the deep lines at his eyes that gave him a look of grief.

&nbsp;

His acquaintances, if she could have spoken with them, knew
little more about his habits than she, except for the few who knew of his �exotic
tastes.� His friends had been with him for years but seldom saw him. They had
known Mattie and weren�t offended that he was rarely in public these days. 


From the corner of his eye, he saw the hat turn as she looked again. She didn�t
appear especially perceptive, but if his feelings were on his face, she might imagine
him suddenly devouring the picture. He studied the delicate, little-girl image
in his hand again. 

&nbsp;

Pita�s face was deceptively angelic. Sometimes his breath caught
when he imagined her. But he did not want to commit himself to anyone again. If
that happened, he needed to be sure he was done with the past and would not
repeat it before he sank too much of himself into the sensuality in her voice:
deep, soft, southern. Her laughter carried the sound
of truth.

&nbsp;

Months ago, only weeks after he met her on a forum where she
asked for money advice after an �ugly� divorce, he had caught himself hoping the
�relationship� would make it for longer than a week of exploration in a hotel. But
he knew how dreams could be spoiled by reality�. 

&nbsp;

Weeks later, a dream woke him with both lust and
anticipation and left him eager and unsettled. In it she was not angelic, nor
innocent. The next morning, the dream was vague. But he was certain he hadn�t
been dreaming of Mattie. He felt relieved that he hadn�t waked up sweaty with fear
again. 

&nbsp;

When pita got home late from work that night,
he told her the bits he could remember. She listened closely and laughed when he
told her about the fierce erection he had when he woke up.

&nbsp;

The next night, he had the dream again. He woke, ill at ease
and aroused again. So he told her again. This time she said �I know about it. I
have it too.�

&nbsp;

�That�s not possible,� he replied
archly.

&nbsp;

�I think I do,� she said, her
voice confident. �It is my dream, too.�

&nbsp;

He chuckled. �And
what might it be, pita? Look deep in your crystal ball.�

&nbsp;

Her voice was even when she spoke: �I�ll wait. Sir. If you figure it out, it won�t matter. If you don�t,
I�ll tell you � at the right time.� She was not going to back down. He liked that,
and her self-assurance intrigued him.

&nbsp;

�How are you so sure, pita?�

&nbsp;

�You are able to know my mind,
Sir. I know yours just as well.�

&nbsp;

He guessed that her strength came from caution learned through
disappointment. She had been lied to and used, a phenomenon familiar to submissives. Each day she asked him if he was coming for
her; she, too, was afraid to hope. He knew how she felt.

&nbsp;

When he arrived, she would know he was serious. Real trust
didn�t just leap into the heart. It took time, together. Once, she worried about
her inexperience with BDSM. �I played with a flogger once,� she told him. �But
it was just a toy Philip got at Spencer Gifts.�

&nbsp;

�Did you like it?� he asked.

&nbsp;

�Yes, but I wonder if it would be painful with a real one, enough
that I would be frightened and ruin it.� 

&nbsp;

�It can be painful, and sensual. How you react depends a lot
on how your top handles it,� he told her. �And fear is part of the experience
and pleasure.�

&nbsp;

�Sure,� she admitted. �But there�s fear, and then there�s
panic. What would you do if I panicked? Or,� she added as an afterthought,
�tried to fight you off.� 

&nbsp;

�The first times you have a safe word,� he said, �and I�d calm
you if you started to panic. 

&nbsp;

�And resistance,� he told her, �can be fun. If I didn�t want
you to resist, I could restrain you. But when you use your safe word,
everything stops immediately.�

&nbsp;

The banter was gone from her voice. �How would I know,� she
asked, �that you would listen?�

&nbsp;

�Pita,� he said, �At this point, you have to trust your instincts.
I�ll challenge you, but I won�t push you too far � you will need to take a
chance on me.�

&nbsp;

�Oh, I know that.� Now she was
animated again. �I want to believe it.�

&nbsp;

Her words rushed. �It�s hard to believe the words men use with
women. If my family life with my father and then Philip wasn�t enough, I
constantly see men lying: waiters with insulting excuses, married customers who
claim to be single to the women with them, who set off my crap detector while the
silly girl on his arm thinks �this guy is different,� not noticing he�s an
obvious jerk who will leave her crying just because he can. It�s disgusting.�

&nbsp;

He waited. She said: �I�m sorry.
You didn�t deserve all of that.�

&nbsp;

�You needed to say it,� he said. �And I know I have to earn
trust. I won�t lie to you, pita.�

&nbsp;

�I don�t think you will,� she
said. She paused and said sheepishly. �You look honest and I believe your
face.� 

&nbsp;

Joe peered into the cam with a raised eyebrow � he knew how
he was looking, and �honest� was not in his aging face � he reached for his
glass of soda without comment and took a sip.

&nbsp;

He said: �My question is whether you want submission and
will obey.� 

&nbsp;

�And what sort of faith do you
need to trust me?� she asked. She was not sarcastic.

&nbsp;

�We both need actions, not more
words.�

&nbsp;

He was on a plane to her now because he needed her to take
action toward trust. His plan was simple. She knew his flight number, and that
he was eager� but she didn�t know where they were going. 

&nbsp;

He hadn�t told her they would stay in Orlando,
but he had let her assume it. The fact was that she was ticketed to return to New
 England with him for the week.

&nbsp;

She wouldn�t expect it; if she wanted an excuse to back out
she would have one. But if she was willing to risk trusting him enough to step
onto the plane � in that instant ... their lives could move ahead rather than
trickle out into the dry streambeds of her desperate divorce and his empty
heart. 

&nbsp;

They both needed to free themselves from the quiet despairs
haunting them. Since Mattie�s death over two years earlier he had resisted his
personality�s insistence that someone should be in submission to him. �He called her as his plane reached the gate. 

&nbsp;

�Are you here, Sir?�

&nbsp;

Doubt springs eternal. �You�re
ready to leave? Dressed as I said?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, my Joe.� Her voice was
even softer than usual, and there was a quiver.

&nbsp;

�You�re frightened, pita.�

&nbsp;

�Not much, Sir.�

&nbsp;

She took a breath. �I�m worried about work, I guess. And about Philip. A little, Sir.� She
was afraid of her ex-husband, a self-absorbed bully who once threatened to
�keep her.� There was a restraining order and he wouldn�t come to the house. 

&nbsp;

Joe just assumed that pita was not only wondering about Philip
but about himself, too. It would be strange if she didn�t wonder if he was just
another belligerent and ego-centered tormentor who wanted to keep her weak. 

&nbsp;

They would have to learn to trust. But they could do only
one thing at a time.

&nbsp;

He reviewed the call forwarding for her phone with her. He
made her hang up and then called her house so she could see it would forward to
the cell phone he had sent. He reassured her. He told her to meet him and to park
in the long term lot; when she started to ask why, he interrupted: �Because you
trust me, pita. It�s what I want you to do.�

&nbsp;

She was to meet him at the Southwest ticket counter, traffic
willing, in forty-five minutes, where he would locate her. �Call me if you
can�t be on time,� he said. �Now that I�m here I�m feeling responsible.� She laughed
nervously. He could hear her breathe. She was not hanging up. 

&nbsp;

�I want you, pita,� he said and talked to her. He felt her
relax and was smiling when he closed the phone and clipped it to his belt.

&nbsp;

He walked down the concourse to the terminal area for
Southwest. He spoke with a skycap, a small black man who was eager to please,
and who became even more obliging when Joe handed him two twenty-dollar bills along with a plain, white
envelope. The skycap�s eyes were attentive as Joe gave instructions. The black
man nodded enthusiastically.

&nbsp;

The little man�s eagerness had Joe smiling when he turned to
look for the bartender in the VIP lounge. This time, he passed three twenties to
the pretty Asian woman as he related his instructions. He pointed to a table
with a chair facing the large windows looking out on the concourse. When he
left the lounge, he took an escalator to the mezzanine where he could look down
on the main floor to wait for the nervous submissive to arrive. He saw the
bartender put a �reserved� sign on the table he had pointed out to her.

&nbsp;

He watched the travelers. For as long as he had been aware
of his attraction to BDSM, Joe H-for-Harrison Wilson had played with people-watching to guess which were in �the life� or
might want to be. He knew it was a pointless excuse to watch for women who
would like life beneath the whip. Mattie had often teased him about it. When a
tall redhead walked into the terminal, his heart spiked, but then he realized
she was all wrong. She walked up to a young man and embraced him; when they
separated, the man stroked her bottom, but she stiffened, obviously not approving
his possessive touch. 

&nbsp;

Joe recalled awkward moments with pita. �She was thrilled by fantasies she had enjoyed
privately for years but never discussed; the idea of realizing them made her insecure.
�Do I have to give up all of my limits?� she wondered to him.

&nbsp;

�I want to know your hard limits,� he said, �and I want to
know what you think are soft limits. What I won�t accept is the idea of
no-limit play. That might come later, or never.�

&nbsp;

Her constant fear wasn�t pain. She was self-conscious about
nakedness. He reassured her. She sent pictures. He reassured her again. �

&nbsp;

She said, �I worry about you seeing me naked. You say you
think I�m beautiful, but I don�t feel beautiful, I feel fat.�

&nbsp;

He pushed a little: �Since this is so important for you,
maybe I should challenge you when we meet.� She laughed, as if he were joking.

&nbsp;

�You are beautiful. If you are
collared, it will be because you accept what I see.� 

&nbsp;

But even when she was frightened, she wanted to submit. �I
want to accept what you want from me,� she told him one night, late enough that
the crickets had become quiet outside his window. When he asked her about her fear
of exhibition and public play, she told him: �I don�t want to give you a list. I
want you to help me break down my limits and beat my defenses. 

&nbsp;

�My fantasies and fears control me now; I don�t want them to
limit me anymore.�

&nbsp;

Unlike many, who had a list of �requirements� they brought
out even before they showed they had a desirable service to offer, pita never
tried to �interview� him. She planned, she said, to offer �complete submission,
ownership, and obedience, if you offer me your collar and teach me. I mean if,�
she added, �I love you once we�re together, and accept the collar.�

&nbsp;

�If I offer it, little one,� he had said, �the collar will
be temporary. We need time before we make a collar permanent.� 

&nbsp;

�But the �love� part isn�t necessary. It will be enough for
me to own you, and for you to obey.� 

&nbsp;

His fear, though he hadn�t talked about it, concerned her
drinking, which seemed to occur a couple of nights a week. One night when she was
tipsy, she said she didn�t like it.

&nbsp;

He asked, �So why do you do it?�

&nbsp;

�What are you like when you
drink?� she asked him, avoiding his question.

&nbsp;

�Other than a little wine with a meal, I rarely drink,� he
said, and she changed the subject. He had dealt with alcoholism and, even more
than love, it was nothing he wanted to try again.

&nbsp;

Joe abruptly returned his attention to the crowd moving
beneath the mezzanine, and this time he saw pita, directly in front of the
Southwest ticket counter. He gripped the railing as his breath caught. She was
tall, her red hair a light to his desire, stunning. She looked confident,
intimidating to men who preferred �perky� women or waifs. She did not look
submissive, whatever that meant; in fact, on occasion he�d heard the ferocity
in her beauty and called her �little red tiger.� 

&nbsp;

But beneath the bravado, her core was vulnerable and pure. Right
now she was looking for him. She didn�t notice, or ignored, the glances and
outright stares she excited from men, and from some women, around her. 

&nbsp;

He had told her to wear the dark green dress he�d sent. The
skirt swirled silk each time her body turned right or left to look for him.
Every few seconds she touched her choker, black cords with a heart-shaped
padlock and a tubular sterling pendant engraved in script with her name:
�pita.� He had sent it months earlier. 

&nbsp;

The eager skycap hurried up to her. He handed pita the
envelope Joe had given him. He said something, hopefully what Joe had told him
to say: �your Sir wants you to read this.� She looked confused. As the little
man scurried away, she opened the note and caught the plane ticket as it fell
out. Pita read the note, then looked around
frantically. 

&nbsp;

She was thoroughly surprised and confused and looked ready
to cry. Joe pressed the speed dial, then her cell phone was ringing, and she
pressed her bag against her stomach so she could get at it, her hair getting in
her way. She nearly dropped the phone. 

&nbsp;

�Hello pita,� he said, his voice calm and steady.

&nbsp;

A middle-aged businessman walking past noticed her cleavage,
kept on going but looked back at her. Joe saw the lace on the merry widow in
the plunge of her dress, and he knew pale green garters were holding up her
lacy stockings. She looked delicious.

&nbsp;

�Sir, where are you?� Her voice
was bordering on shrill.

&nbsp;

�I�m here, pita. Don�t be frightened. I�ll take care of
you.� The familiar phrases settled her voice a little. 

&nbsp;

�Sir, I can�t leave �.� 

&nbsp;

He interrupted her gently. �Be still, pita. Listen to me.�
He could see her fidget and then bite a fingernail. �Take a deep breath and let
it out, pita.

&nbsp;

�Are you listening?�

&nbsp;

�Yes,� she said, �Sir.�

&nbsp;

He felt his own tension. �You want to belong to me,� he
said. �To please me.�

&nbsp;

�Sir, this is crazy. I have work
and Lexi. Someone could recognize �.� Her voice fell
off.

&nbsp;

�OK, pita. I have made arrangements for your daughter with
Dawn. And leaving with me isn�t as dangerous as staying here. If we remain
here, someone you know will be likely to see you.� He took a breath. �You know I�m
thorough, so I�m done explaining. You have a choice to make.

&nbsp;

�On the left side of the ticket counter there is a door to a
VIP lounge. Go in. Sit down, and I�ll call. You can decide then.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Sir,� she said and started
to close the phone.

&nbsp;

�And pita,� he caught her. �You
look fantastic.�

&nbsp;

�Thank you, Sir.�

&nbsp;

�Do you have a bra or panties
on?�

&nbsp;

�Just the
corset, Sir, like you told me.�

&nbsp;

�Quit chewing your fingernails,
pita.�

&nbsp;

Through the large windows along the concourse, Joe could see
into the VIP lounge. The only two people there were businessmen in love with
their cell phones. When she entered and went to a table, one, a tall blonde man,
watched her closely. She fidgeted in her chair, with her hair, nibbled at a
fingernail. Joe waited for the bartender.

&nbsp;

She was skittish, full of spirit and intelligence, easily
bored and needing constant challenge to keep her attention and interest. She
was challenged now.

&nbsp;

Pita stood up quickly and walked toward the bathrooms. The
watchful businessman�s eyes followed her high heels and the dark seams of her
stockings across the hard floor. Joe�s pulse followed the sway and flip of her
dress hem and, knowing she wore nothing beneath but a seafoam
green corset and the stockings, his breath caught again. He had an urge to be
waiting as she came from the restroom, to catch her by surprise � to grasp her
hands and hold them hard against the wall above her head, to grind his mouth
against hers, to push his tongue between her lips. He took a step.

&nbsp;

A dark door in the back of his mind opened, and the dream he
had told her about, which he had not been able to recall, fell into the light of
awareness with a rush of detail. He stopped where he was, imagery surging. He
was behind her, reaching for her arm and spinning her around. He was closing
his arm tight around her waist. Strangers were rushing by. She looked up at
him, her mouth silently shaping words. He grabbed her arms and clamped them to
her sides and pulled her against him. 

&nbsp;

Impassioned and aggressive, she leaned into him, pressing
her mound against his thigh, and her hand suddenly cupped him. He knew he was
hard, and startled. She whispered into his mouth: �Please Sir. I need you to
fuck pita.� 

&nbsp;

The surge of images and emotions stopped Joe in his tracks. When
his head cleared, pita was out of the bathroom and nearly back to her seat. He
watched the bartender approach and steer her to the table he had selected where
he would be able to see her. The pretty Asian woman placed a napkin in front of
pita and offered to bring a drink. Pita nodded and held two fingers out,
parallel to the table top. 

&nbsp;

Joe cringed. The gesture was the same Mattie had used to
order doubles. The last time he had seen the gesture, he had told her to quit
drinking for the night. She became wildly angry and rushed out the kitchen door.
Anger and fear surged in him, then pulled back. It hadn�t
been his fault.

&nbsp;

Pita was settled, her cell phone next to her hand on the
table, and the bartender brought her order, tall and dark in the glass, likely her
favorite Pepsi and Cap�n Morgan�s. Pita reached for
her purse and looked surprised when she did not have to pay. Two years had
passed since the last night with Mattie. He would only consider this pita, he
had told himself a hundred times. Dominance was one thing, and love was another.


&nbsp;

Pita finished rummaging in her purse and put it aside. The
blonde businessman approached, smiling broadly. When she noticed him, she
smiled back but then shook her head enchantingly at whatever he said.
Self-consciously she raised her left hand to the choker and Joe quickly understood
the gesture was a retreat to a touchstone, a talisman of comfort. His heart
warmed. The businessman smiled some more and left.

&nbsp;

He called her. She had the phone in her hand and answered it
immediately. �Where are you, Sir? I�m frightened.�

&nbsp;

�Nothing bad will happen, pita.
Be patient.�

&nbsp;

�I don�t feel so well, Sir.�

&nbsp;

�Breathe deep and slow, pita. Say your mantra, three times,
slow.� He could hear her reciting the poem and saying his name.

&nbsp;

When she finished, she said:
�Where are you, Sir?�

&nbsp;

�Who was the man you were
talking to, pita?� 

&nbsp;

�Please let me see you, Sir.�

&nbsp;

He didn�t answer. After a pause, she said: �I think he liked
me, Sir.� She was not so frightened that she forgot to tease him as usual. He
could feel a smile in her voice. �He wanted me to go to lunch.�

&nbsp;

�Did you want to?� She needed to
be distracted.

&nbsp;

�You know I don�t �.� Her tone
was serious now.

&nbsp;

�All of this stress and teasing.
Are you aroused, pita?�

&nbsp;

She was silent, and he watched her shift in her chair. �A
little bit, Sir.� She drew a breath. �I want you, Sir.�

&nbsp;

He took a breath of his own. �Let me answer some of your
questions, pita �

&nbsp;

�You won�t need many clothes, but I�ve brought things for
you. If I forgot something, I will buy it later.

�

�I�ve spoken with Stephen at the
restaurant. He is prepared for you to be gone a week or more.

&nbsp;

�At eighteen, Lexi probably doesn�t really need any one, but Dawn has
agreed she can stay with her. She is picking her up at the high school today.

&nbsp;

�Are you listening, pita?�

&nbsp;

She was quiet for a heart beat.
�Sir, it�s amazing.�

&nbsp;

�Pita, if you want, you can turn around to go back home. That
way your fantasies remain imaginary. Or you can get on the plane with me. If
you use the ticket, you trust me with your safety, but your dreams have a
chance.

&nbsp;

�It�s time to decide.�

&nbsp;

She let silence hang between
them. 

&nbsp;

Her answer came slowly and thoughtfully. �I want you, Sir. I
want to be owned, possessed, cared for. By you. And I want to serve.�

&nbsp;

He found he�d been holding his breath. He let it go. �In ten
minutes go through security, and go to gate B5. You are in the �A� group. Stand
by that sign when you get to the gate. Take a seat in the back of the plane and
save the aisle seat for me.�

&nbsp;

She didn�t say anything. �Do you
understand?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Sir,� she said.

&nbsp;

�Does thinking of the next week excite
you?�

&nbsp;

�Yes,� she breathed, �Sir.�

&nbsp;

�Check with
your fingers, pita. Are your nipples hard?�

&nbsp;

�Here, Sir?�

&nbsp;

�Now, pita.�

&nbsp;

She looked quickly around the room and raised her free hand
to one breast and then to the other. From the mezzanine he could see the green
silk momentarily wrinkle. He could hear her inhale through the phone.

&nbsp;

�Yes, Sir.�

&nbsp;

�Do you want me to come to you?�

&nbsp;

�Oh, yes Sir, I do.� 

&nbsp;

�Do you have any questions,
pita?�

&nbsp;

There was a pause.� �Where am I going?�

&nbsp;

�With me, pita.� He closed his
phone and went down the escalator so he could follow her. 

&nbsp;

Pita�s body relaxed as she walked. She touched the choker,
and he could feel his pulse throb with hers. She looked for him in the crowd as
she drew glances from men. At gate B5, sunlight flooded the waiting area, and her
auburn hair glowed in the late-morning sun through the windows. 

&nbsp;

He still was not at all sure pita would come with him � or,
if she did, that she would stay. Joe felt his heart steel. He wanted her to
come, but without promises, without softening the magnitude of what they were
doing and what he wanted of her. He wanted her to come, not because she thought
she was in love with him but because she wanted to find out about herself, and
him, and if she had the heart of a slave.

&nbsp;

He stood across the concourse. She looked over her shoulder,
right and left. A teenage boy maneuvered behind her, transparently adjusting
his angle for a close-up glimpse of her breast pressing against the side of her
dress. 

&nbsp;

When the boarding began, she moved toward the entrance, and
he felt his heart leap. He hadn�t realized how uncertain he had been. He went
to a kiosk and bought a pink rose, then moved forward to board at the end of
the line.

&nbsp;

He had to bend to keep from hitting his head. When he got
close to her seat, he first saw the auburn sheen of her hair and a glint of sun
off her choker. His hands felt clammy gripping the flower. He smiled grimly and
whispered, �Here we go, pita.� She had been looking down sadly at the ground
crew, but she glanced up and knew him immediately. Her face went momentarily
pale, tears came to her eyes, and she staggered to get out of her seat. 

&nbsp;

�Oh Sir, I thought you weren�t coming.� He reached down, put
the rose in her outstretched hand, closed his fingers over hers tightly, and
gently pressed her back into her seat. She didn�t look at the flower.

&nbsp;

�Let me put my bag up and I�ll hold you.� She was smiling and
on the verge of tears. Joe folded his jacket to fit in the overhead and took a
blanket. He lifted the chair arm between their seats and put his arm around
her. She tilted her head eagerly and kissed him. 

&nbsp;

The energy he felt in her lips was her tension letting go:
fear, joy, waiting, fantasy, and planning came together in her kiss. He tasted
the salt of her tears. Gradually her lips relaxed, and her cool palm, damp from
nerves, came up against his cheek. 

&nbsp;

When he drew back, she looked down at the rose and
unclenched her fingers; she had been gripping it tightly, and the thorns had
punctured her fingers. Three tiny drops of blood were gathered. �It�s pretty,�
she said. 

&nbsp;

Joe plucked a petal from the
flower to wipe away the specks of blood. 

&nbsp;

�Even the thorns,� he said.

&nbsp;

She began to babble, embarrassed, gesturing with her hands. Her
eyes were full. The stewardess stopped beside them: �Are you alright, Ma�am?�

&nbsp;

Pita looked up, surprised to see someone there. �Yes, she�s
fine,� Joe reassured the stewardess. �We�re just excited.� 

&nbsp;

Pita began to giggle, then said �May I have something, Sir?�
He nodded and placed a drink order. The stewardess gave her professional smile.
Joe unfolded the blanket and spread it across pita, pulling it up to her
breasts. She was chattering, replaying everything as if he hadn�t been watching.
�

&nbsp;

Beneath the blanket he held the inside of her wrist. �Hush,
pita,� he said in her ear. Then, �Be quiet, pita,� as she continued to babble, and
finally he gripped firmly and said �Shut up.� She jumped but was quiet. He took
the rose and inserted it in the seatback pouch in front of her.

&nbsp;

�Put your head on my shoulder,
pita. Whisper your mantra.�

&nbsp;

He heard her recite with her soft, southern lilt close to
his ear. He felt her breath settle against his cheek and felt a familiar,
direct connection between her voice and his sex, but for the first time in
person. 

&nbsp;

�When you�re calm, tell me anything you�d like.� But since you haven�t flown lately, maybe
you�d like to look out for the takeoff.� He rotated his thumb slowly over the quick
pulse in her wrist, then down into the palm of her hand, continuing the slow
stroke that would calm her. 

&nbsp;

When she was breathing evenly against the side of his
throat, he moved his hand onto her leg beneath the blanket and began to stroke her
stocking. He moved his fingertips in small, slow circles. 

&nbsp;

When the plane taxied and lunged into the air, they were
pressed back into their seats, but he continued to demand her attention and
moved his hand up her leg. Joe felt her thigh twitch, as if she was surprised.
But her eyes were shut and she was focused on his touch.

&nbsp;

�You didn�t get to see the take
off,� he said.

&nbsp;

�Your hand is cold,� she whispered. �Put it between my
legs.� He felt the lace on her stocking and the garter. She didn�t move her
head from his shoulder but went back to slowly whispering the mantra, her hot
breath on his skin, sometimes repeating a line as her mind got lost. 

&nbsp;

When he lifted the hem of her skirt and drew it up, she
tensed. He took it to her waist. Beneath the blanket, her sex was bare, and she
must have felt vulnerable, but pita did not question him and settled against
his arm. He felt the hardness between his legs.

&nbsp;

The stewardess returned with iced tea and rum in Pepsi for
her. Only his tray was lowered, so pita filled his cup while he continued to
stroke her. He let his hand wander, trailing light
touches from the inside of her knee over her smooth stocking and her taut
garter to the softness of skin he couldn�t see. The occasional spasm of muscles
continued; he decided it was a sexual response. 

&nbsp;

She shifted her body down in the seat and spread her legs.
She spoke rarely, and slowly, and when his hand neared her sex, she shifted her
body toward his touch. She moaned softly with almost every stroke and pushed herself
to his fingers. 

&nbsp;

He turned his head and whispered
into her forehead. �Tell me, pita.�

&nbsp;

�Sir,� she said, haltingly, �I
want you.� 

&nbsp;

He continued the maddening strokes. She was trying to move onto
his fingers. She cooed, �Sir � Sir � Sir, please.� Her muscles jumped again. 

&nbsp;

�Tell me, pita.�

&nbsp;

�Sir, touch me. Please, I�m so
turned on.�

&nbsp;

His voice was a growl: �Tell me what
you want.�

&nbsp;

Her breath was choppy in his ear. For a few seconds she
didn�t answer. Her thigh flinched again. Then finally in a rush she said:
�Touch me � my clit, o god, my, everywhere, go inside. Make me come.� 

&nbsp;

He stopped.

&nbsp;

�Sir, for god�s sake, please,
Sir.�

&nbsp;

He breathed passionately into her mouth. �When I touch my
pussy, I want you to come. I�m going to fuck you with my fingers right now and for
the next week with my cock. �We will see
if you can learn to be Mine.� 

&nbsp;

He touched her intimate, slick flesh, and her entire body
jerked and pressed against his hand. He pushed, and his finger slid easily between
her wet lips and found moisture. Her clit was small, slick, and rigid. As it passed
beneath his touch, pita jerked. He approached her entrance and placed the tip
of his finger just inside. 

&nbsp;

Joe adjusted his posture. He drifted his fingers over her
perineum and stroked the soft, damp skin. He wondered if her skirt would be wet
when she stood. 

&nbsp;

He took a handkerchief from his pocket and moved it beneath
the blanket and gently wiped her sex. Even the soft cloth seemed to shock her
into greater arousal. He relished her eager sexuality. He pressed the piece of
cloth between her legs and slowly swirled his finger back up her slit.

&nbsp;

She laid her hand on his thigh, then
tightened her grip. Her other hand clenched the armrest of her seat. The bright
light of the sky outside the plane fell across her wrist and showed her
knuckles white from her tight grip. 

&nbsp;

He returned to her clitoris and rested his finger on it for a
slow count of ten. Pita turned to whisper in his ear: �Sir, please. Let me
come. Touch me, Sir.� And he began to tap, maddeningly, against her clit,
bringing her lust up another level. Each time his finger tapped, she mewled
softly �oh, ohh, ohhh,
oh�.� and her muscles clenched. 

&nbsp;

She pressed her pussy forward again, and this time he
pressed down on her mound. He wanted her to come to relax her, if he could, but
he had heard her abandonment before, and he didn�t want her to be embarrassed. 

&nbsp;

The pressure was enough, and when he slowly rotated his
finger over her clit, her orgasm released, intense but silent. He watched her
bite down on her lower lip, heard her inhale hard, and watched her breasts lift
as she swallowed air to stay on top of her come. When she let it out, she slumped
against him; he lifted his finger. Joe took the handkerchief from between her
legs. 

&nbsp;

In a moment she said, �Sir��

&nbsp;

She stopped. �Yes?� he asked.

&nbsp;

�You�re already training me,
aren�t you?� 

&nbsp;

�The week will be short,� he
said.

&nbsp;

�I�m thinking,� she paused, �that was very public and I�ve
never done that. I�m wondering how hard you�ll beat me. And if you�ll decide to
give me to a Dom.�

&nbsp;

�You mean you wonder if I�ll respect
the limits we talked about?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Sir,� she said quietly.

&nbsp;

�Changing from online to real life opens everything up,
doesn�t it?� he said. �When limits are online, they are like fantasy. In life
it�s all real. 

&nbsp;

�It�s my job,� he whispered, �to challenge you and your limits
� to see if you want to grow and submit, not just in fantasies. Listen,� Joe
said, turning so he could look into her eyes and hold her hands, �in a sense we�re
starting over, but I remember what you said.

&nbsp;

�I remember that exhibitionism was a soft limit, something
you would accept because it pleases me,� he said. �And I love to share your
beauty, so I will challenge you with it. 

&nbsp;

�But you said giving you to another dominant was a hard
limit, and so that is simply not possible under any circumstances � not necessarily
because I wouldn�t want it but because it is a limit � until you change your
mind. As for flogging, each scene is different, and I have to decide each time how
much is enough.� 

&nbsp;

�What if I can�t handle it?� she
asked.

&nbsp;

�You find it hard to believe me, don�t you? If you safeword, I will stop whatever we are doing. We will deal
with the problem.�

&nbsp;

She was quiet, looking in his
eyes for what was ahead.

&nbsp;

He continued, �I won�t tell you
everything. I won�t ask for permission.�

&nbsp;

�What if I don�t like it?� she
asked quietly.

&nbsp;

�Depends on what you mean by �it.�
We�ll deal with it then.�

&nbsp;

�How do you know what to do?�
she asked.

&nbsp;

He settled back into his seat and closed his eyes. �It�s in
the Dom�s Manual,� he smiled. �It�s all there. Now relax,
pita. Get some sleep.�

&nbsp;

Pita rested her head on Joe�s shoulder. He wondered if her
orgasm had stirred her up so much she wouldn�t be able to relax. But a moment
later he felt her head grow heavy, and her breath lengthened. The stress of
getting here had been intense, and she had done well. He reminded himself not
to hope for too much too soon. 

&nbsp;

Masturbation on a plane isn�t BDSM, and a little
exhibitionism under the drive of passion isn�t submission, no matter how shy
she thought she was.

Pita wanted love; Joe couldn�t trust it. The challenge of
D/s was enough. When he thought of love, images of Mattie flooded his mind,

handkerchief to his face. If the woman in the blue hat were still across the

his body. His breath was shaky, and he put the handkerchief back in his pocket.
He felt the plane enter its long descent.
