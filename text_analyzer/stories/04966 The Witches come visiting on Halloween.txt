The Witches Come Visiting on
Halloween

An erotic fable

&nbsp;

By Alfamann

&nbsp;

Part 1

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

It was the evening of Halloween and 33 year old Rachel sat
alone in front of her television. As she glanced outside through the lounge
window of her small, one bedroom Annapolis apartment she could see the sun
beginning to set on yet another day. She felt thoroughly miserable. In fact,
she didn�t think she had ever felt more alone and miserable in her whole life.
Her 12 year marriage had broken up four months ago when her husband confessed
he was having an affair with Anna, a woman 10 years her junior. It had
literally broken her heart.

&nbsp;

Since the break-up her life had been without meaning. From
Monday to Friday she struggled to find the enthusiasm to pull herself out of
bed and get to work on time. Her routine was mechanical and she was afraid to
deviate from this routine for fear she would not cope. The only emotion driving
her to get to work each day was her immense respect for her female employer,
Barbara, who was a millionaire property developer. Barbara was aware of
Rachel�s breakup and had been a huge support to her. In fact, Rachel felt if it
was not for the support of Barbara, and her faithful, best-ever friend, Julia,
she would not have had the strength to survive the ordeal. Unfortunately
Julia�s law firm had relocated her to Portland;
however they remained closer than ever. 

&nbsp;

On the weekends Rachel would lay in bed until after midday,
and for the rest of the time she would mope around her little apartment or try
and find solace on the internet. Rachel was reluctant to venture outdoors
unless she really needed to as her husband and his young girlfriend were living
less than two blocks from her apartment.

&nbsp;

Rachel was immersed in self-pity when she heard a knock on
the door. Reluctantly she pulled herself out of her favorite armchair and
shuffled to the front door. As she opened it a chorus of �Trick or treat,
Ma�am� rang out from four excited children standing on her porch, their faces
painted black and dressed in witches and skeleton costumes. Rachel had been
vaguely aware Halloween was approaching but it had not even registered that it
was tonight. She had no candy or cookies in the apartment, nor any small change
she could give the children.

�

Sadly she shook her head. �Sorry kids. I wish I could
oblige�.Next year I promise.�

&nbsp;

Feeling even more miserable she shut the door on the
disappointed children and shuffled back to her favorite armchair. She had only
just sat down when the knock on her door was repeated. Angrily she strode to
the door. She knew she was a miserly cow for having no treats for the kids, but
they had no right to keep pestering her. Grabbing the handle she jerked open
the door and prepared to launch an irrational tirade on the children. Instead
her mouth fell open in shock.

&nbsp;

Standing at her door were three witches. Except they were
not children. They were three adult female witches who stared at her with
emotionless faces. 

&nbsp;

For a long moment Rachel stared at them in total confusion.
She glanced up and down the street, but no one else was around. Just the three
witches standing in the semi-darkness of her front porch.

&nbsp;

�Aren�t you a bit old for trick or treating?� Rachel finally
mumbled.

&nbsp;

�Are you Rachel?� the eldest of the three witches spoke.

&nbsp;

�Yes.� Rachel was taken aback at how much the voice of the
oldest witch sounded like her boss, Barbara, from work. Rachel stepped closer
and tried to make out her features. She did resemble her female boss, but
something seemed different. �Is that you Barbara?� Rachel frowned.

&nbsp;

�No dear, my name is Wanda,� the oldest witch responded, but
showed no emotion.

&nbsp;

��Wanda�.the witch.
How utterly charming.� Rachel couldn�t help chuckling. The witch seemed like
her boss but perhaps she was mistaken. �So what can I do for you three ladies, umm,
I mean witches? I am afraid I do not have any treats.�

&nbsp;

�But darling, you are the treat,� sang the second witch.

&nbsp;

Rachel�s eyes opened wide in shock. She recognized the voice
of her best-ever friend, Julia. 

&nbsp;

�Julia�oh my heavens...what are you doing here? I don�t
believe it.� Rachel squealed excitedly.

&nbsp;

The second witch showed no reaction. Rachel was bewildered.

&nbsp;

�Julia? Speak to me. What�s going on?�

&nbsp;

�Darling, I am sorry, you must be mistaken,� responded the
second witch. �My name is Wilma.�

&nbsp;

Rachel shook her head in total confusion. What was happening
to her? She could not cope with this in her current state.

&nbsp;

�What do you want of me?� she pleaded. �Please go and leave
me alone.�

&nbsp;

But before Rachel could react the three witches pushed past her
and entered her lounge, closing the door behind them. Now that the witches were
in the brightness of her apartment she could get a better look at their faces.
Wanda certainly bore a striking resemblance to her boss, and Wilma looked so
much like her best friend, yet something left her unsure. She was so confused.

&nbsp;

�What do you want of me?� she repeated, �Why won�t you leave
me alone?�

&nbsp;

�We are going to make this a Halloween you will never
forget, darling. Trust us. You will definitely never forget the one Halloween
when the witches came visiting.� Wilma smiled.

&nbsp;

�Are you crazy?� Rachel exclaimed in frustration.

&nbsp;

�Yes dear, fortunately for you we are more than just a
little crazy.� The two eldest witches chuckled.

&nbsp;

�I have had enough of you three. Leave right away or I will
ring the police,� Rachel tried to sound firmer than she actually felt.

&nbsp;

The three witches continued to smile at her, and made no
attempt to leave. Exasperated Rachel strode to the phone in her kitchenette and
picked it up, but as she began to dial 911 she couldn�t help but notice that
the third witch was walking towards her. Rachel had not paid any attention to
this third witch up to now, and when she saw her features for the first time
she froze, and then put her hand over her mouth and let out a long slow sobbing
sound. Her eyes welled with tears. The third witch was the dead ringer of Anna,
the beautiful young woman who had broken up her marriage and now lived with her
husband two blocks away. Rachel began shaking and fought the urge to leap at
her and put her hands around her throat. �

&nbsp;

In a flash the eldest witch, Wanda, was at Rachel�s side,
and enveloped her in a comforting arm. �This is the third witch of our little
cauldron. Let�s call her Wendy, shall we.�

&nbsp;

�Wendy?� Rachel sobbed, �This bitch is the woman who took
my�.�

&nbsp;

Wanda put her finger over Rachel�s mouth, causing her to
halt mid-sentence. Wanda nodded at her knowingly, and then held her as the
tears flowed.

&nbsp;

Rachel felt strangely comforted by the strong supporting
arms of the witch. As she glanced up at her face she was sure that Wanda was
indeed her boss. Barbara had been so supportive of Rachel after the marriage
break-up, and had given her much more support than she could have expected from
an employer.� But it couldn�t be her. Her
boss, Barbara, was a self made multi-millionaire, who certainly wouldn�t go parading
around the streets dressed as a witch. It was all so confusing.

&nbsp;

While still comforting her, Wanda whispered into Rachel�s
ear, �Do you think our little Wendy needs punishing for her past deeds?�

&nbsp;

Rachel looked up in surprise. �Punishing? What do you mean?�

&nbsp;

�Wouldn�t you like to see her punished? Wouldn�t it make you
feel much better?� Wanda continued to whisper.

&nbsp;

Rachel glanced over at Wendy and again took in her features.
She was so sure it was the bitch, Anna. Yet she couldn�t be sure. She had only
met Anna on one brief occasion when Rachel had stormed around to her house and
confronted her over her affair with her husband. It had been an embarrassing
yelling match that had left Rachel feeling like a fool. 

&nbsp;

Her emotions welled up inside and threatened to overflow.
She wanted vengeance.

&nbsp;

�I want to see her punished,� Rachel murmured, although not
comprehending what form of punishment Wanda could be envisaging.

&nbsp;

The second witch, Wilma, came and stood beside Rachel and
Wanda, so that all three were staring at the very apprehensive face of the
youngest witch, Wendy. Rachel glanced into the eyes of Wilma, and again was
overcome with just how much she resembled her best friend, Julia. It was all
very unnerving, yet she felt strangely uplifted by the close presence of Wanda
and Wilma.

&nbsp;

Wilma put her hand on Rachel�s shoulder, alongside Wanda�s,
and then asked a question of Rachel that briefly blew her mind. �Would you like
to see her naked?�

&nbsp;

Rachel�s first reaction was one of total outrage, but then
the thought of seeing Wendy, or was it Anna, stirred sensations from deep
within her. As she gazed at the nervous features of Wendy she could not believe
that a part of her wanted to see her naked. She tried to rationalize this urge
by telling herself that it was a sense of revenge that drove these feelings.

&nbsp;

Rachel nodded affirmatively to Wilma, as she felt too
embarrassed to utter the word �yes�.

&nbsp;

Wilma smiled knowingly at Rachel, as if she knew all along
this is what she wanted. She then turned to Wendy. �Off with your clothes. We
want to see you totally naked.�

&nbsp;

�Please, no,� Wendy pleaded, �I will die from shame.�

&nbsp;

�Hush, little one,� reinforced the eldest witch, Wanda.
�Just do as you are asked without further question, or your punishment will be
far worse.�

&nbsp;

Wendy pouted her lip and looked as if she would cry, but
obeyed the two older witches. She removed her pointed hat, grasped the bottom
of her long black gown and with a deep sigh lifted it over head, revealing a
lacy black bra and panties. In a vain attempt to preserve her modesty she
turned her back on her two fellow witches plus Rachel, before reaching behind
her back and unclasping her bra.

&nbsp;

Wendy stood nervously dressed only in her panties, her arms
limp by her side. Rachel was feeling hot and flustered, with beads of sweat
gathering on her brow. Never in her whole life had she ever witnessed anything
like this, and she was frightened by the sensations she was feeling.

&nbsp;

�Off with your panties, dear,� Wanda was firm in her
command.

&nbsp;

Silently Wendy grasped the sides of her black panties and
lowered them to her ankles before kicking them off. She was now totally naked.

&nbsp;

�Turn around and let us take a good long look,� Wanda
insisted.

&nbsp;

Reluctantly Wendy turned to face them, one hand covering her
boobs and the other cupped over her pubic region.

&nbsp;

�Hands by your side, darling.�

&nbsp;

Wendy dropped her arms limp by her side. The sight of her
total nakedness literally took Rachel�s breath away, making her feel light
headed. Rachel was overcome with how tiny and fragile she was with no clothing.
She would have been only a few inches over five foot, and was slim with almost
no waist. Her small breasts were firm and milky white, and Rachel could not
help but notice how hard her nipples were. Even though she felt embarrassed to
do so, Rachel could not help lowering her gaze to Wendy�s crotch. Her pubic
hair was trimmed very short and shaven into a small triangle, which, along with
her slender build, only served to make her appear much younger than she really
was. 

&nbsp;

Rachel felt a hand on her shoulder directing her to a chair.
She sat and stared at the surreal sight before her. Wilma whispered a command
into Wendy�s ear, which made the latter blush with humiliation. Tentatively
Wendy shuffled over to where Rachel was seated, and stood less than two feet
away from her. Rachel could not believe it as Wendy then began to slide her
feet wide open, totally exposing herself. Rachel was pleased she was sitting
down as she was sure she would faint. The sight before her was totally
intoxicating.

&nbsp;

Wilma came and stood beside the chair, and slid Rachel�s
dress up to her hips. Rachel did not object, and in fact lifted her buttocks
slightly off the seat to assist Wilma to slide her dress up. Wilma than stood
beside a much embarrassed Wendy and whispered a further command. Wendy was
clearly even more humiliated and for a moment she just stood there, pouting
like a child. As her eyes met Rachel�s, she began to sidle forward, keeping her
legs wide apart. She was now so close Rachel could feel her body heat.

&nbsp;

Wendy reached her hands down to her own vagina, and
incredibly her tiny fingers pulled open her labia. From her seated position
Rachel could see the pink inner flesh, and she was fixated by the sight. Wendy
lowered herself down onto one of Rachel�s knees, holding her vulva open until
she was firmly seated. Rachel could feel the wet warmth of the kiss of Wendy�s
most intimate parts on her thigh. A part of her just wanted to reach out and
grab hold of the glorious naked waif on her knee, and she had to fight to
retain her self control. Rachel was totally confused by the emotions swirling
around within her head.

&nbsp;

�Do you want to touch her breasts,� Wilma whispered to
Rachel.

&nbsp;

Even though a part of her brain was screaming at her not to,
Rachel�s arms mechanical reached forward and cupped each of the small, firm
breasts. She could feel the rock hard nipples pressing against the palm of her
hand. Rachel squeezed hard, causing Wendy to let out a long, low groan of
pleasure. 

&nbsp;

Rachel could not believe how sexually aroused she felt. She
had been totally starved of sex since her disastrous marriage breakup four
months ago. Just as she felt she was losing her self control, Wilma lifted
Wendy from her vulnerable position, walked her to the middle of the room, and
bent her over at the waist. Wendy�s vagina was now totally exposed from the
rear, as was her tiny pink anus. Rachel felt it was one of the most erotic
sights she had ever seen.

&nbsp;

Wanda took off her long, pointed witch�s hat and to Rachel�s
astonishment reach inside it and produced a short, wispy riding crop. Wanda
beckoned Rachel to join her beside the hapless Wendy, and she obeyed without
question. Wanda placed the whip into her shaking hand.

&nbsp;

�You can now give her the punishment she deserves. You can
make it as hard and as long as you think necessary.�

&nbsp;

Rachel gazed spellbound at the whip, then at the milky
globes of Wendy�s buttocks. �I can�t whip her. I just can�t. It is not right.�
Despite her inner anger at Anna, she could not take it out on this delightful,
vulnerable creature.

&nbsp;

�But she wants you to whip her,� Wilma reassured. �She wants
it, she needs it, she craves it. Isn�t that so my littlest witch?�

&nbsp;

�Yes Ma�am� Wendy quietly responded.

&nbsp;

�You want me whip you?� Rachel could not believe what she
was hearing. �How could anyone want to be whipped?�

&nbsp;

�When I have been naughty I like to be punished. It makes me
feel good again.�

&nbsp;

Rachel shook her head in disbelief. She did want to punish
Wendy, and now she had permission to proceed. Rachel raised the whip above her
head and swung it down forcefully. The power of being able to punish someone in
this manner was electrifying. Despite the cries of pain from her hapless victim
Rachel crisscrossed her buttocks with a series of red welts. By the time she
had finished Wendy was sobbing like a baby.

&nbsp;

Rachel was breathing heavy as if she had run a marathon. Yet
she wasn�t tired. She was sure she had never felt so alive. As she stood there,
in a state of bliss, listening to Wendy�s subsiding sobs, Wanda stepped forward
and gently took the whip from her hand. �We want you to undress now, Rachel.
Totally naked. No questions please. This is not a time for questions or explanations.�

&nbsp;

Rachel looked into the soft eyes of Wanda, again taken with
how much the first witch resembled her boss. Slowly she began to undress
herself. She did have many questions, but she also knew that at this moment in
time everything felt right. Even when she was down to just her bra and panties
she did not hesitate, as she was afraid she would lose her nerve. Once she was
naked she fought the urge to conceal her private parts, instead letting her
hands fall to her side. It was totally humiliating to be standing naked in
front of these two witches that bore such an uncanny resemblance to her female
boss and her best friend. Yet she knew if she touched her vagina she would find
her labia swollen and damp. This thought made her blush, as if her audience could
read her mind.

&nbsp;

Both of the older witches moved in closer beside her. Poor
Wendy was still bent over at the waist, but she was peering at the scene from
between her legs. 

&nbsp;

�Open your legs, darling,� Wilma whispered.

&nbsp;

Rachel shut her eyes as she knew her little secret would
soon be revealed. Slowly she opened her legs until she could feel the cool air
on her vagina.

&nbsp;

�Wider, dear�

&nbsp;

Rachel obeyed, and held her breath for what she felt was the
inevitable. Soon she felt the hands of both witches gently touching her naked
skin. The feeling was electrifying. Firstly the hands wandered her abdomen and
legs, before caressing her breasts. She was proud of her 33 year old body. She
was several inches taller, and much curvier than Wendy, with her 34 inch, C
cup, breasts only having a slight sag. Nevertheless it was still incredibly
daunting, and humiliating, to reveal herself to the intimate touch of others,
especially to those of the same sex.

&nbsp;

When a hand from one of the witches brushed across her
clitoris it hit Rachel like and electric shock of pleasure. She involuntarily
sucked in a huge gulp of air. Again the hand grazed her clitoris, while at the
same time a set of hands began squeezing her buttocks.

Still with her eyes closed, Rachel opened her legs wider and
pushed down on the invading hands, willing them on.

�

But instead the hands withdrew and Rachel let out a groan of
disappointment. However when she opened her eyes she smiled with pleasure as
both Wanda and Wilma were undressing. She bathed in the intoxicating sight of
both women slowly disrobing from their witch�s clothing.

&nbsp;

Once Wanda and Wilma where naked they proudly paraded their
bodies before Rachel, making no attempt to conceal their breasts or pubic
region. Both had impressive bodies that were not evident when they had on their
witch�s garb.

&nbsp;

Wanda, her female boss look-alike, was built like an Amazon,
despite being in her late forties. She had broad shoulders, large full breasts,
and was so tall. Rachel could not get over her height.

&nbsp;

�You are so tall and beautiful,� Rachel mumbled to Wanda.

&nbsp;

�Thank you dear. I am five foot, eleven inches of total
woman,� Wanda giggled, but obviously self assured of her body.

&nbsp;

Rachel turned her attention to Wilma, her best friend look-alike.
Wilma was about the same height as Rachel but was carrying extra pounds.
However it suited her. She had round, full buttocks and a full chest of at
least 38 inches. But her most distinctive feature was her fully shaven pubs,
which left her large vaginal lips clearly visible. On her groin she was
tattooed with a small seductive snake.

&nbsp;

Wilma took hold of Rachel�s hand and with a mischievous grin
led her into the bedroom. Wanda finally rescued Wendy from her bent position
and followed them into the bedroom. Rachel felt like she was in paradise.

&nbsp;

Wendy was made to kneel at the foot of the bed and place her
hands behind her back. It was a pose that looked so submissive to Rachel, and
only served to ignite her passion further.

&nbsp;

Rachel was then made to lie on the bed on her back, and open
her legs. There was no hesitation from Rachel, and she strained her legs as
wide as she could. She knew that Wendy was staring straight up at her vagina
from the foot of the bed, and could see the passion burning in the young
woman�s eyes.

&nbsp;

Wilma and Wanda began to devour Rachel�s body with unbridled
vigor. While one witch nibbled and sucked on her nipples, the other attacked
her vagina, sticking her tongue deep into her vulva, while flicking her
clitoris with her thumb. Rachel lost control and several shattering orgasms
washed over her in quick succession before she began drifting off into a
blissful slumber. Her last memory was of a submissive Wendy still perched at
the end of the bed.

The Witches Come Visiting on
Halloween

An erotic fable

&nbsp;

By Alfamann

&nbsp;

Part 2

&nbsp;

Rachel awoke with her alarm ringing in her head. She had
been in a deep sleep which was rare since her marriage breakup. She sat up,
confused. Her bed was empty, apart from herself. There were no three witches: no Wanda, Wilma or Wendy. Rachel shook her head in
wonderment. It had been one hell of a dream. It seemed so real. She couldn�t
believe her subconscious was capable of conjuring up such a disturbingly vivid,
erotic dream. Her marriage breakup was clearly taking a toll on her mind. Yet
today she felt surprisingly invigorated, in stark contrast to her depressed
state of recent weeks.

&nbsp;

Once at work she found she had renewed enthusiasm for her
daily tasks, and her fellow workers were clearly surprised at her cheery
disposition. Late afternoon her boss, Barbara, turned up at work following a
series of downtown meetings. When Rachel glanced up and saw her enter the
office she could not help blushing. She knew it was stupid, but the dream was
so vivid. 

&nbsp;

�You are looking cheerful today,� Barbara enquired of
Rachel.

&nbsp;

�Yes Ma�am, I am thank you,� Rachel responded, still
blushing.

&nbsp;

�Great. Good night was it last night?�

&nbsp;

Rachel was flustered by the comment. �Yes Ma�am I guess it
was.�

&nbsp;

Barbara continued to stand at Rachel�s desk, staring at her
with intense eyes. Rachel looked at her boss in a different light. She had
never realized how broad her shoulders really were, and how tall she was. She
really was an attractive woman. Rachel began to squirm in her seat.

&nbsp;

Barbara broke the silence. �How tall do you think I am,
Rachel?�

&nbsp;

�Pardon,� Rachel was startled by the question.

&nbsp;

�A simple question of my employee.
How tall do you think I am?�

&nbsp;

�I don�t know Ma�am.�

&nbsp;

�Guess then,� Barbara persevered.

&nbsp;

�Umm, five foot eleven inches, Ma�am.�

&nbsp;

�Good guess. Right on the button.�
With that Barbara gave her an exaggerated wink and left the office.

&nbsp;

Rachel could not comprehend the conversation that had taken
place. Why had Barbara asked her to guess her height? And what an incredible
coincidence she was the same height as her dream look-alike, Wanda.

&nbsp;

Rachel found it difficult to concentrate for the last hour
of work. Barbara�s conversation had rattled her. As she prepared to leave the
building for home her workmate looked up and waved. �You have a great
Halloween, won�t you?�

&nbsp;

�What?� Rachel responded in shock.

&nbsp;

�Have a good Halloween. You did remember tonight is
Halloween?�

&nbsp;

�Of course,� Rachel tried to sound convincing, but she was
even more confused. She looked at the date on her watch. It was indeed
Halloween night. Talk about �groundhog day�. As she drove home she stopped into
the local store and purchased some sweets. If she was going to get a second
chance at Halloween she did not want to disappoint the �trick and treating�
children again.

&nbsp;

As soon as she entered her apartment she picked up her phone
and rang her best friend, Julia, in Portland.
Julia seemed delighted to hear from her and the two of them had a refreshingly
animated conversation. For the first time in a long while Rachel found herself
being positive in her comments to her best friend, and even apologized to Julia
for how negative she had been since her marriage breakup. Julia was even going
to be visiting Baltimore on
business and was going to be able to stay with Rachel for a few days, which
delighted them both.

&nbsp;

Just as they were about to finish the conversation Rachel
felt she had to ask something of her best friend. 

&nbsp;

�Julia, I know this sounds like a really dumb question, but
do you have tattoo?�

&nbsp;

Julia hesitated for a moment. �Well, actually I do. I have
only had it two weeks, but why would you want to know?�

&nbsp;

�It�s just that I had this really dumb dream. Don�t worry
about it. But the tattoo is not of a snake is it?�

&nbsp;

�Oh my goodness. It is. But how�..?�

&nbsp;

Rachel interjected breathlessly. �And it is on your groin,
on the left hand side, isn�t it?�

&nbsp;

Julia was clearly flabbergasted. �I don�t understand?�

&nbsp;

�Don�t worry, neither do I.� Rachel couldn�t believe it. She
would have loved to ask Julia if she had shaved pubs, but she suspected the
question would just about give her friend a heart attack. 

&nbsp;

After finishing her phone conversation Rachel sat down in
her favorite armchair and tried to take stock of what had been happening to her
life over the past 24 hours. She couldn�t even begin to make sense of the
incredibly erotic dream and the subsequent bizarre coincidences.

&nbsp;

She was startled out of her thoughts by a knock on the door.
When she opened it there were four smiling children, dressed in Halloween
costumes, and faces painted in black. �Trick or treat,� they giggled in chorus.

&nbsp;

�Rachel took a
double-take. They sure looked like the same four children who had come to her
door in her dream, but she couldn�t be sure. But it sure was another amazing
coincidence. She was so relieved that this time she did not have to turn them away empty handed, and their eyes lit up when she gave
each of them a very large handful of sweets.

&nbsp;

After farewelling the children Rachel returned to her seat.
She realized her heart was racing, as in her dream the three witches appeared
at her door only minutes after the four children. For many long minutes she
stared at the door. She felt ridiculous for actually expecting three witches to
appear at her doorstep on Halloween, but she so much wanted to capture the
magic of her dream again.

&nbsp;

She was so restless she stood up and began pacing the floor.
After fifteen minutes there was a knock on the door and Rachel felt as if her
heart was going to burst out of her chest it was beating so hard. Her palms
were sweating as she opened the door to reveal more young children �trick or
treating�. Rachel fought back her disappointment and managed a cheery smile as
she fetched the children sweets.

&nbsp;

She watched from the door as the children walked down the
stairs from her verandah and out the front gate. She couldn�t help herself from
staring up the street in both directions. But, of course, there were no three
erotic witches to be found. Disconsolately she was about to close the door when
she spied a lone female figure making her way up the road. 

As the person came closer she could make out the diminutive
figure of Anna, her husband�s lover (and Wendy the witch look-alike) dressed in
jeans and pink jacket with the collar upturned to protect herself from the
cold.

&nbsp;

Rachel�s first instinct was to slam the door shut but
something made her keep it ajar. She watched, entranced, as
Anna walked up the street, apparently unaware Rachel was watching her. When
Anna was opposite Rachel�s front gate she glanced up and seemed to be genuinely
shocked when she spied Rachel at her front door. Anna looked as if she was
going to rush on by, but then hesitated, stopped, retraced her steps and walked
the short distance up Rachel�s front path and up on to her verandah. For
several awkward moments the two women just gazed at each other uncomfortably.

&nbsp;

Finally Anna spoke, sounding nervous. �I know you hate me,
and you have every right to. What I did was selfish and unforgivable, and for
what it is worth if I could undo all the harm I have caused I would.�

&nbsp;

Rachel looked into Anna�s eyes and could see she was on the
verge of tears. The hatred she felt for the woman who had stolen her husband
somehow began to melt away, and with it a realization it was time to let all
the bitterness go and move on with her life. She tried to think of something to
say to her, but could not find the right words. Anna, having given her
heartfelt apology, turned to go on her way.

&nbsp;

�Do you want to come inside for a moment?� Rachel managed to
mumble.

&nbsp;

�Come inside?� Anna turned and was clearly shocked by
Rachel�s gesture. �No, I shouldn�t. I had better get going. I just wanted to apologize.�

&nbsp;

�Come on, it is warm inside,� Rachel persisted, �And I
promise I will not hurl abuse at you.�

&nbsp;

Both women smiled at the comment, and with a shrug Anna
accepted the invitation. Once inside Rachel poured a glass of wine while Anna,
still nervous, stood in front of the fire and removed her jacket. Anna accepted
the glass of wine gratefully but eyed Rachel suspiciously as if she was
expecting her to launch into a tirade of abuse.

&nbsp;

Rachel raised her glass. �Here�s to Halloween.�

&nbsp;

Anna raised her glass and touched it to Rachel�s. �To
Halloween,� she repeated, and then after an awkward pause added, �I cannot
believe you have been kind enough to invite me in like this and share a wine
with me. Frankly it is the last thing I expected.�

&nbsp;

It was the last thing that Rachel also expected. But she was
now feeling so driven by the surreal dream and bizarre coincidences that a
different force was governing her life. Rachel had this powerful feeling she
was at this very moment standing at the crossroads of her life and if she did
not seize the opportunity it would be lost forever.

&nbsp;

Rachel was so nervous she sat in her chair and took a large
mouthful of wine. Then she stared intently at Anna, trying to gauge if this
woman standing before her was in fact Wendy from her dream. She just couldn�t
be sure, although the similarities were unnerving.

&nbsp;

�Why are you staring at me like that?� Anna�s voice suddenly
sounded like a young girl.

&nbsp;

Rachel gulped down the rest of her wine. There was no
turning back.

&nbsp;

�I want you to undress for me.� Rachel tried to sound much
more confident than she felt.

&nbsp;

Anna�s eyes were suddenly like saucers. �You want me to do
what?�

&nbsp;

�I want you to undress. I want you as naked as the day you
were born.�

&nbsp;

�I can�t do that.� Anna whined.

&nbsp;

�I think you can, and I think you will.� Rachel was feeling
a little more confident. She took heart from the fact Anna had not taken her
coat and stormed out of the apartment.

&nbsp;

Anna pouted her bottom, which instantly brought back erotic
images of Wendy. 

&nbsp;

Anna stared at her feet and fumbled with her fingers.
�Please don�t make me.�

&nbsp;

�What item of clothing are you going to remove first?�
Rachel boldly pushed matters along.

&nbsp;

There was a long silence, with Anna continuing to stare at
her feet. 

&nbsp;

�My shoes,� she eventually mumbled.

&nbsp;

Rachel could not help but smile to herself. She had reached
the first hurdle, and the inner warmth growing in her body was pure ecstasy.
�Well, what are you waiting for? Take them off.�

&nbsp;

Hesitantly Anna bent down, unlaced her shoes, and removed
them.

&nbsp;

�What is next?� Rachel quietly commanded.

&nbsp;

�My socks,� Anna responded with little delay, and without
prompting she slipped them off and dropped them beside her shoes.

&nbsp;

�What is next?� Rachel was excited knowing Anna had to
remove either her top or her jeans next.

&nbsp;

Anna looked up at Rachel with doleful eyes. �Please don�t
make me go any further. Please don�t humiliate me like this.�

&nbsp;

�What is next, Anna?� Rachel asked a little more firmly.

&nbsp;

Anna hung her head again, and let out a long sigh. �My jeans.� 

&nbsp;

With that Anna fumbled with her belt, loosened it, and
unzipped the front of the jeans. She again looked up to Rachel with pleading
eyes.

&nbsp;

�Take them off.� Rachel tried to hide the excitement in her
voice. She could not believe her husband�s lover was actually undressing in
front of her. Surely she would not go all the way.

&nbsp;

Anna took hold of the skin tight jeans and did a little
dance as she struggled to lower them over her hips. A pair of plain white
cotton panties came delightfully into Rachel�s view as the jeans were
lowered.� Once they were at her ankles
she again struggled ungracefully to get them over her ankles. Anna�s neck was
flushed red with embarrassment as she finally kicked them off.

&nbsp;

�Next?� Rachel raised her eyebrow

&nbsp;

�My top,� Anna responded, and without delay she pulled it
over her head, revealing a simple white bra that matched the panties.
Instinctively she placed her hands in front of her.

&nbsp;

�Please keep your hands at your side.� Rachel could not
believe how confident she felt.

&nbsp;

�Yes, Ma�am,� Anna responded submissively, obeying the older
woman�s command.

&nbsp;

Rachel soaked up the sight of Anna in her underwear. She was
not surprised that Anna�s figure was a mirror of Wendy the witch. She was
beautiful but delicate, and undressed looked so much younger than her 23 years.


&nbsp;

�What will be next, Anna? The bra or
panties? Am I going to see your breasts first or your cunt?� Rachel
could hardly believe the words that were confidently streaming from her mouth.
She had never felt, or acted, this wicked before.

&nbsp;

�Please, please. Let me leave my underwear on or I will die
of shame,� Anna pleaded.

&nbsp;

�Shall I decide for you?�

&nbsp;

�No�I will take off my bra.�

&nbsp;

With that Anna reached behind, unclasped her bra, and let it
fall down her arms. Her first instinct was to cover herself, but remembering
Rachel�s instruction she lowered her arms to her side.

&nbsp;

Her breasts were just as Rachel had expected: small, very
firm, and with rivet-hard nipples. Rachel found them achingly beautiful and
couldn�t wait to feel them in her hands, but there would be another time for
that.

&nbsp;

�Time for the panties now, little lady.�

&nbsp;

Anna was clearly embarrassed and struggling to find the
courage to remove her last item of clothing. For a moment it looked as if she
was going to protest, but instead she reached her fingers under her waistband,
demurely sliding the panties to her ankles before stepping out of them.� When she stood up she revealed her closely
shaven, neatly trimmed, triangle of jet black pubic hair. Nervously she dropped
her hands to her side and revealed her naked beauty to Rachel. Rachel was a
very appreciative audience and soaked up the sight.

&nbsp;

The power of being dominant over someone in an erotic way
was incredibly intoxicating to Rachel, just as it had been in her dream. It was
uncharted territory for her but she wanted to explore the boundaries to the
absolute limit.

&nbsp;

�Anna, I am going to punish you severely for your part in
breaking up my marriage.�

&nbsp;

Anna bit down hard on her bottom lip.

&nbsp;

�And I think it is best if we get it over with now so that
it is dealt with.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Ma�am. It is going to hurt,
isn�t it Ma�am?� Anna was genuinely fearful.

&nbsp;

�Yes, Anna. I am afraid so.�

&nbsp;

Anna stood nervously, clenching her hands, and dancing from
foot to foot. Then she crossed her legs.

&nbsp;

�Please Ma�am, I think I need to go to the toilet.� Anna
pouted.

&nbsp;

Rachel could not believe how submissive Anna was to her. She
hated to admit it to herself, but the whole situation was arousing her beyond
belief. She prayed she would not wake up and find it was another dream.

&nbsp;

Without uttering a word Rachel took hold of Anna�s hand and
led her to the toilet. Anna entered and quickly squatted on the bowl, at the
same time leaning forward to close the door. Rachel stepped forward and
prevented the door from closing with her foot.

&nbsp;

�Are you going to watch me going to the toilet, Ma�am?�

&nbsp;

Rachel crossed her arms and nodded affirmatively, her eyes
bearing down on the nervous, diminutive figure of her naked companion. Anna�s
wide innocent eyes returned her gaze.

&nbsp;

For a long while Anna struggled to relieve herself in front
of an audience, but eventually there was the familiar tingle of pee trickling
into the toilet bowl.

&nbsp;

�Open your legs,� Rachel commanded.

&nbsp;

Anna obeyed without question, although she was clearly
incredibly embarrassed to be exposed in this manner while performing her
private toilet functions. Rachel stepped slightly closer so she could see down
into the bowl, and was captivated by the flow of urine being emitted by Anna.
Even this most basic of functions now seemed incredibly erotic. 

&nbsp;

When Anna had finished relieving herself she reached for the
toilet tissue, but Rachel took it from her. �Hop off the toilet and squat on
the floor so I can wipe you clean.� 

&nbsp;

�No, please Ma�am, I can�t do that,� Anna pleaded

&nbsp;

�Of course you can. Just do it. I don�t want to hear any
complaints or I will increase your punishment. You don�t want that, do you?�

&nbsp;

�No, Ma�am.�

&nbsp;

With that Anna raised herself off the toilet, stepped
forward, and squatted down.

&nbsp;

�Open your legs, silly. How can I wipe you with your legs
together?�

&nbsp;

Anna groaned in despair, but obeyed, opening her knees so
they touched each wall of the small toilet cubicle. Rachel took her time to
carefully fold the toilet tissue, then knelt down in front of her hapless
victim and wiped the tissue across her vagina. Anna groaned again. Rachel
repeated the task before flushing the tissue down the toilet, and then stepped
back to admire the sight of this young naked woman who was her husband�s lover.
She suddenly felt anger well up inside her, and she fought to retain her self
control. It was important to her that her actions were not controlled by
irrational anger.

&nbsp;

�You can stay here squatted in the toilet until I am ready
for you. It will give you time to reflect on how your behavior impacts on
others.� Rachel tried to take the anger out of her voice.

&nbsp;

Anna hung her head. �Yes, Ma�am.�
She sounded contrite.

&nbsp;

Rachel returned to her lounge. Once her anger had subsided
she called out to Anna. As this naked beauty entered the room Rachel was again
overwhelmed with her incredible youthful beauty, and could well see why her husband
could be attracted to her. 

&nbsp;

�Go and fetch my wooden spoon from the top drawer in the
kitchen,� Rachel directed.

&nbsp;

While Anna apprehensively went to fetch the wooden spoon,
Rachel busied herself clearing the candle holder and other odds and ends off
her small dining room table.

When Anna returned her eyes were looking downward, as if she
was too humiliated to look Rachel in the eye. Rachel left her standing there,
holding the wooden spoon.

&nbsp;

�When did you last have sex with my husband?� Rachel demanded

&nbsp;

Anna�s shoulders slumped forward. �I�I don�t remember,� she
stuttered.

&nbsp;

�Oh, I am sure you do. Don�t mess with me, girl.�

&nbsp;

�Ummm�I think it was two days ago,� Anna admitted nervously.

&nbsp;

�And how did he make love to you?�

&nbsp;

�Pardon?�

&nbsp;

�Simple question, Anna. How did he
make love to you?�

&nbsp;

Anna was again nervously entwining her fingers and stepping
from one foot to the other. �He took me doggie style.�

&nbsp;

�Did he indeed.� Rachel was put
out. Her husband had never made love to her like that in all their years of
marriage. �Get on the table, lying on your back,� she gestured grumpily.

&nbsp;

Anna looked up at Rachel anxiously, before reluctantly
taking the few small steps to the table. She jumped up onto it so she was
seated on the edge. 

&nbsp;

�Lie down,� Rachel demanded abruptly.

&nbsp;

Anna obeyed. The table was short and her head hung over the
opposite edge. Rachel took the wooden spoon from her.

&nbsp;

�Lift your knees up to your chest and hold them there.�

&nbsp;

Anna�s doe eyes pleaded with Rachel. �Please don�t make me
do this. Anything, but not this.�

&nbsp;

�Anna, I know exposing yourself in this manner is going to
take away any last vestiges of your dignity as a young woman,� Rachel lectured,
�But I want you to feel the shame and humiliation. Now lift up your legs.�

&nbsp;

Much to Rachel�s relief and excitement, her young victim
slowly lifted her legs up, bringing her knees in hard against her chest before
gripping them with her hands. She was now curled in a ball on the table,
totally exposed

&nbsp;

The sight of Anna�s vagina and anus totally exposed was
almost more than Rachel could bear. She felt incredibly excited and could not
resist the temptation to lightly stroke Anna�s labia. She was totally surprised
at how aroused the young woman was, and for the first time Rachel realized she
was not the only one sexually aroused.

&nbsp;

Rachel stepped back, and without warning brought the wooden
spoon down forcefully across Anna�s exposed, tight buttocks. Anna cried out in
shock and pain, but held her position. Rachel continued to rain blows down on
the reddening buttocks until Anna was sobbing uncontrollably, but to her
amazement the young woman bravely held her position. 

&nbsp;

Rachel finally stopped smacking her buttocks, and gathered
breath as she listened to the gentle sobs of Anna.

&nbsp;

�Now open your legs,� Rachel asked quietly.

&nbsp;

Anna obeyed without hesitation, splaying her knees wide
open. Her labia were so swollen and wet that her lips peeled apart, revealing
the pink, fleshy entrance to her vulva. Rachel admired the exquisite view
before bringing the wooden spoon down squarely on her vagina. Anna bucked and
instinctively closed her legs, but just as quickly splayed them open again.
Rachel delivered ten stinging blows to the much reddened pussy, and although
Anna was crying she was pushing her hips upward to receive each blow. Rachel
was full of admiration for the young woman.

&nbsp;

Rachel lay down the wooden spoon and knelt at the foot of
the table. She found herself drawn to the wet, red and swollen vagina, and
placed her tongue deep into Anna�s vulva. Rachel savored the taste of the young
woman and was pleasantly surprised at the unusual, but pleasant, taste of her
cunt juices.

&nbsp;

Anna groaned in ecstasy and began rotating her hips lewdly.
She came quickly and powerfully, her chest convulsing up and down causing her
tiny breasts to thrust skyward. 

&nbsp;

�My god, it was incredible,� Anna gasped, �Being humiliated
like that by another woman fulfilled my wildest fantasies. But how did you know
this is what I craved?�

&nbsp;

�Oh, it came to me in the night,� Rachel responded
obliquely, smiling.

&nbsp;

Suddenly there was another knock on the door. Anna was still
lying on the table top and glanced apprehensively at Rachel

&nbsp;

�You stay right where you are young lady. Keep those legs up
in position as I am not finished with you yet,� Rachel ordered.

&nbsp;

Rachel opened the door ajar just a few inches so Anna was
well hidden from view. She was shocked, yet again, to see her husband, Donald,
standing on her verandah. He looked none too happy.

�

Rachel raised her eyebrows enquiringly. �Donald.�

&nbsp;

�Honey. I�ve been such a fool. Can
you ever forgive me?�

&nbsp;

�What has happened, Donald?� Rachel responded cynically.

&nbsp;

�Anna and I had a row tonight and I think she has left me. I
am better off without the slut anyway. I realize you are my one true love,�
Donald groveled. �Can I come in so we can talk?�

&nbsp;

Rachel could not believe she had grieved for this man. 

&nbsp;

�Actually I am rather busy, Donald. I have company.� With
that Rachel opened the door just wide enough for her husband to see the naked
form of Anna exposed in all her glory on the dining table.

&nbsp;

As Rachel closed the door she was vaguely aware of a sobbing
Donald dry retching over the side of her verandah. 

&nbsp;
