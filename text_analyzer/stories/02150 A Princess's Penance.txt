&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;by
    Tom Justin 
The &nbsp;delicious &nbsp;aroma &nbsp;of &nbsp;roast &nbsp;pheasant &nbsp;and &nbsp;other
  succulent dishes filled the spacious dining hall of the royal palace as the
  serving maids bustled about setting heaping platters &nbsp;of &nbsp;food on
  the table before the seated nobility. King Charles II of Neufundland sat at
  the head of the table with &nbsp;his &nbsp;new &nbsp;wife, &nbsp;the &nbsp;former &nbsp;Lady &nbsp;Margaret &nbsp;Dupont &nbsp;of
  Chatsworth province. &nbsp;The guests included the King's brother, Prince &nbsp;Philip &nbsp;of &nbsp;nearby
  Glouchester, &nbsp;his wife, &nbsp;the Lady Isabel, and their two children,
  Eric and Dorothy. &nbsp;&nbsp;Also in attendance was &nbsp;the Royal &nbsp;Highness's &nbsp;Lord &nbsp;Chamberlain, &nbsp;Sir
  Horace Wilde, &nbsp;his wife, the Lady Beatrice, and the Duke and Duchess of
  Reddington with their two teenage offspring. 
At the opposite end of the table, a lovely young woman sat &nbsp;alone &nbsp;staring &nbsp;glumly &nbsp;at &nbsp;her &nbsp;plate. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She &nbsp;was &nbsp;King
  Charles's daughter, the Princess Lesley. &nbsp;At twenty-one years of &nbsp;age, &nbsp;this &nbsp;pensive
  beauty was &nbsp;at &nbsp;the &nbsp;full &nbsp;ripeness &nbsp;of womanhood. &nbsp;However, &nbsp;the
  young princess seemed ill at ease and it was not long before the dinner conversation
  shifted to her &nbsp;stepmother's &nbsp;favorite &nbsp;topic, &nbsp;and &nbsp;the &nbsp;reason &nbsp;for &nbsp;the
  girl's uneasiness. 
Prince &nbsp;Philip &nbsp;was &nbsp;the &nbsp;first &nbsp;to &nbsp;inquire &nbsp;about &nbsp;his
  niece's strange attitude. &nbsp;Queen Margaret was eager to reply as she calmly
  explained, &quot;My stepdaughter is doing penance for an indiscretion involving
  one of the grooms.&quot; 
The Lady Isabel gasped, &quot;Oh my! &nbsp;Was it serious?&quot; 
The &nbsp;Queen &nbsp;shook &nbsp;her &nbsp;head &nbsp;and &nbsp;replied, &nbsp;&quot;No, &nbsp;thank
  goodness. &nbsp;They were stopped before any real harm was done.&quot; 
&quot;What became of the groom?&quot; &nbsp;Lady Ashley, the Duchess of Reddington,
  asked. 
&quot;Oh. &nbsp;He was flogged in the courtyard, then sent to the colonies &nbsp;for &nbsp;a &nbsp;five
  year &nbsp;indenture.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen Margaret answered easily. &nbsp;&quot;I
  ordered it.&quot; 
King &nbsp;Charles &nbsp;chuckled, &nbsp;&quot;Yes. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My &nbsp;wife &nbsp;is &nbsp;quite &nbsp;the
  martinet.&quot; 
The Duke of Reddington, Sir Richard, who was the Queen's brother, &nbsp;gazed &nbsp;covetously &nbsp;at &nbsp;the &nbsp;slender &nbsp;figure &nbsp;of &nbsp;the
  Princess Lesley then commented thickly, &nbsp;&quot;I hope she didn't order
  the same for the princess.&quot; 
King Charles guffawed, &nbsp;&quot;By god, &nbsp;she was close to it. But &nbsp;I &nbsp;reasoned &nbsp;with &nbsp;her &nbsp;a &nbsp;bit. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, &nbsp;I'm
  afraid &nbsp;my daughter didn't get off &nbsp;lightly by any means. &nbsp;&nbsp;Since
  her mother died, I admit that I've neglected Lesley's upbringing so &nbsp;I &nbsp;must &nbsp;take &nbsp;some &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;blame &nbsp;for &nbsp;what &nbsp;happened.
  Therefore, I've entrusted Margaret with straightening out my mistakes.&quot; 
&quot;And how is she doing that?&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Richard asked, his
  eyes glistening with lubricity. 
&quot;I know only the whip.&quot; &nbsp;The Queen answered grimly. 
The Lady Isabel &nbsp;winced sympathetically then &nbsp;inquired, &quot;But
  surely not in public... I mean... not a flogging....&quot; 
Queen Margaret replied, &nbsp;&quot;Oh no. &nbsp;&nbsp;The scandal would be
  too great. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, &nbsp;inside the walls of &nbsp;this
  castle, &nbsp;My stepdaughter is learning the true meaning of discipline. &nbsp;For
  the &nbsp;next month, &nbsp;before she &nbsp;returns &nbsp;to Ruttenburg &nbsp;for
  her final year of finishing school, I am taking special steps to eradicate
  any unladylike behavior and to teach her obedience. In fact, &nbsp;I believe
  I promised Lesley a lacing today before company as a lesson in humility. &nbsp;Isn't
  that right dear?� 
In the awkward silence that stilled the dinner banter, all eyes now focused
  on the Princess Lesley. &nbsp;&nbsp;A warm blush pinkened the pale cheeks of
  the contrite beauty's lovely face as her downcast eyes contemplated the pattern
  of her dinner plate. &nbsp;Diverse emotions were evident in the watchful eyes
  of the guests, &nbsp;ranging from ribaldry and lust to distaste and compassion. &nbsp;But
  all were expectant as the demure young woman raised her bowed head. 
Though her face was flushed with embarrassment and her lower lip trembled,
  the girl's quiet voice never wavered as she answered levelly, &quot;Yes mother.&quot; 
The subtle tension between the young princess and her domineering stepmother
  was evident to those in the room. &nbsp;The former Lady Margaret was of German
  descent and felt that she was resented by the people of her husband's province
  as well as his daughter because of it. &nbsp;Princess Lesley had loved her
  mother &nbsp;dearly &nbsp;and &nbsp;was &nbsp;deeply &nbsp;saddened &nbsp;by &nbsp;her &nbsp;untimely
  passing. &nbsp;She had been upset by her father's marriage to the Lady Margaret,
  who was almost twenty years his junior, and had treated the new Queen coldly
  upon her arrival &nbsp;in the palace. &nbsp;The &nbsp;young &nbsp;woman's &nbsp;&nbsp;interrupted &nbsp;tryst &nbsp;with &nbsp;the
  stableboy had been more of an act of rebellion than one of unrequited &nbsp;love. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However, &nbsp;her &nbsp;prescribed &nbsp;penance &nbsp;at &nbsp;the
  hands of her vindictive new parent was very severe and in keeping with the
  Lady Margaret's strict German upbringing. 
The &nbsp;last &nbsp;serving &nbsp;maid &nbsp;was &nbsp;departing &nbsp;when &nbsp;the &nbsp;Queen
  called to her and said, &quot;Rowena. &nbsp;Ask Miss Simpson to come to the
  dining room, would you please?&quot; 
The &nbsp;young &nbsp;maid &nbsp;murmured, &nbsp;&quot;Yes &nbsp;Your &nbsp;Highness.&quot; &nbsp;then
  curtseyed and left. 
Queen Margaret &nbsp;cleared &nbsp;her &nbsp;throat &nbsp;and &nbsp;announced, &nbsp;&quot;We
  might as well get this bit of unpleasantness over with before we dine.&quot; 
The Princess Lesley glanced briefly at her stepmother then returned her eyes
  to the table, a frown of apprehension creasing &nbsp;her &nbsp;pretty &nbsp;forehead. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite &nbsp;her &nbsp;troubled
  countenance, &nbsp;the &nbsp;young &nbsp;noblewoman's &nbsp;beauty &nbsp;could &nbsp;not &nbsp;be
  suppressed by her unfortunate predicament. &nbsp;&nbsp;The girl's ash-blonde
  hair was beautifully coiffured in a soft upsweep with curls &nbsp;and &nbsp;ringlets &nbsp;at &nbsp;the &nbsp;sides &nbsp;and &nbsp;over &nbsp;her &nbsp;forehead.
  Highset &nbsp;cheekbones &nbsp;accented &nbsp;the &nbsp;pale &nbsp;oval &nbsp;beauty &nbsp;of &nbsp;the
  Princess Lesley's lovely face along with her widely-spaced, soft brown eyes
  and delicate Grecian nose. &nbsp;&nbsp;A full, sweet mouth whose corners sometimes
  showed a hint of impertinence betrayed &nbsp;the &nbsp;fervid &nbsp;temperament &nbsp;that &nbsp;had &nbsp;been &nbsp;the &nbsp;proud
  beauty's &nbsp;&nbsp;undoing &nbsp;&nbsp;and &nbsp;&nbsp;had &nbsp;&nbsp;earned &nbsp;&nbsp;her &nbsp;&nbsp;this &nbsp;&nbsp;impending
  chastisement. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A respectful
  knock on the dining room door was answered by the Queen Margaret with a sharp, &quot;Come
  in.� 
The door opened and a tall, &nbsp;forbidding-looking, black-haired woman appeared. &nbsp;&nbsp;She
  inclined her head slightly and said, &quot;You asked for me, Your Majesty?� 
The queen smiled grimly, &quot;Yes, Miss Simpson. &nbsp;Would you please &nbsp;go &nbsp;to &nbsp;my &nbsp;room &nbsp;and &nbsp;get &nbsp;the &nbsp;riding &nbsp;switch. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your
  services are needed here.� 
The dour matron nodded &nbsp;curtly and &nbsp;replied, &nbsp;&quot;Yes &nbsp;Your
  Highness.&quot; 
Before &nbsp;she departed, &nbsp;the &nbsp;stern-featured woman's &nbsp;cold,
  grey-blue &nbsp;eyes &nbsp;flickered &nbsp;briefly &nbsp;over &nbsp;the &nbsp;figure &nbsp;of &nbsp;the
  seated princess. &nbsp;And although her face remained impassive, a steely glint
  could be seen momentarily in her keen, closely-spaced eyes as she left. 
The Lady Jsabel of Glouchester regarded the foreboding vision of the departing
  servant and remarked with a shiver, &quot;Brrrrrr. .. Who's that?&quot; 
Queen Margaret smiled primly. &nbsp;&quot;That's one of the little additions
  I've made to the royal household. &nbsp;Miss Simpson was with me in Chatsworth. &nbsp;I've
  brought her along to take charge of things here. &nbsp;&nbsp;I was appalled
  by the lack of protocol and discipline I encountered upon my arrival.&quot; 
The Lady &nbsp;Isabel &nbsp;glanced &nbsp;briefly at &nbsp;King &nbsp;Charles &nbsp;then
  replied, &nbsp;&quot;I must say she certainly appears to be up to the task
  , whatever that may be.� 
Again the Queen smiled smugly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh yes. &nbsp;&nbsp;You might
  say she's &nbsp;whipping &nbsp;things &nbsp;into &nbsp;place &nbsp;nicely.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then &nbsp;with &nbsp;a
  searching look at her stepdaughter she added, &nbsp;&quot;From top to bottom.&quot; 
A slight blush warmed the Princess Lesley's pale cheeks at &nbsp;the Queen
  Margaret's &nbsp;last comment. &nbsp;&nbsp;Indeed, &nbsp;the &nbsp;former Lady
  Dupont of Chatsworth had a loyal and cunning ally in the dour Miss Simpson. 
Orphaned at a young age then brought up on an almost daily regimen &nbsp;of &nbsp;the
  rod &nbsp;by her stern fosterparents, &nbsp;Miss Simpson had come under the
  employ of the Lady Margaret when she was in her mid thirties. &nbsp;Having
  served under a series of harsh &nbsp;overseers &nbsp;in many a household while
  growing up, &nbsp;and with many a stroke of the cane or bite of the lash to
  her own bare backside for any shortcomings, the now forty-eight year-old &nbsp;Miss &nbsp;Simpson &nbsp;had &nbsp;much &nbsp;rancor &nbsp;in &nbsp;her &nbsp;heart &nbsp;for &nbsp;those
  unfortunate &nbsp;charges &nbsp;under &nbsp;her &nbsp;supervision &nbsp;and &nbsp;a &nbsp;special
  animosity &nbsp;towards &nbsp;pretty &nbsp;girls. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She &nbsp;ruled &nbsp;the &nbsp;royal
  household &nbsp;with &nbsp;an &nbsp;iron &nbsp;hand &nbsp;and &nbsp;many &nbsp;a &nbsp;hapless &nbsp;maid &nbsp;or
  serving girl felt the stinging bite of the cane or strap to their &nbsp;bare &nbsp;bottom
  as &nbsp;a &nbsp;reminder &nbsp;of &nbsp;Miss &nbsp;Simpson's &nbsp;strict
  Prussian &nbsp;heritage. &nbsp;&nbsp;The cane, &nbsp;strap and martinet were
  all used by the imperious head housekeeper to maintain the strict discipline
  and obedience she required. &nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen Margaret's riding switch,
  however, was reserved for the princess. 
The staccato clicking of high heels on the hard stone floor announced the
  return of the Queen's housekeeper. &nbsp;Miss Simpson stepped into the room
  and closed the door behind her. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thin-lipped
  spinster wore her black hair, &nbsp;which showed traces of grey, drawn back &nbsp;from
  her forehead into a tight bun at the neck, &nbsp;emphasizing the angularity
  and severity of her features. &nbsp;Her long black dress with high collar and
  puffed sleeves added to her stature, and the woman's hooked nose and thin,
  cruel mouth distinguished her as unsparing and strict disciplinarian. 
The &nbsp;supple, &nbsp;leather-wrapped, &nbsp;whalebone &nbsp;switch, &nbsp;which
  Miss Simpson flexed ominously in her hard bony hands, looked to be a formidable &nbsp;instrument
  of correction; &nbsp;more suitable for use on the tough hide of an errant pony
  than the soft buttocks of a woman. &nbsp;&nbsp;Almost three feet in length,
  tapering from &nbsp;its &nbsp;shiny &nbsp;embossed &nbsp;handle &nbsp;to &nbsp;a &nbsp;fiendishly-stinging,
  twine-wrapped, braided trainer; &nbsp;it looked to be more a whip than a switch. 
The &nbsp;queen's &nbsp;brother, &nbsp;Sir &nbsp;Richard, &nbsp;portly &nbsp;and &nbsp;ruddy-faced, &nbsp;commented &nbsp;coarsely, &nbsp;&quot;By
  God, &nbsp;I &nbsp;could &nbsp;train my polo ponies with that switch.� 
The young princess shifted nervously in her chair at the Duke of Reddington's
  acute observation. &nbsp;The proud beauty had tasted &nbsp;the &nbsp;fiery &nbsp;kiss &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;riding &nbsp;switch &nbsp;on &nbsp;her &nbsp;bare
  backside twice before in the privacy of the Queen's chambers. And in the hands
  of a skillful chastiser like Miss Simpson, who &nbsp;being &nbsp;a &nbsp;woman, &nbsp;knew &nbsp;where &nbsp;the &nbsp;bottom &nbsp;was &nbsp;tenderest;
  another &nbsp;such &nbsp;occurrence &nbsp;was &nbsp;certainly &nbsp;not &nbsp;something &nbsp;she
  relished. 
The Lady Isabel, &nbsp;who was obviously sympathetic towards her niece's plight, &nbsp;eyed
  the evil length of black whalebone uneasily and remarked, &quot;Surely that
  whip is meant to be used over clothing, I hope. 
Queen Margaret scoffed &nbsp;irascibly and said, &nbsp;&quot;Bah! &nbsp;&nbsp;You
  English are &nbsp;too soft-hearted. &nbsp;&nbsp;A good warming of the bare
  arse &nbsp;never &nbsp;did &nbsp;a &nbsp;young &nbsp;strumpet &nbsp;any &nbsp;harm. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why &nbsp;in &nbsp;my
  homeland, &nbsp;I've seen the daughter of a count stripped naked and flogged
  through the streets of the village for having an affair with a servant. &nbsp;And
  this was ordered by her father!&quot; 
The scowling woman paused, then said emphatically, &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;My stepdaughter
  is whipped on the naked buttocks.&quot; 
Indeed the Queen's convictions were not uncharacteristic for eighteenth century
  Europe and England, an era not known for excessive leniency or sentimentality
  towards the fairer sex. &nbsp;Public birchings and floggings of female offenders
  were fairly &nbsp;commonplace &nbsp;in &nbsp;places &nbsp;like &nbsp;Tyburn &nbsp;and &nbsp;Brideswell.
  While &nbsp;in &nbsp;Europe, &nbsp;immoral &nbsp;women &nbsp;were &nbsp;bound &nbsp;and &nbsp;tied &nbsp;to
  lampposts at street corners and whipped. &nbsp;&nbsp;In small villages, the &nbsp;pillory
  and &nbsp;whipping post &nbsp;did &nbsp;not &nbsp;set &nbsp;idle &nbsp;for &nbsp;long,
  while the less common cart tail whippings of naked women was a very &nbsp;popular &nbsp;event. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even &nbsp;in &nbsp;the &nbsp;finest &nbsp;of &nbsp;finishing
  schools, &nbsp;like &nbsp;the &nbsp;one &nbsp;attended &nbsp;by the Princess
  Lesley in Ruttenberg, the most docile and hardworking of students could expect
  at least one or two burning and shameful chastisements during the school year. 
Queen Margaret now turned to her stern housekeeper and asked, &quot;Are you
  ready Miss Simpson?&quot; 
The stern-featured servant nodded respectfully. 
The Queen then put her fingers to the side of her chin as she contemplated. &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Let's
  see now.&quot; she said. &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I started Lesley off with six. &nbsp;&nbsp;Then
  last time it was eight. &nbsp;&nbsp;So the normal progression calls for ten
  strokes today.&quot; 
The &nbsp;smiling &nbsp;matriarch &nbsp;looked &nbsp;at &nbsp;her &nbsp;stepdaughter &nbsp;and
  said calmly, &nbsp;&quot;My dear, &nbsp;I believe Miss Simpson is waiting on
  you.� 
The Princess Lesley's eyes met those of her adversary's momentarily then she
  glanced nervously around the table at the seated guests as the prickly heat
  of a blush warmed the young woman's pale cheeks. 
Sensing her niece's discomfort with the mixed company at the &nbsp;table, &nbsp;The &nbsp;Lady &nbsp;Isabel &nbsp;tried &nbsp;to &nbsp;intercede &nbsp;for &nbsp;the
  condemned beauty. &nbsp;&nbsp;She asked mildly, &quot;I'm sure Your Highness
  means &nbsp;for &nbsp;the gentlemen and children to pass to the other room
  don't you?&quot; 
The Queen Margaret snorted derisively, &nbsp;&quot;Nonsense! &nbsp;This little
  fool needs put on no airs of false modesty here. &nbsp;Not after the way Miss
  Simpson and I found her in the barn with that stablehand. &nbsp;&nbsp;We are
  all royalty here. &nbsp;&nbsp;I find nothing inappropriate. &nbsp;Besides the
  embarrassment will do her good.&quot; 
The Queen fixed her stepdaughter with a cold stare and said sharply, &quot;We're
  waiting, Lesley.� 
It was &nbsp;then &nbsp;that the young princess &nbsp;faced her mother with &nbsp;flaming &nbsp;face &nbsp;and &nbsp;retorted, &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I &nbsp;don't &nbsp;think &nbsp;&nbsp;it's
  appropriate at all, mother!� 
The &nbsp;girl's &nbsp;grimly-smiling &nbsp;stepmother &nbsp;nodded &nbsp;her &nbsp;head
  slowly and announced, &nbsp;&quot;Very well. &nbsp;&nbsp;We can have the men
  and children leave. &nbsp;&nbsp;However there will be a little supplement for &nbsp;the &nbsp;sake &nbsp;of &nbsp;modesty. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Shall &nbsp;we &nbsp;say, &nbsp;an &nbsp;extra &nbsp;six
  strokes.� 
The blood drained from the sentenced penitent's sullen countenance as she
  lowered her head and declined the offer. 
Queen Margaret smiled triumphantly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;I didn't think so. Your
  little outburst has now increased the tariff to twelve. If you insist on stalling
  we can always go higher.� 
The &nbsp;Queen &nbsp;glanced &nbsp;for &nbsp;a &nbsp;moment &nbsp;at &nbsp;her &nbsp;husband &nbsp;then
  turned to the seated princess and demanded, &quot;Well!&quot; 
With &nbsp;a sigh &nbsp;of &nbsp;resignation, &nbsp;the &nbsp;Princess &nbsp;Lesley
  rose from her chair and stepped away from the table. &nbsp;&nbsp;Despite the
  grim &nbsp;&nbsp;foreboding of her impend &nbsp;&nbsp;punishment, the aristocratic
  beauty faced her shaming and painful ordeal with an air of quiet stoicism,
  staring unblinkingly above the heads of the seated guests, meeting the eyes
  of no one. 
Queen &nbsp;Margaret &nbsp;regarded &nbsp;her &nbsp;stepdaughter &nbsp;keenly &nbsp;then
  looked at her black-garbed housekeeper and inclined her head slightly. &nbsp;At
  the Queen's gesture, &nbsp;Miss Simpson strode over to the condemned young
  woman and grasped her arm firmly in her strong bony hand. &nbsp;With a grip
  the Princess Lesley could not dispute, the switch-wielding matron led her lovely
  victim to the center of the room and positioned her so her backside was towards
  the gathered nobility. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl's
  austere parent cleared her throat and spoke firmly, &nbsp;&quot;You know what's
  next, Lesley. &nbsp;&nbsp;Lift up your dress and bare your bottom.&quot; 
The &nbsp;proud &nbsp;beauty's &nbsp;shoulders &nbsp;stiffened momentarily
  at her stepmother's terse command, then blushing furiously, the Princess Lesley
  of Neufundland reached down, gathered up her billowing skirt, and lifted the
  white silk garment above her waist. 
The taut silence which followed the collective sigh of the seated dinner guests
  bespoke of the fact that beneath her lifted skirt and single petticoat, the
  young woman's buttocks were completely naked. &nbsp;&nbsp;From the waist down, &nbsp;the
  Princess Lesley wore only a white lace garter belt to which her sheer silk
  stockings were tautly tethered. &nbsp;Her bare, upstandingly-rounded, &nbsp;oval-shaped
  bottomgobes were sensuously framed by the straps of her suspender belt. &nbsp;Wide
  and firm, jutting out invitingly from her slim waist, &nbsp;those glorious
  hillocks of alabaster flesh bore the shaming stigma of fading brownish-yellow
  lines as evidence of prior chastisements. 
The &nbsp;fullness &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;lovely &nbsp;Princess's &nbsp;truly &nbsp;womanly
  posterior &nbsp;belied &nbsp;her &nbsp;slender &nbsp;stature and &nbsp;the &nbsp;broadening
  crease &nbsp;which &nbsp;separated &nbsp;the &nbsp;beautifully-proportioned &nbsp;bottom
  rounds &nbsp;gradually widened &nbsp;at the lower summits to hide &nbsp;its
  shadowy mystery there. &nbsp;At the base of the Princess Lesley's condemned &nbsp;behind, &nbsp;her &nbsp;supple, &nbsp;gracefully-sculptured &nbsp;thighs
  merged &nbsp;in &nbsp;harmonious &nbsp;juncture &nbsp;before tapering down
  to &nbsp;her trimly muscled calves. 
The Queen Margaret's brother, Sir Richard, was first to break &nbsp;the &nbsp;awkward
  silence. &nbsp;&nbsp;Without &nbsp;turning his &nbsp;lecherous gaze from the
  girl's bared buttocks, he remarked thickly, &quot;By God, that garterbelt really
  sets them off. &nbsp;Doesn't it?&quot; 
The &nbsp;half-naked &nbsp;penitent's &nbsp;smugly-smiling &nbsp;stepmother
  nodded and answered easily, &nbsp;&quot;Yes, I think so. &nbsp;&nbsp;Lesley
  isn't allowed to wear any undergarments while in the palace. &nbsp;&nbsp;It's
  part of her punishment. &nbsp;&nbsp;Last week when it was chilly, &nbsp;the
  little minx tried &nbsp;to &nbsp;get away with slipping on a pair of drawers
  but Miss Simpson noticed the garment missing from her bureau. &nbsp;That cost
  Lesley a second dose of eight strokes. She still has the marks from that. &nbsp;&nbsp;We've
  since removed all of her underthings from her room. &nbsp;Now if she needs
  a pair of underpants or d chemise or camisole, she must ask myself or Miss
  Simpson.&quot; 
Sir Richard cocked his head questioningly at his sister and &nbsp;said, &nbsp;&quot;Do &nbsp;you &nbsp;mean &nbsp;to &nbsp;say
  that &nbsp;under &nbsp;her &nbsp;dress, &nbsp;the Princess is errrr....shall
  we say... .uhhh...&quot; 
&quot;Naked?&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen answered &nbsp;levelly. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Yes, &nbsp;quite.&quot; 
During this embarrassing discussion of her predicament, the &nbsp;Princess &nbsp;Lesley &nbsp;had &nbsp;not &nbsp;stirred. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like &nbsp;a &nbsp;porcelain
  statue, &nbsp;the young noblewoman stood tall and serene &nbsp;in her provocative &nbsp;dishabille, &nbsp;her &nbsp;furled &nbsp;dress &nbsp;lifted &nbsp;above
  her hips exposing her chaste nudity fore and aft. &nbsp;She could feel the
  humiliating coolness of the air on her naked backside but her &nbsp;high &nbsp;cheekboned &nbsp;face &nbsp;remained &nbsp;expressionless &nbsp;as &nbsp;she
  awaited her fate. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen
  of Neufundland turned to her switch-wielding servant &nbsp;and &nbsp;said, &nbsp;&quot;I &nbsp;think &nbsp;you &nbsp;may &nbsp;begin, &nbsp;Miss &nbsp;Simpson. &nbsp;Twelve
  strokes, please.&quot; 
The &nbsp;black-clad &nbsp;housekeeper &nbsp;nodded &nbsp;curtly then &nbsp;stepped
  into position behind the half-nude princess, standing at her left. 
Sensing &nbsp;that &nbsp;her &nbsp;whipping &nbsp;was &nbsp;eminent, &nbsp;The &nbsp;Princess
  Lesley took a deep breath and steeled herself for the first stroke &nbsp;as &nbsp;almost &nbsp;imperceptible &nbsp;ripplings &nbsp;shook &nbsp;the &nbsp;firm
  cheeks of her condemned behind. 
Miss &nbsp;Simpson &nbsp;extended &nbsp;the &nbsp;supple &nbsp;riding &nbsp;switch &nbsp;and
  measured &nbsp;her &nbsp;distance, &nbsp;appraising &nbsp;the &nbsp;ample &nbsp;milky-white
  mounds of her victim's &nbsp;luscious naked bottom. &nbsp;&nbsp;She watched
  the &nbsp;young &nbsp;woman's &nbsp;buttocks &nbsp;tighten &nbsp;and &nbsp;shudder &nbsp;in &nbsp;nervous
  muscular contractions as she slowly drew back her arm. 
The &nbsp;lovely young martyr &nbsp;could &nbsp;tell &nbsp;by the &nbsp;collective
  hush of the dinner guests that the lash had risen and was en route to deliver
  its first burning kiss. &nbsp;&nbsp;She heard a faint whirring sound, then
  fire laced across her vulnerably-exposed buttocks. 
The &nbsp;eel-like &nbsp;black &nbsp;switch &nbsp;wrapped &nbsp;around &nbsp;the &nbsp;upper
  summits of the Princess Lesley's naked posterior, the trainer flicking &nbsp;with &nbsp;venom &nbsp;at &nbsp;the &nbsp;fleshy &nbsp;mound &nbsp;of &nbsp;her &nbsp;right
  bottomglobe. 
The girl's tensing body jerked convulsively at the shock of &nbsp;the &nbsp;first &nbsp;blow &nbsp;as &nbsp;she &nbsp;involuntarily &nbsp;thrust &nbsp;her &nbsp;hips
  forward, twisting her stung nether cheeks away from the pain. Across &nbsp;the &nbsp;alabaster &nbsp;smoothness &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;Princess &nbsp;Lesley's
  cringing bottomcheeks a vivid pink stripe appeared, darker on the &nbsp;right &nbsp;where &nbsp;the &nbsp;cord &nbsp;trainer &nbsp;had &nbsp;fallen. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under &nbsp;the
  impetus &nbsp;of &nbsp;the stroke, &nbsp;the courageous beauty's &nbsp;lovely
  face lifted and her eyes opened wide, but only a hiss of sucked-in breath attested
  to her suffering. 
Tightening her grip on her upraised skirt and petticoat, the Princess Lesley
  set her teeth against her underlip, &nbsp;the delicate nostrils of her dainty
  nose dilating with the afflux of quickened breathing as she waited fretfully
  for the next stroke. 
For &nbsp;&nbsp;the &nbsp;&nbsp;second &nbsp;&nbsp;cut &nbsp;&nbsp;of &nbsp;&nbsp;her &nbsp;&nbsp;unfortunate &nbsp;&nbsp;victim's
  chastisement, &nbsp;&nbsp;Miss &nbsp;&nbsp;Simpson &nbsp;&nbsp;stepped &nbsp;&nbsp;to &nbsp;&nbsp;the &nbsp;&nbsp;right &nbsp;&nbsp;and
  skillfully directed &nbsp;a &nbsp;sweeping &nbsp;backhand &nbsp;slash &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;whip
  into the ripest curves of the princess's helplessly-proffered behind. &nbsp;There &nbsp;was &nbsp;a &nbsp;sinister &nbsp;whistle &nbsp;as &nbsp;the &nbsp;switch &nbsp;sang
  through the &nbsp;air &nbsp;and &nbsp;curled &nbsp;with an angry and crisp
  impact against the very middle of both wobbling hemispheres. 
The girl's body stiffened and her red-striped buttocks bounded furiously under
  the cut as a second parallel stripe sprang up on the resilient flesh of her
  punished bare bottom. Delivered &nbsp;from &nbsp;the &nbsp;right &nbsp;side, &nbsp;the &nbsp;twine-wrapped &nbsp;trainer
  plucked greedily at the spasming left cheek of the Princess Lesley's &nbsp;hapless &nbsp;posterior, &nbsp;evenly &nbsp;distributing &nbsp;its &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;measure
  of pain. 
Observing the even spacing of the first two stripes on the young princess's
  naked behind, Sir Richard remarked, &quot;By God, she's accurate. &nbsp;And
  from both sides, too.&quot; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queen Margaret
  smiled proudly at her brother's favorable assessment &nbsp;of &nbsp;her &nbsp;housekeeper's &nbsp;flagellatory
  skill. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Oh yes.&quot; she replied calmly. &nbsp;&quot;Miss
  Simpson can line Lesley's impudent backside like a piece of sheet music if
  she wants to. 
The &nbsp;Duke &nbsp;of &nbsp;Reddington &nbsp;nodded &nbsp;sagely then turned &nbsp;to
  watch the next biting slash of the switch attack the Princess Lesley's exquisitely-rounded
  young buttocks. 
Having stepped back to the left, Miss Simpson swept the third stroke across
  her victim's cringing posterior with a strong &nbsp;forehand &nbsp;stroke, &nbsp;striping &nbsp;the &nbsp;Princess &nbsp;Lesley's &nbsp;flinching
  nether cheeks with another evenly-spaced parallel welt. 
Again the courageous young sufferer's lithe body arched in protest &nbsp;to &nbsp;the &nbsp;scalding
  bite &nbsp;of the &nbsp;lash as her &nbsp;head lifted &nbsp;and &nbsp;a &nbsp;stifled &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Uhhh!&quot; &nbsp;escaped &nbsp;her &nbsp;tightly
  pursed lips. &nbsp;The girl's whipped buttocks shook jelly-like
  under the force of the blow &nbsp;and the three scarlet stripes emblazoned
  on &nbsp;her &nbsp;tender &nbsp;flesh &nbsp;contrasted &nbsp;sharply &nbsp;with &nbsp;the &nbsp;milky
  smoothness of her velvety-sheened bottom. 
The &nbsp;penitent &nbsp;princess &nbsp;blinked &nbsp;back &nbsp;the &nbsp;tears &nbsp;that
  flooded &nbsp;her &nbsp;eyes &nbsp;as &nbsp;she valiantly strove to maintain
  her composure &nbsp;under &nbsp;the &nbsp;searing &nbsp;pain &nbsp;which &nbsp;assaulted &nbsp;her
  throbbing red-streaked behind. &nbsp;&nbsp;While her prior thrashings had taken
  place in the privacy of the Queen's chambers, the shame of having to bare her
  royal backside to the besmirching eyes of the men and children at the dinner
  table only added to the young noblewoman's anguish and mortification. 
For &nbsp;&nbsp;the &nbsp;fourth &nbsp;stroke &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;Princess &nbsp;Lesley's
  prescribed &nbsp;punishment, &nbsp;the &nbsp;stern &nbsp;Miss &nbsp;Simpson &nbsp;once &nbsp;again
  stepped to the right of her half-naked prey and regaled the full &nbsp;pale &nbsp;cheeks &nbsp;of &nbsp;her &nbsp;trembling &nbsp;bottom &nbsp;with &nbsp;a &nbsp;sharp
  backhanded cut of the supple whalebone switch. &nbsp;The huddling, squirming
  mounds &nbsp;of &nbsp;the Princess Lesley's &nbsp;welted buttocks shook furiously
  under the burning smart of the whip as she ground her teeth savagely to stifle
  her cry. &nbsp;&nbsp;Another lurid weal sprang up on the girl's beleaguered
  backside just below the plumpest curves of both bottom summits. 
The &nbsp;Duke &nbsp;of &nbsp;Reddington's &nbsp;fifteen &nbsp;year-old &nbsp;daughter, &nbsp;Elizabeth, &nbsp;and &nbsp;his &nbsp;thirteen &nbsp;year-old &nbsp;son, &nbsp;James, &nbsp;acutely
  observed their older cousin's painful chastisement. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sir Richard
  often administered bare-bottomed thrashings to Elizabeth in her bedroom, which
  her brother would sometimes watch through the keyhole. &nbsp;The girl's lecherous
  father would corporally &nbsp;punish &nbsp;his &nbsp;adolescent &nbsp;daughter &nbsp;on &nbsp;almost &nbsp;any
  pretense, positioning her over the footrail of her bed with her virginal behind
  arching out lewdly for the burning kisses of strap or cane. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both children
  watched as Miss Simpson sent the fifth hissing &nbsp;stroke &nbsp;into &nbsp;the &nbsp;base &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;Princess &nbsp;Lesley's
  inflamed &nbsp;lower &nbsp;hemispheres. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As &nbsp;the &nbsp;wicked &nbsp;leather &nbsp;wand
  seared her scalded flesh, the fiendishly-stinging tail of the lash &nbsp;seemed &nbsp;to &nbsp;cling &nbsp;and &nbsp;burrow &nbsp;into &nbsp;the &nbsp;young &nbsp;woman's
  sensitive right underbuttock for a second before it snapped back, leaving its
  swelling burgundy weal. 
Under this pernicious attack on her tenderest flesh, the Princess Lesley's
  head &nbsp;lifted and a choking cry of &nbsp;&quot;Ohh-&shy;aahh!!&quot; &nbsp;was &nbsp;torn &nbsp;from &nbsp;her &nbsp;trembling &nbsp;lips. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &nbsp;lovely
  sufferer's welt-ridged bottom ovals &nbsp;jiggled salaciously as the muscles &nbsp;of &nbsp;her &nbsp;behind &nbsp;and &nbsp;thighs
  spasmed &nbsp;in helpless defense against the burning agony of the lash. &nbsp;&nbsp;Tears
  had begun to trickle down the brave young martyr's flushed cheeks and her breasts
  heaved as she drew several deep breaths in preparation for the next stroke. 
The dour Miss Simpson smiled with satisfaction at her victim's plaintive cry;
  no doubt in her mind that the little baggage had felt the last cut. &nbsp;&nbsp;The
  striations left by the whipcord &nbsp;switch &nbsp;had &nbsp;created &nbsp;a &nbsp;lascivious &nbsp;pattern &nbsp;on &nbsp;the
  creamy &nbsp;bare &nbsp;flesh &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;girl's &nbsp;voluptuously-provocative
  posterior, &nbsp;so &nbsp;roguishly displayed &nbsp;between garter &nbsp;belt
  arid stockings beneath the uplifted hem of her skirt. 
The cruel matron had purposely directed the fifth stroke of &nbsp;her &nbsp;contrite &nbsp;charge's &nbsp;whipping &nbsp;lower &nbsp;than &nbsp;the &nbsp;four
  previous evenly-spaced stripes. &nbsp;Being a woman, she knew that the skin
  in the fleshy overhang of the buttocks rubs more and is more tender in the
  crease. &nbsp;And wanting to demonstrate her proficiency with the lash, &nbsp;Miss
  Simpson had been confident that an adroitly placed cut of the whalebone-cored
  switch would break her stoic victim's proud silence; which it did. 
The stern housekeeper extended the rapier-like length of well-oiled whipcord
  out against the remaining pale band of untouched &nbsp;flesh &nbsp;on &nbsp;the &nbsp;lower &nbsp;curves &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;sniffling
  princess's martyred behind. &nbsp;The grim woman's eyes brightened when she
  heard the girl's barely audible groan as she felt the &nbsp;measuring &nbsp;tap &nbsp;of &nbsp;the &nbsp;rod. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gritting &nbsp;her &nbsp;teeth, &nbsp;the
  Queen's &nbsp;head &nbsp;housekeeper &nbsp;drew back &nbsp;her &nbsp;arm and &nbsp;sent &nbsp;the
  flexible withe whistling across the quivering rotundities of the Princess Lesley's
  well-wealed bottom with ferocious zeal. 
The snickering wisp of the switch was too quick to see. But a moment after
  it snapped back, there appeared the white line that slowly merged into red,
  evenly bisecting the space between &nbsp;the &nbsp;two &nbsp;previous &nbsp;cuts. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &nbsp;princess's &nbsp;scorched
  bottom rounds jerked uncontrollably in a clenching bound as her head &nbsp;lifted
  and a choking cry escaped her desperately compressed lips. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six &nbsp;raised &nbsp;&nbsp;horizontal &nbsp;&nbsp;stripes &nbsp;marred &nbsp;&nbsp;the &nbsp;creamy
  smoothness &nbsp;of the Princess Lesley's beautiful bare behind, starting at
  the top of her hips and descending to the base of her &nbsp;sumptuously-rounded &nbsp;buttocks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The &nbsp;marks &nbsp;stood &nbsp;out
  vividly on the pale milky skin of the young woman's luscious posterior and
  her throbbing flesh drew and twitched where the lash had bitten. &nbsp;&nbsp;The
  Princess's lovely face was flushed and streaked with tears, and the anguished
  knowledge that &nbsp;she &nbsp;still &nbsp;had &nbsp;half &nbsp;her &nbsp;punishment &nbsp;remaining &nbsp;weighed
  heavily on her proud spirit. 
The &nbsp;girl's &nbsp;executioner &nbsp;&nbsp;leisurely &nbsp;contemplated &nbsp;her
  handiwork, &nbsp;purposely prolonging &nbsp;her &nbsp;victim's &nbsp;ordeal. &nbsp;&nbsp;The
  Princess Lesley's vivid and sensitive beauty, &nbsp;coupled with the haughtiness
  of her attitude, whetted Miss Simpson's &nbsp;sadistic spirit and tightened
  her resolve to humiliate and torment the unfortunate young noblewoman all the
  more. &nbsp;The skillful chastiser knew that seventh cut of the tearful &nbsp;penitent's
  allotted twelve strokes would intersect the previous stripes so accurately
  etched on the aristocratic &nbsp;beauty's cruelly-streaked buttocks, increasing
  her agony and further weakening her fading fortitude. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To that end, the Queen Margaret's unrelenting
  head housekeeper, slowly raised her sinewy right arm, her cruel eyes devouring
  the flinching trembling bare buttocks of her helpless victim. With a whistling
  slash, Miss Simpson swept the murderously-flexible switch diagonally from right
  to left, imprinting a lurid crimson stripe from the edge of the Princess Lesley's
  right hip across her writhing bottom ovals and biting keenly against the base
  of the left buttock. &nbsp;Under the impetus of the stinging pain, the half-naked
  young woman's body jerked convulsively and she involuntarily thrust her naked
  hips forward in lewd response to the naked fury of the lash. A strangled cry
  of &quot;Aaaaarrgh!!!&quot; &nbsp;was torn from the lovely martyr's throat
  and the livid welts danced obscenely on the whipped nether cheeks of her swollen
  throbbing posterior. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With hardly a pause, Miss Simpson nimbly stepped
  to the left and backhanded a second diagonal cut, inscribing a bright X over
  her sobbing victim's huddling lower hemispheres. &nbsp;The riding switch whistled
  furiously as it bit across the two luridly-wealed nether globes, evilly kissing
  the spasming gluteal mounds which bounded under its imperious torment. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her will weakened by this merciless onslaught
  of pain, the Princess Lesley's contorted face lifted and another squealing
  cry was wrenched from her trembling lips. &nbsp;The girl's hands fisted at
  the searing pain that licked at her martyred behind and her quivering hillocks
  contracted voluptuously before the eyes of her audience. &nbsp;The anguished
  beauty was acutely aware of the involuntary fatty shivers that ran up along
  the insides of her thighs into her welt-ridged bottom ovals above. &nbsp;And
  a wave of despondent shame and degradation swept over the penitent young noblewoman
  as she desperately prayed for strength to bear the remainder of her punishment. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For the ninth stroke of the Princess Lesley's
  prescribed penance, the dour Miss Simpson kept her hapless victim agonizing
  for what seemed an interminable wait, utilizing every nuance of suspense and
  humiliation conceivable. The sadistic matron, being of common birth, especially
  relished the duty of plying the lash to the bared buttocks of a member of the
  royal family, no doubt feeling in her own mind that for each welt she raised
  on the milky-white skin of the &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Princess Lesley's velvety-smooth
  posterior, she was repaying &nbsp;some of her former aristocratic masters for
  the beatings she had endured in her youth. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With that purpose in mind, the severe disciplinarian
  sent the ninth stroke slicing into the plumpest curves of her unfortunate sufferer's
  quaking lower hillocks. &nbsp;The whipcord switch curled and clung cruelly
  to the Princess Lesley's writhing buttocks, the hardened cord trainer chewing
  unmercifully into the excoriated flesh of her cringing right bottomglobe. &nbsp;The
  young princess's knees buckled then straighten and a sobbing wail of &quot;Ahhhowww!!!
  escaped her gaping mouth. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Lady Isabel flinched sympathetically as
  she saw the livid weal encircle her niece's lovely lower hemispheres which
  shuddered and shook in a series of rippling spasms of pain. The interlacing
  streaks of crimson blazed like a brand on the corrugated flesh of the girl's
  condemned backside as she desperately tried to relax her tensing bottomcheeks
  to better absorb the next blow. &nbsp;The Princess knew from previous punishments
  that clenching of the buttocks only made the lash bite harder, but the enervating
  torment that assaulted her tortured backside weakened the will of her body
  to do her bidding as she desperately strove to slacken the cheeks of her condemned
  behind. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Miss Simpson impassively extended the switch
  and laid it solidly across the base of her hapless victim's lividly streaked
  bare bottom. The Princess Lesley caught her breath and gave a sobbing whimper
  as she bowed her head and awaited the resumption of her whipping. The puffy
  weals etched on the shivering flesh of the lovely sufferer's swollen posterior
  were livid and beginning to darken where the toughened trainer had imparted
  its venomous kiss. The cruel housekeeper especially enjoyed demonstrating her
  fustigatory skill on the Princess's firm out- thrust buttocks for the girl's
  creamy skin marked vividly to show the full artistry of her handiwork. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Swwisshhh..craacckkk!!! The tenth stroke was
  given after a pause of almost a full minute, during most of which time, Miss
  Simpson kept the flexible rod pressed against the area she had selected for
  her cut. &nbsp;It was a backhanded blow from left to right, dexterously delivered
  with the full strength of wrist to send to tip of the lash burrowing into the
  Princess's shivery left hindcheek, launching her into another involuntary paroxysm
  of pain. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A heart-rending scream was torn from the Princess
  Lesley as the muscles of her bottom spasmed and the streaked and quivering
  gluteal mounds formed a rigid mass of tender flesh furiously resisting the
  pitiless cruelty of the lash. &nbsp;The condemned beauty's stricken face lifted,
  her eyes huge and blinded by tears as her half-nude body gyrated lewdly before
  her mixed audience. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the swirling mist of suffering that
  engulfed her pain-racked body, the Princess Lesley could only think that she
  had just two more strokes to endure from that terrible &nbsp;riding whip. &nbsp;The
  enforced stance of her pose with arms to the sides and skirts held aloft, sent
  muscular ripplings up her sleek thighs, causing acute agony to the courageous
  young martyr as the shuddering cheeks of her welted bottom twitched and contracted
  spasmodically. Even the slightest trembling of her swollen posterior globes
  sent frightful waves of suffering through her violently striated flesh. And
  although it felt to her like a white-hot iron was being drawn across her tender
  behind with each cut, the Princess Lesley was almost anxious for the final
  two strokes to fall to finally end her humiliating ordeal. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The sobbing penitent felt the measuring tap
  of her tormentor's switch and could hear, in the taut silence of the room,
  the rustling of Miss Simpson's heavily starched dress as she slowly drew back
  her arm. &nbsp;A frown of consternation creased the Princess's pretty forehead
  as she set her teeth against her underlip and waited with shuddering anguish
  for the switch to resume its hellish work. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was then that the Queen Margaret's vindictive
  cruelty came into play as she called out to her servant, &quot;Hold on a minute,
  Miss Simpson.&quot; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The dour spinster's angular face did not change
  expression as she lowered her arm and looked questioningly at her mistress.
  If she felt any disappointment at the prospect of remitting the last two strokes
  of her helpless victim's count, she did not show it. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Upon hearing her stepmother's command, a faint
  ray of hope flickered through the Princess Lesley's mind as she desperately
  prayed for leniency in her harsh sentence. &nbsp;However any prospects for
  mercy were immediately dashed and replaced with horrified anguish as the tearful
  girl's rancorous adversary turned to her guests and calmly announced, &quot;Dear
  Lesley makes such comical faces when she's being thrashed. I feel I would be
  remiss in my duties as a host if I deprived you of that pleasure. &nbsp;Lesley,
  turn and face the table for your last two strokes. &quot; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through the buzzing in her ears, the Princess
  Lesley heard her stepmother's terrible decree as the color drained from her
  shocked countenance. &nbsp;A sickening knot formed in her stomach and the young
  woman's kneehollows felt weak and trembling. &nbsp;She could not move. &nbsp;She
  would not move. &nbsp;To stand obediently before a bemused gathering of men,
  women, and children while a common servant viciously whipped her bare bottom
  as she willing hoisted her skirts above her waist was one thing. &nbsp;But
  to turn and face her audience, and freely expose the most private parts of
  her body was too much. The anguished beauty turned her tear-streaked face back
  over her shoulder to her vengeful stepmother, imploring mercy. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queen Margaret regarded her stepdaughter coldly
  then turned to her expectant housekeeper and said, &quot;Perhaps Lesley needs
  some urging Miss Simpson. &nbsp;Give her a couple across the legs.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The
  Princess Lesley saw the movement of the servant's arm out of the corner of
  her eye and she swerved her hips furiously and screamed, &quot;Nooo---auuuiieee!!!&quot; as
  the snickering lash tore into the soft flesh of her capering thighs. A second
  stroke immediately followed, attacking the beautiful columns of the young noblewoman's
  upper thighs just &nbsp;below the cheeks of her piteously-welted bottom. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under this pernicious assault on her most sensitive
  flesh, the Princess Lesley dropped her raised skirts and rushed her trembling
  hands to her scalded nates, sobbing brokenly as she shamelessly kneaded the
  corrugated flesh of her buttocks and thighs in clenching rolls. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The openly crying girl's stern stepmother allowed
  her a few moments of respite before she proclaimed icily, &quot;If you've finished
  with this indecent display Lesley, I suggest we get on with the remainder of
  your punishment. You've already earned a little supplement to your count for
  your behavior thus far. If you don't want to feel Miss Simpson's switch
  across your shoulders, I suggest you turn around and face the table.
  Now!!!&quot; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Confronted with this dire alternative from her
  unrelenting tormentor, the Princess Lesley had no choice but to comply. The
  sniffling beauty slowly straightened her bowed figure and remove her hands
  from her throbbing, red- striped posterior. She smoothed her rumpled skirt
  then brushed the tears from her ravaged eyes and squared her slim shoulders.
  Then with stately grace, as if turning to greet a dancing partner at a ball,
  the condemned, twenty-one year-old daughter of the King of Neufundland turned
  to face the remainder of her degrading chastisement. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a moment the sentenced young noblewoman's
  eyes met those of her grim executioner and she could see the steely glitter
  in Miss Simpson's cold grey eyes. &nbsp;And while the Princess Lesley's tear-wet
  face remained expressionless, outraged shame and indignation blazed in her
  swollen, red-rimmed eyes as she gave a scathing stare at the one responsible
  for her torment. It was almost a look of aloof defiance as if to say, go ahead
  do your worst. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a porcelain statue, the courageous penitent
  stared straight ahead, chin high, eyes distant. &nbsp;Princess Lesley saw Miss
  Simpson step into position behind her. Then as if to cheat her vindictive stepmother
  out of the pleasure of giving the shaming order, the condemned beauty mechanically
  reached down and raised her skirt above her waist. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The prickly heat of a blush warmed the pale
  cheeks of the lovely young martyr's face as she presented her chaste nudity
  to the profaning eyes her attentive audience. &nbsp;Beneath the dainty niche
  of the girl's shallow navel and smooth delightfully-curved belly, the soft
  downy curls of her Venus mound shielded the Princess's virgin slit. &nbsp;Erotically
  framed by the straps of her garter belt at the apex of her full beautifully-rounded
  thighs, the Princess Lesley's silken love-thatch was of slightly darker shade
  than her ash-blonde tresses. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young woman's hands did not waver as she
  kept her skirt held high, her face a graven image of beauty. For despite her
  degrading pose, flushed, tear-stained face, and welted bare bottom, the Princess
  Lesley retained a certain detached elegance, something bred into nobility,
  that neither her stepmother nor Miss Simpson could take away, no matter how
  severe or humiliating the punishments. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen of Neufundland regarded her stepdaughter
  coldly then turned to her housekeeper. &quot;You may give Lesley the last two
  strokes of her original count now, Miss Simpson.&quot; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The black-clad matron nodded curtly then pursed
  her thin lips as she impassively appraised her victim's trembling bare bottom.
  The criss-crossed swellings from the whip blazed salaciously across the luscious
  mounds of Callyphigian beauty so helplessly delivered to the woman's heartless
  sadism. &nbsp;Miss Simpson extended the rapier-like switch and mockingly touched
  the tumified flesh of the Princess Lesley's condemned behind several times,
  delighting in the nervous twitchings of the girl's lividly-streaked nether
  hemispheres. &nbsp;The malicious woman purposely prolonged her helpless prey's
  agonizing suspense, knowing the mortification she was experiencing facing her
  parent's dinner guests naked from the waist down. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Princess Lesley could see nothing and hear
  nothing as she powerlessly awaited the frightful agony of the lash. She was
  almost relieved when she perceived the look of apprehension on her Aunt Isabel's
  worried face which told her the punishing rod had risen. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The swift slashing whisper of the switch through
  the air and the swift slashing pain across her naked bottom arrived together
  as Miss Simpson drove the snickering lash wickedly into the young noblewoman's
  resilient bare bottom ovals, striping the convulsing hillocks with another
  blazing welt. The mark of the lash was a white crease across the girl's cringing
  flesh, and then as the switch snapped back, the crease reddened and began to
  swell. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the whistling lash sliced into the firm mounds
  of her shuddering bare behind, the lovely sufferer spasmodically thrust her
  half-nude body forward in a wrenching lunge. &nbsp;A plaintive wail was torn
  from the anguished beauty; and under the involuntary lewd pelvic thrust of
  her pain-racked body, the fleecy curls of her downy muff parted, exposing the
  pouting lips of her vulva to the mingled delight and consternation of her mixed
  audience. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Princess Lesley's face flamed as she saw
  the Queen's boorish brother, Sir Richard, lick his thick lips and stare boldly
  at her exposed femininity, his eyes shining with lubricity. &nbsp;Fresh tears
  of shame welled in the girl's wide brown eyes and she saw her kindly aunt gasp
  in shocked horror at this shameful exposure before the men and children in
  the room. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;While the Duke of Reddington and the Lady Isabel
  of Glouchester's diverse emotions were plainly evident; the King's Lord Chamberlain,
  Sir Horace Wilde, showed no sentiment whatsoever. &nbsp;Being a loyal servant
  of many years to the royal household, the taciturn nobleman witnessed the 
naked flogging of the young Princess with an air of quiet detachment. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All eyes followed Miss Simpson as she measure
  her distance for the final cut of the Princess Lesley's twelve stroke count.
  Nervous quiverings shook the luridly-wealed lower hillocks of the girl's punished
  backside as frightful waves of agony swirled along her nerves, centering on
  her flayed rump. With pernicious skill, the unrelenting spinster sent the whipcord
  switch whisking into the tender base of her victim's defenseless lower hemispheres,
  cutting cruelly at the tenderest flesh and overlapping the raised welts of
  prior cuts. The hissing lash seemed to lift the flesh physically as it cut
  and the Princess Lesley threw her head back and screamed raucously as the braided
  trainer chewed hungrily into the raw smarting flesh of her beleaguered bottom . &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once again , as she jerked her writhing
  posterior away from the flaming fury of the searching leather wand, the half-nude
  penitent's hips surged forward and her thighs parted, momentarily displaying
  the silken purse of her sex to the profaning eyes of her audience. After the
  clinging lash had peeled away from her undulating bare buttocks, the unfortunate
  beauty continued to sob brokenly, her breasts heaving with gasping breaths.
  With head bowed and skirt .still raised, the Princess Lesley was the perfect
  epitome of &nbsp;a soundly-whipped schoolgirl despite her twenty-one years
  of age. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queen Margaret gazed smugly at her whimpering
  stepdaughter, well pleased with the effects of the thrashing thus far. Then
  with measured firmness in her voice she calmly announced, &quot;Your punishment
  would be over now, Lesley, if not for your childish impertinence earlier. You've
  got a little supplement coming for that, and then a final test of obedience
  to follow. If I get any resistance, you'll wish you had never been born with
  a bottom, I assure you!&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The stern matriarch then leaned forward and
  fixed her sniffling stepdaughter with an icy stare. She coldly ordered, &quot;Now
  you are going to turn around, bend over, and touch your toes for two extra
  strokes for breaking pose during punishment.&quot; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Vanquished in body and spirit by the onslaught
  of pain to her martyred behind, the young princess of Neufundland &nbsp;province
  docily obeyed her vindictive parent. Keeping her skirt and petticoat well above
  her waist, the tearful sufferer turned and dutifully inclined her half-naked
  body; freely presenting her red-streaked posterior globes to her I waiting
  executioner. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bent as she was, despite her efforts to &nbsp;keep
  her legs tightly together, the cleft striped mounds of the Princess Lesley's
  beaten backside parted, lewdly &nbsp;displaying the pink-lipped seam of her
  slit, lasciviously framed by downy ringlets of dark blonde pubic hair. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Prostrating
  herself in this obscene and shameful position, the girl's blush deepened as
  she felt the degrading coolness of the air on her moist love-slit. Out of maiden
  modesty, the Princess Lesley instinctively tightened the welted cheeks of her
  jutting bottom in a vain effort to diminish her nakedness before the gathered
  nobility. From her inverted pose, she heard her stepmother's terse command. &nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Miss Simpson, please finish this impudent
  baggage's punishment so we can get to our dinner.&quot; Queen Margaret ordered. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Stern housekeeper inclined her head respectfully
  then stepped into position behind the penitent princess. The woman waited patiently
  for her victim to relax the contraction of her tensing buttocks, then impassive
  swept two whistling lashes into the slackly waiting mounds. Cutting just under
  the hemispherical curve of the girl's defenseless bare bottom, the strong driving
  strokes ferociously attacked the tender underbuttocks of the hapless sufferer's
  wobbling hillocks, visibly lifting the jellied mounds of agonized flesh. Piercing
  screams answered each lancinating cut and the limpened cheeks of the Princess
  Lesley's beaten buttocks jiggled furiously under the searing bite of the lash. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To increase her helpless victim's suffering,
  Miss Simpson craftily dealt the final lash of the princess's punishment after
  only a fifteen second interval; driving the evil whalebone switch into the
  screaming girl's writhing bottom ovals just when the pain had reached its peak
  from the prior cut. Skillfully delivered with maximum force on the same band
  of swollen dreadfully-smarting flesh just previously struck, the fiendishly-stinging
  tip of the lash slipped between the shuddering globes of the Princess Lesley's
  tortured behind to come to burning rest in the shadowy crease which separated
  those welt-ridged mounds of striated flesh . 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As the braided tail of the lash plucked venomously
  at her most sensitive flesh just inches from the quaking lips of her cunt,
  the Princess Lesley lifted her head and uttered a savage shriek. The anguished
  beauty's fingertips momentarily left her toes during the involuntary straightening
  of her bent torso. But in a desperate attempt to hold position and not incur
  added abuse to her horribly martyred backside, the young princess frantically
  clasped her slim ankles as searing agony coursed through her pain-racked body.
  The knuckles of the lovely sufferer's hands whitened as she tightly gripped
  her trim ankles while the luridly-wealed cheeks of her throbbing red-streaked
  bottom twitched and heaved spasmodically. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the juncture of the sobbing penitent's svelte
  thighs, beneath the base of her red-striped posterior, the pouting fig of her
  sex peeped back salaciously amidst the involuntary lewd yawning and contracting
  of her tortured gluteal masses. Unchecked tears dotted the stone tiles of the
  dining room floor as the Princess Lesley wept openly, her bent body racked
  by wrenching sobs. The vanquished sufferer was past caring that her enforced
  pose and convulsive quiverings blatantly exposed the most private parts of
  her naked body to the lusting male eyes in her audience. She just knew she
  could not bear another stroke of the whip to her poor piteously-wealed backside. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behind the bowed figure of the whimpering princess,
  Miss Simpson inspected her handiwork, a grim smile momentarily curling the
  thin lips of her cruel mouth. A tapestry of swelling purple and crimson stripes
  blazed brightly on the corrugated skin of the girl's trembling bare bottom,
  as the throbbing twin hillocks of once-creamy flesh continued to twitch and
  shiver where the lash had bitten. The stern disciplinarian looked questioning
  at her employer, her implacably countenance expressionless and hard. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queen Margaret intently observed her stepdaughter's
  scored posterior. Then after a somewhat nervous glance at King Charles, she
  turned to her housekeeper and said, &quot;That should suffice for now, Miss
  Simpson. Please leave the &nbsp;switch in my room.&quot; &nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An almost imperceptible tremor could be detected
  in the Queen's voice during her last command. But after the departure of her
  black-garbed servant, the woman called to the princess in a clear voice. &quot;You
  may get up now, Lesley, and lower your dress.&quot; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Moaning plaintively, the still-sniffling
  penitent I straightened her bowed figure and let her skirt and petticoat fall
  in place. At the touch of her clothing on her still burning flesh, the contrite
  beauty gave a dull gasp as fresh tears welled in her red-rimmed eyes. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young woman's stern parent gave a look of
  complicity to her smirking brother, Sir Richard, then calmly ordered, &quot;Please
  join us at the table, dear.&quot; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a rueful nod of her head, Princess Lesley
  hobbled painfully over to her chair. Each mincing step brought renewed anguish
  to the lovely martyr's beaten bottom as the rubbing of her thighs and the wobbling
  of her swollen nether globes revived the pain of the whipping. Even the simple
  grazing of her clothing on her scorched posterior was agony, and the girl's
  behind felt like it was twice its weight, the richly-wealed cheeks fat and
  heavy. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Princess Lesley paused for a moment as she
  hovered &nbsp;her seared rump over the seat of her chair, a look of despondent
  dismay clouding her pain-ravaged face. Then with a &nbsp;sigh of resignation,
  the unfortunate sufferer gently eased her abused bottom down. At the contact
  of her welt-ridged flesh on the chair seat, the girl bit her lips with a grimace
  as more tears trickled down her cheeks. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queen Margaret smiled grimly as she leaned forward
  and &nbsp;folded her fingers beneath her chin. &nbsp;Fixing her stepdaughter
  with a look very similar to one that a spider would give a &nbsp;fly, the unrelenting
  matriarch announced, &quot;Now then, Lesley. &nbsp;To see if your little lesson
  has had any effect on your behavior and obedience, and seeing as your obstinacy
  has made it necessary for our guests to wait while the maids re-warmed
  the dishes; you are going to give us a little visual diversion. We have seen
  your lovely behind and front already. So all that remains is your breasts.
  Bare your bosom, Lesley. &quot; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The color drained from the Princess Lesley's
  troubled countenance as she stared in disbelief at her smirking tormentor. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queen Margaret returned her stepdaughter's baleful
  stare and said, &quot;I can always send for Miss Simpson, my dear.&quot; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Faced with this dire threat from her vindictive
  adversary, the Princess Lesley reluctantly lifted her hands to the bodice of
  her dress. Outraged shame and hatred blazed in the young woman's tear-swollen
  eyes as she fumbled with the buttons on her dress. True to her stepmother's
  earlier claim, the princess had nothing on beneath her clothing. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Firm and jutting, the highly set snowy-white
  mounds of the blushing penitent's beautiful bosom appeared. The widely spaced
  globes of resilient flesh thrust out boldly from the girl's chest without the
  aid of artificial support. At the crest of each pear-shaped breast, the crinkly
  pink bud of a nipple protruded, centered in the dark coral of its aureole.
  Erratic quivering shook those luscious love gourds as thick tears of shame
  rolled down the sobbing young noblewoman's flushed cheeks. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The girl's domineering parent strode over to
  the wall and pulled a bellrope to summon a maid. Almost immediately, a white-aproned
  servant appeared. The young maid was in her teens and the stupefied look she
  gave the half-nude princess made poor Lesley blush to the roots of her hair. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Queen Margaret looked at the shocked servant
  and calmly said, &quot;Bridget. Our dinner was unexpectedly delayed. Would
  you please see to it that the dishes are heated up again.&quot; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The young girl mumbled, &quot;Yes, your Highness.&quot; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then after a quick curtsey and another furtive
  glance at the Princess Lesley, she scampered out. &nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A quick succession of kitchen servants followed,
  each one either bringing a hot plate of food or removing a cold one. &nbsp;Either
  by coincidence or design, it seemed like a different maid appeared each time
  and the princess's blush spread to her neck and shoulders as the bustling young
  girls all paused long enough in their duties to gaze at the sniffling
  noblewoman's naked humiliation. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the last servant had reluctantly departed,
  the meal proceeded. The Princess Lesley ate little of the food on her plate,
  picking half-heartedly at her dinner while she longed for her ordeal to end.
  It was indeed a painful penance she would not soon forget. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Epilogue 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Night had
  fallen in Neufundland province as darkness descended on the castle of the royal
  family. &nbsp;The Princess Lesley slept fitfully, her flushed cheek pressed
  against a tear-wet pillow. &nbsp;The anguished beauty's nightgown was rucked
  up to her waist and a damp towel covered the tumified flesh of her beaten bare
  buttocks. &nbsp;The young penitent moaned softly in her sleep; no doubt reliving
  the pain and humiliation of her infamous chastisement. &nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;However,
  as the Princess Lesley tossed and turned in her bed, another erotic tableau
  of domestic discipline was unfolding in a different part of &nbsp;Neufundland
  castle; with different participants of royal lineage. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The north
  wing of Neufundland castle housed the royal bed chambers of King Charles and
  his wife, Queen Margaret. &nbsp;The heavy oak door of the hallway leading down
  that empty corridor was bolted from the inside and an eerie stillness hung
  heavy in the cool night air. &nbsp;And while all was quiet in the rest of the
  vast stone building, &nbsp;faint sounds could be heard coming from &nbsp;behind
  the &nbsp;locked door of the royal bed chamber. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A snickering
  lisp threaded through the air, and after a pause another one. &nbsp;Once more
  a muffled snap followed by a moan and a caught cry. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the flickering
  candlelight which illuminated the King and Queen's bedroom, two figures were
  visible, one standing and one prone. &nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen
  Margaret lay naked in all her insolent beauty prostrated over the footrail
  of the bed. &nbsp;At forty years of age, the King's new wife was in the full
  ripeness of her sexuality. &nbsp;&nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Standing
  behind the lush nude body of his squirming spouse, &nbsp;King Charles contemplated
  the fleshy mounds of her out-thrust buttocks. &nbsp;Those full-fleshed posterior
  globes were &nbsp;emblazoned with six livid welts from the same riding switch
  that had done such yeoman's service on the King's own his own daughter Lesley's
  bare backside earlier that evening. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The King's
  ruddy face grew ruddier as he observed his wife's pouting vulva, framed in
  a nest of rich pubic curls at the base of her wealed bottomcheeks between her
  slightly parted thighs. &nbsp;The fleshy petals of the inner lips of Queen
  Margaret's loveslit showed pinkly between the thick, almost rubbery outer folds
  and dewy droplets glistened on the inverted fissure of the opened groove. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;King Charles
  reached down and stroked the empurpled, duck-like head of his heavy phallus
  which probed through the parted folds of his robe. &nbsp;Then, with his erect
  manhood swaying with his movements, the King of Neufundland province stepped
  forward, raised his arm, and dealt another slicing cut into the cringing mounds
  of the Queen's squirming bare behind. &nbsp;The eel-like switch buried itself
  in the yielding flesh of the two glorious naked hemispheres, flattening the
  flinching globes before snapping back elastically; leaving a scorching twin-tracked
  weal in its wake. &nbsp;Warming to his task, King Charles then pivoted to his
  right and delivered a sweeping backhanded stroke into the jellied mounds of
  his wife's martyred bare behind. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Face down
  on the bed, Queen Margaret heard the familiar sinister swishing sound as the
  leather switch descended and slashed across her naked, shuddering hindquarters. &nbsp;She
  heard her own involuntary, choking, gasping cry and tasted the shaming tears
  that trickled down her flushed cheeks. &nbsp;While the suffering noblewoman
  cursed the flagging strength in her body as her will weakened under the onslaught
  of pain to her cringing, welt-ridged buttocks; she also damned her own bravado
  when she had agreed to her husband's decree upon relinquishing the upbringing
  and discipline of his headstrong daughter. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Under the
  King's motto, �Don't demand anything of our young, we wouldn't take ourselves.�,
  each of the Princess Lesley's prescribed chastisements would be repeated on
  the Queen's royal, bare backside the same evening. &nbsp;That would explain
  the uneasiness in Queen Margaret's voice earlier in the day when she had allotted
  extra strokes of the lash to her defiant step-daughter; knowing she herself
  would receive them as well. &nbsp;It also explained why the Queen took to her
  room for several days following the Princess Lesley's past whippings, citing
  womanly problems or some other malady, lest her unsteady gait or mincing step
  betrayed the state of her own punished posterior. &nbsp;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With his
  stony erection hardening even more, King Charles continued to ply the lash
  to his naked spouse's condemned behind. &nbsp;And while he did not possess
  the cunning and dexterity of a skillful and experienced chastiser like Miss
  Simpson, the robust monarch's strength and vigor served him well in his fustigatory
  efforts. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For as many
  as eleven cuts, Queen Margaret stoically held back her cries. &nbsp;But she
  could hear her strangled, teeth-clenching gasps become louder and more unrestrained,
  more high-pitched, as stroke by stroke, what self-control she had left slipped
  away. &nbsp;At the twelfth cut, her fortitude gave way and the suffering noblewoman
  began to cry out musically, with full-throated yelps of pain, at each succeeding
  lash of the rapier-like switch. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Queen's
  screams and lamentations rang off the walls of the royal bed chamber and echoed
  down the deserted stone corridor of the hallway as the searching leather wand
  licked and snapped at the corrugated flesh of her trembling, furiously-wealed
  bottomglobes. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And while
  the Princess Lesley was unaware of what was taking place in the opposite wing
  of Neufundland castle; she would have undoubtedly slept more soundly had she
  known, that at that moment, another sore-bottomed member of the royal family
  was also learning the true meaning of discipline.







 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Epilogue
