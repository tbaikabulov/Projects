Police officer Jocelyn Devereaux loved nailing guys like this.� These rich guys in their Lamburgini's think they own the world.� As she emerged from her patrol car and walked up up to the luxury sports car, she thought how much she enjoyed writing these tickets.

"License and registration."

The man behind the wheel fumbled nervously in his wallet, finally finding the necessary documents and turning them over.

Jocelyn took them, read them, hesitated, read them again, and said, "Steven?"

The man behind the wheel for the first time took a good look at his interrogator and said, "Jocelyn?"

"Yeah, Steven, good to see you.� How have you been?"

"It's good to see you, too.� Um, well, except for the moment, I've been good.� You?"

Jocelyn's mind flashed back to high school.� Steven was someone she knew well, but had not given a lot of thought to, then or since.� He had not been the type of guy she normally dated---though looking at his car, she thought that might have been a mistake.� Normally, she preferred more athletic men, whom she would systematically break, one after another.� She didn't care if they were sweet and kind or arrogant and egotistical.� She, at 6 feet tall, 160 lbs, had been a star of the track team.� She threw the shotput, the hammer, and the javelin.� Any boy who dated her learned that they would be bent to her will, physically overpowered and sexually dominated.� And she dated many of them.� She hadn't been interested in maintaining any long-term relationships, but rather sought to impose her sexual will on many of her fellow athletes.� She did it because she could and, frankly, because she enjoyed it.

Steven had not been an athlete.� He was more of a ... nerd.� He was a lot shorter than Jocelyn but he participated in the sports arena by being the manager of the girls track and field team.� They all knew him then, and even a couple of the lesser girls dated him a bit, but he wasn't the type of guy Jocelyn was interested in breaking, since, to her, at the time, he already seemed emasculated.� Still, she and many of the girls could not help but admire his willingness to do the job despite putting up with a lot of ribbing and hazing from the guys.

"Oh, good, Steve, I've been good.� Look, I won't write you a ticket today, although normally I would.� Just slow it down, okay?� You wouldn't want to ruin a nice ride like that."

"Uh, thanks."� Steven was in a bit of daze.� He never in his life imagined he would run into Jocelyn again, much less as a police officer who was writing him a ticket.� She still looked magnificent to him, tall, pretty, and very shapely.� He remembered her reputation for making candy-asses of her boyfriends, but frankly he secretly didn't mind that idea at all.� He always thought she was a goddess who deserved to be worshipped anyway.� He decided to take a chance and wanted to keep the conversation going before she just walked away.

"It's okay with me if you write the ticket.� I had it coming.� I knew I was going too fast.� The car is new, so I was kind of seeing what it could do."

"Apparently, it can do a lot," Jocelyn replied.� Curiousity got the better of her.� "I don't mean to be nosy, but what do you do that you can afford one of these things?" 

"Ah, yes, well, I guess you might say right now I am retired.� After we graduated, I went to college and got involved in a number of high-tech start-ups of fellow students and professors.� Unlike many of them, however, I got out before it all crashed down.� Overall, I was pretty smart with my money, if I do say so.� I saved it and didn't spend it foolishly---with this car being the exception.� I'm now looking for something to focus my energy on but I am not in a hurry.� I don't actually need to work for a living ever again."

"Really?"� Jocelyn was now definitely thinking she should have paid more attention to Steven in school.

Steven tooked the plunge:� "Say, would you like to get together sometime, you know, for old time's sake?"

"That could be nice, Steven.���Why don't you give me your phone number and I'll call you." 

Steven hoped for a more affirmative answer than that, but accepted it was probably the best he was going to do.� He gave her a card with his number on it.� None was offered in return.� Jocelyn found the idea of seeing Steven appealing, not least because of his obvious wealth, but wasn't really sure about it.� While she was no longer the immature girl of 16 who only cared about breaking boys' spirits, one way or another, she was still a very dominant personality.� Any relationship was by definition going to be unequal and she wasn't sure yet how she wanted to play this yet. The two old acquaintances parted company.

The next day, frustrated by his inability to convince Jocelyn to give him her number, he decided to see if he could get himself pulled over again by her.� He drove too fast past the same spot at the same time.� Sure enough, a police car soon followed him with sirens blaring, he pulled over.� As luck would have it, Officer Devereaux got out of that car.� Now Jocelyn was annoyed at what she interpreted to be Steven's disrespect by commiting the exact same violation as the previous day.� This time she took a more direct approach.

"Get out of the car, Steven, turn around, and put your hands on the roof."� Steven did as he was told.� "Are you trying to piss me off now?" she yelled at him.� "Yesterday, you want to go out, today you make a mockery of what I do for a living!"

Steven was now concerned he had overplayed his hand.� "No, no, that isn't it," he pleaded desperately.� "I just wanted to see you again and you hadn't given me your phone number, so . . ."

"So you thought you'd try to get arrested again by me.� Fine.� You're arrested.� Spread you legs."� Jocelyn started to frisk him.� "If we were going to get together, it was going to be my decision, not yours."� At that moment, Jocelyn was checking at out the waist area of her violator and noticed he was sport a considerable hard-on inside his pants.� So he is liking this, she thought.

"All right, let's sort both of these things out now.� First, here is your ticket.� You're paying for this, no more warnings.� Second, if you're serious about wanting to see me, come by at this address tonight.� I'll be driving."

Steven grinned and Jocelyn, her anger abating, gave him a small smile back.� Having a rich boyfriend, who was willing to be controlled by her, could have many benefits she thought.

That night, Steven found Jocelyn's condo and knocked on the door at the apppointed time.� When Jocelyn opened, she was dressed to kill: red blouse and black leather pants.� "You look beautiful."

"Thank you.� You cleaned up pretty well yourself."� She meant it.� Steven wore a suit and looked good.� "Let's go."� She walked past Steven to the elevator who scrambled a bit to keep up with the long strides of his date.� Once they got outside, Steven asked:� "Where's your car?"

"I said I was driving, Steve, but we're going in your car."� She saw the Lamburghini and headed for it.� Steven surrendered the keys and they drove off.� 

Dinner went well.���They discussed the old days from school, people they knew, their respective careers and life events in more detail. They actually found they shared a number of views of those times in common. For example, both had a high degree of contempt for the male athletes on the track team. Finally, they ended back at Jocelyn's condo.� 

"Want to come up for a drink?" Jocelyn asked.

"You know I'd love to," Steven answered with a grin.

Once inside, Jocelyn dropped the pretense it was for a drink.� "Why don't you strip, Steven, and let me have a look at you."

"Uh, you mean right now? Completely?"

"Yes, unless you have other plans?"

"Um, no, okay."� Steven hesitated a few moments more while Jocelyn gazed at him.� She had poured herself a drink but hadn't followed up her offer from downstairs to Steven.� She just waited for him to undress.� It was clear to him that nothing more would happen at all until he complied.� So he did.� 

Once he was down to his birthday suit, Jocelyn got up and looked him over.� Under the circumstances, he could help but sport a raging erection which he could do little to hide.� "Not bad, not bad at all, Steve."� Jocelyn meant that and was referring to the entire package.� Steven was not muscular but wiry.� Physically, though, he would be no match for her.� No fat at all and his cock was at least average in size, if not a little better.� It would do.

Joceyln got up and took Steven by the hand and led him to her bedroom.� Once inside, she began kissing Steven, while still standing.� After a few minutes, she added, "help me get out of this dress."� Fumbling from sheer excitment, it took Steven some time before he was finally able to remove all of Jocelyn's clothes as she had told him.� She was as fantastic as he had always imagined.� Tall, with legs that seemed to go on forever, her ass was substantial but very round and tight, her breasts the size of cantalopes, and her groin neatly trimmed.� But what struck Steven more than anything at first was Jocelyn's muscles.� She was actually ripped.� Her legs, arms, and chest sported clear muscle development, perhaps not as exaggerated as you would see in a muscle-building magazine, but Jocelyn had clear muscle definition all over.

Once she was completely naked, Jocelyn asked:� "Do you like my muscles?"
� 
Steven wasn't honestly sure what his answer was at first.� In his eye, Jocelyn was gorgeous and her muscles didn't make her any less so.� Yet, he thought, she has way more muscles than I do.� She clearly can kick my ass, if she chose to.� Still, the sight of this tall, pretty, muscled amazon in front of him made his mouth go dry.� In the end, he had only one possible answer:� "God, yes, you're stunning."

Jocelyn walked over to Steven.� "I want you worship my muscles Steven."� She then gently but quite firmly pushed down on Steven's shoulders until he got the message that he was to get down on his knees. Steven wasn't quite sure what she meant and looked up at her with a slightly quizzical look on his face.� Jocelyn towered over him in that position and exuded raw power in the buff, very much including raw sexual power.� "Rub them, all over, with both hands, massage the muscles of my legs, feel them as I flex them."

Steven began doing as he was told.� Slowly he began using both of his hands to stroke and massage Jocelyn's legs, first one then the other.� She would periodically flex them as he did so, and Steven could feel how they would become almost like steel in his hands.� After a time, Jocelyn squatted in front of him and offered her arms for him to worship, as she pumped and flexed them as well.� As he worked on Jocelyn's arms, Steven thought how he had nothing to compare with what this woman had.

Finally Jocelyn stood up and sat down on the bed.� "Come up here, Steve." 

Now you're talking, Steve thought.

"Wrestle me."� 

"What?"

Jocelyn repeated:� "I said, wrestle me.� Show me what you can do."

Steven hesitated before answering.� "Uh, okay, but let's face it:� I don't really know anything about wrestling and, well, you're clearly stronger than I am."

"Well, we don't really know that until you try, do we?"� Jocelyn smiled.

Steven said, "sure I'm game," and grinned.

Thinking his only chance was going to be surprise, Steven immediately launched himself at Jocelyn pushing her back on the bed, climbing on top of her and pushed Jocelyn's hands down, pinning them above her head.� Jocelyn squealed in delight at the surprise but within seconds and without moving her hands, Jocelyn used her powerful legs to push up, raising both her buttocks and Steven off the bed.� Once in the air, she swung one leg up and pushed Steven back so that he fell backward on the bed, releasing Jocelyn's arms, and finding one of her muscled legs underneath his back and the other now coming down on top of his chest and clamping together in a body sissors.

"That wasn't a bad move, Steven, but it isn't that easy to keep me down."

"Yeah, I see that," he replied gasping for some air.� As he struggled some more to try and escape the powerful lock of Jocelyn's legs, he added, "don't you think this proves I'm no match for you?"

"Oh, perhaps, but we can't be too sure right away," Jocelyn laughed.� "Besides I'm having way too much fun!� Try to fight back!"

Jocelyn then grabbed one of Steven's arms and turned herself over and releasing his body just enough to pull his head into a sissors lock of her thighs.� Steven was now having his neck squeezed while his faced was pressed against Jocelyn's ass.� He tried to pull her legs apart with her arms but found them impossible to budge.

What Jocelyn was doing hurt him some, but, he thought, it was a hell of a view.

After a few minutes of Steven's grunting and begging for some mercy, Jocelyn finally loosened her legs to allow his head to move a little.

"Kiss my ass, Steven.� Then lick it.� Lick the muscles with your warm tongue."

Steven did as he was told, and frankly could do little else. 

After some time spent in this position, Jocelyn held Steven in place, turned her body around, flipping the position of her legs until she had one leg circling the back of Steven's had with her other thigh beside his head.� His face was pressed up against her pussy and the more she pulled on her leg, the more his face would press against her sex.� 

"Pleasure me, Steven, until I tell you stop."

Steven, clearly recognizing that he had lost all control of what would happen and when, did as he was told.� Jocelyn held Steven's head in place first with her legs, and then added her hands, sometimes directing his movements as he brought her to two successive orgasms.� "Once more."� Jocelyn laid back on the bed, but continuing to hold his head tightly in placed with her long, muscled legs, as he lapped and sucked this Amazon goddess to a third event.� At no time during these acrobatics did Steven lose his erection, she noticed.� And only once she was finished did Jocelyn turn Steven over and climb on top and proceed to to make love to him, on top, biting his nipples, and pinning his wrists to the bed as she did so.� Finally, Jocelyn lowered herself onto Steven's rock-hard cock and rode him until he exploded inside of her.

Steven stayed over at Jocelyn's that night, but little more occurred.� Jocelyn cradled his head against her bosom as they slept and in the morning Steven had to leave for an appointment.� He made coffee and left a note hoping she would call him again that day.� 

As he drove off, he wasn't sure what to make of it.� He was thrilled to have reconnected with a girl he had worshipped in school but it was equally clear that their relationship was not an equal one.� Jocelyn clearly expected to be in control and he wasn't sure how he felt about it.� On the one hand, he couldn't believe how lucky he was to be involved in a sexual relationship with a woman with a body as hot as Jocelyn's, even if she was at least as attracted to his money as to him.� On the other hand, he got the sense that if this was how their first time went, he could only imagine what the nature of their relationship would be in a couple of months. He'd read enough porn over the years to recognize that Jocelyn was at best a control freak and at worst a full blown dominatrix who would eventually reduce him to a complete state of sexual slavery.� And disturbingly, his cock got really hard when he turned that phrase, "sexual slavery," over in his
mind.

About two hours later, his cell phone went off.� Jocelyn was on the other end.� 

"Hi Steve."� He could tell right away from her tone of voice that she was a little ticked at him for leaving before she woke, but hoped the note helped.� "I must say I was pissed off at first that you weren't here when I woke up, but you redeemed yourself by making coffee, and leaving a note with your cell."

"Thank goodness," Steven replied.� "I'd love to see you again.� Can I come over again tonight?� I'll take you to dinner."

"Tonight won't work."� That's not true, Jocelyn thought, but she wanted to exercise control over the pace and tempo, and putting him off one night wouldn't hurt.� "Tomorrow is better.� I'll expect to see you at 7 again."� And after a little more chit-chat, they hung up.

The next night went a lot like the first night out.� Steven drove to Jocelyn's apartment, and they left for dinner with her driving his car.� Dinner went nicely, and Jocelyn and Steven found that they had a surprising ability to converse with each other, despite the quite different paths each took after school.� And they shared many attitudes about politics (moderately conservative), religion (agnostic at best), and values.� 

In the course of dinner, Steven found his attraction to Jocelyn growing stronger and stronger.� She was tall, beautiful, and powerful and he found that combination increasingly intoxicating.� He wanted to be with her.� He had to be with her!

For her part, Jocelyn saw in Steven, perhaps, just the kind of long-term relationship that could work for her.� She liked him:� he was more engaging, and more confident than she had remembered in high school.� Maybe it was his maturity, or perhaps it was hers.� He was rich and money always helped---a lot.� She had plans for some of that money to fulfill some of her ambitions.� And, after last night, it was clear that Steven would, rather quickly she thought, accept her complete domination of him, especially sexually, but in other ways as well.� Jocelyn had no interest in carrying on in a relationship with a man she could not dominate and control on a daily basis.� She had known about that aspect of her personality since she was child.� Unfortunately, so many of her fellow police officers were the same way, any relationships started through her department never lasted.� She wasn't sure how Steven would react to the more extreme forms domination and�discipline she would ultimately subject him to, but she suspected by the time she got around to he would be completely enthralled with her.� Regardless, not being the most patient woman, she would press ahead just the same.

After dinner, Jocelyn wasted little time in going back to her apartment and taking Steven to bed.� Jocelyn played pretty much the same wrestling game with Steven she had the night before, the only difference being that this night, after she flipped Steven over on his back and she climbed on top of him, she pulled her handcuffs out of the nightstand and against Steven's mild protestations secured his wrists to the brass bedframe.� Steven was in that position a long time before Jocelyn finally concluded her games with him and released him to actually sleep with her.

The two lovers did not see each for the next two days, as Jocelyn had the night shift.� Jocelyn didn't want to overdo it right away anyway.� It was Sunday afternoon before they were able to hook up again and while they watched some football, Jocelyn decided to get some fun in before they went out for dinner.

"Steve, did you ever play cops and robbers when you were a kid?"

"Well, yes, I guess so.� I don't remember playing it much, though."

"Really?� I played it all the time.� I was always the cop."� 

"Surprise, surprise."

Jocelyn let the silence go for several seconds.� "Would you like to play cops and robbers now?"

Steven grinned, though a little nervously, "okay, sure.� What do you have in mind?"

Jocelyn showered a wide smile on Steven.� "Well, I'll leave and you act like you are ransacking the place.� I come in, surprising you, and we'll just play it from there.� Sounds like fun?"

"Uh, sure."

Jocelyn got up and put all of her police equipment back on, although he noticed she did not put on regulation boots.� She had grabbed a pair that went up her thighs and had three-inch heels.� 

"Okay, you should get up and start messing up the place a bit---but not too much---till I come back."� With that Jocelyn left and Steven could hear the thud of her boots walking off.

Steven thought that getting "arrested" by Jocelyn and "stripped search" would be fun, so after messing the living room a bit, he decided he would be "found" in the bedroom.� So he moved in there and started to rummage through her drawers, lingering a little too much in in the lingerie drawer.

"Freeze fucker!"� Steven jumped at the sound of Jocelyn's voice.� He couldn't believe how quietly she had come back in to play their game.� He didn't move but looked back and saw her with her gun pointed at him.� She's playing it real, he thought.

"What the hell are you doing in my apartment?" Jocelyn asked.� 

"Uh, I, uh, found the door open and thought something was wrong, so I came in," Steven offered in his best roleplay voice.� 

"Bullshit.� You're a thief, and a stupid one, too! You picked the apartment of a cop to rob."

Officer Jocelyn walked over to Steven and shoved him hard against the wall and then forcibly handcuffed his hands behind his back.� She then "searched" her suspect very thoroughly, noting with satisfaction that Steven had a bulging erection inside his pants.� "This won't do.� I'm going to have to strip-search you."� With that, Jocelyn tore Steven's shirt off him and pulled his pants and underwear off, leaving him naked but excited.

Steven was getting into this now.� "Please officer, I can't go up for this.� It will be my third strike.� I'll do anything.� Please!"� Steven hoped he sounded convincing.

"Anything, huh?"� Jocelyn said.� And with that, she shoved Steven to his knees, still handcuffed.� "Maybe we can come to some arrangement.� Keep your head down!� Don't look at me."

Steven could hear rustling and zippers and the shuffling of clothing.� Finally, with his head still looking at the floor, a pair of high heeled black boots came into view.� Those boots went between his legs, forcing them further apart, which had the affect of making him sit lower to the ground

"Look at me."� Steven looked up and, despite their encounter a two nights before, it took his breath away.���Jocelyn still had on thigh-high black boots with three-inch heels, a very tight-fitting police shirt opened, black gloves, her officer's cap, and nothing else.� Jocelyn's tall, lean, muscular body towered over him.� 

With her long legs, her heeled boots, and the position he was in, Jocelyn's neatly trimmed bush was positioned just above Steven's head.� Grabbing a fistful of Steven's hair and pulling his head back, Jocelyn stepped forward and positioned her sex right over Steven's mouth.� "You pathetic scum, you know what to do, worship your superior!"� 

As Steven went to work in this little game and Jocelyn thought about the nature of her emerging relationship with Steven, her mind could not help but drift back to her age of puberty when she first became aware of what was involved in sexually dominating a male.� 
�


She had gotten awake very late one night when was just 12, but well along in physical and hormonal development. It was probably around 1:00 am and as she quietly walked to bathroom, she saw a light and heard some noise coming from her parents' room.� Her mother was a tall majestic woman and remembered how�she ruled the house with an iron fist.� More than six feet tall and carrying an extra 50 pounds, her mother nevertheless retained a magnificient---albeit large---hourglass and feminine figure.� Her father was a study in contrast:� three inches shorter and reed thin.

But that night, as she ever so quietly approached her parent's room and peered through the crack in the door, she saw a sight that at first shocked and then mesmerized her.� Her mother's large frame was encased in a tightly-laced black leather corset causing her already massive breasts to spill over the top and look even larger than life.� She wore tall, tight-fitting black boots that bit into her flesh.� Her father was kneeling on the floor with his head to the ground and her mother's three-inch heeled boot was planted firmly on the back of his neck.� She held in one hand a chain that was attached to her father's neck and pulled tight.� In her other hand was a long leather riding crop which her mother brought down again and again across her father's back and buttocks, cutting a red smile into his flesh every time she struck, all the while he whimpered and pleaded for mercy.� 

Finally when her mother stopped striking her father after what seemed to be 20� blows, she brought her father's mouth to her groin where her massive thighs and pussy seemed to swallow his head whole.� "Now eat me!" she remembered her mother commanding.� As she forced him to pleasure her with a tight grip on what little she could see of his head, it was clear that her mother was in esctasy, with her eyes closed, her tongue wetting her lips, and her father's head encased inside her mother's powerful looking thighs.� Clearly her father wasn't going anywhere anytime soon.� What also impressed Jocelyn was how large and thick her father's cock was throughout the abuse and control her mother inflicted on him.� Even at that precocious age, she knew that when a man's cock was erect and hard, he was enjoying what he was doing.

Jocelyn remembered she watched her parents like this for what must have been at least 20 minutes and at least two more orgasms.� And when that was done, her mother forced her father onto his back on the floor, she then slid her father's cock inside of her pussy, bent down to smother his face with her mammoth breasts and pounded them both to a climax.� Jocelyn was certain her father suffered pain under her mother's relentless fucking but soon he too let out the sounds of joy that came from shooting his load into her mother.

Jocelyn watched this all to the very end, until her parents settled down to sleep, interestingly with the chain remaining around her father's neck for the night (although it was nowhere to be seen when she saw him in the morning).� She went back to bed, her heart pounding, unable (and unwilling) to expunge the images from her mind. With with her own groin tingling uncontrollably, she rubbed it to a climax to release the sensation, allowing her to sleep.

She witnessed this at least a dozen times more over the years she was still at home and on more than one occasion she thought she saw her mother fleetingly catch her eye through the door crack when she had gotten a little too close.� She never knew if she was right about that and whether her mother was trying to subtly influence her impressionable daughter's sexual makeup in favor of female domination or whether it had been her imagination.� But the result was that Jocelyn knew from that point on that this was how she wanted men: they would submit to her, be her sexual plaything---indeed, slave---or she would have nothing to do with them.� She wanted to have men in the exact same way her mother dominated her father.

God gave her the face, body, and strength that made the outcome of any relationship she had with a boy a foregone conclusion.
�
But as Steven bought her ever closer to an orgasm, Jocelyn's thoughts recentered on what was going on right now and the "game" she was playing.� 

After climaxing, Jocelyn said:� "All right you have a choice!� I can turn you in and you most certainly will go to jail.� Or you can agree to stay her and be my slave for as long as I find you amusing!"

Steven grinned.� "I'll take Door B!"

Jocelyn broke out laughing at Steven's enthusiasm and after a good, solid spanking, and an extended round of fucking where she pounded Steven's body for a good half an hour, they both collapsed and went to sleep.� As she drifted off, Jocelyn thought that while she had never been inclined to settle down before, having a rich slave-boyfriend did seem quite appealing, as perhaps did the idea of a slave-husband.� She imagined she could put Steven's money to good use, in particular furthering her ambitions for a female body-building career.� In light of his enthusiastic response to her domination of him, she expected Steven would hardly mind if she developed a few more muscles.
