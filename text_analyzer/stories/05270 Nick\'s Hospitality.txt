Thank
you readers!� I welcome ANY and ALL
feedback- good or bad.� This is my first
time doing this, as I know it is for many others-

and I
really would appreciate the comments.�
Oh, and there is more to the story- this first part is slow, but the
second part is not.

&nbsp;

I moved
in with Nick when I finally hit rock bottom.�
Jobless and homeless for over two months- having crashed in apartments
of family for too long now, starting to stink like fish, I had to try something
new. 

&nbsp;

Nick
was the slickest kind of charmer- meek and soft-spoken and willing to please,
but truly a devious manipulator inside.�
He offered me half of his apartment at my first mention to him of my
situation.� I refused repeatedly-
thinking I would never let it come to that. But soon his offer became the last
vestige of hospitality I could find, and I was hard-pressed to refuse any
longer.� 

&nbsp;

Reviving chivalry with fanfare and
flourish, Nick took the few bags I had and wouldn't let me lift a finger to put
anything away myself.� He insisted I
relax on the couch.� He even remembered
to put marshmallows and a cinnamon stick in the hot chocolate he made for
me.� How thoughtful that he remembered
exactly how I had told him I liked it once- a long, long time ago.� 

&nbsp;

This
treatment was the precursor to a beautiful honeymoon Nick and I shared
briefly.� He wooed me and bewitched me
perfectly.� Even without the drug he was
putting in my drinks, unknown to me at the time, I would have sat cozily
nestled in the palm of his hands.� 

&nbsp;

The plan Nick had plotted all along became unhidden
one evening when I began throwing up.�
Awful, violent retching consumed me till my eyes were teary and the gunk
in the toilet was tinted with red.� I
felt chills all over- it turned out my temperature was over 103.� I had no medical insurance, so I thought I
would just have to bear it out, hoping it was a simple bug that would leave
after its unwelcome 24-hour tour of my body.

&nbsp;

Nick
was still the perfect gentlemen and the perfect nursemaid.� After a couple of days with no reprieve from
the sickness, I asked Nick's opinion.� I
thought he would have some insight based on his medical background at
Columbia.� He mumbled something
technically obscure and came up with the idea that I needed to go see a friend
of his, an internist nearby, who would have the tools to diagnose me
correctly.� Nick assured me that he
would take care of any fees incurred.� I
was not in a state to argue very clearly even if I had wanted to, so I agreed.

&nbsp;

The doctor made his
inspections and prescribed a remedy for me- of which he handily happened to
have samples in his office.� I thanked
him for his help and Nick took me home.�


&nbsp;

The medication worked quickly and wondrously- I
almost felt high.� But I thought it was
my imagination.� Nick, of course, took
care of dosing me- so I never even knew where he kept the drugs or what they
were.� 

&nbsp;

Then
another evening, I had the same symptoms of that night before.� That is when Nick checkmated me.� While I knelt over the bowl, my eyes blurred
from the tears, and my throat too raw to cry, he crouched next to me, his hands
pulling back my now disgustingly matted hair.�
He put his lips next to my ear to whisper the truth of my life during
the past two months with him.� 

&nbsp;

&quot;Ah,
Mara, you're undone now.� Your body
needs something, doesn't it?� Do you
feel an inescapable craving, a harrowing yearning for something?� Something- and you don't even know
what?&quot;

&nbsp;

I was
in a fog, so wearied from all the retching, I couldn't think enough to realize
I didn't know what the hell he was talking about.� But the words he said clicked- I did _need_ something, but
what?� I wasn't clear-headed enough to
wonder why- why did I feel this burning need, borne only of drug addiction,
which I remembered well from my long-ago coke-stupored days.� In those moments so weak, I just knew I
needed it, and it seemed Nick had it for me.�
Always the gentleman. 

&nbsp;

He
continued whispering, straight into my brain, &quot;Mara, do you know what you
want?� Do you know what I have for
you?� I can make you feel so much
better.� I can make you feel normal
again.&quot;� Then he chuckled- like I'd
never heard him do before.� It was
suspiciously eerie, and almost... sadistic.�
I still couldn't come out of my haze enough to respond properly to his
change of attitude and tone... I was balanced just between this need he
described and my dignity, which I sensed he was about to throw on the floor and
grind to dust under his boots.� 

&nbsp;

I
managed, &quot;Yes, help me, Nick.�
Please, I do need something.� I
know you can help me.&quot;� Completely
losing the struggle between my physical and my spiritual beings, I heard myself
begging him to sate the desire I had.� I
was fiending, I finally realized it.�
But why? Now I did ask myself... but only briefly, before I retched
again, ripping myself apart inside.� 

&nbsp;

Nick
had positioned his body right behind mine.�
We had never slept together in all this time- he had gallantly insisted
I take the bed and he never once even asked for it.� But now, somehow, his body's front pressed to my body's back
brought sexual thoughts to mind- forceful, non-consenting ones.� Ones I probably would not enjoy.� My mind remembered briefly a little debate
Nick and I had made on the phone once.�
Does a woman�s body enjoy any intercourse, even if unwelcome?� I claimed no, but his defense for the
opposite stance was the wetness proof.�
I wondered if he had had this plan in mind at the time.� I wondered if it also came to his mind in
this moment, as it did to mine.

&nbsp;

I felt
his strong body press into my back, forcing my chest against the bowl, just
enough to slightly wind me.� His hands
reached around my waist and up to claim my breasts- but somehow I wasn't as
shocked as I certainly should have been.�
Could I refuse these advances in my state?� I was sick from whatever drug my body was not getting and I couldn't
say no to the physical needs that were now ruling me.� 

&nbsp;

As he
squeezed my breasts, surprisingly not roughly, he kept talking quietly to me,
&quot;Mara, do you want it?� Do you want
what I can give you?� Do you want the
medicine I have for you, dear?� Your
body is punishing you severely because you've gone without.� You need it- you need it so badly inside
you.� You can have it, just ask me for
it, Mara.� Ask me as nicely as you can,
baby, and I�ll give it to you.� I�ll
provide you with everything you need, Mara.&quot;� He punctuated these words with a kiss- much rougher than his
hands on my breasts- behind my ear.� The
kiss soon became a nibble, teeth sharp and large on my skin, until I yelped. 

&nbsp;

What
could I do?� I could try to fight him,
but I doubted I would win.� Here he had
me pinned, literally and metaphorically.�
And though the double meaning of his &quot;offer&quot; was not lost on
me, and I didn't want the sinuous one that he was forcing on me now anyway, I
felt completely cornered.� But from that
corner, my mind gave a weak shout of &quot;Fight, Mara!� Don't let him do this!&quot;� I almost thought I could try to jab
backwards and elbow him, but even then, as if he could hear my thoughts as
well, he pressed tighter against me, leaving no elbowroom for me at all.

&nbsp;

I was
left with nothing but begging.� My drug
addiction was controlling me more strongly than the sense of self I had.� The fiending need was crawling all over my
skin from the inside, becoming intolerable.�
I felt sensations simultaneously burning cold and freezing hot all over;
my head pounded with an inexplicable fear and nervousness.� Twitches and tremors ran through my fingers
and toes.� I could not endure it
anymore.� I had to have the remedy for
this chemical dependence Nick had forced on me.� I gave in and didn't turn back for a long time.

&nbsp;

&quot;Nick,
please, give me what I need.� I know you
have it.� Please just give it to me
now.� I don't know what it is, but
please let me have it.&quot;� Even
though I felt that was my only option- to beg him this way- it wasn't at all
easy to do.� I hated hearing those words
coming from my own mouth, even in a voice so quiet and small and forced.� Nick noticed how unenthusiastic my pleading
was.� He didn't like it.� 

&nbsp;

&quot;No,
Mara, that won't do,&quot; he said as he squeezed my nipples painfully and
pulled my head back by the hair so my eyes met his.� &quot;I said to ask me _nicely_, little chienne.� Make me feel your need.� Let me hear the desperation in your
'Please'.� Make it tangible, give it a
body I can touch and squeeze just like the body I'm holding now.&quot;� He shoved against my back and mashed my
breasts in his big hands.� I had to
scream, I had to, but my throat was too raw, so the tears just welled up more
in my eyes.� I realized he enjoyed that-
that's what he was looking for.

&nbsp;

&quot;Nick,
please,&quot; I cried, meaning it more now, letting more feeling into it, my
pride dissipating into clouds that rose far away from me.� &quot;Please, please, please,&quot; I just
kept repeating, each one sounding more and more despicably sycophantic to my
ears.� Each one bringing out new
watersheds of tears for the nightmare into which I'd let myself.

&nbsp;


 
 

 
 
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
  
 
 
 

 


&nbsp;

I open my eyes to see Nick's balls above my face,
waiting to be dipped.� Every time I open
my mouth to let him in- whether balls, shaft, tongue, finger, or any other tool
of invasion he chooses- the shame and humiliation rise quietly in my mind,
taking me back to that first night.�
When the voice of dignity becomes so persistent that I start to listen,
my craving kicks in.� I need the
synthetic heroin Nick has been feeding me.�
So I open my mouth now, voraciously, to satisfy his sadistic desire to
see me so desperately needy.� He likes
to wait to give me the dope- he waits till I can't stand it anymore.� He likes the tears in my eyes, the anguish
in my voice, knowing he controls it all.�
Knowing he controls all of me.� 

&nbsp;

When I
get that strung-out, I let him do anything to me, just to have what I
need.� I let him make me do anything
too- disgusting things, unimaginably humiliating things.� I'm so detached from them that I can think
about them easily. I've detached myself from my own pride, out of
self-preservation, so as not to feel the self-loathing that would crush me if I
didn't.� 

&nbsp;

As I
continue to mouth Nick's sac now, greedily, he grabs the sides of my head to
help the process along.� I caress his
asscheeks going up and down, grazing my chest.�
Sometimes I don�t know if the pure physical beauty of this body-
wonderfully tight and strong, with the right amount of hair everywhere- makes
the ordeal more or less bearable.� His
face is just as beautiful, like Inigo Montoya from the Princess Bride.� I stare up at what I can see of it now,
hidden behind his shaft.� 

�

He
starts talking to me- quietly at first, so I can't understand his words.� Then he raises his voice just enough so I
hear him tell me what a good job I'm doing, with vulgarity he only uses in
fevered moments of passion.� He tells me
I'm the best cum sow he's ever owned, better than any ball-sucking bitch he
could buy.� And he didn't even have to
pay for me.� He always praises himself
on how he got me with his own cunning.�
I've heard all his talk before.�
I'm no longer insulted.� In fact,
I mostly agree.� It's hard to think I
was ever anything more than his junkie slave. 

&nbsp;


 
 

 


&nbsp;

Sometimes
he demands my active participation in the verbal barrage, making it a dialogue
between us.� He tells me what to say,
although I know what he wants to hear already.�
Feeling powerless to refuse, I collaborate with creative self-effacing
descriptions to fuel his ego.� Between
mouthfuls of his penis, I chant my submission to him with words of his own
style.� Those were the words he wanted
dragged out of me; they were difficult at first me for me to say, but
resignation makes them flow now from me like my first tears did.� My speech brings Nick to the edge, my hard
palate the freefall cliff for the jizz of his hard member.� Now he gags me, cutting my breath off
momentarily, making me swallow, as always, until he finally pulls himself out.� 

&nbsp;

I lie
in the bed, under Nick�s crotch, his flaccidness on my cheek.� It is a familiar position for both of us,
almost comfortable now for me.�� I�m
accustomed to my body being an object of use for the man sitting on top of me-
I�m his pillow, his bedframe, his footstool; my mouth is his receptacle for any
possibility of things, my tongue has served the nastiest of needs.� 

&nbsp;

After
he rolls off me, and before he can push me off the bed, I get down to make sure
he has all the necessary accoutrements to smoke a cigarette.� He chuckles and makes his usual joke about
good training.� I wait on the floor for
his daily instructions.� Besides the
mundane housework, Nick always gives me some odd errands to run.� But today...

&nbsp;

&quot;Mara,
I have a surprise for you today.&quot;

&nbsp;

A
surprise- happy for him, probably unhappy for me.� I wait in numb dread, but he would keep me in apprehensive
suspense till the time came.� He says no
more about it.�

Hello everybody, i hope you
enjoy the story- please let me know what you think!



&nbsp;

&quot;Mara,
I have a surprise for you today.&quot;

&nbsp;

A
surprise- happy for him, probably unhappy for me.� I wait in numb dread, but he would keep me in apprehensive
suspense till the time came.� He says no
more about it.� 

&nbsp;


 
 
 
� 

&nbsp;

There was not much to be done today.� Nick has purposely not left any errands so
that I would simply stew in anxious wonder at what he would bring home
tonight.� 

&nbsp;

He has
even put a coded lock on all the television channels- a distraction he knew I
would seek.� I have read all the books
in the apartment.� 

&nbsp;

So I
sit at the windowsill to watch the world into which I venture only when
instructed or permitted.� I stare at my
left wrist, marveling at how invisible the tracking chip is inside my body, how
small, yet how big in my life.� 

&nbsp;


 
 
 
� 

&nbsp;

A few
weeks after Nick had told me the truth about his drugging me, there were some
days when I experienced mental clarity, during one of which I decided to get
the hell out of here.� I remember
thinking it should not be such a big challenge just to leave, even without
money and without the keys to my own car, which Nick had taken from me.� But I still had two healthy legs on which to
walk.� 

&nbsp;

I took
a shower and made myself look as nice as I could.� I went on a mad treasure hunt for any cash that could be lying
around, but found none, unfortunately.�
I was also worried about the cravings and then withdrawal symptoms I
knew would attack me once a day passed.�
I searched for the drug stash I thought might be here.� But I had no fiending to drive me since Nick
had just dosed me that morning.� I gave
up, not wanting to waste time on a fruitless pursuit- I knew the drugs must be
either locked up or with Nick at all times. 

&nbsp;

In the
phonebook, I had researched homeless shelters within a 20-mile radius, since I
had nowhere else to go.� If I had found
just a few dollars or some change, I might have been able to take a bus and get
much further away.� But that was not my
good circumstance.� So I would walk.

&nbsp;

I would
walk to the shelter furthest from Nick's town- it was 12 miles away.� Nothing in a car, but at least three hours
on foot.� I did not even know if I would
be able to walk that long.� And what would
I find at the shelter anyway?� I feared
disease-ridden criminals more sadistic than Nick.� I had heard nasty stories about shelters.� And I worried what I would do when I started
to need a fix.� I could imagine myself
begging any stranger for help.� But I
weakly resolved to stay strong when the withdrawal symptoms started.� I would just get through them and get over the
drug.� I knew that most drugs were not
truly physically addictive, so I would just have to suffer the effects of my
body trying to make it on its own for a few days.� I knew after that, I would be okay again.� That was my decision.

&nbsp;

As I walked, I let my life float slowly past me in chunks, big and
small.� Inside my head, I viewed images
of places I used to live and parties I had had with friends, remembering the
laughter and the warmth I had felt.�
Then I moved forward on the timeline, closer to now- how did I get
here?� How did I let myself continue to
make choices that would eventually lead me to imprisonment inside one of the
most luxurious apartments I�d ever seen?�
I live in a place of extraordinary conveniences- Nick�s elegant condo on
the seventeenth floor- but with no freedom.�
Very unlike the caged bird, I cannot find a way to sing.� 

&nbsp;

I
thought about my life with Nick from day one, musing on my na�vet� in trusting
the sincerity he had presented.� How all
the while he had sent me to gourmet cooking classes, Italian and French
classes, it had only been to upgrade the girl who would soon be his strung-out
slave.� I cooked for him now
everyday.� He threw Italian and French
into our conversations when it served him.�
Fond of degrading me in each language, he sometimes called me his foro
piccolo or tre-forata femmina, interchangeable in French with petit
trous or trois-trouee chienne.� But
the elegance of these foreign languages did not erase from my mind that I was
simply his �little hole� or �three-holed bitch�, in plain English.

&nbsp;

I had
planned my walk to the shelter so that I would still arrive many hours before
Nick would get home from work.� Although
he sometimes called me from work, today I thought it would not matter much
after all was said and done.� However
Nick was smarter than your average evil genius- or maybe I just had given away
too much subconsciously.� Maybe I had
been my own stool pigeon without even realizing it.� Somehow, Nick had known my plans.� I had taken with me all scraps of paper that could possibly be
incriminating.� But I suppose Nick too
knew there were not many routes of escape for me.� 

&nbsp;

Exhausted,
I finally walked through the doors of the Welcome Arms For All Shelter and
registered myself for the night.� A staff
member showed me around the place and assigned me to a spot in a huge room
filled with cots and noise from all the other homeless folk tonight.� I even made an appointment with a counselor
for seven that evening.� I thought
things looked positive.� 

&nbsp;

After a brief nap on the cot that had looked so
inviting despite its pitiful state of squalor, I began exploring the shelter
and surrounding area.� I met Shaley and
Coal, two seemingly nice enough characters.�
They shared the stories that had brought them to Welcome Arms; I told an
edited version of my truth.� We
continued talking until it was time for lunch- Shaley and Coal claimed the
shelter food was so sad they would not allow me to eat it.� But I had no money.� They offered to treat me to a meal at McDonald's-
Dollar Menu to the rescue!� What lured
me to accept their offer was not the temptation of that deliciously unhealthful
food.� It was that I knew I couldn't
make it if I remained completely alone.�
Besides, I really enjoyed their company.� I wanted to create and strengthen a bond between us.� I thought my experience with Nick should
have taught me otherwise- to lose trust in anyone who promised to have good
intentions.� But my human weakness for
the company of others and the need for allies made me vulnerable.� 

&nbsp;

Beautiful
Shaley was mothering and sweet, her strong arms wrapping around me frequently
in a warm gesture.� Almost waist-length
brown hair full of loose curls gave her an inviting femininity, one that I
could see Coal appreciated.� Shaley was
bubbly and full of laughter, making us forget that we were three floundering
souls navigating a maze of destitution.�
I could even ignore Coal�s dirty appearance of fingernails and hair
filled with things that did not belong there.�
Contrasting Shaley�s manner, Coal remained quiet throughout our
discussions of the things we missed doing, past relationships, and muted jokes
about the passersby.

&nbsp;

When
Coal offered me a cigarette- the perfect one, long and light, I almost
refused.� Although Nick smoked himself,
he did not allow me to engage in that activity; and I had to be partly
grateful, knowing the horrors cigarettes could bring upon my anatomy.� Coal�s offer momentarily entranced me in the
memory of how Nick broke my smoking habit, remembering the feel of the
cigarette�s burning head on my flesh.�
After that day, I would beg him not to smoke the many cigarettes he
would insistently offer me.� My mind
traveled backwards to the balcony that afternoon, where I had been relaxing
with a smoke, my eyes closed, my ears savoring the passionate voice of Fiona
Apple.� 

&nbsp;

____________________________��� ______________________________

&nbsp;

I had
not heard Nick open the sliding screen door.�
Suddenly, he was sitting in the chair across from me, staring at me and
the cigarette I held.� He had mentioned
to me once that he found smoking in a female very unattractive, but had not yet
forbidden me to do it.� Somehow,
however, I felt I should put it out... and yet, in a mood of rebellion, I
refused to follow that instinct.� For some
reason, perhaps because I still had not seen the depth of Nick�s mercilessness,
I challenged him, staring back into his striking, blue eyes.� 

&nbsp;

�Put it
out, Mara,� he said to me with quiet command.�
I hesitated, not wanting to kowtow to this man over and over, but
knowing I ultimately would, whether by choice or coercion.� How many more pieces of my will would I
carve out and offer to him?� At the very
least, I did not want to quit because I enjoyed my cigarettes, no matter how
damaging they were.� So with difficulty,
I ignored his words, part of me wanting to snivel and plead to be allowed to
continue smoking, part of me wanting to exhale directly in his face.� I did neither, choosing to simply take
another drag calmly.� 

&nbsp;

Carefully,
Nick changed the expression on his face from hushed anger to one of patronizing
cheer.� 

&nbsp;

�Alright,
my little foro, would you like to smoke?� Go ahead,� he smiled at me, pushing my pack closer to me.� 

&nbsp;

Of
course, this sudden, obviously artificial consenting attitude made me
worrisome.� But I felt trapped:� either putting out the cigarette now or
continuing to smoke would be some form of punishable behavior.� He had broken my challenging stance, making
it worthless and trivial; he had made laughable the strength and courage I had
summoned to defy him.� Like an audience
of sports fans engaged in a critical play, he watched me.� Uncomfortable smoking under his trenchant
gaze, I began squirming in my seat, wanting more and more just to squash the
butt in the ashtray.� Finally, there was
no more tobacco to burn, and as I brought the filter down to crush it, Nick
stopped me. 

&nbsp;

�Wait.� Did you enjoy your cigarette, Mara?�� Rhetorical as it sounded, the question, I
knew, was meant to incite an actual response from me- of what the correct
answer was, I did not have an idea.�
With hesitance, I answered positively that I had indeed enjoyed
myself.� Nick seemed pleased, pulling
his chair closer to mine so he could caress my cheeks in false tenderness.� Fearfully, I recoiled from him like a
startled lizard retreating into an open crevice.

&nbsp;

�I�m
glad that cigarette was good for you, my darling.� Since you take such pleasure in smoking, I will not tell you to
stop again.� There will just be one
condition.�� His tolerant words and kind
manner were causing me to panic internally, knowing that something terrible
would be coming.� I just could not
conjecture what it would be.

&nbsp;

His
face centimeters before mine, one of his hands roaming towards my neck, he said
in a voice almost whispered, �Open your mouth, Mara.�� Beginning to wrap around my throat, like a thug backing up a
wiseguy, Nick�s hand tightened just enough to make me gasp and obediently open
my mouth.� I could see the satisfaction
in his eyes at the alarm my face surely showed. 

&nbsp;

�Now,
Mara,� he continued, still quietly, �Stick out your tongue.�� 

&nbsp;

Fear
guiding me, controlling me, smacking me back down into submissive compliance, I
did as Nick ordered.� He looked at me
and laughed- one short, condescending laugh that crushed my self-esteem as if
it were the first time.� Always as bad
as the first time, every time I caved in to him made me cringe inwardly.� Tears welled in my eyes- at being unable to
breathe, at the pain of his fingernails digging into my tongue, pulling it out
further than it would go naturally, and at what I knew he would do next.� 

&nbsp;

All
laughter gone from his eyes and voice, menace and anger returned, Nick told me
once more to put the cigarette out.� As
I sobbed, he continued to choke me placidly but painfully, my tongue feeling
ripped out from the base.� Knowing mercy
was not an option, in shaking hands I slowly brought the burning butt towards
my mouth.� Whimpering loudly now, trying
to brace myself for the pain I knew would be unendurable, I heard the hiss of
fire going out on my wet tongue as I followed this man�s sadistic order.� 

&nbsp;


 
 
 
� 

&nbsp;

When
Coal said my name, I came out of the memory with the taste of ash on my
tongue.� I looked down at the cigarette he
held out to me.� Despite my flashback, I
still wanted to smoke now, to inhale toxic fumes deep into my lungs, so I
accepted what Coal offered.� I relished
the feel of the smooth filter between my lips, the grinding sound of the
lighter�s flint wheel, the smell of the smoke, and the taste of that first drag
after so long.� Luxuriating in the
sensation of synthetic, unnatural air flowing into my body, I could not believe
how normal I felt smoking a cigarette with Shaley and Coal in the parking lot
of the McDonald�s.� I smiled to myself
as I extinguished the butt on the ground, crushing it to bits.

&nbsp;

Finally,
our conversation turned to recreational drug use.� I was fiending, but trying to hide it.� Shaley noticed, though, and commented.� She suggested we take care of my craving- I shouldn't be
suffering, she told me.� So warm and
comforting, her arm around me, her mouth close to my ear, she whispered
soothing words like a natural caretaker.�
In actuality, she was graphically describing the aches my body was suffering,
the distress that was heightening rapidly, the discomfort in my seat as I tried
to ignore the withdrawals.� She talked
to me just like Nick had the night I hugged the toilet, but in her own
malevolent style.

&nbsp;

&quot;Mara,
baby, we've got to get you something.�
Mamita, you're in bad shape- your bones and muscles are aching, your
head is hot, you have chills, your mind is everywhere and nowhere with anxiety
you can't stand.� You know you won't
last without getting what you need.� I
don't want to see you go through this when I can easily take care of you- such
good care of you, ma.� Come
on.&quot;� Her regionalism reminded me
of a friend I had had long ago, that Latin-tinged urban slang making me feel
cozy and open towards her.

&nbsp;

Thus
she convinced me by rubbing my face in my own misery, by pushing my brain into
the vivid description of my ugly need, she convinced me to follow her to a bus,
to a train, to a building I only belatedly recognized with deep fear.� In retrospect, I do not blame Shaley- she
was not leading me, she only provoked my shameless recidivism to lead me.� Only my own subverted will was responsible
for bringing me to that which is my bane and boon in one.

�

So as
we walked into the lobby of Nick's apartment building, I did not fight Shaley
and Coal- although they insisted on tightly holding one of my arms each.� As the number of floors to Nick decreased,
my two &quot;friends&quot; became increasingly forceful, beginning to grip me
more tightly.� Resignation squashed any
wonder at how Nick had planned with them my recapture.� 

&nbsp;

But
resignation would not be enough to protect me from whatever punishment Nick
would dole out- my fear burst from me and I used all my strength to attempt to
wrestle free from Shaley and Coal.� I
cried and screamed and kicked and tried all the usual means of escape people
used in the movies and books.� But of
course Shaley and Coal easily predicted my behavior, suddenly tying my wrists
together behind my back with a piece of dirty cloth pulled from Coal�s pocket.

&nbsp;

Nick's
door opened and there he stood, the Cheshire cat himself.� My heart, already racing, accelerated to an
even higher pace.� Shaley and Coal gave
me no time to live in the moment, pushing me into the apartment as Nick stepped
aside to let us enter. 

&nbsp;

One
hand of each of my traitorous captors pressed down on each of my shoulders,
forcing me to kneel in front of the man who would own me- the man who had
kidnapped me from myself.� He sat in his
armchair calmly.� I wondered with
perverted interest why he was holding his monogrammed keychain with a pair of
fine pliers in one hand and in the other a lighter.� A frightening scenario flashed through my mind- a picture of
another movie scene, one in which I should be Nicole Kidman and Sandra Bullock
should be here to save me- making me forget the aching and the fever of my
withdrawals and fear anew.� 

&nbsp;

Nick
began talking to me, quietly and caringly as he usually did, though his words
never matched the tone.� I noticed the
flame of the lighter touch the circular keychain as Nick talked.� I breathed hard and my heart pounded while
chills of hot and cold alternated routes through my body.� Anxiety kept me wired and unable to control
the wildly visible twitches of need for the drug on which Nick had hooked me.

&nbsp;

&quot;Oh,
Mara, dear, you tried to run away from me- how adorably adolescent of
you.�� He continued to heat the
keychain.� �Endearing, but severely
reprehensible, just the same, little girl.�
Now, Mara, you know I take such good care of you.� I always fulfill your needs like no one else
ever could.� Could you imagine, mia
femmina piccola, landing in the hands of someone who wouldn't know what you
need?� My sweet Mara, imagine- being all
alone out there, vulnerable to anyone with the worst of intentions.� Come on, little foro, let's take care
of this now.� Make sure that horrible
possibility could never exist.&quot;

&nbsp;

He
approached me, crouching down close to me, as if he would kiss me.� I could feel the heat of the metal next to
my face.� My face?� I wondered.�
I had no doubts anymore, nor any strange curiosity, about Nick�s choice
of punishment.� I tried to back away
from him.� I was getting close to
petrified now, my breathing becoming heavier and faster, practically a
pant.� He stared at my face and neck,
searching.� He put the lighter down to caress
me delicately, gently molesting my face, my hair, my eyes, my lips. He moved
his hand over my neck, down inside my shirt to squeeze my breasts
painfully.� I winced, wondering in
pounding dread where he would choose to stop.�


&nbsp;

He
played with me, &quot;Hmm.� Where is the
perfect spot?� There are so many classic
places.� Thigh, ass, belly, even
breast.� What do you think, Mara?�� With this, he waved the flame-hot key ring
past my eyes, which turned wide, to stop in front of my cheek.� Oh god, no, not the face.� 

&nbsp;

&quot;No,
not the face?&quot; he asked, mimicking my thoughts exactly with an awful
laugh.� He looked into my eyes then with
force that made me look away.� He toyed
with the heated key ring close to my face, as if he was going to do it.� I cringed back, involuntarily letting a plea
escape my lips.

&nbsp;

&quot;No,
not that obvious.� But...I think,
right... here.�� He pulled my pants down
to my knees roughly and pushed my legs apart.�
He rubbed the inside of my left leg, just at the meeting point of inner
thigh and crotch. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Perfect.�� He looked to Shaley and Coal, who then laid
me down on my back, my bound arms under me.�
Shaley held my shoulders pinned to the floor while Coal held one of my
thighs down and Nick worked on the other.

&nbsp;

Nick
picked up the keychain in the pliers and heated it again for a moment.� I was breathing hard and heavy, heart
beating with painful ferocity.� Tears
pooled in my eyes and I began whimpering, &quot;No, no, no,&quot; not bothering
to scream, knowing how useless it would be.�
Knowing my little efforts would only entertain Nick, but would not stop
him.��� 

&nbsp;

�Yes,
dear, right here.�� Nick�s voice was
quiet and tender just before he pressed the super hot metal into my flesh.� I screamed and cried and tried to bolt.� But I was held tightly until he finished.� I could not stop myself from bawling- not
just from the physical pain, but from the shame and hopelessness this act gave
me, depressing me beyond despair.� I was
now forever marked as the property of �NJN�.�
Nicholas James Northson was my owner and master, whether I ever spoke
those words or not.

&nbsp;

Now
Nick took my head onto his shoulder, soothing me, rubbing my hair, telling me
it was okay now, I could calm down.� I
did not want to be near him this way, but I was afraid to fight.� Conquered yet again, I did not attempt to
resist his comforts.� I did not bother
to tell him to stop his mind games with me.�
&quot;You just fucking branded me with your keychain.� Don't act like you care about me,� I
whispered unintelligibly to him, wondering if it would matter if he had
understood me.� Would he have slapped me
across the face? Or would he have just continued to touch my cheek
affectionately, with his heartlessly insincere expression of caring?� 

&nbsp;

&quot;Mara,
don't you see?� You have nothing, no one
but me.� Who else would want you?� Who else would take care of you like I
do?� Who else would protect you like I
do?� I do so much for you, sweet girl,
to keep you safe and give you shelter.&quot;�


&nbsp;

As he
sermonized, he continued caressing me.�
I let him put his arm around me, let him pat my head and rub my arm with
my face pressed against his chest.� All
the while, he brought his other hand in-between my legs, closer and closer to
the display of ownership he had put on me.�
His fingers dug into the wound.�
I gasped, but did not pull away.�
I let him keep hurting me, teasing the injury, all the while talking to
me about how he was shielding me from all the cruel people out there.� People who would never treat me as well as
he did.� 

&nbsp;

&quot;Now,
let's stand up and strip, Mara,� he said suddenly, extricating himself from the
embrace.

�

In a
daze, I obeyed with help from Shaley and Coal.�
Nick brought me to the mirror to view my new, marked self.� Now I had an external brand to match the
internal one Nick had already embossed on me, which was the real reason I could
not escape him.� He had already taken
possession of everything inside of me.�
Pressing me to the cold glass of the mirror, he stood behind me to wrap
his arms around me and spread my legs apart.�
I watched him in the mirror squeezing my thighs, rubbing the fresh wound
that he had strategically placed to cause me utmost pain.� My knees wanted to buckle from the stinging
agony, forcing me to lean into Nick for support to remain standing.

&nbsp;

&quot;Look,
Mara.� Now you can never be mistaken for
anyone else's.� You can stay with me
forever.� And I know you won't be a bad
girl again.� No, no, ma petite
chienne.�� He molested my body while
Shaley and Coal watched with drooling eyes.�
Suddenly I knew they would have a reward.

&nbsp;

Nick
began singing:

&nbsp;

Mara,
Mara, ran away.

But now
I�ve got her back to stay.

And how
much fun we�ll have today.

&nbsp;

Mara,
Mara, my dear joy,

Such a
pretty little toy-

Fun for
a girl and a boy!

&nbsp;

Then he
turned me around to face the hungrily waiting Shaley and Coal, who were ready
with a collar to throw around my neck with a leash attached.� I remember following all of Shaley�s
instructions and all the while, never getting over how enamored I had been with
her just hours before.� They pulled me
roughly into the bedroom and tied me into uncomfortably impossible positions,
using the bed�s footboard to assist.�
Thus, they were unencumbered by having to restrain me in any way- their
hands were free for all the cruelty their minds could conceive to apply to
me.� 

&nbsp;

As I
lay on my back, my legs bent double over my torso and spread apart with rope
from the footboard posts to my ankles, my head hanging upside-down partly over
the bed's edge, and my wrists still tied painfully under my back, Shaley and
Coal delightfully ravaged my body using anything from old-fashioned metal
spatulas to an egg-slicer.� My skin was
the palate, my welts the medium for their designer torture. Shaley's eyes
twinkled as she squeezed my breasts into an undersized strainer with widely
spaced openings, my flesh popping out through each tiny square.� When I closed my eyes in pain, Shaley
slapped me.

&nbsp;

&quot;No,
Mara, you watch what we do so you see how we smile every time you wince and
squirm to hold in the screams.� And I
want to see your eyes, mama- when they fill up with tears or when they open in
fear.� That's all part of the fun!� Silly!&quot;� Her tone suddenly became light and breezy, like we were going to
a party together.

&nbsp;

While
Shaley was exploring the most interesting ways to mark and hurt me, Coal was
conducting vaginal and anal discovery with the various instruments they had
brought into the room.� If he chose, he
could obscure himself from my view.�
Since he was silent about his work, I was left to guessing or Shaley's
occasional give-away outbursts to know exactly what Coal was using.� 

&nbsp;

First
it must have been simply handles to stirrers and ladles entering and retreating
repeatedly from both holes to which Coal had access.� Then a classic move:�
clothespins on the labia- the concept may have been trite, but the pain
was anything but dull.� At one moment,
Coal purposely brought a tool into my view that widened my eyes into circles of
horror.

&nbsp;

&quot;Now,
you keep on being a good girl like you're doing, and we'll keep this one
aside,&quot; Coal, finally speaking more than a single word at a time, winked
at me.� Shaley was on the side, working
my legs over with a handheld, plastic chopping board, so Coal was able to lay
the lemon reamer between my breasts as a reminder to cooperate.� The evil-looking device seemed to point
directly at me with a malicious will of its own. I nodded my head vigorously to
show I would, oh I would, comply.�
Nick's brand on my thigh was sweetness compared to the thought of what
Shaley and Coal might do now.

&nbsp;

After
no inch of my legs, belly, or breasts was left unmarked, Shaley brought out the
cheese grater.� I shivered each time as
she passed it over me from ankle to thigh to belly to nipple.� With difficulty, I restrained myself from
closing my eyes again- as I feared it would invite an introduction to the
wicked reamer still resting on my chest.�


&nbsp;

Shaley
put down her cheese grater to pick up one of the utensils Coal had earlier
thrust into me.� She brought it in front
of my face.

&nbsp;

&quot;Nasty,&quot;
she said with her nose crinkled in disgust at the residue of my bodily
secretions.� She shoved it into my
mouth.� I would have vomited if I didn't
have the vision of the lemon reamer imprinted into my brain at the moment.� I held back the bile that rose at the awful
taste.� In and out she pushed it until
she was satisfied it must be clean.� By
the time the sixth utensil was cleaned by own mouth, my taste buds had finally
been desensitized, thankfully.

&nbsp;

&quot;Well,
look at this, Mara- your legs are barely red anymore!&quot; she said, in a tone
to suggest I, too, would be disappointed by this news.� 

&nbsp;

&quot;Would
you like me to remedy that, honey?� I'm
sure you must.� I'd be happy to do you
that favor, ma- you just go on and ask me, and don't forget the magic word, Mara!&quot;� Her words, transparently guised as a
suggestion, were a command- disobedience of which I was sure would bring to
life the cruel tool lying on my chest.

&nbsp;

�Please,
Shaley,� I begged her tearfully, �Please...make my legs red again.� Please beat me with the chopping board and
the whisks and spatulas until I am covered in redness.�� I ended in sobs over the catch-22 she had
given me.� I knew if I did not please
her, if I did not plead enough for more abuse, the lemon reamer would awaken
and be plunged into my softest places.� 

&nbsp;

When I
had satisfied Shaley�s demand, she brought out new weapons from the kitchen-
all things, just like the lemon reamer, I had never even seen before I met
Nick.� Spice graters, lemon zesters,
dual peelers, roller dockers, ball whisks, flour dusters, flour wands, rolling
herb mincers- none of them were neglected in the parade of torment led across
my body.

&nbsp;

Shaley
began with locking tongs; lucky for her- Nick had two pairs!� Each helpless nipple was squeezed between
the tongs� sharp teeth.� Shaley moved
the tongs by the ends, my nipples suffering freshly with each twist and flip of
the utensil that was certainly not made with this intention.� I still remember Shaley�s jubilant giggles
each time I moaned in pain.

&nbsp;

Other
household items were not left out; after pinching the tongs closed more
tightly, Shaley pulled them off while squeezing them closed on my nipples.� Tightening small c-clamps on my nipples
next, Shaley used every item she had found in the kitchen to discover what red
patterns could be made upon my breasts, belly, and legs.� Only later did I discover that Shaley had a
method to her strikes- the mean names she had called me throughout the process
were advertised on my body in raised welts and scratches.� 

&nbsp;

As I
was almost passing out from the pain, wondering in the back of my mind about
the fix I still had not gotten, Coal exchanged a look with Shaley and they both
put down all their tools.� I finally saw
Coal�s cock, hard and ready, waiting in front of my body.� Shaley stood behind me, using my head to rub
her crotch.

&nbsp;

�I
think it�s time for a taste test,� Shaley said, looking down at me now, �Have
you ever licked a pussy, little bitch?� she asked me sweetly.

&nbsp;

Unable
to tell if the question was meant to be answered, I answered negatively with a
headshake.� Turning around to position
her open lips directly above my mouth, her ass on my chin, she crushed my ears
with her thighs, partially deafening me.�
She looked directly into my eyes, one hand pulling my hair, pushing my
face closer to her body.� Like Nick, her
most crass speech emerged as her sexual excitement became fervent.� She instructed me on exactly how, where, and
when to use my tongue- when to thrust it deep inside her, how to lick the
inside of her lips, and just where to flick my tongue-tip.� I tasted her saltiness, leaking into my
mouth as she gyrated over my face.�
Soon, it was not only her front hole that got use of my tongue, but
every part of her from clit to crack was rubbed all over my face, practically
suffocating me.

&nbsp;

All the
while, I had not realized Nick was in the room, watching.� Not until Shaley�s asshole was filled with
my tongue and my asshole was filled with Coal�s thankfully small penis did I
notice Nick�s eyes on us.� His gaze on
me substantiated what he had just done to me- it seared into me just like his
keychain had.� Somehow he had telepathic
powers over me- his eyes speaking inside my head:� You�re mine, Mara.�
Your body, your mind, everything.�
You�re mine.� The last two words
kept beating in my head, in time with the pounding of Shaley�s ass on my face
and Coal�s cock in my ass.� Just as Coal
spurted inside me and Shaley actually let a fart rip down my throat, Nick
walked over to us.� 

&nbsp;

Shaley
and Coal retreated outside of my vision, into my periphery, while Nick came
close to me.� In his hands, he held my
face, wet from Shaley�s juices, to look in my eyes.� My upside-down view of him disoriented my mind, which was already
in a confused state, from the chemical dependency wracking my body and the
ordeal I had just suffered.� 

&nbsp;

�Don�t
ever leave me again, foro,� Nick whispered to me, leaning in to kiss me
on the forehead.� The sweetness in his
voice made his words sound like a plea, a request of me.� In that moment of confusion, my thoughts
swirled inside my head like finger-painted clouds.� Nick�s tenderness seemed so true as he stared into my eyes,
looking desperate that I grant his wish- as if it were in my control at all.� As if I were not tied to his bed by rope
that dug into my ankles, as if I had not just been tortured in every way
possible at his command.� Yet, his eyes
were so soft that part of me could believe he actually cared about me.

&nbsp;


 
 
 
� 

&nbsp;

Later,
alone in the room, I pondered my situation as I watched the room darken,
listening to the music Nick had left playing for me.� I was hearing Poe sing about me, singing for me, it seemed,
proclaiming:

&nbsp;

I know
how to wear the costume, I know how to wear the mask.

I even
like the feel of having to ask.

I like
the sound of your whistle, I like the way you wear your grin.

I even
like the taste of my will caving in, and yet somehow:

I�m not
a junkie for your love, I am not a junkie, but later she again
confessed the truth:

This is
such a sweet collaboration, you got the power and I got the shame...

&nbsp;

Nick
had programmed just the right songs to speak to me while I waited for him.� He had chosen the music with lyrics that
would impress upon me my powerlessness under him, that would reaffirm that I
was under his thumb, hanging on his words, living on his breath, in his
room.� He would allow me no escape-
physical or mental- from his rule.� None
of my senses was neglected- each cascaded with stimuli to remind me that I
continued life only by his grace.� Still
fresh in my mouth and nose was the nauseating taste and smell of what had been
forced over my face; in my view was the world upside-down, symbolic of the
twisted world in which I lived with Nick.��
The music and lyrics continued to assault my ears and as my body
continued to throb in heat and pain, sore inside and out from Shaley and Coal�s
abuse, I cried silently to myself, alone in the dusky room.

&nbsp;
