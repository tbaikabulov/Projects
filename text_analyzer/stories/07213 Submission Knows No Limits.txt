&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; By

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Katey Caine&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

i am kneeling, completely naked, in the position that i am to assume with my Master. He has told me that i must always have my eyes downward, kneeling with my back straight and my hands behind my back. He has told me that i am not allowed to wear clothes in His presence, except in public, outside the confines of the house. Within these walls, the only thing i am ever to wear is my collar.&nbsp; i am NEVER to address Him by His Christian name, even in public. i do not have that privilege, and He has made it clear that the consequences of breaking this rule will be very dire. Whether we are sitting or standing, in the house or in the company of others, i must be physically lower than Him at all times. When we are out in public, i must always walk two paces behind Him with my head slightly lowered.

As stated in the contract i have just signed, i have signed over total ownership of my body, mind and soul. i remember His words as i read through the stipulations in the contract: ��.Once you sign it, there is no turning back. Do you understand that?�&nbsp; i belong totally to Him now. my Master walks across the room, while i continue to hold position. If i break position, i know i will be punished, as He has not told me to move. i continue to look downward, as i am not to look directly at Him unless otherwise instructed.

He finally speaks. �Kathryn, come here. Slowly, on your knees.�

i crawl over to Him. He is standing over me, and i can see in my peripheral vision, that He is fully dressed. �You need to learn your place, Kathryn, that you belong to me totally now.� He pushes my head down with His foot and commands me to properly show reverence.

i lower my head and kiss and lick His shoes. This fills me with a great joy, a complete feeling of belonging and peace. i am exactly where i should be. my Master suddenly lifts his foot under my chin, pushing my head up. 

�Look at me.� He commands. i look up and meet His eyes, which give nothing away. His expression is indiscernible.

�Do you understand your role, Kathryn? You are here to serve my needs and desires without question. You will do what I ask without hesitation.�

�Yes, Master, i understand�

He walks towards the table, pours a drink of brandy into a glass, and sits down. 

�Kathryn.� He signals with his hand to the place in front of His chair, under the table. i crawl to the area He has indicated. Again, he lifts his foot onto my shoulder, pushing me down. �Lower.� He instructs me. i remain in a kneeling position, with my head and torso pressed against the floor, hands behind my back. He places His feet on my back, using me as His footstool, reminding me that i am His property now. 

�Good. Good girl.� He says. �You are quick to learn your place. A slave who truly understands where she belongs.�

i feel His crop lightly stroking my back and thighs. He keeps this close at his side, to punish me should i move. i understand that i do not have the right to move at all, as i serve as His furniture.

After what seems like forever -&nbsp; Minutes? Hours? - my Master says to me: �How much do you trust me, Kathryn?�

i answer, �Completely, Master, with my very life.�

He reaches down, lifts my head and shoulders. �Look at me.� i meet his gaze. �Are you sure?�

�Yes, my Master, i am completely sure.� 

He touches my shoulder. �Stand up. Walk over there.� He signals to a column that supports the ceiling, in the middle of the room.

i walk over to the column. �Put your hands above your head!� He orders me. i put my hands above my head, leaving my entire body exposed.

i notice that He has a black silk scarf in His hand. He walks around me, inspecting my body. He reaches behind me, tying the black scarf around my head, over my eyes. i can feel Him tying my wrists to the wooden column, the harshness of the rope rubbing against my wrists, threatening to cut into me with the slightest movement. i feel so vulnerable and so afraid, unable to see, unable to move my arms. i can feel Him parting my legs slightly. i can feel His fingers brush past my sex, my warm wet folds. i am becoming wet for some reason, and my clitoris is throbbing, as i tremble, apprehensive. This entire time, He has not said anything to me.

He finally speaks: �You will give everything to me, every cell in your body. Is that understood?� 

�Yes.� i can feel my breathing quicken with my heart rate. i hear His footsteps; He is doing something on the other side of the room. i listen for any indication of what is happening.

His footsteps get closer now. Suddenly i can feel cold metal with a sharp edge, tracing the skin of my breasts and stomach. It is then that i realize what is happening.

�Kathryn, do you know what this is?� He speaks quietly now.

�Yes i do, Master�. i hear the tremor in my voice as i speak.

i feel the blade tracing along my throat, biting into my skin. i suddenly feel a sharp sting. i am visibly trembling by now, breathing very quickly. i hear myself moan in fear and pain. i feel warm liquid, my very essence, running down between my breasts, towards my stomach. 

He speaks quietly, tracing the blade across my skin, downwards now, towards my pubic area: �I want to remind you that your life belongs to me, which is what you have agreed.�&nbsp; i feel the sharp blade of the knife against my sex. i am terrified as i feel Him parting my lips. I feel the sharp point of the blade at my entrance. 

�If I penetrate you with this blade, Kathryn, do you realize what could happen? I think you know what will happen if you clench your muscles.�

�Yes.� i reply weakly. i am trembling uncontrollably, knowing that in my current position, my Master can do whatever he wants with me, that i have deeded my very being and existence to Him. That my life is His to take. i have signed myself over to Him, body and soul, but I wonder: Will He take my life, spill my essence, my gift, so recklessly? my total submission to Him wrestles with my innate will to survive.

i now feel the edge of the blade being drawn across the inside of my left thigh, the pain biting into my flesh, making my cry out. i can feel warm wet blood trickling down my leg towards my ankle. i am aware of the tears running down my face, of pain and fear, ashamed that i am so afraid, when i know that i need to trust completely, otherwise i should not be here, in this room. i am also aware of the hunger inside me that is growing, the deep hunger inside my body. my warm wet folds must be glistening with my juices.

Again i feel the point of the blade pressing against my clitoris. i can feel my thighs parting involuntarily, as my Master brings the tip of the blade once again to the entrance of my very being. i gasp as i feel the tip of the blade entering my body, my being. His fingers stroke my swollen clitoris. i am crying in terror now, every cell in my body aching with desire and craving.

�Please�.no�.� i am pleading. my Master holds my throat with His other hand, feeling my pulse, my survival instinct, strong and rapid underneath the pressure of his fingers. 

He finally withdraws the blade. my legs feel as though they are about to give out, shaking, i can barely stay on my feet. i can barely breathe, and i can feel the thin line of blood from my throat trailing down to my wet, quivering opening.

my Master slides a finger inside my hot, pulsing passage. �You need to be stretched, Kathryn. You will need to be able to take my fist and various other objects. There are so many other ways in which I am going to use you.�

i hear a groan escaping me, as the sensation of my Master&#8217;s finger inside me is bringing me closer to the edge. i move my pelvis forward, to try and take more. �Please, may I have more�?� i am begging. my entire body is screaming to be filled, yet i am genuinely terrified that i may be made to take more than i physically can.

As if sensing my nearing climax, my Master withdraws his finger from inside me. i suddenly feel His hands around my throat, squeezing tight. �You do not EVER come until I tell you to! Your body belongs to me, and you release only when I grant you release! Is that clear?�

�Y-yes.� i am gasping for air as His grip on my throat tightens. i feel light-headed, i am about to lose consciousness. i cannot speak; i cannot even beg for air, i cannot make a sound. My Master releases His grip around my throat. �Good. You will obey this command.�

�Yes, Master, i will.� i am breathing heavily now. My legs feel so heavy, they are about to give out, however i am tied in an upright position to this column, and my body is held up by my binds. My muscles are screaming, i am about to pass out from the agony.

Suddenly, i feel two fingers inside me, then three, then four, stretching me. �Open for me, Kathryn. Do it.� He says very slowly. Pain sears through me, my tight entrance resisting the invasion.

�i &#8211; i cant�.Please, i can&#8217;t!� The insides of my warm, wet entrance feel as though they are being split in two, my body is being ripped apart. Hot tears of pain and terror run down my cheeks, and i want to pass out from the pain of being torn open by His fingers..

�You can, and you will. Now!�

My Master forces his entire hand inside my warm wet folds. i feel His knuckles grinding against my pelvic bone. The pain is unbearable, i think i am being torn open from the inside out.&nbsp; i almost pass out from the agony of being forced open completely. i feel His fingers massaging my cervix, as He drives the rest of His hand into me. i am sobbing loudly now, crying out with pain and fear and intolerable ecstasy, I pray that i am not bleeding,&nbsp; as He opens and closes His fist inside me, stroking my inner muscles inside my wet, aching passage, taking me further and further towards beautiful release. i cry out, tears running down my face to my breasts and pubis, i am that close to the edge. i am on the edge of being conscious, pain and pleasure have no dividing line anymore, they are one. i am losing my mind in the sensations, losing all awareness of time, where i am and even who i am. There is nothing else, only His voice, the pain and exquisite pleasure.&nbsp; i move my pelvis forward, wanting to take more of His hand and wrist into my body.

He thrusts His hand in and out of me faster now, and more forcefully. As He does this, He says: � This is what I am going to do to prepare your back entrance.&nbsp; It is not just your sex that I am going to use, Kathryn. I think I would like to impale your back passage, see how much you could take, how far inside is too far. �

�Please, no, I&#8217;ll do anything you ask, Master, absolutely anything, please, I&#8217;m so afraid�� i am at breaking point, I can no longer form coherent thoughts, words no longer exist, only feeling. All the sensations &#8211; pain, fear, unbearable need, agonizing pleasure &#8211; are becoming too much.

�Kathryn, remember what you agreed to in the contract. You trust me with your life, remember?�

�Yes, Master, i trust you with my life,� i cry out. �Please, i can&#8217;t hold back�.�

�You are released. Come for me. Now!� As He commands me to finally let go with my climax, i feel His finger opening my cervix, entering my womb, my very being. my mind, my very conscious evaporates, dissolves completely in the indescribable wave that is my orgasm. i am floating in the white light behind my eyes.

The ecstasy comes in a wave over me, my muscles clenching around His fist inside me, my warm juices flooding His hand and my swollen, throbbing outer lips.

i think that i am screaming, then velvet blackness comes over me.




�������������������������������..


i open my eyes. my wrists are free, and the blindfold has been removed. My Master is carrying me across the room. 

He lays me down on the sofa on the other side of the room, underneath the window, near the fireplace. my legs feel very heavy. i start to drift into unconsciousness again.

i wake fully to my feel my Master stroking my forehead gently with His hand. He is sitting on the sofa, my head in His lap. i can feel something soft tracing the outline of my lips. It is the tip of His shaft. i take His cock into my mouth, my tongue circling the tip. i feel Him pushing further into my mouth, further down my throat. .My Master strokes my hair, He is speaking very softly: �Take it. Take it all. Do it now�� He holds my head firmly and thrusts deep into my throat, as if it were my tight, pulsing passage. i feel as though i am choking, i can&#8217;t breathe. i am gagging, gasping for air. He starts to pump harder, faster. i feel that i am close to passing out again, then i feel His grip on my hair tighten. and His shaft pulsing half way down my throat, and i taste the salty bitterness of His seed exploding into my mouth. i hear a deep moan from Him as He releases His essence down my throat and into my body. i swallow His beautiful juices, taking them into myself, as i have learned to appreciate this as a gift from Him, that it is an honor that i may give Him pleasure with my body in this manner.

After some time, He commands me to look at him directly. From my position in His lap, i meet His eyes. He orders me to kneel in the position that He has trained me to assume in His presence at all times. This time, He orders me to look at him as He addresses me.

Once again, His cold, piercing blue eyes betray nothing of what He feels. He holds my gaze.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

�Kathryn, tonight I am going to mark you with a temporary mark of my ownership. When the period of time stipulated in the contract has ended, it is then where you may decide if you wish to leave here with your freedom; or if you wish to continue as my slave. If you wish to continue as my slave, you shall be permanently marked as my property. In this contract, however, you have agreed that you belong to me totally, that you give everything to me, for the period stated. Yes?�

�Yes Master, I give you everything i am.�

�As I have total ownership of your body mind and spirit, Kathryn, and you understand this, I shall rename you for the duration of the contract, thus reinforcing the extent of my ownership, of even your identity.�

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 �Yes, Master, i understand this.�

�Good. I shall call you slave cara, and that is how you will refer to yourself to anyone I introduce you to, that is the name you will answer to for the duration of the contract. Is that understood?�

�Yes, Master, it is understood.�

i am now slave cara, property of Master Charles.

i wonder how i will be marked &#8211; will it be a piercing or perhaps a symbol or His initial cut into my flesh? For it to be temporary, if He were to carve my skin, the cut could not be too deep.&nbsp; A brand would also be too permanent.

As He leaves the room, i am left wondering how i will be marked. Pleasant anticipation begins to fill me, yet apprehension slowly crawls upward, over my skin, making me shiver with dread as to what I am about to endure.

After what seems to be an agonizing wait for an eternity, my Master returns. In my peripheral vision, i can see the glint of metal. He is holding what appears to be a blade similar to a scalpel, in His right hand. my mind is racing: what is He going to do? Where is He going to cut me? How deeply? my thoughts are traveling in a&nbsp; thousand different directions. i am trembling all over as i feel Him forcing me onto my stomach,&nbsp; my wrists and ankles are being bound together, and i can feel my thighs being strapped together, with thick leather straps which further immobilize me.&nbsp; i feel so completely vulnerable, every inch of my nakedness is exposed.

Searing pain shoots through my right buttock, as i feel the blade slicing through my delicate, sensitive flesh. Even though it is probably quite shallow, it still feels as though the blade is deep inside me, cutting through my insides.

The intense pain is so extreme, i barely notice that He has at last finished. i cry out as i feel His finger tracing the pronounced initials �C.H.�&nbsp; that He has carved into my backside, the open flesh stinging to the touch.&nbsp; 

�Now, everyone will know to whom you belong, once they see this�. My Master speaks slowly, as He strokes my throbbing buttock.&nbsp; An incredible feeling of joy and belonging washes over me. i have never felt as truly loved and understood as i do in this moment.

i feel Him loosening the leather straps that are keeping my body taut, held in a hog-tie. i feel the binds attaching my wrists to my ankles being released, and i slowly straighten my stiff, aching legs. 

�On your knees. Properly�. my Master orders.

Every stretch, every slight movement is agony, and my right buttock feels on fire as i raise my body onto all fours, and into the prescribed kneeling position.&nbsp; my thigh muscles are screaming, and i cry out involuntarily.

�I didn&#8217;t tell you that you could make a sound!� He grabs my hair and pulls firmly. i don&#8217;t dare make a sound, as i know that i will be punished. i feel so privileged, so complete and fulfilled to be here for His pleasure and to serve Him, and will only speak when addressed or given permission.

i am very careful to keep my head lowered and my eyes downward, as i have learned during my training. 

i feel Him bending down and attaching something to my collar. It is a thick black leather lead, i can see it out of the corner of my eye. i suddenly realize that it&nbsp; has been in His pocket for some time. He has never had me on a lead before &#8211; He once attached four heavy, cold chains to the ring of my collar: two were attached to shackles around my wrists; and two were attached to clamps on my nipples, that tightened a little more every time i would try to raise my head. i vividly recall the almost intolerable agony as He had raised my arms, attaching the shackles to even larger chains affixed to the wall of His room, where He had left me for an hour. i recall the hot, stinging tears of pain on my face,&nbsp; the&nbsp; ever-increasing warmth and wetness between my legs; and the depth of my love for Him that i felt in that hour, His gift to me is this deep feeling of peace, wholeness and serenity through the opportunity to serve.

my Master pulls gently on the lead. �Come here, cara, on all fours. And DO NOT SPEAK.� i comply as He leads me back into the dining area where i have previously been His footstool. He suddenly stops next to His chair where He drinks brandy as part of His nightly after dinner ritual. Exactly ten minutes past nine every evening, after He has finished dinner, and i have cleaned the kitchen and washed the dishes, i bring Him His special crystal glass of brandy.

�Stay here, and do NOT move until I tell you that you can.� He commands me sharply. i can hear Him opening cupboards and a drawer. i experience a mixture of excitement and apprehension as i can only wonder what He has planned.

i hear the sound of a cork popping and liquid filling a glass or some sort. my Master then turns and walks towards me, and places a small bowl in front of me on the floor by His chair.

� I told you I would introduce you to fine quality wine - wine you ARE NOT permitted to dilute with lemonade. �. He chuckles and takes hold of the lead. i now can hear Him removing something from the countertop.&nbsp; He walks over to me once again, bends down and grabs my wrists, placing my hands behind my back. i feel cold metal around my wrists and hear a click as a lock snaps shut. my hands are cuffed behind my back.


my Master holds my collar firmly and pushes my head down towards the bowl on the floor, and orders me to drink from the bowl. It is so difficult, keeping my balance with my arms cuffed behind my back. i have to use my already aching thigh muscles to steady myself so i do not fall forward. The wine tastes so sweet, not at all acidic like the cheaper supermarket wines i am used to. It is like&nbsp; nothing i have ever tasted before, and i start to drink it more eagerly, causing some of the wine to spill onto the floor either side of the bowl. i instantly chastise myself for being careless.

my Master bends down and lifts my head slightly, while with His other hand, He moves the bowl to one side.

�Your impatience and over-enthusiasm caused you to spill some. Clean it up. Now!�

i lick the spilled wine off the floor very slowly. and carefully so that i don&#8217;t leave any behind and let it go to waste. One of the things i am still yet to fully learn is patience. 
i have always had a tendency to be over-eager or over enthusiastic, not always taking care in things i do, and certainly finding waiting difficult. These are things that often prove detrimental to me, behaviors that my Master has been progressively breaking me of. i also have a tendency to worry unnecessarily over my Master&#8217;s reaction to my immeasurable joy in serving Him, the infinite profound happiness that being His slave brings me, and the depth of my total devotion to Him. This would always cause me to doubt myself in the beginning. I can remember that exact moment when i had realised with absolute clarity, after believing for many years that i was simply your ordinary garden-variety submissive, that i am in fact truly a slave with an innate craving that comes from deep within my soul, to serve and please a Master.

There have been times since then that i have been absolutely fearful of rejection, almost bracing myself for Him to be disappointed or scared off by the depth of my love for Him and my commitment to being His slave indefinitely.&nbsp; i would internalize those feelings, often suffering needlessly for days before communicating my uncertainty.&nbsp; The last time i jumped to conclusions and made myself miserable for hours internalizing, He poured some uncooked rice on the floor and made me kneel naked, on the rice, ten minutes for every minute that i had been unnecessarily anxious. my knees were marked and sore for days after that and i could barely stand for the first day, however i understood that this punishment would ultimately benefit me, that my Master would never want me to be tearing myself up inside, feeling so unhappy, uncertain and doubting myself.&nbsp; i know without question that He only wants me to be the best that i can be.


Now that the floor where the wine was spilt is completely clean and dry, my Master places the bowl back in front of me. This time i lap up the wine slowly and reverently, appreciating every drop that He has given me until i finish all of it. i feel warm inside, content and certainly lighter. my face feels warm and flushed with rosy colour. i feel my Master bending down to kiss the top of my head, which is still bowed to the floor. He runs His fingers down my back towards His initials that He carved earlier. 

�You mean everything to me.� He says softly. The sensation is wonderful and comforting now, His gentle touch on my pleasantly sensitive skin.&nbsp; 

He removes the empty bowl from the floor, and walks to the countertop where i hear Him placing it in the sink. i look up instinctively, awaiting His order to wash the bowl immediately, as this is part of my role. It is only after it is too late that I realize what i have just done. In my eagerness to serve in my capacity as a domestic slave, i have broken one of the fundamental rules without thinking. i meet my Master&#8217;s gaze for a split second, and avert my eyes immediately, realizing my grave error.

i do not dare move at all as i hear my Master&#8217;s purposeful footsteps as He walks to the other end of the dining room. i am frozen with fear as to what the consequences will be for this violation. i have never broken this rule until now. Not even during my preliminary training.

i hear His footsteps approaching me, and every part of me is trembling. i feel so saddened and lost, and i understand in this very moment that the accounts from other slaves are truer than i have ever realized &#8211; there truly is no greater pain and suffering that i
feel, than when my Master is not pleased with me. i feel as if my heart is breaking &#8211; i can only hope that He will provide to me the guidance i will need to be put back on track so that i will be forgiven and once again be allowed His eyes upon my flesh, His touch upon my soul, and His warmth and love upon my heart.

His footsteps stop very close to me, and i can feel him pulling me to my feet. i almost lose my balance, as my wrists are still cuffed behind my back. He says in a completely neutral tone: �cara, walk over to the wall quickly�. my legs are quite numb from kneeling low to the ground for this length of time, and i steadily put one foot in front of the other.

�I said do it quickly. Now!�

i am trying to walk quicker now. i am finally so close to the wall that the tip of my nose is touching it, and i can smell that it has been recently painted. my Master unlocks and&nbsp; removes the cuffs at last, and firmly rubs my arms, which are stiff and aching from being held in place for so long.

�Hands on the wall, and legs spread. Now!� He commands. I raise my still-uncomfortable arms, reaching upward, placing my hands on the wall. i spread my legs about six inches apart. Out of the corner of my eye, i can see Him pick something up off the side table. It is His crop. my heart starts to beat loudly, and i can feel beads of sweat starting to form between my breasts. He has never cropped me before, not properly. He once tapped my butt lightly with His crop when i moved while i was taking His seed into my mouth, to remind me that i am here to please Him, and i only move if He tells me to.

He orders me to bend over slightly, so that my behind is sticking out. He strokes the inside of my thighs with the crop, and this makes my skin tingle and my back arch with the pleasure of this light touch. 

�Did I tell you to look at me?� He asks.

�No.� i answer almost whispering, my voice faltering.

�I said, DID I TELL YOU TO LOOK AT ME?! You will answer properly!�

i am breathing quickly and audibly now. i try to answer clearly, steadying my voice.







�No, Master, You did not tell me to look at you.�

The first strike is so sudden, the sharp pain searing like a lightning bolt across my buttocks. Tears sting my eyes and i cry out in pain and shock. Then the second, across the backs of my thighs, feels like a knife slicing through my skin. i scream in agony, just as the end of the crop strikes my thighs again, this time catching the inside of my thigh where He had cut me much earlier. i can feel that it is starting to bleed again,&nbsp; a thin trail of warm liquid running slowly down my leg. my legs feel as though they are about to give out, all my muscles are taut and screaming, starting to shake uncontrollably. i am surprised to feel a pleasant throbbing warmth and creamy juices between my legs.

The crop stings across my lower back, and again across my buttocks, grazing the initials carved on my right butt cheek, it now feels on fire once again. i can&#8217;t take any more. I feel my legs finally giving out and i collapse, sobbing, on the floor against the wall. my backside and thighs feel raw and torn open, and i understand why i have been punished this severely &#8211; i must learn to always show respect and reverence at all times, no excuses, no equivocations; and this is an important part of my journey of self-discovery, my journey towards being the best slave that i can be for Him; and of our journey together. 

i feel Him bending down, taking me in His arms, holding me close to Him.&nbsp; i feel Him wiping the tears and perspiration from my face. i feel Him gently kiss the top of my head, stroking my hair. i am still crying, tears of pain and despair that i broke one of the principal rules i am trained to adhere to, and that Master Charles is disappointed in me. i feel as though my heart is breaking, that He is displeased with me, although He is still holding me very close. He lifts my head with His hand so that my eyes are level with His.

�Now, do you understand why you were punished?� He asks me softly. i silently nod. \

�Answer me now.� He commands, His voice slightly raised.

�Yes Master, i understand.�

He tenderly strokes the side of my face with His index finger. His eyes display a certain severity tinged with warmth and caring. He stands up now, directly in front of me while i remain at His feet.

 �Look at me.� i look up at Him from my place on the floor against the wall. I feel so safe and protected in His presence. His expression remains indecipherable. �And what have you learned from this, slave cara?�

�Master, i have learned that i must always be mindful of my place no matter where i am or what i am doing, and that i must show respect, reverence and humility in Your presence at all times. It is a privilege to be allowed to look at you, and i will never&nbsp; lose focus and take that for granted again.� i can feel tears stinging my eyes once again, they are running down my cheeks in warm, salty trails. �i am so truly sorry Master, please find it in Your heart to forgive me, i will always be mindful of my place in future and not be presumptuous. i promise i will never do that again.�&nbsp; I lower my head and shoulders so that my forehead is against the top of His shoes, and i begin to sob uncontrollably again, begging His forgiveness at His feet. The fact that He is disappointed and displeased with me is truly devastating to me. i feel so lost and empty at this moment. The fear that He may never forgive my oversight, and may lose faith in me, is so overwhelming that i feel physical agony in my chest.


�Good. You&#8217;re a good girl. You&#8217;ve come so far with your training, I&#8217;m very happy with you.� My Master speaks so softly, as He bends down and strokes my face, wiping the tears from my eyes. i can feel Him lifting me, carrying me into another room. my tears have blurred my vision; i can&#8217;t see where He is taking me.&nbsp; i am crying with relief and gratitude this time, thankful that He has forgiven me this grave mistake, and that i am still useful to Him, that He would continue to allow me to serve and please Him.

i realize that He has taken me into His bedroom, when i feel Him laying me down on His black cotton duvet cover. 

�Lie on your stomach� He says gently. i obey, rolling over onto my belly. The marks on my back and the cuts on my buttock and inner thigh feel raw and moving is very painful. i cry out softly in pain as i feel them scrape against the cotton.

i can hear my Master opening a drawer beside His bed. i guess that it must be the drawer in which He keeps the keys to my chains, when He chains me to the foot of His bed on nights that He doesn&#8217;t keep me in His closet. i hear Him opening a small jar of some sort, and then placing it on the nightstand. i feel Him rubbing something very cool, lightly perfumed and soothing onto the areas where He cropped me earlier, it feels as though it is a type of balm. He puts some of this onto my right butt cheek where He has carved His initials into my soft flesh. i moan as i feel the balm being rubbed into the areas of open skin, where i had bled while i was being punished. The burning, stinging sensation goes so quickly with the comforting touch of His hand. He brushes His hands in between my thighs, spreading them wider. 

i hear Him reach over once again to the small jar of soothing balm. Suddenly, there is a cold sensation at my back entrance. i feel my Master massaging my opening gently with one finger. It is so sensitive, i feel as though the nerve endings there are directly connected to my now-throbbing clitoris and labia. i can hear my breath catching, as my arousal deepens, and as if sensing that my sex has become slick with juices, He moves his fingers downward to my hot dripping soft flesh between my thighs, spreading the hot creamy liquid around the entrance to my butt. 

i sigh loudly as i feel Him enter my tight, pink virgin hole with a finger. The entrance is so tight and unused that my muscles resist the penetration. �Open,� my Master commands in a soft, low voice. He inserts another finger, then another, moving them around inside of me, deeper and deeper. That part of my body isn&#8217;t used to being stretched in this way, my muscles are screaming, my clitoris is aching with need, and i hear myself cry out in pain. He suddenly withdraws His fingers. i hear the sound of His belt buckle being undone, and it is in this moment that i realize why i have just been stretched, what my asshole has been prepared for.

i feel so filled with absolute joy that He has forgiven me for my earlier infraction and that He is allowing me to serve Him, but at the same time, i am gripped with fear now that I understand that He intends to use my back entrance for His pleasure &#8211; this is the first time that He will have used me in this way, and i am so afraid of how painful it will be, whether i will bleed, whether my small passage will be split and torn by His width.

i can feel the head of His shaft lightly stroking the entrance to my back passage. i think He has covered it in the balm He used earlier to soothe my wounds from the cropping. i scream as He thrusts all the way inside, my tiny asshole feels raw, split open as my body struggles to accommodate the width of His cock. �Please�no�i&#8217;m not ready yet�please�� i beg Him to be gentle.

 i can feel my inner passage beginning to relax as He quickens His pace, thrusting in and out of my tingling, pulsing ass, the strokes becoming more forceful. The excruciating pain gives way now to a warm, pleasurable throbbing deep inside me, and my hips are now grinding into the bed, seeking out relief for my excited, swollen clitoris. i can feel my ass muscles pulsing along with my dripping wet lips and aching pussy. 

His thrusts into my back entrance are so much faster and harder now, driving me further and further. i feel the familiar tightening in my pelvic area, and realize that i am going to come very soon &#8211; i am getting so close, it can&#8217;t stand it. But somehow, i remember what He has always stipulated about my coming: that i must always wait for His permission, no matter how unbearable it is. And for Him, i will endure the unendurable.

�Please�. let me come�..please�.please, i need it�..� i am begging, barely coherent, lost completely in the sensations that are shooting up from my back passage through my pelvis, to every cell in my body. Every nerve ending inside me is screaming for release, as His shaft rams even harder and deeper inside me, opening me up even further. 

�No! Did I fucking say you could come? Don&#8217;t do it!� He says sharply.

�No, Master, You didn&#8217;t say i could come, i promise i won&#8217;t until You tell me�. Please, i&#8217;m so close, so close��� i see Him reaching for something near His pillow, out of the corner of my eye. i hear the familiar, low buzzing sound and realize what He intends for me. i feel Him reach down underneath my filled asshole, and insert the vibrator into my dripping, hot, swollen sex, while He continues to pound into me, more and more vigorously.

All conscious, coherent thought falls away now. i feel my mind dissolving in the feeling that is washing over me, taking me over the edge of the precipice, where there is no thought, only feeling. i can hear myself whimpering, moaning, pleading, and screaming now. New tears of beautiful agony form in my eyes, running down my cheeks, as He reaches down and thrusts the vibrator in and out of my warm wet folds, my juices soaking the duvet cover between my legs. Everything around me disappears, there is only Him, and the intense ache as my body is struggling to pull back from the abyss. i am now shaking uncontrollably - screaming, crying, pleading for mercy, begging for release, declaring my love for Him over and over again, imploring Him to keep me as His slave and allow me to serve Him for the rest of my life. 

�Now you can come.� His voice is all there is, nothing else exists, as i am filled completely, made whole by the feeling of ecstasy that drowns me as i sink into the feeling of light that is my climax. i feel His body tensing around me, and glorious, thick, hot liquid fills my back passage, as i take His seed into my body. my juices flood my outer lips, flowing over the vibrator, all over His fingers and His bed.

i am vaguely aware of my Master&#8217;s arms around me, and the fact that He is still inside my back entrance, as i slowly surface into semi-consciousness. i open my eyes, and find that i am lying on my right side, in the spooning position.

i feel Him stir beside me; He gently kisses the back of my head and my neck. He pulls away and withdraws from my back entrance. i hear Him get up and pull His pants on. i can hear the jingle of His belt buckle as He walks slowly over to the side of His bed where i am lying.&nbsp; He strokes my forehead and tells me that i have been asleep for two hours. 

�It is seven thirty.�&nbsp; He says. Seven thirty. The words barely register through the post-orgasm haze of fuzzy bliss, and absolute joy that i feel simply being in His presence.

Seven thirty. Time for me to clear and wipe down the dining table, to prepare dinner, and wash the bowl from earlier today. i sit up very carefully, as my arms are still very sore from when my hands were cuffed behind my back for so long.

�First you are going to clean my cock and the vibrator. With your tongue.� my Master holds His shaft in front of my face. �On your knees. Now!� i shift my body into position as He stands above me.

i hold His beautiful cock in both hands, and lower my head. i lick slowly and respectfully, taking care in my eagerness and profound love of serving Him, to clean up every last trace of His semen. i suck gently on His balls now, running my tongue around them, removing all my juices that have gushed from me earlier.

�Raise your head!� He orders me. When i do, He is holding the pastel lilac vibrator which is soaked in my thick creamy juices. He puts it close to my lips. �Clean it�. i caress the tip of the vibrator with my tongue, and then i move down the shaft, licking up all the juices. i feel Him running His fingers through my hair. Suddenly, He grabs my hair firmly, jerking my head upward. As i gasp, He pushes the vibrator deep into my mouth, halfway down my throat. My throat isn&#8217;t ready; I haven&#8217;t had time to relax my muscles, so i feel myself gagging. i feel as though i am choking, i start breathing very rapidly through my nose. i can feel my heart rate increasing as my throat is still resisting.

�Breathe slowly. You&#8217;ll black out if you over breathe�, my Master says, His voice slightly raised. my throat is still spasming, i can&#8217;t control my breathing, it is still too rapid. �Slowly!� He commands. He now starts thrusting the vibrator in and out of my throat as though it is His hard shaft. i am trying to breathe slowly and steadily, and to relax, but i have always found �deep-throating� exceedingly difficult due to my strong gag reflex. i am grasping the plastic vibrator with my lips, stroking the sides with my tongue, 

He suddenly pulls it out of my throat and holds it up to inspect how effectively i have cleaned it.&nbsp; i am gasping, gulping in air as my throat muscles relax finally with relief that my airway is no longer obstructed.

�Good girl.� He brushes my hair from my face, and puts the vibrator in the drawer of the nightstand, where the soothing balm and the keys to my chains are kept.

�You have five minutes and five minutes only, to clean yourself up; then I want you in the dining area preparing for dinner tonight.�



As He leaves the bedroom, i walk slowly into the ensuite bathroom to wash my face and body, warm, flushed and greatly comforted in the knowledge that i am truly loved and cared for on a level that i never imagined existed; and the depth of love, devotion and respect that i feel for Master Charles is something that i have never felt before in my life and never expected to. By serving and pleasing Him as an expression of that love, i feel a freedom and joy that is beyond any words or language, a happiness that is without limits, and a feeling of confidence and safety that i have never believed possible, until now.
