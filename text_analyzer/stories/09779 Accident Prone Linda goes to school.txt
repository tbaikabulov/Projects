Chapter One 

Linda goes to her new school

Background � this is the first of a series about a very accident-prone young woman who constantly gets into trouble and punished for things that are not really her fault at all. The series traces her story from her schooldays into various misadventures in adult life. By my standards, it is a �light-hearted� story with only moderate levels of sex and violence. 

Synopsis:&nbsp; Linda Marshall goes to a new exclusive private school for girls. True to form, she gets into trouble constantly and has to be punished.

Linda goes to school

When Linda Marshall�s parents, who were not short of money, decided to send their young daughter to a new private school for girls. Linda had been in and out of trouble, never intentionally, for years and her parents, at their wits end, finally decided that boarding school was the only possible answer. 

Linda was dropped off one fine Saturday morning by her Linda and given a small suitcase with various clothes and other assorted bits and pieces in it. Then her Linda, who had more or less given up on her daughter, drove off and left her. She found herself in the tender custody of the headmistress, Miss Taylor.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Linda was extremely nervous about her first day at the new school. Until now she had gone to an ordinary state school with other boys and girls. Now she was in a private �academy� where her parents had paid for her to be �straightened out,� as they put it in their letter to the headmistress. Linda, of course, had no idea of what her parents had said about her in the letter, or even that they had sent one. She supposed that they had just filled in some kind of application form and that was that. She could not have been more wrong. 

On her very first day, Linda got herself into big trouble. As usual, it was not really her own fault. What happened was basically that she was out trying to make friends with the other girls and got various remarks made about her appearance by them, mainly centring around her slightly chubby figure. Even though she was taller than most girls of her own age, Linda loved her food and she had a figure that showed that. When they made fun of her, calling her names like �fatty� and �lard arse,� she mouthed back equally insulting words at her tormentors. The result was a full-scale fight, and, as usual, Linda�s luck was out. The headmistress caught her laying into another girl good and hard, and dragged her off with some difficulty. Inevitably, she found herself required to come to the headmistress� office.

�Really, Linda,� she began. �You�ve only just arrived here and already you�re brawling with other girls. I really think we shall have to sort you out before you become completely out of control. Do you have anything to say for yourself, girl?� �No, Miss Taylor,� she said weakly, knowing as children do that it was better to take punishment unjustly than to �snitch� on another girl. �Very well, Linda. You leave me with no alternative. Please follow me to the school hall. I will summon the other girls to join us straight away.� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Within 5 minutes the entire school had assembled. Some of the girls already knew what had happened, and the rest, from previous experience, made their own shrewd guesses. 
Whispering broke out among Linda�s tormentors but a frosty look from the headmistress promptly silenced them. Glaring at poor Linda harshly, she turned to the assembled pupils and addressed them directly.

�Well, girls, you all know that Linda disgraced herself today. Just because she is a new girl is no excuse for indiscipline and fighting. We aim to turn out young ladies at St Phillipa�s, not brawling she-cats. Since Linda has failed to live up to our standards on her very first day, she must be punished.�

Then Linda, still unsure what was about to happen, gazed in horror as Miss Taylor picked up a long and flexible piece of bamboo. She was still not quite certain what was going on but she somehow knew instinctively that yet again she was going to be sorry for what she had done.

�Well, Linda, it is time to begin teaching you your first lesson in discipline. Take off your clothes, Linda.� Linda stared at the headmistress in blank disbelief. �Take off my clothes, Miss Taylor? But why? I mean, I don�t know why you want me to do that.�

Miss Taylor sighed. It was clear to her already that Linda Marshall was more than ordinarily na�ve, as well as a girl with a genius for getting herself into trouble at the drop of a hat.

�My dear girl, in the first place, you NEVER, under ANY circumstances, even QUESTION a direct order from me, much less disobey it. There are other reasons which I could give you, but for now, especially since the question of instilling some kind of discipline in you is clearly a priority, that will suffice. Now stop standing there looking stupid and just take off your clothes, Linda.� 

Linda, was an attractive girl. She had a full-figured body and breasts that were much more highly developed than any other girl her age. The girls smiled cruelly among themselves as she began reluctantly to remove her clothes in front of the whole school. First of all her shoes came off, then her white socks, then her blouse, then her junior bra, and finally her knickers. Linda blushed as she saw the girls staring at her ginger pubic hair.

�All right, Linda, place your hands on top of your head and spread your legs as wide apart as possible.� 

That really made Linda go a brighter shade of red. Her face was now almost the same colour as her hair.

�OK, Linda, hold that position and let the girls get a good look at you. Maybe it�s time you learned the meaning of humility, obedience and discipline, the three cornerstones of the whole philosophy around which St Phillipa�s is built.�

Then Linda was ordered to bend over and touch her toes. The frightened girl did as she was told, realising with acute embarrassment that the girls now had a practically perfect view of everything she�d got.

�Now, then, Linda,� said Miss Taylor, �we will begin your punishment. You will of course be caned severely for your misbehaviour today. I expect you to count off each stroke as it is delivered and thank me after each one lands. Do you understand what I have just said, you stupid girl?� �Yes, Miss Taylor,� said a thoroughly miserable Linda.

Miss Taylor swished the cane theatrically through the air before beginning the serious task of punishing her errant student. She gave a stern look at the school before she continued.

�Let this be a lesson to you all, girls,� she said quietly. �If I have any trouble from any of you, you will receive the same punishment as the girl here is about to experience. I think, as this is your first offence, I shall give you just 6 strokes, but the slightest infraction on your part will of course result in the punishment it is necessary to give you being increased. Do you understand what I have just said to you, Linda?� �Yes, Miss Taylor,� the girl almost whispered. �Good. Well, it�s time to begin your punishment.�

Linda heard the swish of the cane as it whizzed through the air, landing right on her naked and vulnerable arse. She uttered a loud �ouch� and then remembered what she had been told. �One. Thank you, Miss Taylor.� And then Miss Taylor resumed her task, the cane swishing through the air relentlessly. With unerring accuracy it landed on the precise portion of Linda�s arse that the headmistress intended. 

By the third stroke angry red welts were beginning to form on Linda�s behind. Miss Taylor took no notice of their appearance at all. With every successive stroke, Linda screamed and tried to avoid moving. She did at least remember to keep counting and expressing her gratitude but after the fourth stroke she simply could not control herself. In spite of the fact that she knew she would regret it, Linda moved sharply away as the fifth stroke prepared its approach.

Miss Taylor looked at her coldly. Sighing, she motioned to two of the girls to come forward and secure her in position to a bench that stood in the corner of the stage area. Linda noticed that, with typical luck, it was the very same two girls who had provoked her into fighting in the first place. 

Linda found herself fastened to the bench with strong leather straps across her ankles, knees, waist and wrists and even around her neck. Miss Taylor glanced at the restraints in apparent approval and then decided they met her standards.

�I did warn you what would happen if you tried to move, didn�t I, Linda?� �Yes, Miss Taylor,� the dejected girl answered forlornly. �Very well then,� the headmistress told her. �As an additional punishment for your disobedience, you will receive an extra 6 strokes, making a total of 12 in all. Do you have anything to say to me, Linda?� �Sorry, Miss Taylor. It won�t happen again. Thank you, Miss Taylor.�

Then the headmistress went back to her work with renewed vigour. A desperate Linda somehow managed to count the remaining strokes and express her gratitude for each one, in spite of the fact that she was howling and sobbing her eyes out long before the punishment finished.

When the 12th and final stroke had been delivered, Miss Taylor released the girl from her bonds at last. She held the cane in front of the poor child and said to her sternly, �Now kiss the cane, Linda. And don�t forget to express your deep gratitude to me for punishing you for your disobedient and insolent ways.�

A crushed and still sobbing Linda did as she was told. All the girls in the school had huge grins on their faces. 

�As an additional punishment, you will be required to spend the rest of the day naked,� Miss Taylor told her. �You will also run any errands that I or any other pupil at the school require of you. Do you understand, Linda?� �Yes, Miss Taylor,� the poor girl somehow managed to answer.

For the rest of the day the girls found every possible excuse to make her fetch and carry things backwards and forwards for them, her nakedness on display the whole time. The girls were particularly excited because Linda was the first pupil to be caned at St Phillippa�s for around 6 months. In point of fact the last two victims were Melanie and Kim, the two girls with whom Linda fought.
At the end of the day, Linda had to go to Miss Taylor in her office. She looked at her disapprovingly.

�We have had a few trouble-makers at St Phillipa�s in our time,� she informed her, �but never before has a girl incurred punishment on her very first day at the school. Now get dressed and try to behave yourself in future.� �Yes, Miss Taylor,� a tearful Linda said. �Thank you, Miss Taylor.�

Linda slept only fitfully that night, still traumatised by the ordeal of what had happened to her that day. Kim and Melanie whispered among themselves that they had found �a right one� and that they would do everything possible to get her into trouble as often as possible. And for the next four years of her life at St Phillippa�s, Mel and Kim made sure that she got punished at least once a month, sometimes as often as once a week. Poor Linda�s schooldays were certainly not �the happiest days of her life!�
