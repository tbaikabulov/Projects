 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sheila did not even know she&#8217;d been unconscious until she awoke, disoriented and alone. Her first thoughts were of confusion. Why was she staring at the rough ceiling of a shed rather than her bedroom. As wakefulness asserted itself in her head, she began to realize more problems. She was indeed lying on a wooden floor of a shed of some kind. She was cold. The floor was cold. But four space heaters surrounded her, two on each side. They were all running high. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her clothes were gone. She was naked. There was nothing in the shed except herself and the four space heaters. A door and a window were set in one wall. It was daytime, but the daylight was muted.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She began to panic as she staggered to her feet. It couldn&#8217;t be real. Of course, it was. She knew that. She fought within herself to maintain control. She was a smart, successful businesswoman. There was no need to lose it. But as she looked out the window, it was very tough not to.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She saw only a field of white snow with distant trees. A wind was blowing the snow in fine wisps. Someone had taken her far from home. It didn&#8217;t even look like Massachusetts. It looked north.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Who are you!� she finally screamed, hoping they were listening or watching. She saw nothing on the walls or ceiling. It was just a shed, and even standing away from the space heaters was unpleasantly cold. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was something else, she realized. A humming. It was coming from beyond the back wall. It was where the electrical cords ran to. A generator, maybe. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Something else was still wrong. Her crotch hurt. She tried to lean down to look at it. She was sore. She realized with a chill that she&#8217;d been fucked. Someone had abused her, probably while she was unconscious. But had she been unconscious? Or could she just not remember?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What do you want?� she screamed again. And then she simply did not know what to do. She couldn&#8217;t guess what her options were. Hesitantly, she walked to the door, two steps, and pushed it open. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The wind caught the door and yanked it from her hands. She cried out as a blast of the coldest air she&#8217;d ever imagined hit her naked body. She screamed loud as she gingerly stepped out of the shed far enough to grab the door and pull it shut. The ground on her bare feet felt like a cluster of needles digging into her flesh. She retreated to the safety of the space heaters, starting to cry. She slumped down, seating her bare ass on the floor, her body heaving with sobs of despair. Who could have done this?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For a long time she just sat, crying without control. Then she realized it was getting dark outside. The sun was low on the horizon and sinking fast. She stared helplessly up to the window as the dim daylight became a dark night. Then the only light came from the space heater coils, a dim, sinister red glow that gave her no mental comfort even as it kept her body alive.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As she sat, not tired at all, she began to remember. She had been awake, at least for part of it. She remembered being carried. She&#8217;d already been naked. There were three of them. She couldn&#8217;t move. They wore masks over their heads. She was in the shed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sheila couldn&#8217;t help but curl up as she remembered the assault. She&#8217;d lain on the floor, her muscles paralyzed, as each of the three men mounted her and fucked her. It was not elaborate. They took their turns raping her and then left her on the floor between the space heaters. She&#8217;d been only semi-conscious then. Not enough to feel the right terror as the hypo came out and pressed into her arm.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The man with the hypo held up an envelope. �When you remember this, you&#8217;ll find the explanation attached to the generator out back,� he said. Then she had passed out again.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The envelope! It had to have answers, at least some answers. But now she didn&#8217;t dare go fetch it. There was no light outside, and it was even colder. As it was, she shivered with the four space heaters running. All she could do was wait.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The larger problem was her stomach. She hadn&#8217;t eaten in a while, and she was even thirstier than she was hungry. Food she could ignore. She prided herself on her dietary self-control. Water was different. Her throat was getting parched, and her tears had dried her out. Of course there was frozen water outside. As the hours ticked by, she grew more desperate to get it.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Finally, shaking in cold and fear of what she had to do, she got up and went to the door. There was snow outside, and heat to melt it inside. She just had to get it and bring it in. The wind, however, was even louder than before. Finally she pushed the door open. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It didn&#8217;t catch in the wind like before. If anything, the wind was pushing it shut. Crying out in pain from the icy cold, Sheila stepped out enough to lean down and collect snow in her bare hands. The wind caught the door and slammed it shut. She spun around and tried to get back. She stepped towards the shed, but it wasn&#8217;t there. Had she turned exactly around? It was pitch black in the cold night. The clouds obscured even starlight. Now she was facing the wrong way as the arctic blast assaulted her naked, helpless body. She screamed, dropping the snow in her hands, and feeling around wildly for the shed. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It seemed like forever, but she finally felt it and found the door. Keeping a foot against the building, she scooped up more snow and hurriedly retreated back indoors. She was crying as she flung herself down between the space heaters again. She&#8217;d never been so cold in her life. Her shivering was violent and uncontrolled, but she held onto the snow, holding it by the heater to melt it. Several minutes later, she lapped up the meager amount of water it produced. She was still thirsty.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Several more times she had to repeat the process of going outside for snow. The rest of the time she sat alone, staring at the walls by the dim glow of the heating coils. She wasn&#8217;t tired, and the night seemed endless. She screamed a few times during the night. It was unbearable waiting&nbsp; in terror.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In time, as Sheila sat going crazy, she saw a glow. The sun was finally coming up again. It had seemed so much longer than a real night. She was finally getting tired, though she&#8217;d catnapped once or twice. The sun&#8217;s glow was coming from a spot not too far from where it had set. Only then did she realize how far north she was. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When it was light enough to see, she resolved herself and flung open the door. She had to find that envelope. The cold was unbelievable. She could barely move, but still staggered around to the back of the shed. She finally saw that she was surrounded by wilderness on all sides. Not a sign of humanity was present aside from the shed, the generator, the envelope clothes-pinned to it, and the thermometer placed beside the envelope. She grabbed both and fled back to the shed. The thermometer read thirty-eight below zero.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With shaking hands, she managed to open the envelope. A single sheet of typed words were inside.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Welcome to a deserved hell, Sheila Chan. We hope you appreciate our explanation. You have said in your press conferences that decisions had to be made, so now you have to make decisions. You have said that you made choices with limited information. Now you will do the same, because the generator will run out of fuel some time. You do not know when, so decide with your limited information. You have said that alternative housing exists for people to use. This is true for you now. One direction will get you out alive to almost certain rescue. The others will let your frozen body discovered in the spring. You value the rough and tumble world you helped to create. Now value the world we created for you. Its not fun or funny to have your life jerked around by arrogant cunts, so we are jerking around your arrogant cunt life. If you live, this lesson may be repeated, cunt.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sheila couldn&#8217;t help but scream in horror at what she&#8217;d read. It was cheap, semi-literate drivel, but the implications for her survival were horrifying. At the same time, it gave her something certain to hold onto. There was no reason to wait. She sat and warmed her feet by the space heaters until they were hot to the touch. Then she gulped hard as she went to the door and charged out.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One direction led to survival. Maybe. If the note hadn&#8217;t lied. But staying put lead to certain death.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Help me!� she screamed as she stumbled as fast as she could in a random direction, basically south. �Help me please!�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And she ran into an unknown and terrifying future.
