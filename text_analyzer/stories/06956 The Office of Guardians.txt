The Office of Guardians

Synopsis: This story is long and slow, detailed. If you like stories full of horrifc violence that would leave its victims physically scarred and emotionally damaged for life, then this is not for you.I am more interested in violence as tool in forcing surrender, compelling women to decide that they must become submissive, that they will have to obey. To realize that they must make every effort to be what is required of them, to co-operate in their humiliation and hide, even from themselves, their dislike of what they must do. I find that mental process, that shift of reality erotic, rather than the simple violence itself.






Chapter One 


Aged 38 years old, Brigadier Samuel House found that his wife had taken alover, that she further wanted a divorce and wanted it as quickly as possible.
Having long recognized that his marriage had foundered as an emotionalunion, and focusing his energies on his career, he agreed to everything; agenerous settlement, custody of their two children and much more besides.
He also agreed to take the blame as he felt that as they grew up his childrenwould find lapses by their father more understandable and forgivable thanthose of a mother. An old fashioned and honourable man. Six weeks later he 
was shocked to discover that his wife had turned up to the hearing armed withan eminent barrister presenting a totally different view of events and weepingcopiously at the 'cruelty' of their life together. His generosity was representedas an ultimatum, forced upon an unfortunate woman who found herselfbetrayed and without money, with nowhere to go in the face in cold and unfeeling 
husband. He was stripped of practically everything. The modest 
Shropshire estate that had been in his family for 250 years, and which he hadbeen so intensely proud to succeeded to when his father died 8 years beforewas effectively hers now, except he had to pay for its upkeep. He could see his 
children when she felt it convenient, and she made it very clear that with herlover installed it would not be convenient. The children were both teenagersand away at Boarding School, but when he enquired the schools both made itvery clear he would not be allowed to see them without their mother'spermission. He could fight if he wished, but the unsupported charges had beenaccepted by the court and any further proceedings would be controlled by thesecret Family Courts safe from public scrutiny, and of course he would have topay her unrestrained legal costs. He would get nowhere, they were lost to him,
and fighting would only ruin him financially. 

Later in the same year the government triumphantly produced a reportshowing that now most Army Officers came from comprehensive schools andwere men and women who had chosen the services as career. Analysis madeclear that the day when the Army was run by a clique of men from the minorAristocracy were gone, and now a senior General was as likely to have asecond hand car salesman from Luton for his father, as a Peer of the Realm. 
The entrenched loyalties of the old officer class were taken for granted ascontinuing in the new, certainly these men were every bit as ferociously loyalto Queen and country, but no one really questioned what form that loyaltymight take, and how they saw their place in the turbulence of modern Britain.
The government was mightily pleased that the Masonic influence wasdiminishing, and because they saw no organised and coherent replacementthey assumed that the services were becoming ever more complaisant to theirpolitical will. 

Later that year a Junior Home Office minister came up with a particularlybrilliant plan for the BBC conundrum. The BBC had been a problem to 
Governments for decades. To suggest funding it from taxation would lead toan onslaught from the BBC to protect its independence. The BBC was fiercelyproud of its fair mindedness and independence from political influence, exceptof course when its own interests were threatened. When that happened it was 



every bit as ruthless and unfair as the tabloids, with that wonderful aura ofsanctimonious hypocrisy that only a priesthood can achieve. And it needed 
money, more and more money. The licence fee had been pushed as far as waspolitically possible. Every new technology that had emerged in the last 20years, the BBC had to 'lead the way' etc., always with lots of staff on fatsalaries (We must have the best !). Governments had long been driven downthe road of maximising collection of the licence fee. This came down to 
sending single mothers, who frankly could not afford the licence, to jail whenthey naturally gave in to their kids who could not understand why thetelevision should remain switched off, and thought that their mother was justpunishing them by insisting that it stayed off. Caught, and of course unable topay the swingeing fine without imposing real hardship on their children, theywent to jail, in droves. When that became politically unacceptable, as well asludicrously expensive, they moved to deducting fines from Benefits at source.
But then, as the Benefits were not exactly generous to start with, the childrenwent hungry, and the government found itself confronted with press publicityabout children going to school half starved, tearful mothers explaining howlittle money they had after the fines had been taken out etc. Faced by theseimpossibilities, governments had wavered delicately for years, always 'doingsomething about it', in reality waiting for the situation to change. The Junior 
Minister proposed setting up the 'Office of Guardians' for mothers on benefit tohelp them manage their money better and so stay out of trouble. The 
advantages were obvious, there were many of these women who werelamentably in-effective at managing their finances and benefited from the 
help. It was stunningly cheap. The cost of a Social Worker spending 1 hour aweek against the huge cost of imprisonment or the deadly political effect ofdeduction. It was also quite effective, the BBC did actually get more money,
and of course sweetest of all it totally out flanked the BBC who the politiciansjustifiably regarded as a voracious behemoth incapable of gratitude. Politicallythe scheme could be presented as basically humanitarian, as these unfortunatewomen were being given the assistance of experienced successful women whoknew how to run their lives. As always with these schemes the early goodresults faded away as the women soon learnt that all this good moneymanagement was OK and did keep them away from debt, but it left no moneyat all for any fun (with or without the children). So they started paying less andless attention to the Social Workers appointed as their Guardians and rathermore to their own whims and desires. The scheme had been started in a blaze 
of glory with promises of steadily increasing revenue which the BBC hadalready put into its budgets, and spent; but as time went by targets weremissed and revenue from the scheme fell. To offset this The Guardians were 
given greater direct control over the women's finances. Many Social Workersdemurred at this, but the extra money had been subsumed into their latest payrise and it just wasn't worth arguing. A tougher breed was imported to the 
scheme. Retired Women Police officers and others from the branches of publicservice that instill scepticism and distrust into a person. The Guardians were 
given direct control of a woman's finances if the Office of Guardians concludedit was appropriate. There was no political problem because the BBC wasunfailingly supportive in its coverage, always willing to back political policiesthat filled its coffers, and the same time indignant at the suggestion that it hadentered politics. The net was then widened to include more single mothers.
The government recognising a vehicle for reducing part of the Social Securitybudget, widened it again, hoping that if it worked in bringing in money for the 



BBC, it might work in bringing in money for the government. The Junior 
Minister became Home Secretary. 

Not long afterwards the Minister of Agriculture announced an initiative toimprove conditions on chicken farms. The tabloid press, finding that theMinister had a distant relation by marriage who manufactured chicken farmequipment insisted on seeing the whole thing as the Minister corruptly helpinghis family. After 6 weeks of furious tabloid hounding the poor man gave up andresigned. Had had not know this relative existed until the Daily Star dug him 
up. He sued for libel. The convention had always been that politicians do notsue for libel over essentially political comment. His colleagues tried todissuade him; but feeling that he had been the victim of a dishonest vendettafor no better reason than to sell more newspapers he pressed on. The judgeweighed the political argument against the willful destruction of his career andagreed with him. The damages were millions of pounds. The Appeal Courtoverturned the judgement, but the Law Lords re-instated it, worried that theEuropean Court of Human Rights would see it as having been brought down bypolitical interference. Unimportant members of the House of Commonssuddenly found this an excellent way to bring in pots cash from damages.
Barristers had long complained that the highest standard of proof demanded inBritish law was that needed to support a defence of truth in a libel action; theEuropean Court had expressed concerns at the one-sidedness of the UK Libellaws, and the exemplary nature of damages awarded. A flurry of similar libelactions made the situation so serious that the government had to make extraordinary 
loans to the newspaper industry to keep it afloat. Fierce politicianbashing editors now had to doff their caps in print, if not quite in the street.
The general public vaguely noticed that their newspapers had become lessvitriolic, but the government soon found this new situation so comfortable, thatthey could never quite bring themselves to change the law to bring thepersecution and hounding back down upon their own heads. To any Editor whogriped about it, they could say with absolute truth, "Well it was us who savedyou, after all". 

A favourite problem of the day to worry about was the imbalance betweenmale and female births. It had now for some years been possible for parents tochoose the sex of their intended children. As most women wanted to have a 
boy and a girl, but started with the rosy idealised view of motherhood thatbelongs to those women who have never experienced the realities of it, theygenerally chose to have girl first because that fitted in better with a RoseCottage view of it all. With family sizes continuing to decline most never gotpast the first, with the result that for many years female births had outnumbered male births two to one. Successive governments hadacknowledged that legislation would be entirely in-effective in stopping parentsmaking this choice, given the technology now available to them, and so haddone precisely nothing apart from 'initiatives' that lasted as long as thenewspaper coverage. Most nasty demographic problems have a way ofresolving themselves without government help so they had sat back andwaited for it to go away. Many studies had been completed as to why therehad been no swing back to boys. There had been studies into why every pollinvestigating parents plans for children showed a balanced intent betweenboys and girls, but stubbornly the birth rate remained at two to one. Most 
worrying, it had now dawned on the Sociologists that as these generations had 



grown to adulthood the young men had found themselves with a lot of choice,
which they took full advantage of, and why not ? Young women growing upfound themselves in a peer culture that saw men as totally un-reliable. Theysaw to it that they and they alone decided the gender of their children, andthey wanted daughters who they felt would be more likely to remain close tothem. What had started as an inadvertent effect had become a deliberate 
social preference. 

Chapter Two 

Later that year the retiring Army Chief of Staff was replaced, not for the firsttime, by a woman officer, General Annette Frazer. She had made her career in 
the Army Legal department, where she had specialised in using the regulationsand the law to tame the still rather laddish culture popular in the ranks. She 
owed her appointment to politics, and definitely not to military skill. Give her a 
courtroom battle and she was formidable, but of the battlefield she knew 
nothing. Generally people who rise high in the peacetime army possess a dealof political skill and guile in handling their colleagues, but she had none of that.
Used to getting her way by threats and the sour ridicule of the courtroom forwhich she was roundly hated and even more feared. The Minister of Defenceseeing her skill and charm at public speaking thought that she was very wellliked, and when she consulted some of her colleagues and receivedunexpected and straight forward advice, she dismissed them as either selfseeking or misogynists. The senior ranks of the Army, male and female, wereinsulted and infuriated by the appointment, but the minister was right whenshe had assumed they would accept her un-questioningly. Privately the wholecabinet thought it a good idea if she could be more successful at controlling thedrunken excess of the rank file, which the newspapers never tired of reporting.
What the rather weak Minister of Defence had not bargained for was that thepersonality problems General Frazer had been struggling with for many yearswere now overwhelming her, and she had gone quietly barmy. Hence the 
dinner with 3 senior officers where she promised all three of them that sheintended to make every effort to break them and drive from the service indisgrace, and that she had the evidence to do it. One of those officers wasBrigadier, now General House. Others came from less exalted beginnings.
General Tom Rochester had started life on a London Housing estate. As an 
adolescent he had been known as Ratty, a fair summary of his character. He 
had shaken that off when he joined the Army. When an old acquaintance hadturned up in his life some years later and tried to re-introduce it, he had killedhim. Taken him to a country pub, got him dead drunk, left him lying in themiddle of a fast country lane. Oh dear. The third officer treated to GeneralFrazer's startling revelation was General Harry Bligh. Education in a 
Nottingham Comprehensive, with a First from Oxford and a PhD in MilitaryStrategy he was, however you looked at it, clever man. He was the real targetof General Frazer's remarks because she recognized in him one of the fewpeople with the wit and resource to threaten her position. Harry realised that,
knew at once that his career, and probably his pension, for he knew her as avindictive cow, was in great danger. He also realized that the others had taken 
what she had said largely at face value, and so would be allies in anything hemight attempt. Neither of them could afford to lose their position in the Army,
and he was sure that both would fight. 



The pressure on the rank and file to conform to what a society expected hadcaused great resentment among the rankers. That society in its most visibleface consisted of young women without enough men to go round, and lackingthe earthy contribution that men bring had become, to put it bluntly, downrightprissy. There had been a steady increase in support for Right wing groups 
among young men. The analysts had put this down to a succession of differentcauses, unemployment, race issues, asylum seekers, lack of success at schooland so on. But it was none of these. These men found themselves in a society 
that gave them no way to belong. It offered no path to success for most of 
them. So they formed into loose affiliations and made as much trouble,
violence and mayhem as possible. Those groups had strong links into therankers in the army, many of whom were women of a wilder disposition thantheir sisters and found life much more fun joining with these lads than theheavily feminized society outside. Not that they joined in with particularly 
sexual intent. The army recruiters were adept at judging which girls wanted tojoin the army simply because it was full of bed worthy blokes, and which oneswanted to be part of a fighting unit. And the Army had changed. Its former 
stated allegiance to the Queen, whom the soldiers honoured, had beenreplaced by an allegiance to Parliament, whom the soldiers regarded as a packof lying, self seeking hypocrits. The politicians saw only that they hadcompleted an important step in transferring any remaining power from Queento Parliament, but the rock of loyalty to the sovereign having been broken, theArmy had become a loose canon, with loyalty to no one except their comradesand commanders. 

The long recession meant that more and more women were out of work. The 
malaise that had befallen the USA left the world with a lack of sense of 
direction. Whereas half a century before the talk was of globalisation, now thetalk was regionalization. Everywhere a more parochial view of the world 
prevailed. Britain was not alone in its birth rate imbalance, the associated 
feminization of most European nations brought a staid calm to Europeanrelations, at least in public. It was normal for Inter Governmental conferences 
to consist largely of women delegates, with the long standing EU principle ofmaking bold declarations about everything under the sun, and then when theygot home only actioning the parts they liked. The effect was that the EUbecame more and more a talking shop that made little difference on theground. The initial purpose of the EU, to prevent wars in Europe, had witheredas the whole region had sunk into a collective introspection. There were still 
those with drive and dynamism, but they were no longer admired, their actionsno longer thought relevant. 

The more women there were out of work, the harder things became for theGovernment. It was now normal for a Guardian to be given the power ofcontrol all aspects of a woman's finances on request. The Courts, having seena succession of actions against Guardians had built up a body of case law thatmade it very difficult for a woman to obtain any redress from the Courtsagainst her Guardian. Their only real recourse was to complain to the Office ofGuardians, who only took action in the most blatant cases of abuse. The 
problem was in essence the existence of a large group of mothers of childrenwho expected the state to provide them with a very relaxed and easy life. The 
lack of employment opportunities meant that any real pressure on them to go 



out and find work had long since tailed off into mere formality. All this was paidfor by people who did work, largely women, many with families themselves,
who no longer saw this provision as humanitarian protection of theunfortunate, but rather supporting the idle at their expense. So althoughpeople were aware of the increasingly extensive powers of the Office ofGuardians, largely un-reported in the press, they made no protest becausethey welcomed it as an institution that lightened the heavy load of this support. 

For Harry Bligh the future looked particularly bleak. If he was dismissed the 
service he would be penniless, obliged to find some demeaning job to makeends meet. Time was when he could have gone straight to one of the armsmanufacturers. But arms sales had been banned for over 10 years, and thegovernment didn't buy much, so there were no arms companies to go to.
Before he could have gone to the USA, but the Americans were reallystruggling now, isolationism was rife, and while they never had much faith inthe British military, nowadays they were insultingly dismissive. Harry had neverthought there would ever be any change to British democracy. But then he hadnever thought that Scotland would become independent, or that the House ofLords would be reformed, reformed again, and then abolished. He had neverthought about the real possibility of being disgraced, un-employed and goingwithout. Widely admired for his achievements with many acquaintances andfriends in the forces he was a man who was widely trusted. If he put his stampon project, if he put his gravitas behind a proposal, it would be taken seriously,
certainly in the Army and the Air Force. He began to think the un-thinkable.
He drew up strategy for a military take over. This would not be some Latin 
American style coup with no subtlety and a high body count. That would besure to get out and the people would hate it. What was needed was physicalcontrol and pressure, but only in the right places. 

As his plans developed he sounded out General House and General Rochesterand was reassured at the extent they had been thinking along the same lines.
Clearly Annette Frazer may have intended this reaction to entrap them and usethis to achieve her aims instead of the shaky evidence she had already found.
Recognizing that they were inexperienced conspirators they immediately sawthat they would not succeed in entirely concealing their plot from the securityservices. MI5 was run by a personal friend of General Frazer. So they decidedon using the minimum forces necessary, and speed. They planned to takeaction in 10 days time. Those commanders who needed to be brought in wouldbe sounded out about a timescale of 4 months. MI5 would almost certainly let 
it run to see who came in. Having pledged their support they would find out in9 days time, that it was now, tonight. Those who welched would be shot out of 
hand, but they would be careful and there shouldn't be too many, if any. Withthose three commanders they had an Armoured division, and two Infantrydivisions with a lot of support vehicles, armoured personnel carriers etc.
Enough to take control of the key sites, plenty if the rest of the forces gavetacit support and did nothing. 

The plan was simple. Not to take over and replace the government, but to join 
it, and control it. The Prime Minister was admired for her enormous courage,
Harry looked forward to finding out how much she had with a gun at her head.
That would be interesting. 



At 4am in Chequers on the morning of Sunday 16th May as it was getting light,
the Prime Minister awoke to the sound of shouting in the corridor outside her 
room. The door burst open and several soldiers marched in and took uppositions securing the room, a bit theatrical, but it made the point. They totallyignored her hectoring and increasingly frantic demands to know what wasgoing on. She found out a few moments later when Brigadier House marchedinto the room and 'took her into Protection for her own safety'. Protection fromwhat ? She was marched downstairs and shown a video, a tape of her midtwenties daughter and child sitting in a cell, and then shots of her son, still atUniversity, also in a cell. Nothing was said. She was told clearly what to doand firmly handled by two women soldiers to make sure she did it. They thensat her at a table, put a sheaf of papers in front of her and told her to startsigning. When she demurred, one of her female 'companions' brought atruncheon down on her left hand with enough force to break some fingers.
They told her again to start signing, with the polite intimation that if she did notthey would call the two prisons and have the guards there start on her family.
After some minutes they let her hear the sound of her son howling down thephone. It wasn't him of course, just a tape assembled from old material, and ifthey had told their fellows to torture their high profile inmates they wouldalmost certainly have refused. They were already being quite bolshy aboutwhat they were actually doing there. But the Prime Minister did not know all 
this, and confused, hurt and terrified for her children she started to sign. 

There was considerable surprise at the appointment of Brigadier House asMinister of Defence, which the accompanying Press statement went only wentsome way to allaying. Even more remarkable was Mr Bligh as Deputy PrimeMinister, no longer General Bligh he had resigned from the Army for form'ssake. Quite why the government had abandoned its previous, apparently antimilitary 
position was not clear, but they clearly had. It was noted by many inand around Whitehall that there were many more military about but otherwisenot much seemed to have changed. Of course those parts of the Army notinvolved in the original coup soon recognized Brigadier House as a man with alot of power and favours to dispense. Most fell into line very quickly, thestubborn ones were posted to where they could do no harm. One month laterthe government announced that the introduction of military experience toMinisterial office had been so successful that they were extending the system.
A number of Junior ministers were replaced with Army officers. Normally in aMinisterial team the Minister of State leads, and Junior Ministers work under 
their direction. But now that almost all Ministries had an Army officersomewhere in the team, and given that the real power stood behind him, if theArmy had a view of an issue, or wanted something, the Ministry always didwhat was asked. 

In no more than two months, with not a single shot fired, not one person'disappeared', no changes to the law, and without any change to theconstitution (how could there be ? there never was one), a small group of Armyofficers had taken over control of the nation. General Rochester (Ratty) had 
what he wanted. He was appointed Junior Minister for the Family at the HomeOffice. Ratty had his own agenda to follow and chance had given him the toolswith which to do it. He quite understood that what was driving House was therage he felt at being swindled out of historical rights by a daft legal system.
House would go along with anything that was presented as remedying that 



situation, both for himself and for other men similarly roughly handled by the 
courts. He calculated that once that objective was achieved House would relaxand, at least in spirit, go back to the Army he loved so much. Not Ratty, he 
knew what he wanted. Power. He didn't want to be Emperor, but he wanted tobe Shogun, and he could see how to get it. Ex-general Bligh was to all intentsthe man running the country, but he needed men like Ratty who could neverrise so high alone, and used their unscrupulous methods to watch his back forhim. In return Ratty got the powers he wanted. 

Chapter Three 

Within three months the police service had been made subordinate to localarea Army command, the Crown Prosecution service had been brought undermilitary discipline, the Inland Revenue was obliged to make available all itsdatabases on personal finances available to the Home Office. A selected cadre 
of reliable officers were placed in charge of key installations in the Ministry ofDefence and promoted to new positions of Area commander. The Generals 
kept their important titles and impressive sounding responsibilities, but realpower, even in the Army, had slipped from them. The Ministry of Defence madethe appointments and defined areas of responsibility. The Generals found 
themselves out of jurisdiction when they tried to curb the actions of the AreaCommanders. When they complained to the MOD they were told to shut up, or 
resign. The RAF had as ever been slow to grasp the changing situation, butwere kept sweet with orders for new planes. The same process of promotingreliable men soon dissipated the threat they initially posed, and they were nowa solid junior partner in the new military assisted government. The Navy,
always notorious for not quite grasping what was going on politically, werepolitely advised to take a flying fuck, in the case of one senior Admiral, quiteliterally. 

In this way a loose but firm grip was established, loose enough so that ordinarypeople hardly noticed any charge, and what they did see was often for thegood. But the grip was steel hard, and those who rebelled soon ran against thenew limits of freedom, and found them very firm indeed. There were obvious 
tangible benefits. Mugging disappeared almost over hight. Without the need 
to worry about court actions and legal reprisals etc, anyone the Army thoughtwas a mugger got a beating and told not to do it again. City centres becamesafe places at night as drunken thuggery was wiped out. 

The people who noticed the biggest change were the soldiers themselves, whofound themselves in a very different Army from the one they had joined, leadby men with the zeal and authority to make it into a crack force that could anddid endure limitless hardship on exercise, and knew how to behave in thecompany of civilians. After all, they had no need to go looking for fights, theirwork assisting the police gave them plenty of opportunity for fighting. Thefavourite technique for dealing with disruptive violent criminals was to waituntil they sobered up, and then put them into a 10 round bare knuckle fightagainst a soldier, with no knockouts. The soldier was always chosen so that hewould win, and the yob got beaten to pulp. Of course if the un-thinkable 
happened and the yob started winning, they changed the soldier. 



The philosophy of forgiveness was not one espoused by Ratty. If he had ever 
inadvertently forgiven anything in his life it was a mere accident offorgetfulness. As a singularly un-attractive man he had in his mind a long listof women who had turned him down, humiliated him, laughed at him, or justplain ignored him. As part of the fruits of power he intended to settle accountswith these girls, and to have a great deal of fun with any others he fancied.
Bligh and House would have been deeply shocked had they known what was intheir colleague's mind, but they did not, and being the kind of innocents whoassume that everyone is essentially fair minded they had no idea of what wasgoing on. Bligh had not noticed quite how much power flowed through Ratty,
and how much came under Ratty's remit rather than his. As he had never had 
much interest in power he had no sense of loss, and as he had no interest inadministration it never occurred to him how much must be going on that hewas completely un-aware of. 

An early move from Ratty was to appoint a crony as head of the Office ofGuardians. This man then cleared out anyone who was either clever orawkward and filled the vacancies with his own place men. He organized the 
establishment of regional offices. All on the same plan, a large establishmentoutside the town to function as a detention centre for women, with a local 
police station taken over as a small sub-office and staging post in town. Thelarge cities were dealt with by building the Main offices on derelict ground inlandscaped gardens, closed to the public, with sub-offices near the centres asrequired. Whilst they all were clearly labeled, the labeling was understatedand and reassuringly friendly. Those people who noticed their existence 
thought nothing of it. After all the Office of Guardians had been in existence 
for many years and excited little comment. The new head of the Office ofGuardians, Bill Handley, had recently retired early from the Army after ascandal involving the alleged sexual assault of a female civilian worker on theBase where he was based. He had got off, but the Army had decided to be rid 
of him. He still raged with indignation at the accusations of this woman, andhumiliation he had suffered as a result. The fact that what she had said was 
true didn't seem to affect him. He was the ideal man to convert the Office of 
Guardians into what Ratty wanted it to be. A gifted administrator who trustedno one and nit picked everything, give him a set of numbers and he spot theflaws with skill and speed, ask him to inspect a Base and he would tell youstraight off who was on the fiddle, who was not to be trusted (not the samething at all), and who the trouble makers were. 

Under Bill Handley the Office of Guardians presented a steady flow oflegislative recommendations that were all passed as Orders in Council underthe original enabling legislation that widened the scope of the OG long beforethe change in government. Enabling legislation was a device long beloved ofBritish governments, whereby an act would be passed with breathtaking scopebut only a small part actually implemented from the start. Governments would 
say that they only intended to implement the rest as necessary, as thesituation develops etc. What they did choose to implement was then passed asan Order in Council by the Privy Council, which being chaired by the Queen,
and barred from any kind of party political discussion invariably rubberstamped whatever the ruling Executive of the day put in front of it. Of further 
Parliamentary inspection of the legislation there was none. The original OGrevision had cast its possible powers so wide that it could be used to cover 



almost any legislation in this area that the government required. Parliament atthe time, being dominated by women and accustomed to the vanity that it wasthe only and true protector of women's interests simply did not see the howdangerous what it was doing might turn out to be. In fact some of the women'spressure groups saw the whole thing as an excellent move, as men wereobviously now also to be brought under the control of the OG, and theyanticipated being able to engineer a situation where men could be locked upon demand on the flimsiest of pretexts. This would all be justified as 
preventing sexual violence. In fact, by the time the military joined thegovernment none of this had happened, although it had definitely become partof the plan. It was the logical extension of the 1997 and 2003 Sexual Offencesacts that sent men to prison without anybody who had access to all the factshaving the job of deciding whether an offence had actually been committed, or 
not. 

Some of this new legislation was drawn up in meetings with Rattyand his legal adviser, a man he picked from the lower reaches of the HomeOffice legal team because he recognised in him the same spiteful cunningvindictive qualities he knew in himself. Steadily, step by step, they prepared alegal environment that would provide the perfect tool for the repression of 
women. It was their intention that society would teach women their place, andset up systems that made sure women would do what they were told. Theywanted to ensure that every woman knew she was answerable to a man andthat she must obey that man, and that if she did not she would pay a price forher insolence that would quickly cow her into submission. 

One of Bill Handley's early actions was to appoint Brigadier House as his exwife's 
Guardian, giving him total control over all her affairs. He controlled her 
bank account � she could only find out the balance if he told here, he decided ifshe should continue to hold a driving licence, hold a credit card, where shemight live. She could not apply for a job, nor resign from one without hispermission, any pay from her employment would go into her bank account andhe would give her as much cash as he thought appropriate. As her Guardian 
he controlled her life. With enormous satisfaction House immediately set offwith a quartet of squaddies to his lost estate. His wife's lover was escorted to 
the gate with only the clothes he stood up in. As all his money had come fromHouse's ex-wife, and that was now under the control of House, he was relieved 
of any money he had as well. They took him to Crewe railway station, boughthim a ticket, thumped him half senseless, and put him penniless on a train thatwasn't stopping for the next 150 miles. They also told him that if they evermet up with him again, anywhere, then next time they would not be so nice tohim. House had brought with him strapping sergeant from the WRAC, this ladymade it quite clear to Mrs House that she had best mind her manners, showrespect, and be obedient when the Brigadier spoke to her. Her outragedexpostulations were met by a series of sharp slaps that continued until she wascrouched on her knees desperately trying to defend herself. 

The sergeant escorted her up to her bedroom to pack her things. She insistingon checking everything she packed, allowing only the most feminine andinsubstantial stuff, the expensive glamorous lingerie that she had bought toentertain and enthrall her exciting toy boy. She also made her change intohigh heels and a skirt, a very short skirt, and a cut off top bought for the beach, 



with only a very pretty lacy little thong underneath. 

House had decided to make her live in a small one room cottage on the northedge of the estate, where it bordered the massive coniferous forest owned bythe forestry commission. She would have a long walk to the village to get hersupplies, and a long walk home again. It had been un-occupied for sometime,
and the two soldiers had installed a bed, a table and a chair with some limited 
bedding. He had found her employment with an old friend who had beendelighted to hear of his planned return and was only too glad to give her a jobin his company. As her Guardian, House had already given him permissionuse whatever corporal punishment he saw fit, and had made it clear that heexpected to see her benefit from hard work, long hours and firm discipline.
She would start her new employment at 7am the following day, and she wouldfinish when he decided it was time for her to go home. The pay was almostnon-existent and she would have a long walk every day to and from work, butnone of that bothered House. Her packing finished, the sergeant now escortedher to her new home, lugging her suitcase in her high heels, struggling to keepgoing 'fast enough' to avoid another blow. She was told this was her new home 
and she must stay here or quite simply be imprisoned, she was told where shemust be for work at 7am in the morning, or suffer the consequences, she wastold to clean the place and get spotless or else, and then left to get on with it.
When the door closed behind the sergeant and the footsteps retreated sheburst into tears and wept on the kitchen table, only to have the door burstopen moments later by a furious WRAC sergeant who knocked her off her chair,
thrashed her with an old belt that came to hand whilst she got out whatcleaning materials she could find and set to cleaning the Kitchen floor. The 
sergeant sat at the table watching, giving her an occasional kick by way ofencouragement to work harder. 

Elsewhere House wandered around his rediscovered domain in a daze of 
delight, each room bringing more joy, more memories. Touching, gazing,
remembering and once again possessing he was like a blind man whose sighthad been restored, he saw everything so clearly, so sharp, and with so muchpleasure. He would get a Housekeeper to look after the place, not a dreadfulold frump, someone young and pretty. Yes, he would enjoy that, and shewould work to keep the house nice for him, and in the evening, well she wouldbe in no position to refuse him other pleasures. Perhaps a maid as well. 

Chapter Four 

The traumatic change in her life that the ex-Mrs House experienced was anextreme form of what was happening to women throughout the country. Those 
lucky enough to be married to a man who stayed with them were best off, buteven then their menfolk sensed the change in the wind and felt able to take amuch tougher line with their wives. The women no longer felt confident thatleft on their own they 'would be alright', they submitted. Single women had no 
way of avoiding the new regime. 

Like most women Susan had not particularly noticed the changes taking placeso rapidly around her. It was not reported in the newspapers, it was certainlynot to be found on television. She had been given a Guardian years ago when 



she was in University. Arrested on a drugs possession charge, as an orphanshe had been put in the charge of Mr. Morrissey. A nice old buffer, whom she 
still went to see once a month, when she could manage the time, which wasnot often these days. Well past retirement he showed a patient interest in hergoings on, although it did not occur to her ask him about himself and shecertainly had no idea what he thought of her. She would had been deeply 
offended had she found out. Morrissey had resisted the drip ofrecommendations and advisories given to Guardians by the simple expedientof not reading them. He had not enforced any of the rules on her which werenow seen as de rigeur. She still had her own bank account, drove a car, had acredit card even. She often wore trousers, even sometimes when she went to 
see him, even though he had pointed out that this was an embarassment tohim. She didn't of course listen, she thought of him as an old fool and had nointention of taking his advice about anything. She went to see him because 
she felt he should not be left entirely on his own. 

Those women who found themselves under the new regime experienced a verydifferent form of Guardianship, with strict discipline that ran to a caning whentheir Guardian felt it warranted, and rigidly enforced code of silence about theirrelationship with their Guardian. And they kept silent, as the easiest way for awoman to curry favour with her Guardian was to shop some other poor cow fortalking out of turn. It made it almost impossible to talk safely, so most kept 
quiet. As a result women were aware that a rapidly increasing number hadGuardians, but they had no idea of what this meant in practice. Susan hadrecently gone shopping with a friend and was surprised that she had no creditcard and paid for everything in cash. She had always been a happy go luckyspendthrift, and now she was so careful, spent almost nothing, and kept all herreceipts. Susan inferred that the girl was worried for her job, it never crossedher mind that the credit card had been canceled by her Guardian, and that heinsisted on an accounting for every penny spent, on pain of a thrashing. Left to 
guess at these changes she guessed wrongly, and her friend did not dare toenlighten her. 

She had noticed a change in atmosphere in the Claims Department where sheworked, but she had not thought very much about what prompted it. As 
number three in the whole site she was concerned at the symptoms of loss ofmorale, but on the other hand all the measurements of actual performanceshowed up well. There were fifty women working in the department now. Her 
boss was nearing retirement and she knew he would support her as hisreplacement. There were also rumours the head of department, David Jarrold,
was about to be given wider responsibilities and become the head ofInvestigation section as well. So when she took over from her boss she would 
effectively become Head of Department. It was a development in her careerthat she looked forward to, another rung climbed, more responsibility, more 
power. 

Susan did not have long to wait before he announced his retirement and thejob was advertised. She was worried of course that the appointment panelmight want to go for an outside candidate, but she had herself recently spenttwo years working for a competitor before returning to her current, more seniorposition. She got a copy of the application, touched up her Resume and put itall in the internal mail. She saw the question on the application form, "Female 



applicant - Name and address of Guardian". Well Mr. Morrissey used to be herGuardian years ago, but she did not really feel that he was any longer, so shewrote NA across the section and ignored it. She made mention of what she had 
learnt in her two years away and of her experience guiding trainee managers.
She had recently had in her charge one Graham Abram, in her opinion a ratherdoltish young man better equipped for playing football than management. She 
really felt that a man of 29 years ought to be more clued up, and she found ithard to come to terms with her maturity as a mother of 34 and his boyish viewof the world at 29. Her view of him was not helped by the way that so many ofthe women in the claims department positively simpered when he spoke tothem. Not that he much noticed, he was far too vague and un-focused to beproperly aware of his surroundings and his effect upon them. His work was not 
very good and although she had dutifully involved him in meetings for thedepartmental contribution to Strategy Revue he had contributed nothingwhatsoever, in her opinion because he had only the vaguest idea of what wasgoing on. A complete waste of space to be foisted off on some other section ofthe company as soon as possible. 

Her application duly arrived on the desk of David Jarrold who read it with 
amusement. A fly politician he had offered himself as a voluntary Guardian assoon it started to look interesting. He was currently responsible for six womenand was on first name terms with all the other Guardians in the area. The 
Office of Guardians currently considered all un-married women to be in need ofa Guardian if they were living away from home and either over 25 years old, orwhose fathers had passed on, through death or just passed on to a life inanother town. Women younger than this were the responsibility of theirfathers, married women the responsibility of their husbands, even if they wereseparated or divorced. Of the women considered in need of a Guardian some 
25% had been assigned. There was a dignified rush to look after the elderlywidows, because a Guardian had complete control of the woman's financialaffairs. All Guardians soon realized that the job had become a sinecure thatallowed them to plunder the funds of the women in their charge without fear ofpenalty, and this was why most of them volunteered. The management hadgot rid off all female Guardians at stroke not long after the start of the AssistedGovernment, and was now slowly weeding out those men who joined when itwas still a service intended to help women as a opposed to the instrument ofcontrol and social change. Jarrold had wondered about Susan for some time, 
and seeing the NA scrawled on the Guardian section of her form thought aboutwhat to do with her. She had been appointed against un-expressed wisheslargely because the then female Personnel Manager had pushed for her againstthe candidacy of a very well qualified young man that Jarrold would havepreferred. He found her quite insufferable, never wrong, quick to criticise, slowto praise, arrogant and self assured far beyond her merits. Mind you, theapplicants were a sorry lot, the only one with any actual experience beingGraham Abram, hardly more than a trainee. As management positions were nolonger open to women, there was strong competition for the male candidateswith the right stuff, and so he would have to take what he could get. Abram's 
referees and his references wrote highly of him. Naturally he had not givenSusan as one of them, she would not have been consulted if he had. Jarrold 
had heard her airing her low opinion of him whenever she got the chance, andanyway she was a woman, so any reference from her would not count in amanagerial appointment. He would have to see about Susan. Clearly her 



current position was managerial and that would not do. With her protectedposition as the protege of the Group Personnel manager, Jarrold had had to beextremely careful in his dealings with her. 

He thought about the candidates on and off all weekend, and came to theconclusion that Abram was clearly the best of the bunch. More important, he 
could not afford to mess about too much or he might go. Driving in to work onMonday morning he resolved to interview the man that day. One of the side 
benefits of the new regime was that fewer and fewer women drove, or wereallowed to drive, with a dramatic reduction in traffic volumes. Getting in to 
work was a breeze. One of the small points that made men feel that things hadchanged for the better. He saw Abram at 2pm and after an hour and a half ofdiscussion and analysis decided that he liked the lad and that he had potential.
He offered him the job. It was clear that things had slipped somewhat in theClaims department and they got down to work that afternoon to form plans andideas for its improvement. George had only applied for the post on the off-
chance, for the experience, and he was astonished to find himself the onlycandidate interviewed, and so clearly Susan, who he thought was sure to beappointed, had not been seriously considered. But he could think well on his 
feet and had no intention of letting the opportunity slip. As soon as the talk 
turned to the future of the department he thought of the paper on his desk thatSusan had given him to proof read. It was her paper, but a couple of the ideaswere his and she had not acknowledged him, nor even as far he could tell hadshe remembered that he had contributed them. He knew that the document in 
draft did not actually have her name on it yet. Ah well, he could steal too. 
"Too tell you the truth Mr. Jarrold I had been thinking about this for some timeand I have drafted a paper on the subject that might contribute to thediscussion. Shall I go and get it ?". "Oh no", says Jarrold, "you have a staff 
now". He buzzed his secretary who was just about to finish for the day and toldher to call Susan to his office. An excellent opportunity thought Jarrold. Well 
have her running errands, and we'll bring her down a peg or two. 

Susan when she got the call decided immediately that Jarrold wanted to reviewher application prior to interview, and this reinforced her expectation of 
success. She retired quickly to the ladies to put on a little make up. Not much, 
because she normally never wore any at all, and a dab of perfume. She must 
not be obvious, enough for effect, not enough to be noticed, that was what shewanted. She got a rude shock when she walked into the room and saw Abramsitting there. She nearly blurted out "What is he doing here", but she didn't.
Of course, it must be disciplinary hearing, Abram had screwed up again andJarrold had found out. Having walked half way into the room she was leftdisconcerted as they both completely ignored her. She was reduced to 
announcing her self, "You sent for me David". Jarrold looked at her coldly. It 
was not the first time she had used his Christian name un-invited, but he would 
make damn sure she did not do it many more times. Jarrold nodded to Abram, 
"Susan, there is Manila folder in the top drawer of my desk, bring it here willyou". She was completely wrong footed. She did not know what to say, shelooked at Jarrold and he just gazed back at her, clearly waiting for her to dowhat had been asked. She looked at Abram, the same confident expectant 
look. Lacking any plan or clear idea of what else to do, and definitely notwanting to annoy Jarrold just now, she found herself leaving the room on herway to fetch the folder. What was going on ? She did not understand, why was 



she fetching Abram's notes when he must be in trouble. Perhaps Jarrold didn't 
want Abram to leave the room. That must be it. As she walked back into the 
room to hear them laughing and joking she had the sickening realisation thatshe had got this very wrong. Very wrong, and she knew what was in the folder. 

Of course she should have looked at it, she should have feigned illness, sheshould have hidden it and said it wasn't there; but she hadn't and now she 
could do nothing else but hand it over. If there had been a spare seat shewould have sat down, invited or not, and joined the meeting. But there wasn't 
so she was left standing in an awkward limbo, neither welcomed not dismissed.
Jarrold, knowing that his secretary had gone home spoke to her, "Susan fetch acouple of coffees will you, there's a good girl. Mine is white with sugar", helooked at Abram, "Black with sugar Mr. Jarrold". No 'please', not a polite 
request, an instruction. Not three coffees, two. She went and made the 
coffees in the kitchen alcove of the secretary's room. As the kettle slowlyboiled she edged back to the door so she could hear what was being said.
They were discussing her ! "Well she is quite good, Mr. Jarrold, when she 
focuses. But I have to say that there is a lack of application and tendency toexpend departmental resource on her own pet ideas". Damn cheek ! Who did 
he think he was ! "Well I expect you to deal with that. We need to get her nose 
to the grindstone properly, and keep it there. We can't afford passengers andwe'll have to make sure they shape up or ship out". What in hell's name was 
going on ? Jarrold was discussing her with her Junior. She set to finishing thecoffees so she could get in there and join the conversation. Best do it properly.
The milk was for Jarrold, so she put milk in a jug and set a tray, it would giveher an excuse to be present, time to inveigle herself into their meeting. She 
sailed in, making as much of an entrance as she could contrive and startedtransferring the contents of the tray to the table. They carried on talking 
completely ignoring her. When she had finished she smiled sweetly, andimmediately Abram said "You can go now Susan", she half opened her mouthto speak when Jarrold said "Good night". Then they sat and looked at her. She 
knew then that she was not going to get the job. The only rational explanationfor all this was the one that had simply not occurred to her. Jarrold had given 
Abram the job. It could not be so; but it must be so. She went and picked upher things from her office, out past security with the tears already in her eyes.
She got her car out of the car park and drove home weeping with rage. Even 
her 7 year old daughter failed to distract her and they had a big argumentwhich ended in her daughter being sent to bed early. 

On his way home Jarrold mused about Susan. Clearly she needed a Guardian,
but he did not want some martinet to get his hands on her before they hadtaught her how to do her job. Abram was right about her, and the report was 
hers of course, he knew that. Abram was absolutely right as head ofdepartment to claim it as his own, but they wanted to keep her ideas. She was 
useful, but she needed to be controlled. That night he called the Office andwas surprised to find that she was already in the charge of Joseph Morrissey.
Morrisey had joined when the Office was a public service and still sought tohelp the women in his charge rather than keep them on the straight and 
narrow. He would do nicely. Jarrold knew that Morrisey liked gentle distressedyoung mothers and would abhor this arrogant madam who thought of her ownselfishness as a virtue. When the clerk read him a summary of the file it was 
clear he was right. Jarrold knew from the files that Morrisey had some grit in 



him and whilst his gentle nature would prevent him from dealing with Susanhimself, he would not obstruct others would took on the task. Perfect. Jarrold 
would of course observe all the forms and niceties of the Office. As her 

employer he certainly could not seek to become her Guardian, but he was surethat Morrissey would give him the authority he needed. He wrote to the 
Chairman of the Assessment Board suggesting that Morrissey be invited tosharpen up his act a little. Susan still drove a car and he knew for a fact she 
still had a credit card and that should be stopped. Worst of all she often wore 
trousers, which any competent Guardian would have put a stop to right away.
The Chairman of Assessments called him the following morning to discuss thematter and he outlined what he thought needed to be done. Morrisey must 
enforce the minimum standards on Susan. He had checked Susan's time 
keeping record before leaving and it was not good. She had been 5 minutes 
late 3 times in the last 2 months according to security. It would be suggestedto Morrisey that Jarrold as an experienced Guardian himself be given a freehand to deal with his as he saw fit. 

The following morning Susan turned up to work almost late after a bad night'ssleep to find her colleagues all in flurry about the promotion of George. When 
she got to her desk there was a brown envelope in her mail curtly indicatingthat her application had been un-successful. Her colleagues were far tooexcited about George to worry about her, and showed little inclination to offerher much sympathy. She thought it strange that they did not. She had to 
endure the galling sight of George moving into the big office at the end of theopen plan, with its privacy and luxurious seclusion. All the windows were in 
that office, and whilst his predecessor had left the blinds open so that thewomen could see the sky, he shut them without a thought to keep himselfprivate. At 10 o'clock she knocked on his door and said "I just wanted tocongratulate you George, well done, no hard feelings". Liar, liar pants on fire.
He looked at her strangely and answered "I do not care for the ready us ofChristian names Susan, I prefer a more formal tone, is that clear ?". What 
could she say. Yes, Yes Sir ? No. "Yes, Mr. Abram, I wasn't thinking". He 
nodded, she was dismissed. As she walked out of the door "Remember next 
time Susan". He had had a note to talk to her about her time keeping, but hewas not about to encourage her to march into her office. She would learn to 
show a bit of respect. He would send for her later and tear her off a strip. He 
was looking forward to it. 

Mr. Morrisey had his meeting the following Wednesday. A private chat over 
sherry with the Chairman of Assessments. Morrisey was tired, deeply tired andwould really have rather been at home in a comfortable chair. Of the women 
he used to look after, there was only Susan left, the others having gone on toother towns, new husbands. Susan had come to him as convicted drug user,
her father had died when she was 16 years old, her mother followed 18 monthslater. She had been then a frightened and vulnerable creature with much good 
in her. He had watched her, helped her, find her feet, build a life. The arrival 
of her daughter Amy had not ruffled her. He never found out who the father 
was, all she would say was that at least Amy could only lose one parent.
Morrisey thought that what she really meant was that she was determined tohave all of Amy, whether it was good for Amy or not. But in those days therewas no chance of challenging such an attitude. Susan had been promoted, 
moved on and up. He could no longer see the charming warmth of her that 



had so made him want to help her. Whenever he thought of her he wondered 
where that warmth had gone. She was well paid, successful, and he did notcare for what she had become one little bit. It was agreed that the Bank wouldwrite to Susan canceling her credit card, and that custody of her Bank accountwould be transferred to himself. He agreed that the Office would prepare aletter requesting that her driving licence be revoked, and promised to talk toher about her choice of dress. He listened to the complaints from heremployers that she was un-feminine, a serious matter with the Office, that hertime keeping was poor, and that her attitude was entirely in need of reform.
For example she had just recently applied for a job without his permission,
without even consulting or informing him, dismissing all his work for her with'NA' under 'Guardian'. Until this point in the conversation Morrisey had simplybeen going along with the Chairman because he did not frankly care muchwhat happened to her. Now he was annoyed. He had put a lot of effort intoSusan's welfare in years gone by and he was very irritated that she had showna total disregard for the courtesies of their relationship, and made him look afool to boot. When it was suggested that her employers should use allappropriate means to deal with her disciplinary problems at work he readilyagreed. He knew full well that nowadays Guardians generally used corporalpunishment on their charges, and he was coming to the conclusion that Susanwas pretty much in need of it. 

Chapter Five 

George's discussions with Jarrold had given him confidence in his privateopinion that there was a major problem of discipline in the department. One 
of his first tasks was to build a file showing the status of each of the women.
Married, assigned to a Guardian and the un-assigned. The marrieds still livingwith their husbands he marked down for removal at the earliest opportunity.
For the un-assigned he wrote to the Office of Guardians requesting that actionbe taken and that they be assigned as soon as possible as the lack of theirproper supervision was prejudicial to smooth running of his department.
Jarrold got a letter back from the Office authorising the Company to assumeresponsibility for these women while in work, until a suitable Guardian wasfound for each of them. For those already assigned, he wrote to theirGuardians requesting that the Company be given freedom to use whatevermeans necessary to enforce proper standards at work. As all of these men 
controlled the financial affair of the women in their charge, and made a healthyprofit out of it, they were all quick to return an authorisation. There was no 
question of transferring the marrieds to another section, no one would havethem. They would be sacked, and a good thing too. In two weeks flat, throughJarrold, he had all the authority he needed to thrash any of the women in thedepartment, as and when he saw fit. Jarrold was no stranger to this kind ofbusiness. From the usual suppliers for the Office the Company bought a set ofequipment the same as he liked to use in his private capacity. A low foldinghorse, easy to set up, easy to store, over which a woman could stretched in aconvenient position with her knees well back and her lower legs secured,
presenting raised buttocks and sloping thigh backs to whatever punishmentwas to be inflicted. A set of canes of varying length and weight, and of coursea ball-gag to stop an undesirable chatter. This he stored in a locked cupboard 
in his office for the time being. They would set up a proper facility later when 



the new procedures were in place in all departments. 

After his conversation with Susan, George left it until noon and then askedMargery to tell Susan that he wanted to see her at 12.30. That would be the 
beginning of her lunch break. Margery was a bit of battle-axe, and had hopedto get the job Susan took when she returned to the company a year ago. She 
was a tough lady who had little sympathy for the frivolity and quick self pity ofso many of her colleagues. She knew what a hard life was really like and shebarely hid her contempt for their self indulgence. The others in their turn 
regarded Margery with the contempt that the young reserve for those who are'old'. Margery had struggled to get the Assistant Office Mangers job, and shewould let nothing, absolutely nothing, take it from her if she could help it. Her 
title 'Assistant Office manager' was window dressing for a post at Charge Handgrade, and that is not Management; lucky for her. She didn't like Susan, and 
the news that Abram had been promoted over her made the best day she hadhad in months. Margery and a few others took their lunch late at 1.30 pm.
When Susan knocked on Abram's door at 12.30, he wasn't there. Margery told 
her he had said he would be back shortly and she was to wait. So she waited, 
and waited, getting more and more irritated, until he turned up, at 8 minutes to1pm. He marched into his office, stood at the open door, and shouted "Susan"
to her, then went and sat down. When she walked in, he told shut the door. 
He then started on her time keeping record. Late 5 times in the last 2 months, 
what did she was playing at, who did she think she was. When she tried to 
correct him, he shouted at her "Don't lie to me ! This has to improve. We don't 
need slackers here. Keep this up and you will be out. Out ! Is that clear ?" and 
more of the same, on and on until 1pm. She left his office stunned at the 
barrage and set off to get her lunch. His voice behind her, "Susan, where do 
you think you are going ? It is 1pm. Get to your desk". Like that. In front of 
everyone. She had just been threatened with the sack for the first time in herlife, she sat down at her desk. She did not know what to do. She didn't know 
how to respond. She was not helped by the smirking of some of colleagueswho were hugely enjoying her further humiliation after failing to get thepromotion. 

When she got home that night she found completely in-explicable items ofmail. The first from the Credit card company demanding the immediate returnof her Credit card. The call centre could give no information other than thather card was cancelled and she must return it. When she asked them to uncancel 
it they said she must make a new application. If nothing else it was 
most in-convenient. She would have to go to the Bank and get enough moneyto cover her usual Credit card spending. Two days later she was informed that 
her driving licence had been withdrawn. All she could get from the Licencecentre was that she must write in, but she must in any case return the licencewithin 14 days or risk prosecution. The next time she saw Morrisey shecomplained to him about her Bank Account and the Credit Card, so he said thathe would help her out by giving her some money until things were sorted out.
The following week when she arrived in work a brown envelope. A total bomb 
shell. Her post of Office Manager had been abolished and she was thereforenow returned to the post of Clerk. She hadn't been a Clerk, she came 
appointed to the job of Office manager, what did they mean 'returned' ?. She 
could get nothing from Personnel, they just fobbed her off with tosh about"departmental matters". She went and knocked on Abram's door. He was not 



there. Margery called her over "Have you made an appointment ?". No she 
had not. The earliest was Tuesday afternoon next week. She made an 
appointment. Abram was in all the rest of the day, and all of Friday. 

It was obvious that many in the department had enjoyed Susan discomfiture.
But now he had the balance right it was time introduce a colder more focusedattitude. He did not want to start with Susan. Jarrold had suggested that, buthe had objected, pointing out that they could not make the point with a near 
outcast. It had to be a girl well liked and respected by her fellows. He started 
handing out warnings to five of the most sociable women in the departmentregarding their time keeping, chattering, attitude etc. Some would pay heed, 
but he wanted one who paid little or no attention. It turned out to be Lynne, 
after 2 warnings she still talked all day. As the other women came under 
pressure to get more work done she was starting to annoy them. It would be 
Lynne. Aged 23, Five foot five with black hair to her shoulders and a goodfigure, and of course a mouth, a mouth that never stopped. She was an 
attractive girl but that would only make duty a pleasure not a burden. Lynne 
was assigned, and it was clear that her Guardian followed procedure. Abram 
had watched as the trousers and dull tops were replaced by neat short skirtsand pretty blouses. He could see from the lines under her clothes that she now 
wore little thongs and flimsy cleavage brassieres. The trainers had given way 
to high heels, and she usually wore makeup. He wondered if her Guardian had 
beaten her. It was a thought. He could not ask himself but Jarrold knew the 
man and asked him. No he had not, but feel free was the answer. 

Lynne was summoned to Mr Jarrold's office at 6pm the following Friday night.
She guessed it was something to do with the warnings about chattering. She 
hoped and prayed she would not be sacked. If she was her Guardian would be 
furious and he had told her what would happen if he ever caught her being disobedient. 
She did not want to be sacked. Abram came into the room justbehind her, he heard Jarrold list the warnings about chattering, then he told hershe was to be caned. She was so relieved that she was not being sacked shedidn't even raise a murmur, and when he told her to take off her skirt she did 
so immediately. There was a bit of a pause when he told her to take her topsoff, but off they came. Jarrold told her to put her hands on her shoulderswhich she did, then he went back to the report he was reading. Abram was in 
a bit of a reverie watching the show as she stripped, and she was worthwatching. Then he went got the horse out of the cupboard and set it up, helaid out the cane on the nearby low table. He turned to Lynne who was 
watching him with mounting horror. When Jarrold had said "caned" she had 
assumed a bit of a spanking, a slightly sore bottom and all soon forgotten. This 
looked terrifyingly serious and not what she had expected. He picked up the 
cane and beckoned to her. It was too late to argue, much to late to fight. He 
was powerfully built and 6' tall, what could she hope to achieve ? She did asshe was told. 

He used the cane to show her where to kneel. She wanted to talk to him, to 
ask him, but she saw no welcome in his face and did not dare. He dropped abar behind her knees and slipped a loop over her lower legs, told her to put herbelly on the bar of the horse. He put a wide belt over her waist and tightenedit hard, then he pulled each of her hands behind her back and using the wriststraps on it secured them to the belt. If she allowed herself to drape over the 



horse with her hair on floor the front edge cut painfully into her stomach, butkeeping her horizontal meant that the bar behind her knees cut into her thighs.
The dilema was resolved for her when Abram told her to keep her bodyhorizontal and her chin up. In this position with her weight throwing her thighsagainst the board, she could do little more than wiggle bottom a bit, shecertainly couldn't move out of the way or mitigate the force of the blows shewas about to receive. Her breasts dangled below her in a most blatant display.
She had rather expected Abram to give them a quick squeeze. It would have 
been reassuring. But he hadn't. 

"I will give you six strokes. You must stay in that position to receive them, ifyou move, the previous stroke won't count, nor any others until you are backhorizontal with your chin up. You must not speak or make unnecessary noise, 
or I will make you wish you had kept quiet". That was that then, no way todisarm with her femininity, she would have to take what was coming. She 
heard him swish the cane, then she heard it swish again, then a pause, thelittle touch of the cane of buttocks made her jump as he measured his stroke.
The she heard it, a loud swish split seconds before it bit into her soft flesh, sheuttered an involuntary stifled howl and a yelp. She had had no idea how 
incredibly painful it was going to be, far far worse than she had imagined. It 
stung, it stung more than anything she had ever known, and that was just thefirst. She was already crying, and heard herself whimper as she waited for thesecond stroke. In fact Abrams had not hit her very hard. It was meant to hurt, 
to make her understand her true situation, but he did not want to damage her,
nor was he setting out to break her; he wanted force her into the conclusionthat she would prefer to compromise and placate him than to resist. Above all 
she must be beaten until she decided not to resist. Another loud swish, this 
time she automatically tried escape the blow by flattening her thighs againstthe board. Quite futile of course; the frame was designed to hold a womanfirmly in place while she is beaten, and it did its job par excellence. She 
howled more freely this time, she was no longer concerned with her dignity,
the fear of the strokes still to come filled her mind, and whimpered with withthe burning pain in her bottom. 

For her the thrashing seemed interminable, she did not lose count, she wasdreadfully aware of how many she had had, and how many were to come. In 
fact Abram silently counted off 10 seconds after each stroke, so the wholebeating only less than a minute. The first stripe was already ready a doubleline of red and purple just above her pussy, the next three welts, livid redbruises across the bottom of her buttocks and the top her thighs. The last 
stretched an inch below her pussy, laid on firmly to the top of her thigh backs.
The sensitive skin there is particularly vulnerable to the agonies the cane, andshe nearly screamed at the last strokes, self control now lost. What had 
started as something terribly painful, had got worse with each stoke as thecane moved onto more and more sensitive skin, so that after each stroke her 
whimpering and terror of the next stroke came from deeper inside her so thatshe could not bear her own fear of how bad it would be. With each stroke he 
had taken two steps forward, bringing the cane down hard and fast so itswished and making sure he put some of the strength of his arm into it and thecane hit her. But not too hard, it must hurt, and hurt badly, but she should not 
be damaged. That would never do. After the first two strokes he realized that 
the buttock furthest from him was taking by far the most punishment, so he 



evened this up by making sure the cane landed first on the one nearest him.
The marks were still not symmetrical, but it was better. Never having done thisbefore he was surprised that each blow made a double red line on her flesh.
He didn't know why, and was curious that it did. He watched the writhing andrippling of her bottom as she contorted with the pain from the blows. He was 
amused to note that one of them almost certainly caught the lips of her pussy.
He reflected that it was probably not the first time she had had a sore pussy,
but she probably never got one this way before. But she never let her bodyleave the horizontal, she never let her head droop � she did not want to findthat a stroke 'did not count'. She obeyed him, even in her suffering. The whole 
thing gave him an intensely enjoyable feeling of power. He reflected later that 
power was not of much value unless you could use it to control women. 

The six strokes finished, Abram put the cane down. He knew that to become 
Guardian, these days you had to go to Guardian School where amongst otherthings you were taught how to discipline a woman. He had had no such 
training, but he felt that his first effort had gone well enough so far. He had 
certainly learned a lot. Now for the second phase, where this woman,
resistance shattered, would have to show her submissiveness and obedience, 
or she would get some more. She would never risk that, so he would have the 
pleasure of making her serve his slightest whim for the rest of the evening,
desperate to please him, desperate to avoid even the slightest offence. 

After he released her, on his command she hurried to fold up the horse and putit away, afraid that her clumsiness in releasing the catches and making it folddown would be siezed upon as a reason for further correction. She hung up thecane, exactly as she was told, being careful not to in way touch the handle,
that was there only for those in authority over her to use, she touched onlythose parts used to make her suffer. She folded up her clothes into a neat pile;
there was no suggestion that she should put them back on and she alreadyknew better than to ask. After each task she had to stand at attention and wait 
for next instruction, immediately scurrying to obey the moment she had beentold. Finally she was sent to make a tray of coffee. At last she had a moment 
out of sight where she could tenderly rub her painful bottom. She felt the lines 
and stripes and wondered what it would look like, whether she waspermanently marked. She didn't know. In a moment of rage she thought oftaking the boiling kettle and pouring it on them, of throwing the coffee in theirfaces, but she she couldn't. How could she ? They were bigger, stronger, moreused to violence, and she knew the retribution would be truly terrible if she didany such thing. So she did nothing, and meekly the carried the tray out tothem, suddenly once again very conscious of her near nakedness, of their eyesupon her, of their considering glances, of this novel intimacy they had of her.
She poured the two coffees - she had not of course made one for herself, andwhen she took the second one to Mr Abram, he didn't take it from her, but left 
standing before him bent over proffering the coffee, waiting obediently. She 
dared not move, she dared not question, all she could do was wait. Yes, he 
reflected, she would get used to waiting, she would get used to obedience.
�Smile !�, and so, knowing that she must, she did. A fixed and rather twisted 
smile, but it was smile as directed. And so she stood, naked and ignored,
bending over holding the saucer with a silly smile on her face while theycontinued their discussion. 



As the meeting finished, she was allowed to put her clothes back on. Mr Jarrold 
said �I hope you have learned your lesson� to her on his way out the door.
Abram waited and then told her that he would expect to see her in his office at9.00am sharp tomorrow morning when he would discuss her behaviour and itsimprovement now that she understood her position. Improvement in her 
behaviour ? What did he mean by that ? She would know soon enough. 

Chapter Six 

Abram thought about Lynne on his drive home. Some time soon he would fuck 
her, but later, when she had been sufficiently knocked about and afraid of himthat she would not dream of saying no, and only worry that he should besufficiently pleased with her performance. Thinking about it, he realized shemust know that he would have her sooner or later, and a constant undercurrent 
when she was in his presence would be her fear and anticipation that at anymoment it might be now. He would regularly make her show him what she waswearing, all of it, to check it was to his liking, he would make her stand close tohim so she felt his physical presence, deny her her own space and make herstand in his space, make her stand submissively waiting for his orders, hewould make her run errands for him. He would put his hand up her skirt andfondle her while she waited obediently, and eventually when the time was ripe,
he would have her. He had discovered that it was frowned upon for Guardiansto have sex with their charges, unless the woman was a whore, but for anemployer it was perfectly alright. He was paying for her time, and what he gother to do in that time was his affair. Hard work, sex and beatings was a 
perfectly acceptable program. 

The following Monday, Lynne presented herself as she had been told, andAbram spelled out to her that from know on she must wear very short skirts, 4�
heels, little lacy thongs with matching brassieres that did not fully cover hernipples, thin clinging tops. She was also not allowed to wear stockings or 
tights. He told her someone would inspect her frequently (who shewondered ?), and if they reported any departure from the rules he had setdown she could expect a worse thrashing. Other men, running otherdepartments, were issuing different instructions, suited to their own different 
tastes. In a few months as the new regime asserted itself throughout theoffice, you could tell where a woman worked simply from the way she wasdressed. Lacking a way to resist, the women did what they were told and gotused to it. Lynne wondered what she would do about her bare legs in the 
winter. She would freeze with so little clothing. 

The women in the department noted the change immediately in Lynne andthey assumed that some family tragedy had upset her. She would not talk 
about it. Her Guardian had impressed upon her most forcibly that she mustnot, and if he found out that she had he would deal with her severely. Relationsbetween a woman and the men in authority over her were the matters of thestrictest confidence that must not be discussed with others, apparently. Of 
course her best friend eventually wheedled it out of her, and the story wentround the department in a flash. Fearful whispered confidences, sotto voce 
discussions of what this meant. How terrible for Lynne, but more to the point, 
can they do this ? Can they do this to the rest of us ? Can they do this to me ? 



Susan hardly noticed the secretive conferences, and no one told her anything.
She had for years placed herself apart from the other women, and none ofthem were going to risk telling her something dangerous which they felt surethey were not supposed to know. She only noticed that Lynne no longer talkedall day, in fact, that she didn't talk at all. Two weeks later she was late again.
Her daughter threw a temper tantrum over breakfast, she missed the bus, thenext one was full, she arrived in work 20 minutes late. Margery nearly laughed 
at her when she gave her the Attendance Book to sign. As soon as Susan went 
to her desk she prepared a Memo for Mr Abram. 

When Abram saw the memo he rang Jarrold right away and the two menagreed it was time for Susan to be put firmly in her place. To �improve 
efficiency� none of the women had phones any longer. When he wanted to 
speak to them he would call Margery, or put his head round the door and shoutfor them, if they didn't hurry he would shout at them � watch them scurry fromtheir desk to his office. Heads down, for they were all afraid of him now, heelsclacking and breasts jiggling with the half run. He shouted for Susan, watched 
her as she walked to him. She was not afraid, wondered why the others were,
she walked calmly to him without running, determined not to let herself bebullied. He checked the shoes, and as she walked past him he checked thelines of underwear. High summer, so no stockings or tights to complicate 
things. Perish the thought that a disciplinary session should start confrontedby giant floral knickers or something equally hideous. He saw the lines, it 
would do, soon she would learn, and it would be better. He sat down, leavingher standing, told her that Mr Jarrold wanted to see her at 6pm to discuss herAttendance record. Still smarting from her failed application, she could notbring herself to try and discuss this morning's disasters with this man, seek hissympathy, so she said nothing and waited. He looked at her quizically, thenraised an eyebrow, eventually she said �Thank you sir.� He told her to go backto her desk. 

Given the rest of the day to think about it, Susan decided she was to get aformal warning. It was quite good actually. That should be Abram's job andclearly he was not sufficiently trusted to undertake all aspects of department 
management. She planned to make a profuse and feminine apology to Jarroldand then try to start some kind of discussion about the running of thedepartment. They had had long enough to see what Abram was like, andclearly they had come to the obvious conclusion and were gently takingresponsibilities away from him. The more she thought, the more it becameobvious to her that this was a definite opportunity. By mid afternoon she was 
distinctly looking forward to it. 

At the stroke of 6 she knocked on Jarrold's door. �Come in !�, she walked in all 
meek and every inch the little woman, ready to make her carefully preparedmeasured apology. Susan was not very good apologizing, it was not somethingshe did, so what she had prepared which seemed to her entirely over top, butwould have struck Jarrold, had he heard it as so much weasel words, so hungabout with so many caveats as to be no apology at all. But he didn't hear it. 
She walked up to his desk and he started, �Your attendance record isappalling !�,
�I know sir, I wanted to ..�. 



�Shut up ! I was talking. You will speak when you are told to !�
He went on to explain that the only way to deal with idle, insolent women likeher was to thrash some manners into them, and that she was going to becaned. He told her to take her skirt off. She was completely stunned by whatshe heard, it took a few moments to register before she gathered her wits andshouted �I beg your pardon ! I certainly will not ! I will see my Solicitor in 
morning !�, and turned ready to storm out. As she did she saw Abram come 
through the door and lock it behind him, removing the key. In that instant she 
became afraid. Lacking anything else to do she marched up to the door andtried to open it, the she marched up to Abram and shouted in his face �Give methe key !�. He slapped her, he slapped her so hard that she was knocked 
sideways. Jarrold watched from his desk, he had waited a long time time forthis and he did intend to miss any of the show. He wondered how Abram would 
get on, she was turning out a real harridan, what a pleasure to watch him tameher ! 

Susan straightened up, uncertain what to do next. She turned towards Jarrold 
and started to walk, but Abrams stepped forward, reached round her, and inone smooth move pulled the lapels of her jacket over her shoulder and yankedthe sleeves down her arms so that her arms were pinioned behind her back ashe twisted the collar of the jacket to tighten her arms together. He then 
marched her to the back of one of the chairs round the coffee table and bent 
her over it. She intended to fight him, she tried to kick him, but he was entirely 
unmoved. She could not believe how strong he was. It was so long she hadspent time with a man that she had forgotten how much stronger than her they 
were. She wriggled and tried to free herself, she started to threaten him, buthe just slapped her again until she was silent. She realized she was crying, andthat she must not cry, she must fight back, surely with determination she couldovercome this, she must assert herself. But how ? 

Abram reached behind his back for a pair of handcuffs he had clipped to hisbelt, then pulling the right sleeve of her jacket off he cuffed her right hand,
then he did the same for her left, leaving her hands cuffed behind her back andthe jacket on the floor. For her this was an important point, a line crossed, andshe wanted to pause and think about it, but there was no pause. Taking a gripon the short chain between the two cuffs he yanked her arms high in the airwith his right hand, dragging her off the chair back. She let out a yowl, so heslapped her again with his left hand, then taking hold of her left ear bent downof said quietly in a measured tone �Shut up you silly little bitch�. He then 
propelled her across the room by her ear and her raised arms to where therewere some coat hooks on the wall behind the door, one with a dog leadhanging from it. He clipped the lead to her handcuffs, put it over the coathanger, pulled it up tight so that she was standing out of her heels to save thepain in her arms, and tied it off. He stepped back to look at her, bent double,
her head down near her knees, hair falling in her face, gently sobbing. She had 
given up all resistance now, she said nothing, not wanting another slap, sophysically confused she was unable to think her way forward. He slid the 
zipper at the back of her skirt down, undid the waistband, and taking a firmhold of both sides of the hem of the skirt tugged it down. It wasn't designed tocome off with her bent double like that, but he had the strength to force it. She 
tried to kick him again at this new assault, �Try that again and I will knock yourlegs from under you� he told her. She thought about what that would mean, 



dangling from her tortured arms whilst her feet would scrabble to support her.
She didn't try to kick him again. He looked at her black lacy panties, quitepretty, covering half the buttock, too much, although not a disaster, notsomething he couldn't deal with. He wanted to leave her with something overher pussy � he knew Jarrold liked that � and it gave him the opportunity tolecture her about 'modesty', when she was almost naked. 

Now that her skirt was off Susan expected that one of them would start caningher. She wondered how much it would hurt, how many times they would hit 
her. She got a shock as Abram reach round her from the back and startedunbuttoning her blouse. His hands brushed against her tits, not deliberately,
but not trying to avoid them either. He pulled the blouse away from her body,
then undid the wrist buttons, then before she had the chance to ponder thatthis was the inevitable next step, she felt him undo her brassiere and pull itover head. Undoing each cuff in turn, and then resecuring it, he removed herblouse and brassiere each arm as he twisted it. Her breasts dangled free andnaked, she was now wearing nothing but her panties. He reached under her 
and took hold of her left tit cupping it and firmly gripping the nipple. He let the 
weight of the tit rest in his hand, then twisted the nipple, let go and slappedthe breast so it swung and jiggled. �Nice big titties aren't they ?� he remarked 
casually to Jarrold. She couldn't see it, being bent double, but Jarrold grinned 
and nodded. He liked large curvaceous shapely breasts, especially on womenwho have to do as they are told. 

Abram strolled over to the cupboard and got out the cane, laid on the table,
where she could just see. She could not take her eyes off it, for all that she 
had to twist to see it. Thin, oiled, 4 foot long with a braid handle convenient to 
a man's hand. Slender and malevolent looking, she tried to stop herselfthinking about what it could do, would do. She looked at the handle, then 
realized that would not concern her, and she could resist looking at the browntapering end, end part that would hit her, that would hurt her, that would makeher howl. He went back to the cupboard, and brought out the horse, folded itout, laid out the straps to be neat and positioned conveniently for use. Then he 
fetched her, making her yelp as he raised her arms even higher to unclip thedog lead, then propelling her by the ear across the floor to horse, her breastsfree and dangling, slapping together. She was sweating now, and very afraid,
every step in the process had frightened her more as it became obvious howwell organized, determined, and serious the whole process was, with its onlypurpose to hurt and humiliate her. When they got to the horse he simply usedhis weight to force her waist down onto the bar and secured her with the wide 
strap. Using the wrist straps he bound her hands tight to the belt so that shecould not move them, then using the winder tightened up the belt until it kepther very firmly in place. Now all possibility of resistance was gone, she wascaught naked and tied down, almost ready for beating. He caught legs and putthe loop of chain over her lower calf; the horse stopped her bringing her legsforward, so she move them, but not much. Then he sat on her lower legs,
flattening them and dropped the bar behind her knees to keep her thighs firmlyin place, sloped at 30 degrees, fixed and waiting to be beaten. 

With Susan fixed in place � she had said nothing since her initial outburstsbecause she was fearful of another of his slaps � he took a pair of scissors fromJarrold's desk and proceeded to cut away the material of her panties that 



covered the cheeks of her bottom. Whether they would stay up now he didn'tcare; he leaned over and told her that he was leaving her panties on the�preserve her modesty�, because after all, �we don't want you indecentlyputting your pussy on view�. Modesty is so important in a woman, especially 
when she is being thrashed. Susan had stopped worrying about all these littlehumiliations, she now knew what was going to happen, and she had and inklingof how much it was going to hurt, and that was really the only thing thatconcerned her. 

There was a pause, she waited, then he said �I will give you six for persistentlateness�. She wanted to shout �Persistent ! But it was only once�. But then 
was it only once ? She was only 20 minutes late once, but she had been 5minutes late several times. He told her to keep her body hoizontal and herhead up, she felt him bunch her long hair behind her neck and tie it with aribbon. Then a stepped back, picked up the cane, flexed it and measured it onher buttocks. The touch made her bottom muscles twitch from her fear, then 
he lifted it and brought it down with considerable force for the first stroke. A 
ring smack of bamboo against bare womanflesh, closely followed by a loud yelpfrom Susan. Counting 10 seconds off between each stroke he laid them on herto make ladder of purple double stripes down her bottom, each stripedeveloping and become more livid as the seconds passed. He hit her harder 
than he had hit Lynne and he wanted to make sure that it really, really hurt.
After the second stroke she was whimpering between the blows, after the thirdshe howled at each stroke as she bucked and wriggled trying to escape. It did 
her no good whatsoever, she could move a little bit, but not enough to saveherself. Pressing her thighs into the horse to escape some of the violence ofeach blow made no difference either. He would beat her as pleased and make 
her suffer as he thought best. 

Jarrold had moved to the chairs round the coffee table and watched this whole 
performance with engaged detachment. He was glad to see Abram making agood job of her, it was clear that very much of this would soon teach herobedience and humility, and he didn't mind how much she got, so long as shelearned to behave. 

Susan sobbed to herself as Abram lent down beside her, stroking her hair andwhispering in her ear. Talking gently as if to a nervous horse while she criedand snivelled, breaking out into an occasional wail for the soreness of herbottom and the loss of so much dignity and so many certainties. He gentlyexplained that she had brought it all on herself and if she had just behaved asshe should then none of this would have happened. He told her to thank him 
for correcting her and showing her the error of her ways, and she, contrite anddesperately anxious to escape this awful place thanked him as she was told.
�That's good� he said, �that's very good, but also have to deal with thefighting. You have to be punished for that too�. She thought that she had keptherself quiet and borne this new indignity with fortitude, but in fact she wailedand sobbed in her misery as she realized there was more to come. �Now the 
fighting this evening. I will not allow that, it was a most serious offence and it 
absolutely must be punished. I will give you ten for it (another wail from her)
and as I beat you, you can ponder how you should have behaved. You must 
learn to be obedient and feminine, to be deferential towards men and anyoneelse above you in the office. Always. When you are not you will find yourself 



strapped here waiting for the whistle of my cane to remind you of what isrequired�. All of this whispered while he delicately stroked her hair, she tooafraid of angering him to try to move her head away from his horrid touch, toofrightened to speak or argue against him, lost in her misery that she was tohave a further beating. 

Her second thrashing took over two minutes, with her bucking and howling andwhimpering throughout, alternating between sobbing acceptance anddesperate efforts to break free of her constraints and strapping. Quite futile, 
she was held firmly in place; but worse, she had dropped from the horizontalbetween her beatings, so the first stroke didn't count, and during one of herattempts to break free she lowered her head. She got another one for that as 
well. But eventually it was over, and she was released from the bars andstraps, told to go and face the wall, with her hands on her shoulders standingat attention, and to raise her right hand when she had stopped crying. Abram 
warned her that she would get five minutes by the clock to compose herself orshe would get another dose, �And I had better not hear a sound from youeither !�. She stood there suffocating her sobs for some minutes whilst Jarroldand Abram continued their discussion. She struggled to control her tears, toget herself calm before the five minutes was up. The thought of morepunishment was intolerable and she had no means of seeing the time, everytime the tears flooded back she dreaded being told her time was up and shemust submit again. She understood now that she could not defy them � so shehad stood as she was told, said nothing, as quiet as a sobbing woman can be,
knowing that only obedience could help defend her from another thrashing.
Finally, when she felt that perhaps she restrain her tears now, still facing thewall, she put her hand up. 

�Come here !� from Abram. As she walked towards him he barked at her to puther hands back on her shoulders, which she immediately did, suddenlyfrightened again by her inadvertent disobedience. He told her to make coffee 
for them, and as she walked toward the kitchenette she was told curtly to run.
So she ran, hands on shoulders with breasts bouncing, her bright red purplestriped bottom quivering and wiggling as she clattered along in her heels. She 
made a jug of coffee, laid the two cups on the tray, the milk jug. The briefest 
examination of her buttocks with the tips of her fingers had confirmed theirextreme sensitivity and detected the ridging from the stripes on her, but shehad not dwelt on it, fearful that any dawdling would be detected and makethem angry. She walked out carrying the tray, but as she went to place it onthe coffee table she was told sharply to put the coffee things on the table, notthe tray. So she stood there holding the tray with one hand, bending over thetable carefully taking the crockery off it and placing it on the table, tryingdesperately to avoid dropping anything and what might happen if she did. She 
hardly thought of her nakedness and her dangling breasts that shook andjiggled as she worked. Jarrold couldn't take his eyes off them, and Abram justsat there obviously enjoying her discomfort. The tray cleared, she set to pourthe coffee, taking the first to Jarrold, who motioned her to put it on the table,
then for Abram who kept her waiting, bending holding the saucer for him as hehad done with Lynne until he finally motioned her to put it on the table. 

Jarrold said �Come here�, so she started to walk to him, then remembered to 
put her hands on her shoulders and run, in case it was required. As she arrived 



her put his hands on his knees, palms up, and �put them in my hands�. It took 
her a moment before she realized what he meant, and frankly, having her titsfelt, which would have totally outraged her an hour ago, was nothing now if itkept him from getting angry. She found she could not reach down that far, so 
she knelt before him and carefully lowered one tit into each hand, keeping herhands on her shoulders. From when she came out with the coffee she had kepther eyes lowered, too afraid to look them in the eye, wanting not to see thelook on their faces anyway, trying her best to not be there as much as shecould. Putting her breasts into his hands she could not avoid pushing her faceinto his chest and belly. His manly smell filled she nostrils, his clothes, hisaftershave, and the deep primitive smell of his erect penis. She was desperate 
to avoid brushing against it, to avoid encouraging him. She hoped thatfondling would be all that Jarrold would demand, although commonsense toldher she was probably going to be raped. She was nearly shaking, but Jarrolddidn't mind, he just went on feeling her and calmly talking to Abram. He 
opened his hands again �Shake them !�, he commanded, so she had to do herbest to shake her breasts and rub her nipples against his palms. It was difficult 
and tiring with her hands on her shoulders and her arms unable to give any 
help. Then he removed his right hand to stroke her hair, so she now felt herleft breast slapping against his thigh. �Stand up !�, she stood, �Shake them 
again�. She did her best, but rather than an elegant little jiggle, the best shecould manage with her arms up was to make to make them swing violently forside to side. Jarrold seemed to like it. 

Jarrold finished his coffee, said goodnight to Abram, and left. Abram 
supervised her folding the horse and putting it away, taking the crockery out tothe kitchen, giving her a firm bare handed slap on her bottom when she didn'tmove fast enough. Normally they would have stung, but her bruised andbattered skin was so tender that each slap was very painful. Eventually Abramtold her she could dress, and calmly watched her, telling her which garment toselect next. When she picked up her brassiere she was told it was not suitable

� she must leave it behind. Finally he said �Come here�, and she walked up to 
him, not daring to dis-obey. �Closer !�, she stood so close that her breasts 
were nearly touching him through the thin material of her top, She had to 
thank him again for disciplining her, and promise better behaviour for thefuture. Eventually, she was was out of the building, past the knowing smirk ofthe Security Guard, her bottom smarting furiously and the bruising of hermuscles making her walk stiffly. The lining of skirt brushed against the weltson her buttocks, now naked under her skirt where her panties had been cutaway, sending frissons up her back from the tender skin. Every step remindedher of what had been done to her, the burning pain meant she could not forone moment forget what she had received, the physical subservience that she 
had humiliatingly been obliged to offer. She had thought when it was going onthat when she escaped it would be over, but it was not in anyway over, theyhad taken control of her, if only for 40 minutes, but she could never get thattime back she could never re-establish a situation where they had notcontrolled and abused her. She was angry to the point of fury, and through hertears her one thought was for revenge and retribution. She would do 
everything in her power to ensure that they were severely punished. Little did 
she know. 


Chapter Seven 


She went straight to the Police Station, ten minutes walk away. She spoke tothe Desk Sergeant, said she wanted to speak to a WPC to report a very serious 
matter. She knew her rights, knew how the police were supposed to handlethese things. It had been heavily publicized in years gone by. Of course, she 
knew nothing; the recent changes had not been publicized at all, rather theyhad been kept very quiet. The Sergeant was a middle aged man, pastretirement, but kept on because of the shortage of officers, he looked at her,
saw her indignation and dishevelment, and made his own assessment. He 
arranged for her to interviewed by a WPC in a room with no cameras. A goodman, he had stuck his neck out, the proper interview rooms were available buthe could argue he was keeping them free for trouble later in the evening.
What trouble ? There was never any trouble now, but he would claim that oldhabits die hard, and it was only a woman. The WPC ushered Susan into the 
room, got out her notepad and waited. Susan told her she had been beaten, 
severely caned. The WPC asked by who, found out who had done it, who wasthere, if she had a Guardian, if he knew she was here. Susan ran on beginningto vent her anger and outrage until slowly it dawned on her that the WPC wasjust looking at her, writing nothing down, just waiting.
�What is the matter ?� she asked. 
�You cannot report these things without your Guardian's permission. If I take a 
statement he must countersign it before we can use in an investigation or itcan be used in Court. If he hears that you are here without his permission youcould be severely punished�.
�Right� said Susan, �I will go and get his permission straight away�.
�Will you ?� asked the WPC, �I don't think you'll get it�. She knew who Jarrold 
was and she had a vague memory of Morrisey, Susan's Guardian. It was clear 
to her Morrisey would never countersign a statement against Jarrold even if hewanted to, and she doubted that he would want to. 
�Now you listen to me� said the WPC �I want you leave here, forget that youhave ever been here, forget that I have ever spoken to you, or we will both bein very serious trouble. Times have changed, its not like it was. Go and see 
your Guardian and see if he is prepared to do something for you, if he is we canhelp you, otherwise you will just have to put up with it�. She wondered whyshe put herself at risk in this way by help these women, someone would shopher, and when they did, well she tried to avoid thinking about that. Theywalked out past the front desk and she assured the Sergeant that it was notserious after all, she had lost her cat, you know what women are like about that 
etc. She had passed her own Sergeants exams a year ago, but hadn'tmanaged to get promoted. Now she saw that all women officers above the 
rank of Constable had resigned and left the service. Some months ago she hadmet a woman in the High Street who had been an Inspector before sheresigned. She was a shadow of former self, when she asked her why she hadresigned she became confused and defensive and had hurried off. Just after 
that she had been put under a Guardian herself and she began to understandwhat was happening. 

Susan went straight round to see Mr. Morrisey. He greeted her on the doorstep, �What a pleasant surprise to see you here, but you haven't made anappointment�. Her next weekly appointment was after the weekend, she 



pleaded that she needed to speak to him urgently, could she please come in.
�Why ?� he asked, keeping her on the door step.
�It's a problem at work, please I must see you�. Frankly he didn't like her tone,
a woman has no right whatsoever to tell her Guardian that he must do 
anything. He let into the house to her get off the street. He listened while she 
told him an abbreviated account of the evening, with as little salacious detailas she could manage. She was shocked when he said �Show me�. She 
paused, didn't know what to do, then turned around and lifted the back of herskirt a little for him to see. �No, properly, right up, all of it�, so she pulled theskirt right up to her waist, front and back and stood there waiting. She heard 
him get out of his chair, she felt him come close as he examined her wounds.
�Well they have made a proper job you� remarked casually, �but there isnothing I can do about it�. She was stunned by this, in spite of what the WPChad told her, then he went to explain that if he complained she would besacked, as a woman who had complained she would never get another job. He 
would not be able to support her, so she would end up in a Hostel like so manyothers and with her daughter in Care. Even if he did complain, nothing wouldbe done, it would never get to Court, and if it did there would be no conviction.
He didn't like to spell out that the Court would not now disapprove ofreasonable chastisement of women employees. Finally she asked what she 
should do. He advised her to be careful to follow the rules and be obedient, 
don't annoy them. That would be the best way to avoid another beating. He 
went on at length about the importance of keeping her job and how she wouldbe well advised to do everything in her power to make sure she did keep it,
whatever was required of her. 

Chapter Eight 

She went to bed determined not to go work in the morning, but knowing she 
must. The idea that they had the right to do what they had done, and would doit again as and when it pleased them was scarcely credible. Clearly if theycould do that to whenever they chose, they could do anything to her. Her 
neighbour had helpfully looked after her daughter after school and had notpressed for an explanation of her late homecoming. She did not want to go 
back to work, ever. But she knew that she must, that she would. 

The following morning she was early. Margery grinned at her when she gaveher the attendance book, asked her she was looking forward to a sit down afterthe journey in. She had spent the rest of last evening standing up, and hadslept face down. She had stood on the bus in to work, and hadn't thoughtabout the necessity of sitting, but she would indeed have to sit at her desktoday. 

At 10am Abram put his head round his door and shouted for her. As walked 
towards him he shouted at her to hurry up, so she broke into the scurrying halfrun that she had seen all the others do � she did not dare offend him. He sat at 
his desk and told her how she was to dress, the short skirts and thongs, thestrappy high heels and uplift 3/8th cup brassieres that did not fully cover her 
nipples, the thin tight tops. He made himself very clear, her skirts were neverto be more than three inches below her pussy, although she could wear longerskirts until her welts had healed, or when he decided it was cold enough. It 



wasn't until she got home that evening and measured that she fully understoodhow short that was. She was aghast, she owned no skirts that short but it hadbeen made clear to that have to get some, or take the consequences. She set 
work with a needle and thread to recut her most fancy brassieres to leave partof her nipple uncovered. She also had to modify the thongs that went with 
them. He had told her that from the top of her pussy to the top of the thongmust be no more than two inches, she soon realized how tiny that is. She 
wondered who would check, and how. She thought she could guess. 

The following Monday she dressed herself in this strange outfit. Over theweekend she had made each garment separately, but had not tried them all ontogether. She hated the idea, deeply resented having to dress like a whore,
there was no other word for it, and put off the moment as long as she could.
But there was no getting away from it, now it was Monday morning and shemust dress, she must not, definitely not, be late. She found the brassiere gavelittle support to her breasts, well it held them up, but it not hold them in place,
so that when she leaned over her daughter to pour the milk on her breakfastthey swung away from her body, free and very clearly outlined by her tight top.
The thong was no better, so tiny that it had not covered all her pubes. Afraid of 
what might happen if she left it like that she had trimmed the excess hair withscissors to that they were not noticeable. It covered the lips of her pussy, butshe still felt naked and vulnerable, more so than if she had been wearingnothing, as movement kept reminding her of how she was covered, and everydraft of air that went with it reminded her of how little she was covered. 
Dressed like this she would have to take the bus to work ! For the first time 
she wondered how many other women amongst her fellow travelers were beingforced to dress in the same way. Perhaps lots of them. She didn't know. But 
at least it gave her the reassuring thought that she was not alone. When she 
checked in the mirror she found to her surprise that the welts had gone � thatmeant that she would have to wear a short skirt, a very short skirt. The skirt 
was so short that it was almost impossible to sit without men being able to lookup it, look up it and see not just some thigh but the little lacy black thong shewas wearing. She thought about this and decided to take a newspaper to puton her lap on the bus, which was all very well, but what would she do in theoffice ? Oh well, the office is mostly girls and there is nothing I can do about it 
anyway. And so, at 8:10, with her high heels clacking, bare legs flashing in thesunshine, breasts moving and bouncing under her top, she set off for work.
