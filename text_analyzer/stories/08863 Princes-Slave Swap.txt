1. The angry princess
�What is so important that you disturb my breakfast, Chancellor?�
�It&#8217;s your daughter again, Your Majesty.�
�Who has she offended this time?�
�It&#8217;s much worse than anything she&#8217;s done before, Sire. If we&#8217;re not careful, we could have a slave&#8217;s revolt on our hands. She&#8217;s whipped Tina near to death. It&#8217;s a long story. � 
King James&#8217;s face took on a look of total horror. Tina, his favourite slave and a favourite with everyone, whipped by his daughter? �How could that be? We employ a professional whipmaster to whip slaves.�
�The whipmaster is in the infirmary too, Your Majesty.�
�Get yourself a cup of tea George and sit down. We&#8217;ve been friends long enough to do without the formality and I think you&#8217;ll tell the facts better if we talk as equals, as we usually do. Start from the beginning.�
�You know that late last night, our soldiers caught a group from the neighbouring state, infiltrating our boundary. We immediately made slaves of the twelve men and eight women and the soldiers took it as their right to have their sport with them. Princess Elizabeth heard the news too and decided to sneak out of the palace dressed in slave&#8217;s clothing and made her way to the compound where they were being held.�
�After her last escapade, she&#8217;s not allowed out at night.�
�No, hence the subterfuge and clothing. We don&#8217;t know yet how she managed to get past the guard but he assures me he didn&#8217;t fall asleep. She had to sneak through the undergrowth to get near and in doing so, got burdock burrs in her long hair. Two soldiers discovered her and believing her to be a slave offered her some of their homemade vodka and when she became merry, they and several others had their way with her. They all assert she did so willingly and urged them on.�
�And they didn&#8217;t suspect from her talk and manner that she wasn&#8217;t a slave?�
�Seems the vodka dulled their senses too, James. The master of the guard interrogated them earlier and he&#8217;s convinced they are telling the truth. When she arrived back in her bedroom she fell on the bed and dozed off. A maid looked in and decided not to disturb her as she still wore her slave dress. A little before seven, she rang the bell and Tina answered the call and was ordered to remove the burrs from your daughter&#8217;s hair. These had now been in for some hours and were firmly embedded in the hair and almost impossible to remove without causing some pain. Tina tried her best, and we know this because the slave whose dress had been borrowed kept a discrete eye on things in order to get her clothing back, but soon Princess Elizabeth screamed and accused Tina of deliberately pulling her hair to cause her pain. When this happened several times, she put on a cloak and dragged Tina to the whipmaster and ordered him to whip her soundly.�
�He wouldn&#8217;t have caused life threatening injury though.�
�No he didn&#8217;t and witnesses say he didn&#8217;t put the whip on overly hard. She&#8217;d been strung up to the beam as usual and when he&#8217;d given her twenty, told the princess, �That is enough.� In a temper, she snatched the whip from him and started to lash Tina from every angle and when the whipmaster tried to get the whip back, she lashed him across the face and opened a cut right across his cheek, and then continued to lash Tina with all the force she could put behind the whip and opened deep cuts across the poor girl&#8217;s body. Princess Elizabeth didn&#8217;t stop when Tina passed out and when two slaves managed to get under her guard and force the whip from her, she swore at them in a most unseemly way, before returning to her room. The slaves took Tina to the infirmary and the whipmaster too and the nurses are treating her and doing what they can to save her but at this time, they are not sure whether any of her vital organs have been damaged or how badly. She&#8217;s lost an awful lot of blood.�
The two men remained silent for a while, each deep in thought. The king, horrified at his daughter&#8217;s sadistic whipping of the young girl, tried to decide what to do with her but before making a decision, decided to see Tina first. This, although by far the worst of Elizabeth&#8217;s indiscretions, was only the last in a series of misdemeanours that had caused him embarrassment and concern, but what could he now do to curb her wilfulness when all his earlier attempts at taming her had failed? He&#8217;d tried talking to her but any professed repentance barely lasted an hour, something much more drastic needed to be done. But what? �She takes after her mother.� The King reminisced. �I only married her for financial reasons and wasn&#8217;t too unhappy when she died giving birth to Elizabeth. Now what am I to do with my bitch of a daughter?
�George, have a message sent to my daughter that I wish to have words with her in the ante room to my chamber at the eleventh hour this morning.� He paused and saw the look on his friend&#8217;s face before going on, �Yes, I know what you&#8217;re thinking. She&#8217;ll just ignore my request. I&#8217;m sure she will but give her until eleven minutes after the hour and then have the master of the guard send two of his biggest men to her room and to bring her to me, in what ever state of dress she&#8217;s in. Have them manacle her so she realises the depth of my anger. I&#8217;m going to the infirmary now, will you attend after you&#8217;ve given the necessary instructions?�
Tina tried to sit up to greet the king, but he quietly told her to lie still. She couldn&#8217;t even greet him because her voice had given out. For a while he stood and looked in horror at the visible welts and could only imagine those under the blood stained bandages. �What are her chances Nurse Bodwin?� he asked out of Tina&#8217;s earshot.
�About even Sire, I cannot say more than that. There are too many wounds and we must endeavour to prevent them getting infected. We will do what we can to save her but some of it will be in the hands of the Gods.�
�Spare no expense. If you can leave the child in the charge of the others, please come to my ante-room at eleven and enlighten me as to the situation. Let me know immediately if she passes on.�
Turning he addressed the whipmaster and asked him to remove the blood soaked pad he held to his cheek. Clearly he could see the bone and wondered again at the viciousness of his daughter and what to do with her. Clearly she needed a severe punishment, but what? 
One of the nurses stood nearby. �We&#8217;re ready to treat him now, Sire.� When asked what she intended to do, she replied, �We&#8217;ll give him a datura herb drink to put him to sleep and then stitch the wound together and leave it that way until in knits together, much like we do with wounds the soldiers receive.� She sounded confident as if it were a procedure she&#8217;d undertaken many times. The king returned to Tina&#8217;s bedside and sat with her for a while without speaking. Nurses changed the dressings at intervals but he looked on in horror at the deep wounds without commenting on them, instead his mind played with various punishment options until the chancellor arrived.
�I didn&#8217;t believe anyone would do this to another, let alone a girl to another girl. Have you made your mind up yet on what to do, Your Majesty?�
�More or less Chancellor, but much will depend on my interview with Princess Elizabeth later this morning.�
As predicted, Elizabeth arrived manacled and held by two burly men. �Father,� she screamed, �Tell them to release me and have them flogged��
�Silence girl. I ordered them to bring you here in this manner if you ignored my request to attend voluntarily. I&#8217;m sure you know why you are here; Tina and also the whipmaster.�
�She&#8217;s only a slave and he tried to stop me after he&#8217;d soft whipped her.�
�And who owns that slave?�
�You I suppose, but that makes her mine too, even if you take her to your bed.�
�No, her being my property doesn&#8217;t make her yours or give you the right to damage her in such a fearful way. Do you realise she may not live?� 
Elizabeth shrugged as if to say, �Who cares,� and again demanded her release and for the men handling her to be punished.
�Where were you last night Elizabeth?�
�In bed of course.�
�You didn&#8217;t attend the soldiers celebrations and get yourself drunk and allow them to have their way with you?�
�No, who would tell lies like that?�
�Open her legs and examine her womanhood,� the king nodded to the guards. �Would you say that slit had seen some activity recently?�
�Stop this at once!� Elizabeth screamed, �How can you treat your daughter in such a way?�
�Sire, it looks like it has been well and truly fucked and the mess is still dribbling out and much has dried on her thighs,� a guard answered.
�That makes you a liar Elizabeth so now I must believe that you spent the night giving your body freely to the soldiers and afterwards took your sore head temper out on poor Tina.�
Again the &#8216;couldn&#8217;t-care-less&#8217; shrug.
Outwardly the king remained calm but inwardly his mind revolted at his daughter&#8217;s callous attitude. Quietly he ordered, �Take her to the cells and treat her like any other prisoner but order them to keep their pricks in their trousers, although I really don&#8217;t know why after seeing what happened last night.�
�You can&#8217;t do this to me. I&#8217;m your daughter! Father&#8217;s don&#8217;t imprison their daughters in a common jail. You can&#8217;t do this!�
�Take her away. I will convene a court in the throne room at the seventh hour this evening. Have her brought there at that time and, Elizabeth, you had better pray that Tina doesn&#8217;t die before then.�
The room cleared except for the king and the chancellor. �George, I want this court hearing to be as public as possible. Have all the house staff attend, representatives from the military, the overseers, the guards, and a good selection of the slaves. Nurse Bodwin and the whipmaster are to attend and I would have liked Tina to attend too but I fear that is not practicable. Have the two soldiers who supplied the vodka to her last night and the two slaves that took the whip from her this morning brought in, as I will wish to hear their stories. If I&#8217;ve left any group out add them in until the room is full. Leave me until then for I have much to think about and I will wish to visit Tina this afternoon.� 
�
2. Sentenced
The court stood when the king entered dressed in all his regalia. Before sitting he looked around and ordered all the slaves and their overseers, be brought to the front where they could witness the proceedings and when all was to his satisfaction, they brought in the prisoner, still manacled and protesting at her treatment. Out of necessity, they gagged her. In turn the slave whose dress she borrowed, the soldiers, the whipmaster and the two slaves who took the whip from her gave their versions of the events. Finally Nurse Bodwin told the court of Tina&#8217;s still very critical condition and described the thirty-two open wounds and the latticework of welts and ended, �Even if we are successful in keeping her alive, she will bear the scars for the rest of her life.� At that point she broke down and wept.
Finally the king stood to deliver his verdict. �Princess Elizabeth of Veloviastan you are guilty of many crimes but undoubtedly the worst is the unwarranted and sadistic whipping of my slave Tina and causing her permanent damage. At the moment, as the nurse has told us, we cannot be certain as to whether or not she will live and even if she does, she will be in considerable pain for many months. I cannot believe that any woman would do this to another, let alone a daughter of mine. Tradition and laws do not allow the punishment of royalty in a way that is necessary for this crime. Such is my revulsion and anger at the brutality of your crime, that, as of this moment, I disown you, you no longer belong to my family or any other and you will now be taken as one of my slaves and treated as such. I cannot bring myself to order a flogging such as Tina received but I will ask the whipmaster, or his deputy if he is not up to it, to deliver fifty lashes to your body at the seventh hour in the morning.� When the gasps died he turned to the whipmaster, �Sir, you will use your professional competence to deliver the strokes as hard as you can without breaking the flesh, for I wish to consider selling her when the barbarian traders pass this way. I do not wish you to permanently damage one of my slaves.�
A muffled scream came from Elizabeth before she passed out and had to be revived. �Henceforth you will be known as slave Betty. The woman formerly known as Princess Elizabeth no longer exists.� He had to wait again until the murmurs quietened before going on, �To compensate to a very limited extent for the suffering she received, I am setting slave Tina free, more than that, I will take her into my household and she will become the daughter I have lost. I trust the nurses not to lose me a second daughter. Take the prisoner to the cells and allow the guards to use her without restriction, as they do with any prisoner, and have her taken to the whipping room for her punishment before the stated hour. Afterwards treat her like any other slave and administer medical treatment if necessary but make her work in the fields or elsewhere, the following day. She is a slave and must be worked like a slave.�
*****
Betty spent the worst night of her life so far. Screaming and kicking at the guards who virtually carried her to the cells, threw her on the boards that served as her bed, and chained her to the wall. Moments later, the nightdress she hadn&#8217;t been able to change since the guards dragged her to the king that morning, lay in shreds on the floor and the first of the gaolers mounted her. He fucked her hard while his companion regaled the poor girl with tales of what would happen in the morning when they whipped her and how the other slaves would avenge Tina&#8217;s whipping afterwards. He raped her too and brutally mauled her tits then, sated, they left her to contemplate her fate.
Her mind still could not believe her father would disown his own daughter and hoped he would have a change of heart before the morning but with the events of the day, deep down she knew, he would not alter his decision. He wanted her to suffer like that bitch, Tina. It was all her fault. If she hadn&#8217;t tugged at her hair, she wouldn&#8217;t have been whipped and she would still be in her comfortable room and not in this hellhole. Alternately crying and swearing revenge she lay, sleepless on the hard boards. Later, at the change of gaolers, they visited her and fucked her, the second one taking her anally for the first time. She yelled at the pain of his intrusion but was told to get used to it, as many more would take her that way.
When the early morning shift of gaolers came in, they too fucked her before removing the chain and taking her to the slaves&#8217; hall. A little before seven, an overseer fastened her wrist manacles to the rope hanging permanently from a beam and stretched her arms upwards until her feet barely touched the sand. Many slaves and overseers stood around the walls but no dignitaries came to witness her flogging. After all, a mere slave being whipped was a common occurrence and of no concern to them. Betty had no one she could appeal to. Her tears fell.
Precisely at seven, the whipmaster appeared, a dressing on his face and a stout whip in his hand, a longer and thicker one than he&#8217;d used on Tina. Betty knew that even if he didn&#8217;t break the skin, she would suffer terribly. �NO! NO! NO! You&#8217;ll kill me with that. I&#8217;m sorry for hurting you and Tina. Don&#8217;t do this please,� Betty screamed. 
The whipmaster only grinned and slowly uncoiled the whip and cracked it loudly in front of her face. �No I won&#8217;t kill you, but you may wish I had,� he said in a voice distorted by the welt on his face, �You&#8217;ll live and you&#8217;ll suffer, like our Tina is suffering but in your case, no one will care.� Moving to her rear, he laid the whip hard across Betty&#8217;s shoulders, knocking her off balance and eliciting a pitiful scream. A deep red welt appeared but her skin remained intact. At measured intervals the whipping continued until the whole of her back showed a mass of welts from her neck to below her knees. Twice slaves threw water over her to keep her awake but their task became increasingly difficult. In the end, the whipmaster didn&#8217;t wait and worked the whip over the front of her body even though she just hung, lifeless from her wrists. As a princess and therefore royalty, she had never felt the pain of a hand spanking; now they whipped her like a common criminal, but few of the onlookers felt any sympathy for her plight.
Some time later she awoke on a rough bed in the slaves quarters and two slaves rubbed a smelly fat over her raw body and then left her, barely conscious for the rest of the morning while they went about their work. Midday break time and Rocko, an overseer appeared at her bedside and dragged her body until her buttocks lay over the edge. Removing his prick from his breeches, he cruelly fucked her, even when she passed out again.
When next she opened her eyes a female slave was applying fat to her body again, not that it had much effect in reducing the horrendous pain but they anticipated it might keep her muscles moving in order that she could work the next day. In agony and no longer fading into oblivion, Betty tried to find the least painful way to lie, but each and every way, only transferred the worst pain to another place. No one came, no one worried, she could only lie and cry, although her tears dried up and her voice only uttered hoarse sounds. Knowing that they&#8217;d locked the door, she&#8217;d no chance of escaping even if she could move. Her mind cursed herself, cursed the soldiers who gave her the booze, cursed Tina, cursed her father, and everyone she&#8217;d been in contact with, blaming them all for her plight. �What have I done to deserve this? I&#8217;m being made to suffer because of a slave who couldn&#8217;t do her job properly.� Sounds of the door being unlocked distracted her thoughts. Two male slaves entered and half carried her to the slave lavatory block and unceremoniously sat her over one of a series of holes in a wooden bench and then used a nearby trench to piss. Other slaves used the holes or the trench at the same time and laughed and joked amongst themselves. A few made cruel comments on her condition and one forced her mouth open and made her suck his prick until he spent. 
An elderly woman came to her, �We go to eat now, you come with me. You put arm around me and I help.� At first Betty wanted to refuse but knowing she couldn&#8217;t walk properly and not wishing to be left in the lavatory, she did as requested, conscious of her nakedness when the other slaves wore a simple sack dress.
The food, while wholesome, looked unappetising and she didn&#8217;t feel like eating but drank copious amounts of water to replace the fluids she&#8217;d lost through crying. After the meal, some slaves went to the slave hall to chat or play simple games but most, tired after their day&#8217;s work, went to the sleeping quarters to lie down. With no separate accommodation for the sexes, many paired up and openly fucked and two decided to fuck her until her cries at the pain they caused, disturbed the others and eventually they left her alone.
�I put more fat on now. I Zena.� The elderly woman stood by her side, �You try and sleep. We wake early and you must too and we go work.�
Although not treating it as any sort of kindness, Betty realised the woman tried to help her and the only one that had so far.
For the third night in a row, Betty did not sleep. The severe pains and fiery swelling of her flesh, the noises of the other slaves sleeping, snoring or fucking, the hard bed and the uncertainty of her future, all contributed to her being awake at 6 a.m. when the overseers woke everyone. As a small army they headed for the lavatory and jostled to do their ablutions. �Get up you lazy bitch,� an overseer shouted, threatening her with his strap. Stiff and almost unable to move, Betty hobbled out of bed but collapsed before getting to the lavatory building. Two smart strokes of the strap later and she gained her feet and finally made it as the others were leaving. �Zena! Get yourself over here. Get her to piss and shit and into the food hall and be quick about it. She has to work today.� Overseer Rocko shouted his orders and Zena meekly complied.
Having no liking for the food, Betty left it and another slave quickly snatched away to add to his meagre breakfast. In a bad mood, Rocko ushered them to the fields and lashed Betty several times for her slowness but she neither had the will or the ability to move any faster and to save her further punishment a slave carried her. His move wasn&#8217;t altruistic, they had a quota to fill for the day and any delay meant they&#8217;d have to work harder and longer. The back breaking work of potato picking, taxed the strength of the fittest slaves, Betty couldn&#8217;t even hold the sack open for long and collapsed several times when she tried to pick up the potatoes the slaves dug up. Berating and cursing her as being worse than useless, Rocko applied his strap to her back and buttocks at frequent intervals until he finally realised she could not longer feel their effect.
That night, again unable to sleep for the pain, Betty decided she couldn&#8217;t live her whole life as a slave and suffer this torment for years. �I&#8217;ll just fade away and die, that&#8217;s better than living in this hell,� she decided. The hunger pains in her stomach were less than the pains in her body, �I&#8217;ll just pretend to eat that mess they call food and starve myself into oblivion.
Over the next week, she slowly became weaker and even Rocko didn&#8217;t bother trying to make her work although he still lashed her when the opportunity arose. Several times she passed out and once, when he thought she faked unconsciousness, Rocko severely lashed her front. Betty lay unmoving on the earth and many slaves thought she&#8217;d died but dare not go to her. 
All work stopped when a man on horseback arrived and Rocko greeted him deferentially. �Good day to you Master McCulloch. 
McCulloch, the estate manager, ignored the greeting. �Tell them to continue working overseer. How&#8217;s the yield this year?� 
�A little better than expected Sir we had rain��
�Why&#8217;s that slave not working?� McCulloch interrupted, and then noticed who it was and wondered if the king would still have feelings for his daughter or if he&#8217;d really shut her from his mind. �You,� he pointed to a woman, �Is she alive?� Hesitantly the slave put her face to Betty&#8217;s mouth and nodded, �Yes.� �Lift her smock and let me see the state of her.� Horrified at the emaciated, bruised and battered body, he looked around and picked the biggest slave, �You, carry her to the infirmary and tell Nurse Bodwin, Master McCulloch will be in to see her later. Can you remember that?� 
�Yes, Sir.� 
At the infirmary, two of the king&#8217;s bodyguards stopped him. �Who are you slave and what is your business here that you carry that woman?�
�Slave Jacob. Sir, Master McCullock told me to take slave Betty for treatment Sir.�
One of the bodyguards went inside and after a brief wait, slave Jacob and Betty were admitted. The king sat talking with Princess Tina who sat in a chair beside him. Both looked shocked at the sight of the unconscious Betty. �Find out what happened nurse if you please, and have the slave wait. Let me have your opinion on her condition as soon as you can.�
Ten minutes later, Nurse Bodwin returned, �The whip marks of her punishment still show but the skin is not broken but the welts are deep and the flesh heavily bruised. That&#8217;s to be expected from a punishment whipping but they don&#8217;t seem to have been treated since. In addition, there are many, many strap welts overlaying the original whipping, both back and front. Her hands and legs are covered with the sores from poison ivy and she hasn&#8217;t been fed properly has lost a lot of weight so that her ribs are prominent and the strap then hits her bones. She&#8217;ll need a long period of recuperation before she is well enough to work.�
�Bring the slave here, please Nurse.�
Shaking in the presence of the king, Jacob knelt and hesitantly told of her whipping and of the events and strappings she&#8217;d received from Overseer Rocko and said Master McCulloch would be along later to speak with the Nurse.�
Forewarned to expect him, the guards admitted the estate manager immediately he arrived and the king questioned him and afterwards remarked, �Overseer Rocko appears to overstepped his authority and caused further unnecessary damage to my property. Investigate his treatment of this slave and the others and if necessary, dismiss him or commit him for trial and punishment.� Wishing to ingratiate himself with the king, Master McCulloch readily agreed and to also check on Overseer Mavok.
�As an overseer, Mavok isn&#8217;t too bad. His group of slaves is better treated than the one I was in. Rocko is the cruel one unless you are a favourite,� Tina piped up.
�You were a favourite?� the king asked.
�I did what was needed to save my skin, Sire, until they transferred me to the household.�
�Until my ex daughter found you. Are the cuts healing now, it&#8217;s been a couple of days since I saw them.�
Tina shed her light robe, winced as she carefully stood and unashamedly showed the king the terrible scars and scabs that covered her body. �I doubt you or anyone will wish to see my body for a long while, if ever.� Tears again flowed down her face and the though of her permanent scarring.
�Princess Tina, the nurses are doing a good job but even they will not be able to hide all the marks. Be proud of them. It is not your outward beauty that attracts me, but your personality. The bitch, I hope, hasn&#8217;t destroyed that. Smile a little and joke and flirt with me and we will get along fine.�
�What about her? She&#8217;s been badly treated too.� Tina nodded to the curtained bed.
�I don&#8217;t know dear. We will have to wait and see.�
�
3. Sold
The infirmary, with Nurse Bodwin in charge and three nurses on call, dealt with minor injuries and illnesses of the palace staff and for serious injuries to the king&#8217;s slaves. Patients requiring surgery or those from outlying districts, were seen at the hospital, several miles to the other side of town. Four specially trained slaves lived in a room behind the infirmary and kept the place clean and spotless, and even did a little patient care, especially with slave patients. For the most part, except for some aristocratic women, few bothered with privacy and patients on the ward saw each other being treated. As with most clinics, the mornings proved busy and two of the nurses were on duty but for the rest of the day, only one was needed and the others were on call. In this situation, the curtain around Betty&#8217;s bed only remained closed while the king talked with Tina, thus the two women would frequently see each other and notice their injuries. Nurse Bodwin warned against arguments between the two and threatened to send Betty back to the slave quarters if she became abusive; a threat she took seriously. Life was far easier in the infirmary.
For several days, neither girl spoke to the other, even when they passed on the way to the toilet. Tina could now get up and walk a short distance unaided although the nurses took care that she didn&#8217;t do anything to open her wounds. Betty, still suffering badly from external and internal injuries, needed assistance to walk and usually one of the slaves helped her.
A week later, they allowed Tina to go &#8216;home&#8217;, home being the room alongside the king&#8217;s formerly occupied by his wife. Each day, she had to attend the clinic to have her wounds dressed and cleaned but otherwise she could get about and dress, if not with the youthful spirit of a week or two earlier. Now she had a maid, a slave, of her own but treated her more as a companion. 
�Please Nurse Bodwin, don&#8217;t send me back to the slave&#8217;s quarters yet. I still am too sore to work and can barely walk, not run.� The pair heard Betty pleading when they arrived for Tina&#8217;s treatment but the nurse immediately broke off the conversation to attend the king&#8217;s daughter. 
�Can you give her a few more days, Nurse?� I&#8217;ll have a word with his majesty to see if he can arrange something more suited to her ability. If she&#8217;s sent back into the fields, she&#8217;ll be back here again in a few days,� Tina whispered and wishing to keep in favour with the new princess, the nurse agreed.
That night, Tina joined the king in his bed and for the first time since her whipping, they fucked albeit gently and with reserve. Tina&#8217;s friendly spirit and smile had returned and she amused the king before asking about Betty&#8217;s future. 
�What do you suggest?�
�Well, she&#8217;s had more schooling than any of the others, even if she didn&#8217;t make the most of it, so perhaps an office type work.�
*****
�Seems that I&#8217;ve got lumbered with you,� Master McCulloch grumbled when Betty entered his office. �Make sure you&#8217;re here promptly at nine and I&#8217;ve told your overseer to set you light work from six to 8:30 and it&#8217;s not to be cleaning the latrines because I don&#8217;t want to smell disinfectant all day. You&#8217;ll still get the strap from me if you make mistakes and you&#8217;ll have to attend to the needs of my prick when required. Understood?�
�Yes, Sir.�
�You can read and do accounts, so I&#8217;m told.�
�I can read Sir, but I may need further instruction on accounting.�
�Hmm. Despite what the king and his new princess say, if you don&#8217;t work out here, you&#8217;ll be back in the fields. I&#8217;m not putting up with a useless woman in this office. I&#8217;ve done the work myself until now, so I can do it again. Lift your smock and bend over that desk, I&#8217;ve got a hard-on already.� Unceremoniously he thrust into her disregarding any pain he caused, but fortunately for Betty, he didn&#8217;t last long and soon she sat sorting a pile of invoices and correspondence.
�So bitch Tina got me in here, the king wouldn&#8217;t have thought of it. I shouldn&#8217;t be here anyway; I should be in the palace. That&#8217;s my rightful place. I suppose it is easier than fieldwork though, so I&#8217;d better make the effort to keep it until I can find a way back to my proper station in life. Or will I always be a slave?� Betty tried to sort things out in her mind as she piled the papers into order.
*****
�What&#8217;s up with her this time, Big-Tom?�
�I don&#8217;t rightly know nurse. I found her unconscious and tied to a tree in my woodland. She&#8217;s obviously been beaten again and pretty severely too. Several blows to the head and she&#8217;s been well fucked. Someone still has a grudge against her.�
�Put her on the bed and let&#8217;s have a good look.� Gently Big-Tom laid her down. �Looks like all our work of a few weeks ago has been undone. You&#8217;ve no idea who might have done it?�
Big-Tom stayed at her bedside all night and when she woke, gave her water and called the duty nurse, but her speech was to incoherent to understand. The nurse gave her a sedative that sent her to sleep again. 
The next morning, sore and with a bad headache, she tried to sit up in bed and answer the nurse&#8217;s questions. �Can you tell us what happened?� Nurse Bodwin asked. The chief guard stood at her side.
�Master McCulloch sent me with the invoices to the accounts office as usual, just before five o&#8217;clock. I got a lift on the mail cart there but I had to walk back. When I passed the woods, some men I didn&#8217;t see, threw a bag over my head and ripped my smock off. They tied my arms to a tree bough and started punching and beating me with a stick. I think they fucked me too but I wasn&#8217;t conscious by then and I knew nothing more until I woke here.�
*****
�Any leads on who did it Ivan?� the king asked the guard.
�No, your Majesty. No one saw or heard anything. Every slave is so dumb at the moment that I believe they know, or suspect, but are afraid to say. Best to leave it a few days Sire and wait until a few tongues begin to wag. We have our suspicions but we could be a long way off the truth. Rocko seems to be the chief suspect but for the moment we&#8217;ll let them think we&#8217;re not bothered with a slave being beaten up and they might get careless.�
�What do you think we should do Tina?� the king asked when they were alone. Tina thought for a while and made a suggestion that amused the king.
*****
�You wished to see me, Your Majesty,� Big-Tom asked.
�Tom, you&#8217;re a free man and yet you choose to live in the woods outside normal society. You earn a little from your business and we pay you a small wage to maintain the woods for hunting. I&#8217;m told you could earn more but are content to work in the woods and eat with the slaves. You almost live their life.� 
Big-Tom wondered where this was leading. �Is my job as a retainer in jeopardy?� he thought, �Is he about to commandeer the woods that I own?�
�You&#8217;re a big powerful man, respected by slaves and overseers but you&#8217;ve never sort promotion or to get a better house.�
�I&#8217;m a woodsman Sir, as was my father before me.�
�Quite so Tom. How would you like to own a slave Tom?�
Tom smiled, �I could neither afford to buy one or keep one, you know that Sire, so why the question?�
�You brought slave Betty to the infirmary and took care of her and have visited her since. I feel she needs a protector to save her from further beatings, beatings that could end her life. She is a slave in my ownership and I wish to sell her. I could wait until the barbarian traders come but the state she&#8217;s in, I&#8217;d almost have to pay them to take her. Instead, I propose to sell her to you, and before you protest about the cost, the sale price is one week&#8217;s retainer wages and you can use the slave canteen or arrange for foodstuff to be delivered to you and have your slave cook it.� The king paused and went on with a smile, �But you&#8217;ll have to train her first!�
*****
�How is she Nurse?�
�Much improved, she can go back to work shortly seeing she only does light work.�
Betty&#8217;s face fell. Working in the estate office wasn&#8217;t that bad, certainly compared to field work, but now she had the fear of another attack. She doubted she would survive next time. Had Big-Tom not come along when he did and she&#8217;d remained tied to the bough all night, she&#8217;d be dead now.
�Oh, I won&#8217;t be letting her work in that office�� Tom waited and looked at the expressions on faces of both women, �Because she&#8217;s been so much trouble, the King sold her to me. She&#8217;ll be working in the woods and doing my office work and looking after my house and needs. I&#8217;ve got the option of selling her back to the king in three months if she&#8217;s not satisfactory.�
Betty didn&#8217;t know what to think. She knew Big-Tom from the slave canteen but had not had any dealings with him although some slaves tried to get into his working parties. She knew he wasn&#8217;t an overseer as such but he conscripted slaves from the king&#8217;s pool when required for woodland work. Tears came into her eyes when she thought she&#8217;d be forced to doing manual work again as well as being his whore. �I&#8217;ll pick her up after dinner this evening, if that&#8217;s alright with you nurse and you can tell me what needs to be done to get her well again. I&#8217;d better get back to work now.� The fact that he thought of her welfare, cheered Betty a little and with reassurances from the other slaves as to how Big-Tom would treat her if she behaved, she began to feel less fearful until the nurse gossiped about him with Tina when she came to have warm oil rubbed into her body scars. Betty wasn&#8217;t supposed to listen but she did anyway.
�I&#8217;ve never had a slave in here because Tom has whipped him or her and they&#8217;ve needed treatment,� the nurse commented.
�No,� Tina grinned, �With hands his size and the strength of his arms, he doesn&#8217;t need a whip or a strap. I&#8217;ve seen a few raw arses when slaves have tried to defy him or take liberties. He doesn&#8217;t do it often, but when he does, the slave doesn&#8217;t sit well for a week and the bruises take a while to fade but there aren&#8217;t any welts or cuts. It&#8217;s his prick she might feel more. It&#8217;ll certainly stretch her and she will find it painful if her fucks hard. She&#8217;d have to annoy him to do that; usually he&#8217;s pretty gentle particularly with the younger ones.�
�As you well know?�
�Yes,� Tina laughed again, �But I&#8217;ve the only prick I need for the time being, and I&#8217;m able use it properly now these cuts have healed and the skin is becoming less tight. Still some pain when he presses on me but I try to grin and bear it.� The realisation that Tina still suffered from the whipping she&#8217;d given her brought some sense of remorse from Betty but she believed her own whipping more than made up for it and her term of slavery an extra, undeserved, punishment. Although it didn&#8217;t cross her mind, living as a slave, made her more tolerant of their well being and made her ordering a severe whipping an unlikely event, when and if, she ever returned to the royal household.
Big-Tom arrived on the back of the work horse he used for hauling logs and brought a large, thick coat for Betty to wear. �Didn&#8217;t think you&#8217;d walk too well so I brought Jessie. Her broad back will take the two of us with ease, in fact, you&#8217;re so thin that she&#8217;ll hardly notice the difference. Put this coat on. It&#8217;s not much but it&#8217;ll keep out a bit of the chill air.� His face showed considerable concern for her welfare and caused Betty to think back to the last time anyone had done so. She couldn&#8217;t remember when it was, but it must have been during her childhood. �Up you go lass,� Tom easily lifted her on to the mare&#8217;s back and climbed on behind her for the mile or so journey to his hut.
�It&#8217;s not much of a place lass, and I&#8217;ve not kept it like it should be, but with you here, that will change. One of your jobs will be to keep this place clean and neat but I won&#8217;t expect it all done tomorrow. I&#8217;ll want to see some changes though.� 
Betty began to realise that life with Big-Tom, might be better than in the slave houses, but it wouldn&#8217;t be a picnic. At least the wood stove kept the place warm and the bed looked softer than those in the slave dormitory but everywhere she looked, she saw dirt and clutter, clutter she would have to clear and clean. The bed reminded her of Tina&#8217;s remark and wondered if Tom would indeed be careful when he fucked her. So far he&#8217;d been kind, but would that continue when he became used to having a personal slave? One who couldn&#8217;t refuse or complain. She knew she&#8217;d have to take his prick, whatever the size, all slaves did and she&#8217;d had many in her few weeks of slavery, but would he take her gently or fuck her for his own pleasure as most of the overseers and masters did?
As usual with rural houses, the lavatory was a dirt-pit outhouse. Tom showed it to her and the open fronted hut where he stored the wood for the stove. �I cut the wood,� he told her, �But you have to bring it into the house, or at least you will once you are a little stronger. You&#8217;ll also have to learn to cook so that I don&#8217;t have to go to the slave&#8217;s canteen and we can act as though we&#8217;re married.�
�More work,� she thought, �I can see this becoming a worse drudge than before and feeling his hard hand on my arse for not doing things properly.� She became depressed again.
For a while they sat in the lamplight by the stove and talked sporadically but she soon became very tired. �Time I put you to bed lass and for me to have a good look at what I&#8217;ve bought.� Tom undressed her and himself in readiness for bed and stood naked in front of her. �His prick looks bigger than any I&#8217;ve had before and it&#8217;s only semi-erect, but it isn&#8217;t as enormous as the stories made me believe,� she mused. She hoped he&#8217;d take pity on her and not use it that night and in fact, when her saw her tiredness he just cradled her to his breast. In the morning though, they did fuck but did it slowly and gently and he kept his weight off her battered body. Betty actually enjoyed it but didn&#8217;t tell him so.
His work regime started gently too but by the end of a week, she&#8217;d become nearly a full time housewife and the interior of the hut looked tidier and cleaner than it had for several years. Having worked in the estate manager&#8217;s office, she knew the accounting system they used, and having left the piles of papers on Tom&#8217;s desk until last, she started going through them and arranging the invoices and statements in ordered piles before going through his ledger, such as it was. She guessed Tom preferred to be outdoors rather than sitting at a desk and probably only attempted the paperwork during inclement weather. �If I can prove my worth as his clerk, maybe I won&#8217;t have to go out and lift timber and stuff,� she reasoned and her argument became stronger when going through the accounts, she noted considerable sums of money still owing to them. 
�I knew I&#8217;d let things slide a bit, but I had no idea it was this bad,� Tom looked a little ashamed when she pointed it out the bad debts. Can you do reminder notes and I&#8217;ll get one of the guard slaves to go with you to deliver them and when some of the money comes in, I&#8217;ll take you into town and buy a couple of dresses so you look more official and less like a slave.�
A month later, she&#8217;d made the office a full time job and employed an older woman slave to do the housework and some of the cooking. Once a week, dressed in a smart uniform, she did the rounds in a cart driven by a guard slave, and issued invoices, collected money and took further orders, until she became a familiar figure around the Palace area and most people forgot her slave status. Perhaps it wasn&#8217;t surprising that one spring afternoon, she came face-to-face with her biological father and a now pregnant Tina. 
�Good afternoon to you Betty,� the king greeted her cordially and after an exchange of pleasantries and comments on how well she looked, he went on, �I understand that Big-Tom now values you so highly, he would not sell you back to me even for many gold coins.�
�That is true Sire and it may not be long before he frees me from my slavery.� 
�How will he manage without you?� Tina asked, �I hear that because you took over his office, the business has grown and he now has to employ further slaves.�
�That is true Mistress, but I won&#8217;t be free of Tom. He intends to marry me, and stop me taking the herbs so I bear him children, like I see you have.�
�Maybe then we can invite you back into the Palace,� the king suggested.
�No Sire, the office of accounts is as far into this building as I wish to go. Further will bring back memories that are best forgotten. I live a simple but far happier life now, than before. I have sufficient funds to get what I need and a man who looks after me with care and protection. I need nothing more. My suffering will be for naught if I return to palace life. Good afternoon to you Sire and to you too, Mistress.� Bobbing a curtsey, Betty hurried on her way, but couldn&#8217;t help recalling the time when she was Princess Elizabeth, the hated Princess Elizabeth.
