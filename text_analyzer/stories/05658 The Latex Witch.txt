Bliss Alexandra wants power, and will stop at nothing to obtain it, but
will she get what she asks for?

&nbsp;

The Latex Witch

By Darqside

&nbsp;

Bliss was irritated, it had been a
long day at the corporate headquarters in Salem,
 Massachusetts.� Why in the world their business was
headquartered in such a backwater state, she had no idea, but walking among a
bunch of country bumpkins (to her at least) wasn�t even the worst part.

&nbsp;

It was that blasted Glass
Ceiling.� It always got her in the
end.� No matter how professional she was,
no matter how hard she worked, this company refused to
promote her any higher than Vice-Executive Manager.� It wasn�t like she didn�t have a passion for
the job, either, in fact, bossing people around for deadlines
was quite the enjoyable experience for her, at least so she
thought.� She loved to see the men with
pocket protectors and large-rimmed glasses squirm in their cubicles when a
deadline loomed over them. 

&nbsp;

But as with all her previous jobs, this one didn�t satisfy
her.� Not in the very least.� It just felt unsatisfactory. �Not
good enough.

&nbsp;

She knew she could do better, but there had to be something
within her line of interests, something that could spark the flame of desire
broiling inside her.

&nbsp;

To her, business was
sex, if you couldn�t put out, you WERE out.�
It was that simple.� If you were
strong, dedicated, and had a long steady rhythm, you could go places with her.

&nbsp;

Bliss felt like her talents were getting dull, but there was
something else, her coworkers weren�t exactly friendly to her.� She could practically read the word �bitch�
on their silent lips.� It didn�t bother
her though, she liked the idea of being intense for
them.� But the problem was her boss.� If they reported her, it could be bad.� And getting another job isn�t as easy on the Eastern
coast.

&nbsp;

So it was she tried to put on a �smile� that hurt like a
toothache.� But now she was getting weird
stares from everyone, like it just wasn�t natural for her to smile.

&nbsp;

Ugh�so what am I
supposed to do! She nearly screamed it out loud.

&nbsp;

She was getting frustrated, and needed a break.� Luckily, it was lunch break and she could
head out for a bit.

&nbsp;

Driving the company car around town was a nice little perk
to her position, even if it was a minor one.

&nbsp;

The more she thought about her unsatisfactory position, the
more her blood began to boil.� How could
she just sit around and play favors, she wanted more!

&nbsp;

She pulled in front of a local eatery she habitually visited
and decided this would be a nice place to calm her nerves.

&nbsp;

The waiter inside gave her a booth in the non-smoking
section, and gave her a menu.

&nbsp;

This guy seems rather
cute.� She thought as he gregariously
smiled through his work.� She�d been here
several times before, watching him, and learning more about his job.�� He didn�t just serve tables of course, he was also constantly fixing the stove and other
kitchen appliances around the place.� He
had a very rugged appearance, but his every movement spoke �sexy� to her
eyes.� His voice was deep but simple, and
about the only thing she didn�t know about the guy was his name and what he did
after work.

&nbsp;

�So, are you ready to order, Miss Bliss?� the man broke her
out of her reverie.

&nbsp;

For some reason she had a habit of telling people her first
name as if it was her last name, she didn�t know why, it just sounded
interesting.� Besides, the name �Bliss�
just made her feel oh-so-sexy all over, like an obsession.

&nbsp;

�But of course, I�ll have the House Club, thank you.

&nbsp;

�All right, and to drink?�

&nbsp;

�Coffee, please.�

&nbsp;

�As you wish.� He replied with a
wink and a smile.

&nbsp;

It was the first time she noticed this trait in him.� Maybe it was the idea she was attracted to
him or vice-versa, but he had his own little nuances that made her heart
feel�somewhat�

&nbsp;

Nah! He�s just
flirting around! She dismissed it in her head, it
was probably something he did to all the women in the restaurant.

&nbsp;

Still, if he worked at
our office, it would be a little more interesting. She thought to herself.

&nbsp;

Lunch was over far too soon, she realized, and she still had
an hour or so before she needed to get back to work.� She decided to do a little of what she liked
to call �power snooping�, that is to say, she was always looking for
opportunities to increase her potential, or just find another means of
dominating someone.� It felt like such an
intense rush.� That�s when she came
across a strange fetish store down the street.

&nbsp;

When she entered the place, it was relatively empty, meaning
business was slow around her, she�d guessed, but the guy running the shop
didn�t seem to mind.� He wore black
leather all over, and had a shaven head for some reason, but she paid it no
mind.

&nbsp;

Latex wasn�t exactly her thing, but it was interesting as a
venue.� Sex always did calm the nerves,
even if the means was a little weird, so she rationalized.

&nbsp;

The man at the counter noticed his customer, and decided to
be a little more sociable.

&nbsp;

�So miss, are you looking for any Domination gear?�

&nbsp;

�Say what?� she looked back at him quizzically.

&nbsp;

�You know, riding crops, tight stuff, maybe a mouth gag or
two?�� The man replied.

&nbsp;

In fact, she�d never even heard of those things before, but
the word �domination� rang clear as a bell in her mind.

&nbsp;

It was shocking to this man to find out she had never even
heard of Domination and Submission.� A
sexual term for being in control, and being the one controlled.� She liked the former, but the latter was just
as interesting for some reason.

&nbsp;

�Well since you�re new, before you buy anything I think you
should read this pamphlet, it talks about everything you need to know, including
safety precautions, and what you can expect out of a lifestyle like this.� I do hope by reading it, you�ll take an
interest, it�s very satisfying.�� He said
this with a big grin on his face.

&nbsp;

�Well, I have to head back to work, the job�s a prison, and
I�m an escaped convict.�� She smiled at
her own feeble joke.

&nbsp;

�Ooh, sexy situation at the workplace!� Good luck!� he grinned even wider this time.

&nbsp;

She didn�t know exactly what he meant, but the pamphlet was
an interesting read.� But as she was
heading out to the car, a strong wind blew a piece of paper on her windshield,
catching on the wipers.

&nbsp;

She snatched it off and would�ve tossed it in the nearby
bin, but something compelled her to read it.

&nbsp;

It was an advertisement, but nothing she�d ever heard of.

&nbsp;

ARE YOU LOOKING FOR
POWER?

&nbsp;

ARE YOU DISSATISFIED
AT THE WORKPLACE?

&nbsp;

DO YOU WANT MORE OUT
OF YOUR LIFE?

&nbsp;

DO YOU WANT TO
DOMINATE THE COMPETITION?

&nbsp;

DO YOU LIKE THE
MYSTICAL ARTS?

&nbsp;

DO YOU LIKE FETISHES?

&nbsp;

CALL 1-800-WITCH�EM
AND SET UP AN APPOINTMENT,

YOUR LIFE WILL CHANGE
FOREVER.

&nbsp;

�What kind of cheesy tripe is this?!� she practically yelled
out loud, and threw it in the street, only for the wind to blow it back in her
face.

&nbsp;

She wanted to burn the thing, as it was filled with so much
ludicrous nonsense she couldn�t even think straight.� She unceremoniously shoved the paper in the
car and pulled out.

&nbsp;

Her irritation was coming back, just as she entered the
building, but she knew she had a job to do, and this wasn�t the time to let out
frustrations.

&nbsp;

She was typing up some paperwork when one of the lesser
�underlings� of the company called to her, telling her the boss wanted to see
her.

&nbsp;

The boss?� What could he possibly want to see her for?

&nbsp;

As she entered into the office, she gently closed the
door.� When it came to higher-ups, she
had nothing but the utmost respect, even if she was gunning for their
jobs.� In fact, according to that
pamphlet, she was the perfect example of a Submissive.

&nbsp;

No! she shook her head, I
can�t get distracted!

&nbsp;

�Miss Bliss,� her Executive Supervisor began.� Even he referred to her by first name, and
that suited her just fine.� �Have a
seat.�

&nbsp;

She nodded and did so.

&nbsp;

�I�ve finished the monthly performance evaluation and your
work with us is nothing short of stellar, and I have to congratulate you.�

&nbsp;

�Thank you sir�,�

&nbsp;

�However,� he broke her off.�
Uh-oh, here it comes.

&nbsp;

�There�s been a few reports from the staff about your
um�behavior�they say you look �stressed out� or that you�re �trying too hard�.�
He used �finger quotes� to emphasize this.

&nbsp;

�I�m not telling you how you should do your job, in fact, I
completely approve, but I have some concern for the staff.� And if the company has low staff morale, that might lead to other problems, you see.� So I�ve come to a decision.�

&nbsp;

The expression on his face was neither grim nor excited, but
it was intense for her.� She could tell
he was all business, and she liked every second of it.

&nbsp;

�I�m sorry to say this, and it may hurt the company
productivity a little bit, but I�ve decided to effectively put you on �Vacation
Status� effective today.�

&nbsp;

What!?� You can�t be serious! She wanted to yell
out loud.� Even if it hurts company productivity?� Are
you insane?� This is my job!

&nbsp;

�This will be a
paid vacation of course, and you�ll have three months free time all to
yourself.� Maybe you�ll even get a chance
to stretch those beautiful legs of yours!� he sheepishly smiled.

&nbsp;

Did he just say what I
think he said?� Isn�t that sexual
harassment?� Should I sue? Her face
was expressionless.

&nbsp;

�Well, Miss Bliss, I hope you have a Blissful time,
hehe.�� He let her out of the office with
a big smile on his face.

&nbsp;

Oh I will�everything
short of embezzling the company money! She thought, her blood had reached
its limit and her temper was just beginning to peak�but she was all smiles all
the way out the door.

&nbsp;

She could almost hear the cheers and jubilation among the
coworkers as she left the place.� Did
they really hate her that much?

&nbsp;

She walked past the company car, and noticed she�d left the
pamphlet inside, she took it, along with the strange advertisement that made
her angry, and brought them to her own car.�
Her old 86 Toyota Trueno.� It
wasn�t much, but it got around, and it was killer on the corners where she
lived.

&nbsp;

Now she had no power whatsoever, for THREE WHOLE MONTHS and
this infuriated her.� It was like getting
fired, only she didn�t lose money, she was grateful for that at least.

&nbsp;

What should I do now?
She thought to herself, her face doing its best not to furrow into angry
oblivion.� She knew she was attractive,
and she knew it would be oh-so-easy for her to use her feminine wiles to seduce
her way up the corporate ladder.� But
that just didn�t sit well with her.� To
be honest, she was all about dominating the competition, blowing people out of
the water, so to speak.� She wanted them
to grovel at her feet, but now she had three whole months with nobody to order
around.

&nbsp;

�Three whole months,� she sighed.

&nbsp;

Then it dawned on her, �dominate the competition� was a
phrase in that crazy advertisement, something she was into.� And it couldn�t hurt to ask questions,
besides it was a toll-free 800 number.

&nbsp;

All she could think about on the way home was Dominating the Competition.�
And she had three months to find a way to do just that.� There was no way in hell she was going to
simply �relax and take a vacation�.� It
just didn�t suit her.� She was all
business, even when not working.

&nbsp;

She waited till she got home to call the number, she
could�ve just used her cell phone, but she kept reminding herself that that was
for business only, and this she thought wasn�t exactly for the business.

&nbsp;

�1-800-witch�em, eh?� she read the number, �I guess it�s
catchy, but the advertisement needs a little work.� She was, after all, part of
the marketing department where she worked.

&nbsp;

She sat down in her leather chair, crossed her legs with
their pointed heels and leaned back.�
Unlike most women she knew, she loved business suits, and she loved the
heels that went with them, it was her power suit, and she didn�t feel like
taking it off, even if she was at home, even if everyone else thought it was
uncomfortable.� It just gave her that
feeling.

&nbsp;

She dialed the number, only to get a strange old woman�s
voice coming on the other end.

&nbsp;

�Oh-ho, so you�ve got the spine to call after all, eh?� said
the voice on the other end.� �I�ve been
expecting you!�

&nbsp;

�You�ve been�huh??� her eyes went wide in shock as the
mystery voice continued.

&nbsp;

�Scared you, did I?� I
know everything about you, dearie, and I know all about the potential sleeping
inside you!�

&nbsp;

�You�you know me?� was all she could stammer.

&nbsp;

�Dear, I�ve been around the block a few times to know
everyone, I do my homework, and�that advertisement was made specifically for you!� Now, if you don�t mind, I�d like to come over
for a visit.�

&nbsp;

�You�d like to�what?!� she nearly yelled in the phone.� Her temper was finally getting the best of
her.

&nbsp;

�Bliss you silly girl, just put the phone down and answer
the door!�

&nbsp;

Everything happened in such a fast blur Bliss didn�t even
have time to think of the questions she had.

&nbsp;

Bliss was starting to think stress at work really had gotten
to her, but her reasoning never once left her, so it wasn�t a dream was it?

&nbsp;

The doorbell rang, and her nerves practically jumped up to
the ceiling.� But she had to take care of
business, no matter how strange, and answering the
door was all a part of it.

&nbsp;

When she did so, she found an elderly woman in her mid-70s
wearing a simple frock and petty-coat, with a surprisingly long gown and corset,
all dressed in black.� But striking of
all was the material, it was all black latex, not to
mention she wore an incredibly striking pointed hat.� At her side she carried a small riding crop,
for what purpose, Bliss could only guess.��
She also apparently carried a briefcase with her, which made Bliss consider
the idea that this wasn�t just a house-call.

&nbsp;

This woman was all about business, even if her attire was
strange.

&nbsp;

Bliss let her in.

&nbsp;

�Why thank you, Miss Alexandra, you are most kind.� The
elderly woman spoke in high British.

&nbsp;

At the name �Alexandra� Bliss�s back bristled, she hated to
be called anything other than her first name.�
Which was silly, she knew, but it was something about the contrast
between her first name and her last name.�
Those she�d come to dominate could only call her by her first name,
while those who would soon learn she wouldn�t put up with anything, dared to
call her by her last name.� That was just
the way she was.

&nbsp;

�My name is Alexis Troubadour, you
may refer to me only by �Miss Alexis� or �Mistress� for the next three months.� Although you�ll probably be
referring to me by the latter within the next few seconds.�

&nbsp;

How dare you!� This is my home!� And you come here and act like I�m some lowly
servant girl??

&nbsp;

Miss Alexis gave Bliss a single gentle glance and it was all
it took, Bliss melted like butter.

&nbsp;

�Yes, Mistress,� she said on impulse, �I will do as you
instruct me.�� She practically kneeled on
her own doorstep.

&nbsp;

What am I saying?� Who is this old woman, and why am I
submitting to her!� She just looked at
me, why can�t I--?

&nbsp;

�You�re wondering why you�ve lost control, aren�t you,
Bliss?� she practically read Bliss�s mind, �The truth is, I�m a Witch, a very
powerful one�and it is quite simply a form of mind control.� You may have no say in the matter,
however, I�m not here to simply degrade your sensibilities.� I am here as your Instructor.� You called me, remember?�

&nbsp;

�Now come, we have much preparation to do before we begin
the first lesson.� The
beginning of your use of Magic.�

&nbsp;

Bliss shut the door as told.�
It was like she was outside her own body and had no control on what was
said or done.� But everything felt
completely normal, as if nothing had changed.

&nbsp;

Bliss prepared some tea as instructed, then set it in front
of her �Mistress�.

&nbsp;

Mistress Alexis accepted her tea with the utmost
aristocratic grace and poise.� Something
Bliss had no concept of in this day and age.�
It was an old art, and for some strange reason spoke volumes of power.� Power that Bliss now felt needed to be at her
command.� But all the thinking in the world
wouldn�t change her situation or who she was.�
And thinking was all she could do right now.

&nbsp;

�You�re wondering so many things all at once, Bliss, you
must slow down and pace yourself, or you will not make progress as a Latex
Witch.�

&nbsp;

Almost like a miracle, Bliss�s voice and opinion returned,
although her body was rooted to her own chair.

&nbsp;

�You most likely have questions, and it would be most rude
of me not to answer them.� Suffice it to
say, my power orchestrated the events that lead you to calling me, your
vacation, the brochure, and paper advertisement, all of it.� For you see, all of it is necessary for what
we will be doing in the next three months.�
You will be training under my instruction to become a Latex Witch of the
highest caliber.� The reason, you see, is
because I sensed the power sleeping inside you, perhaps handed down from
generation to generation via your mother and your mother�s mother and so
on�passing the blood down to you.� And
you have a very exquisite blood, my dear.�
One of the finest for Black Magic.�

&nbsp;

The only question that came to mind at this point for Bliss, was �What exactly is
a Latex Witch?�

&nbsp;

�Ah, direct and to the point, I see, you will do well under
my instruction if you maintain that attitude.�
In truth, Witches and sorcery have been around for ages, but it was only
up until recently that we discovered Latex material has the ability to increase
one�s own power, this makes it easier to cast spells�this is not without its
negative side, however.� Those who are
inexperienced with Magic can lose control, and even more so in Latex.� So it is, that Latex
Witches are the highest order in the long line of Witches.� You, dear girl, are a natural.� I have sensed it in you, and you will most
likely surpass even my own power soon.�

&nbsp;

�Power?� What kind of power?�

&nbsp;

�Why�the power to dominate, to create and destroy whatever
you wish, Witches are known for a little havoc now and again.� But most of all, you will finally have a
place where you belong, my dear.�

&nbsp;

�A place where I belong?� she repeated the statement like a
parrot. Her mind felt like a blank slate at the moment.� This was truly all hard to grasp.

&nbsp;

�Bliss dear, have you ever had feelings build up inside you
to the point they wanted to burst, or have you ever had feelings and desires
for nothing but power and dominance yet you are somehow able to submit to those
in authority?� Or perhaps you feel what
you do where you work is inadequate for your skill?� These are the feelings of a Witch who has yet
to awaken.� Did you read that pamphlet?�

&nbsp;

She had, but Bliss didn�t know what the BDSM Pamphlet could
possibly have to do with being a Witch.

&nbsp;

�There are many women in the world who have a desire to
dominate or to submit, but there are a select few in this world who are gifted
with the ability to desire both in their heart of hearts.� These are Witches in the truest sense, but
some grow up not knowing the truth and therefore their powers never truly
awaken.� You, my dear, are fortunate to
have me as your Instructor.� For once we
are finished, you will no longer concern yourself with petty things like work
at the office or even that handsome young man at the restaurant.� All that will remain will be your deepest and
darkest obsessions, and those obsessions will be granted, I assure you..�

&nbsp;

At the word �obsessions� Bliss shivered.� This woman knew everything about her, and
probably more than anyone else, even her mother.

&nbsp;

She didn�t know she had it in her, but Bliss managed to
clean the house according to Mistress Alexis� specifications.� Everything was spotless and perfect, better
than Bliss could�ve imagined, and she didn�t even feel slightly winded.

&nbsp;

Is this really the
power of mind control?

&nbsp;

�To answer your question,� Mistress read her thoughts again,
�Once the mind is willing, the body is capable of anything.� You desire power, and nothing less, that is
what motivates you, I merely exploited that facet of your mind and enhanced it
so that you are more capable of following commands and soon you too will know
how to use such a power.�

&nbsp;

When she was finished, Bliss and the Mistress were sitting
in the Living room once again, when Mistress set her briefcase on the
table.� It snapped open, but from what
Bliss could see, there was nothing inside.�
She couldn�t even see the bottom of the briefcase, as hard as she tried.

&nbsp;

When Mistress Alexis reached into the case, she pulled out
what appeared to be a pointed hat with a large set of black jaws and dark eyes
on it, like a face.� It was closed,
however, and motionless like an everyday hat, although it did look like a
Witch�s hat, as it was made of rubber.

&nbsp;

�This will be your new training partner, Laurette.� You may call her Laura or La-la if you wish, she
has no preference.�

&nbsp;

�The hat has a name?�

&nbsp;

�Try her on and see.� Mistress Alexis ignored her question.

&nbsp;

Confused and nervous, Bliss placed the hat on her head.� To her shock the thing came alive and seemed
to hug her head furtively.� She tried to
pull it off, but its grip on her head was incredibly tight.

&nbsp;

�Now-now Bliss, don�t be so rude, you�re her new Host from
now on.� She will be monitoring your Magic
and act as a limiter to help teach you how to improve your skills.� Laurette, I believe it�s time you introduced
yourself, Laurette?�

&nbsp;

A mumbling came from on top Bliss�s head and the strange hat
came to life.

&nbsp;

�As
you command, Mistress.� It said, its voice sounded somewhat awkward,
and for a minute, it sounded just like Bliss�s voice.

&nbsp;

�Oh don�t mind that Bliss, Laurette�s just connecting
herself up to your nervous system and uses your body to speak.� You two have a symbiotic relationship
now.� She cannot come alive without you,
and you cannot perform Magic without her, it is that simple.�

&nbsp;

��I hope you don�t hold it against me, Bliss.� Just think of me as a friend whose closer than a sister.�

&nbsp;

�And if you�re concerned that wearing a hat like Laurette is
going to mess up your hair, don�t be, for she maintains your hair in a perfect
hairstyle to your liking.� Even in strong
winds she will not fall off or even allow your hair to get messy.� She�s even known to fix split ends!� See, even I have a partner like Laurette, her
name is Magestra.�

&nbsp;

As she said this and pointed to her hat, Mistress� hat came
to life.

&nbsp;

�Greetings, Bliss, I
do hope you�ll find it in your heart to accept I and my sister Laurette, we are
considered twins in the spirit realm.�

&nbsp;

�It is �my sister Laurette and I�, Magestra, must we go over
your language lessons again?�

&nbsp;

�Apologies, Madame.�

&nbsp;

Magestra�s voice was nearly identical to Mistress Alexis�
voice, so it sounded like she was having a conversation with herself, much to
Bliss�s shock. 

&nbsp;

�Do not let it bother
you so much, Bliss.� Her hat spoke to her, �It will take some time, but you will get used to hearing my voice
sound as yours, just think of me as your �significant other�.�

&nbsp;

�Now girls, you�ll need to hush now, if we�re going to
instruct Bliss in her first few lessons, but before that she must change, yes?�
Mistress Alexis asked.� At this, both
hats cheered.

&nbsp;

Reaching into her apparently bottomless briefcase, she
pulled out several articles of what appeared to be nothing but black latex
clothing.� Bliss didn�t know what to make
of it, some of it looked very strange, while other
aspects looked like it was simply for frill.�
Since Bliss wore mostly business attire, she didn�t keep track of the
latest fashion trends.

&nbsp;

Mistress Alexis took Bliss to her bedroom and had her strip
of all her clothes, except for Laurette.�
Normally this would�ve irritated and embarrassed Bliss out of her mind,
but something in her mindset told her this was the first step in her progress
to obtain true power.� And because she
felt that way, it just made it all the easier to comply.

&nbsp;

Mistress was nonchalant about seeing Bliss strip, as it
didn�t mean much to her, however, once she handed her the clothes she was to
wear, she had the smallest smile on her face.

&nbsp;

�Put these on first, and I will explain their use.� Mistress
said, handing Bliss a pair of what appeared to be parts of a latex bathing
suit.� They were a two-piece set,
apparently, but something about them looked suspicious, Bliss couldn�t put her
finger on it.� But she put them on
anyway, only to find out both the top and bottom had a set of surprises waiting
for her.

&nbsp;

Almost coming to life, the bottom half of the bikini-like
material formed a strange spike inside her anus and vaginal areas�plugging her solidly.�
She nearly doubled over as the two invaders appeared to plunge deep and
almost connect to one another, effectively preventing the lower portion from
coming off.

&nbsp;

�Normal human beings refer
to those �things� as dildoes, Bliss, although they do not understand the true
nature of them.� You may think you�re
just sexually teasing yourself with those objects embedded in you, but really
you are creating a barrier to prevent Magic from leaking.� Mistress continued,
�A Witch must focus her Magic into the Latex she wears and not through her
body, if she did so, she would lose all control.� This is why you were given Laurette, for she
is your �focus point� to concentrate your magical energies through.

&nbsp;

The panties were tight to be sure, and the dildoes (Bliss
didn�t have any other word to describe them. �Magic Plugs?�) were
deep and solid, and definitely turning her on.

&nbsp;

�You�re wondering if being sexually aroused will keep you
focused on concentrating your Magic?� Don�t be, the �arousal� is the very source of
your Magical Power, Bliss.� It�s that
sensation of arousal that will give you what you need when the time comes to
channel it.�

&nbsp;

Next, Mistress Alexis handed Bliss the latex bra for the
outfit. It had what appeared to be several �bumps� on the inside of the cups,
but what they were for, Bliss had no idea.�
The bra snapped in place, and was snug and tight, but something happened
shortly after that made Bliss moan.� The
strange bra was literally massaging her breasts, and was it her
imagination?� Her breasts were getting bigger, the bra seemed to conform to their shape.

&nbsp;

Her breasts eventually grew to a whole size D-Cup.� Her cleavage was astounding, and her breasts
tingled all over.

&nbsp;

�A woman�s breasts are the second focal outlet for arousal,
Bliss, without this bra, your breasts would not be stimulated and Magic
potential would be wasted.� Also, it
appears that the Magic has already begun to manifest itself in you, Bliss.�

&nbsp;

�How do you mean, and how do I get my breasts to
stop�unh�tingling.�

&nbsp;

�I�m afraid I can�t help you with that, Bliss, you see, your
body has its own way of reacting to its Magical power.�� If your breasts have a tingly sensation and
grow to a large size after putting on that Latex Bra, that�s a sign you have
the potential for unlimited Magic use.�

&nbsp;

�I�m not sure I�eh�follow you.� Bliss was starting to get
ticklish from the bra.

&nbsp;

�I didn�t tell you this before, because I didn�t want you to
be afraid, but once you put on this Latex Bra of Magic, there is no means of
taking it off short of destroying your own Magical powers.� And if your breasts are tingling now, it
means they will continue to tingle for as long as you wear the bra�which may
very well be for the rest of your life as a Latex Witch.� The same goes for your breast size, I�m
afraid.� The over-sensitivity and size of
your breasts will just be something you�ll have to get used to.�

&nbsp;

It was then that Magestra spoke up.� �It�s
been a while since I saw Magic manifest itself like this, Mistress,
she�s full of potential, isn�t she?� The
last time the �breast stimulation magic� happened was over 1500 years ago,
right?�

&nbsp;

�Indeed, the last time it happened, we had a new Grand
Master Witch on our hands.� She may very
well be stemmed from Royal Bloodlines, this one.�

&nbsp;

�T-that�s all well and good, but isn�t there some anti-itch
cream I can use to at least ease the tingles a little?� Bliss practically
begged, her breasts were going to kill her if the
dildoes didn�t.

&nbsp;

�I�m afraid no medicine will help, my dear, the tingles
you�re experiencing come from your own Magic inside you, think of your breasts
as �power generators� for the Magic you have built up.� In truth, the moment you put on that Bra, you
literally cast a spell on yourself without thinking about it, the end result is
natural body stimulation, a talent few Witches can boast for their Magic, I�m
afraid.�

&nbsp;

�So then the�tingles�are�my Magic?� It was getting really
hard to talk for Bliss, she wanted to fuck and fuck something hard.

&nbsp;

�You really think having sex will alleviate this? Don�t be
silly Bliss, you won�t be satisfied no matter how many
times you �do it�.� The only way to
release some of the sensation is to use your Magic, and you barely know how to
do that yet, so just be patient.�

&nbsp;

Bliss was starting to get annoyed with all this �mind
reading� that Mistress Alexis was doing, but it was, to some extent, comforting
to know someone understood the changes going on in her body.

&nbsp;

She was then handed something called a �Magic corset�, the
thing was solid black and thick rubber, and apparently had clamps on the front
and the back.� It looked a little big for
her, but the moment she put it on, Mistress told her to �suck it in�.� The minute she did so, the corset collapsed
and conformed to the very tight curves of her body, accentuating her waist and
hips.� Her shape was incredible, she
realized, and that only turned her on all the more.

&nbsp;

�Looking sexy, acting sexy, being sexy, that is the key to
gaining Magical Power for us, Bliss.�

&nbsp;

Bliss wanted to ask how it was Miss Alexis could look so
elderly and still have magic power, but thought better of it, she could
obviously read her mind so she clamped it shut and thought of nothing else but
the tingling and the clothes and the arousal.

&nbsp;

Mistress Alexis winked at her, �A woman has her secrets, and
I will reveal mine, in time.�

&nbsp;

The corset was definitely tight, making Bliss a slim 20�
creature.

&nbsp;

�Next I have this I want you to wear, these two materials
will be key in conducting material for your skills.�

&nbsp;

She handed Bliss what appeared to be a slick latex body
stocking, along with long opera gloves.�
Both slid on like a charm, but before she could blink, the suit all
merged together to become one piece.�
Like a second skin, she didn�t know where the latex ended and the corset
began!� The only thing left on her that
wasn�t latex was her face.

&nbsp;

�Now Bliss, don�t panic, this was to be expected after your
other recent transformation.� The latex
seems to have taken a liking to you, and by interconnecting itself around your
body, it is confirming its trust in you as a Latex Witch.� You see, Latex, despite what others believe,
is a living thing, it lives and is lithe and moves even when someone else wears
it.� But it�s
true potential will only be revealed when one who uses Magic wears it.� In your case this is doubly true.�

&nbsp;

Bliss was uncomfortable with the idea of Latex encasing her
body without any seams or holes, and the idea that she couldn�t feel anything
underneath wasn�t exactly something she was used to.� But for some reason, her tingles seems to
extend to every part of her body now, and she was starting to understand what
Mistress meant by her power, although her breasts still felt incredibly
stretched and sensitive under all the Latex.

&nbsp;

The next thing her Mistress had her put on were a pair of
incredibly thick Stiletto-Heel Platform Boots, high enough that Bliss needed to
bend her knees just to get through the doorframes in her house, the latex
already reached up to her leg and beyond like some molded hoof. �But it definitely was an additional turn-on,
the shape and balance of the things accentuated her curves and magical bust
nicely.� She could barely walk in the
things, but via mincing steps and the occasional turn of the heel, she could
walk well enough, until she realized the Heels were now fused to her feet as
well.� Then she tripped and fell to the
carpet, the tingles having extended themselves to her toes.

&nbsp;

�Mistress Bliss!� Are you okay?� Laurette her hat called
out.� It was the first time Laurette had
called Bliss her Mistress�and among the other things going on all at once,
Bliss was turned on by this as well.

&nbsp;

But if she was going to get the hang of this �Magical Power�
she�d have to tough out all this arousal nonsense.

&nbsp;

�I�m�.ungh�.fine�I just didn�t expect my legs to give like
that.� Bliss grunted and got back up.

&nbsp;

�It�s not surprising, considering the Latex is now a part of
your body to an extent.� I know this is
all rather fast for you to accept, but this Latex will enhance your power
several times over.� When we finish
you�ll wonder how you even lived without it.�

&nbsp;

I can think of a few
ways I�d live without it. Bliss grumbled in her thoughts, knowing full well
Mistress Alexis heard her.

&nbsp;

�I must admit, Bliss, when I first gained my Latex adornment,
I was just as confused as you�the only difference is, my Latex didn�t take as
much a liking to me as it did you�I am�somewhat envious.�

&nbsp;

Bliss almost felt like laughing, this woman had come into
Bliss�s home and treated her like a little child, and then pretty much forced
her into a suit that liked her too much to let go so she couldn�t even wear
business attire if she tried.� Actually
Bliss felt like crying at how fast her old life was falling apart, until for a
brief moment, the latex suit gave her some minor comfort.

&nbsp;

Aside from Laurette her hat, the suit briefly converted
itself from the tight body and tall stiletto heels to a luxuriously sexy
business power suit, obscene low-cut business cleavage, and skirt revealing her
legs, with sharp black pump latex heels as accessories.� The dildoes were still prominently embedded
in her sphincter and hymen, however, and her still-large breasts tingled like
no tomorrow.

&nbsp;

�Oh my!� I�m stunned beyond words,
you�re already capable of Magic with regards to the suit?� Mistress Alexis
asked.

&nbsp;

�I don�t know�I just�thought about something I like to wear
a lot and�.it happened, although it�s still made out of latex, I guess�I can�t
complain.�

&nbsp;

But the moment her mind drifted, the business suit she wore
converted itself back into it�s solid black shiny
full-bodied stiletto-heeled form.

&nbsp;

�Interesting,� marveled Mistress, �The form of the suit
reacts to your emotions, but the minute you lose focus, it reverts back�I�ve
never witnessed Magic like this before.�

&nbsp;

�I have.� Piped up
Magestra, �This is ancient magic, back
when Latex wasn�t considered material one could use in the Spirit Realm.� Only those with strong concentration can
maintain it though, not to mention cast it in the first place.�

&nbsp;

�Thank you Magestra, you�ve been most informative today.�
Mistress Alexis smiled.

&nbsp;

Mistress continued, �I have three more articles of clothing
I wish to bestow upon you, but, I believe you have a question for me, yes?�

&nbsp;

�Uh�Mistress��

&nbsp;

�Yes, dear?�

&nbsp;

�Will I be able to go to the bathroom like this?� There are no openings or anything!�

&nbsp;

At this Mistress Alexis blushed.

&nbsp;

�Oh my!� Such a silly question�you, my dear girl, are
now capable of many things, so I�m sure you can figure this out by using your
own Magic.� Think of it as a test.�

&nbsp;

At that thought, Bliss frowned in consternation, she hadn�t
the faintest idea of how to solve such a problem, and it didn�t help things
that she had to go�really�really�bad.

&nbsp;

�I�ll give you a hint: remember what you were thinking when
you wore your office attire.� Mistress Alexis smiled.

&nbsp;

Bliss teeter-tottered over to the bathroom
in those ridiculous perma-heels of hers, half blaming Miss Alexis for her
troubles, half blaming herself.

&nbsp;

She was covered from the neck down in solid latex, no holes,
and the holes she used to have were plugged
completely.

&nbsp;

Maybe if I go wherever
it�ll just leak out somewhere�� she bemused.� Then shook her head.


&nbsp;

How un-lady-like.� She wanted Power, and power meant being
distinguished enough that one didn�t take shortcuts, even for such trivial
things as the bathroom.

&nbsp;

Being stuck in Latex was intriguing to her, but it was still
a problem, as to how she would solve it, she only had the Mistress� hint to
think on�

&nbsp;

�Think on�.that�s it!� As if a bolt of inspiration struck
her, Bliss now knew the answer to the riddle, the
trick was getting it to work.

&nbsp;

Deciding she would feel better if she were in the position
to think about such things, she nonchalantly sat on the open toilet seat,
hoping for the best.

&nbsp;

It was a strange sensation having a rubber latex butt on a
smooth slick ceramic seat.� She could
hardly keep herself �lined up� properly, and the pressure from her bladder was
mounting, she had to do something soon.

&nbsp;

She spread her black shiny legs apart, bolstered by those
enormous heels that were so fused to her legs they might as well have been her
feet.� But that was the attractive aspect
of the suit.� No sign of any gaps or
holes where her vagina would be, just a wall of latex and the dildoes stuck up
her rear and box didn�t help either.

&nbsp;

So she wished for two holes, one for each waste producer of
the body.� She thought and thought for
her wishes, focusing on them like they were some mechanism or mathematical
equation.

&nbsp;

Still for a time, nothing happened, but slowly, bit by bit,
just like Magic (it was Magic), the holes in the latex opened to expose her
body, this also alleviated pressure from inside her nether regions once plugged
solid and tight with the dildoes.

&nbsp;

She realized the wish was for the holes to open, but she
didn�t think to keep them open while she alleviated herself.� So it took all her will power just to hold
each hole open while she relieved herself, and when
she was done, she just barely had enough time to wipe and clean before the
holes were gone.

&nbsp;

With a flush a wash and a sigh, there was no sign she�d ever
gone to the bathroom in the first place.�
Not even a wrinkle in the suit.�
And she was plugged up good and tight so that her sphincter could barely
wrap itself around the cylinder thrust into it.�
It didn�t hurt to walk, but it certainly felt intense with every
step.� If it weren�t for her sense of
dignity, she�d be writhing on the floor trying to fuck the nearest long
object.� In fact, simply thrusting her
hips in any direction produced the desired effect.� As sad as she felt about this situation, she
felt good all over, and it really troubled her that she felt so good.

&nbsp;

The worst part about it was, she still had *three* pieces of
latex �whatever� to put on before the suit was complete.� How was she going to cope with that?

&nbsp;

She pinched her rubber bottom to see if it was a dream.� Nope.� I guess there�s no going back, is there?

&nbsp;

Laurette tried to comfort her through what appeared to be
mind-speak, �I know you�re having a hard
time adjusting to being permanently aroused, but it�s your power that�s growing
inside you.� Please accept that fact, and
please accept who you are.�

&nbsp;

Bliss didn�t want to answer Laurette,
she just wanted to get this over with.

&nbsp;

When she finally returned to the bedroom, she saw the
surprised look on Mistress Alexis� face.

&nbsp;

�My my�back already?� I thought you�d be stuck in there for an hour
at least��

&nbsp;

�It took me some time to figure out what you�d said to me,
but then it just sort of came as an epiphany what I could do with the
suit.� But it�s not easy to get used to,
plus I�m having a hard time getting used to this arousal thing.�

&nbsp;

�I�m simply glad you�re starting to see things the way a
Latex Witch would, instead of an ordinary human.�� Mistress smiled gently.

&nbsp;

Miss Alexis pulled the remaining three articles one by one
out of the case.� Each had a bizarre
appearance, and most likely did something even more bizarre to Bliss�s body.

&nbsp;

�First, I want you to put on this dress,
it is made of latex of course, but understand that it�s designed to deflect magics
off you as opposed to on you.�

&nbsp;

The dress was somewhat long, had a strange waist, and had a
long rubber cape adorning it.� No doubt
the cape suited a Latex Witch just fine.�
But it also had some strange glyphs around the neck hole that stood out
from the rest of the dress.� Even if
Bliss wanted to know what those glyphs were for, Mistress Alexis probably
wouldn�t tell her until after the fact, so she gave up and began to put it
on.� It definitely felt strange putting
one layer of latex on, one after another, she could
almost feel the dress begging to caress her body.� The cape hung loosely, as did the sleeves,
but she knew something would happen the moment everything was in place.

&nbsp;

After a brief sigh of giving in to the clothes wishes, she
watched as the material went to work on merging with the rest of her
outfit.� But a few changes took place.

&nbsp;

Not only did the dress merge with the suit and corset, but
it created a strange padding of rubber behind her back.� Bliss could feel the weight of the material thicken
as it changed.� The dress itself began to
mold itself around the contours of her hips and soon she was walking in what
appeared to be a hobble skirt that only let her move her legs a measly 6 inches
per stride.� She could just barely bend
at the knee and only enough to stoop, the rubber was so thick, and her butt
felt so rounded and thick she felt like she could sit on a bed of nails and not
feel a thing, which was probably true.�
The bottom of the dress remained open thankfully for her huge clodhopper
heels, but what could she do other than walk around in tiny wiggles?

&nbsp;

Before she could answer that question her sleeves were
pulling on her arms at the sides.� Before
she knew it, her arms were fused to her sides like an inchworm, and slowly the
rubber drew her arms behind her back into a single pillar that had formed there
moments before, she gasped in surprise only to find the air in her chest had
tightened, forcing her already enormous breasts out further than she thought
possible.� She could only break in brief
soft sighs, that is, until her neck began to tighten.� She yelped as the suit jerked her neck into
place.� Her head felt like it had been
forced through a large plastic pipe, but the strange posture-maintaining shape
on the suit wouldn�t budge.� She was
forced to keep her hands behind her back (which no longer felt like they
existed as it was now a single mound of rubber fused to her spine, the rubber
cape hiding what remained of her shoulders completely, her rubber breasts out,
jutting just so they were pointed, perky, and prominent, and her hips were
nearly frozen in place just like her neck.�
If she moved at all, a stiff wind would most likely blow her over.

&nbsp;

�I�m really not sure what to make of this development�what
say you Magestra?� Mistress Alexis pressed her finger on her chin in thought.

&nbsp;

The talking hat responded, �This chain of events leads me to believe this girl is to be the next
Queen Magisteress, for this will only occur on those with the Royal Witch
Blood.� Because they have no need for
arms and hands, they are sealed behind their backs a span, and their need for
legs is slight, so they are bound tight, their mouth seldom speaks for it needs
not for the amount of power that sleeps�or so the rhyme goes.� This may be my first time witnessing a Queen
Magisteress� Birth, so I cannot say for certain, that is all I know.�

&nbsp;

�The only thing I can think that would cause this, would be
the young lady�s desire for power is the same as her desire for sex�this is a
theory, however, so take it for what it is worth.� The suit has responded to you as a child
would respond to it�s mother.� Caring, protecting, reinforcing, and even
strengthening your power.� According to
the story told by my dear friend Magestra, the legend is that should the Queen
Magisteress appear, we are to immediately place her in command of the world�s
Witching Order.� But she has the right to
decline her position.� Just know that,
should you accept this, you can be sure your body will remain in this form for
a very long time, unless you willingly use your power to alter it
otherwise.� The moment you relax your
body is the moment the suit will imprison you in this fashion.� The purpose for this I can only see as a
means to maintain and enhance your arousal beyond known limits, this is to keep
your power at its peak.�

&nbsp;

�I only have one thing to ask�� Bliss gulped between tight
sighs of air in her restricted condition, �Do I get to be in charge?�

&nbsp;

�If you were to accept the position of Queen Magisteress,
the Witches Coven�no�the world of Magic�would submit to your will.�

&nbsp;

It took a minute, as Bliss needed to suck in enough air for
her response.

&nbsp;

�Bring it on, old lady�I�ll do anything to climb to the
top!� she said with fire in her eyes.

&nbsp;

�Well spoken, Mistress
Bliss!� We�ll be rooting for you!� Laurette
smiled on top Bliss�s head.

&nbsp;

�I�ll let that one slide for now�but you�ve got a long ways
to go before your Queen Magisteress material.� Mistress Alexia smiled, �But in
some way I am proud of you.�

&nbsp;

Before Bliss could respond, Miss Alexis took Laurette off
her head (which was surprising since Laurette wouldn�t come off Bliss�s head
even if she tried by herself), and quickly put something black and rubbery over
her face.� �Since you�re so gung-ho about
becoming the next Queen Magisteress, I won�t waste time explaining what the
magic in the mask and ball and gag are designed for.� 

&nbsp;

It felt warm and sleek for a moment, but then it felt sleek
all over.� At first her hair felt the
pressure of the hood covering her face and head, then
it felt as though her hair were being pressed through liquid.� Soon it didn�t even feel like she was wearing
a mask at all, just that her face was now covered in solid rubber skin.

&nbsp;

Mistress Alexis then proceeded with the final item.� Before Bliss could protest, a large red ball
was shoved into her mouth and strapped to the back of her head.� She watched with grim sadness as the ball gag
that had been shoved into her mouth ceased to be a ball gag shoved into her
mouth, but a ball gag that was no a part of her face. �The straps that connected to the sides of her
rubber face were gone, leaving only the red ball around red rubber lips, and
she could only mumble slightly and snort breaths through her rubberized nose.� Her hair grew through the top of the rubber
mask so it wasn�t a total loss, but this was soon covered back up by Laurette
who sat atop her Mistress�s head with a stupid grin on her face.

&nbsp;

�So, are you going to
use me, Mistress?�

&nbsp;

�Mfff-muu-mrr-mhht?� [Use you for
what?]

&nbsp;

�For
speaking, silly! I just
discovered the true purpose of all of us Witch Hats and why it is we sound just
like our Mistresses!�

&nbsp;

�Well done, Laurette, I didn�t think you�d come up with that
on your own!� Mistress Alexis smiled.

&nbsp;

Now if only that young
waiter at the restaurant could see me like this�sigh.

&nbsp;

�Ooh-ooh I got this
one!� Let me say it!� Mistress Bliss says �Now if only that�,�
Laurette blurted out.

&nbsp;

Shut up, you!

&nbsp;

�Aww, but I want to
help you talk��

&nbsp;

I don�t want to talk
about that.

&nbsp;

�Now, now, don�t be so mean to Laurette, Bliss,
she�s just trying to assist you, that is her role.� She is your voice now, so you must use her
accordingly.�

&nbsp;

�Mistress says �If I
would�ve known I�d be gagged for the rest of my life I wouldn�t have decided to
do this.�� Laurette stated sadly.

&nbsp;

�Hah�you are quite the humorous girl, Bliss, and that I
admire.� But we have much work to
do.� And just because you cannot use your
hands and arms does not mean you can slack off in your skills as a Latex Witch,
now, we shall go downstairs and I�ll teach you how to ride your very own �Cat
of Nine Tails�.�

&nbsp;

------

Three Years Later�

------

&nbsp;

It had been a lot of work for her, and she had to make a lot
of sacrifices, but ultimately it was worth it.�
It took a long time, and most assuredly a large amount of patience, hard
work, and concentration.� But Magisteress
Bliss was soon the topic of every Witch on the astral plane.� Not only was she the most powerful Witch in
the known Spiritual Realms, but she was quite possibly the most attractive
woman in the whole place.� Whole Covens
envied her, several Magisters and Mage Lords proposed to her, even a few
Necromancers confessed their love for her.�
She was adored by many, hated by some, but feared by all, and never
questioned in her decisions.

&nbsp;

She was a bold new manager for a bold new business, and in
this day and age, it was time to make some Magic!� She knew she could do better than her old
boss did and then some (she was reminded of the look on his face when she
strutted from one end of the building to the other in her �transformed latex
power suit� and announced her resignation, not only had he practically begged
her not to leave, but her former coworkers were no obsessed with talking about
this �transformed woman of beauty�).�
Business in her mind, was booming, and all decisions
were made at her whim or her say...it felt good to be in power.� Still, it had taken her a long time to get
used to using her own Magic as an extra appendage.� Due to the Latex binding she was forced to
rely on what Mistress Alexis referred to as �Telekinesis� a technique that lets
mind control physical objects.� Laurette,
her hat, no longer referred to herself as �Laurette, Mistress Bliss� Hat� but
merely as the nameless voice of Bliss.�
For she no longer had a mind of her own in a sense.� It was not that Bliss had taken her over, but
more that Laurette and Bliss had grown so fond of each other over the years of
training, that Laurette had essentially become an extension of Bliss�s mind and
body (in fact if a doctor were to X-Ray the two, they would see that Laurette
is now purely a rubber talking hat fused to Bliss�s now �wholly� rubber
skull).� It could be said that no Hat or
Mistress had ever been as close in the history of Witchery, and in that sense,
some of the other �hats� envied Laurette, even her sister Magestra.� On days when Magisteress Bliss desired to
travel, Laurette would Magically produce the Cat O� Nine Tails Crop she would
ride, as Bliss seldom ever walked anywhere without riding upon the Crop due to
her �hobbling�.� If one were lucky, one
would see the two riding in the dark sky at night, Bliss�s rubber reflecting
the moonlight.

&nbsp;

She several times regretted her decision to become the Queen
Magisteress, but that has long since faded as she blossomed into what the Coven
Master�s call the �Black Rose of Salem�.�
Her powers within the suit are so intense that many a would-be usurper
tried to take away her powers or curse her, and failed.� Because of the constant tingling she receives
in her body, she has very little to fear.�
In her constant state of arousal, she has achieved a form of what she
refers to as Sexual Zen, a height of consciousness achieved through steady orgasms, she has been the topic of debate for numerous Magic
theorists and will be for some time to come.�
There are few Magisters that can boast having had sex with Bliss as her
sexual desire is seemingly unquenchable, those who have admitted to it hang
their heads in shame and defeat at her monstrous appetite for fulfillment.

&nbsp;

There were of course days which Bliss missed being able to
move her limbs.� Some days she would use
up all her now-famous amount of Magical energy (stored up in her large breasts
and hips via arousal no less), she would cast a spell on herself, creating the
classic business suit she wore during her time at the office (although she has
gotten used to Laurette speaking on her behalf, as the two are inseparable).� The magic she uses for this is powerful and
can only be used once a day for the whole day, during this time she is
powerless and cannot use her Magic (during which time, several Covens will cast
a protective spell on their �Black Rose�), but in this sense, she is relieved,
as she knows that soon the spell will wear off and she will be forced back into
rubbery orgasmic bondage bliss�for Bliss!

&nbsp;

The End!
