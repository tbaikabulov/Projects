1. Tinkerbell correctional facility� - July 2054

&nbsp;

He looked out of the
window. The flight to Sydney was taking off. Only 1,5
hours and they will have traveled the entire distance from L.A. to Australia.

&nbsp;

He had never been to
Australia. Since the have opened the new route via stratosphere rockets back in
2047, he had this dream of flying there. It would never happen.

&nbsp;

The door opened and a
woman in her twenties entered. �Hey. My name is Kathy. Your parents send me. I
am going to entertain you tonight, but first I will have you to ask you to
strip.�

&nbsp;

�Why?�

&nbsp;

�You have to have this
harness on. It is the rule. Often people like you becomes stressed when they
have such an event to be a part of tomorrow. Here let me help you with you
clothes.�

&nbsp;

�What kind of entertainment
can you offer? I have to say that I do not feel like I would be much of a
company tonight.�

&nbsp;

�Just let me show you,
what I can offer. You need to loose the underwear too.�

&nbsp;

�But �. I have not
been with a girl before.�

&nbsp;

�Just relax. I have
seen it all before. See � it doesn�t hurt. Now lift your arms.�

&nbsp;

�Oh. The chains are
cold.�

&nbsp;

�I know honey, but you
will get used to them. I will now put the waist belt on.�

&nbsp;

�It is tight.�

&nbsp;

�It has to be. Spread
your legs a little I have to put these two leather straps between your legs. Do
not be nervous. So one strap of each side of your scrotum and connected to the
back of the waist belt.�

&nbsp;

�You have so warm
hands.�

&nbsp;

�Now � put your hands
into the leather cuffs in the front of the belt. I am afraid that I have to
make them very tight.�

&nbsp;

�Ouch.�

&nbsp;

�I am sorry, but it is
the rules. It is very important that your arms are restrained. The last thing I
have to do is to fasten the shoulder straps.�

&nbsp;

�Stop. It is too tight.�

&nbsp;

�I am afraid it is
not. You will get used to it. Here let me help you over to the bed. That is
good. You have to sit down.� She watched him as he walked over to the bed. The
harness was fitted perfectly. A wide waist belt with a big D-ring in the front
where two leather cuffs were attached with D-rings to his hand were rendered
immobilized. Wide shoulder straps helped to keep his hands close to his body
and it was complete with two leather straps going between his legs.

&nbsp;

When he was seated she
kissed him, which caught him with surprise. He was so nervous that he began to
shake. �So relax. I am not going to hurt you. I have promised your parents to
take care of you and let you become a man.� She kissed him again and held his
body in her arms. Slowly he began to relax.

&nbsp;

�Now I am going to put
the hood on you. Do not afraid. It will help you tomorrow if you associate the
hood with something nice.�

&nbsp;

Once he had got the
leather hood down over his head, he discovered that there were openings for
both eyes and mouth. She laced the hood tight and kissed once more before she
guided him to lie down on his back.

&nbsp;

�I am now going to put
both the mouth and eye pieces on so you can feel what I am doing more
intensive. Open your mouth.�

&nbsp;

As he opened his
mouth, he felt rubber enter it. It was pushed so far in that he coughed. Next came the eyepiece. He was in darkness.

&nbsp;

He felt her hands all
over his body. Each touch felt like small electrical shocks. His member became
hard. Then she put something around his scrotum and tightened it. He almost
came, but she tied it so tight that he had to bite into the gag due to the
pain. Still he could feel the blood pumping in his member. He clenched his
hands. Of course he had played with himself before. He so wanted a relief. And
her licking his nipples made it worse.

&nbsp;

Suddenly he forgot
about his member as a sharp pain came from one of his nipples. He tried to
scream but all he got out of it was coughing and repressed sounds.

&nbsp;

She continued to lick
him and even took his member into her mouth. Now he was sweating. Again he felt
how the blood pumped in the veins on his member. If he had been able to talk,
he would have begged her to give him relief.

&nbsp;

He lost track of time.
He sweated like a pig. She took his member into her mouth once again. Suddenly
she released the strap around his scrotum and then he came. It was not like
something he ever had experienced before. It was as it had its own life. It
just continued to cum but Kathy drank it all.

&nbsp;

When it finally
stopped, she continued to suck his member. She touched him gently behind the
scrotum and slowly his member became hard again. In the end he came once more.
Then he passed out.

&nbsp;

She must have cleaned
him because when he woke, the ball stretcher, nipple clamps and hood was gone.

&nbsp;

He looked out then
window and began to wonder why he was here. He started to write his story down
on a paper.

2. Troubled

&nbsp;

My name is Stephen.
This is my story about my road to my exit plan. Please tell this story to your
children, so they don�t do the same mistake.

&nbsp;

It started some years
ago, when I was in high school. We were having a party and one of my pals had
access to alcohol. I was drunk and when I returned home, my parents went
ballistics. Providing alcohol to teenagers below the age of 21 is a serious
offence and many year ago did some parents, who
provided alcohol to their 16 year old son�s birthday, end up in jail for 27
months.

&nbsp;

This case became
precedent for all future case and my parents were so afraid that they should be
suspected because a neighbor saw me, while I was staggering up the driveway.

&nbsp;

So my parents turned
me in. I went before the judge and he ordered me to clean my act up during the
next two years or I will be offered an exit plan from the society. Decades ago,
exit plans was used by behavior
modification facilities, when they could not deal with the teenager before he
or she became 18. In order to spare the parents from the poor outcome of their
investment in the teenager�s rehab, the teenager was shipped to a different
part of the country with 50-100 dollars to start their adult life on. It was a
good solution because most teenagers broke down with the possibility to be cut
of from their own family and agreed to remain in private jail for further 3
years.

&nbsp;

But original exit plan
had its flaws. After having been in private jail for years, some of the
teenagers could not figure out how the world functioned. So their life took the
path of crime. Innocent people were murdered by those
youth banished from all their love ones. So a new federal law was passed during
in year 2030, when Miss J. W. Bush was president, which ordered any behavior
modification facility to turn a teenager in risk of turning 18 without
completing the program over to the authorities. Then the teenager would have to
pass a final test or take an exit plan from society.

&nbsp;

My parents were
ordered to make a plan for my recovery, which the court had to approve. I did
not hear anything about the plan before I one night
was woken by my parents and two strangers. I was told that my parents had
chosen a motivation boot camp in Baja California and next a wilderness therapy
program in a remote part in Utah for my recovery. 

3. Mexico

&nbsp;

I cannot tell very
much about my ride down to Mexico. Once my parents had left the room, I was
told to undress and then a leather hood was pulled down over my head. My arms
were put in some kind of leather muff, which had straps going to cuffs on my
upper arms - Needless to say that I was totally in their control. They also put
a pair of odd-feeling trousers on me, which I later discovered was a diaper.

&nbsp;

I have seen books
about boot camps before. They are hard and this camp was no exception. Once
arrived, I was given an enema and a corset looking outfit with leather cuffs on
both my upper and lower arms. The outfit was completed with a posture collar
and a bit-gag. They had some kind of a level system and I started at the bottom
as mule. It took me 40 days to graduate from this awful place, but I was lucky.
I was never put on challenge. I just played along and in some way fooled my way
out of there. The transport firm gave me a new ride to my next destination,
which was a wilderness therapy program in Utah.

&nbsp;

I remember how, once
the transport company had turned me over to the staff, I was blindfold and
placed in a circle of other participants, who had some kind of ritual. I can
only remember the hunger and thirst I had to endure for 7 weeks, but finally I
was able to return home.

4. Too much control

&nbsp;

When I returned home,
the court ordered me to wear an electronic alcohol detector � a bracelet on my
food, which detected my sweat every 30 minutes all year.

&nbsp;

In the start I
managed, but time only progressed slowly and soon I did not care about
anything. So I drank and it was discovered. My parents cried in court. I had
only a year left before I was adult. The judge could see that my parents were
committed to heal my health problem, so the court ordered me to join the new
community based transport program, which had been in function for just a 6
years. Our present president who had managed to turn
her life around 47 years ago, had now been elected for her third period setting
aside the 22nd amendment due to her extraordinary service of
restoring morality in our country.

&nbsp;

My parents were given
a transportable stable, which was placed in the driveway. Every morning they
would come out and give me breakfast and an enema before giving me a harness, a
butt-plug with tail, special shoes which left hoof-marks and bit-gag on before
hooking me up to a cart. One of them � often my mom would then drive the cart
with me pulling it down to the city hall, where I sometime would enter the role
of a taxi or being assigned to a larger cart and function as a van. I can
remember one time when I was put in yoke of 10 teenagers. It was difficult and
we were whipped very hard to pull whatever load they had put in.

&nbsp;

I liked the cab-job
but I missed my school. I like the rest only worked part-time and was
home-schooled in the stable. I felt isolated because there was no room for
talking with the other teenagers. We all had bit-gags in our mouth and we got
only water during the day from a kind of can looking like those you have in
rabbit-cages.

&nbsp;

So one night just a
few weeks ago I choose to runaway instead of taking the test. If I passed the
test, I had to wear the bracelet for a further 3 years. If I during these three
years would drink alcohol the punishment would be 10 years of full-time service
in the transport program. I would not be able to live home but in a stable down
at the city hall. They would pull teeth out so they could fit a permanent
bit-gag made of steel. I would be almost 30 before I would be free. I could not
live like that, so I ran.

&nbsp;

But before I could
flee the States I was caught. Like almost any youth, I tried to go to Canada
where I could travel to Europe where they had no alcohol limit. For some reason
they had chosen another strategy in Europe. My cousin from Denmark told me in
an email, that they had no lower legal age for drinking alcohol and a 16-year
limit on buying alcohol. She even had obtained the license every Dane aged 16
can buy so they can show that they are allowed to buy alcohol on their own.
Anyway, because most runaways were going for Canada, the authorities also knew
where to find me. I was taken back and faced the court for a final time. 

&nbsp;

I was given three
choices: 

&nbsp;


 Signing on for transport service until I
     was 21 years under restricted conditions
 Taking the test at once.
 Taking the exit plan.


&nbsp;

Restricted conditions
meant that I had to wear a harness, which were made for me to wear all time. I
would get a permanent bit and loose some teeth. Due to that I would have to
live on liquid food for the next three years and I would have to endure further
three years with daily enemas. I had seen the eyes of people, who were serving
long-time in the transport service. Their eyes looked empty, as they had no
spirit. This was not an option for me.

&nbsp;

Then there was the
adulthood test. It was known to be a hard test where only about 6 out of 10
passed. If I failed, the result would be the same as the exit plan. I just gave
up and choose the latter. Yesterday was my birthday and Kathy was my present.

&nbsp;

So now I am here. I
can here them coming so I have to end now. 

&nbsp;

Best of luck 

Stephen

5. Preparation

&nbsp;

Stephen was a little
surprised when the door opened and he discovered that it was Kathy and his
parents. They all were dressed in yellow rain-suits and rubber boots.

&nbsp;

�Why are you dressed
like this and where is the staff?�

&nbsp;

Kathy took the word. �Beside serving needs like yours last night, it is also my
job to see you through your transformation. And your parents had chosen to be a
part of the process too. They love you. They know that they by turning you in
years ago gave you some extra years in rehab. Unfortunately it did not turn out
very well, but they bought you time.�

&nbsp;

�You are my �.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, I am personal
responsible for you all the way. Don�t worry. If we do it quietly and relaxed
it will go very easy. Please follow me.�

&nbsp;

His parents placed
their hands around him and the walked down the hallway to the room made
especially for the exit plan.

&nbsp;

�Stephen. Do you know
the story about this facility?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, many years ago
it was a normal prison for women, but our present president underwent a
personal emotional growth back in 2007 during a 23 days sentence. Well, not
exactly 23 days, because she went from place to place, but her journey started
in a cell here. That is why the prison was renamed after her beloved dog, which
she was so fun of that she cloned the animal some 6 times. I think that she
must be on dog number 7 or 8.�

&nbsp;

�Dog number 7. Because
she learned so much here and turned her life around, so she today stands as an
icon for charity, the law enables me to give you a last chance until we reach
the room for the exit plan. Do you want to take the adulthood test instead?�

&nbsp;

�No, I have made my
mind up. Exit plan it must be.�

&nbsp;

�I am sorry. I had
hoped that you would have decided otherwise. Now here is the room.�

&nbsp;

They went inside and
the preparation started. First his legs were fitted with leg braces, which prevented
him from bending his legs and kick. Next came a leg
spreader, so his legs were about 40 cm from each other.

&nbsp;

�Why do you immobilize
my legs?�

&nbsp;

�Can you see the
camera? The entire process is taped and sold for charity. The taxpayers would
have to do without the income tax from you, so we have to compensate them.
Please bend over.�

&nbsp;

He bed over and his
father came with a butt plug made of wood. It was lubricated, but it was very
big. �No. Stop it hurts.�

&nbsp;

�Sorry. It has to go
in. It will not look good if an accident occurred.�

&nbsp;

He cleansed his teeth.
The pain was almost unbearable, but suddenly it slipped in.

&nbsp;

�I am sorry but it was
bigger than the normal ones, we used for a tail. It is not meant to come out. Now for the hood.�

&nbsp;

The leather hood came
on. There were openings for the mouth and eyes. Then it was time for Kathy and
the parents to take their masks on. They pulled their hoods up. Now none could
recognize them. Kathy pressed a bottom on the wall and a light began to blink
indicating that the camera was now recording.

6. Exit plan

&nbsp;

�In the name of the
State of California I am here to announce that Stephen Morris has chosen to
take his exit plan. Mr. Stephen Morris, do you have a statement?�

&nbsp;

Stephen shook his
head.

&nbsp;

Kathy came over to him
and inserted the mouth peace. In fact it was a pecker gag and it reached almost
down to his throat. He coughed. His mother placed her hand on his shoulder to
calm him down.

&nbsp;

Then the noose was
lowered from the ceiling and place around his neck. Kathy � his personal
executioner � knew what she was doing. She put it around his neck. She gently
pulled it tight. She knew that some people panic once they feel the noose tight
around their necks, so she kissed him gently on the hood. Next she used a
remote control to hoist the rope into the air, so Stephen was forced up on his
tiptoe. Now only thing was missing - a possible presidential pardon. Kathy
started the timer. The president had one minute to activate a green light in
the room.

&nbsp;

Stephen followed the
timer. He was beginning to sweat. Now the reality kicked in. He did not reckon
with a pardon, but death was also not on his mind. Like most teenagers it is
normally so far away. A tear left his eyes. A suppressed sobbing was heard from
with the hood. 15 seconds was gone.

&nbsp;

He eyes looked around
in the room. In the end he turned his attention to the clock. Every second
produced a bead of perspiration. 30 seconds!

&nbsp;

Kathy stepped forward
and put the blindfold on. �Good luck. Stephen. Remember the feelings from last
night, then you will be fine.�

&nbsp;

His mother began to
sob. Their eyes met and the last she saw of his eyes was the widened eyeballs
and the desperate look of a person, who knows that he is going to die.

&nbsp;

Stephen was in
darkness. How many second had he left? He was in despair. He peed on the floor.

&nbsp;

The time came to a
stop. Had he been pardoned?

&nbsp;

Suddenly the noosed
tightened. He was lifted off the floor.

&nbsp;

Kathy watched as the
time ran out and Stephen was hoisted into the air. His feet stopped just 20 cm
off the floor. First his body was limp. Then it began to shiver. Kathy looked
at Stephen�s parents who held each other very tight. She had to admire them.
Most parents would have stayed at home, but it was clear that they wanted to
shorten his sufferings. However they had to wait, because the law stated that
they have to wait 5 minutes before they could help. People did after all pay
for the transmission. They should be entitled to some entertainment for their
money.

&nbsp;

Stephen suffered from
intense pain from the neck and to add worse, every breath he took made his
lungs feel like a plastic bag, which crumpled up. He coughed but the gag
stopped the sounds.

&nbsp;

Kathy watched the
clock. 2 minutes. She turned to Stephen and observed his member, when it began
to stiffen. The body continued to shiver and it started to twist a little and
started to spin. She had seen so many take their exit plan. She knew that
Stephen was a good entertainer, when she first saw him.

&nbsp;

Stephen was
experiencing panic fear. Suddenly he regretted to have chosen the exit plan. It
had seem such an easy way out of a life based on hard
work and being treated as an animal. Blood was pounding in his ears and he
tried desperately to catch just another gasp of air, but it was of no avail.
Slowly he drifted into half-unconsciousness. Suddenly he felt his member
starting to pump semen out. Like yesterday it had its life on its own. It
pumped and pumped. He felt so tired. He wanted it to end.

The body seemed to
settle. A quiet rasping sound came from the hood. It was time. Kathy signaled
the parents and they rushed over to the body and pulled down. There was not
reason for Stephen to suffer anymore. They held his body tight. In the moment
of his death he was united with his family. They felt his smell - His final breath.
Semen continued to spout out on the floor. It seemed to go on forever until it
finally stopped. Stephen was gone.

&nbsp;

The transmission
stopped and Kathy came over and milked the last of the semen out. The parents
sat down and cried while they hugged each other. Kathy knew that they had to
say farewell in privacy, so she left.

&nbsp;

An hour later she
lowered the body of Stephen cleaned the body. When she removed the hood, he
looked peaceful. Back in the cell, a staff member handed the parents Stephens
writing. His body was turned over to them in a body bag. Stephen Morris had
taken his exit plan.
