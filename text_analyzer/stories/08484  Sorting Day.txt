Synopsis:  Could this be the future?






During the first half of the 21 century the nanny state became so world wide that no one was producing what was needed to keep the human population from becoming extinct.&nbsp; Ultimately there became two factions that fought over the control of the planet.&nbsp; These were the hard core liberal element led by female politicians that only wanted power and really did not care about the people.&nbsp; The other group believed that each person should carry his or her own weight.&nbsp; During the war that followed the women developed a virus that killed 80% of the men, 100% of dogs, horses and cows.&nbsp; It also destroyed most wildlife.&nbsp; Female births outnumbered male 8 to 2.&nbsp; Many women after seeing the destruction caused by the liberal group joined the working group.&nbsp; Soon the war was over and the liberals were destroyed.&nbsp; After the war the leaders of the world that existed got together to work out a way to prevent future wars.&nbsp; The women of the world volunteered to give up all of the rights they had.&nbsp; Life went on, science changed and women became property of men.&nbsp; They are not even called women, just females.

This story is sometime in the future.


Sorting Day

Today is the day of choosing.&nbsp; Judy is now 16 years old and after today she will no longer be the same child that she had been.

By law all females are to be sorted on the sixteenth anniversary of their birth.&nbsp; 

Today judy would be escorted to the sorting station by her father and most likely never see her mother again.&nbsp; She left her bedroom without getting dressed and hugged her mother good-by.&nbsp; She looked at her mother one last time with longing.&nbsp; She knew she did not have the body to become a wife quality female.&nbsp; In fact she may not have the looks to become a human female.

Females are sorted in the following categories:

The most perfect physical specimens became eligible to become wives and breeders and as such are marked with a gold ring through its clitoris.
The next class would become pleasure sluts and would be modified to prevent pregnancy.&nbsp; Often it is also modified by having the 2 lower ribs removed, the inner organs relocated so the waist can be reduced to less than 16 inches, breasts enhanced to F or larger and Achilles tendon shortened requiring wearing 6 in or taller heels.&nbsp; Other modifications are at the discretion of its owner.&nbsp; This class is marked by a large silver ring through its clitoris.
The next class is the working slaves.&nbsp; The owner may do as he desires and the state will not require any modifications other than sterilization.&nbsp; This class is marked by a 6 in 10 ga brass ring through its clitoris.
The class 4 is the highest class of animal replacement.&nbsp; They are marked by a 10 in 6 ga stainless steel ring through its septum.&nbsp; They may or may not be sterilized.&nbsp; These females will become visible replacements for the animals lost by the gas attacks.&nbsp; They will become horses and dogs mostly. It will be modified as needed to fit its work assignment.&nbsp; Twins are often modified by removing the head of the more intelligent one and grafting its body to the backbone of the other so to create a centaur type animal.&nbsp; This is very in-depth surgurey but the finished results are spectacular especially when both sets of arms are removed and the head is shaped like a horse.&nbsp; The voice box is modified in all animals and some times the breasts of the lower half are enhanced to g of bigger.&nbsp; I once saw one that would step on its nipples if it backed up.&nbsp; Most frequently though the female has its head reshaped, arms removed and feet molded into hooves.&nbsp; The slender leggy animals often end up as cart ponies for cabs and other private transportation.&nbsp; The animals with the stronger legs will become draught horses.&nbsp; Petit animals become dogs.
The class 5s is used as dairy cows.&nbsp; Cows are never sterilized and kept pregnant.&nbsp; The female offspring are considered by-product and are butchered at birth.&nbsp; The cows have been modified to produce several gallons of milk daily.&nbsp; The drugs used to increase milk production tend to cause body deterioration and this class is only useful for few years.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then it is butchered for cow food.&nbsp;&nbsp; It is marked by a steel ring through the septum.
The class 6s are fattened and butchered.&nbsp; This class is marked with a large brand on its ass.


Judy believed that she is not a 6 but not sure she was good enough to be a 4.&nbsp; She had worked very hard to keep her legs strong hoping to become a draught pony.&nbsp; Her large breasts worked against her and might send her to the dairy.&nbsp; She also had a tendency to gain weight and hoped that she was not sorted on a day that there would be a shortage of meat animals.

After hugging her mother she looked at her younger sister that would without a doubt be a class 1.&nbsp; The younger one had often teased her about being class 5 and when being real cruel called her a class 6.

Her father then placed a collar around her neck, cuffed her hands behind her and pulled them up between her shoulder blades then attached the cuff to her collar.&nbsp; He then led her out to the street.&nbsp; In her lifetime she had seen many females lead this way and knew someday it would be her.

Upon arrival at the sorting center the line was short and soon she was next.&nbsp; The class 3 that was talking to her father asked several questions and he answered.&nbsp; The answer to the last question is hamburger and sausage.

Judy was then lead to door # 6.

Now she was scared for the first time today.&nbsp; Had she been sorted already?&nbsp; Didn&#8217;t she get some sort of test?&nbsp; Had the quota of meat not been reached today?&nbsp; She hoped it would be quick.&nbsp; She also felt a twinge of regret that she was to die as a virgin.

Inside the room behind door 6 her leash was attached to a hook on a ceiling conveyor and she had to walk quickly to keep up or else fall and probably strangle.&nbsp; She was led up a short inclined ramp.&nbsp; The ramp end abruptly and she was pulled off by the leash.&nbsp; Judy hung momentarily by her neck then was submerged in the pool below her.&nbsp; She was being dragged through the water then up another ramp, somehow she managed to get her feet under her and took the pressure off her neck.&nbsp; Then the conveyor forced her to climb a number of steps.&nbsp; This was like an escalator except it was going the opposite direction she was so she had to run as fast as she could.&nbsp; Before reaching the top she must have climbed 150 steps but had actually only gone 15 feet.&nbsp; Next she was led onto a bright room where a class 3 released her from the conveyor.&nbsp; The class 3 led her to a large square block in the middle of the room.&nbsp; There were 2 holed in each side at different levels.&nbsp; She was led to one side that matched the level of her breasts.&nbsp; The class 3 directed her to push her breasts into the holes.&nbsp; She felt a strong vacuum pull very hard and the pain was excruciating.&nbsp; After several seconds she was released and led into another room where the class 3 hooked her leash to a hook in the ceiling.&nbsp; 

The class 3 then told her that this was the last time she would ever speak and now would be a good time to ask any questions.&nbsp; First she would be given the results of her tests.

Body fat is at 38% which is 3% above the minimum for meat so she is a good candidate for the butcher.

Leg strength and stamina is at 60 which is 10 points above average which makes her a good candidate for a work pony.

Her breast size is 8 points above minimum for being a dairy cow.

She is one of the few that could end up being any of the lower animal group and may over time be all of them.

Her questions answered she was led into another room where a large needle was inserted into her throat.&nbsp; Her throat burned and she tried to scream but was unable to make any noise.&nbsp; The class 3 told her that eventually, if she lived long enough; she would be able to make some noises but would never talk again.

She was then led to a room where several men were sitting at a table.&nbsp; The class 3 laid some papers on the table hooked the leash to a chain hanging from the ceiling.&nbsp; She then pushed a button on the desk; the chain retracted up and pulled Judy to her toes.&nbsp; The class 3 then grabbed judies nipple and twisted until tears came to judies eyes.&nbsp; It started to walk away but was called back and told by one of the men that she should not be cruel to animals.&nbsp; This was her second time of being told and next time she would be off to the butcher.&nbsp; The class 3 turned pail and then was allowed to leave.

One of the men pushed the button on the table again and now judy was hanging from her leash and collar.&nbsp; The men watched her for several minutes then one pushed another button and she was lowered.

The man in the middle asked for comments.&nbsp; One stated it might make a good pony and another agreed.&nbsp; The third man said it is doubtful but maybe.&nbsp; The forth man said to save everybody time it should be butchered right now.

The man in the middle looked hard at her and then at the paper in front of her.&nbsp; H e said that animals with her score almost never work out as work ponies because the needed leg strength is really not there.&nbsp; Her teat size was not really up to modern standards and would not be able to produce enough milk to pay the dairy for expenses.&nbsp; The butcher liked a few more points of body fat so that would cost also.

Taking everything into account and the fact that we have met our meat quota for the day, this animal will be numbered 2337-00079823 and held for sale until 0600 tomorrow morning.&nbsp; If it is not sold by then it will be butchered for hamburger.

A class 3 released 237-00079823s leash from the chain and led it through a door behind the men.&nbsp; The first thing it saw was 10 16 year old female bodies hanging from the feet and blood dripping from a small hole on each side of the neck.&nbsp; One female slowly open its eyes then closed them again.&nbsp; The class 3 stated that this is the killing room and that very few females sold during the night.&nbsp; In the class 3s opinion 237-000079823 would be the first female butchered in the morning.

237-00079823 was led out to a courtyard and her head was placed in the hole of a stock.&nbsp; She recognized this as the place her father had brought her some years ago to buy the family dog.

She could see a clock on the wall, it is now midnight and for 237-00079823 sorting day is over and its life will never be the same.
