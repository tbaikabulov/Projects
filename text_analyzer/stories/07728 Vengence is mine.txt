CHAPTER ONE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carman and Nathan were both eighteen years of age, and they had been married two years. Both of them had good well paid jobs, and it was the end of spring; but because of factory refurbishment, Nathan was about to start a six week paid holiday. 
Carman was six foot tall with long black hair, and it originated from her Italian ancestors. She was also very pretty and quite slim in build. 
Nathan was also six foot tall and average build, and he was athletic and football on a regular basis; it kept his body in trim but only just. He was good looking but only in an average sort of way, but he did have a good heart and was always happy; there was very little that could get him down.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was a friend of Carman&#8217;s that approached her while she was at work �Hi Carman is there anything wrong between you and Nathan?� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No, of course not; whatever made you think of that?� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It&#8217;s just that I saw him talking to the Nancy Bolter the other day in town, and he was handing her something, and it looked like a letter.� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well, that doesn&#8217;t mean to say that there is anything going on between them.�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I was just thinking; that you ought to remember that she was a tremendous flirt at school, and she was extremely pretty. I have heard tell that she is training to be a model, and she has also been having photo sessions.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well, to put your mind at rest, things could not be happier between Nathan and me.� However for the rest of the day, Carman had this niggling feeling in the back of her mind, and she knew that when Nathan came home she would bring up the subject with him.&#8217;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathan was on his way through town and as usual, and he walked into the cafe at the corner of the high street. He sat at his usual table, but was only there a little while before the person he was expecting to meet walked in �Hello Nathan, how are you� Then the girl sat down opposite him?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m fine; I had better give you this and run, because I am late tonight.� He pushed an envelope over the table towards her. �I had better come to your place the next time, because the works is closing down for six weeks; but that will be better for both of us.� He stood up and walked out of the cafe and home.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unknown to Nathan there was a girl behind him, and she was listening to all that had been said, and was smiling at the young man that was with her.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathan walked through the door, and sat down in the lounge and then he turned on the TV; once he had sat back watching the old film, he waited for Carman to arrive home. He must have dozed off, because he woke up being shook; it was Carman telling him that his meal was ready.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They were curled up on the sofa watching the movies on TV until late; then after turning the lights off and locking the door, they both went to bed. It was as he had lay down that Carman out of the blue asked �Do you know Nancy Bolter?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Should I� he asked?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�My friend told me that you were talking to her in the high street the other day, and you handed her a letter.� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m still not with you Carman?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�She is quite pretty with long blonde curly hair, and has big boobs.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Is that what her name was; yes I picked up a letter that she dropped, and handed it back to her? Why what&#8217;s the problem; have I done something wrong?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No darling, I was just curious that&#8217;s all.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The conversation was forgotten, and they both carried on as normal, it was the following Friday, and it was the day that Nathan finished for the six weeks. It was the same day that he had to meet a person of great importance, and he went around to the new block of flats. The lift was out of order, so he had to walk four flights to get to the correct floor, he knocked the door and it was opened by a young woman. �You had better come in and I will get everything for you.� Once he was inside she closed the door.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was only a few minutes later that the door opened and he walked out; he smiled and punched air, and then he walked away. Once again unknown to him, there was someone with a mobile phone taking photos of all that took place. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That night Nathan was in a great mood, he bought a Chinese for Carman and himself, and they drank wine while eating it.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At the usual time they both went to bed, and Nathan lay in bed and watched as Carman stripped seductively in front of him. He could feel his manhood rising, as she took her time stripping every piece of clothes from her body. She turned around to face him, and then with her hands cupped under her breasts she smiled; his eyes ran down over her body taking in her curves. Her pubic area was shaved clean, but only because she only had a small amount of pubic hair, and she always thought that it was unsightly. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Still looking into his eyes, she slipped around the bed and slid between the sheets. Getting close to Nathan she leaned over with her head, and kissed him on the lips. Nathan responded, by putting his arm over her body and pulling her to him, and pushing his tongue into her mouth, that he was now kissing. Still gently holding her, he rolled onto his knees, and threw back the covers; then taking his mouth from hers; he bent down over her breast, and took her dark nipple into his mouth. He felt the nipple react and stand up hard and proud, and then moving his head he did the same to the other nipple; this was always something that Carman liked about lovemaking. She loved the feeling of him fondling her breasts and nipples, as she had found from a very early age that her nipples were very sensitive. Nathan&#8217;s hand was now on one of her breasts, as his mouth manipulated the nipple on the other. Carman was starting to move her body, and she was trying to push more of her breast into his mouth. He responded by opening his mouth wider, and then sucking in more of her soft flesh. Still with his hand playing with her breast he moved his head down to her belly, and kissing all the flesh as he worked his way down.&nbsp; He slipped around to the end of the bed, and he was now kissing her inner thigh making his way back up to her sex. Carman was wriggling her body trying to speed his mouth towards her sex; then his mouth touched her entrance and she caught her breath. Both of his hands now had a breast in each, and Carman was pushing her sex into his mouth, his tongue was darting in and out. It was not long before she gave a loud sigh, as she arched her back and let her fluids flow into his mouth. He was drinking her juices as if it was the only fluid left on earth, and as soon as the task was finished he moved on. Nathan moved position letting his body slip over hers, and all the time kissing her flesh as he moved his way up her body. His face was looking down at her, and now his manhood was pushing against her entrance; Carman was now pushing her body trying to speed up the process. He smiled at her and then pushed forward, all the time watching her face contort with pleasure. It was then that Nathan got into a steady rhythm, and now as he thrust, Carman was pushing up to meet him. It seemed as they had been going at this pace forever, then he felt her have her second orgasm, he speeded up, and seconds later he had his own climax. Nathan was now exhausted and he slipped out, and he fell beside her body and lay on the bed; and he then slipped his hand under her body and pulled her to him. As they were laid looking at each other, Carman told him �I think I am pregnant, and at least a month and it might even be longer.� This was something that they both wanted, and had been trying from the first day they were married. They both fell asleep in each other&#8217;s arms contented.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The rest of the weekend went without incident and on the Monday Carman want to work. It was while she was at work that her friend spoke to her once more �I see that Nathan was talking to Nancy again a couple of weeks ago. He was in the cafe talking to her, and sitting at her table and they were talking for hours, I was sitting behind them while he spoke sweet nothings to her. Don Masters was in there sitting down with me, and he won&#8217;t lie to you.� 
She knew Don; he thought he was a bit of a lady&#8217;s man, and was always telling her to ditch Nathan and go with him. Don was good looking, and was also very fit, and in a small way Carman always fancied him. He was the same age as her, and they went to school together, and they were also in the same class.&nbsp; It was after she left school that she went with Nathan, and Don was pestering her to leave him then. Don was also working for the same firm as she was, and was over the other side of the canteen with a table full of men.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I will see you tomorrow Jill, I have to go and speak with Don,� and then she stood up and walked across to where he was sitting. 
When she got close he looked up and said �Hello, if it isn&#8217;t the beautiful Carman, and what can we do for you?� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I want to speak with you in private, if at all that&#8217;s possible.� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well I think that&#8217;s possible, I have to go outside for some fresh air.� Then he stood up, and they both walked out into the fresh air together, and once outside he asked �Now what can I do for the beautiful Carman?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What do you know about Nancy Bolter and Nathan?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh why did you have to ask me that, and how did you find out about them?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What do you know about them, you have to tell me if he has been cheating?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well you know at school she was a bit of a flirt, well it seems that she still is, and her marriage is about to split up over this affair. Her husband, that I am not going to name, gave me a photo of her new flame leaving her flat; he had watched him go in and two hours later he walked out. He gave me the photograph, or rather a computer copy of the fellow, and asked me if I knew who he was.� He pulled the photo from his pocket and showed her, and her world fell apart in front of her. The picture was of Nathan entering and then coming out, and punching air in triumph. Tears came to her eyes and Don said �Sorry Carman, I was never going to show you, because we have always been such good friends. I said that you should not have married him, and that you should have stayed with someone safe like me.� She was now crying and he put his arms around her, and as he leaned against his chest he smiled. It was five minutes before she stopped, and pushed away from him, and he asked her if she was ok.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She answered him �Yes Don, and please don&#8217;t say anything to anyone; I need time to get my head around this. Nathan is going up to his Aunts in Doncaster tomorrow morning, it&#8217;s for his uncle&#8217;s funeral, and will be away for a week. I should be able to work out what I am going to do about the situation by then.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Ok Carman, my lips are sealed, and until you tell me different they will stay sealed.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They both walked inside and nothing more was talked about between them. When Carmen got home that night she said nothing, but every time she looked at Nathan, she was seeing red. It took all her will power to stop herself from ripping his throat out, but she knew in her heart, that for betraying her like this, he really had to be punished. That night in bed he tried to put his arms around her, and she pushed him away, saying that she was not feeling too good. He went to kiss her on the cheek, but she turned away as he was about to do so; Nathan knew there was something wrong but had no idea what it was. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He slept late the next morning and Carman had already left for work, and that was strange because she never ever left before giving him a kiss. She also knew that he was going away for a few days, and it surprised him that she never said goodbye. He jumped out of bed and dressed, then packed his clothes for the funeral in a small suitcase. It took him no time at all to eat some food, and walk towards the station.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carman was at work, and she was once again in the canteen with her friend Jill. �What happened last night, did you and Nathan get fighting, and did he deny the affair; well I suppose it was an affair?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Nothing happened, because I never brought up the subject; I have to think with a clear mind about what to do. The last thing I want to do, is go about his punishment half cocked. He has hurt me in the worst way; he has been fucking another woman, and it&#8217;s just to satisfy his own lust. He had no thoughts about me while he went off and sowed his wild seed; for all I know she could be pregnant. Fuck it, what am I going to do about the baby?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I wouldn&#8217;t think that is your problem, it will be Nancy&#8217;s problem.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Not her baby, mine you clown; oh I forgot I have only told Nathan so far that I am pregnant, about six weeks as far as I can make out. Never mind that, I will think about that bastard&#8217;s baby later, I have to get my revenge and it will be hard for him. He has betrayed me in the worst possible way, and my revenge will be the worst that he could get. I will have to look on the internet for blogs about this subject, and see what I can come up with.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her mobile rang and she pulled it from her hand bag and saw that it was Nathan&#8217;s number; she knew that she would have to answer it. �Hello Nathan what do you want?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I was just ringing to say that I am in Doncaster, why didn&#8217;t you wake me this morning, before you went to work?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I got up late, and in my rushing about I forgot.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Ok love; I will be back on Thursday afternoon, see you then bye.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She turned her phone off and said �Fuck you as well.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That evening when Carman got home she walked up stairs and showered, then after drying herself, she walked back down and went on the computer. She typed in unfaithful, and then pressed search, and ended up with a load of rubbish. Then she typed in betrayed and pressed search once more and again she got a history lesson. She was saying to herself &#8216;think Carman think&#8217; then she went into advanced search and typed in marriage, unfaithful, betrayed and revenge. This gave her what she was looking for; blogs and adverts for the very thing she was looking for. She went down the list and spent hours looking for something to give her hope. Then she found what she thought was the very thing she was looking for.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;HOUSE OF CORECTION; has your man or woman been unfaithful, or have they betrayed you? This is a house of correction and we aim to please; mild or hard the guilty will be punished. Tell us your complaint, and then we will pick up the culprit in secrecy, he will then be brought to this school of discipline. We guarantee that he will be more submissive when he leaves here, and then he is yours to do with as you please. Two weeks is all it takes, and we can bring him back to you a different man; send your e mail now with your complaint, his name and type of punishment, and the first day of availability. If you have web cam, we allow you to speak with him every day to offer encouragement or abuse. Some of the implements used are the birch, strap and cane; these were all used at school on pupils in the sixty&#8217;s. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Carman wrote all her details down and sent the e mail. There was a reply almost immediately telling her the time and date of pick up. It also told her that she would receive an e mail, informing her how to send the six hundred pounds. She looked at the instructions, and spoke out loud. �That&#8217;s it you bastard, I always told you, that there would be no second chances, especially if you fucked about with another woman. Well your ass is going to be sore, and then I am going to kick you out of my life for good.� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Nathan arrived home about four in the afternoon, and was sitting waiting for Carman to come home. He must have dozed off, because the next thing was, that he heard a knock on the door, and it woke him up. He looked at the time and it was six, and he then wondered where Carman had got to. He stood up and walked to the door and opened it; there was a young woman at the door and he said, �Hello.� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Are you Nathan, only your wife has been involved in an accident, and we are from her works; if you come with us we will take you to the hospital?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh fuck, let me just get my jacket and shoes.� He walked back into the room. He came out very fast saying �I hope nothing bad has happened; she is pregnant.� He almost ran to the car �Pleases god let her be ok, please, please; I&#8217;ll go to church again, but please let her be ok.� He got into the open back door and sat in the seat, and it was then that something pricked his arm.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carman was at her friend Jill&#8217;s house until ten thirty in the evening and had just walked in the door. She could see that Nathan had arrived back at the house, and shouted his name but there was no reply, and she smiled. She walked over to the computer and switched it on, then looked at her e mail. There was one from the HOUSE OF CORECTION.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We have collected the unfaithful boy, and he will start his correctional training in the morning. You may speak to him by web/cam tomorrow evening at six.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With regards Mistress Donna
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carman laughed, and saying out loud �That will teach you to fuck with me you treacherous asshole. Now I am free of you, I will wait till you get home and then you will be out on your ass. I&#8217;ll bet your ass is going to be sore for the next ten days, and it&#8217;s a pity that I could not afford the other four days. That&#8217;s will be just about right, now I think about it, because you will come home five days after my birthday; we will have lasted two years to the day.� She laughed once more and went up the stairs to bed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathan opened his eyes and looked around, but there was nothing to see but a wall in front of him. He tried to move and found that he was held firmly in one position, and that was kneeling. His chest was resting on a flat leather surface, and his hands were strapped to the front ends of the bench that he was lay on. His legs were strapped slightly apart, and there felt as if there was a strap across his back. He was about to shout and found that there was a ball of some kind strapped into his mouth. He felt weak and drowsy and again he slipped back into a sleep.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was woken up with a shock, because there was a searing pain running through his body, and his eyes opened wide as a scream left his mouth, but only to be muffled by the gag in his mouth. Thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, the pain was excruciating and there were tears falling from his eyes. Nathan was also shouting on each stroke, and shouting for the pain to stop, but he knew that he was wasting his time shouting into a gag. He looked around, and saw through his tears several girls and they were all dressed in tight shorts and a bra, and knee length boots. The pain had stopped, and he heard footsteps walking at his side, and then coming towards his front. Then there was another but older woman that was standing in front of him, she was wearing a white shirt, fawn riding breeches, and brown riding boots. She was about twenty six to twenty eight in age and had short curly hair, she was good looking, and had from what Nathan could see a good figure. �So you are awake, you filthy piece of good for nothing weakling. I expect you are wondering where you are, well keep wondering because all I am going to tell you, is that for the next ten days you are mine to be punished. You are here because you have been unfaithful to your wife; she says that you have been fucking another woman; and that you have told her nothing but lies. So we have to be careful with you, and listen to nothing you say, because it is obvious that you cannot be trusted. She has paid a great deal of money for you to get your ass burnt, so screaming for mercy will not help. She will be talking to you by web/cam this evening, and then she can either say to you words of encouragement or give you abuse. But today you are going to receive your first lesson in being obedient. My name is Mistress Donna, and you will address me in no other way; you will always speak to me with respect, or you will get more of the same. After your punishment you will have the gag removed, and then you will thank me for your punishment; do you understand. She saw him nod his head; good then we will begin with something a little lighter than the cane, it&#8217;s so that we can build you up to the heavier equipment.� She looked at one of the girls and said �Bring me the flogger to start him off for the day.�&nbsp; Then once again she then walked behind him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�On the count of three� Nathan counted one, two, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack; some of the strokes were fierce, and some of the strokes he only just felt. Thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack; the strokes were being spread all over his back and thighs, and were now beginning to hurt. Thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack; he was now in pain, but he had been told that he would be here for the next ten days. He had to do what this woman says; but he asked himself &#8216;was he going to survive.&#8217; Thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack. 
�You must have really pissed your wife off, for her to ask for hard punishment.� He felt her run her hands over his back and thighs as if checking for bumps; thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack. There were only a few tears running from his eyes now, and he hardly made a sound, other than a grunt while being punished. Nathan heard the footsteps at his side once more, and then a hand touched his shoulder, and a voice saying �Your punishment is over for a few hours.� There were more footsteps, and then the Mistress was standing in front of him again. His gag was taken out of his mouth and he took a deep breath; �Have you anything to say to me slave?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Thank you for my punishment Mistress Donna.� &#8216;He had read books on Mistress&#8217;s, and they were not the type of people that you messed with, and there were certain ways you had to speak to them. He was racking his brains trying to think what they were.&#8217;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You&#8217;re welcome slave; you did well on your first session, but they will get progressively harder over the next few days. Is there anything you wish to say to me in your defence?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He looked at her and thought to himself &#8216;Carman has called me a liar, what could I possibly say to make this not happen?&#8217; �No Mistress Donna.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I do not understand you, are you saying you are guilty?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�With all due respects Mistress Donna, Carman has told you that I lied to her, and she has paid you to punish me for ten days. You have told me that if I beg for mercy there will be none forthcoming from you, so there is no point in saying anymore. I am at your mercy, and I will never beg for any; I have been convicted without trial, and I don&#8217;t know if I can ever forgive Carman for that. She only had to point the finger, and demand an answer from me, and I would never have denied her the truth.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Mistress was stunned into silence, and it was all because of his answer; he had taken her words and thrown them back by speaking the truth. But that would change after the first day, when he was in pain. We are going to unbuckle your bonds slave so that you can eat, are you going to try and escape?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He looked around at the girls all with canes in their hands, and said quietly �You have to be joking.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What did you say slave� The Mistress snapped?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Perish the thought Mistress Donna, it would never cross my mind, and I answer with the greatest respect.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unseen by Nathan, she gave a little smile then said, �Next time speak louder, so that I am able to hear you.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mistress Donna.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Also after the first mention of my name in the morning, you only have to call me Mistress.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mistress D....�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He saw her walk away and then his bonds being released; then a girl said �Stand up and move about.� He looked at her, and she too was holding a cane �With respect why are you holding the cane, as if you are going to strike me in a flash.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It is for my safety.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As Nathan stood up, he snatched the cane from her hand, and as she jumped back he smiled; he placed the cane on the bench saying �I have never struck a girl or woman in my life. I am locked up somewhere in the middle of Great Britain, surrounded by god knows how many women/girls carrying canes, and I&#8217;m naked and vulnerable, for god sake get real.� Nathan then bent down touching his toes, stretching his body trying to get rid of the stinging. Unknown to him the Mistress was watching on CCTV and just smiled. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The girl next to her asked �Shall I go down with her Mistress?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She smiled saying �No I don&#8217;t think that will be necessary, because the girl is quite safe.� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was about three hours after he had eaten, and Nathan was already strapped down for his next session, and the Mistress walked into the room where he was. She stood in front of him and said �You are going to get the flogger once more, and then this evening you will get the short strap. Fetch me the flogger girl.� Then once again it was brought to her.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Mistress walked to the side of him and out of sight, there was no gag in his mouth. �On the count of three slave� Nathan counted one, two, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack; the pain he was feeling was horrendous, and there were tears falling from his eyes, that he just could not hold back. Thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack; the strokes were no longer on his back, but on the soft flesh of his thighs. Thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack; he was hurting and the pain was the worst he had ever felt.� Are you in great pain slave?� She knew that he would be, because his body was now bright red as she never held back on any.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mistress.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Does this mean that you are begging me for mercy?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathan thought for a few seconds and asked himself; &#8216;why beg for something that I will never get.&#8217; �Would you grant me mercy if I asked Mistress?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mistress Donna laughed and answered �No�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Then I am not begging Mistress�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack; he was groaning loud on every stroke of the flogger, and everyone in the room could see that he was now in extreme pain. All the strokes were now landing on his buttocks covering where he was punished with the cane.&nbsp; �Are you going to beg me to stop slave; you never know I might just stop.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He could hardly speak now but he answered �No Mistress, you are only lying� his head dropped down and he was now crying. Thwack, thwack; he felt her hand touch his back, and she said �Your punishment is over slave.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Thank.... thank you Mist....� and his head flopped down once more.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He heard everyone leave the room, and he could not control his tears anymore; the pain he was feeling was too great. His whole body was tingling as if he had been stung with nettles. Nathan must have fallen asleep, because he felt a hand shaking his shoulder; he looked up and saw that it was one of the girls.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Wake up the Mistress will be here in a minute she told him.� &#8216;He was tired and weak, and he was wondering how much more he could take before he could take no more.&#8217;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Mistress walked in front of him; she looked at him and saw that he was now tired. How long he had been asleep, he had no idea; to Nathan time was not important anymore? 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;***
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carman had woken up and looked for Nathan, and then remembered what she had done to him; &#8216;well it served him right, a little bit of chastisement would not hurt him. His pain would never be as much, as the pain she felt now because of his betrayal. Still I will inform him of my intentions of throwing him out tonight, at six when he sees me on web/cam.&#8217; Today was Friday and an early finish at work; she would be home by three this afternoon, and then she could pack his bags.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was dinner time in the canteen, and she was sat next to Jill; �How are you getting on now that you have confronted Nathan?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I never confronted him, I sent him to a school of correction, and there he will get his ass spanked, and then I will throw him out when he returns. The fucking piss pot is going to get everything he deserves for doing that to me. I will be well rid of him that is for sure.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What about the baby; you will still have that around your neck to remind you?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh fuck yes, I had forgotten about that, and now I will have to think of what I am going to do.�&nbsp; Just then Don walked over to the table and sat with them, �Hello Don, what brings you to the table.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I was just wondering if you had told Nathan yet; I will come around with you if you think he might get punchy?� The three of them sat there talking for a good hour as Carman told them all the details. �Look, if your free tonight, why don&#8217;t you come out with me, you know I have always wanted to date you?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I couldn&#8217;t Don, it wouldn&#8217;t be right.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Of course you can Carman; you&#8217;re a free woman now.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well all right then but just this once.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was a few hours later when she was home indoors. She was packing all Nathans clothes into a suitcase; she suddenly remembered the web/cam. She walked over to the computer and turned it on.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;***
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well slave, you have just woken up in time, you will soon see your wife talk to you via the web/cam. I wonder if she will be giving you encouragement for you to carry on.� The Mistress nodded to one of the girls, and she brought a TV screen and placed it in front of Nathan. The screen came alive and he could see Carman staring back at him. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She started to speak to him �Hello Nathan, you treacherous piece of shit. Yes I know all about you, I have been shown pictures of you with another girl. Jill, my best friend has seen you kissing and canoodling with her, and you have been to her house shagging her. Well, let me put something into your head, we are not partners in marriage anymore. When you get back here, you can pick up your bags a fuck off out of my life. I am a free woman again, and as you were shagging around, so I will be doing the same from now on. I hope your ass is sore, I asked for hard, so when you get back here I will expect to see plenty of scars. You lying, cheating puddle of dogs piss. I don&#8217;t know whether I will be able to speak to you tomorrow night, because I am going out with Don Masters tonight, and you never know what might happen. He is going away Tuesday, so I have to get as much love as I can don&#8217;t you agree. I would wish you a good night; but I hope that it is going to be a painful night, you lump of shit.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathan shouted �No, no, no, please don&#8217;t? I have done nothing and I&#8217;ve been with no one; its lies you fool.� But the screen went blank.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The screen was taken away and he looked at the Mistress with more tears in his eyes �Please let me go, I haven&#8217;t done anything.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That is something I cannot do slave, you are mine for the next nine days, or if your wife shows you mercy. But the latter is out of the question, well it is from what I have just seen; she is really pissed off, and wants to see the marks over your body. Well I can assure you slave, that I will take great pleasure in doing exactly what she has demanded. Now someone fetch me the short strap.� The Mistress demanded.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Mistress went to his side once more and before she commenced a ball gag was inserted in his mouth. �These strokes will be all over your body, and I will not stop until you beg me to, slap, slap, slap, slap, slap, slap, slap, slap. He was now screaming on every stroke the pain was getting too much slap, slap, slap, slap, slap, slap, slap, slap. �Do you want me to stop slave� The Mistress asked? He was shouting yes through the gag and nodding his head; the Mistress laughed saying �Tough� Slap, slap, slap, slap. �Now do you want me to stop slave?� Once again he was screaming through the gag and nodding his head and again she laughed. Slap, slap, slap, slap, slap, slap, �Now do you want me to stop slave.� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A girl took the gag out of his mouth and he answered. �You have asked me twice already, and on screaming yes, and nodding my head, you laughed and said tough. No Mistress, please don&#8217;t ever think I am as stupid as Carman, I will never answer your questions ever again, so don&#8217;t ever ask me again. I would rather you didn&#8217;t waste your time, by asking me pointless questions. Neither will I thank you, for something I do not want or deserve.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You little cunt I will draw blood� slap, slap, slap, slap, slap, slap. Nathan screamed on every strike, slap, slap, slap, �Say thank you to me you asshole.� Nathan was shouting and screaming no more, but he shook his head from side to side. Slap, slap, slap, the whole room was looking at the Mistress, as she struck him a further three times, but Nathan had passed out. The Mistress looked down at his back, and could see the blood running from the cuts and wished she had not lost her temper. The whole room of women were looking at her, not knowing what to expect.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;***
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carman closed the computer down and smiled; that will give you something to think about for the next ten days you shit head. When you come back and show me the few welts that you have, then I will give you another with my hand across your face. Carman then walked up the stairs past the suitcase full of clothes and into her room. She found out her sexiest dress and laid it out on the bed, ready for when she had showered and put her makeup on. It was an hour later and she had put on the dress with holdup stockings, a thong and her best bra, topping it all off with her new three inch heels, that she had bought on the way home.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was a knock on the door, and she walked over and opened it. Don was standing there and said �Wow you look good enough to eat Carman, have you eaten yet. I thought I would take you for a meal, and then we can go to the dance club in the city.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No I haven&#8217;t eaten, and that would be great.� She turned and picked up her coat and bag from the hall, and then she walked out the door with him. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The restaurant was nice, and the meal and wine were to perfection; Don in her eyes knew how to entertain. Don was seducing her with his thoughtful and charming manner; and Carman loved everything that Don was doing for her. Nathan had never wined and dined her, and she was thinking that she could get used to this style of treatment. The dancing went on to the early morning, and she had a little more drink than she should have done, and although she was not drunk she was feeling a little light headed. It was two in the morning when he drove her back home, and then he walked her to her door. They stood for a few minutes talking about the evening, and then quite unexpectedly Don pulled her to him and kissed her on the mouth. She responded and placed her hands and arms around Dons back, he was making her feel like a girl on her first ever date. She reluctantly pulled away from him, but the wine was making her feel randy like all drink did to her. �Come inside she said, and we can talk some more� Knowing that she had no intentions of talking. He smiled at her as she unlocked the door, and after taking hold of his hand dragged him inside giggling.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She closed the door behind them and took off her jacket, and she kicked off her shoes, and she then walked to the lounge where Don had already entered. He was sitting on the couch as she stepped inside, and sat down beside him. He immediately turned and kissed her on the mouth and she responded in a like manner. His hands were running over her body, and she could feel that they were urgent hands exploring her body. She was feeling naked, as these fresh hands roamed over her chest taking in the fullness of her breasts, squeezing and fondling them through the thin material. It was giving her back her lost youth, when doing things like this were taboo; she and Nathan used to go for walks in the country, and have explorations of each other. Her heart had always been in her mouth, fearing that they would be caught, and it was the same feeling that she was getting now, but now she loved the moment. His hand was running up and down her legs, as they were both still in the same first embrace, exploring each other&#8217;s mouths with their tongues. Her hand slipped over to his groin area, and she could feel his aroused manhood through the material of his trousers. His hand had now slipped to the soft flesh of her inside thigh, and she could feel her dress was riding up, and she had opened her legs in anticipation of his hand going further. She was fumbling with his belt and then the zip, and once the fly was open she put her hand inside. She was now feeling the girth and length of his manhood, and both were much larger than Nathan. She started to wonder what this giant length of flesh would feel inside of her sex, and the thought was pushing her further into the depth of sexual depravity. Carman pulled away from his mouth, and slipped down kneeling on the floor between his legs, it was then that she noticed, that his shoes were already off. Looking around she saw that the blinds were closed, but could not remember doing so as she left the house. Turning to face the job in hand, she put her hands on the waist band of Don&#8217;s boxers, and pulled them slowly down and off his legs. Then once she had removed them from his body along with his trousers, she discarded them to one side. She looked at the proud flesh that was staring her in the face, and although she had never done the deed with Nathan, she opened her mouth and took the shaft inside. She could feel the blood pulse beating against the inside of her mouth and against her soft lips; the deed was to her repulsive, but at the same time electrifying. She felt Don&#8217;s Hands, resting on the sides of her head, guiding her head in up and down motions, and she knew that she was fucking a man with her mouth for the first time. Don had lain back with his head on the back of the couch, and he had his eyes closed making groans of ecstasy, then Carman felt the explosion inside her mouth and tried to pull away. Don was having none of that and said �Swallow it lover like all good girls do.� He heard her gulp and then he pulled out looking at her mouth he said �Now lick your lips and show me how much you like it.� She wanted to please him and complied with his wishes, and after looking up at his face and smiled. �Take your clothes of lover, and show me what you look like underneath your protection.� As if in a dream she stood up facing him and after unzipping her dress let it drop to the floor, her bra and briefs followed, and standing naked in front of him made her feel embarrassed. By this time he had taken the rest of his clothes off, and he too was as naked as she was now. She slipped a leg either side of his and eased herself forward, then once she felt the tip of his manhood at her entrance pushed slowly down. The giant penis was big and it hurt, but she put her hand in her mouth and with her saliva lubricated the end. She pushed again and felt it enter a little, then lifted and dropped a little further. Carman did this several times before the whole of the ten inches were deep inside her; she knew that her sex had never been this stretched before. Now she was into a steady rhythm and as she was lifting her body up and down, Don was pushing up to meet her. It was not long before she felt her fluids flowing, and not long after there was another explosion deep inside of her. She collapsed onto the couch and fell beside Don; he was also tired from the sex. They must have fell asleep because she woke up to find him dressed and ready to leave.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Where are you going Don; you don&#8217;t have to leave because Nathan won&#8217;t be back?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I have to, because I have to be in the city by seven am tomorrow, to pick up a new truck for a friend.� He walked over and kissed her saying �I will be around tomorrow night if you want me to.� Without saying a word she stood up and kissed him tenderly on the lips pressing her naked body against his. �I will take that as a yes lover, and I will be around about eight; if you like we can stay in and mess around?� He saw her smile once more and added �I will take that as a yes also.� Then he kissed her once more while his hand went to her sex, and when he pulled away he said �Keep that warm for me.� Then he left the room.










CHAPTER TWO

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathan woke up and he was still strapped down in the punishment room, it was dark and he had no idea what the time was. He then felt soft hands running over his back but although they were gliding over his welts he could feel no pain. The coolness of the touch was soothing, and he could feel his pain slipping away, and then a woman&#8217;s voice said �You must hold your tongue Timothy, it is better to say nothing, rather than wake the anger of the Mistress. You are doing so well, but you must go to sleep Timothy, I will be looking after you. I will always be here to take your pain away from your body and your pain is my pain, and your marks will disappear in time.� He could smell her perfume, and he felt her kiss him on the shoulder. His eyes closed, and again drifted to sleep, but this time it was deep and peaceful. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was some time later when he woke up, and then recalled what had took place during the night. &#8216;He was asking himself whether he had been dreaming about what happened, but it seemed so real. He was beginning to wonder what was install for him, what pain would he have to endure today, and could he take whatever it was. He had a thousand thoughts going through his mind, and it was just as the room was about to become alive once more. Why had Carman done this to him? Surely he had done nothing to warrant this type of punishment, and she was throwing him out for no reason. Then he thought about Don, surely she would not be fooling with him, and she was only saying that to frighten him. She wouldn&#8217;t really go with Don, not until she heard him explain away her evidence.&#8217; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The light came on, and the Mistress was standing in front of him once more, she looked at him and asked �Do you want to tell me the truth about your affair?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �I have not had an affair with anyone Mistress, also what is the point of you asking, when telling you that I had one, which I never have; wouldn&#8217;t stop me getting beat by you. You are only asking me for your own perverted curiosity.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�So you still want to keep it a secret; well today you will tell me all your secrets, because I will be punishing all the soft parts on your body. Your back is nicely scarred, and will be even worse by the time we get half way; your wife will not be disappointed in my work that is for sure. Now come on girls, get to work turn him around and let&#8217;s get started; today I will be able to see his fear and watch his pain.� There was already a ball gag placed in his mouth, it was being done as the Mistress talked to him, and when she stopped they unstrapped his legs and arms. He was lifted off the bench, and then taken to what looked like a table that was three feet in height; at one end there were two aluminium posts sticking up, and at the other there was a wooden block. The girls roughly handled him, and he was almost thrown on the table the table was shaped like a T; his head was at the top of the T and his legs were at the bottom between the poles. His arms were stretched out and strapped at the wrists; then his legs were lifted up and the ankles were strapped to the top of the poles. There were also straps at the knees, and then the poles were pulled out wide at the top so that his legs were now spread. His head was resting on the block, and that had a strap pulled over his forehead, and it was keeping his head in one position. Then there was another strap over his belly, and that one went around the table also rendering him immobile. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Mistress walked up to the table, and was looking at him from between his legs; then she looked down at his manhood. It was a formidable size but not the world&#8217;s biggest, it was about average between seven and nine inches. He could see her looking at it, and he tried to wriggle in his bonds; she looked up at his face, and realised what he was thinking. She smiled and was about to torture him, but something stopped her and she was unsure what. �Don&#8217;t worry; I shall not be touching that, well at least not yet if I touch it at all. I should, because that is the thing that you have been thinking with; it is because of that thing you are here.� There was fear in his eyes, and she had never seen that in any of her clients; but they were all masochists, and they needed the boost of pain.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She picked up the flogger, and walked to the top part of his body; he then heard the flogger moving through the air, thwack, and then the pain on his muscles of his arm. Thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, �I&#8217;ll bet you never thought there could be that much pain,&nbsp; I wouldn&#8217;t do that to you slave? Well let me tell you something about my establishment, I am a sadist; I like inflicting pain on others. All these girls that you see here, have at one time or another been beaten into submission by men; so it will be no good looking to any of them for mercy, because they hate men. You really are in the shit aren&#8217;t you little boy? Now your head is strapped so that it cannot move, so here&#8217;s how it will work today; lift your eyes up to say yes, and left to right means no. Do you understand?� She saw his eyes lift and smiled saying �Good we now understand each other. How old are you slave nineteen?� She saw his eyes go from side to side �Well I don&#8217;t think you are older so how about eighteen.� At that his eyes lifted up. �So you are eighteen, and you are fucking your wife about already; she has caught you out just in time. She could have had children with you and then found out, and then she would have been in a right mess wouldn&#8217;t she?� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Still I will give you more little talks as the days progress� thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, the flogger was now stinging his arms and the tears were starting to fall. �Look girls this weakling is starting to cry once more.� The girls all laughed �Well he will cry a river before I have finished with him.� Thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, the Mistress was alternating between arms and the more she struck the tender soft flesh he screamed. Thwack and again he screamed and nearly passed out, she had brought the flogger down in his armpit, and three more to the same place; thwack, thwack, thwack. �Now are you going to confess to fucking another girl slave, and relieve your pain?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &#8216;Nathan was trying to work out, what it was that he had done wrong, or who he was meant to be fucking with. He also knew that if he knew and told the Mistress, she would only laugh and carry on; he was doomed whatever he said.&#8217; His eyes went from side to side.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �You are a stupid little fool aren&#8217;t you, well I gave you a chance, but she also knew that he was thinking clearly. Thwack; once again he screamed as the flogger fell on the other armpit. Thwack, thwack, thwack, the pain was on top of pain now and he was screaming on each stroke, and all the time he was looking at the Mistress smiling at his discomfort. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Mistress had stopped and was looking at him; there had been a lot of men in her establishment over the years. Most had been sent by their wives for correction, but most stayed only a few days, and most were on soft punishment. What had this boy done that had been so bad, to deserve the punishment that he was receiving? On a soft punishment he would only have received the cane twice a day, but this Carman wanted scars, and she had paid the extra to see them. Well she looked at his body, and it was a mess, and there were scars all over it. His back was an absolute mess, and would take many weeks to heal up and disappear, but he was young and his flesh would heal fast. The venom in which his wife had spoken to him last night, was without a doubt, final.&#8217;&nbsp; He was still looking up at her with his eyes wide open when she lifted the flogger once more, and she saw him close his eyes and scream long before it had started to fall. She brought the flogger down on his muscle and put the flogger down. She then said �Your punishment is over until your second of the day.� She nodded to the other girls, and they walked out of the room leaving him once again by himself.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;***
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#8216;Carman opened her eyes and remembered what she had done the previous evening. She knew that she had been drinking, and had done things that she had never done before. Nathan had asked her to give him oral sex on many occasions, but she had always been repulsed by the idea. She also knew that he always did it to her, and she loved the sensation better that normal sex. Last night she was fucked by a giant piece of manhood, and it had been great from the bit she could remember. How could Nathan ever be that good after Don; fuck Nathan he would not be touching her sex ever again. He would be getting his ass spanked by now, because when asked if she only wanted him punished once a day, she had said no three times a day. It was her birthday on Monday and so too was Nathan&#8217;s; she laughed thinking again of Nathan; happy birthday Nathan.&#8217; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carman went shopping and met her friend Jill they walked around most of the day and ended up going in the cafe for dinner. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�How were things between you and Don last night; did he give you a good night?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes it was marvellous; I have never had a better evening not even with Nathan. I had some brilliant sex that Nathan could never compete with; it was the difference between a man&#8217;s dick and a boys. �
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Should you be saying this; I mean it is a bit humiliating for Nathan when everyone finds out that he has a small penis.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�The hell I should worry; he has humiliated me by doing what he has been doing with Nancy Bolter. I packed all his clothes last night, and they are down stairs waiting for him to come home and pick up. Well after you told me that you had seen them kissing and canoodling, you didn&#8217;t expect me to stay with him did you? Nathan is now history, what did you think that I was going to do, let him back into my life after what you and Don told me?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No, I just didn&#8217;t think that you would go to the extremes that you have; two years you were married, I would have thought it would have meant more to you than that. You were going out with him for the three years you were at school, and you were two years older than he was then.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That was probably the trouble, I went with him while he was too young and you know that girls mature earlier than boys. Nathan after all that time and the two years almost we were married, he is still not mature enough to make a commitment and stick with it.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;***
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#8216;Nathan was now in fear of his life, although the Mistress told him that he would be free in ten days. He was unsure whether he could last that long; and now he was feeling very lonely. At every sound his heart was jumping, thinking that it was the Mistress coming back to give him another hiding. He looked at the ceiling, and the intricate design around the edges, and tried to think where he had seen that before; there were also chandeliers; that were hanging from the ceiling high up that he recognised, but where had he seen them before. The panelled walls, every other section had a cross in the middle, and the others ones had rosettes. His body was stinging, and if it was not for the natural deep sleep he was getting, he would have caved in to the brutality. &#8216;The woman, who was she and where did she come from, and how did she know his other name was Timothy, he had told no one except his father and he was dead?&#8217;&nbsp; He kept searching his brain, looking for the reason Carman had sent him to where he was now; but there was nothing that he could think of. In fact there was nothing that could warrant a slap around the face, let alone this extreme pain. The door opened and a girl walked in; she walked over to the table and looked down at Nathan. She could not have been much older than he was, and she smiled towards him. She walked over and behind him, and started to touch the welts on Nathans arms, but it was not cruel but a gentle touch. Her hands were travelling the lengths of his arms and her touch was soothing. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Mistress was watching it all on CCTV and smiling once more. The girl with her asked �Shall I go down and get her Mistress; you know that Penny has a dislike towards boys and men. She has this thing about all men being guilty of something, and you know she would rip their heads off for nothing. The last boy/man that was in that position was clawed to pieces by her if you remember; and it was just because he was in bondage and she could.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mistress Donna looked up at her then back to the screen; Penny was just massaging Nathans arms when she touched a tender cut. He sighed and a tear came from his eye, and when Penny saw it she picked up a bit of tissue and wiped it away. Then she gave him another smile, and walked out of the room. The Mistress was stunned to say the least, and the girl asked �Did that really happen, or was I dreaming Mistress?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�So Penny senses that he is not dangerous, and she must feel that there is a lot of good in him. But no matter he has to be punished, and it is now that time a day and time for his second session.� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Mistress walked into the room, and as she did so Nathan started to tremble uncontrollably, and she could see that absolute fear was once more in his face. She picked up the flogger and walked to the side of the table; Nathan saw her raise her hand and closed his eyes. Thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, �I&#8217;ll bet you were not expecting it there were you� and she laughed a cruel laugh. Nathan was screaming through the gag, the strokes had been hard all over his belly. Thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, �Now confess to being unfaithful she shouted at him.� She was looking into his eyes, and he could not think of anything to confess too; his eyes moved from side to side then closed them. The Mistress moved to the other side of him saying �You must love pain you foolish boy.� Thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, he was screaming but now there was no noise because his voice had gone. There were tears running down his face, and he was in so much pain that he was unsure he would last this session. Thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, �That is this session over with.� Nathan was tired and weak, and it was then that he realised apart from the breakfast yesterday morning he had eaten nothing. The Mistress walked to his side and asked if there was anything he wanted? &#8216;He looked at her still with fear in his eyes, and thought I have to keep my strength. If I was going to get food they would have fed me he thought; maybe that is all part of the punishment. He could die here and no one would notice, and no one would care; he started to cry and closed his eyes.&#8217; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The mistress walked away and went back to her room, and sat down looking at Nathan&#8217;s still body on the TV screen.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;***
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carman was still in town getting shopping for the week, and because there was no Nathan to look after it was less. Every time she thought about Nathan she smiled to herself and thought, &#8216;the fucking loser. I always told him there were plenty of other fish in the sea, now he has found that out to be correct.&#8217; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While she was in the super market two friends of hers came and talked to her. �Hello Carman; I hear you&#8217;ve chucked Nathan out. Jill said it was because he was not man enough for keeping you happy; is that right he had a little dick? She also told us that you were sleeping with Don; for fucks sake you must have been desperate for sex.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I don&#8217;t know why Jill should say that to you, I never said he was not man enough for anything.� &#8216;She was feeling a little guilty that Jill was going around saying that to all her girl friends. Nathan would never be able to show his face again as all his friends would be pointing the finger and laughing. But if they were taking that as the reason, then they had no idea that he had humiliated her by fucking Nancy Bolter.&#8217;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Come on tell us the truth, you know we won&#8217;t say a word to anyone. Carman knew that to be a lie, because these two were the biggest gossips in the town; if she told them anything then it would be all around the town by Tuesday. Then she thought that might not be a bad idea, at least it will not make her look bad.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes that&#8217;s correct it was small, in fact I was always faking it and he thought he was the bees knees. You know what simple minds do, and they believe all you tell them. He was no good in bed, and that&#8217;s the truth.� She looked at her watch and added �I have to get home to make a call soon; I will see you next week at work.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;***

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathan was sitting in a chair by the panelled wall, and in front of him was a woman with a whip in her hand, she was tall and facing away from him. She was dressed in a long dress that was below her knees, and long leather boots on her feet. There was a man a few feet in front of her, and he was growling as if he was a dog, he was spitting and shouting. The man was naked and was standing with his arms and legs outstretched, the wrists and ankles were cuffed to each corner of the frame he was standing inside. Then every so often he would throw his head forward, his mouth would be open and then he would snap it closed as if he were trying to bite the woman. She never moved, and it was as if she had seen all this before and no matter what this man did, he could not shock her. There was another person in the room, and he moved into view with what looked like a dog muzzle in his hand. The second man walked behind the naked man, and the muzzle was thrown over his head and buckled at the back. The naked man was still pulling at his bonds, and screaming through the muzzle, but Nathan could no longer see his mouth. What he could see, and it was from the distance away that he was, were the man&#8217;s eyes staring back at him, but he could also see another set of eyes inside them. The woman turned to him and smiled, and he recognised her from somewhere, but had no idea where. He felt himself nod his head, and the woman smiled once more and turned to face the man. Although it was a fearsome sight that he was looking at, he never felt frightened or in danger
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The woman threw the whip out in front of her, and then he watched her draw it back at speed, and then forward. Crack, he saw the whip bite into the flesh, and the man gave out a bloodcurdling scream, but there was no mark on his body where the whip had touched, and as this woman drew back the man started to laugh hysterically. Crack; and the whip struck him once more and he was now whimpering like a puppy, but his head was to the side and he was slyly looking at her. Crack, the woman carried on regardless of his noises coming from his mouth, but Nathan could see that there were still no marks on his body. The woman struck the naked man several more times, but each time she did so he laughed like the madman he seemed. She then coiled the whip and walked towards the wall.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathan could hear movement all around him, and his eyes opened and there in front of him was the screen once more. He wondered what she was going to talk about; he was wondering if there would be a bit of love in her voice tonight. The Mistress walked into the room and looked at her watch; it is time switch on the screen. There was just a blank screen then Carman&#8217;s face appeared. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Hello Dogs piss. I was not going to speak with you tonight, but so much has happened since I have been free of you, and got you out of my hair. Well where shall I start, oh yes, I know, last night; I told you I had a date with Don Masters, well what a date it turned out to be. He came and picked me up at eight and took me to that new restaurant in the city; he dined me out on wine and a meal, and it was great. Then afterwards, we went to the city night club and danced until two in the morning. It was when he brought me home that things started to get heated; I let him come inside for a coffee, and you know how it is. He walked straight into the lounge and sat down on the couch, and I walked in and sat down beside him.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know why but I leaned over and kissed him on the mouth, and he kissed me back a deep sexual kiss.� 
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Mistress was looking at Nathan and there were tears running down his face; there were more tears now than when she was beating him. 
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Then I felt his hands all over my breast, and you know how I like my breasts fondled. I slipped my hand down to his trousers and felt his manhood and wow it was so much bigger than yours. Anyway off came his boxers and trousers, and I grasped it in my hand or rather hands. By this time I was on my knees between his legs, and I just for the life of me don&#8217;t know what came over me. Well you know what you have always asked me to do during sex, and I have refused, well last night it happened? He never asked, I just fed that long shaft of flesh into my mouth, and I sucked for all I was worth. Then it happened as he was holding the back of my head; he came in my mouth, and he said if I really loved him, I was to swallow and lick my lips. Well you see my lips are clean; I then put one of my legs either side of his legs, and then I sat down but it hurt, and his manhood was stretching my sex. He had to be the best part of ten inches and thicker than your tiny thing. We went at it for a long time and fell asleep on the couch; it had to be the best sex that I have ever had. He will be here again tonight and I might have another bit of fun. Not like the fun you and I had, but real man and woman fun.� 
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All the time Carman was talking the Mistress was looking at Nathan; the block that his head had been resting on was drowned. 
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Today I went to town and saw my friend Jill and it was her that told me all about you, and how she had seen you kissing and canoodling with this other girl. She asked me if Don was any good in bed, and I told her that he was a lot better than you; I also told Sonya and Ann that your manhood was small, and I had to fake it. So by Monday that will be all around town; well it&#8217;s better for you to be made a fool of, than them knowing you went and fucked another woman, because you thought she was better. Well, I have to leave you now only my lover will be around soon, and you never know what I might get up to.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Mistress turned to Nathan who was still crying and trembling and decided that she would not prolong his pain tonight. Carman had not hurt Nathan, she had destroyed him. She walked over to the table and picked up the flogger and said �On the count of three� but it was because she knew that Nathan in his sorrow had not heard her. Thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, she had been striking his inner thigh and now she walked around the table; thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack. �That is your punishment over for today slave.� One of the girls unstrapped his forehead and then took the ball gag out of his mouth. �Is there anything you would like to say slave� The Mistress asked.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Through his tears he said, �I have had no food since breakfast yesterday, am I permitted to have any?� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Mistress shouted �You mean to say, he has had no food since yesterday morning, tell the cook to make him a hot meal. Then when he has eaten put him on the recovery table to sleep; get him a blanket and pillow he is not an animal. The women were looking at her in shock, because she has never spoke like this to them before. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Do we strap him down Mistress� one of the girls asked? 
�No� The Mistress snapped as she walked out of the room. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Up in her room Belle was waiting; �You cut that a bit short Mistress.� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes I just hadn&#8217;t got the heart to destroy him further; whatever possessed her to talk about sex with another. He has only been here two days, and she has packed his bags and sucked a man&#8217;s cock. Then she has told everyone that he is not man enough for the job of satisfying her; she has also told girls that his manhood is tiny. She has humiliated him beyond the normal, just so that she can save face. Whatever has he done that is so terrible, that he deserved this kind of treatment? For two days she tortured his brain; he is hurting more from what she said, than I have over the last two and a half days.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Food had arrived down in the punishment room and put on a table. Nathan was being helped to the table; �Look at this Belle.� It was Penny that was helping him move slowly to the table, and after he sat down she sat opposite. He picked up the knife and fork, and his hands were shaking so much, that he could not hold them still enough to cut up his food, and they dropped onto the table with a clang. Penny picked them up and cut the food up for him, then putting the knife down fed him slowly with the fork. �I think Belle; that she has seen that the same thing is happening to him, as happened to her; he is getting beat through no fault of his own, and I think the same as her too. If he had done anything then why don&#8217;t he confess; he would still get beat, but at least he would be free of me keep asking him. He is clever and not stupid as one would think, and he knows what I am saying is true. I think we will just leave things as they are and see what tomorrow night brings. He will only have two punishments tomorrow and that will be the short whip front and rear.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;***
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carman was sitting in doors when the bell rang, and as she stood up she could see Don&#8217;s car at the gate. She straightened her clothes and walked to the door in anticipation of the night ahead. She opened the door and smiled at him saying �Come on in Don you are a bit late and I was wondering if you were going to come.� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I had forgot, it was my turn to go over my grandparents house and help them back up the stairs; they can get down easily enough in the morning, but getting back up then they need help. Because I have no idea how to do it properly my sister helps; anyway enough about me. You look absolutely fantastic; have you had a good day lover, and he kissed her on the cheek?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That was something that Nathan never did; he just came home expecting his food to be on the table. Don was treating her better than Nathan ever did; he was making her feel like a woman again. He was doing things naturally without thinking, and his love was real and not a show. There were a lot more things about Don; that pleased her better than Nathan ever could. �Do you want a drink Don� she asked �There is some beer in the fridge?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes I would love one lover.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carman pulled a can from the fridge and shouted �Do want a glass Don?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No in the can will do.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carman gave him the can of beer and sat down at Don&#8217;s side. He drank the beer down in one long sip, as if her were pouring it down his throat. Then after putting the can down he turned to face her then kissed her on the lips; �I just can&#8217;t think why Nathan would go and do what he did for. You are a beautiful woman, and I think I am lucky to be going with you, now that rat has been fucked off. Tell me you&#8217;re going to stay with me once this is all over, and he has been blown away.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Of course I will at least I can trust you to stand by me; you have been at my side ever since I found out about Nathan. I could not ask for a better friend and companion than you.� She then leaned over and kissed him open mouth and his hands once more started to roam over her body. Carman was also getting feelings of sexual desire and her hand went down to his groin; once again she felt his manhood starting to stir. She took hold of his hand as she stood up as he rose to his feet; then Carman led him up the stairs to the marital bedroom. Don knew what this was all about, and started to strip off all his clothes; he had his eyes on her body all the time she was stripping. Once complete, she walked forward pushing her naked body next to his; slipping her arms around his body and sliding her hands all over his back and buttocks feeling his growth of hair. His hands were doing the same with her body, but his arms were long, and as they were roaming over her buttocks he could touch her sex from behind. She opened her legs to give him a better access, and all the time he was doing this they had been kissing with their tongues, exploring like first time lovers. Carman stepped back and took hold of his penis in both of her hands; then as she slowly rubbed the flesh with one hand, her other was playing with the immense amount of hair on his chest. She was playing with it because, it was something that Nathan had none of; Don was very manly in every way. Carman let go of his penis and slipped down onto her knees, then took it once more in her hands, and started to lick the sides as if it were an ice lolly. Then she took the bulbous head and fed it into her mouth, sucking and slurping on the rod of flesh. As she was doing these ministrations she could hear Don catch his breath several times. Long before he came this time, he lifted her to her feet, and after turning her around he gently pushed her back on the bed. Carman was now on her back with her feet still touching the floor. Don fell to his knees and parted her legs, showing him her open sex and he trimmed pubic area. His head slipped down and he kissed the insides of her thighs and then to the entrance to her sex. His tongue darted out and touched the outer lips, and then with open mouth and his tongue licking hard he feasted on her body. Carman was now wriggling about trying to push her sex into his mouth, and it was not long before she fed him her sexual fluid; Don in turn was drinking it as if his life depended on it.&nbsp; He then lifted his head after licking her clean, and slipped once more up the bed, and as he was doing this Carman was herself pushing her body up the bed. Don was now looking down at her, with his body hanging over hers and she could feel the tip of his penis pushing at her entrance. The flesh entered her sex just a little then pulled out; then a second time it went a little deeper. Her face was contorted with pain, as Don pushed his giant penis in, until she felt his scrotum touched her flesh. He then got into a memento and built up a steady rhythm, and he now lifted her legs up and splayed them wide. He was now going deeper than he did the night before, and her orgasm was once again very close. But this time Don beat her to it and he shot his load deep into her body, then moments later she reached her climax. He fell down beside her and put his arm over her body, and his eyes closed into a light sleep.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#8216;Carman was still awake thinking that things could not get any better for her; she had got rid of a piece of dead meat, and was now with a person that is alive. Then again Nathan was a good lover, but not as good as Don; Nathan took his time where Don was a fast mover. There was nothing the two had in common, and when it came to size and penetration Don won hands down. Don was right; it was Nathan that was a loser for mistreating her loyalty. What she couldn&#8217;t understand was why; the sex they were having was good and on a regular basis. Whatever made him run to another person; Nancy Bolter of all people? Carman was feeling good and she started thinking about Nathan; he really wasn&#8217;t as bad as she was making out. He had never shouted or raised his voice even when they had been arguing; she also knew that when she was on the wrong side of the argument, he had always let her win. That was his only downfall; he was too soft and always let her have her own way. But he was wrong in doing what he did, and she thought that as it was his birthday on Monday she might give him a little treat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carman looked around at Don and saw that his manhood was limp and decided that it needed help to recover. She turned on her side and reached out taking hold of his manhood and started to play with it. She could feel that it was starting to liven up when she felt it twitch, and it brought a smile to her face. She started to massage the stem of flesh, feeling all the time that it was getting harder; she heard Don give a little groan but on looking noted that he was still fast asleep. His manhood was now hard as a bullet, and she leaned over and put her mouth around it, and then started to fuck him with her mouth. He was still asleep but his body was moving to the rhythm involuntary; the word oh yes was slipping from his lips as he slept. While she was sucking at his flesh, she was also massaging his balls, and all of a sudden his body jerked, and she heard him catch his breath; then there was an almighty explosion when his cum filled her throat, and she swallowed the lot. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Don was still fast asleep still, and Carman smiled thinking &#8216;I never had this much fun with Nathan. Then again I would not perform this act with Nathan, I always denied him. Then she had a thought, surely it was not that fact that made him go to another woman? Why am I doing this with Don, yet I would not do it with Nathan; and for the first time she had a pang of guilt.&#8217; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Don woke up and looked at his dick that was standing proud then at Carman; �Did you do that?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good lord no it came alive by itself.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well I&#8217;m telling you that I have had the strangest dream ever; I dreamt that you were giving me another blow job.� His hand went to her groin and felt how wet she was �Well there is not a lot of point wasting such a beautiful hard dick, and it&#8217;s your turn to do the honours while I play with your tits.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carman giggled, and told him he was wicked, and slipped over to put her leg over his body, and then she slipped her body up his chest. Both his hands travelled up the side of her body stopping on the top of her breasts. He was now teasing the nipples with his finger and thumb, and she had her hands behind her holding on to his manhood. Letting go of his manhood she leaned forward so that her breasts were just above his face, and like all men that maternal instinct took over, and he sucked on a nipple. Then she went even lower and his face was now buried between both breasts, and he was pushing them against the side of his face because he could not get enough of them. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once again Carman took the lead, and slipped her buttocks down off of his chest until she felt the tip of his penis. She put her hand down between her legs and guided him in, then pushed down slowly, taking a little at a time until it was in all the way. Then she started to lift and drop her body, while Don was playing with her breasts still. She knew it would not take long but what surprised her, was the fact that Don was first to climax. Carman kept up the rhythm for a little longer, and then she too climaxed and fell on top of Don, it was the best sex ever. A few moments later she slipped off of him, and lay at his side on her back, she too fell asleep.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathan once again felt the hands running all over his body, and they were travelling over the places where the Mistress had struck. His eyes were closed and it seemed as though he could not open them. �You are doing so well Timothy and i am so proud of you, but there is further pain to come both in your mind and heart, as well as on your body. You must listen to all that i tell you in the days to come, as you have now started to get your mind back. Once your mind is full once again you will find your destiny, and i will never leave your side. Trust me Timothy, because you now need me more than ever. I have taken away your pain once more, and so you must sleep and be fit for the whip you shall have tomorrow.� Nathan felt his eyes getting heavy once more even though they were not open, and he drifted into another deep sleep.
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathan was once again sitting in the chair by the wall, and again he was looking at the woman with the whip. The naked man was hanging from the frame now, and gone was the smugness and contempt that he had shown. There was no more screaming and shouting, there was nothing ear piercing in silence, the face showed the withdrawn face of a man that was subdued, and was now leaving himself to the mercy of this fearsome woman. The head shot up fast and the eyes looked at Nathan, but no longer did they have the sparkle of earlier, the eyes inside the eyes were now but pinpricks, and the end was near. The woman threw the whip forward once more, and in an instance the whip struck his body six times in quick succession. A light appeared in the wall that he was leaning against, and the naked man screamed, but only for a short time and then the light went out. The woman pointed at the wall and a dark hole appeared and three Monks with red habits on walked out, and then after taking the man from his bonds they placed him on a stretcher. As the first two monks walked out through the hole, the third one crossed himself and looked to be blessing the woman, he then walked through the hole and the woman made it disappear.



















CHAPTER THREE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was morning and Nathan was face down on his belly, and he was looking around the room, and could see the array of equipment. Some of it was frightening, and others he knew from first hand; he now knew where he seen the design on the ceiling before. He smiled to himself and slipped off the table, and although he was in a lot of pain he started to do exercises. He knew he had to stay subtle to survive another seven and a half days; he was doing sit-ups and toe touching by standing up and touching his toes. He had no idea that he was being watched by the Mistress on the CCTV. He saw the pictures on the wall, and walked over to them there were two of them, and after looking at them he smiled, and then he went back to the table and lay down.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�He does not seem too worried about his situation Mistress; he is making you look a fool.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No, he isn&#8217;t Belle; he knows that to survive the next few days he has to be in good condition, but he is very weak. His strength is ebbing and he will soon lose his will power to carry on. We have had them all here over the years; strong, arrogant, big heads and big mouths, and they have all fell to pieces by my hand. However it will not be my hand that brings him down to his knees; it will be his wife. She is eating into his brain, and he cannot push her words out of his mind. Make sure he has breakfast today, because yesterday was well out of order, and show him the way to the latrine.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathan was still on the table when the door opened, and a girl walked in with his breakfast. The Mistress was still watching as Penny walked in with his breakfast, and stepped over to the table. �Should someone be with Penny Mistress, while Penny is with him?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No, they are both fine; and nothing will happen.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathan slipped off the table and walked over to the food, and sat down there was a bowel of cornflakes and a glass of water. He picked up the spoon and his hand was still shaking, when he was in fear his hands always trembled. He put the spoon back down and then tried again, and it was even worse now, and he put the spoon down once more and tears came to his eyes. Penny picked up the spoon and smiled, then fed him once more, all the time he was being fed there were tears falling, and the Mistress was watching asking herself &#8216;why had Penny taken to Nathan. The Mistress knew what Nathan&#8217;s trouble was, because Penny was so scared when she was brought to the house, she could not hold her spoons. Penny&#8217;s husband had caned her to within a heartbeat of her life, before he was locked up; Penny came to the house to get better. But this was the first time that she had shown any progress towards getting better.&#8217;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Penny took hold of his hand and walked him to the toilet; ten minutes later she brought him back to the punishment room. She walked him over to a Saint Andrews cross and strapped him down; then just before she left his side, she kissed him on the cheek. The Mistress and Belle looked at each other and Belle asked �Has Penny got a crush on the slave Mistress?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�In all the time Penny has been here she has never got that close to a woman, let alone a boy. I think it is a good time to go down to the punishment room and get started. It was ten minutes later when she walked through the door, and then stepped over to where Nathan was strapped in. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathan was looking back at the Mistress, and there was something strangely familiar about her. A female voice said, �You will not need the ball gag this morning Timothy because I will look after you.� 
He looked around sharp in all directions and asked �Is that you Mother?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Mistress looked at him and asked �What.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I wish you a good morning Mistress Donna.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This kind of respect was something that she never expected �Good morning to you slave. I am going to use the whip on you today and it is painful. So now that you know the punishment do you want a gag?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No Mistress, I will be fine.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was not the answer that she expected but she did ask �So be it, slave� The Mistress walked over to the wall and took down the short whip. He watched her draw it back and snap, snap, snap, snap, snap, snap. There was no specific target and the end of the whip was landing everywhere and anywhere. Snap, snap, snap, snap, snap, snap, Nathan was only giving a small grunt on every stroke but it was not loud. Snap, snap, snap, snap, snap, snap, the strokes that were hurting the most were the ones that landed near his groin and on the inside of his thighs. Snap, snap, snap, snap, snap, snap, he was openly crying because of the pain but he didn&#8217;t care anymore. Snap, snap, snap, snap, snap, snap, the Mistress put down the whip and walked towards Nathan. She gently ran her hand over some of the places where the strokes had made contact and looked him in the eye. �You have done well slave, and your punishment for this morning is over; have you anything to say to your Mistress?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Thank you Mistress Donna.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You&#8217;re welcome slave; now rest for there is only one more punishment today and that will be before you wife talks to you.� Then to the women �Take him down and lay him on the recovery table and there is no need to strap him down.� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After the Mistress walked out of the room the women released him from his bonds. Because of the strokes that landed on his inner thighs he was having trouble walking. At the table he had trouble lifting his leg because he was so weak, and one of the girls lifted them up for him. Nathan lay on his back and fell asleep; it was a disturbed sleep and the Mistress&#8217;s smiling face kept appearing, and then fading back into the darkness. Every time the face appeared, she said, �Don&#8217;t worry Timothy� and then told him, that it was going to be all right, and she was looking after him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;***
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carman woke up and found she was alone and was feeling pleased with herself. Last night was the best sex she had ever had; that loser Nathan could never match the performance of Don. The man was just unstoppable when it came to sex, and she threw back the covers she got a shock; the sheets were covered in blood. Carman screamed and went to the toilet and when she came back she felt very weak; putting her nightgown on she walked down the stairs to the phone. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The doctor arrived and told her to rest for the remainder of the day; he also told her that he was only ninety five percent certain but he thought she had miscarried. At first she was devastated, but after she thought that it was probably a blessing in disguise. At least now there was nothing tying her with that shithead Nathan, and now she thought I will give him a treat just after the bad news tonight. Carman never did a thing all day but rest and it was in the afternoon that she heard the knock on the door. On opening it she saw Don standing there saying �I cannot be long because I have to be the other end of the country for two days. Look, I know it is your birthday tomorrow, so I went out yesterday and bought you this, and he handed her a charm bracelet with six letter charms spelling out Carman. I have also set up a party for you in Saint Paul&#8217;s hall, starting at eight finishing dead on ten thirty Tuesday night. I&#8217;m sorry I can&#8217;t be there but the deals must go on.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Thank you Don, that asshole I was married to never thought enough of me to throw a party for me. She gave him a long kiss, and as he left she wished him luck. Once he had walked down the path and disappeared, she walked back up the stairs and showered. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;***
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathan was standing by the wall and the woman turned around sharp, but walked over to him, it felt as though he was being lifted, and then she walked away. He never saw her face it was misty and distorted, but he only felt happy and contented while she was near him. He watched her point a finger at the wall, and the hole appeared once more, but instead of three monks appearing, there were two Monks holding a young girl, with a Nun with a bible saying prayers as she walked. The Monks stripped off the girls clothes as she was standing between them, and once it was completed they fixed her bonds around her wrists and ankles. The Monks with their heads held down and looking at the floor departed, but the Nun stayed and held out her hand, and the woman put her hand out to receive whatever was offered. On completion of the formal handover the Nun looked at Nathan and made the sign of the cross, she too then with her head bowed departed via the hole. The woman pointed once more and the hole disappeared, and it was then that Nathan realised that the hole appeared on a different wall.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The woman walked close to the girl, who had just excreted on the floor and was now laughing loud, and the eyes were looking like two large globes in the dark recesses of her face. There were also those eyes inside the eyes staring at Nathan, it was like the girls real eyes were looking one way but these ones inside were looking another. A screaming laugh came from the girl&#8217;s mouth and she urinated on the floor, the smell in the room was horrendous. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The woman walked over to the wall and retrieved her whip, then returned to her mark, before commencing she turned to Nathan, and again he felt himself nod. She turned to look at the girl once more, at the same time throwing the whip out in front, then as Nathan watched she commenced to whip the girl.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#8216;Nathan woke up with a shock movement, and it was quiet all around him, and the front part of his body was in pain. He tried to look down and see what scars he had, but it was impossible; he then run his finger lightly over his chest and legs, and felt all the welts and the cuts that were seeping a clear fluid. His tears fell once more, because he knew that his body was a mess. Carman had humiliated him, and she had destroyed his body; now no girl or woman would ever want to look at him ever again. He would have to leave town because of the pointing fingers, and the talking about him behind his back. He still could not understand what he had done wrong; was this all an elaborate set up by her?&#8217;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His thoughts were broken by the Mistress walking through the door; she walked over to the table where he laid, and he went to get up. �No stay where you are slave, it is not quite time for your punishment yet,� and she sat down on a chair. �Do you want to tell me what you did, that was so wrong, that your wife wishes you to be punished the way you are?� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Mistress I speak with respect when I tell you, that I have lain in pain for almost four days, and have been going through not just the last few months of my marriage, but the whole two years. There is nothing that I am ashamed of, or likely to be in the future; I have never been unfaithful, or slept with another woman or girl. I have never kissed another girl, not even at Christmas in fear of repercussions from Carman. I don&#8217;t expect you to believe me, but what would be the point hiding it from a person, that will not stop beating me whether I do or don&#8217;t tell her.� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Mistress stood up and told him �Your punishment will be in a short while, just before your wife shows her face once more. Then after that, you will have another meal and sleep once more; is there anything you wish to ask me?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I have felt the welts and cuts across my body Mistress, and it feels like a mess; does it look like a mess?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had caught her off guard and she was stuck for words. �Don&#8217;t say anything Mistress because the look on your face says it all� Then another tear ran down his face.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Mistress walked out the door once more leaving him to his thoughts, and he was now feeling a lot more alone than ever before.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He had no idea how long it was before the women walked in, but he slipped off the table once more. He was still in great pain between his legs, and it was a slow walk back to the cross for his next whipping. This time he was facing the cross and now it was the turn of the rear of his body to be scarred. It all went quiet and then he heard the Mistress&#8217;s voice �Do you want a gag slave?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No Mistress.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Then on the count of three I will begin.� for the first time Nathan counted one, two, snap, snap, snap, snap, snap, snap. Again Nathan was only grunting on each stroke but it was hurting more than the strokes on his front. The constant punishment he had on his back had taken its toll on the nerves. Snap, snap, snap, snap, snap, snap, Nathan was now crying the pain was almost unbearable. Snap, snap, snap, snap, snap, snap, there was no strength left in his body he was just hanging by his wrists. His whole body was now trembling like a jelly he knew that he was in uncontrollable pain. Snap, snap, snap, snap, snap, snap, �Your punishment has ended for today have you anything to say slave?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Thank you Mistress.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You&#8217;re welcome slave, you have done so well.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Mistress I know it will not be forthcoming, but I cannot take any more pain from the whip at the moment, and I beg you for mercy from using it on me again for a few days?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I grant you your mercy Nathan, you will receive no more of the whip in this establishment for three days; after tonight&#8217;s TV I will use something lighter.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Thank you Mistress� His tears falling could be seen by all in the room.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The monitor was brought into the room and plugged in, and while this was happening Nathan was having his bonds undone. The women walked him across to the screen and were steadying him, so that he never fell down. The screen came to life and Carman&#8217;s face appeared. �Hello Nathan, I hope you have plenty of marks on your ass, because I have a treat for you. But first I have to tell you about last night, Don came around to our; no that&#8217;s wrong my house and stayed the night. I have never had sex like he is giving me; once he starts he never stops. Do you know that now I have been with him, you could not come up to his standards, you&#8217;re just not good enough for me? I&#8217;ll bet it is all the way around town now, about you and your little dick, but they will forget in time I expect.� The Mistress was watching Nathan look at his manhood and then his face go red; this wife of his was not only pushing the knife in but also twisting the blade.
�I am having a birthday party tomorrow, it has been paid for by Don but he can&#8217;t be there. He also gave me a present in advance, I will show you� and she lifted her arm up and showed the charm bracelet. The Mistress could see Nathan saying no, no, no, but with no sound and shaking his head. �Now listen in, I have some good news and some bad news, and I think you better have the bad news first. I had a miscarriage this morning� and as she said it, Nathan fell to his knees and cried out loud. �But I suppose it was a blessing in disguise, because now there is nothing that could tie us together. The good news is; because it is your birthday also, I would like for you to only have another four days. I have cut your punishment short for a birthday present. But I want to see the marks on your body, if there are not enough I will send you back. I don&#8217;t know if I will talk to you anymore, but just in case I feel like it, I will expect the people where you are to show you the monitor every night. Well I have to get ready because a real man is coming here tonight to take me out.� The screen went blank, and the women helped Nathan up off the floor, and then walked him slowly over to the recovery table. 
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Shall we strap him down Mistress?� Bell asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No, that won&#8217;t be necessary, Nathan will not try to escape, get a sheet to cover him and a pillow. Have food brought down to him, he has had a hard day.�
The Mistress was up in her room talking to Belle. �That fucking bitch destroyed what little hope he had tonight. There was no reason to say those things to him, and the baby was the straw that broke the camel&#8217;s back. I want you to go back and stay with him until she gets back, if there is any trouble; ring me because I would like to know what he has done wrong. She has cut his punishment down to another four days, I wonder if he will last that long?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What will his punishment be tomorrow Mistress?�
�There will be no more whip for Nathan for three days; he begged me for Mercy tonight and I gave it him and without thinking about it. Do you know that all the time I have been a Mistress, he is the first to beg, and it gave me a feeling of power? But at the same time I felt ashamed that I had brought a person to their knees; I have messed his body up so much, and it was not until I had got close to him, that I could sense the fear that he was generating. He will receive the short strap across his back and buttocks, but it will only be twice I have no need to grind him into the dirt.� They sat and watched as Penny walked in with some food, and placed it on the table.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She walked back to where Nathan was, and she could see that he was still crying. She picked up a tissue off the table, and once she was close to him, wiped his tears away. She helped him to his feet, and slowly walked him over to the table, he had trouble once more holding the knife and fork, and once again Penny fed him. She took him to the toilet, then once back in the room, helped him on the table. She put the pillow under his head, and the sheet over his back, just before she left the room for the night; she kissed him on the cheek.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Shall I go down and lock the basement door Mistress?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No, he will not go anywhere, he will not run.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was late and Nathan was still awake, the pain he had running through his body, was keeping him awake. He felt two hands that were cool, running over his back, �Is that you Mistress, I am hurting so much. I have pains inside now and they are tearing me apart.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You are doing fine Timothy, I said that I would look after you, and I always keep my word. You must pull yourself together, there are only a few days of pain left then it will all be over. You must not feel hate, you are home and this is where you will stay, Chrystal house will always be your home. You are back with your real Mistress, and the only Mistress that you will ever need.&nbsp; I can give all the pain that you need others to have, I have now taken away your hurt, now sleep Timothy� he felt a cool kiss on the shoulder. 
Nathan knew that he was once more alone and his eyes closed, and he fell into a deep sleep.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Mistress had been up stairs listening to Nathan with Belle, and Belle said �He is dreaming Mistress. He was dreaming that he was talking to you.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The morning came, and after Nathan had eaten his breakfast, he was led to the bench once more. Penny strapped him down and before she walked away, she kissed him on the shoulder. The Mistress and Belle were watching on the CCTV, �What does Penny see in Nathan that I&#8217;m not, she has never been this close to any of the girls, let alone one of the boys that have been sent here. What is it about Nathan; that has made her change her mind about boys; it is like she is trying to protect him.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Mistress walked into the basement, and stepped over to Nathan, �You will receive the short strap today, and you will only receive it twice, I have no reason to mutilate you even further.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Thank you Mistress.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Even that little piece of respect surprised her, it was not expected �You&#8217;re welcome Nathan. It will be a light punishment as I think you wife has gone over the top.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�She ceased being my wife last night Mistress; I cannot forgive her for what she has done. So Don can throw a party and give her presents, she is living in cloud cuckoo land. I might be in a lot of pain and I might be scarred, but her pain will be a lot worse than mine, and her scar will be with her for the rest of her life. A baby has died because of her infidelity, and she will have to live with that for the rest of her life, then again, it was a blessing in disguise don&#8217;t you agree?� 
The Mistress looked down at him, and saw the tears running down Nathan&#8217;s face �Are you saying that you are going to punish her when you get back, Nathan?�
�I have no reason to punish her Mistress, all of her pain will be self inflicted, and then I will inflict my revenge on Don and anyone else that has caused this farce to come about. I will cause her pain just by telling her the truth, but I will not like doing it. I have done nothing to be ashamed of, because I have never broken my wedding vows. I beg you Mistress not to ask me anymore questions, as I cannot tell you lies, just to make either you or her happy.�
�Then I will ask you no more Nathan,�
Nathan watched as she walked over to the wall, and picked up the short strap, and then she walked out of sight behind him. The Mistress looked at his back and could see that most of the whip marks were now gone, but there were several that would be there for a long time. Without warning he felt the first stroke, slap, slap, slap, slap, slap, slap. Nathan could feel the strokes going all over his back, and they were being spread all about, as if there was set place for the Mistress to strike. Slap, slap, slap, slap, slap, slap, the Mistress was trying to avoid the spots on his back, where she had struck him with the whip, she was giving him mercy without telling him. Slap, slap, slap, slap, slap, slap, some of the strokes were hard and hurt, but others were light and only tapped the flesh. Slap, slap, slap, slap, slap, slap, slap, slap, she could see the tears coming from his eyes, because she knew that she had touched the whip marks on many occasions. Slap, slap, slap, slap, slap, slap, no sounds had come from his mouth, only the occasional grunt. The Mistress put her hand on his shoulder, �Relax slave, you have done well, there will be no more pain until tonight after you see your wife on the web.�
�Thank you Mistress.�
�You&#8217;re welcome slave, release him and let him walk about, he will not try to escape, will you Nathan?�
�No Mistress.�
The girls released his bonds and stood back, as if waiting for him to jump up, but he smiled and slid off the bench, then he walked over to the table and lay face down. It was moments later when his eyes closed and he was asleep. He hadn&#8217;t noticed but Penny was sat down on a chair by his side, she was quiet staring at nothing, just like a sentinel. 
The Mistress was up in her private room looking at the TV screen, �What does she see in him Belle, what is the attraction? I know there is something not right and Nathan said as much this morning, he is blaming his wife for everything, and he is so damn sure. He has also said that, she will be in pain for the rest of her life, and all that he will do is talk to her. I wonder what she will say to him tonight, I doubt that it will make him feel any better.�
�You sound as though you feel sorry for him Mistress.�
She looked at Belle for a moment, and she was thinking about what she had said, and then answered, �It&#8217;s strange Belle but I do, I might give people pain, but I don&#8217;t think I am cruel and spiteful, and that is where his wife and I differ.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;***

Carman was sitting in the cafe talking to Don, �I&#8217;m sorry that I can&#8217;t be there tonight, but I&#8217;ll see you tomorrow morning when I get back. I have to do these jobs because they are my bread and butter, I could never pay for us to go to these places and pay for the party tonight.�
Carman was drooling over all that he was saying to her, �That&#8217;s ok lover I understand, you have to do what you have to do.�
�Do you know it was the best thing that ever happened, when Nathan messed you about and was unfaithful? You know that I have loved you ever since school, but no you had to go with someone that would let you down. Where is Nathan any way, you must have fucked him off good, for him not to come back and get his clothes yet.�
Carman let out a big laugh, and then told him, �I went on the web and found a school that takes miss behaving spouses, and beats the hell out of their ass. I have sent him away, so that he can get six strokes of the cane every day, on his bare one. But I don&#8217;t know whether that will be enough, to give him the scars that I want to see.�
�He should be whipped for what he has done to you, why don&#8217;t you ask them, that way at least if he has no scars, you will know that he has had a thorough thrashing. I saw a film once, of a girl getting thrashed with a whip, and she had twenty strokes and there was hardly a mark on her. At the end of the film, both were seen standing side by side laughing.�
�What a wicked idea, when I get in touch with them tomorrow after the party, I will tell them that is what I want for his last day there. Yes twenty strokes you say, it&#8217;s not a lot to ask for seeing I am cutting short his stay there short. I already have something to show him that i meant to show him last night.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;***

The Mistress walked into the basement, and put her hand on Penny&#8217;s shoulder, �Stay where you are Penny� Nathan looked around and saw her, and he tried to get up, but she told him to stay where he was, because it was not time yet. �You will have the same amount as you did this morning, then your wife should be speaking with you once more. If you say that you have done nothing wrong, I cannot understand why she is being so hard on you. But it seems that her new man looks after her better, by buying her gold, and organising a birthday party for her. She told us last night, that you have never done anything like that for her in all the time you have been married. Is she telling the truth Nathan, have you neglected her all these years?�
�Mistress I do not have to answer that question, but as you gave me respect and gave me mercy the other night, I will, out of the respect I have for you. Carman and I have only been married two years, and in that time, she has only had one birthday, this is the second. On her first birthday last year, I took her to London, where I took her to see the opera Carman; that she has always wanted to see. Afterwards I wined and dined her at a top London restaurant, and I also gave her a ring with a diamond in a clasp. By tomorrow, she will have received all my gifts for her birthday this year, but I will once again receive nothing, and I don&#8217;t expect anything.�
The Mistress was going to ask what the present was, but decided that as he had given her respect, out of respect she would say nothing.
It was an hour later and Penny stood up, she touched Nathans shoulder, and he looked at her and stood up himself. They walked across to the bench and he assumed the position, Penny then buckled up the bonds that would hold him. The Mistress walked in front of him and took hold of the short strap, and then once again she walked to his rear. Slap, slap, slap, slap, slap, slap. The Mistress was giving him a short break, and then started once more, slap, slap, slap, slap, slap, slap. There were another twelve strokes before the Mistress stopped and put the strap down. Then she looked at Belle �Bring in the plasma screen, let&#8217;s see what his wife has to say tonight.� The screen was brought in as Nathan was being released from his bonds. 
The screen came to life and Carman appeared laughing. �I hope you are watching you boy with the little dick. I also hope that you are getting a good hiding every day; I&#8217;ll bet you cry on every stroke. Well I hope you do, because that is one thing that will never happen to my new man and a real man, Don. Anyway let&#8217;s get back to the subject and that&#8217;s me, I have been with Don all day, and he treats me like a lady, and that is something that you have never done you traitorous pig.� The onslaught at him was getting to his mind, and there were tears in his eyes, she was out of order, there was no reason to say these things. �We were talking about you today, and when he asked where you were I told him, I told him all about the school I had sent you. He said that you had got off light, and that you should be whipped, and he also said that he saw a film once where a woman was whipped twenty times, and she was laughing at the end of it. Well as a favour to Don and a birthday present from you to me, I want you to receive twenty lashes of the whip tomorrow, and then you can come home tomorrow night. I will be home by ten thirty, and hopefully your few marks will still be showing. If there are not enough then you will be going back there to get some more. I have a little film that i want to show you that i took the other evening, and they watched as she went out of sight then on came a film of her and Don fucking in the marital bed. It went on for an age before it stopped and her face was there on the screen once more. �She was laughing, and when she stopped, she said, �That friend of mine Jill Cooper was around this morning, telling me in detail about how you and that Nancy Bolter were kissing and cuddling in the cafe. It was her that told me of your tardy affair, you are a filthy puddle of dogs piss. The post arrived at the same time, and there was a letter for you, and inside were two tickets for a film premier up in London, she said that is what you and Nancy were talking about in the cafe. When I asked her what should I do with them? She took them off me and ripped them in two, and we laughed because you cannot get the four hundred pounds back if the ticket is damaged. Well I must go and enjoy myself, my man might not be there but neither are you going to be there, you filthy piece of pigs shit. You will never be a man like my Don you fucking creep. Oh and by the way the talk all around town is about your tiny dick, everyone is having a laugh about that.� The screen went dead and Nathan was on his knees on the floor, and with his head on the floor and he was unashamedly crying once more.
Penny helped him to his feet and walked him to the table, and sat him down, and then she walked off to get his food. The Mistress stepped up to the table, �I don&#8217;t know what to say Nathan, I really don&#8217;t, but you know what to expect tomorrow morning, and I will give it to you in one session, back and front. Penny will be back with your food shortly, then after sleep on the recovery bench.�
There was no answer, and the Mistress never expected one, he was still crying from the onslaught of abuse. Penny walked back with his food as the Mistress and the women walked out.
The Mistress was up in her room once more, �That fucking bitch, whatever is she up to Belle? That film was uncalled for, and it was way over the top, at this rate his brain will be fucked before he gets home. I have to give him twenty of the whip tomorrow; and all because she wants to count the scars.�
�You sound as if you don&#8217;t want to do it Mistress, you have given that to clients before and we know they can take it.�
�You are correct he is fit enough to take it, but he will be in a mess afterwards for his journey home. You will go with him and keep me informed by mobile phone.�
Nathan was asleep when he felt the hands on his back, �Timothy you must be strong tomorrow. Mistress Donna must stick to her contract, and you will receive the full amount ordered. But I will be with you to soften your pain, but the lashes will strike hard, there is no soft way to administer the whip. It is ok to cry and it is ok to shout on each stroke, but you don&#8217;t need a gag. Now I must leave you, so get some rest and vengeance is mine� Nathan felt the kiss on his shoulder, and once again he had fallen asleep.
The morning came, and Nathan was on the cross when the Mistress walked into the basement. He was facing out away from the cross, and saw her walking towards him. �Good morning Mistress Donna.�
�Good morning slave; you know what I have to do, just for proof for your wife. I would like it to be known that I think she has lost the plot, but a contract is a contract. You will receive five on your front, and then you will be turned around. I will then administer the remaining fifteen to your back, and then you will have all day to recover a little before we drive you home. Do you want a gag Nathan?�
�No Mistress but thank you for asking.�
He watched her pick up the whip off the table, and in a flash, snap, snap, snap, snap, snap. The Mistress walked up to him and ran her hand over the welts that had appeared, �There are no cuts� she told him but his chest and front was a mess. The girls turned him around, and then without warning snap, snap, snap, snap, snap the strikes were hitting him on the shoulders. Snap, snap, snap, snap, snap, snap, that was three to each of his thighs, and he was crying and making a grunt of every lash. Snap, snap, snap, snap, the Mistress Walked to his rear and ran her hand gently over the welts once more, his back was worse than the front and there was cuts. �You have served me well Slave, and I will never again touch your body, with any implement of pain.�
Through his tears he thanked her, and she said to Belle, �Put him on the recovery table, get Penny to exercise him now and again. Let her stay with him, he will need some company. 
It was half way through the day and Nathan had been asleep. He was facing the door and still face down, and then the Mistress walked in the door. She saw him looking at her and walked towards him, and as she got closer his eyes were as big as eggs, and he was trembling. She put her hand gently on his shoulder and told him �You have no reason to fear me anymore, your punishment is over.� While resting her hand on his shoulder, she could feel the relief flowing through his body, and it was something that she had never felt in any slave before. The Mistress pulled back the sheet and looked at his body and could see all the welts and cuts that her tools of pain had left behind. Her hand was gently running over his body feeling those same bumps and small open cuts; she knew that the whip shows no mercy, as there was no soft way to administer it.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathan knew what she was doing and looking at and asked �Are there enough scars to show Mistress?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes slave, more than enough, but you have seen the venom in her so who can tell?� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Will the scars ever heal Mistress?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I have seen worse, and with a lot of loving care yes they will heal.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I will not be getting a lot of that now, so what you are saying Mistress is that I will be scarred for life. I will be getting no love from Carman anymore, and I don&#8217;t think I could ever love her again. She is the one that has betrayed me, by going with Don, and doing the things she has done. I will have to leave town, because I will not be able to stay there, because of the things she has spread about me. I will have to find other work, because I cannot go back to the job I have now, because people will know that I am inadequate and cannot satisfy a woman.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Mistress then realised what she had said to him, and wished she had not spoke. �Rest slave, the girl will be down with your food in a moment; I deliberately left your buttocks clear of pain so that it does not impair your sitting down. You should not feel the way you do slave, because I don&#8217;t think you are sexually inadequate; what has been said by your wife was to save her own face. It will be interesting to see what this is all about, when you get back and see her. Have you somewhere to go slave, because you cannot stay with your wife tonight.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No Mistress; I will sleep in the park, then go north tomorrow and find new lodgings.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She gave him a friendly tap on the buttocks �Try and keep cheerful Nathan.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The girl came in with his lunch and smiled towards him as she walked past. Nathan slipped slowly off the table and put his feet on the floor; he was so much in pain he found it hard to walk. The girl came back and gently took hold of his arm, and slowly led him to the table. Once again he was shaking so much that he had to be fed by the girl and on the second spoon full he started to cry. The girl could not understand why, and the Mistress saw that she was in distress. All the activity that was taking place in the room stopped, and the Mistress walked over to the table �Whatever is the matter slave?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Through his tears he asked �How will I be able to eat after tonight� and he held his hands out and they were trembling?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Mistress put her hand on his shoulder, and told him not to worry, she would work something out. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The day went fast and the Mistress came down to see Nathan in the punishment room. �We are going to administer a drug into your arm slave, to send you to sleep.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Why are you doing that Mistress?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It is so that this house remains a secret.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�But I know where I am Mistress, because this is Chrystal house, and at the end of the drive there are two large gates with gargoyles on the stone posts. There is a high green hedge made of trees that goes all around the estate, and the other side the gate is a road that takes you to Chilton.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She looked at him and asked �Who told you all this, I will see that they are punished?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No one told me Mistress; my father brought me here while I was a child, because he had work here to do. I was only four or five at the time, but in later years before my father died, he was always talking about this place. Please don&#8217;t make me feel ill again, I will never talk of this place again Mistress.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Mistress looked at Belle, and then told her to leave the drug as it was not needed. She held a silk dressing gown out for him to put on saying �This will be more comfortable close to your skin during the journey.� All the women were in the room as he put the dressing gown on. It will also be easier for you to show your wife the scars, and your clothes are in the carrier bag.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Follow me� Belle told him, and he turned around to do as ordered. The girl was there, and as he was about to step off she kissed him on the cheek, and a tear ran down her face. It only got halfway down her cheek and stopped; Nathan put his hand out and with his finger collected the tear, and put the finger to his mouth. Nothing more was said as he walked out behind Belle.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On the way back to the house Nathan had made a call on his mobile and arranged a meeting at his house. After he had made the call Belle asked �Is that the girl you had the affair with Nathan.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He looked at her and said&#8217; �How many times do I have to tell people, that I never had an affair, but she is very important to what is said tonight.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They had been travelling for two hours, and Belle was sitting in the back of the car with him, with two other women in the front. When they pulled up at the gate it was dark, and the lights in the house were on; Nathan started to tremble, and Belle put her hand on his arm and told him �It will be alright Nathan we will be with you.� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The four women walked up the path, and he told Belle were his keys where, and she then unlocked the door. It was quarter to ten as he walked into the house, and he sat down on the hard chair, knowing full well that the couch would be too uncomfortable. Carman had come back earlier than expected, and walked through the door at twenty past ten. As she entered he stood up, and she just walked across to him, and slapped him on the side of the face. It brought tears to his eyes, and she said �I&#8217;ll bet that you have been crying on every stroke that struck your body, you pathetic wimp. That is why I have a better man in my life now, and he is a real man, and looks after me. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Why are you doing this Carman; what have I done that is so bad?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;ll tell you what you have done you asshole; you&#8217;ve been shagging that girl Nancy Bolter.� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathan sat back down saying; �What have you done you stupid bitch?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carman stepped forward saying �Call me a stupid bitch I&#8217;ll slap you again for that.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathan leant back in the chair, and Belle jumped up and stood between them saying �Touch him again and I will rip your head off.� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carman in shock stood back asking �Who the hell are you anyway?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�We are from the school that you sent Nathan.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well if he has not got enough marks on him, then you will be taking him back with you. Anyway as I told him last night, I have been to a party that Don arranged, and the only thing that was missing, was my new lover. There is also this bracelet, when was the last time you bought me jewellery?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathan ignored her and asked �Who told you I have been shagging Nancy Bolter?� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�My friend, Jill Cooper, she saw you kissing and canoodling in the cafe, and she also told me, that you were all over her for about half an hour. Then before you left you gave her another love letter, just like the one you gave her while meeting her in the street. Then you were seen walking out of her flat by her husband, and he took a photo of you. She handed him a photo of him on the walkway of the flat, and he started to smile.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You ruined our marriage because of a load of lies, and I suffered a lot of pain because you are too stupid for your own good.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You are denying it all then; I might have guessed that you would not have the balls, like my Don, and be man enough to admit to an affair.� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�In a moment you stupid bitch, there will be a knock on the door, and Nancy Bolter will be there, and you will let her in.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yea, like fuck I will, I&#8217;ll take her stupid head off?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I don&#8217;t think you will, because her husband will be standing there with her, I made sure of that when I phoned her.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�So you have been seeing her you asshole.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathan ignored her just as there was a knock on the door; one of the women let the blonde and the man inside the door.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I see that Carman got your present, I was unsure if my brother Don would give it to you Nathan, because you know that he has never liked you. How did the party go; that was the best group that I could get at such short notice.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carman Shouted �You&#8217;ve been having an affair with him you bitch, Don told me that he had bought that bracelet and laid on the party for me.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Get real Carman, he could not afford the twelve hundred pounds for that lot. That is the business that my husband John and I are in, we are party org.com. Was he at the party, well I can tell you, no he was not, because he was with his girl friend down the hospital; she gave birth to a baby boy. That party was all paid for in three payments by Nathan, and every time he paid me John was always there. The last time he paid me was in my mother&#8217;s flat and Don was there when it happened.� As she was saying this, Nathan handed her the paper photo; she looked at it and said �Jill Cooper has taken that with her phone, because you can see the crack across her lens.� She put her hand in her purse saying �There is the receipt Nathan you look after yourself.� Then to Carman she said, �You want to look after him, as there are not many around like Nathan. Well I must go have a good evening� �She walked past Belle that was on the phone. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carman looked at Nathan saying; I am so sorry and was in tears.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sorry does not go far enough, it does not even get you off the starting line.
There is just one more thing before I get changed. He dropped the robe and was standing naked in front of her and asked, are there enough scars Carman, and then he turned around slowly? He watched as she closed her eyes and put her hand to her mouth to stop screaming.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Don&#8217;t go Nathan I will put everything right for you; I was so wrong.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You are not God Carman. Can you change the fact that you soiled our bed, with making love to another man on it? Can you change the fact that you sucked his dick and enjoyed it? Can you change the fact, that you told me in all honesty, that he was a better lover than me? Can you change the fact; that you would rather listen to your friends before you would listen or ask me? How are you going to change the fact that you have told everyone that my manhood is small, and I am an unsatisfactory lover? Can you put my unborn child back inside of your body, oh sorry, I forgot; that was a blessing in disguise? The other thing that you forgot to mention; was the tickets for the film premier, that was another part of your birthday, but good old friendly Jill has fucked you once more. Then again, I have already been to yours and Dons film premier.� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There were tears in Nathans eyes as he went to open the bag with his cloths; Belle stopped him and picked up the gown and put it back on him. �The Mistress says you have to come back with us, so that you can get you body better.� One of the women picked up his suitcase and one of the other girls took his bag and walked Nathan out the door. Belle waited until they were all out the door and then spoke to Carman. �You are young and pretty Carman, and it is not the end of the world; a miscarriage can be had at any time, even in the best of couples. You will love again, but then you had better trust your husband over your friends. Nathan will be well looked after back at the house, and his scars will go in time, as well as the ones you have put on his heart.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She walked out the door leaving Carman crying, and to reflect on her stupid actions. Once Belle was sitting in the car it moved away, and she looked at the tears running down Nathans face. She reached across and pulled him close, so that his head was on her chest; let it out of your system Nathan, it will soon be forgotten.












CHAPTER FOUR
&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathan stepped into the house and started to tremble again, at the thought of what might happen. He heard the Mistresses voice behind him and he cringed �Good evening Nathan.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He turned to face her and answered �Good evening Mistress.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I expect you&#8217;re wondering why you are back here; well you will have to be looked after to get rid of your scars. It might take months to get them away, but with the correct amount of care it can happen. You will not be in the punishment room any longer; I am putting you in a room, were you will be looked after. You are not a prisoner here for the reason being, you know our location and it would be a pointless act. You may walk out anywhere in the grounds, but don&#8217;t get to close to the hedge, as you will set off alarm bells on the computer. There are three meals a day, and once you are better you will be expected to work for your keep. As you are a man/boy, you will be expected to work outside on the estate; do you understand Nathan.� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mistress.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Come with me and I will take you to your room� Nathan followed the Mistress up the stairs. �Now Nathan you had better be quiet; the girl in this room is already asleep.� and she opened the door. Stepping inside with Nathan behind her she walked over to a bed near the far wall. �You had better lie on top of the bed, with just a sheet over you for the moment, until your irritation goes away.� The Mistress pulled back the covers and told Nathan to strip, and then told him to lie on the bed. He did as she ordered and then she added; �I am going to tie your feet to the end of the bed, so that you don&#8217;t turn over in your sleep, because your back is a mess.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For the first time in four days, he was sleeping on a soft bed and his eyes closed within seconds; he never heard the Mistress leaving the room. It was in the morning that he opened his eyes, startled at the sensation he was feeling. He turned to his left and it was the girl that had not spoke a word to him, but was always there. She was putting oil onto her hand and rubbing it all over his body, where his body had been in pain she was now pressing hard. Now the oil was making his body subtle, and her soft hands were not hurting. In the next hour and a half she had rubbed oil into every part of his body front and back. She had found a pair of shorts in his suit case, and threw them at him; Nathan took that to mean put them on along with his trainers. He had not asked, but he just took it that the girl could not speak, and he never wanted to be forward. Once he was in the shorts, she took hold of his hand and pulled him towards the door; Nathan was a little nervous and pulled back at the door. The girl smiled at him and pulled again, and he went with her. They walked along a hallway and at the end through a door; the girl had pulled him into a dining area where all the women were seated. She sat him down at the end of the table, and then brought him over some cornflakes with a spoon. The girl sat down to his right. Nathan looked at the spoon and moved his hand towards it, and all the women were looking at him out of the corner of their eyes. He lifted the spoon, but as soon as he did his hand began to shake uncontrollably; he moved it towards the bowel but it was shaking so much that he gave up and dropped the spoon. There were tears in his eyes and he picked it up once more and the same thing happened; Belle said, �Help him out Penny.� The girl took the spoon from his hand and started to feed him a spoonful at a time. Nathans face was red with embarrassment, and he wiped away his tears.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Belle said, �You have nothing to be ashamed of Nathan, it is only your nerves reacting to the pain that you have received. Your body will soon get used to it and your hands will stop shaking but it will take time; Penny will look after you. She has not spoken a word since she came here, because her man beat the hell out of her.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Mistress Donna told me you all hate men and boys, and it makes me nervous, and when I am nervous my hands always shake Miss.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You don&#8217;t have to be frightened of us Nathan; you have been dealt a cruel blow and we all understand. Last night was quite an eye opener I cannot believe that your wife could be so stupid.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�She is not my wife, not any more at least. She lost that status when she slept with that stupid idiot Don. I cannot for the life of me wonder how he thought he would get away with it? But it is all history for the moment.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Why for the moment?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I will take my revenge for what happened to me, there are two people that owe me more than they could ever pay in their lifetime.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Are you talking about Carman?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good lord no, she has got a lifetime of pain and sorrow, and I will not add more to it. Through her own stupidity, she was also a victim, and to the lowest of people, and also taken for a ride in a conspiracy. Can I ask what I am supposed to do during the day Miss?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You do not have to call me Miss; my name is Belle, and the Mistress will inform you after breakfast. You must remain here with Penny, as the Mistress has given her permission to look after you. But I advise you that don&#8217;t ever take advantage of her soft nature.� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I would never do that; how could I bite the hand that feeds me?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Not long after the women walked out of the room, and it was just as the Mistress Walked in, and Nathan without thinking stood up. She smiled saying �Sit down Nathan you do not have to fear me.� She walked around to the back of him and touched his back �The oils that are being used on your body are medical, and will help you heal quicker. You say your father worked here Nathan; have you any idea what he was doing?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It was something he never told me Mistress Donna. I never knew my mother, but my father always told me she was beautiful, and died four years after I was born.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Are you an only child Nathan?� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I was always told by my father, that I had an older half sister somewhere, but he died before he ever told me who. I could never find out who she was, because my birth was never registered in my mother&#8217;s name, only my fathers. I have to get fit once more Mistress I have to sort my life out once more. Can I ask you a question Mistress no I will change that to request; if the answer is no then I understand?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes ask�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Would you punish someone for me?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It will take a month or two to get you fit; if you still feel the same way then ask me again. I am going to put you to work this morning, so if you will follow me I will show you what needs doing.� Nathan stood up and followed her out of the dining room with Penny trailing behind them. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They walked outside where it was warm, but it was still the end of spring. He still only had shorts on but the little bit of sun that was caressing his body felt refreshing. She walked him over to a shed at the corner of the house. It was at least twenty feet by ten, and outside was a massive pile of timber; that had been pulled in from a wood somewhere and left to mature. Some of the pieces were eight inches thick and twenty feet long. There was also a wood horse that had been made up from smaller timber, he knew what it was for and how to use it; he remembered something similar, but it was deep in the back of his mind.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Mistress opened the shed and showed him inside; there were tools for cutting and sawing wood hanging on the walls. There was also a chainsaw and a five gallon drum of petrol. He also saw what he thought were the tools for sharpening these items. �We had an old man come here last year to cut us wood for the burner.� Mistress Donna told him. �Unfortunately he had a heart attack and is now retired. There is a tractor and trailer around the back of the house to collect more wood from around the estate once you have cut up that pile next to the shed. But you won&#8217;t need that for a couple of days yet, by then the shed will be almost full.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Penny and the Mistress watched him take a look at the timber and then of the shed, then he repeated the action. Then stood looking at them both, with a questioning expression on his face. �Is there something wrong Nathan� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He looked at the giant pile of timber that was bigger than the shed itself and said, �With all due respects Mistress if you told the old man the same thing as you have just told me; then I can understand why he had the heart attack.� The silence was shattered by penny bursting out laughing; both the Mistress and Nathan looked at her in shock.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Mistress put her arms around Penny saying �At last Penny you&#8217;re using your vocal cords once more. I will get the doctor up to see you later today, and he might be able to give you something to help you get your voice back.� She then looked at Nathan �Saying thank you Nathan, you are very good company for Penny. I am going up to the house with penny, and I&#8217;ll leave you with your small task� 
Then she and Penny started to walk away. As they were doing so Nathan added. �If this is a small task, then god forbid you ever find a big one.� The Mistress had her arm around Penny and he heard them both laugh again. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathan was outside all morning, cutting the timber into small blocks, and then stacking them in the back of the wood shed. He had worked out how to sharpen the saws, and which file to use, and he even had the chain saw working. He had cut a few pieces about three feet in length and at different thickness&#8217;s and put them to one side. The Mistress had looked out of the window several times, and she noticed that not once had she seen him resting. From the window thirty yards away, she could still see the scars she had put across his body. Even after the beating he received from her, he still had room for a little light hearted humour, and in doing so gave Penny her voice back.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As she was looking in his direction, she could see two Monks walking towards him, but it was nothing strange, because over in the far end of the woods was a large stone Monastery. There was another small road leading off of her drive that the tradesmen used. It was spring and she knew that from now on she would be seeing a lot more of them. The Monastery was as old as the house that she was living in, but she had never ventured into that part of the land around them. Nathan was facing away from them and he sensed them more than saw them, and he turned and waited for them to approach. It was when they were close that he could see the strange look in their eyes, and when they were three metres away they stopped dead in their tracks, and it was as if they had walked into a wall.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One of the Monks turned to face the other, �It seems we are too late brother, he has the gift.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The words were unheard by Nathan and he asked, �Can I help you at all?� It was when they looked back at him that he noticed the eyes inside the eyes looking back at him. This freak of nature was only in one of the Monks, but he had seen these eyes on many occasions, but he could not think where though. The two Monks were giving him a creeping feeling all over his body, but in no way was it fear.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Monk with the normal eyes answered, �That is very kind of you to ask, but we are only passing by. We must leave you to your work, as we have held you up for too long, and have a pleasant day.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathan never replied because he knew that there was no need. He then heard the voice of the woman in his head, �Yes Timothy you have seen their eyes and the eyes in the eyes, they were here to check on you, and have not gone away unrewarded. You will be seeing them again in the near future, for their ritual is only a short age away. By tomorrow midday, the Mistress will give you all you ask for. Once again you have not let me down Timothy, and I will always be with you.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was lunch time, and Belle walked out the door and shouted him in for lunch. He put down the saw and walked to the big house, he stopped and looked at the front and he remembered it from long ago, it was still the same. As he was walking through the main doors he stopped dead in his tracks. There was another door open and on the wall was a picture of a beautiful woman in her late twenties. He was drawn into the room and stopped in front of the painting mesmerised by her beauty. �Mistress Chrystal� he said out loud �Is it you that was talking to me the other night, I was so lonely, and I was hurting so much.� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On the way in he had not seen the Mistress behind the door, and it was a shock to him when she spoke.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What are you doing in here, Nathan?� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He spun around and the Mistress could see the fear in his face, and the tear in the corner of his eye. He answered �I saw the picture and remembered and I am very sorry Mistress, I wasn&#8217;t trying to thieve anything please believe me.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In a softer voice the Mistress told him to calm down and asked �What it was that he had remembered?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He turned back to the painting saying �Mistress Crystal was a very beautiful lady.� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His words put a shiver through her body and she asked �Who told you her name Nathan?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No one Mistress, I remember being in a horse drawn carriage with her, as she was taken around the estate. There were others in the carriage but I cannot remember them, only looking up at Mistress Crystal. You have my father&#8217;s photo in the punishment room, it is hung on the wall; there is another picture next to him, and I remember him also, but he was a lot older than that. Mistress Crystal gave me toys to play with, and they were happy days. I am sorry Mistress; I have taken up a lot of your time with your permission I will go to lunch.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes, carry on Nathan we must talk some more� and as he walked from the room, Mistress Donna looked at the painting of the smiling woman and asked. �What more surprises is he going to spring on me mother, and how did you visit him and then talk to him the other night?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;***
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#8216;Carman had just opened her eyes, and was now thinking about all the things that had happened in the last few days. Her so called friend Jill had let her down, by conspiring with Don. She decided that the day off that she had arranged would be well used, and for the benefit of getting her own back. She knew that she could never put things right, and Nathan had every right to disown her. She was trying to figure out how things had got so out of hand in such a short time? Then she remembered the state of Nathans body when he showed her, and a tear came to her eye. There was only one way to get her own back on Don and that was to go to the Hospital. The cake for her birthday was an extra sent at the last minute by Don, and at the party there was a big sign over the stage. Don had to have had help to put it up; because the words were �Happy birthday Carman from Don� she had taken photos of it and the cake on her phone.&#8217;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carman walked down the stairs, and after she had eaten picked up the phone and rang the number that was on the receipt from the party. She waited until the receiver was picked up the other end, �Hello Nancy, it&#8217;s me Carman, do you think you could come to my house, only things have gone wrong with Nathan and I, and I would like some help. I was also wrong to accuse you of anything last night; so if you don&#8217;t feel safe bring your husband along too. Two this afternoon that will be fine, I will be at home ready to eat humble pie.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She then went over to the computer and connected her mobile phone to it, then took off some prints. After putting the prints in an envelope she turned the computer off.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;***
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathan had eaten his lunch and went back outside to carry on with his work. He noticed out of the corner of his eye that the Mistress walked to the window and watched him work every now and again. The fresh air was making him feel a lot better and he noticed that the pain in his body was leaving him. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Every so often he would think about what had happened and what Don had done. When this happened his work rate got faster, and then he had to think of something different to slow down. He needed a rest and walked around to the back of the house and found the tractor and trailer. It was a small one, the same type that he had seen in garden centres; there were mowers both sides of the tractor and realised it was a malty task. He jumped on it and started it up, and tried the gear stick and it moved forward and then putting it in reverse he went backwards. Nathan switched it off and covered it back over then walked to the side of the house once more. He walked past the pile of wood and to the front of the building and looked at the drive. Each side there was a garden that was about thirty feet by thirty and there was a stone wall that was only eighteen inches high running like a maze all over it. On top of the wall was a flat stone that in its time gave it elegance, but now the wall was crumbling under and some had fallen off. He hadn&#8217;t noticed, but it was one of the times that the Mistress was watching him. He walked over to the garden, and into the entrance to the maze; he then pointed his finger at the wall and followed it along and stopped. Then he walked over to where he had stopped with his finger and bent down. The Mistress watched him bend down and do something with the brickwork, and then he stood up and held something in his hand and he laughed. Then he put whatever it was back, and after a moment walked away smiling to himself. Nathan walked back towards the house, he looked up at the windows, he saw the Mistress looking back and smiling, it was a shock to his system and so much that he felt his head swirl, and he passed out.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Mistress saw it happen, and ran out and down the stairs calling Belle and the other girls as she did so. They were all outside in minutes of it happening, and Belle had her Doctors bag with her; she put smelling salts under his nose and he came to. There was a bit of a gash on his head where it glanced off the side of the wall, but it was more like a scratch. The women helped him to sit down on the bench, and then they all walked off leaving just Nathan and the Mistress.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathan looked at the Mistress and said �Mistress Crystal was your mother; I looked up and thought it was her. I saw her at that window so many times smiling at me. �Did you see what I did out there Mistress?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Nathan you were smiling as if you had found a pot of gold, and yes, she was my mother.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Mistress Crystal used to give me coins every so often; it was to keep her secret. She would give me the coin and then say, go and hide your treasure Timothy and be careful. I would run out here, and hide it in the same place every time, then as I walked back and looked up, I would see her looking down smiling at me. She knew all along where I had hid them but said nothing; she was keeping my secret as I was keeping hers. I know what you are going to ask, but I cannot remember what the secret was; you have to remember, that I am only getting flash backs from when I was very young. Neither do I know why she called me Timothy. I asked my father once, and he answered, you must have imagined her calling you that name. Do you want to see what it was that she gave me; it does not matter anymore because time moves on regardless?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He stood up and held out his hand to help the Mistress up; she took his hand and stood up. She followed him to the place in the wall where he knelt down once again, and watched while he moved the bricks around. When he stood up, he took her hand and dropped ten sovereigns into it. �There you are my treasure that your mother gave to me.� The Mistress was looking at him smiling, and put them back in his hand. Nathan took the coins and put them back into the wall and replaced the bricks.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Why are you not keeping your treasure Nathan, they are worth a great deal of money?� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�My Mistress and I were the only persons to know that secret, and even now my Mistress and I are still the only persons that know. I never needed the treasure then, and I do not need it now, do you think I am foolish Mistress.� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No Nathan, I think you were very loyal to my mother, and you are very loyal now. Come on inside it is almost time for evening meal.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;***
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was a knock on the door and Carman stood up and answered it; Nancy was stood there by herself so Carman told her to enter. Once inside Carman told her all that happened between Don, Jill and herself pointing out that she had only herself to blame. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Nancy told her she had been bloody stupid, but could understand the woman scorned bit. �Don is not my real brother he is a foster brother, but he has been with us from about six years old. He was well out of order, and should never have done that, especially since he is so much in love with Tracy Aston, she&#8217;s the girl that has just had his baby. I never could stand him, and my mother has always regretted fostering him in the first place. I think he is only going with Tracy because of the money her family have; so how can I help you.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I need a receipt for the bracelet in his name, and also a receipt for the hall in his name, then leave the rest up to me. I would also like to say sorry again for accusing you of anything, as I was well out of order.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That&#8217;s not a problem, I will have one of each sent around this evening by special delivery; we employ our own driver so it won&#8217;t cost anything. By the way Tracy will be in hospital for another three days, because her baby has a bad cold. Well I must go and I will get things arranged for you, and I hope you have better luck the next time around, and cheer up there are plenty more fish in the sea.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carman knew that Don would be around tonight, and he knew of nothing, not even the fact that Nathan was out of his prison. She was also wondering what he was going to say when he got there. She spent an hour messing about with a digital video camera, and as soon as she had it set up with the remote mike she knew she was ready. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Don came around at six just after she had finished eating, and once inside he sat down in the lounge. �I can&#8217;t stay too long tonight because I have a meeting with a friend that I must attend; I have to sort out the money for the party I organised for you.� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Do you mean to say that this bracelet you bought me could be taken back by the jewellers?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No lover, that has been paid for with three hundred pounds of my hard earned cash. There&#8217;s not a thing that I would not do for you lover, because I have never had a girl like you before.� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What are you doing tomorrow night Don; surely we can have another night of sex like we did Saturday night.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No I am at a darts meeting, and away game lover and there is no room in the car or I would take you with me.� He looked at his watch and said, �Good heavens is that the time I really must go lover?� He then gave Carman a lingering Kiss on the mouth and then he pulled away and almost ran out the door. Carman smiled to herself and went over to the bookcase and took down the camera. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She played back the half hour of recording and laughed saying out loud �Got you cold you bastard.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;***
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was at evening meal that he had to use the knife and fork once more, he was at the end of the table once more and Penny was to his right. Everyone was looking at him as he looked at the eating tools. He took a deep breath and grabbed them both at the same time, and to his astonishment his hands were not shaking. He looked up at the ceiling saying �Thank you God, I really owe you big time.� There was a laugh from the table of women and even one from Penny. Nathan ate his meal, and ate like it was the best meal that he had ever had in his life. After the meal he said �I think I overdid it today, I have to go to bed get some sleep.� He stood up and Penny stood up with him and walked behind him like a puppy. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Penny told him to strip a lay on the bed and then he realised she was talking; �Hay you&#8217;re talking� He said smiling. He stripped off his clothes that he had changed into before evening meal and lay face down.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�The other way please, your back is the worst, and I want you to sleep face down Nathan.� He did as he was told and closed his eyes, and he felt her soft hands on his leg. He must have fallen asleep because she had to wake him, to make him turn over. He turned over on his chest and looked at her while she rubbed in the oil. She was only about five foot six in height with a face that was always smiling. She wasn&#8217;t beautiful but she had a hidden beauty, her heart was in the correct place and she made Nathan feel good. When she had finished oiling him he put his hand out, and knowing what she had been through with her last man it was a slow movement. He took hold of her hand and kissed it on the back saying �I don&#8217;t know what I would do without your care, and I owe you my life.� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�But I have not done anything Nathan.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�When I was feeling low and about to give up you massaged my arms, and it was at that time I really needed a friend. If you ever need a person to stand up for you, don&#8217;t ever hesitate to ask, because I would never let you down.� After kissing her hand once more he closed his eyes, and was once more asleep. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathan walked into the punishment room, and as he entered he saw the woman and she was standing in front of a girl. It was the same girl as he had seen in his other dream, but now she was quiet, there was no screaming and no laughing, and she was hanging weak and asleep. The woman with the whip turned around sharp and with the look of menace in her face, but on seeing him it changed to a smile. She put the whip down and said, �Come here Timothy,� and her hand was outstretched. He was not afraid as he walked closer, he took hold of the hand that was offered, and as he did so they the woman and he turned around to face the wall.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Point at the wall Timothy and make the light shine,� and he felt his arm point out at the wall, he was saying in his mind, �Open the gate for the Key Master,� and then a big light was shining from the wall. There was a girl in the mirror the same as the one in the frame, but there was green slime running from her belly. Then it stopped after a while, and as the light went off the wall appeared once more, then once more they both turned their attention back to the girl. But he couldn&#8217;t understand, why was he looking up at her, and he realised that the girl and the woman were giants.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Look around Timothy and find the door and open it with your hand,� it was the woman&#8217;s voice once more. He looked all around the room and pointed at one place in particular, and in his mind he said, �Open the wall for the Key Master,� once again a hole in the wall appeared and two Monks and a Nun walked out. 
The girl was placed on a stretcher and the Monks carried her out while the Nun stayed still looked at the woman. The Nun crossed herself and then crossed the air in front of the woman, and all the time she was reading from a prayer book. She then turned to him and she was looking down at him, �Bless you too Timothy Nathan,� and then made the sign of the cross and walked the way of the Monks.
Without being told he pointed at the hole and in his mind once more he said, �Close the door, I the Key Master commands.�
The woman turned at looked at him, and for the first time he could see her face clearly, it was Mistress Chrystal. �You now know who you are Timothy, and you must remember this that has taken place tonight, and in the coming of time you will be needed to help the Mistress of Chrystal house. Without you her doors cannot be opened, it is you with the power, and without you she will not be able to function.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;***
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carman was awake and went to work as usual, but said nothing to Jill when she spoke to her at break. She would sort Jill&#8217;s little mess out at a later date. She had to see the management about time off to go to the hospital, in reference to her miscarriage and was free in the afternoon. The rest of the morning went fast, and she was on her way home to get changed for the appointment. It was three in the afternoon when she arrived at the hospital and went to the maternity ward. She pressed the security button and waited. �Yes who is it?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I am Carman a friend of Don&#8217;s, and I have to see Tracy Aston I have something for her.� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Two minutes later a nurse came to the door, we will take anything you have for her as she doesn&#8217;t know you.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carman told the nurse that she would wait at the door for permission to see her, and handed her the large envelope. It was not long after when the nurse came back telling her to follow her. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At the bedside the girl asked �What the fucks going on, and who are you and are you trying to destroy my friendship with Don?� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carman told her about the affair and how Don had lied just to fuck Carman&#8217;s Marriage up. She also told her about the gift and the party.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You are trying to break Don and me up you filthy bitch, it&#8217;s all lies he would not do that.� As she said that a nurse came over and said is everything all right Tracy. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No this bitch is upsetting me. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Then I must ask you to leave young lady.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�In that case I will show you something to prove me correct and handed her the bill for the hall and the receipt for the bracelet. She then showed her the bracelet, and what was written on it. When she got out the video recorder and switched it on, the girl said �Fuck him�. Carman stood up and was about to walk away and leave Tracy crying. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The nurse said, �Look what you have done now you have upset her�.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carman looked at them both saying; �I have just saved her from doing something stupid. Her boyfriend has just cost me my marriage and a miscarriage, but she is only crying; you tell me nurse who has come off best?� Carman stood up and walked out of the ward.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;***
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathan opened his eyes and looked across at Penny in the other bed she had her eyes wide open and was looking back at him. �Good morning Penny; how long have you been awake?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Only a few minutes, but I have been looking at you sleeping and you are a very quiet sleeper. Now you are awake I can oil your body so turn over.� It was an hour before the both of them walked down to breakfast and she sat him down. Then she brought him his cornflakes and put them down in front of him. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I could have got those Penny you need not wait on me.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But I enjoy doing things for you Nathan, should I not do them?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The whole table of women were looking their way and waiting for his reply. Nathan put his hand on hers and smiled at her. �You must always do the things that make you happy, and if you are happy to do those things, then I am happy also.� He smiled at her once more, and she returned the smile as he picked up his spoon.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The morning started with Nathan walking down to the wood shed. The Mistress was looking out the window watching him get the tools out of the shed. Nathan then put them all down, and walked over to the three foot logs from the day before. He picked the big one up across his arms and started to bend up and down. Belle was stood beside her and asked �What is he doing Mistress?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Exercising and getting fit and healthy; how was he at breakfast?� Belle told her all that was said between him and Penny and the Mistress smiled. �They are good for each other Belle because they both understand each other&#8217;s feelings.� Nathan now had the smaller one and was lifting it above his head, and up and down. The Mistress watched him exercise for at least another half hour before he stopped and picked up the saw once more. The Mistress was deep in thought &#8216;Nathan knew things about her mother that she never knew, and he was trusted with her secret. At four years old he kept it to himself, and told no one, but it has been so long that he cannot remember the secret. What had his father got to do with her mother, was he a workman or was he a slave? She must have trusted him a long time, for him to save ten sovereigns. How come such a small child was there without his mother, and where was his mother?&#8217; She turned away from the window and walked down the stairs to the lounge that she used for an office. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Mistress walked into the room and over to the painting. �Hello mother, what secret was Timothy keeping? Who was Timothy?&nbsp; More to the point, who is Nathan? What was his father doing here, and was he a slave? Come on mother give me a break, you&#8217;re talking to him why not me.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Are you talking to the picture Mistress?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Mistress spun around on her feet and held her chest,�Damn it Belle, you nearly gave me heart attack, and yes I was talking to her, because she is talking to Nathan more than me. Look at her, looking back at me and smiling at my discomfort, just like she did when I was a child.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What do you mean she is talking to Nathan, I thought you said she was dead.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�She is, but do you remember the day of his whipping when he said he would not need the gag, well I thought he was talking to me but on thinking about it, I think he was talking to her. Well I was pulling back for some reason; it was as if my arm was heavy. He showed me a secret hiding place yesterday; that only he could have known about. He walked in here while I was sitting down here and walked up to the picture. Nathan just stood there looking at her with tears in his eyes. When I spoke to him he said Mistress Crystal was a very beautiful woman. He then told me about the photo of his father around in the punishment room, and I often wondered about that. If that is Nathans father in the photo; then tell me who is the other person in the photo next to it? He told me about my mother with him, and getting a ride around the estate in a horse drawn carriage, but the last time she did that was fourteen or fifteen years ago. Do you know that he never knew his mother, and I have been getting the strangest feelings about him all the time he has been here? Penny could sense something special about him right from the start, and she stands by him now.� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She walked to the side of the fireplace and stood looking out of the window at Nathan.�Do you know; that I looked out several times yesterday, and not once did I see him stop? He is a very hard worker and never complains, and the task I gave him was horrendous, and yet he made a joke of it, just like my mother did. Do you know what the strangest thing is; he told me he has an older half sister, and mother called him Timothy. I will go out there shortly and talk to him, so you had better tell Penny to get a glass of cold juice and come with me.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was fifteen minutes later when the Mistress and Penny walked out to where Nathan was working. Good morning Nathan we brought you out a cold drink and to see how you were getting on. She looked at the pile of timber and there was a considerable amount done. �You have done well Nathan another day will see you finished.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He took the drink off of Penny who was smiling towards him and said �Good morning Mistress. With all due respects, I notice that you have not lost your sense of humour, and if it is not an annoying question, what planet time scale do you work by, because it is not that of earth.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well it is an annoying question, and don&#8217;t ask again� and she and Penny laughed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathan looked up saying �God forbid is there no mercy from the ridicule, and whatever have I done to deserve this punishment?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They both laughed again. �To give you a break Nathan, this afternoon would you please mow the lawn front and back? I will send Belle down to the village to get you another five gallons of petrol and some oil. There is also some sand and cement in the brick building at the back, and you could use that to mend the crumbling wall.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Err....um.... is all this supposed to be done this afternoon Mistress, only I was wondering what time scale I was working on?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Don&#8217;t be silly Nathan, I don&#8217;t expect you to do all that in one afternoon; finish it off in the first hour tomorrow morning� Mistress Donna and Penny laughed as they walked away.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathan was called in at lunch time and as he walked through the door he heard the Mistress shout from the lounge. �Can you come in here Nathan and help us I have lost a stone out of my ring.� Nathan stepped into the room and saw all the women on their hands and knees. The Mistress showed him the other stones saying �It is one the same as those. There was a large dresser by the wall and Nathan headed for it. He lifted the corner of the dresser and moved it to one side, and then bent down to pick up the stone. Instead of standing up he was looking at the wall and never moved. The Mistress walked across and put her hand on his shoulder and asked �What is it Nathan.� Now the whole room of women were looking at him, and wondering what was wrong. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathan stood up and without saying anything handed the Mistress her jewel. He then walked over to the picture as if in a trance, as the women were still watching him. �I have remembered the secret Mistress Crystal, what do I do now?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Belle asked quietly �Has he lost his mind� As the Mistress put her finger to her lips telling her to be quiet.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once again he heard the voice in his head �Go to our first secret and take out your treasure Timothy and read the note� 
�Yes Mistress Crystal.� Nathan stepped to the side of the fireplace, and went down on his knees; he then turned a lion&#8217;s head in the metal fireplace surround and pulled. To the amazement of all in the room, that side of the fireplace opened and then he took out a soft bag. He turned around with tears falling from his eyes, and walked back to the Mistress. When he was standing in front of her once more, he opened the bag. He took out the note that was inside and read what it said.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I could always rely on you Timothy, Nathan, to do as I say and keep a secret. Now give this note to your half sister Donna, Marie, and show her our other secret. Put all your treasures together now Timothy, Nathan, because they will no longer be a secret. He handed the Mistress the note and walked to the oak panelled wall. Then putting his hand up he pressed a small section of panel and the wall silently opened. The silence in the room could be cut with a knife, while Nathan turned to look at the Mistress. �Mistress Crystal was my mother� and his tears were falling like rivers.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Mistress walked over to him and pulled him to her and asked �Do you know what is in there Timothy?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I only went there once and was told never to go there again by Mistress Crystal. There are some stairs that take you up to a room where there is a desk.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Do you want to come up there with me Timothy?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No Mistress it is your room to find, I will never go there again.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�But that does not mean now Timothy, our mother is dead.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�She might be dead Mistress, but she has just spoken to me. Do you want to see my treasure Mistress?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She could see that he was a bit shook up and said �Penny, go with Nathan, while he collects the rest of his treasure outside.� Penny nervously walked up to him, and he led the way outside to the garden.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Belle looked at the Mistress and said �I don&#8217;t know what to say?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Belle my mother; no our mother was actually speaking to him, and telling him what to do. When he told me he was in a horse drawn carriage, looking up at Mistress Crystal he must have been a baby. Do you know what the saddest thing has been, out of all the things that have taken place Belle? Well let me answer for you; I have ripped to pieces my own half brothers flesh with a whip.� The Mistress pushed the door closed saying �I will investigate after lunch.� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathan had been to the bathroom and washed, and when he walked into the dining room, Penny had moved from her normal place to the other end of the table. He walked to his own place at the end and walked past to Penny&#8217;s chair, and pulled it from the table. �Penny come and seat yourself down here with me.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�But you are a Master now�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Please come down here, and bring your plate and food and be seated next to me.� Nathan watched her get up and walk down to the seat, with the others watching. Once she had sat down and he helped her with her chair he sat down himself. He then looked at her and said �I will never be your Master; to you I am just plain Nathan� and he gripped her hand and squeezed it. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;***
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carman had just finished showering and changed to go to the shop down the road. Leaving the bracelet off, she put her coat on and walked out into the darkness. She was going the short cut through the park as she always did, when an arm went around her throat and held her tight. Then something hit her in the face, and the same thing happened several times until she passed out.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;***
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was late evening, and he was watching the world news on the TV in the kitchen; it then went over to the area news. Belle was about to turn it off when Nathan saw a picture of a woman badly beaten up. �Stop� Nathan shouted; �Please don&#8217;t turn it off.� The Mistress was looking at him in shock. The news caster was saying �A young woman was attacked tonight as she went to the shop at seven. As she was taking a short cut through the park she was assaulted; the police have appealed for witnesses. She is recovering at the Royal George Hospital and she has been named as Mrs Carman Green�. Mistress do you think you could speak to the hospital, speak to her and ask her what the hell happened, and you had better tell her it is me that wants to know. I know we have parted company, but that is a little over the top. If it was Don then tell her not to speak with the police; it will be taken care of.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Mistress got through to the hospital, and they told her that Carman was now at her home. The Mistress relayed the message to Nathan and afterwards they all retired.










CHAPTER FIVE

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathan woke up feeling Penny oiling his body, and the feeling was luxurious and he closed his eyes. The Mistress was stood in the doorway watching and smiling at Penny. �Your hands are so soft Penny; you have all day to stop doing that.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Penny struck his buttocks with the flat of her hand Slap, �Owe that hurt� 
�Don&#8217;t be silly I was swatting a fly now turn over.� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yea right and I&#8217;m Peter Pan� and then He heard the Mistress and Penny laugh, and he added �It&#8217;s a conspiracy.� He turned over onto his back and said �I hope you are not going to be silly today Penny?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Be quiet you talk too much and she kissed him quick on the lips.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Mm I could get used to that, remind me to add that onto the TLC that you are administering. Then again I fail to see where that slap on the ass came in.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After breakfast the Mistress walked out to him with Penny while he was outside and said �You don&#8217;t have to do this anymore Tim... Nathan?� What do you want me to call you now?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Either I don&#8217;t mind Mistress.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well stop calling me Mistress.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I can&#8217;t help it, I&#8217;ve got used to saying it now, and as for not doing this; I would like to add that it is getting me fit once more, and I enjoy being out here. At the end of the day the wood still has to be cut, and the estate still has to be looked after. Now is there any news on Carman?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Mistress told Nathan all that Carman had done to Don and his girlfriend, and that Carman could smell Don&#8217;s after shave when being assaulted, Carman also told the Mistress that she had not informed the police of that information, just in case they end up interviewing you. But she is now too frightened to leave her house.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathan looked at the Mistress saying �Something has to be done with him, and before he maims or kills a woman. You do know what I am saying Mistress?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I grant you your wish Timothy; it will be sorted out today. Do you want to be part of his punishment?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It is enough to know that you are taking care of business for me, and I do know that you are good at your work. There is one thing though Mistress, as he will be in your domain for a while, I would also ask that you show him a little mercy but only a little. His mental punishment will come from other sources. Now if you will excuse me ladies I have a small task to finish; by the way my treasure is on that dresser and it might surprise you. You had better tell Carman that she will have nothing to fear after tonight.
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;***
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Don was at work and at break time he was sitting with Jill, she said �I see that Carman got beat up last night it was all over the news.� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well you know there are some rough people in this neighbourhood� and he laughed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You do know that she is really pissed off with both of us at the moment, well you at least for fucking her marriage up. She doesn&#8217;t know about me, and she had better not find out or a certain picture, will find its way to the police station.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You told me that you had destroyed that Jill, what&#8217;s your fucking game.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Insurance, if you can do that to Carman, then I think you could do it to me. The picture is quite safe, and will remain safe as long as you never fuck with me. You&#8217;re a nasty person Don, you were at school and you are still the same, it is that part of you that I don&#8217;t like.�
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;***
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Don had been it the Old Malt House public house most of the evening, and he had been eying up the girl at the bar. She had looked over towards him several times and smiled, but she had another woman with her that was much older, and it was putting him off talking to her. He finished his pint and walked to the bar next to the girl, and as he ordered his pint he looked the girl in the face. �I haven&#8217;t seen you in this pub before, do you live local?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m staying here with my friend for a couple of days, I&#8217;m Penny what&#8217;s your name.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Don, would you like a drink?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No thank you, I have to get a lift in a minute.� As she spoke to Don, the woman that had been with Penny walked out. Don thought to himself then, that they had nothing to do with each other and moved closer. I am just going over the road to the phone box to call a taxi.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Look, I am just about to leave so if you like I will escort you to the phone box. It&#8217;s not safe around here at the moment; a young woman was attacked here only the other night.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Thank you, that is kind of you, and she picked up her bag off the bar top. Then turned towards the door, Don opened the door for her and she walked out. It was as he followed her out that he felt something stick in his arm, and then it went black.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;***
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathan was in bed and Penny walked in, and she picked up the oil, and started to oil his back. She never said anything but quietly went about her business, her hands were soft on his back and his eyes were closed. His body was beginning to heal, and she could feel that his muscles were now beginning to tighten up. The exercise outside with the wood was doing him good. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once again Nathan was dreaming, he was down in the punishment room sitting near the wall, there was a beautiful woman spread-eagled in the frame and she was naked. Mistress Chrystal was coiling up the whip and she walked over to the wall and placed it on its hanger. Then as she walked back she put out her hand, and again he walked over to her and took what was offered.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As he was standing there the woman looked down at him and he looked back into her eyes, there were two more looking back at him from within the woman&#8217;s eyes. They were evil but at the same time Nathan could see that they were in retreat, but the eyes were powerful and menacing, and Nathan knew that they meant him harm.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The scene changed and he was now outside with his father, and his father was kissing Mistress Chrystal, there were tears in their eyes, and he could not understand what was happening. They stopped their embrace and his father walked around to the other side of the car and a door closed. �Goodbye Timothy my silent witness, you must now go by your new name of Nathan, do all that you father says, and soon you will return to your real Mistress, and always remember Nathan, vengeance will be mine.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ***
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mistress Donna was down stairs and in the large room with the picture; she walked over to the dresser and looked at the bag Nathan had put there. She went to pick it up, and found that Nathan had made it look easy. So she used both hands, and walked over to her desk with the bag. Then once she had sat down she looked inside and there must have been at least five hundred sovereigns inside. She just sat there wondering what they were worth, because they were mostly in mint condition. The Mistress bent down, and after turning the combination on the lock, she opened the safe at the side of her desk, then she put Nathans bag of treasure inside, and then locking the door once more.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Don opened his eyes, and looked around the room trying to remember what had happened. He was in the pub and that was all he could remember, &#8216;what the hell happened and where am I?&#8217; He was pulled tight over a padded bench, with his hands strapped to the floor and the rest of his body held down tight. He could also feel that he was naked, and it was making him feel vulnerable, &#8216;fuck what&#8217;s happening to me?&#8217;
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The door opened and a woman walked in and she was smiling, he tried to speak but then found that there was a gag in his mouth. She walked to his front and looked down at him, and then walked all around him and looked at his body. Then once again she was in front of him and he started shouting through the gag. He was shouting where am I, what&#8217;s happening, why am I here, but all that came out of his mouth was a burbled noise? The woman just smiled, and walked out of sight leaving him frustrated.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mistress Donna walked into the dining room while the staff and Nathan were eating. �Have you been told Nathan; that our package has arrived, and he is now where you where five days ago. Would you like to see him before I start working on him?� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No Mistress, I think it best that he knows very little about why he is here.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I wish you would stop calling me Mistress.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I can&#8217;t help it, the name was beat into me� Then he laughed �Thinking about it, I must have called mother Mistress. Did you check out my treasure, Penny and I counted over six hundred coins? I have never seen so many sovereigns in one place.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�As many as that, have you any idea what you are going to do with them Nathan?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I haven&#8217;t thought about it, but I suppose they ought to be put somewhere safe. Have you checked out the secret yet?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No, I was going to do that sometime today, and your treasure is now in the safe. I will be going into the punishment room in a moment. Before I go in there is there anything you wish to say about his punishment.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathan sat there and thought then answered �He will be here a long time. I would not want to see him as scarred as I was, but at the same time he must feel pain. I was a little hasty yesterday and was not thinking straight, the usual welts that will fade in time. Looking around your room, I could see that you have a lot more things that would give him pain. I want him on his knees, for what he did to Carman, and I want him a broken man for what he did to my marriage. I believe that he in his stupidity and ignorance; was the reason for the miscarriage, and he must be punished. Then we will drop him back home hopefully with no scars except the ones inside his head, he will never again touch another woman. I have also just thought; that it might be best if I don&#8217;t see him direct at least, I would not want to compromise Carman on his release.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Then I will leave you to your work Timothy, and go about mine. We will talk this evening when things are a lot clearer.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Don was not in a very good mood because he was a little scared of why he was in the position that he was. He heard the door behind him open and close; then footsteps behind him. Thwack, his eyes opened wide and he screamed through the gag, the searing running through his buttocks was unreal. Thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, he was pulling on his restraints to no avail. Then as the last stroke fell he heard the footsteps once more, the woman from earlier was once more in front of him and holding a cane.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Now listen in you piece of filth, you have a multiple of crimes that you have been sent here for. A lot of people have paid a lot of money, to have you sent here for correction. Your crimes, are messing with other women, while your own woman is in hospital, giving birth to your Baby. While being unfaithful, you split a marriage up; it was done with little regard for the people that cared for each other. You also put a young lady in hospital, by punching her to the ground, and we have been told this from a reliable source. You will be here for a long time, because one person has been here before you, and had his body raked with pain all because of your wondering hands. It is because of him, that you will be punished, but unlike him your mind cannot be tortured the same way his was.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; It was just then that the women walked through the door; they too walked to his front.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You see these women; well let me tell you the same as I tell all my guests. They all hate men; each one has been beaten, and just like you beat Carman, so I would think that it would be fair to say, none of them will show you any more mercy than I will. It is no good begging for mercy, as there will be none here to give you, my friends and I have used all our mercy up, and this room is void of it. By the time this day is over, your body will have been kissed by the flogger many times.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once again this woman walked out of sight, and then when she came back she had the flogger in her hand. �My name is Mistress Donna, and if I think fit to ask you a question then you will answer by finishing your sentence with that name. If you need to ask me a question, which I might or might not answer, you will prefix the sentence or question with Mistress Donna. Do you understand?�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Don nodded his head with the little movement he had, looking all the time at the instrument she had in her hand and thinking. &#8216;He wanted no trouble with this woman. He had read about Mistress&#8217;s, and he knew that they could be a dangerous commodity. This one with her posse of women behind her; looked extremely dangerous. Who had grassed him up, and who had paid for this; he knew that it was not one person, because she had just told him so. It could not be Carman, because she as far as he knew was in hospital. Jill she had to be one because she knew all about him, she also knew what he had done to Carman. He admitted that putting her in hospital was a mistake; he was surprised that the police were not after him. But when the press interviewed her, she had told them the same as she told the police. That she had no idea who her attacker was. The only one he could think of was either Nathan or his ex girlfriend Tracy. Now her family were really pissed off with him, and they were very dangerous people.&#8217; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His thoughts were broken when he felt the flogger strike his buttocks, where only a short time previous the cane had left its mark, or so he thought. Thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, �I&#8217;ll bet you were not expecting that you slimy lump of shit. Well I have only just started and you&#8217;re screaming already.� Thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, Mistress Donna was hearing his scream&#8217;s on every strike. �What are you screaming for, I haven&#8217;t even started yet, and you have more of the same twice more today?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathan had been outside a few hours, when he felt that he was being watched. He looked up to the window and saw the Mistress looking down at him, and then he heard the voice. �Timothy your tormenter has had his first punishment of the day, but he is not scarred. That is how it should be, but after his third today, I will torment him through the night. For the pain he caused you, he will think he is living in hell. Show your sister the secret of the mirror; it is time to show your tormenter the wrath of hell. I will always be looking after you Timothy; your enemies are my enemies. No one has entered our secret Timothy, there is nothing there for either of you too fear. You too may go there but the ledger is for Donna Marie&#8217;s eyes only. You are still loyal and obedient to my commands, and I love you for it.� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mistress, but how long will you be here with me Mistress?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I will have to leave soon as my time will be over, but I will always remain here in your heart. There is another that has to be punished, and you will bring her to me, after this one has moved on. This one is a more serious challenge to Donna Marie, because she is possessed by the beast, and it will be the test of all tests. This is the same beast as Sister Clair, and life has turned a full circle at Chrystal House, the beast that sent you away, has now brought you back. I will visit you before I go to say farewell, the answers are in the secret room, but you and I know all the answers Timothy. I will leave you now and let you work back to health, and we will talk again Timothy.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Knowing that she had left his presence, he looked up, and saw the Mistress looking down at him still. He smiled in her direction and carried on with his work.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was an hour later when he walked in for lunch, and he had worked up an appetite. He sat down in his usual place and Penny was at his side, he smiled at her then started eating. Belle said �Don has had his first session; Mistress Donna said if you wanted to know how it went, I was permitted to tell you.� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�He probably screamed on every stroke, but there were no marks on his body; as Mistress Donna would not do that. He is only here while the Mistress of Chrystal house sees fit to punish him, but when he leaves this establishment, he will have scars of a different kind. He will leave a different person, shall we say more subdued and peaceful. Belle, would you ask the Mistress, if I could speak with him, but only after his third session of the day? Now if you will excuse me ladies, I must go and work, the shed is not full yet. He smiled at Penny and asked would you bring me a cold drink out in an hour&#8217;s time.� Then he gently squeezed her hand.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Belle had walked up to the private room of Mistress Donna; she sat down in the other armchair next to her looking at the TV screen. �Did Nathan ask about Don&#8217;s punishment Belle?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No, he told me that you had not marked him, but when he leaves here he will have scars of a different kind. He also said that Don was only here while the Mistress of Chrystal house sees fit to punish him.� Mistress Dona was wondering what he had meant by that, and then she got another surprise. �He has also asked me, to ask you, if he can talk to Don after his third punishment of the day?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�So he has decided to talk with him, I wonder what changed his mind, did you tell Nathan that there was going to be three punishments during the day?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No Mistress, I thought you had.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I can&#8217;t remember, but I suppose I must have done. I also think that we had better go and give Don some more of the same. Don will only get a light punishment because he will be here a long time.� The Mistress stood up and then stepped out of the door, Belle was close behind as she walked down the stairs. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They both walked into the punishment room together and without saying anything the Mistress picked up the flogger. She could see that don was asleep and it was time he opened his eyes. Thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, and Don&#8217;s eyes opened wide as the first stroke was felt on his buttocks. Then on every stroke afterwards he screamed through the gag, there were also tears falling from his eyes. The Mistress walked to his front and looked at him �Well I see that now I have your attention you slop of dogs piss. You have got one more session before you have a hot meal tonight, then your punishment will commence once again tomorrow morning. You will have a visitor after you have eaten, but I have no idea what that visitor is going to say to you. Your gag will remain in until after your third session today, and then it will be removed.� Then without another word the Mistress walked away and out of the room.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathan had been outside for an hour, when he saw the Mistress and penny walking out with the cold drink. He stopped and put the saw down, and he sat on the pile of logs that were waiting to be moved to the shed. The Mistress looked at the sweat shining all over his body and said �There is no reason for you to work so hard Timothy, there is the rest of the year to finish filling the wood shed.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It&#8217;s ok, I&#8217;m getting fit doing it, has Belle spoke to you yet about my request?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes and of course you can, whatever changed your mind? I thought you were worried that Carman might be implicated. Are you not worried about repercussions when he leaves here?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�When he leaves this establishment, he will be a different person to the nasty vile person that he is now. I will talk to him and put him in the correct frame of mind, so that he is under no illusion to why he is here. Before I go in I would like him to be blindfolded, and I know that you will have already placed him on the St Georges cross to sleep the night. I have another secret to show you tonight when I go down to see him, you have not been up into the secret room yet. There is nothing there to be frightened of; Mistress Chrystal gave you her blessing.� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�How did you know, that I was going to put him on the cross Timothy, I have never told you?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Do you know you look like our mother, so much, that when I see you looking down at me working, I think it is her? You also work in her same routine, and I remember from a long time ago, how our mother worked. As a child I remember walking into the punishment room on several occasions, the strangest thing was, Mistress Chrystal never chastised me for it. She sat me down on a bench, and I watched as she disciplined men and women alike. While I am out here drowning in my own thoughts, the memories come flooding back. I have visions and flashbacks of happy times, I have visions of people talking, but the same as when you&#8217;re a child, their language is alien. Mistress Chrystal; has told me, that she will not be here for much longer. She has also said; that she will visit us before she leaves.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Why is she talking to you Timothy; but she is not talking to me and never has done?� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I have no idea, but she has told me; that I may accompany you to the secret room, but there is a ledger there that I must not read, it is for your eyes only. So now you are equal with me, she is telling you secrets and keeping them from me. It might be best if we do this before this evening&#8217;s punishment.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�If you like Timothy, we can do it now, as we are both resting from our tasks.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Why not� He answered and put his shirt on.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was in the lounge that Nathan said �You had better go about your work Penny, I will see you at evening meal, promise me you will stay away from the punishment room. That man in there is pure evil, but his days of stupidity are over.� The Mistress watched him give her a kiss on the forehead, and she smiled as she walked away.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You two are good for each other Timothy; you get on so very well together.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes she is a very nice and caring person, and she seems to know what I want before I ask her. Now, let&#8217;s see what the room holds for us.� He then pressed the panel, and they watched; the door opened. The Mistress held back from entering and Nathan smiled, he stepped forward and took hold of her hand, then led the way up the stairs. There was a door at the top, and reaching out he pulled on the handle, with a creak of un-oiled hinges it slowly opened.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The room was lit up by a single sheet of glass; that ran from one end of the room above the shelves of books, and over to the other. It was three feet in width. The only reason that the window could not be seen from outside; was because of the foot high parapet, and that ran all around the roof of the house. There was a desk near the outside wall, so that the light was directly above. There were pictures on the wall, with a large portrait in the centre; there was no doubt that the portrait had been painted in oils. It had Mistress Chrystal in the middle, and she was holding a baby in her arms wrapped in a long shawl. There was a young girl at her side, and there was also no doubt that she was Mistress Donna. The strangest thing was his father was on the Mistress&#8217;s right smiling. On her left and behind Mistress Donna was another man but much older, and he too was smiling. The desk was covered in dust, and in the middle was the ledger, and on one side of the ledger were two sealed envelopes. One had Donna Marie, the other Timothy Nathan; there was a third, with Donna and Timothy printed on the front. Nathan looked at the ledger; it was large, two feet long, eighteen inches wide and one and a half inches deep. There was a buckle on its edge keeping it closed, He picked the ledger up then put it back down saying, the ledger is for your eyes only Donna Marie. As that is the case it might be better if leave it where it is, and up here you can read it at your own leisure. He picked up the letter that had his name on it, and tore the end open. He pulled out the paper and unfolded the letter. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Timothy, if you are reading this letter then I know you are home once more. I have very likely been talking to you, and once again you have been carrying out my wishes. I enclose with this letter a bankers note, that when you take it to the bank I have designated, along with your birth certificate, your inheritance will be clear. He looked at the certificate at the parent&#8217;s names, mother, Crystal Donna Marie Metcalf, father, Nathan Green, and then his date of birth. He showed the letter to the Mistress. Her certificate was the same but her father was Benjamin Oats.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mistress Donna picked up the third letter and pulled out its contents, she looked at Nathan saying �I will read this out loud Timothy�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Dear Children. You are probably wondering why you were separated from each other. Timothy knows why, but he is still remembering the past, and it is enough that you are now back together. Your fathers were more than my slaves, they were my lovers and they both kept me happy for all of my short life. I have but a few days to live, the poison that is in my body will soon kill me, I was born with it, but I have been informed that it cannot be passed on. There is a will in the ledger that is for your eyes only Donna, it has to be passed to you, as by now you are the Mistress of Chrystal house. Timothy knows what is in the ledger, because he has sat quietly and watched my work. The house is in both your names and there is a considerable amount of money for repairs and upkeep of the estate. You own eight thousand acres around the estate between you; the rent has been paid into your bank accounts from the day Timothy was born. I know that the two of you will do the right thing between you.
All my love mother.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I must go back down to the punishment room Timothy; we have the rest of our lives to talk about this. I would like you also to start calling me Donna, it is your right, and I will never be your Mistress again.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yes well I had better go and put the tools away M....Donna.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That&#8217;s better see you after evening meal. They walked down the stairs together leaving the letters on the desk with the ledger. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Down in the basement Don was waiting for her to arrive, the girls have woken him up in preparation. The Mistress walked in front of him, and looked down, she could see the pain in his eyes. �You are a sorry piece of crap aren&#8217;t you; I&#8217;ll bet my house, that you wish you were a better person. Look where you are now, strapped to a bench, and then three times a day you will be beat. There are no marks on your body, but the pain will be etched into your mind. Now I am going to give you the same as you have had twice today, and only then will you will be fed. Do not try to escape while this is taking place, because the five women that you see in this room; have all dealt with far stronger men than you. Do not speak, or ask questions, because they will not be answered. Your visitor tonight will talk to you, and it will be he that answers your questions. Now, I think we had better get started, as today is running long.� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was a few seconds after she had walked out of his vision that the pain started, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack. �That is you last punishment from me today, but you will have more of the same tomorrow. Girl&#8217;s feed him, toilet and shower, and then put him on the cross for the night, blindfold him until his visitor sees him.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Mistress once again walked out of the room. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was two hours later when Nathan walked into the punishment room with the Mistress. He saw the women standing around watching, and he walked to the wall that was opposite the cross that don was on. It was another panelled wall; he counted the panels from the brick pillar, and touched it with his hand. The wall spun around like a revolving door, and now there was a large mirror showing in place of the panels. Nathan still never said anything until he was in front of Don. �Could we now have his blindfold and gag taken away, he has no further use for either.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Belle walked over to the back of Don and started carry out his wishes. While this was taking place, Nathan walked over to the women. He took hold of Penny&#8217;s hand and walked her over to his sister. �I told you not to come down here while this man is here.� He said in a quiet voice. �Now you are here remain next to the Mistress,� He walked back to Don and looked at him. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well if it isn&#8217;t the little boy with the little dick; that had a man to do his work for him. I had to make love to your wife, because you were not man enough to do it. It is all around town that you could not satisfy Carman, and just to please you she was always faking it. Wow, I had some of the best sex that I have ever had with your wife. I spent a whole night fucking her in your bed, and she gives the best blow job in the town. What&#8217;s up you miserable fart, cat got your tongue? I&#8217;ll bet you got your ass beat well while you were here, and I bet you screamed on every stroke. Well as you see I am a man and after a day I can take anything this bitch serves me.� Nathan never tried to intervene or stop him from talking, and the whole room could see that he was in control of his feelings.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You are here Don because of me, I had you brought here, and it is I that is having you punished. There is not one ounce of good in your soul, and I know that you will come to find that fact out. Before your eyes in the sleeping hours, you will see the rivers of blood run, and it will drip from your soul in this very room. Each tear you cry and each drop of blood will be the evil returning to hell. Then every time you look in a mirror you will see only a death mask over your face. The Mistress is only giving you light punishment, and that is because I asked her to do so. She is only softening the flesh for the blood to flow easy, the real marks that will linger, can only be seen in that mirror of your soul. You have ruined the lives of people that trusted you, and for every bad deed there is a debt to pay. The mirror will be your witness to your punishment, but after you will be a better person for it.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�My god you do talk a load of crap, you cannot mark me, because I will have the law on you when I leave here. I am already a better person, well; I&#8217;m a better person in bed than you.� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Don stopped talking as he saw Nathan kick his shoes off, then he undid his belt and let his trousers fall to the floor. He pulled his shirt over his head and said �Take a look at my body� The oil was making the scars and bruises stand out, and he turned around slowly. Don was now looking at Nathan with his eyes open wide, because the sight of his body was horrendous. �This was after four days, because Carman in her foolishness did not read the contract. She asked for me to be punished hard and three times a day, she wanted to see scars; well she got what she demanded. However I forgive her for her stupidity, but you could never beg me for the same. You step out behind young women in parks, and beat them senseless because you can. You told lies and conspired with a treacherous girl, just to make my name black in the face of Carman. You instigated my punishment here, and my body shows the result of your meddling.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Looking at your body, I would think that it all went better than I could ever expect. You are a gutless piece of dog shit, and I know and so do you, that you will not put a mark on my body in case of reprisals from the authorities.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You are correct I will never ask for a mark to show on your skin, but I am not in fear of the authorities. There will be marks, and they will be deep, and they will be with you for the rest of your life. You will see them, the evil will have stopped flowing, but the scabs closing the cuts will remain on your flesh, encrusting your body like the bark of an oak tree. You will be punished, and you will be scarred, but as I said you will end up making your own prison. Do you hear what I am asking for Mistress Chrystal?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I hear you Timothy his soul is mine, and vengeance will be mine.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Thank you.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The voice was heard by Mistress Donna, and it was then, that the Mistress realised, who he had been talking to, but she could not understand, most of what he had been talking about. Nathan put his clothes back on and said to all in the room �I think we will leave Don to get what little rest he can.� He walked over to Donna and Penny and slipping his arm through Penny&#8217;s arm he led her towards the exit. As he walked past the mirror, he stopped and looked a Don �Keep looking at the mirror Don, and you will see your fate arrive, now that you show no remorse for your crimes, I cannot stop what has been started.� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Once outside in the hall Nathan looked at Donna saying �You must read the books for your own sanity. Mother will harm no one in the house, but revenge for my pain I will have.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The voice in their heads spoke once again, �Vengeance is mine, Timothy.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 











CHAPTER SIX

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While the others were in the lounge watching the television, Dona had walked up to the secret room. She stepped over to the desk and sat down, she was about to open the book, but noticed that her hands were shaking. She had no idea why she was feeling this way, because Nathan had told her that it was her right to read the book. Then once again she put her hand close to the catch, and she heard a voice, �Do not be afraid, Donna, there is nothing that can harm you in the book, it will make your destiny clearer.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Is that you mother?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Be obedient like your brother Donna, and do as you&#8217;re told.� 
Donna wiped the tear from her eye and answered �Yes mother� now with confidence she reached out to the book and opened the clasp. Then timidly she pulled the heavy cover open, and letting it sit on the desk, as she looked, she could see another envelope. 
On the face was written, last will and testimony of Chrystal, Donna, Marie Metcalf. And underneath was written, for my Donna, Marie&#8217;s eyes only. Donna picked it up and broke the seal, then after taking the parchment out, read the contents. �By now Donna, Chrystal House will once more be alive, and your half brother will be at your side. You have a destiny to fulfil and you cannot flinch from it, it is in your blood to carry on from where my short life made me stop. This house has been in our family for many generations, and your daughter will be there after you. You are the custodian of the St David&#8217;s Charter House, discipline and correction. You must read the book that is now in front of you, and in the pages you will be told how to contact the brothers. They will inform you of what needs to be done, they will see to your expenses through their own agents.�
�The house is yours until you die, but you are only the caretaker, and your daughter will follow after you. You will shortly have bestowed on you a power, it is a good power that all the white witches have. This may be a shock to you, the same as it was a shock to me, when I was told the same.�
�You have been told of your inheritance, both you and Timothy will never want. By now, I know from the readings, that he has found his real soul mate, and he will be happy once more. I will always talk through Timothy, because his mind has not been hardened, and his quiet nature will not be turned.�
�I expect you have wondered where I was buried because you see no grave; the monks have placed me behind the Mirror, in a stone casket laid in state, along with your ancestors. I await your coming of age, so that I might pass on the power and sleep in peace. This book that you are about to read, is only the last year of my life, the others will be carried to my grave, and buried along side of me, they will be my testimony to my Gods.�
My love to you both, Mother.

Donna placed the parchment back in the envelope, and placed it back on the desk. She then started to read the book, thinking that it was a diary, but found it to be in the form of a story.
�He has been flogged and beat with the rattan cane, but still the evil is in his eyes, the court of St David has deliberated. The priest will be brought here in the hours of darkness, and then it is expected of you to draw the evil from his body, his sins are great, and he must pay the price for walking the dark road. This evening our agents will bring him, and we know of your power of the whip Mistress Chrystal, may your god be with you.�
Donna noticed that the writing differed from the one she was about to read now,
�Leonard was brought to me at the stroke of midnight, and as the agents of St David&#8217;s Charterhouse walked him in, I could sense the evil in him. On the cross I told them, facing his image, he must see his evil flow from his body. With that the agents walked him over to the St Georges cross and fastened his bonds, there was no struggling at his bonds, just the quiet resignation that justice was about to be carried out. The agents, with their heads bowed and covered by the red hoods on their cloaks, walked out of my workplace, they were feared to look directly at me. They knew full well, that next time it could be one of them, and they had no need to get familiar with their tormentor. I walked up to him knowing that I was safe from his evil ways, I&#8217;ve had them all, the screamers, they scream abuse trying to put their own fear on me, but I have screamed back at them, showing them that I was the one in charge of their destiny. Some have growled like a dog, showing their teeth, but like a wild dog, I have used a muzzle to keep them quiet. Then there are the ones like Leonard, quiet and watching my every movement, with his wide open eyes staring, not wishing to miss any movement I make, his type are the worst. They are fakers of pain, and after each stroke they whimper like a puppy, and in the hope that I will show them mercy, but on walking close, I can see only laughter in their eyes. Their laughter is silent, but when the night comes and they see their image, then their screams of fear can be heard only by their gods.� 
�Morning comes and I see to my guest, and on seeing me he knew that there was pain to come, and he smiled a sinister smile. This one will be a hard nut to crack, they always are when they are young and strong, he is looking at me knowing that his manhood is standing proud, and hoping he will shock me, but I have seen this and worse before. My assistant asks me, if he should gag Leonard, but my answer is no, his screams must be heard by himself when the darkness arrives.�
�My assistant hands me my whip, and on receiving it I throw the tail to the front, the tail passes his feet, and I step back with arm outstretched. As I move the tail is now in line with his body, and then without warning I pull back my arm, in an instant my movement is reversed, and the sound of the whip striking his flesh is deafening. Snap! I look only to see that grin of defiance, Snap! It strikes him once more, and I see the red stripe appear across his chest, the bull whip has no friends, it treats all in the same manor. Snap! He throws his head back in a mock fright, but he is looking at me side on with a smirk on his face, his eyes wide open like pigeons eggs. Snap! His face is looking directly at me, but now he is laughing out loud, trying to provoke me into hurting him, but that is not the point of the whipping. The evil must flow out, and all the time he is not cut, it will remain in his body. Snap! The whip is striking his flesh, but the skin has not been broken, both my assistant and I know; that this is just the lull before the storm. Snap!� 
�My concentration is broken by the opening of the basement door, no one dares to enter while I am delivering justice, and I turn with a scowl on my face for this blatant intrusion. But my face softens as I see his smiling face; I put down the whip and walk over to where Timothy is standing, I kiss him on the cheek and sit him on the chair, just like I have done so many times before. I walk back to the whip, and without another word I administer another six strokes. Leonard smiles are no more, but there is still no sound, and his eyes are more slanted, as if slyly working out a plan. His chest is now red because of the criss-cross of stripes mingling together, but still no cuts, because the punishment must be light for him to survive. Leonard will receive more on his back this evening, then after his meal, he will be turned to face his image. His night will be long; as he watches his body give up the evil, it will be then that he cries.�
Donna sat back trying to digest all that had been said in the book, she had felt as if she had been there with her mother. Nathan had been there, and for a fleeting second she felt cheated, and jealous of Nathan for being favoured, but then reality came back, and she realised that she must have been at school. Nathan was right, their mother never scolded him for being in her place of work, she was a loving mother, and she was nurturing his education. It was for this reason, that Nathan had no need to read the book, he had firsthand knowledge of what had taken place, and what was expected of her. She looked at her watch, and seeing that it was late, she closed the book using the will as a marker; she then stood up and walked back to the drawing room. On entering she closed the secret entrance and walked up the stairs, and at the top she walked into Nathans room.
He was on the bed facing down and Penny was rubbing oil into his back, she went to stand up, but the Mistress told her to carry on. Donna sat on Penny&#8217;s bed and looked at him, and then she said, �You know what is in the book because you were there, when it all had taken place, it is a journal of all that our mother did for the Charter House. Mother trusted you such a great deal, and not once did you let her down; she has mentioned you on the very first page.�
�As you read the book you will understand, and when you and I are alone I will try and explain what I know, but before then you must read more. She visited me on the first night, a long time after you had left the basement; her cool hand caressed my flesh, and just as Penny is doing now. Mother was taking away all my hurt, and when she left me alone once more, there was only a tingle remaining. She told me that she was looking after me, and I was not to disrespect you, I had to hold my tongue. The reason that mother speaks with me, is because there is a childlike bond between us, and a trust of loyalty to each other. There is a far greater bond between mother and you, if the book has not already told you; it will very soon do it. You have a hard life ahead of you Donna Marie, but I will stand at your side if you need comfort.�
The Mistress was about to say something, but as she looked across at him, he was asleep with a smile on his face. She then looked at Penny, and she too had a smile on her face. �Look after him Penny, because he will always look after you,� then the Mistress stood up and walked out of the room. Penny pulled a sheet over Nathan and stripped off her clothes, she slipped into the opposite bed, and while looking at her man, she slipped into a deep sleep.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;***
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Don had fallen asleep, but he woke up in shock, there was a pain running through his body; something had just struck him across the chest. He opened his eyes, and after adjusting them to the light he could see what caused it; the Mistress was stood in front of him, and coiled in her hand was a whip. She had a menacing smile on her face and she was generating hatred towards him, and he felt ripples of fear running through his body, the fear being pushed on by the rivers of adrenalin. �I see that I have got your attention,� she spoke with coldness in her voice �So now it is now the turn of the whip, for you slave there is no rest. I have all night to pick at your body and rip it to shreds; you see this whip, well be assured that it is not a kind instrument of pain. But first, I think we will have a little fun, and we will start with questions and answers; you do know how the game works don&#8217;t you, and you do know the respect that I am looking for?� Don looked at her not knowing what to say or expect, then she shouted �Answer my question you evil filth.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mistress, I know how the game works.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good, I hate it when I have to give instructions, all those that are punished by me should know how to play my game. The rules are simple, there are no rules,� and she gave an even colder laugh, putting more fear into his trembling body. �Now the first question, why did you go to all the trouble of getting my child punished?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I have not done anything like that; someone has told you a lie Mistress.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; �How dare you disrespect me by starting the game with a denial of the crime� she shouted. Don saw her throw the end of the whip back, and then quick as a flash, her arm that was holding the whip moved like lightning. Snap! The whip caught him on the chest, and it was painful, and it made him scream in pain. �That was a lie; I myself have seen the scars on his body. There are lacerations all over his body, deep cuts, and they were put there by your hand. You might not have been holding the whip, but it was you that guided the hand with your deceit. These deeds were being inflicted on his body, while you were enjoying pleasures that belonged to him. He was being brought to his knees, and it was all carried out in your name, and just for lust. The pain that you inflicted on his body, will now come back to haunt you tenfold. Like you were his tormenter of the mind through others, I will be yours. He seeks revenge and I am his champion, and vengeance will be mine. You, you disgusting worm, are going to be severely punished, and you will only have the same amount of rest as my child had. Now I think that I must give you some more pain, to compensate for his innocence.� Once again Don watched in fear, as the Mistress pulled back her hand, then the sudden forward movement. Snap, snap, snap, Don was now giving a horrendous scream on every stroke of the whip. Snap, snap, snap, �You are going to regret the day you messed with my child&#8217;s life.� Snap, snap, snap, �I am going to tear the flesh from your soul, and let your demons out. The filth will run from your body like blood, at this very moment in time, every cut of the whip is just that, a cut.� She stepped aside and pointed to the mirror, �Look at your body you evil slime.� For the first time he looked at the mirror. The sight that reflected back, made him scream out loud, his body now looked horrific. The Mistress had cut his body on every stroke, and now the blood was pouring from his body.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No, no, no, what are you doing, I will get the police and you will be placed in prison.� It was lame, and he knew that while in the position he was in, the bonds would hold him firm.&nbsp; �Get a doctor, I will bleed to death, please give me mercy Mistress.� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�There will be no mercy forthcoming for you, that blood you see pouring out of your chest; is the essence of evil. There are no police that could put me in fear, where I am they cannot reach, I am a free spirit, but I will give my child the justice that he seeks. Soon all that will be left is your naked soul, look at your face you miserable wretch.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Don looked at his face, and he could only see the white face of death, it had two black holes where the eyes should be, white lips, and the scalp was void of all hair. Once again he screamed, he was now trying to shake away his bonds, and the Mistress laughed at his discomfort saying �You only have a few days left, so fear me, because I will be showing you a living hell. There will be no police for either you or me; we are both prisoners to the hell in the mirror. But cleaning your body and that of your co-conspirator of the evil, and releasing it from your soul, will be the last act I do before I am released from my bond.� She walked over to him and stood close, and then with a deliberately hard action, the Mistress slowly raked her nails over his chest. Once again he screamed at the top of his voice, shouting mercy, and again she gave him a blood curdling laugh. �Look� She told him, as she held her hand in front of his face; her long slim fingers with the pointed nails were dripping with blood. �That is arrogance, contempt for others, jealousy and ignorance. Stand there the rest of the night and watch the evil pour out of your life.� Don screamed and closed his eyes, and when he opened them she was gone. The lights were now off and he could not see the mirror, he was bleeding to death and no one cared. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;***
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathan woke up to the sensation of Penny gently oiling his back and he looked around a smiled at her. �I hope you are not going to say anything sarcastic this morning, Nathan.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Heavens forbid just in case that damn fly is around once more.� Penny laughed �I will speak with the Mistress today Penny, I do not wish for you to go into the punishment room again while that piece of garbage is in there. His mind is going through a change and he is not very nice.� The Mistress was walking past the open door when she heard him say that and walked in the room.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Why do you say that Timothy, sorry, I was just walking past the door, when I heard what you were talking about? If you do not want penny to go there then that is fine, I would rather her work with the cook anyway.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You must read the journal M....Donna; it will inform you of all you need to know. I know what it says, as I was there at the time, and I also watched all that had taken place. Mother was very secretive, and I kept her secrets, I only show you the ones that she wishes you to see. I will never go against her wishes, and I know that you would not want me to. Once you have read the journal you will understand. I have also remembered the reason, as to why I had to leave here, and it is all written down in the journal. There will be a change in Don this morning, he will be unsure of you; he will also say things that don&#8217;t seem right to you. Your head is full of questions, and I know the answers, but all those same answers are in the journal. Our mother was a very fearsome woman, but all that felt her wrath, sooner or later received her compassion.� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I will go and read the journal, but it will be after I have put Don in his place, he will get his punishment, and then he will be tormented by one of the girls for a few hours.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was an hour later, when the Mistress walked back into the punishment room, as she opened the door Belle was turning the light on. Don screwed his eyes shut, and started to cry; the Mistress walked over and said �Stop crying you big baby.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Please Mistress; stop the bleeding get a doctor.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What bleeding and where, there is nothing wrong with you, open your eyes?�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You ripped me to pieces with the whip last night.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Mistress was about to say something then stopped, what was he talking about? �There is no blood and no marks on you, that is sweat you fool.� 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I can see myself in the mirror, take a look Mistress.�
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Mistress looked around, and the thing was, the mirror had been turned around and the panels were now showing. She was trying to remember, whether the mirror was turned back last night, before they all left the room. She ran her hands over his chest and put it up in front of him, �Look do you see blood?� His eyes opened and he could see no blood on her hands, he then started to shake.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Donna walked over to the wall and picked up the whip and looked at Don, and then she put the whip back up. She then turned to the girls saying �Place him in the frame face up for the flogger.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In less than ten minutes Don was laying on his back, with his legs in the air. He could not move his head and there was a gag in his mouth. �You are going to get pain all day today you great puddle of piss. I hope you are as strong as Nathan was, he could take the beating that I am going to inflict on you, I just wonder if you are as big and strong, as you would like people to think you are.� Don was watching as she lifted her arm, and before the flogger touched his flesh he was screaming into the gag. Thwack, thwack, thwack, Mistress Donna was smiling as she brought the flogger down on his arms. Either side of his head were little puddles where his tears had dropped. The flogger was being moved at every strike along his arms, the most painful being the ones that struck his arm pits. She struck him another ten times, before she stopped and looked at his red flesh, there were no cuts. She knew that she had struck hard enough to hurt him bad, but not hard enough to break the skin. Don was now unashamedly crying, and the Mistress said, �You are not such a big man now are you; I&#8217;ll bet you wish you had never set sight on Nathans wife. Then after discarding her like trash, you went and assaulted her like a spoilt child that has lost his toy. You are a useless specimen of a man, well I have had my fun now it is the turn of the girls, fetch me the surgical tape and the scissors.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A few moments later the girl came back and was told to cut twenty, one inch squares. Once it was done the mistress stuck them all over Dons body, and two on his pubic area, and some on his inner thighs. He had long hair all over his body, and the Mistress knew that this was going to hurt him. The Mistress looked at her watch and said, �Right girls you have until five tonight when it will be his next punishment session, to take that tape off as gentle as you can, and try and keep in mind he beats young girls up.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathan was outside cutting the wood, and the Mistress was standing at the window looking out. Even the distance away from where she was standing, she could see the muscles on his arms getting bigger, the sweat was running off of him and she could see that he was also a lot fitter. The pile of wood was receding fast, and there was only a quarter of the pile left to cut. The wood shed was almost filled and the place was beginning to get back into the shape it was in when she was a child. He never stopped working, it was as if he was on a mission, and the other thing that she noticed was the fact that he was always smiling. She turned and walked to the secret doorway, and pressed the panel; once the door opened she walked up the stairs. She sat down at the desk once more and opened the book, and turning the page she began to read.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Leonard was a little more subdued this morning; I know that during the night he had seen his demons. How much evil had flowed out of his system I have no idea, but gone had the smirk and so to those wide staring eyes. I could see the tiredness in his face, and knew that his reflection had given him no peace. I walked over to him and stared back into those vacant eyes, looking for the man beneath, but the evil was still filling his eyes. �Turn him� I said to my assistant, and in a matter of a few moments Leonard was facing the other way.
He received ten lashes of the whip across his back, before I turned him to face me once more. His head was now hanging down in tiredness; Leonard was not as strong as I first thought. But he had another night to endure before he would eventually be free of his evil bonds. I told my assistant to make him a light soup and feed him while on the cross; it was still not safe to sit him down. I will give him ten more strokes before we retire this evening, and tomorrow the agents can collect, he will be clean once more, and I will be blessed until the next. 
I have come down in the night, and looked at their reflections, and I have seen the evil flowing from their body, it is an awesome sight. But when they leave this establishment, all my pupils are of a changed disposition. I have wondered on many occasions whether I myself was evil, but I have seen these same charges walking the street weeks later, and have spoken with them, not one recognised me, and all were sane. I have had them all here monks, nuns, priests, and the strangest of all the teachers. Sometimes the agents bring the man or woman off the street, but they have all been treated with dignity, because in the end they are all brothers and sisters.�
There was then a break in the passage, and it was then noticeable that her mother was taking a break from the whipping. 
�After writing the journal this morning I walked out of the wall, Timothy was sitting waiting for me, and he smiled as I walked over to him. There is only Timothy and I, that know of this secret passage, my assistant never comes into this room he is not allowed. Timothy knows all my secrets, I have told him all about the Charter House, and shown him the secret of the mirror, just as I have shown him my work. It was in his interest to know, because in a later date he will help his sister, the new Mistress of Chrystal house to perform her duties. He knows how to bring the mirror to life, open the door to send the evil back to hell, and he is the one with the magic and compassion. He is only four but he had to be taught these things, it was on the instructions of the highest authority in the Charter House. Soon, because of this knowledge I will have to send him out of my life, he will go with my assistant, it will not be until my demise, but I will remain in his heart. His return will be as painful, but I will look after him, he is my flesh and blood, and his little body is the keeper of my secrets. I gave him another sovereign this morning, and told him to go and put it with the rest of his treasure, and then I stood at the window and watched him hide it in the wall. He always smiled as he walked back to the house, and on looking up to the window and seeing me, I always smile back, we keep each other&#8217;s secrets.�
The Mistress came to the end of that page, and once again put her marker in then closed the book. Her mother had written this book in the knowledge she was going to die, and she was giving Nathan her knowledge, so that when her daughter was old enough she could take over. But why did she not just tell her, why was Nathan so important, and why was he sent away? Donna stood up once more, and walked out of the room and into the drawing room, and she went straight over to the window and looked out. Nathan was cutting the wood still, and she looked at his torso; he was becoming a man before her very eyes. She then realised, that her mother knew that he would come back to Chrystal house, and she also knew that he would receive a lot of pain on his return, she also knew about Penny. Penny was out there now sitting on the wood, watching him work and talking to him. Penny also knew from day one that Nathan was special, she watched over him and helped him to recover, she remembered the kiss Penny gave him while he was on the cross awaiting punishment. She heard Bell shout them both for lunch, and it was then that Donna realised how late it was. 
It was after the meal when Nathan was about to walk outside, Donna walked out of her room. �I&#8217;ll walk with you to the shed Nathan, and we can talk about mother. Penny, would you bring Nathan a cool drink out in half an hour.� Penny smiled and walked away, and left the Mistress going out the main door with Nathan. �Tell me about the mirror Nathan, how does it work, it is talked about in the book but it is vague? Have you seen what it can do; only I feel that my mother had seen the power it holds? She speaks of you entering the room while she beat the evil out of the....I can only presume religious members of our community.�
�It is not just our community, they are brought from all over the world, and they have been waiting for the tenth of this month, and that is your birthday and coming of age. In ten days time, mother will pass on her power to you, but before then you must be made aware of your trade. Mother was cruel to the people that were brought to her, but once they were clean of the evil she was very compassionate towards them. There are people that are good people, but they have turned to the evil side of life, and they have turned to the extreme, priests, nuns, monks, and teachers of religious orders throughout the world. Mother whipped them hard, but when the whip touched their skin, it never once broke the skin, but at night their reflection stripped the evil from their body. The only thing that mother was doing, was showing the mirror the exit wounds, and the mirror would draw out the filth of evil, during the sleeping hours. I know this to be true, because one night I woke up, I could not find mother, and after walking down stairs, I saw the basement door open. It was not curiosity that made me go down there, but mother said it was my destiny, the door was open and I was supposed to walk down. As I reached the bottom of the stairs, mother looked over and saw me, her face changed from a serious expression, to that of a smile. She walked over to me and took hold of my hand, she walked me to the side of the mirror and pointed, the man that was on the cross had no marks on his body, but his reflection was dripping the fluid of evil. She said, show the Mistress of Chrystal house when the time comes Timothy, but at the time I had no idea what she meant until you have just asked about it. If you like we can both go and watch the mirror work tonight, Mistress Chrystal will serve Don the whip before midnight, it will be at one when the mirror works. You do realise that that Carman&#8217;s friend must be brought here also, for the cleaning, you cannot change destiny, and mother must have her vengeance. She will come to no harm, and she too will leave here a better person.� It was just then Nathan saw Penny walk out with his drink, �Now that&#8217;s what I call timing�.
Donna looked around and saw Penny and smiled, �You get on well with her Nathan, and you are good for each other.�
�You do know that once you have made contact with the Charter House you will not be able to have all the girls down there with you, I think Bell will be all you need. I will always be available to help you, and Bell must never know about the mirror. My father never knew about it, and neither did yours, the secret is ours and it must remain that way. Have you noticed that your customers have almost dried up?�
�Yes I was wondering about that, have you any idea why that is?�
�The elders of the Charter House have pulled the plug on your advert on the web; you cannot do your work if your mind is diverted. Mother has told me in dreams before I was brought here, but I never understood what she was talking about. By being here it has awakened my memory. You must read the rest of the book, to gain knowledge and speak to the elders.�
Donna was just about to walk away when she stopped and looked at Nathan, �Thank you Nathan� then she put a hand gently on each of his cheeks, and kissed him on the forehead. When she stepped back, there was a tear running down his face.
�Sorry Donna, but mother used to kiss me just like that, and in that same way.� Penny who was standing at his side, put her arm around his back, and smiled at the Mistress. She smiled back and walked away, back to the house.
Once back in the house Donna walked into the drawing room and looked out the window, Penny was once again sitting on the cut wood talking to Nathan. They were both smiling and it made Donna smile, Belle walked in the room ant looked out the same window. �Should I go down and tell her to leave Nathan alone Mistress, she should be in the kitchen with the staff.�
�No she is fine, I doubt that she will be doing much work soon, she will be too busy looking after Nathan. Look at them Bell, they were meant for each other, there is a chemistry between them that is natural.� She stepped back from the window and added, �I think it is time that I see to the comforts of our guest.�
Down in the basement, the Mistress walked over to where Don was still strapped to the table. She looked at his body and could see all the places that the tape had been, when they had been removed, it left a patch of pink skin and no hair. �Well I&#8217;ll bet you&#8217;re wishing that you had been a better person, but it&#8217;s too late for wishes, and I only ever grant them at Christmas. I&#8217;m going to use the flogger on you, and then once you are a nice rosy red, to match those little red squares, you can have some food. Then I think that you can stay on the cross once more tonight, I&#8217;ll bet you&#8217;ll like that, you can look at the mirror all night and then you will be able to see how hard you are.� On saying this he tried to pull at his bonds, and he was screaming into the gag.
Donna walked over to the table and picked up the flogger, then once she was back near him she commenced with his punishment. Thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, the look of shock on his face as the strokes were hitting him just above the groin area. Thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, he was shouting on every stroke and tears were running from his eyes. �Yes that&#8217;s right you puddle of dogs piss, Nathan had tears in his eyes, but he never screamed like a baby.� Thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, Donna had now just delivered six hard strokes to his thighs and both were red. �I think it is time to strike the thing between your legs, the thing that made Carman, lose her baby.� She saw the surprised look on his face, and added �Yes that&#8217;s right you puddle of filth, she had a miscarriage and all because of your lust; you are a killer of unborn children, a disgusting replica of a man. Your child was being born in a hospital, while you were a few miles away killing another.� She saw his eyes close and more tears, and she knew it to be because of what she had just told him. �She had the right to tell the mother of your own child, just what a disgusting person you are.� Thwack, thwack, thwack, thwack, those four strokes struck him across the groin; they were not hard, but hard enough. �Release him, help him to the table and feed him, see that he goes to the toilet and put him on the cross.� 










CHAPTER SEVEN

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Snap! It seemed as though Don had only just closed his eyes, when the pain ran through his body. His eyes opened in shock, and standing in front of him was the Mistress, and she looked even fiercer now, than she did during the day. �Why are you tormenting me like this, why can&#8217;t I have sleep?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�My child had no sleep because of you, and it is only right that you should get none.� Snap! The whip struck him across the chest and he screamed with the pain, snap, snap, snap, �You have a lot of pain before I will see the real you.� Snap, snap, snap, snap, �I see no remorse in your eyes, only the traits of the faker, you snivel and cry, hoping that the Mistress will show you mercy, but there will never be mercy until you are clean.� Snap, snap, snap, those three caught him near the groin and his scream was horrendous. But the Mistress still looking at him smiled, and then she shouted �Stop that noise you wretched person, tomorrow it will be the turn of the thing between your legs.� She saw his eyes light up, in the realisation how vulnerable he was, and he was mouthing no, no, no, but no sound was leaving his mouth. �Yes, you have just come to the conclusion that you are helpless, it is now the turn of the one that you tormented to torment you, and he knows the way of the Mistress.� Snap, snap, snap, snap, snap, snap, those ones were alternating across his thighs, and he was screaming so loud that he closed his eyes. 
The place was once again dark, and the Mistress had once again left him, �Thank you Lord� he said out loud, and he heard the echo of her laughter in the room, and he closed his eyes once more saying, �No, no, no.� But when he opened them once more, it was still dark, he tried to sleep but the fear of the Mistress returning was keeping him awake. His body was stinging with the pain that she had inflicted, it felt like millions of tiny cuts all over his body, irritated by the natural salt in the sweat. &#8216;His mind went back to Carman, but as he thought about her all that he could see was a dead baby. He turned his thoughts to Nathan, I will make him pay for this, and then he reminded himself, that it was because he got Nathan into trouble, and that he was in this hell, and that Mistress was ripping his flesh to shreds. What were they after, because he had nothing to give them? They don&#8217;t want anything, they were punishing him and they could do so for the rest of his life. The police would find him eventually; of course they wouldn&#8217;t, like him they would have no idea where he was. What a fucking mess, and it was all because of his lust for Carman.&#8217; His thoughts were interrupted by the small dim light coming on once more, and he started to tremble, thinking the Mistress was on her way back.
Nathan walked into sight and looked at Don, and then the Mistress followed closely behind him. They both walked just in front of Don, but to the side, as they stopped and turned, the mirror came alive. There were cuts all over Don, and there was filth oozing out of each one. Donna looked around at Don, and saw that his eyes were like chicken eggs, he was screaming, but there was no sound coming from his mouth. She looked back at the mirror, and although the filth had not stopped running, it slowly went to sleep again, and before their eyes turned around. Donna shivered, and Nathan put his arm over her shoulder, he held her tight and said, �Tomorrow mother wants CBT, and so too do I, it is all part of the punishment. You must always punish the things that have caused so much trouble, one more night and he will be free of his evil bonds.� Nathan looked around at Don, �Go to sleep, no more will happen tonight, get as much rest as you can, because it is not over yet. Nothing more was talked about between them, and they both walked back out the basement together.
It was late when Nathan walked into the bedroom, and Penny was still awake waiting for him. He stripped and sat on the bed, then leaning over he kissed her on the forehead, and said �Go to sleep.�
Nathan opened his eyes, and he could feel the hands of Penny oiling his back, �I have to admit, this is the way that I love being woken up, I have decided that you can just do that all day, until I get tired once more.�
It was at that moment he felt a sharp pain in his buttocks, Slap! �You have no time, the wood shed is not full, and we don&#8217;t want to freeze in the winter.�
�Well in that case, get some fly spray, because there are an awful amount of them in this room.� He could hear her laughing as she walked down to breakfast.
When Nathan sat down for his breakfast his food was already on the table, and Penny was sitting at his side. Donna walked in and said, �Nathan, as soon as I have set our guest his painful task, I will go up to the secret room, but I will come out and talk later. There is so much that I have to learn.�
�Read the book Donna Marie, your answers are there if you know where to look�
The Mistress walked down to the punishment room, and as soon as she got there she walked over to Don. He was stood in a frame still facing the mirror and his manhood was standing proud, by the look of his face he was embarrassed at the predicament he was in. �I expect you are wondering what is going to happen to you today, and I see fear in your eyes, and there is need to be in fear. It is the turn of the thing between your legs to be punished, yes it is the turn of the piece of flesh that you have been thinking of.�
Don was shaking his head, �Please I beg of you not that I will change but please leave me alone.�
�I cannot do that, there were things were broken and destroyed by you that can never be repaired, it is your destiny to be tortured. Your body is already aroused, and it will stay that way for at least another twelve hours. That aroused flesh stripped a woman of her child, and it stole the love of a woman from her man, and it gave another woman a child, but now wants no more to do with you. You say that you will change, but I know and so do you, that until the essence of evil has left your body, you will always be dangerous, but look on the bright side, this will be your last day, and tomorrow you will be free of your shackles.� The Mistress smiled and looked at Belle, �You had better bring over the props for this punishment.� Then looking at Don she asked, �Have you been fed and taken to the latrine, slave?�
Don was speechless and just nodded, and by this time there was now a pole fitted in the floor just to his front. On top of the pole was a piece of wood with a small channel and it was facing him, bell then adjusted it for height, so that it just touched the bottom of his manhood. Then she walked around Don&#8217;s back and put in position a ball gag, and then once more walked back to the front. She put a half inch wide leather strap around the base of his penis and tightened it, and then connecting it to the pole with a clip, and it was letting his penis run the length of the small channel. The Mistress looked at Don without an expression on her face, as she watched Belle feed a thin four inch electrode down the eye of his manhood. The two wires that were on the end were attached to a box, and that was attached to a battery by two more wires. Then a parachute was attached to his scrotum, and below that a metal container was hanging, then he felt the weight getting heavier as water was added to the container. A one litre drip bag, the same as you see in hospital was hung on the frame next to his face, there was a pipe that ran from the bottom to the container, and it had a small tap just below the bag. Bell then walked away, and left the Mistress standing at his side, and she looked at the set-up and stepped to his front.
�I will now tell you what is going to happen, in a moment I will turn that tap on the bag, to flow. It will drip a certain amount of water into the pipe, and that will slowly fill the container. You are now thinking that it will hurt, and you will not be able to live with the pain, and I assure you that you will feel pain, but you can put up with it, you have no choice. It can take up to eight hours to release all the water, and once it has done so your punishment for the day will be over. The electrode on your manhood will give you small pulses of electric shock, but they will be on minimum, and the shocks are intermittent and range between thirty seconds and ten minutes, they will not kill you.� The Mistress walked over and turned on the tap, then bending down she switched on the electrode box, the first pulse was instantaneous and she saw him jerk. The globules of sweat were starting to run off of his body, and she watched another pulse strike his nerves before turned and walked away. Just before she walked out of the door she turned to Belel saying, �Check on him every fifteen minutes, if after one hour he is still sweating, towel him down Belle.�
�Yes Mistress.�
The Mistress walked up the stairs and into the lounge, and then through the panel to the secret room. She walked over to the desk and sat down, and putting her fingers on the marker, she opened the book and started to read once more.
�It has been a month since Leonard, but last night the agents brought me another wretched soul, she two had been smitten by the devil and his evil ways. As the agents left of their own accord, I stared into the face of a beautiful nun. Sister Clair looked back at me through those emerald eyes sparkling with evil. She showed her teeth and moved her head forward as if to bite my face, I never flinched for to show fear or alarm is to lose the battle. She was growling like a dog, and this once beautiful face was now twisted to that of a gargoyle. I will get my assistant to put on her muzzle, and she will be stripped of her habit and laid bare in the face of her tormenter. She stopped growling and gave a piercing scream; the echo was horrific as if she was waking the dead. I told her in no uncertain words, that her master the devil will soon be screaming that same tune for the loss of her soul. Then as I turned and was about to walk out of the room, I saw him standing there, his toy in his hand and thumb in mouth. There was no fear in his eyes, just that beautiful smile on his face looking back at me, as I got close he put his hand in the air, so I took his hand and together we walked back to our room.�
There was another break in the page, and then the story started to unfold once again. �I went down this morning, and Sister Clair was stripped and ready for the ritual. Yes that is correct, as this is not a punishment but a ritual, a ritual to clean the soul and bring the morality back into her body. I was right when I said she was beautiful, her face is of soft texture, and those emerald eyes with the long lashes. I walk around her body, and as I do I move the long hair with the natural curl out of the way, her body is without blemish, and I understand why the devil needs her soul. But as I walk back to her front and look her in the eyes I show no emotion, her beauty is wasted on me, as is the look of hate. I watch as she urinates on the floor, and she laughs like the banshee, more a wail than a laugh, but I have seen this all before, it is a show of spirit and defiance. I have seen this in Nuns before, but she like others before her will only last the two nights of withdrawal, these are the easy ones, and their venom of evil will run like rivers from her body.�
�I hear the door behind open and I feel his presence, I turn and without a word he sits down on the seat and watches in silence, I hear the Nun scream, but Timothy is made of stronger stuff. He smiles at me with his eyes and plays with his toy, and the Nun is quiet once more, and now knows that her wailing is of no use, against a child with all the knowledge. I smile at him and he nods his head, it is to say I am ok and do your work, so much intelligence for a boy of four. I turn once again to my task in hand, and walk over to the wall, and once again I take the whip down and walk back to my mark. I throw the whip forward, and her eyes show fear, then I hear her whimper and see the sadness in her eyes, I can feel no emotion, it is her time. Snap, the whip caresses her breast, and her head springs up like a jack in the box, her mouth utters no sound, because the devil protects his own. Snap, I strike her other breast and she laughs out loud, with a mocking look on her face. She is daring me to hurt her, but that is not what I am about, I am paving the way for life&#8217;s mirror to do its work. Snap, on the belly I strike, and her face is contorted with shock, but still I see the contempt she is showing me. Her fear is no more, because she has tasted the whip and she feels no pain, �Hit me you whore,� she has shouted, and it was in a deep voice and lower than a man. It is the voice of the devil, he daring me to lose my temper, and destroy her so that she spirals in death to the depth of hell. Still with no emotion I continue her pain, snap, snap, snap, I see the criss-cross of stripes covering her body, but as with Leonard, there are no cuts. Four more I give her on her thighs, and still there is no noise from her mouth, but they all cry in the end, and again I will show them my compassion. I walk to the wall and replace the whip, and on the way out I stop at her side and looking into those fiery eyes, but see not an ounce of goodness. I walk over to Timothy that slips off the chair, he is waiting with his hand in the air, and I take the hand of my silent witness and walk to out lunch. From beginning to end not a word do I speak, it would be a pointless task, as like the animal they have become, they cannot understand.�
The Mistress closed the book and sat in her chair, she leaned back in great thought. &#8216;Nathan sat through most of her sessions, and he was privy to all that went on, he was her silent witness, but was it by choice or was by loyalty. Nathan had told her, that their mother was a very powerful woman, and she Donna was thinking back at how she looked at Nathan. She remembered feeling no hate, no pity, no emotions, and most of all no guilt for the task she carried out on his body. If mother knew this was going to happen, then why did she not warn her sooner to stop his pain? That feeling she had received when touching Nathans shoulder, the feeling of fear and the feeling of innocence, it was her gift reaching out, and she responded with compassion.&#8217; For the first time since her mother had died a tear ran down her cheek, and she quickly wiped it away, knowing that because of her tasks ahead, that it would probably be the last. After standing up she walked down the stairs, only to be met in the lounge by Nathan, �Why are you here Nathan, it is time for lunch.�
�Old habits die hard Mistress Donna, and the Mistress of Chrystal House.�
She closed the door and walked to him and kissed him on the cheek, �Go and have your food Timothy, we will talk later in the day,� he smiled and walked off.
The Mistress watched him go, and she was thinking, &#8216;mother showed him so much love, and he gave her so much back.&#8217;
It was after lunch and Nathan had walked back outside, the Mistress was in the lounge and watched as he walked over to the shed. He had his shirt off once more, and even from where she was she could see the horrendous scars that she had inflicted. She wanted to go down into the punishment room, and inflict the same scars on Don, but she knew that it was not the punishment that Nathan or her mother wanted. She had to toe the line, as her she must meet her destiny in the correct frame of mind. The Mistress walked away from the window and out the door, a few moments later she was in the punishment room, and standing in front of Don. He was crying with the pain, but there was two more hours of water left in the bag, she knew that he could take the strain, because weaker slaves than he survived. Belle had walked to her side, and the Mistress looked at Don and smiled, and then to Belle she said, �Wipe the sweat from his body, he has not got much longer to go.� Without another word she turned and walked out of the room, back up the stairs she walked into the lounge and to the window. Penny was now sitting on the bench that was near where Nathan was working, and she saw Nathan every now and again turn and smile at her. 
Belle was at her side once more, �The other girls say that Penny is not pulling her weight with the work Mistress, are you going to talk with her.�
The Mistress smiled and looked around at Belle, �Tell the girls not to worry about Penny, I doubt very much if Nathan will let her work again. She is with her man, and that is the way that it should be. Soon Belle there will be only you and me in the punishment room, the girls will all be looking after the upstairs, but that will be later, and this conversation was meant for your ears only. Do you understand Belle?�
�Yes Mistress, you know that I would never let you down, I owe you far too much.�
�Loyalty is all I need Belle, and I think you had better go and check on our guest.�
Belle walked off and the Mistress went to the secret door, a few moments later she was sitting down at the desk opening the book.
�I walked back into the punishment room and my assistant had turned Sister Clair around. She knew that I was there and she shouted, �So you are back bitch, my Master knows what you are trying to do, but you will never defeat him.� Then she wailed like the banshee once more, and then laughed. I said nothing, all that needed to be said had been said, as her peers had done the necessary prayers before she was brought in front of me. There is only one time that I will speak to her, and that could be two days away. I walk to the wall and take down my tool, and then walk back to my line, again she laughs like a hyena, and it is telling me that she is not mad but possessed. I throw the whip out in front of me, and I notice that she is sticking her rear out to tempt me, but my mind is stronger than that. Snap, the strike catches her in the small of the back, and I can hear her hissing like a snake. Snap, I have just struck her left buttock, and that is where I always start. Snap, then the right, and she now screaming, and I know that it is not in pain for she is seeking sympathy, but I have none to give as my mind is closed. Several more time she feels the kiss of the whip, and she is silent once again, but she has not weakened as I can still sense the fighting spirit in her. My trade allows me to sense real fear and respond to it, I sense their guilt or their innocence, their remorse or their mocking. I walk over to the wall and hang my tool back up, and once again I leave the punishment room as silently as I arrived.�
Once again there was a short gap as if she had been resting.
�At midnight I walked down the stairs and into the punishment room, Sister Clair looked at me and laughed, once again my assistant had turned her around. I looked back at her and then closed the door, and in the dim light of the single 20 watt bulb I walked over to her. It was then that I saw the door open, and my silent witness walked in, and with his bear in one hand, and again his thumb in his mouth. I smiled at his innocent face, and put my hand out for him to take hold of, and he ran to me, together for the next hour we waited and watched the evil filth slip from her body until it dried up. While this was taking place Sister Clair was screaming, but now she was silent, and it was when I turned to look at her I saw the danger. Her eyes were looking at Timothy, and when I walked close and looked deep, I saw the eyes of the Beast. I knew this day would come, the day when I would have to send my little boy away for his own safety, it was in the scriptures that the priests showed me, pages of time yet to come, it also told of my nearing demise, but I am not afraid of death, to me it holds no secrets.�
There was another space in the book, and then it started talking about the following morning. 
�I sent my baby away this morning with his father Nathan, his father tried to keep a brave face, but when he kissed me goodbye, I felt his tears mingle with mine. The priests would be sending him money to look after Timothy, and it would be another fifteen years before Timothy would return to Chrystal House, where he would live with the Mistress once more. He could not understand why he was being sent away, and his name would now be Nathan. But the Devils agents would be looking for him, his secrets must be kept safe, he is the Key Master and opens all the doors that the Mistress needs. He alone can make the mirror work, without him there can be no Mistress of Chrystal house. While reading this journal Donna Marie, you are probably thinking that it is Sister Clair&#8217;s fault, but it is not, it is fate, the Devil knew that I was dying and you were too young. If it had not been Sister Clair it would have been someone else, I can feel no bitterness as there is no room for hate in my life. I know to by the coming of this time, I have only a few days left on earth, but Benjamin will look after the new Mistresses affairs while she is at school. He too has not much longer to live, and like me he will never see the new Mistress of Crystal House again.�
Once more there was a gap, and again more writing.
�I have just been to the punishment room and looked into Sister Clair&#8217;s eyes, she was once more herself, but after what has just taken place, I knew this would be so. I released her and gave her food, and the agents have taken her back to the Charter House. Before she left I asked her for forgiveness, she blessed me and asked, �Can you ever forgive me Chrystal, Donna Marie?� I took hold of her hand and kissed her ring, saying, there was nothing for me to forgive her for, and once again she blessed me and crossed herself before walking out.�
The Mistress looked at the book but the pages were empty. She sat there for a very long time, and then closed the book for the last time. Down the stairs she walked, and through the secret door. Nathan was there waiting, and she walked across to him where he put his arms around her, while she cried on his shoulder.









CHAPTER EIGHT

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Mistress went down into the punishment room, and walked over to where Don was crying. The bag was empty baring a few drops and the Mistress, bent down and turned off the electrode. �Belle clear away the CBT tools, and feed him, put him back in the frame, and he will be freed tomorrow.� She walked up the stairs and found Nathan coming out of the shower room. It had been the first time she had seen him since she walked away outside the lounge. �Why were you down the lounge when I walked out Timothy, and I call you that because it is your name?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Mother spoke to me while I was cutting the wood, she told me that you needed comforting, and I knew that you now know it all.�
�Do you know who you are Timothy?�
�Yes, I am the Key Master and I hold the keys to all the doors, and without me they will never work. I open doors that you cannot see, but they are there all the same, without me the doors to hell would never be opened, and your work would be wasted. There are doors that I have not shown you yet, and they are never in the same place twice, they move like time, invisible to the naked eye, it is so the Devils agents cannot find them.�
�Why can&#8217;t the Devils agents touch you now, Timothy?�
�It is because I have been blessed in church. When my father died a large sum of money was placed in my bank, the funeral was paid for by the Charter House, but I didn&#8217;t know it then. It was at the end of the sermon when the priest blessed the coffin my father was in, then he walked over to me and blessed me, and his words at the end were protect Timothy from the Devils Agents, and he drew a cross on my forehead with holy water. It stirred memories but I had soon forgotten once more.�
�Where is my father buried Timothy because there is no record?�
�He is at the Charter House alongside my father, and I will take you there one day when you have more time.� Nathan was now sitting on the edge of the bed, and as he lay down waiting for Penny to begin her oiling, and the Mistress was walking to the door he said, �Donna Marie, there is no need to go to see Don this evening, he will be clean in the morning, and ready for home in the evening. There will also be one to bring back, but we will talk about that tomorrow.� As the Mistress watched Penny started her ministrations, and after she looked up at the Mistress and smiled. The Mistress said her good night&#8217;s and walked out.
That evening Don had just fallen asleep when he felt that familiar sharp stinging sensation, snap as the whip struck his genitals. He felt nausea and his body dropped and his wrist bonds were holding his weight, and then he blinked his eyes to see the dim glowing light that was coming from nowhere and everywhere at the same time. In front of him was the Mistress with the whip coiled in her hands, there was no expression on her face. His nausea had subsided and he put weight onto his feet once more, her eyes were staring at him and he feared her. Once again she threw out the whip, and Don closed his eyes in anticipation of the searing pain to come. Snap, �Open your eyes you miserable wretch, to be clean tonight you must face yourself, and see yourself as you are, and see yourself as you could be.� Snap, another stroke struck him across his breast, and his eyes sprang open. �Look in the mirror and see what you are now, as the evil flows from your body,� he was only glancing from the corner of his eyes, �Look I will tell you no more,� she shouted, �Now tell me what you see.�
Don looked straight at the mirror and watched in horror as the evil flowed out of his body, like puss from a boil. �I see myself with slime running from my cuts that you have put on my body, and my face is a deathly white, and there are no eyes only the sockets Mistress. His head had dropped and was now looking at the floor, and there were tears running from his eyes. I know I have done evil things and I am sorry, I have killed a baby and I am sorry, but I cannot replace it. I am so ashamed of myself is there no peace from the guilt I feel.�
�Your guilt is true and so too is your remorse, and you have seen what you will become if you revert back to your ways. There is one that you lusted for and it is she that will repair you, seek her out and fall at her feet, and seek forgiveness. Now look at the mirror and see how you are at present.� 
�I am afraid, Mistress.�
�Do as I say.�
Don lifted his head slowly and looked at the mirror, he was normal once more, but he felt different.� Throughout your life the mirror will be your witness, the evil has drained from your soul, so don&#8217;t let it return because the mirror is the widow to your soul.� The Mistress walked up to him and he flinched, but she put her cool hand on his shoulder saying, �Relax, you torment is over,� and he felt his bonds being loosened by her, �Now unshackle your feet and walk to the table and sleep.� Don did as he was told and walked over to the leather table and lay down, and as soon as his head touched the table his eyes were closing. The lights went out and he was alone and asleep, and once again the mirror turned back to the panel. 
The Mistress walked into her sitting room, and Belle turned on the CCTV, �Mistress, look he has escaped, now what are we going to do?�
The Mistress looked at the screen and smiled, �Take him a breakfast and a drink Belle, because we don&#8217;t want him to starve, and make sure he goes to the toilet, and I will be down with Nathan shortly.�
�Is it safe Mistress?�
�Perfectly, so just do as I say, because he will not touch you.�
It was after breakfast when the Mistress walked down the stairs into the punishment room, she walked over to where Don was sitting, and he immediately began to shake. �You have no reason to fear me Don, because your punishment is at an end, you know what life is all about. I expect Nathan will be down to see you before you go, and he will be informing you of how you will return.� Then she turned and walked back out of the punishment room.
When the Mistress walked into the lounge, she walked over to the window and looked outside. Belle had walked to her side; they looked out at Nathan sitting on the tractor and trailer, he was driving out towards the wood for more wood, sitting behind him on the rear seat was Penny with her arms wrapped around his body. Donna smiled, �They really are good for each other Belle.�
�Yes Mistress, she follows him around like a little puppy, she is always by his side.�
The Mistress looked at Belle and said, �We will have to talk soon as there will be a lot of changes around the house.�
It was an hour later when the Mistress heard the tractor return, and she looked out of the window. She saw Penny get off and then Nathan, and after they had spoken to each other, she leaned forward and kissed him on the lips. The Mistress and Belle watched as Penny walked off towards the house, and as she walked away Nathan was smiling as he unloaded the wood.
It was twenty minutes later when the Mistress and Penny walked out with his cold drink, he had finished unloading and walking back from putting the tractor away. A few seconds later Penny offered him the drink, �The shed is almost full, and another couple of days should do it. It might be best if I come in and talk to Don before he goes home, I have to put him in the right frame of mind.�
�This one that has to be picked up, we have no idea where she is or how to find her.�
�There is no need to worry about where her whereabouts are, because she will be brought to you at the stroke of midnight, there is no escape for this treacherous bitch. She with her conniving ways is worse than Don ever could be, and she is strong, much stronger than her partner in crime. However it is not her fault, she is possessed and has never been in control of her life for many weeks. It is not evil inside her but the Devil, he has come to test you, to see if you are up for the challenge, mother will be watching, but you will be on your own. Belle must be told of your new vocation, not that you are a white witch, but that you now do the work of the Charter House.�
�What makes you so sure that Belle will keep this secret, Timothy?�
Nathan smiled back at her, and the answer shocked the Mistress, �Belle will do all you say, because she is a transvestite him/she and your lover and slave, she will also be the father of the next Mistress of Chrystal house.�
The Mistress looked at Penny that was looking back and smiling, �But what about Penny, she has heard this whole conversation.�
�Do not worry about Penny, she will be blessed and so will Belle, it has to be to keep them safe. They will both be blessed tonight by the agents of the Charter House at midnight, and you have the rest of the day to explain to Belle. Penny has to be blessed because she will soon be my wife, and over in the woods there is another dwelling, and it has been looked after by the Charter house, it will be there that I make my home. Through the sessions with the girl I will always be with you. One other point I would like to make, you must at some point today go to the secret room and bring down the picture of our parents, then it can be hung in its rightful place in the lounge.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was going to ask why he could not do it, but looking at his face, she knew that there was an ulterior motive. �I will go and see to what you have told me now Timothy, sooner is better than later. Tell me Timothy, I can only presume that Mother has told you all this that is about to happen, but why the girl?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Nathan was still looking at her when he smiled and answered, �Once the pages of time have been written, they cannot be changed.� Nathan was as mysterious as their mother&#8217;s work was, but he seemed to know what he was talking about.&nbsp; Then without saying anymore on the subject she walked away with Penny at her side.
It was over an hour later, and long after she had spoken to Belle, that the Mistress went to the secret room. The room was now spotless and all the dust had been swept away, even the glass in the ceiling was clean once more. After stepping over to the desk, that she noticed a new journal on the desk, with nervous hands she opened the clasp and pulled open the cover. On the first page was written in beautiful writing, Testimony to the work of Donna Marie Chrystal, for the St David&#8217;s Charter House. The pages were blank and she closed the book and sealing the clasp, and after she had picked up the picture, she walked back out and down to the lounge. She closed the door to the secret room, and after hanging the picture up where a fixture was already sitting, she walked up to her rooms. Belle was there waiting with her meal, �Bell I want no one to enter the lounge any more, not unless I am with them, that must also include you Belle, but with the exception of Nathan.� 
 �I understand Mistress.�
The evening meal had been eaten and Nathan and the Mistress walked down to the punishment room. Don was sitting in the same place that he had been all day, and he had been given food before he was to be taken home. When he saw Nathan he stood up and tried to back off, but Nathan said, �You have no reason to fear me, your punishment is over Don, and from now on you can only punish yourself.�
�I have ruined a lot of lives and I will have to go away, I cannot stay in my home town now. I know that it is not very much considering, but I am so very sorry about all that has happened. There is so much blood on my hands now, and I feel so dirty.�
�I am sending you back to your home town, and Carman will look after you, and she knows of your coming, she has already been informed. You will both have to start again, as you are both to partly to blame for all that has happened, but considering all the facts that I know, the pages of time had only one way to travel.�
�I understand now, what you were telling me when I first came here, and what you were talking about, but I have to ask. When I look into the mirror from now on, what will I see?� Nathan could see that he was shaking.
�You will only see what you are now, what you were before you came here was destroyed and taken away by the mirror of your soul. Only you have the power of making sure it never returns.� Then Nathan put his hand out and said �Goodbye Don,� and as he returned the hand shake, he felt the jab in the arm.
When the girls had carried him to the car and he was on his way, the Mistress asked Nathan, �Who told Carman about Don.�
�The Charter House saw to his needs, Carman has been given enough money by them, and with the joint card she had with me, they will live comfortably while they find their feet. You still don&#8217;t understand do you Donna Marie, this was all planed long before either of us was born, and we are just carrying on with what is written in the pages of time. Don Masters was part of the plan, so was Carman&#8217;s friend, and so too was Penny. Penny knew about me long before I arrived, mother had been speaking to her and explaining her role. I have told you once before, that once the pages have been written they can never be changed. You must always have me in the room when you carry out your tasks, you cannot do them without me being present; do you understand Donna Marie?�
�Yes Timothy and I would not wish it to be any other way.�&nbsp; 
�One other thing, have you told Belle of her new task, because the girls cannot go to the punishment room from now on. As you know the punishment room is sound proof, and there is no reason to worry about your guests. I have taken you and shown you all that happens with the mirror, but until you are of age in four days time, it is dangerous for you to be down the basement alone; and even then I must be with you.� Then Nathan looked at her as if he was expecting an answer.
�I promise that I will not go down there alone Nathan.�
�Belle pulled up at the door and woke Don up, �Wake up sleepy head.�
He opened his eyes and looked about, and then he began to tremble a little, �I can&#8217;t do it.�
�It will be alright Don, I will come up to the door with you, and she is expecting you.� The two of them walked up to the door, and as Belle was about to knock, the door opened. 
Carman was looking back at them, Don stuttered, �Carman I am sorry, I... I.�
�Walk through to the lounge Don we have a lot to talk about,� she stepped back and he walked in, looking at Belle she asked, �How is Nathan.�
�He is fine, and his scars are almost gone, you have no need to worry about him anymore, he is being well looked after.�
�Please give him my regards and tell him sorry.�
Belle smiled, �You had better get it right this time around,� then she turned and walked back to the car, in the car she saw Carman close the door.
Back at the house once more and three hours later, Belle and Penny were up in the lounge, and both were wondering what was going to happen. The door opened and a priest walked in, and he was wearing his full regalia, there was another priest behind him and one carrying a cross, and the first ones badge of office showed that he was a cardinal. For five minutes he spoke to them in Latin, and then after painting a cross on their foreheads in holy water, he prayed a little longer. Then he crossed himself and walked out of the room, Nathan then walked in saying, �You may go to your rooms now, I will be a little while Penny, do not wait up.� As she followed Belle out of the room, she kissed him on the cheek.
Nathan looked at the Mistress and said, �You have a charge to meet, the hour is almost here.� The two of them walked down to the punishment room and he locked the door behind them, the Mistress was about to ask how the girl would be brought through a locked door and stopped? Then she remembered that he was the Key Master. There was no clocks to look at and she was also wondering how they would know when the agents were about to arrive. Then without warning Nathan walked over to the opposite wall, and with his outstretched hand he pulled back an imaginary curtain, and an open doorway appeared in the wall. Seconds later three people walked through, two priests with their heads facing the ground, and between them was the girl. They walked her over to the cross, and after they placed her back against it, they fastened her bonds, nothing was said and the Mistress at no time saw the priest&#8217;s faces, they turned and walked out of the room the same way as they came in. On the way out they did a curious thing, the Mistress watched as each priest placed something in Nathans hand as they walked past. Once they were inside the wall Nathan dropped his hand as if he was releasing the curtain, and the doorway disappeared.
It was Nathan that moved first, and he walked over and stood in front of the girl, he looked into her eyes and said, �Yes it is me and I am back, I am also far stronger now than I was when I left, you have no right to be here, and with my help the Mistress will send you back to the depth of hell. Remember this, I am here to stay and I hold the keys to all the locks, and there is only one door open for you, and it is the way back to hell.� Nathan pointed to the wall panelling, and the Mistress watched in amazement as the mirror turned to face them. He then stepped aside so that the Mistress could see her. 
The Mistress walked up close and looked into the girl&#8217;s eyes, and she could see another pair of eyes looking back at her, but they were not the girl&#8217;s. These eyes were in the eyes and they were evil, it startled her but she never showed it, her expression never changed, she knew when she came into the room to expect the unexpected. The girl was looking back at her with a sly expression on her face, and there was also a smile, but not an ordinary smile but a sinister smile. The type of smile that says, I know something you don&#8217;t know smile, and the Mistress instinctively knew this was a silent one. She was close to the girl, but not too close that she was in any danger, and she could feel hands holding her shoulders, and then the girl screamed, and it was so sudden that she nearly went back, but the hands were holding her firm. Then the girl laughed out loud and spit at the Mistresses face, but she saw the tell tale signs well in advance and stepped aside. Then she stepped back a few paces watching the girl at all times, and turned to walk towards the door that Nathan had open.
Up the stairs they walked, and the Mistress said �Come to my rooms Nathan, we must talk.� In the room she pointed to a chair and told him to sit. Belle asked if she should leave, but Nathan told her to stay where she was. �Mother could go there on her own Timothy, why is it I cannot?�
�It was something that never occurred before, our mother had you but because of her illness you only had the powers of the Mistress, she had to have another child to open the doors. It is me that has the white witch magic, and it is you that has the power to send the evil away and back to hell. Did you feel mother&#8217;s hands on your shoulders, Donna Marie, because she was standing right behind you when the girl screamed, and I could see her just like I can see you now? She knew what was about to take place, and she did not want the evil to see the initial fright. They will do that on many occasions, and I am sorry that I never warned you, but it is done as a test, and by not moving you showed the evil one, that you were ready for combat. Tomorrow it will be different, she will be docile once more, but don&#8217;t be fooled by her cries because she is a faker. She shows all the signs of a silent one, but she is a faker all the same. Cry&#8217;s of mercy on each stroke of the whip, but at the end she will laugh in your face. I will tell you now Donna Marie, that it will be you that will be sweating before the evil has flowed from her soul.�
�Why are you telling me all this Timothy?�
�It is because I have half the powers, if you had inherited them all you would know all this yourself.�
�That is why mother had written in the book, and that without you there would be no Mistress of Crystal House. It is also for that reason why you were sent away, because you were more important than me.�
�In a way yes, but for the only reason I could do both your work and the Magic, but I could never reproduce another Mistress of Crystal House. Now you understand the reason why you can never go down there alone, it is getting late.� 
�Belle, tomorrow when you go to the punishment room, you must go alone. You cannot be harmed by her, because of the blessings this evening, so there is no time that you should be afraid. You will go behind her and you must rip the clothes from her back, you must never take any sharp instrument down with you. It will be a hard task but you will have it completed before the Mistress gets there. Under no circumstances must you try to unshackle her, put cotton wool in your ears to hide her pleas. I will be going down there with you, to be doubly sure, because the Mistress will never have another charge as dangerous as this one. I will take my leave and see you at the top of the punishment room stairs at eight, and good night to you both,� and he went to walk out of the room. 
The Mistress asked �What did the agents give you Timothy.�
�Oh yes, I nearly forgotten, you had better put these with the rest.� And he walked over with his hand outstretched, and her hand was ready to receive, and he dropped two sovereigns into her open palm. �Good night Donna Marie Chrystal.�
�Good night Timothy, but how did you know my full name?
�I know all the secrets Donna Marie,� and he smiled.
Back at his room he stripped off his clothes, and then while standing next to Penny&#8217;s bed, he bent down and kissed her on the cheek, she opened her eyes for a fleeting moment, then after smiling up at him they once again closed.










CHAPTER NINE

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The morning came and Nathan was at the top of the stairs waiting, Belle was a there a few moments later. He walked down first with Belle following, and then into to punishment room, without stopping he walked directly over to Jill Cooper. She lifted her head and he could see the wild, mad eyes, but he could also see the eyes inside the eyes. She gave out a hideous laugh and then screamed at the top of her voice, �Strip her, she cannot harm you, this is just show and an act to make you fear her. I see you are still hiding behind the girl you evil filth, but soon you will leave once more, back to the entrails of hell.� Once again she screamed, and it was piercing, and so much that Bella screwed up her face. �Cease making that noise you faker, because there will be no pity here for you, and there will be no mercy until you are clean.� He looked at Belle and could see the fear in her eyes, but she had no need to be, because the evil beast inside the girl was focused on him. Belle had finished and was collecting the clothes, she wrapped them up in the skirt, and Nathan pointed to the door, Belle scurried out as if her life depended on it. �You are still looking at me evil one, but it will not be for long, it is I that holds the power now, you had your chance many years ago, but you failed. The Mistress was too powerful for you, and she sent you running back to your domain, and even now, I see your evil eyes, but I never feared them then, and I do not fear them now.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The girls face contorted and words came from her mouth, but Nathan knew from knowing the girl that it was not her voice, it was the voice of the beast. �You will never defeat me boy, I am the most powerful and you may hold the key, but you don&#8217;t hold the whip. She has yet to come and show me her worth, but it will be her crying before I yield to the mirror. It has been fifteen years and I am stronger, you are just a mere boy, you have no experience and before I go, you will fall at my feet and pray for me to take your soul.�
�My soul is not for sale, and neither is the soul of the Mistress, you have not felt her power, but it is immense.�
�My agents saw you being whipped by the Mistress, but you were not harmed, her whip cannot harm me, I am the power.�
�You are wrong evil one, they might have seen me being whipped, but did they see the Mistress&#8217;s soul holding the Mistress&#8217;s arm to dull the strike. I will never fear you or the whip, but you should fear the Mistress. Now silence you filth from hell, the Mistress is about to enter the room, show your respect.�
The voice of his mother was in his mind once more. �You have done well timothy and you speak with no fear, you must help your sister because her test is of the hardest. The Devil has risen just to see for himself, but he will be no match for my child and his sister.�
�Yes Mistress I hear you.�
The Mistress walked through the door, and she walked past Nathan not saying a word. She walked over to the girl and looked into her eyes, and the spirit of evil could be seen still showing his face. She walked over to the wall, leaving the girl to watch her every move, and as she was about to take down the whip, she noticed that it was now older, and had seen much use. She turned and looked at Nathan that was now sitting on a chair next to the wall, he looked back, as if knowing her thoughts, and he nodded his head. She lifted the whip from the wall, and walked back, and it was at this point she noticed the indent in the floor; it had been made over a long time by all the Mistresses of Chrystal House. She threw the whip out in front of her body and looked at the girl, her breasts were large and hanging, she was looking back at the Mistress with a twisted smile on her lip, then without warning she urinated. As she was doing this she laughed, in a soprano key; that was as ear piercing as a scream. The Mistress was unmoved, because she had expected some sort of reaction, her face showed no emotion, as she drew back the whip, and with the speed of light it was kissing the girl&#8217;s flesh. Snap! It struck her right breast, and the girl&#8217;s reaction was spontaneous, a deep voice flowed from her mouth with an unearthly crackle. �You filthy whore, is that the best you can do? I felt no pain and your effort was useless.� The whip hand was pulled back once more, and again the whip was sent forward with the same power. Snap! Her left breast shook as the tip of the whip caressed the skin at speed. �Ha, you whore of a whore, your power is nothing like that of your whore of a mother,� said the same unearthly voice. The Mistress knew that the beast was challenging her, but she had no need to take up the challenge, because she was in the driving seat. Still with no expression on her face, she pulled back the whip, and sent it flying in the direction of the girl, and this time striking her on the belly. Snap! The girl gave out an unearthly scream, but again the Mistress was unmoved, Nathan had told her she was a faker. Pulling back the whip once more, the Mistress sent the whip flowing forward to land on the groin area just above her sex. Snap! It was at this point that the Mistress realised that she had never been this accurate with a whip, and it was as if she was not aiming but thinking where the whip should strike. The girl hung her head and was now crying, the tears could clearly be seen, but again the Mistress sent two more strokes down to strike her on each thigh. The girl stopped crying and looked at the Mistress, and once again the voice spoke, �You call that a whipping, you never hurt me you filthy whore, I feel no pain, and you are of no use. I will be here for a long time to come, and you will fall at my feet you filth, get down now and lick my piss.� The Mistress still with no expression on her face; slowly walked over to the wall and replaced the whip. From where Nathan had been sitting he could see that there were no cuts, but the red mark of the whips bite was present. Then as the Mistress walked out of the door, Nathan pointed at the wooden panel and watched the mirror appear, then without saying a word he followed the Mistress out. At the top of the stairs Nathan was just in time to see the Mistress walk into the lounge. Nathan turned and touched the lock on the door, and he heard the familiar sound of the locks movement. He knew where she was going, the journal had to be written, he went into the kitchen were Penny had been waiting. The others looked as he walked into the room and sat down, and there was still silence as Penny brought him his coffee.
It was an hour later when Nathan left Penny in the kitchen, he walked through to the hall and then into the lounge. He walked over to one of the arm chairs that was facing the secret door and waited. It was not long before the Mistress walked back into the lounge, and as she did so she saw Nathan, and after closing the door she walked over and sat opposite.
�Mother must be proud of you Donna Marie, and I sat in awe as you carried out your work with the expertise that mother had. At no time were you put off by the ramblings of the beast, it is something that you should expect from now on. Neither were you swayed by her faking, this one is going to be hard Donna Marie, but between us we will strip the evil from her.�
�Tell me something Timothy, is that the voice of the Devil, not that it really makes a difference, but I just wondered if mother ever said.�
�I very much doubt it, but he would be a very high up minion, to be trusted with the task of defeating the Mistress, I think it would be his right hand man. In the time I saw mother fight the fight, there were many voices, but to be fair there is only one per soul. It is early days, and the beast has not started to fight back yet, that poor girl is going to go through hell and back, and I just hope that she recovers.�
�You sound as if you are sorry for her, and it was she that executed the breakup of your marriage to Carman.�
�You are not thinking straight Donna Marie, she is the victim and not me, this was all engineered to force my cover, and it worked. The evil was expecting you to destroy my body and soul, while Carman destroyed my mind, but they never took in account, that a Mistress of Chrystal House is earthbound until her replacement takes over. You have to become of age before that takes place, and that is why it is so important for you to win this fight. This sort of contest has never taken place before, you are doing the work of the Mistress before you have your power and blessed by the priests. That is why it is important for me to always be with you in these early days, and you must never answer the voice on any occasion, it is me that it is talking to. I have also locked the door to the punishment room at the top of the stairs, there must be no mistakes.�
�Where did you find the Key?� it was then she realised what she had asked and added �Forget that stupid question.�
�She is looking at the mirror, but at this time I doubt that anything is going on, there will be many sessions before the evil starts to flow out of her. The evil is only as strong as the body that holds it captive, the manifestation enclosed in her body is giving her strength, but that only has so much. We must go down twice more today, and then she must be put in the frame, and it might be best that I give Belle a hand. This morning she was showing fear and she must not do that, you must talk to her and tell her that she can never be harmed by either the evil or your charge. Now I believe that it is time for lunch, and we can go back down directly it is finished, but it is your Domain and I leave it to you Donna Marie.�
�Until I am sure of my steps Timothy, I will follow your lead.�
After lunch the Mistress was at the top of the stairs as Nathan walked out of the kitchen. She watched as he walked over to the door and put his hand on the lock, and she heard the tumblers falling. He then opened the door and walked down the stairs, the Mistress followed. 
Downstairs the Mistress walked up to the girl, and the girl flicked her head in the air, �Well if it isn&#8217;t the whores Mistress, back from swimming in her own disgusting filth, and you dare to look at me. I am the Master kiss my feet you whore, common slut of a thousand brothels.�
Nathan walked over between the Mistress and the girl �Silence you lowest of the low, your time on the surface is almost at an end, and it will be you begging the Mistress to let you go. Cease this useless time wasting banter, you will never gain strength at the hands of the Mistress. Her time is valuable so release the girl&#8217;s soul, or be sent back to the burning fires of hell in disgrace.�
The Mistress watched as he stepped back over to the wall and sat down, then she walked over to the wall and took down the whip, but it was only on the way back that she noticed that the mirror was once again hidden. She once more stood on her mark and threw the whip out, and again the girl laughed at the sight of her doing this. The hand was pulled back once more, and with a flick there was the sound of leather and flesh meeting. Snap! The girl gave out a blood curdling scream, and it echoed around the room bouncing off the walls. Snap! Another struck almost at the same time the scream ended; the Mistress was giving her no time to recover, and before her scream stopped. Snap, the Mistress was striking all the soft parts of the body, and now it was the turn of the armpits. Snap! There were no more screams, but her crying could be heard, but when the Mistress looked there were no tears to be seen. Snap! The whip was coiling around the arms at the soft biceps, and on releasing its grip; there was a ring of pain left remaining. Snap! The arms were getting punished and the Mistress was working her way down the arm. Snap! The strokes were now on the other arm, and for a while this was where she concentrated her strokes. Snap! Snap! There were two in quick succession one on each breast, and the girl laughed out loud as they bit into the tissue. The Mistress could see that the top part of her body was red raw, as she had continually whipped the same places for over an hour. She pulled back the whip and coiled it up, and then she walked over to the wall, after replacing the whip, the Mistress walked out of the room. As she walked past Nathan, he could see the sweat running down her face, and the blouse that she was wearing was sticking to her body. Nathan stood up and pointed at the mirror once more, and it was still turning into position when he walked out of the room. As he was about to close the door to the punishment room, he heard the painful wailing sound, and knew that the mirror was showing the girl her soul, and striping the evil from her body, Nathan crossed himself and pulled the door too.
Once again in the Hall he saw the Mistress walk to the lounge, her testimony had to be written. He knew that she was learning fast, she now had to be a stronger Mistress than she was with the House of correction. Nathan also knew by the wailing in the punishment room, that all her effort down stairs was paying off. He looked at the clock on the wall and walked outside, and he made his way to the shed and the tractor at the back of the house. The shed was now full to the brim, and he went straight past and over to the tractor, he started it up and drove around to the front. In front of him on the corner he saw her, waiting as he knew she would be, Nathan stopped and Penny slipped on the seat behind him, they rode towards the wood in the distance, with Penny hugging him with her arms.
The Mistress walked out of the lounge, and down the hall, and at the door to the punishment room she tried the door, but as she knew it would be it was locked. She went up to her rooms where Belle was sitting waiting, and looked up as she walked in. �Belle, Nathan has told me that you were showing fear this morning, during stripping the girl. I know it is hard but you must never do that, it is showing the evil that it has power, and it also unintentionally undermines what I have been doing. Evil feeds on fear, and until you feel that you are in control of your feelings, he will always be with you down there. You have been blessed by the highest order in the land, and you have nothing to fear when doing your task. When you are on your own, neither is it right to get into conversation with my charge, because that is another thing evil feeds on, negative speech and argument. Belle you are more to me than a slave, and you must know that I would never put you in a position where you would be hurt.
It was later in the afternoon, when the Mistress was in the lounge looking through the window; she saw Nathan and Penny coming across the meadow to the side of the house. But what was even more surprising was they were in a horse drawn open carriage, and there was an old monk at the reins. The Mistress walked outside as the carriage pulled up at the entrance, and Nathan jumped out, he stood with the door opened waiting for the Mistress to enter. Once she had sat down, Nathan got back in �Once around the estate Theodore, just like when Mistress Chrystal was here.� 
He turned around and with a tear in his eye answered, �That was a long time ago Master Timothy. I had some good times taking the Mistress and yourself on the picnics.�
�The Mistress is in the house once more Theodore and your services will be needed once again, and these are happy times once again.� 
It was over an hour before the carriage brought them back to the house, the whole of the staff were waiting by the door when they returned. They all got out and Nathan said, �I will pick the tractor up in the morning Theodore, the exercise will do me good.� As the carriage went away, Nathan said �I will see you in a moment Penny at evening meal; I have things to talk about with the Mistress.� She kissed him on the cheek and smiled as she led the other staff inside. The Mistress and Nathan walked in behind and went into the lounge.
Once they were both seated, the Mistress said, �I have spoken with Belle and corrected the problem, and hopefully she will be better prepared for the evil.�
�She will be fine Donna Marie, and things do not happen overnight. You are winning the fight and the mirror is doing its task. You have read about Sister Clair, but mother was lucky, once the evil knew that I was no longer in the house, it dispossessed her. That too was engineered to serve a purpose, as it was done to weaken the hold the Charter House had on the door to hell. The evil had no idea that mother was only days away from dying, and you were out in Switzerland at a finishing school, and you would remain there for the next twelve years. It was a mistake by the beast, because the beast in its rush to defeat the Mistress, had split the two powers that would come back to haunt him.�
�Tell me something Timothy, what will happen if one of us dies.�
�Do not fear the future Donna Marie, there is a long time before that takes place, and our soul mates will have already been buried in the Charter House. You have nothing to fear and have a long life ahead of you Donna Marie, and you and I will die within days of each other, but by then there will be a new Mistress of Chrystal House and she will have all the powers. You are wondering how I know all this, but mother told me, and it is all coming back to me little by little. Our mother was a very clever person, and she defeated the evil in more ways than one the day she sent me away. You must also remember that I inherited all her powers to see into the future, and life and death hold no secrets from me. I think it is time we had our meal Donna Marie, you cannot work on an empty belly.�
Just as they were about to stand up, they both heard the Mistress say. �I could always trust you Timothy Nathan to remember the complete story, and once again you have rewarded me with your loyalty. You are both doing fine children, and you have nothing to fear.�
It was after the evening meal that the Mistress and Nathan walked back down the stairs, and once again he walked over to her and looked into her eyes. �Yes I am still here Key Master, and you can never defeat me that quick. I am stronger than you and your magic mirror, and the Mistress has not got the power.� Nathan was looking into the girl&#8217;s eyes with scrutiny, and he could see that the eyes inside were losing their shine, he knew that they were in retreat. The mirror had given them no peace, he could now see by the girl&#8217;s haggard look that she was getting weaker. Nathan stood back up straight and turned to look at the Mistress, he just nodded, and without saying a word he sat down near the wall.
The Mistress turned also and walked to the opposite wall and took down the whip, and on her return she stopped at her mark and looked at the charge. The marks from the whipping that she had given the girl earlier; had almost disappeared and there was no redness to be seen. However that area would be left alone, it was now the time of her lower body to feel the kiss of the whip. Once again she threw the whip in front, and with her arm outstretched, it was barely reaching her body, but the mistress knew that the sharp stop at the end of the strike would stretch the leather just enough. 
The girl looked at the whip and then at the Mistress, and she knew that pain was an instance away. The look that she now gave the Mistress was of acceptance, and just for a fleeting moment there was also the look of tiredness. There was a fast flick of the whip, and once again it travelled at speed and accuracy. Snap! The stroke hit the girl on the belly, and it was followed by two more in quick succession, giving the girl or the beast no time to compose. The sound that came from the girl&#8217;s mouth was horrendous, it had been pulled from the depth of hell, and it was the sound of a thousand lost souls screaming for salvation. The whip was in flight once more as the echo&#8217;s bounced around the room, striking the girl on the inner thigh. Snap! And the body of the girl convulsively moved, her head was thrown back so fast that the Mistress feared she had broken it. Then she remembered the beast inside giving her the strength of many, and the whip was once again in collision with soft flesh. Snap! The whip it the soft flesh of the inner thighs five more times, before the Mistress moved forward to her next mark. Then the whip flew once more, but low and to wrap around the calf of her leg, and on its return, the whip had no time to rest. Snap! Snap! Snap! The face of the girl was now contorted in pain, but the Mistress never let up on the assault for another half an hour. She stopped and looked at the girl, whose torso was now as red as her top had been earlier in the day, and she coiled up the whip. The voice was there once more, �What are you afraid of me, you are weak and I felt no pain, come on you filthy whore show me what you can do.� Looking at Nathan she walked over to the wall, and without anymore sound, she walked out of the room.
Once the Mistress had closed the door, Nathan stood up and walked towards the girl, he could see the fear in her face, but it was not corresponding with the look in her eyes, and Nathan knew that the beast inside was losing control of the girl. The onslaught that the Mistress had served had made the beast weak, and when Nathan looked into her eyes, he could only just see the pained eyes of the monster inside. He stepped back and said, �Get your sleep now, for when the clock strikes midnight you will not sleep for a long time.� He wiped the hair from her eyes, and watched as they stared back in pain, then he turned and walked out of the room. He had been down there on his own for a long time, and when he came out of the stairs and into the hall, the Mistress was leaving the lounge. He could see the look on her face, and said, �There is no need for concern Donna Marie, all is as it should be. Tomorrow tell Belle that we will be moving her to the frame, and it will be the turn of her back. I will say good night Donna Marie,� and before she could answer he was walking up the stairs.









CHAPTER TEN

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was morning and Nathan was waiting in the hall for Belle to arrive, and when she arrived they went down together. He walked over to the girl and he could see that she was now exhausted and fatigued. He looked into her eyes and the eyes that were inside were still there but not as strong as they once were. There was no sound of bravado now, and there were no screams or laughing, the mirror had done its work, and it had almost drawn out all the evil that was inside her body, more would leave today, but it would be this night that would get rid of the beast. Nathan walked to the bench, and pulled out of the box a long chain, and the chain had shackles on one end, and with two feet of chain between the shackles. He handed it to Belle put that on one ankle, and then after you have taken her bond off the other clip it to her other ankle, and leaving her still attached to the cross. He then took out a collar with a pair of cuffs attached, and slipped it around the girls throat and fastened the buckles. He looked down and saw that Belle was ready, then he took a wrist out of the cross bonds and put it in the neck cuff, and did the same with the other. Then after he nodded once more Belle released the other foot, and after walking her slowly across to the frame, she was shackled once more. The props were placed back in the box once more, and Belle left the room.
Nathan walked over to the chair and sat down and waited for the Mistress to arrive and carry out her task. It was over an hour before she arrived, and she walked past where Nathan was sitting and around to the front of the girl, again there were no remaining marks. She looked into the girl&#8217;s eyes and could see the internal eyes looking back at her, but now instead of showing defiance, the eyes showed fear, and they were small as if in retreat. She had no need to ask Nathan what it meant, she knew that she was winning the battle, and there was not much longer to go. This task was taking her strength, because as soon as her head hit the pillows last night her eyes had closed in tiredness. She looked at Nathan, and he looked back and nodded, so she walked over to the wall and took hold of the whip. On turning, she glanced one more time at Nathan, and walked over to take up her mark.
There was nothing to look at but the whiteness of the girls back. Without any kind of warning the whip whistled its way to the target, the crack at the end was deafening when it broke the silence. Snap! But the reaction from the girl was even worse, because the wailing scream would have chilled the hottest blood. Nathan looked at the Mistress for a reaction, but her business-like manner would not allow her to show an expression of any description. Snap! The mistress watched her body jerk, as if it had just had a pulse of electricity run through it. Snap! The whip cut the air and bruised the skin, but the Mistress knew that when she comes back for the second session, the marks would have faded. On each of the strikes now there was no sound, and the Mistress realised that on the first the beast was not ready, and the girl felt the full force. But once again the beast was looking after its host, and taking her pain away. So the beast is blind without the host&#8217;s eyes, then that means he can be tormented and that will mean that he will get weak. Then not realising, she had stopped the session, and Nathan was looking at her, but he could see that she was thinking and gave her time. He saw a whisper of a smile cross her lips, and Nathan&#8217;s mind went back to when he was in the same place as he was now, but as a child, and he remembered his mother giving the same hint of knowing, and once again he relaxed his body. Snap! The whip struck the soft flesh on the rear of the thighs, and once again there was that distinctive wail. Several more strikes followed in quick succession, and the Mistress saw the girl&#8217;s head drop, so too did Nathan, and they both knew that the girl was now unconscious and that was no good to anyone. It did mean however that the beast was getting weak, and today would probably be the last day of the whipping. Nathan stood up and walked over to the girl and stood in front of her, he put his hand under her chin and lifted her face, the eyes were closed and he used the smelling salts to wake her up. Holding her head in that same position he looked into her dull eyes, and in the distance he could see the beast, but it was tired and he knew that the next session on the girl&#8217;s rear would put him in full retreat, and the last session of the day would be the end. Nathan could see the pain and tiredness in her eyes, and he could also see the unasked questions, but there was nothing he could say to help her to understand her plight. He gently lowered her head and said �Sleep, it is almost over, and your soul will soon be free once more.� Nathan walked to the wall once more and sat down, and when the Mistress looked at him, he shook his head from side to side. The Mistress coiled the whip and walked over to the wall replacing it once more, and then without a word to Nathan she walked out of the room. Nathan pointed at the wall and the Mirror turned around, and before his eyes he could see the evil escaping back to the hell it come from. He was sitting there a long time and then the mirror turned on its own accord, and when the panelled wall appeared he stood up. Once again he walked to the front of the girl, and she was looking back at him with sleepy eyes, �Sleep, and get all the rest you can while the evil sleeps,� he watched as her eyes dropped and she was hanging by her bonds. 
Then as he was walking towards the door he heard the Mistress say, �Yes Timothy, it is you that has my compassion.� Nathan smiled and walked out the door.
As he walked out of the door in the hall, the Mistress watched as he locked the door just by touching it, then she asked, �You have been down there a long time Timothy, is everything ok?� 
�Yes Donna Marie, all is as it should be. You were very clever to spot the floor in the beast&#8217;s resolve, and mother is pleased, you are learning your trade well, and the Charter House has nothing to fear. The next session will be short, because once she is turned to face her soul once more, the end will be close. At midnight the agents of the Charter House will arrive to take her to her salvation.�
�How will the agents know Timothy?�
He smiled as if he had a secret, �They just know.� He walked towards the main door just as Penny was walking in. �Just the person, we will go for a walk Penny, the tractor has to be picked up, it will give us an appetite.� He then took hold of her hand and walked out the door. 
After lunch the Mistress walked down with Nathan once more, inside the room Nathan walked over to the front of the girl. He looked at her face and could not help but see the tiredness and pain, and her mind crying out for answers, Nathan knew that there were none that could satisfy her silent curiosity. He walked away leaving her in state of confusion, and stepped over to the chair by the wall. The Mistress watched him as he sat down, and it was then she walked to the wall and retrieved the whip. She walked back and stood on her mark throwing the whip out at the same time. Then without waiting her normal time, she sent the whip down towards the girl knowing that it would strike her back. There was no scream this time, the beast was using all his strength to hold in, and several more strokes later there was still not a sound coming from the girl. The Mistress was covering her body, and Nathan watched her stop and coil up the whip, she looked over at Nathan and then replaced the whip. The silence in the room was deafening, and all that could be heard was the footsteps of the Mistress as she walked out of the room. Once again Nathan pointed at the mirror and watched as it revolved around, and he remained seated as the evil flowed from her body. There was not so much now, because the mirror had drained all, and to lose the beast, the girl had to be facing her demons. The mirror revolved once more, and Nathan walked over to where the girl was hanging, and after pushing a brick on the paved floor, the frame revolved around and the girl was facing the mirror once more. He heard the click of the lock and the frame was fixed, and once again he stepped in front of the girl, once again he gently lifted her head and stared into her eyes. There was no more gloss, just the dull look of a person that is ill and week, he could no longer see the eyes of the beast, because he too was resting, but that would soon come to an end. Her eyes closed in tiredness and not to prolong her torment further, he lowered her head, and wondered if this young girl could hold on through the final act. Nathan walked away from the frame with the girl asleep and over to the door, and as he was about to walk through the lights dimmed on their own. At the top of the stairs he walked to the main door, and outside into the fresh air, then stepping away from the house, he went to the small garden and sat on the wall. �I know how you feel Timothy, as I have felt that very same sorrow that you&#8217;re feeling now. She is an innocent caught up in a battle to destroy you and the Mistress of Chrystal House, it is not right and it is unfair, it is abuse of the Beast&#8217;s powers. You know by the pages of time that you read in the sky at night, that you can never change destiny. You should never have had to go through all this pain, and it is my fault and I am sorry.�
�No Mistress you should never say that, I am not ashamed to be born with your compassion and knowledge. I have watched you as a child do all the things that Donna Marie is doing, but not once did I ever feel guilt. I know that the pages say that the girl will be fine and live, but I think the scars on her mind will never heal, and as long as I live I will always pray for her salvation. You know that I know more than Donna Marie will ever know, and that knowledge is important for the future of Chrystal house, but it is heavy burden on my shoulders.�
�Timothy even when I have passed the flame onto Donna Marie I will come and talk to you, just like my mother talked to me through my short life. But it will be yours and my secret, because Donna Marie will never need my love as much as you will, I will never leave you my Timothy, it is the compassion that will hold you and I together. Look up in the top window timothy.� He did and there in the window was the Mistress looking back at him, she smiled and then disappeared in front of his eyes. Nathan smiled and after standing up he walked to the house for evening meal.
It was in the doorway that he saw the Mistress, �Good evening Timothy, is there any time that suits you to commence downstairs?�
�No because tonight will be her last session, and I have looked into her eyes, and it will only take the minimum of strokes to get rid of the beast, his reign has expired. Once the girl has been removed, you will formally be the Mistress of Chrystal House.� 
It was after the meal that Nathan and the Mistress walked into the punishment room. Nathan walked over to the girl and gently lifted her head, he looked into her eyes, �I see you beast, you are week and have no powers left, and the Mistress will send you back to where you came from, back with your Master.� Then he surprised the Mistress, by talking to the girl, �Hang in there, because your pain will soon be over, your salvation is near at hand.� He turned around and looked at the Mistress, �Six strokes only,� she saw the look in his eyes and nodded. Then as soon as he had sat down, the Mistress walked to the wall and fetched back her whip.
The Mistress stood in front of the girl, and without warning the whip curled and struck, the girl moaned because the beast could not protect her any more. Nathan looked at the Mistress and said, �Make her punishment quick, do not torment her because she has no protection.� The Mistress looked at Nathan, and could not understand him.
�Do as your brother tells you Donna Marie.� It was the voice of her mother and she sent five more fast strokes. 
Nathan never waited for the Mistress to return the whip, and he pointed at the mirror and watched it turn around. Not a lot happened and then a run of liquid ran from her abdomen but only in the mirror. The Mistress had turned to look at the mirror, and as it was happening there was a painful deep voice, �I will be back bitch.� The mirror turned around and as it was doing so, Nathan took the girl down and carried her to the recovery table. He threw a sheet over her body, and she opened her eyes. Looking down at her he said, �Please forgive me.�
The girl was trying to say something and he got close and she whispered, �Please forgive me.�
�You have done nothing wrong to be forgiven for.� He then walked to the far wall and pulled back the invisible curtain. Two monks with a stretcher and a nun walked in, the monks placed the girl on the stretcher and walked back out, and as the nun walked past Nathan stopped her. She looked at him, and he placed two gold coins in her hand, �It is to help with her salvation Sister.� The Nun crossed herself and blessed him, and gave him forgiveness. He dropped the curtain and walked back to the Mistress. �You are now the Mistress of Chrystal House.�
Their mother appeared and said �You have no further need of me children, and Timothy remember what I have told you, it is our secret. Now it is time I had a sleep,� as she spoke the mirror opened and she walked through the hole in the wall. Then the mirror closed once more.
�What did mother mean Timothy when she spoke to you?�
He smiled �It is our secret, do you mind?�
�I would have it no other way.�
