*�� *�� Start of Story�� *��
*�� *�� *�� *

&nbsp;

We were going to the performance of a stage hypnotist. 

My roommate, Leslie, had been given two tickets --� for

free --� by some guy she met in a
mall.� He told her he

was a 'front man' for the hypnotist and that giving

away the tickets was some kind of media thing.� A lot

of folks would have simply accepted that.� I was

skeptical.

&nbsp;

&quot;You're always suspicious of everything, Rhonda,&quot; my 

roomie said with a pout.� &quot;I
suppose it keeps you out of 

trouble, but it also keeps you from having any fun.&quot;

&nbsp;

It was possible I suppose that giving away tickets was a

way of attracting customers to a new act.� If the

performance was any good it might create a lot of

word-of-mouth publicity.� But
knowing Leslie, I

wondered if the guy was just hitting up on her.� My

roommate was really beautiful.�
And everyone knew it

except for Leslie herself.� She
really had no idea how

attractive she was and always thought of herself as

rather plain.

&nbsp;

Then again, I suppose you could say the same for me. 

I've never thought of myself as particularly good

looking either.� I don't see
anything special when I see

myself in a mirror.� But I've
been favorably compared

to Leslie on more than one occasion.�
And we both get

hit on often enough.� So it could
be.

&nbsp;

And maybe the ticket thing was legitimate as well.� But

if Leslie was determined to go, I sure has hell wasn't

going to let her go by herself.�
So there we were. 

Dressed up, looking good, and off to the theater.

&nbsp;

The tickets turned out to be real.�
We even had great

seats, right up front.� And the
show was surprisingly

good.� The opening act was this
magic guy who also

told jokes.� He was very talented
and really funny.� And

he also did some juggling.� So I
figured that even if the

Hypnotist was a flop, the evening was worth it.� But the

Hypnotist turned out to be even better than the opener.

&nbsp;

He asked for and got a bunch of volunteers from the

audience.� Leslie wanted to
volunteer us both, but I

said, 'no way.'� So we just
watched.� He started to

hypnotize about twenty audience members all at once. 

Pretty soon he had a half dozen of them in a trance and

sent the rest back to their seats.�
He said he could have

hypnotized them all if he were willing to spend enough

time, but for the sake of the show, he'd limit himself to

the best subjects who went under most quickly.� Could

be.� I was skeptical about that,
too.� I was wondering if

these were real volunteers of if they were plants.� But

Leslie said she knew one of the guys who was still up

on stage and she was sure he was no fake.

&nbsp;

The hypnotist also said he couldn't make the subjects

do anything they wouldn't do normally.�
I'd heard that

somewhere before.� But he said
that he could trick them

into doing all kinds of ridiculous things that wouldn't

physically hurt them.� And he was
right.� That was the

act.� He spent the next hour
running those poor slobs

through all kinds of silly stunts.�
He had them howling

like wolves and pretending to be other animals.� He had

the guy Leslie knew eat a raw onion and think it was an

apple.� That's when I was really
convinced.� To be

honest, it scared me a little.�
He had them dancing, and

singing, and acting just like they thought they had

talent.� But they were terrible,
so it was really funny. 

And no one got hurt at all, unless you consider severe

onion breath to be an injury.

&nbsp;

When it was over, he gave the volunteers a whole 

bunch of free gifts.� And that
made me think that maybe 

we should have gone up after all.�
Some of the stuff he

handed out was really nice.� He
also gave them lots of

free passes to come back and bring friends to one of the

later shows that week.� And that
really had me

convinced the free ticket thing was legitimate, too.� 

Then he said that everyone who had volunteered, 

whether he had hypnotized them or not, and everyone 

who had received a free pass to the performance was 

invited back stage to the Green Room for a party after 

the show.

&nbsp;

When it was over he got this huge standing ovation.� As

folks were filing out, Leslie and I debated whether or

not to go to the party.� Well, it
wasn't really much of a

debate.� Leslie really wanted to
go and I was only a

little hesitant.� So we went.

&nbsp;

And it turned out to be a lot of fun.�
There was plenty of

good food.� And no booze at all
which made me relax. 

I got to meet the magic guy and he was real nice.� He

was also quite a looker close up.�
He had a great ass

and, if his costume were any indication, he was pretty

well hung.� Of course, I
pretended not to notice.

&nbsp;

Leslie called me over and introduced me to the guy

who had given her the tickets.�
He seemed a little shifty

to me.� I'm not sure why, there
was just something

about him.� She also introduced
me to her friend who'd

been in the act.� He couldn't
remember anything about

it at all.� He just said he felt
great.� In fact he'd never

felt better in his life.� But I
didn't talk to him very long. 

He really stank of onion.� But he
didn't know that

either.

&nbsp;

Later, I introduced Leslie to the Magic man.� And while

we were talking I noticed the shifty guy talking to the

Hypnotist.� I might not have paid
any attention, except

the two of them kept glancing over at us.� I supposed

they were talking about Mr. Magic, but it still gave me

the creeps.

&nbsp;

It was a nice party, but broke up fairly quickly.� I

glanced at my watch and figured it was time to leave. 

It was just late enough that I could have gone home and

to bed without another thought.�
But it was just early

enough that I could have gone out with Leslie to a

coffee shop to spend a while chatting.�
I wondered what

she wanted to do.� Where was
she?� I finally spotted her

talking with the Hypnotist.� She
waved me over.� For

reasons which I couldn't explain, I started getting that

creepy feeling again.

&nbsp;

We were being invited to an after party-party up in the

Hypnotist's Penthouse Suite at the Plaza Hotel.� My

first thought was, 'Bullshit!'� I
wasn't going to be some

kind of sexual groupie.� But
before I could embarrass

myself by expressing that thought, Leslie assured me

that this was a real party with at least a dozen people. 

She told me Mr. Hypnotist traveled with a small troupe

of supporting personnel and that they always celebrated

a good opening night with a party in his room.� Leslie

said a couple of other girls and the two of us were being

invited because the supporting crew were two-thirds

men.� They liked to invite some
local girls in to even

out the numbers.� I could believe
that.� Men always like

lots of women at parties.� They
need to think there's at

least an outside chance they might get laid.

&nbsp;

Leslie said we were being invited because we'd made

such a good impression on Mr. Magic.�
Humph.� I was

still doubtful, but the shine in her eyes was so bright, I

just knew she wanted to go.� And
I didn't have the heart

to disappoint her.� I suppose I
could have begged off

and let her go alone.� But that
would have put a damper

on the party for her.� And
besides, I felt I needed to be

there to keep an eye on things.�
Leslie was far too

trusting.

&nbsp;

So we found ourselves at the penthouse party.� It was a

nice room.� Well, a nice set of
rooms actually.� It was

huge.� And I really liked the
crew members.� In

addition to Mr. Magic there were some stage hands, a

prop guy, an accountant and a couple of other guys who

I never did figure out what they did.�
They all seemed

like good people.� The only one
who still gave me the

willies was the ticket guy but he kept pretty much to

himself, so he didn't bother me much.�
And there were

also a few women.� There was an
assistant to the

Hypnotist and another for Mr. Magic.�
There was a P.R.

liaison -- whatever that was.

&nbsp;

There was also a rather intense looking woman named

Della who was introduced to me as the Road Manager. 

She was a tall, dark haired woman with very pale skin. 

She looked as if she'd once been cast in the roll of Mrs.

Dracula.�� But she was very
friendly and we ended up

talking for a long time.� She
told me a little about the

show, but a whole lot about the practical uses of

hypnosis.� She was really big on
hypnosis as a medical

tool and for self-improvement.�
At first it was all very

interesting, but after a while I began to feel like maybe

she was hitting on me.� There was
just something in her

manner and the way she looked at me.

&nbsp;

I was about to excuse myself and find someone else to

talk to when Leslie came walking up with the

Hypnotist.� She was all excited
again.� He had been

telling her about how she could use hypnosis to make

controlling her diet easy.�
Leslie was hardly fat.� In fact

she had a fabulous shape.� But it
was a constant battle

for her and the hypnotist told her he could make it easy. 

And she said I could use hypnosis to improve my

concentration for my studies.� I
had been taking night

classes and was having troubles of my own.� The

Hypnotist said it would make study easy and automatic

and guarantee me better grades.

&nbsp;

While we were talking he put his arm around Mrs.

Dracula.� It turned out she was
his live-in girlfriend as

well as being the Road Manager.�
That made me feel a

lot more comfortable about both of them.� I mean if

they were committed to each other, neither one would

be hitting on Leslie or me, right?

&nbsp;

I guess the promise of making my studying easier was

just what it took to get me to agree.�
Leslie of course

was already hyped.� I don't know
what the Hypnotist

promised the other two girls, but whatever it was, they

were as excited as Leslie.

&nbsp;

So the Hypnotist moved us to a small dining room table

with four chairs around it.� Each
girl sat in one of the

chairs.� There was a candle in
the center of the table

and the Hypnotist lit it.� I
could look up over the candle

flame and see one of the other girls looking back at me. 

She was a cute little redhead with a nice smile.� Leslie

was to my right and the fourth girl, a tall blond, was to

my left.� Everyone else was
sitting or standing in a wide

circle around us.� The room
lights were switched off

and the whole scene was lit up only by the flickering

candle.

&nbsp;

For a moment everything seemed incredibly weird.� I

almost got up and laughed the whole thing off but then

the Hypnotist started talking.�
His voice was, for lack of

a better word, absolutely hypnotic.

&nbsp;

He told us to concentrate on the candle flame and I did. 

He told us to raise our right hands and point at the

flame and I did that too.� The
redhead across from me

was pointing at the flame, but somehow it felt like she

was pointing at me.� That was
kind of spooky.� But by

now, I was really concentrating on the voice.� The voice

told me my arm would grow heavy and tired much

faster than it normally would.� I
suppose I could have

held my arm pointing at the candle like that for many

minutes, but the voice was right.�
Within a few

moments it felt very heavy and tired.�
I noticed the

redhead's arm already starting to drop.�
She had a

somewhat startled look on her face.�
When I looked

back at my arm it had practically fallen down to the

table level.� I tried to lift it,
but somehow I couldn't.� I

didn't know if I should be freaked out or delighted that

it was working.

&nbsp;

Once all four arms were down, the voice told us that

they would start to feel light again.�
The voice said they

would begin to float up and point back at the candle. 

And damned if they didn't.� All
four arms started

slowly and jerkily to rise.� This
was super weird.� But I

was fascinated nonetheless.� And
soon we were all

pointing at the candle and at each other again.

&nbsp;

Then the voice said our arms would again grow heavy

and drop, only this time so would our eyelids.� The

voice said we were supposed to try to fight this as hard

as we could, but that soon our arms would hit the tables

and when they did our eyes would be closed.� The last

thing I remembered seeing was a blurred image of my

limp hand as it was coming to rest on the tablecloth.

&nbsp;

��������������������� *�� *��
*�� *�� *

&nbsp;

I was floating on a cloud.� My
eyes were closed and I

could only feel the sensation of floating.� The only

thing I could hear was the voice.�
I felt wonderful.� The

voice talked and I listened.� But
it was like some other

part of me was paying attention.�
I was just floating.� I

wished it would never end.

&nbsp;

��������������������� *�� *��
*�� *�� *

&nbsp;

I was floating in space and far away there was a distant

sun.� I could feel the warmth of
the sun on my face and

hands as I watched it in the darkness of space.� A voice

told me the sun was moving farther away and I saw it

getting smaller and dimmer.� The
voice said the warmth

was leaving and I started to get colder.� Much colder. 

Soon I felt like I was freezing.�
I wanted to cry.� It was

cold and dark and I could feel myself trembling.

&nbsp;

Then the voice told me the sun was returning.� And

soon I was feeling warm and comfortable again.

&nbsp;

��������������������� *�� *��
*�� *�� *

&nbsp;

I was sitting on a beach.� It was
a lovely warm day. 

The sun was shining, a breeze was blowing, and the sea

was beautiful.� A voice said it
was time to get into my

swim suit.� So I kicked off my
shoes and stood up.� I

started taking off my clothes and piling them on the

beach chair until I was down to my bikini.� And this

was a little strange because I didn't even own a bikini.

&nbsp;

I heard what sounded like a bunch of people clapping. 

I looked around to find out where it was coming from. 

But then the voice said it was the sound of sea birds. 

And sure enough, when I listened again, I could hear

the gulls calling to each other in the distance.

&nbsp;

Then the voice said the sun was getting closer and it

was getting hotter.� Soon I felt
like I was sweating like

crazy.� I wanted to run down and
jump in the water but

I couldn't seem to find it.� The
voice said I'd feel much

cooler if I weren't wearing my bikini.�
I was

embarrassed at the thought of being naked in such a

public place and was torn between the heat and my

embarrassment.� But the voice
assured me that this was

a very private beach and that I would feel very safe and

comfortable once I had removed my swim suit.� So I

carefully removed the top.� I was
a little surprised to

find it unhooked like a bra rather than untying.� But

then I slipped out of my bottoms and sure enough I

could feel the cool sea breeze and I was no longer hot. 

I stretched in the warm sea air and listened to the gulls

calling to each other again.

&nbsp;

The voice told me that I'd better put on some sun tan

lotion so as not to get burned.�
It said there was a tube

of lotion near my feet.� So I
bent over and picked it up

and started putting it on.

&nbsp;

Then the voice told me not to be alarmed, but that some

good friends of mine were about to show up.� The voice

said not to bother getting my swim suit back on, my

friends were nude sun bathing too and that we could

help each other out by carefully putting sun tan lotion

on each other to be sure we didn't miss any spots.

&nbsp;

And there was Leslie and the two girls I had met at the

Hypnotist's party.� It seemed
strange to see them on

this beach all naked like that.�
But the voice had said it

was OK, so I didn't give it another thought.� And soon

we were lotioning each other down and having a great

time.

&nbsp;

It was funny.� The birds were
suddenly quite loud, but I

still couldn't see them.

&nbsp;

��������������������� *�� *��
*�� *�� *

&nbsp;

I was at the Hypnotist's party.�
A voice said I was a

dog.� Had I always been a
dog?� No matter, it was good

to be a dog.� But what was really
funny was that three

human girls were pretending to be dogs.�
I started

jumping around and barking at them.�
They weren't

wearing any clothes at all.� I'd
never seen humans

behaving like that before and thought they looked silly. 

I was barking at them to tell them to stop that and to get

dressed.

&nbsp;

But they weren't paying any attention to me, so I just

kept barking.� Then one of the
men came over and

started scratching me behind my ears.�
I liked that.� It

felt nice.� He rolled me over on
my back and started

rubbing my belly and chest.� And
that felt really nice.� I

forgot all about the silly naked humans.� The man

called me a good girl and brought his hand up so I

could lick it.

&nbsp;

Soon lots of men were rubbing and scratching me.� I

loved being the center of attention.�
One of the men

reached down and checked something between my legs. 

I guess he must have been a Vet.�
I don't like going to

the Vet's office.� He said I was
wet.� I hope that doesn't

mean I'm going to get sick.� I
felt great.

&nbsp;

Then the voice told us all to sit up and beg and we all

did.� I whined a little because
the silly human girls were

still pretending to be dogs.� And
the voice must have

realized something was wrong, because the voice said

we were all dogs.� And when I
looked again I realized

the voice was right.� I must have
been mistaken before. 

They were all bitches just like me.

&nbsp;

The voice had the long blond bitch do some tricks in

the center of the room.� She was
an afghan and must

have been a racing dog.� I wished
the voice would ask

me to do some tricks too.� I
liked being the center of

attention.

&nbsp;

Then the voice had me walk over and check out the

blond bitch's ass.� The voice
said her ass would smell

wonderful.� So I went over and
checked.� And sure

enough she had the nicest smelling ass.�
It was

wonderful being a dog and getting to smell the asses of

other dogs.� Humans just don't
know what they're

missing.

&nbsp;

The voice said the blond bitch loved having her ass

smelled by me and sure enough she made little yelping

noises of pleasure and wiggled her ass while I sniffed. 

Then the voice told me to lick her ass and clean it for

her.� It said I would find the
taste wonderful.� And it

was.� And the long blond bitch
loved that too.

&nbsp;

The other two dogs were doing something else, but I

wasn't paying any attention.� I
was having too much

fun licking the blond bitch's ass.�
All the humans in the

room were laughing and clapping.�
Everyone was

having a great time.� I was very
happy.

&nbsp;

��������������������� *�� *��
*�� *� �*

&nbsp;

I was floating.� I couldn't seem
to remember where I

was.� But it didn't matter.� I felt great and it was good

just to float.� It seemed to go
on for a long time.

&nbsp;

��������������������� *�� *��
*�� *�� *

&nbsp;

I was on my knees.� I was naked
but that didn't seem to

bother me.� I was on a thick rug
in a large empty room. 

I could hear voices, but they seemed far away.� A voice

told me I was thirsty.� And I
was.� The voice told me I

wanted a popsicle to suck on.�
And I did.� The voice

said they were going to give me some new kind of

popsicle with a special delicious cream filling.� All I

had to do was to suck on it and enjoy it and be sure not

to bit it or scratch my teeth on it.

&nbsp;

And there was the popsicle.� It
almost seemed to be

floating on the air in front of my face.� It was kind of

strange looking, but the voice said it would taste good. 

So I leaned forward and took a lick.�
It was great.� It

was a really strange popsicle because it was soft and

rather warm.� But it had such a
delightful flavor.� I

couldn't quite tell what it tasted like, but I couldn't get

enough of it either.� I just kept
licking and sucking.

&nbsp;

The voice told me that if I kept that up, I'd get to the

special cream filling soon.� The
voice told me there

were some special cream filling sacks under the back of

the popsicle.� And that if I were
to gently rub and

squeeze them I'd get more filling.�
But I had to be

careful not to rub or squeeze them too hard.� So I

brought up my hands and started fondling the little

sacks.

&nbsp;

I could hear little moaning sounds of pleasure in the

background.� I wasn't sure what
they were, but they

sounded happy.

&nbsp;

Then the popsicle started to twitch and throb and my

mouth was filled with the most delightful tasting cream. 

I licked it all down and was disappointed the popsicle

didn't give me any more.

&nbsp;

The popsicle was taken away after that and the voice

asked if I'd like another.� I
said, 'Oh yes,&quot; and there

was another popsicle for me.

&nbsp;

This time, while I was sucking on the popsicle, I could

feel ghost-like hands on my head.�
It felt like they were

grabbing my hair and it bothered me.�
I tried shaking

my head a little to make the hands go away.� I grunted

and reached up to push them off.�
The voice asked me

what was wrong.� I had to let go
of that wonderful

popsicle to answer.� But then the
voice told me I liked

the feel of the ghost hands, and what do you know?� I

did.

&nbsp;

I had a third popsicle and still wanted more.� But the

voice said it was time to call it a night.

&nbsp;

��������������������� *�� *��
*�� *�� *

&nbsp;

I was at the Hypnotist's party.�
My mind seemed foggy. 

The lighting had been turned way down.�
I was naked,

but somehow that seemed natural.�
I wondered in a

casual way where my clothes were.�
Leslie was

standing near me and she was naked, too.� That also

didn't seem to bother me.� Leslie
had a silly smile but

the rest of her face was blank.�
She wasn't bothered by

her nakedness either.� I turned
my head a little at some

noises behind me.� I seemed to be
moving in slow

motion, like I was underwater or something.� The two

girls who came to the party with us were both naked

and so where a half dozen of the men from the crew.� I

couldn't tell exactly what was going on, but it looked

like a lot of sex.� The redhead
was on her hands and

knees and there was a naked guy at her face and another

behind her.� I caught a half
glimpse of the blond.� Her

head seemed to be bobbing up and down.�
There were

giggles and moans and slurping noises coming from the

dimness across the room.

&nbsp;

I became aware of a conversation on my other side and

turned back.� It took a few
moments.� It was the

Hypnotist and his road manager girl friend.� I couldn't

understand what they were saying.�
It was like I could

hear their voices, but I couldn't make any sense out of

their words.

&nbsp;

The woman reached up and touched Leslie on the

shoulder.� The hypnotist looked
like he was about to

say something.� But then the
woman changed her mind

and put her hand on my shoulder instead.� I could see

her hand, but I couldn't feel it.

&nbsp;

They hypnotist smiled and then he looked me right in

the eye. &quot;Rhonda,&quot; he said, &quot;can you hear me?&quot;

&nbsp;

Somehow, his calling my name made everything clear. 

Well not everything.� I still
couldn't understand what

anyone else was saying.� But I
could really understand

him.

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes,&quot; I replied.

&nbsp;

&quot;Listen carefully.� I want
you to hear Della's voice as

well as mine.� Do whatever her
voice tells you for the

rest of the evening.� Do you
understand?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Good Girl.&quot;� He turned
his girlfriend and said, &quot;Ok,

she's all yours.� I'll see you in
the morning.&quot;� Then the

two of them kissed for a long time.�
I vaguely wondered

why they were interested in me if they were going to

spend the night kissing each other.�
But as soon as they

broke off, the woman turned to me and said, &quot;Follow

me.&quot;� And as she moved off,
I followed her.� Behind me

I could hear the Hypnotist talking again, &quot;Leslie, can

you hear me?&quot;

&nbsp;

��������������������� *�� *� �*��
*�� *

&nbsp;

I was in a dungeon.� It was dark
and cold and dirty.� I

was naked and I was leaning up against a wall.� My

hands were spread out above my head and my feet were

spread, too, a couple of feet back from the wall.� Both

my hands and feet were somehow locked in position.� I

couldn't tell how, exactly.� But
I couldn't move them.� I

could hear Mistress Della moving behind me.

&nbsp;

How had I gotten here?� How did I
know that was

Mistress Della behind me?� Just
who the hell *was*

Mistress Della anyway?� I was
scared.� But somehow, I

was also very horny?� Why the
hell would being in this

kind of situation make me hot?�
What was going on?

&nbsp;

Mistress Della was very close now.�
I could feel her

moving right up against me.� 'Oh
my God!'� She wasn't

wearing any clothes.� I could
feel her naked body

pressing up against mine.� She
was reaching around and

feeling my breast.� She was
tweaking my nipple.� It was

really hard.

&nbsp;

The voice was talking to me again.�
It was like the

voice of God.� &quot;Now, my
sweet,&quot; she said, &quot;it's time for

you to feel the sting of my lash.&quot;

&nbsp;

I was trembling.� She held
something up next to my

face.� It was the belt to a
bathrobe.� &quot;You see this?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes, Mistress.&quot;� Now
why the hell was I calling her

that?� Why was I being so
meek?� I wanted to scream

and cry.

&nbsp;

&quot;It's a whip,&quot; she said.�
&quot;It's a big, black, evil whip.&quot;

&nbsp;

I looked again and she was holding a whip.� I was so

scared I wanted to pee.

&nbsp;

&quot;When I use it, you'll hear the crack and feel the

searing pain on your backside.�
Won't you?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes, Mistress.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;And the feel of the whip will make you even hotter. 

Won't it?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes, Mistress.&quot;� I was
already starting to cry and she

hadn't even hit me yet.� Tears
were running down my

cheeks.� But my pussy felt so
damned wet.� Why was

all this making me so horny?

&nbsp;

She was kissing the back of my neck now and still

fondling my breast.� God it felt
good!� But why was I

getting so turned on by another woman?�
A woman

who was about to whip me?� I
started crying even more.

&nbsp;

Then I felt her move back away from me.�
I was

trembling even harder.� But
nothing happened at first. 

Just some quiet squishing sounds from behind.� I

screwed up some courage and looked back over my

shoulder.� The woman was just
standing there with her

mouth slightly open and her eyes half closed.� She was

holding the whip with one hand and the other hand was

between her own legs.� She was
masturbating.� Then

she noticed me looking at her.

&nbsp;

&quot;Eyes forward, Bitch!&quot; she yelled.

&nbsp;

I quickly turned back and started praying.� I hadn't

prayed in years, but I was praying now.

&nbsp;

There were more little squishing sounds and then a long

terrifying silence.

&nbsp;

Suddenly I felt the whip crack against my back.� There

was a piercing agonizing pain like a streak of

lightening.� It felt like a sharp
intense orgasm.� I wanted

to scream but for some reason I couldn't.� I could only

grunt.� A moment later, there was
another crack of the

whip and then another and another.

&nbsp;

I could feel her cracking the whip all over my backside. 

The pain was so extreme I almost came.�
I wanted to

come.� I wanted to holler.� But all I could do was to

whimper and grunt and twitch in sexual heat.�� I wished

that my knees would buckle under me, but somehow I

remained standing.� I wanted to
fall on the floor and

die, but my bonds kept me upright.

&nbsp;

The woman started whipping my behind, and then my

legs.� It was horrible.� It was unendurable.� I was so

horny I couldn't stand it.� I
wanted so badly to reach

down and touch myself until I could find some release,

but I couldn't move my hands.�
Tears were flooding

down my face.

&nbsp;

There was a brief pause.� Then I
felt the whip again, but

this time the woman had moved in more closely and the

whip was wrapping itself around my body and cracking

against my front side.� I could
feel the intense

lightening on my belly and on my breasts and on the

front of my legs.� One stroke
came around and even

cracked against my vulva.� That
one almost sent me

over the edge.

&nbsp;

And still I couldn't scream.� And
still I couldn't move. 

And still I couldn't touch myself.

&nbsp;

Then it stopped.

&nbsp;

The woman came up behind me again.�
The touch of

her body against my tortured backside was exquisite.� It

was intensely, painfully erotic.�
She must have dropped

her whip, because I could feel both her hands on me. 

Rubbing my abused breasts, pinching my swollen

nipples, scratching my tortured belly.�
I felt one hand

slide down and bury itself in my crotch.� There was no

resistance.� I was so wet.� Her fingers sank into my

warm flesh like I had been specially lubricated.

&nbsp;

She started rubbing on my clit and I just knew I would

come at any moment.� But her
voice said, &quot;Not yet,

kitten.� Don't come yet.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;OK, Mistress.&quot;

&nbsp;

And somehow, despite my horniness, I couldn't bring

myself over the edge.� She just
kept moving her hands,

and tweaking my most sensitive areas, and rubbing her

own body and breasts into my back.�
My tears and my

other juices were still flowing freely.

&nbsp;

After awhile she stopped and told me my bounds had

been released.

&nbsp;

��������������������� *�� *��

&nbsp;

I was lying on the floor in a fancy hotel room.� I was

naked and somehow I knew that I'd been severely

whipped even though I couldn't see any whip marks. 

My entire body was in agony, but somehow it was a

sexual agony.� I was curled into
a fetal position but I

still couldn't bring my hands down to finger myself.

&nbsp;

A naked woman was sitting in a chair a few feet away. 

I recognized her as the Hypnotist's road manager, but

she was also my Mistress.� 'My
Mistress?!'

&nbsp;

&quot;Are you hot, Slave?&quot; she asked.� &quot;Do you want to

come?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Oh yes, Mistress!&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Then beg for it, Slave,&quot; she said.� &quot;Beg for it and

prove how much you want it.&quot;

&nbsp;

I didn't care how humiliating this was.�
I uncurled a bit

and started begging and whining and pleading for my

Mistress to let me come.� I was
crying and cringing. 

The sexual pain was awful. 

&nbsp;

This went on for awhile while the woman in the chair

kept fingering herself.� Then she
said something which

I didn't hear because I was making so much noise

myself.� &quot;Mistress?&quot; I
whined.

&nbsp;

&quot;I said, crawl over here and kiss my feet.� And do a

better job of begging me to let you come.&quot;

&nbsp;

And even as she continued fingering herself, I crawled

over on my belly and started kissing her feet.� Between

kisses I continued my pathetic begging.

&nbsp;

The woman really seemed to be getting off on my

humiliation.� She started
breathing louder and her

fingers were moving faster.

&nbsp;

&quot;Shut up and lick my feet, Slut.�
Just shut the fuck up

and lick my toes.&quot;

&nbsp;

And I did.� Tears still streaming
down my face.� A

terrible sexual ache in my groin.�
I stuck out my tongue

and began licking all around and between her toes. 

And somewhere in there, I heard her come.� Her whole

body went rigid, pulsed for several long moments, and

then went slack.� I never stopped
licking her toes the

whole time.

&nbsp;

Minutes later, when her breathing came back to normal,

I was sill licking her toes.

&nbsp;

&quot;Enough!&quot;

&nbsp;

��������������������� *�� *��
*�� *�� *

&nbsp;

I was lying on a large bed in a fancy hotel room.� I was

naked and somehow I knew that I'd been severely

whipped.� A voice said &quot;Roll
onto your back, Slave.&quot;� I

rolled over, even though every move was a sexual

agony.� &quot;Spread your legs,
Slave,&quot; the voice said and I

did.

&nbsp;

Looking down between my legs I saw Hypnotist's road

manager, walking up toward me.�
She was naked.� And

somehow I knew she was my Mistress.�
'My

Mistress?!'

&nbsp;

She looked down at me.� &quot;Are
you horny, Slave?� Do

you want to come?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes, Mistress!�
Please!&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Then beg for it, Slave,&quot; she said, &quot;and maybe I'll let

you.&quot;

&nbsp;

And while I was begging and pleading and humiliating

myself she just stood there looking pleased with herself

and lightly rubbing her own breast with one hand.

&nbsp;

&quot;OK!� Now shut up,&quot; she
said.� &quot;I'm going to make you

come.� But not until I give you
the signal.� When I'm

ready for you to come, I'll squeeze your tit.� OK?� Do

you understand?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes, Mistress, I'm not to come until you squeeze my

breast.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Press your titties together.&quot;

&nbsp;

I did so.� My breasts weren't
huge, but they were large

enough that I could do what she'd ordered.

&nbsp;

&quot;Now hold them like that.�
You're going to get even

hotter than you are now.� You're
going to get so damn

hot you won't be able to stand it.�
But all you'll be able

to do is to writhe around and make sexy noises letting

me know how much you're enjoying being eaten. 

Understand?'

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes, Mistress, I'm to writhe around and make sexy

noises but not to come until you squeeze my breast.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Hummph,&quot; she said.�
&quot;OK slut, keep begging me to eat

you.� And then shut up when you
feel my mouth on

your cunt.&quot;

&nbsp;

I started begging again and didn't stop until my

Mistress lay down between my legs and starting licking

me.� The feel of her mouth was
amazing.� I'd been

licked by a couple of boyfriends before, but never

anything like this.� I was
moaning and whining and

thrashing.� The feel of my own
breasts was incredible. 

This went on for what seemed like an eternity.� I felt

the woman's fingers in my vagina.�
And then she stuck

a finger in my rear hole.� I was
completely wet and

lubricated down there.

&nbsp;

And without warning, she suddenly reached up and

pinched my right breast really hard.�
And I came, and

came, and came, and came.� I'd
never come like that

before.� It seemed to go on
forever.

&nbsp;

��������������������� *�� *��
*�� *�� *

&nbsp;

I was standing at the foot of a large bed in a fancy hotel

room.� I was naked and there was
a thin sash tied

around my neck.� A voice said it
was a collar and a

leash and when I looked again it was.

&nbsp;

The Hypnotist's road manager was sitting cross legged

on the bed in front of me and she was holding the leash. 

She was naked and she was also my Mistress.� 'My

Mistress?!'

&nbsp;

I felt drained, but I didn't know why.�
My muscles were

sore.

&nbsp;

&quot;OK, bitch,&quot; she said.�
&quot;It's time for you to lick *my*

cunt.� Do it just like I did
you.&quot;

&nbsp;

I couldn't remember what she was talking about, but

somehow I new what she wanted.�
It was horrible.� I'm

not a lesbian.� I've never even
touched another

woman's private areas before.�
But my Mistress tugged

the leash and I found myself climbing up onto the bed

between her legs.� She lay back
and pulled my face

right into her hot crotch.

&nbsp;

It was awful.� But it was also
incredibly sexy somehow. 

Why was that?� I found myself
weeping even as I licked

and fingered her.� I could feel
her fingers in my hair;

her hands holding my head and guiding my motions.

&nbsp;

I wanted to throw up.� But I just
kept licking and

licking and fingering and fingering.

&nbsp;

And then she came.� She went
rigid all at once and

pressed my face into her crotch really hard.� She yelled

at me to stop licking.� I could
feel her wet flesh pulsing

under my lips.� I could feel
tears running down the

sides of my nose and dripping into her pubic hair.� She

just kept pressing my face into her until the

contractions had stopped.� Then
she relaxed her grip

and for a long time we just lay quietly.� There was

nothing but the sound of her heavy breathing and my

own whimpering.

&nbsp;

Then it was over.

&nbsp;

��������������������� *�� *��
*�� *�� *

&nbsp;

I woke up at home in bed.� My
head felt like it was full

of Kleenex but somehow I felt wonderful.� I knew my

muscles were sore, but it didn't bother me.� In fact I

really felt great.� I got up and
took some Motrin

anyway.

&nbsp;

Leslie was sitting at the breakfast table with a cup of

coffee.� She looked like I was
feeling.

&nbsp;

What the hell had happened last night?�
I remembered

the show and the Green Room party.�
Then everything

was a fuzzy blank.� I didn't
remember having had

anything to drink, but this sure felt like some kind of

hangover.� I didn't even remember
coming home, but

here we were.� I asked Leslie
what happened, but she

couldn't remember, either.

&nbsp;

&quot;I guess we must have had a good time,&quot; I said without

much conviction.

&nbsp;

&quot;I guess so,&quot; she replied weakly.

&nbsp;

��������������������� *�� *��
*�� *�� *

&nbsp;

About a month later, Leslie turned up pregnant.� She

had to decide what she wanted to do about that.� But the

weird thing was that she claimed she hadn't had sex for

over a year.� A lot of folks
would have been very

skeptical about that.� But
somehow, I believed her.
