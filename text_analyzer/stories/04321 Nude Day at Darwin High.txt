������������������ Nude Day at Darwin High

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Nude
Day falls on the last day of every school year. 

Today
is my first. I put on a brand new pair of panties 

and my
best bra so that whichever boy undresses me will 

see
nice things. I go into the kitchen in my peasant 

blouse
and retro pleated skirt but I can't eat. 

&nbsp;

The
protest sign is so bulky that Mom drives me to 

Darwin
High. I put it up near the main entrance, next 

to the
clothes lockers. The other seven girls join me 

and we
huddle behind it. Soon other students begin to 

arrive.
Those that are already naked go directly into 

the
school. The rest disrobe and lock their clothes up 

first.

&nbsp;

There
are a lot of nude couples, mostly upperclassmen. 

As one
pair goes by they are talking about the 

Exploratorium.
I guess they were lucky enough in the 

school
lottery to snag a time slot today. I've never 

been
inside, but they say the Ex is the best place in 

school
to make love, because the principal put in real 

nice
beds and there's a shower and all. 

&nbsp;

Of
course for legal reasons a Federal Nudity Inspector 

monitors
couples via closed circuit. But I've heard 

that
the cam can be turned off if both students face it 

and
clearly state their consent.

&nbsp;

I know
all five of the clothed and boisterous freshmen 

boys
who are standing in front of our sign. They're 

reading
it, nudging each other, laughing, getting their 

courage
up.

&nbsp;

PROTEST!

&nbsp;

WE ARE
OPPOSED TO THE PRACTICE OF NUDE DAY; THEREFORE 

WE
WILL NOT TAKE OFF OUR CLOTHES. IN THE SPIRIT OF 

PASSIVE
RESISTANCE, WE WILL ALLOW OTHERS TO REMOVE 

THEM,
BUT WE ASK THAT YOU NOT SHAME YOURSELVES BY DOING 

THIS.

&nbsp;

Of
course we pretty much know it isn't going to work, 

but
sometimes you protest just to make a point. Even in 

the
unlikely event that the boys do leave us alone, 

sooner
or later we'll have to undress ourselves. The 

law
says anyone who doesn't participate on Nude Day 

must
repeat the whole school year. You'd never 

graduate!
So that's why, when we discussed how we were 

going
to protest, we couldn't go with Civil 

Disobedience.

&nbsp;

So we
went with the Gandhi thing. He believed that 

people
of good conscience will desist from immoral 

behavior
when gently shown the right path. Uh-huh. Teen 

boys.
Girls to be stripped. Conscience. Looking at the 

boys,
I know the whole protest is way lame. The boys 

probably
think we are just teasing them.

&nbsp;

They
are rowdy now. They want to know why we think 

we are
better than the other girls. We're all wearing 

skirts
as a sign of solidarity. Bruce orders us to pull 

them
up so he can see if we are wearing anything 

underneath,
and Dawn even starts to comply. Finally 

Jason
just walks around the sign and up to Marci and as 

he
unzips her skirt he says, &quot;I can do this, right?&quot; 

She
nods, terrified. He pops the button and pulls the 

skirt
right off and there she is in her panties and all 

the
boys are staring. And then he reaches forward and 

does
something really naughty. I suppose Gandhi would 

not
have slapped him, but Marci is not Gandhi.

&nbsp;

Now
the boys are surging forward, each picking a 

victim,
but no one chooses me. Fingers fumble nervously 

with
unfamiliar closures. Soon five girls stand 

blushing
in their under things. The boys hesitate, 

momentarily
awed. Do they feel shame? Jason again takes 

the
lead. He kneels before Marci and slowly lowers her 

panties,
inch by inch. She bites her lip and looks at 

the
sky. The other boys crowd close, eyes burning. They 

speak
indecorously. They turn on the remaining girls. 

&nbsp;

Some
boys tear at panties and bras, while others, like 

Jason,
prefer a slow delicious unveiling. In the end it 

does
not matter. When all the girls are naked the boys 

line
them up and walk around them in a circle, 

comparing
I guess, whispering to each other and 

laughing.
Then each boy picks up his victim's clothes 

and
goes to a locker. They undress. Pitched clothing 

merges,
panties entwine with boxers and briefs. When 

the
boys turn around, the girls gasp. The ten of them 

enter
the school.

&nbsp;

The
other two girls can't stand the tension of waiting 

to be
stripped. They go to the lockers, disrobe, and go 

inside.
I'm all alone with my sign and I know I can't 

stay
clothed long. More boys are coming up the walk all 

the
time. I spot a tall boy just as he sees the sign. 

&nbsp;

I
don't know his name, but he's a senior on the swim 

team.
He's showing a sense of humor by coming dressed 

in
tighty-whities and nothing else. He has that nice 

swimmer's
build with broad shoulders and well defined 

pecs,
tight stomach, narrow waist, nice tan. As he 

reads
our lame sign he starts laughing, catches my eye, 

winks.
I'm laughing, too.

&nbsp;

&quot;I'm
Bill.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Cassie&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Will
you raise your arms to help me get it off?&quot; His 

hands
are already on my blouse.

&nbsp;

&quot;Sorry,
no, I'm going to stick with the plan.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Then
if I raise your arms, will you keep them up?&quot; I 

nod.

&nbsp;

He
brings them up and lifts off the blouse as gently as 

if he
were undressing a child. He reaches behind me and 

with
precise experienced hands unhooks my bra and draws 

it off
easily, like it's no big thing for him, and now 

my
breasts tumble out into the sun and there they are 

for
all the world to see. He looks at them with a 

gentle
smile, not staring, just enjoying himself, and 

he
looks in my eyes, too, but just for a second because 

I
lower mine. He steps away for a moment to put my 

stuff
in a locker.

&nbsp;

But I
need him back right away because coming up the 

walk,
strutting bare and swinging obscenely from side 

to
side, is that little snot Quentin Snow. Quentin is 

this
rotten freshman who likes to talk dirty to girls, 

plus
he has a mean streak. He thinks a girl will be 

turned
on if he asks her stuff like, does she 

masturbate
with one hand or two. And then he wonders 

why no
one will go out with him. 

&nbsp;

Yesterday
he stood in front of my locker and asked me 

my cup
size. When I wouldn't tell him, he laughed and 

held
up his hands and said he was going to find out in 

person
on Nude Day. Now as Quentin approaches his eyes 

are
fixed on my chest. I'm glad I'm not bottomless yet. 

Bill
comes back just in time. I whisper in his ear.

&nbsp;

&quot;Quick,
put your hands on my breasts.&quot;

&nbsp;

Bill's
delighted, but not grabby. He puts his palms 

square
on my nipples with his fingers spread lightly. 

Quentin
stops dead. I smile sweetly at him. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Sorry,
Quentin, but Bill is feeling me up right now. 

Maybe
later in the day you can catch me and get that 

measurement.&quot;
(When pigs fly!)

&nbsp;

Quentin
is intimidated by Bill's size. He mumbles 

something
unintelligible and disappears into the 

school.

&nbsp;

&quot;Thank
you! That little piece of trash has been after 

me all
semester. Bill, I need to ask a big favor.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Sure,
what?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I
need you to stick with me all day to protect me from 

that
rodent, and from some of the others, too.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;No
prob, but I'd need a couple of favors from you.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Two?&quot;
I ask warily. I'm half naked, after all.

&nbsp;

&quot;I'm
stuck in the down position and it's uncomfortable. 

I need
you to bring me up.&quot; He says this in a matter of 

fact
tone and in such good humor that I nod without 

really
understanding what he wants.

&nbsp;

He has
to show me. He takes my right hand in his left 

and
brings it around to the front of his briefs. With 

his
other hand he pulls out on the waistband. He gently 

pushes
me in an inch or so. I can feel soft hair. He 

lets
go and I take a deep breath and I slide my hand 

down
and I grasp him as easily as if it wasn't my first 

time.
I can feel the hard shaft. I close my hand around 

it and
give it a gentle rub as I draw it back up. I 

slowly
let the length of it glide through my fingers, 

feeling
the ridge below the head against my palm just 

before
I release it.

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes,
that's much better.&quot; Once again he winks. We 

burst
into laughter. I know I have just passed some 

sort
of a test without even knowing I was being tested.

&nbsp;

&quot;And
the other favor?&quot; I ask nervously.

&nbsp;

&quot;Let's
just call it a favor to be named later.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Bill...
I'm not ready...I mean I'm saving myself...&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes,
of course, that's OK. Now, where were we a few 

minutes
ago?&quot;

&nbsp;

Now
his palms are against my nipples again, moving 

gently
in slow small circles while he smiles into my 

eyes,
not a dirty smile, just a happy one. Has he done 

this
with other girls, on other Nude Days? I really 

don't
have to allow anything like this under the rules, 

but I
don't say no. 

&nbsp;

I'm
hardening in his hands and the harder they are the 

more
they poke out and the more they poke out the 

better
they feel and the harder they get. He's a bit 

detached,
a bit cool with his insolent touching. But I 

know
he's taking pleasure from my pleasure as I breathe 

hoarsely
through my mouth and cry out softly.

&nbsp;

Now
I'm lubricating and something inside me is doing 

flip-flops.
And I'm worried, knowing that Bill will be 

removing
my panties soon and they'll be damp. And he 

will
feel that and maybe even bring them up to his nose 

and
smell them or something way gross like that and 

then when
I'm all bare he'll look down there or maybe 

he'll
even touch me and find out just what kind of girl 

I am.
And I'm not that kind of girl. Or am I? All he is 

doing
is a little nipple rubbing, yet I'm as wet as a 

horse
at the end of a race.

&nbsp;

Finally
he takes his hands away. He unzips and removes 

my
skirt, laying it neatly on his arm so that both 

hands
are free to reach behind me and slide inside the 

rear
of my panties and lightly caress my bare fanny. 

And he
starts to bring his hands around in front but I 

quaver
out a &quot;no&quot; to keep him from feeling how wet I 

am,
but probably he thinks I'm just shy. Well, that 

too. 

&nbsp;

He
respects me. His hands go instead to my waistband 

and as
he slides my panties down he looks at me where 

no boy
has ever looked before, and for a moment his 

face
is so serious I think maybe I'm ugly or something. 

If he
notices moisture - and how could he not? - He's 

too
polite to mention it. 

&nbsp;

Finally
he breaks into a glorious smile and I'm 

relieved.
I'm blushing terribly but at the same time I 

have a
crazy idea to do something daring. I start to 

lower
my hands but I chicken out so I just smile back. 

The
sun kisses my bare body as he carries away the last 

of my
clothes. I desperately want them back. His back 

is to
me as he peels off his briefs. His tight butt is 

cute.
Then he turns around.

&nbsp;

Oh my,
is he happy to see me!

&nbsp;

In
grade school I spent lots of time looking, 

fascinated,
at a picture of Michelangelo's David. The 

sweet
little harmless thing I saw there nestled like a 

wren
in a hairy nest intrigued but didn't threaten a 

shy
girl.

&nbsp;

This
is nothing like that. It is angry, demanding, and 

scary.
I assume the 'favor to be named' involves taming 

this
beast. And I'm quite inexperienced.

&nbsp;

Fortunately
the bell rings just then. Bill takes my 

hand
and we enter the school.

&nbsp;

It
isn't as bad as I feared, because we are all in the 

same
boat. I want to cover myself with my free hand, 

but
nobody else is doing it so I guess it's considered 

unsportsmanlike.
The upperclassmen are generally 

practicing
eye etiquette anyway, but not the first 

timers.
I see my friend May posing for a knot of 

freshmen
boys. She's standing in the hall with her 

hands
locked behind her neck, chest thrust out, slowly 

rotating
her torso. 

&nbsp;

Probably
soon they'll ask her to do something really 

gross
and I hope she has the sense to say no. For that 

matter,
no girl even has to pose, but if you get asked 

nicely
by a friend it's hard to refuse. Satisfying 

curiosity
is a big part of Nude Day, and of course we 

girls
are curious, too. I'm sneaking in a few peeks 

myself
at the boys who bob by. I'm supposed to be 

protesting
the whole idea, but I have to admit that 

seeing
how May is affecting the boys clustered around 

her
excites me. 

&nbsp;

What
would I do if they asked me? I'm getting some 

pretty
interested looks from some of them. I'll bet if 

Bill
wasn't holding my hand someone would ask me to be 

naughty.
I might even say yes.

&nbsp;

My
first class is English. Bill and I take adjoining 

seats.
He silently points out that the desk is covering 

up my
lower parts and makes a comically sad face, so I 

flash
him. Mrs. Dawkins starts out droning on about 

British
Lit, but we're too busy looking around to 

listen.
Then her mouth quirks up and she picks up a 

book
and starts reading to us. It's her little joke, 

because
it's &quot;Lady Chatterley's Lover&quot;, by D.H. 

Lawrence,
and of course the whole class is nude.

&nbsp;

We can
hardly believe what she's reading, how exciting 

it is,
and yet how beautiful. After a while she puts 

the
book down and starts talking about something called 

&quot;personification
of the penis&quot;. And I haven't passed a 

note
in years, but I get this wicked idea and I 

scribble
something and hand it to Bill. And he writes 

something
and hands it back.

&nbsp;

WHAT'S
ITS NAME?

&nbsp;

DICK.

&nbsp;

Which
is pretty bad, but so bad it's funny. And then I 

get a
little bolder.

&nbsp;

DOES
DICK LIKE TO BE PETTED?

&nbsp;

And
back it comes.

&nbsp;

SOMETIMES,
AND SOMETIMES NOT. IT COMES IN SPURTS.

&nbsp;

I have
to put my head down on the desk. Bill can see my 

shoulders
shaking. I've liked him right from the first. 

Now I
realize I've underestimated him. He's funny, lots 

of
boys are, but how many can make jokes about their 

own
penis? That's really cool. I think about what it 

must
be like for him to be attending his very last day 

of
high school. Is he sad? Anxious to get on with the 

rest
of his life? And what does he want with me? 

&nbsp;

Probably
he wants to do it, all boys do, but when I 

told
him I can't he didn't split. Does he think I'll 

change
my mind? What about that constant mysterious 

smile?
Is he really cool enough to enjoy just looking 

at me
without losing control? What did he get girls to 

do
with him on his other three Nude Days? Is he using 

me?
Because of his gentle ways, I feel safe with him. 

But he
must have a plan. I remember what I saw when he 

first
turned around from the lockers, and I shiver.

&nbsp;

By
lunchtime I'm pretty hungry. Bill and I sit 

together,
trying to ignore the girl spread out on a 

table
under the window. I feel sorry for her. She 

doesn't
have to do that to be popular. All next year 

the
boys will remember, remind her what she did, want a 

repeat.
After a while one of the teachers walks over 

and
disperses the boys and gets her up, but the damage 

to her
rep is done.

&nbsp;

The
best part of lunch is talking to Bill. I'm still 

pretty
shy, but he's being polite with his eyes. I am 

trying
in an indirect way to find out what his plans 

are
for me the rest of the day. And if he likes me.

&nbsp;

&quot;What
does this day mean to you?&quot; I ask

&nbsp;

&quot;A
lot. Certain days you never forget. My first Nude 

Day,
my first driver's license, a special birthday...I 

want
my last day of high school to be a perfect day, a 

day I
will remember for the rest of my life.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;But
isn't there a girlfriend, to, um...help make it 

memorable?&quot;
I flick a look downward.

&nbsp;

&quot;Not
at present. But if you'll go with me to the gym, 

I'll
call in that second favor and make this day 

memorable
for both of us.&quot;

&nbsp;

I
should have guessed. I knew about the gym being 

partitioned
off, but never thought about it in relation 

to
myself. It's mostly for upperclassmen. I am scared 

but
excited, too. I trust Bill, I owe him that favor, 

and I
nod.

&nbsp;

The
light bamboo screens do nothing to muffle sound, so 

it's
pretty obvious which cubicles are in use. We 

finally
find an empty one near the center of the gym. 

The
bare mattress lying on the floor inside is 

shockingly
unromantic. Beside it is a short stack of 

disposable
pads, a box of tissues, and a wastebasket 

full
of stuff I don't want to look at or even imagine. 

I'm already
scared and half ready to leave, but I did 

agree
to come. And I'm in his arms.

&nbsp;

He
bends down to kiss me, drawing me to him with his 

hands
cupped on my bare rear, my breasts light against 

his
stomach, his penis teasingly hard against me. His 

lips
are soft and warm and again I feel his signature 

gentleness.
The kiss goes on and on, obviously Bill's 

in no
hurry, but I keep worrying about his next move. 

&nbsp;

Will
he put his tongue in my mouth, will his hands 

roam?
Nothing happens and the tension builds. And then 

suddenly
his right leg gracefully slides between mine 

and I
can feel the muscles of his thigh pressing 

against
me and his hands on my fanny are pulling me 

into
him and now they are raising and lowering me 

slightly,
rubbing me against him. I groan softly. I 

blush
to think someone in the next cubicle might be 

listening.

&nbsp;

But
then from that same cubicle there comes an odd 

sound,
a muffled bump-thump, repeated over and over in 

increasing
tempo. And a girl's inarticulate voice is 

calling
out, her cry at first a soft ah.....ah...ah, 

with a
gasp for breath in between, but then as the 

thumping
speeds up her cries fuse and rise in pitch in 

a
continuous ululation which ends abruptly in a 

glorious
full-throated howl of joyous release.

&nbsp;

The
gym has fallen silent. By the time her voice stills 

everybody
has been listening. There are a few coarse 

male
cheers of approval and a little clapping, followed 

by
shushing sounds from the girls. There is a brief 

moment
of silence. But the match has been lit. In 

scattered
cubicles hands fondle, mouths engage, bodies 

intertwine,
and throats rejoice in the unmistakable 

sounds
of lovemaking. 

&nbsp;

In a
chain reaction, more couples, spurred on by the 

passionate
moans of their neighbors, join in, adding in 

turn
their cries to the din. The incendiary uproar 

sweeps
more and more before it. The entire gym is on 

fire. 

&nbsp;

Bill's
strong leg still presses against me but now he 

is
lifting me up and down faster. His lips are still on 

mine.
There are cries from every cell. Are we the only 

couple
not doing it? My judgment flees. I tear away 

from
him and I throw myself on my back on the mattress 

and I
open my legs. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Do
me.&quot;

&nbsp;

I want
to feel his body cover me. I want to feel him go 

in all
the way in a single thrust. But, even as wet as 

I am,
maybe that's not possible because it's my first 

time.
Maybe he'll have to ram it in, jam it in, and 

cram
it in, maybe it will hurt, no matter. I want him 

bad, I
want him hard, I want him swift, I want him now.

&nbsp;

But he
does not cover me. Instead, I feel his hands 

briefly
resting on my hips and now they are sliding 

down
and inward and he is opening me up, exposing my 

last
pink secrets, seeing what no boy has seen before, 

touching
me softly. I should be blushing but I'm way 

beyond
that.

&nbsp;

And
now he is bending down and his mouth is over my 

clitoris,
oh my, is he really, and yes he is, forming a 

seal
with his mouth against me with a little soft 

suction,
bringing it up against his tongue. And now it 

is all
soft and wet and warm, his tongue slides against 

me,
and my moans join with all the others. Soon soft 

and
wet aren't enough. I want it hard and fast and I 

grab
the back of his head and press him against me and 

I buck
against him. And then it gets even better.

&nbsp;

Because
now he slips his index finger inside me, 

curling
it just a bit and pressing against the wall and 

I now
I can feel his tongue on my clitoris and his 

finger
on its root, and I give one last orgasmic heave 

and I
come hard. And I can't help myself; my groan of 

pleasure
is so loud it stands out even in the uproar.

&nbsp;

I fall
back, totally relaxed, eyes closed. I've come 

before,
of course, in bed or under the shower. This is 

indescribably
better.

&nbsp;

I feel
so good I'd like to lie here forever, but now I 

can
feel Bill on his knees straddling my torso and I 

open
my eyes and I see Dick poking at my chin and I 

know
it's time. And I don't really know what I'm doing 

but I
take it in my hand by the root and I kiss all 

around
the tip until he gasps, and I take the tip in my 

mouth
and I run my tongue around it a couple of times 

until
I'm ready to take it in deeper, but it's too 

late.
I can feel the shaft spasm where I hold it, and 

now
he's spurting into my mouth. 

&nbsp;

He
jerks out and pulls sharply downward, still 

shooting,
trying to save my face. I put my hand down protectively so none of it goes
lower than my navel. Finally he stops and collapses beside me while I search
out the tissues with my other hand and start 

mopping
up. And then for a good long time we just lie 

together
wordlessly. We pretend we are both way too 

cool
to talk about what we just did.

&nbsp;

Others
want to use our cubicle; you can hear their 

restless
feet, God, were they listening to us? We get 

up and
change the pad. Bill apologises for the mess and 

says
we both could use a shower. The locker rooms are 

unisex
on Nude Day, so we go together.

&nbsp;

Fortunately
we are alone in what is usually the girl's 

shower
room. We take adjoining stalls and tend to 

ourselves.
I'm still feeling afterglow and my soapy 

hands
make me feel good. Bill turns off his spray and 

so do
I. He pops around the corner. I don't see how he 

could
still be interested but he's looking at me 

frankly.
After all we've been through I'm still shy and 

without
thinking I cover myself. He starts laughing.

&nbsp;

&quot;I
see we need to make you decent.&quot;

&nbsp;

He
turns my shower on low and takes the soap in his 

hands
and works up a good lather. He plops a big blob 

of
soapy foam around each of my nipples. Solely in the 

interest
of scientific accuracy, I point out that 

something
pink and tight is still visibly pointing 

through.
Another application is required. Now I look 

like
one of those bubble bath ladies in an old movie. 

&nbsp;

The
first blob between my legs is likewise 

insufficient.
We can see light brown hairs floating in 

the
foam around my partially visible slit. Another glop 

completes
the job. We admire it. We laugh at our 

silliness.
There is something particularly sexy about 

the
transience of soap bubbles. Bill isn't about to 

wait
for them to pop.

&nbsp;

&quot;I
think I like you better the other way.&quot;

&nbsp;

He
turns on the shower full force and in a flash I'm 

back
to where I was, but now I'm not covering myself. 

And
he's pushing me back against the shower wall and 

his
smooth soapy fingers are sliding between my pussy 

lips.
I can't believe that I want this again so soon, 

but I
do. Bill obviously knows a lot, but this time his 

fingers
are just slightly off center. I guide him 

upwards
just a tad and then I'm flying. When I come 

this
time, it is softer and less urgent. 

&nbsp;

Now
the shower is off and we are embracing, which is 

good
because I need help standing. After I recover a 

bit I
offer to towel him dry. It is pleasant to feel 

his
strong muscles under the towel. Soon there is only 

one
area left.

&nbsp;

&quot;May
I?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Certainly.&quot;

&nbsp;

I am
curious. After he is dry I get real close to take 

a good
look. My face is only inches from the cute tiny 

slit
at the tip. I think from the little I know he must 

be
circumcised. I lift it up to see its underside and I 

see
his scrotum, stretched soft by the heat. I gently 

hold
his balls in the palm of my hand. I'd like to look 

longer,
but I don't want him to think I'm pervy or 

something.
By the time I'm done he's only a little bit 

bigger.

&nbsp;

&quot;In
case you're wondering, there's a latency period,&quot; 

he
says.

&nbsp;

I know
that word from the sex study module in biology 

class.

&nbsp;

&quot;How
long?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Theoretically
not too long, but overall I think I'm 

done
for the day.&quot;

&nbsp;

I'm
not sure if he's referring to his physical state or 

if
he's dismissing me. Maybe I didn't do it right. 

Maybe
he came so fast he feels cheated. 

&nbsp;

Now he
begins to towel me off, leaving the best for 

last.
He is very assiduous. Not a single crevice is 

left
unblotted, yet moisture keeps welling up. When he 

is
done I still have trouble standing, so we go into 

the
locker room and sit down.

&nbsp;

Crazy
things are going through my head. Sex feels good 

when
you're doing it and afterward too. What if I did 

it
every day, would it still be as good? I thank him 

until
he's restless. I want him to hold me in his arms, 

I want
to smell his sweet skin, I want to be with him 

forever,
I want to tell him I love him. I say none of 

this.
But I must know one thing.

&nbsp;

&quot;When
we were in the gym, I asked you to do it, I mean 

I
really wanted you to, but you didn't?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I
didn't because you would have cried afterwards. And 

that
would have spoiled my perfect day.&quot;

&nbsp;

I cry
anyway. Bill is right, of course. He knew what my 

body
was telling me there in the gym, but understood 

that I
wasn't thinking straight... And he was kind 

enough
not to take advantage of me when I was 

vulnerable.
But when I look at his sweet smiling face I 

think
maybe I really am ready. Now that it's too late.

&nbsp;

After
awhile it seems there is nothing better to do 

than
go to our afternoon classes. What they are all 

about
I have no idea. We only have eyes for each other.

&nbsp;

I have
a sense of unease that by mid-afternoon becomes 

acute.
I still don't know his plans for the summer, and 

I'm
afraid to come right out and ask him if they 

include
me. Boys seem able to get their fun and move 

on. Is
it really possible I might never see him again? 

I
ache.

&nbsp;

After
the last class is over he still hasn't said 

anything.
We are walking past the school office towards 

the
main entrance. Nude Day is officially over, and we 

are
about to join the other students getting dressed 

outside.
Bill excuses himself to go to the men's room. 

I'm
desperate.

&nbsp;

When
he comes out, I am sitting on the bench outside 

the
office, filling out a form I just picked up.

&nbsp;

&quot;Cassie,
wassup?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;This
is an application for an Exploratorium spot. The 

next
available opening is on Wednesday at noon. Can you 

make
it?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;You
know what this means?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes,
very much.&quot;

&nbsp;

Bill
hesitates before speaking.

&nbsp;

&quot;When
we were in the gym, it wasn't easy for me to 

resist.
I'm glad I did, and I told you why. But if we 

go to
the Ex, it's going to happen. We both know that. 

I
don't think we can make a good decision today. So 

let's
fill out the application, see each other over the 

next
few days, and decide then. If you change your 

mind,
we just don't show up at the Ex, no hard 

feelings.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Agreed.&quot;
I giggle at the word 'hard'. His latency is 

clearly
over. I have no intention of changing my mind, 

but
it's sweet for him to give me the chance.

&nbsp;

Outside,
we dress each other tenderly. There are 

certain
indications he is thinking about Wednesday. I 

grin
as I make sure he is in the up position under his 

tight
white briefs. I pat him goodbye.

&nbsp;

&quot;Cassie,
thank you. This has been a perfect day.&quot;

&nbsp;

I am
crying too much to answer. But on Wednesday, when 

we
have made love, and I lie in his arms, skin to skin, 

flesh
to flesh, bone to bone, I will say the same.
