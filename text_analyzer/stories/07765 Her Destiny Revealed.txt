BOUND TO HER DESTINY

I


She knew this day would come. In meeting him, what had only been considered a dark fantasy to be lived out within the confines of her mind had been made a reality. Having her feet placed upon a path never thought possible, the unimaginable had happened.
For a long while she had known she was different from those around her. Her wants and needs being of a nature that many would not understand, they had been kept locked up inside her self. Only in her mind had they been made real. Kept from the purview of others she had learned to keep that part of her secret. 
Only in meeting him had that all changed. That their paths had crossed only served to further confirm the belief as to where her destiny lay. Taking her in hand, her world had been changed forever. What had been thought impossible was made real. Embarking on a journey of self discovery, that path had brought her here. Tonight that destiny which had been secretly desired for so long would finally be realized. She would become what she was meant to be. That it would occur here was something never imagined. In many respects, it was here where it truly all began. To be back here now, kneeling naked in anticipation of embracing her rightful future was something she would never have predicted.
She had come so far since first meeting him here. For most of her life in not completely understanding her own thoughts and feelings, in not believing them to be possible she&#8217;d avoided having her mind plagued by turmoil. Her naivety had kept her safe from such distress. Here it had all changed. What had been believed impossible was revealed not to be so. What had always been considered the realm of wistful fantasy was proven otherwise. 
What had happened earlier tonight at her apartment building was evidence enough of that. To have even contemplated such a thing a few months ago would have been inconceivable. He had changed all of that.
�You know where you belong and it isn&#8217;t in front of a keyboard and monitor in some office.�
Instinctively she knew he was right even if it was disconcerting to have someone she&#8217;d only just met understand her on such an intimate level. He had brought her to this small private club located in an upscale part of the city. That she would return to the same place with him was never imagined. Had he told her that first afternoon that in the space of a number of weeks she&#8217;d be here once more only stripped of all clothing and on her knees waiting to greet her future she might have considered him insane. Adjusting her position slightly on the hard floor while ensuring her legs remained properly parted, she was reminded how wrong that judgement would have been. She had but one single destiny she just hadn&#8217;t known it then.
Listening to him that first day, she found herself nodding her head in agreement as he spoke of the wants and desires she&#8217;d barely been able to admit to herself. The need to give of one&#8217;s self, to serve another no matter how base the demands might be. Ideas that had been with her for years, but sitting with him and hearing them put into words, a whole new world had been revealed. Deep down knowing he was right, all that he talked about was what she had been desiring for so long. Then it happened, no longer the subject of just conversation, the words were made real. The framed photograph of herself sitting on the table in her living room being an enduring testimony to that day when her life was changed forever.
On that day the smiling woman in the photograph had been filled with doubts and questions. It was as if she had been a stranger to herself for a large part of her life. Feeling out of step with those around her, her heart and soul being drawn in another direction and it was one that was more than a bit intimidating. That attraction had been kept locked away. To admit to it was impossible. Proper young ladies didn&#8217;t think such thoughts. To wish to be treated in such a manner, no, so many times she had corrected herself, to need to be treated in such a manner, to be ordered and to obey, it was like a flickering flame that could not be extinguished. To crave such things was something not done. To simply banish those wants from her mind though had proven impossible. It was something he had recognized when they had first met. 
Arriving at the private club on that fateful day they had shared a leisurely lunch. The warmth of the day allowing them to dine at one of the outside tables. That in him selecting such a table, they would be away from possible overhearing ears had been an erroneous assumption. Believing had others been able to hear, surely they would have wondered about what was being discussed, returning here tonight she knew that concern had been completely unfounded. Those other diners that afternoon would have viewed their conversation as a natural course of affairs. They might have been having similar discussions themselves.
�You are unique in your desires. Your needs are different from many others. That doesn&#8217;t make them wrong. It simply means that having other wants and desires, it is natural for you to feel as you do.�
His words being most unexpected, she was caught off guard by his statements. That their lunch conversation would begin in such a way was never anticipated. Finding herself speechless she had simply nodded her head in agreement as he resumed talking.
�In submitting to another you feel you will find fulfillment. You find joy in obedience, in the prospect of giving yourself to another completely and without reservation.�
Calling her a submissive, it was the first time she had ever heard such a term. It would not be the last. 
Barely aware of her food, the time had flown by as she listened to everything he said. To deny any of what was being heard was impossible and he knew it. Although she had hardly been able to remember taking a bite, the meal had concluded and they had departed the club. Not knowing it, they were strolling in the direction of his home. It was only when beginning to make their way along the sidewalk that she had noticed the camera. Thinking nothing of it, she had fallen into step beside him. With the skirt she had selected to wear ending above her knees, the warmth of the sun had felt good on her bare legs. 
After walking a couple of blocks he had guided her across the street to the entrance of a park. Entering it and having walked a couple of hundred yards into its heart she had sensed the slowing of his pace. This part of the city being an area that she rarely visited, the park was totally new to her. Aware of them having strolled to a secluded part of it, seeing him stop she too had halted.
�I am going to take your photograph so that it will be a constant reminder of the day your life was forever changed.�
Confused by his words, that lack of understanding must have clearly shown on her face.
�Beginning today you will start to truly learn what it is to be a submissive.�
As if instilled by a volition that was not her own making she had quietly replied. �Yes Sir.� 
Hearing him resume speaking, it was as if she was watching someone else while following his every direction. 
Made to raise her skirt, she had given a quick look around to see if anyone was near. Even while doing so, her hands were grasping at the hemline and slowly drawing it up over her hips. The idea of voicing a protest that they might be caught not ever entering her mind. He had nodded appreciatively seeing the lacy panties she was wearing.&nbsp; Ordered to remove them, again her eyes had darted about as her thumbs hooked the waistband and began pulling them down. Stepping out of them and holding them in her hand, not sure what to do, the unspoken question was answered as he took them and they disappeared from sight into his sports coat pocket. 
Not being allowed to lower her skirt he&#8217;d made her sit. Despite the warmth of the day, the grass had felt cool against her bare bottom. Arranging her skirt so that while it showed almost the entire length of her long legs, she had been posed in such a way that in giving the picture a quick glance one might not notice the state of her undress. Even after closer inspection one might still be left with a lingering doubt if what seemed to be truly was.
Next she was made to partially unbutton her blouse. With the top two already undone, releasing the next two ensured that her bra encased breasts were almost totally revealed. The bra being of a design made to unclasp at the front, being ordered to unhook it, she had again looked around, for the first time being nervously apprehensive at possibly being seen by others, her fingers were still already moving in obedience to his direction. Undoing it, the lacy material had fallen free from around her breasts so as to be no longer be visible. Being daringly revealed, while the blouse did conceal her now erect nipples, the inner curve of each breast was clearly revealed to the maximum extent possible.&nbsp; 
With the picture taken, not being allowed to re-button the blouse, they had continued on to his house. With each step, she had been reminded of her state of undress feeling the cool air against her bare buttocks and her breasts being free beneath her top. Arriving at his home, with the closing front door, the life she had been leading until that time was left behind. Being led to the living room and ordered to kneel before him, she had begun to learn about her desire to submit.
He had opened a world to her that had never truly been imagined. Having always kept that desire hidden it was now allowed to be experienced in its every facet. Behind that closed door she became accepting of her true nature, her obedience to any command had become instinctive. In being ordered to kneel before him, she had come to understand her place was on the floor by his feet. It was from there she had learned many things and come to understand herself in a whole new light. 
That education beginning the first afternoon, it being an extension of what had begun in the park. Her body was no longer hers to control. Ordered to remove what few items of clothing she was still wearing, not being allowed to stand, quickly stripping off the blouse, she had then to balance herself while slightly raising each knee so as to slip off the skirt.
For the next two weeks he had kept her naked. Even when receiving visitors at the house, it has been required that she be unclothed by his feet in the foyer to greet whoever might be arriving. If called upon to serve drinks to those visiting, that too was done naked, her body sometimes receiving appraising caresses as she carried out that task.
To be used at anytime for sexual pleasure, no part of her body being denied the intrusion of his erect manhood. Whether they were alone, or when given to others, to obey and please them as she would him, her submission found no limit that was not transcended. 
When during those early days, when she had failed to please or been slow to obey, she had felt the biting caress of leather as punishment. In being ordered to lay across the upholstered ottoman and present her upturned bottom, she willingly received what the smooth curves of her buttocks were accorded in being flogged until they were a vivid scarlet. Much to her surprise, another unanticipated lesson being learned, even when not done in punishment she found herself coming to desire such treatment, to have the effects of the crop or flogger linger so as to be a continuing reminder of her new found place in life.
In coming to find that place, more had been learned more about herself than she would have ever imagined. The life she&#8217;d led up to that time had become meaningless. She was no longer the same person as when she had met this man. In him opening the doors to many unanticipated discoveries about herself, never had her lips voiced any refusal.
With time of her tutelage under his control soon coming to an end, in having found the capacity to give totally and completely without reservation, simple submission was no longer enough. Kneeling before him naked one evening, her bottom raised in the air as she was bent forward resting on her breasts and shoulders with her arms extended ahead of her, she&#8217;d humbly begged to be sold as a slave. Desiring to be considered nothing beyond being the property of another, their pleasure her only concern, the right of refusal forever denied, only in slavery would complete fulfillment be found. 

II

Two nights ago he&#8217;d called her apartment. As always his instructions had been succinct. She would ready herself for his arrival so as to be taken out. Providing only a time for when he would be there, he had promptly hung up. Giving no indication as to where they might be going, to ask was unthinkable, to be prepared for him at the stated arrival time was all that was important. That he would be at her apartment Friday evening at 6 pm was all she needed to know.
With Friday&#8217;s arrival, she had been eyeing the clock all day in anticipation of being ready at the ordered time. When it began nudging 5:30 she had begun her preparations. It was more than enough time. She had only to shower and apply the small bit of make up she always wore, her natural beauty allowing her to only need the minimum in the way of cosmetics. Her skin possessing a slight olive tone, with her long shoulder length black hair and dark eyes she was often mistaken for possessing a Spanish heritage. Beyond her personal grooming, the rest took no time at all but that didn&#8217;t lessen its importance.
Anytime when he was expected at the apartment she was required to be naked, the only items she was allowed being her black leather collar, wrist and ankle cuffs and a pair of the four inch stiletto heeled shoes from her collection. Thusly arrayed, she would&nbsp; take her place on the floor in the entryway to the living room. There she would kneel and lean forward until she rested on her shoulders with her arms extended in front of her. The position never failing to remind her of the request she had made of him. With her upturned bottom presented, her knees spaced apart and her forehead touching the floor she would await his arrival.
Hearing him enter the apartment she would remain silent, her nude body openly presented and available to be enjoyed as he so decided. Whether he chose to spill his passion in her mouth, either of her two intimate passages or her bottom received a flogging with the riding crop that he kept at the apartment for just that purpose, only when he was finished and he bid her to rise would she move from that position. If they were going out, it would be then she would seek permission to be allowed to dress.
Tonight had been no different except for one big change. Positioned on the floor as she always was, upon his arrival he had stepped towards where she was kneeling. Saying nothing in the way of greeting, he had remained silent for what had seemed several minutes while standing over her. Had he been debating how to make use of her, what form of pleasure he might avail himself of? Finally he had ordered her to stand. Moving to her feet, once standing she had remained still, her arms hanging at her side. He had then slowly begun to circle her. She was accustom to being inspected. There was no part of her body she would not freely present when ordered to. Once he was behind her he had paused.
�Put your wrists behind your back.�
�Yes Sir.� 
Quickly complying, moving them behind her he had taken them in his hands. Hearing a metallic click she knew the two heavy D rings that were embedded in the leather had been locked together.
�Now, open your mouth.�
�Yes Sir�
Not closing it after finishing speaking, after a brief moment, seeing his hands coming up around her head she felt her mouth being filled by the ball gag that he had used from time to time on her. Feeling the strap being tightened to secure it in place she had begun wondering what change had occurred to his voiced plan of them going out. With her jaws stretched open to accommodate the red ball, to ask would have been impossible even if such a query had been permissible. 
With the gag firmly secured he had returned to stand in front of her. Slipping a hand into his suit jacket pocket, it emerged holding the silver chain lead that he was accustom to attaching to the heavy steel ring at the front of her collar. Seeing it she had automatically raised her chin so as to present the ring more openly to his hand. Feeling it being snapped into place a small wave of pleasure had washed over her as it always did in realization of being once again bound to his hand.
It was then that the evening changed as it had never done before.
�Come slave.�
Falling into step behind him, seeing him leading her towards the apartment door her eyes had widened. Surely he couldn&#8217;t be planning to�� What if they were seen.??? What would her neighbours think seeing her neck, wrists and ankles encased in black leather and being led by a length of silver chain. Living on the twentieth floor, the only way out of the building besides the stairwell was the elevator and she was already sure he had no intention of walking down that many flights of stairs.
Seeing his hand reaching to grasp the doorknob it had seemed surreal. It couldn&#8217;t possibly be happening. Feeling a tug at the collar as he gave the lead a small pull, before she knew it she was in the corridor. Giving a quick look around, she had breathed a small sigh of relief at seeing it empty. Continuing to follow as he began making is way towards the elevator, she had been swept by an odd sense of excitement striding along the hallway. Already she was aware of a slight wetness between her legs.
Stopping in front of the elevator her eyes had remained fixed on the lighted numbers above the doors. What if someone got on at another floor? To have to make the trip down while sharing the elevator with a stranger???&nbsp; All of the possibilities began playing themselves out in her mind. Finally the car arrived. Bracing herself as the doors opened, again she had been able to relax seeing it empty.
Seeing him press the button to the lower parking level she was happy to see that he had no intention of parading her through the building lobby. Rarely was there not at least one person there. Arriving in the parking area, seeing his car a short distance away she had again been glad there had been no need to walk any great distance. 
Crossing the concrete floor, the sound of her heels echoing hollowly around her for some strange reason had reinforced her sense of nakedness and vulnerability. Arriving beside the car he had paused before unlocking the door.
�Spread your legs�
Unable to reply, she had opened herself to him. Feeling his hand slide between them, a small moan escaped around the ball gag as his fingers explored her intimate slit. 
�Mmmmm. The slave is wet. She enjoyed that I see.�
Taking his hand from between her legs he had turned and opened the car door. To deny her wetness was impossible. Had she truly enjoyed it? Had she just learned another lesson about herself? 
The drive had been brief. In passing the now dark park she was again reminded of the photograph in her apartment and the day when everything changed. Seeing him pull up in front of the club where they had dined that day, while admitting that she had no idea where he might have been taking her, to be stopping here, the place where it all had begun, was something she never would have guessed. As if able to read her thoughts he spoke.
�It is here where your wish will be granted. It is here you will be sold into slavery, to become the property of another, to whom all obedience will be absolute.�
Hearing his words, her heart raced, the anticipation of what was about to happen had done nothing to lessen the stirrings being felt between her legs. With her wrists secured behind her, needing to wait for him to open the car door, she had quickly scanned the street. Grateful for the darkness of the evening, while the street was not a busy one, it was not completely deserted. Guessing the front door of the club to be about thirty feet away, she figured she would not be visible on the street for more than a few moments. 
With the door being opened and stepping from the vehicle, the evening air feeling cool against her naked body, approaching the entrance of the club, he had suddenly changed direction as she found herself being led towards a darkened alley. How eerily strange it felt being naked in such a place. The night sounds of the city had only strengthened the sensation of being so openly vulnerable.
Entering through a side entrance, she had been immediately aware of the sounds of subdued conversation. Were they all here for her? That she would soon be calling the owner of one of those voices Master had not been overlooked. Being led along a narrow hallway, entering a dimly lit room and seeing the raised dais, she knew it would happen here. Feeling a light tug of the lead, being guided towards the raised platform, the auction block upon which she would be sold into slavery, now seeing where it would take place, it all seemed surreal. 
�On your knees slave and prepare to greet your destiny. Make sure your legs are properly opened.�
�Y,y,yes Sir.�
Moving to position herself in the centre of the dais, while ensuring her knees were correctly separated, his hand was moving to detach the lead from the D ring. With it returned to his pocket,&nbsp; his fingers began unbuckling the collar. With it removed, moving to each of her wrists and ankles, the process was repeated.
�The slave will greet her new owner free of such adornments. It shall be their collar and cuffs that the slave shall proudly wear from now on.�
�Yes Sir. This slave shall humbly wear the symbols of enslavement that her Master might choose.�
With those few words, watching him leave the room, she was left alone with her thoughts. Would he be one of the bidders? Would it be he she would humbly crawl to on hands and knees to offer up her now naked neck and feel his collar once more? 
Now alone, her eyes were drawn to the closed double doors that were in front of her. The small gap between them admitting what little light illuminated where she was kneeling. From the other side of the two doors, the subdued sound of conversation could still be heard. Unable to hear specific words so as to know what was said, that in some way would be involving her she had little doubt. It was why they had gathered. To view what was being offered up for sale, to judge her in relation to their own tastes, wants and desires, that all of them had been spoken to, her potential value as a slave discussed, it would be here that their own eyes would compare what they had been told with what they would see displayed kneeling before them. It would be then that bidding would commence and in it ending, her enslavement to another would begin. Seeing the doors beginning to swing open, she knew she could now only wait for her destiny to unfold.
