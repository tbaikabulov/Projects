Anne's story

Synopsis:     Anne has to deal with home life and a new boy at school.






 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne always walked to school alone. When she decided to eat lunch, she sat by herself, but most days she buried her nose in a book, in a nook, tucked away in some forgotten corner of the library. When someone asked her if they could borrow a chair from her table, she gave them a genuine smile and nodded her head, but she never invited the person to sit with her, nor did she start up a conversation. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When the last bell rang for the day, she was usually among the first out of the building, walking in a hurried pace to get home. Once she was home, she would cook dinner for her and her cousin and then finish her homework. At six p.m. everyday her cousin would sit down to dinner with her. He hardly ever looked at her while they ate. In fact, he hardly ever looked at her regardless of their surroundings. Anne knew he didn&#8217;t want her there. She knew he looked at her as one more thing to worry about and take responsibility for. Moreover, she was the reason why neither of them were living with their parents. Lately, his moods had been growing fouler with the passing weeks. Winter was setting in and the snow was starting to fall. The sky was perpetually grey. Maybe he was going through the winter blues. Yet, Anne felt that there was something more brewing behind his demeanor. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Today had been an uncharacteristically warm day, though still grey. The students had been allowed to lunch outside. Anne decided to take advantage of the weather and sat outside, eating a sandwich while switching back and forth from her latest book to watching her fellow class mates. She caught a stray ball from one of the football players and threw it back to him. As she did this, she saw snow flurries fluttering down. People started groaning and whining. For some reason the snow caught her in a daze. She concentrated on it, watching individual flakes dropping down. She didn&#8217;t realize that one of the football players was trying to start a conversation with her. She didn&#8217;t realize still, that a tall young man was standing in front of her, until he spoke. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Hello.� He said. He made it sound almost like a command and it snapped her out of her daze. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Hi.� She said, forgetting her smile. He was very slight in stature. His face was pale and almost matched the snow that was sticking to the ground. His eyes were dark, but she thought she caught a glimpse of green light in them. His hair was black and went down to his chin. All his features were very angular and he reminded her of a picture she had seen in one of her books of an old Hungarian musician renowned both for his compositions as well as his performance. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before she could register it, he was sitting across from her, staring intently at her face. He looked a bit menacing as though he were leering at her and trying to study her all at the same time. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What&#8217;s your name?� he asked her. Again, he made it seem like a command, though it was only a question.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Anne.� For some reason she didn&#8217;t dare to ask his name.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m Peter. I&#8217;m new.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I see.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I just moved into West Evergreen Drive�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne thought that was peculiar. That was in the next town. Furthermore, there were two parts to West Evergreen Drive: the part that one could see, which made up some of the main road. There were no houses on this road. And the second part that one could not see, which was a long forgotten road buried somewhere in the woods.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Where on Evergreen? I&#8217;ve never seen any houses on that road.� She said defiantly. Maybe he didn&#8217;t understand the lay of the land just yet.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well, it&#8217;s in the woods. There aren&#8217;t many houses there. I&#8217;d like to show you after school.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I can&#8217;t. I have plans.� She said and got up to go inside without looking back. She knew it was rude, but she couldn&#8217;t be alone with a boy and frankly she had been caught off guard with his proposition. It was just an invite to his house. Maybe other people were going and she was just over reacting, but she found herself wishing that he hadn&#8217;t invited anyone else. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After school, she was once again walking briskly to her house. Part of it was that she wanted to get home and do her chores to distract herself from the random and frequent thoughts she was having of Peter since meeting him at lunch. The other part of it was that in thinking that the day would be nice and relishing the warm temperatures in the morning, Anne had worn a miniskirt and a jean jacket top as her outer layer. Now, she was shivering, and crossing her arms as she walked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A car pulled up beside her. It was a red pick up truck. It gave a playful honk at her and she saw that it was Peter. She would never have guessed that he drove a red pick-up, but there he was with his black hair and black leather jacket. It seemed like an anomaly. He was smiling at her, but his eyes had the same expression as before when they met for the first time and she didn&#8217;t know if she trusted him. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Anne, you look like you need a ride.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No thanks, I&#8217;m almost home.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I could use the company. I still get lost sometimes trying to get home and it looks like it&#8217;s going to get dark soon. I&#8217;ll tell you what, why don&#8217;t you keep me company and I&#8217;ll drive you back later? I really don&#8217;t want to be alone.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne sighed.&nbsp; �I really need to get home.� She said. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Please.� Again, it sounded like a command more than a plea, and this time it frightened Anne. She stumbled on the pavement and fell into some snow. In a flash Peter was by her side, helping her up and almost carrying her. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I think it would be safer for you and me if you got in the car.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No really, I&#8217;m fine.� She tried to pull away but that particular area was covered in black ice and Anne was slipping. She had platforms on which didn&#8217;t help her cause and she was trying not to flash any passers-by while trying to regain her balance. Before she knew it, she was sitting next to Peter in his pick-up, fastening her seat belt. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�So, what do you say? My house or yours?� Anne didn&#8217;t know whether she would have to invite him in if she opted for her own house. She was not allowed to have boys over. But then again, she wasn&#8217;t allowed to go over boys&#8217; houses. However, she saw her cousin getting angrier if the transgression were to take place in his own home. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yours, I guess.� She relented. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Peter must have been driving for a while because Anne woke up with her head pressed against the window of the pick-up. They were just arriving at what seemed like a large cabin. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You look well rested. Now you can stay up all night if you need to.� He laughed.
Anne thought the comment was a little left field, but didn&#8217;t think too much on it. She got out of the car and looked around. There were trees and leaves everywhere. Here, it still looked like late fall. You couldn&#8217;t really see the ground, because it was carpeted with leaves. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�This is where you live?� Anne asked Peter as he handed her a cup of hot cocoa. The steam from the cup was warming her face and the cup was doing a good job on her hands. Peter&#8217;s cup wasn&#8217;t emitting any steam which she found curious, but didn&#8217;t want to dwell on. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�This is where I live while I&#8217;m going to school. My family owns an apartment in the city and I go there from time to time as well.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I see. That&#8217;s convenient.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It is, but it&#8217;s already getting lonely out here.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yeah, well, it&#8217;s in the middle of nowhere.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne and Peter were both sitting on the bed, and they inched closer and closer with each sentence they spoke. There was the fireplace in the background and to top off the clich� there was a bear &#8211; skin rug at the foot of the bed. It wasn&#8217;t exactly what Anne had imagined when she saw Peter earlier at lunch, but she was sitting beside him now while he took the cup from her hand and placed it on the table next to the bed. He then took her face in his hands and kissed her deeply and passionately. It completely unleashed something in her she couldn&#8217;t remember ever feeling before. It was hunger, and it made her press her lips hard against his. She moved to straddle him, throwing her arms around his neck as he cradled her. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne felt something bite down on her lip and then she felt blood trickling down her chin. It came out of nowhere and she barely registered Peter licking the trail back up to her lips. But then it started throbbing, as though it were a pulse.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Ugh. I&#8217;m bleeding.� She said, pulling away.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What time is it anyway? I have to get home. My cousin will eat me alive if he knows I&#8217;ve been here with you all day.�&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;ll take you home.� said Peter. His voice was icy as though he were disappointed in her. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Thanks.� She murmured. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Neither of them said anything as they drove to her house. When she got out, he leaned over and kissed her forehead. �See you tomorrow.� He said and waved as he pulled out of the driveway. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne was in a state of elation that she could not describe. She went inside, noticing that her cousins shoes were on the shoe rack, indicating that he was already home. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Hello?� She called out and like clockwork, he appeared in the door way. Her cousin, Luke, was twenty four, eight years older than she was. He was crossing his right arm in front of his left and holding a glass of red wine. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Where were you?� He was fuming. She hadn&#8217;t expected his reaction to be so intense. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I was with a friend.� She reasoned.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Were you with a boy?� He asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You&#8217;re not allowed to see boys.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I know.� She said. In an instant he was in front of her, throwing his glass of wine in her face. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne was completely stupefied. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�If you knew that you weren&#8217;t allowed to see boys, why then, did you see a boy?� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m sorry.� Was all she could say. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�On top of that you didn&#8217;t make dinner. I had to cook for myself today, after working twelve hours. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Go upstairs and wait for me.� He threatened. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne gulped and did what he asked. She was terrified. She had always been terrified of him. They weren&#8217;t really cousins, but they grew up that way. He might as well have been. His parents were good family friends of hers and they had grown up near each other as babies. His parents were her god parents and vice versa. Since both were gone, he was in charge of her now since she did not have any other family. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne lay in bed thinking of what had just happened. When they were younger he always picked on her and played mean tricks on her. When they were kids he was still mean to her, purposefully forgetting to include her in activities during family vacations, cornering her out of the sight of their parents just to pinch her or pull her hair. As they grew older he stopped doing those things, but she still found him glaring at her from time to time. It all made her more on edge given what had just transpired. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The door opened to her bedroom and Luke marched in, slamming it shut. He paced back and forth, looking at her all the while. She sat up and crossed her legs, trying to sit up straight. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You know, I&#8217;ve been thinking,� he said finally, sitting down on the chair in front of Anne&#8217;s vanity table. �You&#8217;re not a little girl anymore.� He crossed his legs.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I guess I&#8217;m not.� said Anne, leaning back on her headboard. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I think you should start earning your keep here.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I forgot about cooking today. I&#8217;m really sorry.� Anne started, but Luke held up his hand. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No. I mean you&#8217;re a young woman now, and I have needs.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne looked scared, widening her eyes at him. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What do you mean?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m your guardian. You have to live with me until you turn eighteen.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That&#8217;s in two years.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Right. So until then, you&#8217;re all mine. You have to do what I say.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What do you want me to do?� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What do you think I want you to do?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne started shaking and crying. �No, please don&#8217;t do this.� She was speaking in a low frantic tone. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Anne, Anne, Anne. Shh. Think about it. You have no where to go. Even when you go to college, all the money is with me. See, even your parents didn&#8217;t trust you, so they left all the money to me. Sure, I have to use it according to their stipulations, which includes paying for your college, but, if you remember, they made it clear that you would get your college money only if I felt that your behavior merited my paying for your college.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�So you&#8217;ll only pay if I do what you say.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Exactly.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne hugged her knees and buried her face in them rocking back and forth, sobbing. She felt Luke&#8217;s hands trying to untangle her arms to which she started protesting. She tried to plead through her tears. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Luke, I&#8217;m sorry about today.�&nbsp; she sobbed. �Nothing like that will happen again. I promise.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He shook his head as if to say, nice try.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At this point Anne almost squealed as she backed up against her headboard, trying to inch away from Luke. �Please!� but he did not let up.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Don&#8217;t get any ideas. No one will believe you if you tell them. I have friends everywhere.� He emphasized the last word. Anne couldn&#8217;t tell if he was telling the truth or not, but even if he wasn&#8217;t what was she going to say? She would need a sample of his semen inside her and she saw him pulling out a condom as she thought this. Now she was panicking and it was hard for her to think clearly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She saw that it was futile to get out of this scenario. Luke did actually have friends at the police department, and they would just bring her back if she tried to run. Anne tried to appeal to him a last time. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Luke,� she whispered. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I know you&#8217;re angry, but could you please be gentle? I&#8217;ve never�I mean I��
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She trailed off. Luke was watching her. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Spread your legs.� He was emotionless. She was so scared that she complied quickly. He reached under her skirt and stroked her through her panties. It made her jump and yelp all together. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m sorry.� She murmured. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Luke rubbed harder and harder. Anne was silent, gripping the sheets, but there were tears streaming down her face and she was red. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Without warning Luke shoved the panty material to the side and jammed two fingers inside Anne. He started working them in and out vigorously. Anne was still quite dry and it was quit painful. She reached out and grabbed his arm, trying to push him away, but he did it harder. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Let go of my arm.� He told her sternly, so she did. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Lie down.� He said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�On my back?� she asked innocently. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She did as she was told and without being asked, she spread her legs. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He jammed his fingers inside her again, burying them this time. Sometimes he would find her clit and dig his nail into her. Other times he would just slap her pussy. She had started whimpering, not having the energy to do much else.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Had enough?� he finally asked her, pulling out his fingers from inside her. He put them in front of her face to show her. They were covered in blood and her fluid. He had broken her hymen. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne closed her eyes and rolled onto her side holding her stomach. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She felt Luke get up from her bed and shut off the light to her room.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Tomorrow, be home by six-thirty with dinner ready.�
The door clicked shut as he left as though he had just left after a conversation or something.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne couldn&#8217;t sleep. She was too afraid. But then exhaustion took over and she had no choice but to give in. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Outside her window, there was a tree and sitting on a branch of that tree was Peter. He had been watching her since she came upstairs. He had seen everything unfold. Part of him was enraged at what had just happened. Part of him was lustful and guilty. However, regardless of how he felt, he could not draw himself away from Anne and he knew he had to do something.









 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne always walked to school alone. When she decided to eat lunch, she sat by herself, but most days she buried her nose in a book, in a nook, tucked away in some forgotten corner of the library. When someone asked her if they could borrow a chair from her table, she gave them a genuine smile and nodded her head, but she never invited the person to sit with her, nor did she start up a conversation. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When the last bell rang for the day, she was usually among the first out of the building, walking in a hurried pace to get home.

It wasn&#8217;t exactly what Anne had imagined when she saw Peter earlier at lunch, but she was sitting beside him now while he took the cup from her hand and placed it on the table next to the bed. He then took her face in his hands and kissed her deeply and passionately. It completely unleashed something in her she couldn&#8217;t remember ever feeling before. It was hunger, and it made her press her lips hard against his. She moved to straddle him, throwing her arms around his neck as he cradled her. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne felt something bite down on her lip and then she felt blood trickling down her chin. It came out of nowhere and she barely registered Peter licking the trail back up to her lips. But then it started throbbing, as though it were a pulse.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Ugh. I&#8217;m bleeding.� She said, pulling away.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What time is it anyway? I have to get home. My cousin will eat me alive if he knows I&#8217;ve been here with you all day.�&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;ll take you home.� said Peter. His voice was icy as though he were disappointed in her. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Thanks.� She murmured. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Neither of them said anything as they drove to her house. When she got out, he leaned over and kissed her forehead. �See you tomorrow.� He said and waved as he pulled out of the driveway. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne was in a state of elation that she could not describe. She went inside, noticing that her cousins shoes were on the shoe rack, indicating that he was already home. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Hello?� She called out and like clockwork, he appeared in the door way. Her cousin, Luke, was twenty four, eight years older than she was. He was crossing his right arm in front of his left and holding a glass of red wine. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Where were you?� He was fuming. She hadn&#8217;t expected his reaction to be so intense. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I was with a friend.� She reasoned.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Were you with a boy?� He asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You&#8217;re not allowed to see boys.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I know.� She said. In an instant he was in front of her, throwing his glass of wine in her face. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne was completely stupefied. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�If you knew that you weren&#8217;t allowed to see boys, why then, did you see a boy?� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m sorry.� Was all she could say. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�On top of that you didn&#8217;t make dinner. I had to cook for myself today, after working twelve hours. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Go upstairs and wait for me.� He threatened. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne gulped and did what he asked. She was terrified. She had always been terrified of him. They weren&#8217;t really cousins, but they grew up that way. He might as well have been. His parents were good family friends of hers and they had grown up near each other as babies. His parents were her god parents and vice versa. Since both were gone, he was in charge of her now since she did not have any other family. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne lay in bed thinking of what had just happened. When they were younger he always picked on her and played mean tricks on her. When they were kids he was still mean to her, purposefully forgetting to include her in activities during family vacations, cornering her out of the sight of their parents just to pinch her or pull her hair. As they grew older he stopped doing those things, but she still found him glaring at her from time to time. It all made her more on edge given what had just transpired. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The door opened to her bedroom and Luke marched in, slamming it shut. He paced back and forth, looking at her all the while. She sat up and crossed her legs, trying to sit up straight. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You know, I&#8217;ve been thinking,� he said finally, sitting down on the chair in front of Anne&#8217;s vanity table. �You&#8217;re not a little girl anymore.� He crossed his legs.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I guess I&#8217;m not.� said Anne, leaning back on her headboard. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I think you should start earning your keep here.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I forgot about cooking today. I&#8217;m really sorry.� Anne started, but Luke held up his hand. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No. I mean you&#8217;re a young woman now, and I have needs.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne looked scared, widening her eyes at him. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What do you mean?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m your guardian. You have to live with me until you turn eighteen.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That&#8217;s in two years.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Right. So until then, you&#8217;re all mine. You have to do what I say.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What do you want me to do?� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What do you think I want you to do?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne started shaking and crying. �No, please don&#8217;t do this.� She was speaking in a low frantic tone. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Anne, Anne, Anne. Shh. Think about it. You have no where to go. Even when you go to college, all the money is with me. See, even your parents didn&#8217;t trust you, so they left all the money to me. Sure, I have to use it according to their stipulations, which includes paying for your college, but, if you remember, they made it clear that you would get your college money only if I felt that your behavior merited my paying for your college.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�So you&#8217;ll only pay if I do what you say.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Exactly.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne hugged her knees and buried her face in them rocking back and forth, sobbing. She felt Luke&#8217;s hands trying to untangle her arms to which she started protesting. She tried to plead through her tears. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Luke, I&#8217;m sorry about today.�&nbsp; she sobbed. �Nothing like that will happen again. I promise.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He shook his head as if to say, nice try.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At this point Anne almost squealed as she backed up against her headboard, trying to inch away from Luke. �Please!� but he did not let up.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Don&#8217;t get any ideas. No one will believe you if you tell them. I have friends everywhere.� He emphasized the last word. Anne couldn&#8217;t tell if he was telling the truth or not, but even if he wasn&#8217;t what was she going to say? She would need a sample of his semen inside her and she saw him pulling out a condom as she thought this. Now she was panicking and it was hard for her to think clearly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She saw that it was futile to get out of this scenario. Luke did actually have friends at the police department, and they would just bring her back if she tried to run. Anne tried to appeal to him a last time. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Luke,� she whispered. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I know you&#8217;re angry, but could you please be gentle? I&#8217;ve never�I mean I��
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She trailed off. Luke was watching her. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Spread your legs.� He was emotionless. She was so scared that she complied quickly. He reached under her skirt and stroked her through her panties. It made her jump and yelp all together. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m sorry.� She murmured. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Luke rubbed harder and harder. Anne was silent, gripping the sheets, but there were tears streaming down her face and she was red. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Without warning Luke shoved the panty material to the side and jammed two fingers inside Anne. He started working them in and out vigorously. Anne was still quite dry and it was quit painful. She reached out and grabbed his arm, trying to push him away, but he did it harder. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Let go of my arm.� He told her sternly, so she did. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Lie down.� He said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�On my back?� she asked innocently. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She did as she was told and without being asked, she spread her legs. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He jammed his fingers inside her again, burying them this time. Sometimes he would find her clit and dig his nail into her. Other times he would just slap her pussy. She had started whimpering, not having the energy to do much else.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Had enough?� he finally asked her, pulling out his fingers from inside her. He put them in front of her face to show her. They were covered in blood and her fluid. He had broken her hymen. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne closed her eyes and rolled onto her side holding her stomach. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She felt Luke get up from her bed and shut off the light to her room.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Tomorrow, be home by six-thirty with dinner ready.�
The door clicked shut as he left as though he had just left after a conversation or something.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne couldn&#8217;t sleep. She was too afraid. But then exhaustion took over and she had no choice but to give in. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Outside her window, there was a tree and sitting on a branch of that tree was Peter. He had been watching her since she came upstairs. He had seen everything unfold. Part of him was enraged at what had just happened. Part of him was lustful and guilty. However, regardless of how he felt, he could not draw himself away from Anne and he knew he had to do something.




































 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The next day school was let out early. The weather was acting odd again. Should someone happen to glance out their window without looking at their watch, they would have thought it was 6 p.m. when in truth it was merely noon. The winds were extremely rough and in the middle of this, snow had started falling. The weather channels were anticipating a blizzard. Both hardware and liquor stores were having sales. People were encouraged to stock up and go home early. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne had no idea whether Luke would be home. She was so afraid he would be waiting for her when she got home. Instead of walking home, Peter watched her walk to the school&#8217;s back yard and sit at one of the lunch table benches. She was mostly looking at the table and then looking around to see whether anyone was there. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Peter had tried to get a hold of her all day, but it seemed like Anne would duck into a bathroom or get lost in the crowd whenever he tried to approach her. He felt&nbsp; as though he could sense her rejection and fear from where he stood. But finally, he approached her while she was alone, seemingly facing internal agony. He didn&#8217;t know if he should tell her what he knew or how he knew. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Anne?� he asked gently. Anne looked up and froze in fear. She looked like she was about to cry. Peter still hadn&#8217;t thought about what to say next.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It&#8217;s one-thirty.� He said awkwardly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne gave him a faulty smile and her eyes seemed a bit amused.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It sure is,� she winked at him and looked away, again sad and worried. Peter couldn&#8217;t understand it.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Do you want a ride home?� For a moment Anne looked devastated, and then shook her head. He was sure that she was going to cry. Her eyes were glassy. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No, it&#8217;s ok, I&#8217;d rather walk. Honestly.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�The black ice is even worse today.� He said, �Judging from yesterday you might never make it home,� Peter laughed. He looked so jovial to Anne. He sat down across from her as he had done the day before. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That might not be so bad.� Anne whispered to herself.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Come on, it&#8217;s nowhere near your bed time. There&#8217;s no reason you can&#8217;t get a ride home in an ancient pick up truck from a really young fellow to a place that&#8217;s ten blocks away.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne sighed. She almost relented, but then wondered what would happen if Luke was home already. Her heart started thumping, which Peter noticed. He could almost hear it. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Will you let me off a block away from my house please?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�If that is what you want.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Then I will take that ride.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Peter actually drove to the parking lot of a nearby playground. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Thank you.� Anne said without looking up from her lap. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well, you&#8217;re quite welcome.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne looked out the window, and waited just a second more as if she wanted to say something. Deciding against it, she reached for the door.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Anne,� said Peter. She immediately dropped her hands and stared ahead nervously.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What&#8217;s the harm in looking at me?� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne turned her head. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What do you mean?� she asked, not really understanding where he was coming from. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You haven&#8217;t looked me in the eye since I found you sitting at the lunch table.� 
At this, Anne actually did start crying to Peter&#8217;s complete bewilderment. This time, he was in a daze and didn&#8217;t register her slipping out of the car and shutting the door, whispering a quick �I&#8217;m sorry,� before she almost ran away from his pick &#8211; up. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne could not explain it, but she felt guilty about what had happened to her yesterday though she knew there was no reason for her to. The fact was that last night might be every night for a very long while. The worst part was that while she had been with Peter yesterday afternoon, the thought had flashed in her mind that, in the future, she and Peter might, potentially, if he wanted to...but it was too late. She could never have that again with Peter or anyone else. It was Luke&#8217;s and Luke&#8217;s alone as though he and Anne had shared something, but really it was a lie. Anne stopped walking. She was still in the brush area near the playground half &#8211; way between where she left Peter and her house. She leaned on a tree, crossing her arms and found that she had been crying. The realization made her sob even harder until she was tired.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne could think of nothing to help her situation. Maybe she could bargain with Luke, though she had no bargaining chips. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She worried about it all the way home. She stood outside her door, her hand around the door knob. She took a deep breath and opened the door, walking inside. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Hello?� She said in a small voice.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No answer.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She looked for his shoes on the shoe rack, but the space that&nbsp; his shoes usually occupied was empty.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Realizing he wasn&#8217;t home, she sighed. She dropped her bag on the couch and headed for the kitchen to make dinner. It was only about 2:15, but she thought she had better prepare a feast. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�But then, what if he expects it everyday?� she thought aloud. She felt crazy talking to herself in an empty house. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Three hours later she was done cooking. In those three hours she wondered what she could do to convince him that this whole thing was insane or at least convince him to be more lenient. He wanted sex. She didn&#8217;t understand why he wanted it from her. Maybe it wasn&#8217;t about sex. Perhaps she could try to pacify him. She could maybe feign willingness, but how? Dress up? Play a part? She wasn&#8217;t quite sure. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne took a shower and went to her room. She looked for revealing clothing. Isn&#8217;t that what guys liked? She found an old Halloween costume of a French maid. She had no idea why she had picked it then. She had gone to the store with Luke and he had been looking at it. Anne guessed she had bought it to impress him in some way. She did have a strange attraction to him when she was younger though she didn&#8217;t know it at the time. Her parents had never even known about the costume. Everyone had been out of the house that Halloween at various parties. Luke still lived next door and he had promised her parents he would take her trick-or-treating though he actually took her to her first party with alcohol. In the end he hadn&#8217;t let her wear the outfit and she had ended up wearing her regular clothing as had he and he had protected her all night. He had even been nice to her. When she told him she was tired he had taken her home. It was the one and only time. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now, she was standing in front of her bed looking at the same costume. She had also pulled out a short plaid skirt and a white button down as well as a pink corset, black panty hose, with a pink lacy garter belt and black/pink lacy panties. No one had seen this except her. She had bought it once on a whim because it had seemed so pretty to her. Now it seemed the tiniest bit trashy. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She deliberated for a while and decided to go with the corset outfit. She didn&#8217;t want Luke to think she was turning into his maid or that she approved of the pervert that he was, and though the corset was over the top, she wanted him to know that she was willing to please him. Her goal was to make him think that she would enjoy his advances and he would have no need to be as unrelenting and rough as he had been the night before.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The corset was snug and accentuated her breasts, so far so good. Anne was afraid the panties sat too low on her hips and wished she had picked a different pair at the store. When she turned around, a portion of her ass was still showing. She thought about wearing something else, but it was too close to dinner time.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne fixed her hair and make up and went downstairs to set the table. As she was finishing up she heard the front door click open and Luke&#8217;s familiar foot steps. Anne&#8217;s heart still sank and was immediately filled with dread and panic. A part of her wished that she could fool herself a bit as well, but she didn&#8217;t know how realistic that expectation was at this moment. She took deep breaths, finding it hard to breathe and feeling hot. She took a sip of her water by her place setting.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She could hear Luke wash up in the bathroom. With every passing second she thought her heart was going to leap out of her chest and not just because of the corset. When he walked into the dining room, his sleeves were rolled half way up his arms. He stopped when he saw Anne, then looked at the table full of food and then back at Anne. She was so nervous she was visibly shaking in front of him. Luke looked a little dazed as well, as though he couldn&#8217;t believe this was happening. He sat down at the other end of the table from where Anne was standing, looking her up and down with a twinkle in his eye. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He leaned back and waited for her to speak. She felt as though he was drilling holes in her with his eyes and it caused her to lose a bit of her confidence. She had thought all day about facing him at home again. Then she had distracted herself as best as she could with making dinner and finding an outfit that she had not thought about the exact words she would say to him. And now she felt like crying. She was standing in front of the one person she didn&#8217;t want to see again, offering herself up to him while he sat back unapologetically. She realized the absurdity of the situation, but also told herself to relax. She tried to look at him but looked away quickly. She ended up looking down and picking at her napkin, frowning and positioning her mouth as though she was going to say something. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Luke was smiling now and leaned forward, pulling his chair closer to her so that he was arms length away from her. It made her even more nervous. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I�� she started but let the thought trail away. She tried again.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Luke�I�umm�� She tried to find the words.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You umm�� he reiterated. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She gulped. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I�thought about yesterday &#8211; I mean I thought about you yesterday. No wait.� She was almost crying again and she was shaking even harder. She had balled up her fists and placed them under her chin as if she were trying to hold her head up. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Luke, I thought about what you said last night about�me�earning my place here. And I� thought that we could work something out.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Such as?� he seemed amused and sat back up again.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well,� she gulped again. �You can have me.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I know that.� He started twiddling his fork, waiting for her to speak and it made her more nervous. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I know.� She said, trying to compose herself because she felt his words like daggers and her eyes were watery. She tried to fight back the tears. If she looked down, they would fall from her eyes.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I just thought that it doesn&#8217;t have to be like yesterday.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I enjoyed yesterday.� He said maliciously.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne was paralyzed. She tried to stop herself but her mind flashed back to yesterday. She sighed and tried to concentrate on getting the right words out.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It&#8217;s just that� I thought that I could show you��
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Show me what?� he said teasingly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That I&#8217;m willing.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Willing?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne nodded her head. �You wouldn&#8217;t have to be so rough all the time. I would do what you tell me.� She bit her lower lip to keep from crying. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Luke got up, making Anne take a step back. She didn&#8217;t know how much longer she could keep this going.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You did all this just so I would be less rough with you?� he asked her as if he thought she was an idiot. Anne couldn&#8217;t hold back the tears anymore. She had lost the fight. She was crying openly with her fists pressed to her eyes. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I just thought,� she managed to say, though it was barely audible to him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She felt him touch the front of her corset causing her to yell. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Please!� she begged, except she screamed it through tears, her face red. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Luke was pulling her to him as he sat back down on his chair. Before she knew it she was sitting on his lap like a little girl, one arm around his neck and the other on his shoulder for support. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was running his hands down the front of her corset, rubbing the part of her breasts that were not encased in her bra and occasionally reaching underneath the material causing her to jump.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She felt miserable though her nipples were erect. It was hard to sit in the corset and Anne started squirming which caused Luke&#8217;s arousal. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Go upstairs.� He whispered in her ear. �My room.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne went, shaking all the way to his bed. She wasn&#8217;t sure whether she was expected to lie down or wait there. Mostly she was trying to calm herself down but was shivering from crying so much. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Luke came in a few minutes later he was carrying lube and a condom like the night before, but today, Anne knew he was going to use them. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�If you&#8217;re so willing, why all the tears?� he asked her. She didn&#8217;t know what to say, so she figured the truth would be best.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m scared.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Luke laughed. He came around to her side, putting the condom and the lube on the table next to the bed. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne wondered whether she should bring up the fact again, that she had never been with anyone before. She wasn&#8217;t sure whether reminding him of the fact would make it better or worse for her though. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne&#8217;s corset was laced in the front, and Luke was now running his fingers over the lacing until he finally rested on the top most lace, tugging it. The material was a bit flimsy to begin with and it ripped when Luke pulled hard enough. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He grabbed the next couple of laces in his fist and ripped those off too until the corset loosened. He stepped back and sat on the bed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Take it off,� he said leaning back on his elbows. �Show me your willingness.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne swallowed and then wriggled out of her corset until it dropped to the floor. She was standing in her bra, panties, garter belt and stockings. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Now the bra,� said Luke, leaning forward, mouth agape. Then he made her take off her garter belt and stockings. Anne&#8217;s shivers were much more noticeable now. She leaned down and took off her panties. She was completely naked. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Are you wet?� he asked her. Anne&#8217;s eyes widened. She hadn&#8217;t expected him to ask such a lewd question. She stood there a bit dumbfounded.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Check.� He said. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She reached down and barely touched the tips of her fingers to her mound, but she could already feel the wetness seeping down and she could also feel the soreness from the night before. She winced, quickly pulling her hands away.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes.� She said matter -of -factly. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes what?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes I&#8217;m wet.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�We won&#8217;t be needing the lube then.� He said reaching for her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne took a step back. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Wait, no.� she said. Luke dropped his hand, looking amused again.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Wouldn&#8217;t it feel better if you used the lube?� she asked a bit too frantically.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I don&#8217;t like too much lube. In fact I would prefer if you were dry and I could hear you scream as I ram myself into you. How does that sound?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne swallowed again very slowly. She could barely breathe. She glanced at the door and then back to Luke who caught her eyes.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�There is nowhere to run. I told you yesterday. I told you so you could think it over. I knew you&#8217;d run it through your head. I knew you&#8217;d come to the same conclusion that I came to: You are truly all mine. I don&#8217;t have to bargain with you. I don&#8217;t have to even listen to you.� &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As he spoke, making his thoughts clearer, Anne began to back away from him feeling humiliated and scared. She crossed her arms as Luke got up and grabbed a hold of her and pulled her close to him. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He climbed onto his bed and pulled her with him. He propped himself up against his headboard, his cock erect. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Straddle me.� He directed. Anne&#8217;s eyes widened and she was very hesitant. She had no idea how to position herself and she was afraid she would hurt him and make him angry. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You don&#8217;t have to put it in yet, just rest on it.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne climbed on top slowly so that her ass was against his cock and she was more hugging his belly. She had to wrap her arms around his neck for balance.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m going to check to see if you&#8217;re still wet.� He told her. �Do NOT lean away from me.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne grimaced and held her breath. His hands caressed her mound much the same way she had done before, but this time he pushed two fingers in, causing her scream and fold her legs in, effectively kneeing Luke in the chest. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At the realization of what she had done, she jumped off.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh, gosh!&nbsp; I&#8217;m sorry, it was a reflex. I didn&#8217;t realize. Please!� she begged as hard as she could in hopes he would understand. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Luke was glaring at her. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Lie down.� He gasped. Anne stopped, thinking that she had just blown it. However, she did as she was told. Luke climbed on top of her, positioning himself at her entrance. Anne was frowning, her eyes completely filled with fear, tears, and dread. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Luke leaned down and kissed her on her neck. He kissed her all the way up to her jaw line and licked her cheeks. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Stop crying Anne.� His voice was gentle again. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�How?� she said with disdain, as if it were a ridiculous request. Her own tone made her even more scared because now, she though, he would definitely show no mercy if she was acting like a brat. Yet, Luke sighed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Just relax.� He said. Anne was really confused as to why he was so understand, well, as much as Luke could be. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�If I relax you&#8217;ll take advantage.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I won&#8217;t. I&#8217;ll be gentle like you asked. Just this once.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne couldn&#8217;t believe what she was hearing. She looked up at him, trying to calm herself down at the same time. She reached up and wrapped her arms around Luke&#8217;s arms, trying to get as comfortable as possible. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Luke positioned himself right at her entrance and pushed in, causing Anne to clench her teeth. She was still very sore and would have screamed if her mouth had been opened, but she made it a point to keep it shut. Luke was pulling in and out with long, slow strokes and was genuinely trying to be gentle. Even so Anne was in a lot of pain and was gripping Luke&#8217;s arms and digging her nails into them without realizing it and Luke didn&#8217;t seem like he realized it either. He was quickening his pace and Anne was getting wetter. Her pain and pleasure were about the same. She wrapped her legs around Luke and rocked back and forth with him, the pleasure overtaking the pain. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne was slowly beginning to build to climax as was Luke. He came first, but still kept going until she came. After, he kissed her one last time and rolled next to her, sighing. They both stayed that way for some time, both on a high. Anne came down first, the reality of what happened sinking in. She was utterly confused. Why had he let her come? And why was he being so nice to her all of a sudden. It was a complete turn around from last night, though she knew it wasn&#8217;t going to last. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She looked over at Luke. He was taking deep breaths in and out.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Luke, -�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�To bed, Anne.� His voice was once again icy. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne felt as though she had been slapped. Though she knew his pleasantness had an end, she hadn&#8217;t expected it to be so abrupt.&nbsp; She said nothing, as she left, gathering up her clothes on the way. She felt like a tramp and by now she probably looked like one as well. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She washed her face and brushed her teeth and finally went to bed. When she went to shut her drapes, she saw a note taped to the window sill. She took it in hand and opened it, sitting on her bed to read the contents. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When she opened it however, there was no letter. There was however a key that dropped out from the folded page, onto her lap. Anne examined it. It was a heavy brass key attached to a chain. She had no idea where it had come from and was too tired to think about it further. She once again had to succumb to her exhaustion.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;










 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Luke was, in many ways, everything Anne had ever wanted. She was not sure whether she felt this way because Luke was her first crush or because of the way she was brought up with him always around. Maybe she would have liked him anyway had they met randomly at a coffee shop some place, some time, far away from here and now. She was extremely confused by the way things had unfolded between them. When they were younger, their parents had hinted that maybe Luke and she would get married when they were older. In some ways it was expected of them, but Anne had not known that until she was about 15. Perhaps that was why Luke always resented her. At least, she felt that he always resented her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne remembered sitting in her mother&#8217;s car once. It was cold and they had just gotten coffee from their local shop. Anne had seen Jimmy Smicks, the boy that stared at her when she walked by, and the one that she secretly pined for. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Jimmy&#8217;s nice.� Her mother said, noticing her daughter&#8217;s longing gaze penetrating the glass windows of their car and the coffee shop. Anne had, as her mother knew she would, turned red and hastily sipped her coffee.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�He&#8217;s ok.� She said, turning away.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You shouldn&#8217;t date much, you know.� Said her mother, taking a deep breath.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What? Why shouldn&#8217;t I date? I&#8217;m old enough!� fought Anne.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Your father and I forbid it. You&#8217;ll be grounded if you try.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What?!� shrieked Anne.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You know who you&#8217;re supposed to be with. You should spend more time with him.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne looked dull, as though she couldn&#8217;t figure out a puzzle. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Who are you talking about?� she asked sincerely.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Luke, ofcourse.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Luke!� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes, Luke. What&#8217;s wrong with him?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Ugh! If Luke had it his way, I&#8217;d be dead. Anyway, he&#8217;s at college. He&#8217;s probably boinking all the girls he can.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Luke is home from college and he doesn&#8217;t really show any interest in girls.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well, maybe he&#8217;s gay.� Shrugged Anne, secretly hoping for and dreading the idea.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�He did have one girlfriend for a very long time.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�He never brought her home.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�She broke his heart before he could. Maybe you should ask him to go out. He&#8217;s moping at home.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�He can go out with Dad or Bobby.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�He did go out with your father and brother when it first happened. They used to go camping you know, and he helped fix up the garage, but it looks like he&#8217;s really depressed.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well, how would a 15 year old be any help to a broken &#8211;hearted 23 year old? What do you want me to say to him? I mean Mom, we don&#8217;t exactly have the type of relationship where we console each other.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well maybe it&#8217;ll come as a welcome surprise to him.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne sighed and didn&#8217;t say anything back until they got home. She turned to her mother. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�So that&#8217;s why I can&#8217;t date. Luke.� She verified.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For a moment, her mother looked sad, but nodded as though it were an unavoidable truth.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Anne and her mother came home, Luke was over watching television in the living room. He was watching some basketball and didn&#8217;t seem to hear anyone come in.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Hey Luke!� said Anne&#8217;s mom cheerfully.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Hey Martha.� He said, turning his head. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�My folks are waiting for you. Everyone is over there. They hijacked the remote.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh Luke, when will you learn there&#8217;s nothing better than yahtzee and Monty Python on a Friday night?� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Both Luke and Anne looked horrified, which made her mother laugh.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It&#8217;s the yahtzee mother.� Said Anne. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well ok, I&#8217;m going to take some popcorn over. Luke, I hope you don&#8217;t mind, but Anne&#8217;s got a bit of homework to do. She might join you in here if you don&#8217;t mind.� Said her mother, to Anne&#8217;s horror.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No problem. The game&#8217;s almost over, but I might stay and watch t.v. if you don&#8217;t mind.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh, it&#8217;s not problem, right Anne.� She said expectantly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No. No problem.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Would you guys like some popcorn?� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Sure.� Said Luke.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne didn&#8217;t know why, but she was embarrassed and her entire body felt like it was under a lot of pressure. Maybe this is what it felt like when people swam too deep in the ocean.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne&#8217;s mom left the popcorn to pop and then left with batch she had prepared for her own engagement.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne waited for it to stop and emptied it into a huge bowl. She plopped it in front of Luke and started to walk away to get her homework.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Do you have any coke?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne turned around.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes.� She said and then turned and walked away again.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When she came back down he was in the same position as she had let him, without a coke anywhere in sight.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She sighed, thinking that maybe the poor guy was really in a lot of pain. He seemed distracted by something other than the game.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Do you want lime in it? She said, walking over to the fridge.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes.� He said a bit annoyed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She brought it to him and sat on the couch, crossing her legs Indian style.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She did her homework for an hour while Luke watched t.v. He was watching some horror movie, but still seemed distracted. Anne had, until that very minute, been thinking of something to say to him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She looked at him for a moment and thought about what her mother had said to her in the car about them getting married. It was just wishful thinking on her mother&#8217;s part, Anne was sure. Anne did not even think she was worthy of Luke&#8217;s glances sometimes. She was skinny and pale and had never been blond. She looked like marble. She didn&#8217;t know what kind of girl Luke liked, but his mother was blond and Luke was blond and everyone in their families was blond except Anne. She got it from her grandmother who had passed. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Luke was suddenly staring back at her, a fist full of pop corn in his hand.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What?� he said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne shook her head as though it was inconsequential and went back to her homework. Then she stopped and still looking down, she spoke to him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Mom says you broke up with a girl.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I did.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Did she break up with you or did you break up with her?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It&#8217;s none of your business.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Right. I know. I&#8217;m being rude. Sorry.� Anne was babbling. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A moment passed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Are you going out with boys?� he asked before throwing popcorn into his mouth.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It&#8217;s none of your business.� She said, half teasingly. The other half wanted to say yes just to see his reaction.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�If you don&#8217;t tell me I&#8217;ll tell your parents that you are. I&#8217;ll tell them that you went all the way.� He threatened.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne looked horrified. �I&#8217;m not allowed to date.� She said defensively.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Rules don&#8217;t stop people from doing things if they want to do it bad enough.� He said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You can&#8217;t expect me to tell you things when you don&#8217;t tell me things.� She said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Look at you, you&#8217;re a baby.� He said condescendingly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m not a baby. You&#8217;re just a jerk.� She said and without knowing why, she felt tears welling up. Luke sat up, the humor gone from his face.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Don&#8217;t speak to me that way and stop crying. It makes you look like a baby even more.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne slammed her books on the table and got up from the couch, gathering her materials.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You know why I can&#8217;t date? Because my parents want me to marry YOU.� She spat.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Luke smirked. �I know.� He said. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne stopped what she was doing and looked up.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; �You do?� she said, surprised.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yeah, my parents and your parents have been saving up ever since you were born.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That&#8217;s disgusting.� Anne said angrier than she intended.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well, it&#8217;s always nice to be married to someone who feels the same way about things.� He said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�If you don&#8217;t want to, why haven&#8217;t you said anything to them?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Who said I haven&#8217;t? Who said I don&#8217;t want to marry you?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You just said you feel the same way!� was she crazy?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh, I meant it&#8217;s disgusting that they saved up like that. Don&#8217;t worry. They&#8217;re saving up for school too.� He said cheerily.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�This is a big joke to you?� she said, sitting down on the couch, shaking.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It&#8217;s a big joke, because they knew when you were born.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What do you mean?� she asked bewildered.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well,� he said leaning over toward her, �who would want to marry you? You haven&#8217;t even lost your baby fat.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne felt the sting of his words. No one had ever called her fat, but for some reason, the fact that Luke said it meant something. He was watching her reaction and smiling. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You really are a jerk.� She said, getting up and taking her books and pencils.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne was thinking about that memory while preparing dinner. Most of her life now revolved around going to school and doing chores and homework while trying to keep up with Luke and his needs.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her body often ached and it didn&#8217;t help that she was getting bonier by the passing months. Luke had found this disgusting and ordered her to gain weight. One night he had brought home a woman from who-knows-where. She was a business woman, from what Anne could tell by her garb, and much older than Luke. He had told Anne to take her food to her room and so she had, realizing that maybe he would satiate his needs with other women.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She heard them making love, but a while later, the front door opened and closed and Luke was saying a happy goodbye. Anne thought that maybe he did not prefer his conquests to stay over night. He had never allowed Anne to sleep next to him in his bed.
It didn&#8217;t matter, she had found away to make all of this go away. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But then she had felt Luke on top of her, his legs squeezing her body and his hands wrapping around her waist. He was leaning down and breathing into her ear. Anne gulped.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Do you think I&#8217;m not going to touch you just because you&#8217;re like this?� he said, grabbing her hair and yanking her head up.&nbsp; Anne gasped. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He licked the side of her face from her jaw line to her temple and bit her cheek hard. Anne yelped and fought against his grip. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He flipped her over and slapped her across the other cheek. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne put her hand to it and sat up, backing away glaring at him. She could barely see his face except for the sliver of light coming from the hall. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Luke was shaking too and he was angry. He grabbed her around her hip, her bone jutting out starkly. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What is this?� he asked menacingly. �What are you doing to yourself?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I didn&#8217;t do it on purpose.� She tried to reason. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In one swoop Luke picked her up and laid her on the bed, getting on top of her. He rammed himself in. She was completely dry and it caused her to shriek. She tried to clench her teeth but she couldn&#8217;t breathe. She felt suffocated. Luke held her in place and thrust up forcefully. He was looking down at her face most of the time. He nibbled on her ear and neck and bit down hard each time he thrust. When he was done he emptied into her and got off. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne got up to run to the bathroom and clean herself, but he pushed her back down. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Keep it in. Use it as lube.� He said before sliding his hand down to her slit. He pushed his middle and index finger in, swishing around his fluid and fingering her. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Pretend you like it.� He said. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne was in so much pain she barely heard him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He bent down and sucked on her neck, but it made Anne tense up more. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Just rock your hips with my fingers he whispered.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne followed his fingers with her hips and found that it felt a little better, but he was still going too hard for her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He stopped abruptly and mounted her again. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Do what you just did and we&#8217;ll be good.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She tried to do as he asked. She rocked her hips with his, but he was thrusting too hard. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You keep stopping.� He said in frustration. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne gulped, mistaking it for anger.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What is it?� he said in annoyance.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She froze, unable to speak in fear of upsetting him further.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Anne!� He barked. He looked at her when she didn&#8217;t respond and saw that she was petrified. Sighing, he tried again and spoke in a softer voice. �Anne.� He said. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What do you want me to do?� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I just want you to keep rhythm with me. I didn&#8217;t think it was that hard. It&#8217;s just fucking after all.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m trying to keep pace with you.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�But? What&#8217;s the hiccup?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m trying to get used to it.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Used to what?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Your thrusts.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Luke rolled onto his back and pulled Anne towards him. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Get on.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne straddled him and lowered herself down gingerly. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She liked this feeling more. She was full but it didn&#8217;t hurt apart from his girth.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Luke had his eyes closed and was holding onto her hips.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He squeezed and guided her hips in the motion he wanted. It was much more pleasurable to Anne. She found herself grinding on him and moaning. He was panting and pulling her towards him. He held her still and pounded her until he came. When he was done he flipped her over to her original position on her back and him on top. He nibbled her neck and took her nipples between his fingers. He was going slow and much gentler than before, gauging her reaction. Anne arched her back as she came. Luke rolled off her and she ran to the bathroom to clean up. She took a shower and came back. Luke was still in her bed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Do you want me to leave?� she asked, confused.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He shook his head and patted the space beside him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne climbed onto the bed but stayed sitting. Luke mimicked her. He started rubbing her back. Anne swallowed, panicking. She did not know why he all of a sudden felt as though she merited a back rub. Regardless, it was making her tense up. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Why are you tensing up when I&#8217;m trying to give you a back rub?� he said annoyed again. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Why are you giving me a back rub?� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Because I want to.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Luke, it&#8217;s late, can&#8217;t I just go to bed?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No. It&#8217;s a Friday and I want touch you.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You touch me enough.� She said a bit too curtly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You don&#8217;t want me to be too rough. Now you don&#8217;t want me to do anything to soothe you. What do you want?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I can&#8217;t tell you what I want.� She said, getting under the covers. To her surprise Luke also got under the covers. He started rubbing her thighs and belly. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Why did you make yourself so thin?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I told you I didn&#8217;t do it on purpose.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I saw you flush the food down the toilet.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne&#8217;s eyes widened and she gulped. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�If you tell me the truth I won&#8217;t get mad. I won&#8217;t punish you.� He said truthfully.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne sighed, not knowing whether she could trust him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Tell me.� He said stroking her cheek. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�At first I did it because you said I had baby fat. Then I guess I lost track. And tonight I had this epiphany that maybe, if I kept this up, you&#8217;d find someone else to torture.� She winced.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I was just teasing!� he said mortified. �You never struck me as an idiot.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Forget it.� said Anne, getting angry now for the first time in a long while.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Don&#8217;t go away.� Said Luke, trying to grab her arm as she got off the bed. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne pulled away in time and stood up, but she spun around and faced him. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You don&#8217;t get it. For an entire year I thought of ways to be more pleasing to you so you would like me. I don&#8217;t even understand why��
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Why, what?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Why you do this to me everyday?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Luke looked bewildered, but Anne continued.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I mean, how do you bring yourself to get excited? And if you don&#8217;t even like me, why did you pick me? Why? Is it just to punish me�for something? Do you still blame me for everything?� she said, her voice cracking.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I never blamed you.� He said. It was the one thing he could think to say.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Then what is all this about?� she asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What do you want me to say?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I want you to tell me what I did to deserve this.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I wanted you.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�But you already owned me.� She said through gritted teeth.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I would never have made me marry me.� He said defensively.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne laughed. �Yes, this is so much better.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You hated the idea of being married to me. It was clear from that night.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�When did I ever say that?� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You didn&#8217;t have to say it Anne. I saw your reaction. That whole night was about me and you getting together. That&#8217;s why our parents left us alone. The asked me and I said I wanted to if you wanted to. No one knew how you felt.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I thought you broke up with your girlfriend. I thought you were heartbroken.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I did break up with her six months before I came home. Yeah I was a little sad about it, but I mean,� he gulped, running his hands through his hair. �You never seemed interested in me. I just thought I&#8217;d pretend I felt the same way until�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Until..?� she said crossing her arms.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Until you got older�I don&#8217;t know.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Do you like hurting me?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I like hurting you physically. I like when you beg me to stop.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Anne gulped. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You&#8217;re the only lover I have ever had.� She told him. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good.� He said coldly. �That&#8217;s the way I want it.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Get in bed.� He ordered her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
