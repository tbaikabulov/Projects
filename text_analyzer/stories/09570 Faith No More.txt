FAITH NO MORE
By
Latex Conservative


My name is Faith: I have none, 
Sadden for I have no one,
To share my love, the opposite sex,
Forthe second skin, tight black latex.
How I love it, deep in my core,
When I wear it, Faith No More.

Left me here, Eric my dear,
Accident they say, so I hear.
Our love strange, a bondage affair,
Breath Play fun, miss death by a hair.
In fetish heaven, his soul will soar.
Truly alone I,his Faith No More.

On this night, I have a dream,
He and Ifuck, we make cream.
From his cock, from my crotch,
In our latex, we stare we watch.
Cock drools, pussy foams, we puddle the floor,
He says, �Marry me pleaseFaith No More.�

Dream ends, I awake! I can&#8217;t fuckingstand it!
I curse, I cuss, I scream aloud �Oh Goddamn it!�
To rid myself of my guiltI asks what would it take?
I bound and gagged and burned at the stake?
Isobs, I cry, from my heart I pour,
My regret, my regret, as Faith No More.

�I miss thee, my Eric, my partner in sex,
Your body, so perfect, in skin tight latex.
In our planned wedlock, fetish bondage bliss,
To seal it, I couldn&#8217;t wait, with a ring gag kiss.
You in black latex, for which you and I adore,
I in white latex, bride to be, Faith No More.
�You wait before the clergy, and a latex nun,
She has you on your knees for some Mistress fun.
Yard stick in hand, she whips your ass,
She cries, &#8216;Drool from your gag, have you no class&#8217;?
Dungeon doors open, I cum, the woman you adore,
A bound and gagged white vision, your fianc�, Faith No More.

�I approach, I struggle; try not to make a mess,
Hard to walk, the latex tight, a one piecehobble dress.
I teeter, I tarter, I have to navigate by feel,
Neck in posture collar; feet in shoes of ballet heel.
Arms laced in binder, nipples clamped, tits sore,
Here I cum, once again, your woman Faith No More.

�Forced down beside you, the first of many tasks,
Domsmake us share air through connecting gas masks.
Deep into each other&#8217;s eyes, through lenses we stare,
We gasp gently, together, we&#8217;re a wonderful pair.
Your bare ass flogged, twenty strokes, hopefully more,
Bare tits spanked, your bride&#8217;s, Faith No More.

�As the clergy begins, light headed we would become,
Together, all ready, we are starting to cum
Again, and again, but before we pass out,
Master turns a valve; lets the bad gas out.
New air, great day for bondage lovers to adore,
The marriage of Gimpy Eric to his beloved Faith No More.

�Alas, after vow moments, the changing of tide
Gas masks removed: &#8216;you may kiss your bride&#8217;.
Upon the clergy&#8217;s order, we obey, our tongues go in
To each other&#8217;s open mouth, drooling, pure ring gag sin.
Our collars attached, a hood shared, a great store
Of bondage and fetish added, linking you to me, Faith No More.�

As I finishthe tale, I finish my task
Of donning all latex, of zipping up my mask.
So many, too many, the layers are so tight,
My body a shiny shadow; Faith out of sight.
Not my eyes, not a hair, not my skin, not a pore,
Nor the dildo vibingme, deep inside Faith No More.

As I cry, as Iweeps, I finally begin to feel
For Gimpy Eric&#8217;s suit, for the open neck seal.
Reversing the snakeI wiggle in, I don the second skin
To occupy the latex my beloved enjoyed sleeping in.
A one piece suit, head to toe, a sexy fetish chore
To slither in, to put on, forI his Faith No More.

Very hot, breathing hard, I have a shuddering spasm
Very wet my crotch is, from a bondage fetish orgasm.
Corset tight, knees bent, I stretch, I reach, I suck
All the air remaining to me while mimicking the fuck
I had with my Eric, hundreds of them and more,
In skin tight black latex, his slut, his nymph, Faith No More.

As I collapse from effort, as my life begins to sag,
I bundle myself up quickly in a thick rubber bag.
Barely able to move, the bondage all latex,
I squeeze deep inside, my lust and life at apex.
Last foot in, the rubber bag closes; its sometime after four,
It marks the last I see the world as the rubber girl Faith No More.

In the wombI have always loved, I gasp a familiar scent,
Of my lovers the latex and rubber, and the man Ihad spent
Time with hidden deep in this alternate fetish reality,
Before the accident took his life, a great bondage tragedy.
Bag the head, garrote and strangle, and many, many more,
Breath Play I took too far, on the lover of Faith No More.

In the dark, I feel him now, a soul nothing more,
My body damp, my pussy wet, the beauty Faith No More.

My eyes close, as they do, Eric touches my core,
I melt, I weep, he&#8217;s here me, with his Faith No More.

�I breathe my last breath, to be with you, I Adore�,
I say, I faint, the tragic Faith No More.

In the twilight, lips blue, I feel his golden kiss,
A sigh of relief escapes my mouth, how I truly miss
Those hours spent together, kissing, licking, and fucking,
Along with sixty-nine, and some gender bending tucking.
We will always have latex, and our memories of bondage porn
Which we privately made together, Eric and Faith No More.

Orgasm awakens me I breathe with new life,
I&#8217;m not dead, I&#8217;m out of the bag, Eric&#8217;s would be wife.
I don&#8217;t know how, I don&#8217;t know why, �How can this be?�
I ask with gagging breaths; I tear the latex off to see.
No one there, nothing here, Faith is left with a mystery.
The dawn is coming; the sun shines on me, washes away my misery.

Holding myself, rubbing myself, I see no other reason
Given life, I was spared, to begin a new season.
Forgiven I, Eric has, and has given me his blessing,
To seek another, man or woman, in love with latex dressing.
�I cry now�, I say in relief, �with your love Gimpy Eric I will pour
�Into every perv I met, latex or not, as your cup, always your Faith No More!�



FAITH NO MORE
