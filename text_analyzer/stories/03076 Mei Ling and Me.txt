Synopsis: A gentle story where a Leather Domme meets her match in an unexpected wayMEI LING AND ME!  
By  
ANNE GRAY  
It was not planned so I suppose you could call it accidental. In any event
  it was one of the best things that ever happened to me. I had just seated myself
  at one of the conference dinner tables. As usual at these events there were
  ten chairs squashed around the table and only the chair next to mine was still
  vacant.  
After the usual introductions the nine of us settled back down and I glanced
  around to notice her standing at the entrance to the meeting room looking lost.
  One of the hotel banquet Captains approached her, turned, studied the room
  and immediately gestured for her to follow him. He had spotted the empty chair
  at my table.  
I tried not to stare but it was not easy. She was Asian, Chinese probably,
  and wearing one of those satin dresses with a stand up collar. It showed every
  curve of a perfectly proportioned figure and ended just above the knee. The
  matching pumps I guessed had a 3" heel. She was gorgeous! Her jet-black hair
  was just below her ears and styled with the two front ends curved in towards
  her chin to frame her face.  
The Captain pulled out the chair for her and she just stood beside it with
  her eyes cast down while we all introduced ourselves. She looked up quickly
  and said, "I'm Mei Ling", then slid in the chair.  
Beautiful as she was, she was painfully shy. Through the dinner I managed
  to get some basic information from her but it was hard work. She was a computer
  programmer in a different division of the corporation we worked for. This was
  the closing dinner of the Annual Meeting and we would have to suffer through
  a bunch of boring speeches before it was over.  
Mei Ling ate like a bird and hardly spoke a word to the guy on the other
  side of her, much to his disgust, because he was not very subtle about where
  his interests lay with this lovely young lady.  
As we moved towards the coat check at the end of the program Mei Ling quietly
  asked me if I knew whether the hotel would call her a taxi. I didn't understand
  what was going on. I mean she was probably 23 or 24 years old and a professional
  yet she didn't have a car or know that hotels had cab ranks outside? It didn't
  make sense but I took advantage of the question to ask where she lived.  
It really didn't matter what her answer was because I was going to insist
  on driving her home. I was even more determined when I saw the expensive leather
  coat being handed to her in return for the ticket. When she told me where she
  lived I made my offer and she glanced quickly up at my face, whispered a "thank
  you" and started putting on the coat.  
It was deep blue leather, dropping to slightly below her knees. Mei Ling
  closed the coat with the six buttons and a tie belt. While she was doing that
  I had retrieved my own black leather maxi-length coat and fastened the front
  before pulling the wide belt tightly around my waist and feeding one end through
  the double pin buckle.  
I didn't miss the fact that her eyes followed my movements and I pulled on
  a pair of kid gloves as we walked towards the entrance. Before going out to
  the parking lot I stopped and pulled a soft leather hat from my pocket. As
  I adjusted it over my hair I looked at the girl and decided to see if I had
  judged her correctly.  
"I'm parked at the end of the lot, Mei Ling, and it's cold and blustery out
  so I think you should pull up the hood of that coat. Don't you have any gloves?"  
Slowly her hands reached up on either side of her neck and got a hold of
  the hood to pull it up over her head. Then her hands went in the coat pockets
  and came out with matching blue kid gloves. If the rest of this girl's wardrobe
  was like this she was certainly not short of money.  
There was a tab on the hood that buttoned across her throat but she had not
  done it up. I lifted her chin with a gloved finger and fastened it for her.
  Her reaction was to drop her eyes again and give another whispered "Thank you."  
We made our way to my car and got in. I started the engine, got the heater
  going and then turned and just looked at her. She was reaching towards the
  hood when I spoke. "Do up your seat belt Mei Ling. I don't move the car unless
  my passengers are safely strapped in. And, please leave the coat hood up; you
  look so lovely with that leather framing your face."  
She didn't say a word but connected the seat belt and then sat with her hands
  in her lap &ndash; the hood stayed up!  
I didn't need much help finding her place but as I pulled in the driveway
  I hid my surprise. The house wasn't huge but it certainly wasn't small and
  it smacked of money. Mei Ling thanked me for the ride and asked if I would
  like to come in for tea or a drink. If she hadn't asked I would have found
  an excuse to get inside anyway.  
Over tea that she made I dragged some more facts from her. Her brother who
  was a few years older than her and a very successful businessman owned the
  house. He was currently back in China for six months or so setting up a new
  division. The two of them had immigrated when she was eighteen and, while he
  allowed her to go to a private school where she excelled in computers, he had
  played the typical Chinese male and squashed any social life for his sister.  
I mentioned that I was almost jealous of the lovely clothes she was wearing
  particularly the coat that now was draped with mine over a chair in the hallway.  
Mei Ling told me that even though she very rarely went out except to functions
  like tonight that had to do with work; she did have an extensive wardrobe.  
"You looked so lovely in that blue coat tonight, do you have any other things
  in leather?" I asked the question gently as I sat beside her on the chesterfield
  sipping my tea.  
"Yes." She said meekly. "I have several things. I don't know why but I love
  the feel of leather, it's so smooth and cool yet warm at the same time." Well
  I knew why; she had a leather fetish and so did I but mine extended to latex
  and bondage. The fact that I was also a lesbian only increased my determination
  to get to know Mei Ling very, very well.  
It was getting late and I didn't want to push things tonight so I suggested
  that, as tomorrow was Saturday, if she didn't have any other plans maybe I
  could visit and we could get to know each other a bit more. As I said it I
  again lifted her chin with my finger so she was looking at me.  
And that is how I arrived on her doorstep the next afternoon ready to take
  things a step further. Under my black leather coat I was wearing a fitted black
  leather dress and a pair of lace up knee high boots with 5" heels. Mei Ling
  seemed to shrink at the sight of my outfit as I peeled off the coat and hung
  it in the hallway; I left my kid leather gloves on as they were tucked up my
  arms under the sleeves of the dress.  
Mei Ling was wearing a flowery blouse and a pair of white slacks with a pair
  of low-heeled sandals on her feet. She looked stunning &ndash; but!  
"Oh I thought after our talk last night you would be showing me some more
  of your leather Mei Ling. That's why I wore this." As I was talking I stroked
  my gloved hands down over my waist and did a little twirl on the high heels.  
She stammered a bit, "I'm sorry we can go and have a look after tea if you
  like."  
I liked and after the obligatory cups of tea we went upstairs to a huge bedroom
  that looked out over the back garden. They had obviously just punched a doorway
  through to the smaller room next door and turned it into a clothes closet.  
I took the initiative and started wandering around the racks of clothes.
  On one wall were several chests of drawers and shoe racks. It was more like
  a retail store than a private wardrobe for one woman and at first I thought
  I would not find what I hoped.  
Then I noticed that two of the racks, instead of plastic hanging bags, had
  cotton covers draped over them. As I approached them I recognized that lovely
  perfume of leather. I should have guessed that she knew you don't store leather
  inside plastic.  
"If I choose some things would you model them for me Mei Ling?" "If you want
  me too." This girl never seemed to speak above a whisper.  
I took my time as I roamed around the room but I could see her eyes following
  my leather clad figure everywhere I went. The selection was easy; I knew just
  how I wanted her to look for me. "Would you like me to wait downstairs while
  you change?" I said as I handed her my choices and got a brief nod in return.  
I had hoped I would get to watch her change but she was like a deer in my
  headlights right now and I didn't want to scare her off so I left and went
  back to the living room. I was sick of tea so I used the time to find the liquor
  cabinet and pour myself a stiff drink.  
I stood up as she slowly walked down the stairs then approached her, reached
  for her hands and held them away from her sides. "You look beautiful Mei Ling." She
  was wearing a pair of tight rose-colored leather slacks with a matching vest
  over a white silk long sleeved blouse. On her feet was a pair of black leather
  ankle boots with 4" heels.  
I had looked for something even more exotic but not found it. I hoped to
  change that situation in the near future and pulled her over to sit beside
  me on the sofa as I continued my gentle attack.  
She didn't pull away as I draped my leather covered left arm around her shoulders
  and, yet again, used my kid gloved right hand to lift her chin so she was looking
  at me.  
"Why are you so shy, Mei Ling? Does it have something to do with your brother
  keeping you under such tight control or is it because you are not sure how
  to handle your own feelings?"  
I allowed my left hand to rest against the taunt leather over her breast
  and the leather on leather contact seemed to calm her somehow. She almost snuggled
  against my side and I knew I had her.  
"I'm so lonely. Even when my brother is home it is like having a very strict
  father watching my every move. I insisted on going to work, not because we
  need the money, but I hoped it would help me meet other people. I'm very clever
  at my job but most of the people in my department are men and I catch them
  sometimes looking at me very strangely. I don't dress provocatively but I feel
  their eyes on me all the time."  
It was the most words I'd her speak at one time and I knew it came from her
  heart but I'm not ashamed to admit I took advantage of it.  
I pulled her even closer to me until the leather we were wearing almost squeaked. "Mei
  Ling, you need a friend. I know we only just met but I think I could be that
  friend if you'll let me. We seem to get along and I'm by myself so can we try
  being friends; will you let me help you?"  
For once she looked up herself and studied my eyes for a long second and
  then nodded and dropped her eyes again. We spent the rest of the day just talking
  and getting closer and ordered in some food. I didn't try anything and acted
  like a big sister to Mei Ling.  
Naturally, the conversation turned around to her wardrobe I made sure of
  that. I told her that I knew a leather outlet that had some things I thought
  she would really like and convinced her to visit it with me the following week.  
During that visit she didn't even look at prices, money was not an issue
  with her. She loved the store and picked out a few things but nothing too special.
  I, on the other hand, managed to talk her into buying a pair of leather lace
  up thigh boots with 6" heels. I also had my friend, who owned the place, slide
  a few other items on the sales slip that I knew would fit Mei Ling.  
Back at her home I stepped things up a little. She did a little fashion show
  for me modeling her purchases and then it I asked her to try the boots. At
  this point she was wearing a leather mini skirt and the leather vest she had
  worn the week before. She pulled the boots on and we giggled together as we
  laced them and then I helped her stand up.  
She took to the heels easily and I made a mental note to make the next set
  higher. "I like it when you help me and hold me." She said as she walked around
  the room in those boots. "Well, come over here and I'll show you another way
  I can hold you and make you feel very safe and secure when I'm with you."  
She looked puzzled but came over to me and I turned her so her back was to
  me then asked her to put her hands behind her back. She was wearing a pair
  of leather gloves that covered her wrists and I held them together as I secured
  them with a thin strap.  
The leather single glove slipped up her arms and I pulled her to me and kissed
  the nape of her neck as I arranged the straps over her shoulders and back to
  the top edge of the sheath. Then I started lacing it until her elbows almost
  touched and she never said a word. There were no complaints, no hysterics,
  nothing. She just stood calmly facing away from me as I continued confining
  her arms.  
Over the laces were four additional straps that I tightened around the sheath
  and then pulled the shoulder straps up a couple more notches and turned her
  to face me.  
"Now then, how do you feel?" There were tears rolling down her cheeks that
  I caught with my handkerchief. "Why are you crying? Have I hurt you?"  
"No, oh no, I suddenly feel so secure and so dependant and helpless and,
  and free! But that doesn't make sense."  
"Yes it does my love, it makes all the sense in the world but I have something
  else that will make you understand the meaning of being helpless even more." I
  kissed her softly on the lips and then used one hand to pull gently down on
  her lower jaw so that her mouth opened. The leather gag fitted perfectly and
  I buckled the strap behind her head.  
We spent the evening on the chesterfield with me cuddling her and exploring
  her leather covered form with gentle touches of my kid gloved hands. Slowly
  Mei Ling relaxed and finally fell asleep in my arms with her arms still firmly
  locked behind her and the gag in her mouth.  
For the next few weeks we spent our evenings and weekends together. She had
  set up an account at the fetish store and I frequently stopped to pick out
  something new for her to wear. I deliberately never touched her in the crotch
  area, that could wait; but I noticed that every time I approached her nipples
  became very noticeable.  
A leather bra with nipple holes was my next purchase! Then I stepped up my
  sensual activity. She passively accepted the fairly light bondage I used, the
  arm sheath, the boots and the gag but that evening I was wearing neck to toe
  tight black leather and added a strap around her ankles.  
I blocked her against the end of the chesterfield with my body then put my
  arm around her shoulders and gently started rolling one of her nipples between
  my kid-gloved fingers. Her moans started almost immediately but they were moans
  of pleasure and I really had to hold myself back. I restricted myself to her
  breasts but they were enough to get her seriously aroused for the first time
  in her life.  
She had given me a key to her home and one evening I let myself in to find
  her sobbing soundlessly on the chesterfield. The tears were rolling down her
  cheeks and her chest was heaving as she tried to get her breath around the
  silent hysterics.  
Without even taking time to get out of my coat I scooped a box of tissues
  off the side table and took Mei Ling in my arms as I settled beside her.  
"What is it, what's wrong?" She motioned to an envelope and several pages
  of a letter on the coffee table but since I don't read Chinese hieroglyphics
  it was no help to get me understanding what was going on.  
Gradually I got her settled down and she told me what was in the letter;
  it was from her father. Her brother had been arrested by the Chinese government
  and charged with smuggling his products out of the country without paying the
  duties. Her father said that it really meant he hadn't bribed the right people
  and was now in deep trouble.  
In with the letter was a power of attorney that would allow Mei Ling to move
  the bank accounts into her name and then she was ordered to sell the house,
  close the accounts and return to her family in China.  
At hearing this I used some of the tissues to catch my own tears.  
"Were you crying for your brother then?  
"No, I was crying because I don't want to go back there and I can't bear
  to leave you."  
"Then you will not so we must figure out a way around the problem; but first
  we will get you feeling secure and comfortable."  
Half an hour later, I had bathed her face to remove the tear damaged makeup,
  laced her arms in the single sheath and strapped her legs, clad in a pair of
  tight leather pants, at the ankle and knee. We talked as I made us a simple
  dinner. Mei Ling was roped in one of the kitchen chairs and I fed her as several
  ideas came and went between us. Then it hit me and I told Mei Ling what we
  should do; she immediately agreed with the plan and we worked out the details.  
It really was quite simple; I worked in the real estate division of our company
  and knew just what to do. Within days Mei Ling had the house on the market
  and had turned the bank accounts into bearer bonds in a very substantial amount.
  Those we put in my account and I used a small part of it to buy the other half
  of the semi-detached house I owned.  
A contractor easily punched a double door inside between the two units and
  Mei Ling and I had a large home that could accommodate our wardrobe and be
  adapted to our lifestyle in a very convenient and comfortable way.  
When Mei Ling's house sold very quickly for nearly half a million dollars
  we laundered that money the same way. Mei Ling resigned from the company and
  disappeared.  
There was no way her family would be able to trace her and we began our life
  together in earnest.  
She loved being a sub' and she loved leather and bondage and the week after
  we were settled in our new home I took her for a car trip.  
She made the trip snug in a leather straight jacket, hobble skirt and laced,
  high-heeled boots that was all hidden under a long, heavy rubber rain cape.
  The car shoulder and waist safety belts held her firmly. After a three hour
  drive I pulled in the parking lot of a medical clinic, helped Mei Ling out
  of the car and led her inside.  
In a very short period of time Mei Ling was undressed and strapped to an
  examining table as I stood beside her stroking her face and smiling down at
  her.  
"Mei Ling" I said, "My friend Linda here is a Doctor and we have a very special
  surprise for you. In a minute you will go to sleep and when you wake you will
  be my bondage partner for life. Starting at your ears Linda will be adding
  a couple more holes to the ones you have and then she will move down to pierce
  your septum and each side of your nose."  
"Your tongue will have three hard plastic tubes punched through it so I can
  put in studs or maybe fit a gag with pins to clamp around it. Your lovely nipples
  will be ringed and also have a gold bar installed through each one. Your navel
  will be ringed and then Linda will put several stainless steel rings down either
  side of your vagina and one gold one through your clitoris."  
"Before that though since you are still a virgin we are going to let you
  experience losing that and getting a taste of the pleasures we will be enjoying
  from now on."  
As I was speaking tears started down her cheeks but I kissed them away and
  then placed my lips over hers and let my fingers caress her nipples as Linda
  expertly began to manipulate her clitoris and the opening of her vagina.  
The dildo was well lubricated and in the hands of one who knew just how to
  use it to get the maximum reaction. Linda had used a finger to check and judged
  that Mei Ling's hymen would not present a problem.  
It didn't and as Mei Ling was overtaken with her first orgasm, she smiled
  up at me and as I slid the anesthetic mask over her face she whispered, "Keep
  me feeling secure and love me."  
"Always!"

&nbsp;

MEI LING AND ME � 2

By

Anne Gray

&nbsp;

There
is something so incredibly sensuous about the sound of leather on leather.� I don�t mean the crisp thwacking of a leather
strap on leather covered buttocks although that does have its points.� No, it�s the soft sibilant hissing sound
made, like now, when my hand in its tight kid leather glove slides around her
neck and shoulder to rest on the taut red leather covering her left breast and
cup it in a gentle embrace.

&nbsp;

I
felt a shiver run through Mei Ling�s form as I cuddled her to me and slowly
activated the mechanism of the double width recliner chair until the back moved
from vertical to a more comfortable angle.

&nbsp;

The
preparations had taken quite some time but now, the evening was young, the
lights were low and I was ready to take my love on a roller coaster ride to
remember.

&nbsp;

It
was several weeks since our return from the clinic and we had spent them
well.� We explored each other�s likes and
dislikes, wants and needs and most importantly, limits.

&nbsp;

Obviously
I was the Domme that was without question but gradually I made it clear to the
gentle and compliant Mei Ling that our relationship had to be a two way street.
It could not be all take from me and give by her, there had to be satisfaction
and, yes, comfort, on both sides.

&nbsp;

As I
pulled the helpless leather bound form closer to me I thought back to the first
time I asked for her complete trust.� 

&nbsp;

I
took her out to a movie!

&nbsp;

At
the end of the evening while I could not remember the name of the film Mei
Ling, the little minx, said she loved it but she would have liked some of the
popcorn!

&nbsp;

That,
of course, would have been impossible given the gag in her mouth!

&nbsp;

Oh
yes! Gagged, out in public and at the movies.

&nbsp;

She
just expected a quiet evening at home being my helpless little plaything while
we watched a movie on TV; I said nothing to make her think otherwise.� I had started with a very soft leather
straight jacket that covered her torso from neck to waist.� Her nipples poked through �� holes with their
gold rings and studs glinting against the black leather.� Folding her arms comfortably under her
breasts I buckled the straps at the end of each sleeve in the small of her
back.

&nbsp;

The
butt plug was not that long and very flexible while the dildo was bigger but
designed to titillate not aggravate.��
Next came a soft absorbent pad and a pair of latex panties before I
tightened the crotch strap of the straight jacket between her legs.

&nbsp;

The
boots were knee high with very sensible 3� block heels because, much as I loved
her in sky-high stilettos, they would attract too much attention.�� I guided Mei Ling�s legs into a snug, knee
length leather skirt, pulled it up, closed the zip and tightly fastened the
waist belt.

&nbsp;

Telling
her to open her mouth and stick out her tongue I carefully adjusted the clam
shaped rubber gag behind the tongue studs.�
It was spring loaded but with just enough tension to allow her to easily
close her mouth and keep her teeth together.

&nbsp;

She
had a puzzled look in her eyes as I led her over to the vanity and sat her down
so I could touch up her makeup.� The dark
cherry lipstick with a touch of gloss fitted so well with the deep colour of
her Asian eyes and the shine in her raven black hair.� Several studs in each ear with large, dark
droplet earrings in the bottom piercings completed her look.

&nbsp;

I
detected fear in her eyes as I came back from the wardrobe with her SBR rain
cape and my own long leather coat.

&nbsp;

�I
said we were going to watch a movie kitten, I didn�t say where.�

&nbsp;

Now
the fear became real and I took her in my arms to whisper in her ear.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

�It�s
raining so the cape will be a perfectly natural thing for you to be wearing and
will cover the fact that you do not have the use of your arms.� All you need to do is keep your lovely mouth
closed and nobody, except us, will know about the gag.� Now, do you want to go to the movies or not?�

&nbsp;

I
pushed back on her shoulders until I could look in her eyes.� She studied my face for several long moments
and, I believe, she realized what it would mean to me if she went along with my
game.� She nodded slowly and I kissed her
gently on the forehead then picked up the cape to drape it over her shoulders.

&nbsp;

It
was just below knee length and had a hidden heavy duty zipper from a little
above the hem to her right shoulder.� I
closed that and then buttoned the cape every six inches from her neck down.

&nbsp;

The
hood came up and was held in place with two matching buttons on a neck flap.

&nbsp;

Buttoning
and belting my own leather trench coat I pulled a soft leather floppy brimmed
hat over my hair and tucked the wrists of the kid leather driving gloves into
my sleeves.� Grabbing my handbag and car
keys I led Mei Ling through to the garage, settled her in the car and tightened
her seat belt.

&nbsp;

Once
at the theatre and out of the rain I unobtrusively loosened the neck buttons
and folded the hood back off her head.� I
found us seats with Mei Ling sandwiched against a wall, threw my coat over the
chair next to her and then went back to the foyer for a box of hot buttered
popcorn.

&nbsp;

Teeth
clenched over the gag and lips pursed she frowned at me as I settled in beside
her.

&nbsp;

I
still can�t tell you what the film was about I was so lost in my own space
thinking of other scenarios we could play out with Mei Ling in bondage and in
public; it was wonderfully exciting.

&nbsp;

Something
did finally bring me out of my reflections.�
It was subtle movement that I caught out of the corner of my eye.� With the sound from the movie I couldn�t hear
anything but, without moving my head, I surreptitiously glanced sideways at my
bound and gagged companion.

&nbsp;

Her
right shoulder would come forward a little bit then go back against the seat;
then her left would do the same.� I was
puzzled and it took a while but then I realized she was very slowly moving her
chest back and forth under the cape.� Of
course!� She was rubbing her nipples
against the slick cool lining of the rubber cape.

&nbsp;

My
little pet was placidly watching the movie and trying to get off.� 

&nbsp;

I
leaned over and put my lips against her ear.�


&nbsp;

�If
you cum I will be very angry and you will sleep alone tonight on the floor
beside my bed in a very uncomfortable hogtie.�

&nbsp;

The
movements stopped.

&nbsp;

When
the movie was over I let her follow me out to the lobby and then quickly pulled
up her hood and fastening the neck flap.�
Holding the door I let her proceed me out into the rain and over to the
car.

&nbsp;

When
she was seated and strapped in with the seat belt I climbed in the driver�s
side and opened the glove compartment.�
Taking out two straps I peeled back her hood and buckled one of them
over her lips and behind her head.� Then,
after pulling the hood back in place, fastened the second strap around her neck
with a large D ring just under her chin.�
A piece of cord under her rubber covered knees, through the ring and,
with my hand pushing down on the back of her neck the sleek rubber hooded head
moved down towards her knees.

&nbsp;

�Just
wait �till I get you home.�

&nbsp;

And
when I had got her home I had a marvelous time keeping her so near the edge and
frustrated that she finally screamed at me through the large ball gag.� With that outburst I changed my tickling,
teasing fingers for a vibrating wand that made her explode within moments.

&nbsp;

It
had been a great evening and this one might just match it.

&nbsp;

Mei
Ling had confided early in our relationship that being bound and helpless was
an intense feeling because she loved and trusted me enough to find complete
relaxation and freedom in submission.

&nbsp;

At
first I had a hard time understanding this sub mindset.� While not a professional Domme I had been through
several experiences with submissives, none of them particularly
satisfying.� There had been the pain slut
whose only aim was to get me to be harsh enough to allow her to get off.� Then the one who tried to top me from the
bottom.� The biggest pleasure I got there
was sticking gags in her mouth to stop the flow of annoying suggestions.

&nbsp;

Perhaps
the worst was the high-powered female tycoon who, I finally figured, was just
using our dates and bondage, almost like a business appointment.� It was her excuse for giving up all
responsibility or the need to make constant decisions for a few hours.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

None
of those situations fitted Mei Ling and me but gradually I had put the pieces
together.

&nbsp;

All
her life she had been confined without any say in the matter, first under the
thumb of her Chinese father and then her brother.� The emotional bindings they had put on her
were harsh, unfeeling and without any semblance of love; they were the
restrictions of a culture that, for the most part, treated women like chattels.

&nbsp;

When,
after meeting me, those ties were loosened she reveled in her freedom.� She discovered that our bondage games ALLOWED
her to enjoy submitting not because she had to but because she wanted to.� Our love of leather just added to the mutual
pleasure.

&nbsp;

When
she was bound in leather and straps,�
done by me with love and not based on threats or fear, she could
completely relax and let herself soar to amazing heights.

&nbsp;

Tonight
was special.� It was the anniversary of
the company dinner where we had met.� Mei
Ling put on the same high collared satin dress that had captivated me that
night; she told me it was called a cheongsam.�
We had gone out to dinner with no bondage; just leather coats just to
protect us from the weather and for warmth.�
It was a lovely meal and hardly a word was spoken until, as she finished
a bowl of strawberries and cream, she had asked me to do her a favour.

&nbsp;

�You
are so good with your knowledge of bondage and I want you to make me completely
helpless tonight.� I mean gently but
firmly.� Then I want to feel you holding
me and I will relive the wonders of this last year we have spent together.�

&nbsp;

My
mind went into overdrive thinking about all the gear we had accumulated and
what I would use to grant her favour.� I
looked in her eyes to make sure she was not just doing this for me but for both
of us.� I liked what I read in those
lovely dark eyes.

&nbsp;

�It
will be my pleasure kitten, why don�t we go home and see what happens?�

&nbsp;

I
had chosen the red leather.� Chinese red;
it just seemed fitting to the occasion and almost like a thumb to the nose for
her family and their ill treatment of this lovely, sensitive girl.

&nbsp;

And
so here we were.� Mei Ling was, at this
stage, past the point of being helpless.�
The single boot that encased her legs almost to the crotch was laced
tightly but I had fitted foam pads between her anklebones and the sides of her
kneecaps before I made the long edges of the boot meet.

&nbsp;

Her
upper torso was already encased in a matching red leather throat to hip corset
and before working her legs into the boot I had carefully plugged both of her
lower orifices.� The butt plug and
vibrating dildo were fairly large but also very flexible.� I wanted her to feel the fullness without
being uncomfortable with it.� A pair of
tight red latex panties held everything in place and completed the flow of
colour from her neck to toes.

&nbsp;

Mei
Ling�s kid-gloved hands were clenched into small fists and laced in matching
tight mitts.� I then folded her arms
behind her back and fitted each fist in the hollow of the opposite elbow
strapping them firmly in position.� Her
bent arms fitted inside the leather pouch that I pulled up to her armpits then
ran straps from it over each shoulder, crossed them between her breasts and ran
the ends to small buckles in the pouch at the point of each elbow. 

&nbsp;

That
pulled her arms even more firmly against the back of her torso and removed the
even slightest possible movement. 

&nbsp;

Now
I just had to complete the picture by working on her lovely head.

&nbsp;

It
was a simple sponge but, when cut in half and rinsed in cold water, it made a
very effective, but almost gentle, gag when packed in her mouth.� A strip of rubber went over her teeth under
her lips and was tucked back inside her cheeks.�
A couple of strips of surgical tape across her mouth and I turned my
attention to her ears.

&nbsp;

They
were rubber earplugs, no fancy speakers or other gadgets just plain and simple,
but very effective, sound blockers.�
After tucking her hair inside a tight rubber cap I picked up the
matching red leather helmet with just eyeholes and openings under her nostrils
and carefully laced it down the back of her head.

&nbsp;

Over
the lower laces of the helmet and the top of the body corset I strapped a neck
brace.� It kept her head with the chin
slightly tilted upwards but also had a hard throat protector to make sure her
breathing was not impeded.� I made the
gag strap just tight enough so she would constantly feel its presence.

&nbsp;

After
settling the helpless form on one side of the chair I left her to get changed.

&nbsp;

Mei
Ling�s eyes went wide and literally smiled at me when I returned to pose in
front of her.� The tight black leather
dress and knee boots with 5� heels were the same thing I had worn the morning
after we met.� With my hair brushed until
it gleamed and makeup a little more intense than usual, I knew I looked good.

&nbsp;

Standing
in front of Mei Ling I pulled on the skintight black kid leather gloves to
complete my outfit then reached to the tray on the side table that held one
glass and a chilled bottle of white wine.�
The other item on the tray was the blindfold that would complete her
isolation.

&nbsp;

Gently
I smiled down and leaned forward to kiss the tip of her leather covered nose
then, as she closed her eyes, I settled a wad of soft cotton over each eyelid
and snapped the red leather blindfold in place.

&nbsp;

Sliding
on the chair beside her I slid my gloved hand, making that lovely sound, across
her shoulders and around to cup the taut leather covering her left breast then
activated the recliner mechanism until we were at a comfortable angle.� I felt her shiver.

&nbsp;

Pulling
her against me I made myself relax and stay still.

&nbsp;

I
had used all my skill to make sure her request was fulfilled.� She was blind, deaf, dumb and unable to
move.� But I had not put any strain on
her muscles with the bondage I used to confine her so helplessly.� I had deliberately not made use of any of her
lovely piercings; those were for when we were in different moods.

&nbsp;

Gradually
I could feel the tension leave her body; even through the taut leather that was
evident.� Her breathing through the
nostril holes in the leather helmet became slower and deeper.

&nbsp;

I
sipped a glass of the wine until, after about twenty minutes, I felt a series
of small tremors flow through the leather encased form resting against me.� That meant she was deeply into her sub-space
and I turned the vibrator control to a minimal setting.

&nbsp;

This
would intensify her mental state without being intrusive or harsh.� I would know when she peaked and very slowly
increase the sensation level to help her.

&nbsp;

Tonight
was her night.

&nbsp;

But
it was also mine because it proved to me that the last twelve months had not
been a dream.� It was real, it was the
emotional melding of two souls who satisfied each other�s needs and wants, it
was heaven and it would be, I quietly prayed, forever just �

&nbsp;

Mei
Ling and Me!
