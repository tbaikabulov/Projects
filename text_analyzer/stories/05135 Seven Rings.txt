On Ferunt,
populated with humans, there were five lords who ruled.� They traveled across their kingdoms and ruled
how they saw fit.� The rest of the solar
system knew this, and ruled their own planets and races in much the same
fashion, interacting when necessary, or pleasurable.� Peace, for the most part, governed and most
were left to their own devices.� Rulers
of one planet respected rulers of other planets, and such was the same for
peoples and their rulers.

Ferunt�s
chief leader was Lord Runon.� He owned the southern continent and ruled it
fairly.� He took tithing in the form of
goods, and occasionally made exceptions.�
He had ruled for 3 ages, and his people were happy.

����������������������������������������������� .
. .

�Oh, I guess.� She�s just so damned submissive.� So docile.� She bores me.�� Pinoch sighed,
crossing his arms in front of his body.� Runon stood up from his chair and joined his chief guard at
the screen.� They both watched the image
of the girl he had just picked up.� She
had been tied by ankle and wrist to the ground for two days.� Alternatively being hosed
down with warm water and soap and then hot air to dry her skin.� She still wore clothing, a thin clingy strap
around her waist and chest.� 

�Well, Pinoch,
I don�t always enjoy having to break a resilient spirit.� That�s your forte, I know, but sometimes it
is pleasant to have a different kind of slave.��
Pinoch sighed,

�It�s just . . . never mind, my
Lord.� I serve you and your wishes, I just think you got the short end of the deal
letting her province off just for her.�
You don�t even know if you�ll keep her.�

�You�re right, Pinoch,
she is a risk.� But she�s smart and as
you noted, very docile.� She might be a
valuable addition.� Just leave her in
Sapphire�s hands, and I�m sure even you will think she�s a good choice.�

�Oh, yes, well, Sapphire could make
a mule seem like a prize champion, that�s for sure.�� Runon chuckled,
remembering how Sapphire had convinced him of Pinoch�s
worthiness to be his chief, and of Pinoch�s grudging
admittance of her taste.

�Tell you what, Pinoch,
I promise the next girl will be handpicked just for your tastes. . .�� Pinoch laughed, 

�It�s always such a pleasure to
serve you, Master Runon.�

&nbsp;

Her knees hit the floor and she had
a moment when she fell to see the room.�
In an instant she saw the bed, a large four posted luxuriously made and sturdy, she saw a wall full of whips and other items she
didn�t recognize.� She felt the deep,
rich feeling carpeting on her knees and hands.�
She was lifted by her hair again and the guard grabbed her arm and
dragged her over in front of the bed where there was a large wooden
contraption.� He let go of her hair and
she fell a little.� He wrenched her arm
behind her back and pushed her down.�
Once her face was pushed down into the carpet he put his knee on her
back.� 

����������� �Stay
still.�� He roughly said as he grabbed
both of her arms.� She was so terrified
she obeyed.� She let him pull both of her
arms behind her back and lifted her up.��
His hands were so large they held both of her arms together with a crushing
grip that she knew would leave bruises.�
It was the first time she had been allowed to be standing in two days
and her legs balked.� As she stumbled she
was walked over to the wooden contraption and pushed over it.� She realized that it was designed to
immobilize a person in a half kneeling position.� It had a soft cushion along the length, which
she was pushed over.� She realized that
she would be unable to move at all once she was buckled in and she started to
kick.� Her guard pushed her down and kicked
a lever with his foot.� A bar �came down across
her back and he let go of her.� She could
move her arms and legs but she couldn�t move her middle section without hitting
the bar.� Her stomach was pushed against
the cushion and she started to cry.� The
guard grabbed one hand and she lunged with her other hand, scraping his
cheek.� He laughed and pulled harder on
the arm.� He pulled it down and buckled a
shackle around her wrist and another on her elbow.� He grabbed her other arm and buckled it as
well.� He then went around her laying his
hand on her back as he buckled her legs down as well.� He lifted the bar and replaced the restraint
with a softer strap.� He wheeled the
contraption with a lever and it raised slightly and
she was staring directly at the bed.� She
saw as he walked in front of her that she had drawn blood on his cheek and she
smiled � he saw it and tightened his lips.�


����������� �Have a
good time, slave.�� He said.� He reached down and touched her cheek, �I�m
sure someone will.�

����������� She was
left alone for a while, long enough that her arms and legs started to ache from
being in the same position for so long.�
Then she heard the door open.� She
tried to turn her head, but all she could see was parts of the wooden
restraint.� She saw that it had more levers
and straps and then she saw a perfectly manicured hand rest on the edge near
her head.� She turned her head back and
was startled to see a woman, completely naked, in front of her.� She body was perfect � rounded hips and a
soft stomach, a perfect tan and the skin was accompanied by a scent � sweet and
soft. 

����������� �Oh,
sweetheart, that will never do.� Master
won�t want you to look away.�� She bent
over and looked Melanie in the eyes.� Her
eyes were bright blue, intense and she had long brown hair that was twisted
into a simple braid.� She looked at
Melanie and for a second her glance held a measuring glance and then she smiled
and Melanie saw how beautiful she was.� She
held her face with both hands and kissed the very tip of her nose.� Melanie got a full breath of the perfume and
almost sighed with the intoxicating aroma.�
The woman giggled and practically pranced over to the wall.� She picked up a strappy-looking
item with a wooden big in the straps.�
She bent over again and held the wooden item up to Melanie�s face. 

����������� �Open up,
dear.� You don�t want me to ask more than
once.�� Melanie opened her mouth and the
woman stuck the wooden peg in it, just like a bit on a horse.� Then the straps went around her head and
buckled together.� It was horribly
uncomfortable, and Melanie�s mouth went instantly dry.� Then a pressure on her neck as she realized
the woman had attached the gag to her restraints and was pulling it back.� She had to look at the bed.� Then she started to attach straps to each
side of the wooden rack.� Within moments,
her head was fastened so she couldn�t look at anything but the bed.� 

����������� �All right
then, sweetheart, are you comfortable?��
Melanie made a kind of noise, and the woman laughed.� �Of course, I understand, you can�t really
say anything and you are strapped down like a pig on roasting day, so of course
you�re not comfortable.� I promise you
you�ll get used to all of this if you make the right decisions.� My name is Sapphire.� I am the head slave of Master Runon�s harem.� You
and I are going to have a chat tonight, before the evening begins.� Chat probably isn�t quite the right
word.� I am going to talk, and you are
going to listen.� If you understand all
of that, just give a good little whimper.��
Melanie moaned a little. 

����������� �Good
little girl.� There are some rules you
need to understand.� There are, of
course, many rules here, but we�ll start slow so that you can be sure to
understand.� You are now property of
Master Runon.�
You have no choice in this matter, it has already been decided.� You have been offered as part of your home�s
tithing, and you have been accepted.�
This is all you need to know and all you will know.� Your home is now in the harem of Master Runon.� You will have
many options to decide what kind of home it is, but for now just accept that
you are property and you will have an easier time of it.� The first set of rules are
this:� You will from this day on be
referred to as slave, until Master Runon gives you a
name.� You will learn how to tell the
difference between status and names later.�
You must refer to all those superior to you by
either Sir, or Ma�am but the Master, you will always refer to as Master.� He is not a Sir, he is not a Lord, he is not a Mister.�
He is Master.� Your
Master and you will not confuse him with anyone else.� The last rule is that you must answer all
questions asked of you truthfully.�
Master does not tolerate lies.� Do
you understand all of this, slave?��
Melanie whimpered again.� 

����������� �Good
girl.� You seem like a very smart little
slave, and I have high hopes for you.�
Don�t disappoint me.� I am not a
pleasant girl when I am disappointed.�
Now, just sit and be quiet, and try not to disturb anyone.� Your task tonight is very simple � just be quiet
and still and observe.� I know you�re not
na�ve to sex, but you�re most assuredly not aware of all its variants. �It is a very different life you have in front
of you, so just remember the rules and you�ll have time to adjust.� Do you understand, slave?�� Melanie nodded again.� 

����������� �Good
little girl.�� Sapphire crossed the room
and opened a door.� She reached into the
room and unlocked a leash from the wall.�
She pulled the leash across the room and led the leashed girl over into
the center of the room.� 

����������� �Slave,
this is Ionia.��
Melanie looked at the leashed girl.�
She had a large blue rubber ball in her mouth, which was strapped on her
head and connected to a large collar.�
She back was covered with welts and red splotches and she was also naked
but she had leather shackles on each wrist.�
Her hair was short, clung to her skull and a light brown color.� Her eyes were brown and had large lashes and
her breasts were small but had a pleasant shape.� �Ionia has been
rewarded tonight for her service this past week.� You are going to watch her reward.� Isn�t that right, Ionia
dear?�� The leashed woman nodded and then
leaned forward to kiss Sapphire�s manicured toe.� Sapphire watched her and then petted her on
her head.� �Good girl.� Now, go get my chair.�� She unclipped the leash and Ionia
scurried to the closed and brought out a large, velvet covered chair.� She set it down right next to Melanie.� Sapphire sat down and Melanie could just see
her out of the corner of her eye.� �Okay,
Ionia, we just have a minute, so go and get in
position.� 

����������� Ionia
went back to all fours and scampered across the room to the corner of the
bed.� She lined her self up to the corner
and clipped her own collar to a post in the bed, which Melanie could now see
had a number of clips and straps attached to it.� Sapphire got out of her chair and knelt
beside it as well.� 

����������� The door
opened again, and from behind her Melanie heard the footsteps as Master Runon walked into the room.�
He was tall, and he was wearing just a pair of pants and sandles.� He had
thick black hair, about shoulder length, drawn back into a simple ponytail.� He was muscular without being grotesque.� He went over to Sapphire and pulled her out
of her kneeling position by her hair.� Kissing
her roughly he then laughed.� �So, this
is the new one, yes?���������� 

����������� �Yes,
Master.�� Sapphire said as he let go of
her hair and gestured for her to sit.� He
walked over to Melanie and bent down to see her face.� �Her name was Melanie, Master.�� He looked back at Sapphire, and said �Well,
that name will hardly do, will it?� Let�s
see. . . I think her new name will be Sparrow.�
What do you think?�
����������� �I think the name is perfect,
Master.�

����������� �Good.� Glad we got the business taken care of.� Sparrow, welcome to your new home.� I am your Master, and I�m sure Sapphire will
help you through your adjustment.�� He
turned from her and looked at the bed.

��Now, this is Ionia�s
reward, isn�t it?� She made my guests
feel so at home this past week that she is granted a special treat.�� He reached down and caressed her back,
counting the welts. 

��Seems our guests took to
heart my suggestions for you.�
I�ll have to leave your back alone for a while, my dear.�� Ionia nodded and
raised her back into his caress like a cat.�
Runon chuckled, 

�Always a
pleasure to have you, Ionia.�� He reached down
and unfastened her from the bed.� He
knelt in front of her and reached under her arms to grab a firm breast.� �So, Ionia, how about
some choices tonight, since it is your reward.�
Would you like that gag taken out?��
Ionia was still a moment, and he twisted the
breast in his hand firmly squeezing his hand, Ionia
whimpered a little, and then nodded.� �Oh
good, you are such a pleasure to listen to.��
He stood up and Sapphire moved over quickly to un-strap the gag from Ionia
mouth.� She kissed her and ran her tongue
over her lips.� Then she went back to her
chair. ����� 

����������� �Up on the bed, slave.��
Ionia crawled up onto the edge of the bed and
then went to the center.� Runon reached across and took one of her arms.� He reached up and latched the shackle to the
upper part of the bed post, and then did the same with the other arm.� Ionia was spread arms
wide in a Y shape across the back of the bed, kneeling on the very edge.� The shackles held her wrists high, stretching
her upper body tight against them.� He
grabbed both of her breasts with his hands and caressed them.� She moaned as he massaged them, lightly
teasing the nipples, she cooed.� He bent
down a little and took a nipple in his mouth.�
She moaned again as he suckled it, making sure it was erect and
sensitive.� As he took the other in his
mouth, he gently started to pinch the other nipple and Ionia
started to moan again, softly and sweetly.�
She started to move her hips a little and he could smell the beginning
of her slit-juice starting to flow.� He
stopped his caressing and took two leather straps and wrapped her knees to the
posts, pulling her in a X shape, exposing her inner
thighs and bare pussy.� He walked over to
the wall, full of different instruments and opened a drawer, Sparrow could
barely see him, but she heard the drawer open.�
She was taken aback at Ionia�s sounds and sights,
her moans elicited a twinge in Sparrow�s stomach.� It was clear that she enjoyed what he was
doing, and that he liked her enjoying it.�


����������� Master Runon came back with two small silver cones, the inside of
cones were textured and soft.� He put one
to Ionia�s lips and she licked it so that it was
practically dripping with her saliva.� He
touched it to her nipple and it stayed, attached to the skin.� He did it again with the other cone.� Sparrow saw that Ionia
took a deep breath and shuddered a little.�
Runon then took out a small panel with a
number of buttons on it and laid it across her cleavage.� There was a small sucking sound and it was
clear that the cones fit into this panel perfectly.� It whirred as it powered up and Runon smiled a little.�


�We�ll start small tonight, Ionia,
just clamps I think.�� He pressed one of
the buttons and Ionia yelped.� Her face twisted slightly and then she
exhaled.� 

�Thank you Master.�� She said, in a clear voice, though it wavered
a little.� Sparrow didn�t understand what
had happened but as if magically, Sapphire knew she didn�t understand and
whispered, 

�That�s called a nipple
modulator.� It simulates hundreds of
different sensory modules directly into the nerves of the slave�s nipples from
electric shocks, to clamps, to burns to suction.� Master has just simulated placing a firm
clamp on Ionia�s breast.�
The machine allows him to change the feeling without changing
equipment.� Sometimes he prefers the ease
of having many options at his fingertips without having to move anything.�� Sparrow wracked her brain, but she couldn�t
think of anything that �clamp� could mean in regards to a breast.� She continued to watch, mesmerized and
confused by everything that was going on in front of her.

����������� Runon watched as Ionia sucked in her
breath.� The modulator on her breasts was
imitating a tight clamp and her nipples would soon grow very sore from the
pressure but he had no intention of leaving it at that tonight.� He ran his hand across her stomach, hers was
hard, tight.� It trembled slightly as she
adjusted to the pressure on her breasts.�
He walked over to the wall and selected a heavy flogger.� His guests had done too much damage to her
back for a good whipping, but he was planning on sticking to her front
tonight.� In the back of his mind he
thought about Sparrow�s eyes.� She looked
so sweet trussed up like Sapphire had her.�
He couldn�t have asked for a better selection, or a better
presentation.� 

Ionia
followed him with her eyes as he returned to her and without ceremony drew back
his whip and struck her belly.� She shrieked.� He loved it.�
Her voice was melodic and arched with songlike tone.� In all his possessions, no other slave had a
voice like Ionia.�
From her whimpers to her screams, he liked every sound.� He struck her again, the heavy flogger
slapping her stomach with a thick sounding thud.� She yelped again, shaking in her bonds.� He struck her again, and again.� She thrashed a little and tears started to
well up in her eyes.� He strode over to
her. 

����������� �Open.�� She opened her mouth.� He placed the handle of the flogger in her
mouth.� Then he tightened her bonds at
the wrists and knees, they were a little loose for what he had in mind.� He took the flogger from her mouth and kissed
her.� 

�Better,
darling?�� He asked. 

�Yes, Master, thank you.� she
sighed as he dropped his hand from her cheek. 

����������� ��You�re welcome.�� He then stepped back and started to flog her
again.� She pulled back, but the
tightened bonds kept her from moving more than an inch.� He worked up and down her stomach and upper
thighs, and she continued to yelp and cry as he covered her whole front with
angry red marks.� By the time he was done
she was panting and covered with sweat.� ����������� 

����������� Sapphire
leaned again to Sparrow and said �Our Master likes the different eras of
implements.� He enjoys modern tortures
just as much as ancient ones.� To mix
stimulants of the mind and stimulants of the eye pleases him.� I know you don�t understand all of this, but
you will.� Some items will be explained
to you, and others you will learn for yourself later.�� Sparrow�s mind started to grasp that Ionia�s
fate, her reward, was all she had to look forward to.� A life of torture and
degradation.� As her mind started
to wrap around this, she was distracted as Ionia started
to cry out again.� She looked again and
saw that Runon was striking her again with the
flogger. �It left bright red marks on her
already red skin and each blow elicited a response from Ionia.

����������� Runon enjoyed beating Ionia.� She was crying so beautifully that it was
such a pleasure that part of him forgot how to do anything but make her scream.� He let almost an hour go by as he switched
from one flogger to a strap.� With some
of his slaves he liked the sex, or the torture, the domination, or the begging,
but with Ionia, it was just hearing those screams. . .torturing her just enough
to keep her screaming. �He went back over
to the wall, hanging the strap back on the wall.� He came back over to her and slid his hands
under the modulator, cupping the base of her breasts with his hands.� She moaned again � it was so easy to change
her tune.� He jiggled them in his hands
for a moment before he tapped the modulator again to change the signal.� She started to moan a little louder, the
modulator starting to add a small electric shock to her clamped nipples.� He kissed her again and ran his hand down
jamming a few fingers into her sopping cunt.� She yowled in pleasure as he started to
finger fuck her.

����������� �Don�t cum,
slut, not yet.�� He roughly ran his hand
back and forth and with the other hand increased the intensity on the
modulator.� She started to jerk back as
the electricity pulsed through her breasts.�
He let it set there for a few moments while he continued his fingers in
and out of her pussy.

����������� �You like
that, don�t you?�� He asked, presenting
his fingers, dripping with her juice.�
She licked and sucked on his fingers,

����������� �Yes,
Master.�� He traced her neck with his
fingers, before shoving his fingers up her dripping pussy again,� 

����������� �What do
you want then?� I can tell what your
pussy wants.�

����������� �I want
what you want, Master.�� She replied
jerking her hips on to his moving hand and jerking back when the pulses in her
breasts shocked her.�� 

Runon
laughed,

��Always the perfect answer
with you, Ionia.�� He reached into
his pocket and pulled out a very small silver cone, that
matched the ones on her breasts.� He
reached it up and she licked it again, making it slick and wet.� It had a long cord coming out of the back of
it and he reached down and placed it between her legs, right on top of her
clit.� Instantly she started to react as
the sensations on her breasts were spread to her clit.� The clamps and electric shocks started and
she shuddered as the pain winded through her, up and down her nerves from her
clit to her nipples.� The modulator made
sure that the jolts were timed randomly, she had no way to prepare for them and
all she could do was react to their slowly growing
intensity.� 

The wall of implements offered many
choices, from the most modern inventions to concoctions borrowed from other
planet�s Lords.� Wanting to stretch her
normal bounds tonight, he didn�t want to inject any artificial stimulants into
her.� Some of the foreign implements
would make a normal brain pass out within minutes without chemical
amplification and often at that intensity screams weren�t always possible.� He chose just a simple strap, thick and
heavy.� He struck the inside of her thighs,
the backs of her thighs, her feet.� Time
passed as he continued, carefully and slowly retracing his steps over her skin
with the new strap.� He stretched it out
as long as he wanted, spending another full hour beating her; each blow was
deliberate, and his strikes intended to invoke the most pain, every so often
increasing the potency of the shocks and pressure on Ionia�s
nipples and clit. �He struck the
stretched tendons in her thighs, the soft flesh below her ass, her stomach
quivering with her breath, ragged from the shocks and the intensity of his
blows. 

He felt his cock straining against
his pants and each sound coming from the pain-wracked body made it pulse and
twinge with pleasure.� Tears streamed
down her face and every couple of seconds when the modulator emitted the pulse
Ionia jolted and cried and yelped as he struck her over and over off timed with
the electricity pulsing through her most sensitive parts so that she was in
almost constant agony.� When her screams
stopped being so strong, and her body was almost sagging in her bonds, he came
back and pushed his hard-on up against her thigh, 

����������� �You feel
that, Ionia?� You
make that happen with that lovely beautiful voice of yours.� I promised a reward, and that you shall
have.�� He unzipped his pants, and took
out an enormous cock.� Sparrow inhaled,
she had never seen something like that.�
He fondled it, rock hard and got up on the bed behind her.� He loosened the knee bonds slightly, and put
a hand on Ionia�s neck.�
She shuddered as another pulse went through her as she tried to rock her
hips back.� He plunged into her and she
moaned, squealing in ecstasy.� He rocked
back and forth, reaming her harshly, as she continued to strain against the
pain.� He fucked her harshly,
make no allowance for her comfort, but reaming in and out of her to his hilt
and the jerking out of her as she gasped for breath.� 

She started babbling, begging for
release - for permission.� He put a hand
on the modulator, and told her she could cum at the same time as he raised the
intensity.� He raised it as high as he
could without giving her stimulants and continued to ram his cock into her
quivering pussy.� Her breath was all that
interrupted her screaming as the pulses turned to a surging current, only
escalating up and down, but never breaking in experience. ��The volts running through her were timed
perfectly with her orgasm and he enjoyed the pulsing of her pussy as he
continued to fuck her shuddering, quivering body.� 

Ionia�s back
stretched as she arched with the pain.�
She started to orgasm and every muscle in her body twitched her hands
clenched and unclenched in their bonds and her neck stretched as she tried to
draw more breath.� The pain from the
modulator was more intense with her orgasm and it felt like her whole body was
on fire from the pulsing.� She felt Runon fucking her and knew he was about to cum, but all she
could do was scream.�


Runon sensed
her orgasm starting to finish in her cunt walls and
knew the modulator would continue the programed
build-up.� Her slit had the best feeling
when it was pure pain that contracted it and not the pleasure-mixed emissions
of her orgasm.� She finished cumming and he pummeled her cunt.� He came as she emitted a blood-curdling howl,
well past her orgasm, piercing torment alone stimulating her body and in the
highest arch of her suffering.� His cum
filling her as her spine reared, her body filled with mind-numbing torturous
electric pulses.� He shuddered as her vagina
contracted around his spent cock.� He
switched off the modulator and Ionia�s whole body fell panting, each breath
drawing a heaving twitter through her lungs and stomach, her tight muscles
exhausted with the exertion of the session, her wrist bonds alone holding her
body upright.� Pulling himself off,
Sapphire crawled over to him, he allowed her to clean his cock off, and then
put his pants back on. �Ionia
was spent, hanging from her bonds, the strength stripped from her with
pain-drenched sweat.� She looked up and whimpered,

�Thank you Master.�

����������� �No, thank
you, slave.� Now, I have business to
attend to.� Enjoy the rest of your night.� Sapphire, please clean her up and have her in
my chambers before the night is out.��
Crossing the room, hips swaying Sapphire fell to her knees in front of
her lord,� Sparrow
realized she hadn�t breathed in a moment, she couldn�t believe what she had
seen and heard.

����������� �Yes,
Master.� Have a pleasant evening.�� Sapphire replied, kissing his feet.� He leaned down and ran a finger down the side
of her face, cupping her chin with his palm.

����������� �Oh, I
will, my pet.�� He blew a kiss back at Ionia,
and left the room.
