Reprogramming Rob

Synopsis:  The Mind Control Sisterhood is a clandestine organisation secretly plotting to bring about a new world order in which women adopt their true role as the dominant sex. Each Goddess is a beautiful, powerful and merciless hypnodomme, an irresistible femme fatale, erotically hypnotising and enslaving men to do their bidding.






Rob liked precision. Rob liked predictability. Rob liked the programmable. It was about being in control.
He pulled the bank balance from his smartphone onto the budget program he had created on his laptop. Not good news, but it was precise. It all tallied up. It did mean, however, he had just enough money to see him through the next two weeks till the end of term, when his parents would release the next tranche of funds. His father was strict on sticking to their arrangement, but Rob couldn&#8217;t complain as it was a generous deal compared to most of his fellow students. And Rob approved of careful financial planning. It was good to plan ahead and control as much as possible. At least money obeyed the rules of logic; not like most areas of life, not like people.
His father was a successful accountant but, rather than following in his footsteps, Rob opted for a Computer Science degree, confident that his specialisation in networks and security could lead to a lucrative career. More than this, for Rob, computer science was all about precision and predictability &#8211; he loved the feeling of power that programming and problem-solving gave him.
A sharp knock shattered his reflection. He looked up from his laptop to see his housemate&#8217;s eager face peering round the bedroom door.
He was friends with Andy simply because they shared a house. In reality, they had little in common. Rob was a fantasy fan &#8211; computer gaming, books, movies, even board gaming. Andy was more into sport. They had computer studies in common, of course. And beer.
�Fancy going out for a pint, mate?�
�Can&#8217;t tonight, Andy. Stony broke till the Christmas break.�
 �I could lend you a little till the New Year.�
�No, you can&#8217;t. You are a crazy man with debts you will never repay this side of graduation.�
�Yeah, me and ninety percent of the student population &#8211; it&#8217;s you that&#8217;s the weirdo. And I don&#8217;t mind a bit of debt. In a few years&#8217; time, we will both be rich tech wizards. Don&#8217;t be so serious &#8211; live a little.�
�Sorry, mate. Can&#8217;t take your money. It would mean I will start next term a bit short if I do. Apart from that, I have work to do.�
�So very serious. You have basically nailed a first &#8211; you can afford to relax a little. Won&#8217;t your old man give you a break on the money front just this once?�
Rob gave a thin smile. �No chance. Apart from the rules, news just out &#8211; marriage number two is on the rocks, so he has my mother and my step-mum and her two brats to support &#8211; and now, of course, he will get skewered in the divorce settlement.�
Andy laughed. �Oh, boy &#8211; no more SMILF for poor little Rob?�
�Poor little Andy, you mean. It was you who lusted after her.�
�Well, she was a hot forty-year-old step-mum, I&#8217;ll give her that.�
�Yeah, yeah. We all know what you would like to give her. Don&#8217;t worry. They are breaking up because my dad is having an affair with someone at work. I expect her to be not only younger, but prettier.�
�Even younger? Brilliant. What age?�
�I didn&#8217;t ask, but from what he said so far, I would guess late twenties. But no, I didn&#8217;t ask him to send a photo, you perv.�
�Your dad, man. He&#8217;s awesome. What age is he?�
�Fifty-two next month,� groaned Rob. �It&#8217;s embarrassing.�
�Is it though? When you are his age I bet you wouldn&#8217;t mind a hot twenty-something to keep you young at heart.�
�Not wrong.�
 �Hey, talking of women, we could go to The Carriage &#8211; might see Sarah there.�
�And that&#8217;s supposed to tempt me? We broke up. We don&#8217;t want to gaze at each other across a crowded student pub with tender feelings of mutual hatred.�
 �Yeah, she dumped you two months ago and you have been a miserable prick ever since.�
�Fuck you.� Rob said amiably. �Why don&#8217;t you ask John to go with you?�
 �God, no. The housemate from hell. I can just about stand him when it&#8217;s the three of us, but the boredom of listening to him all evening on my own? No way. A night in is better than that.�
Andy retreated, leaving Rob thinking about Sarah.
They had only been together for six months. The best thing to come out of the relationship was that he had managed to put his virginity behind him. He wasn&#8217;t too upset when she called it a day, as the relationship was boring for both of them. And she was plain in the looks department, although he had no illusions about himself; he was a skinny geek, no great catch.
But he was clever enough to learn from watching his father. Rob knew that his own attractiveness to women would increase over time as his career brought him more income, wealth and status. A time would come when he had enough leverage to attract sexy women, a time when he would hold the balance of power in a relationship if he played it smart. It was all about being in control!
Until then he would have to accept having less power in relationships with less attractive girlfriends and make the best of it. He had tried to get Sarah to inject some glamour into their love-making. But Rob had never been good at persuading people, particularly girls. Pity people were not programmable. Sarah refused point-blank to wear sexy lingerie or even makeup. She complained he got too many of his preconceptions of sex from internet porn.
Not entirely wrong.
He tapped his keyboard and called up his latest wank website. It was an escort service specialising in elite dominatrices. God, this site was driving him to distraction. These women were so entrancing. But did men actually pay a thousand pounds an hour to be with them?
He had discovered the site two weeks ago. The home page had a tongue-in-cheek business world theme to it: �Do You Need Strict Corporate Governance? Experience Market Domination by Hypnodommes Who Mean Business�. Stunningly beautiful dominatrices graced this and the other openly available web pages. They were fully dressed in sexy �office wear� with no more exposure than a flash of cleavage and perhaps a stocking top. But Rob had found even that stuff a huge turn-on.
The camera angle of the photos was usually from a position lower than the women so they appeared to tower over the viewer displaying haughty superiority in their expressions; immaculately made-up faces of breath-taking beauty looked down domineeringly with utter disdain and an aloof assumption of authority.
A series of pages were made out to be a �Goddesses&#8217; Guide to Power Dressing in the Office: A Teasingly Sensual Takeover of his Intellectual Property�.
There was a section on eyewear where beautiful, hypnotic eyes were framed by elegant eyelashes and stared out from behind large designer spectacle frames. �Accentuate your eyes. Use them to entrance and enchant him. Mesmerise him without mercy.�
Another page displayed massive breasts straining against tight blouses, diaphanous materials revealing teasing suggestions of black lacy bras and Basques struggling to contain gigantic tits. �Overwhelm him with your irresistible breasts. Captivate him with a cleavage he would happily be smothered in. Suffocate to dominate.�
Tantalising upskirt shots, crotches hidden in shadow with an occasional suggestion of panties. Intricate stocking tops supported by suspenders. �Pull him in, creating an absorbing fascination with scintillating stocking tops and suspenders. Pussywhip him into submission.�
There were sections on glossy lips, stocking-clad legs and skirts stretched tight across buttocks.
The footwear page varied from shoe to ankle boot to knee-length boot, all in perfect patent finishes with soaring stiletto heels. �Elevate yourself above him in heels that ensure you look down on the loser. Pierce his peace of mind forever and trample on his self-esteem.�
Rob had spent a week masturbating to these pages before bothering to hack into the exclusive gallery. The site explained that the more explicit VIP photo gallery was only available to clients who had used the escort service. Gaining access had not been as straightforward as he had expected. He initially obtained a guest password that worked in some areas, but not the photo gallery. Next, he thought he had accessed administrator&#8217;s rights only to watch them become inoperable. Finally, he sent an email enquiry and stole the access rights of the dumb employee who responded. Technically illegal, of course, but he was confident the owners of this type of website would not rush to involve the police.
The VIP gallery showed the dominatrices in more explicitly sexual and iconic clothing. Catsuits and corsets made of shiny leather and latex. Knee-high and thigh-high boots, all with punishing high heels. The Goddesses now brandished an assortment of whips, paddles and riding crops with obvious relish. In place of smouldering imperious stares, their expressions were cruel sneers and perfect white teeth bared like a predatory animal about to strike.
Rob regarded this site as his greatest find to date. And this without any real nudity. What was it about dominant women? Like most men, he found the leather and latex arousing and the �toy� weapons stimulating. The suggestion of danger.
This sense of danger was exciting, he guessed, combined with the loss of his precious control and predictability. A power switch. There was a high novelty factor inherent in this fantasy. But he could laugh at the absurdity of finding this type of thing so sexy. He knew these women were only acting; playing a part for profit. The idea of a dangerously dominant woman was simply a fanciful fiction. After all, these sort of women, malevolent sexual predators, didn&#8217;t actually exist; they were a fantasy and nothing more.
 
The sleek black car swept forward, relentlessly seeking its goal, headlights stabbing into the winter night. In response, the darkness opened its maw, yawning with a callous indifference.
Samantha sat in the reclining rear seat of the Mercedes S class, casually flicking through the report on tonight&#8217;s target. It was a short report, a straight-forward case &#8211; a twenty-one year old Computer Science student at Derby University.
She gave a jaded sigh. �Easy meat.�
She was an experienced head-hunter. Some nerdy student offered no real challenge. But she rallied herself, there was still the siren&#8217;s pleasure of seduction, the sensual delight of enthralling an innocent. And tonight was special &#8211; her hundredth acquisition in her seven years with the Sisterhood.
This geek had triggered an alert on one of the Sisterhood&#8217;s bait websites, a site appearing to be an escort service specialising in dominatrices and explicitly targeting rich and powerful businessmen. The exorbitant charge out rate ensured that bookings were only from affluent and influential clients, the type the Sisterhood was interested in meeting. The site did lie about the cost of a meeting, however. If an applicant was deemed suitable material, the price was much higher: his willpower, his mind, his very being.
Her target tonight had managed to hack past a number of barriers to gain access to the VIP photo gallery. This qualified him as a member of the second group of people the site acted as bait for: men with advanced hacking and computer skills, a valuable resource to the Sisterhood. He had been detected, counter-hacked and researched. This research confirmed Rob was skilled and intelligent enough to be of use to the Sisterhood.
Samantha felt the car change direction. Looking up, she could see they were leaving the motorway. They had travelled over two hours from the Sisterhood&#8217;s London base.
�How long until we arrive, Benji?�
�Approximately ten minutes, Goddess.�
�Let me know when we are approaching the street.�
�Yes, Goddess.�
She put the file to one side. By coincidence, the driver assigned to her tonight was one of her own converts, a simple pick-up in a hotel bar back in 2007. Benjamin Swift had been a City banker at a time when the Sisterhood was primarily focussed on amassing wealth and City professionals were attractive acquisitions.
Silly Benji had been an alpha male in his previous life, not inclined to submissive behaviour until he was seduced, drugged and brainwashed by Samantha. His role in finance was exploited until his superiors sacked him after a long series of loss-making �mistakes� which had secretly enriched the Sisterhood. Now, he completely belonged to them; he had distanced himself from his past, any friends or relatives he may have had, and existed only to serve the Goddesses in any way they demanded.
She smiled at the memory. All men were so stupid, so easily beguiled, seduced and enslaved. She particularly loved breaking �strong men�, loved to bring them to their knees. In comparison, tonight&#8217;s task would be disappointingly routine.
This hacker&#8217;s interest in the website indicated some attraction to dominant women, so she would take control of him without the need for hypnotic drugs. He would be recruited into an existing army of computer experts with roles in hacking Sisterhood targets, maintaining system security, and developing more advanced brainwashing programs for future victims.
Enthralling men like this was essential to the Sisterhood&#8217;s long term plans. Samantha and her Sisters were beginning to build a better future for humanity, intent on ushering in a new world order where women would achieve their natural role as the dominant sex. For this to happen, men must be persuaded to embrace their new purpose, to serve and obey their Goddesses. A new age was coming.
�Excuse me, Goddess. We are almost there &#8211; next turn on the left.�
�Good boy. Stop at the corner and wait for me there.�
She didn&#8217;t want her target to see the car as tonight she would be playing the role of a simple barmaid, a dumb damsel-in-distress in need of a brainy computer expert. She chuckled at the thought. Roleplaying was fun.
Samantha opened the customised makeup station built into the car and inspected herself in the mirror. At twenty-five years old, she wore bobbed blonde hair and enjoyed a fresh and flawless complexion, making her look younger than her actual years. She was pretty, yet unimposing with an innocent, angelic face. But behind pale blue eyes lurked a predacious huntress, more demon than angel. She slowly licked her lips. She could almost taste it now.
She stepped out of the car and into the darkness. The winter&#8217;s icy teeth nipped at her cheeks. She adjusted her shoulder bag and took a deep breath. The exhalation released a cloud of water vapour. Hell smoke.
As she walked down the street, the sound of her shoes striking stone rang out into the empty night. Click-clack. Steel heel, leather sole. Click-clack. Hell on heels.
She reached the house. She smiled. That smile. Hell&#8217;s belle.
 
Rob ignored the bell, someone else in the house would answer the door. He heard voices from downstairs, Andy and a female voice. Curious. He closed his laptop to concentrate, remaining seated at the small desk squeezed into his bedroom. Silence. Footsteps on the stairs. Then a knock and Andy stepped in.
�Hey, Rob. Someone here to see you. Needs help with her computer. I offered to do it, but she insisted only you could help her.�
As he was talking a blonde girl inched into view, smiling shyly.
�So, this is Rob. I&#8217;ll leave you in his expert hands.�
When she stepped forward, over her shoulder, Rob could see Andy silently mouth �You lucky bastard.� before closing the door as he left.
She put out a hand. �Hi Rob. I&#8217;m Sam.�
�Uh, hi. I&#8217;m sorry. Who are you?�
�Oh, I&#8217;m no one special. I work as a barmaid at The Fox and another student there said you were the man to come to my rescue.�
�Uh, right. Who?�
�I can&#8217;t remember his name now. We don&#8217;t get a lot of students and he wasn&#8217;t a regular.�
Rob knew The Fox wasn&#8217;t a popular pub with the student population, but he might check it out in future if this is what the bar staff looked like. Very pretty and natural looking. He couldn&#8217;t tell anything about her figure as she wore a heavy winter coat that fell to her ankles.
�Okay. What&#8217;s the problem?�
�I don&#8217;t really know. My laptop. It&#8217;s just, like, running really slow. I mean really slow. And I can&#8217;t afford to pay someone. I hope you don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m cheeky, but this other guy said you would be happy to help.�
�Sure, sure. Let&#8217;s have a look.�
Must find out who that person was and thank him, he thought. She reached into her bag and handed him a laptop with a bright pink casing. Rob opened it on his desk.
�Hey, nice model. This must be pretty new. Uh, do you want to sit down? I only have one chair.�
�Not just now. You sit while you work.�
�So, everything just runs slow?�
�Real slow. Oh, and it does crazy things &#8211; like the internet just closes down for no reason.�
�You&#8217;ve probably got some malware.�
�What?�
�Viruses, maybe other stuff. But it&#8217;s not a problem. I can fix that.�
He started the computer and entered safe mode. As he worked, he watched her out of the corner of his eye as she wandered round the room. Then he noticed the heels, they must have been at least four inches. They made him think back to that website, but Sam was a world away from projecting the dark persona of the dominatrices. When they shook hands she had seemed to be as tall as he was. From what he could see now, she was petite, maybe five foot five? He smiled; cute and short and sweet.
She stopped to examine a poster on his wall. He started to feel embarrassed. It presented a fantasy female warrior: long black hair blowing in the wind, figure-hugging leather armour emphasising an extraordinary body, sword in hand, and a crossbow slung over her back. This was a character from one of his favourite video games and he was worried the poster screamed sad computer nerd.
�Wow! I like it, Rob. Isn&#8217;t she great?�
�You like it?�
�Yeah. She&#8217;s so strong and sexy.�
No argument here. He was surprised and relieved at her reaction.
�Right, I&#8217;ve deleted your temporary files and have started to download a malware scanner. It will take a few minutes.� 
�Thanks. What do you think it is?�
�Don&#8217;t know, but probably a Trojan you&#8217;ve picked up.�
�Trojan?�
�As in Trojan Horse. A piece of software you downloaded because you thought you wanted it, but its intent was really malicious.�
She was standing next to him now.
�Oh, sneaky. Something that looks very attractive but in reality is out to harm you, take control even?�
He looked up into her soft blue eyes. She looked so pretty and uncontrived. He wasn&#8217;t any good with pretty girls &#8211; they always seemed to have some sort of artifice going on, always two steps ahead of him. Sam appeared to be a refreshing change.
A short knock and the door opened quickly. Andy&#8217;s head appeared.
�Making a brew run &#8211; can I get you guys anything?�
�No thanks,� Samantha answered quickly. �We are doing just fine.�
There was a chill in her tone of voice, sharp and clear and cold as crystal. Then, to his surprise, Rob felt her hand rest on his shoulder and give it a gentle squeeze. He saw Andy pause for a second, eyes widening, before he retreated with a sing-song �Okay.�
Her touch was delicious and distracting, but he was at a loss as to what he should do or say. The laptop pinged to indicate the download was complete and he gave a little startled jump. She giggled, but didn&#8217;t take her hand away.
�Um, well, it&#8217;s ready. We can do a quick scan or a full scan &#8211; that takes a bit longer, of course�
�We&#8217;d better do it properly, if you don&#8217;t mind. If you can bear to stand me for that long.�
He started the scan. Finally taking her hand off his shoulder, she leaned down and whispered in his ear, so close he could feel her breath play exquisitely against his skin and hair.
�This has been very kind of you. Now, Robbie, I want you to go to your door and push the bolt across so we don&#8217;t get any more unwelcome interruptions.�
Sam straightened up and waited for him to do as he was told. He looked at her. Why was she asking him, no, telling him to do that? She was smiling at him in a relaxed manner, giving no clue as to what she might be thinking. As he walked to the door, his body was tingling with anticipation. Stupid, he told himself, nothing is going to happen here. She has been charming because she wanted a favour and she is probably a bit of a prick-tease &#8211; most pretty girls were in his experience.
He fumbled with the tiny bolt; it had never fitted properly. Finally, it slid into position. Turning back to her, he failed to suppress a gasp of astonishment. Sam had slipped off her coat and held it to the side in one hand, the other hand resting on her hip. She wore a wrap-around sleeveless red leather dress, tied at the waist with a large bow. What a figure! The fabric clung to her well-rounded breasts and the plunging neckline displayed a glorious cleavage.
�Uhh,� said Rob.
�Why, thank you. I assume you like?� She ran a hand down the front of the dress.
�Um,� Rob nodded, �Um, shall I take you coat?�
�Oh, yes please. After all, you know better than me where you want to put it, I&#8217;m sure.�
Heat rising in his cheeks, he took the coat and folded it over the back of his chair. Now she was sitting on his bed. Her legs were crossed, the knee-length dress parting to reveal shapely legs. She patted a space on the bed next to her.
Rob coughed nervously as he sat down. What was going on here? Why was she dressed so spectacularly? Was she going on to a club or party later? That must be the answer.
�Do you have a girlfriend, Robbie?�
Why is she calling me Robbie? No one calls me that. Was it condescending? Was this just a big tease? Frustration rose to counter his attraction for her and he let his temper slip.
�Had one till recently. But not just now. Your point is?�
�Don&#8217;t snap at me, Robbie. It is not acceptable to talk to me that way.�
He cursed himself for his stupid reaction. What was he thinking? This woman was a dream come true. Even her perfume was seductive, sweet and intoxicatingly sensual. He should simply enjoy her company, even if it lead nowhere.
�Sorry,� he mumbled.
�That&#8217;s okay. Whatever the reason for the break-up, I&#8217;m sure she wasn&#8217;t woman enough for you, if you know what I mean.�
Certainly wasn&#8217;t a woman like you, he thought. He couldn&#8217;t help a quick glance towards her chest. Back to her eyes, fool.
�Well, maybe I&#8217;m not the ideal man either.�
�Don&#8217;t sell yourself short. You have a lot going for you. What do you think girls find attractive?�
�Good looks. Muscles. Money. All the things I have none of.�
�Yes, all of those. And brains. And humour. And kindness. Kindness is my favourite. And you have been very kind to me tonight. You have done everything I wanted you to and I like men who do what I want them to.�
�Okay.� She was definitely flirting, but what was he supposed to say, to do? He was useless at this.
She continued. �Now, men &#8211; they are a lot more predictable and simple than women when it comes to attraction. It is very much about looks for men. Let me show you something that will change the way you see women forever. Would you like that? I guarantee you will like it.�
�Okay, I guess.�
�Right. Look directly at me and tell me what you see.�
They were sitting right next to each other, almost touching. He was happy to take this opportunity to stare at her intensely, being careful not to let his gaze fall directly to her magnificent cleavage. His peripheral vision was working overtime and he could sense how her breasts pushed against and stretched the fine leather fabric of her dress.
�Well, you have very pretty eyes and nice skin,� he started. Before he could continue, she placed a hand on his thigh and something like an electric shock shot through his body.
�You are so very kind, but there is an element of artifice.� Artifice? She seemed different from his first impression &#8211; she seemed smarter, more articulate. Strange.
She continued. �I have nice blue eyes, I&#8217;ll grant you, but I have discreetly enhanced them by primping my lashes so they are thicker and curlier. My skin is nice, but there is a subtle veneer of foundation to make it look just perfect.�
�Right.�&nbsp; Where was she going with this?
�These are understated ways of making me more attractive to men, and all men are attracted almost entirely by looks. I can be a lot less subtle and a lot more effective. By a lot more effective, I mean a lot higher impact. By a lot higher impact, I mean blowing a man&#8217;s mind entirely and taking control of his thought processes.�
What was she saying?
She reached down into her bag lying on the floor and pulled out a hand mirror and a lipstick.
�Now, lipstick might seem like an ordinary everyday thing. But in fact, at a subconscious level, it speaks to men directly and powerfully about sexual attraction. All men are turned on when an attractive woman wears lipstick. You have no choice. The colour and moisture mimics sexual arousal in the woman and causes sexual arousal in all men. It&#8217;s a sneaky trick used by clever women to control what you think and feel. I can show you this by putting on this lipstick and simultaneously speaking to your subconscious mind.�
She twisted the silver case and a rich red tip slowly emerged. She waved it slowly under his nose.
�Even the smell, Robbie. It&#8217;s so dreamy. Smells like roses, don&#8217;t you think? So dreamy. It just soaks into you and makes everything dreamy.�
It did have a sweet flowery scent. He was vaguely aware that Samantha was holding the lipstick under his nose for a long time, the word dreamy reverberating through his mind. Then she moved it deliberately towards her mouth.
�This is my favourite bit &#8211; how it feels on my lips, so creamy &#8211; creamy and dreamy.� She applied the deep red colour to her lower lip. �And men love to watch how this little red stick brightens a woman&#8217;s mouth. It&#8217;s so phallic, and you love it when a woman&#8217;s lips look red and aroused.� She coated her top lip. �It arouses you to see how naughty and sexy a woman looks with lipstick on, like a sexy slut. You can&#8217;t help but imagine how her other lips would look when aroused and swollen with pleasure. You can&#8217;t help but imagine your own hard cock against my aroused swollen lips.�
She pronounced imagine with a breathy urgency, firing his imagination. Rob could feel his cock get stiffer and stiffer. He was hot and blushing, unable to move or speak, frozen like a rabbit in the headlights of her juggernaut of sex.
�Notice how you can watch the lipstick go round and round my lips and, at the same time, watch the reflection in this magnifying mirror. That&#8217;s right. This mirror enlarges everything many times &#8211; enlarges your fascination, enlarges your pleasure, enlarges your arousal until it totally engulfs you. It is like a dream come true &#8211; a very naughty sexy dream, you lucky boy.�
He was fully erect now, his cock pressing furiously against his jeans. Enraptured by Samantha&#8217;s lips, he was unconcerned by the conspicuous bulge.
�And as you watch the lipstick go round and round my beautiful mouth, you see my lips colour deeper and deeper. Go deeper and deeper for me, little Robbie, deeper into this wonderful dream. And you get harder and harder for me, don&#8217;t you?�
Rob blinked and tried to swallow but his mouth was too dry. This was crazy, wasn&#8217;t it? Things like this didn&#8217;t happen to him. To anyone. A part of him wanted to question what she was doing, but his mouth was so dry, he struggled and failed to form the words.
�Oh, don&#8217;t worry, little Robbie. I really want you to be hard. And you can see how this little lipstick is a powerful trick to control what you are thinking and what you are feeling. I have even taken control of how your body reacts because I did intend to make you hard. You see, you are biologically programmed in such a way that an attractive woman can take complete control over you. And if they know what they are doing, then there is no limit to how far they can control you. There is no limit to how far I can program you to my own ends.�
She reached out and gently touched the bulge in his jeans. He gasped.
�All men should be hard in the presence of a beautiful, powerful woman. That&#8217;s how it should be, my little pet. I mean, what good is a soft cock to a woman? None at all. Isn&#8217;t it your duty to be hard in the presence of a beautiful and powerful woman?�
He nodded. Yes, that seemed to make sense. After all, she was so beautiful and she had made his cock so hard it felt like it might explode. His head was spinning.
�And you will always be hard in my presence, little Robbie. You will always be hard just thinking about me. And you will always be thinking about me, always dreaming about me. This is like the most sexy, the most compulsive dream you can imagine. Because I am the most beautiful, the most important thing in your life. I am your Goddess. What am I?�
She ran her thumb down his cock and gently pressed the head. Exquisite. She run her tongue slowly across her top lip.
�Your Goddess,� she prompted.
�My Goddess.�
�You are such a good little boy. Let me help you out.�
Rob was transfixed by her mouth, deep red lips parted to reveal a moist pink tongue playing across perfect white teeth. As he stared at her, caught in a sensual trance, she slowly undid his belt, slipped his cock out and gently ran her soft hand up and down the shaft.
�I am your Goddess and you will be hard for me all of the time &#8211; in a wonderful state of exquisite longing, of excruciating pleasure. And all you have to do to earn this wonderful existence is to be kind to me and do everything I ask of you. You can do that, can&#8217;t you? Don&#8217;t speak, just nod. Good boy.�
She puckered her lips and kissed the air softly.
�Now I need you kneeling in front of me so you can have the proper perspective on what I am going to tell you next.�
She slipped her hand from his cock to grip his balls. She pulled on them firmly to guide Rob from the bed down to the floor, then released him. On his knees, he gazed up at Samantha. He felt disorientated; a dream-like sense of unreality pervaded his mind. Lost in a confusing yet compulsive reverie, Rob was unable to think clearly, his body and mind dominated by animal arousal.
He swallowed and licked his lips. He wanted this to continue, but he also wanted to play an active part. He should say something. Before he could form the words, she extended a leg and rubbed the tip of her shoe up and down the shaft of his cock. He groaned with pleasure, moving his hips gently to heighten the sensation.
�You like that, little Robbie, don&#8217;t you? I bet you love my shoes &#8211; how glossy they look, how hard they feel on your cock. This is your reward for being such an obedient little pet. Now, would you like to feel the heel?�
�Yes,� he croaked.
�Yes, Goddess.�
�Yes, Goddess.�
She thrust the heel forward, the point grazing the base of his cock and lodging in his ball sac. He gave a cry of pain.
�Always Goddess, you naughty boy. Goddess or my Goddess or Goddess Samantha. Please don&#8217;t ever forget.�
She pulled her foot away. As she spoke, he was mesmerised by her appearance: full red lips slightly parted in a superior smile, her pale blue eyes, her magnificent figure.
�Now, I&#8217;m worried that you may have blemished my beautiful shoe with sweat or even some icky pre-cum. Can you have a look?�
In an erotic trance, he could not think critically; everything she said seemed so true, seemed so right. He leaned forward and peered at the shoe, patent black pumps with red soles. He automatically reached out a hand to take hold of it.
�No hands!�
He froze. �Sorry � my Goddess.�
�No touching without permission. Well? Is it marked?�
�I&#8217;m not sure, my Goddess.�
�Of course you&#8217;re not sure, you fool. You had better lick it clean just to be certain then.�
She waggled the sharp tip of the shoe at his face. He hesitated. Through the warm fog of pleasure and lust, he heard a distant and weak voice calling out a warning. Did he really want to be treated like this? How far would she ask him to go?
�Do it for me now, little Robbie,� she urged him in a breathy voice. �Lick it for me.�
She ran her tongue round her painted lips. �You want to lick it, don&#8217;t you?�
She smiled at him warmly, nodding encouragement. This woman was overwhelmingly sexy and beautiful. He would do anything to please her. He lowered his head to the shoe.
The aroma of animal leather blended with the sweet and pungent chemicals of polish: the scent of submission. He licked the sharp tip, top and bottom.
�Good boy. Now, you may kiss the heel.�
Sharp and metallic.
�And my ankle.�
The soft gossamer fabric of her stocking felt like heaven on his trembling lips.
�And further up, slowly, with small gentle kisses.�
She pulled her skirt open to reveal her stocking tops, suspenders disappearing into the cradle of her thighs.
�That&#8217;s it, little Robbie. But slower &#8211; don&#8217;t rush. And stop there &#8211; the knee is far enough for you just now. Imagine a life in which you are allowed to reverently kiss a Goddess, on the foot most days, but on occasions much more than that. You will be trained in how to fully please a Goddess with your tongue very soon, but tonight we have other priorities.�
She rose from the bed.
�Undress and wait on the bed while I prepare something very special for you.�
He did as she told him, watching Samantha as she worked on the pink laptop. Through the haze of lust and wonder, a semblance of rational thought was returning. Through his mesmerised state, he started to question what she was doing on the computer, question what she was doing here in his room, question what she doing with him.
She turned from the laptop and crooked a finger to summon him. �Now, Robbie, crawl over here &#8211; on your hands and knees, that&#8217;s a good boy.�
Rob&#8217;s head was throbbing from rushing blood, but his brain somehow made a connection to the website he had been viewing. Was it possible she had something to do with those women? Had the virus on her laptop been some sort of ruse?
�Um, look, Sam�I mean Goddess. I&#8217;m not sure what&#8217;s going on here. I mean, I think��
For a moment Samantha looked puzzled before smiling broadly. �Don&#8217;t think, Robbie,� her tone was sweet as honey. �It only confuses you. Let the instinctive part of your brain tell you what you want. Let your cock tell you what you must do.
�I did not expect resistance from you, little Robbie. But that&#8217;s fine. It is more fun when a man tries to fight his natural instincts. So let me give you some more incentive.�
In one movement, she stood up, undid her dress and let it fall to the floor. She was gloriously naked aside from her stockings, suspender belt and shoes, her body toned and tanned.
�Look at me, all naked and vulnerable before you. The animal part of your brain is so hungry for me. You must have me. Come to me now, on all fours, like the hungry wolf you are.�
He slid off the bed and made his way towards her.
�Good boy. That&#8217;s my little doggie. I love to see a man on his hands and knees for me &#8211; it is such a turn-on.�
She caressed herself; one hand on her pussy, the other cupping a breast. He stopped at her feet, gazing up at her magnificent form.
�You will be a good little puppy for me, won&#8217;t you? Of course you will. And like a little puppy, you will be devoted and obedient.� She spread the lips of her pussy with two fingers. �Would the little puppy like to smell something nice? Come on, Robbie, you know you want to.�
Rob raised his head to her pussy, his nose a fraction from her closely cropped hair. He breathed in deeply, absorbing the sweet musky aroma.
It was so hard to think clearly. So hard. It was easier simply to accept everything her hypnotic voice suggested to him.
Samantha leaned down and cupped his face in her hands and brought her lips slowly to his, pausing for a second, before kissing him softly. She kissed him again, briefly letting the tip of her tongue play inside his mouth. 
�Does that taste nice?�
�Yes, Goddess.�
She pulled his face into her cleavage to surround him with her soft flesh and fill his breath with her intoxicating perfume. She held him there for what seemed like an eternity; one of her hands on the back of his neck held his head between her breasts and the other gently ruffled his hair.
�There, there, Robbie. You can trust me to look after you. Just let go of all your thoughts and give yourself to me. Just let go.�
He was lost in her. Her beauty, her irresistible voice, the taste of her kiss, her scent and the unbearable softness of her touch. He was assaulted through every sensory doorway.
She pulled away and gently guided him onto the seat. She pulled a pair of pink headphones from her shoulder bag and moved to place them on Rob.
�Once you view what is on this computer, there is no going back. After this, you will become a thrall to me and other Goddesses, my Sisters. You will have nothing but absolute love and devotion for your Goddesses, nothing but total obedience to your Goddesses.�
Goddesses. In this moment he realised they truly were Goddesses. He saw it. Dark Goddesses. Somehow, through the blinding heat of his lust and need, through the confusion of his trance state, he suddenly saw the reality. The danger was clear. The danger was real.
He twisted his head away. �Please�no.�
She laughed gently. �Little Robbie, you surprise me. I did not anticipate a fight from you. Anyone who takes the trouble to hack our website tends to be more naturally submissive than this. Not to worry. I do love it when a man tries to resist me &#8211; it makes me feel much naughtier and sexier.�
She knelt in front of him, taking hold of his straining cock. She slowly licked the engorged head, fixing him with her large blue eyes.
�I am going to suck that last bit of willpower out of you, little Robbie. You are going to give it up for me. And when you come for me, that tiny remnant of resistance will wither and die. Of course, you could stop me now, if you want. Do you want to stop me?�
She gave the tip of his cock a loud wet kiss. No, don&#8217;t stop, Rob screamed in his head. This is heaven.
Samantha smiled. �You want more, don&#8217;t you?�
She took the head of his cock into her beautiful red mouth. Rob watching her work up and down his shaft. The sight took on a magnetic quality. Her deep red lips, her soft blue eyes never leaving his and the absorbing feel of her hot, moist mouth combined with the expert flicks and swirls of her tongue round his cock. She was slowly sucking away all his willpower, but he no longer cared. He must have this, at any cost.
His hips started to buck. She pulled her head away.
�Almost there, little Robbie. I love how weak and passive a man becomes after he cums. As your cock gets soft, so does your mind &#8211; so soft and pliable. You will be in a contented stupor, open to all the programming the Sisterhood has in store for you.�
She stroked his shaft rapidly with the lightest of touches.
�Give it all up for me, Robbie. Give me everything you have got.�
The physical urgency was building with an inevitable force. Rob gave a hoarse cry as he came, a stream of cum spouting into the air and falling back onto his chest and belly. There was an explosion of bliss in his brain, annihilating any remnants of resistance.
She laughed with delight as she stood up. �There we go. Good boy. Now slip the headphones on and we can start your programming.�
She tapped the keyboard. Drained of critical thought, Rob watched passively as an image of Goddess Samantha appeared on the computer screen, smiling sweetly.
�Welcome, my little pet.� The words flooded into Rob&#8217;s head, seeming to come from all around him and penetrating every part of his consciousness.
Her image remained on screen, partly obscured by swirling colours forming into the word. �BEAUTY�. He heard the word echo through the headphones, followed by another soft feminine voice urging him to repeat the word.
�Beauty,� he mumbled.
Now, one sexy image came into view and faded to be replaced by another then another: glossy lips, bulging breasts, long legs, shapely buttocks. Image after image accompanied by an all-enveloping binaural beat that made it impossible to think. He could only absorb, absorb what flowed into his eyes and ears. His limp cock started to grow and stiffen.
The pulsing letters on the screen changed. �BEAUTY IS POWER�.
Urgent sexy voices repeated the message through the headphones; �BEAUTY IS POWER�. Softer voices instructed him to repeat the phrase.
�Beauty is power,� he echoed.
The images started to change to glamorous dominatrices wearing stiletto boots and brandishing riding crops, whips and paddles. He was already completely hard again. A new word appeared on screen.
�OBEY.�
He felt his body weaken at the command. Sound and vision inundated his mind. One Goddess after another appeared, each dressed in explicitly dominant clothing. Sometimes they stalked between a number of naked men, who knelt helplessly before them and gazed heavenwards in adoration. Like these men, the only taut, powerful part of Rob&#8217;s body was his painfully erect cock.
�OBEDIENCE IS PLEASURE�, he was instructed.
A surge of sensuality and subservience swept through his body and mind, penetrated the core of his being. He was now completely receptive as the program fed him submissive belief after submissive belief.
 
As Rob waited for his computer to start up, he looked out on the small courtyard from the second floor window. A lonely tree and a few shrubs were blooming in the July sunshine. He and his colleagues worked in an open-plan office chilled by an air-conditioning system. Its constant hum competed with the noise from the banks of servers that occupied half of the floor space.
There was a beep from his smartphone that told him he had a text message. Two phones lay on his desk. The pink one was for Sisterhood communication only and if the alert had been the delicate chime of a Sisterhood text, he would have been filled with excitement. But it was merely the phone that he used for what little was left of his personal life.
Over the last seven months, Rob had dispensed with all the unimportant parts of his life. With the exception of his immediate family, he was no longer in touch with any of his friends from his old life, and all his meaningless hobbies from that life had been dropped. Now he was focussed on service and obedience; he had a higher calling.
The text was from his mother, checking that he was still visiting home the coming weekend. It was his birthday, she needlessly reminded him. Of course, his parents were unimportant too, but the Goddesses had explained he was to maintain minimal contact for some years to ensure they did not become too concerned and start investigating his lifestyle. This meant he had to visit them two or three times a year. Depressing, but it was what the Goddesses wanted of him, so it had to be done. He typed a short reply to his mother.
Apart from these interruptions, his life was bliss. Twelve hours a day, seven days a week, he served the Sisterhood with his computer skills. This was made easier by the fact that he, and all the other men, ate and slept in the building. The food was good and healthy, and there was even a gym in the basement used during the mandatory one hour work-out for all. The Goddesses explained that the men were precious to them and that they wanted them to have a long healthy term of service.
His life was filled with his love of the Sisterhood, overflowing with a meaning and purpose he could never a dreamed of before Goddess Samantha opened his eyes to the truth.
He logged in and started the duties that would occupy his day, the team was upgrading the network security. This was work he could be proud of because it served the Sisterhood. During his long work day, he fought through persistent daydreams to complete his tasks well. Visions of the divine kept him hard every waking hour and made it difficult to concentrate. The reinforcement programming had fetishized every aspect of sexy dominant women in Rob&#8217;s mind. Their eyes, lips, breasts, buttocks and
 legs, together with their attire of leather, lace and vinyl. He longed for the parts of the day when Goddess Lucinda would visit this floor for a few minutes, and maybe ask a question or whisper a word of encouragement. Yesterday, she had trailed the fingertips of one hand across his shoulders as she walked by.
Rob watched the reinforcement program each morning and evening. The Goddesses were so generous and merciful that every evening the program would allow him to masturbate to completion. At this thought, a tear of gratitude escaped down his cheek. He wiped it away. Must concentrate. This was straightforward but important work.
And after all, Rob liked precision and predictability. More than this though, Rob loved being programmed. It was about being controlled.
