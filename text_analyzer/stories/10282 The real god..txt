SAMANTHA

1

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was a relatively slow day at the shopping center where Sam worked, fucking BuyCheap, she hated it.&nbsp; Although the money was good and she was a higher ranking employee than most.&nbsp; All she really had to do help out the grunts; the shelf stockers, the cashier, even sometimes the backroom away from the customers.&nbsp; It was still BuyCheap though.&nbsp; A bloodsucking corporation if she ever saw one.&nbsp; Barely ever gave back to charities, the community, or even the employees.&nbsp; They sure loved to announce every time they did though and pretend like they were the god send of the world.&nbsp; What Sam wanted more than anything was to own her own business; be good to the employees, help people with the money it earned, and be admired by the world as a role model.&nbsp; That would never happen as long as she was stuck here.&nbsp; As long as she was stuck here she'd be a slave to evil corporate America forever.&nbsp; The money was good but she was on the precipitous of being stuck in this shit hole forever.&nbsp; Assistant manager is the next step and once you become one it's almost as if you're glued to the company.&nbsp; Her company would be started soon enough and it would be awesome.&nbsp; Free food and drink to employees, a game room to relax, even work from home options;&nbsp; It'd be just as awesome as Google.&nbsp; Technology was always her strong suit and she loved people.&nbsp; Entrepreneurship just seemed natural.&nbsp; Over the past several months she'd researched the prospect;&nbsp; how much money was needed, how it would go about being started, what paper work would need to be filed.&nbsp; Maybe a few more months of research and she'd be ready to actually start building a business up, then she could quit, for good.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sam would do good in business, hell she would do good in life.&nbsp; She was nice, caring, sweet and stunningly cute.&nbsp; With very dark, almost black, brown hair that went just past her shoulders, to die for eyes, and coming in at about a perfect height of 5'10.&nbsp; She wasn't a girly girl but not a tom boy at all.&nbsp; Her walk had a sort of lightness to it, almost as if floating on air.&nbsp; Her skin was a smooth pale but not a ghostly white.&nbsp; Her normal work outfit consisted of a deep blue t-shirt that was slightly large and khaki pants that were also slightly baggy.&nbsp; The slightly larger than normal clothes hid most but not all of her curves.&nbsp; Despite having a medium chest size and the oversized shirt, her chest was still relatively visible pressing against the inside of her shirt. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;*crackling sound* Sam? Sam, register 22 needs assistance with a difficult customer.&nbsp; Her walkie, it was Sean, her co-worker.&nbsp; He was a nice guy, decently handsome, and a hard worker.&nbsp; She'd been out with for drinks with him a few times along with other people.&nbsp; They were only friends though.&nbsp; She had never thought of them any other way and neither did he.&nbsp; She grabs the walkie: �alright I'm headed there now�.&nbsp; �Hi, what seems to be the problem sir?� she said with a smile as she approached register 22. �Well! Your cashier here refuses to except my coupons!�.&nbsp; The male cashier stated �he is trying to use 3 coupons for one product, Sam�.&nbsp; �Sir, our policy states you may not use more than one coupon per product.� The customer looking baffled as if a religious minister just cussed him out replied with �Fine! I'll just take my business across town and your boss will hear about this, Sam�. Saying her name only as a repeat of the cashier.&nbsp; After the customer left Sam looked at the cashier; �don't worry, you didn't do anything wrong� reassuring the cashier.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sam, grabs for her walkie: *crackling* �Hey Sean, cover for me? I'm about to go on my break.� Sean replies �Sure, stop over at customer service first someone just called for you�.&nbsp; While walking over to customer service she wonders: Who would call for me?&nbsp; In the 5 years working for BuyCheap no one has ever needed to call me at work.&nbsp; If anyone important needed to get a hold of me they would just text.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Hello?� The voice on the other end replies: �Hello Sam, I have left you a note on your car window.&nbsp; Please read it on your break� *click*. Sam was confused.&nbsp; What the.. fuck? Did the lady on the other end get disconnected? Even so it was creepy.&nbsp; But the voice seemed so sweet and innocent, almost delicate.&nbsp; It wasn't like a BuyCheap version of the movie Scream.&nbsp; Sam going on her break anyway decided to stop out and check the supposed note.&nbsp; She was a little creeped out but its not like anything would happen to her; she was in the middle of a very busy parking lot.&nbsp; Once reaching her 2012 Chevy Camaro Convertible, Black pearl, slightly dirty but still a beauty in the sunshine.&nbsp; Tucked neatly under the driver wiper blade was a light pink, cleanly folded piece of paper.&nbsp; At the top read FROM THE OFFICE OF GOD. Huh?&nbsp; It continued� Sam, you have been chosen.&nbsp; Go inside and let them know you don&#8217;t feel good. Leave work early.&nbsp; Then drive to this address: and it listed it.&nbsp; If you don&#8217;t you will instantly feel a pain in your stomach.&nbsp; Sam was stunned.&nbsp; What the fuck was going on? Who created this note? Now she was getting scared.&nbsp; Is this some kind of prank?&nbsp; It was probably best just forgot about and ignored.&nbsp; Deciding to just put the note in her pocket as brush it off as a joke.&nbsp; She felt like skipping the rest of her break and just going back to work.&nbsp; Work, although boring, felt safe right now.&nbsp; Heading inside work continued as usual.&nbsp; Less than 5 minutes later the worst stomach cramp imaginable began shooting through her stomach.&nbsp; Oww! Bending over and grabbing her stomach.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;10 seconds later Sean and another co-worker came running over: �Sam are you OK?�&nbsp; Samantha! Look at me, are you alright?&nbsp; She could barely breathe.&nbsp; Whoever was behind that note must have poisoned her.&nbsp; �I'm fine� she proclaimed.&nbsp; �are you sure?� Sean asked. �yea, just a stomach cramp�.&nbsp; Sam began walking to the door and said �I've gotta take the day off, I'm sorry�.&nbsp; The other co-worker and Sean said almost in unison: �no problem, go to the doctor�.&nbsp; Almost immediately the stomach pain let up.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While driving home she pulled the note out of her pocket and reread it.&nbsp; This address was about half way between her home and work.&nbsp; As she passed the street that would have been her turn if she did wanna go to this mysterious address her stomach began hurting again.&nbsp; Slightly at first then with every passing block it became unbearable.&nbsp; Why was this happening?&nbsp; Taking the next right it began to let up a little then it let up quite a bit.&nbsp; Then it clicked in her head; she was heading toward home but also slightly toward the mysterious address.&nbsp; The closer to the address she got the less pain she had.&nbsp; Having no choice she started heading directly for the address if she wanted relief from the pain.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upon arriving at the address she saw a huge uptown office building.&nbsp; This place didn't look disturbing, scary, or any other frightening adjective you wanted to use.&nbsp; It actually looked quite pleasant and upscale.&nbsp; She hadn't been in this section of town in quite some time.&nbsp; There was no need to, all there was around here was office and business space with nothing really being consumer oriented.&nbsp; Pulling over and parallel parking in front of the building she wondered, what was going to happen to her?&nbsp; This all seemed safe but the whole principle surrounding this was almost from the twilight zone.&nbsp; She was forced to come here by an unimaginable pain in her stomach.&nbsp; Getting out she pushed the door to her Camaro shut and clicked the lock button on the key fob.&nbsp; Walking a few steps, she paused, her better judgment took over.&nbsp; She turned around and was walking back to her car.&nbsp; The pain came back, she didn't care, she reached for the car door handle.&nbsp; Right as her fingers touched the handle the pain got so bad it crippled her.&nbsp; She grabbed her stomach hard and crawled to the front of the car, the pain easing as she crawled away from the car.&nbsp; Now there was no choice.&nbsp; If she didn't go inside and find out what was going on she would be feeling like this forever.&nbsp; Walking through the giant crystal clear glass doors she was overwhelmed by the serenity of the inside.&nbsp; It was hotel like but more natural.&nbsp; It even had a mini waterfall and stream running through the lobby with a railing around it.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Behind the very basic but upscale desk was a beautiful young girl, probably about 19 years old, only slightly younger than Sam herself.&nbsp; The girls hair was a vibrant blonde tied back in a pony tail with a few well placed strands hanging off each side of the front of her face.&nbsp; She was wore a bright white button up dress shirt with a crisply popped collar.&nbsp; Sam couldn't tell what she was wearing below her stomach as the desk was in the way.&nbsp; The girls name tag read -Sabrina-.&nbsp; Sam approached her.&nbsp; Before Sam could even say a word the girl looked up with a cute smile �Hello, Samantha!�.&nbsp; �Uh, hi..&nbsp; what's going on?� Sam replied.&nbsp; The girl stood up and walking out from behind the desk.&nbsp; She was wearing a very loose flat black skirt.&nbsp; It came up slightly higher than her knees. �Sam, please go ahead and follow me into my office.&nbsp; This girl looked so sweet and nice but Sam couldn't help but feel nervous after what had happened so far.&nbsp; Walking down the hall to the right Sam noticed most of the offices were empty and she realized she hadn't seen anyone else in the building except �Sabrina�.&nbsp; After reaching the end of the hall they both entered an office to the right, they had passed at least 15 offices.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The office as nearly empty but it didn't feel empty.&nbsp; The styling was similar to the buildings lobby; very sophisticated but simple.&nbsp; �Sam please sit down�, she did.&nbsp; �Do you believe in god?� Sam instantly thought back to the note that read FROM THE OFFICE OF GOD then replied �to be honest no, but I haven't thought about it much�.&nbsp; �Well Sam, god is real but not the Christian god, or the Jewish god, or even Allah, the Islamic god.&nbsp; �OK thank you for the information but this sounds ridiculous� Sam said.&nbsp; Sabrina smirked at Sam then said �Yes I'm sure it sounds that way.&nbsp; Sam, I am god.&nbsp; Whatever you want to call it, the alpha and the omega etc etc.&nbsp; You have been chosen Sam, by me.�&nbsp; Sam tried to hold back a smile but failed.&nbsp; Then running it through her head again she got worried.&nbsp; This girl is crazy.&nbsp; She might even be dangerous despite being just an average size young girl.&nbsp; The rest must have been just a coincidence, she had to get out of here before it was too late.&nbsp; �Uh, OK I have to go.� Sam said.&nbsp; Sam went to get up from her chair but was unable to, in fact she was unable to move any of her body besides her head and neck.&nbsp; �what the fuck!� Sam exclaimed.&nbsp; Sabrina smirked again.&nbsp; �Sam, listen this is real and you know it is.&nbsp; How else would I have been able to get you here?&nbsp; You wouldn't have came without the stomach pain I promised.�&nbsp; �Let me go!� Sam yelled.&nbsp; After several minutes of convincing Sam calmed down and let Sabrina explain her future.&nbsp; �Sam, you have been chosen like I said�. �Chosen for what may I ask?�&nbsp; �Sam, I hate to say this -it was obvious Sabrina actually didn't hate it- you are now a chosen slave you may want to call it.&nbsp; You will do any orders given, without question, and immediately upon request.&nbsp; I am god and you will obey, or else.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sam woke up in her bed.&nbsp; What a crazy dream Sam thought.&nbsp; A note was laid next to her.&nbsp; Sam realized it wasn't a dream.&nbsp; The note was the exact same stationary as in her �dream�.&nbsp; It read: This wasn't a dream Sam *winky face*.&nbsp; A few seconds later she realized she was incredibly horny, she checked the clock.&nbsp; It was Sunday and it was her day off, the clock read 7:26 A.M.&nbsp; A voice in her head said play with yourself Sam, your welcome.&nbsp; Sam to horny to think clearly about what was going on began her self sex adventure.&nbsp; She was wearing what she usually wore to bed despite not remembering how she got there.&nbsp; It was tight short shorts with a tight elastic waistband and a t-shirt with extra short sleeves, also no under garments. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Traveling her hands down her stomach and into the waistband of her shorts.&nbsp; Why was she so horny?&nbsp; She can't remember being this horny since she was a teenager while thinking of her first love.&nbsp; She continued into her shorts with her right hand.&nbsp; Her pussy was relatively freshly shaven but felt slightly prickly.&nbsp; Shaving was a regular habit for years now even without a boyfriend.&nbsp; As she began rubbing her clit the hornyness only became stronger.&nbsp; Rubbing softly at first, then faster, then back to slow and soft.&nbsp; As she did so her back began to arch automatically.&nbsp; Her mouth was slightly open and she let out a soft gasp trying to hold back a moan.&nbsp; Then she bit her lip softly.&nbsp; The rush was coming.&nbsp; It was slow at first then it came fast rushing throughout her whole body.&nbsp; Her back arched very hard now and she was rubbing her clit as fast as she could manage.&nbsp; The rubbing went from a figurative 100 miles an hour to 20 in about 5 seconds, but with very hard rubs.&nbsp; As soon as the speed dropped she went from being exceptionally quiet to an erupting moan. No, it wasn't a moan she was screaming from the pure ecstasy of her orgasm.&nbsp; This wasn't like her, she lived in an apartment, when she had this type of �fun� she had to hold her moans in like any normal person would. This wasn't even an option right now.&nbsp; No matter how hard she tried it felt too good.&nbsp; Resistance was futile.&nbsp; Her screams were so loud it sounded as if she had been stabbed.&nbsp; After a good (very good) 15 to 20 seconds her screams subsided and the orgasm rush left just as fast as it came on.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She now laid there staring at the ceiling, she realized she had a huge smile on her face.&nbsp; Everything that had happened the day before had left her mind.&nbsp; She then removed her hands from her shorts, too tired to move much more than that.&nbsp; Her eyes slowly closed and she fell back asleep.
