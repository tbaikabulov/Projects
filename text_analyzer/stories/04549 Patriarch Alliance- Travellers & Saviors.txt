Way of the Female����� 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The ship�s engines burst into
life. Pushing at full capacity, they thrust �Savior� away from the space station.
The Middleton Space Fortress is a safe enough place, but for the trader and
sometimes smuggler Soshi Chang, it is not a place he wants to stay in any
longer than he absolutely needs to.� 

&nbsp;

�We are out of Middleton�s
range Captain.� Soshi looked at the man who spoke. At 16 years, Jaya is a
little young for a second officer, but Soshi wouldn�t trade him for anyone.

�Put the wrap drive on line. Map us a course to Planet
Kadir.�

�Wrap drive on, course is set. No large debris in the
way. Waiting orders Captain.�

�Launch.� 

��������� 

The �Savior� suddenly
disappears from the naked eye. Before the Walien, humans traveled between the
stars by pushing their ships to light speed. However, space is so vast that
even at the speed of light; it took months and years to reach your destination.
That was before the aliens introduced the solar-magnetic engines during the war.
Using solar energy that is stored in crystals, the engines basically wrap
space; the distances between the planets are decreased. The engines transform
space travel, turning months-long trips into a few weeks. Of course, being
struck on a spaceship for weeks is no one�s idea of a good time. Luckily, ships
usually have some entertainment on board. After days of negotiation at the
station, a diversion was what Soshi wanted right now. 

�Keep the ship on course Jaya. Call me if something
comes out.�

�I understand Captain.� 

&nbsp;

Jaya is nothing if not
serious, personally Soshi wonder if he should encourage the young man to change
that part of his personality. Mulling about that, he left the bridge. Savior is
a cargo ship, meaning lots of space for cargo and almost none for the crew. One
room most ships have of course is the �recreation room�, somewhere on board
where the crew can kick back and relax. With only 2 crew members on board, the
recreation room wasn�t really necessary for Savior, but Soshi kept it�if only
for one reason.

&nbsp;

The door slide out and the
reason became clear. In the centre of the room was a female human called Kristina.
She was naked save for a pair of thongs. Kneeling on the floor as was her
place; she saw Soshi entering the room and immediately placed her hands and
elbows on the floor, then she lowered her head till it touches the floor. 

�

Soshi is from Kadir, where
wives are called worms. And that�s how exactly how the men treated their wives.
Once married, all the body hair on the female is shaved. And DNA surgery conducted
during the wedding ceremony make it impossible for hair to grow again. The
females are also not allowed to walk or leave the house without permission.
They crawl on their hands and knees, with their belly on the floor at all
times. A naked, hairless female who crawls on her belly and can�t speak unless
spoken to. A human version of a worm.

&nbsp;

Soshi walked slowly towards
the female. He still marveled at the sight his wife. He met Kristina on a
smuggling run 21 years ago. Running weapons then, he picked up the desperate
stowaway on a stop on Planet Dembang. Wanting nothing to do with her, he was
going to dump her white ass on the next available stop but she was desperate
and did everything during the trip to convince him otherwise. Needless to say,
her charms and obedience worked.

�

Soshi walked around the worm
and check on her ass. The butt plug is still in place. Soshi then reached
between her legs and found that she was wet. Soshi lastly checked on the C.C
collar around the worm�s neck and saw that it was still working. He had set the
collar to release a pleasure charge once every hour. The collar will release a
hormone charge through Kristina that will chemically increase her desire to
have sex; a techno lust potion if you would. That was 7 hours ago. Soshi like
his females to be ready. He stood up and walked to the hologram television. 

&nbsp;

Kneeling on the floor, his
worm stayed in her position. Her need for release must have been great, but
Soshi is confidant that Kristina will not move till given permission by her
master. And the master was currently watching soccer. The final between Rothoame
City of Kadir and Tenla Town of Thordaw was played 5 days ago. Being in deep
space during that time, Soshi was unable to catch it live. He deliberately
ignored the sport pages so that he didn�t know the result. He sat down on the
sofa to watch the game.

&nbsp;

�Cold beer,� Soshi said. There
was one more person in the room. His daughter Tomi. Tomi ran out of the room, a
while later she re-entered with a six-pack. Soshi took it without a word. As
with most finals, the game was really quite boring. Both teams really didn�t
attack each other, at half-time the game was still goalless�and Soshi had
finished 2 beers. Soshi walked to Kristina who was still in the Family
Position. Soshi lowered his pants and released a steady of yellow piss at the
worm. Kristina knew what to do. She raised her head, opened her mouth and
drank. When her master finished, she lowered her head back to the floor. 

&nbsp;

Soshi saw that some of his
piss was on the floor. �Clean it,� he said. He walked back to the sofa to watch
the second half. Tomi ran toward her mother with a piece of rag in her hand.
Soshi watches Tomi as she cleaned the mess around Kristina. With her long black
hair and striking looks, Tomi was beautiful. Not only that, she works hard and
knows her place. She obeys every order given to her and Soshi have never heard
a word of bitching from her. Tomi cleaned up the mess and went back to her
corner of the room. Kneeling down at the corner, she then placed her hands and
forehead on the floor. Yes, Soshi decided then that he will begin looking for a
husband for Tomi. At 18 years old, she was at the age of marriage. She�s
beautiful, works hard and do not complain. She will make a good wife for
someone.

��

The game then took over. Like
the first, the second half was very low-key. 10mins before the end however, Rothoame City scored. A long 10mins later, the game was over and
Kadir had their first team to ever win the Alliance Cup. Soshi jumped for joy.

&nbsp;

Feeling delighted, Soshi
walked towards Kristina and ordered, �Inspection Position.� Kristina jumped to
her feet. She opened her legs wide and bended her knees parallel to the ground.
Locking her fingers behind her head, she thrust her huge tits outwards. Soshi
reached for Kristina�s pussy again. 

�Still very, very wet,� Soshi teased. �You are such a
slut.�

�This worm is your slut, your bitch, your whore.
Please Master, make this worm do what it was born to do.� Kristina shouted.

�Present Position.�

��������� Kristina
did not need another invitation. She lay on her back and opened her legs again.
Lifting her legs in the air, she uses her hands and grabbed both her ankles.
This shows that not only is she willing to open her legs to her master, she
will use her hands to keep herself available. Soshi took a moment to look at
his wife. Kristina�s face reddens. She had always found this position to be
very humiliating�probably why this is her master�s favorite position for her.

&nbsp;

��������� Without
a word, Soshi dropped her pants and entered her. The C.C collar did its work,
Kristina was on the verge of orgasm in no time. She tried to hold it in but 7
hours of hormone charges made it impossible. She screamed her joy as she cum.
Soshi would punish her later for cumming without permission but right now he
ignored her and continue pumping. A good game, cold beer and a slut. What more
can a man asked for? He was just about to cum when the Intercom sounded.
�Father, this is Jaya.�

�What is it?� Soshi did not stop thrusting while he
replied. Jaya never call him �father� on the ship unless it�s important but he
was just about to reach climax.

�You better get up here. Looking like a SOS from a
small transport.�

�On my way.�

��������� With
that, Soshi came. The release was quick and Soshi lay on Kristina for a few
seconds. Then he stood up and went straight to the bridge. Behind him, Tomi
started cleaning up the room as Kristina went back on her knees. Both females
awaiting for the next time a male has need of entertainment.

The Outer Rims consist of 13
planets between the Terran Empire and the Walien Theocracy. These planets
declared independence and are widely considered a buffer zone between the
Empire and the Theocracy. 

The
Outer Planets, the Lost Terran Empire 

����������������������������������������������� Published
in Year 8024

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

PAIN. That�s the first thing
the boy felt when he opened his eyes. The first thing that entered his mind was
how blue everything was. A medical pod! He was in a medical pod! Relief flooded
over him. They were rescued by someone. They were�then he saw the creature. The
darkness took him again.

&nbsp;

The second time he opened his
eyes, he saw finally saw a similar sight. His sister. �Maya, he�s awake.� Maya?
Who�s Maya? The boy looked at the person his sister was speaking to. It was his
eldest sister, but her name was�

�You okay Jules? Gave Jeanne and me a hell of a scare
there?� His eldest sister looked at him intently as she spoke. The boy wasn�t
stupid and played along.

�I feel like shit. Where are we?� �Jules� sat up and
looked around. It�s clearly some sort of medical room, a very small one. He was
sitting on a bed opposite the medical pod he was in. There�s a table near the
door and he saw the old man. A short man with short grey hair, he has the look
of a man who has seem it all. 

�This is the cargo ship Savior. I am the captain. My
name is Soshi Chang. You�re Jules?� 

�Yes, thanks for helping us Captain.�

�Heard your SOS, can�t call myself a captain if I
didn�t stop. What are you doing there anyway?� The captain was talking to him,
but �Maya� butted in.

�We were passengers visiting some relatives in Endar.
Our transport�s engines ran into some trouble and we had to come out of wrap�in
the middle of nowhere.�

�I see�� the captain replied. �We�re going to Planet
Kadir, reach it in a week. We�ll message ahead and drop you off there.�

�No need.� Jules heard his sister quick reply and
immediately knew that it was a mistake. Maya didn�t think so because she
continued. �We will like to charter your vassal to bring the three of us to
Endar. The fee is not a problem.�

&nbsp;

Now that �doesn�t� sound
suspicious. So Jules wasn�t that surprise when the captain refused.

�No thanks. I did my duty as a spaceman to save you,
but I don�t want to get involved in your problems.�

�There�s no problem, we just need transport to Endar.�
Maya�s quickly replied.

�Who�s the pilot of your transport then?�

�I am the pilot.� Maya hotly replied.

The captain�s eyebrows were raised at that but he
asked without hesitation, �Why did you come out of wrap without cooling down?�

�What?� Maya asked.

�Everyone knows that to come out of wrap, you need to first
cool down the solar-magnetic engines. You guys didn�t! You came out of wrap in
a hurry without cooling down. That�s why your engines were damaged. Why?�

�Not your concern. Just bring us to Endar and we�ll
make worth your while. Like I said, money is not a problem.� Maya is nothing if
not persistent. 

�Then the answer is no.�

�We�re talking a lot of credits here.�

�Money is no use to dead people. I don�t even know
your real names�

��������� 

Silence greeted the captain�s
statement. Jules knew they were in trouble. The captain knew they weren�t just
tourist and they needed the captain a lot more than the captain needed them.
Nothing they can do but tell the truth and hope for the best. ��

�What do you want to know?� Both his sister�s looked
at Jules as he spoke, but both kept quiet.

The captain looked at him with a raised eyebrow. �Why
did you drop out of wrap so quickly?�

�We were begin chased.�

�By who?�

That was too much for Maya. �Like I said, it�s none of
your��

�You heard of the Hawthorne Space Corporation?� Both
his sisters looked at Jules in shock. Maya was the first to recover.

�Remus, don�t say anything to��

�We need him, and he�s not going to do anything
without information.�

�I�ve heard of Hawthorne,� all eyes focused on the captain as he spoke. �Large
corporation based on Planet Omar, just at the edge of the Terran Empire.
They�re chasing you?�

�Captain, you are looking at the 3 heirs of the
Hawthorne Space Corporation.�

&nbsp;

��������� 

The captain�s eyes widen as
Remus, now Jules, explained everything. The Hawthorne Space Corporation was a
space building company, mainly for transport vassals. It started 6 years ago,
when their mother got an offer of a large contract to build battleships for the
Empire. Their mother quickly agreed and put the whole corporation into the
contract. 4 years in, their mother tried to break the contract. Seems that the
Terran Empire was building the battleships not for defensive purposes as they
were first told, but for an attack on the independent planets in the Outer
Rims. The empire did not take kindly to that and 6 months ago, their mother met
with an �accident�. And the 3 of them were on the run ever since.

��������� 

Soshi listened to the whole
story in silence. It�s an incredible story, but there�s some truth in it. For
over a year now, rumors have been flying about an attack by the Empire. In a
way, that was understandable. 

&nbsp;

When the Waliens withdrew in
7950, they gave the planets they had conquered a choice. They could join the Walien
Theocracy or return to the Terrans Empire. The planets made their choice almost
based on geography. The planets nearest to Walien territory, who were the first
to be conquered, decided to join the Theocracy; while the planets nearest to
Earth, who were the last to be conquered, decided to return to the Empire. The
planets in the middle however decided to declared independence and make their
own way from there on in. Since then, over a hundred years ago, humans have
called the planets between the Waliens and the Empire the Outer Rims.

&nbsp;

The Empire now wanted them
back. Soshi looked at the 3 young adults. Both females had long blond hair, but
the boy�s hair has some blackish roots. The two females however were very
beautiful. Maya was the oldest but Soshi did not believe that she was a day
above 23. The boy however barely looked out of his teens. Trying to run against
the Empire when you are so young, they must have been truly desperate. 

&nbsp;

The story they told was wrong
too. If their mother didn�t want to build battleships�so what? The Empire must
have several companies building their weapons, what�s one less. Soshi
remembered where they were going, and then it made sense.� 

&nbsp;

�Your mother was selling secrets to the Endarians,
wasn�t she?�

The silence that followed gave him his answer. Soshi
continued, �That�s why you 3 tried to run across Alliance territory, wasn�t it? You thought that the Empire
wouldn�t chase you across enemy space.�

More silence.

�You�re right.� The 3 looked Soshi in surprise as the
captain said it. Soshi continued, �They should have stopped the chase the
moment you entered Alliance space. They didn�t! What did your mother have that
was some important that the Empire would risk war to get back?�

The silence that followed was deafening. Soshi wet for
the kill. �You better tell me because the path to Endar is gone.�

�What?� Maya shouted. Jeanne looked scared but the boy
merely looked resigned. Soshi decided that maybe Jules was the smart one of the
bunch.

�If your mother has something that the Empire would
risk war to get back, chances are they would have spotters all over the Endar
border. You guys will never get though.�

Their faces paled, even the boy�s. �So your suggestion
is�?� Jules asked.

�Come to Kadir and speak to the Alliance for asylum. If what you have is good, you might even
be heroes.�

The 3 of them looked at one another. Finally, Maya
asked, �May we be alone for awhile Captain?�

Soshi left the medical room but waited outside. He
knew he didn�t have to wait long.� 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

��������� In the
end, there wasn�t much of a choice. They had to throw in with the Alliance. They informed Captain Soshi of their decision and
are on their way to Planet Kadir. That was 5 days ago.

&nbsp;

��������� In the
5 days, Jules (they decided to keep their fake names) had free reign of the
ship. The only area he does not have access to was the cargo bay. But he wasn�t
going to complain. The girls have it much worse. The only are they have access
to is the �entertainment room�. It was there that Jules saw the creature again.
Naked and hairless, it seems that the creature was called Kristina of Chang.
She was the wife of the captain and the medical officer on board. She was also
the entertainment. According to the second officer, Jaya Chang, she stays in
the room unless there is a medical emergency. Her job is basically to entertain
any crew member that enters the room. And by crew member, Jaya means male crew
member. Females don�t count as crew, but as cargo. The first time Jules entered
the entertainment room, Kristina was already on her knees. She bows her head
when she saw him and then just stayed in that position. Only later, did Jules
find out from Jaya that she will stay in that position till she is told to do
something or till the male leaves. The captain was kind enough to clear a room
for him and his sisters. Needless to say, both his sisters stayed in the room a
lot. 

&nbsp;

Jules however found that he
was enjoying himself on board. He was shocked when Jaya said that Kristina was
his mother and that he has a sister. The sister is called Tomi. She was the one
that cleared the room for them and her basic job on board is cleaning. Tomi was
someone Jules had never made before. She was about his age but didn�t act it.
Every girl he knew around his age was basically a princess, spoilt or otherwise.
Tomi was different. She didn�t say much but Jules always felt her attention.
She would jump the moment he ordered something and every time he enter the
entertainment room, she was right there waiting for orders. Jules found that he
enjoyed the power he has over her.

&nbsp;

Then one day, as he entered
the entertainment room, he saw something very different. Kristina was in her
normal position on her knees, everything looked normal but then Jules heard the
sound of the whip. In a corner of the room, Tomi had her face pinned against
the wall.&nbsp;Her legs were wide apart and her arms above her head, just like
a criminal.

&nbsp;

Behind her, Jaya was carrying
a laser whip. He swung the whip back and slashed it across the back of Tomi.
Tomi screamed as pain streaked across her body.

Jules shouted, �What are you doing?�

Jaya turned around with a puzzled look. �Punishing
her, what do you think?�

�What did she do?�

�She dropped the beer.� Jaya pointed to the floor.
Only then did Jules saw the can of beer near the door.

�So? It�s still unopened, it not spill or anything.�

�Doesn�t matter. She made a mistake, so she must be
punished.�

�You�re whipping her for dropping a can of unopened
beer?� Jaya nodded. Jules just couldn�t help himself, �That�s just plain
stupid!�

Jaya�s puzzled look deepens. He pointed at his sister
and asked, �Tomi, am I wrong to punish you for your mistake?�

Tomi answered immediately, �No Sir. Any mistake a
female makes deserve punishment. Please Sir, whip this worthless creature. Make
this creature regret her mistake.� 

�See,� Jaya told Jules. 

��������� 

Jules shook his head.
Unbelievable! Jaya is whipping his sister and Tomi seems to be encouraging him.
Jules couldn�t believe it and if Jaya�s face is any indication, Jaya couldn�t
understand what the problem is.

�You whip her for dropping something?� Jaya nodded
again. �How often does this happen?�

�Not often, she usually doesn�t drop��

�No, not that. How often do you whip her? Your own
sister!�

�I don�t understand. Why are you so angry about this?�

�You are whipping your own sister!� Jules shouted.

�Because she made a mistake. If my mother did the same
thing, I�ll whip her too.�

Jules reeled. �You whip your mother?�

�Of course. She is female, isn�t she?�

�But�she�s a human being! You mother.�

�No she�s not!�

�What?�

Jaya pointed at Tomi again and asked, �What are you
Tomi? Are you human?�

The answer was immediate. �This creature is female.
This creature is a cow, a pig, a worm. Only males are human. This creature is
nothing but an animal.�

Jaya looked at Jules. �Tomi is a female. Like all
females in the Patriarch Alliance, she is an animal. She�s well-trained, but
she is still an animal. If you lower the whip, animals will always become
disobedient.�

Jules shocked look was unmistaken. 

�Have you ever whipped anyone before?� Jaya asked.

�What! Of course not! We��

�Here, Tomi has 3 more strokes. You do it.� Jaya
handed over the whip as he spoke.

��������� 

Without knowing why, Jules
took the whip. He looked at it properly for the first time. It was very light,
but the power and excitement he felt was indescribable. He looked at Tomi,
suddenly Jaya spoke.

�Beg him to punish you Tomi.�

Tomi immediately shouted. �Yes Sir. Please Mister
Jules, please whip this worthless creature. Please correct this creature�s
actions so that this creature will never make the same mistake again.�

Jules shook his head. He seems to be doing that a lot
today. 

�Please Mister Jules; this animal is too stupid to
learn without pain. Please teach this creature the error of her ways. Please
whip this creature with all your might.�

��������� 

That settles it. Before he
knew it, Jules� arm went back and then swung the whip across. He wanted to copy
what Jaya did, but the aim was wrong. The whip hit Tomi across the buttocks
instead of the back. 

�No, you�re doing it wrong.� Jaya stepped in. �Ever
played golf? Same thing really. Swing your arm across your body and then follow
though.� 

�Won�t that hurt her?� What is he doing? Jules
couldn�t believe it but he was discussing techniques on how to whip people. 

�The whip won�t tear her skin. That�s why it�s laser
and not say leather or bamboo.� Jaya was like a teacher. �Two more.� he said.

&nbsp;

Jules� arm went back and
followed Jaya�s instruction. He was a great golf player and this time, his aim
was true. The whip slashed across the back of Tomi. The scream was immediate.
Jules felt�empowered! He was getting into this.

�One more. Make it count,� Jaya said.

&nbsp;

Jules� arm went back again. He
swung his arm with all his strength and then followed though like Jaya said.
Tomi�s scream was the loudest yet and she collapsed onto the ground.

&nbsp;

�Brilliant!� Jaya clapped
Jules on the shoulder. �You�re a natural! Just bloody beautiful!� Jules let the
praise wash over him. He only has eyes for Tomi. Collapsed on the ground, she
was breathing heavily but motionless, too tired to even move. Only one thought
entered Jules� head�he must do this again soon.














Jules decided that Planet Kadir was a terrible place

The Path of
Man

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Jules decided that Planet
Kadir was a terrible place. Heavy wind and snow slashed across the planets�
surface everyday of the year, making the surface unlivable. As such, all the
cities on the planet were built underground. The people dug gigantic caverns
and some of them lived without ever seeing any sunlight. Maybe that�s why they
got such a sick sense of humor.�� 

&nbsp;

Jules had been on the planet
for 2 weeks now. Captain Soshi delivered them to the planet as promised and
helped them contact the right people. The 3 of them gave the Alliance their goods on the Empire and asked (begged) for
asylum. For 2 weeks, there had been no response. Then, Jules got a summons to
report to a Carlos Bush. Which is exacting what Jules is doing now, and he
can�t believe a word the intelligence officer is saying. 

&nbsp;

�Let me get this clear. You want me to go in front of
the whole universe and accuse the Empire of stealing my company?� 

�Yes,� the officer said. �I know what your plans were
Mr. Hawthorne, but going to the Endarians is out of the question now. And with
what you have, the Empire isn�t going to stop hunting you. Running is not an
option, so that only leave being so high profile that killing you isn�t worth
the trouble.�

�Of course,� Jules remarked. �I�m going to accuse the
Empire of theft. Yes, that�s much safer than running and hiding.� 

�Mr. Hawthorne, you do know what you have on them
right?�

��������� Jules
know perfectly well what he has. The Terran Empire are building battleships.
Nothing unusual there, but for the amount of ships they are building. They
weren�t going to take the Outer Rims one planet at a time, the number of ships
they were ordering meant that they were going for all of them. With this
information, everyone in the Outer Rims is going to know the truth; the Terran
Empire is coming after them. No one will believe any propaganda crap about
border disputes or the just war. Once the Empire attacked one planet the others
will start fighting. 

&nbsp;

�I do, but there are 3 problems with your suggestion.�
Jules said. �One, going public will not make me any safer��

�Correction,� Officer Carlos said. �You are the
company owner, your mother tried to break the contact when she discovered that
her company was being used to build ships that will fight in a huge war that�s
not being seen in a hundred years. She was killed and now you, her loyal son
and heir, are being chased by assassins. Once you said all these, the Empire
wouldn�t dream of killing you. Not without a PR disaster on their hands.�

�Good story, but sadly not true. My mother was killed
because she was selling��

�We won�t tell the public that and neither will the
Empire.�

&nbsp;

��������� Okay,
he�s right there. Jules had to admit the Empire wouldn�t kill him once he goes
with that story. But there�s still 2 other problems he foresees.

�Okay, the second problem you have is that I am not
the heir! I am but one of three Hawthorne children, both my sisters has a claim too.�

�Not under Alliance law.�

�What?�

�Under Alliance law, only humans may inherit property. Being females,
your sisters are considered animals with no rights except the right to live and
serve. Being the only male child, Mr. Remus Hawthorne is the sole heir of the
Hawthorne Space Corporation. That means you.�

Jules was in shock. He has to ask, �Why?�

�Because Mr. Hawthorne, you are what we call a
valuable asset. Your presence alone will tell the people of the Empire that
they are on the wrong side. Most people like to think that they are the good
guys. Your presence with us with the cover story will tell the people that the
Empire is using underhand methods to get the war they want. The coming war will
not be one forced onto the Empire, but one the Terrans chose to fight.�

�But why me only? Why not my sisters as well?�

�Because they are females!�

�So? We�re not Alliance citizens.� 

�When the 3 of you asked for asylum, it was decided
that it will be better to grant you citizenships. That way, the Empire cannot
demand your expulsions on any trump-up charges.�

�My sisters will refuse.�

�Since you are the sole male of the family, under Alliance law only your word count for anything.�

�You think I will betray my family? You don�t know me
very well, Mr. Carlos.�

�I believed that you are a very smart man Mr.
Hawthorne. And beside, where else can you go that is both safe and fun?�

�Fun?�

�Yes,� the officer opened a file that was on his table.
�According to Captain Soshi, you seem to have developed a taste for whipping
females.� Jules� face reddens at that. Officer Bush however ignored him and
continued. �3 straight days, you used the ship entertainment for whipping. Have
a natural flair for it, it seems.�

&nbsp;

Jules stayed uncomfortably silent. He can�t think of
anything to say. The intelligence officer saved him.

&nbsp;

�As the sole heir of the Hawthorne Space Corporation,
you are a very rich man. You will no problem buying or marrying some females
for your pleasure Mr. Hawthorne.�

�Buying?� Jules was shocked by this. �I thought
slavery is outlawed in the Alliance?�

�Planet Kadir is the only planet in the Alliance that slavery is allowed. Of course, nowadays only
female slaves are allowed. They are after all just animals.�

&nbsp;

�Okay, my third problem is my biggest one. How do I
know the Patriarch Alliance won�t kill me after I go public?�

�My, you are a smart one. I give you my word as a man
of the Alliance that we will not harm you is any way shape or form.�

�That�s all? I am to just believe that the Alliance won�t kill me after my usefulness is over based on
your word.�

For the first time, Jules see some anger on the
officer�s face. �This is the Alliance Mr. Hawthorne. Here, a man�s word still
means something. Besides, what good will it do the Alliance to kill you?�

�Like you said earlier, a PR disaster for the Empire?�

�Only if they kill you. If we kill you and everyone
finds out�the PR disaster will be on our hands. It�s simply not worth the
risk.� Jules was still not convinced; it must have shown on the face because
the officer continued. �We will sweeten the deal for you.� With that, Officer
Bush pressed a button that was on his table. 

&nbsp;

��������� One of
the things about buildings on Kadir is that there are always smalls holes on
its� walls. Jules thought those holes were for pets of the Kadirans as they
were only slightly bigger than the pet�s door you will find on Earth. He was
wrong. About a minute after Officer Bush pressed the button, a woman crawled
into the room. Crawling on her belly, she wriggled herself slowly to the Officer
Bush�s feet. On the officer�s command, the woman stood up. She opened her legs wide
and bended her knees parallel to the ground. She then locked her fingers behind
her head and thrust her tits out. Jules took a good look at her. She was tall,
totally hairless and had a beautiful face. If the hair was allowed to grow,
Jules was sure she would be beautiful. 

&nbsp;

�Her name is Shania. She is yours.�

�What?� 

�Her master was killed in a hovercraft accident. She
has no family so she became property of the state. She is now yours.� 

�What?� Jules was reeling. �Mine? You are giving her
away�to me?�

�Yes.�

�But�Why?�

�She will be a good fit. She is young, just 20. She
also has good scores in both her domestic and slut tests. She is also highly
intelligent. She will help you adept to your new position here in on Kadir.�

�Just like that�you are just giving her away?�

Officer Bush looked at him in surprise. Then he
smiled. �Yes. A worm without a master will automatically become property of the
state. Usually, they will be put to work in the crystal mines unless some other
masters claim them. Usually, this means their father, brother, uncles or even
their master�s friends. If the worm is unclaimed, they are sold on the auction
block. Mining companies are almost always on the lookout for labor. After
paying the fees, the new masters will work them in any capacity they deem fit. �This will be her fate, but due to her skills
the Alliance believe that she will be better serve in a more fitting position.�

�As my slave?�

�Yes.�

&nbsp;

�Jules looked at
Shania again. God, did he want her. But there�s still the problem of her
sisters. �What about my sisters?�

�They will be sold on the auction block.�

�They will go to the mines?�

�Unless someone claim them. If not, the mining
companies will buy them.�

�I can claim them?�

�Yes you can.� Officer Bush continued, �Mr. Hawthorne,
you must understand something. We are giving you a new start here. You will
have money, power, safety and all the females you want. Tell me, do you know of
anywhere else where you can get such a deal?�

Jules went silence on this. 

&nbsp;

The holograms came on, cutting
out the programs. The hologram was that of a man, a well-known newscaster.
�This is Dan Donavan. We are cutting across all normal programming to bring you
this latest news. The Terran Empire has launched a surprise attack on Planet
Wastien. A planet of the Outer Rims, Planet Wastien was attacked due to state
sponsored smuggling that is going on in the sector. According to the Terrans
spokesman, the attack was due to the direct dispute between the 2 parties and
has nothing to do with the rest of the Outer Rims. The spokesman assured the
people of the Outer Rims that this is not an attack on the Outer Rims, calling
the idea �nutty�. In another development, Remus Hawthorne has surfaced in the
Patriarch Alliance accusing the Empire of murdering his mother. This is the
statement Mr. Hawthorne gave to the press���
