Synopsis: Vicki is sold to a woman, who crates her and ships her locally for her bondage training.�Bobby is getting serious about his new girlfriend,� Vicki spoke softly sitting down to breakfast. I felt an inflection of concern
  or maybe resolve in her tenor. It was Saturday morning. The May air felt cool,
  the sun warming my back as it had just cleared the eves. We were eating breakfast
  on the patio. It seemed so quiet, peaceful; nice to be with my wife. 
�Good for him. He needs to be thinking about a wife and family anyway.� The
  kids were watching TV, Saturday AM cartoons. They were eight and ten, cute
  kids� all we had ever wanted in a family. 
�He told me yesterday that he wants to be more faithful to his feeling for
  her. Monday will be the last time we get together.� I looked at my wife closely,
  considering. She had been seeing him, fucking him, for just about a year. I
  knew she had to have some feelings and was not quite sure what to say� or exactly
  how she felt so I watched her closely for some indication. 
�You okay with that?� I asked honestly, caring deeply about Vicki's feelings,
  even those feelings about Bobby, her young lover. We talked often about feelings,
  hers and mine, about us and about her lovers. Vicki had several lovers. She
  was very committed to Jack and enjoyed his ownership of her body. Bobby was
  younger, in better shape, and more aggressive sexually. He liked to tie her
  to the bed while fucking her. Once he had taken her in our front entry with
  the door ajar. Pinned her against the wall while kissing and fondling her breasts� stripped
  her naked and fucked her right there on the welcome matt. It was exciting,
  a rush for Vicki. Sex is sex but the variety of lovers, their personal preferences,
  individual ways, acts and actions were adventurous, thrilling, exciting, alluring.
  Bill, another of her lovers, was� well� an effective lay, though not as exciting
  he was larger than most and good for a pleasant evening. 
�Yes and no.� She struggled a little. �I mean he needs to be moving on, living
  his own life and all. It's just that, well, I get a bit involved� you know� emotionally
  with these guys. I like Bobby and will miss my time with him.� I appreciated
  her honesty. It made the whole thing work and kept our personal relationship
  safe and strong. 
�I've been thinking�� Vicki paused, �Jack's Deed is due to renew at the end
  of the month� and with Bobby out, well, I was thinking of taking the next month
  or two off.� I listened quietly as she spoke her mind. 
�I enjoy our  time and I want to spend a bit more time at
  home� with you and the kids� just relaxing� getting away� a vacation of sorts.� 
�And then?� I asked not sure exactly what she wanted at the moment. 
�Oh, I want renew Jack's Lease. That's just fun! I never know what he will
  come up with. And as long as he wants to play and you don't mind, I think I'll
  just keep his lease current.� I smiled. Yes, he was always interesting. From
  the first week of Jack's lease, as Vicki called it, or sale as the �bill of
  sale' read he had taken a very curious, fun, and inventive interest in Vicki's
  sex. 
�As for the other's�� Vicki took another bite pausing to chew, �I just want
  a vacation. Then we can replace Bobby.� Vicki sipped her green tea. �I don't
  think I would or could enjoy a marriage based on strict monogamy any more.
  And I can't abide lying to each other� not that we would. I mean we talk about
  things� but hiding, sneaking, lying to your spouse to keep an affair.� She
  paused to look directly at me. I had more than suggested the changes to our �marital
  fidelity', more like insisted really. Vicki had just given in over time. 
She took her role in their lives seriously too. It was not strictly �recreational�.
  Vicki felt responsible to take care of the sexual needs, appetites, and desires
  of her lovers� all her lovers. 
�Frankly, I enjoy the variety� and the sex. I don't want to give it up. I
  just want a vacation.� Vicki sat back from the table. �I am going to leave
  a message for Bill.� She said. �I don't want to quit. Honestly I like doing
  them. I just want a break� for a while.� Vicki took another bite. 
Jack paid the outrageous sum of $1.00 to own Vicki's body for the period of
  three months. We prepared and gave him a Deed, confirmed with a Bill of Sale
  as a receipt. He had renewed his Deed twice� and used it often. Vicki had sex
  with him several times most weeks, usually after work and on the way home from
  his office. Jack was married. About once a month Jack came up with some outrageous
  event for Vicki as the �owner' of her sex. He used her in his business as well
  as private affairs. He was creative, impulsive, inventive and fun� for both
  of us. 
Bobby was a younger man she had met at the spa several years ago. He had a
  voracious appetite for sex, her sex. Vicki enjoyed his passion and aggression.
  I had changed my tee-times to mid morning's Sunday so she could meet him. Vicki
  was gone by six and home by nine, well serviced and ready to do Mom duty. She
  usually met him once or twice during the week too. 
Bill was a salesman. He was a client of Jack's who had meet Vicki on one of
  Jack's sales calls. His area covered several states. He was in town every third
  week for a few days. Vicki spent one of those evenings with him. 
Then there was me� Vicki took good care of me, two or three times a week.
  It kept our relationship strong and devoted. Vicki had gone from ordinary marital
  sex once every week or two to having sex almost everyday, sometimes several
  times a day, and often with several different men in a day. Oral, anal, vaginal� lovers,
  clients, and husband Vicki took care of us all� developing a real appetite
  too. She never shrugged the pleasures or the responsibility to service her
  men adequately. In fact she regarded them rather jealously. 
One Saturday she had done Bobby in the early AM, me afterwards, Jack and clients
  at a party that afternoon, Bill after dinner, and me again that night. I enjoyed
  her energy. I completely understood her wanting, no needing a vacation. Really
  I did, and now seemed as good a time as any. 
This Saturday was quiet, our time together, family time� nice time. Jack was
  away on business. Bobby was getting serious about his new life. Bill had left
  town last night. 
An Unusual Wednesday�. 
�Hello.� Vicki answered the phone, it early Wednesday morning, before she
  left for work. This was the third week of her vacation. Vicki recognized the
  voice at the other end. It was Jack's secretary. She had called on several
  occasions to set appointments for Jack when he was out of town. She had called
  me before the shipping crate had arrived so I would be looking for it� though
  she did not seem to understand its particular significance she was obviously
  privy in someway to part of Vicki's activities. Jack's lease would expire this
  week. 
�Jack wants to renew the lease� say this Friday� yes� He says to be ready
  for shipping the following Friday afternoon.� 
�Yes. When� what time Friday?� Vicki asked. 
�Say about noon � at Ruby River .� The woman said formally. 
�Sure. I'll be there.� Vicki set the receiver down. 
�Well, Hun. Jack wants to re-up� and I get shipped out this Friday� so much
  for the vacation.� 
�Why didn't you put him off?� I asked frankly. 
�Because it's Jack� besides I want a break from the vacation, if you know
  what I mean.� She smiled wryly. 
�Sure. What did you mean by shipped out?� I asked watching her gather her
  effects to leave for work. 
�Parcel Post� crate and freight.� She smiled. A glint twinkled in her eye
  as she turned towards the front door. The excitement almost radiated in her
  smile. The tires screeched a bit at the end of the driveway as she sped off.
  I smiled at her enthusiasm. 
�You must be Vicki.� It was a simple enough statement of fact� except when
  delivered unexpectedly by a woman� when you are expecting a man, your lover
  to be exact. It was Jack's secretary. Vicki recognized her voice almost immediately. 
�Yes. And where is Jack?� The hostess led the two women towards a small booth
  at the back of the restaurant. Vicki stood. The woman sat down sliding across
  the bench comfortably. 
�My name is Karen. He's not coming. In fact I told Jack I would handle the
  renewal. I found this document in a file� at the back of his files� in his
  desk� quite by accident� while searching for a miss placed file� before a business
  trip of his.� She slid the Deed across the table for Vicki to examine. It seemed
  to be Vicki's Deed and her Bill of Sale. 
The waitress took their lunch order. Vicki returned the papers. �So what do
  you think this means?� 
�Nothing really. It explained the phone calls. I really didn't care what the
  arrangements were for anyway.� 
�Didn't care� and you do now?� Vicki asked sipping her iced tea. 
�It seems that your phone number appears several times on the call list of
  my fianc&eacute;'s cell phone bill�. I believe you know him.� Vicki sipped
  quietly not wishing to interrupt the woman. 
�His name is Bobby�� Vicki nearly spit her tea. �May I take it then, that
  you do know Bobby?� Karen smiled thinly at Vicki. �Sorry but I must ask, do
  you have a similar arrangement with him?� 
�Yes. I know Bobby� and no. The arrangements I, we, my husband and I have
  with Jack are unique. As for Bobby, he broke it off a month ago� to be faithful
  to you. He was quite fond of you.� Vicki stammered a bit flustered by events.
  Her mind raced as she fumbled with the situation. Vicki blushed, her heart
  pounding like thunder. 
She smiled. �Good for him.� The woman pushed another paper and a pen towards
  Vicki. It was a new Bill of Sale for Jack. Vicki read it over carefully before
  signing it. The woman handed Vicki a crisp new un-circulated one dollar bill,
  the proper purchase amount. 
�I'll put that with the Deed.� Lunch arrived� a Cob salad for Karen and a
  Cesar's Salad for Vicki� Karen slid two new pieces of paper towards Vicki.
  One was a Mortgage of Jack's Deed, a �second' kind of document, giving the
  holder all of the rights of ownership� display, usage, possession, etc� second
  to Jack, the primary Deed holder, and excluding the issuance of a third unless
  there were a resolution of the primary or secondary title holders claim. The
  other was a very similar Bill of Sale� for the price of one dollar, consideration. 
This sale is second only to those rights of Jack� and the sellers
      husband should she so choose � and shall be primary to the rights of everyone
      else� in the amount of $1.00 
&nbsp;
Vicki read and reread the paper before her. 
�So you want to make a purchase also?� Vicki stammered. �What use would you
  have of such a purchase?� 
The woman smiled. �I intend to make it wedding gift of a sort� after the honeymoon
  and all.� Karen looked up serious as she spoke, �I won't have him stepping
  out. And with you I will know when and with whom. �I' will retain ownership
  and thereby control however.� 
�And is that your sole interest in this arrangement?� Vicki asked her mind
  racing to keep up with events, adrenaline coursing through Vicki's body pounding,
  racing wildly in her mind. Her heart paused earnestly awaiting an answer. 
�Mostly. My interests are somewhat different than Jack's. Yet still, I might
  find some intrigue in my position.� Karen evaded a direct answer. Vicki considered
  quietly while she ate. She had no interest in being with another woman� and
  that would be a distinct possibility� She had never even considered another �Deed'
  option running concurrently with Jack� and the additional demands on her time;
  if it were used in some fashion might prove difficult or overbearing to her
  family. Then there was her husband� what might he think of things? Vicki considered
  carefully. 
�And if I don't sign it�� Vicki quipped. 
�Then don't. There is no threat. We all know about things, you, me, and your
  husband.� Karen smiled pleasantly as she ate her lunch. �But I think you will.� 
�And will Jack know of this?� Vicki asked having just considered that possibility. 
�What will it change really?� Karen's lips pursed a thin flat line. Her retort
  was to the point. What would it change� for Vicki anyway� maybe for Karen,
  but Vicki could see little point passed that of personal embarrassment. 
The papers sat in front of Vicki as she ate. Vicki did not answer for the
  moment. She was still considering� and recovering her composure. The paper
  sat undisturbed and unsigned thru lunch. Once Vicki got over the shock she
  found Karen, a younger lady, quite pleasant. She felt happy for Bobby too in
  finding someone so nice� and cute� petite, blond, blue eyes, a nice shape,
  well groomed� really a very pleasant Lady. 
The waitress cleared the table leaving the lunch bill. The papers lay awkwardly
  between them. 
�I'll get this if you get that.� Vicki retrieved the Bill of Sale, pen in
  hand, pointing at the lunch ticket. Vicki signed Karen's �Deed in Second' and
  the Bill of Sale. Vicki drew a very slow deliberate, deep breath before pushing
  the papers back to Karen. 
�Now that you have it what do you intend to do with it?� Vicki challenged.
  Not sure, hoping really, that Karen would never do anything with it. The �point'
  she suspected was little more than the whole confrontation issue and not the �using'
  of the lease itself. So it seemed to Vicki to be the reality of things at the
  moment. 
�I'll get lunch.� Karen said passing Vicki another crisp new one dollar bill.
  They stood to leave. Karen held the door open for Vicki to leave� 
�Friday the crate is mine.� Karen said as she walked briskly away leaving
  Vicki in a stunned silence. Not the answer she had anticipated! 
�You'll never guess who took me to lunch today.� Vicki said as we got into
  bed next to her husband. 
�Alright, who?� I asked as I cuddled over close to her. I began tracing tiny
  soft circles around Vicki's areolas. I wanted her tonight. I could feel her
  nipples tighten at the attention. She has wonderfully large nipples nearly &frac34; inch
  tall and just about &frac12; inch wide when fully erect. I rolled one gently
  between my forefinger and thumb. 
�Jack's secretary. She renewed his lease� and�� She paused, closing eyes focusing
  on the sensations in her breasts. �Turns out she is Bobby's fianc&eacute;.� I
  stopped for a brief moment. 
�No.� 
�Yup, and she bought a lease option for herself.� Vicki smiled at my surprise. 
�She knows� she bought a lease�. You're kidding!� I stammered. �And you sold
  her one?� 
�I wasn't really sure at first. I mean, at first I thought she might just
  be angry, or thinking of blackmail or something. So I told her that you knew
  about everything. She didn't blink. She said I didn't have to sell her one� she
  just figured I would.� Vicki began caressing my nipples. My hand followed the
  shape of her hip. �I thought about it during lunch. Then I sold her a lease� for
  a crisp new one dollar bill. I'm rich you know. I've gotten �two' nice new
  crisp one dollar bills in one day.� She giggled. 
�So now what?� I asked enjoying the feel of her thighs. 
�Frankly, I'm just not sure. At first, I figured she just wanted a confrontation.
  Then maybe it was a novelty never to be used for anything. She said she was
  going to give it to Bobby as wedding or an engagement present� so he wouldn't
  be tempted to �step out' on her or something. But� the crate on Friday is� for
  her use.� Vicki began kissing my nipples. Softly I ran my finger tips along
  her spine, over her hips and up her thighs. 
�For her�� I asked with curiosity. �Is that good?� 
�Not sure� Though I'd give her a chance� she seemed like a nice woman� and
  Bobby thinks the world of her.� Vicki caught her breath as I began tracing
  lightly along the folds of her vulva. 
I had other interest in the moment. The conversation died as Vicki's labia,
  excited and enlarged protruded past the vulva. I continued tracing, caressing
  her labia until her clitoris rose from the attention. Slowly, softly I ran
  my finger tip about her stimulated clit. Vicki's tummy twitched. She moaned.
  It was nearly time for me to enter her. I loved making love to her. Her sex
  feels soooo gooood as it welcomes my manhood. Slowly I begin to move my cock
  inside her warm wet pussy. Her response is good. She moaned clutching me tightly
  into her. �Yes! Fuck my pussy�. Fuck me good. Yes!� I oblige enjoying her desire
  and passion. My wife buckles at the center cumming in a wonderful bonding orgasm.
  I release enjoying the sensations of filling her pussy with my cum. Yes! I
  love fucking my wife. 
We lay quietly cuddling. It was Thursday night. Tomorrow Vicki was being �crated
  and freighted' for the weekend. I missed her when she was gone. 
�Have you considered... I mean� being subject to a woman� she might� you know.� I
  whispered in the night. 
�Yeah, I've been thinking about that a lot today. I never even had a curiosity
  about being with a woman� once when I was a teenager� I had a dream� but that's
  about it. I'm not sure I want that to change either.� Karen spoke quietly. 
�So what do you think she's about this weekend?� I asked rolling onto my back. 
�I don't know. But I can't imagine that she'll have Bobby there, or another
  guy about� If you know what I mean.� Karen rolled to face me. 
�Yeah�� I mused in the silence. �So I guess you're planning on...� I faltered
  an attempt to soften the obvious. 
�It seems inevitable. I have just been hoping to avoid the situation. I mean,
  I really like men. I like what we have... I enjoy taking care of all my men� a
  lot.� She giggled. �I'm not afraid of women, or hate those that go that way�� she
  stammered, �I am just not sure I'm up to the reality of another woman� but
  then I'm sure that I won't get through the weekend without it going that way
  either.� She mused about the words in the darkness. I listened. 
�Seems strange that �I' the most conservative one, find myself in the position
  I do, faithful to you by being owned by others, servicing whomever, and now
  a woman� and this time because �I' sold �myself' into this situation� of my
  own choosing� and because I like the sex, the sensuality of being owned by
  someone.� Karen placed my firm cock at her wet mound, closing her eyes she
  sat slowly, softly, sensuously onto my cock. 
It was Friday PM when we crated Vicki. It took Vicki an hour of cleaning and
  fussing just to get the thing ready for use. It had sat in storage at the back
  of the garage for several months now. She wiggled and giggled as she sat onto
  the dildo protruding from the seat. Then I began to fasten and strap her into
  the crate. Ankles, thighs, wrists, and neck all locked securely into place.
  Then I worked the leather hood over her hair securing the laces snuggly. 
�You comfortable?� I asked with a touch of caution. 
�About as comfortable�.� I pumped once� twice� three times� on the ball gag
  inflator. �as�mmmmppphhhh.� The response became muddled by the swelling ball
  in Vicki's mouth. 
�Lastly the Electro-stim.� I said clearly as I flipped the switch. An immediate
  squeal emitted from the leather hood. I laughed then screwed the crate's side
  panel into place. I set the crate at the garage the same as last time. The
  phone rang almost before I had removed the hand truck from the crate. 
�I'll be right back. You okay?� I asked leaving the hand cart under the crate. 
A muffled, �Mummphh.�, was Vicki's response. 
�Hello.� I answered after the sixth ring. 
�Is the crate ready for shipping?� 
�Yes. Where exactly are you shipping her?� I asked with more concern than
  curiosity. 
�Locally� in town.� Karen responded. �Can you help me load the crate into
  my truck?� 
�I suppose so.� I answered more curious than concerned now. Almost before
  I hung up the phone a truck pulled up to the curb. She must have been up the
  street when she called. The tailgate had a lift which the woman, a cute blond
  thing, lowered before she got out. 
�Thank you. If you would put the crate next to the cab then I can tie it secure.
  We don't want to damage the cargo with any shifting about.� I tipped the crate
  enough to slide a hand truck under my crated Vicki walking her to the tailgate.
  The woman raised the gate. I corner-walked the crate to the cab. She began
  roping it off� rather skillfully I might add. In a few minutes the crate, Vicki,
  was tied securely to the cab and the bed of the truck. 
�See you Sunday night about ten.� She climbed into the cab and sped away with
  my wife, Vicki, crated like cargo in the back of her truck. 
�This is the crate I was telling you about. It is very fragile so be careful.� It
  was Bobby's voice Vicki heard as the two talked. �Just leave it in the center
  of the living room. I'll uncrate it later.� Vicki's sighed as she bumped to
  the floor. It was going to be awhile before she was freed. 
Questions raced wildly thru Vicki's mind. Did Bobby know? What did Bobby know?
  What had she told him? What was she going to do with her lease? Was she to
  be presented like this to Bobby� now� as an engagement gift� or later. Vicki
  did not want Bobby to see like this, crated, like cargo� not now. Vickis heart
  pounded as she waited. 
The door closed behind Karen and Bobby as they left while talking about dinner
  plans. Vicki sat in the silence of her crate. It was late when Vicki heard
  the door open. Two voices� 
�Make love to me here� in the living room.� She said leading Bobby to the
  couch. �Tie my hands to the crate� take me here� now.� 
�Okay.� Bobby began undressing his fianc&eacute;. Vicki listened attentively.
  Even though it was his fianc&eacute; jealousy raged wildly inside Vicki's mind.
  Bobby had been her lover, her man to fuck for many months. Karen was noisy
  as Bobby tied her hands to Vicki's crate. She struggled tugging and rocking
  Vicki's crate as Bobby tied her ankles to the opposing legs of the couch. Bobby
  began licking her twat. 
�Yes�. Yes� I'm cumming�. Yes!� She squealed. Vicki was sure that this was
  directed at her. Bobby grunted pummeling Karen's pussy. Tears welled up in
  Vicki's eyes. 
�Yes� Bobby� fuck me�� 
�I'm cumming.� Bobby grunted squirting his hot jism into Karen's pussy. Vicki
  flushed hot, angry with jealousy. It became silent. She struggled to overcome
  the reality of her situation. The logic of Karen's engagement did little to
  ease the anger, the jealousy, and pain in Vicki. 
Bobby left. The crate sat silently in the dark. Vicki's owner simply went
  to bed ignoring her completely� not even a tap on the side� a rude comment� nothing� just
  silence after the fucking. It was morning when Karen opened Vicki's crate.
  Vicki struggled with her emotions as the side of the crate opened. 
�Interesting, I've never seen the inside of the crate. I just made the shipping
  arrangements. This is Jack's own design.� She fondled Vicki's breasts examining
  each part of the crate. She took the hood off of Vicki. Vicki blinked struggling
  with the light of day. She left Vicki crated for another hour while she showered� and
  another hour while she fussed about the kitchen. It took another fifteen minutes
  for Karen to free her. 
�Ever been with a woman?� She asked sitting on the couch across from Vicki.
  Vicki struggled to her feet. Her legs cramped and wobbled. Vicki held to the
  crate stretching her legs. 
�No.� Vicki said focused on her stiff limbs. 
�Neither have I.� She said honestly. 
�And?� Vicki puzzled as she stood straight the pain almost bending her in
  half again. 
�I showered this morning. Take a shower. And we'll see how this works out.� She
  pointed to the hall. �I'll wait for you in the bedroom.� Karen stood leaving
  Vicki to herself. 
The shower felt good. Vicki had an inkling, a concern better said, that this
  is where things would be when she sold her the lease�if anything at all� but
  now facing reality it was more than a little intimidating. She did not desire
  a woman, though she had not been repulsed by it either. And in the light of
  the moment she had NO interest at all. That was in a large part, her delay
  at the signing, and in part the confrontational factors too. Yet she had signed
  the lease. Vicki dried herself. Wrapping a towel about her Vicki opened the
  bathroom door. Vicki had not packed an overnight bag in the crate. She had
  no clothing with her. She never used or needed clothing with Jack's �crate &amp; freight'
  trips. The blond lay waiting quietly wrapped in soft floral sheet. 
�I have been contemplating this since I found your phone number.� Karen spoke
  softly, barely above a whisper. �You see Bobby is into� well� you know� he
  likes to tie me up for sex. I like it too� and so do you or your number� well� wouldn't
  have been on his phone and all.� Vicki sat on the corner of the bed still wearing
  her towel. 
�Yes� and�� Vicki encouraged Karen to continue. 
�Well, you see I've been exploring this whole tying up� bondage type thing,
  on the internet. I thought that since you and I have Bobby in common I thought
  that we could help each other out by experimenting� learning� training each
  other. I want to learn more for Bobby� and I'm going to make a gift of you
  and I� as bondage partners, to him later� so I figure it would help you too.� Karen
  struggled with her nerves hiding behind a thin smile. 
�Okay. So, now what?� Vicki enquired, her curiosity peaking. She had never
  considered anything of the sort but the ideas Karen expressed did have a certain
  intrigue for Vicki's imagination. And it did explain Karen's purchase, her
  in-experience, and commitment to Vicki's presence. 
�Come here. For now I want us to get used to being together� I want you to� you
  know�� Karen blushed pointing to her waist. 
�Ah, yes�� Vicki dropped the towel wanting to slip quickly between the covers.
  She had never done � you know ' with another women either and frankly
  was at least as nervous as Karen seemed. That felt reassuring in some odd way. 
�You're bald� shaved clean.� Karen exclaimed as the towel fell to the floor. 
�No, laser shaven. Jack had all my hair from the neck down removed the first
  week he owned me. I haven't touched a razor since.� Vicki knelt to the edge
  of the bed. 
�That is absolutely stunning. I'm going to have Bobby do that to me. I mean
  I hate shaving my legs� much less trimming and preening.� She sat up to observe
  the smoothness of Vicki's sex. �May I?� She reached to feel between Vicki's
  legs. Vicki lay back into the pillows exposing sex to the woman's curious fingers. �Soft.
  No stubble or anything.� Vicki smiled. She was nervous but the touches felt
  good. 
�I'm sure Bobby would take care of it for you. He likes the feel too.� The
  woman seemed a bit taken back� momentarily� it passed. 
�That's right. You've been with my Bobby.� Karen chocked on her own words
  barely getting them audible. �I feel a bit out of my element. I'm more than
  a bit nervous about being here with you... and the whole Bobby thing too.� She
  sat back. 
�Me too. I've never done this with a woman so I am struggling a bit too.� Vicki
  began to caress her breasts. 
Karen closed her eyes relaxing into silence. Vicki kissed softly upon her
  nipples. Her nipples responded in a familiar manner. Vicki's touch found the
  woman's sex. She was wet. Vicki knew where to work magic upon her sex. Her
  fingers danced lightly subtly about the woman. Vicki pulled her hair back above
  one ear. Her sex smelled musky, strong. The tip of her tongue flicked across
  unfamiliar areas. It was tangy. Vicki let her tongue part the folds of the
  woman's sex. Slowly Vicki licked tracing lightly the tangy pungent folds of
  a woman. She began to twitch. Vicki focused her attentions again. The woman
  moaned. Vicki began slowly sucking on her clit. She came loudly. Vicki continued. 
�Don't stop� don't stop�� The woman came again and again, wave after wave
  of passion crashing thru her being. �Yes. Oh, yes.� She came wildly again. �Don't
  stop.� Karen rasped wildly after she came. Vicki noticed the flushing of vaginal
  moisture as she came. She avoided it. Karen came again� and again� and again. 
�No� lick me� suck me dry.� The woman chided begging Vicki to continue. Vicki
  did as she was told. 
�That was the best I've ever had! I've never had so many orgasms� like that� one
  after the other. Wow!� The woman bleated exhausted by Vicki's attention 
�Let's get dressed and I'll buy us some lunch.� She almost bounced out of
  bed. Vicki smiled following with a bit less enthusiasm. �I don't�.� 
�I took the liberty of buying an outfit for you to wear.� She called to Vicki
  from the bedroom. Vicki had arrived naked. 
�Where is that?� Vicki asked. 
�It is in the upper right draw of the vanity.� 
Vicki slid the drawer open. A new pair of suntan, shear to the waist panty
  hose� a dark blue bra� with a hole at the end of each cup� 36C so it should
  fit � in a manner of speaking�a shear lace black blouse� and burnt sienna skirt� almost
  knee length and spit up both sides to the waist � laced with black ribbon.
  It was not intended to close the gap just keep it from flapping open. 
�Interesting, do you really expect me to wear this thing?� Vicki presented
  the bra to Karen� a finger protruding through one of the holes. 
�Your choice actually, but the blouse won't hide much.� She smirked. She was
  right in that. It was a choice between being virtually bare breasted or the
  Holey Wonder she held in her hand. 
Vicki tried the blouse without the bra�. No� she would be arrested for public
  nudity. She fastened the bra, spun it around, bent over at the waist and adjusted
  it. Vicki stood to the mirror. As she expected, a nipple peaked thru one hole
  while the areola showed at the other. She adjusted it a bit further. Finally
  adjusted to fit, a nipple and partial areola protruded thru each hole� now
  erect from the fussing. It was simple enough� she was going to show something.
  The only real question was how much. Vicki put on the blouse. Her nipples showed
  though the lace of the blouse disguised most of her breasts. 
�I've got a few other surprises for you this weekend.� 
�I can't wait!� Vicki pulled on her hose grimacing at the thought. 
�I need you to cinch this up for me.� Karen had put on a pale blue corset,
  half cup shelf bra with laces at the back. I want to improve my waist line.
  I signed up at the spa to tone things but I am gonna use this until I get the
  size and shape I want.� Karen began to snug the laces. �Tighten it as tightly
  as you can to begin with.� Karen struggled mightily pulling hard upon the laces.
  Finally Karen slipped into her blouse. It was shimmering in the light but opaque
  and very light weight. It clung to every contour of her breasts� and nipples.
  Even in the bedroom overhead light shadows removed all doubt. Her skirt was
  a complimentary print flowing well past the knee� and split at the front� to
  the waist. There was enough fabric to allow coverage if she was careful how
  the split fell. With a quick flick of her wrist she thru the fabric back across
  her thigh. 
�Well, what do you think?� Karen had shaved her own sex. It was a tiny neat
  trail of light fuzz� a few inches tall, no more than two fingers wide� ending
  at her clit, which she had neatly shaved. �Not as permanent as yours but it
  makes a nice presentation, don't you think?� With that they we off to do whatever� 
Lunch was simple enough, Village Inn. �We look positively trashy!� Vicki whispered
  self-consciously. 
�Excellent!� Karen ate her lunch with fervor. Karen was much more eager for
  this than Vicki, though Vicki did understand and felt a genuine curiosity developing. 
Next stop was �Bed, Bath , and Beyond'� several large candles� those with
  several wicks and a fondue pot and the last stop was at a pet groomer's. 
�This is Brutus. I asked Bobby to get him just last week.� It was a four month
  old Lab, finely bread and groomed. She led Brutus to the car. Vicki sat silent,
  nervous, overwhelmed� and more than a bit intimidated. 
Karen drove along the road. The sun was warm thru the window. Vicki sat silent.
  Her mind was racing wildly considering the �Toys'� their conversations� and
  their attire. 
�Brutus is� a curiosity I came across while doing a bit of research.� 
�Do I dare ask?� Vicki said glancing sideways. 
�Oh, sure, you can ask. You may not like the answer but you can ask.� She
  said with a bit of a giggle. 
�I don't think I will. I'm sure I don't want to know just yet. And what if
  I don't want to go along with all this stuff?� Vicki asked flatly. 
�Same as always, you choose, but I think you will. And besides I want you
  to help train me too. I don't want to do anything with you that you don't try
  on me. And in time Bobby can play with both of us. At least that is what I
  hope will happen.� 
Vicki sat in silence fidgeting occasionally with the buttons of her blouse. 
�So?� She asked insisting upon a response. 
�I'm not going anywhere.� Vicki said with more than a touch of reservation. 
�Good.� It surprised Karen to have Vicki agree so readily. 
The drive to Karen's home passed in silence. Vicki listened to the panting
  of Brutus, the quiet hum of the engine, and a blue spring sky. She found it
  nerve racking and yet still it gave her time to consider things. So much had
  happened in the past few days� the passed few hours had been a trip too. She
  smiled to herself staring out the window. Maybe Karen was serious about sharing
  in this � do and be done ' thing after all. It could be interesting.
  She did enjoy being tied with Bobby. But this, this, bondage stuff. She mused
  at the odd turnings of things. 
Vicki had never expected things to go this way when she signed the Bill of
  Sale with Karen. In fact truth-be told she had not expected anything to come
  of it. She figured it to be a �revenge � embarrassment thing' to get even with
  her, though at some level she had contemplated something like this mornings
  tryst. And while Vicki did not consider herself a lesbian or homophobic for
  that matter or one to go both ways, she had considered the possibility and
  not found it revolting� curious was a better expression. Not curious of what
  it was to be with a woman but rather curious about what THIS woman might want
  of her. Her mind drifted. 
Vicki thought about her husband. Wait till he hears about this one! She smiled
  at the window in front of her. It was not often that she thought about him
  when she was with someone else. Usually her sense of the moment, her own passions
  and desires kept her in the moment. She was not given to fucking one while
  considering another. Vicki's passions kept her focused upon the cock inside
  her at the moment. That was okay too because she would make that same dedication
  to every moment with her husband. Once in a while she thought about him, missed
  being in HIS arms, and questioned where she was, what she was doing, and why.
  Those thoughts created conflicts in her. And seldom was it that she could just
  pack it in saying sorry I want to go home now. 
Vicki learned to accept the situations and her feelings. She loved her husband
  dearly and had NO desire to leave him. At times she wished they had never started
  this extra- marital stuff. But they had. And what's more she liked the attention,
  the responsibility to keep her men  well serviced; she liked the sex
  and didn't want to give it up now. Vicki smiled blushing at herself. 
But this� this was a new trip indeed. She was not at all sure where this was
  going, how she was going to feel about it, or why she felt compelled to follow
  it thru. All Vicki seemed sure of was the moment. Here she was and here she
  would be until crated and returned home tomorrow. 
Karen spoke. 
�I will be joining you  in Phoenix for a convention in three weeks.
  Jack wants me hostess, and you are to crated and freighted.� Vicki had not
  heard about this yet. She made a mental note to be sure and tell her husband� and
  get a few days off if needed. �What do you do there? I mean beside take care
  of Jack.� Karen asked over her driving. 
�Last time I was blind folded and displayed as a center piece at the buffet
  table� and upon occasion I have to take care of the incentives for a business
  prospect.� 
�You mean naked?� She exclaimed. 
�Oiled, and naked� and tied to the table top� with the buffet dishes all about
  me.� Vicki explained remembering vividly. 
�And Jack let someone, some business client� well, fuck you?� Karen stammered. 
�He � owns ' my sex when I am with him� just like you � own '
  me this weekend� Jack uses me when and how he wants� and he does  use
  me!� Vicki mused. �I had one guy, the first one we sold a lease to that never
  did much of anything. It was a bore. I'd much rather Jack use his lease than
  not.� 
�And me?� Karen asked quietly. 
�I'm here� you own me while I'm here� better to be used than no usedt  to
  be sure.� Vicki strained a wry smile. 
Karen pulled into the drive. The garage door opened. What might be next? 
�So now what?� Vicki asked as they walked inside. 
�Now it's your turn. I'm more than a bit anxious, but this has to be part
  of the deal. I've thought a lot about your sex this past week� so now it's
  time to make my part good.� Karen forced a thin smile. She was obviously uneasy
  about her thoughts but equally determined. 
�Come Brutus.� She called to her dog. Brutus bound passed into the house. �Let
  me take care of Brutus then I'll meet you in the bedroom.� 
Vicki thought better of asking about Brutus. But the thought of her getting
  a real good licking made her thighs blush. Karen followed Vicki to the bedroom.
  Karen dropped her clothes at the foot of the bed, except for the corset. Corset
  training would require nearly 24/7 attention or it would not be worth the effort.
  Vicki took little time in removing her clothes. After all it was her turn.
  Vicki's sex was itchy, warm, and wanton� curious too� her reactions about a
  woman in her twat. 
�Lay down.� Karen said softly. Vicki lay on the bed. Karen tied her to each
  of the four bedposts. She began kissing each breast while rolling the opposing
  nipple lightly between her thumb and fore-finger. She kissed, caressed, and
  licked her way to Vicki's sex. Finally Karen licked Vicki's vulva. She tasted
  salty. Karen tickled her swollen wet pussy with the tip of her tongue. Vicki
  groaned rocking her hips slowly to the attentions of Karen's tongue. She paused,
  twitched, her tummy contracted� she came Karen collapsed along side an exhausted
  Vicki. Together they slept thru the afternoon. 
Vicki awoke as Karen slipped from the bed. She listened quietly still tied
  to the bed posts. Karen was fussing about sacks she had gotten out of the closet.
  Vicki dared not think about the possibilities� yet curiosity won out. 
�Presents for me?� Vicki asked playfully. 
Karen moved to the bottom of the bed. Kneeling, crawling towards Vicki she
  placed the large eight inch soft black strap-on at the entrance to Vicki's
  sex. 
�Now I'm gonna fuck you.� She whispered pressing the tip firmly against her
  vulva. Slowly she rocked the tip along Vicki's slit� patiently she pressed
  forward� moisture began to lube her sex. Slowly the dildo began to enter Vicki's
  body. She groaned wantonly. 
�Ask for it�. Beg for it� I'm fucking you�� Karen stroked long slow thrusts
  grinding Vicki's clit. 
�Oooo� yyeesss�fuck my hot pussy�. Yes� fuck me� yes.� Vicki croaked. Vicki
  bucked in rhythm to Karen, cumming wildly. Karen beamed with delight as she
  humped her bound sub. Vicki nearly screamed with delight as she came bucking
  wildly against Karen's firm rubber cock. Karen pumped Vicki to exhaustion falling
  to her side, cuddling, caressing� sucking a firm breast. 
�You're not a bad first lay.� Karen quipped. �I can see why Bobby enjoys fucking
  you.� She giggled. Vicki smiled, her eyes closed in silent pleasure. 
�Now it's my turn. I want you to help tie me up securely. I have left instructions
  in the envelope� from an internet site� That way I can't change my mind.� Karen
  finished untying Vicki's wrists. She slipped Vicki's hood over her head. �I
  guess after I've tasted your sex the gag shouldn't bother.� Vicki untied her
  legs kneeling to Karen she laced the hood secure and pumped the gag. 
�Too much?� Vicki asked. 
�Nnnn� mmm� ppp�� was the hooded response. 
Vicki opened the envelope: 
&#149;&nbsp;Put the spreader bar between my legs. 
&#149;&nbsp;Put a pair of hand cuffs on my wrists. 
&#149;&nbsp;Spread a towel between the crate and the couch. 
&#149;&nbsp;Tie the spreader bar to the crate� your crate. 
&#149;&nbsp;Tie my cuffs to one leg of the couch. 
&#149;&nbsp;On the counter you will find a mix of honey and peanut butter,
  two small booties, and a digital camera. Spread a spoon full from my ass to
  and about my sex. Cover my pussy. 
&#149;&nbsp;Place the small booties on Brutus front paws. Use a bit of duct
  tape to keep them on his paws. 
&#149;&nbsp;Give Brutus a small spoonful of the peanut butter mix. 
&#149;&nbsp;Sit on the couch and take pictures�. 
Vicki followed the instructions. Karen's sex was swollen with anticipation
  and wet as Vicki spread the mixture about from anus to clit. Then Vicki let
  Brutus in from the back yard. He eagerly licked the stuff from the spoon. Vicki
  scratched his ears. He rolled onto his back. She took a minute to sit and scratch
  his tummy. Brutus was happy for the attention. Vicki went into the next room
  sitting on the couch. Brutus followed tail wagging happily. 
Click. Vicki took a picture of Brutus following her into the room. Curiosity
  brought Brutus to the fleshy object on the floor. He nudged Karen. She flinched
  slightly. He sniffed the peanut buttered bottom. Karen jumped as his tongue
  caught her crack. Instinctively she struggled against her ties. She was bound
  securely. She wiggled her bottom. It did not deter Brutus tongue as he licked
  the peanut butter away. His tongue caught the sent of her sex. Brutus began
  to act fidgety, ridged as he finished off the peanut butter. Vicki clicked
  eagerly with the camera. 
Brutus mounted Karen. 
�Nnnnnnnn��.oooooooo�� rrrrrrrrr�� uuuuu�..ssssss� mumbled from inside the
  hood. Vicki took another picture. A long red sausage like cock found her swollen
  wet sex. Before Karen knew what was happening Brutus had penetrated her� burying
  his cock deep into her pussy. Tightly Brutus held on pulling Karen to him with
  his front paws. She struggled with the weight and the ideas in her mind. Vicki
  took the pictures. Brutus began humping wildly�. And large red knot formed
  and disappeared into Karen. She came with a scream. Brutus humped� Karen squealed� Brutus
  turned his butt to hers� tied together�. Karen came again�. Vicki took pictures. 
It took just over ten minutes before Brutus slipped from Karen's twat with
  a messy whoosh. Sticky cum dripped onto the towel� and ran down her thighs.
  Vicki took pictures. Brutus limped to the kitchen to clean himself. Vicki took
  pictures. 
Ten minutes more passed before Vicki released Karen. 
�What a rush!! I was fucked by a damn dog!!� Karen paused. �Did you get it.
  Did you get the pictures?� She pointed excitedly at the camera. 
�Sure did.� Vicki sat back onto the couch handing the camera to Karen. She
  looked at most of the pictures. 
�Wild!� Karen looked glassy eyed as she looked thru the digital pictures. 
�I need a shower.� She disappeared into the bathroom. It was after four PM
  . Evening was right around the corner. Vicki considered Brutus carefully as
  he rounded the corner. 
�Well, I guess you got another good lay coming up big guy. I wonder if I'm
  up to it.� Vicki mused as she turned the TV on. �We'll soon find out.� She
  scratched his ears as she sat naked on the couch next to Brutus. He sniffed
  at her sex. �Later. You'll get that later.� She pushed him away for the moment. 
Vicki tried not the think about recent events. She had not found any offense,
  rather curiosity in Karen's sexual encounter with Brutus. But when those thoughts
  cross her mind with Brutus on her back�Vicki shuddered. It was her choice.
  Karen never pushed. Yet still Vicki knew she would go along. So she did her
  best not to ponder coming events. Live it in the moment�. Karen had seemed
  to enjoy herself� so how bad could it be� Vicki cleared her mind. 
Karen came out of the shower with her corset in hand. �I need to put this
  back on.� She handed it to Vicki. Vicki tugged each lace. It would take some
  doing to 
�re-shape' Karen as she had suggested. But better tried and failed than never
  to try at all. 
Karen slipped into a snug fitting pair of blue-jeans and flip-flops. Vicki
  was still naked� and yearning for some cover. 
�Do you have anything for me to wear?� 
�Sure do.� Karen returned to with a few things. She handed a light blue shelf
  bra to Vicki. Vicki looked curiously at Karen holding the thing with one finger. 
�When you are with me your breasts will always be on display.� 
�Oh.� Vicki began fastening the bra. Her breasts sat round, firm, and on display.
  The blouse was a simple aqua floral print, completely opaque about the back
  and sides� and thing white lace appliqu&eacute; adorned the bodice� across
  Vicki's breasts� prominently displayed and given only just enough cover with
  the appliqu&eacute; as to suggest coverage while still plainly visible. Vicki
  winked at Karen. 
�Cute� and in public� or with guests?� She queried. 
�As is.� Karen quipped. �There is a black vinyl skirt in the bottom drawer.
  It zips from top to bottom� no panties. We're going to go dancing tonight.� 
�Do you realize that we look like we are advertising, offering something,
  dressed like this in public?� Vicki asked she picked up the skirt. 
� You  are. They can look and touch. You cannot refuse the
  attentions� but no sex. That is mine. Now let's see. Unzip it from the bottom
  and two inches�yes, that will do nicely.� 
�Okay. And how much do you want to let them feel?� Vicki asked a bit miffed
  at the tenor of events. 
�If they're not blind, they can see what you have. Let them look. A few will
  want to touch. Let them� let them touch whatever they want.� Karen stood up
  from the sink where she was applying her make up. �Tell you what; we won't
  leave until you've been completely felt up� at least once. So it's up to you.
  You just have to tell me afterwards.� 
�That should be easy enough. With the advertising you are making me do someone
  will cop a feel before we get sat down.� 
�No, not just a feel� explored� felt up� completely� diddled� at least once
  tonight.� 
�Oh.� Vicki said quietly. �And you? Tell you what; let's make it interesting
  five bucks for each time I get felt up against five bucks for each time you
  get felt up.� Vicki challenged. Karen thought a moment. 
�Okay. But it doesn't count unless fingers actually touch sex� and ten bucks
  if you can get finger penetration but only in my presence� and twenty if you
  cum while we sit there.� 
�Nasty. You're just nasty� but it's a deal!� Vicki proclaimed. 
Karen and Vicki sat at a small booth next to the dance floor. The band was
  loud even if they weren't exceptional. It took a few minutes for someone to
  ask Karen to dance. Vicki left the booth before Karen finished the first dance.
  The next two dances passed easily now that they were both on the dance floor
  then came a slow dance. Karen's partner cuddled in close allowing his off hand
  to find the top of her bottom. She did nothing to deter him. Vicki's partner
  soon followed. 
�I like your blouse.� He smiled as he examined her breasts perched upon the
  shelf bra. 
�I don't think so� I think you like what you see.� Vicki corrected. 
�Sorry. I mean� I didn't mean to�� He blushed. She pulled him closer as the
  music droned on. 
�That's okay. If I minded I wouldn't have worn this outfit. Come sit with
  me.� Vicki asked as the music ended. Karen and her boy joined them. The guys
  ordered drinks. Vicki took her guys hand placing it under the table and directly
  in her lap. It took almost a full minute for his hand to find her flesh. Softly
  she patted his hand leaving him to his pleasures as the four of them visited. 
His hand caressed her thigh. She did nothing, except an encouraging smile
  as he tugged at a bit on the brass ring attached to her zipper. Carefully Vicki
  took hold of the off side of the skirt. Slowly the zipper slipped upwards� click� click� click�click.
  Each tooth of the zipper slipped open. Vicki held on to the skirt, not at all
  sure how far he was going to unzip her skirt. Besides she could always re-zip
  it in a few minutes. It took another song� and a second drink before his hand
  slipped onto the soft inner parts of her thigh. Vicki shifted in her seat.
  He froze. She opened her legs a bit allowing access to her sex. A smile and
  his finger tips brushed the Promised Land. She waited smiling, visiting; waiting� his
  finger dipped her wet sex. 
Karen smiled as she watched Vicki knowing what she was upto. Softly Karen
  slipped her guy's hand between the folds of her skirt and onto her leg. Slowly
  she slid it upwards thru the crack in her skirt. He diddle her sex� to abruptly
  to have any real interest to Karen, but a bet was a bet. 
Vicki winked at Karen and held her hand flat on the table showing Karen the
  five buck sign, then two fingers for a ten as a strange finger slipped inside.
  Karen nodded. Another song Karen winked at Vicki. It was time to dance again. 
Vicki leaned to Karen as they walked to the dance floor. �Ten.� 
Karen winced. �Five.� 
By the time Vicki and Karen were ready to leave it was 25 to 30 for Karen.
  Their last challenges were busy fingering each of the women. Both Vicki and
  Karen were �well-oiled'. Vicki looked directly at Karen. Her tummy twitched.
  It felt so good. She wanted to cum so badly. He sat quietly stroking her clit.
  Vicki caught her breath. Karen stopped talking knowing that Vicki was at the
  threshold of orgasm. Vicki looked at Karen, smiled, caught her breath again� a
  struggled to maintain composure as she came. Her body shook. Her voice broke.
  She barely missed a step in the conversation� as she came. Vicki pressed her
  legs together smiling at her escort. 
�You're fine� stay another minute.� She whispered into his ear. �I like your
  hand exactly where it is.� 
Karen was not going to cum� not here� not tonight. She knew that and knew
  that she would loose to Vicki� tonight anyway. The two women made their excuses
  taking a cab home. 
�Oh, fuck me� tie me up and fuck me� I need to be fucked.� Karen crooned as
  they giggled their way into the house. Vicki got out the ropes as Karen lay
  down. Vicki obliged tying Karen to the crate and couch� and then fucking her
  wildly with their soft rubber strap-on. Vicki loved it!! Karen came noisily.
  The two staggered to bed exhausted. 
Morning found Vicki sitting on Karen's face while sucking, licking, and eating
  Karen's sex. Karen was busily buried in Vicki's sex. The morning passed with
  noisy orgasms each woman taking turns fucking the other. Late afternoon found
  them lying lazily in bed� dozing� resting from the weekend. 
�One thing left.� Karen said as the sun began to set. �Brutus.� That was all
  Karen said. 
�Okay. I guess, though I really would rather not� honestly!� Vicki said flatly
  having forgotten about Brutus. 
�You want to be tied up or what?� Karen asked walking towards the closet. 
�No. I'm fine. Get him ready and I'll be right out. I want to use the bathroom
  first. 
Vicki took care of her business before walking out to the living room. Brutus
  was lapping at Karen's sex. 
�Are you going to do him or am I?� Vicki asked. 
�You are. Kneel down here.� Karen pointed to the couch. Vicki bent over the
  bench. Brutus began licking her bottom. It didn't take long before Vicki's
  sex was very ready. Brutus found her sex without much ado. Before Vicki realized
  it his cock was more than half buried in her pussy. Soon she was cumming wildly� this
  knot disappeared. Vicki was well fucked and tied� Karen took lots and lots
  of pictures. 
Vicki arrived on time. I helped Karen unload her crate. Karen was very pleasant
  and polite as she thanked me and left. I took my wife into the garage. 
�Karen left one last instruction. You are not to be uncrated until morning.
  I'll be back in the early morning. Night love.� I said tapping upon the crate. 
�Mmmppphhhh�� was all that was said as I turned the lights off. 
I set the alarm clock for an hour earlier than normal. It would take Vicki
  a while to unwind and clean up before work. Vicki was a bit cross about spending
  the night in the crate, but none the worse for wear. 
�How did it go?� I asked as she soaked in the tub. 
�Not bad really, very, very, different than anything I had expected.� Vicki
  said quietly. 
�So did you two?� I asked. 
Vicki looked at me and smiled. �What do you think? She owned me for the weekend.� 
�And was it fun� did you enjoy the weekend?� I pried a bit more. 
�It was really different. Yeah, I enjoyed myself. She has a plan of sorts,
  a reason for buying a lease. She wants me to help train her for Bobby� and
  she has quite the imagination.� 
�I want to own you� like they own me. So prepare a Deed and all for tonight� and
  I'll tell you all the details you want� after we complete the sale. 
�Hun, you do own me, we're married.� 
�Not that way. I want to own you like Jack and Karen own me.�
