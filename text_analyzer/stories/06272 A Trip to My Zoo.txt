1A Trip To My Zoo

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Welcome to my world. What you are about tp see may shock you.&nbsp; It may frighten you or it may even excite you.&nbsp; Whatever it does I promise it will interest you.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You are about to go on a tour of one my private sanctums. As a child I always loved going to the zoo and seeing all the animals.&nbsp; When I became rich or should I say when I became very rich I decided among other things to build my own zoo and stock it with one of a kind animals.&nbsp; Animals found&nbsp; no where else on earth, because I created them myself.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Here is the portal to my private playground, please come in.&nbsp; Before you stands a large corridor and if you look carefully you can see the many cages that line the walls.&nbsp; Since this a large zoo I don&#8217;t intend to walk.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll ride let me blow this whistle I have.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Yes here she is my private pony pulling my cart.&nbsp; Since you can&#8217;t see anything you&#8217;ll have to trust my descriptions.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The cart before me is rather small and light weight, it resembles a buggy you&#8217;d see for harness racing at the track.&nbsp; But the horse that pulls this cart is special.&nbsp; Missy is a white female about twenty five years old.&nbsp; She has long blond hair fixed in a pigtail.&nbsp; How appropriate you might think.&nbsp; Besides her harness she is wearing knee high black boots and a bit in her&nbsp; mouth.&nbsp; Protruding from her fanny is something I am very fond of, her tail.&nbsp; The hair of her tail is made from some of her own hair, how natural looking.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Let me sit down I have reigns and if she gets a little testy a whip.&nbsp; Missy is well trained, she can trot or gallop.&nbsp; I trained her to take high steps.&nbsp; Giddy up, and we are off.&nbsp; Missy was a horse trainer before she entered my service.&nbsp; I wonder if she ever guessed that some day she would be the horse?&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On your left you&#8217;ll notice one of my most colorful animals.&nbsp; She sits on her perch and sings for me.&nbsp; I call her Polly. How original, don&#8217;t you think?&nbsp; Polly is decorated in a skin tight body suit with her lovely breasts and pussy exposed for my enjoyment.&nbsp; The suit is covered with green feathers to match her green eyes.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve also had her hair feathered and tinted green.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now she will sing.&nbsp; Oh Polly won&#8217;t sing any top forty hits but she does chirp wonderfully, don&#8217;t you think?&nbsp; You see Polly used to be a Las Vegas night club singer.&nbsp; Now instead of singing in front of bars she sings behind them.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Here on my right you&#8217;ll something rather gross and disgusting.&nbsp;&nbsp; I call her Miss Piggy.&nbsp; From the size of her you&#8217;ll know she has not missed a meal in quite awhile.&nbsp; To be honest she weighs over four hundred pounds, that was the last time I could get her on a scale.&nbsp; Under all that mud she is wallowing in she is naked, in fact more than naked I had all her body hair permanently removed.&nbsp; You see Miss Piggy was my first wife, that was when she weighed a lot less.&nbsp; Her big mistake was calling me a pig once too often.&nbsp; If you look close you can see the wedding ring I gave her, she&#8217;s still wearing it.&nbsp; Of course she now wears it through her nose.&nbsp; See you later dear.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Next we have a more domestic animal, a cat.&nbsp; This feline is very special .&nbsp; In fact to me she is purrfect.&nbsp; Please forgive the pun.&nbsp; Her name was Kitty McCall and she was a stripper in Los Angeles.&nbsp; One night I caught her show and then later her.&nbsp; Kitty came out on stage wearing a skin tight leopard suit, which she preceded to remove.&nbsp; Of course now it&#8217;s on for life.&nbsp; She could really shake her tail.&nbsp; Kitty is rather docile since then.&nbsp; Here Kitty, Kitty.&nbsp; See how she licks my hand.&nbsp; How sweet.&nbsp; Just for that my pet I&#8217;ll make sure you get a warm saucer of milk before you go to sleep. What&#8217;s that smell?&nbsp; Oh yes and I&#8217;ll make your litter box is cleaned.&nbsp; Listen when I stroke her under her chin she purrs. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now we go to rather large animal.&nbsp; One of my favorite zoo animals was the monkeys.&nbsp; I always thrilled to their antics.&nbsp; Well here you the Queen of the Jungle.&nbsp; I call her Bushwoman.&nbsp; I was able to encourage her body hair cover most of her body.&nbsp; She looks rather contented with that banana in her hand.&nbsp; You see Bushwoman used to a professional wrestler.&nbsp; Now all she wrestles with is a banana and my patience.&nbsp; No, no you naughty monkey that banana is supposed to go into you mouth not down there.&nbsp; No wonder she never won much at wrestling.&nbsp; Never too bright.&nbsp; Look out I have angered her she is standing up and beating her chest in anger.&nbsp; You forget Bushwoman these bars are made of steel you can&#8217;t hurt me.&nbsp; Oops, not again luckily I moved just in time, you see she tried to get me by pissing on my shoes again. I lost two pairs that way last month.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Moving along we come to a large water filled aquarium.&nbsp; What&#8217;s that we see swimming about?&nbsp; Why it is a mermaid, a rather attractive one at that.&nbsp; Her long blond hair is flowing behind her as she swims.&nbsp; She is swimming in circles putting on a show for us. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;You see this mermaid used to part of a water ballet in Florida.&nbsp; You can see how her nipples press against the glass. What a lovely tail, or should I say fin on her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Whoa, Missy.&nbsp; Our tour is over for now.&nbsp; I hope you enjoyed my little zoo tour.&nbsp; Perhaps next time you stop by I could show my private living art Museum.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know what art is but I know what I like.
