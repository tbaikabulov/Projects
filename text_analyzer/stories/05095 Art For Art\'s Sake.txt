Dejeuner Sur L�Herbe

�I don�t
understand, Monsieur Manet, why would you think that
anything has happened to this young lady.� The gendarme was finding it
difficult to make any sense of what the gentlemen was saying but you got all
sorts here in Gennevilliers. They come from the city
with their strange ideas. Across the Seine. These Parisians were all the same.
The gendarme did what he could to encourage the gentleman to explain. Small
children were dashing around yelling, �flic,
flic, flic.�

&nbsp;

�Officer, I
was painting her picture, sitting here in the park��

&nbsp;

�In the outdoors, monsieur?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, yes,
here in the park, with these other gentlemen�

&nbsp;

�It looks
as if they are having a picnic.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, of
course, that was the picture.�

&nbsp;

�You were
painting a picture? Of a picnic?�� The police officer tipped back his kepi, and
looked sceptical.

&nbsp;

�Yes.�

&nbsp;

�In the open air?�

&nbsp;

�Yes.�

&nbsp;

�And the
young lady wandered off.�

&nbsp;

�Disappeared.�

&nbsp;

�As you say, disappeared. I don�t understand though why she should have
disappeared. Perhaps she just remembered that there was something she had to
do? Perhaps she met a friend? Perhaps she will return soon? You know what girls
can be like monsieur? Why do you think that she didn�t just wander off?�

&nbsp;

�Officer,
the girl was naked.�

&nbsp;

�Naked, monsieur?�

&nbsp;

�Naked officer. That is why I do not think she �just wandered off�.� 

&nbsp;

�Why were
you painting a naked girl at a picnic with these men?�

&nbsp;

�That is
not the point officer, the point is that the girl is missing and without the
girl I cannot continue my painting.�

&nbsp;

�Do not fear, monsieur. If you can rely on the Parisian gendarmerie
to do one thing, it is to find a naked girl in a park.�

&nbsp;

The F-111

Janine
Schenk was putting the finishing touches to her latest work, �SL�. She pulled
the protective goggles from her eyes but left the filter mask in place as she
peered intently at the painting�s minute details. A short blast from the air
brush added a tiny highlight at the corner of the classic dished top of a 1972
Mercedes 350 SL. Each tiny flaw in the original�s paint job was reproduced in
the painting. Every tiny fleck of rust in the chrome could be seen in the
picture. Every detail was perfect, super-real in every respect.

&nbsp;

She looked
across at the print of �The F-111� that hung on the wall of her studio and back
at her own work. Rosenquist would approve, she
thought.

&nbsp;

Then the
window came in.

&nbsp;

Janine
threw herself to the floor as bright blue splodges from a series of paint balls
spat themselves across the picture. She gasped in horror as the stream of paint
ball splatters edged across the floor of her studio, snaking towards her own
leg and slamming painfully into her thigh.

&nbsp;

Then there
was the acrid smell of burning turpentine and linseed oil as a bottle with a
flaming rag at its neck burst the other window, showering glass and flaming
liquid all around Janine. She screamed as she leapt to her feet and fled the
burning room.

&nbsp;

The
building was well ablaze by the time the fire service arrived. Janine sat
beside the road, sobbing with relief that she was still alive and with pain at
the loss of her work. She stared at the bright blue stain of the paint ball on
the thigh of her overall. She looked up at the fresh graffiti sprayed in the
same blue paint across the wall that faced her studio. One
word. �Pollock�.

&nbsp;

Damn, she
thought, it�s the Abstract Expressionists. That is going to mean trouble.��� 

&nbsp;

Bridge
Over A Pool With Water Lilies

They found
the girl from the picnic hanging in a cocoon of rope beneath a Japanese bridge
in a garden in Giverny, 80 kilometres away from where
she had disappeared. She was alive, still naked, shivering in the cold,
suspended inches from the surface of the water and the lilies that covered it. Wrapped in a knotted harness of Shibari
complexity she span slowly as the gendarmes tried to pull her to safety.

&nbsp;

Spray
painted on the walkway of the bridge, bright crimson letters spelled out:
�Impressionists � It�s time you saw the light.��
and �Manet? Monet?
What�s The Difference? Money!�� 

&nbsp;

The
Inspector of Police stared at the scene. It was clear that this was more than
some petty criminal at work. He didn�t trust these artists. So
emotional. So lacking in precise thought.
Perhaps it was some feud between factions. The Academi� would have to be involved.
More artists! He thought irritably. There was one man that could be relied on
to look into this, though, even if he too was an artist. He would have to talk
to Breughel.

&nbsp;

Two of his
officers had got a punt and were manoeuvring it under the bridge. The girl was
squealing as they tried to lower her into the punt. In time they succeeded.
Someone tossed a blanket from the bank to help keep the girl warm as they
brought her ashore. Removing the girl from the ropes that bound here took an
hour; each knot had been intricately tied.

&nbsp;

The girl
wouldn�t return to the park. The painting remained unfinished.

&nbsp;

Manet
felt discouraged. Seurat joked with him, trying to improve his mood. �Surely
you knew that impressionism would be no picnic.�� 

&nbsp;

Blue
Poles : Number 11, 1952

�Pollock?�
Pieter Breughel was taking the opportunity to gather as much evidence as he
could from the witnesses to the firebombing of Schenk�s studio. Janine was his
first port of call.� 

&nbsp;

�That�s
right,� said Janine. �The one word. It must be the
abstract expressionists.�

&nbsp;

�You
believe it is the work of them alone?� the quiet Dutchman quizzed the girl.
She�d found somewhere else to work. She was sitting cross legged on the floor,
her spray mask pushed down around her neck, her goggles up on the top of her
head, a smudge of paint across her right cheek. Her
paint stained overalls were unzipped slightly at the front. It was clear that
she had fallen out of bed and pulled them on without bothering with underwear.
He was finding it difficult to keep his mind on the job in hand. The air brush
compressor was still humming behind her. She was drinking tea from a thick
pottery mug. Funny, the Dutchman thought, I�ve never thought of an artist
taking a tea break.

&nbsp;

�How can I
know?� she said. �Abstraction still has many adherents.�

&nbsp;

�These
expressionists are too few. There must be others. Cubists
perhaps? Futurists? Maybe, at
worst, a grand coalition of modernists.�

&nbsp;

�Could they
hope to defeat the traditional? Surely they realise that the cause of
abstraction is lost; that representational art is all that matters? Even the
surrealists have embraced Dali again.�

&nbsp;

�Perhaps, perhaps not. The D�jeuner
kidnapping points to those who resent the early representational roots of
impressionism, don�t you think?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, I see
what you mean. But has your own work been attacked? Surely they would see you
as a leader for tradition?�

&nbsp;

�They may
think that the day of the Flemish painters is gone; that we have lost our
influence. I surmise that they only attacked Manet
because his work remains representational in every respect even though others
from his group have more in common with the modernists. Today representational
art is the province of the pre-Raphaelites and
super-realists like yourself.�

&nbsp;

The door
burst open. A man with expansive sideburns and wild eyes swept in. �It is
intolerable, intolerable!� he exclaimed.

&nbsp;

More
trouble, Janine thought. What brings Rossetti here? 

&nbsp;

�She has
gone. It is the work of the modernists, I am sure. They know I cannot work
without my model.�

&nbsp;

�Your model?�

&nbsp;

�Lizzie. My model and my muse. I left her only for a moment. I am
painting her as Guinevere.�

&nbsp;

The phone
rang, the Dutchman picked it up. �This is Breughel,� he said. �I see�. Yes, he
is here. � Of course. � We will be there at once.� He
put the phone down. �That was the police,� he said. �Outside the National
Gallery, a grey box has appeared on the vacant plinth. They want us to advise
them.�

&nbsp;

�Advise
them! Pa!� Rossetti spat. �They have their own Critics, do they not? Can they
not recognise cubism when they see it?�

&nbsp;

�Perhaps,
but they thought we should attend. They thought you should be there.�

&nbsp;

�Why?

&nbsp;

�It is what
is written on the box � �Medievalists!� it says �Can You Not Think Outside The Box?� � That is why they think you should see
it.�� 

&nbsp;

The three
made their way to Trafalgar Square. There, on the plinth, was the
featureless grey box. Perhaps a metre and a half on each side; it perched atop
the stone plinth, more enigmatic than the sculpted stone on which it sat. The
wording was formed from letters stencilled on as if the cube was some form of
packing crate.

&nbsp;

The police
parted the crowds to allow the Dutchman and the others through. He peered at
the cube. �Break it open,� he called.

&nbsp;

Two
officers leapt onto the plinth. With crow bars they levered up the top of the
box, sending splintering wood in all directions. �There is a girl inside,� one
of them called.

&nbsp;

�I am not
surprised,� said the Dutchman. They watched as the helpless woman was pulled
from the box. It was Lizzie Siddal, still dressed in
the costume of Guinevere but bound with straps and silenced with an elaborately
embroidered length of cloth.� 

&nbsp;

Freed from
her bonds, she fell sobbing into Rossetti�s arms.




The
Abduction of Rebecca

Janine had
been standing in front of the picture for almost half an hour. It was a rare opportunity
to see one of Delacroix�s greatest works. She had wanted something to take her
mind off the events at the studio and the exhibition was achieving all she had
hoped for. On loan from the Metropolitan Museum of Art, the picture dominated
the room in which it hung. In spite of its muddy muted tones, it managed to
convey the violence and desperation of the kidnapping vividly. 

&nbsp;

Janine
looked closely at the way in which the artist had rendered the scene, the way
in which the helpless girl lay, apparently unconscious, across the back of the
horse in the grip of her dark skinned abductor, the energy and animation in the
abductor�s horse. It was fascinating.

&nbsp;

She heard a
man�s voice behind her. �Good morning, Miss Schenk,� it said, quietly and
politely. �Please don�t turn around and please don�t make any sudden move. If
you wish for no harm to come to yourself or to this picture, please move to the
exit to your right.� As if to emphasise the risk to herself and the painting,
she felt the prick of a knife blade against her arm. She did as she had been
asked. 

&nbsp;

The exit
led from the gallery into a deserted corridor. Janine heard the door slam
behind her and almost at once felt herself grabbed.
She tried to cry out but before she could a sweet, sickly-smelling pad was
clamped over her nose and mouth. The more she struggled, the quicker she
inhaled whatever it was on the pad and she felt herself slipping into
unconsciousness. 

&nbsp;

Her last
recollection was of her knees buckling beneath her as she slid to the hard wooden
floor of the corridor and dark oblivion.���

The
Ambassadors

&nbsp;

�Do you
have any reason to suppose that the attacks will cease?� said Sir Lionel Bates,
the Chief Curator of the Tate Gallery as he sat beside his opposite number from
the National Gallery and three of the joint trustees. They peered across the
table at their guest.

&nbsp;

Lord Quimby, Andrew Vallance, Simon
Shan and Brian Seward all seemed impatient to hear what the Flemish painter had
to say.

&nbsp;

Pieter
Breughel coughed and shrugged his shoulders. He looked past his audience at
Holbein�s Ambassadors hanging on the wall behind them. That skull looks all
wrong to me, he thought. What he said was, �It seems unlikely. They have yet to
state their aims but disruption of the representational schools seems to be
their objective. Your colleagues at the Louvre have had no problems?�

&nbsp;

�No. Nor at
the Petit Palais, it seems..�

&nbsp;

�I thought
that would be the case. It is only artists, Manet, Rosetti and a few others, that
have suffered so far.�

&nbsp;

�Can you
rule out the risk of attacks on our own collections?� The voice was that of
Andrew Vallance, a well known art journalist and critic, one of the independent
trustees of the Tate and National Gallery Collections.

&nbsp;

�No, but I
do not think it likely on the basis of what we have seen so far. Their aim
appears to be to disrupt the work of artists rather than to attack their
completed works. They may change their tactics of course. I would advise you to
look to your security, especially at the Tate. Your change of policy, turning
your back on the abstract, may place you more at risk.� Breughel thought back
to the public incineration of much of the Turner Bequest. Even with his
orthodox views Pieter had found it hard to approve of that, found it hard to
watch the crowds cheering as the canvases crackled and spat in the flames.
Destruction of art, even decadent art was something he found difficult to
countenance and Breughel had never really worked out whether Turner had been
pursuing abstraction or had simply been losing his sight. Lord Quimby who had overseen the bonfires personally looked
uncomfortable. �What have you done to address the security situation
generally?� Pieter continued.

&nbsp;

�We had a
group of special forces troops carry out a sweep of Tate Modern at Bankside.� Bates responded.�
�It has been closed for a long time but the modernists still see it as a
totem of their corrupt vision for art.� 

&nbsp;

Seward
interrupted, �Amphibious forces landed from the Thames. Others landed on the roof and
abseiled down into the Turbine Hall.�

&nbsp;

�And?�
Breughel was irritated by the unnecessary detail.

&nbsp;

�A few
dissident groups holed up in some of the galleries. There was a little blood.
The survivors are in custody but they haven�t said anything to assist us yet.�

&nbsp;

Breughel
was not surprised. The attacks were something new; existing groups would have
been kept in the dark. There was no need to involve them in carrying them out
so why tell them about the planning?

&nbsp;

Breughel
got to his feet. �I will do what I can,� he said. �But I can make no promises.�
The two curators shook him by the hand. The three men left the others made
their way towards the portico that gave onto Trafalgar Square. 

&nbsp;

Breughel
looked up, puzzled as they passed one of the gallery�s paintings.� �I wouldn�t have thought pop art was the sort
of painting exhibited here,� he said.

&nbsp;

�No, not our thing at all. Far too close to the abstract,� said the
curator of the National Gallery. �Why?�

&nbsp;

�Perhaps
you could explain this, then,� Breughel said, pointing at the collage hanging
between Raphael�s 'The Madonna of the Pinks' and Titian�s 'Bacchus and Ariadne'.

&nbsp;

�This is
not our picture!� the curator exclaimed, seeming to see the work for the first
time. 

&nbsp;

Pieter
Breughel looked more closely at it. The picture was made up of a series of
words and letters cut from magazines and newspapers. �Where is Schenk?� they
said, �Can you save her from reality?� and �Embrace the abstract or Schenk will
embrace the void.� He peered at the label on the frame. �The fate of the super
realist artist?� the title said. There was no indication of the name of the
artist responsible, the work wasn�t signed. Breughel sighed. He wasn�t
surprised but some of the artists he knew would have been stupid enough to do
so.

&nbsp;

�Schenk?�
the curator of the National Gallery enquired. �Janine Schenk? Her studio was
firebombed, wasn�t it?�

&nbsp;

�Yes,� said
Breughel. �But now I fear something more sinister may have occurred.�

&nbsp;

Breughel
was peering closely at the frame of the picture. He plucked something from the
gap between the gilded gesso frame and the canvas. �What�s that?� said Vallance. He, Seward and Shan had followed them out. �A clue?�

&nbsp;

�Perhaps,�
said Pieter. �It is some sort of seed. A sunflower, I think.�

&nbsp;

�Well,�
said Vallance, �I think we all know who that points to.�� 




The
Martyrdom of Saint Sebastian in a Field

&nbsp;

Janine
awoke. She could see herself in a mirror on the far side of the room. She was
tied bizarrely to an artist�s easel. Her arms were pulled back behind her and
fixed to the top bar of the easel. Her hands dangled limply but to her left
wrist was tied a bunch of brushes, to her right a paint stained pallet. Her
mouth was stuffed with a cloth that tasted disgusting and stank of turpentine
and oil paint. She was naked from the waist up but her sex was covered with a
loin cloth. Immediately at her feet, pointing terrifyingly towards her belly,
was a large crossbow, its bolt sitting menacingly in place, its string drawn
and cocked.

&nbsp;

She stood
still, terrified to move in case she dislodged the crossbow and triggered it in
some way. She looked out across the room. Arranged around its edge were dozens
of small clay figurines. Their limbless forms, featureless apart from their
socket like eyes, only six inches or so high, had a sinister air. Each had been
positioned so as to seem as though they were apparently staring, sightlessly,
at her.

&nbsp;

Her
shoulders and elbows ached from taking her weight as she had hung from the
easel. Now conscious, she tried to ease herself upwards to lessen the pain from
the ropes. She tried shaking her head to see if she could dislodge the cloth in
her mouth. She couldn�t.

&nbsp;

As she
lifted her head she was blinded by a camera�s flash. Once, twice, three times
the flash went off. Dazzled by the flash, Janine blinked and then saw a tall
man in a ski mask staring at her as he lowered his camera.

&nbsp;

�Miss
Schenk,� the man said. �You should appreciate this. What could be more
super-real than photography.

&nbsp;

�Goart goo ough
arng?� grunted Janine through her gag. �Egg ee o!�

&nbsp;

�How
interesting,� the man responded. �I had never previously realised that the gag
is, of course, a means for producing an abstraction of speech. It seems that
even you realists can contribute to our understanding of the abstract. How
wonderful! But in answer to your question what I want is to keep you here for a
while. And you can be assured that I have no intention at all of letting you
go.�

&nbsp;

Janine
scowled at the man. He smiled back. �There, you see, perfect understanding of
abstract speech. It goes to prove that the prejudices of the realists about the
comprehension of abstraction are unfounded.� He came closer too her, reached
out and toyed with one of her naked breasts, deriving evident pleasure from the
act and from Janine�s response. He chuckled. Janine growled and tried to
struggle against the ropes that held her tied to the easel. �Careful,� the man
said. �That crossbow bolt is not an abstract concept.�

&nbsp;




Hatstand

&nbsp;

After
finding the sunflower seed, Pieter had tried talking to Vin Gogh. It hadn�t
been fruitful. Vincent, the poor man, wasn�t well. Pieter found it hard to
believe that he was involved in this. The sunflower seed was almost certainly a
diversion, a vegetarian red herring. In any case he hardly expected the
modernists to be so obvious, letting people understand what they were on about
was hardly a big thing for them, he thought, permitting himself a moment�s
cynicism about the abstract movements. 

&nbsp;

Now he
found himself in unfamiliar surroundings. Jones and Blake were not his normal
choice of dining companions. He looked to his right. A largely naked woman
stood with her hands held out to either side, palms upwards, balancing his own
hat on one, and Blake�s cap on the other. Jones�s work verged on the abstract
at times. Blake, for all his enthusiasm for the pre-Raphaelites,
still seemed to yearn for the questionable objectives of the pop-art school.
Over on the other side of the bar Caravaggio and Georges De La Tour were
playing cards. Breughel looked at them warily. They were both notorious cheats.
They probably had enough cards hidden about their persons to make another two
decks. It could only be a matter of time before a fight started.� 

&nbsp;

Pieter�s
attention returned to his Jones and Blake. Jones was complaining, while looking
at the girl that was holding Breughel�s hat. �It is so hard to get the
materials,� he said. �Now I have to make do with a real woman.�

&nbsp;

Blake gave
him a sympathetic grunt, but he�d never found it a problem to find the things
he needed for his work, even if it meant scouring garage sales.

&nbsp;

Breughel
began the conversation. �I�m looking for a girl,� he said.

&nbsp;

Jones
nodded his head towards his hatstand. �She gets off
at ten,� he said.

&nbsp;

Pieter
shook his head. �A specific girl,� he said. �Janine Schenk, the super-realist.
She is missing. Not seen since she set off to view the Delacroix retrospective.
There is someone on the other side who knows where she is.�

&nbsp;

�The other side?�

&nbsp;

�A modernist.� Blake and Jones looked uncomfortable. �Gentlemen, I understand your
reservations. Your own art has come close to being proscribed.�

&nbsp;

�My current
work conforms entirely to the Ministry�s directives,� Jones muttered. He
gestured to the woman hatstand. �What could be more
realistic than that?�

&nbsp;

�As indeed
does mine,� Blake concurred.

&nbsp;

�Of course, of course. Freedom of expression has become so difficult in these times. But you
still have your contacts. Those that have been less ready to
accept that abstraction is a degenerate form of art. All I am seeking is
some help. Blake, you are still meeting with others of the Brotherhood of Ruralists, I am sure.��


&nbsp;

�But they
are all realists. Everyone. Representational artists
like myself.�

&nbsp;

�And you
Jones, your occasional liaisons with Emin? I suspect
they still continue.�

&nbsp;

�She and I
share certain tastes.�

&nbsp;

�Outside
the studio, as I understand it.� Breughel raised his eyebrows.

&nbsp;

�That is
hardly relevant. I don�t believe the Ministry of Art has yet ventured into the
area of personal relationships,� Jones blustered.

&nbsp;

Breughel
was satisfied that he had disturbed the two of them sufficiently. He felt sure
that they or their contacts would know something about this. Now he just had to
wait. �Gentlemen,� he said, getting to his feet. �Please be sure to let me know
if you hear anything of Miss Schenk. I know the Ministry will be most pleased
to hear that you have cooperated.� He grabbed his hat from the hand of Jones�s
woman. She looked disappointed that he was paying the hat more attention than
her.

&nbsp;




Perseus and Andromeda

&nbsp;

The
photograph had been posted through the door of his London flat. Breughel had torn open the
blank, white envelop to see the trussed and gagged form of Janine staring out
at him. The peril she was in from the drawn and cocked crossbow was obvious.

&nbsp;

Scrawled
across the photograph it said, �Will Miss Schenk get
the point of abstraction?� There were no demands. No other clues.

&nbsp;

Brueghel
took out his lens and examined the picture closely. These
optics were becoming invaluable, he felt. Even Holbein was using them to help
with perspective according to Hockney. Pieter studied
every detail. He noted down his thoughts on the curious clay figures, the
splodges of paint on the palette that dangled from Janine�s left wrist and the
dome of the church through the barred window behind her.

&nbsp;

The picture
was the first of a series, each with a caption taunting Breughel and the
Trustees.

&nbsp;

The second
showed Janine tied to a stake, a cross wedged in her cleavage. A reasonable
facsimile of the Jan Styka picture of Jean D�Arc, Breughel thought but the church in the background
was definitely not Rouen Cathedral. The kidnapper�s scribbled words this time
spelled out, �Overturn the heresy of representational
art! Restore the abstract! Release the cubist internees!�

&nbsp;

At least we
now have some demands, Breughel thought.

&nbsp;

He had
spoken again to Jones and Blake. They were clearly worried but had discovered
nothing. Breughel wasn�t entirely surprised. He had his own ideas. He was
beginning to build up a picture of who might be behind this. You didn�t spend
as long as he had watching Flemish low life without having some appreciation of
the darker corners of the human soul.

&nbsp;

The third
photograph arrived while Lord Quimby was interviewing
Breughel about his progress. �Perseus and Andromeda,�
said Quimby as Pieter showed it to him.. 

&nbsp;

Breughel
nodded in agreement looking at the picture which showed Janine naked and in
chains against a rock. �Yes,� said Pieter, �though in the version by Vasari, I
don�t think that Perseus was wearing a ski mask and
to the best of my recollections he was unchaining the girl rather than adding
to her fetters.�

&nbsp;

Quimby
looked at the scene. Even the background seemed to reflect the original picture
although of course it showed the bars of Janine�s prison rather than the coast
of Ethiopia, the Nereids and the
sea monster.

&nbsp;

�Our
protagonist is a knowledgeable man,� Breughel said. �The painting by Rubens is
better known but Miss Schenk�s rather slim body is better suited to the Vasari
pose.�

&nbsp;

Lord Quimby turned the picture over. On the back were more,
handwritten demands. �Re-open MOMA.! Release Braque!�� He
looked at Pieter. �These demands are impossible to respond to,� he said. �You
know that we cannot dismantle all that has been done to suppress modernism
simply to satisfy this lunatic.�

&nbsp;

�Of course,
Lord Quimby,� Breughel responded. �I would not
recommend conceding. Besides, I think I can identify where Miss Schenk is being
held.�

&nbsp;

Quimby
looked delighted if surprised. �Wonderful,� he said. �What will you do now?�

&nbsp;

Breughel
got to his feet. �I need to talk to some friends,� he said. �We needn�t worry
the authorities. I�ll let you know when things have been progressed.� 

&nbsp;

Lord Quimby nodded. �Very well,� he said, �We depend on your
judgement.� Shaking Breughel�s hand he took his leave.

&nbsp;




The
Night Watch

&nbsp;

Breughel
looked at the group of artists assembled in his room. �Thank you for coming,
gentlemen,� he said. �Your help is appreciated.�

&nbsp;

Jan Vermeer
looked up. �Huh,� he said. �It is the least we could do. One of my own models
was attacked. You met her. Attractive girl. Looks a lot like Scarlett Johansson. Had a blue headscarf on
when you came over; likes pearls. She saw the attackers off though.�

&nbsp;

Pieter
remembered the girl. He�d thought the painting had shown promise although he�d
felt that �Girl In A Blue Headscarf� was a rotten
title for a picture.

&nbsp;

Frans
Hals and Peter de Hooch added their grunts of support.

&nbsp;

Breughel
outlined the mission. He had identified the building where Janine was being
held from the churches in the background of the photographs. That was the good
thing about Wren�s churches, the spires were all
fairly distinctive. It hadn�t been hard to triangulate where the pictures had
been taken, given the view of St Clement Danes. It was a rough area these days.
He expected trouble. The team was armed. 

&nbsp;

It was
dark. Breughel�s team assembled in the courtyard. Vermeer lobbed a stun grenade
through the window. In the wake of the detonation, Hals and de Hooch burst
through the door. Splintered wood showered the corridor beyond. Three armed
guards were recovering from the concussion of the grenade but gathered
themselves enough to begin returning the team�s fire. One of the guards caught
a bullet and sank down, blood oozing from a chest wound. His
weapon scittered across the floor away from him.
The other two fell back along the corridor, trading bullet for bullet as they
turned the corner at the far end. Pieter�s team pushed forward slowly. The
returning fire stopped. A curious calm spread through the smoke filled
corridor.

&nbsp;

Then came two distinctive coughs from a silenced pistol. Breughel realised at once what had
occurred. �Forward,� he urged. �Quickly.�� 

&nbsp;

The team
reached the end of the corridor. As they turned the corner they saw the
remaining two guards slumped on the floor, evidently dead. From the neat single
bullet hole in the head of each, Pieter knew that his team hadn�t been the
cause. The door out to the rear of the building was swinging loose. They ran
towards it and reached it just in time to see the tail lights of a speeding car
leaving the yard.

&nbsp;

Pieter,
following the team, heard Vermeer cursing at the realisation that their quarry
had escaped.

&nbsp;

Then there
was the muffled grunt. Pieter turned to the door to his right. �Break it down,�
he shouted.

&nbsp;

De Hooch
smashed his gun butt against the door lock. The door swung open. Behind it sat
the helpless, captive, Janine. 

&nbsp;




A Woman Drinking with Two Men and a Serving Woman

&nbsp;

Breughel
was back once more in the board room of the National Gallery. Vallance, Bates, Quimby and the
others were there. 

&nbsp;

They�ve had
the floor cleaned, Pieter thought. All those black and white
tiles. De Hooch would approve although hanging one of his pictures in
this room as well made your eyes cross.

&nbsp;

Vallance
was arguing with Bates as Pieter and the others arrived. �Of course I should
review it,� he was almost shouting, gesticulating wildly at the De Hooch. �Just
because it�s only a picture of four people in a room doesn�t mean it doesn�t
need explaining!�

� 

Bates tried
to calm him as he saw the others. �I see you succeeded in rescuing Schenk?�
Bates stated obviously; Janine and Jan Vermeer were sitting alongside Pieter.
�Well done. I trust that you are well, Miss Schenk,� he said.

&nbsp;

�There was
some violence,� said Janine, �but I saw worse when I was working with Banksy. I am quite all right, thank you. I am just sorry I
can give you no clues about the perpetrator. He wore a hood at all times.�

&nbsp;

�It was a
shame that Miss Schenk�s abductor seems kept himself masked. And a pity about
those three guards,� Vallance volunteered. �They
could have provided useful clues. Perhaps even the identity of our opponent.�

&nbsp;

Breughel
sat quietly for a moment. �Oh, but they have,� he said.

&nbsp;

Vallance
looked puzzled. Bates leaned forward. �How so?� he said.

&nbsp;

Breughel spoke slowly. �There are a number of indications.
The testimony of the guards, is the confirming piece.
I had wondered it the person behind this could be an artist. Attacks
on models? Studios? Even the modernists use
such things. There would be fear of reprisals. And the
guards; that brutal execution, that callous disregard for life. No, this
has not been done by an artist. Who had the motive?&quot; Breughel stared
around the room. His audience looked puzzled, shuffling their feet like
schoolchildren confronted by a school master's rhetorical interrogation. Breughel, gathered himself up and continued. &quot;Who else but a critic? What do the artists care? Apart
from a few reactionaries they are happy to adopt a realist style � at least in
public. But critics? Realism is all too easy isn�t it?
What need is there for critics if the public can understand art for themselves?
The suppression of abstraction has made it harder for a critic to justify his
existence, hasn�t it? I had come to that conclusion already but now, Vallance, you have now confirmed my thoughts. It was a
critic. In fact, Vallance, it was you! It had to be
someone with access to the galleries here � how else would that pop-art collage demand have found its way onto the walls? Of course,
you are familiar with the alleys behind Fleet Street because of your work with
the London newspapers and that is
where we rescued Miss Schenk from. And your own critical past has not been
without controversy has it, Vallance? You were one of
the opponents of the plans to roll back the tide of modernism.�

&nbsp;

�Ridiculous,�
Vallance blustered. He turned to his fellow trustees.
�That was when I was at college. You cannot believe him! It�s absurd; purely
circumstantial evidence.�

&nbsp;

�Perhaps,�
said Breughel, �but then maybe you can explain how you knew there were three
guards? I had not provided that detail. Neither had any of my
colleagues. But you would have known if you were there; if you had
pulled the trigger that killed two of them. I think that will be good enough
for the courts.�

&nbsp;

�Damn you,
Breughel,� Vallance yelled leaping to his feet.
�You�ll not succeed in stopping the revival of abstraction.� He pulled a pistol
from his jacket and levelled it at the head of the Flemish genre painter before
waving it wildly around the room at the others.�


&nbsp;

There was a
hiss. A stream of yellow ochre paint spread itself across Vallance�s
face, blinding him. Breughel knocked Vallance�s hand
upwards. The gun went off, its bullet lodging itself in the gallery�s ceiling.
Vermeer wrestled the critic to the floor, locking his wrists in handcuffs. And dealing him a short kick to the ribs in order to discourage
further resistance.

&nbsp;

Breughel
turned to Janine. �Thank you Miss Schenk, that was very quick thinking,� he
said. Janine was returning the can of spray paint to her handbag. 

&nbsp;

�That�s all
right, Pieter,� she said. �I never could stand fucking critics.�

&nbsp;

&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt; THE
END &gt;&gt;&gt;&gt;
