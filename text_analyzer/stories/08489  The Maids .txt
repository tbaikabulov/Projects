 The Maids 
Provided By: BDSM Librarywww.bdsmlibrary.com
Synopsis:        The maids are a special class of people in the Femina Empire, not slaves, but not quite women, either.






Lisa turned to Her maid and said "Dear Bambi, Please tie these males up in the
traveling restraints and get the slave chain ready with the others also. And get
my Pony boys ready. Let me know when it is ready." "Yes Ma'am." 

The maids were completely different from the slaves. After the Women on Sabrinia took over
control of their planet,they soon realized that it would be necessary to have
individuals to fill a sort of "middle management" position, not quite slaves,
but not quite Mistresses, either. They decided then, to form a class of "maids",
who had male sexual organs but were in every other way women. These are not to
be confused with the so-called 'trannies' or 'shemales' of former Earth society,
who were really males but wanted to masquerade as women, and hence making
themselves guilty of one of the worst blasphemies possible. The maids, on the
contrary, are genetically bred to be absolutely indistinguishable from real
women except for their penis and testicles. In fact, the maids are, on average,
more petite and have other more exaggerated feminine features than do the Women
rulers. They are permitted free use of their sexual organs, provided they never
showed an erection to a Women, for the sight of any erect penis is, of course, a
serious insult to Womanhood. The maids, therefore, are always very careful to
keep their sex organs covered whenever they're in the presence of a Woman.

There are approximately 3 to 4 maids per woman in the population, and they fulfill
all roles that slaves are not qualified to do, but that would be too tedious for a woman
to perform. For example, overseeing slaves, most police work, etc.
