Note: This is a story I
started a long time ago. Initially, it was a typical love story about a woman
finding love and happiness through submission. Unfortunately, it was too damned
typical, lacked flow and lost my interest. 

&nbsp;

After a few other false
starts I finally found the inspiration I needed to complete this tale. That
inspiration came in two places � a personal friend (You know who you are) and a
new BDSM Library contributor (Benfan) to whom I give
thanks. You guys got me hot to trot to complete this tale.

The Object of His Affection

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Prologue

&nbsp;

James met Debbie shortly
after his high school graduation. She was a few years younger than he and the
sister of a high school acquaintance. Despite their age difference,
they hit it off as friends.

&nbsp;

After leaving business
school to pursue a career in programming, James created a contact data base
program that became quite popular across many industries. After licensing the
program and making a substantial fortune he went into semi-retirement, working
only when he so chose.

&nbsp;

Debbie, once finished with
high school, picked up a job as a sales person at a local appliance dealership:
a job she held for several years. It was a good living, if not satisfying. Her
co-workers were friendly, if not particularly interesting or intelligent and
she had good benefits 

&nbsp;

Over the ensuing years, they
would share their lives with each other, occasionally going to lunch or dinner
and confiding in each other.� Most often,
they would spend long hours discussing their lives over the phone. 

&nbsp;

To say it was an odd
friendship would be to minimize the truth of the matter. James had come to love
her in ways that can only be described as &quot;big brother-like&quot;, while
still harboring a deep physical and emotional attraction for her. In short, he
wanted her in his bed more than he had any other woman.� Despite this he had kept her at arms length,
respectful of their deep and profound bond of friendship.

&nbsp;

Debbie saw James as a
&quot;girlfriend&quot; with whom she could share her deepest, darkest desires
and fears. She loved him very much and could not see herself living without him
being there for her. And, much like he felt, she was also very attracted to him
and wondered what it would be like to have him touch her in a less chaste
manner.

&nbsp;

Unbeknownst to James,
besides harboring an abiding love for him, Debbie was quite fearful of him
because of his knowledge of her true nature. The fact that he
had spotted her submissive side, when no one else had, coupled with his
knowledge of her extremely suggestible and active libido, was almost too
frightening to bear.� Beyond all
that, she was rather fearful of the many terrible things he had described doing
to women during their long conversations. These factors, more than any other,
were what had prevented them from ever coming together as a couple.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The Object of His Affection
� Awakening 

&nbsp;

����������������������� 

&nbsp;

James entered his lonely
domicile, dropping his keys on the coffee table and heading to the kitchen for
a much needed beer. As he passed through his living room, the phone rang.� Picking up the phone, he checked the caller
ID. It was Debbie. Immediately, he clicked the &quot;ON&quot; button to receive
her call.

&nbsp;

&quot;Hey, babe, how's it
going?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Not bad, you?&quot;
she said.

&nbsp;

&quot;Same
old.&quot; 

&nbsp;

The long breath on the other
end told him that this would be a serious conversation. No doubt, it would be
about her boyfriend, a man who he disliked, despite never meeting him. His past
conversations with her had given light to the fact that her boyfriend was quite
the unappealing sort.

&nbsp;

&quot;Uh oh, what did he
do?&quot; he asked in a flat tone.

&nbsp;

&quot;Damn it, he didn't do
anything.&quot; she said. &quot;It's what he wants to do.&quot;

&nbsp;

He grinned. &quot;Let me
guess...he wants to tie you up, spank the hell out of you and fuck you up the
ass, right?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Shut up.&quot; she
told him. &quot;But yeah, sort of...&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I'm all ears,� he
said, chuckling.

&nbsp;

&quot;Well,&quot; she began
&quot;Tony told me that he wants to tie me up. Actually, he did once. Anyhow,
it was not big deal, he just used a scarf on my wrists
to tie my hands over my head.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Um, in bed, I am
assuming?&quot; he asked.

&nbsp;

&quot;Yeah...anyhow, I broke
the scarf.&quot; she started.� Well, Tony wants to really tie me up. With ropes or chains or something.&quot;

&nbsp;

James listened to her as she
drew her next breath and stammer to say more, finally interjecting� &quot;So, you're afraid of it but you
want it at the same time?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes.&quot; she
whispered.

&nbsp;

James was sure of where the
conversation was headed. She was waiting for him to say something but he wanted
her to go forward on her own, enjoying her struggle.

&nbsp;

&quot;Well, what do you
think?&quot; she finally asked, frustration in her voice.

&nbsp;

&quot;Go for it.&quot; he
said. &quot;Let him tie you up.&quot;

&nbsp;

She growled at him. &quot;Fucker! You know it's not that easy for me.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Okay, let me
guess...you're afraid that if you are really tied up that you won't be able to
stop him from doing things to you that you don't want to happen?

&nbsp;

Debbie took a deep breath,
affirming his question with a grunt.

&nbsp;

&quot;Well, Deb, the way it
goes is like this...&quot; he began. &quot;If you let
someone tie you up, you are letting them have control over you and your body.
So, anything that you don't want no longer
matters.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;That's what I was
thinking.&quot; she said. &quot;What if he does things that I don't want to
do?&quot;

&nbsp;

He sighed. He had been down
this road with her a hundred times, explaining the dynamics of a BDSM relationship.� She knew his thoughts on bondage and
permissions given. Still, he felt compelled to go over them again.

&nbsp;

&quot;Debbie, if you let him
tie you up, you are giving him license to do whatever
he wishes,� he said. &quot;It doesn�t matter what is said before hand...if you
allow it you allow him anything.&quot;

&nbsp;

They meandered off of the
subject for a while, speaking of other factors in their lives. Eventually, it
came back around to bondage and the possibilities that go with it.

&nbsp;

&quot;Deb...you're afraid he is going to fuck your ass. That's what this
is about, isn't it?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes...I never let my
ex-husband do it to me and I am not letting him do it,&quot; she said. &quot;He
has tried to cum on my face, too. That ain't ever gonna happen!&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Then it's simple.
Don't let him tie you up.&quot;

&nbsp;

Again, the conversation slid
into other areas. For a short time they discussed work and family and various
things. Still, the conversation came back around to her predicament.

&nbsp;

&quot;Are you going to help
me or what?&quot; she shouted at him.

&nbsp;

&quot;With
what?

&nbsp;

&quot;James, you're a
fucker,&quot; she said, laughing. &quot;You know I am going to let him tie me
up. But, I don't want ropes. You told me before that it could be unsafe if the
person tying you...if he doesn't know what he is doing.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;You need cuffs and a
couple of chain dog leashes,&quot; he said. &quot;That's all. You can get the
leashes anywhere and go to a sex shop for the cuffs. Hell, you can use dog
collars for the cuffs&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I can't go there...to
a sex shop. You know me! And what would someone think of me trying on collars
in a pet store?&quot; she was incredulous.

&nbsp;

&quot;I'll stop by tomorrow
and bring you the cuffs. I have some leashes too,&quot; he told her. &quot;Just
remember what I told you. If you let anyone bind you...well, you are giving
them permission to do whatever they want to do.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Okay.&quot; she
sighed.

&nbsp;

A few minutes later they
agreed that he would come by early Saturday and deliver his� �equipment. Then they said their
goodbyes and hung up.

&nbsp;

For the next several days
Debbie thought she might call James and tell him not to bother. It was
embarrassing. Besides, she was afraid of what her boyfriend might have planned
if he did bind her. Eventually, she settled on James bringing by the equipment.
She didn't have to use it if she didn't want to, after all.

&nbsp;

She was sitting in her
kitchen when the bell rang. Opening the door she greeted James with a slightly
embarrassed smile. A moment later they were sitting across from each other in
friendly conversation.

&nbsp;

&quot;Well, I guess you
probably want to see what's in the bag, eh?&quot; he mused.

&nbsp;

Debbie blushed briefly,
nodding in affirmation. &quot;Let's go upstairs&quot;, she said. Grinning,
James followed her to her bedroom, admiring the sway of her plump bottom
through her tight blue jeans.

&nbsp;

She took a seat on her
unmade bed, asking his forgiveness for the unkempt room. Then, blushing, she
asked what he had brought.

&nbsp;

&quot;This&quot;, he said,
pulling an item from the bag, &quot;is a leather collar. It fits around your
neck. You will notice that it has several steel rings on it. Those are to allow
for constructive binding.&quot; He handed her the collar and then continued.

&nbsp;

&quot;These are cuffs. You
will notice that they are leather, too. Unlike the collar, there is only one
ring on each. You won't need more&quot;, he said. &quot;Here are four leashes,
ten carabineers, a few leather straps with a quick connect fastener at either
end and these are gags. This one is a ring gag and this one is a ball gag. Both
are quite useful.&quot;

&nbsp;

For several moments she sat
quiet. Then, fingering the collar, she asked, &quot;Should I try these on
or...what should I do?&quot;

&nbsp;

James grinned, his thoughts
leading to prurient images. &quot;I can put them on if you like. Do you trust
me?&quot;

&nbsp;

She blushed again.
&quot;Should I?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Well, I did tell you
that if you allow yourself to be bound that you are giving the go-ahead to the
other person.&quot; He was grinning quite widely, enjoying the discomfort
radiating from her cheeks.

&nbsp;

&quot;Look...can I trust you
or not?&quot;

&nbsp;

Again, he grinned. &quot;You
can trust me not to hurt you. I would never hurt you. The rest...well, I might
not be able to stop myself once I have you helpless.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Smart ass&quot;, she
shot at him. &quot;Just show me how they can or should be used.&quot;

&nbsp;

Still grinning, he began
fastening the collar around her neck, buckling it snuggly. Then he fastened the
cuffs to her ankles and wrists.

&nbsp;

&quot;Alright, he is not
experienced. You will need a safe word in case something hurts or he goes too
far for you. Let's use �apple pie� &quot;, he told her.
&quot;Good for you?&quot;

&nbsp;

�&quot;Yeah, apple pie,&quot; she said, burning
with aroused embarrassment. 

&nbsp;

He spun her to face away
from him. &quot;Okay, first thing is simple. Your hands can be bound behind
your back, like so&quot;, he told her, snapping a carabineer between her
wrists. &quot;Can you get loose?&quot;

&nbsp;

Debbie struggled for a
moment, trying to access the carabineer and then to pull her hands from the
cuffs. &quot;No, no I can't.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Excellent. Now, from
this position I can lay you on the bed and hog-tie you or I can pull your hands
up your back, somewhat and, using this strap, bind your wrists to your
collar.&quot;

&nbsp;

Suddenly, he spun her back
to face him. Surveying her he found that she was quite excited. Her cheeks were
reddened and her nipples were quite hard, poking through her cotton t-shirt. 

&nbsp;

Stepping forward, he reached
behind the hair at the back of her head. Pulling her head back, he leaned in to
her and listened to her breathing. It was heavy and a bit ragged. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Feels good, doesn't
it?&quot; he whispered.

&nbsp;

She was shaking now, wishing
he would take her and afraid that he might. 

&nbsp;

&quot;No. It's scary. I
don't like it,&quot; she lied.

&nbsp;

&quot;Don't lie to me,
Debbie&quot;, he told her. &quot;It won't work with me. I know you,
remember?&quot; He released her suddenly, continuing with his lesson.

&nbsp;

&quot;The gags, I must say,
are quite fun,� he stated. &quot;This one is a ring gag. Open your mouth and
I'll show you how it works.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I don't know about
this,&quot; was all she got out before he began pushing the ring into her
mouth. In a matter of moments it was fastened securely, holding her mouth wide
open.

&nbsp;

&quot;This gag, Deb, is so
your mouth can be accessed at any time, whether you want it or not. I don't
think your candy-assed boyfriend would use it properly, do you?&quot; he
whispered, a sinister lilt in his voice. &quot;Now, turn around, facing the bed
and get on your knees.&quot;

&nbsp;

Obediently, she settled to
her knees, crossed emotions and thoughts passing through her. Her nerves were close
to her skin and she began to breathe in short quick breaths. What would she do,
she wondered, if he did decide to take her? What could she do? 

&nbsp;

The click of the carabineer
between her ankles startled her. Looking slightly to her left she could see her
image in the mirrored door of the closet. Her arms were bound mid-way up her
back and her mouth gaped open, an available target for easy use. It felt sexy,
frightening and humiliating all at once.

�

&quot;Debbie&quot;, he said,
sitting on the bed in front of her, &quot;I know that you are excited right
now. You like this feeling. You like everything about this. Most importantly,
you are emotionally torn. Part of you wants me to take you while another part
is fighting that want.&quot;

&nbsp;

She shook her head
&quot;No&quot;.

&nbsp;

&quot;Deb, I am no
fool&quot; he started. &quot;I have been through this before. I know how the
body reacts. I've never lied to you and don't expect you to lie to me. Now,
tell me the truth. Am I right in what I said?&quot;

&nbsp;

She bowed her head and then
nodded &quot;Yes&quot;.

&nbsp;

&quot;In that case, I will
give you something easy.&quot; He was whispering now.� You can find out how it
is to taste my control. It will not be much: a quick moment. Then I will leave.
After that, it is up to you to make the next move. I will not call on
you.&quot;



He stood, unzipping his pants
and pulling his cock out. Debbie stared up at him, unable to decide what she
should do. Then he cradled her head in his hand and pushed her to his cock.

&nbsp;

Initially, he was quite
gentle, sliding his hardening cock into her opened mouth in slow and easy
strokes. Slowly, he built up to faster strokes, pushing his cock to the back of
her throat. She gagged and tried to slow his pace to no avail. 

&nbsp;

�I will do this my way or
not at all, Deb,� he whispered. �Stop resisting. It�s futile.�

&nbsp;

For many minutes he stroked
his cock in her mouth, bobbing her head with the rhythm of his strokes. After
becoming used to his process she found a sort of peace and, closing her eyes,
she found a strange sort of peace.

&nbsp;

His momentum increased with
a sudden hiccup. Her eyes fluttered slightly, knowing he would climax soon.
Abruptly, he pulled from her mouth and held her head back. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Sorry princess, you
aren't getting that satisfaction today,&quot; he told her.

&nbsp;

Her eyes were suddenly wide
and she felt a strange sadness come over her. He was not going to cum in her
mouth. &quot;Why?&quot; she wondered. &quot;What have I done wrong?&quot; It
was as if he read her mind. For, just as quickly as her questions arose, he
answered them.

&nbsp;

&quot;You get my cum when you come to me, not when I come to you. But, I
am going to get the satisfaction I want.&quot;

&nbsp;

A moment later, she was
being lifted and placed in the middle of the bed on her back. Then, as she was
contemplating what might happen next, he released the clasp on her jeans and
pulled them down to her bound ankles. A quick jerk of her panties and he slid
between her legs to lick at her wetness. 

&nbsp;

Later, she would muse, it
was the best worst experience she had ever felt. One moment his tongue was
sliding inside her, wriggling about as if struggling for deeper entry. The next
moment he withdrew from her to lick at her thighs, telling her how good she tasted. His hands, too, played a part in his
scheme. Moments of soft caresses were followed by firm massaging inside and
out, bring her near to orgasm only to leave her wanting. His teasing became
torture and she feared he would never allow her satisfaction.� 

&nbsp;

Unable to take more, she
began begging in garbled phrases, her gag preventing enunciation. Frustrated,
she moaned, filling the room with her tortured cries. Then, just as she thought
she might die, he allowed it. Moans turned to screams, her body thrashing as
much as her bonds would allow. Finally, after several terrible orgasms, he
allowed her peace and she sank into unconscious bliss.

&nbsp;

It was several hours later
when she awoke. She was lying in her bed, unfettered and alone. She called out
for James, hoping he had not left, knowing he had. Finally, her calls
unanswered, she wept.

The Object of His Affection
� Beginnings

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

James was sitting and
reading a book when the phone rang. He was not surprised when he answered the
phone to discover it was Debbie. 

&nbsp;

Immediately after his
initial �Hello�, she burst into a tirade of tears and anger, telling him how
angry she was at what had occurred between them. Slowly then, after she had
aired her grievances, it came out; She had ended her relationship with her
dullard of a boyfriend. Thirty minutes after saying their goodbyes she turned
up at his door. 

&nbsp;

The discussion was long and
tear filled. Finally, after agreeing to �try out a relationship�, they took to
his bed where she curled up in his arms and drifted into the world of dreams.

&nbsp;

They awoke to the dim light
of early morning. Smiling, she slid upwards to kiss him. It was their first
real kiss. They followed it with a passionate session of lovemaking.

&nbsp;

Her past lovers had guided
her with gentle motions and spoken requests. Always, she had been somewhat
aggressive, returning her lovers requests and guidance with her own. It was not
to be so with James, however.

&nbsp;

At first, their kisses were
soft and gentle, tinged with the passion of long lost lovers.� Quickly, the timbre of the evening changed
and she felt herself pushed between his legs.

&nbsp;

�Suck my cock, princess,�
his gentle voice commanded.

&nbsp;

His soft command thrilled
her. Obediently, she unzipped his pants and pulled his cock from within. She
looked up at him and smiled momentarily. Then, she opened her mouth to take his
hardening member into her mouth.

&nbsp;

While she sucked, bobbing
her head on his cock, she began to wonder if he was, in fact, enjoying her
actions. Many conversations were remembered during which he had commented on
how few women can �suck a proper cock�. These remembrances determined her to
prove her skills to him and she began sucking him as if she were pleasing
herself.

&nbsp;

James was impressed by her
vigor, if not her skill. Too often she would pull back to swirl the tip of his
cock with her tongue or wipe the saliva from his cock or her chin. Admittedly,
she was far more skilled and enthusiastic than most in the art of fellatio.
Training her, he thought would be most enjoyable.

&nbsp;

Nearing climax, he pulled
her from his cock and told her to lie on her back. A moment of jockeying found
him straddling her face and demanding she suck him again. Obediently, she
opened her mouth and sucked his dripping cock into her mouth, avoiding his
intently glaring eyes as he began removing his shirt.

&nbsp;

After many long minutes of
avoiding his steady gaze, he pulled from her mouth. Then he slid down the
length of her body and off of the bed.� 

&nbsp;

She realized, as he began
pulling her jeans from her body, that he had already released their snaps and
let down her zipper. 

&nbsp;

&quot;He's good&quot;, she
thought, never having noticed until her jeans, and then her panties, were
coming off. 

&nbsp;

Her jeans removed, he
grasped her ankles and flashed a frightening smile. With a suddenness that
surprised her, he lifted her legs so that they were perpendicular to the bed.
Then, on his knees, he began a slow march up the bed, pressing her legs towards
and then against her torso, licking and kissing them as he progressed.

&nbsp;

For the moment, Debbie was
experiencing a sensuality she had never felt before. She had been fucked in
this position before, but never had she been placed in this position so
carefully or with such slow deliberation. Suddenly, she wished she were naked
and bound, exactly as she was.

&nbsp;

&quot;Grab your legs and
hold them steady,� he whispered. &quot;I don't want you to move.&quot; Then he
slipped off of her to stand at the foot of the bed. 

&nbsp;

She watched him as he
unsnapped his pants and began removing them, his cock hard and standing out
from his body. Again, her thoughts drifted back to wishing she were bound in
her current position, helpless and hopeless of escape.

&nbsp;

Naked, he came around the
bed to kneel and kiss her forehead. She shivered, strangely embarrassed that
her shirt remained on while he was naked. 

&nbsp;

&quot;I should be naked,
too&quot;, she whispered to no one.

&nbsp;

&quot;You will be&quot;, he
told her, making her blush.

&nbsp;

&quot;Before we go further,
there is something that must be done&quot;, he said, smiling. &quot;I have
preferences and kinks and various interests in things that you have described
as perversions. You must indulge me in only one for now. But, you must promise
to indulge me before I tell you what it is.&quot;

&nbsp;

For a brief moment she was
unsure, wondering if she should agree. Admittedly, she had always thrilled at
his descriptions of how he treated the women he had taken to bed. More
importantly, and despite his acknowledged and well-known sadistic side, she had
never detected and cruelty in him. So, after swallowing the lump in her throat,
she nodded her head, telling him she would do as he asked. 

&nbsp;

&quot;When I have finished
speaking, I want you to get up and go to the bathroom&quot;, he began.
&quot;You are not to say a word. Then I want you to shower. Do not hurry; I
want you to enjoy the sensual quality of it. When you come out of the shower, I
expect there to be absolutely no hair below your neck. Your arms, legs...everything
is to be devoid of hair. Now...go.&quot;

&nbsp;

For a brief moment she
pondered his request. She had never shaved her entire body. In fact, the hair
on her body was so fine that she rarely shaved above her knees. Now he wanted
her to shave her entire body. Finally, her moment of thought passed and she
reasoned that she must obey as she had promised.

&nbsp;

For long
and long she stood under the shower, warm water coursing over her body. She was excited and frightened at what was to come
and she suspected that he would not react well to a failure at executing his
wish. So, after many minutes of contemplation, she began her task.

&nbsp;

She shaved her armpits and
legs first. Then, after a short moment of contemplation, she began lathering up
her arms. It felt strange to her as the razor sheared away the fine hairs on
her arm. Even stranger was the sensation of drawing the razor across her belly
and then her chest and bottom.

&nbsp;

Once she was sure no part of
her body remained unshorn, she began to lather up the mound between her legs.
This was substantially more difficult. Not only had she never shaved between
her legs but also she was certain she would cut into her most delicate
flesh.�� 

&nbsp;

The first scrape of the
razor gave her goose bumps. After a deep breath and a quick rinse of the razor
she began again, wincing with each pass of the blade against her flesh. In
seemingly no time she began working on the area that made her most nervous and,
pressing down her excited flesh, she shaved the remaining hair from her mound.
After several short and careful passes, she was, as he commanded, devoid of
hair below her neck. She was also quite aroused and rather embarrassed.

&nbsp;

Her work done, she gave a
final rinsing, shut off the water and began drying herself. Then, stepping from
the shower, she wrapped herself in her towel and exited the bathroom.

&nbsp;

Her arrival into the bedroom
was marked with a chiding remark and a command to return the towel to the
bathroom.

&nbsp;

�I want you naked�, he
commanded.

&nbsp;

For a moment she wavered,
turning part way to her right and then left, blushing from head to toe. Then,
after a quick cock of his head, she obeyed.

&nbsp;

Once she returned to the
room he informed her that she was to stand motionless and that he was going to
examine her. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Anything you missed
will be met with a spanking&quot;, he told her. &quot;You will get five smacks
on the ass for each area you missed.&quot; Then, he knelt in front of her,
grasping her thighs and pressed his mouth between her legs. 

&nbsp;

Suddenly, she was jelly
legged and falling through the air. An instant later she was in his arms and
being placed on the bed. Her head spun as he lifted her legs, his tongue
trailing down her calves and thighs as he pushed them against her. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Hold them to
you&quot;, he commanded, his head disappearing between her legs.

&nbsp;

�It was barely a moment before she began her
first orgasm of the day. Several orgasms and half an hour later, he finally
lifted himself up and plunged into her. He was not gentle, as he had been
before. Neither was he rough. Instead, he was steady and hard, pounding into
her as if she were inanimate, holding her ankles in his firm grasp. Then, as
quickly as he had plunged into her, he withdrew and slid up her body, grasping
the top of her head by its hair. She watched as he grasped his hard cock and
stroked, knowing his intentions. She was instantly horrified yet strangely
anticipatory. He growled, jerking her head closer to his cock as he erupted,
Heart beats later, she found her face covered and dripping with his hot and
sticky discharge.

&nbsp;

For a long moment afterwards,
he did not move. She wanted to speak - to ask him if she could get up and wash
the mess from her face. But she was afraid. This was his domain and she had
entered it willingly, knowing him for who he was. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Open&quot;, he told
her. His voice was deep and commanding.

&nbsp;

Obediently, she opened her
mouth to have him fill it with his cock. He held her to him for several
minutes, his cock nearly to the back of her throat. 

&nbsp;

A dollop of the sticky mass
coating her skin flowed into the corner of her eye. She closed her eyes
tightly, hoping for him to release his grip that she might clean the disgusting
mess from her face. Fearful of disappointing him, she determined to hold a
steady silence until she was certain he was through with her. 

&nbsp;

Finally, he relaxed his grip
on her hair and allowed her head to fall to the bed. He slipped from his
position atop her body, allowing her to legs to fall into a less stressful
position,and lay down beside her.� 

&nbsp;

&quot;I know what you're
thinking,� he began. &quot;But that cum is my claim. It only comes off when I
allow it. Understand?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Crap! You mean that
you want me to wear your cum until you say I can wash it off?&quot; she asked,
incredulous.

&nbsp;

&quot;Exactly.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;But it's covering my
eyes. I can't open my eyes without it getting in&quot;, she complained.
&quot;Can I at least get it out of my eyes?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;No&quot;, was all he
had to say.

&nbsp;

Debbie thought long and
hard. The urge to wipe her eyes was nearly unbearable and the revulsion she
felt at being covered with his drying cum was equally unbearable. By the same
token, she could not deny the odd excitement her situation brought to her. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Fine! I'll leave it!&quot; she said, her tone conciliatory
and irritated. 

&nbsp;

Chuckling, he left the bed,
urging she follow. Her complaints of blindness were met with more chuckles. 

&nbsp;

&quot;I guess I'll have to
lead you, then&quot;, he told her, taking her by the hand to lead her
downstairs.

&nbsp;

After seating her in a chair
at his table he inquired &quot;Bacon and eggs good?&quot; 

&nbsp;

&quot;It's better than cum
in your face&quot;, she replied, wryly.

&nbsp;

She sat with her eyes closed,
uncomfortably trying to ignore the drying mess on her face as he prepared their
food. Fortunately, by the time breakfast was ready for their consumption her
facial covering was sufficiently dry enough for her to
open her eyes again.

&nbsp;

&quot;You're a bastard, you
know?&quot; she said, biting into a piece of bacon.

&nbsp;

&quot;I know&quot;, he said,
flashing a grin. &quot;But, that's the sort of thing you can look forward to if
you stay with me. Well, that and worse.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I don't want to know.
Not while I'm eating,&quot; she said. She pursed her lips and went on with her
meal.

&nbsp;

The rest of the day went
pleasantly. They made love several more times, each time ending, much to her
annoyance, with the same results as the first time. By the time he let her take
a shower that night, her face had a thorough and
unpleasant coating of dried semen.

&nbsp;

As they lay in bed that
night, after much prodding, she would begrudgingly admit that the degradation
she suffered that day had aroused her. His suspicions confirmed, he began making plans for future humiliation of the girl
beside him.

The
Object of His Affection - Humiliation

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

During the next few months,
caught in the early throes and excitement of a new relationship, things were
relatively easy going. During this time he showed her the lighter sides of his
sadomasochistic tastes, promising her it would not always be so easy. 

&nbsp;

Many nights he would spend
teaching her how to give better blowjobs. Other nights they would simply make
love or fuck hard. It was also when she discovered the excitement and
humiliation of having to receive permission before climaxing. 

&nbsp;

Debbie, for the most part,
enjoyed her new situation. She had always wished for more assertive boyfriends
and had always wondered why men tended to be so sheepish in the bedroom. Upon
voicing this query to James she received an answer that was honest, from his
standpoint, and for which she could find little fault.� 

&nbsp;

&quot;It's because of how
men have been trained in this day and age. Men have been told that taking
charge is bad and that women can do anything a man can, despite the obvious
physical, emotional and psychological differences�, he told her.

&nbsp;

It was a Friday, nearly six
months into their relationship, when she inquired as to why he had not bound
her. She had hoped, nearly every night, that he would tie her to the bed and take her. He explained that it was not the time. &quot;Soon,
you will begin to experience those &quot;other things&quot; you wish to
experience.&quot;

&nbsp;

That night, he asked if she
wanted a new experience. Excited at the prospect, she nearly jumped when she
told him she would. For the next few hours she waited, expectant and excited,
for him to unveil his plans.

&nbsp;

At nine O�clock that night, he told her to take a shower.
&quot;After you dry your hair, I want you to come downstairs. You are to be
naked. Understand?&quot; 

&nbsp;

After an excited &quot;Yes,
Sir!&quot; she bolted upstairs to complete her orders. Twenty minutes later she
was downstairs and standing, naked, just as he commanded.

&nbsp;

Seated on his soft leather
couch, James commanded she stand in the middle of the room with her hands at
her side and solidly against her thighs. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Now tell me, how many
times have you masturbated since we have been
together?&quot; he asked.

&nbsp;

&quot;I
haven't...I don't,� she stammered.

&nbsp;

Rolling
his eyes, he began again. &quot;How many times?&quot;

&nbsp;

Blushing, she stammered,
&quot;A few times...I don't know how many times...a lot, I guess.&quot;� 

&nbsp;

&quot;That ends now. From
now on, you are never to masturbate or cum, ever again, without my permission.
Understand?&quot;

&nbsp;

She blushed again, trying to
hide her face under the cover of her long auburn hair. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;,
she whispered.

&nbsp;

&quot;Good. Now, it's time
for me to see how you masturbate&quot; he told her. &quot;Do you do it standing
or sitting or laying down? How?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Oh my God. I can't...I...I don't want to do this&quot;, she said in a shaky voice.

&nbsp;

&quot;How? What position?&quot; he demanded.

&nbsp;

&quot;Sitting. I sit on the couch or lay on my bed, she said,
wishing she could crawl under a rock.�
&quot;My legs are usually spread and my legs are bent. My...my knees are
usually up in the air.&quot;

&nbsp;

James left the couch and sat
in the easy chair across from it.� Then,
his voice low, he told her �Go�show me.�

&nbsp;

Obeying him, she sat on the
couch. She didn�t more for a long moment,� praying she would wake from this
dream. After a quick �Now!� she took a deep breath and lifted her legs,
spreading them slightly. 

&nbsp;

&quot;This
is how you sit?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes&quot;, she
whispered. She was sweating now, nearly overwhelmed by the moments
embarrassment. &quot;Please, can we not do this?� she pleaded.

&nbsp;

&quot;Now, slide your hand
between your legs and show me how you masturbate&quot;, he commanded.

&nbsp;

Closing her eyes, she slid
her right hand between her legs. More embarrassment flooded through her being
as she discovered that she was extremely wet. Then, almost against her own
command, her fingers began rubbing the sensitive flesh between her legs.

&nbsp;

&quot;I
own that pussy�, he said. &quot;Never forget that. I own it.?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes&quot;,
she hissed.

&nbsp;

&quot;Say
it.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;You
own my pussy.�

&nbsp;

&quot;Again.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;You
own my pussy�, she repeated. 

&nbsp;

Before long, his repetitious
command was no longer necessary and she began repeating the words as if a mantra.
It was not long after that she became lost in her sexual excitement and found
herself in need of release.

&nbsp;

�&quot;May I cum?&quot; she asked, ever dutiful
to ask, as he required of her.

&nbsp;

&quot;Who
do you cum for?&quot; he demanded.

&nbsp;

&quot;I
cum for you&quot;, she replied.

&nbsp;

&quot;Tell
me again. Who do you cum for?� he repeated.

&nbsp;

�I cum for you.�

&nbsp;

�When
do you cum?� His voice was hard and demanding now.

&nbsp;

�When you
command it.� There was
desperation building in her voice. &quot;I cum for you.
I cum when you command it. Please, may I cum? I need to cum so bad. Please, let
me cum?&quot;

&nbsp;

�How
badly do you want to cum?� he asked.

&nbsp;

�So badly�so, so badly. Please let me cum!� Her voice was quivering with
need.

&nbsp;

�So,
why don�t you cum?� he inquired.

&nbsp;

�Because
I�m not allowed...not without your permission,� she answered.

&nbsp;

He smiled, pleased by her
surprising willingness to suffer for him. He had, it seemed, under estimated
her submissive nature and need to please. This miscalculation did not displease
him in the least.

&nbsp;

&quot;Please...please,
let me cum for you!&quot; she was nearly frantic now.

&nbsp;

&quot;Stop
rubbing&quot;, he said.

&nbsp;

Frustrated, she let out a
groan and hesitantly stopped rubbing, withdrawing her hand from her needy
organ.

&nbsp;

&quot;You
want to rub your pussy again?&quot;

&nbsp;

She
hardly noticed the smug tone in his voice, knowing only the need for release. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes&quot;,
she pleaded. &quot;Please let me rub my pussy.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;What
will you do for it?� he inquired, knowing her answer.

&nbsp;

&quot;Please...anything you
want...I'll do anything. Just please let me rub my pussy. Let me cum.&quot; She
sounded near to panic, so great was her frustrated need.

&nbsp;

&quot;You
may rub.&quot;

&nbsp;

Her hand was back between
her legs, massaging the dripping orifice. Immediately, she began undulating and
moaning. Then, as before, she began begging for release.

&nbsp;

Not satisfied with her
suffering, he made her desist her self-pleasure yet again. She groaned, pulling
her hand from her sex, her hand hovering hesitantly over her need. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Please, I need to
cum&quot;, she begged. &quot;Please let me rub my pussy. Anything, I'll do
anything.&quot;

&nbsp;

Over and over he made her
rub her sensitive flesh, making her pull her hand from her sensitive mound when
she approached orgasm. Many times she would scream out her frustration as tears
flowed down her face. But then, just as she neared her breaking point, she
heard those magical words: &quot;Cum for me, slut&quot;.

&nbsp;

It burst upon her as if a
thousand stars had exploded. Her sight left her visions of strange design, a
kaleidoscope of ever changing chaos of color and light. Her knees were pulled
against her body as her toes and feet twisted frantically about. Finally,
exhausted and more than satisfied, her rubbing slowed and then came to a halt. 

&nbsp;

�I
didn�t tell you to stop rubbing, slut!� she heard.

&nbsp;

Mindlessly, she began
rubbing again. A quick command to �Cum, whore�,
brought another orgasm. His command was repeated time and time again, until she
begged him to let her rest. 

&nbsp;

��Please, let me rest�I can�t�I can�t�no more�,
she begged.� 

&nbsp;

�You
wanted to cum, slut�, he hissed. �Now, you have your wish. Cum
for me.�

&nbsp;

�Please�no more!� she cried out,
another orgasm hitting her. �I can�t take it. Please!�

&nbsp;

After a time, she could hear
little, other than his repeated commands to cum and cum again.� Never did it enter her thoughts to disobey,
even as she begged for mercy.

&nbsp;

��Stop, slut�, he finally commanded.

&nbsp;

She
obeyed. 

&nbsp;

There was no thought at this
point - no identity or emotion. There was only a sense of being and the need to
obey his words. She did not know why, nor did she question it. At this moment,
she was just an entity occupying space, obeying the only thing she knew; his
voice.

&nbsp;

�I own you�, he said. I was
not a question or a demand. It was a statement of fact. �Say it.�

&nbsp;

�You
own me,� she forced out between breaths.

&nbsp;

�Cum
for me, cunt,� she heard.

&nbsp;

Immediately she erupted in
another orgasm, both arms slamming back against the couch cushions. Again and
again he commanded she cum for him. Each time she
obeyed with a blistering orgasm that seemed to come from nowhere and
everywhere.

&nbsp;

&quot;Stop!&quot;
he commanded. And it was over. 

&nbsp;

&quot;I
own you,� he said again.

&nbsp;

Then, as if nothing had
occurred, he commanded she go to the bedroom and to await his arrival. He would
shower and shave, he told her. &quot;When I get settled into bed, I don't
expect to have to tell you to suck my cock.&quot; 

&nbsp;

Had she had her wits she might
have been shocked. As it was she was barely able to acknowledge his words
before shakily departing for his bedroom.�
She was still nearly devoid of thought when, twenty minutes later, he
slipped into bed. Once he was settled, she slid between his legs to suck his
cock.

&nbsp;

&quot;Which do you prefer,
dear...would you prefer I cum on your face or in your mouth?&quot;

&nbsp;

Momentarily freeing her
mouth from his cock, she said &quot;My face. Please cum on my face so I can
wear it all night.�

&nbsp;

It was not her preference.
They both knew it. But it was his preference. He was quite pleased with her at
that moment and he told her so. She smiled, glad that she had pleased him.

&nbsp;

&quot;Suck.&quot; It was a
soft command; softer than usual. Somehow, it seemed to carry a tremendous
weight that excited her. Obedient and eager to please him, she engulfed his
cock with her mouth, sucking him to the best of her ability.

&nbsp;

Many times he would halt her
action to ask where she preferred to receive his cum. Each time he was met with
&quot;On my face&quot;.

&nbsp;

Finally,
he asked her &quot;Do you think you are worthy to wear my cum?&quot;

&nbsp;

Lifting her head from his
cock and furrowing her brow, she considered his question. Unable to find the
proper answer: one that would please him. She gave a tentative &quot;I don't
know&quot; before dipping her head to return to her chore. 

&nbsp;

&quot;You are not. Not yet.
When you are worthy, I will cum on your face,� he told her. &quot;For tonight,
and until you are worthy, you will swallow. You will eventually wear my cum again. But only when I feel you are worthy to do so.�


&nbsp;

Later that night, long after
he had filled her mouth with his hot and viscous fluids, she cried. What had she done wrong, she wondered. Why was she not worthy to
have him cum on her face? She cried herself to sleep, wondering where she had
failed him.

&nbsp;

Slowly, as the months
progressed, he re-enforced his edict that she was not worthy to wear his cum.
Even when she began begging for him to allow her to wear his cum, he would tell
her she was not worthy. 

&nbsp;

�You may never be worthy to
wear my cum, Deb�, he would tell her from time to
time. �Your blowjobs have much to be desired and your obedience is lacking.
When these things improve you might be worthy of wearing my
cum. Until that time, I cannot see giving you that pleasure.�

&nbsp;

Eventually, she began to see
that he was right. She was not worthy of wearing his cum. She did talk back and
she had nicked his cock with her teeth on more than one occasion. This did not
discourage her, however. Instead, it steeled her to become more of what he
wanted, hoping to be granted the honor of wearing his seed once again.

&nbsp;

Her determination was
obvious, pleasing him considerably. Often, he would consider her progression,
knowing she would eventually allow her submissive nature to take over more
completely. That was the day he reckoned would be the most joyous day of her
life.

The Object of His affection
� Pavlov�s Dog 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

It was the eve of their
anniversary. She had gotten &quot;all gussied up&quot; at his command and now
awaited his arrival at her door. When, at last, he arrived, he was in suit and
tie, bearing flowers and a large gift-wrapped box.

&nbsp;

&quot;Happy anniversary,
pet&quot;, he said, smiling. &quot;I have something special for you. I only
hope you accept it.&quot;

&nbsp;

She could not imagine what
he might have that she would not accept. A quizzical look on her face, she
leaned in to kiss him and retrieve her bouquet. Then, after placing the large
bouquet in a vase on her coffee table, she sat on the couch beside him,
reaching for the gift-wrapped box. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Before you open your
present, I want you to understand the significance of it�, he started. &quot;If
you accept the contents within, you will be expected to quit your apartment and
move in with me. I want to have you day and night, for now and always.&quot;

&nbsp;

Debbie burst into tears,
falling into his arms in a strong embrace, covering his face with wet tears and
emotion filled kisses.

&nbsp;

&quot;Of course, I'll move
in&quot;, she nearly shouted. 

&nbsp;

After wiping her face she
turned to the box and began unwrapping it. What she
found were four black leather cuffs and a wide leather collar of the same
color. There was also a pair of black stiletto heels with a locking ankle
strap.

&nbsp;

&quot;If you accept these
gifts there is significance behind them&quot;, he said, looking into her eyes.
&quot;It means that our relationship will intensify and that you can look
forward to experiencing many of the things I have told you about over the
years.&quot;

&nbsp;

For a moment she didn't know
quite what to say. She had longed for him to use his cuffs and collar. She had
longed to be bound and used for his pleasure. However, even after being with
him for the last year, she feared much of how she knew he would use her.

&nbsp;

&quot;Can I think about
it...give you my answer later tonight?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Let's go&quot;, he
said. &quot; When we get back you I�ll expect that
answer.&quot;

&nbsp;

Debbie was quite relieved.
This was not something she could rush into and, though she loved him and had
enjoyed her submission to him, she was still fearful of it.

&nbsp;

Dinner was a pleasant
affair. They talked and laughed, remembering old times and not so old times.
Often, he would mention a particularly memorable evening of recent past, bringing
a blush to her skin. 

&nbsp;

�You recoil from certain of
my comments,� he stated, stirring his drink. �But I know you like not being
allowed to cum until I command it. I know you like when I embarrass you.�

&nbsp;

�I do,� she acknowledge,
still blushing. �I like everything, even what I don�t like. You�you make me
want it. I don�t know how and it scares me. But I like it.�

&nbsp;

By the time they returned to
her apartment she was happy and excited, having already reached a decision
regarding her gifts. As soon as they crossed the threshold and entered her
living room she kissed him, embracing him tightly.

&nbsp;

&quot;Will you do something
at my request, just this once?&quot; she asked, smiling demurely.

&nbsp;

&quot;What is it?&quot; 

&nbsp;

&quot;Will you go to the
bedroom, get undressed and wait for me?&quot; she asked.

&nbsp;

He starred at her for a
brief moment longer, considering her request. &quot;Sure. I'll be waiting in
bed. Don't make me wait long.&quot;

&nbsp;

Once he had slipped away,
she removed her clothing and applied his gifts to her body. First, she slipped
on his collar, enjoying the sudden claustrophobic tightness as she buckled it
on. Then, after fastening the cuffs about her wrists she slipped her feet into
the menacing looking shoes and buckled them on as well. 

&nbsp;

She discovered, as she
looked through the box, that there was a small envelope. Curious, she opened it
to discover that there were several small locks and a pair of keys. She tested
them, discovering that, all the locks were identical and that one key was all
that was necessary. In a moment, each of her adornments was locked on to her
body, ensuring that only the bearer of the keys could release her from her
trappings. Then, she headed to her bedroom and to the man who awaited her. 

&nbsp;

His weight pressed heavily
on her doubled body. She had been bound with her arms stretched and spread over
her head. Her ankles, much as she had imagined, had been bound to their
corresponding wrist. He was pounding into her, whispering words of lust into
her ears and heightening thrill of the moment.

&nbsp;

He was generous that night,
not torturing her by making her wait. When she asked permission to cum it was
granted each time. Then, as was his practice, when he neared climax, he asked
�Where would you like me to cum?�

&nbsp;

Suddenly melancholy and
knowing she was not yet worthy, she replied �On my face�.

&nbsp;

Then, as if in a dream, he
pulled out of her and straddled her bound body. She watched in disbelief as he
stroked his cock, spewing his semen across her face. Her melancholy was
replaced, in that instance, with pride and happiness.

&nbsp;

Three more times he made
love to her bound body. Three more times she was found worthy to wear his
cum.� Finally, spent, he lay down beside
her and slipped into the darkness of sleep.

&nbsp;

As he drifted into dreams,
she lay beside him, proud to be wearing his cum. Her apparent worthiness filled
her with happiness and pride. It was then that she realized that her worthiness
was determined, not by the quality of her blowjobs or her obedience but by her
willingness to give herself over. It was that release and it�s
accompanying trust that had made her worthy to wear his seed. Happy, and with a
smile on her damp and sticky face, she joined James in sleep.

&nbsp;

Morning came to soon. With it, she discovered the pain that comes with
being bound doubled over for so long. Looking over to James she could see that
he was still sleeping. She thought, for a fleeting moment, that she might wake
him and ask to be let loose of her bonds. Then she thought of how he had made
her feel the previous night and decided to endure the discomfort she was
feeling. Besides, she did not want to disappoint him in any way.

&nbsp;

Eventually, the call of
nature woke James. After a quick trip to the bathroom he returned and released
her fatigued and sore body from her bonds.

&nbsp;

�Suck my cock,� he
commanded, lying back on the bed. 

&nbsp;

Her initial reaction was one
of irritation. She was quick to catch herself before her irritation was made
public. After a quick stretch, she slid down between his legs and took his cock
in her mouth. Fortunately for her cramping muscles, he was not long in reaching
climax. After delivering a fresh coating of semen to her face, he commanded she
ready breakfast while he showered.

&nbsp;

Breakfast was nearly
complete when he sauntered into the kitchen. She turned and smiled, dried cum
flaking along the corners of her mouth and the dimples in her cheeks. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Cum for me&quot;, he
commanded.

&nbsp;

A brief moment passed as his
words sank into her head. Suddenly the wave hit her and she was forced to grip
the counter top to keep from falling to the ground. Moments later, she regained
her strength and stared at him wide eyed.

&nbsp;

&quot;Bacon�s burning.&quot;
He was casual, as if her cumming with only his
command were an every day occurrence. 

&nbsp;

Perplexed and slightly
unbelieving in what had just happened, she returned to her cooking. She was in
a daze during the rest of her cooking duty. She was still thinking of the
strange occurrence when she finally placed their food on the table and took her
seat opposite him. 

&nbsp;

&quot;How did you do
that?&quot; she inquired. &quot;How the fuck did you do that?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Pavlov's dogs,� he
said, grinning. &quot;I trained you. Now, you cum on
command.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;No fucking way! That's
not possible�, she exclaimed. I'm not like some dog that you can train to do
tricks.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes you are. I own
you. Now, cum for me.&quot; 

&nbsp;

This time, there was no
hesitation. Instead, the wave hit hard and quick. She stared at him from under
troubled brows, excited, dismayed and frightened at this new development. When
her orgasm finally subsided she opened her mouth, as if to speak. Nothing was
emitted, however, and she stared, a dumb animal, unable to form words.

&nbsp;

He smiled at her, noting the
odd mix of emotions that were apparent on her semen coated face.

&nbsp;

&quot;Eat up&quot;, he said.


&nbsp;

Finally, after several long
moments of silence, her thoughts returned to her. Several times she made to
speak. Her thoughts, returned though they were, were a jumble and she was
unable to form a coherent structure to them. She felt that she should say
something: perhaps an edict of irritation or pleasure. Little came to her,
however. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Oh
my God. You...I...this can't be
real!&quot; she finally gasped. �You�I�.can�t�what the hell?�

&nbsp;

He merely chuckled, noting
to her how pleased he was that she could be trained so well. He was quick to
note, much to her chagrin, how �wonderful� she looked when cumming
for him at his command. She was not so thrilled as he.


&nbsp;

It was nearly a week before
she fully accepted and began to enjoy his control over her orgasms. She had
worried, initially, that anyone could make her cum. He assured her that it was
not likely. Few people, he offered, would likely make such a command. 

&nbsp;

�Besides�, he offered, �It�s
not just the command: it�s who commands.�

&nbsp;

A month later she quit her
apartment and moved in with him. On this day she was informed that she would be
expected to change her house wear. Her collar, cuffs and stiletto heels were to
be her standard mode of dress, unless otherwise ordered. When they were out, he
allowed, she could wear whatever she wanted adding, �unless
I have other ideas for your evening wear.� To her surprise, she found this
edict quite arousing.

&nbsp;

Weeks turned to months and
then, before she knew it, another year was gone and they were fast approaching
their second anniversary together. This anniversary, rather than present her
with a gift, he requested one from her.

&nbsp;

&quot;It's a request and not
a command,� he told her. &quot;It requires your free consent and will not be
considered disobedient should you choose against it.�

&nbsp;

His request stunned her and
she was glad he gave her time to mull it over. Even more relieving was that it
was not a demand. With a bra size of thirty-four &quot;DD&quot; she was already
a large breasted woman. Especially considering her breasts were housed on a
five foot three inch frame. Having them enlarged, to whatever size he had planned,
would make her look ridiculous.

&nbsp;

Finally, on the day of their
anniversary, she came to him and told him she could not grant his request and
asked if she could give him anything else. With a smile, she was instructed not
to worry on the matter. 

&nbsp;

His calm and happy
willingness to forget his request only served to disappoint her. For, despite
his reaction, she felt as if she had failed him.

The Object of His Affection
� Discovery 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

She lay on her belly, each
ankle bound to it's corresponding wrist. If she could
have she would have been screaming. Instead, she could only attempt to scream,
a large ball gag halting her voice from completely expressing her pain. James
lay on top of her, thrusting his cock into her ass. As she had always feared,
it was a terrible pain and it could not end soon enough. 

&nbsp;

When he had begun his
binding he promised she would experience pain. He was quick to admit that he
could make this a more pleasurable experience. In the future, it would likely
bring her great pleasure and minimal, if any, pain. However, there was only one
first time and his sadistic side was in need.

&nbsp;

His entry was excruciatingly
painful and felt as if he were ripping her in twain. As he had prepared her, he
dripped a small amount of saliva between the crack of
her posterior. Then, after rubbing his cock over the saliva and his intended
target, he forced his way in. One slow and steady thrust and he was buried deep
in her ass.

&nbsp;

She screamed as best she
could, hoping he would stop or withdraw or just give
her a moment to recover. Her wish was not met. As soon as he had buried himself
inside her ass, he began his long and painful strokes;
each stroke nearly pulling from her tortured ass, only to be buried, once
again, deep inside of her. 

&nbsp;

At first entry, James
reveled in her obvious pain and futile struggles. When his further thrusting
was met with even more pain and struggles he was near to ecstatic.
Consequently, the more she screamed and struggled, the harder and faster he
thrust. It was a vicious cycle.

&nbsp;

It was over too soon for
James. After mere minutes he could contain himself no more. With a sudden
jerking and arching of his back, he climaxed, sending a hot wave of fluid into
her colon.

&nbsp;

For a long while afterwards
he lay on top of her, allowing his cock to grow soft inside her battered hole.
With his softening he could feel the involuntary twitch of her sphincter.
Pleasurable as that was, it hardly compared with her
voluntary squeezing and pushing her felt. Few things were, to James, more
intense or exciting than feeling a tightening asshole around his cock.

&nbsp;

Lifting his head, he decided
it might be time to pull the gag from her mouth. She might, he thought, be
unable to breathe after so much crying. On the other hand, he was likely to get
an ear full of angry complaints. Judgment and care prevailed.

&nbsp;

Upon removal of the gag
there was little from her other than soft crying. To his surprise, after she
had regained herself, she did not offer up any words of anger or harsh
comments. Instead, her words were a quiet description of the pain she had
suffered. Then she returned to her quiet sobbing.

&nbsp;

For many minutes James
pondered her reaction to his brutal act of buggery. She had not expressed anger
or told him she would never allow it again, as he expected. Instead, she seemed
to have accepted it. More importantly, it seemed that she had accepted the
possibility that she might suffer similarly in future. Her nature, he noted,
was gaining more ground, while the headstrong woman was losing ground.

&nbsp;

The next morning found them
in the shower together. As many couples in love are wont to do, they were
enjoying the sensuous pleasures of washing their lover. As is often the case,
the two followed the occasion by drying each other off under the cover of the
hot misty room.

&nbsp;

Over breakfast they spoke of
the previous nights activities. He admitted to her the intense pleasure it had
provided him. Her struggles and tears, he told her, had caused him to find
climax with considerable quickness. He also admitted to looking forward to
enjoying such pleasures again.

&nbsp;

Debbie was less
enthusiastic. She admitted to wanting to experience anal sex but she had never
wanted such pain. She concluded her comments on the matter with an expression
of hope, that the next time wouldn�t be so painful.

&nbsp;

�You�re enjoying the
conversation, aren�t you?� asked James.

&nbsp;

�No,� she said, avoiding eye
contact. �It was painful and humiliating. Why would I enjoy talking about
something that was so unpleasant?�

&nbsp;

He pushed and prodded with
invasive and embarrassing questions. Finally, in a burst of frustration, she
admitted the conversation was arousing. 

&nbsp;

�Look,� she concluded, �I
don�t know why it�s arousing and I don�t like that it is! And that arouses me
too! Okay?� 

&nbsp;

&quot;It's the
humiliation&quot;, he told her. &quot;You enjoy the humiliation.&quot;

&nbsp;

She looked at him with
furrowed brows. &quot;You're nuts. Who, in their right mind, would get off on
being humiliated?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;You get off on it.� He
was almost too matter of fact for her tastes; almost smug.

&nbsp;

&quot;No&quot;, she replied,
looking into her coffee cup. &quot;I don't like to be humiliated. I like that
it pleased you, that's all.&quot;

&nbsp;

After breakfast, he brought
her to the living room and made her kneel in front of him. 

&nbsp;

&quot;In a few minutes, I am
going to fuck your ass again. This time&quot;, he said, &quot;You are not going
to be tied up. This time you are going to be on your knees. This time I am
going to cum in your mouth. Go take care of the dishes and return to the front
room.&quot;

&nbsp;

She swallowed hard, hoping
to find a way to escape his proclaimed plans. She was not ready to be taken
that way again. Beyond the pain, she was also disgusted at the thought of his
cock going from her ass to her mouth. Before she could make to speak, he was
gone, retiring to their living room.

&nbsp;

The dishes were done in a
haze. Throughout her chore she sought the words, which would get her out of
this terrible predicament. Unfortunately, she was unable to find those words
and, upon her arrival to the living room, she found herself quite unable to
resist his wants.

&nbsp;

&quot;Are you my
whore?&quot; he asked.

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes, I'm your whore.�
Her voice was thin and shaky.

&nbsp;

She hated the term
&quot;whore&quot;. She hated all such derogatory terms for women. More than
speaking those words, she hated calling herself a whore. Worse yet, she hated
the excitement she felt at telling him she was a whore � his whore.

&nbsp;

&quot;Get on your hands and
knees and get ready to take my cock up your ass&quot;, he ordered. 

&nbsp;

Slow to obey, she received a
stern look that made her feel insignificant and small. It was all it took to
set her into motion.

&nbsp;

&quot;Get that ass up and
your head down&quot;, he commanded. &quot;I want to see that big ass of yours
and nothing else, cunt!&quot; 

&nbsp;

She bit her lip and slumped
into position. Her internal battle became greater and she began to question why
she let him treat her so.

&nbsp;

�&quot;Tell me what you feel like right
now.&quot;

&nbsp;

She took a deep breath,
assessing his question. &quot;I feel horrible. I feel like a piece of meat...I
hate it. And those words you used for me...I hate those words. They're
demeaning.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Why did you obey
then?&quot; he asked.

&nbsp;

&quot;I don�t know! Because
I have to�it�s how you want me�, she began, �I want to be what you want. I need
to�to be what you want me to be.�

&nbsp;

James knelt behind her and
reached out to her sex. She was wet. Fingers probed at her wet entrance,
finding their way inside of her to stroke her. 

&nbsp;

&quot;You're plenty wet,
aren't you?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes...yes, I'm
wet.�� She was sobbing now.

&nbsp;

&quot;Would you still say
that you dislike humiliation?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I can't like it&quot;,
she cried. &quot;If I did...if...there would be something wrong with me. What
kind of person would I be?&quot;

&nbsp;

He continued stroking her;
pointing out how wet she while using vile words to
describe her and her reaction to his comments. Before long, she was panting,
begging for release. He would not allow it.

&nbsp;

&quot;Not yet, my cum slut. Not until you admit how much you like this
humiliation�, he whispered to her.

&nbsp;

She cried out, frustrated
and angry. She knew that she should storm out and tell him what she thought of
his words but she could not bring herself to do so. Instead, she begged for
release.

&nbsp;

&quot;Not until you admit
it, cunt!&quot; he said, his voice sounding contemptuous.

&nbsp;

She hated him, suddenly. He
already knew how she reacted to his humiliating words and treatment. He already
knew how it aroused her. Wasn�t it enough that he knew? Why should she have to
tell him? All these thoughts filled her mind. Suddenly, she heard her thoughts.
It was at that exact moment when he withdrew his hand from her twitching sex,
drawing a terrible groan of protest.

&nbsp;

&quot;Please, please, don't
stop. I need it. Please, I'll do anything&quot;, she begged. &quot;
I like being called names and being treated like a whore. Please...let
me come! Please! I like being humiliated. &quot; 

&nbsp;

He did not appease her.
Instead, he clipped her chin with his finger, lifting her to face him. �Good
girl,� he told her, before leaving her with her thoughts.

&nbsp;

Humiliated, confused and
ashamed, Debbie curled into a ball on the floor and cried as she had never
cried before. Such torture was repeated with more and more frequency in the
coming months. Each night she would fight it, eventually giving in. Each night,
she would be left to cry, alone with her painful knowledge. 

&nbsp;

Eventually, she gave up
fighting what she knew was true without a fight. Immediately after, she broke
down in tears. Unlike before, however, James was quick to take her in his arms
and whisk her into their bed, to comfort her and wipe away her tears.

&nbsp;

�One does not choose ones sexual
orientation or skin color anymore than one chooses what excites them sexually,�
he explained. 

&nbsp;

She accepted his comments -
mostly. Somewhere deep down, however, she wondered if he was wrong and if she
hadn't committed some crime that she was subconsciously punishing herself for.

&nbsp;

The Object of His Affection
� Modification 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

They were laying on the
couch on a lazy Saturday afternoon. The sun shone through the trees outside,
casting shadows that moved with the light breeze. As usual, she was naked but
for her cuffs, collar and stilettos. Half asleep, she wrested on his lap, her
arms wrapped around him, secure and comfortable.

&nbsp;

She looked up at him and
smiled. &quot;What do you want for your birthday?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;You know what I
want&quot;, he told her.

&nbsp;

She furrowed her brows
quizzically, nodding her head to the negative.

&nbsp;

&quot;Right now, I would
enjoy seeing your wonderful breasts enhanced a bit&quot;, he told her.
&quot;Remember when I mentioned it before?&quot;

&nbsp;

She clamped her lips
tightly, considering his comment. For a long time she stared at him, not making
a sound. She had all but forgotten his request, having received no further
comments on the matter since declining his initial
request.

&nbsp;

&quot;How big do you want
them?&quot; she inquired.

&nbsp;

&quot;Doesn't
matter. That is, it shouldn't
matter to you.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Of course, it matters.
I have to work and live with them&quot;, she said. &quot;And I would have to
deal with the people at work. What would they think if I got my breasts -
already a thirty-six &quot;DD&quot;, I might add - enlarged? What kind of a
narcissist would they think I am?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Quit.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;My
job?&quot;

&nbsp;

He tilted his head to look
at her. &quot;Yeah. I have plenty of money. Or haven't
you noticed?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;How big?&quot; she
asked, her voice trailing into a higher octave.

&nbsp;

&quot;I don't know&quot;, he
said. &quot;I'll know when I talk to the doctor.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;But I can quit work
and not have to worry about being ogled and ridiculed by anyone?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Yup.&quot;

&nbsp;

In the past, she had
considered having her breasts reduced somewhat, if anything. The notion of
enlarging them further had never entered her mind until he had mentioned it. 

&nbsp;

She looked up at him,
thinking about his request; wondering what he had in mind. She loved him so
much and longed to please him, always feeling as if she had committed a
terrible crime if she failed him in any way. What was she to
do, she wondered.

&nbsp;

�You really want me bigger?�
She was hopeful of a change.

&nbsp;

�Yes,� he said. �I want you
bigger.�

&nbsp;

She thought of the
possibilities. Maybe he only wanted her a little bigger, she thought � hoped.
Then again, he might want her breasts to be as big as basketballs or bigger.
How could she deal with something like that?

&nbsp;

�I can�t,� she thought. �How
can I? I�m already too big.�

&nbsp;

She was suddenly sad,
imagining the look in his eyes when she told him �No�. How could she disappoint
him again? Especially after showing her who she really was? Especially
after teaching her not to fight herself. 

&nbsp;

�I can�t disappoint him
again,� she reasoned. �I can�t. I can�t�but I have to.�

&nbsp;

She made to answer and then
stopped, open-mouthed. She started again and then faltered. She gulped air,
preparing for his disappointment. Then, she blurted out the words that
surprised even her; �I�ll do it.�

&nbsp;

The rest of the week was a
blur for her. Often times she would stare at her bare breasts in the bathroom
mirror, imagining how they would look after her impending surgery. One day,
while she contemplated her future bra size, she heard his voice calling to her.
It was time.

&nbsp;

The drive to the
&quot;Facility&quot; was a long one. During the journey he explained that the
doctor he was taking her to see was a friend of his.

&nbsp;

&quot;His name is Jerry and
he specializes is this sort of thing&quot;, he told her. &quot;Actually, he
does far more extreme things for people than breast enlargements. Anyway, he is
good. The best, in fact.&quot;

&nbsp;

Upon arrival to the
&quot;Facility&quot; she got an odd feel about it. It was clean and sterile,
just like any other doctors office. However, the air about the place seemed
rather cold and lifeless, as if something horrible lurked about.

&nbsp;

They were ushered into
Jerry's office almost immediately. James and Jerry shook hands and engaged in a
brief moment of small talk and catching up. Then they got down to the business
at hand.

&nbsp;

&quot;So, you say you want
to increase your bust size?&quot; 

&nbsp;

&quot;Well, yes. That is�er�James wants me to get it done and I want to do it for
him&quot;, Debbie replied.

&nbsp;

&quot;Have you decided on a
size?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes, I have,� James
interjected. �So, if you can get her prepped, I can tell you what I want.&quot;

&nbsp;

Jerry looked to Debbie
smiling. &quot;I see. Well then, give me about an hour and we will get her
prepped.&quot; He then excused himself and departed.

&nbsp;

�You decided?� Debbie
whispered to James.

&nbsp;

He smiled, nodding his head.


&nbsp;

�How big?� she demanded.

&nbsp;

�Does it matter?�

&nbsp;

�Yes. No. I don�t know.�
Debbie was flustered now. �No. I don�t think it does. But it does�and it
doesn�t. 

&nbsp;

James smiled and pulled her
to him, assuring her.

&nbsp;

What about if I scare?� she
asked, hoping to find a way out.

&nbsp;

�Don�t worry,� interjected
Jerry, �I go in through the naval. It�s called a TUBA. You won�t have to worry
about scarring.�

&nbsp;

The moment when she was
called away came all too soon for her. 

&nbsp;

After the surgery, Jerry had
offered to administer a mild sedative for the ride home. There would be
residual pain and swelling for the next few weeks but there was no reason she
should suffer the long ride and its many road hazards. James agreed and
accepted the offer.

&nbsp;

Debbie slept through the
night. When she awoke the next morning, it was to see the friendly confines of
their bedroom. Initially, she thought it had been a dream, having no
remembrances of the return trip. Upon rising, she realized that it had not been
a dream.

&nbsp;

A loud &quot;Oh, my
God!&quot; brought James to his feet. She was awake and, obviously, a bit
surprised at her enhancements.

&nbsp;

&quot;How fucking big are my
tits?&quot; she demanded as he entered the room. &quot;I'm fucking huge! What
the fuck did you do to me?&quot;

&nbsp;

James said nothing. Her
reaction was not a surprise to him. Instead, he sat on the bed and listened to
her as spoke. She was not angry. Instead there was an accepting sadness as she
spoke.

&nbsp;

�This makes you happy?� she
asked. �Is this what you wanted?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, my love, it makes me
happy. Part of what you see is swelling, though.� He reached forward and wiped
a tear from her eye. �You need to keep this bra on for the next few weeks, by
the way.�

&nbsp;

For several hours after her
awakening, they would lay together. Sometimes her speech would be fast and
nervous and others slow and melancholy. As the hours passed she asked,
repeatedly, if he �really and truly� liked her new �soccer ball tits�.

&nbsp;

Of all the things she had
experienced it was, in fact, the most difficult thing she had been forced to
come to grips with. Daily, it seemed, she would decide to tell James she wanted
her implants removed. However, each time she faced him she failed to tell him
her wishes, imagining his disappointment. After a few months of inner turmoil,
she came to accept her new breasts.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The Object of His Affection
� Wanting the Unwanted 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

It was a Friday night. James
had placed a gift-wrapped box on the bed and suggested it find it's way onto her body. &quot;We're going out&quot;, he
shouted from the bathroom, readying himself for a shower.

&nbsp;

Obedient and excited, she
pulled the contents from the box, flinging wrapping paper about the bed and
floor. Within the box was a long silk evening gown and matching high-heeled
shoes. When she slipped into it, she could only stare at the reflection of the
beauty clad in pearlescent silk. It was all she could do not to cry.

&nbsp;

When next she saw him, he
was dressed in a fine silk suit. It was black but for small flecks of burgundy
which brought out the color in his tie. She gasped, thinking him the most
handsome man in the world.

&nbsp;

&quot;Tonight, we dine with
some of my friends. In fact, you know Jerry. He is in town for some
event&quot;, he told her. &quot;There will be others. They all know of our
relationship and are, in fact, involved in similar relationships as us.&quot;

&nbsp;

She was a bit put off by his
announcement. This would be the first time her relationship would be known to
others and it made her uncomfortable. She was made a bit easier by his
revelation that the others were involved similarly. Still, it was a bit
off-putting. Once the night was over, however, she was at ease and happy.

&nbsp;

&quot;James&quot;, she
beamed at him. &quot;That was a marvelous night. Who would have thought Jerry
would be the dancer he is?&quot; 

&nbsp;

James grinned at her, well
aware of his friend�s abilities. 

&nbsp;

&quot;And you...you are evil
- a tease. You had me hot all night!&quot; she giggled. &quot;Why didn't you
tell me you could dance like that? And, James...why haven't you taken me dancing before?&quot;

&nbsp;

James stared at her, eyes
narrow. She shivered, startled by the evil look in his eyes. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Fuck me. You're going
to torture me tonight, aren't you?&quot; Her voice was barely audible. 

&nbsp;

Later that night, she found
herself on her back, doubled over as she had been so many times before. James
stood over her, his eyes ablaze and piercing through the darkness in the dim
light of the room. He was slow in the removal of his suit. When he was finally
naked, his cock stood out from him, a spit in search of a victim. Slowly he
slid on the bed to rest his cock between her legs.

&nbsp;

She shivered and tried,
vainly, to push against him. Slight gasps and vocalized chirps escaped her lips
as she shivered in anticipation. He was rubbing his cock between the cheeks of
her ass now, running the tip of his cock over the small hole.

&nbsp;

&quot;Please don't&quot;,
she begged. �Not tonight.�

&nbsp;

He had only taken her ass
only once. She had hated it and hoped he would never again make her suffer
through such pain. 

&nbsp;

&quot;You will ask for this
tonight&quot;, he told her in a low voice. 

&nbsp;

She nodded her head
negatively, knowing she would never do such a thing.

&nbsp;

He nodded back at her. �You
will�, he told her.

&nbsp;

James stroked his fingers
across the hole in her posterior, threatening entry but never entering. He bent
down and flicked his tongue against her hole, surprising her. She moaned with
the cool tickle, wondering if what he did felt good. It couldn't feel good, she
knew. But had it?

&nbsp;

He repeated his action again
and again, tickling her hole with his tongue. Her concentration faltered and
she found herself enjoying it, only to turn it away. He was merciless. Before
long, she was helpless to deny her pleasure. Soon, she was begging to cum -
begging for him to fuck her.

&nbsp;

&quot;No,
no, my slut. Beg to be fucked up
the ass&quot;, he whispered. &quot;Then you will be fucked.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I can't&quot;, she
cried. &quot;I can't.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I won't fuck you until
you beg me to fuck your ass.&quot;

&nbsp;

She groaned, her will
weakening. The sensations were intense and terrible. The humiliation of the
moment was greater than she could over come and brought a sense of terrible and
torturous need. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Please fuck my
ass!&quot; she burst out, suddenly.

&nbsp;

&quot;Ask again, slut&quot;,
he spat.

&nbsp;

�Please don�t make me beg
for it again�I can�t,� she cried. 

&nbsp;

�Beg me to fuck your ass�,
he demanded.

&nbsp;

He leaned down over her,
staring through the darkness, rubbing his cock across her tightened sphincter.
He pressed against it, again threatening entry: never entering. 

&nbsp;

�Beg for it�, he demanded
again, continuing his non-advancing assault on her bottom. �I won�t enter you
until you beg, whore�.

&nbsp;

His words sent her over the
edge. Able to take no more of his torture, she began to beg as he had
commanded. First it was a breathless whisper.�
Her pleas were unanswered so her begging became louder. Then, just as
her words turned to another scream begging him to fuck her ass, he obliged her.


&nbsp;

He was slow this time. After
lubricating himself with her heavily flowing juices he slipped his cock into
her waiting hole. Upon his second stroke she found herself in the throes of a
powerful orgasm, followed by another and then another.

&nbsp;

His motions were slow and
steady and then halting and hard. He stared into her eyes, meeting her in a
steady gaze. He whispered words of love, filling her with warmth. Then his
words changed to degrading and crass attacks, only to return to more loving
words. 

&nbsp;

It was a difficult night for
her. Once they had finished making love, she had cried herself to sleep, taken with the strange turn she had taken. Her most
powerful orgasms had come, not after words of love and care but after his most
vulgar accusations. She had previously accepted a need for humiliation. On this
night, however, she had faced it, truly understanding her need for humiliation.


&nbsp;

The next day, as she
showered, she reflected on the night past. It was beyond her to imagine that
something that had been so terrible could be so incredibly satisfying. She had
experienced powerful orgasms before but never any that had been quite so powerful as those she experienced last night. Too, she
reflected on her self-discovery and wondered how it could be. 

&nbsp;

After drying herself and applying
her cuffs and collar, she came downstairs to the breakfast table. James was
just setting their breakfast on the table when she entered the room. His first
gaze brought a blush to her skin, embarrassed by her actions the previous
night.

&nbsp;

&quot;You forgot to ask if
you could cum, you know?&quot;

&nbsp;

She looked at him with a
sheepish look. &quot;I didn't think...I was...you�&quot;,
she stammered.

&nbsp;

&quot;I know&quot;, he
chuckled. &quot;It's okay. Sit.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;You know&quot;, he
began &quot;Jerry was telling me that he could make your waist a little smaller.
It's a minor bit of surgery. A small incision, the removal of a rib and a
couple adjustments and you would have an even smaller waist.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;What are you looking
for: Barbie?&quot; she laughed. &quot;Think I'll pass on it.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I didn't think you
would go for the idea. Not right now, anyway&quot;, he said. &quot;Think on it.
I think it would look pretty damned hot.&quot;

&nbsp;

The Object of His Affection
� A New Set of Clothes 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Her life, over the next two
years became a mix of emotions.� James,
understanding her nature more fully than ever, put her suggestibility to work.
Nightly, he saw to it that she would suffer a barrage of conflicting emotions
and stimulation. Terrible downs would be followed by extreme highs. Pain,
pleasure and humiliation would be intermixed, confusing her senses while
instilling in her a need to suffer for his pleasure.

&nbsp;

As a consequence to his
tortures she was a constant mass of questions and confusion, at peace only when
she forgot the woman she had been and gave in to being the pleasure toy he told
her she was.

&nbsp;

As the eve of their fourth
anniversary loomed, Debbie had become more lost in her role as James'
plaything. It was not difficult for her to do so.� Her nature and his constant barrage of
terrible pleasures, conflicting emotions and need to please made it a near
necessity to do so. 

&nbsp;

It was at this time that he
suggested it was time for her to reconsider having her waist minimized to a
size more befitting his tastes. To his pleasure, there was little sign of the
strong willed woman she had once been.� There was only a brief smile and an �okay�.
She had, he saw, crossed a line and become much closer to what he always knew
she could be. 

&nbsp;

A few weeks after they
celebrated their anniversary, James took her, once again, to see his friend
Jerry.

&nbsp;

As before, the
&quot;Facility&quot; made her wary. This time there was even more trepidation
when she arrived. But, as he wished, she went through with her surgery. Several
hours later James drove back home with an unconscious
and forever changed passenger.

&nbsp;

Her modification, Jerry
explained, would be more painful and would remain sensitive for a longer period
than had her previous modification. As a consequence, she was kept rather numb
for several weeks following thanks to the potent painkillers Jerry had assigned
to her care.

&nbsp;

When she was able to resume
her life she did so, taking this change in better stride than she had the
first. It was not, after all, quite as obvious or intrusive. Besides, she
admitted to herself, she had always wanted a smaller waistline. Most important
to her was James enthusiasm over her nineteen-inch waistline. His smiling face
had made it all worthwhile for her.

&nbsp;

It was shortly after her
recovery that James surprised her with a brand new piece of clothing: A cat
suit. He explained that, when he was young, he had always been enamored with
women in tight cat suits.� &quot;I always
wanted to fuck Batgirl and Catwoman&quot;. Now, I can. Only you look far better
than they ever could have.&quot;

&nbsp;

She blushed, pleased at his
comment.

&nbsp;

Accompanying her sexy new
outfit was a butt plug with a tail. Along with her discovery of the plug came a
brief comment that she was not overly happy with this new toy. Nonetheless,
other than that one comment, there was no attempt to sway him from his want.
His pleasure was, after all, of paramount importance to her. 

&nbsp;

The suit fit exactly as he
had hoped. It was surprisingly easy to get into, having considerable
elasticity. As she slipped into it she noticed it had openings for her ass and
sex. &quot;I won't ever need to remove it&quot;, she thought wryly. Finally,
clad in the dark blue cat suit she contemplated the plug she would soon be wearing.
Then, after moistening the oppressive item, she slipped it into her bottom.

&nbsp;

It was a difficult walk down
the stairs and into the living room. She was embarrassed by the plug and
suffered from a powerful need to climax with virtually every step. She realized,
as she walked, that her arousal was due, in part, to
the physical aspects of the plug but even more because of the humiliating
effect it had on her. In short, by the time she had descended the stairs and
made her way to the living room, she was entirely aroused and needing for
gratification.

&nbsp;

Upon her entry into the
living room James' eyes widened. For him, she was a vision of beauty, exuding a
sexiness that he had never been privy to. For many minutes he made her prance
back and forth. Then, he commanded she fall to her hands and knees, ass up
high, while pacing the floor. 

&nbsp;

This took a terrible toll on
her. Each movement she made was an exercise in self-control and she found it
terribly difficult not to climax. Sensing this, James forced her to pose and
dance and prance about until she could barely stand the intense arousal that
filled her body.

&nbsp;

Finally, he relented and
allowed her to take to her knees and rest. Then he left his position on the
couch to kneel behind her. The sound of his pants unzipping told her she would,
finally, receive the release she so needed. 

&nbsp;

�Cum for me,� he commanded
with his first hard thrust.

&nbsp;

Again and again she came,
his command making it impossible to stop. She screamed and screamed again, lost
in her terrible and much needed orgasm. Soon, she was entirely lost, forgetting
who she was and knowing only her need, his commands and her painfully wonderful
orgasms.

&nbsp;

He growled out to her as he
neared climax �Where do you want me to cum, slut?�

&nbsp;

�On my face,� she cried out,
hardly understanding his question.

&nbsp;

It was over. They lay
sprawled on the floor, exhausted and hot. Sticky semen ran it's
slow course down her face, drying as it spread. He had taken her twice, each
time remarking how sexy she looked and how much he had enjoyed fucking her with
her ass filled. 

&nbsp;

&quot;I want you to wear
that plug all the time, baby&quot;, she heard him say. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Okay, baby&quot;, she
breathed out.

&nbsp;

The early light of morning
found them still sprawled on the floor and having barely moved. James woke to
find that Debbie had removed her plug and was most disappointed. Once apprised
of his disappointment, she explained that, sometime during the night, it woke
her and was causing her a terrible and unpleasant pain. He accepted this with
the caveat that he expected her to wear it as much as possible. When she got
more accustomed to it she would be expected to wear it at all times. 

&nbsp;

�Okay, I will�, she
answered. 

&nbsp;

By the week's end Debbie was
wearing her plug, much as he had hoped, more than not. She still awoke with
occasional pain but it was not so terrible as it had
been that first night. By the end of another two week she was able to leave it
installed in her plentiful bottom for indefinitely long periods. James�
pleasure was well noted and he hoped there would come a time when it would
never need to be removed.

&nbsp;

Finally, after wearing the
plug for nearly a month, she began to wonder at her situation. The plug no
longer posed any difficulty when she installed it and it never caused her any
pain. It was then that she had a terrible thought that there might come a time
when she might need the plug to keep her bowels from emptying. 

&nbsp;

It was Saturday.� She was putting breakfast on the table when
he entered the room and took his place at the table. Following him to the table
and taking a seat, she decided she would voice her concerns regarding her butt
plug.

&nbsp;

&quot;James&quot;, she began
&quot;you know how I have been wearing the plug all the time?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Of
course. And I am quite happy
about it, &quot;he said, glancing up from his morning paper.

&nbsp;

&quot;Well, I'm
worried.&quot;

&nbsp;

Setting his newspaper aside,
James sipped at his coffee, regarding her for a moment. &quot;What's to worry
about?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;It goes in too
easy&quot;, she said. &quot;What if...what if I need it after while?&quot;

&nbsp;

James grinned. &quot;Well, I
want you to need it. But then, I want you to need everything I do to you.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;No&quot;, she
stuttered. &quot;That's not what I mean. I mean...what if my ass...what if it
stretches me and I have to keep it in? You know, what if I lose control down
there?&quot;

&nbsp;

James chuckled a bit. Then,
seeing the honest concern she was expressing he became more serious. &quot;I
doubt that would happen. But, if it did it wouldn't be so bad. I like being
able to slide into your ass so easily. Frankly, I have been thinking of getting
you a larger plug.&quot;

&nbsp;

She was aghast. 

&nbsp;

&quot;A
larger plug?&quot; She whispered.

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes&quot;, he said.
&quot;And if you ended up needing it I think it would be rather amusing.
Really, the thought is quite a turn on. It might be a fun experiment to find
out, in fact.&quot;

&nbsp;

For a long moment she stared
at him, not knowing what to say. Then, still unnerved, she returned to her
meal, finishing with nary a word.

&nbsp;

A few weeks following their
conversation James decided to go through with his experiment. Something about
her needing a plug excited him and he was determined to find out if she could
be brought to such a point. With that in mind, he made a trip to a local adult
toy store and purchased three plugs; each larger than the next and all larger
than the one she currently wore. When Debbie was apprised of his purchase she
was in shock. 

&nbsp;

&quot;You're serious? You
want me to...you want...do I have to?&quot; was all she could manage.

&nbsp;

He smiled, affirming his
wish and giving her the smallest of the three plugs. &quot;It's not so big,
this one, maybe the size of my wrist. It may be a bit of a struggle but you'll
manage, I am sure.&quot;

&nbsp;

Reluctantly, but without
protest, she took the proffered plug and headed to the bedroom. Sitting on the
bed she pulled open her bedside drawer and pulled some lubricant from within.
She was slow in her movements; disliking the swap and wishing it were
otherwise. After a short time, she had removed one plug and began inserting the
larger plug. She had only a little difficulty inserting this plug. It was not
much larger than the other. However, where her old plug contoured to a rather
small neck, this one remained substantially thicker. When she was finished, she
returned to James who sat reclining on their couch.

&nbsp;

&quot;Turn around, bend over
and show me&quot;, he demanded. Always obedient, she obeyed.

&nbsp;

&quot;That's a good girl.
Now, go get into that cat suit&quot;, he told her.

&nbsp;

It took her a bit to get
used to the new plug. It was several weeks, in fact, before she was able to
wear it on a full time basis. Then, after she had worn it for a month straight,
he told her that it was time to &quot;trade up and get to the next level&quot;.

&nbsp;

Unlike before, this plug was
quite difficult to wear. It was not much larger at its thickest point. However,
it retained much more thickness at its base. Once the plug was fully seated,
she felt strangely aroused and began to wonder if her want for humiliation knew
no bounds.

&nbsp;

As before, this plug took a
while to get used to. During her first day of wearing it she had to remove it
several times for the pain it caused. Each time it was removed, James insisted
on replacing it with the smaller of her new plugs. 

&nbsp;

�We don�t want you to have
an accident, do we?� he would chastise her, certain that his words fed into her
need for humiliation.

&nbsp;

It took a full two months
for her to finally be able to wear the plug for twenty-four hours without
removal. After only one week of full time wear she was assigned to begin
training with the largest of her plugs.

&nbsp;

It was an odd moment for
her. This swapping of plugs would be a tremendous trial for her. Not only was
it nearly as large as his wrist doubled but it would surely remove all hope of
ever having any bowel control. Her arousal at this thought thoroughly shamed
her and she wondered, as she often did, what was wrong with her. 

&nbsp;

James was watching the
television when she came down stairs and into the room. Her walk was different
and it was evident that she was in pain. Smiling at Debbie, he told her to turn
around. 

&nbsp;

&quot;It hurts?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes&quot;, she sobbed.

&nbsp;

&quot;Just leave it in for
twenty minutes&quot;, he said. &quot;Then take it out for an hour and put the
other plug in. You'll get used to it.&quot;

&nbsp;

She nodded.

&nbsp;

The largest of the plugs was
not an easy thing. It was months before she could wear it for the time he
wished. Eventually, however, there was no need to remove it with exception of
necessities and those occasions when he would take her anally. 

&nbsp;

During her time of
adjustment, James had made several more purchases. It seemed that she had an
endless supply of cat suits and he insisted on her wearing them nearly full
time.

&nbsp;

&quot;How do you get
these?&quot; She wondered allowed one day. &quot;I mean, it's not every one who
has a girl with huge tits and a super small waist. I mean, these fit me like
they were made for me.&quot;

&nbsp;

James smiled. &quot;They
were. When you had your waist adjusted I had Jerry take your measurements. They
make these things for people like us. They even have stuff that you can wear
for months without removal. His operation is really very cool.&quot;

&nbsp;

The mention of Jerry brought
a dark cloud to the conversation. The man was excellent at what he did but
there was something sinister about the man. She couldn't quite put her finger
on it; he had always been very pleasant, even likable. Still, she felt a
terrible foreboding when his name was mentioned, despite James' friendship with
him.

&nbsp;

The Object of His Affection
� Her New Skin

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&quot;I like what we've
done&quot;, he told her. &quot;I like it a lot.&quot;

&nbsp;

�What do you mean?� she
asked.

&nbsp;

&quot;Your tits, your waist
and your ass&quot;, he explained. &quot;You know, when we take out the plug it
stays open. Doesn't close. Not even when you try to
close it. Well, it does a little. But not much.&quot;

&nbsp;

A chill ran through her. He
had accomplished what she had feared he would. Suddenly, she was horrified. Not
because she no longer had control of a most private bodily function but because
the issuance of his words made her considerably wet.

&nbsp;

&quot;How could I get
excited over this? How could it make me so horny? What kind of a person am
I?&quot; she thought. 

&nbsp;

James smiled at her
wide-eyed horror, unknowing of the thoughts in her head but suspecting of the
inner turmoil. 

&nbsp;

&quot;I told you a long time
ago. I told you, you were made to be a toy�, he told her.

&nbsp;

&quot;He's right. How could
he not be right with how I react?&quot; she thought. &quot;I like being a toy
and not having control...him having it all.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I'm thinking of having
a suit made for you: a suit you can wear for months at a time&quot;, he told
her. She was still reeling from her humiliated excitement and barely heard his
words. &quot;I think it would be fun to have you in plastic for long periods of
time.&quot;

&nbsp;

The rest of the day was a
blur to her. Her thoughts were fleeting and unfocussed. Even her responses to
his amorous attention were reacted to with unknowing and automatic responses.
Then, as night closed upon them and her eyes grew heavy, she made a conscious
decision to let go of the woman she had been. The last flame of resistance went
out in her that night. 

&nbsp;

&quot;I am what I am&quot;,
she thought. &quot;He always told me so.&quot;

&nbsp;

A month passed and then
another month. Increasingly, as the days wore on, she became more and more
accepting of her nature. Gradually, she began to forget her former self and
began to latch on to the memory of his words: that she was meant to be a toy.
Often, she would repeat, as if a mantra, a comment he had made many years ago
that &quot;A woman�s body is the life support system for her holes.&quot; He
had said it in jest. It was no longer just a jest for her. Instead, it was what
she began beleive. She found herself happiest when she did.

&nbsp;

Another year passed,
followed, inevitably, by another. Each passing day brought her closer to
forgetting her old self.� Her very
existence became a need to serve and please James. For her efforts, she was
rewarded with humiliation piled on top of more humiliation. It had become her
sustenance and she found herself unable to think of little more than her near
constant state of arousal and need for humiliation.

&nbsp;

It was a bright summer day
when they took another trip to the far away facility. James had told her how
proud he was of her in fulfilling his want for her to be his sex toy. This
filled her with a strange pride which, she mused, many would find odd. It was
this day that he revealed to her that he wished her to undergo another
modification. It would not, he informed her, be nearly as intrusive as her
previous modifications but, instead, would allow her to maintain a more
youthful appearance for far longer than she would otherwise.� More importantly, she would manage to more
completely fulfill his want for her to appear more like the doll he wanted her
to be.

&nbsp;

A return to the �Facility�
was not something she would have wished for, had she been her old self. Further
modification would not have been on her agenda, either. However, her state of
mind was more akin to an animal, knowing little more than pleasure, pain and a constant
need for sexual gratification. She was still capable of simple thought.
However, beyond minor queries and an occasional random thought, any complex
idea was barely within her grasp. 

&nbsp;

The trip was a brief one.
Unlike previous modifications, this entailed relatively simple work. A quick
local anesthetic and four small punctures followed by an hour of laser surgery
and it was over. So inconspicuous was the surgery that
she had no idea what had been done until she was told.

&nbsp;

�How long will
it last?� she inquired, as James brought the car to life.

&nbsp;

�It�s permanent�, he told
her. �Pretty soon, most of the lines on your face will actually fade away.�

&nbsp;

She sat pondering her
appearance in the passenger side mirror. No matter how she tried, she could not
raise her eyebrows or furrow her brow. Another of her findings was that she was
unable to frown and that she had to concentrate, rather intensely, to form
certain shapes with her mouth. Finally, after nearly an hour of trying, she
gave up, never giving it any more thought.

&nbsp;

Shortly after their arrival
at their home, James brought forth a box. Pulling the contents from within,
James explained that Jerry had provided him with two plastic �cat suits�.
Unlike her old cat suits, these were designed with a top and bottom, foregoing
the zipper in the back. They were also flesh toned, matching the color of her
skin. 

&nbsp;

�Before you put this on�, he
explained, �We will have to coat your body with an ointment that Jerry gave
me.�

&nbsp;

She looked at him
quizzically. �What�s it for?�

&nbsp;

�Well�, he began, �unlike
the other cat suits this will remain on for quite a long time�as long as a
month. It�s designed to allow your skin to �breathe� while providing the
appearance of a synthetic skin. The ointment is�well; it�ll allow the suit to
stay on for a longer time. It�s a chemical process that bonds the suit to your
skin temporarily. It lasts as long as a month and sometimes longer.�

&nbsp;

For many moments she said
nothing, pondering James� plans for her as she stared at the flesh toned apparel.
Finally, she shrugged, smiled and bobbed her head �okay�. 

&nbsp;

�When do you want me to put
it on?� she asked.

&nbsp;

�As soon as you shower and
shave�, he informed her. �Now go�.

&nbsp;

The water finally warmed to
satisfaction, she stepped into the shower. Something about what he had told her
bothered her, but she couldn�t quite place it. By the time she had completed
her tasks and dried her body and hair her worry was forgotten, replaced by the
happiness and arousal she always felt when she gave over to pleasing James.

&nbsp;

The process of fitting her
into the suit was slow. Wearing the gloves that had been provided with the cat
suits, James began rubbing the ointment into her skin, starting with her feet,
calves and thighs. Once the suit had been pulled up to her crotch, James
applied more ointment to her more private areas and then pulled the suit up,
carefully fitting it against her skin. 

&nbsp;

Once James had smoothed out
the wrinkles, he turned to applying more ointment to her upper body. As he did
so, she noticed that her lower extremities were becoming quite warm. The suit,
too, seemed to be tightening against her skin. A brief moment of wonder passed
and she gave in to the sensation, enjoying the strange feelings of arousal that
accompanied it. 

&nbsp;

Finally, her upper body covered
in the ointment, he commanded she lift her arms and to hold them in place until
commanded otherwise. Dutifully, she obeyed. A moment later found him sliding
the top portion of the new garment over her head. Once in place, and as he had
before, he smoothed out all of the wrinkles he could find, carefully ensuring
that her large bust fitted into the suit properly. 

&nbsp;

How long she stood for she
could not have said. She only knew that the suit, for whatever reasoning, had
grown warm, nearly to the point of burning, and that it was becoming quite
tight.

&nbsp;

After James had judged a
sufficient amount of time had passed, he applied a small amount of the ointment
to the suits overlapping lower and upper halves and smoothed them against one
another. Some minutes later, she was finally allowed to move again.

&nbsp;

It was a strange night for
her. The sensations she had felt at the application of the suit had excited and
frightened her. Why it was frightening she could not say. She only knew that
her fright had added to her arousal and, by the time she was no longer required
to be stationary, she was more than desperate for James� affections.
Unfortunately, the suit had to �cure� for several hours before she could be
used as she wanted him to use her. Consequently, she spent the night in
frustrated slumber.

&nbsp;

As morning came into
existence, Debbie woke. She felt about her body, hoping to find what James felt
so attractive about her new skin. It was smooth and nearly wrinkle
free. She found that, while she could feel the pressure of her hand on her
body, she was unable to find any real sensation. She attempted to pinch herself
but was unable, the suit being far too taut. 

&nbsp;

Eventually, nature called.
Upon getting out of bed she discovered her image in their closet door mirror. She
was devoid of any true features. Her face was empty of expression and her body
no longer showed any signs of humanity, her naval, nipples and sex being
entirely hidden from view. Even the narrow slit between her legs was virtually
invisible. Giving her appearance barely more than a thought, she traversed the
distance to the bathroom to complete her business. 

&nbsp;

The day passed quickly. Much
to her pleasure, James took the opportunity to use her for his sexual pleasures
frequently. To her surprise, however, James was not long lasting as he usually
was. Clearly, her new apparel had increased his excitement levels
substantially. It was of little matter to her. With her ability to orgasm at
his command, she could orgasm whenever he chose, which was often.

&nbsp;

As the days wore on, she
discovered that she liked the new James. Her libido had been fairly high before
becoming his �girl�. Since her acceptance of her place as a sexual plaything,
it had increased to levels she had not thought possible. In short, she thought
of little other than sex. Consequently, his increased sex drive was a relief to
her ever-needful libido. 

&nbsp;

It was nearly a month later
when she noticed that, much to her disappointment, her new �skin� was
deteriorating. It would, James told her, have to be removed.

The Object of His Affection
� Forgetting Debbie 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

For the next month, she was
as she had been before. Her skin, much to their mutual disappointment, was
blotchy and sensitive. Consequently, she found life most difficult, her
movements causing her a constant but mild burning sensation. 

&nbsp;

She had inquired as to
wearing the other suit James had made for her. Unfortunately, she was informed,
they would have to wait until her skin returned to normal. This had brought her
nearly to tears. Not only was she less the toy than she had been, but she was
unable to satisfy her lustful needs or those of James. Even had she been able,
she knew that she would not be half of what James wanted her to be.

&nbsp;

When the day finally came
when she would be able to resume her role as a plastic toy, she was most
joyful. However, as time wore on, she began to sadden, her days as a perfect
toy being so limited.

&nbsp;

Finally, after many months
of enduring tremendous happiness coupled with equally disappointed lows, James
approached her with a new notion. There was a process, he explained, where she
could become exactly the toy he wanted her to be. The one caveat being that it
was irreversible.

&nbsp;

James had thought that his
revelation might jar the old Debbie back into her former being. He was wrong.
So deep was her need to be whatever he wanted that she gave it no thought.
Instead, she was quick to agree, despite the obvious drawbacks. 

&nbsp;

A quick call to Jerry and
the plan was set. It would happen in January. As soon as, Jerry told them, her
skin had fully recovered and she was fit for travel.

&nbsp;

Winter was upon them. Snow
covered the ground around their home. Debbie was staring out the window,
watching the vast distance of snow, broken only by the occasional vehicle
traveling down the far away road. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Are you happy?&quot;
whispered a distant voice.

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes&quot;, she
replied. &quot;I am happy.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Do you enjoy being my
toy?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes, I enjoy being
your toy.&quot; 

&nbsp;

Her responses were almost
automatic these days, knowing what answers would please him most. His pleasure
was what she lived for now. She still had flashes of her old self. Often, they
would laugh and debate and play games. Often, he would make gentle love to her,
whispering word of soft tenderness in her ear. She truly enjoyed those moments.


&nbsp;

There was, however, a
disappointment and sadness that interrupted these moments. During these times
of play and gentle love making she would be reminded of the woman she had once
been. She did not like that woman and wished she could forget her entirely. She
was his toy and she detested being reminded of who she had once been. She
longed, now, to be his toy in body and mind, free of worry or disappointment.

&nbsp;

&quot;It's time�, he told
her.

&nbsp;

She was glad to be taking
this trip. Finally, she would no longer be a disappointment to James, becoming
exactly what James wanted. Only now it would be for forever and not for brief
splashes of time. Finally, she would be the perfect toy and James would be
happy for now and always.

&nbsp;

Sitting in the passenger
seat of his car, she watched the world pass by, line-by-line, field-by-field,
moment-by-moment. Then, as if out of a seeming dream, he roused her. They had
arrived at their destination. 

&nbsp;

Jerry greeted them with warm
handshakes when they entered his office. Gone was her wariness of the place, replaced
with a sense of euphoria. It was here, she knew, she would die and be reborn as
a perfect toy. How this transformation would be accomplished she had little
clue, even doubting that it could be done so
completely as she had been told. Then she wondered what it would be like. Her
thoughts left her when she saw James� smiling face as she was led away for her
transformation.

&nbsp;

She was aware, despite heavy
sedation, of the changes being made. Her hair disappearing from her body was
her first and most powerful memory. Lasers had been used to remove her body
hair. Afterwards, her long auburn tresses were shorn from her head, lasers
seeing to its permanence.� 

&nbsp;

Her awareness became less
vivid from that point. A snippet here and there was all she had. Most of it was
minor pain or fear of what she was told or what was being done to her. They
were not cruel. Most of her time was spent in a dreamy and euphoric state.
Finally the snippets of life ended and she slept. Her next vision brought her
to her to the comforts of her home. 

&nbsp;

She was standing in their
bedroom, facing out the window when her eyes fluttered open. She tried to move
and then to speak but was unable. Without conscious thought she wondered what
was wrong with her. Then she remembered. She was no longer herself anymore.
They had gone to see Jerry. Now she was a toy. But what that meant, exactly,
she could no longer remember.

&nbsp;

Time passed, though she knew
not how long. She saw James pass into her field of vision and felt a wash of
happiness course through her. James was staring into her open eyes, smiling. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Am I the perfect toy?
Have I made you happy?&quot; she tried to ask, finding speech beyond her
capabilities.

&nbsp;

James approached and spoke.
His words were distant. She could hear him but only vaguely. His lips read
&quot;thank you&quot; and &quot;happy&quot; and &quot;love&quot;. She picked
out &quot;beautiful&quot;. It made her happy.

&nbsp;

He moved from beyond her
sight and she was suddenly moving. A mirror came into view and she found her
reflection staring back at her. Only it was not her reflection. It resembled
her but it was not. The drugs in her system had not given up their powerful
effects and she found it difficult to focus, suddenly. The moment of
disorientation cleared and she was able, once again, to take stock of the
figure in front of her. 

&nbsp;

�It looks like me but it
isn�t�, she thought. 

&nbsp;

Then she noted the perfectly
round �O� and the enlarged lips that formed it. They were red and full.� The face surrounding the lips looked
strangely like her face while suffering from a distinct manikin-like
appearance; shiny and wrinkle free. Then she noted that her entire body
appeared to be similarly unreal.

&nbsp;

�Ah�, she thought. �This is
me, the toy. I almost forgot.�

&nbsp;

There was no remorse or
sadness. There was no fear or anger at what she had become. There was simply
realization and acceptance and she began to remember how she had not believed
it possible.� 

&nbsp;

More and more she began to
remember Jerry and the things he had told her. Debbie glanced down, remembering
Jerry�s words as he told her that her feet had been slimmed down and contoured
to a more pleasing size. 

&nbsp;

�Yes�they are smaller�, she
noted. �Forever pointed, he told me.�

&nbsp;

It began coming back to her.
She had regained consciousness at one point during her healing process.
Exhausted, sore and unable to move, she found Jerry over her. 

&nbsp;

�I can�t move�, she
remembered saying.

&nbsp;

�Yes, I know�, he said.

&nbsp;

Her broken memory struggled
to remember more, but she had been drugged and unable to retain more than
snippets of his conversation. �What had he told me about neural implants?� She
was struggling, trying to remember his words. What was it he said about the
neural implants?

&nbsp;

Another memory flashed and
she remembered the pain she felt after they had applied her new �skin�. It was
similar, she recalled, to the sensation her cat suit had caused, only far more
severe. �It�s becoming a part of your epidermis�, he she remembered jerry
telling her, �bonding with your skin.�

&nbsp;

A sudden flow of warm water
flowed into her, jerking her from her thoughts. James tried to explain that it
was her daily enema but she was unable to make out his words. 

&nbsp;

Another glance in the mirror
brought her focus to the post that she was situated on. For a long moment she
questioned its purpose, finally remembering that it was part of her �doll
stand�. Jerry had explained it�s dual functions as
enema valve and mounting post, before she had been completely transformed. The
water inside of her intestines was let out and she wondered at the sensation.
It felt good - relieving. 

&nbsp;

�Tired, she thought. �Why am
I so tired?� 

&nbsp;

Her eyes closed and sleep
overcame her. Suddenly, she found herself in the facility in a darkened
corridor. She was running, hoping to outrun the mechanical bugs that pursued
her. Suddenly, the bugs were in front of her, leaping at her from all sides.
She reached out and hit one but it was undamaged and gained grip on her hand.
Its pinchers severed her flesh, crawling into the wound it had created. Pain
lanced through her hand and she felt her muscles pull from all sides, nearly
paralyzing her hand.

&nbsp;

More of the mechanical bugs
began leaping at� her.
They attacked her legs and back and belly. They crawled up her arms and into
places she could not see. Then a terrible pain struck as her entire body became
rigid and she fell to the ground. 

&nbsp;

James appeared. He was a
giant, many times her size. She tried to run from him but found herself unable,
her limbs stiff and unmovable. James picked her up and began painting her with
varnish. The varnish burned and she thought she might die. 

&nbsp;

�Don�t worry,� said the
giant James, �it�s only taking off a few layers of skin. The burning will stop
after a few hours. Then you�ll be perfect.�

&nbsp;

Again she was back at the
�Facility�. She lay on her back on a heavy table, unable to move or to scream.
Suddenly, her breasts began inflating until the protruded from her body like
two torpedoes. Likewise, her lips reformed into a perfect �O�, swelling as they
did so. 

&nbsp;

Again, her vision changed
and she found herself in Jerry�s office. James and Jerry were talking in low
tones. They turned to her, smiling. 

&nbsp;

�Congratulations,� Jerry
boomed. �You�re going to be turned into a living doll!�

&nbsp;

She ran to James, holding on
to him for dear life. From everywhere came hands, grabbing her and tearing her
from James� arms. She was dragged, kicking and screaming, to be placed on a
table. Jerry was over her, smiling and holding a scalpel.

&nbsp;

She awoke with a panic. A
moment�s recovery cleared her head and she realized she had been dreaming.
Another moment passed and the reality of her current state returned to her. 

&nbsp;

Looking in the mirror again,
she wondered at the magnificence of what had been done. Though she had had
little doubt in the outcome of the procedures, she had little understanding of
how incredibly unreal she would look. There were no seems in her �skin�, nor
were there any blemishes. Her fingers were long and slender and adorned with
perfectly shaped fingernails. Likewise, her feet were perfect and seemingly of
molded plastic. Most striking, she noted, was the tiny waist she now possessed,
offset by the large torpedo shaped cones mounted on her chest.

&nbsp;

A moment of disbelief came
over her. That the transformation would have been so perfect was almost
impossible to have imagined. Then, as if she had been waiting for this moment
for all her life, she forgot herself and slipped into her new life as a perfect
sex doll. Comfortable in her new place, she slept.

&nbsp;

The Object of His Affection
� A Visit

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

For the next twelve months
life was blissful for the new doll owner. James made certain to use her in
every fashion he could conceive. Never was he so pleased. His doll, on the
other hand, felt little. His penetration of her orifices gave her little
sensation, barely waking her from her near constant state of sleep. On those
rare occasions when she was awake and aware, she thought of little, her mind
having given into her position. It was on the eve of her anniversary of
becoming a doll, however, that this changed. 

&nbsp;

The knock on the door woke
James from his Sunday football game. He was pleasantly surprised to find that
it was his old friend Jerry. After offering him a drink and a cigar they sat on
James� couch, speaking of old times and future plans, glancing occasionally at
the doll standing at the side of the room.

&nbsp;

�I trust she is holding up
well?� Jerry asked. �And I do hope you are getting full use out of her.�

&nbsp;

�Of course. She is
fantastic�, James told him �Though, I was mightily surprised at the complete
conversion.�

&nbsp;

Jerry smiled at James and
leaned back into the chair in which he was seated. �Well, we go back a bit and
I figured that you would eventually go all the way with this. So, I made a
pre-emptive strike and gave you the works. At no extra charge, I might add.�

&nbsp;

�Well, it was not something
I figured she would go for, really�, James relied. 

&nbsp;

�It was a simple suggestion,
really�, he responded. �Your training had already seen to it that her only want
was to please you. So, I offered it to her and she accepted.�

&nbsp;

�So tell me��, James asked.
�what is it that you and your conspirators are up to back at the lab these
days?�

&nbsp;

�Well�we have been working
on managing a remote system for our doll creations. I imagine it gets a bit
tedious having to pose and move your doll manually�, he commented, lighting up
his cigar. �We are hoping to manage to make that less difficult. Our genetics
department also managed to sequence portions of human DNA. The tests are positive
so far, if limited.�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;�What does that mean?
Tell me in simple terms so I can understand it.�

&nbsp;

�We can change the hair of a
black rat into whatever color we choose�, he said. �We can also increase
follicle growth per square inch and the length to which it grows. We can also
modify skin texture to a degree. Another very exciting development is that we
can induce a return to puberty.�

&nbsp;

�Ah yes, just what everyone
wants�pimples again�, James laughed.

&nbsp;

��That�s not the point, my sarcastic comrade� Jerry grinned back.
�Think about it�the one thing most of my clients want of their girls is ultra
feminization. By treating women to a second or even third puberty, we can do
just that�without surgery. We have tried with hormone treatments, but those are
hardly successful on a wide scale basis.�

&nbsp;

�Why not?�

&nbsp;

�James, most hormone
treatments are temporary. Yes, there is some success, but an initial increase
in bust size is usually temporary. For instance, most women who get pregnant
see an increase in bust size. It is rarely permanent, and never to the degree
which our clients would like. This not only increases bust size permanently,
but it stimulates bone growth. A five-foot tall woman with a C-cup breast can
grow several inches in height and her breast size will usually increase to a
permanent&nbsp;E-cup, or so. And her hips and ass�well, they become
substantially more rounded and full.�

&nbsp;

�Ah, so a couple of such
treatments can.�

&nbsp;

�Exactly!� Jerry exclaimed.
�Not only that but it tends to increase the libido rather substantially. The
addition of a second or third puberty induces a higher and more constant
hormone production.�

&nbsp;

James thought about it for a
moment before asking, �How many tests have you made?�

&nbsp;

�Only three, so far�, he
said. �But all were quite successful. I do have another subject, though. She is
undergoing our puberty process. I�ve also begun testing our DNA hair and skin
modification. She is the first to undergo the treatment.�

&nbsp;

��Interesting. But�, Jerry tilted his head inquisitively �what are
you doing, changing her from blonde to brunette or from black to white?�

&nbsp;

�Hah!� Jerry spat �Nothing
so simple as that. If it�s a success, I will let you know. Don�t you fret�you
will know. I would shout it from the rooftops if I didn�t know I would land in
the pokey!�

&nbsp;

�Another drink?� asked
James.

&nbsp;

�I�m still nursing this�, he
replied, shaking his glass. �So, you really like her?�

&nbsp;

Turning his head to the
manikin-like girl, Jerry thought for a moment. �Well, there is a bit of hassle,
as you mentioned. But all things considered I am quite pleased.�

&nbsp;

�I am rather proud of her, I
must say�, James smiled, leaving his chair. �I especially liked the narrowing
of her feet. It makes her appear tinier than she is. I do wonder�you aren�t
disappointed with her breasts are you? They are quite unrealistic in feel and
shape.�

&nbsp;

�I wanted her to appear like
a sex-doll, Jerry.� As I said before, I
was surprised by the extent to which you took her, but I am very happy with
everything.�

&nbsp;

�And the synthetic teeth�,
he began �I trust you like their feel?�

&nbsp;

James beamed a grin at
Jerry, nodding his head affirmatively.

&nbsp;

�Do you mind if I inspect
her a moment? I want to see how she is holding up.�

&nbsp;

�Of course, it will ease my
mind to know she is well�, James told him. �Sometimes, I must tell you, I worry
about her state of mind.�

&nbsp;

�Have no worries, my friend,
it was her wish to become a sex-toy for you. Besides, as I recall, she was
nearly devoid of thought when you brought her in. I imagine that her mind
is�not gone, but not here. I imagine she has reached Nirvana, so to speak.�

&nbsp;

James nodded, acknowledging
that Jerry was probably right. Then, he quieted, waiting as his friend began to
examine his creation. 

&nbsp;

Turning his back to James,
Jerry began a cursory examination of the manikin-like woman. She was entirely
unaware of his presence for most of his examination. Upon Jerry�s finger
entering her �O� shaped mouth, she woke. Her eyes opened sluggishly, to see the
man before her. At the sight of her creator, memories of her tormented and
unwanted change came flooding back to her. Just then, the girl who had
forgotten herself awoke to the horror of what she had become.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The Object of His Affection
� At the Facility

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The initial �processing� had
not been unexpected. That her body hair would be removed in its entirety she
knew. So it was that she cooperated fully with the staff that kept her.
However, upon waking to find that her teeth had been replaced with an odd
feeling synthetic and her mouth reshaped into a grotesque and puffy sex-doll
�O�, she was adamant that such was not James� intentions. Her protestations,
however, were heard with amused grins, her speech being severely hampered by
the shape of her mouth and the �O� ring that kept its shape.

&nbsp;

�My dear�, Jerry told her,
�You are to be made into a doll, remember? This is only the beginning.�

&nbsp;

��What do you mean?� she asked, her nearly
unintelligible words filled with apprehension and fear.

&nbsp;

�Well, first we are going to
remove your ability to move of your own accord�, he began. �We do this with
neural implants. These implants block your own ability to control your muscle
groups, while inducing a state of constant contraction. This allows you to
remain in any position you are posed in. It also prevents your muscles from
atrophying. After that we begin the internal processing.

&nbsp;

�Internal
processing? What�s that?� she
demanded in garbled speak and pulling at the bonds which held her to her bed.

&nbsp;

�Sterilization
and organ modification. The
transformation is quite complete�, he told her. 

&nbsp;

�You can�t�, she mustered.
�It�s not what I�we wanted.�

&nbsp;

�I�m afraid it�s already
done, my dear�, he told her. �Since your oral cavity has healed we are moving
to the next state of your processing; the immobilization process.�

&nbsp;

She stared at the doctor for
quite a few moments, tears running down her face. Then,
despite her protests and feeble attempts at resistance, the moment of
processing upon her. Wide eyed and frightened, she screamed as her
gurney was wheeled out of the room.

&nbsp;

�My dear�, Jerry hollered
over her screams, �your screams will do you no good. Besides which, we will be
forced to gag you if you persist.�

&nbsp;

She was not one to go so
easily, and shortly after she was wheeled into the room where she was to be
immobilized, she was gagged and prepared for her processing. After several
minutes of busy maneuvering in the room, Jerry began his work.

&nbsp;

�This is stage one, Debbie.
We are going to implant micro-devices into your body. It�s relatively
painless�at least the implanting procedure is�, Jerry said, peering at her from
over a monitor. �I won�t bore you with the finer details of this operation, but
I will let you in on how this works��

&nbsp;

A loud hiss called her
attention to towards the ceiling. Above her, she watched as a long cylindrical
device, with four armatures on either side, made its way to halt overhead.
Thoughts of a giant spider coming to wrap her in its web came to her mind and
she renewed her struggles. She watched it as the spider-like mechanism
descended, pressing the hollowed tip of one of its shiny metal arms against her
shoulder.

&nbsp;

�It�s not so
bad as it looks�, Jerry told her. �There will be a minor pain and then a sudden
cramping as the implants take affect. This will be in stages, of course.� First I will immobilize your shoulders, arms
and hands. Following that we will repeat the process with your lower
extremities. It gets a bit more complex after that, what with so many muscle
groups to immobilize. But don�t fret, you will still be able to breathe and
blink�and one or two other things. Oh, and before you start to worrying your
pretty little head about side effects; the only one you have to worry about is
the sleep you will require. It�s a bit taxing, after all, for ones muscles to
be in a constant state of semi-contraction.�

&nbsp;

She groaned as she felt the
machine�s arm puncture her skin. After several moments of minor pain she felt a
mild tingling. A mere moment later she felt the implant take effect. The pain
was relatively minor, little more than a mild cramp, as Jerry had promised.
However, as the process wore on, and by the time her second arm had been fully
implanted, the pain had grown considerably.

&nbsp;

�Perfect, your upper
extremities are completely immobilized�, Jerry said, proudly. �Now, for stage two.�

&nbsp;

As Jerry�s words echoed
through the girl�s head, she attempted to prove her captor wrong. She was,
despite her exertions, destined to fail. Upon realizing that Jerry did indeed
speak truth, she began to weep.

&nbsp;

Again, the machine hissed as
it glided into position, just below her torso. Then, just as before, she felt
the cold tip of a spider-like leg pressing against her body. 

&nbsp;

�James will save me,� she
thought. �James will save me�he won�t let me stay like this.� Over and over she
repeated this thought. It was her mantra � her prayer. It would go unanswered.

&nbsp;

Finally, after many hours,
the process was complete. There was little relief,
however, as Jerry informed her that the next stage of her processing involved
far more invasive techniques.

&nbsp;

�We are going to take a
break, my dear�, he told her. �After that we will complete your immobilization.
You will be asleep for that. When you wake up you will be completely immobile.
What�s more, your internal processing will be complete, as well.�

&nbsp;

The girl looked up at him
with frightened and questioning eyes. 

&nbsp;

�You want to know what all
that entails, eh?� he asked.

&nbsp;

Her answer was a short nod
of affirmation.

&nbsp;

�Well, first you are going
to be sterilized�this is not a simple tubal ligation but far more thorough. It wouldn�t do, after all,
for a doll to menstruate, would it? We will do this in conjunction with the
rerouting of your urinary tract so that it deposits waste into your large
intestine. We will also fit your colon with a valve to prevent accidental waste
expulsion. There is more, of course, but I think I will leave part of it as a
surprise. Suffice to say that, when you wake up, and even before we apply your
synthetic skin, you will appear quite doll-like.�

&nbsp;

Jerry put a finger to her
cheek, wiping away a tear. �Don�t fret, my dear. I�ll be right back.� Then he
turned and departed the room.

&nbsp;

�This is impossible!� she
told herself. That something so insidious could happen was not possible and she
steeled herself to find her way from the nightmare that her life had become. 

&nbsp;

Returning from his brief
break, Jerry returned to her side, smiling. �Ready?� he asked, removing her
gag.

&nbsp;

�Please, no�this is not what
we wanted�, she muttered through her distorted lips. The gas mask slipping over
her head quieted her and she slipped into blissful unconsciousness.

&nbsp;

She woke it was to find
herself standing in a room. It was sterile and white; as had been all of the
rooms she could remember. At first, she thought that she had been having a
nightmare from which she had just awakened. Just then, Jerry stepped into her
view and she became fully awake. 

&nbsp;

�I hope you like what you
see, my dear.� Jerry said, sliding a full-length mirror in front of her.

&nbsp;

Across from her stood naked
a girl of similar height, a post leading from the platform on which she stood
disappeared between her legs. Her mouth was set in a near perfect �O�, lips
puffy and red. Most striking, she thought, were the huge torpedo shaped breasts
that jutted out from her body in a strange and gravity-defying manner.

&nbsp;

She struggled to answer, her
voice suddenly lost.

&nbsp;

�Ah, I see�� he said. �Don�t
try to talk. You can�t. Your throat has been�er�your
throat has been replaced�well, not replaced but implanted with a synthetic
tube. So has your air canal.�

&nbsp;

Just then she felt a whoosh
of warmth filling her lower intestines. Then, as she began to feel a strange
fullness, the warmth left her, draining for whence it came.

&nbsp;

�I�m sure you are wondering
what that was all about� he began.� �Your
colon and portions of your lower intestine have been modified rather severely.
Your urinary system has been re-routed, as I mentioned. Essentially, all of
your waste is now handled through a valve located just above your synthetic
colon.� I hope I am not repeating myself.
Am I? My apologies if I am.�

&nbsp;

She stared at Jerry for a
long moment, eyeing the man for the evil he had perpetrated on her body. In
return the man smiled back at her, continuing his speech.

&nbsp;

Well, it isn�t completely
synthetic�your colon, that is. You see, your colon is, on the inside, still
your colon�mostly�, he bragged. �The valve is largely situated around your
colon. So, it�s still you, just not all you. Well, your sphincter muscle is not
you�that has been replaced with a sort of o-ring;
mostly to provide your owner with pleasure.�
It also provides a secondary seal for when you are placed on your doll
stand. When you are placed on your doll stand, as you are now, the valve is
held open and all waste is handled via the enema pump. Unfortunately, the
procedure removes most sensation from the region, as well. A fair trade, I
suppose.�

&nbsp;

She stared vacantly at the
man, his words sinking into her. Tears began to run from the corner of her eyes
and she stared past the man and at her mirrored reflection. To her horror there
was no expression, only tears rolling down her strangely vacant face. In very
short order, and for reasons unbeknownst to her, she was overcome by physical
exhaustion and was asleep soon after Jerry left her presence.

&nbsp;

Her next waking moment was
one of terrific pain. She was on her back; her legs raised upward, a strap
holding her to the table on which she lay. Her legs, it seemed, were on fire.
As with each terrifying moment, Jerry was there, offering explanation of her
current state.

&nbsp;

�The pain you are feeling is
a bonding process, my dear�, he offered. �First, we pull your new skin over
portions of your body; in this case, your legs. Then, once the skin is properly
in place, we apply the catalyst. The catalyst causes the new skin to bond with
your real skin.�

&nbsp;

She screamed in silence,
hardly hearing his words. Still, he continued his lecture.

&nbsp;

�I am particularly proud of
this invention�, he said. �Other such skins had to be removed periodically and
replaced. This skin, because of it is fibrous makeup, never needs to be removed
and any further coatings made necessary due to wear can be completed without
removal of the previous skin. It also lasts considerably longer than any other synthetic
skins we have manufactured. We actually don�t know just how long it can last.
Testing hasn�t gone beyond five years yet.�

&nbsp;

She stared at him with her
wide eyes, horror and pain filling her being as the man droned on.

&nbsp;

�Also, because of its structure,
no skin needs to be exposed�, he continued. �Previous versions required that
some skin be exposed to prevent asphyxiation. You do know that skin needs to
breathe, don�t you?�

&nbsp;

Debbie was hardly aware of
his words, the pain she was undergoing nearly overcoming her. 

&nbsp;

�You probably didn�t know
it, but you can die if your skin doesn�t breathe�, he continued. �You can
actually sweat through this skin. It�s quite remarkable, really. The only
unfortunate thing about your new skin is that it is irreversible due to the
damaging effects of the bonding process. Yes, I know; who would choose to
remove such a perfect skin as this? I would like it to be an option, though.�

&nbsp;

Jerry then ran his hands
across her legs, feeling of her knew coating. He prodded a squeezed the girls
lower extremities, testing for any abnormalities. 

&nbsp;

�I�ll tell you something
else we had to overcome with this new skin of yours�skin re-growth�, he stated
flatly. �You see, the skin, as I�m sure you know, constantly replaces itself.
As an aside, I am telling you this so you can appreciate the extent of research
and development that went into this. Anyhow, our first constructs were
completely untenable�our subjects built up dead skin under their synthetic
covering. This skin, however, allows the old dead skin to pass through the
pores, shedding off in microscopic particles. Of course, there is more to it,
but I doubt you would understand it.�

&nbsp;

Slowly, the process
continued, each arm being covered and then coated with the terrible catalyst,
her body being manipulated into various positions to ease the application of
her new skin. Her suffering at the application of her synthetic skin finally
overcame her and she slipped into unconscious darkness.

&nbsp;

She awoke sometime later,
finding herself alone in the room. The relief she felt upon awakening to find
that she was, for once, alone was soon replaced with a feeling of horror. She
was, she saw in her reflected image, a near featureless mockery of a human
being. Gone were her nipples and navel. Her crotch revealed nothing but a small
and nearly featureless cleft, reminiscent of a manikin. Then, after only a
short period of tear filled grieving, she gave in to her growing exhaustion and
slipped into blissful sleep.

&nbsp;

It seemed like only moments
before she was again awakened to find her beautiful locks being shorn from her
head. In mere minutes her once beautiful hair had been shaven from her head and
collected, to be made, she was told, into a wig. 

&nbsp;

�We wait until the last
possible moment for this procedure to get maximum length. Few of our clients
like short hair or bald dolls, for some reason.� Jerry offered to the girl.
�After it is made into a proper wig it will be secured to your head via a
process similar to what you have already undergone.�

&nbsp;

This last indignity was more
than she could take. It was as if her last remaining shred of humanity had been
removed. With it went all hope of escape from her nightmare. Then, as if had
been her own plan, she accepted her plight, her mind receding into a blissful
emptiness, reminiscent of her state when she had first come to the �Facility�,
only more so.

&nbsp;

The pain she felt as her
synthetic skin and wig was applied to her head and face was hardly noticeable
in her newly reduced state of mind. In fact, it only sent her further into an
ever-darkening abyss, far from reality and consciousness. So it was that her
final transformation was made without further stress or worry. 

&nbsp;

Her next real moment of
awareness was just before her delivery to her lover. Jerry was prodding her
body, making certain his creation met his high standards. As with all of his
former creations he had failed to tell her everything that had been done to
her. Jerry, his ego being what it was, suffered from regret at failing to tell
this one how he had shortened her toes and slimmed her feet, fixing them so
they were perpetually �Barbie doll-like�. He had also failed to tell her how
her synthetic nails would remain perfect, never chipping, fading or breaking. 

&nbsp;

�I�ll have to make a list�,
he muttered to himself.

&nbsp;

Then, his inspection
complete, she was boxed for delivery.

The Object of His Affection &#8211; Hope and Deliverance 
 
  After Jerry&#8217;s examination he drained his glass and excused himself from 
  his visit. There were people he had to see and places he had to go. After a 
  quick exchange of goodbyes and a handshake, Jerry departed.
The &#8220;Debbie-doll&#8221;, as 
  he James come to call her, watched the quick exchange, determined to get his 
  attention. How she could do so, she knew not. Still, she was determined to find 
  a way. For many minutes she watched James as he went about the house, her mind 
  racing to discover a way to make James understand her wants. 
Suddenly, she found herself being 
  maneuvered into a kneeling posture in front of the couch. Once she was properly 
  positioned, James sat directly in front of her with his legs at her sides. Leaning 
  back, he unzipped his pants, freed his cock and placed it in her sex-doll mouth. 
  Her attempts to expel him only served to aid in his growing hardness. In minutes 
  he was thrusting into her mouth with furious abandon. 
After what seemed like only moments 
  of rough thrusting, he pulled his cock from her mouth to stand over her. She 
  was lifted and positioned to lie on her belly in the middle of the room. She 
  felt his weight as he settled on top of her and thrust his cock into her ass. 
  Then, just as suddenly as she had been placed on the floor, she was lifted and 
  placed on the doll stand, never even knowing if he had climaxed or how long 
  his lustful attack had lasted. 
Then, as if by magic, she found James 
  standing in front of her pushing a tube into her mouth. Attached to the tube, 
  and being held above her mouth was a bottle, of sorts. She had seen this before 
  but had not realized what she realized now; he was feeding her. It took only 
  moments, as the liquid flowed down her throat and into her stomach. 
She decided then that her best chance 
  of James discovering her want to return to normal was to blink her eyes as rapidly 
  as possible. Maybe then he could be made to understand. But, as that thought 
  came to her she realized that it was dark. Though confused at the sudden and 
  unexpected darkness, she understood that she would have to delay her fight for 
  freedom until the next day.
She awoke to find herself lying on 
  the floor with James&#8217; cock in her mouth. He was close to climaxing, she 
  could tell by his jackhammer thrusts. This was her chance. When he was done 
  with her she would make her wants known. She would blink her eyes furiously 
  and get his attention.
A blink of an eye later and she discovered 
  that she had been propped up on her stand. The warm feeling of fullness told 
  her that she was receiving her daily enema. She looked around to find the room 
  empty. James was nowhere in sight. 
&#8220;But he was just fucking me!&#8221; 
  she screamed inwardly. &#8220;He was just fucking me.&#8221;
Again, she found herself on the floor. 
  This time she was on hands and knees. She could feel his cock filling her sex, 
  stretching her opening. It was then that she realized that, though she could 
  feel his thrusting and the sensation of fullness it brought, she could not actually 
  feel any true sensation. Her moment of anger at this realization was very quickly 
  replaced with one of wonder as she found herself, once again and very inexplicably, 
  upon her doll stand and staring into a room that was pitch black. 
&#8220;No!&#8221; she thought. &#8220;This 
  can&#8217;t be happening!&#8221; 
Then, after her brief moments of 
  conscious thoughts, she drifted to the world of dreams. As 
  was so often the case, Jerry filled her dreams. He was talking to her, telling 
  her of the things he had done to her. He was a proud and arrogant man. She hated 
  him.
Dream Jerry was smiling and telling 
  her something important. What was it? She had to hear his words; they were important. 
  Then, magically, she drifted towards him as the words issued from his smiling 
  maw &#8220;Oh, and before you start to worrying your pretty little head about 
  side effects; the only one you have to worry about is the sleep you will require. 
  It&#8217;s a bit taxing, after all.&#8221;
Her eyes opened abruptly, staring 
  into the darkness of the room. Then she realized why her life had become a series 
  of flashing scenes, changing abruptly from moment to moment. She then realized 
  that she had little hope of ever regaining her freedom or the life she once 
  shared with her beloved James. 
&#8220;I can&#8217;t stay awake long 
  enough&#8221;, she thought. &#8220;But I must! I must!&#8221;
Then she drifted, once again, into 
  her world of tortured dreams, knowing it was hopeless. A single tear ran a meandering 
  path down her synthetic cheek. It was a tear James would never see.

 Epilogue: 

For many years after, James made 
  good use of his doll, never knowing of her unhappiness. Often, he would hearken 
  back to the many conversations and sexual adventures he had shared with Debbie. 
  Then there were times when he would remember fondly her slow emotional shift 
  into a purely sexual being bent on pleasing him in any way possible. He missed 
  those days, occasionally. Nevertheless, had anyone asked if there were any disappointment 
  in what Debbie had become, he would have answered &#8220;No&#8221;. She was, 
  as he often told her, a dream come true.
Debbie, on the other hand, could 
  not have been more miserable during her waking moments, and she became even 
  more determined to catch his attention. For many years she fought sleep, hoping 
  to gain her lover&#8217;s attention. For just as many years, she failed. 
Finally, after waking to see a new 
  years celebration on television, her resolve evaporated. As the New Year rang 
  in, she realized that she had been a doll for nearly ten years. That time could 
  have passed so quickly for her was overwhelming to her.
Later that evening, she caught a 
  glance of her reflected image. Despite having seen her reflection before, she 
  was shocked. She was quick to recall images in wax, strangely realistic but 
  having no life. The eyes of such constructs, she recalled appeared dead, while 
  appearing surprisingly real. There was nothing alive about such things, still, 
  one might be tempted to poke such a figure to see if it were alive or not. 
The opposite was true of her. She 
  appeared strangely surrealistic; a parody of a woman. There was warmth to her 
  &#8220;skin&#8221;, despite its synthetic nature. Likewise, her eyes, if looked 
  into, told of the intelligence and life that remained beneath the manmade exterior. 
  Despite this life, few would ever believe she was a real woman even had they 
  been told. So thorough had been her transformation that even she could hardly 
  believe the reflected image was a real woman.
With that simple sighting of herself, 
  she understood her fate. There was no use in denying it was so, nor was there 
  any sense in continuing to pursue her freedom. She saw this now. This was not 
  acceptance so much as a realization of an unpleasant fact. She was no longer 
  real. She was, now and forever more, a plastic sex-doll.
