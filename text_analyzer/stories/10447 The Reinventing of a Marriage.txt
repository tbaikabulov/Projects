The reinvention of a marriage.&nbsp; Part I



Life was pretty good. It was okay, actually.&nbsp; I was the the thirty something husband to a thirty something wife.&nbsp; Life was ordinary, and fulfilled.&nbsp; I loved her dearly, and she loved me just as much, perhaps even more if that was possible.&nbsp; She was everything I ever wanted.&nbsp; Level headed, fair, even tempered, and beautiful.&nbsp; Though not a model, she had beautiful curves.&nbsp; She was my life.



I, however, was not as good to her as she was to me.&nbsp; And I felt horrible for it.&nbsp; Ever since I was in college, I developed a horrible, horrible masturbation addiction.&nbsp; As technology developed, my addictions grew worse. I could not remove myself from my stimulus, and as such I simply could not give my wife the lovemaking she was giving me.&nbsp; Add to that a job that required travel each week, and my time alone in hotels with my smart phone put our sex life in jeopardy.



This was my marriage, for 10 years.&nbsp; We never disc issued my issues.&nbsp; Ever.&nbsp; In fact she may not have even known how bad it was.&nbsp; But I'm sure she knew I had a problem.&nbsp; So for ten years, my wife was left unsatisfied, and I felt helpless to do anything about it.&nbsp; I feared speaking about it would jeopardize our marriage.



It was these feelings of guilt and shame that caused my masturbation fantasies to turn to cuckolding fantasies and male chastity fantasies.&nbsp; For years, my porn folders on my computers were full of videos of men being humiliated. I dreamed of my wife taking charge, but she was so vanilla in real life we actually stopped having sex for a few months after I tried kissing her feet once.&nbsp; She thought it was gross and too kinky.



So we lived in a rut.&nbsp; Day in, day out.&nbsp; Until that one day in October.



---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------



After a trip I was on was cut short, I flew home early.&nbsp; In a bid to surprise her with my arrival, I drove home without telling her.&nbsp; As you might imagine, as I pulled into the drive way I saw the white pickup truck in the driveway.&nbsp; The telltale sign.&nbsp; I immediately knew what was going on.&nbsp; Surprisingly, I didn't know how to react. On a fantasy level, this is what I always wanted.&nbsp; But on a REAL level I was FURIOUS.&nbsp; I tired up.&nbsp; I was humiliated.&nbsp; Angered.&nbsp; Enraged. I felt HATE.&nbsp; And FEAR.&nbsp; I was confused, but angry and upset.



I parked quietly and let myself in.&nbsp; I made my way upstairs slowly without a sound. As I neared the bedroom door, I heard them.&nbsp; It wasn�t the hot, passionate sex I expected.&nbsp; They were giggling!&nbsp; They were talking quietly.&nbsp; It was lover's talk!!&nbsp; They were "fooling around" like a couple teens dating!&nbsp; I stood there, quietly. I was dumbfounded.&nbsp; Was she in love with another man??!!&nbsp; I tried my best to listen through the door.

I heard them giggle some more.&nbsp; Then moan.&nbsp; Then giggle.&nbsp; I head some light slapping.&nbsp; Then more moaning.&nbsp; It was a playful time for them.&nbsp; I actually felt a little happy, mixed amongst my rage.&nbsp; As it continued, my rage began to turn to humiliation.&nbsp; I began to feel embarrassed that I let this happen.&nbsp; Its like the classic case of the victim feeling it was their fault.&nbsp; Except I wasn't the victim, she was.&nbsp; And it was my fault!

I stood there, blushing.&nbsp; Embarrassed to be myself.&nbsp; I felt ashamed. I started to tear up again. No, I began to full on sob like a baby.&nbsp; I tried my best to muffle my cries.&nbsp; I tried to be quiet so I could hear what was going on.&nbsp; Suddenly, it got quiet.&nbsp; I froze.&nbsp; Were they done?&nbsp; Were they coming to the door.&nbsp; I thought of places to hide.

Then I heard it.&nbsp; I heard the long moan that she does.&nbsp; I heard her take a cock.&nbsp; She quiets down and focuses.&nbsp; She is such a great woman... she makes a lover feel so special.&nbsp; She focuses everything she has on her man.&nbsp; I could see it, without seeing it.&nbsp; He was gently entering her.&nbsp; They were beginning.&nbsp; I was frozen with trepidation.

I heard them begin to grind.&nbsp; Slowly.&nbsp; She likes it slow at first, to readjust to the sensations.&nbsp; Then I heard them pick up the pace.&nbsp; But then I heard something odd.&nbsp; She moaned louder than I have ever heard before!&nbsp; She even yelped a little!&nbsp; She never did that for me!&nbsp; I head him grunting some words, but I couldn�t make out what they were.&nbsp; Until I heard it.&nbsp; He called her a bitch!&nbsp; I have never...&nbsp; But when he did that, I heard her yell "YES!"&nbsp; She never yelled "YES" for me.&nbsp; In fact, she never even whispered "yes"!

I lost focus of my emotions, and listened intently.&nbsp; And I realized something amazing.&nbsp; My wife was cheating on me.&nbsp; She was violating our love, only because I failed her as a husband.&nbsp; And I was hard!&nbsp; I realized I was engorged, larger than I ever felt before.&nbsp; I heard them enter a rhythm.&nbsp; They were not having sex.&nbsp; They were FUCKING.&nbsp; I'm not sure I ever fucked my wife.&nbsp; I only made love to her, and poorly at that.

And hearing my wife get FUCKED made me hard.&nbsp; Very, very hard.&nbsp; My compulsions got the better of me.&nbsp; I reached down into my pants.&nbsp; I was hard, wet, and excited.&nbsp; And I engaged myself, in the most shameful way I ever did.

I heard them get rough.&nbsp; I heard slapping.&nbsp; I heard her pleasure.&nbsp; She was loud.&nbsp; Louder than ever with me.&nbsp; I was so hot.&nbsp; It was so sexy to hear her be satisfied.&nbsp; It was exciting to feel her emotion through a closed door.

They began to climax.&nbsp; She began to yell profanities.&nbsp; I could envision her back arching.&nbsp; I could feel her energy.&nbsp; I heard his grunting.&nbsp; I heard him pull out.&nbsp; And I heard him finish.&nbsp; I could just see everything in my mind.&nbsp; I could see my beautiful wife suddenly become a real, human woman.&nbsp; I could just see in my mind his finishing all over her beautiful body.



And that�s when I finished.&nbsp; And I forgot one thing.&nbsp; I forgot to be quiet.&nbsp; I forgot I was supposed to be invisible.&nbsp; And then I experienced the most powerfully humiliating orgasm of my life.&nbsp; This was the orgasm that changed my life forever.&nbsp; I didn't realize at the time how intense this act would be.&nbsp; And they heard me.



I froze.&nbsp; I didn�t know what to do.&nbsp; I was weak, and indecisive.&nbsp; The door flung open, and the lover stood in the doorway.&nbsp; He held his fist up, as if defending his lover.&nbsp; I saw her.&nbsp; My beautiful wife, a woman with needs, on the bed.&nbsp; Sweaty.&nbsp; Finished.&nbsp; Covering herself as if from an intruder.&nbsp; Oh my God!&nbsp; I was an intruder!



"Mark?"&nbsp; She asked, peering around her lover.



I stood there.&nbsp; Quiet.&nbsp; Speechless.&nbsp; One hand still down my pants.&nbsp; I was so weak.&nbsp; I didn't know how to react.



"Mark?" my wife asked again.



"yes?" I meekly whispered.



"I- Is this your husband?" the lover asked.



My wife, in tears, whispered "yes."



"Mark, I'm so sorry," she quietly mouthed.&nbsp; I still stood there, speechless.



"I think he had a good time," the lover said, with a small smirk, pointing to my crotch.



"Mark??" my wife asked as she sat up and squinted.&nbsp; "Did you just jerk off to us?"



I felt my face go beat red.&nbsp; I could only open my mouth to speak, but no words came out.



"Oh My GOD!" she exclaimed.&nbsp; Suddenly she broke down in tears.&nbsp; "Oh my God" she cried again.&nbsp; Her lover left the door, sat next to her and caressed her.&nbsp; Its what I should have done.&nbsp; Except I just humiliated her beyond anything humanly possible!&nbsp; 



She shook her hear in tears.&nbsp; "Oh my god..." she meekly cried.



And they she leaned over.&nbsp; Into the lover's arms. He looked up, his eyes saying "What the hell, man?"



And that�s when I felt the most erotic, humiliating wave of energy of my life.&nbsp;&nbsp; I have never again felt that kind of electricity in my life.
