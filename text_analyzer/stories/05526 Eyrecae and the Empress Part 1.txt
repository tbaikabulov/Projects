Tamed: Eyrecae and the Empress

&nbsp;

Prologue

&nbsp;

The head office
of the Gold Eagle bank was visited by an average looking Eldorai woman on 32nd
Kislev, IC696. The woman walked through the main entrance, past the large gold
coloured statue of an eagle, and up to the counter. There, a cashier looked up
at her without any interest.

�Can I help
you?� she stated in a flat voice befitting someone who was about to finish
shift for the day.

�Yes, I would
like to make a deposit,� her visitor stated in a clear, slightly accented
voice.

�Name, please?�
the cashier asked. 

�Eyrecae Amianus,� the Eldorai answered, looking around the marble
lobby.

�Ah, yes, it
says you�ve been our customer for�how long?�

Eyrecae coughed. �A long time,� she hazarded.

The other
woman�s eyes widened. �You were a foundation customer-?� she began.

�Yes, yes, don�t
the decades fly by,� Eyrecae said hurriedly. �Can I make the deposit?� she
asked.

�Yes, of course.
How much?�

�Can we go into
the backroom?� Eyrecae asked, looking around.

�Sure. Sulla,
backroom!� the cashier called, and an armed guard came and escorted Eyrecae in.

�This is my
deposit,� Eyrecae said, taking a very heavy package from beneath her tunic. She
placed it on the table; the bundle making a chinking sound. When Sulla unwrapped it, he found it contained golden, embossed disks
about an inch across. There must have been a thousand there. Gold! Not coins so
much as tokens or medals. 

�We�Sulla, watch
her,� the cashier said, fleeing to find the manager.

The manager was
a tall, white haired man with a weak chin and runny eyes like a fried egg. He
looked at the gold in astonishment. �Might I ask how you�acquired this?�

Eyrecae was
ready for that and handed a datapad over, stating the amount of gold, and that
it was authorised by�the manager read it again, this time in disbelief.

�It says that
this document was signed by Empress Calistanae II Philanos
over three hundred and fifty years ago!� he exclaimed.

�So it was. If
you have a problem with me depositing one hundred pounds of gold at your bank,
I am sure that the VCB bank on Broadway will not be so finicky,� Eyrecae said,
gathering up the bundle.

�No! No�forgive
me, var,� the manager said quickly, using an old word
of respect to address her. �We will have to have these valued and-� he began.

�I�ve already
done that. This note is from the headquarters of �Istan
Bullion�. They will give me eighty five Dati for each. So you can give me
better, or I can go there and come back. You�ll lose the gold of course�.�

�You bargain
hard, var Eyrecae,� he said, smiling slightly.

�No point doing
it any other way.� 

�I�ll give you
ninety thousand Dati for them all.�

�Excellent. Put
it into my account,� Eyrecae said, and bowed. �I am sure this will be a long
and productive relationship,� she stated and left the room.

When she was
gone, the manager looked at the gold, which showed a strange design of swirls
and spirals.

�She probably
didn�t realise what these might be worth,� he mused. �Our gain is her loss.
Well done, Karol,� he said to the cashier and left carrying the bundle of gold
pieces.

&nbsp;

Istan Bullion was built under street
level, partly for security, but mostly because of the staff. As Eyrecae walked
in, she knew that every one of them was an Ulharii like her. Unlike her though,
they could not stand the sun, and so hid below ground.

The leader came
from his office and bowed low before Eyrecae. �Askari,
Lady Eyrecae,� he said politely.

�Askari, Riven,� she returned politely, taking his hand.

�Did that quote
come in handy, Lady?� Riven asked.

�Oh yes, they
paid me ninety each.�

�Why did you
want lower than what they are worth?� the male Ulharii asked, puzzled.

�Because, my
dear Riven,� Eyrecae said like he was a child, �I don�t have time to mess
around with antiques dealers. I wanted the gold gone quickly, and this was
perfect.�

�What do you
intend to do with it, Lady Eyrecae?� Riven asked as they moved into his office
and closed the door.

She smiled,
showing her fangs for a second. �Your business makes money, Riven, a lot of it.
But there is one industry that makes the most quickest
and relatively safest. Do you know what that is?�

�Err�assassination?�
Riven guessed.

�You think like
a warrior, but you�re wrong. That is not safe, nor quick, despite the profits.
No; sex. All races desire it to one degree or another. I will cash in on this.�

�You�d sell
yourself?� Riven asked, shocked.

�Afraid I�d find
someone better than you?� she joked. �Yes, I am.�

�Oh�I might come
visit you,� he hazarded.

�We�ll see,
Riven. Thanks for your help,� Eyrecae said and walked out.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Chapter 1

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Eyrecae walked
through the city, getting reacquainted with the planet she had not visited in
several decades. There were new structures, but it was mostly the same, and so
she soon found herself heading to the Suiire Embassy, a long, low building only
a few sectors from the Palace. At the gate she waited as two armed sentries
came and checked her identification.

�Lord Oriva will see you,� one of them stated and led the way
inside. Eyrecae passed guard rooms, data storage and map rooms until she came
to the office of the Ambassador. �Go in, Lady,� the guard ordered and shut the
door behind her.

Oriva was sitting behind his desk, a
middle aged and gaunt man with a distinctive Gaston accent. �Ah, the mighty
Eyrecae returns to us. The Great Emperor Raik�aro was concerned you might have
betrayed us. But I had more faith in you.�

�Your faith
earns my thanks. I have been wandering for some time. Now, I need your advice, Oriva.�

�I will do what
I can for a friend of the Suiire,� the Ambassador said carefully.

�Property. I need to rent or lease a
large business and residence block in a nice part of town. Any
ideas?�

Oriva seemed surprised at the
request. �Might I ask what it is for?�

�I�m setting up a
household, what might be called a high class brothel.�

�Indeed? And you
will be�working in the firm?� Oriva asked, amused.

�Oh yes.�

Oriva laughed. �Then I expect you
will be very popular, Eyrecae. If these people know what is good for them, they
will make you a great success. It seems that one not just gains wisdom with
age�.�

�Very cute,
lizard,� Eyrecae countered happily. �So, got any ideas?�

�I do indeed.
A�friend�of the Suiire has had to vacate his offices in Eighteen North�we were
going to simply sell it, but we may as well hire it to you.�

�Eighteen North is quite a way from the action. And if it is from a
�friend� then can I expect taps, bugs and cameras?�

�Not at all. You have my word that
all will be dealt with. Of course�any whispers that reach your ears�� he
offered.

�I�ll consider
it. And the location?�

�These humans do
nothing right,� Oriva said caustically. �Eighteen North is only two north from here. They can�t even lay out a
grid properly!�

�So I see,�
Eyrecae replied with a shrug. �Price?�

�One twenty Dati
a week, or three hundred Amil�that�s
the going rate of exchange. It needs a lick of paint, of course�.�

What that meant,
Eyrecae knew, was that it was a dump, more or less, but it would do. �Sounds great. Allow me to offer you a month�s rent in
advance,� Eyrecae declared and dropped the last few gold tokens she had onto
the table.

Oriva smiled. �Good doing business
with you. Of course, we shall help if needed with planning.�

�Thank you,�
Eyrecae said, then left the room.

&nbsp;

The next stop
was the planning office for Chaeronea. Eyrecae expected to encounter trouble
here, but found to her surprise, an old friend waiting for her.

�Ramona?�
Eyrecae asked, surprised.

�Just for you,
honey,� Ramona said. She was a plump human in her middle age with dark skin and
a big smile.

�What are you
doing working as a bureaucrat?� Eyrecae asked. �Last time I saw you, you were
an author on that space station before the giant bugs attacked!�

�I considered
that a sign from Ashira that I was not cut out to be
an author. But might I ask what you are doing here?�

�I�ve come to
Chaeronea to set up a, well you might as well know, a high class escort
establishment.�

�A brothel, you
mean?� Ramona asked happily.

�Yes. What are
the laws here�?� she trailed off.

�So long as the
house is registered, there are no disturbances to the community caused by it,
and all staff and clients are screened, there is no issue. But, local community
groups and such can be such prudes. For saving my life from the mutant creepies, I�ll give you permission. Don�t fail my trust.�

Eyrecae smiled
warmly. �I won�t, my dear. Thank you�it means a lot to me.�

�Why?� Ramona
asked as Eyrecae stood.

�Why? Because my
cash was getting rather low, and I�ve not had a good fuck in years,� Eyrecae
said bluntly.

�I like you, to
the point. I�ll drop by one day,� Ramona said, handing the permit over. �Have
fun!�

&nbsp;

Eyrecae, now much
reassured, headed over to the palace and grand parade ground. The massive open
space was larger than ten sports fields. Now, though, it was almost empty, save
for a group about half way along. Guards in black armour surrounded the group,
and numerous courtiers�
trailed behind the party.

�Who is that?�
Eyrecae asked a watching bystander.

�That? That is
the new Empress. You�not listened much to the news?� the man asked wryly.

�Not when I can
help it. Thank you,� Eyrecae said, leaving the amused man alone.

The Ulharii
headed over the tiled open space until she was a mere twenty paces from the
monarch. She looked a tall stern woman with an indomitable expression on her
face. To Eyrecae�s surprise, the Empress turned to her, and started to walk
over! As she made to back away, two guards came up, guns ready.

�Kneel before
her Imperial Majesty!� a man dressed like a Chamberlain ordered.

Eyrecae did so,
but looked up when she heard a chuckle.

�Now I have seen
everything Varnia, Eyrecae kneeling before me,� the Empress said to a woman
beside her.

�Your�Majesty?� Eyrecae asked, puzzled.

�Stand up,
you�re far too good to be bowing and scraping,� the Empress ordered. When that
was done, the monarch eyed her. �As you may have heard, I was elected Empress
last month. Why do I know you? We met, when I was ten. I am sure you do not
remember, but it was because my grandfather, the Elector of Epirus, was
attending a negotiation with Emperor Raik�aro of the Suiire. Regardless, I
remembered you. Perhaps we could meet one time,� she stated.

�I would like
that, your Majesty,� Eyrecae said uncertainly.

�Very well. Thank you for your time,�
Empress Calistanae III said, and walked away.

&nbsp;

Eyrecae had been
surprised by the meeting, and wandered off in a daze, losing her way a few
times before coming to the right place. As she had privately expected, the
building was something of a shambles. Immediately she used the communicator to
summon an army of painters, carpenters, electricians and plumbers. Using her
newly inputted money from the bank, she paid on the spot, giving the workers
generous tips and then looked over the result.

&nbsp;

The building was
quite large, two stories holding a total of fifteen offices - which were being
converted into bedrooms � and several large entertaining areas. It was a start,
and though Eyrecae was down by a quarter of her gold money already, she was
pleased with the result. With the beds arriving the next day, she slept on the
carpet, quickly dropping into a deep sleep.

&nbsp;

The next
morning, Eyrecae was up and on the wire to post advertisements and job offers.
Her superhuman energy paid off when at ten in the morning, there was a knock on
the door.

�Hi, are you
Eyrecae?� the visitor � a blond Eldorai with very ample breasts � asked.

�Yes, what�s
your name, dear?� Eyrecae asked, waving her in.

�I�m Dawn,
that�s my stage name.�

�A very nice
name,� Eyrecae agreed. �Well, you got my invitation. Let me explain things; I�m
setting up this place to provide high class, high paid escorts and companions
to the upper class. Nobles and Lords, that style of thing.
You�ll be paid ten Dati a day base, enough to eat, plus you�ll take sixty
percent of any �meetings� you decide on, plus all the tips. I�ll take the rest,
and you can sleep and eat here, or come in here.�

Dawn looked at
her, surprised. �Wow�that�s�different. I mean, place I
work now I�m lucky to get fifty a day max!� She looked a little suspicious. �Is
this a scam?�

�No, it isn�t.
I�m doing the same thing as you. The money is good because I want good people
to cast good impressions.�

Dawn nodded.
�Okay, I�ll join. When do you want me to start?� 

�Tomorrow, if
you can. I�ll hopefully have something lined up by then.�

�Alright, CYA
then,� Dawn said and walked out.

&nbsp;

Eyrecae was just
making notes when there was another knock at the door. She went to answer it,
and found a young human with red hair waiting.

�Hey, ad said
you were hiring,� she stated.

�Come right in,�
Eyrecae offered.

This time she
didn�t even get a chance to finish talking to the model before another knock on
the door. Then another, and another.

By the time
Eyrecae closed up for the night, she�d interviewed eighteen women and three
men. She�d accepted half of them, and as she lay back on the bed that night, she
wondered where she was going to get enough appointments to satisfy all those
people!

The answer came
to her when she looked at her bed side table and saw an article in it.
Instantly, despite it being thirtieth hour, she made notes and went to sleep
happy. The title of the article read; �Empress� Inauguration Ball.�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Chapter 2

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Eyrecae was up
and ready to go early, indeed, she was up before the sun had risen, making
calls to make this night a success. All was prepared to go by midday, and she
soon had calls from those attending the ball who desired a companion. Many were
married, but had decided to take along an attractive companion as well, while
others were single or on planet alone.

Eyrecae received
a call at one that afternoon from the secretary of a wealthy mining company
owner who wanted her to be his companion that night. Eyrecae organised a
meeting, but had to find someone to run the house while she was away. After a
half hour searching, she found another friend, this one a Takana living with
the Suiire. Eyrecae met her at the door. She�d changed into a revealing green
dress she�d borrowed from one of her employees. 

�Pleased you
could do this for me, Lin�tarith,� the Ulharii said, relieved.

�Pleased I
could,� Raevil, her alter replied. �So, living the high life, are you? I�ll
mind your stuff, but I want you for a night!�

Eyrecae poked
her tongue out, and left the lizard to it.

&nbsp;

�Mr Kavad is
very pleased you could join him,� an elderly manservant greeted Eyrecae at the
door.

�Can I go see
him? I want to make sure that all is arranged to his satisfaction.�

�Come this way,
Lady,� the servant said, seemingly immune to her low cut dress.

Mr Kavad, the
son of a common ore miner, poured Eyrecae a drink when she entered. �Nice dress.
I have a liking for Eldorai.� There were other men in the room, but they seemed
business associates, not the makings of a gangbang

�Thank you, sir.
Are you married, sir?�

�No, I ain�t. I
just want a pretty girl to go with me, I don�t want to
marry them. Not a problem for you?� he demanded.

�Not at all, sir.�

�Is that what
you are wearing tonight?�

�No, sir, something less�risqu�, perhaps?�

�Damn your fancy
words! I�m paying for you to look good, not to cover up like an ice explorer.
Now wear that, but get rid of the bra,� Kavad ordered. 

Eyrecae couldn�t
hide a smirk. �Gratefully. I hate formal dresses.�

�Good for you,�
the big man said with a laugh. �Now, you ain�t too squeamish to get personal
with me, are you?� Kavad asked. He stretched out his arms and flexed a little.

�Not at all,
sir,� Eyrecae replied. 

�Well good. Bedroom upstairs. We�ve got two hours until we leave. I�ll
see if you�re worth a tip. Go on,� he ordered, turning from her and launching
back into business talk. The other men in the room had heard the whole conversation,
and some shared sidelong glances at Eyrecae as she left the room.

�Back to business!� Kavad said,
smacking the table. �Get your own sluts,� he growled and moved back to work.

&nbsp;

When Kavad came
upstairs, he found his companion for the evening ready for him in bed. Not
wanting to pass up the opportunity, and not bothering with words, he stripped
down and got in beside her. He was pleased that she was just as pretty without
the dress as with it, if not more.

�Come on,
bitch,� he said in an affectionate way.

Eyrecae did not
answer, but set to work earning her money, first with her mouth, then her
pussy. By the time she was done, she�d forced out a pair of orgasms from her
client and gotten three of her own.

�You�re pretty
good,� Kavad admitted, standing and heading for the shower.

�I am, aren�t
I?� Eyrecae said to herself as she laid back in bed.
She smirked, he�d been pretty good � over confidant of course � but Eyrecae was
willing to let him think he�d gotten the better of her.

&nbsp;

The outside of
the great Imperial Concert Hall was sheathed in golden light projected by great
emitters at ground level. Eyrecae and Kavad stepped out of their skimmer and
into the crowd of other people waiting for entrance. Eyrecae preened herself as
she saw the admiring looks they were giving her. She knew Kavad liked it too,
for he put an arm around her bare waist to make it certain people knew he was
in control. Eyrecae�s low dress with an extra long slit between the legs was
something few women could have worn, and the dark green did not go with most
people. It suited her though, and she gave pleasant smiles to any who watched.

�You�re not even
wearing panties are you, little slut?� Kavad hissed to her.

�Not a stitch,�
she returned.

�I think this
ball might bore me quickly. I am sure there are some places we could retire
from public.�

�You�re the
master, and I�m your slave,� Eyrecae replied huskily. It always worked, and she
could tell he wanted to bend her over and take her then and there!

He was
distracted from replying by a courtier who bowed before Kavad and asked for
their invitations. He produced them, and allowed into the massive concert
hall�s main room. It was a place where ten thousand chairs could look at the
central stage, but now that space was empty, and the red carpeted floor was
filling with people. On the great stage there was an orchestra and a dais with
the eagle flag above it. At the moment though, it was empty of anyone other
than musicians.

Kavad led
Eyrecae through the room, and he talked to people as he passed, as he evidently
knew several of them well. They took a drink, and then another, for Eyrecae had
an immense ability to drink alcohol, more than almost any mortal she knew.

�When does her
Majesty come on stage?� Kavad was asking a fat nobleman.

�In an hour, once all the Electors are assembled, and the High Priest
is here.

Eyrecae glanced
at Kavad, and he nodded. Eyrecae finished her drink and left the room,
supposedly for the bathrooms. A moment later, in a deserted hall, Kavad joined
her. Somehow he�d acquired a stun baton and two pairs of handcuffs.

�You ain�t
squeamish are you?� he demanded.

�Not at all,
Master. Take me where you want. Where�d you get the gear from?�

�A security
officer who I slipped a month�s worth of his pay to. Stop questioning me,� he
ordered and dragged Eyrecae through the dark halls. He obviously wanted to hear
her worried, but she looked only a little interested as he dragged her into an
unused dressing room and locked the door. �Now strip, slut. I need you looking
presentable for later, but I want you now, and you�re going to be my slave as
you promised.�

Eyrecae nodded
and pulled off her shoes, then undid the dress. She was entirely naked
underneath, and she neatly hung the dress up for later.

Kavad cuffed her
wrists in front of her to a concrete pillar, then her legs so she was helpless
and exposed to him. He in turn stripped and thrust a wad of cloth into her
mouth to gag her. �That stays in,� he growled. Then, taking position behind
her, he seized her legs and thrust his hard cock into her. 

Eyrecae moaned
into the makeshift gag as Kavad rammed into her again and again, almost
knocking her forward several times. What he lacked in subtlety he made up for
in power. After he had pushed himself into her at least fifty times he came,
filling the inside of her pussy with his seed. Eyrecae didn�t care about that,
she was infertile anyway, and her unique abilities meant she was immune to any
disease that might be passed through.

�Good slut,�
Kavad said affectionately. He pulled the wad of cloth from her mouth and made
her lick his member clean. He did not undo her bonds though, except to turn her
so her arms were cuffed behind the pole. The gag was replaced, and Kavad
dressed. �You�ve pleased me a lot, bitch. And you�ve earned a bonus payment.
We�ve got half hour before we have to head back, want to earn some more?�

When Eyrecae
nodded, he produced the shock rod and powered it up. �I�ve not met a girl as
tough as you before. Take five of these and you�ll get a hundred Dati more.
Eyrecae nodded again, and he touched the rod to her left nipple.

The pain was
harsh, but she�s gotten wet to worse. She made a sigh of contentment that
amused her client as he touched it to the other nipple, with the same result.
He tried touching it to Eyrecae�s pussy, and that hurt the Ulharii. She screamed into the gag and wrenched at
her chains.

�Found your
spot, didn�t I?� Kavad said happily. He touched it to that spot again, and saw
the faintest trace of tears prick at her eyes. �You�re tough,
any other girl would have stopped me after the tits. But I�m not a torturer,�
he stated and touched the end to her naval and watched her sigh in relief.

�Let�s get back.
I�ll not forget this though,� he said, unchaining her wrists.

Eyrecae smirked
as they walked back through the dark halls. He was typical of such people, and
she knew that he�d always want her, and so long as he paid, Eyrecae was willing
to have a bit of fun. However, she did want to meet the Empress, and so she
hurried back to where the noise of voices was much louder.

&nbsp;

The orchestra
had been playing incidental music, but now switched to a triumphant sweep, and
the lights dimmed everywhere but the stage. A tall noble walked onto the stage
beneath the eagle flag. �Leaders of the Empire, lords, ladies and citizens,
this is a great day for the galaxy, as it marks the election of a great leader,
a noblewoman of both devotion and courage. Her Imperial
Majesty Calistanae III!�

There was a
thunderous applause and the quick tune of the orchestra became a triumphant overture.

The Empress,
dressed in a light blue and silver dress walked slowly onto the stage. She
looked regal, powerful and commanding. Her long brown hair and soft grey eyes
made her seem younger than she was, and she was barely forty years old now.

�Leaders of the Empire. I stand
before you for the first time as your Empress. Know that it is not a light
burden, nor one that I will fail in. You have looked past some of my well known
eccentricities to the woman I am. I will not fail this Empire. No, I will see
that Erisae�s dream continues on in this era. For while we might have enemies,
they are not any we cannot resist if we put our minds to it!�

The speech went
on for some time more, but Eyrecae didn�t pay much heed to it. She�d heard a
dozen speeches by Emperors saying the same things. She concentrated on the
Empress though, and sensed the aura around her. She was almost certainly a
Sciian. Not a strong one perhaps, but strong enough in the manner of an
untrained human.

�And so,� the
Empress said, wrapping up her speech, �In danger and hardship there is unity!
And together you and I will steer this Empire from greatness to the heights of
glory!� she called.

There was an
almighty applause, as the Empress looked down on them all. Then, to the
surprise of some, she walked down the stairs and into the crowd to talk more
with the rulers who had helped her get this position of power.

&nbsp;

To Eyrecae�s
surprise, Calistanae saw her and headed over! She ignored barons and dukes,
nobles and leaders until she came before the Ulharii. Unfriendly,
and disapproving eyes looked on Eyrecae and her dress as the Empress nodded
slightly.

Eyrecae knelt.
She didn�t know why, but she figured it couldn�t hurt.

�Rise up,
Eyrecae Amianus,� the Empress commanded. When that
was done she looked at those around her. �Leave us a moment in private,� she
ordered.

�Your Majesty,
she-� a courtier attempted.

�If Eyrecae
wanted me dead, Gareth, I would be by now, and nothing you could do could
prevent it. Leave us.� The watchers left them resentfully in peace. The nobles
to a person believed they deserved greater attention than some half dressed
harlot.

�Your Majesty is
kind,� Eyrecae said respectfully.

�About what? I know what you can do,
and I know I do not have to fear you. And call me Lord, I command you to.�

�Yes, Lord,�
Eyrecae replied obediently.

�Good. Now, you
are here with Mr Kavad? That means he hired you as I know he is not married. Is
someone so powerful and beautiful being hired to such a man?�

�Yes, I am.� She
felt a tiny bit ashamed, but pushed it aside. 

�It is not
tactful, but I am Empress, so I do not need tact. How much?�

�Four hundred
Dati a night, Lord,� Eyrecae said, a little red.

�My dear, you
are wasted!� Calistanae unexpectedly changed subjects then. �As you are aware,
my wife and I have now moved into the Crystalline Palace, now I have been
crowned. Among the things that came up is something you already know. I am a
Sciian, but there was not the time or will to train me as a Shadow Knight. My
father, bless his spirit, believed it was demeaning for a noble. But I would
like to learn, if I can, and I can think of no more suitable teacher than you.�

Eyrecae was
taken aback. �Me? But, but, surely there are others better trained to teach? I
mean, no offence, but why choose me?�

Calistanae gave
her a knowing look. �Cover story. That and because I
have great faith in your abilities.�

�Cover story?�

�Well it would
hardly do to have your description on the pay-books as �Chief Love Slave�, now
would it?�

The Ulharii was
speechless again, which was a rare feat. �You�want me?�

�Well either you
are surprised that the Empress would ask a heathen, immortal vampire, or you
think that I am out of your league. I�m assuming the former.�

�Yes. Why me?�

�Why not you?�
the Empress chuckled. �Every person in this room, if they were honest with
themselves, would want you as their slave, either because they are jealous of
you, or because they think you are the ultimate unobtainable. However, let us
be blunt, you are beautiful, immortal and dangerous, and I like that. I�d like
it even more if I had you naked in front of me begging to please me!�

�You certainly
surprise me, Lord.�

�As I said, an
Empress does not need tact. So, will you join me? I will pay you five times
what Kavad does, and you will live in my wing of the palace, be allowed out
three days a week, and my slave the rest.�

�I will try it.
But won�t you be busy�running the Empire?� Eyrecae hazarded.

�Of course, and
that makes the night all the more exciting. But my wife and my two slavers will
have plenty to keep you disciplined. But yes, come by for a day next week. How about fourth day?�

�That will be
fine, Mistress,� Eyrecae said with a smile.

�Good. I like
you calling me that, do so from now on in private. Don�t worry,
I won�t hurt you more than you enjoy, and I won�t make you do something you
fear. This is supposed to be fun for both of us after all!�

�Thank you,
Mistress!� Eyrecae said.

&nbsp;

The Empress
walked away, and Kavad came over with a grim smile. �She�s out bought me,
hasn�t she?� He saw her surprise. �Look, I might not have gone to a fancy
school, but I ain�t stupid.�

�She�s only
hiring me for business,� Eyrecae protested weakly.

�And I am a
three headed cow. I don�t mind, but you were a good slut.�

�I have other
staff who might assist you.�

�I�ll see. Now, good night to you.� Kavad strode away.

After a few
moments alone, another woman came over to Eyrecae. �I trust you agreed with my
wife?� she asked.

�You�re Varnia?�
Eyrecae asked.

�I am indeed.�
Varnia was younger than the Empress, maybe as much as fifteen. �I just wanted
to reassure you about this�arrangement. It is something we both thought about
and decided when we saw you in the square. If you come to live with us, it will
not be acting, it will be real. There will be no games or equality. You have
your days off for that, or the times when my wife needs your help.�

�I understand.�

�Then I will see you soon, pet,� Varnia whispered and walked away.

&nbsp;

Eyrecae returned
home to find Raevil with a young human girl of only twenty or so in her arms.
It was one of the girls that Eyrecae has hired.

�I hope you�re
going to pay,� she commented.

The human girl
blushed and covered herself, but Raevil looked amused rather than alarmed. �Of
course I�m going to. Young Jade here and I were having some fun, weren�t we
dear?�

�Yes�we were,�
Jade said with a blush.

�Well, that�s
fine. Thanks for minding the fort while I was away, Raevil.�

�Not a problem
honey. Jade, dear, I won�t be long,� she told the human, and went outside with
Eyrecae. �So, have a good night?�

The Ulharii
frowned. �I guess so, I�m getting to be the Empress�
pet.�

�You�re
kidding.�

�No, not at all.�

Raevil looked
amazed, and not a little jealous. �That�ll be right. Still, it�s not like I
could do it.�

�Well, it�s not
just for the pleasure of being some human�s slave, I�m
getting two thousand Dati a day.�

�So the Empire
has enough to pay you half a million a year, but not enough to evacuate people
from an incoming comet? That sounds right. Well, good luck. You do get days off
I guess?�

�Three a week. The other seven are my
slave days. Oh, and I�m training her to fight too.�

�Drop by and see
me whenever you want. You can usually find me at the Suiire Embassy, or someone
will know where to find me.�

&nbsp;

Chapter 3

&nbsp;

Eyrecae walked
onto the forecourt of the palace. Ahead was an energy bubble that protected the
palace from anything trying to sneak in. The only ways
in were specially created entrances that were usually sealed off with the same
energy fields. These force fields were almost
invisible to the naked eye, but could stop a tank at full speed dead.

She handed a
pass to the guard captain who looked at it with surprise, then saluted. �This
way, my Lady,� he said, leading her past the queue of supplicants, and towards
a side entrance.

Between the
force field�s edges was nearly a mile of the palace grounds, with gardens,
fountains and plazas. The palace was a self contained city, with many people in
it never leaving the place between birth and death. Servants, officials and
nobles all mixed in the busy halls. However, the front wing of the palace � the
largest � where the business of running the Empire was performed was not where
Eyrecae was led. She was instead taken through a long tunnel and on for almost
half a mile until she reached the rearmost of the palace buildings. It was
where the Empress lived, and which was private to all but a few dozen guards
and special guests.

Apparently the
Ulharii was included in this, but the guard wasn�t, for the guard saluted and
turned away. Wondering what to do, Eyrecae was confronted by two Eldorai women
in modern plated battle armour and the aura of trained Sciians.

�You are
Eyrecae?� one of them asked, not unkindly.

�I am. Are you
the Angelii?�

They nodded. The
elite bodyguards of the Emperor were Eldorai raised
from birth as Sciians and warriors, and were deemed incorruptible. �Please
follow us. Her Highness is awaiting you inside the garden.�

Eyrecae fell
into step behind one, while another brought up the rear. They passed through
great halls and rooms until they came to a large sun room and greenhouse. The
Empress was sitting on a plain, but large chair. Beside her was her wife, and
at her feet was a woman attached by a leash to the chair. The girl was naked
and looked down at the tiles, and never up.

�Welcome,
Eyrecae Amianus. I�m glad you took up my offer of a
trial! Angels of Wrath, please leave us and be ready
for orders.�

�As you command,
Highness,� the two said as one and left the room.

�They are
beautiful, are they not?� Calistanae asked, standing from her informal throne.

�They are, Lord.
Do you ever feel tempted to�� Eyrecae replied before
colouring at having asked such a question.

�More than tempted. They are my
bodyguards, and what better way to make them mine than to let them pleasure me?
My love, take her to the dungeons and secure her,� she ordered her wife.

Varnia unlocked
the naked pet from the throne and pulled her away. Eyrecae noticed the pet had
many scars from being caned or whipped on her back.

�I did not cause
those scars, in case you are wondering. Her former Master would drink and beat
her, one time he went too far and blinded the girl by hitting her head. Now she
is my pet, but I do not beat her.� She walked with Eyrecae to the window that
looked out over the city. �All the windows in this palace are one sided, and no
one is allowed in this building where we stand without one of the passes you
bore. Keep it, you will need it each time you wish to
enter. Now, before we go any further, you will promise, no you will swear that
not one thing about what happens in
the palace will leave this force field.�

Eyrecae nodded.
�I promise. You have my solemn word.�

�Even to your
Suiire friends to laugh at me or my ways,� the Empress warned.

�Not even to
them, I promise.�

�Then all is
well. I know a little of your abilities, but not all by any means. What can I
do to you?�

�It is not so
much what you can do as what I enjoy. If you know anything about me, or read
the Dark Star stories, you know I regenerate injuries in seconds, be they a
paper cut or a mangled leg. And while you could cut me open and pull out my
heart, I would ask you not to,� she said with a smile. But I am not someone who
gets aroused by torture, proper torture, the sort with racks, knives and molten
lead.�

�I would never
do anything so beastly to you, or anyone who was not a traitor and a criminal.
My interest is more in domination, making you be my slave, and making you
pleasure me. Though as I said at the ball, I will be busy often, by my wife and
the two Angelii you saw before will be your Mistresses
when I am not there. They will know your limits, and will push rather than
break them. Should you wish, when you are settled, we will do three weeks on
and one off, should you wish it. That allows greater emersion in the game.�

�It sounds like
you know a lot about this.�

�All my life
while my father was alive I was useless. So I was given servants to play with
and amuse me while he worked. I chose women because that is who I desire to
make love to, and so I had almost ten years experience perfecting and learning.
Then I became Elector, and now Empress, but my interests remain. You think me
unusual?�

�No, how many
Emperors have done the same?�

�All, but they
were lusting for women, there has never been a married Erosae
on this throne before, but I will gladly be the first.�

�When do we
begin, Mistress?�

Calistanae
smiled. �Now if you wish. I will order the Angelii to �arrest� you. You will be
taken to my special dungeon where I will �interrogate� you later. Understand?�

�Very much so.� Eyrecae smiled, this
was going to be fun!

&nbsp;

�Angels of Guard! Your Empress needs
you!� Calistanae called once she was seated on her throne, and Eyrecae was
before her. The two Eldorai appeared as if by magic between Eyrecae and their
Mistress. �This vile bloodsucker seeks to drain me blue!� she cried.
�Take her to the dungeons, and I will question her myself soon.�

Eyrecae did not
intend to resist much, there wasn�t much point, but she wouldn�t make things
too easy for the bodyguards. However, she soon found that against those two
with their decades of merciless training and powered body armour, she would be
matched even at full strength. She fought them briefly, but their mechanically
enhanced strength overcame the small effort she put into resistance, and she
was seized.

One of the
Angelii kicked her legs out from beneath her and knelt hard on her back and
neck while her comrade forced a nullifier on, and then attached cuffs joined to
each other directly, and not by a chain.

�Take her away!�
the Empress shouted gleefully.

The two guards
grabbed Eyrecae under her armpits and dragged her from the room. The Ulharii
was quite helpless to resist, as any point she got a chance to lash out with
her legs, one of the two zapped her with a shocker built into her gauntlet. And
so, despite her mad struggling, Eyrecae was dragged through the abandoned halls
until she came to a set of stairs.

While one of the
Angelii rammed Eyrecae into the wall, her companion unlocked a door and dragged
their prisoner inside with them.

&nbsp;

The dungeon
revealed was a large, dark room with no windows. Cells lined a corridor across
the room from the door. In the main area of the room though there was an array
of devices for restraint and pain. It was true they were not proper instruments
of torture, but they still looked foreboding.

Eyrecae was
dragged to one device and was forced onto it. She had always prided herself for
never being forced into something, but all her struggles were quite useless as
a heavy gauntlet choked her and made her be still. The
other guard took several hard kicks before one leg and then the other was
securely chained to the device.

That device
looked like half a wide wheel with the rounded edge up. Eyrecae was forced to
lie on the top so that her back was arched uncomfortably to conform with the circular edge. Her head hung down over the other
side, and after seizing her arms, the Angelii shackled her wrists so she was
being stretched face up over the rounded top of the device.

�It is wise not
to struggle so much when we will be your punishers,� one of the Eldorai said
softly.

�The Empress
will doubtless let us be avenged for those kicks you gave my sister,� the other
said.

Eyrecae was a
little afraid, as she found to her dismay that the chains were too strong even
for her to break. �You�re sisters?� she asked to keep herself distracted.

�Not by blood,
but in spirit,� one of the guards replied. They drew long, sharp knives but
when Eyrecae�s eyes widened, she shook her head. �We will only take your
clothes. You will have no need of them in our care.� With that she cut and
pulled Eyrecae�s clothes off so she was left naked.

�Might I know
your names?�

The two shared a
glance. �It is permitted,� they said as one. �I am Aeothir, and this is my
sword-sister Tasaril. Though when you wear the collar Highness will bring for
you, you will call us Mistress, or you will be punished.�

�You�ve been
doing this for a long time?�

�We have trained
to be Angelii for longer than Highness has been alive.�

�And do you
enjoy playing with the Empress� pets?� Eyrecae asked, trying to find some
weakness in her restraints.

�We do not play
unless Highness commands us to. Now, be silent, or we will gag you. Highness
approaches.�

&nbsp;

Empress
Calistanae strode into the dungeon followed by Varnia. The Angelii knelt before
her, and she allowed them to kiss her hand before telling them to rise.

�You have
restrained the prisoner well. You used the special chains as I ordered?�

Yes, Highness.
This prisoner will not escape,� Tasaril promised.

�Good.� The
Empress walked to where Eyrecae lay with her head back and down. �You were
caught entering my palace. What evil business brought you there?� she demanded.

Eyrecae gave a
defiant look. �Where I go is my own business!� she stated. Now the game had
started, she had best play as well as she could.

�Is that so,
slut bitch? I am the Empress here, I command you to tell me!�

�You are not my
Empress. I will not call you Mistress,� she said disdainfully.

�We shall see.
Angels of Punishment�whip her.�

The first lash
struck Eyrecae�s right nipple with a crack. She cried aloud, for it hurt a lot,
and yanked on her chains. It was no use. Six more whip strokes, each guided by
the iron muscles of the Angelii smacked into her helpless body.

�Enough!�
Calistanae called and towered over Eyrecae. �What were you doing in the
palace?� she demanded. She seized a nipple in sharp fingernails and squeezed
until her captive gasped an answer.

�Spying!� Eyrecae burst out. She
hadn�t meant to, but one whip blow near her pussy had really hurt and
distracted her.

�Ah. We get the
truth already? Spying on all my secrets were you? Were you?� she asked again
when Eyrecae didn�t answer and nodded to Aeothir, who slashed the whip down
again.

�Yes!�

�Yes, what? What do you call me?�
Calistanae asked, running her hand down Eyrecae�s exposed, helpless body.
Eyrecae remained obstinately silent, the caress turned into a slap, a hard one.
�Whip her until she answers, even if it takes an hour, my Angels.�

Eyrecae
struggled madly, but was unable to escape. She tried to endure, but even for
her the two whips were too much, especially when they switched to her genitals.
That pain was too much, and she screamed aloud. �Mistress!�

�Stop!� the
Empress ordered the Angelii. �I�m not sure I heard you. What did you say?�

�Mistress! Please, it hurts,
Mistress!�

�Punishment is
supposed to hurt!� the Empress retorted. She grabbed Eyrecae�s throat and
forced her head up. �Look at me! Who is your Mistress?� Eyrecae didn�t answer,
and Calistanae grabbed one of her pointed ears and pulled her head painfully
up. �Who?!� she shouted.

�You are!�
Eyrecae said desperately. Her ear really
protested such treatment, and so again she�d blurted out something she�d not
meant to.

The Empress let
her prisoner�s head fall. �I am the Empress of this great Empire. All within
its borders are my subjects; and especially those in my home. I thereby
pronounce upon you a judgement of servitude. You will remain my slave until I
declare you redeemed. Until then you remain here until you show you are fit for
another room. I have spoken.�

Eyrecae wanted
to say something sarcastic, but she didn�t. Although this was a game, there
were rules.

�Angels, take
her to her cell and ensure she does not escape. Punish her as you wish, but
return to me within half hour.�

�Yes, Highness,�
the said as one.

�Make her wear
this,� the Empress ordered, taking a collar from her wife and handing it over.

�We obey,
Highness,� the Angelii ordered and knelt until the Empress had gone.

&nbsp;

When the three
women were alone, they undid Eyrecae�s legs, but immediately chained them
together again with a very short chain that made any walking difficult. Then
they undid one hand and the two forced it with some resistance behind Eyrecae�s
back and connected it to a pair of cuffs connected to the leg restraints. It
was repeated with the other hand, and they had soon forced Eyrecae to stand
naked, hands chained behind her back and linked to her restrained legs.

�Hold her,
sister,� Aeothir ordered, and Tasaril pinioned her with her armoured strength.
Aeothir removed the nullifier and slipped on the collar and locked it about
Eyrecae�s neck. The effect was the same, but this collar was more ornate, and
could have a leash attached to it.

Eyrecae
scrabbled with her bound hands at her armoured captor behind, but she could
feel only metal as she was dragged forward. Unable to walk fast, she had her
guards put their arms under her shoulders and drag her backwards from the
dungeon to a cell. They opened the door, and while Aeothir held the Ulharii, her sister locked the gate behind them.

The cell was
quite large and airy, with two bright shafts of light coming through round
holes half a foot wide, and ten foot up. There was a soft mattress on the
floor, a clean toilet and wash basin, but nothing else. The walls of the cell
were thick stone on three sides, and barred on the passageway side by metal
rods. 

Eyrecae was
pushed onto the mattress, and her two guards towered over her. �Highness says
we may punish you,� Tasaril said pleasantly.

Eyrecae could
not have resisted if she wanted, chained as she was. �Mistress, I�m sure we can
work out an arrangement,� she replied.

Aeothir smiled
unpleasantly. �I am sure we can, slave. How about, you pleasure each of us, and
we tell Highness you have been good?�

�I agree,
Mistress,� Eyrecae said, wondering when and if she�d get an orgasm for herself.
Her body was already pulsing, but the way she was bound there was no easy way
to please herself.

&nbsp;

Tasaril held
Eyrecae down while her sister pressed a button and spoke a word of command. The
light in the armour died, and it detached from her like it was some machine
disengaged. In seconds the Eldorai was naked, for she wore nothing beneath the
armour.

Eyrecae was
dragged to her knees and her face was forced close to Aeothir�s waiting pussy.

�You promise you
will not bite?� Tasaril whispered to Eyrecae seriously. Only when the Ulharii had nodded, did she let her please her
sword-sister.

Eyrecae knew how
to do many things, and one of them she knew best was how to pleasure an Eldorai
woman with just her tongue. In over a thousand years it was something she had
done more often than these two youngsters had seen seasons. It was hard to make
an Eldorai release quickly, and she did not try, but steadily increased the
pleasure she gave until the blond Angelii was grinding her hips in silent ecstasy
before she let out a sigh and relaxed.

Tasaril held
Eyrecae still while Aeothir washed herself and redressed in her armour. Then
they swapped roles, though why they paid such attention to keeping Eyrecae still
was unknown, as the Ulharii could hardly fight or
move while chained as she was!

Tasaril, her
long black hair forming a pillow under her head, took even less time than her sword-sister to come. Probably she had already
been aroused by watching Aeothir, and so it took only a few moments for her to
sigh and relax.

�Sister�we must
return to Highness,� Aeothir said with regret.

�Agreed.� She washed and dressed in
her armour. �You are a good slave. Keep this up, and you will not need to be
punished much.�

&nbsp;

The two left
with barely a sound except for the click as the door locked. By the look of the
light, it was afternoon outside, for the sun was not passing through the shaft
directly. Eyrecae lay on the mattress and tried to struggle free. It was
hopeless, and she knew it, but the worst part was how arousing it was without
having a way to relieve it. Even rolling over was hard, but fortunately it was
not a hogtie, and she could sit up with difficulty.

Standing was
much harder, and relied on her leaning on the wall to help her stand. When she
was up, she took a few steps without much difficulty. She couldn�t move fast or
dexterously, but she could move around her cell well enough.

Time passed
slowly, and Eyrecae slept for a few hours, because the cell was almost entirely
dark when she awoke. There were steps coming, and the lights in the hall and in
her cell came on.

It was Tasaril
with a plastic plate in one hand, and a bowl in the other. She opened a slot in
the barred cell door and pushed them through. �Eat, pet. Highness is coming to
see you soon.�

Eyrecae went on
her knees to her dinner and slumped down by it. There was no cutlery of course,
but there was water in the bowl, and cut up meat and vegetables on the plate.
The food was hot and very tasty, and Eyrecae was pleased by it.

In all, she
believed, it had not been at all bad so far. Of course, this was a trial period,
and the chains she had on were very uncomfortable, but the money was good, and
her mistresses were pretty.

&nbsp;

The tramp of
boots outside made her look up to see the Empress, Varnia, and the two Angelii
come into view. The guards entered first and hauled Eyrecae to her feet and
pinned her in place.

Calistanae
smiled at Eyrecae and casually fingered her new slave�s slit. �I think that my
pet is enjoying this imprisonment. She�s moaning enough,� she said to Varnia.
�Eyrecae, out of play, are you enjoying yourself so far?�

Eyrecae
considered, and then nodded. �I am, Lord. Though these chains
are a little hard to live in.�

�They are a test
of your stamina. You won�t always be in this cell, but you will be tonight, if
you choose to be my slave.�

�I agree, and
you are paying me well.�

�I am. I hear
you pleased my Angels? That is wise, for they are your jailors, and they decide
your punishment when I or my wife are not present. If you are a good slave for
a week, I will allow you some more freedoms.� She paused a moment. �I wonder if
you will agree to my idea to wear something that made you mine even when you
are away from here.

�What did you
have in mind?� Eyrecae asked cautiously.

�While you are
my slave in this palace you will wear my collar and the wrist and ankle cuffs I
choose. Apart from these and your restraints you will wear nothing, you are my
slave, and you need no clothes to do that. When you are outside my walls
though, I would have you wear this.� She held up a silver ring with a closable
opening. �With this on your ankle, you will remember you are my slave,� she
stated.

Eyrecae
considered, but finally nodded. She could always take it off in private. �I
accept.�

�Good. Now,
sleep, pet. And just so you try nothing silly. Angels!�

Eyrecae was
seized in her two captor�s vice like grips. Varnia
approached with a metal band like creation. The Ulharii
knew it was a chastity belt, and although she fought to get away, they
eventually sealed it on her. It ran around her waist, soft on the skin from
soft padding, but with a steel core. Between her legs a padded metal strap ran
up and was sealed by a complex integral lock below her naval.

�Now you will
only orgasm when I allow you. Come, Angels, escort my wife and I to our bed.
Slave, don�t go anywhere�we will return for you�soon.�

&nbsp;

Eyrecae lay in
the dark for a moment, then struggled with all her
strength at the chains. Although she felt a bit of give, it was not enough to
free herself, and she was in a bad position to do so as it was.

Giving up, she
slithered to the mattress and lay on it, defeated. She tried to rub against the
mattress with her pussy, but it was useless. The belt was too well set to
defeat, and so she slumped onto the soft mattress and slept.

&nbsp;

Chapter 4

&nbsp;

Eyrecae awoke
with the first light coming through the light holes in the roof. She was stiff
from the position of her arms, but she was in a better condition than a normal
person would be.

As if on cue,
there was the tramp of feet, and the two Angelii appeared. Tasaril unlocked the
prison, then locked it behind her them. Aeothir was carrying a small bag over
her shoulder.

�Slept well,
slave?� Aeothir asked, walking over while her sword-sister went to the other
side.

�Yes, Mistress,�
Eyrecae said with a yawn.

�Highness wants
you.�

The two seized
Eyrecae and pulled her up to her feet. While Tasaril held her still, Aeothir
opened her bag and drew out long coils of grey rope. With this they tightly
bound Eyrecae�s wrists, elbows and breasts win tight knots. Then attaching
ropes to the chastity belt, and winding some around her upper body, Eyrecae was
bound harder and tighter than with the chains. Her leg manacles remained, but
her wrist cuffs and their joining chain was removed.

�Come,� Tasaril
ordered, attaching a leash to the collar and pulling Eyrecae away.

&nbsp;

The Empress was
sitting at a table dressed in a fine silk robe, her
wife sitting beside her, while at her feet was yet another naked and bound
slave.

How many does she have?, Eyrecae wondered in amazement. That slave was licking her Mistress�
leg lasciviously.

�Ah, Eyrecae. Good morning.�

�Morning, Lord.�

Calistanae
looked at her sternly. �No. Angels, punish her.�

Tasaril held
Eyrecae still while her sword-sister used her shock gauntlet to deliver jolts
into their captive.

When Eyrecae had
been zapped the third time and was struggling desperately, the Empress held up
her hand. �I am not Lord now. You are helpless, your body is mine to take and control.
What am I?�

�You are my
Mistress,� Eyrecae admitted. The Empress had to be humoured, as she was paying
her the massive sum each day.

�Good. I sense
that you are stubborn and free willed still. That will not continue. Though I
like your spirit, I do like nice tame girls like Sapphire here.� She caressed
the human who was licking her. �You have to be broken in. Today my wife will
supervise your punishment. Tomorrow you will train me as a Sciian, and it will
be a day where you are not owned by me. The day after you are
free to do as you wish outside the palace. When you return though to
this building, you must wear my collar again, or our arrangement is ended.�

Eyrecae nodded.
�What am I being punished for, Mistress?�

�For asking
questions you have no right to know the answer of,� Calistanae said with a
wicked smirk.

There was
silence, and Eyrecae tried to think of a question or comment that would sate
her curiosity. �Mistress, will I meet your other slaves?�

�Oh yes. You
will meet them very soon, and very personally. Angels of Justice, take her to
the dungeons, and do not allow her to come until my wife says she deserves it.
Make her scream!�

&nbsp;

Varnia rose and
pointed back the way they had come, and soon Eyrecae was being dragged away.
She fought, but bound as she was, there was nothing she could do. If she was
honest, Eyrecae was a little worried about just how much they would think her
capable of. She could regenerate mortal wounds in seconds, of course, but that
didn�t mean she didn�t feel pain.

�Do I get a safe
word?� she asked as she was dragged down the stairs to the dungeon.

At first there
was no answer, but once they were in the dungeon, Tasaril answered. �You will
use the word galith,�
she decided. It meant �moon� in Eldarai.�

�Yes, Mistress,�
Eyrecae decided.

The Angelii
dragged her to a clear area, and Aeothir held her still while her sword-sister
went to use some wall mounted controls.

�I�m not sure
why you are so paranoid about me escaping. After all, I�m being paid to do
this,� she grumbled.

Aeothir clenched
her gauntlet over her captive�s left breast and sent a jolt of agony down it.

Eyrecae screamed
at the pain and fought, but the Angelii simply pushed her to the floor and put
a heavy boot on her neck.

The sound of
clanks and chinks could be heard, but the boot forced Eyrecae�s gaze away from
the fun being prepared for her. Then, suddenly, she was lifted, head and foot
across the floor and laid face down. One of the guards held her while another
snapped a chain onto her right ankle. Then her legs were unchained and a
separate cuff to her left ankle. The two cuffs were not joined, but spread her
legs out in an inverted V shape.

Eyrecae was
pulled to her feet, but she found it hard to balance with her arms still bound.
Therein was a quandary for the guards, for to release her hands would make her
able to fight back.

�I�m not going
to resist,� she said wearily. �Just so you decide you need a sedative or
something.�

The two Eldorai
did not answer, but did hear her, for they untied her, while they readied her
arm restraints. One for each wrist, making her appear in profile to be an X
shape, with wrists and ankles spread wide.

�Thank you,�
Tasaril whispered softly as she tied a tight blindfold in place.

�Anything for
two such sexy Mistresses,� Eyrecae whispered back.

She didn�t get
punished, for she guessed they enjoyed the compliment. Still, she felt horribly
vulnerable, and even more so when the chastity belt was removed to leave her
totally naked.

&nbsp;

The door behind
her opened, and the sound of footsteps came towards Eyrecae.

�Mistress, we
welcome you,� the Angelii said as one.

�Arise, Angels,�
Varnia said and walked until she stood behind Eyrecae. �By my reckoning it is
ten in the morning. That means we have at least seven hours to play. Won�t that
be nice?� she whispered in Eyrecae�s pointed ear. Her hand quested down to her
captive�s exposed and clean shaved pussy. Her fingers were gentle, and no woman
could resist being aroused by the soft probing. 

�I do believe I
asked you a question, slave.�

�If you say it
will be nice, Mistress,� came the distracted reply.

�Oh, for me it
will be. For you�we shall see.� Her hands left Eyrecae�s body and there was
silence. �My wife is a great one at breaking even haughty slaves like you, my
darling,� Varnia said after a moment. �We are going to hurt you. A lot.� It was a statement of fact, not even a threat. �We
will obey your safe word, but we shall expect you to repay our kindness.�

Eyrecae was more
than a little tense. She tested the chains, but they felt too strong to break.
She guessed she�d test them to the utmost before the seven hours of pain had
passed.

&nbsp;

�Whip her back
and ass,� Varnia ordered.

There was a
tense silence, and then the first whip, much harsher than the one the day
before, slashed home. Eyrecae struggled, biting back a cry.

�So it is
true�you do heal so fast that we are left to wonder,� Varnia mused. �Harder, Angels! We must make her wish she never had this
gift.�

�Wait, no!�
Eyrecae shouted desperately.

�A problem, slave? Why have you not
addressed me correctly?�

�I don�t want-,�
she began. 

One gauntlet
yanked her white hair back and held her mouth open while the other shoved a gag
in. A wad of cloth was shoved in and harsh tape covered her lips so barely any
sound could emerge.

�What you want is
irrelevant. Whip her!� Varnia shouted.

Eyrecae tried
not to cry, but it was hard. Trapped by the chains, she could only bite on the
gag. Her fangs pierced it and cut into her lower gums, but this was a
distraction from the whipping. Ten, twenty, thirty strokes, tireless and sharp
sliced home on her, and she screamed into the gag, stamped her foot and
wrenched with all her strength.

Nothing she
could do could end it, but she could hear in between cracks a moaning sound.
Eyrecae guessed it was Varnia pleasing herself by watching her captive�s
torment. A final sigh was what finally stopped the beating. �Enough, Angels,�
Varnia said hoarsely. 

Eyrecae�s back
and ass were covered in a sheen of blood, but the
wounds were already healed. It hurt, but the pain faded only a little slower
than the wounds.

�You are tough,
little slave�and so adorable to see screaming. But this wasn�t testing you, was
it? Be honest.�

Eyrecae was
trapped. If she admitted it was easy then they�d do something far more painful,
but if she said it was hard she�d be lying, and probably punished anyway. She
shook her head.

�Good
slut�honest slut�and what�s this?� she asked, her finger caressing Eyrecae�s
pussy. It was wet, almost dripping. �You little slut.
You enjoyed a whipping that would have sent most people into a screaming
wreck!�

Eyrecae couldn�t
answer, and so stayed silent. She felt aroused now, as she always did when she
was hurt that way. 

Varnia chuckled
in a cruel way and her hands left Eyrecae again. �Well, that didn�t take more than
half hour. What shall we do next? Ah yes. Tasaril, get the braziers and the
branding irons.�

Eyrecae�s eyes
in the blindfold widened and she shook her head desperately. She clicked her
fingers, but she could here the clink of a metal object being set down, and the
heat on her front as it was lit.

�You know the
marks will not stay, slave. So what are you complaining about?� Varnia asked in
the tone of a stern mother.

Eyrecae wanted
to say �I don�t know, perhaps it�s the intense agony?�, but she was fortunately
gagged. She shook her head again.

�What�s this,
the great Dark Star can�t even handle a little touch of heat? I�m not going to
do it on anywhere too sensitive,� she added.

Unable to
resist, but with her pride aroused to the challenge, Eyrecae accepted and
nodded.

&nbsp;

She could only
feel the heat of the metal as it neared her, and though she struggled, she
could not escape. The burning iron touched her. Instantly she sagged and her
breath caught. Then Eyrecae screamed a sobbing cry of agony only partly held by
the gag. The smell of burnt flesh filled the air, but already the pain on her
ass was lessening slowly. Burns hurt for longer than other wounds, and it was a
minute before she could stand properly.

�That wasn�t so
terrible, was it?� Varnia said behind her. Now, we�re going to play a nice
game. It�s called �a rock and a hard place�. Would you rather ten whip strokes
or one touch of the brand? Look left for the first,
and right for the second.�

Eyrecae quickly
looked left, hoping it wasn�t a trick.

�So be it. Whip
her inside thighs.�

The Ulharii knew how much it would hurt, but even that didn�t
prepare her for the stinging as five whip cuts to each thigh cut into her.

�Enjoy that? I
did,� Varnia informed her. �I�m almost ready for my dear Angels to pleasure me.
Not quite yet though. I wonder how you�ll take a brand to the nipple?�

Eyrecae wrenched
at her bonds and shook her head.

�You want it,
don�t lie. In fact, you�re going to agree to it. Nod when you want me to brand
your nipples?� she ordered.

Her slave shook
her head defiantly. That pain would be too much even for her, she reckoned.

�Whip her front,
and don�t spare her breasts or cunt. She will agree soon enough.�

The first whip
curled around her left breast and rasped a bloody mark there, making the Ulharii cry in pain.

�Pain is so
wonderful to watch. Continue, my Angels.�

The whips cut
in, and Eyrecae defiantly stayed stubborn until one expert lash struck her
pussy. This scream was higher than any she had given so far, and she nodded
rapidly and quickly. It had hurt enough to make her cry, which was painful
indeed.

�You see?
Everyone has their price. Put the screws on her nipples.�

Eyrecae soon
felt her breasts being held, and then there was pain as something like a clamp
was tightened on until it hurt.

Now, through the
darkness of her blindfold she could see a point of light as the brand advanced.
She tried to turn away, but one of the Angelii forced her to be still.

The pain was
enough to blank Eyrecae out. Her scream trailed off and her dead slumped
forward. Soon she was conscious again, and feeling very unhappy.

&nbsp;

A voice close to
her ear, Varnia�s was much softer and nicer. �You are a diamond indeed, slave.
Accept this pleasure.�

Eyrecae nodded.
She felt like release such as rarely before. Even the branding was arousing to
her, but it was all just pent up frustration without something to touch her
clit..

Hands moved over
her hips and something was tightly tied up against her crotch. A switch was
flicked and it buzzed and sung an erotic music to her body. Eyrecae arched her
back and ground her hips forward, feeling her arousal rise higher and higher.
She was desperate for release, for she had had almost two days of arousal but
no outlet. Desperately, she funnelled her arousal into making this orgasm the
best in many years.

With a moaning
cry she crested the wave and let out a long, wailing sigh into the gag. She
barely felt the gag being removed, and she only just recovered in time for the
gag to be removed.

�What do you
say, slave?�

�Thank you,
Mistress!� Eyrecae replied happily. She was still in a happy place from the
intense power of the orgasm.

�I think one
good turn deserves another. I do something for you, you do something for me.�

�What do you
wish of me, Mistress?� Eyrecae asked.

�Don�t go anywhere�and
scream for me.�

Before she could
reply, things were being stuck onto Eyrecae�s breasts, stomach and around her
pussy. She didn�t understand, but then the first zap tore into her and she
whimpered. Without even so much as a gag to bite on, there was nothing to
prevent the electrodes shocking her.

Though she was
well distracted by her own pain, she could hear moans coming from nearby, and
she guessed Varnia and the two guards were enjoying her discomfit.

Eyrecae hadn�t
meant to scream, but when the electrode on her clit zapped her, she couldn�t
contain it. It burst out, and her struggles and cries only made the sounds of
her captor�s more aroused.

She didn�t know
how long had passed, for the shocks were not even, but it must have been at
least ten minutes before they stopped, and a hand caressed her body again.

�I do believe I
shall enjoy having you as my slave. You make me come hard. Seeing you scream is
indeed fun. You know what else? We still have six hours of fun left!�

Eyrecae
swallowed nervously. �Yes, Mistress.�

�I long to make
you pleasure me, and you will, you have no choice, but not yet. Angels, stretch
her.�

At first it was
barely noticeable, but soon her feet left the floor and her arms stretched up
taut. Eyrecae was now suspended totally in air, racked by her chains, but not
painfully yet. They didn�t want to hurt her to the point that she had broken
bones, only to show her who controlled her.

�I have work to do. Angels, get the chair and put her on it. I shall
return in an hour, and I expect her to be ready for her next punishment. You
may play with her until then.�

�Thank you,
Mistress,� they chorused, and then the door was closed.

&nbsp;

Eyrecae did not,
and could not resist as they lowered her to the ground and undid her wrists.
They bound them tight behind her back again with rope. Her ankles and knees
were also bound with rope though, and the cursed chastity belt was locked on.

The Angelii
dragged her, still blindfolded, over the floor and then removed the cloth over
her eyes. One of them was already stripping, while the other knelt behind
Eyrecae and held her still.

Finally, Tasaril,
who had gone second the day before spread her legs and Eyrecae was pushed
forward. This time it was different though; the two Eldorai were more
demanding, and punished her if they thought she lagged. And so Eyrecae accepted
the prize before her and licked it, first starting with the area around the
labia, and then going deeper, before finally going for the clitoris.

With a final
sigh, Tasaril pushed the slave away. She did not move to get dressed though,
and smiled. �Sister, perhaps we should enjoy this slave a little more? I will
fetch a bowl of water, and something to pleasure us.�

Aeothir seemed
to understand, for she eagerly forced Eyrecae over to a low bench and played
with her captive�s body to arouse her. Soon, the naked Angelii was back holding
a wide bowl of water and a thick strap on dildo. 

The bowl was set
down, and Eyrecae�s head was dunked into it and held, despite the feeble
struggles. Eventually Eyrecae was pulled loose and held dripping and
spluttering to the bench.

Tasaril
reappeared, redressed in her armour and took over dunking her helpless slave�s
head into the water until Eyrecae�s lungs were burning. She was pulled out and
dumped to the floor. Unable to get up easily because of her bonds, Eyrecae got
her breath back weakly on the ground.

Hands bent
Eyrecae over the bench while in her peripheral vision she saw Aeothir now naked
and wearing a smile as she advanced with the dildo. The end of it was shoved
into Eyrecae�s mouth and tied in place, then the Eldorai spread her legs on the
bench, and Tasaril took hold of their slave�s hair.

With a thrust,
Eyrecae�s head was forced forward, with the dildo, into Aeothir�s waiting
vagina. A moan of pleasure greeted that, and soon Tasaril was forcing Eyrecae
into a steady rhythm that aroused and excited the other Angel until she let out
a final moan and moved aside.

The gag was
pulled out, and Eyrecae was given the job of licking Aeothir�s pussy clean, and
when that was done she was dunked a few more times while Aeothir dressed.

&nbsp;

�The chair� was
an immoveable seat designed to restrain a captive totally. Over a dozen steel
bands were used to secure a prisoner, and soon the Angelii had Eyrecae
restrained and helpless.

Eyrecae was
sitting, legs spread apart and secured onto two long boards that kept her from
closing her legs, and left her pussy exposed. Her arms were by her side
straight down and there secured at wrists and below the shoulder. Each
restraint was screwed into place so there was no easy way to escape.

The final screw
had been barely tightened when the door opened.

The two Angelii
knelt. �Mistress, we have prepared your slave.�

�Good. Slave, escape. You have five minutes to be free. Go.�

Eyrecae knew this
was a game she had no hope of beating. She struggled a little, but there was no
chance of her getting free in a hundred years, let alone five minutes.

Varnia obviously
knew that, but wanted to have some sport anyway, producing a long shock rod and
using it to zap her prisoner and make her twitch. Finally, the Empress� wife
bored of the game and ordered the Angelii to return the slave to her cell.

�You will get to
know this chair well, slut. Bind her, Angels, and leave her food, then join me.
No playing.�

&nbsp;

Eyrecae was soon
back in her cell, chained as she had been in the
morning, and with the cursed chastity belt locked on. One concession was that
her wrists were chained in front of her, though still attached to the leg
manacles. 

Exhausted and
horny, she lay back, and she knew it was barely even midday. What they would do
to her she had no idea, and no choice but to find out!
