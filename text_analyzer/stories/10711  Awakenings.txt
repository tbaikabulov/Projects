Synopsis: The tale of an opportunity for revenge and how the process effects both the captor and the captured.






The Key

Anticipation.

The opportunity to finally get the payback I have craved for so long has at last presented itself.&nbsp; The target is in sight and best of all is drinking alone at the bar.&nbsp; I have run through all the possible scenarios so many times before.&nbsp; Now after long wait it is time to set the trap.

I see the target get up and with a slight stagger head towards the bathroom.&nbsp; In their inebriated state I see that the target left their drink at the bar unattended.&nbsp; I think to myself this is all too easy.&nbsp; I make the way to the bar and order myself a drink and while the bartenders back is turned I quickly drop the drug into glass.&nbsp; I am able to get my drink and return to my table before the target returns. Now I just have to wait a bit while the trap is sprung.

The drug is pretty fast acting and in the targets current drunken state it does not take long for the effect to start sinking in.&nbsp; As the bartender notices that my target has had enough tells them it is time to go.&nbsp; My target can hardly walk at this point a trips a few times while walking to the car.&nbsp; 

The last fall was fortunately very close to their car as the target was now unconscious.&nbsp; I find they keys laying next to the targets hand and drag them the last few feet to the car.&nbsp; After some work I am able to lift the target into the back seat of the car.&nbsp; 

The time for my long awaited vengeance has finally come.&nbsp; As I drive back to the old warehouse the thoughts of all I have planned has my mind spinning.&nbsp; I try to calm my nerves and I keep telling myself to stay calm and follow the plan.&nbsp; If I am smart then I will have all the time in the world to enact my revenge.&nbsp; 

As I reach the warehouse I raised the door and drive the car inside.&nbsp; I need to get the target out of the car and in position so that I can ditch the car and make it back before they wake up.&nbsp; It had already been an hour that the drug was taken and I should have another 3 or 4 more before the effects ware off.

My preparations would make what was to come so much easier.&nbsp; I had found all the supplies I would need online.&nbsp; I was able to pick up a variety of police grade cuffs, straps and even an old autopsy table.&nbsp; Everything I would need was all set up in the middle of the warehouse and I was able to drive the car right up to it.

It took a little time to get my target out of the car and into position on the table but fortunately I was able to get it done without any problems.&nbsp; Once on the table I used a scalpel to cut off all of the targets clothing carefully collecting everything for disposal later.

I pulled the targets hands over head and fastened a set of cuffs locking the hands securely to the end of the table.&nbsp; Ankle cuffs were used next to secure the legs to the foot of the table.&nbsp; Now that the basic restraints are taken care of I add in a series of straps running across the table.&nbsp; Two straps run over the legs with one just below and one just above the knees.&nbsp; To secure the torso a strap is run over the top of the pelvis, another is just below the rib cage and the final is run across the upper chest and just under the armpits.&nbsp; 

The final step is to restrain the head.&nbsp; During my online shopping I found a head trainer restraint.&nbsp; The way this one was designed it had a large ring that would sit on the top of the head as well as side rings on the side of the face.&nbsp; It had a heavy padded blindfold and a large ring gag built into it as well.&nbsp; I slip it into place and tightly adjust the straps into place.&nbsp; The ring was the hardest part to get into place as it had an inner diameter of 2 inches.&nbsp; I slipped in a pair of wireless noise canceling ear buds but did not start the recording I had prepared.&nbsp; This would be effective in restricting most hearing for now and would be quite useful when the time came for the reprogramming.&nbsp; Once everything was in place I tied of the top and side rings to the table.&nbsp; 

It can't hear.&nbsp; 

It can't see.&nbsp; 

It can't move.&nbsp; 

It can't speak normally for now and not at all soon.

Stepping back to review my work I am satisfied that the target is into position and will not be going anywhere.&nbsp; Well at least not until I grew tired of it.&nbsp; The drug had worked as intended and the restraint devices seem to work as well.&nbsp; The true test would come soon when it woke up.

Checking the time I see that I only have a few hours remaining to get the car and clothes disposed of.&nbsp; The clothing would be easy enough to burn but the car is another matter all together.&nbsp; I knew I could not just park it somewhere as eventually it would be found.&nbsp; I could stage some sort of accident and have it burn up but the cops would figure out that there is no body in the wreckage.&nbsp; I could keep the car stashed somewhere but then again I would run the risk of it eventually being found.&nbsp; Luckily for me fate had offered up the best possible solution for my dilemma.

A recent crime spree had broken out in our town with cars disappearing left and right never to be found again.&nbsp; The police have suspected it was some sort of chop shop setting up operations.&nbsp; What they did not know was that these disappearances were the result of a new gang in town who were taking the cars, stripping down the VIN numbers and selling them across the border.&nbsp; I came to this information when I caught one of the thieves trying to steal my own car while I was scoping out warehouse space.&nbsp; These thieves were all small timers and after a little time on my torture table I was able to work out a deal with him.&nbsp; He would dispose of the car for me and in turn I agreed to release him.&nbsp; I parked the car at the agreed location and after wiping away all traces of my presence I left it for him.&nbsp; After getting back to my own car I circled back and verified that the car was indeed gone.

Satisfied that everything was now set I returned to the warehouse.&nbsp; My victim was just as I left it.&nbsp; Bound, blind, deaf, naked and oh so vulnerable.&nbsp; Oh this will be fun indeed.


&nbsp; 

The Lock

Silence.&nbsp; Well almost anyway.&nbsp; 

I awaken to find myself lying on my back with my arms raised above my head.&nbsp; 

I am surrounded by darkness and I assume that it is still night time.&nbsp; As I blink I can feel something pressing against my eyelids.&nbsp; 

As I try to reach down to pull off whatever is covering my eyes my hands don't get very far. They only move an inch before I feel the metal of the cuffs dig into the tender flesh of my wrist.

Panic starts to set in as I try to raise my head off the table and realize whatever is covering my eyes is also holding my head firmly in place. As I begin to struggle against my bindings I also become aware that my legs are also pinned down as so I can not even bend my knees.

I cry out for help or at least try to as the only sounds I hear are muffled and garbled.&nbsp; About this time I notice the pain in my jaw as I can feel a rigid metal ring in my mouth.&nbsp; I try to push it out but it is tightly secured behind my teeth and I can also feel the straps cutting into the sides of my mouth.

I lay there struggling for some time until I tire from my efforts.&nbsp; Realizing that I would not be going anywhere soon I lay there and think.&nbsp; I try to figure out how I have gotten myself in such a predicament. 

I remember going out last night to have a few drinks with some friends from work.&nbsp; I remember arriving at the bar.&nbsp; I remember us all having a few laughs and quite a few drinks.&nbsp; I remember Stacy and Billy both having to head home early because they didn't have a babysitter.&nbsp; I remember Bobby getting quite flirty with the new receptionist. I remember getting very bored as everyone else seemed to paired up and me ending up sitting at the bar all by myself because my date had to cancel at the last minute.

I try to remember what happened next but everything after sitting at the bar was a blur.&nbsp; I don't remember leaving the bar.&nbsp; I don't remember driving anywhere.&nbsp; I don't remember much of anything else at all.

I am not sure how long I laid there but the next thing I remember is being awaken by someone throwing ice water all over me.&nbsp; I immediately begin to struggle against my bindings and yell to whomever threw the water to let me go.&nbsp; My efforts to get free are met with no response from my captor.&nbsp; Well no vocal response anyway.

I begin to feel someone slowly start touching my skin.&nbsp; I feel their fingers make their way up, starting at my feet, and tracing their fingers up my legs to my outer thigh.&nbsp; It is at this point that I realize that while I was out my clothing had been removed.&nbsp; I begin struggling again and I feel their hand pull away.&nbsp; I try to yell for them to let me go but once again I hear no reply.

Once I settle down I feel the hand return to touching my skin again.&nbsp; It starts just above my pelvis and traces bare skin until it reaches my abdomen.&nbsp; It seems that one of the bindings was covering from my navel up to my lower rib cage.&nbsp; I begin feeling my skin being touched again as it reached my chest area.&nbsp; 

The fingers slowly begin to trace the skin around my nipples but do not touch them directly.&nbsp; The fingers continue to circle around for several minutes before resuming their climb up my chest.

I feel my captor slide some sort of strap under my neck and around until what I assume is some sort of collar is securely fastened.

After a few minutes I feel something being forced into my mouth through the metal ring.&nbsp; I notice that it taste like some sort of rubber and feels soft against my tongue initially.&nbsp; I feel the rubber object being moved around the inside my mouth slightly as it begins to grow in size.&nbsp; It gets larger and larger as my tongue is forced to the bottom of my mouth and my jaw starts to ache as it reaches its maximum size.

After another few minute pause I feel some sort of clamp placed over my nose forcing me to breath through my mouth.&nbsp; I am relieved a bit when I notice that I am still able to breath through the gag in my mouth.&nbsp; 

That relief was short lived as I feel my mouth starting to be filled with some sort of liquid.&nbsp; I can not identify what the liquid was but it did have a strong medicine like taste.&nbsp; I am forced to swallow the liquid so that I can resume breathing.

As soon as I swallow the liquid I notice that I can no longer sense my captors presence.&nbsp; No more forcing things into my mouth.&nbsp; No more adjusting the collar.&nbsp; No more touching my skin.&nbsp; As I lay there I contemplate what is to happen to me.&nbsp; Who has captured me?&nbsp; Why did they capture me?&nbsp; What is to become of me?&nbsp; These are the things running through my mind as I slip from consciousness.

End of first section.
These first 2 installments lay the foundations for the remainder of the series.&nbsp; This is my first writing and feedback is appreciated.
