Synopsis: (Tatsu Story III) Tatsu puts Plump-Bottomed Warblers in their place.Belling the Cats, or   
Tatsu Tames the Twelve (Tatsu Story III)    
By C  
Part I  
It was noon in Tatsu's Garden, and in a clearing in the midst of the rhododendrons,
  an urgent meeting had been called. Basilissa, the most influential of the Plump-Bottomed
  Warblers, had summoned all her sisters&ndash;and such was her prestige that
  hundreds had come. Most sat around her on the grass, their legs demurely crossed.
  Ordinarily, they might have savored the cool dampness against their nether
  parts; but their anxiety crowded all pleasure from their minds. At the cost
  of great effort, a masking spell had been placed around the clearing. Would
  it hold? And would Basilissa tell them anything to banish the terror that plagued
  them?  
When she decided the time was right, Basilissa climbed up on a large stone
  in the middle of the clearing. Like all her confederates, she was beautiful,
  with long hair, as black as the deepest night, reaching down to her waist,
  and a matching semi-diamond of black adorning her groin. Her skin was pale;
  her lips were bright red; her breasts, thighs, and hips were full and achingly
  curvaceous. She wore a long-sleeved, waist-length tunic of cerulean, with high
  heels of the same shade&ndash;and nothing more. (Warblers were inordinately
  proud of their pussies, and so they reveled in showing them off to the world.
  This vanity cost them dearly, for it was not hard for predators to catch their
  scent&ndash;and then catch them!) It took just a few moments for the assembled
  fays to become quiet and attentive. Confident that everyone would listen closely,
  Basilissa spoke.  
&quot;My sisters! Much that I say tonight will hardly be news. You all remember
  how we were captured and brought to this garden&ndash;this Eden rather, with
  everything a fay could desire: delicious flowers of every description; a gentle
  climate; and the softest mosses and grasses&ndash;just the thing for amorous
  repose!&quot; (Here several in the audience laughed.) &quot;You remember as
  well our terrible, heartbreaking discovery: that blight upon the garden; that
  canker gnawing at Eden. You remember when we first encountered . . . the cats.&quot; (At
  this, many drew in their breath sharply. None of them cared to say or hear
  the word &quot;cat.&quot;)  
&quot;Yes, those loathsome harem cats, those five terrible sons and their
  ghastly mother! On that first day they took six of us, as well as six Brook
  Nymphs; and they have taken six of each species every day since. All this you
  know.&quot;  
&quot;What you may not know is that we are not reproducing fast enough. We
  thrust our tongues into each other's pussies with commendable alacrity, but
  it makes little difference. It seems the anxiety that torments us all has somehow
  made us less fertile. Fewer and fewer of our eggs are hatching.&quot; (This
  statement was met with gasps of horror.) &quot;Yes, we are failing to fulfil
  our foremost duty: to fill the world with Plump-Bottomed Warblers. Instead,
  if present trends continue, our lineages will soon disappear.&quot; (&quot;Say
  it isn't so!&quot; someone shouted.)  
Basilissa motioned for silence, then continued. &quot;Even if we were not
  confronted with a reproductive crisis, the scourge of the harem cats demands
  some response, some action. That scourge is even worse than you may think.&quot; She
  turned now to a Warbler standing a few paces behind her: a redhead, even more
  buxom than the Warbler norm, dressed in pale green. &quot;Hostia, tell them
  what you've discovered.&quot;  
Hostia curtseyed and stepped forward. &quot;Ahem,&quot; she said. &quot;I'm
  . . . Hostia, Basilissa's personal assistant. And I've seen . . . I've seen
  the place . . . . &quot; The girl then lost her composure, and her breasts
  and lower lip began to tremble visibly.  
&quot;Would you spit it out?&quot; someone shouted. &quot;Let her talk!&quot; snapped
  Basilissa.  
&quot;I've seen the place where they take their victims!&quot; Hostia cried.
  (More gasping from the audience.) She rushed on. &quot;They always line up
  the Brook Nymphs they catch . . . right by the water (you've all seen that);
  but our girls&ndash;nobody could figure out where they take them. Well, I was
  there! It's a clearing in the pine wood to the north! I saw it! You all know
  how they p-pounce out of nowhere; how they like to go for the . . . the breasts.
  Then they . . . carry the girls off. But what happens after that? Well, they
  take them to this clearing . . . and they line them up in a row. When I found
  the place . . . there they were: six girls. I hid behind a tree . . . I wanted
  to run, but I had to watch! Well, there the girls were . . . on their backs
  . . . there was blood on their tunics. And then it was just like the Brook
  Nymphs: they . . . nipped them . . . nipped them . . . on their p-pussies!&quot; (&quot;No!
  No!&quot; several in the audience cried. More than one covered her groin protectively
  with her hands. Brook Nymphs were one thing; but these were Warbler pussies
  that had been violated.) &quot;Yes . . . that's what they did. And the girls
  screamed, and cried, and begged. 'Please don't hurt us!' they said, 'Oh dear
  God please!' . . . but they just . . . nipped them again . . . and again. And
  the girls were bleeding . . . and kicking. (I've never seen so much kicking!)
  Then . . . then, they licked them . . . with their big hurty tongues! Soon
  they were spurting honey! And they kept licking them . . . until . . . until
  they were still.&quot;  
The fays just looked at Hostia in horrified silence. She spoke again. &quot;So
  . . . I'm h-here to tell you exactly what happened. And something else, that
  I think is more important: I think they figured out . . . that I was there,
  'cause it seemed . . . that they got inside my head. And the mother cat seemed
  to say: 'Later, pretty redhead, later. You'll know the day . . . when you get
  a tingly feeling . . . at the bottom of your tummy. I'm all set for today,
  but I really want to taste your little red slice of pie . . . and I will, on
  the day you get all . . . t-tingly. That's the sign . . . that my kind and
  yours are about to get acquainted.' That's what she seemed to say. So I think
  . . . if they can talk to us in our thoughts, maybe they can read our thoughts,
  too. That could explain a lot: how they always find us--always. And how it's
  always six each day . . . who get kicky.&quot; (This was a fairy euphemism
  for being captured.)  
&quot;And one more thing. I w-woke up this morning . . . and . . . my tummy
  was tingling! And my knees were all weak. And my breasts were sore. And my
  . . . my pussy . . . was honey-damp! I've been like this all day long. And
  I've a notion . . . that another five . . . are feeling the same way!&quot; Hostia
  fell now into a fit of helpless sobbing. Basilissa took her gently in her arms
  and made her sit down. Five other girls had begun to cry as well, and would
  not be comforted.  
&quot;Well,&quot; said Basilissa, &quot;there you have it. &quot;These .
  . . creatures seem to have powers such as we'd never have guessed. And the
  way they dispatch their poor victims! Something must be done!&quot;  
At these words, Martina, another influential Warbler and an imperious blonde
  beauty in red, stood up. &quot;What can  be done?&quot; she
  asked. &quot;And even if something can be done, suppose they really do read
  our minds. Can't they foil anything we come up with?&quot;  
&quot;Maybe,&quot; said Basilissa. &quot;Maybe not. As soon as Hostia gave
  me her disturbing news, I shielded my thoughts with the strongest masking spell
  I knew. I didn't bother going to the Brook Nymphs; you know how rude mermaids
  are! Instead, I quickly went to all the other Warblers whose magical talents
  are comparable to mine (there are ten of them).&quot; (She nodded to a group
  of fays who stood a short distance behind her.) &quot;They masked their thoughts,
  just as I had mine. Then, in concert, we formed a plan and have already gone
  far towards implementing it. We soon realized, however, that we alone do not
  have the energy to consummate this plan. We need every one of you. So that's
  why I summoned you all. At a terrible cost in energy to the eleven of us, we
  have made you invisible to outsiders; what's more, we have masked your thoughts,
  your sounds, and (perhaps most important) your scent&ndash;all so that we might
  meet in relative safety.&quot;  
&quot;Enough build-up!&quot; said Martina. &quot;What is this plan?&quot;  
&quot;I'm sorry to say we can't destroy the harem cats,&quot; said Basilissa. &quot;We're
  just not strong enough. But, with your help, we can hex them in such a way
  that we'll always be warned of their approach. We'll hear a loud noise&ndash;something
  like a siren&ndash;well before they can pounce. The hex will also allow each
  girl to mask her thoughts&ndash;nothing else&ndash;when the time comes to lay
  her eggs.&quot; (Warblers were very nearly helpless when laying, so a siren
  then would do them little good.)  
&quot;And that's all we can do?&quot; asked Martina.  
&quot;I'm afraid so.&quot;  
&quot;Well, it's better than what we've done so far, which is nothing. Tell
  us how to make it happen.&quot;  
&quot;All of you raise your arms toward the sky,&quot; said Basilissa. They
  did so. Then she began to intone the charm on which she and the others had
  worked:  
 &quot;Harem kitties, strong and slick,   
 No more will you make us kick.   
   
 When a sneaky cat comes near,   
 A siren's scream will rend the ear.   
   
 Warblers' tears are turned to mirth;   
 Harem cats bite down on . . . earth.   
   
 Harem kitties, strong and slick,   
 No more will you make us kick.&quot;   
   
When she had finished, Martina spoke again. &quot;When will this go into
  effect?&quot;  
&quot;Sadly, it may take a few days. I'm sorry, Hostia.&quot; (Hostia just
  kept on weeping.)  
&quot;Chock-full of good news today, aren't you?&quot; said Martina. &quot;I
  have another question.&quot;  
&quot;Now there's a surprise,&quot; said Basilissa. &quot;What do you want
  to know?&quot;  
&quot;What about that gardener?&quot;  
&quot;The mopy-looking old man?&quot;  
&quot;Exactly. He seems to be allied with the cats.&quot;  
&quot;What of it? He doesn't appear to be very bright, and he's certainly
  not fast enough to catch any of us on his own. Let's concentrate on what should
  really worry us.&quot;  
&quot;I just don't like loose ends,&quot; said Martina. She looked unhappy,
  but she left it at that.  
    
It was now time for the meeting to disperse. The eleven had done their job
  too well. The harem cats had scanned the area with their powerful senses&ndash;both
  natural and supernatural. The complete absence of any spoor&ndash;even a residue
  from previous weeks&ndash;puzzled them at first. At last, they divined what
  must be up. When the fays stepped out from their protective cover, six hungry
  kitties were waiting. Hostia got very   kicky, as did
  the five girls who had wept along with her.  
Part II  
It took three days. Eighteen fairies cried their hearts out in the pine wood.
  At last, on the fourth day, came proof that the hex worked. Two Warblers were
  dallying by the daffodils when a horrible Wheeee . . . eeee . . .
  eeee . . . wheeee . . . eeee . . . eeee!  assailed their ears. They
  leapt up and dashed    off. When they risked looking behind
  them, they saw two boy-cats standing right where they had been. The girls had
  never seen frustration on the face of a cat before. The alarm sounded several
  more times that day&ndash;and each time it gave one or more fays the chance
  to escape.  
Amazingly, an entire week went by without a single girl having to kick. The
  effect on the fays was almost miraculous. Their anxiety by no means disappeared;
  but it no longer weighed so heavily on them. Their thoughts turned much more
  readily now to love&ndash;and they sated their desires in a more relaxed and
  leisurely way. Soon a record number of Warblers were ready to drop their eggs.
  Now, when you heard a girl groaning or whimpering in the garden, it was most
  likely the cramps that accompanied egg-laying, not the teeth of a cat, that
  pained.her. And everyone was confident that most of these eggs would hatch.  
A month went by&ndash;and only five girls were caught&ndash;all of these
  while laying. The eleven who had engineered the hex decided to celebrate with
  an afternoon party by the brook. Basilissa invited Martina (the two had been
  seeing a lot of each other lately). When Martina showed up, the others were
  already there, seated on smooth stones by the water's edge. Basilissa embraced
  Martina warmly, kissed her on the lips, and introduced her to the rest of the
  group. They all noted with great amusement that every one of them had a swollen
  belly. &quot;I think we'll all drop about the same time,&quot; said Basilissa.  
They sat down and dug into a picnic of assorted blossoms. The conversation
  was light and full of good cheer, with many jokes at the expense of the hapless
  harem cats. Then the siren sounded. &quot;Ugghhh!&quot; said Martina, &quot;this
  could get really tiresome.&quot; Though a little more sluggish then usual,
  they darted off at a good clip. They were approaching the petunias, when the
  siren sounded again. They turned and ran off in a new direction. They were
  about to pause by the chrysanthemums to catch their breath&ndash;when again
  they heard that terrible noise! Off they dashed in yet another direction. And
  again they heard it: Wheeee . . . eeee . . . wheee . . . eeee!   
   
And so it went. Because they could not stop to rest, their breath grew ragged
  and they began to stumble and stagger. If that weren't bad enough, there seemed
  to be some vicious method to the sirens' madness. The girls were being herded
  gradually toward a big patch of ferns. What awaited them there? Soon they reached
  the fern-patch, only to hear the siren right behind them. It might be a trick
  . . . but what if it weren't? They ran in among the green stalks.  
They emerged in a gully with high, rocky sides. It was choked at the other
  end with dirt, stones, and old branches. The only way out was back through
  the ferns. If they couldn't escape that way, they were trapped. And something
  was coming! Fern stalks rustled; a few snapped. Then something fell loudly
  to the ground. &quot;Christ in freakin' sidecar!&quot; said a strange voice.
  Whatever it was, it couldn't be a harem cat. Nonetheless, the girls were terrified.
  Their bodies trembled; their big breasts heaved; several bladders suddenly
  emptied. More snapping and rustling, and then something stepped into the gully.
  The girls screamed and hugged one another in desperate embraces. It was . .
  . an elderly East Asian man, dressed in jeans, workshirt, and a baseball cap!
  The really strange thing about him was his size: he was only a foot tall, no
  larger than a Warbler.  
&quot;Ha ha!&quot; he said. &quot;Caught with pants down&ndash;'cept you
  got no pants! If you had pants, would for sure be down! I making sense?&quot;  
&quot;Not really,&quot; said Basilissa. &quot;Who are you, you strange little
  man?&quot;  
&quot;Not recognize? Now Tatsu's feelings hurt.&quot;  
&quot;You're . . . you're that dopey gardener!&quot; said another girl, a
  foxy ash-blonde in blue. &quot;Except that now, you're really small!&quot;  
&quot;You a sharp one,&quot; said Tatsu. &quot;Well, no one say fairy have
  to be rocket scientist.&quot;  
&quot;Well, what do you want?&quot; said Martina.  
&quot;Want to clean bad apples out of garden,&quot; said Tatsu. Then he snapped
  a finger and something appeared in his right hand. It was a cassette tape player,
  miniaturized just like the man who held it. He pushed a button on the tape
  player, and the gulch was filled with the terrible &quot;Wheeee . . . eeee
  . . . wheeee . . . eeee!&quot; of the cat alarm.  
&quot;Y-you tricked us!&quot; Martina shouted. &quot;You'll pay for that!
  Come on girls, let's tear him apart!&quot; And twelve wrathful females began
  to advance on the old gardener.  
Tatsu seemed unperturbed. &quot;I think bad girl got something more important
  to attend to,&quot; he said.  
&quot;What do you mean?&quot; said Basilissa.  
&quot;Well, you all come through fern patch, right?&quot;  
&quot;Yes,&quot; said another Warbler, an auburn beauty in aquamarine.  
&quot;Well, this morning I brush fern with special drug called Cramprin.
  Make fairy egg-drop time come faster. In fact, bad girl should be cramping
  up right . . . now.&quot;  
&quot;Oh my God, he's right!&quot; cried a breathtaking brunette in burgundy. &quot;Unnnhhh!
  They're coming . . . so hard!&quot; And she squatted down right where she stood.
  Soon her cries were joined by others: &quot;Ooooohh, it hurts!&quot; &quot;Oh
  God God God, it's tearing me apart!&quot; &quot;Ahhhhhh, my time, my time!&quot; and
  so on. Within seconds, the girls were all crouched down, their faces white
  and contorted, their nails digging into their thighs, their knees knocking.
  They had never felt cramps like these.  
Tatsu went right to work. He snapped his fingers again, and the tape player
  disappeared, replaced by a long coil of strong rope. He cut the rope in sections
  with a knife he always carried with him. Then he ran up to the squatting, groaning
  girls and bound each one's wrists tightly behind her back. The trauma of egg-laying
  incapacitates a Warbler at the best of times; and this was something far worse.
  Knowing that they must obey any male who bound them, the girls all cried out
  in bitter despair; but they could do nothing to resist.  
It took several minutes of groans, moans, shrieks, and tears, but at last
  each Warbler dropped a clutch of eggs. Then, exhausted, they all fell trembling
  to their knees. &quot;Didn't think the gardener would be a problem, did you?&quot; hissed
  Martina at Basilissa. Basilissa just hung her head. Martina then looked up
  at Tatsu. &quot;Well . . . you've got us . . . what do you want?&quot;  
&quot;Want bad girl out of garden. Garden got simple rule: kitty-cat pounce;
  fay-girl kick, cry pretty eyes out. You break rule, you gotta go.&quot;  
&quot;Are you saying we have no right to defend ourselves?&quot; asked Martina.  
&quot;That it exactly: you got no right to defend yourself.&quot;  
&quot;But it's our sacred duty (every Warbler's sacred duty!) to perpetuate
  our species and our separate lineages. Those . . . ghastly cats threatened
  our long-term survival. They had to be countered!&quot;  
Tatsu snorted. &quot;Silly fairy! Use head for once! Why you lay so many
  dud egg? 'Cause you always worried. But it just fact of life: in Tatsu's Garden,
  kitty-cat bag six a day. No problem if you accept fact and relax. Think about
  it. When dyke-fay species like yours fuck, two get pregnant, not one. And you
  fuck all the time, like fuck-starved bunny. Then you drop four, five egg by
  end of week. And what happen when cat come by while fay laying egg? Let her
  lay her egg, then  bite her pussy. Egg just fine. Egg
  sit for week or so, getting bigger and bigger; then new batch of Warbler hatch,
  full-grown and ready to fuck. Do math; you not gonna die out. Just take deep
  breath and say to self every morning: have some fun, girly-fay, be sure to
  fuck&ndash;'cause sooner, later, kitty-cat gonna bite pussy&ndash;and that
  put big crimp in party-time!&quot;  
&quot;B-but . . . we don't want our pussies bitten!&quot; cried one of the
  girls, a raven-haired minx in red.  
&quot;Yeah, and I wanna look like Chow Yun Fat. Where that get me? No, pussy-biting
  come with territory. Your pussies looking mighty fine right now. How about
  I just give them to kitty-cat?&quot;  
&quot;No! No!&quot; they all cried.  
&quot;Well, you got choice: get nipped by kitty; or walk to end of gully,
  and out of garden forever.&quot;  
&quot;If we agree to leave . . . the garden . . . our home . . . forever,&quot; said
  Martina, &quot;do you promise we won't be bitten?&quot;  
&quot;No problemo,&quot; said Tatsu. &quot;You go out through end of gully,
  I guarantee: kitty-cat never nip you&ndash;not one little bit.&quot;  
Martina conferred briefly with the others. Then she said: &quot;It seems
  we're agreed. We'll leave now. We'll miss this beautiful place terribly, but,
  with the choices you've given us, it's for the best. I have one question, though.
  What about our eggs?&quot;  
&quot;Those stay here,&quot; said the gardener. &quot;Don't worry: they get
  same chance everyone else get.&quot;  
&quot;Very well,&quot; said Martina.  
&quot;OK,&quot; said Tatsu. &quot;Now just get up and walk. When you get
  to end of gully, path will appear and let you through. From there, just keep
  on going.&quot; So, trembling and teary-eyed, the twelve stood up, a little
  unsteadily, and started to leave.  
Just then, Basilissa spoke. &quot;Will you . . . untie us at least?&quot;  
&quot;Ah . . . no,&quot; said Tatsu. &quot;Don't worry; everything taken
  care of at other end.&quot;  
So off they went in a long line. When they reached what looked like an impenetrable
  drift of dirt and loose stones, sure enough, a narrow pass appeared out of
  nowhere. They filed into the pass, and then emerged onto a big, green lawn.
  They had barely gotten used to their new surroundings, when--ahead of them--there
  was a sudden flash of light&ndash;so intense, they had to shut their eyes.
  When they opened them again, they saw a horrid, hateful vista: a long wooden
  scaffolding, with twelve nooses hanging down over what appeared to be a collapsible
  platform. Some gasped. Some began to cry. &quot;Oh no,&quot; said Basilissa. &quot;Oh
  dear Lord, no.&quot;  
Part III  
&quot;Oh yes,&quot; said a voice behind them. The fairies turned to see Tatsu,
  a big grin on his face. They trembled so hard when they saw that grin that
  some of them had trouble standing. More than one released a spurt of urine. &quot;I
  forget to tell you,&quot; he said. &quot;Disobey rule of garden&ndash;that
  capital offense.&quot;  
&quot;But . . . but you were only going to exile us!&quot; wailed Basilissa,
  just this side of hysteria.  
&quot;I say: leave garden. I not say you don't leave pretty feet first. And
  I keep promise: no kitty will ever nip you.&quot;  
&quot;But this is . . . no better!&quot; cried Martina.  
&quot;Oh well. Sometime Door No. 1 and Door No. 2 both suck. 'Che sera, sera,'
  as German poet say. Now be good caught Warbler gang and go up on scaffold.&quot; Of
  course they had to obey. Trembling, sobbing, and wailing, they climbed the
  steps of the gallows and walked out onto the long platform. Their captor went
  up after them. He made each girl stand behind a noose; then he drew the nooses
  tight around their tender necks. Now they all cried even harder.  
&quot;That right: cry for all you worth,&quot; he said. &quot;Before today,
  you not know what 'get kicky' really mean. I make you kick like no kitty can.&quot;  
Tatsu was not without mercy. He knew that if the Warblers were primed, they'd
  come a good deal more and a good deal harder in their last travail. And their
  pussies were so plump and pretty! So he went from girl to girl, and with his
  right hand he gently cupped each cunt. (Their pubic hair was as soft as he
  had ever felt.) After a bit of stroking, he slipped a finger in, as far as
  it would go. The girls made quite a fuss, since his fingers were thick and
  callused&ndash;not at all like a fay's delicate digits&ndash;and their twats
  were still sore from laying. But their yelps, moans, and whimpers were prompted
  as much by pleasure as by pain. The proof was in the honey: he milked a palm's
  worth from each girl (and licked it all up greedily as he went along). When
  he cupped Basilissa, her eyes flashed. &quot;You're hurting me!&quot; she cried.  
&quot;Kitty-cat hurt more,&quot; he said, then fingered her with especial
  gusto.  
Martina was the last in line. &quot;It's so humiliating!&quot; she said when
  her turn came.  
&quot;Awww, admit it, girly-girl: you like to show off pussy. Can't complain
  if Tatsu see and want to sample ware. And such pretty puss, too; such pretty
  girl!&quot;  
&quot;A pretty girl . . . in a man's world,&quot; Martina sniffed.  
&quot;Ah, you catch on at last!&quot; said her captor and gave her mons  Veneris   a
  good hard pinch. Then he strolled from girl to girl, pinching a plump pussy
  here, smacking a plushy bottom there. Nor did their abundant breasts escape
  his attention. His victims wailed at these new indignities, but they also secreted
  more honey.  
At last, the wily gardener was ready for the finale. &quot;That all, pretty
  Warbler gang! Time to go now. Got any last word?&quot;  
Haltingly, tremblingly, Basilissa spoke: &quot;We . . . we understand now
  that we shouldn't have tampered with the workings of your garden. You're our
  master . . . and we have to obey. I want to obey you. But please, good master,
  is there . . . no other way to punish us? We're very tender . . . below the
  waist; if you just . . . had your way with us, and let us go, we'd never forget,
  I assure you. Please, there must be some other way. Please. Please.&quot; She
  was weeping now, but very softly.  
Martina chimed in: &quot;Oh yes, good master, please. I'm a bitch; I know
  it . . . but you've tamed me. You felt how soft I was . . . you tasted it&ndash;wasn't
  it sweet? It's all yours whenever you want it. I'll obey . . . I promise! Oh
  please, let me obey you, master.&quot; She finished then, weeping softly just
  like Basilissa. And then the other girls made similar appeals and pledges of
  submission. They, too, wept softly when they were done. Twelve beautiful, trembling
  girls&ndash;their faces wet with tears, their pussies damp and honey-scented!
  It was a struggle for the old man; it really was.  
When at last he spoke, his tone was much gentler than before. &quot;You finally
  figure out how things are, honey-gang, and I appreciate. Yes I do. But law
  of Tatsu's garden can be hard law for girl: if they come here, they must obey
  from day one. Magic of garden depend on proper balance between male and female&ndash;male
  on top, female below. Balance go, magic go. 'Cause you cross line, I gotta
  give you to kitty or dispatch you some other way. And it best for other Warbler
  in garden: they gotta learn there can be no crossing line. They gotta learn
  there is no defense to kitty-cat. They figure that out, then&ndash;believe
  it or not&ndash;they can be happy, and their egg all hatch. So I am sorry--but
  time to go.&quot;  
With these words, he went over to a metal lever and pulled it. There was
  a lurching, screeching sound, and the platform dropped away. Twelve girls twisted
  and kicked at the air, their high heels flashing in the sun. It wasn't long
  before the fay-spasms came, and the final discharge of honey. And then they
  died.  
When he was sure every girl had kicked her last, Tatsu took some tokairo  simples
  out of his right breast pocket and swallowed them. Within seconds, he was back
  to normal size. He then picked up the miniature gallows, together with its
  pretty cargo, and carried it to the rhododendron clearing. He left it there;
  but before he went, he taped a hand-lettered sign right below twelve dangling
  pairs of high-heeled feet. The sign read: &quot; Just behave for
