GINA�S Execution

All executions in Pacifica are carried out at the State Penitentiary at Sing Sing in our new electric chair. Gina was its first victim. Gina was 37 years old when she went to the electric chair on June 30, 2105, blazing a trial of light for others to follow. 

&#9;A former actress and model, Gina was both intelligent and beautiful; however her sexual peccadilloes, and in particular her bi-sexuality, are what put her in her final predicament. Her first adulterous offense occurred on December 31, 2100 at a New Year�s Eve party and involved another model, Michelle (last name deleted). At her well-publicized trial, Gina testified that her tryst was a one-time affair due to depression stemming from her on-going divorce from her husband, Joseph (last name deleted), a well-known executive in the entertainment industry. However, Michelle testified that she and Gina had been bondage partners and maintained a lesbian relationship long before the night of their arrest. She testified of their fetishes for electro-sex, vibrators, vac-beds and sybians to name a few. Both were convicted and sentenced to miniaturization for six (6) months same occurring on January 15, 2101. (see The Reduction Chamber) On May 11, 2103, Gina was again arrested for the same offense, this time involving a married man, and again convicted and miniaturized on May 27, 2103, this time for one (1) year to be served in the notorious Bremph Penal Collective. (see The Bremph Penal Collective). At trial, numerous men and women (including the married man and her former lover Michelle), testified under immunity, concerning Gina�s reputation for sexual prowess and vaginal muscular dexterity. Gina never denied the allegations.

&#9;For her third and final offense, she was arrested by Detective Kat (last name deleted) as part of a �fornication without sanction� sting operation on October 5, 2104. At Gina�s trial, another media circus, Kat testified how she and Gina meet at a lesbian club that night, which they both frequented regularly. They knew each other, intimately, for years. She testified as to how Gina initiated her crime with no prompting.  �We danced�. �We ate�. �We kissed�. �We had drinks�. Kat testified as to how Gina agreed to come to Kat�s house for the night. Gina never suspected anything was unusual. Little did Gina know the house was wired for surveillance and loaded with police from the vice unit. It would turn out to be the ultimate betrayal of love and trust. Kat testified:



We undressed. I got out of my jeans and sweater while Gina took off her matching tweed kilted skirt, blazer, and blouse. I was naked as Gina, still clad in a white bra and half-slip approached me, took hold of my hand and directed it to her waistband. I then walked behind her, I slid my hand further down, into her undies and inserted a finger. She squirmed and giggled - and appeared to be enjoying herself. Then I further disrobed her and we made love.



Here are some of the few stills which are fit for publication, from the surveillance video used at Gina�s trial:



&#9;In a shocking development, Gina, against the advice of her lawyer, testified and admitted to her crime. She had actually nodded her head in the affirmative several times during crucial portions of Kat�s testimony. But her lawyer advised her, �They�ll destroy you, Gina. Do you realize what is going to happen to you?� Gina just smiled and said �Oh what can they really do? Reduce me again? You should try it. It�s fun. I loved it�, she laughed. �Yes Gina I was there both times when they shrunk you�. she said, �You enjoyed it because you knew life would go on. But this is different, Gina.� �Whatever� Gina replied, �Anyway, the truth is the truth.� On the stand, Gina stated: 



"What does it matter who is to blame? My story is a love story, but only those tortured with love can understand what I mean. I am portrayed as a sado-masochistic nymphomaniac, lesbian and bisexual. I am not mean, cruel, unfeeling, stupid or moronic. In the history of the world how many crimes have been attributed to love? And since when has one�s love ever killed another?



She was convicted. Gina never believed she would be sentenced to the electric chair being a woman. However, the judge, also female, had other ideas:



.  .  . �We�ve tried to help you but you are incorrigible. You have not responded to any efforts at rehabilitation - be it the Reduction Chamber or the Bremph Collective. I am left with no alternative. Gina (last name deleted) you are hereby sentenced to death by electrocution in this State�s electric chair. Electricity of sufficient quantity will passed through your body so as to cause your immediate death .  .  .� 



At her sentencing, Gina wore a red silk dress, high heels (and little else) to Court, and was described by the press as a sultry, voluptuous woman. It was a privilege to strip her when she arrived at our facility. (see The Intake Center) 
  
&#9;Gina's last appeal was turned down on June 29, 2105 and the then the Governor duly signed her death warrant. She was then transferred to the Death House and confined to a 12-by-7 foot secure room where she passed her final hours chatting with prison staff (including myself), family and her legal and religious advisers. Gina still did not believe she would be electrocuted being a woman. 

&#9;Gina�s execution was set for 7:00 a.m. on June 30, 2105. At 4:30 a.m., she was awakened, and to her delight was stripped and showered with the assistance of female corrections staff. With assistance of Stella, the facility�s beautician, she also had her long brown hair put in a bun, and her neck and private areas shaved and waxed to give good electrical conductivity and so that her hair did not catch fire during her electrocution. She screamed and squirmed in the attendants� grip as Stella vacuumed her private areas clean of all hair clippings. KY Jelly was then applied by the staff to her vagina, anus and nipples to increase conductivity and prevent flesh burning. She loved every bit of it: her eyes were afire, a portent of things to come. Her final meal consisted of broccoli, cauliflower, asparagus, carrots, strawberries, hot tea with lemon and ice cream.
&#9;
&#9;Gina entered the execution chamber, completely nude, at 7:02 a.m. accompanied by several staff as well as myself. In the corridor, she had whispered to me that was resigned to her fate and was ready for her electrocution. However, the moment she entered the death chamber and saw the sturdy, impressive chair waiting to consume her, she became hesitant until an escorting officer assisted her with a gentle nudge. Gina was then bent over and a 4-inch copper electrode, coated with KY Jelly was inserted into her anus. �I can�t believe this is happening to me!� she said with a surprisingly bright, but incredulous smile. Gina then sat in, squirmed for comfort, and was strapped into the large metal chair with 8 leather straps over her waist, wrists, chest and legs. [This Chair is called Chair No. 1. We have others] Electrode pasties were then fitted as follows: 2 to the forehead, 1 to the base of the neck, 1 to the base of the spine, 2 to both biceps, 6 to the abdomen, 2 each to the upper insides of her thighs and 2 to each buttock. Suction cup electrodes, coated with KY, were also fitted to both nipples on her B-cup breasts. Wet sponges, soaked in brine solution, were wrapped around each of her ankles through which copper rods were inserted. The anal electrode was connected. A 6-inch copper electrode, coated with KY, was then inserted into her vagina. [It was her last request that I perform this task. The previous day while confiding her fears to me she stated, �I trust that only you will know just how to do that�. I also promised her a surprise telling her, �I can�t tell you what it is, but I can tell you that you will enjoy it once your time comes.� She then smiled weakly, fighting back tears. I put my arm around her, touched her soft face and told her, �Courage, Gina�. We kissed and caressed one last time. She then said �Please don�t do it. Please don�t electrocute me. I don�t want to die.� I told her, stroking her cheek, �But we have to Gina honey. It�s the law. I told you the last time you were here this was your last chance and if you came back again this would happen. We are not role playing here so begging for mercy won�t work. Those days are gone.� I left her in tears.]

&nbsp;


&#9;The curtain then opened on the last act of Gina�s life as she was made ready to receive her deadly jolts of electricity, under the supervisor of Debbie, our executioner. When I read Gina the death sentence warrant, her only display of emotion was a quivering chin and a bitten lip. On the outside she appeared calm, but her eyes betrayed how nervous and terrified she was as to what was about to happen to her. Asked if she had a final statement, she weakly replied "No ma�am," squeezing her eyes shut and keeping them shut, not looking at the witnesses gathered on the other side of the glass partition. This is not like being miniaturized in the Reduction Chamber, isn�t it Gina? I thought. She probably wishes she never left the Bremph collective. (Kat, in her full-dress leather police uniform and boots, had her face pressed against the glass in anticipation of what was about to transpire. Gina�s ex-husband shook his head and looked at the floor muttering �What a sin. What a shame.�) In her final moments, Gina did not disappoint Kat, me or anybody else present for her final performance before an audience.

&#9;Debbie then steeped forward and completed the final preparations for Gina�s execution: a ball-gag was secured in Gina�s mouth, a chin strap secured and a patent leather hood placed over her face, leaving only her nose exposed. (We don�t like to suffocate). I wanted to say something comforting to her, but the protocol is very strict as to what I can say once the curtain is opened. She prayed for a few moments before I firmly said �Good-bye Gina.� She gave me a thumbs up with both hands which I think meant, I�ll be okay. At my signal, Debbie, to my envy, clicked the red �Execute� button on the computer monitor in the control booth a few feet away, and the automatic electrocution cycle commenced at 7:08 a.m. with a low hum. As the needles on the dials on Debbie�s computer screen rose, Gina  strained against the straps in an attempt to stand up, rose about four inches high off the seat, and then proceeded to shake violently in the chair as the electricity coursed through her body and the connection completed. Her hands opened wide. The hood fell off, revealing Gina�s facial contortions and rolling, bulging eyes - the true, tortuous face of electrocution. The witnesses all gasped, including Kat who put her hand over mouth as if to say, Look at what I�ve done! Gina�s ex-husband, Joseph, cried and turned away.

&#9;While standing a safe 4 feet away from her, I heard the muffled screams and whimpers emanating from Gina which now brought back so many memories of our past escapades. The surprise was revealed: the vaginal electrode, in addition to feeding in current, also began to vibrate so as to take Gina�s mind off of what was happening to her. I knew she loved vibrators and wondered to myself how much her stifled screams were caused by pain as opposed to pleasure. Anyway, I knew for certain she would take this secret to her grave. A small amount of white smoke or steam was then seen to curl up from her right ankle electrode throughout the first 60 second cycle but there were no flames. The current was then turned off and she was allowed to relax, sweaty and slumped against the chair restraints, breathing heavily. I will never forget the pleasant aroma of Gina�s perfume and sweat permeating the execution chamber. Gina!

&#9;At 7:11 a.m., Dr. Tina (last name deleted) stepped forward with her stethoscope. She reported a faint heartbeat and shallow breathing. After a second jolt, Gina was pronounced dead at 7:13 a.m. After the mandatory 30 minute �cool down� period, Gina�s body was then unstrapped and removed from the electric chair at 7:43 a.m., wrapped in a red silk sheet (at her request), placed on a gurney and wheeled to the prison morgue. Joseph her ex-husband, had a private undertaker retrieve Gina�s body and bring it to a funeral home. The undertaker closed Gina�s tortured, blazing eyes.

&#9;Dr. Tina (last name deleted) signed Gina�s death certificate which read as follows:



The undersigned, being present at the execution by electricity of Gina (last name deleted), listened with stethoscope for sign of life, but "current sufficient to cause death has passed through the deceased�s body at 0713 on June 30, 2105.  Her mouth was agape, her face a light glow, her pupils dilated, but there was no evidence of burnt flesh or tissue. The decedent appeared to be a well-built female, even when dead."

/s/



&#9;The official execution protocol for Chair No. 1 is as follows : The automatic cycle begins with a nominal 2,300 volts, 9.5 amps, for 8 seconds; 1,000 volts, 4 amps for 22 seconds; and 2,300 volts, 9.5 amps for 8 seconds (actual values below). When a cycle is complete, the main lead to the chair is manually disconnected and the safety switch is then opened so that vital signs can be checked in complete safety. During Gina's execution, the cycles of electricity, for both jolts, were officially recorded as follows:

&#9;Even though she had bitten almost halfway through the ball gag, there was no damage to her lips, teeth or the inside of her mouth. However, her eyes were wide-open and ablaze with the horror of her electrocution. No burns were noted on her body as in the old days: it was steam that I saw rising from Gina�s right ankle electrode. While it was indeed a sin to electrocute her, I also felt highly aroused by the experience. And I hope my surprise made her feel the same way in her final moments. The execution team did such an excellent job electrocuting Gina that you would not have known what we had just done to her unless you were a witness. 

&#9;For her wake, Gina�s body was laid out dressed in the same red silk dress, heels, etc., that she wore at her sentencing and at The Intake Center. Her wake was held at her ex-husband�s estate, which was opened to the public. More than 7800 asked to see her dead body. Some visitors were praying, but others were simply gazing at the electrocuted beauty. More than 10,000 others stood in line in vain for a look.

&#9;After "lying in state", Gina�s body was returned to our custody for cremation and final disposal. At the mouth of the oven in the prison crematorium, I stepped forward and kissed her on the lips, half expecting to hear her giggle, or feel the tickle of her tongue against mine, as in times past, but it was not to be. She looked like a sleeping beauty as she was slid into the oven for final disposal. As I watched the flames consume her, I thought to myself, Gina you were hot in life and death.  Her ashes went to her family, but I also kept some in an urn as a keepsake. Her picture is on the front. I think she�d like that.
