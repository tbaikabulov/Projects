Synopsis:        A two part story of a young newspaper reporter who gets her big break assigned to do a feature article about real femdom relationships






Interview.


As Erica approached the destination for her appointment in the upscale middle class neighborhood, she had to admit to being a bit nervous and unsettled.&nbsp; Nervous because this was her big break, her first solo feature article.&nbsp; Over the past several years she had worked her way up from very local weekly papers, to being a cub reporter on the large daily newspaper, again assigned to the local news scene, to finally being promoted to a position as researcher and writer for the Life and Social section of the paper.&nbsp; She had participated and had been given a fourth, and even at times a third contributing reporter byline on a number of major articles, but this would be the first feature that would be hers alone.&nbsp; Her editor had even indicated that if done well it might even be the lead article in the Sunday section.

As big an opportunity as this was, she was unsettled because of the subject matter.&nbsp; Her editor wanted her to investigate and explore a social phenomenon that had apparently been gaining a lot of buzz on the internet and blogosphere, what was being referred to in a variety of forums as Female Led Relationships (FLRs), or Wife Dominant Marriages (WDMs).&nbsp; Erica couldn&#8217;t help but initially notice how close the latter acronym was to the more commonly used and understood WMDs, and she wondered idly if the two might share some common thread.&nbsp; Her editor had been adamant however that she wanted a serious examination of the topic, not how it might usually be comically treated in the mainstream media, but how it might actually exist in real life, as the web suggested was occurring more and more frequently.&nbsp; What were the participants like, what did it all entail, how did it work, and to what level and degree?&nbsp; Her editor believed that the time was long past due for a legitimate look at a subject and lifestyle that seemed to be growing and developing in the shadows, and she felt the Erica was just the reporter and writer to bring it to the light of day in a fair, interesting and thought provoking way.


Despite her own self confidence in her abilities, and flattered by her editor&#8217;s selection of her for such a choice assignment, Erica was not as sure.&nbsp; She had covered and written about topics where she had strong personal opinions that were in variance with the subject, but she had always prided herself at being a professional able to put those aside and be as objective as possible.&nbsp; But she wondered if she would be able to do so as effectively in this case.&nbsp; She just didn&#8217;t understand, or get in her gut, the underlying concept.&nbsp; Oh, she could understand on an intellectual level the episodic sexual thrill some might derive from this particular kink, even if it did nothing for her, but how anyone could build a solid sustaining relationship and lifestyle around it seemed beyond her.&nbsp; Real relationships were about give and take, compromise, and acceptance of equality between the partners.&nbsp; Sure, there was always struggle and stress to achieve and maintain this, but that was the only way that she could see how any relationship could work, even as it took real work to do so.

Not that she had been overly successful in her own life in maintaining relationships with men.&nbsp; She had had a number over the years but none had ever advanced very far.&nbsp; Maybe it was her inquisitive, always asking questions nature, which&nbsp; was inherent in her personality yet vital to her occupation, that had proved to be too much for the men she had been involved with in her life thus far.&nbsp; She hadn&#8217;t lost faith however that there was a Mr. Right out there, who was strong enough to accept her and love her for who and how she was. 

That perhaps was the basic difficulty which she had in understanding and potentially dealing with, even on a superficial professional level, these so called FLRs and WDMs.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t just the inequality implied.&nbsp; She supposed that in many otherwise successful relationships one of the partners could be more of the take charge person, even if it wasn&#8217;t always the man.&nbsp; But that wouldn&#8217;t mean absolutely ruling over the other person, as seemed to the case and desire in these WDMs.&nbsp; How weak must such a man be to allow his partner to walk all over him in every facet of their relationship.&nbsp; What possibly could be the attraction of such a man, except to a woman who reveled in humiliating and even causing pain in someone else, even if the recipient liked and desired it.&nbsp; Erica didn&#8217;t think that she could relate to either type of person.


But this assignment was too big an opportunity to blow, and she resolved to bury her biases as best she could and dedicate herself to writing as fair and as interesting an article as she was able.&nbsp; Not knowing quite where to start she turned first to the web, where her editor had apparently gotten the idea.&nbsp; She began perusing and familiarizing herself with the surprisingly innumerable sites that dealt with sadomasochism (SM), bondage and discipline (BD), and domination and submission (D/s), which seemed to be the basis and core of the subject at hand.&nbsp; She had never before had any inclination to sample what she came to believe had to be predominantly male viewed venues.&nbsp; But she had a job to do, and after immersing herself&nbsp; for a time in these sites, she once again not only couldn&#8217;t see the attraction, she also came to realize that these sites, for the most part, only dealt with fantasies.&nbsp; She supposed that some people might actually want to dabble in them for a kinky experience, but she strongly doubted that anyone could realistically live them on a full time basis.&nbsp; This really couldn&#8217;t be what she was being asked to explore.

With this avenue of investigation thus seemingly fruitless except for her own &#8216;educational&#8217; purposes, Erica began to search for related blogs.&nbsp; She once again discovered far more of them than she had expected, including a fairly large number purportedly posted by women, as much as one could trust the web in that respect.&nbsp; She again thought that most of the blogs also seemed to be designed for titillation rather than information, but she did come across a few that did appear to be trying to present an honest view of the lifestyle which the bloggers claimed to be living.

She began to read these few blogs far more extensively and in depth, and with one in particular she began to take advantage of the reader comment section to pose questions that she hoped would spark some meaningful and informative discussion.&nbsp; Unfortunately, when anyone would respond to any of her queries, which wasn&#8217;t very often, it was only in the most general and unsatisfactory way.&nbsp; Though she had been given a three month deadline for her article, she began to feel that she wasn&#8217;t making the necessary connections for the type of personal commentary which she felt the story needed.&nbsp; Not knowing how else to proceed she took a chance, and in the comment section of the same blog she went on to identify herself , by name, as a reporter who was very interested in writing a serious and in depth article on the D/s femdom lifestyle, and would welcome a discussion with anyone involved who would like to share their experiences.&nbsp; She left her email address for responses.


While she hadn&#8217;t been sure of what type of reaction her straightforward invitation might generate, she wasn&#8217;t quite prepared for the deluge of almost universal condemnation that resulted.&nbsp; Among the many different negative attacks were those accusing her of betraying a trust on the blog, and others of her simply being a voyeur.&nbsp; No one seemed to believe that she had any intention of producing anything more than a one sided media hatchet job.

Erica was stung by this onslaught, and although she thought the critics were being far too defensive and unfair, she did have to concede that her own underlying opinion on the whole concept was substantially negative, and that maybe there was more than a germ of truth in their concerns.&nbsp; Just as these mainly antagonistic posts began to peter out, and she was beginning to truly despair that she was not going to be able to effectively and fairly gather enough real and personal information to present the in depth and enlightening view that the assignment demanded, she received one last email.&nbsp; It was from a woman named Amy, who indicated that she and her husband were indeed living in a 24/7 D/s femdom relationship, and that she might be interested in relating her thoughts on the subject to the outside world.&nbsp; She did have two conditions before proceeding however.&nbsp; The first was that she had to verify that Erica was whom and what she said she was, and the second was that if so, any subsequent article written would change their names to protect their privacy.

Erica immediately posted back agreeing to both conditions and gave both the name of her newspaper and her editor, leaving it to Amy to independently make the appropriate inquiries.&nbsp; She then sat on pins and needles until two days later her editor let her know that Amy had indeed contacted her by phone through the newspaper, and had seemed convinced of Erica&#8217;s legitimacy.&nbsp; A day later Erica received a new post from Amy proposing a meeting for the interview and it was rapidly set up for a week later at Amy&#8217;s home.&nbsp; It was to this arranged appointment on a mid Saturday afternoon that Erica was driving.


Her GPS brought her to the lovely cul-de-sac, but without Amy&#8217;s emailed directions she would have had difficulty finding the driveway to her house.&nbsp; It wound down and around about fifty yards before coming to a modern and somewhat eclectic appearing two story home.&nbsp; Though clearly in a neighborhood with other homes in the distance, it was set apart in a small valley surrounded by a wide variety of trees which afforded a very pleasant bucolic ambiance, and a significant degree of privacy as well.&nbsp; Gathering up her equipment, and to some extent her courage as she clearly didn&#8217;t know quite what to expect, she proceeded to the front door.

Moments after ringing the chimed doorbell she was met as the door opened by a smiling, strikingly handsome man.&nbsp; Standing about six foot two, he was athletically built, and Erica judged him to be in his mid to late thirties.&nbsp; He was wearing a black crew neck sweater with a gray collared shirt beneath, and black slacks and shoes.&nbsp; She took all of this in with her reporter&#8217;s eye in the few seconds it took for him to greet her.

�You must be Miss Erica.� he greeted her enthusiastically.&nbsp; �Come in, please.�

�Um, yes ... Erica Brown.� she responded, taken a bit off stride by the appellation as she was ushered in.&nbsp; �I guess you were expecting me.�

�Yes, of course.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a very great pleasure to meet you.&nbsp; My name is Raef, and anything that I can do for you while you&#8217;re here please don&#8217;t hesitate to let me know.�

�Well, thank you ... Raef.�

�It would be my privilege.&nbsp; Now, Miss Amy is dying to meet you as well.&nbsp; Let me take you to her in the living room.�


Following him through several immaculately clean, well appointed yet cozy rooms, they finally came to the living room where she was again slightly confounded.&nbsp; While she hadn&#8217;t really anticipated a larger than life, leather clad, booted, whip wielding femme fatale, she wasn&#8217;t quite prepared for the petite, almost pixie-ish, vivacious seeming woman who was seated in an easy chair when they entered, but who bounded up and over to greet her.&nbsp; Erica judged her to be no more than five foot two, slim with wavy brown hair that&nbsp; reached just above her shoulders.&nbsp; Undeniably pretty and cute, she certainly did not exude the severe, elegant appearance that one might have been expecting.&nbsp; She was wearing a powder blue silk blouse with a pleated navy blue skirt that extended just below the knees of her bare legs.&nbsp; Her feet were adorned with a pair of open toed pumps.

�Hi, I&#8217;m Amy.� she said with a huge smile.&nbsp; �It&#8217;s really nice to finally meet the real person behind the computer screen.�

Erica smiled back.&nbsp; �I agree.&nbsp; Yes, I&#8217;m Erica Brown and it&#8217;s very nice to meet you as well.�

�Did you have any trouble finding the place?�

�No, my GPS got me to the cul-de-sac and then your directions guided me home.&nbsp; I might have missed the driveway otherwise.�

�Yes, we are a little off the beaten track back here, but that does have its advantages.&nbsp; I was thinking of having Raef stand at the top of the driveway to wait for you, but I didn&#8217;t want to scare you away.�

�Oh I think that I&#8217;m a bit more resilient that that.&nbsp; And Raef,� turning back to him and smiling, �doesn&#8217;t look all that frightening to me.�

�Well he&#8217;s not of course, but I didn&#8217;t know what you might be expecting so I thought it best to let you just meet us both here.&nbsp; In any event I&#8217;m sure that you&#8217;d like to get started, but before we dive into it, Raef&#8217;s prepared some small refreshments.� she said, indicating a platter of cheese and canapes on the table between two easy chairs.&nbsp; �What would you like to drink to go with it?&nbsp; We have iced tea, sparkling water, soda, even wine or beer if you&#8217;d like.�

�No alcohol.&nbsp; I am at work after all.� she added to make sure it was understood that this wasn&#8217;t a social visit despite appearances, �but a glass of iced tea would be lovely.�

�Great.�&nbsp; Amy turned and nodded to her husband.


�Right away, Ma&#8217;am.� he acknowledged and ventured off immediately.

Amy then guided Erica over to one of the two easy chairs, an overstuffed, very comfortable recliner.&nbsp; After Erica had settled down in it Amy went over to the other chair and sat on the edge.&nbsp; She then picked up the platter of cheese and canapes and offered it to Erica who sampled one, to be polite.&nbsp; A moment later Raef returned with a tray carrying two tall glasses of iced tea, each garnished with a lemon slice and a mint leaf.&nbsp; After serving Erica first and then Amy, he placed the tray on a side table and then came back and knelt down by the side of Amy&#8217;s chair, facing Erica, sitting back on his heels.&nbsp; Amy placed her near hand possessively on the top of his head, then ran her fingers lightly down the back of his neck.&nbsp; Seeing the slightly quizzical look on Erica&#8217;s face, she explained.

�I thought it would be useful to have Raef here with us during the interview in case you had any questions for him along the way.&nbsp; And if we need anything he&#8217;s right here to fetch it for us.&nbsp; Of course, if you mind ...�

�No, no, not at all.�&nbsp; Erica assured her.&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t mind at all.� although she was a bit disconcerted by the scene.&nbsp; Despite his exceedingly pleasant and docile appearance, she couldn&#8217;t quite shake the impression of him in this position as almost like a guard dog.&nbsp; Still, this was part of what she had come to explore first hand.

�Great.&nbsp; Well, I&#8217;m sure that you&#8217;d like to get started.&nbsp; I have to admit that I&#8217;m a little nervous about the whole thing.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve never done anything like this before.�


�It&#8217;s going to be fine.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t bite, believe me.�&nbsp; She then winced internally about making such a reference to a self proclaimed Domme.&nbsp; �I&#8217;d like you to do most of the talking any way.&nbsp; It&#8217;s your story that the readers will be interested in.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll just try to guide the conversation and maybe ask for clarification now and then.�&nbsp; In reality Erica did want Amy to do most of the talking, but she did have a list of general questions in mind to fall back on in case she needed to step in to stop the Domme from potentially hijacking the interview if she happened to go on with a prolonged personal polemic.&nbsp; �As we agreed your names will be changed for the article, as will any personal and specific geographic references, to protect your privacy.�&nbsp; Erica pulled out her tape recorder and placed it on the table.&nbsp; �With your permission I&#8217;d like to tape the interview, both to help with my recollection when I&#8217;m actually writing the piece, and also in the end to protect us all is case any of us feels that anything in the final article isn&#8217;t quite right or doesn&#8217;t represent fairly what was actually said.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ll both get a copy of the transcript.�

�I think that&#8217;s a very good idea.�

�Okay then,� Erica said with a smile as she leaned forward to turn on the recorder.&nbsp; �Shall we begin?�

�Yes.�&nbsp; Amy said a bit hesitantly. �But before you ask any of your questions I&#8217;d like to say something for the record that I want to be sure is stated first and foremost in my part of the written article.�

�Of course Amy.&nbsp; What is it you&#8217;d like to start off by saying?�

Amy took a deep breath.&nbsp; This had not been an easy decision for her, even as she had been the one to make the first contact, and she did want her story to be told.&nbsp; But she had cast her lot and it was time to get on with it, whatever the consequences.

�I just want to make it very clear from the outset, to you and your future readers, that I love my husband with my whole heart and soul, and that his happiness and well being is of the utmost and paramount importance in my life.�&nbsp; She turned her face to look at Raef kneeling beside her and she smiled.&nbsp; �And I know he adores me.� she said as she ran the back of her hand softly across the side of his face, and Erica saw him lean, almost imperceptibly, into it with a dreamy look.&nbsp; 


�The lifestyle and relationship we have and are living today didn&#8217;t happen overnight nor start at the very beginning,� she continued.&nbsp; �We&#8217;ve been together for over ten years and married for eight.&nbsp; We both had our inclinations from the start, and once we came to fully trust one another early on we began to play with them more and more.&nbsp; As time went on however, we began to realize and understand that these inclinations were more than just kink for both of us, that they were a vital part of who and what we are, to ourselves and to each other, and so our relationship began to slowly grow and evolve into what it is today.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re still growing and evolving as we continually discover new things about each other in this lifestyle that make each other tick.&nbsp; But it&#8217;s always from the basis of caring for and about each other, with our love and trust for one another as the bedrock.�&nbsp; She paused almost as if embarrassed.&nbsp; �I just wanted to be sure to make that clear to everyone.� she added softly.&nbsp; She then nodded to herself and smiled once again.&nbsp; �Okay then Erica.&nbsp; Your turn.&nbsp; Fire away.�

Erica had not been expecting that kind of exposition to begin the interview and she was intrigued.&nbsp; But it was as good a place to start as any to begin the exploration.

�Everything you just said in your obviously heartfelt statement, Amy, would seem to be what every &#8216;traditional&#8217; couple would be trying to achieve and aspire to in a relationship.&nbsp; What is it about yours that makes it different?�

Amy took a few moments to collect her thoughts before proceeding.&nbsp; �I guess if I could sum it up with one word it would be &#8216;disparity&#8217;.�

�Disparity?&nbsp; What do you mean by that?�

Another few seconds&nbsp; Then ...

&nbsp; �I think most &#8216;traditional&#8217; couples as you call them approach their relationships trying to achieve some form of equality.&nbsp; Not that they seek or accomplish it in every feature of their lives, but the goal is not to seek primacy over one another in any significant way.&nbsp; Raef and I are just the opposite.&nbsp; We strive and embrace disparity with each other in every way that we can.�

�Can you give me some examples of what you mean?�


�Let me think a moment.� and she then took several more.&nbsp; �Okay,� she finally continued, �I&#8217;ll try to come up with a few.&nbsp; Let me see then ... &#8216; starting slowly, �How about ...� 

� ... I rest, he works ...�

� ... I mess, he cleans ...�

� ... I sit, he kneels ...�

� ... I speak, he listens ...�

� ... He suggests, I decide ...�

� ...&nbsp; I order, he obeys ...�

&nbsp;&nbsp; She paused a moment, then continued, smiling. 

 �... I&#8217;m clothed, he&#8217;s naked ...�

&nbsp; She paused again and her smile grew wider. 

� ... I cum, he doesn&#8217;t ...�&nbsp; 

She tousled his hair affectionately.&nbsp; �That&#8217;s not an exhaustive list of course, but I think it gives you the flavor.&nbsp; And we&#8217;re always looking for new ways in every facet of our lives to further express ourselves this way. But the most important thing to emphasize is that we both do fully embrace and revel in it, and it fuels every aspect of our lives together.�&nbsp; She stopped once again.&nbsp; �Is that enough?�

Erica was bemused for a moment.&nbsp; �More than enough to get started with.� she eventually replied.&nbsp; �Why don&#8217;t we begin with one of the simpler examples.&nbsp; You said that you&#8217;re clothed and he&#8217;s naked, but I can&#8217;t help but notice how smartly dressed he is at the moment.�

Amy laughed.


�I guess that I have implied that we live this lifestyle 24/7, and in very real ways we do, but in general we only do it overtly in private.&nbsp; The greater part of our lives are spent in public.&nbsp; The large majority of our many friends, and all of our family members, as far as we know, live vanilla lives.&nbsp; We share a great many happy and enjoyable times with all of them, and it wouldn&#8217;t be polite or particularly nice for us to be &#8216;in-your-face&#8217; with them about our orientation.&nbsp; Nor would it be prudent.&nbsp; Raef is a highly successful executive in his company, the youngest Vice President in his firm.&nbsp; He&#8217;s well thought of, well liked, and necessarily hard charging in his profession.&nbsp; When we&#8217;re out together in the public he&#8217;s allowed to be forward, to speak first if necessary, to voice his opinions to others without my leave, and to appear to make expected decisions which don&#8217;t involve me, on his own.&nbsp; He is always respectful and solicitous of me in these circumstances however, and I happily play the partner wife.&nbsp; But the &#8216;real&#8217; Raef is always on call.&nbsp; It only takes a certain look from me for him to know that he needs to defer to me immediately, and we have a code word that signals to him that his instant obedience, while not to be made obvious, is nonetheless required.�

Amy stopped for a sip of her iced tea.

�But to get back to your original question.&nbsp; Yes, when we&#8217;re home alone I do like to have Raef naked much if not most of the time.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think anything quite so visibly reinforces our relative stations than the fact that I can and do wear whatever I want, whenever I want, and he has no rights to any attire at all without my consent.�&nbsp; 

Her ever present smile grew even larger. 

 �And maybe the more important reason is that I truly savor the sight of his body and being able to oogle it any time that I desire.&nbsp; You may not realize how extremely fit and trim he is, and I keep him on a strict diet and workout regimen to keep him so.&nbsp; I&#8217;m also a very touchy-feely person and I especially like being able to pinch a nipple, or give him a crisp smack on the butt whenever I&#8217;m passing by ... or whenever I feel like it for that matter.&nbsp; I also really enjoy idly fondling my &#8216;jewels&#8217; when I&#8217;m sitting here reading a book or talking on the phone with a friend or whatever, and he&#8217;s kneeling by my side holding my drink or waiting to take care of any other need that I might have.�


Amy paused once again, a far away look in her eyes, and seemingly unconsciously began softly caressing the back of her husband&#8217;s neck.&nbsp; After a few moments though she snapped her attention back to Erica.

�You might be wondering then why he&#8217;s not naked now even though we&#8217;re here at home.&nbsp; Well, even though you&#8217;re well aware of our orientation and lifestyle, this is still a somewhat public situation we&#8217;re in, and I had no idea what your sensibilities might be, so I thought that it would have been very rude and insensitive of me to impose and flaunt something like that in front of you.�&nbsp; She now smiled brightly again.&nbsp; �But if it&#8217;s something you think you might enjoy, I&#8217;d be more than happy to have him strip for you.�

�No, no, that won&#8217;t be necessary at all.�&nbsp; Erica hastily broke in.&nbsp; She sought to rapidly, but subtly shift the focus of this particular topic.

�One of the things that I&#8217;ve read about is that a lot of Dommes like to dress up men in women&#8217;s clothes, to feminize or sissify them.&nbsp; What are your thoughts on that?�

Amy sat back in her chair, pursed her lips, and chose her words carefully.

�I certainly don&#8217;t pretend to speak for all Dommes, or that Raef and I in any way represent all D/s relationships.&nbsp; I guess that if some Dommes are into a form of gender-type reversal, and the Domme likes to be more &#8216;masculine&#8217; and dress like it, and then likewise feminize and even sissify her male, there might be something to that.�&nbsp; 

She frowned for the first time of the afternoon.&nbsp; 

�To each Domme her own of course, but I have to admit that I just don&#8217;t get that.&nbsp; I AM a woman and proud of it.&nbsp; I like to be feminine and alluring ... even sexy, and dress appropriately to show it.&nbsp; If the Woman is supposed to be the ideal, of the highest order as it is and should be, how is it in any way humiliating for a male to be dressed in her clothing.&nbsp; To me that would exalt him and grant him a status that is in no way warranted.�

&nbsp; 
She now sat forward again and her buoyant smile returned.&nbsp; 

�As I said before, I like my boy manly and buff.�&nbsp; She patted her husband on his head.&nbsp; �... and for the most part in the buff.�

�So am I to take all of that to mean that you think that women are inherently superior to men?�

�Not at all.&nbsp; In the outside world we are all equal under the sun, and all should be treated as such .&nbsp; But in our &#8216;real&#8217; private world, where we all live the lives that we want to live, we all have our specific roles to play.&nbsp; Some are meant to rule and others to serve.&nbsp; And more and more women are naturally gravitating to the first, while many more men are coming to understand that they are more suited for the latter.&nbsp; This doesn&#8217;t make one superior and the other inferior, or in any way better or worse as people.&nbsp; But if a couple can come to accept and embrace this as the natural order of their being, that there is no longer a question in their relationship as to primacy, then there will never be any further battles over primacy, with the ongoing contentions, stress and arguments that always accompany it.&nbsp; Instead there is happiness and contentment as both take pride and joy in fulfilling their acknowledged and accepted roles.�

Now it was Erica&#8217;s turn to sit back for a moment.&nbsp; She had to concede that there was a certain internal logic to the ideas that Amy espoused, even as it flew in the face of everything that Erica believed.&nbsp; But she wasn&#8217;t here to debate.&nbsp; She was here to gather information for her readers.&nbsp; She suspected that as she delved deeper, Amy&#8217;s self proclaimed utopian vision would begin to show cracks and fall apart.&nbsp; She leaned forward again to continue.

�You certainly present an enticing picture.� she admitted, �but let&#8217;s get on to the nitty gritty of it&#8217;s everyday existence.&nbsp; If we could move on to another one of your examples.&nbsp; You say that &#8216;you speak and he listens&#8217;.&nbsp; You also mentioned before that in public you allow him a certain measure of ... unencumbered speech, if you will. Am I to take it then that at home, in private, he has to remain silent?�


�Of course not.� Amy protested with a bit of a snort.&nbsp; �Raef is the most intelligent, interesting, entertaining, and the funniest person I have ever been around.&nbsp; I love listening to him and getting his thoughts and opinions at length, and interacting and debating with him on any number of subjects.&nbsp; But there is something to be said, and greatly desired, to have any of that occur only at times and places of my choosing and with my permission.&nbsp; So no, Raef doesn&#8217;t speak without my permission, but I give it often and usually enjoy it very much when I do.&nbsp; It&#8217;s also nice to know that he will stop immediately when I tell him that I&#8217;ve had enough.&nbsp; I want and need him to have freedom of thought and speech, but only at those times that I grant it.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m a bit of a chatterbox myself, and there&#8217;s nothing like being able to go on and on about anything at all on my mind, and having the most important person in my life raptly hanging onto my every word.�&nbsp; Amy ended that thought with a soft sigh.

�So I guess that&#8217;s what you meant when you said that &#8216;he suggests but you decide&#8217;.�

�Yes of course.&nbsp; As I said, he is the brightest person I know.&nbsp; I&#8217;d be a fool not to solicit and value his opinions and advice, and I often follow it, and even at times I find that he can change my mind.&nbsp; But the final decision on everything is mine, and once I make it he knows to toe the line.�

�Thus then, &#8216;you order and he obeys&#8217;.�

�Exactly.&nbsp; Without question.�

�And does that also extend to you having complete control over all of the financial aspects of your relationship?&nbsp; You having all the money and assets, and he having none?�


Amy smirked.&nbsp; �I know that might be popular with some Dommes, but that&#8217;s not at all what our relationship is about.&nbsp; And why should I have to worry about the grunt work of accounting.&nbsp; He&#8217;s much better suited for that type of thing anyway.&nbsp; I do set the broad parameters, but I also allow him a fair degree of freedom in discretionary spending.&nbsp; He is a very responsible person after all, and he does have a very important position to maintain in the outside world.&nbsp; I do require him to report it all back to me though, in minute detail.&nbsp; And of course he does cede final authority to me for any major expenditures.�

�It all sounds so neat and tidy.&nbsp; But I can&#8217;t believe that there aren&#8217;t times of disagreement, when he feels put upon and just can&#8217;t handle everything that you demand.�

Amy pursed her lips as she considered her reply.

�Well, nobody&#8217;s perfect.&nbsp; Naturally there are times when he doesn&#8217;t quite meet my expectations, when he&#8217;s tired and cranky and doesn&#8217;t want to do what&#8217;s required of him.&nbsp; And he might quietly whine and moan, and, if he thinks he&#8217;s out of sight and earshot, he might even actually grumble and complain and be a bit laggard in his duties.&nbsp; Those are the times that he has to be firmly reminded that this is all part of the deal, that his submission and service are not just when he feels up to it, but all of the time, under all circumstances, however and for whatever I decree.&nbsp; Those are the times that require discipline.&nbsp; From me, and for him.�

�By discipline I take it you mean punishment.�

�That may at times be a necessary part of it.�

�Well, I&#8217;d like to get back to that in a moment, but first I have to ask.&nbsp; If he&#8217;s out of sight and out of earshot, how do you know when he&#8217;s complaining or rebelling?�

The smile returned to Amy&#8217;s lips.

�I think I&#8217;ve come up with a pretty good solution for that.&nbsp; I actually got the idea from an interesting fictional D/s story I once read, and I&#8217;ve made it a regular event and ritual for us.&nbsp; Once a week, Raef comes and kneels before me and confesses all of his transgressions and mistakes of the prior week.&nbsp; Depending on the number and severity I then determine an appropriate penance for him.�


�But if many, if not most of these &#8216;transgressions&#8217; are committed out of your sight and without your knowledge, how can you know that he&#8217;s being fully forthcoming?�

�Ah, that&#8217;s the ingenious part of it, as the story made clear.&nbsp; Raef never can be sure what I do and don&#8217;t know, and if he ever leaves anything out, however insignificant, well, let&#8217;s just say that his &#8216;penance&#8217; will be more than appropriately amplified.&nbsp; So I think you can see why he always makes every effort to be as comprehensive as possible in detailing his faults to me.�

�And by penance I guess you mean punishment.&nbsp; Do you ...�&nbsp; Erica glanced at the kneeling Raef and internally winced but she had to ask, 
� ... whip him?�

�Oh Good God, no.�&nbsp; Amy responded, truly aghast.&nbsp; She took a second to compose herself.&nbsp; She finally continued.&nbsp; �Look, I realize that many people may think that S&amp;M is part and parcel of every D/s relationship, and maybe for some it is.&nbsp; But even in those cases I think that it&#8217;s more of a particular kink that they indulge in, rather than the primary focus of the relationship.&nbsp; And I suspect it&#8217;s the male masochists that are the driving force there.&nbsp; I find it very hard to believe that there are very many people, including most Dommes, who truly like to inflict significant pain just for pain&#8217;s sake.&nbsp; Oh maybe a little spanking or paddling as a part of foreplay, but that&#8217;s play, not punishment.&nbsp; Punishment, when administered in this regard is meant purely and simply to ensure proper service.&nbsp; I suppose that with some people this could be corporeal in nature, but I&#8217;m not into that kind of thing at all.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t like or want to ever cause anyone real physical pain, most especially the one whom I love.&nbsp; Discomfort can be part of my discipline process, but I think that the mental, more so than physical discomfort better drives home what needs to be contemplated.�


�I have a whole variety of suitable punishments that I use depending on the level and number of transgressions.&nbsp; It can be as simple as forbidding him from watching a sporting event on TV that he had been looking forward to.&nbsp; I also find corner time to be an effective tool.&nbsp; There&#8217;s nothing like having him kneeling naked in the corner, hands on top of the head, with his nose pressed up against the wall for an hour or two to help him focus on his failures.&nbsp; Revoking other desired privileges can also work very well.&nbsp; As he is my husband and love bunny, I do want and allow him to sleep with me each night, cuddled together.&nbsp; But if I&#8217;m particularly perturbed by something some evening there&#8217;s nothing like having him spend the night on the floor at the foot of my bed, with a thin blanket to keep out the cold, but no pillow.&nbsp; The next morning usually finds him much more compliant than ever.�

�For those very rare but more serious lapses, adding a substantial amount of totally useless labor to his already extensive schedule of necessary chores usually does the trick.&nbsp; Our rather large woodpile outside has been moved from one side of our property to the other several times over the years for example.�

�These &#8216;disciplines&#8217; that you describe seem to involve&nbsp; heavy doses of humiliation.�&nbsp; Erica interjected.&nbsp; �Isn&#8217;t humiliation part of the allure for a submissive, and doesn&#8217;t that sort of defeat the purpose of the punishment?�

�You&#8217;re right of course.&nbsp; It is indeed true that humiliation can be quite enjoyable for both Domme and sub when it&#8217;s part of playtime.� Amy responded.&nbsp; �When it comes to punishment though, while the humiliation might initially be somewhat&nbsp; titillating, it doesn&#8217;t take long in the corner before the knees start to growl, the nose starts to itch, and the crushing boredom begins.&nbsp; Or for the entire body to stiffen when trying to sleep on a hardwood floor.&nbsp; Or the arms, back and legs begin to ache and throb when uselessly toting and stacking logs from one end of the yard to the other.&nbsp; Believe me, any possible excitement fades very rapidly, and the lessons being taught are quickly learned under those circumstances.�

�But what you really need to understand though, Erica, is that my husband truly wants to be the best servant to me that he can be.&nbsp; That is what makes him happy and content.&nbsp; He thus relies on such direction and structure from me to help him achieve it .&nbsp; For most men in your &#8216;traditional&#8217; marriages the &#8216;Honey Do&#8217; list is treated&nbsp; with derision and scorn, and as something to be avoided for as long as possible.&nbsp; For Raef, his daily &#8216;Honey Do&#8217; list has become something of a Holy Writ.� 


Amy now stopped, almost as if to catch her breath, and looked down at her now empty glass of iced tea.

�Well I must say that I&#8217;m a bit parched after all of that, and it appears that I could use a refill of my drink.�&nbsp; She looked over at Erica&#8217;s also empty glass.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �And it looks as if you could as well.&nbsp; What do you say that we take a short break while Raef attends to that.�

Erica nodded assent.&nbsp; She needed some time to digest everything that had transpired so far, and this would allow her to refocus her thoughts for what she was sure would prove to be the thornier issues and questions to come.

And Raef scrambled up to scurry off to see to the ladies&#8217; further refreshment.&nbsp; 

 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 










Interview Part Two.


When in short order Raef returned carrying two freshly refilled glasses of iced tea Erica couldn&#8217;t help but note that there was nothing servile in his demeanor, but more a sense in him of delighted privilege.&nbsp; He served her first, and when she thanked him he responded with a slight bow of his head and a smile.&nbsp; When he then offered the second glass to his wife, Erica noticed that as she took it Amy barely glanced at him and continued uninterrupted with her small talk.&nbsp; Erica&nbsp; realized that Raef&#8217;s was not the act of a gracious host, but one of expected everyday service, which appeared to require no acknowledgment or any expression of gratitude.&nbsp; As he resumed his kneeling post at Amy&#8217;s side,&nbsp; Erica thought that this would be a good place to ease into the second part of the interview.&nbsp; After receiving the okay from Amy to proceed she turned the tape recorder back on.

�So then Amy, getting back to some of the examples you gave at the beginning, you indicated that &#8216;you mess and he cleans&#8217;, and that &#8216;he works while you rest&#8217;.&nbsp; Do I take that to mean that he does all the work around the house?�

�Let&#8217;s just say that all of the domestic chores are his responsibility.� Amy replied.&nbsp; �But I fully recognize that he has a very demanding and responsible job in the outside world, and that there are only so many hours in the day.&nbsp; He has to maintain a very tight schedule to get everything done and his leisure time, which I minutely manage, is extremely limited.&nbsp; But I do want to keep him healthy and fit.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t want him breaking down on me.&nbsp; I&nbsp; realize that he does need some down time, both physically and mentally, so I do pitch in to help when I see that it&#8217;s necessary.&nbsp; We do want to make this all work in real life.�


�And actually, I do enjoy doing a number of what might be considered by some to be chores.&nbsp; I like cooking, and while Raef is a very good cook himself, and frequently makes our meals on the weekends, I usually, if not most of the time, cook dinner during the week.&nbsp; Cleaning up afterwards is always his job however.&nbsp; But when I see things that need to get done, and I know that there&#8217;s no possible way he&#8217;s going to be able to get to it, I&#8217;m certainly not above helping out.�&nbsp; She reached out to brush the back of her fingers along the back of his neck as she smiled benignly once again.&nbsp; �For which he is always sincerely grateful.�

Amy now suddenly beamed.&nbsp; �But speaking of my rest and his work, let me tell you that there&#8217;s nothing quite like spending a hot and sunny Saturday afternoon lying in my bikini on my chaise lounge in the yard, with a tall cool drink, reading a book but stealing long glances at Raef, dressed only in his cutoffs and sneakers, his skin glistening with sweat as he trims the hedges, hand mows and manicures the lawn, and weeds the garden, his only breaks coming when he refills my drink, or gets me a snack, or moves my lounger into the sun so that I can sunbathe, and then back into the shade so I can rest and read.&nbsp; Oh, I might allow him a little pleasurable downtime kneeling at the end of my chaise kneading and pampering my feet, but most of the rest of his afternoon is spent toiling in the hot sun for my amusement as I lounge.&nbsp; You can&#8217;t imagine what a rush that all is.�

�It does sound ... astonishing.�

�It truly is.&nbsp; But I also have to tell you that no matter how delightful it is never having to be concerned with the daily domestic drudgery, it&#8217;s the personal services that Raef provides that I appreciate the most.�

�Personal services?� 

�Yes.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve trained him to become quite the masseuse.&nbsp; His total body massages are to die for.&nbsp; I insist on having one at least once a week and sometimes even more often.&nbsp; And nothing is more soothing than his evening foot massages which he also provides for me each night while I&#8217;m watching TV.�&nbsp; Amy stopped for a second to silently enjoy her contemplation.&nbsp; �And his pedicures are better than any you could ever receive at any spa.� she finally declared.

For some reason this last one, as Erica cast a glance at the muscular, rock-solid, no-doubt-about-it, masculine appearing Raef, seemed to be beyond her ability to envision.


�Pedicure? ...&nbsp; Somehow I have a great deal of difficulty visualizing that.�

�Well then why don&#8217;t I have him give you one right now.�

�No, that really won&#8217;t be necessary.�

�Why not?&nbsp; It would add some very mild but real hands on experience so to speak, on what we&#8217;ve been talking about.&nbsp; It would lend a nice personal touch for the article to relate to your readers.&nbsp; And we can continue our conversation while it&#8217;s going on.&nbsp; What do you say?�

Put that way, despite Erica&#8217;s very clear reluctance, it did make some sense and seem reasonable.&nbsp; And it had been ages since she had been to the nail salon.

�Well, okay then, if you don&#8217;t think he&#8217;d mind.�

 �Mind?&nbsp; Not in the least.&nbsp; Excellent_�&nbsp; Amy turned to her husband.&nbsp; �Raef_� was all she said.

�Right away, Ma&#8217;am.� he answered as he rose quickly and briskly departed.&nbsp; Little more than a minute later he returned carrying a basin of water, a soft sponge, a towel, and a black case.&nbsp; The easy chair in which Erica was sitting was actually a recliner, and Raef politely bid her to settle back so that the leg rest came up to the horizontal with her legs resting upon it.&nbsp; He put all of his paraphernalia on the floor, sank to his knees before her, and softly asked her permission to remove her pumps.

Erica was suddenly mortified about the condition of her feet.&nbsp; Being a runner, she was significantly callused, and she hadn&#8217;t been joking about how long it had been since her last visit to a salon.&nbsp; Several of her nails were chipped, and her most recent self applied nail polish was uneven and already growing out.&nbsp; She felt extremely self conscious about being so exposed.&nbsp; But it would be even more embarrassing, she reluctantly concluded, to back out now.&nbsp; She gave a grim nod.


Raef carefully removed her footwear and set them aside.&nbsp; His first order of business was to take out a pumice stone from the case and set to work on her calluses.&nbsp; An athlete himself, he recognized their necessity so he did not try to substantially pare them down, but he did smooth down the rough and heavy edges and contour them more fully with the natural lines of each foot.&nbsp; Next he used a clipper to even out all of the chipped nails, and then filed each one until they all were of the same shape.&nbsp; When this task was finished he dipped the sponge into the warm water and meticulously dabbed and cleansed both of her feet before toweling them dry.&nbsp; Then, after rubbing in a bit of scented lotion to each, he gently placed small cotton balls between each of her toes.&nbsp; Once this was completed he leaned back on his knees, picked up and opened the case more fully, and looked up at Erica, presenting her the contents as he spoke for the first time since starting.

�What color would you like Miss Erica?� he asked with a bright and engaging smile.

Erica had become silently absorbed and increasingly fascinated by Raef&#8217;s ardent ministrations.&nbsp; It had been a far more pleasurable experience thus far than she could ever have anticipated.&nbsp; She looked down at the dozen offered choices of nail polish, and felt a few more inhibitions whither away.

�Why don&#8217;t we try the Midnight Moon Violet.� she finally answered with a bemused grin of her own.

His smile broadened even more, giving every impression that he fully believed that she had made the absolute right choice.&nbsp; To her surprise this gave her a delightfully warm feeling inside, leaving her more than a little nonplused.

Amy, who had been quietly and enjoyably immersed in observing the proceedings herself, now broke through the shared reverie.

�While Raef finishes up making your feet even more beautiful, why don&#8217;t we continue with our conversation.�


Erica struggled to bring herself back into focus.&nbsp; It was going to be difficult to maintain her concentration with that gorgeous hunk of a man now applying himself so intently to her toes.&nbsp; But this was what professionals had to do, and she realized that the time had come to broach the difficult subject that she had been avoiding to this point.&nbsp; For reasons that she couldn&#8217;t quite explain, the circumstances in which she now found herself, with Raef applying the polish oh so carefully to each of her nails, seemed to make this line of inquiry even more difficult.

�I must say, Amy, that you&#8217;ve certainly presented this entire lifestyle scenario as very intriguing and even enticing.&nbsp; But I do have to ask now about the ...&nbsp; sexual elements.&nbsp; The last example that you gave early on in outlining some of the parameters of your relationship was that ... ah ... &#8216;you cum ... and that he doesn&#8217;t&#8217;.&nbsp; Does that mean that you keep him permanently celibate and never grant him any relief?&nbsp; And if so, do you have to enforce that by having him wear one of those male chastity devices I&#8217;ve read about?�

Amy actually giggled.

�No and no.� she finally responded.&nbsp; �To answer the second part of your question first, I&#8217;ve never seen the need, nor taken to the concept of chastity cages.&nbsp; I&#8217;m quite enamored with the almost constant reality of my &#8216;little soldier&#8217; standing up at full attention for me while my &#8216;big soldier&#8217; bustles about doing my bidding.&nbsp; I take it not only as a sign of respect and devotion, but I have no doubt that it also serves as a continual stimulant to his perpetual desire to please me in any way that he can.&nbsp; Why would I ever want to suppress and compress those urges within the confines of some plastic contrivance.�

She paused for a moment.


�Of course there are some practical problems with this approach.&nbsp; The biggest one is the prodigious amount of precum he can produce in that state.&nbsp; It certainly doesn&#8217;t do to have him dribbling and dripping all over the place.&nbsp; Fortunately I&#8217;ve easily solved this issue.&nbsp; I told you before that I keep him naked much of the time when we&#8217;re alone, but I now have to admit that he&#8217;s not completely so.&nbsp; I always have him wear a condom while he&#8217;s that way.&nbsp; I have a number of different brightly colored ones to suit my mood of the day.&nbsp; It&#8217;s amazing what a load of goo he can accumulate in it over the course of an evening.�

Amy leaned forward and pinched one of Raef&#8217;s earlobes and continued in a mock, Mommy-like stern voice.

�Sometimes though, he&#8217;s a bad boy and gets over stimulated and has an accident.�&nbsp; She gave his earlobe a tug.&nbsp; �It&#8217;s usually a ruined accident as neither one of us wants it to happen, so whatever stimulation there might have been is instantly withdrawn&nbsp; and he derives no pleasure from it.&nbsp; Any such enjoyment he is ever allowed from such emissions is always solely at my discretion.&nbsp; But with these &#8216;unauthorized&#8217; episodes he then does go on to slowly and joylessly ooze out quite a bag full.&nbsp; He&#8217;s always very ashamed and remorseful, but I do have to let my displeasure over his breach be known, so he does have to be punished for it.�

She gave his earlobe another firm tug.

�I find that taping the open end of the full bag around the tip of&nbsp; his nose and letting it hang down from there until the next morning is an effective way to concentrate his attention on maintaining control.&nbsp; Especially as it becomes one of those nights that he then has to spend sleeping on the floor.�

Erica tried hard to get her head around this picture.&nbsp; Amy suddenly snickered gaily again and let go of Raef&#8217;s ear, and he immediately bent back to finish painting the last toe of Erica&#8217;s first foot before moving on to the other.


�But you were primarily interested in our actual sex life.�&nbsp; She continued. �Let me say first and foremost the Raef IS my husband.&nbsp; I do strongly desire and wish for his health and happiness.&nbsp; Part of achieving this for him does necessarily involve some conjugal activities such as intercourse.&nbsp; And I must readily admit that I do very much enjoy those myself , and sometimes even crave them.&nbsp; But always at a time and place of my choosing, as a special reward for him, or as a whim of the moment for me.&nbsp; I absolutely control when and if.&nbsp; He has come to not have any expectations, but they do occur just enough for him to constantly strive to remain in my good graces, for as I said before, he&#8217;s only ever allowed any enjoyable release by my permission.�

�Unfortunately for him, although I do enjoy intercourse I don&#8217;t require it all that often.&nbsp; I much prefer other forms of intimate stimulation.&nbsp; And it is no exaggeration to say that Raef has the most amazing, talented and inventive tongue and fingers that anyone can possibly imagine.&nbsp; So much more creative than his cock.&nbsp; And I indulge myself with those at every possible opportunity, oftentimes several times a day and night.�

Amy&#8217;s eyes now glazed.

�Can you even conceive of the endless thrill of having the one whom you love and desire more than anything in the world, at any moment of your want and need, at the very snap of your fingers, have him drop everything that he is doing to rush forward, fall to his knees before you, and bury his face between your thighs.&nbsp; And that you can direct him in any way that you like ... slow and sensuous ... hard and fast ... or allow him free rein to discover new and even more exhilarating ways to bring you higher and higher.�

Her voice became even more feverish.

�His oral adoration of my bum hole can be so special and sweet, but as his fingers and tongue search and explore my other most treasured orifice ... probing and caressing ... invading and cajoling ... and finally churning so intensely, so deeply within that I&#8217;m taken to heights I never before could have fathomed ... and just when I think that I can take no more, I explode, and rain forth my juices seemingly forever as I scream and cry almost helplessly throughout.�

She closed her eyes for a moment, took a calming breath, and then reopened them.


�And the beauty of it all,� she sighed contentedly, �is that there is absolutely NO pressure.&nbsp; NO need or expectation for ANY reciprocity on my part.&nbsp; Unless I so desire.�

Her faraway look now softened and refocused as she gazed down at her still toiling husband.&nbsp; A small smile played on her lips.

�Happily for Raef, I sometimes do so desire.�

Erica sat spellbound, swept up by the scenario of Amy&#8217;s &#8216;stirring&#8217; presentation.&nbsp; She had also marveled during this discourse that except for a slight trembling of his hand holding her foot, Raef had remained unerring with his painted strokes.&nbsp; She was finally brought back down to earth by the sensation of warm air wafting across her toes as Raef blew on them to help finish drying her nails before delicately removing the cotton balls between each of her toes.&nbsp; He then sat back on his heels again and glanced up at her with an anxious smile.&nbsp; Erica looked down and was dumbfounded.&nbsp; Her feet really were beautiful.&nbsp; Amy had been right.&nbsp; She had never had so exquisite a pedicure.

�Raef, I can&#8217;t believe it.&nbsp; My feet have never looked so fabulous.� she enthused.&nbsp; �Thank you so very much.�

�Oh, there&#8217;s no need to thank him.� Amy interjected.&nbsp; �After all, I was the one who offered to have it done.�&nbsp; She shrugged and sighed.&nbsp; �But if you really feel it necessary to bestow some small token of appreciation you can reward him if you wish ... as I do when I&#8217;m feeling overly generous.�

�How so?�

�You can allow him to pay homage to his handiwork.�&nbsp; Amy saw the puzzled look on Erica&#8217;s face.&nbsp; �You can allow him the exalted honor of being allowed to ...� she smiled regally, � ... kiss your feet.�

Even an hour earlier, such a consideration and thought would have been, without a doubt, utterly out of the question.&nbsp; But after what all had transpired since, Erica couldn&#8217;t help but feel that it seemed so ... right.

�Is that what you would like, Raef?� she asked softly.

�It would be a reward far greater than my service deserves.� he responded quietly.&nbsp; �But yes, it would be an honor and privilege that I would always cherish.�

Erica nodded.&nbsp; �By all means then.&nbsp; You have my blessing.�&nbsp; She couldn&#8217;t stop herself from wiggling her toes for emphasis.

Raef closed his eyes for a long moment, and then reopened them before slowly bending forward and down to place his lips gently on the top of her nearest foot.&nbsp; He then moved over to do the same with her other foot.&nbsp; Using both of his hands he lifted that foot up slightly and softly kissed the tips of each of her toes, and then did the same again with her other.

Erica couldn&#8217;t quite apprehend the aura and emotion that was welling up within her as Raef continued this veneration.&nbsp; It was so sensuous and intimate, but not in a sexual way.&nbsp; It was more like a reverence.&nbsp; Here was a man, who could be as much as ten years her senior, who was a high level executive and professional, for all she knew it could possibly be in her very own news corporation.&nbsp; A man of obvious intellect and power.&nbsp; And here he was, on his knees before her, having spent the last thirty minutes of his existence with no other thought or purpose in his life during that time other than his personal care and devotion to her feet.&nbsp; And now, in gratitude for being so allowed, he was worshiping and adoring them.&nbsp; And her.&nbsp; The sensation was undeniably intoxicating.


Erica remained thus entranced even after Raef had finished his adoration and resumed his place on his knees by Amy&#8217;s side.&nbsp; The alluring silence and sensibility seemed to stretch on for hours, but in actuality was only a few minutes.&nbsp; Erica shook herself internally to bring herself back to her own reality.&nbsp; Once again she had to admit that this had all been so very different from everything she had expected and anticipated.&nbsp; But she now almost forlornly realized that her major objection, her biggest concern about the entire lifestyle and relationship had yet to be raised.&nbsp; She suddenly felt a great difficulty and ambivalence about doing so.&nbsp; In the very short time she had known them, little more than two hours&nbsp; really, she had already come to like both Amy and Raef very much, and didn&#8217;t want to seem to be disparaging of them in any way.&nbsp; But she had to know.&nbsp; Back to being the intrepid journalist.

�Amy, this has all been a very compelling case for the validity of the femdom lifestyle in general, and your particular relationship with Raef within it.&nbsp; It seems a potent combination of power and perks that appears almost irresistible to pass up if offered.&nbsp; And as hard as it is for me to comprehend how, I can even see that it might be satisfying and fulfilling at times for those like Raef.�

�You have also made it abundantly clear that as with any successful relationship of any kind, love and trust are absolutely essential parts of its foundation.&nbsp; And I have come to have no doubt now that both are alive and vital in the bond between the two of you.&nbsp; But I wonder, and I believe many readers may as well, whether another equally crucial element to the long term success and stability of a relationship may very well be lacking and be a critical shortcoming and failing in an arrangement such as yours.�

�And what element might that be?� Amy asked with a small and wary smile.

Here it goes, Erica thought despondently.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t want to so markedly challenge Amy and her life, but the issue had to be addressed.

�Respect.� she responded resolutely.&nbsp; �I think that real and unfettered respect for one&#8217;s partner may ultimately be every bit as important for the lasting viability of a committed relationship as love and trust.&nbsp; And I think that in this case it is more a particular problem for you, the Domme.&nbsp; I have great difficulty seeing how anyone could maintain, if it was ever present at all, respect for someone, especially a life partner, who is by the very nature of the relationship so very ... weak.�

For the first time of the entire afternoon Amy evidenced real anger.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �WEAK?_?_ ...&nbsp; You think that Raef is Weak?&nbsp; Haven&#8217;t you understood anything of what I&#8217;ve been trying to relate to you all day?&nbsp; My husband is anything but Weak.�


Her eyes flashed with fury, as she blazed ahead.

�He&#8217;s almost twice my size, but I have no physical shackles or chains on him.&nbsp; As I made clear before, I put no financial constraints on him.&nbsp; I do not blackmail or threaten him in any way.&nbsp; I may dictate the entire sum and substance of his sexual being, but I place no mechanical encumbrances to enforce it.&nbsp; All of this is entirely within his control.&nbsp; He is free and able to put an end to any and all of it at any time he might choose.&nbsp; That he doesn&#8217;t is due purely and solely to his resolute and steadfast character.&nbsp; That, and his overarching and unyielding desire to please me.&nbsp; I am the center of his universe.&nbsp; His greatest happiness is making me happy no matter what it takes or what he has to endure.�

She took a long shuddering breath before proceeding with increasing vehemence.

�Raef is my husband ... my Boy ... My SLAVE ...�

&nbsp; A bit softer. 
 
� ... But he&#8217;s also my Stud, my Protector, My Knight in Shining Armor ... My Hero.� 

 Softer still.&nbsp; 

� ... My Lover and My Love ...�

� My Best Friend.�

&nbsp; Back to vehemence.


�To be ALL of that and more, with all which that entails, every minute of every day, requires a strength and fortitude, a power of will that is almost beyond measure.&nbsp; That he lays all of that strength and will ... voluntarily ... at my feet, to be used how so ever I wish, is a gift of almost incalculable worth, made more so especially as it is so freely given .&nbsp; It is a gift that also needs to be continuously cared for and nourished, and THAT is a responsibility which I take very seriously.&nbsp; I may be the driving and controlling force in our relationship, but it is Raef&#8217;s strength and will, as much as his love and trust, that is the bedrock that sustains it, against ANY and ALL demands, and allows us both to be what we want to be, and live the lives we both want to live.�

She paused for emphasis.

�Respect him, you ask? ...&nbsp; I AM IN AWE OF HIM.�

Erica sat, stunned.&nbsp; This was beyond anything she could have ever believed.&nbsp; As the silence hung in the air she now felt that she only had one more question.&nbsp; And it wasn&#8217;t for the Domme.

�Amy,� she finally spoke up, �I really have only one more thing to ask, and I&#8217;d like to address it to Raef.�

�Of course.�&nbsp; Amy replied, calming herself down.&nbsp; �That&#8217;s one of the reasons I&#8217;ve had him here for us the whole time.�

Erica looked down at Raef, a clearly magnificent specimen of a man, whom she felt that virtually any woman upon first glance would like to get to know better.&nbsp; And she had to have the answer.

�Raef.� she asked quietly.&nbsp; �I can now see, and even somewhat understand, the ongoing attraction and benefits that this lifestyle has for Amy.&nbsp; But except for some occasional, apparently explicitly permitted moments of enjoyment and excitement, what can YOU possibly get out of all of this?�


Though permission to speak had obviously been granted, Raef turned first to look up at his wife, and a wide smile creased his face.&nbsp; After several moments, still gazing at Amy, he responded with absolutely no reticence at all.

�I get to love, serve, worship and adore the most beautiful, the most desirable, the most&nbsp; wonderful person in the whole world.&nbsp; A person who knows and understands me for what I am, and accepts and keeps me all the same.�

He now looked back to Erica.

�It is extremely hard to describe in words for you the amazing high that I experience in the head space where I exist when I&#8217;m serving her.&nbsp; I may not like or enjoy everything that occurs, but isn&#8217;t that true for everyone in every day life?&nbsp; And by giving myself up totally to her, there is no longer any 
conflict, only the peace that comes with complete surrender.&nbsp; To be used by her in any way that she desires, for her own amusement and pleasure, is for me the most exquisite bliss.�

He continued on with&nbsp; passion.&nbsp; �And the miracle of it all is that she loves me unconditionally and cares for me unquestionably, and would do anything to have me be happy.&nbsp; So I will do anything to bring her the most joy that I can.&nbsp; I have placed my well being ... my very being ... in her hands.&nbsp; And there is no place at all that I would rather have it be.&nbsp; I strive every day to do everything that I am able to be worthy of all of this.&nbsp; And of Her.&nbsp; Without any question.�


Raef fell silent and bowed his head, and Erica remained stock still, transfixed.&nbsp; She truly had nothing further to ask.&nbsp; Or to say.&nbsp; As the seconds of silence dragged on it became clear that this time she would not break it.&nbsp; Amy finally seemed to sense this.&nbsp; She leaned forward slightly and quietly asked.

�Do you have everything that you need, Erica?�

After a brief hesitation Erica gave a very small nod.&nbsp; Amy leaned forward and turned off the tape recorder.&nbsp; She then straightened up and asked another, more important question.

�Do &#8216;You&#8217; have everything that You need, Erica?�

After another very long moment, a soft, barely audible reply.

�No.�

Amy placed a hand on Raef&#8217;s shoulder and squeezed slightly.&nbsp; He turned to look up at her again, and a silent communication passed between them.&nbsp; She then turned her attention back.

�You know, Erica,� she began pleasantly, �I don&#8217;t know anything about your personal life, or if there is a Mr Right in it.&nbsp; But if there isn&#8217;t, and you&#8217;re looking, you might want to consider some of the things we&#8217;ve been discussing.�


Erica roused herself a bit out of her daze.&nbsp; �Oh yeah, right.� she replied self scornfully.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m sure that there are any number of guys out there who are just dying to be for me what Raef is for you.&nbsp; Where are they?&nbsp; I&#8217;ve never met any of them.�


�Maybe you&#8217;re just looking in the wrong places, for the wrong person.�&nbsp; Amy responded.&nbsp; She made a decision.&nbsp; �Look,� she continued, �Raef and I&nbsp; don&#8217;t feel the need to go all that often any more, but there are social gatherings of people in the lifestyle.&nbsp; They&#8217;re called munches.&nbsp; They&#8217;re totally non threatening and undemanding.&nbsp; Just a way for people with similar orientations and interests like ours to get together in a comfortable setting to greet old friends, meet new ones, and mingle together sharing companionship.�

She leaned forward again toward Erica.

�There happens to be one next weekend that we were thinking of attending.&nbsp; They&#8217;re usually held at a restaurant but this one is going to be at the home of one of our friends so it will be much more private, and maybe allow a little more freedom of expression, although they&#8217;re always meant to 

be completely non pressurized and social in nature.&nbsp; We&#8217;d love to have you come as our guest.&nbsp; Many of the people who come are committed couples like Raef and I, but there are always a fair number of singles, usually more male subs than prospective Dommes, so you can look to be catered to and treated royally.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ll be there with you to keep a close eye out.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not saying that you&#8217;re going to meet Mr. Right, but I can tell you that we personally know of two couples who met at one and are now in long term, serious relationships.&nbsp; At the very least, if you can keep the reporter in you under wraps, it will give you another opportunity to expand your knowledge and experience with the lifestyle.�&nbsp; She smiled encouragingly.&nbsp; �And once you&#8217;re there ... well ... who knows.�

Amy was certainly right about one thing, Erica reflected.&nbsp; This would be a great chance to further her research and gather more information for the article.&nbsp; But deep inside she suddenly knew that it was far more than that.&nbsp; At the beginning of the day this possibility would never have been believed.&nbsp; But now, for reasons she couldn&#8217;t yet explain, it seemed so ... well, as Amy had said ... who knows.

�I think that I&#8217;d like that very much. � she finally conceded.

�Excellent_�&nbsp; Amy exclaimed. �Raef can make all of the arrangements with you later for us to pick you up ... This is fantastic.&nbsp; I really think that you&#8217;re going to enjoy yourself immensely.&nbsp; Believe me Erica, it&#8217;s a whole new world out there.�&nbsp; 

To that, Erica found she no longer had any argument.&nbsp; And to her great surprise, that she no longer wanted one.

Amy now flashed her most dazzling and inviting smile of the day.&nbsp; And concluded&nbsp; brightly.


�A WHOLE NEW WORLD.�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
