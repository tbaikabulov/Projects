Mary was not in the
best of moods as she tidied round the bedroom. Tom had come in from a business
trip late last night and had left again early this morning. She knew that he
was up for promotion and it was a busy time for him but business always seemed
to come first. They hardly seemed to have any time for each other nowadays and
as for their sex life, it was practically non-existent. She sighed deeply as
she found Tom�s overnight bag next to the bed. He�d just dropped it there when
he came home the previous evening. Naturally he hadn�t put his dirty clothes in
the basket, he seemed to think the washing fairy did that, he�d just grabbed
his toilet bag out of it when he�d got ready for work this morning.

&nbsp;

As she emptied the clothes out of the bag she noticed a
file of papers at the bottom. I hope he
didn�t need this today she
thought to herself. She�d leave it on the kitchen table where he�d see it when
he came home. But, just as she took the file out of the bag, her cat ran
between her legs and she tripped, falling against the bed. The file flew open,
scattering paperwork everywhere. She picked herself up and started to sort out
the papers to put them back in the file and that�s when she found it, the
magazine he�d hidden there.

&nbsp;

Mary was shocked to the core. She was pretty certain that
Tom wasn�t unfaithful but this was almost as bad. The magazine was called
�Bondage Slaves� and featured, on the front cover, a woman dressed in some sort
of skin-tight leather costume with a man kneeling at her feet. It was well
thumbed and the pages dog-eared; this was obviously more than an idle purchase.
Horrified, but curious, she flicked through it. The front cover was mild
compared to the contents; page after page of photographs and stories all on the
same theme, women in various stages of undress abusing men grovelling before
them. Surely this wasn�t what Tom was into? He�d never been the most dominant
of lovers and he�d always liked it when she was on top, but hadn�t given her
any clue about this sort of thing. Could this be the reason why their sex life
had become so infrequent?

&nbsp;

She took the magazine downstairs to throw it in the bin
but, as she got to the kitchen the doorbell rang. She was so flustered she just
threw the magazine on the table and went to the door. When she answered it
Pauline, her next-door neighbour and long time friend, was there. The two of
them had met when Pauline and Garry had moved in six years ago and struck up an
instant friendship. Pauline always seemed so sure of herself, so in control,
and Mary had often found her a true friend when problems arose.

&nbsp;

�Hello, Mary, time for a quick cuppa?� Without waiting for
an answer she breezed past and headed straight for the kitchen. Mary chased her
down the hall trying to stop her but it was too late, Pauline had spotted the
magazine and picked it up �Wow, I never knew you two were into this sort of
stuff!�

&nbsp;

�I�m not! It�s Tom�s. I found it in his bag. It�s
disgusting. Throw it away.� Mary started to cry. �I never knew he was into
things like this, it�s awful. What should I do?�

&nbsp;

�Come on, it�s not that bad.� Pauline gave her a big hug.
�Lots of men are like that. Why don�t you talk to him about it?�

&nbsp;

�I can�t. It�s horrid.�

&nbsp;

�Look, Mary, you love Tom, don�t you?�

&nbsp;

�Not at the moment, I don�t.�

&nbsp;

�Oh yes you do, you�re just a little shocked. Sit down and
I�ll put the kettle on.�

&nbsp;

�But what will I do?� Mary slumped down in a kitchen chair.
�I feel like I don�t want him to ever touch me again.�

&nbsp;

�I know, it�s all a bit much at the moment, isn�t it? But
you�ve got to deal with it; if you don�t it will just fester between you. You
two are far too much in love to let something like this break you up. Anyway,
it�s not all bad news.�

&nbsp;

�What do you mean?� Mary was dumbfounded by how calmly
Pauline was taking all this. She didn�t seem to mind the magazine at all.


�Well Garry likes a bit of S&amp;M from time to time, nothing as extreme as
this, mind you, and I�ve got quite into it. It has its benefits; you get the
housework done and all the oral sex you could want!�

&nbsp;

�What! You and Garry?� Now Mary�s surprise was complete, it
seemed like one revelation after another this morning.

&nbsp;

�Oh, yes. I make him do the housework, he�s getting quite
good at ironing, and afterwards I play with him for a bit. It always ends in
the most fantastic sex.� Pauline gave Mary a long hard look. �When was the last
time you had an orgasm?�

&nbsp;

�I� I don�t know.� Mary�s head was spinning. How could
Pauline be so composed about this. And Garry�Garry of all people! She just
couldn�t picture it. 

&nbsp;

�Well I do. You were telling me the other day it�s been
ages. It�s about time you were looked after properly and if Tom�s been a
naughty boy,� Pauline nodded at the magazine, �I think it�s about time he paid
for it.�

&nbsp;

Mary was confused, her emotions in turmoil. She�d been
expecting her friend to be as shocked as she was but now she was encouraging
her to join in! She thought about how dull her sex life with Tom had become,
how unsatisfied it left her, and if Tom really was into all this then perhaps
she ought to put her distaste to one side and give it a try, to save their
marriage if nothing else. But how? It all looked so complicated, she wouldn�t
know where to begin.

&nbsp;

�But what do I do? I don�t know anything about this.� 

&nbsp;

�Read the magazine, that will give you plenty of ideas, and
when he comes home tonight you tell him what�s what.�

&nbsp;

�I couldn�t read that thing!� Mary was distraught; she
really didn�t know what to do. Pauline was right though, she couldn�t just let
it drop. She thought about confronting Tom, how awkward it would be. If only
she had Pauline�s poise, Pauline�s confidence� Maybe� No, it was a daft idea,
but Pauline seemed to know all about it. Maybe if Pauline showed her the ropes,
just to get her started. Pauline was always so sure of herself and Mary knew
that if she tried on her own she�d make a muck of it, make things worse. 

&nbsp;

�Pauline�� she began. �Pauline. Would you help?�

&nbsp;

�How do you mean?�

&nbsp;

�I don�t think I can cope on my own. Would you be there,
show me how to get started?� 

&nbsp;

�Are you sure?� Pauline was all concern. �I mean this
should be about you and Tom.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, yes I am. Just for the beginning bit, you know the
housework and so on. I wouldn�t know how to ask him to do it.� Now that she had
spoken Mary wanted, no needed, Pauline�s help.

&nbsp;

�Well, if you�re really sure, I mean really, really sure,
I�ll help. Oh, and you don�t ask him to do the housework, you order him to do
it.� 

&nbsp;

�Thank you.� Pauline could hear the relief in Mary�s voice.

&nbsp;

�No problem, what time does Tom get in?�

&nbsp;

�He should be back about seven thirty tonight. He�s got a
meeting in town.�

&nbsp;

�That suits me. Garry�s got a darts match so he�ll be out
early. I�ll come round at six and we�ll get ready. Now, you�re really sure
about this?�

&nbsp;

�Yes.� Mary�s disgust was turning to anger. If Tom liked
being punished he�d see what an angry wife could do! �Yes, I�m completely
sure.�

&nbsp;

------------------------------------

&nbsp;

By six o-clock Mary�s nerves were in tatters. What had she
let herself in for? Pauline had seemed so relaxed about it all but, now it was
almost upon her, Mary was not sure she could go through with it. She was just
about to phone Pauline and call the whole thing off when the doorbell rang.
When she went to the front door to answer it Pauline stood there dressed to
kill. She wore a short skirt, a skimpy top which showed most of her cleavage,
high heels and stockings. She was carrying two bottles of chilled white wine
and a holdall. 

&nbsp;

�You look fantastic!� Mary gasped.

&nbsp;

�Thank you. We need to get you dressed up as well, we can�t
have you looking all frumpy, but first of all how about a little Dutch
courage.� She went through to the kitchen, opened the bottle and filled two
glasses. �Here�s to getting on top!�

&nbsp;

As ever, Mary was swept along by her friend. She accepted a
glass of wine and took a sip. The wine was cool and refreshing and before she
knew it she found she�d drained her glass. Pauline topped it up.

&nbsp;

�Come along, let�s see what�s in your wardrobe. What about
that little black number you wore at Christmas?� They went upstairs to the
bedroom, taking with them their glasses and the open bottle of wine. Pauline
went straight to the wardrobe and, finding the dress, took it out and laid it
on the bed. �Now, what about underwear. Show me what you�ve got.� 

&nbsp;

Mary opened her undies draw and started to rummage through.
It seemed like everything she had was Marks and Sparks plain white cotton,
functional but hardly sexy, but, there at the back, were a black lacy bra and
panties set that Tom had bought her years ago. She�d never seemed to find the
right time to wear them and when she�d tried them on she�d felt a bit tarty,
but when Pauline saw the set she grabbed it from her.

&nbsp;

�Perfect! I knew you�d have something! Come on, let�s get
you dressed, out of those clothes. Have you got any decent shoes?� While
Pauline searched the wardrobe Mary got undressed.

&nbsp;

�Ah, these will do. There�s something about heels that just
turns them on.� Pauline stood up holding a pair of shoes. Mary, by now
completely naked, jumped back and covered herself with her hands. �Oh, don�t be
shy. We�re both girls together and you�ve got a great body, you ought to show
it off more.�

&nbsp;

Mary glanced in the mirror. She wasn�t sure she had a
�great body� at all. She�d kept herself trim but� Pauline came up behind her.

&nbsp;

�You look fantastic, really, you do. Just say to yourself
�I am a powerful confident woman, I�m in charge�. Come on, say it.�

&nbsp;

�I am a powerful confident woman, I�m in charge.� Mary
repeated nervously. Pauline took her arms and gently guided them down to her
sides.

&nbsp;

�Hmm, you�re a little bushy down there, we�ll have to give
you a trim. There�s not enough time for a shave, and anyway, it�s far too
itchy. Where�re your scissors?� Mary had never considered trimming her pubic
hair before but Pauline, in this mood, was unstoppable and, anyway, the wine
was beginning to get to her. Pauline laid her back on the bed and set to work,
it only took a few minutes and as she lay there Mary once again wondered about
what she was letting herself in for. Here she was, stark naked on the bed while
Pauline clipped away at her most intimate parts but Pauline was being so matter
of fact that it almost seemed natural.

&nbsp;

�There, that�s better.� Pauline brushed away the last of
the loose hairs. �Now, stand up and take a look.�

&nbsp;

Mary stood once again in front of the mirror. She had to
admit that it did look better; her sex was exposed, open, and somehow very
erotic. She wondered why she�d never thought to do it for herself and
determined to keep it that way.

&nbsp;

Pauline helped her on with a garter belt, stockings, the
black lacy panties and the matching bra. As Mary turned for the dress Pauline
stopped her.

&nbsp;

�Not yet. First I want you to put on the shoes and look at
yourself in the mirror.� Mary did as she was told. �Isn�t that more like it?.
What do you say now?�

&nbsp;

�I am a powerful confident woman, I�m in charge.� Mary
remembered the words Pauline had given her and here, in front of the mirror she
saw the sexy woman she�d once been. She stood a little straighter, held herself
a little tighter, not bad, not bad for thirty two she grudgingly
admitted to herself.

&nbsp;

Still Pauline wouldn�t let her put on the dress but
insisted that she do her make-up first. As Pauline helped Mary felt that she
was being pampered, groomed. She found that putting on the make up was like
putting on a mask. I am a powerful confident woman, I�m in charge she
repeated to herself and, looking in the dressing table mirror, she could almost
believe it.

&nbsp;

Finally made up, she squeezed into the dress. It was
shorter, and tighter, than she remembered; it barely covered her stocking tops
and the cleavage� Once again she turned to the mirror, this time a woman she
hadn�t seen in a long, long while looked back. It had been ages since she�d
dressed like this or felt like this.

&nbsp;

�I am a powerful confident woman, I�m in charge.� This time
she said it out loud.

&nbsp;

�Good for you. Now come on, it�s almost seven thirty and
Tom will be here in a minute.� They went downstairs, fetched the second bottle
of wine from the kitchen, and went into the lounge. Pauline also brought the
magazine and laid it on the coffee table. �When he arrives let me do the
talking, just to get started, Ok?�

&nbsp;

�Ok.� Mary took another sip of wine. I am a powerful
confident woman, I�m in charge she repeated like a mantra. The sound of
Tom�s key in the lock made her heart lurch. Here
we go!

&nbsp;

�Hi, Mary, it�s me.� He called from the hallway.

&nbsp;

�Quick, stand up!� Pauline hissed.

&nbsp;

Tom came into the lounge and his jaw dropped. His wife and
the next-door neighbour stood there looking as sexy as possible. He couldn�t
remember the last time he�d seen Mary looking that good. 

&nbsp;

�What�s going on? Are you two having a party or something?�

&nbsp;

�Never mind that, what�s this?� Pauline pointed at the
magazine. 

&nbsp;

Oh no! Tom
saw what Pauline was pointing at. How did she find that! 

&nbsp;

�I�m sorry love, it�s not what it looks like.� He said to
Mary who just stood there with a determined look on her face.


�It�s exactly what it looks like.� Pauline snapped. �Now we know what you do on
those business trips of yours. Having little wanks over dirty magazines. I
think you should say sorry properly, on your knees.�

&nbsp;

For a moment or two Tom just stood there, looking from Mary
to Pauline, from Pauline to Mary. The silence stretched out, his mind raced, he
didn�t know how to respond. Mary, always meek and mild, had never done anything
like this before but she had a look on her face like thunder. He really was in
trouble. If he made a scene� well, he really was in the wrong, and wasn't this
just what he'd always dreamed of? He sank to his knees before his wife.

&nbsp;

�I�m sorry, Mary, I�m truly sorry.� He muttered.

&nbsp;

�It�s Mistress Mary from now on, understood?� Pauline
commanded.

&nbsp;

�Yes, yes Mistress Pauline.�

&nbsp;

�Now kiss her feet.� Tom bent forward to obey.

&nbsp;

�You�ve been a naughty little boy and naughty little boys
get their bottoms smacked.� Pauline continued.�
�Do you deserve to have your bottom smacked?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Mistress Pauline.� Mary�s silence was getting to Tom.
She just stood there. He�d like the chance to find out exactly how she felt
about all this, exactly where it was heading, but he knew that all he could do
now was play along. Besides, this was wildly exciting, his fantasies come true.
He�d always fancied Pauline, not that he�d ever do anything about it,
and here she was, acting the dominatrix as he knelt before his wife. His penis
was fast becoming erect, entangled in his underpants.

&nbsp;

�That�s enough.� Pauline reached for Tom�s shoulder and
pulled him upright. Then she came round and stood beside Mary. She pointed with
her foot at the bulge in Tom�s trousers. �Oh look, he�s getting all excited.
Shall we see just how excited he is? Take down you trousers, worm.�

&nbsp;

�But� But�� Tom protested feebly. Stripping off in front of
Pauline was going a bit far.

&nbsp;

�Do as she says.� For the first time Mary spoke, her voice
stern and controlled. Somehow those four quiet words held more power, more
authority than any of Pauline�s orders. Tom realised there would be no help
from that quarter and undid his trousers, pushing them to his knees.

&nbsp;

�And your underpants. Come on, don�t keep me waiting!�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Mistress Pauline.� Tom pushed down his underpants and
his penis, unencumbered at last, jutted out firmly before him. Tom bowed his
head, not sure if he was more embarrassed or turned on. There was no way he
could look either woman in the eye.

&nbsp;

�Oooh, quite a little stiffy. Look how excited he�s got.�
Pauline mocked. �There�s a holdall in the kitchen. Go and fetch it.�

&nbsp;

As Tom stood up he started to pull his underpants and
trousers back up.

&nbsp;

�What do you think you�re doing?� Pauline asked. �Did I say
you could pull your trousers up?�

&nbsp;

�No, Mistress Pauline, I�m sorry, Mistress Pauline.�

&nbsp;

�You will be sorry. Now go and get that bag.� Tom
shuffled off, hampered by the trousers around his knees, fetched the bag and,
bringing it back to the lounge, placed it in front of Pauline. �While we decide
exactly how we�re going to punish you you�re going to wait on us, hand and
foot, but first of all we need to get you properly dressed. Strip!�

&nbsp;

Tom obeyed, placing his clothes on a chair. Head bowed he
stood before the two women, stark naked, his erect penis sticking out before
him. Pauline reached down and, wrapping her fingers round it, firmly tugged it
back and forth.

&nbsp;

�Look at him, poor little thing! Men are ruled by their
pricks, control that and you control everything.� She reached further down and,
cupping his balls in her hand, gave a quick squeeze. Tom couldn�t suppress a
little yelp. She let go and, as she stood back, she slapped the top of his
penis with the tips of her fingers.

&nbsp;

�First we had better get this under control.� She reached
into the bag and retrieved a black leather jock strap. �Legs apart.� She
ordered. Tom did as he was told and Pauline fitted the jock strap on him,
fastening it with a padlock at the back. The jock strap was very tight against
him, so tight that his penis and testicles were crushed, but if anything this
increased the strength of his erection, He longed to touch himself but already
he knew that to do so would only cause more trouble. 

&nbsp;

�That�s better, nicely tied up. Now, Mary, have you got an
apron, something nice and girly?�

&nbsp;

�I think so. I�ll go and look.� As Mary went into the
kitchen she wondered about how she was feeling. Having Tom at her feet had
been, well, good. Maybe it was the wine, maybe it was the clothes, maybe it was
the remnants of her anger, but she was feeling stronger. Where she had once
been horrified she was now intrigued. She�d still let Pauline take the lead,
she wasn�t that confident yet, but more and more she wanted to see where this
was heading. Hung up on a hook in the broom cupboard was an apron her
mother-in-law had given her. She hated it, it was all frilly, far too much the
fifties housewife for her taste. It would be just so ironic to make Tom wear
it. He could be the little housewife
for once. She was sick and tired of traipsing round tending to his every need,
now the shoe was on the other foot. She returned to the lounge and handed it to
Tom who put it on.

&nbsp;

�How sweet! Now who�s a good little maid? Mary, how about a
light supper?� Mary nodded. �Slave, supper for two, now!�

&nbsp;

Tom went off to the kitchen. He wasn�t a cook, beans on
toast was about as far as he went, but he found some cold cuts and salad in the
fridge and managed to put something together. Pauline and Mary sat and chatted
in the lounge. Their talk was a little forced and Mary was quite relieved when
Tom told them that supper was served. 

&nbsp;

As the two women ate Tom stood by, waiting patiently. He
was quite hungry himself, but he knew that it was down to Pauline, or maybe
Mary, whether he would eat tonight. When they had finished Pauline got up from
the table.

&nbsp;

�You have ten minutes to get this kitchen spotless, then
report to us in the lounge. Understood?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Mistress Pauline.�

&nbsp;

�Good, come along, Mary.� Leaving Tom to clear up they
headed for the lounge. Tom wasn�t much better at housework than he was at
cooking and, as the ten minutes ticked away, he knew he wasn�t doing as well as
he should. A dilemma was fast approaching, finish the job or be on time? He
glanced at the clock, time was up, he�d have to leave the rest! He hurried
through to the lounge.

&nbsp;

When he arrived Pauline and Mary didn�t seem to notice,
they were too involved with each other. Pauline had persuaded Mary that it
would be a good way to tease Tom if he were to find them kissing. 

&nbsp;

�There�s something about a lesbian kiss that really turns a
man on and with Tom�s weenie all tied up it will drive him crazy.� She�d
explained. �Stupid really, it�s the one sexual activity they can�t get involved
with.� Mary was a little nervous, she�d never kissed a woman before, well, not
properly, but she was fast shedding inhibitions and willing to follow Pauline�s
lead. Anyway, it was just acting.

&nbsp;

For several minutes Pauline and Mary continued to smooch on
the sofa. Tom just stood and stared, totally amazed. This was Mary, meek,
unassuming Mary, and here she was in the sexiest outfit she�d ever worn locked
in a passionate embrace with their sexy neighbour. He�d never seen anything so
erotic. He felt as if his penis would explode, crushed beneath the tight jock
strap. He had to touch it, maybe if he rubbed it through the leather.
Surreptitiously he slipped his hand beneath the apron. Yes, rubbing himself
this way was far from perfect but better than nothing.

&nbsp;

Pauline broke from the kiss and looked up at Tom. Too late
he whipped his hand out from under the apron.

&nbsp;

�What are you staring at? And what were you doing beneath
your apron?�

&nbsp;

�I�m sorry, Mistress Pauline.�

&nbsp;

�Oh, you will be, you
will be so sorry. Now bring the holdall over to me.� Tom did as he was told and
put on the sofa next to Pauline. �Now then, it�s time to have your bottie
smacked. Don�t you agree?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Mistress Pauline.�

&nbsp;

�Turn around, hands behind your back.� Tom turned and found
his wrists being cuffed together behind him. �Now let�s go and check on how you
left the kitchen.� Pauline took a paddle out of the bag and stood up. Smacking
him on the buttocks she herded Tom into the kitchen. Mary got to her feet and
followed a trifle unsteadily, the wine, and, she had to admit, the kiss with
Pauline, had really got to her.

�

�What�s all this?� Pauline pointed to some pots left on the
draining board. �I thought I told you to leave the place spotless. Do you call this
spotless?�

&nbsp;

�No, Mistress Pauline.�

&nbsp;

�And this, and this, and this.� Pauline pointed here and
there, a spill not mopped up, a tea towel left out, a cup not put away, a smear
on the glass tabletop. �This isn�t any good at all.�

&nbsp;

�No, Mistress Pauline.�

&nbsp;

�No, Mistress Pauline. No, Mistress Pauline.� Pauline
mocked. �You�re pathetic. You can�t get a simple job right. I don�t know why we
bother with you. You�re not even worth punishing.�

&nbsp;

�I�m sorry, Mistress Pauline. Tom hung his head.

&nbsp;

�You�re a miserable specimen, you�re ordered to do a simple
task and you fail. Come on Mary, leave him, he�s not worth the trouble.�
Pauline turned towards the door.

&nbsp;

�Please, Mistress Pauline��

&nbsp;

�Please what?� Pauline turned back.

&nbsp;

�Please, Mistress Pauline, I�ll try harder, I�ll be good,
really, I will, please punish me. Please, please?�

&nbsp;

�I�m not the one you
should be asking.� Pauline�s voice was suddenly vicious. �Mistress Mary,
your wife, the one you�ve been neglecting for so long, that�s who you should be
asking!�

&nbsp;

Tom�s heart sank as he realised the truth in what Pauline
had said. Suddenly this wasn�t a game any more. He really had been neglecting
Mary, what with work and everything, so busy every day, there never seemed to
be time, time for her. Clumsily he fell on his knees before her and bowed his
head.

&nbsp;

�My dearest darling, Mistress Mary. I�m so sorry and I
would be honoured if you would punish me.� Mary glanced across at Pauline and
their eyes met. Both had heard the genuine contrition in Tom�s voice. Pauline
handed Mary the paddle and whispered �Across your knee, like a child.�

&nbsp;

Mary grabbed Tom by the ear and dragged him back to the
lounge. She sat down in the centre of the sofa and ordered him to lie across
her lap. Hampered by having his wrists cuffed behind his back it took some time
but he eventually wriggled in to position.

&nbsp;

�Tom, do you know what a safe word is?� Pauline interposed
before Mary could start.

&nbsp;

�Yes, Mistress Pauline.� 

&nbsp;

�Yours is �cabbage�. Mary, unless he says �cabbage� please
feel free to totally ignore this pathetic little worm�s pleadings. Smack him
�til he�s really sorry, and then some more for luck.�

&nbsp;

At first Mary was very tentative. After all, she did love
Tom and didn�t want to really hurt him. However, within a few strokes a fire
woke inside her, and once it started, nothing was going to stop it. A thousand
hurts and put downs poured out. Thwack! Take
that for the year you forgot my birthday, did you really think that garage
flowers were going to do the trick? Thwack! Take that for your bloody mother and her endless wittering about
grandchildren, what does she think I am, a breeding machine? Thwack! Take that for the way you spent that party
flirting with Rosemary leaving me to talk to boring Sam all night, Thwack! take that for all the times you never
noticed my new hair do, am I that invisible to you? Thwack! Take that for those endless lonely evenings
when you were away on business and now I find you were wanking yourself silly
to that stupid, Thwack! stupid,
Thwack! stupid Thwack! magazine, Thwack! Take that for all the nights I�ve lain beside you listening to you
snoring while I�m left high and dry because if you�ve come then that�s all
right then Thwack! And more than anything take that Thwack! for making
me love you Thwack! And that,
Thwack! and that, Thwack! and that, Thwack! and that, Thwack! and that.

&nbsp;

�Mary! Mary! Enough! I think he�s had all he can take.�
Pauline�s hand on her shoulder pulled Mary back down to earth. The red mists
cleared from her eyes and she realised that Tom was sobbing quite hard and
kicking his legs. His bottom and upper thighs were covered in bright red
wheals, testament to the fury unleashed within Mary. Sheepishly she looked at
Pauline.

&nbsp;

�Did he say� Did he say �cabbage�?� Mary was panting gently
from the exertion.

&nbsp;

�No, you�re all right, he never said the stop word. Mind
you. that�s quite a leathering you gave him.�

&nbsp;

�What happens now?�

&nbsp;

�Now he says thank you. We�ll need to give him a few
minutes to recover. Push him off. Then we�ll get that dress off you.� Mary gave
Tom a push and he slumped to the floor. There were a couple of squeaks as his
buttocks landed. Then, helped by Pauline, she stood up and squirmed out of her
dress. As she shuffled around her foot landed next to Tom�s head. He craned his
neck and started to kiss the toes of her shoes feverishly.

&nbsp;

�Looks like he�s had long enough to recover. Worm! Back on
your knees.� Shakily Tom got back up.

&nbsp;

�Thank you, Mistress, thank you.�

&nbsp;

�And how do you say �thank you� properly?� Pauline
enquired. Tom leant forward and kissed Mary�s panties, just at the top of her
labia. �That�s right. There�s a good boy. Mary, you might find this easier
sitting down.�

&nbsp;

Mary sat back down again and Tom squirmed between her legs.
He�d read enough magazines to know what he was supposed to do but his vanilla
sex life with Mary had missed this part. Mary, however, knew what she needed;
she yanked the gusset of her panties to one side and spread her labia. A few
curt words guided him to her clitoris, told him to flick with the end of his
tongue rather than suck, and even with all their fumbling inexperience Mary had
never felt anything so good, better than her fingers, better even than the
washing machine on spin cycle!

&nbsp;

Pauline slid onto the sofa and cuddled up to her friend.
�Mary, I�m off, the next bit�s up to you. I�ll leave the key to the padlock on
the mantelpiece.�

&nbsp;

�Ooooh. Don�t go. I want to say �thank you��.

&nbsp;

�I�ve got to, any more and I�m cheating on Garry. Who
knows, maybe we�ll play foursomes some time. I�ll call you tomorrow and find
out how you got on.�

&nbsp;

�Tomorrow. Aaahh! We�ll talk tomorrow. Goodnight, Pauline,
thank you.� Pauline slipped out of the room and left.

&nbsp;

Tom may have been a fumbling amateur but he was learning
fast. His tongue was flicking from side to side against the tip of Mary's
clitoris. Mary reached down and grasped the sides of his head, pulling him into
her.� 

&nbsp;

�Oh, Tom, Oh, Tom, Oh that�s sooo good.� Tom responded
flicking harder as she� pulled harder,
easing back as she eased back. Mary� fingers dug into the side of Tom�s head as
a wave broke within her, washing to and fro but Tom kept his steady rhythm and
the wave did not subside, but grew, higher, higher. Again it washed through her
and still Tom didn�t stop, still the steady rhythm drove through her until she
felt she could take no more and with the sparkle of a thousand fireworks
tingling through every part of her body she climaxed again and again and again.

&nbsp;

For a few long, long minutes they were silent except for
their exhausted panting. Mary looked down at Tom and Tom looked back and in
that moment they knew it would be all right. The shared passion, the strength
of their emotion had brought them together to a place they had never been
before and it had made them stronger.

&nbsp;

�Well, that�s me sorted. I suppose we ought to do something
about you.� In the warmth of her post-orgasm glow Mary found it hard to be
cruel.

&nbsp;

�Yes, please, Mistress.� Mary got up and fetched the
padlock key from the mantelpiece. She came round behind Tom and unfastened the
wrist cuffs and the jock strap, and tossed them back in the holdall. The apron
was thrown on a chair, they'd tidy up in the morning. She came back to Tom, his
penis, freed from the jock strap, rose proud and stiff before him. Mary reached
down and grasped it.

&nbsp;

�I want you
spread-eagled on the bed right now!� Tom rushed off with Mary chasing, her
shoes, panties and bra being discarded along the way. By the time she got to
the bedroom Tom was waiting for her. She leapt onto the bed and knelt over Tom.� She was still lubricated enough and Tom was
stiff enough so she reached down, spread her labia and slid him inside, all the
way inside. She lent forward, resting her hands on Tom�s shoulders, pinning him
down, and started to sway her hips back and forth in a slow, steady rocking
motion.

&nbsp;

Each backward push forced Tom down onto the bed and, soft
as it was, it still made the fresh bruises on his buttocks smart. Despite this,
because of this, Tom was quickly reaching his climax. He started to respond,
push back, but Mary told him sharply to lie still.

&nbsp;

�I don't think I can last much longer, I can't, I can't...
Oh, Mary, my angel, my love, Ohhhhh.� Deep inside her Mary felt Tom explode,
shooting his load again and again until he was completely drained, completely
satisfied. Tom flopped, as drained of energy as he was of spunk. 

&nbsp;

After a while Mary could feel the stiffness collapsing
inside her. She lent forward and lay on top of him as his penis, now completely
flaccid, slid gently out of her. For a minute or two they just lay there,
husband and wife, not slave and mistress. Tom gently kissed Mary.

&nbsp;

�Hun?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Tom?�

&nbsp;

�Thanks, I mean really, thank you. That was fantastic.�

&nbsp;

�Well, you weren't so bad yourself. Would you like to play
again soon?�

&nbsp;

�Ooh, yes please!�

&nbsp;

�I'll have to think up lots of little jobs for you. Ways in
which you can be my slave.� Mary could hardly believe what she was saying. Only
this morning she had been horrified by the very thought and here she was,
planning for more. But Pauline had been right, She'd get him to do the
housework and the sex was unbelievable. She thought about what Pauline had said
about foursomes with her and Garry. Maybe that was a little too much, or
maybe...

&nbsp;

�Hun.� Tom broke into her reverie. �Next time... Not quite
so hard when you spank me, please.�

&nbsp;

�Oh I think that's up to me. Don't you?�����������

As Mary tidied round the next
morning she mulled things over. She still wasn't completely at ease with what
had happened, if Pauline hadn't got her tipsy... but she knew she couldn't
blame the wine, she hadn�t been that drunk. She remembered how it had felt to
have Tom on his knees before her, for all their years together he'd been the
decider, the one in charge and she'd been the little woman. So ironic that such
an old fashioned male chauvinist piglet had a submissive streak, and what a
streak! And to think that Garry next door was the same. It goes to show, she thought to
herself, that you never know what goes on behind closed doors.

.

The magazine still lay on the
coffee table like a guilty secret. She picked it up and flicked through it,
still slightly revolted. but also intrigued by the different acts portrayed.
Some she knew she could never do, a section on toilet slaves was far, far too
strong for her tastes, her stomach turned at the very thought of it, but others
had a certain something. She tried to judge by the wear on the pages which bits
had turned Tom on but she wasn't getting anywhere. She determined to ask him
about it some time, maybe this evening, see which bits pushed his buttons. But
enough, the magazine had done it's job and was going in the bin; if Tom wanted
kinky sex from now on he'd have to settle for the real thing, if and when she
was ready for it. 

&nbsp;

She picked up the holdall; it
was surprisingly heavy and clinked a bit. Wondering what it held, she put it on
the coffee table and sat down on the sofa to rummage through it, she was sure
Pauline wouldn�t mind. Most of the objects were pretty obvious, cuffs and
restraints, eye masks and gags, some were less so and had uses she couldn't
guess at, some rubber objects that looked like small Christmas trees were
totally beyond her. She was also a bit confused by two metal rods, each with a
cuff at one end, until she realised they fitted together to make a longer bar
with the cuffs about three feet apart. She tried to imagine Tom wearing it, how
helpless he would be, how much she could tease him. She remembered how he'd
looked when she and Pauline had been kissing, talk about the child at the
sweetshop window. And the kiss with Pauline, well that had been acting, just a
tease for Tom, but if she was really honest with herself... no stop it, it was just an act, only a
tease for Tom.

&nbsp;

She heard a van pull up and
glanced out of the window. The van had 'Jane's Flowers' written on the side and
the delivery driver was unloading an enormous bouquet. Mary could scarcely
believe it when he headed for her front door so she threw the bits and pieces
back in the bag and rushed round to open it.

&nbsp;

�Mrs Bradshaw?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, that's me.�

&nbsp;

�These must be for you then.� The driver handed her the bouquet
and, with a cheery 'good morning' returned to the van. The colours, the
fabulous aroma, this had cost someone a bob or two. Still in a state of
disbelief Mary took them through to the kitchen to put them in water. She
wasn't even sure she had a vase big enough; heaven knows she'd never needed one
before. She hadn't had flowers like this since they were married and she'd
chosen those, Tom had thought that anything to do with flowers was 'woman's
work'. She laid them gently on the table and opened the attached note.

&nbsp;

�To the Mistress of my heart �
thanks for everything. Tom.� Oh bless! Mary felt a warm glow run through her. Tom really was a
sweetie and, although she wasn't sure if they were for guilt over the magazine
or a way of saying thank you for playing his games, she didn't care. To hell
with getting the housework done, this was payment enough! At the back of a
cupboard she finally found a suitable vase and, arranging the flowers to her
satisfaction, took them through to the lounge. Pride of place on the
windowsill, that's what these deserved. Putting down the flowers she saw
Pauline walking up the drive, come to fetch the holdall no doubt, and certainly
eager for a chatter. She went to the front door and let her in.

&nbsp;

�Wow, I saw the flowers. Are
those from Tom?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, aren't they gorgeous?�

&nbsp;

�I told you men liked to be put
in their place. So tell me all, how did it go?�

.

�Well, you were there for most
of it, and, after you'd gone, we had the most fabulous sex.�

&nbsp;

�Details, I want details.�
Pauline demanded but Mary just blushed and, seeing her discomfort, Pauline bit
her tongue. �So, are you going to do it again?�

&nbsp;

�I think so, but how do you
start? I mean, last night was easy, what with the magazine and all, but even
then I needed you to show me the way. What do you do with Garry? How do you get
things started?�

&nbsp;

�Well Garry's got a thing about
wearing women's undies so one of my favourites is to slip something frilly into
his briefcase before he leaves for work. I then phone him up and tell him that
he must put them on. I love it if I know he's got clients visiting, the thought
of him having to be all brisk and businesslike whist wearing my camiknickers
gives me as much of a thrill as him. Then, when he gets home, he knows what
he's in for. On the other hand, sometimes I just send him a text, 'slave
tonight' or something like that. The point is to do it early, anticipation is
part of the tease.�

&nbsp;

��And all the stuff in the bag, where do you
get that? Mary asked.

&nbsp;

�On the web, just Google
restraints and you'll find plenty of mail order places. eBay is worth a look as
well. Some of it's a bit pricey but if you're buying do yourself a favour and
get good stuff, as with everything else, you get what you pay for.�

&nbsp;

Mary was lost in thought for a
while. She was still a little uncomfortable about all this but the idea of Tom
wearing a pair of panties all day tickled her, and if it ended up with flowers
like today's, it looked as if she might be able to have her cake and eat it. However,
the thought of doing it on her own even now dismayed her. She remembered how
smoothly Pauline had taken charge, how easy it had been to slip into role with
her there. And last night Pauline had said... No, she couldn't... But Pauline
had seen Tom naked and it was only fair...

&nbsp;

��Pauline?� she asked tentatively. �You know
you said about foursomes...�

&nbsp;

��Foursomes! Well, look at you, twenty four
hours ago I was having to persuade you to even give it a go and now you want
foursomes?� Pauline looked at her friend in amazement.

&nbsp;

�It's just... I still don't
think I could do it on my own. It's so much easier when you're there and it
wouldn't be fair to leave out Garry, would it?�

&nbsp;

�Ok, I'm pretty sure Garry
would be up for it, what about Tom?�

&nbsp;

�He'll do as he's told, anyway
he didn't seem to mind you being there last night.�

&nbsp;

�We'll have to lay down some
ground rules.� Pauline, as ever, was being practical.

&nbsp;

�What do you mean?�

&nbsp;

�Well, at one end of the scale,
if I found out that you and Garry were having an affair behind my back then I'd
tear you limb from limb, make no mistake about that, at the other end of the
scale, if Garry were to be ordered to kiss your feet, then no one could object.
The problem is, where's the line? How far can we go before we overstep
someone's boundaries? And if we're all a little tipsy then it would be all too
easy for one of us to do something stupid and ruin our friendship.� Pauline
thought for a while. �I know, we'll use a safe word. 'Lettuce'. That will do.
If either of us suggests something, which the other is uncomfortable with, then
just say lettuce and we'll stop. Does that make sense?�

&nbsp;

The more Mary thought about it
the more she could see that Pauline was being logical. Last night she had gone
way beyond what she would previously have countenanced, spurred by a heady mixture
of lust, anger and
alcohol. She wondered how far she would go, where her boundaries might be, how
far she might go in the heat of the moment before she found herself doing
something she didn�t want to. After all the very act of playing foursomes
involved an intimacy that she would have baulked at before, and once you'd
crossed that bridge who knows where it might end.

&nbsp;

The two women discussed their
plans at some length. Eventually they decided on Saturday evening at Pauline
and Garry's. They decided not to tell the boys what they had had in mind; Mary
was to tell Tom that they were invited round for drinks, nothing more.

&nbsp;

�And Saturday afternoon you and
I are going shopping.� Pauline announced. �I've seen your wardrobe and you
definitely need a new outfit.

&nbsp;

**************

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

�So, this S&amp;M stuff, tell
me what you really like.� Mary asked Tom as they lay in bed that night. �If it
were down to you, which it's not, what would you like to do?�

&nbsp;

�I'm not sure, I can't really
say.� Tom replied. He was having problems getting used to this new Mary, this
Mary who could discuss sex openly. Mary snuggled up to him and, reaching down,
gently fondled his penis. She thought about what she had read in the magazine.

&nbsp;

�Let's see, what if I made you
do the housework dressed only in a pair of my panties and a frilly apron?�
Tom's penis twitched. �Maybe if I told you what a pathetic worm you are and
made you worship at my feet?� Another twitch. �Or maybe if I tied you up and
teased you?� This time his reaction was stronger, Tom�s penis was near fully
erect and Mary started to stroke it up and down, up and down. �Oh, you'd like
that, wouldn't you? But what's in it for me? What do I get? If you want me to
play your games then you've got to play mine. After I've had my fun then, if
you've been good, you can have yours. Understood?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Mistress.�

&nbsp;

�Uh huh.� Mary removed her
hand. �Don't get all excited. We're not playing now, just talking.�

&nbsp;

�Oh please, Mary.� Tom snuggled
up closer. �Just a cuddle�

&nbsp;

�No, I know what you mean by 'just
a cuddle', it's too late and I'm too tired. You'll have to wait. Don't worry,
we'll play again soon.� Tom rolled against her, totally frustrated. He wondered
if he could have a little wank to relieve himself but he couldn�t do it in bed,
Mary would notice, and if he slipped off to the bathroom now she�d surely guess
what he was up to. He wasn't the only one amazed by Mary's new assertive
attitude. Far too many times she'd let him have his way because it was the
easiest option but now, now she'd had him grovelling at her feet, she was going
to ensure that her needs were met, not just his, and anyway a little teasing
was so much fun. She could feel his penis, swollen and hard, pressing against
her thigh, well it would do him good to wait, anticipation would fuel his
ardour when the time came. �Night night Tom.� She pushed him away, rolled over
and went to sleep.

&nbsp;

************

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

On Saturday afternoon Mary and
Pauline went shopping. Pauline, as ever, knew what she wanted and was going to
get it. With Mary trailing in her wake she headed for 'A la Mode', an expensive
lingerie shop. Together they rifled through the racks.

&nbsp;

�I can't afford these prices!�
Mary was staring horrified at a price tag.

&nbsp;

�Yes you can, anyway, give the
bill to Tom, I bet you anything you like he coughs up. Here, this looks like it
would fit you.� Pauline showed her a lightly boned corset made from black satin
with red trimmings and laces up the back. It was just high enough to support,
but not cover, the breasts.

&nbsp;

�Isn't it a bit tarty?�

&nbsp;

�Nonsense, let's try it on
you.� They went to the changing rooms and, after a bit of squeezing, Mary found
that it did fit. Indeed it kept that annoying bulge in the tummy firmly under
control. �Just right, now a pair of French knickers and some stockings and
you're all set. Whilst Mary got back into her clothes Pauline was off searching
the shop. By the time Mary came out of the changing rooms Pauline had already
found a pair of black silky French knickers which would match the corset. She
also had found a pair of pink lacy hipster briefs and some suitable stockings.
They went to the counter to pay the rather snooty assistant using Mary's credit
cards.

&nbsp;

�What are the pink briefs for?�
Mary asked once they'd left the shop. �They're nice but they don't go with the
rest of the outfit and I've got the French knickers.�

&nbsp;

�They're not for you, silly,
they�re for Tom.�

&nbsp;

�Tom! Well, Ok, but how do I
get him to wear them? I thought he wasn't supposed to know about tonight.�

&nbsp;

�Easy. When you're getting
dressed insist that he wears them or he won't have a good time later. He'll
assume that you're planning to play after you get home.�

&nbsp;

�Ok, I'll see what I can do.�
Mary agreed reluctantly.

&nbsp;

In the next shop they bought
Mary a short black skirt and a matching blouse. The blouse was almost
see-through, just opaque enough to be decent. As ever Mary had little say in
the decision, she would never have bought anything so daring, but when they got
to the shoe shop she tried to assert herself.

&nbsp;

�I'll never manage to walk in those!�
Mary was aghast at the height of the heels.

&nbsp;

�Nonsense, you'll be fine, it's
not as if you're going for a five mile hike or anything. Go on, try them on,
walk up and down a bit.� Mary put the shoes on and took a few tottering steps
over to one of the mirrors. They were difficult, but not impossible, and when
she saw what they did for her calves she relented.

&nbsp;

Fully shopped out they returned
to Pauline's car and drove back home. 

&nbsp;

************

&nbsp;

Mary took her time getting
dressed; Tom, as ever, was leaving it to the last minute. It was quite complex
lacing up the corset on her own but she managed it. Once she had got it on,
along with the knickers and stockings, she put on her new shoes and posed in
front of the mirror. Expecting to see a turkey trussed for Christmas she was
pleased to see a proud, dominant, and very sexy woman. Pauline certainly knew
how to choose clothes. �I am a powerful
confident woman, I�m in charge,� she repeated to herself realising that she was
really beginning to believe it. She heard Tom coming upstairs so she slipped on
a dressing gown to keep the surprise. Tom hardly noticed her as he went through
to the en suite for a shower. A few minutes later he re-emerged still towelling
himself dry.

&nbsp;

�Tom? You know I've been teasing you a
bit recently, how about playing some games later tonight?�

&nbsp;

�Oh, yes please!� Maybe we'll make our
excuses to Garry and Pauline and leave a bit early Tom thought to himself.

&nbsp;

�Well, if you want to play you've got to do something for me
first.�

&nbsp;

�Whatever you want.�

&nbsp;

�Wear these tonight.� Mary reached into a bag and fetched out the
pink briefs. Tom was a little taken aback, this wasn't what he was expecting
but, compared to what she might have ordered him to do, it wasn't too much to
ask. He finished drying and slipped them on. They weren't a bad fit but they
hadn't been built for men to wear and his penis was straining the material at
the front, and that was without having an erection.

&nbsp;

�They�re a bit uncomfortable.� He complained.

&nbsp;

�Good, that way you won't forget you're wearing them.� Much as
Mary thought he looked ridiculous she was amused by the sight of her big strong
man in such feminine undies and was beginning to see why Pauline found the idea
appealing. �Come on, we're due there in fifteen minutes.� She shrugged off the
dressing gown and went to put on her skirt and blouse. 

&nbsp;

For the second time Tom was amazed, his eyes nearly popped out of
his head. Fabulous outfit, dead sexy, but why so
overdressed for drinks with Garry and Pauline? He thought to himself. Still, he wasn't complaining if his wife
had turned from the little mouse she had been to this foxy lady. Maybe this was
all part of the tease. His penis stirred in his panties.

&nbsp;

Ready at last they went downstairs and, fetching a couple of
bottles of wine from the fridge, went next door. Mary found that, as long as
she took short steps and swung her hips, she could indeed walk in the shoes,
well, at least as far as next door. They rang the bell and waited.

&nbsp;

�The door's open, come on in.� Pauline called from the lounge.
They pushed it open and went on through. When they got to the lounge Tom got
his third, and biggest shock. There was his mate and beer buddy, Garry,
kneeling on the hearthrug, his wrists bound to his ankles, a gag in his mouth,
with his erect penis straining beneath a pair of red lacy briefs. The sudden
realisation of what he'd walked into, why Mary was dressed as she was, why he was dressed as he
was, left him dumbfounded, standing in the doorway staring at Garry.

&nbsp;

By the look on Garry's face he also wasn't expecting this. Bound
and teased by Pauline was all very well but in front of Tom, Tom of all people,
his face blushed crimson. There was a long, long, silence.

&nbsp;

�Garry, sweetie, did I forget to tell you that Tom and Mary were
coming round tonight?� Pauline mocked. �And Tom, don't just stand there, come
on in, make yourself comfortable, just like Garry.�

&nbsp;

�I don't think I can handle this.� Tom was extremely uneasy, in
front of Pauline had been fine, but Garry... This was going far too far, far
too fast. He started to back out of the room but Mary stood firm in the
doorway, blocking his path.

&nbsp;

�I told you, if you want to play your games you have to play by my
rules.� Mary, having spent all day gearing herself up for this moment determined
not to lose control now. She'd had a taste of power and liked it, if she let
Tom win then it would be back to the mousy little housewife in no time. �Anyway
it looks like Garry's having fun, why don't you show Pauline your pretty little
panties? I'm sure she'd get a kick out of seeing you in them. Get undressed
like Garry? Now!�

&nbsp;

Tom looked at Mary, standing there with a determined expression on
her face, and then at Pauline, wearing high heels, stockings, a short satin
dressing gown and a supercilious smile, and finally at Garry, who, despite an
anguished expression, had a rock hard erection which threatened to burst out of
the panties he was wearing. He realised that, if he were to chicken out now,
he'd lose all chance of any future games with Mary, games he had fantasised
about ever since that night. He was also beginning to realise that he couldn't
be submissive and call the shots, however much he wanted to, it was Mary's way or no
way and if, and he still couldn't believe it, she wanted to play it this way
then that's the way it would go. Reluctantly he started to unbutton his shirt.

&nbsp;

�That's better, just fold up your clothes and put them on the
chair.� Pauline ordered. She and Mary watched in silence as Tom disrobed,
neither was surprised to see that Tom, although not fully erect, was already
showing signs of arousal. Once he was stripped down to his panties Pauline
reached into the holdall, which was tucked behind an armchair, and retrieved
some leather shackles. �It's a good job I've got plenty of spares. Mary, could
you give me a hand here?� They knelt him down next to Garry and fastened him,
wrist to ankle. Next Pauline fetched another gag and after a brisk 'open wide'
fitted it in Tom's mouth.

&nbsp;

�Is that wine you've brought? Come on through to the kitchen and
we'll open a bottle.� Pauline bundled up Tom's clothes and the two women went
into the kitchen, leaving the boys bound and gagged, to wonder what was coming
next.

&nbsp;

Pauline dumped Tom's clothes on the kitchen table and, putting one
bottle in the fridge, opened the other and poured two generous glasses. Then
she sat down, showing no intention of returning to the lounge. 

&nbsp;

�That went well. Let's leave them stew for a while. What do you
want to do next?�

&nbsp;

�I don't know. Are you sure Garry's Ok with this?� Mary sat down
beside her and sipped her wine.

&nbsp;

�Oh yes, he's fine. I can recognise 'cabbage', even through a gag,
and didn't you see the stiffy he's got? He's often told me he'd like to see me
with another woman but I'm not sure this is quite the scenario he
expected.�

&nbsp;

�With another woman? Kissing and that?�

&nbsp;

�Oh yes, I told you it was every man's fantasy. Come on, why don't
we give them a show? Have a bit of a cuddle on the sofa, you watch, it will
drive them wild.�

&nbsp;

Mary gulped down her wine. Of all the uncertainties from the other
night her feelings about how she'd felt kissing Pauline were the most confused.
She topped up her glass and had another hefty swig. If it was just to tease the
boys then it didn't really count, did it? 

&nbsp;

�Ok, let's do it.� She said at last.

&nbsp;

Back in the lounge Garry and Tom had been spending several very
uncomfortable minutes. It wasn't just that their restraints were tight; there
was an acute embarrassment in being in the demeaning position in front of a
mate. Garry had glanced at Tom and, as their eyes met, there was an
understanding, not a word was to be mentioned about this down the pub! 

&nbsp;

When Pauline and Mary returned to the lounge they completely
ignored the boys, went straight to the sofa and, putting down their wine
glasses, went into a passionate kiss. At first it was just lips to lips but
Pauline, obviously throwing herself into the role, started to kiss Mary's neck,
and, pushing the blouse as far open as it would go, moved on to her shoulders.
Out of the corner of her eye Mary could see the boys staring goggle eyed; well,
if this was what turned them on, she'd give them the show they wanted. Anyway,
Pauline's kisses were getting to her, if only Tom would learn to kiss like
that, soft and gentle and not just on the lips.

&nbsp;

Their squirming together on the sofa had loosened the tie to
Pauline's dressing gown and it gaped open. Underneath she was wearing a black
soft leather corset that stretched from her hips to just below her breasts
which stood proud and free, unencumbered by any bra. She felt Pauline's hand on
her front, reaching for the buttons of her blouse, one, two, three, four and it
was undone. Oh well, if Tom was to get an eyeful of Pauline's tits then it was
only fair that Garry should see hers.

&nbsp;

�You look just gorgeous, I could eat you all up.� Pauline had
pulled back and was shrugging off the dressing gown. Mary could see that she
wasn't exactly wearing panties, but a crotch-piece of leather pop-fastened to
the bottom of her corset at the front, and presumably also at the back, took
their place covering her groin. Pauline saw her staring. 

&nbsp;

�Do you like it? A birthday present from Garry.� She posed
provocatively. �Now let's get that blouse off you, we don't want to get it all
messed up.�

&nbsp;

Pauline helped Mary out of her blouse and they resumed their
embrace. Now that Mary's shoulders were bare Pauline roamed further and further
afield with her kisses. Mary felt her skin tingle deliciously as Pauline's lips
fluttered here and there, from shoulder to shoulder but straying a little lower
each time. Please, my nipples, oh please my
nipples! Mary didn't dare say the words out
loud, to admit to the others that she was getting turned on would mean
admitting to herself that this was no longer 'just a show for the boys'.
Finally Pauline got there, gently teasing the nipple with her teeth causing it
to swell up. Mary's groan of pleasure was echoed by two muffled groans from the
boys but she wasn't really that bothered, she was too absorbed in her own
pleasure to worry about theirs.

&nbsp;

She felt Pauline's touch on her on her knee, on her thigh,
travelling north. Part of her wanted to call 'lettuce', this was starting to
get out of control, and if Pauline touched her 'down there' there would be no
hiding how turned on she was. Pauline's hand had reached the top of her
stockings and unbidden, she opened her knees, allowing them further. She felt
fingers slipping beneath the silk of her knickers, it was now or never, she
ought to stop, she ought to... Ohhhhhhh that's so
good! Any thought of resistance fled as
Pauline touched her labia, caressing them gently causing a tingling line of
pleasure to run straight from her nipple to her groin.

&nbsp;

Pauline stopped kissing Mary's nipple and moved up to nibble her
ear. �You can return the favour, you know.� She chided in a gentle whisper.

&nbsp;

Mary realised how selfish she'd been, it was so good to feel
Pauline's expertise on her body that she'd been wallowing in her own pleasure,
quite forgetting that this should be mutual. Tentatively she reached for
Pauline's breasts, stroking their smooth skin, contrasting it with the
roughness of the nipples; gently she took one between thumb and forefinger,
playing with it, teasing it. Pauline kissed her again on the lips, not the
simple pecks they had started out with but a full kiss, tongues and all, almost
climbing on top of Mary in a passionate embrace.

&nbsp;

As their bodies crushed together Mary could no longer play with
Pauline's nipples. She slid her hand lower, across the taught leather of
Pauline's corset, down onto her hips. If she really was to 'return the favour'
then she should go lower, her hand slid towards Pauline's groin, under the
leather and there was a faint �click� as the poppers gave way. Her fingers
slipped through Pauline's pubic hair, found their goal and probed inside. It
was no surprise that Pauline was as wet, as aroused, as she was and, as her
fingers began to stroke Pauline's clitoris, she felt her friend clutch her
tighter, her kisses ever more passionate.

&nbsp;

Mary had long ago lost any illusion that this was a tease for the
boys, this was raw sex, and with another woman, but animal lust had swept aside
inhibitions. Pauline's fingers kept pushing her close to the brink, right to
the edge, and then pulling back, until their passions met, each woman finding
her climax, sharing her climax, exploding together, locked together, joined
together as one.

&nbsp;

�Yes, yes, yes, yes, YESSSSS!!!� Pauline screamed as she came.
Mary uttering animal cries in return. For a long minute they held each other
close until the wave subsided and they relaxed, panting gently.

&nbsp;

Eventually Pauline stood up, a shade unsteady on her high heels.
The crotch-piece hung down behind her so she took it off and tossed it on a
chair. Mary realised that her knickers were a soggy mess which wasn�t quite the
image she wanted. She slipped them off and threw them on the chair next to
Pauline�s crotch-piece. She looked at Pauline, standing tall, the black leather
emphasising the nakedness of her breasts and buttocks. If she wasn�t to be the
shy little mouse it seemed that the skirt had to go as well. As she stood up
she slipped it off leaving it to fall at her feet. She wasn�t sure that, on her
tottering heels, she could reach it so she left it lying there.

&nbsp;

�Right, boys, did you enjoy our little show?� Pauline went over to
the holdall and retrieved a riding crop. Then, standing in front of the
kneeling men she reached down and stroked it along the length of Garry�s penis
which strained beneath the tight underwear. �Oh, I can see Garry did, look how
excited he�s got, and as for Tom, not so reluctant now, are you? I think you
ought to give your Mistress a little kiss to show how grateful you are.�

&nbsp;

Pauline removed Tom�s gag and guided Mary to stand in front of
him. 

&nbsp;

�Not too close, let him strain a bit.� She whispered in Mary�s
ear.� Tom did, indeed, need to strain forward to reach Mary.� �Come on, you can do better than that, and
use your tongue.� Pauline chided. Tom strained harder but Mary was enjoying
teasing him, enjoying watching his wrists pull against his ankles as he
struggled to reach her. Occasionally she�d let him touch, let him push his
tongue between her labia, but the teasing was much more fun.

&nbsp;

�Pathetic, totally pathetic. Why don�t we let Garry have a try?�
Pauline�s contemptuous tone cut in. Mary�s mind raced, getting Garry to kiss
her in such an intimate way would be the first time any other man had touched
her sexually since she had started dating Tom all those years ago. Another
taboo was about to fall, another bridge to be crossed, this was very different
to her tryst with Pauline but, and there were some buts, it wasn�t as if she
was going behind Tom�s back, as long as it kept within the confines of this
room, as long as she was doing it to tease Tom, not to please herself, as long
as she� Oh, why not? Tom could always use the safe word if he couldn�t handle
it. She pulled away from Tom and went over in front of Garry, undid his gag,
and pushed her hips forward.

&nbsp;

Garry was no novice, and Mary was teasing Tom by not teasing Garry,
so she let him run his tongue up and down, playing with her inner lips,
flicking past her clitoris, but never resting long. Mary was too uncomfortable
to really relax and enjoy it, her calves were beginning to complain about her
high heels, never the less she was beginning to appreciate just what a skilled
tongue could do for her. Pauline, meanwhile, had moved next to Mary, and had
Tom�s head firmly in her groin. She reached across and gave Mary�s hand a
little squeeze.

&nbsp;

�Garry�s been a naughty boy, haven�t you?� A muffled �ess issress�
was all he could reply from Mary�s groin. �I think six strokes of the crop
ought to sort him out. Let�s get these two organised.� They pulled away and
went round behind the boys, undid their restraints only to refasten them, wrist
to wrist, ankle to ankle. Pauline pulled Garry to his feet and led him to an
armchair. With shackled ankles he could only take the tiniest of steps so it
took a while. Mary decided to keep teasing Tom so she took him to the sofa,
laid him on his back and sat down beside him. As Pauline pulled down Garry�s
panties Mary slipped her hand over Tom�s stomach, under the waistband of his
panties, and wrapped it around his penis. Tom was rock hard and his glans
glistened with pre-cum, Mary knew he was on the edge of coming so she hardly
moved her hand at all, squeezing rather than stroking.

&nbsp;

�If you dare come before I�m ready it will be the worse for you.�
She leant down and whispered in his ear. �Now lie back like a good boy and
enjoy the show.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Mistress.� Tom�s voice was breathy as he fought to control
himself.

&nbsp;

Pauline was in no hurry with Garry. She made a big show of getting
him arranged just as she wanted him, adjusting his legs, moving him about,
making sure his whole weight was pressing his penis into the padded arm of the
chair. Then she fetched from the bag one of the �Christmas trees� and a tube of
lubricant. She smeared the tree with lubricant and, going round behind Garry,
started pushing it up his bottom. Now Mary could see what it was for! Garry
grunted as she twisted it back and forth, overcoming the initial resistance, it
would appear that, even with lubrication, it was far from comfortable but his
grunts changed to a deep sigh as the broadest part went in leaving only the
base to stop it disappearing completely. 

&nbsp;

Seeing that Mary and Tom were ready, and satisfied that Garry was
properly arranged, she stood back and flicked the riding crop across Garry�s
buttocks. Although Pauline had not struck particularly hard the crop was
designed to cut through horsehide and Garry�s �aaah, one, thank you Mistress�
came out between clenched teeth. By the third stroke Garry was sobbing, taking
much longer between the stroke and his response, and Mary was wondering if he
really was enjoying it but she guessed that this wasn�t the first time Pauline
had used the crop so she must know what she was doing. When the last stroke
fell he just lay there, gasping, unable to catch his breath, flopped across the
armchair. Pauline went round, knelt down, and, lifting up his head, kissed him
long and hard.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

�There�s my good boy, you�ve had your punishment, now you get your
reward.� Pauline stood up and unfastened Garry�s wrists. He obviously knew what
was expected as he put his arms out in front of him where Pauline refastened
them.� She manoeuvred him onto the floor
lying full length on the hearthrug. Mary could see him wince as his buttocks
touched the floor, but his erect penis, now free of his undies, showed how
aroused he was.

&nbsp;

As Tom and Mary watched Pauline knelt over Gary�s hips, reached
down, and slid his penis inside her. Slowly she moved up and down, keeping
upright as she did so. Tom could clearly see the shaft of Garry�s penis, slick
with Pauline�s juices, slide in and out. This was as strong as any of the
videos he and Garry would watch together over a few beers when the girls were
out, and it was real, happening right in front of him.

&nbsp;

�Is this what you�d like, Tom? I bet you�d give anything to feel
your prick in my cunt.� With one hand Pauline caressed her breasts, the other
reached for her clitoris, rubbing it in slow circles. Tom was too dumbstruck to
reply; Mary was a little concerned that Pauline had suggested she and Tom� but
it was only a tease, she�d say lettuce long before that happened!

&nbsp;

Garry was obviously near the edge, grunting audibly every time
Pauline lowered herself. �Control yourself worm, you maggot, you slime.� She hissed
between her teeth. The tendons in Gary�s neck stood out as he fought against
coming too soon. �Wait �till I�m ready or I�ll never let you near me again.
You�re mine, my little slave, my plaything, my toy, my ohhhh!�

&nbsp;

As Pauline rode Garry faster and faster it was obvious that they
had completely forgotten their audience. Pauline, still rubbing herself with
increasing vigour, slapped Garry across the face with her other hand. Garry,
for his part, was bucking beneath her, pushing back every time she pushed down.

&nbsp;

�Not yet, not yet!� Pauline squeezed out between panted breaths.
�Not yet, not yet. Now!!!!� Once, twice, three times, four times, she thrust
herself down on him and then fell forward resting on her arms.

&nbsp;

�Good boy, well done.� Pauline looked down at Garry, her
expression, for once, almost tender. �Mary, be a love and fetch a towel from
the bag, would you?�

&nbsp;

Pauline took the proffered towel, and, clutching it to her groin,
she slid off Garry and sat down in an armchair. Garry just lay there, panting
heavily, getting his breath back.

&nbsp;

�Ok, Garry, you can undo your ankles now. Mary and I need some
more wine, pull your panties up, oh, and the butt plug stays in.� Garry did as
he was ordered. �So, what are we going to do about you and Tom?�

&nbsp;

Mary was concerned that she�d got in too deep. Watching Pauline
with Garry she wondered if she�d ever be that uninhibited, able to let herself
go with people watching. Tom for his part was concerned about his ability to
perform. He�d been kept in a state of high arousal ever since they had arrived
and he�d had to fight not to come in Mary�s hand as he had watched Pauline and
Garry, and if Mary were to ride him in the same way he knew he couldn�t last.

&nbsp;

Pauline, however, was no fool, and she could read the uncertainty
written on her friends� faces. She went over and, sitting on the edge of the
sofa, reached down to hold Tom�s penis with Mary.

&nbsp;

�Looks like this one�s pretty near the edge, if we play with his
willy any more he�ll pop his cork, and we can�t have him coming before you do,
can we now? Have you ever sat on his face?�

&nbsp;

�What? Wouldn�t I crush him?�

&nbsp;

�Not if you do it right, here, let me show you.� She took Garry,
who had just returned with the wine, and laid him out across the hearthrug.
Then she knelt over his face positioning herself so that Garry�s mouth was just
between her thighs. �You see, it�s quite easy, now you have a go.�

&nbsp;

Somehow this seemed less embarrassing than penetrative sex, less
intimate in front of others, and, feeling that she�d been let off the hook,
Mary agreed. With Pauline�s help she refastened Tom�s wrists so he could lie
full length, and arranged herself over him. It was a bit awkward at first but
she soon found how to manoeuvre herself so that Tom�s tongue was just where she
wanted it. Tom, on the other hand, hadn�t forgotten what he�d been taught last
time and he searched out Mary�s clitoris and licked it gently, side to side.
Pauline went over to the coffee table, picked up the wine glasses, and came
back to kneel down next to Mary.

&nbsp;

�Here, drink up. Let�s celebrate submissive men, long may they
serve us!� Pauline handed one of the glasses to Mary who joined in the toast.

&nbsp;

As Tom�s tongue worked away at Mary�s clitoris it sparked a seed
of rebellion inside her. Sure she�d got what she asked for, Pauline had helped
her take her first steps in dominating Tom, but she was beginning to feel like
a puppet, dancing to someone else�s tune. She remembered the sight of Pauline�s
buttocks, framed between her corset and her stockings, and wondered what they would look like
with red stripes from the cane written across them. She imagined little Miss
Bossy Boots stretched over the arm of the chair the way Garry had been, that
spreader bar would come in useful, and then she�d get Garry to take her from
behind, or even Tom, and she�d be in control, she�d have the whip hand, she�d
play the tune the others danced to! She took a slurp from her wine, draining
the glass, and handed it to Pauline.

&nbsp;

The images in her head, as much as Tom�s tongue, were pushing Mary
towards her climax. A kaleidoscope of images, mostly of Pauline�s buttocks,
tumbled through her mind as years of repression rolled back. Maybe if Pauline
was on all fours, Garry taking her doggy style whilst she sucked Tom�s prick� Oooh, that felt good, oooh, yes, Tom, right there! Oh, yes! Pauline, realising that Mary was near her release, reached
down and began to play with Tom�s penis, harder, faster, matching Mary as she
wriggled against Tom�s mouth.

&nbsp;

�Yes. Tom, there, there, harder, harder!� Mary almost screamed.
Pauline�s hand pumped away and as, with a final cry of �Take that, you bitch!�
Mary climaxed she felt Tom jerk, jerk again, and sperm flew from him,
spattering his chest and Mary�s bottom.

&nbsp;

For a few minutes there was silence. Pauline was wondering why
Mary had screamed �take that, you bitch� as she came. Surely she wasn�t calling
Tom a bitch, that didn�t make sense, but she let it lie, maybe she�d find out
later. Then, with sheepish grins they got up off the floor, Tom and Garry�s
wrist were unfastened.

&nbsp;

�Everyone Ok?� Pauline asked. The others assented with muttered
yeses. �Garry, be a love and get two more glasses and the rest of the wine. I
think it�s about time you boys had a drink.�

&nbsp;

For the rest of the evening the four friends sat and chatted.
Despite their unusual dress they all acted as if this were now a normal evening
for the four of them, as if nothing untoward had happened, but Mary wasn�t
completely there, the images of Pauline still lingered at the back of her mind
and secretly she was thinking about how to turn the tables, not tonight,
definitely not tonight, but sometime soon, sometime real soon!

&nbsp;















The next morning it was Sunday and Tom and Garry went to play F

The next morning it was Sunday and Tom and Garry went to
play football in the park. As Mary waved them off she noticed that Garry was
wearing his tracksuit. No short shorts for him today, she remembered the state
of his bottom last night, he wouldn�t dare expose that down at the playing
fields! She nipped over to Pauline�s for a quick cuppa.

&nbsp;

�Well, how did you
like foursomes then?� Pauline asked as they sat and chatted at the kitchen
table.

&nbsp;

�I never thought�� Mary paused, marshalling her thoughts.
�I never thought I�d be into anything like that. Sex was somehow sacred, you
know, man and wife, alone and in bed, but once I got started it was kind of
liberating. I really thought I�d feel guilty, good little girls aren�t supposed
to enjoy kinky games, but I don�t, I don�t at all. And when we got home Tom and
I had some of the best sex ever. I wouldn�t have thought he could get it up
again, not after all that had happened, but we went to bed and made love for
hours, really made love, I mean, not just sex, something special.�

&nbsp;

�I know what you mean, Garry�s like that.�

&nbsp;

�Er, Pauline.� Mary was hesitant, she knew what she wanted
to ask was treading on dangerous ground. �Last night, when you were teasing
Tom, you said that he�d like to er, fuck you. Would you... Would you let him?�

&nbsp;

�Don�t worry, I was only teasing. You know I�d never do
anything you weren�t comfortable with, and I�d never go behind your
back. That goes both ways, of course.�

&nbsp;

�Of course, but would you? If I said it was alright, I
mean.�

&nbsp;

�I don�t know. I don�t want this to get out of hand. I
really enjoyed last night and I hope we can do it again soon, but, I have to
admit, sometimes I wonder what it would be like. No one�s been near me since
Garry and I started dating, I�m not that sort, but I can�t help wondering what
it would feel like, to have another man�s prick inside me. What about you?�

&nbsp;

�Oh, I don�t know either.� Naively Mary hadn�t thought that
her question would be thrown back at her, but it was on her mind. She couldn�t
lose this image of Pauline's buttocks, creamy white between the leather of her
corset and the tops of her stockings. In her wilder moments last night she'd
imagined her trussed up and letting Tom have his way with her, all under her
command of course, but then there would be Garry, what about Garry? Her brief
experience of Garry�s tongue had left her curious. What would it feel like to
make love to another man, especially in a way which wouldn�t threaten her
marriage?

&nbsp;

�Let�s just take it as it comes.� Mary said at last. �After
all, I�m finding all sorts of things I didn�t know I would do.�

&nbsp;

�Like kissing another woman, for example?� Pauline teased.

&nbsp;

�That was just a tease for the boys.� Mary countered.

&nbsp;

�Oh, right.� Pauline's disbelief was obvious. �You weren't
turned on at all, or do I remember someone having a teensy weensy orgasm last
night?�

&nbsp;

Mary blushed beetroot. She'd always been uncomfortable
about lesbianism, when a friend a school had made a pass at her she'd run a
mile, and of all the taboos she was overcoming, this was the hardest. After
all, playing foursomes was only a grown up version of the snogging sessions
she'd had at parties as a teenager and some discrete net surfing last week had
shown her that the S&amp;M stuff was very common, almost normal, it seemed. On
the other hand making love to another woman, well, she was strictly
heterosexual, wasn't she? Part of her was also concerned that, if she let this
thing get out of control, she'd end up having an affair with Pauline behind
Tom's back, and that was strictly out of the question.

&nbsp;

Against all this were the facts that she had enjoyed
cuddling with Pauline, she had had an
orgasm, and she couldn't shake the image of Pauline's body, and her wicked
desire to play with it.

&nbsp;

�Ok, Ok,� Pauline took Mary's hand in hers, seeing her
friend�s discomfort, �I'm not suggesting we nip upstairs for a wild sex
session, or anything. It's just that, when we're playing, I'm a believer in
anything goes as long as no one gets hurt, and I'm not afraid to admit
that you really turned me on last night.�

&nbsp;

'Afraid', the word echoed inside Mary. It was fear that
held her back all the time, fear of upsetting people. Fear of upsetting Tom had
kept her the quiet little housewife all these years, fear of upsetting her boss
meant that she was stuck in a dead end part time job. Her self esteem had never
been high, at school she hadn�t felt good enough to be one of the 'in crowd',
and, she was beginning to understand, it was fear that let Pauline walk all
over her all the time, even if she did it in the nicest possible way. But over
the last week she was getting glimpses of a different woman, a woman who could
demand respect, and get it. For a start she knew her relationship with Tom
would never be the same again, she was no longer going to be his little hausfrau, their relationship was going to be between
equals from now on.

&nbsp;

As for Pauline and her, well, she knew Tom wouldn't mind,
not as long as he could watch, but if they were going to get in a clinch
together it would be on her terms; she was no longer content to be the passive
partner all the time.

&nbsp;

�So, do you want to play foursomes again?� Pauline asked.

&nbsp;

�Yes, definitely yes, but let's wait a while first. I don't
want it to take over.�

&nbsp;

�That's understood. We'll give it a week or two. Hey, did you
hear about what happened to Sarah down at the supermarket?� The conversation
drifted off to other things.

&nbsp;

*******

&nbsp;

On Tuesday evening Mary suggested to Tom that they go
Internet shopping. She'd already done some research and had bookmarked some
interesting sites. As they sat in front of the PC they were, of necessity,
squeezed together and Mary was pleased to find that searching for suitable toys
and restraints was, somehow, a shared intimacy. Tom, for his part, was both
pleased and surprised by how quickly Mary had become enthusiastic about, as he
saw it, pandering to his fantasies. As they scrolled through the pages Mary
would ask, in a sweet voice, 'How about this one?' or 'Ooh, that looks nice,
shall I tie you up in one of those?� She slipped her hand onto his lap and
undid his fly; a little more squirming and she'd delved inside his boxer shorts
and was fondling his rapidly stiffening penis. Tom leaned closer and kissed her
on the cheek before returning to the shopping. Eventually they had chosen a selection
of restraints, including a stiff leather collar, and, on Mary's insistence, a
paddle and a tawse. When it came time to pay Tom baulked a bit at the
three-figure bill, but Mary's hand worked its magic and he was soon inputting
his credit card details.

&nbsp;

�Right, that's you all kitted out. Now it's my turn.� Mary
opened up a few more bookmarked sites. This time it was lingerie shops and Mary
used the mouse to point out various corsets and basques, each time asking Tom
for his opinion. Up until recently Tom would never have dreamed that Mary would
be into this sort of stuff, he remembered his disappointment when he had bought
her the lacy bra and panties set which she had never worn until the other day,
how she had stuck with the most boring plain white underwear all the time. Now
she was suggesting all sorts of hot stuff that had previously only featured in
his fantasies. He remembered how sexy he had found Mary when they first started
dating, but that had been a sweet little girl sexiness; this was the clothing
of a real woman, his real woman. He needed no persuasion to cough up this time.

&nbsp;

************

&nbsp;

Tom was away on yet another business trip so he wasn't
there on Thursday when the delivery arrived. Mary took the parcel upstairs and
laid the contents out on the bed. She was amazed that it had arrived so
quickly, the mail order company must have been on the case to turn around Tom�s
order in such a short time. She picked up the paddle and thwacked it across her
hand. Ow, that hurt! She remembered the leathering she�d given Tom, it
really must have been painful, and yet he hadn�t used the stop word, and had
only complained a teensy bit later. She�d never fully understand the pain
angle, for her the games were all about power, being in control, having Tom
look to her needs for a change. For her the paddle was a symbol of authority,
and beating Tom was about asserting that authority rather than causing him
pain. However, Tom seemed to like it and she knew that, if she were to get her
way, she�d have to pander to his desires now and again. Maybe she�d go a bit
easier next time, until they found exactly where the boundaries lay.

&nbsp;

She put the paddle down and picked up one of the wrist
cuffs. The leather was firm but supple and they�d chosen Velcro fasteners rather
than buckles as she noticed, round at Pauline�s that they were faster and
easier to put on and off, and they could hold her victim just as securely. She
wrapped one around her left wrist, getting it quite tight, and then pulled hard
at the �D� ring. The supple leather held her firm and she could pull really
hard without the cuff cutting into her flesh; she was glad they had spent those
few extra pounds. She sorted through the rest of the things. A collection of
quick release snaps would connect the cuffs together, and she played with them
for a while so that she could see exactly how they worked. Four short lengths
of chain could be used to attach the cuffs to the four corners of the bed,
again she experimented for a few moments so that she�d be confident when the
time came to do it for real. The last item was a blindfold. She smiled to
herself as she felt the soft leather run through her fingers. There were some
definite teasing possibilities here. She sorted out an old overnight bag that
Tom had sometimes used for short trips and put the stuff away.

&nbsp;

********

&nbsp;

At nine-o-clock the phone rang. It was Tom checking in from
the hotel.

&nbsp;

�Hello, darling. How are you? It�s been a really boring
meeting but the good news is that I can slip away early tomorrow. I should be
home for five so we can have the evening together.�

&nbsp;

�Hi, Tom, I�m fine.� Mary smiled to herself, it wasn�t
usual for Tom to rush home to be with her; this marked a definite upswing in
their relationship. �Guess what arrived today? We�ve got a parcel!�

&nbsp;

�Wow, that was fast! Which one is it, the leather or the
lingerie?�

&nbsp;

�The leather. I guess you wish you were here to try it
out.� Mary made her voice soft and seductive.

&nbsp;

�You bet! What�s it like? Is it Ok?� Tom�s excitement was
clear down the phone.

&nbsp;

�You�ll just have to wait and see. If you�re good to me we might
just try them out tomorrow night.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, please!�

&nbsp;

�Yes, please, what?� Mary snapped back.

&nbsp;

�Yes, please, Mistress.�

&nbsp;

�That�s better. As I said, we�ll have to see. I bet you�re
getting all worked up thinking about it.�

&nbsp;

�I am a bit.� Tom confessed.

&nbsp;

�Play with yourself, now, while I�m on the phone.� Mary
heard rustling as Tom, lying on the bed in his hotel room, pushed his trousers
down. A moment or two later he picked the phone back up. �That�s better, give
it a little stroke as you think about all the things I might do to you
tomorrow. Now we�ve got the cuffs I�ve got all sorts of ideas I�d like to try
out.�

&nbsp;

�Like what?� Tom�s breathing was getting heavy.

&nbsp;

�Ooh, that would be telling. Now, what should I wear? Oh,
and you forgot to call me Mistress, you�ll get punished for that.�

&nbsp;

�Sorry, Mistress, did the paddle come?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, indeed. Just the thing for smacking your naughty
little bottom.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Mistress. Please tell me more.�

&nbsp;

�No, that�s enough for now, and you�re not allowed to come
until I let you, if I let you, tomorrow.�

&nbsp;

�Mary!� Tom was aghast. �I can�t stop now, I�ve got to meet
the lads in the bar in two minutes and I can�t go down with an erection like
this. What will they think?�

&nbsp;

�Well I suggest you take a cold shower or something. If you
come, I�ll know. Good night, see you tomorrow.�

&nbsp;

�Night, night, Mary. I love you.�

&nbsp;

�Night, night, Tom. I love you too.�

&nbsp;

Tom lay on the bed, his penis throbbing. He sorely wanted
to finish himself off, but somehow wives seemed to have a sixth sense about
these things. Also, there was a thrill in holding it back. He pulled up his
trousers, and, after a minute or two to let the bulge subside, went down to the
bar to join his workmates.

&nbsp;

Mary, for her part, was also feeling a frisson of
excitement. She'd enjoyed teasing Tom, enjoyed knowing that it had turned him
on, and was determined to make sure that tomorrow lived up to their
expectations. She thought about the things in the bag and the games they'd
played with Pauline and Garry. Tomorrow she'd be in charge; there would be no
Pauline to guide her. That, in itself, was a little scary; she was so used to
having others make decisions for her, be it Tom, Pauline or her boss at work.
Now she would be calling the shots.

&nbsp;

*******

&nbsp;

The next afternoon Tom�s speed was barely legal as he drove
home along the motorway. There were the inevitable hold-ups due to roadworks
near Stoke and he drummed his fingers on the dashboard in impatience. He did,
however, think to buy some flowers on the way, and not from a garage, Mary�s
reaction to the last bunch he had given her had shown him that this was a
winner. At last he pulled into the drive and, grabbing the flowers and his bag
from the boot, went into the house.

&nbsp;

During the day Mary had been thinking about the evening
ahead. She'd sorted out what she was going to wear, until the lingerie order
arrived there wasn't much choice, and made sure the house was clean and tidy.
Really Tom ought to be doing the housework but there wasn't time for that, and
she knew she wouldn't get into the spirit of things if she were distracted by
noticing that, for example, the carpet needed vacuuming. She'd decided to have
a long hot bath, always her favourite way to relax and� had prepared the bathroom, sorting out some
nice bath oils and setting out the scented candles when it had struck her, the
bath could wait.

&nbsp;

She'd gone back to the bedroom, found her scissors, a
vanity mirror and her electric razor. Carefully, very carefully, she'd
re-trimmed her pubic hair until it was a nice neat triangle which enhanced,
rather than hid, her charms. She thought about shaving it all off but the
thought of a five-o-clock shadow worried her. She didn't want it to be� rough and itchy. Then she got dressed in
smart, but respectable, clothes and got on with the housework.

&nbsp;

******

&nbsp;

�Mary, it's me. I'm home.� Tom called out as he came
through the front door.

&nbsp;

�I'm upstairs, in the bedroom.� Mary called out in return.
Tom leapt up the stairs. In the bedroom! He couldn't wait, but his face
fell when he found Mary, sitting at her dressing table, smartly, but not
particularly sexily, dressed. All the way home he'd been hoping she would be
ready for action, heaven knows, he was.

&nbsp;

�Oh, darling. Are those for me?� Mary smiled when she saw
the flowers. �How thoughtful. I thought we'd eat at the Fairfield Arms
tonight.�

&nbsp;

�But... But...� Tom stuttered.

&nbsp;

�What? Did you think I was going to cook tonight? As
you can barely manage beans on toast I suggest you take your wife out for a
nice meal, and if you behave yourself, we'll see what happens next.�

&nbsp;

�Ok.� Tom was disappointed, but he could see Mary's point.

&nbsp;

�Go and take a shower, you're all hot and sweaty, and put
your dirty clothes in the basket. I don't want to have to pick up after you.�
Mary took the flowers and went off to find a vase. Tom undressed and went to
shower and shave. When he returned Mary was sitting on the bed waiting for him.
The pink panties lay beside her. She picked them up and handed them to him.

&nbsp;

�These will help remind you who's boss tonight. Now hurry
up, I'm hungry.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Mistress.� Tom took the panties from her.

&nbsp;

�I'm not sure I want you to call me Mistress, it's
Pauline's word and it sounds too much like I'm your bit on the side. Ma'am, that
will do. You will call me Ma'am.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Ma'am. Certainly, Ma'am.� Tom got dressed as quickly
as he could and they went out to eat. 

&nbsp;

The Fairfield Arms was a pretty standard family pub; the
food, whilst nothing special, was quite adequate and it had the advantage of
being a short drive from their house. When they got there Mary chose a quiet
table, away from the centre of the room, where they could chat privately. They
chose their meals and Tom went off to order. When he returned he was about to
take the chair opposite Mary.

&nbsp;

�No, Tom, come and sit next to me. I want you within
reach.� Tom moved round to the chair next to Mary and shuffled it a bit closer.
Mary reached over and rested her hand on his thigh. �So, did you play with
yourself last night?�

&nbsp;

�No, Ma'am. You told me not to.� Tom replied. Mary walked
her fingers a little further up his thigh.

&nbsp;

�Good, then I guess you're all ready for tonight.� Mary
moved her hand a little higher. Tom shifted in his seat, both to move closer to
Mary and to disentangle himself as his penis was stiffening and getting caught
in his panties. Mary stroked him through his trousers. Tom glanced around
nervously. �Oh, you are getting excited. Don't worry, nobody can see us.�

&nbsp;

As if to disprove her point the waitress arrived with their
starters. They drew apart but Tom felt she gave them a knowing look, as if they
hadn't been that discrete after all. Several times during the meal Mary reached
down, giving Tom a stroke or two, keeping him on edge. Tom was eating quite
fast, not exactly gobbling his food down but anxious to get on. Mary, in
contrast, was deliberately taking it slowly, savouring both her food and the
situation.

&nbsp;

�That's me finished, I'll go and settle up.� Tom announced
as he wiped the last of his raspberry Pavlova from his chin.

&nbsp;

�But darling, I'm having so much fun. It's not often we eat
out together, let's not rush things.� Mary moved closer to Tom and replaced her
hand on his thigh. She leaned across and whispered in his ear. �After all,
honey, waiting is part of the pleasure.�

&nbsp;

Tom wasn't so sure. Not masturbating after Mary had got him
all wound up had been part of the game, and spending this morning in a meeting
dreaming about what to expect when he got home instead of concentrating on
sales figures for the North East during the third quarter had give the day a
certain edge, but now he was home he was ready to go and Mary�s hand wasn�t
making things any easier. 

&nbsp;

�Wait until you see your collar, just like a little
doggie�s.� Mary manipulated him through his trousers until he was fully erect.
�Would you like to be my little doggy tonight? Good little doggies get all
sorts of treats, but bad doggies, now what should I do if you�re a bad doggy?�

&nbsp;

Out of the corner of her eye Mary saw the waitress arriving
to clear their table. She pulled away.

&nbsp;

�Was everything Ok for you?� the waitress asked.

&nbsp;

�Oh, yes, just perfect.� Mary replied. Tom was too
flustered to do more than grunt and he couldn�t look the waitress in the eye.

&nbsp;

�Now I think it�s time we left, off you go and pay.� Mary
said. Tom stood up, all too aware of the bulge in his trousers. He�d thought
for a moment about asking Mary if he could wait until it had subsided a bit,
but he could tell what the answer would be. He felt as if every eye in the room
was on him as he made his way to the bar, although, in reality, nobody noticed.
His mind was spinning, on the one hand he was a pent up ball of frustration, on
the other hand he had to admit that he loved being teased by this newfound wife
of his. She was so much more desirable; he couldn�t wait to get her back home,
to� But he really didn�t know what she had in store for him and that was part
of the excitement.

&nbsp;

As he returned to the table Mary got up, and without a word
walked towards the door. Tom followed behind her. When she got to the car she
just stopped, waiting by the passenger door. For a moment or two Tom was
flummoxed, why had she stopped? The penny dropped and he rushed over to open it
for her.

&nbsp;

�That�s better, but don�t take so long next time.� Mary got
in the car and Tom went round to the driver�s side. They drove the short
distance home in silence and when they arrived Tom had the sense to leap out
and open the door for her. Mary was getting a real buzz from all the attention,
any woman likes to be treated like a princess, and this was all hers for the
asking. Tom went to the front door, opened it, and stood back to let her
through.

&nbsp;

�Thank you, Now upstairs, in the bedroom! I want you
properly dressed. I�ll be up in a moment. Tom leapt up the stairs and started
stripping. He was down to his pink panties when Mary arrived carrying the
apron, which she handed to him. As Tom put it on she opened the overnight bag
and found the collar.

&nbsp;

�Kneel!� She ordered and Tom did as he was told. She
fastened the collar round his neck, adjusting it so that the D ring was at the
front.

&nbsp;

�There, that�s better. Don�t you look sweet? My little
slave, on his knees before me all dressed up in his lovely pink panties, his
frilly apron and his collar. I think we need a tag for your collar. We�ll have
to buy one in town tomorrow. �Ma�am�s Slave�, that�s what we�ll get, don�t you
agree?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Ma�am.� Tom replied.

&nbsp;

�Now go and run me a bath.� She ordered. Tom went to the
bathroom and turned on the taps. He could see the candles Mary had set out
earlier so he lit them and switched off the overhead light. As the water ran he
looked through the various bottles and, somewhat haphazardly, chose one to pour
in the bath. Immediately a sensuous aroma filled the room. The tub was nearly
full, and he was turning down the taps, adjusting the final temperature, when
Mary arrived, stark naked. Tom stared at her, he was getting used to her having
trimmed pubic hair but she had obviously made the effort for tonight. He
thought she looked sooo sexy. She walked past him and slipped into the
bath. Tom stood up.

&nbsp;

�Where do you think you�re going? I demand the fullest
service from my personal slave. The sponge is over there. Get on with
it.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Ma'am.� Tom took the sponge and knelt down next to the
bath. He dipped it in the water and was heading for Mary�s crotch when she
stopped him.

&nbsp;

�Start with my feet, and make it good.� Tom did as he was
told. Although his initial instincts were to go for the, as he thought of it,
sexy bits, he was finding that washing Mary was more an act of worship.� She did look gorgeous, lying there, relaxed
in the bath. As he ran the sponge along her calves she sighed deeply. Giving
'Ma'am' pleasure was giving Tom pleasure and, although he wouldn�t have thought
of this as particularly sexy before, his penis was stirring in response.
Indeed, he was so getting into the spirit of the thing that when he reached the
top of Mary�s thighs, instead of plunging between her legs, as would have been
his first instinct, he moved on to her arms.

&nbsp;

Mary was in seventh
heaven; this was so much better than bathing on her own. Tom, the little
sweetie, was being very attentive and not clumsily groping her, as she had
feared. Now that he�d finished her arms, he was soaping her breasts and if he
was being a little over zealous, she couldn�t blame him, nor did she mind. Her
nipples tingled under the warm water and she almost pulled his head down to
make him kiss them but that would have spoiled the mood, she wasn�t going to
rush this. Tom worked down her body and started on her pubic area. The sponge
worked against the short hairs, the warm water swirled between her legs, and
Mary arched her back, revelling in the delicious feelings. Tom took this as his
cue and gently ran the sponge up and down, up and down. Mary let him do this
for a little while, but she didn�t want to go too far, not yet.

&nbsp;

�That�s enough.� She pushed Tom away, stood up, and got out
of the bath. For a moment Tom just knelt there, wondering what was expected of
him, until Mary handed him a towel off the rack. Tom dried her, starting at her
shoulders and working down. When he finished he was on his knees in front of
her and he bent forward and kissed her feet.

&nbsp;

�Very sweet. Now, back to the bedroom. No, don�t get up,
stay on your knees.� With Tom shuffling along behind her Mary returned to the
bedroom. Whilst Tom had been running the bath she had laid out on the bed her
basque, her French knickers and some stockings. She slipped on the basque and
then turned with her back to Tom. 

&nbsp;

�Lace me up, good and tight.� Tom did as he was told. As
the laces tightened Mary found the basque drawing her more and more upright.
She stood taller, both physically and mentally. The basque emphasised her waist
and kept those annoying little bulges under control. She glanced in the mirror
and liked what she saw. Then she got Tom to help her on with the stockings,
although he had trouble getting the seams straight. She stood back from him and
slipped on the French knickers and her high-heeled shoes to complete the
outfit. She went to the bag and fetched two wrist cuffs with chains attached.

&nbsp;

�That�s me all nicely dressed, I think it�s time we dealt
with you. I want you kneeling with your back towards the foot of the bed, yes,
that�s right, now stretch out your arms.� She took the cuffs and attached his
wrist to the footboard of the bed, one at each side, keeping the chains tight
enough to hold him fast. Then she knelt down in front of him, reached down
under his apron, and held his penis and testicles through his panties.

&nbsp;

�You�ve been quite a good little boy today. It was
thoughtful of you to bring me flowers and, because you�ve been good, I�ll let
you kiss my breasts. Would you like to kiss my breasts?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, please, Ma�am� He leaned forward, straining against
the chains that held him, but, as he did so, Mary leaned back, keeping herself
just out of reach. Occasionally she would let his lips brush against her
nipples, but never for long.

&nbsp;

�You�ll have to do much better than that.� She teased. Tom
strained against the chains, his shoulders complaining in agony as he tried to
push himself far enough to reach. As Mary leaned back she didn�t let go of
Tom�s testicles but pulled harder, adding to the pain. He made one last effort,
straining so much the tendons in his neck stood out like ropes until his head
flopped forwards and he knelt there panting gently.

&nbsp;

�Well, if you can�t do it, it looks like I�ll have to do it
for myself.� Mary got up and arranged a chair facing Tom. She sat down in front
of him and started to caress a nipple with her left hand. Her right hand slid
beneath the waistband of her knickers, her fingers rubbing in circles beneath
them. A few more circles and she slipped two fingers inside, parting her lips
and massaging her clitoris. Tom looked on, wide-eyed. Even now he was having
problems coming to terms with this new Mary. As far as he knew she had never
touched herself before and now she was masturbating in front of him. The tease
was really getting to him, he wanted release, his penis strained against his
panties, but far more he wanted to pleasure Mary, it should be his tongue, not
her fingers, that caressed her. He�d give anything, anything to be allowed to
do so.

&nbsp;

�Please, Ma�am, oh pleeeease�� He begged.

&nbsp;

�Please, what, slave?�

&nbsp;

�Please may I lick you? Please, you know I�ll be good.�

&nbsp;

�Is this what you want?� Mary removed her hand from her
knickers and held her fingers under his nose.

&nbsp;

�Yes, please, Ma�am.� Tom licked the end of her fingers,
savouring the taste.

&nbsp;

�You haven�t earned that yet. I�ve got a job for you first.� She unclipped his wrist cuffs
from the chains and refastened them behind his back. She then took two more
cuffs and put them around his ankles, connected together with just enough slack
so that he could shuffle about.

&nbsp;

�Who�s are those?� Mary pointed to a pile of clothes on the
floor left when Tom had stripped off when they had returned from the pub.

&nbsp;

�They�re mine, Ma�am.�

&nbsp;

�And do they belong on the floor?�

&nbsp;

�No, Ma�am. I�m sorry, Ma�am.�

&nbsp;

�Put them in the washing basket where they belong. Now!� Tom shuffled over and tried to
reach down behind himself with his hands. �Use your teeth, you silly boy. Pick
them up with your teeth. I don�t expect to ever have to ask you again. I will
not put up with slovenly untidiness from my slaves.�

&nbsp;

�Ess, Mmmm.� Tom replied as he shuffled backwards and
forwards, his mouth full of� clothes.
Mary chided him for being slow and clumsy. When he had finished he returned to
in front of Mary and bowed his head.

&nbsp;

�Now I�m going to punish you. Do you know why?� Mary asked.

&nbsp;

�Because I left my clothes on the floor, Ma�am.� Tom
replied.

&nbsp;

�Yes, but that�s not all.�

&nbsp;

�Because� because� I don�t know, Ma�am.�

&nbsp;

�Because you�re my slave and I can. Now, bend over the side
of the bed.� Tom did as he was told and Mary went to the bag. She was about to
pick up the paddle when she decided to use the tawse instead. After all, she�d
already used a paddle, and she was intrigued by what the tawse would do. As she
went round behind Tom she was beginning to regret not buying a leg spreader, it
would have been nice to be able to reach between his legs and give him a little
tweak now and then. Still, there was plenty of time for that, they could always
buy one before the next session. She pulled down his panties so that they lay
in the crease at the bottom of his buttocks. They were taught and stretched and
she could only imagine how they must be pulling on his penis. She lined herself
up and�

&nbsp;

THWACK!

&nbsp;

�What do you say?�

&nbsp;

�Thank you, thank you, Ma�am.�

&nbsp;

Mary looked at Tom�s buttocks. Whereas the paddle had left
a general redness, the tawse left a vivid wheal, a bright line of red. She
aimed carefully and�

&nbsp;

THWACK!

&nbsp;

�Arrgh! Thank you, Ma�am.� The second line was perfectly
parallel to the first. Somehow this appealed to Mary�s tidy nature. If she
could get the third one in between�

&nbsp;

THWACK!

&nbsp;

�Ohhhh! Thank you, Ma�am.� Slowly, scientifically, Mary
laid into Tom�s backside. The last time she had done this it had been in a fit
of rage, this time she was cooler, calmer, which gave her time to appreciate it
properly. The thrill of the power, the power to inflict this pain, the power
over Tom, was a strong turn on which awoke a wicked streak within her. Tom, for
his part, was obviously suffering, he was taking longer and longer between the
strokes falling and saying thank you, and his voice had become a whimper.
Still, he hadn�t used the stop word. Now that his buttocks were covered in red
wheals she moved on to his upper thighs. Tom�s reaction showed that this was,
if anything, more painful and he was near the limit of what he could take. One,
two more, and then one for luck and she stood back and watched as Tom lay
there, biting the duvet, the muscles of his buttocks and thighs working as he
let the pain subside.

&nbsp;

Once Tom had got his breath back she ordered him onto the
bed. Quickly she rearranged his bonds so that he lay spread-eagled, tied to the
four corners. Then she fetched the blindfold and fitted it across his eyes,
making sure that it fitted snugly. Kicking off her shoes she lay down on the
bed beside him.

&nbsp;

�Now then, what are we going to do with you?� She whispered
in his ear. Her hand reached down and grasped his penis and testicles through
his panties. �Shall I let you come? Do you think you�ve been good enough?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, please, Ma�am.�

&nbsp;

�Ooh, that was the wrong answer.� Mary gave Tom�s testicles
a squeeze. �You�re still thinking about yourself. A good little slave puts his
Mistress�s needs first. You shouldn�t be thinking about whether you will be
allowed to come, but about how you will serve me. I think I�m going to keep you
tied up all night, I�ll keep you nice and hard, I like to see you hard for me,
but I�m not going to let you find relief. Maybe then you�ll learn that I come
first.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Ma�am.� Tom
groaned. This was Tom�s fantasies come true. Many of his favourite stories in
�Bondage Slaves� had been about exactly this, tied up and teased but never
allowed release. The real thing, however, was another matter. Whilst reading
the stories his hand had been pumping away and release was always imminent. Now
his balls felt like overripe melons, his prick throbbed with the need to come
and Mary�s teasing was making it worse, or should that be better?

&nbsp;

Mary was loving every second. She could see Tom�s dilemma,
how he wanted release, and also wanted to be denied release, and the feeling of
power, of being in control, was a strong aphrodisiac. She rolled against him,
moving her leg so that his thigh rested between hers. Sensuously she rubbed
herself up and down, adding a physical aspect to the turn on. She bent her head
down and kissed Tom�s nipple, gently at first, and then biting with her teeth.
She could feel Tom squirming beneath her, but she wanted more, another harder
bite and�

&nbsp;

�Aaahhh.�

&nbsp;

�What�s up, Tom? Am I biting too hard?� Mary asked
playfully.

&nbsp;

�Yes. No. I don�t know.� And Tom really didn�t know. The
pain was incredible, Mary was biting very hard, and part of him wanted her to
stop. However the stab of pain from his nipple ran like a bolt of lightning to
his groin further fuelling the tension there. What with that, Mary�s hand
around his genitals, oh how he wished she�d stroke him instead of just
squeezing, and the feeling of her body rubbing against him, the erotic charge
was fantastic. But it wasn�t just the physical feelings, the very idea that
Mary, his mild, passive Mary, had turned into this goddess, this goddess of
pain, that she was getting as aroused as him by what she was doing, by the pain
she was inflicting, was a thrill more powerful than any story he�d read. If
only, if only she�d stroke him instead of squeezing.

&nbsp;

�Please, please, Ma�am.� He gasped through the pain.

.

�Please what?� Mary detached herself and leant up.

&nbsp;

�Please�� Tom was about to ask, nay beg, to be allowed to
come but he quickly thought better of it. �Please may I lick you, please may I
make you come?�

&nbsp;

�That�s better. Now you�re learning.� She moved away from
Tom and knelt up. Carefully she manoeuvred herself so she was across his
shoulders, facing the headboard. She was still wearing the French knickers but
they were loose enough to let her pull the silky material to one side. She
lowered herself over Tom�s face, but, still in a teasing mood, only so far that
he had to reach up. With her fingers she spread her lips so that Tom could
reach her clitoris, as long as he stretched far enough, that is.

&nbsp;

Tom reached up with
his head, pushing his tongue out as far as it would go. He could taste Mary�s
arousal and her clitoris was swollen and hard. He flicked his tongue from side
to side, grateful, yes, grateful, to be allowed to do so. Mary held herself
above him for a few moments and then settled down, resting more of her weight
on his face. Tom was finding it hard to breath, but the combination of the
taste, the smell, the feel of Mary, his beloved Mary, smothering him was
driving him wild with desire. Feverishly he worked his tongue back and forth.
The muscles in Mary�s legs either side of his head tensed and relaxed as the
pleasure, pleasure he was causing, washed through her.

&nbsp;

Mary�s knuckles were white as she gripped the headboard.
Tom�s tongue was working its magic between her thighs and she was losing
herself to the passionate animal within. Wave after wave crashed through her. Oh,
yes that was good, so good, so, so, so gooood! She forced herself down on
him, mindless of whether she was suffocating him or not, as the next wave rose
within her, this one more powerful, more all consuming, more� Oh YES!!!
She threw her head back, her whole body shaking, every nerve singing in delight
as she rode and crested the final wave. Overcome at last she slumped forward
and slipped sideways collapsing back on the bed. She reached for Tom and hugged
herself to him, lost in the moment, letting the glorious feeling subside within
her.

&nbsp;

But Mary wasn�t sated yet, she wanted, no needed, to feel
Tom inside her. She glanced down, he was still as hard as ever, but she
wondered how long he could control himself. If he were to come too soon it
would destroy this sexual high that she was riding. She moved to kneel across his
body and leant forward.

&nbsp;

�I�m going to fuck you now,� Mary�s lust had over come her
dislike of the �f� word. �I�m going to use your body to satisfy my needs. If
you come, if you dare come, before I�m ready I'll make sure you live to regret
it. Do you understand?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Ma�am.� For all Mary's threats Tom wondered if he�d
be able to comply. He�d been on edge, sexually, for twenty-four hours and was
on a hair trigger. Mary tugged the front of his panties down so that they were
caught underneath his testicles. Then, pulling her knickers to one side, she
lifted his penis until it was vertical and guided it into her. Tom, whilst not
massive, was generously built and she loved the feel as she impaled herself on
him, pushing herself down, taking every inch she could. She knew that if she
were to move too much Tom, for all her threats, wouldn�t be able to control
himself so she stayed still, savouring the feeling. Her hand slipped beneath
the waistband of her knickers and her fingers delved into her groin, sliding
easily against her most sensitive areas. Her other hand reached for her
breasts, massaging them, teasing the nipples. She eased herself back and forth
in a steady rocking motion.

&nbsp;

Tom fought to control himself. The blindfold seemed to
enhance his other senses, making him more aware of all the sensations within
him. Thank heavens Mary was hardly moving, anything more and his efforts would
have been in vain. The tip of his glans seemed to be on fire with a delicious
tingle and Mary�s internal muscles rippled against him as she rocked back and
forth. Mary had started to moan softly, almost whispering �Oh, that�s good,
that�s so good.� And this only added to the fire within him. He couldn�t hold
himself back much longer, he was going to come, he was close, he was so close,
and then he felt Mary�s vagina tighten as she climaxed, and with a massive
groan he arched his back, forcing himself as deep as he could go, spurt after
spurt after spurt of pent up semen shot from him and he emptied himself deep
within her.

&nbsp;

Mary slumped forward and lay across Tom. For a few moments
they lay like that, getting their breath back, relaxing as the feelings died
away. Then Mary reached up and released Tom�s wrists before rolling over to lie
beside him. Tom took off his blindfold and sat up to release his ankles. Free
from his bonds he reached over and gathered Mary into his arms.

&nbsp;

�That was fantastic, absolutely fantastic. Thank you, my
darling.�

&nbsp;

�Your performance was � satisfactory.� Mary replied. �How�s
you bottom.�

&nbsp;

�Smarting a bit but that�s how I like it. I guess I won�t
be sitting comfortably for a day or two�

&nbsp;

Mary got out of bed to take off her clothes. Her basque was
Ok but her knickers were a sodden mess. She tossed them into the washing basket
and, getting back into bed, snuggled back into Tom�s arms.

&nbsp;

�Tom?� Mary was suddenly serious. �You remember the other
night, when we played with Pauline and Gary?�

&nbsp;

�Remember it? I�ll not forget that in a hurry!�

&nbsp;

�Shall we do it again?� Mary was getting to the nub of the
matter.

&nbsp;

�Yeah, yeah, I�d like to. Have you and that minx Pauline
been planning something?�

&nbsp;

�Not yet. I wanted to make sure you were Ok with it first.
But, you know how you fancy Pauline...?� Mary left the question hanging.

&nbsp;

�Er� Where is this leading?� Suddenly Tom was getting
nervous.

&nbsp;

�Well, what about the other way round? What I mean is, last
time it was all strictly between couples, Pauline and Garry did their thing,
and you and I had our thing, but what if we mixed it between the couples? What
about Pauline and you, or me and Garry?

&nbsp;

There was a long silence. Tom hadn�t thought about this.
Sure he�d had his fantasies about the sexy next door neighbour, but that was
all they were, fantasies, and, as for the thought of watching his mate Garry
with Mary� But then, things had got hot and steamy that night, and he�d done
things he�d never dreamed of doing. He wasn�t at all certain where the
boundaries lay.

&nbsp;

�Look, darling,� he said at last, �I love you, I love only
you, and my flirting with Pauline means nothing. I�d never go behind your back
with her. You know that, don�t you?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, sweetie, I do know that, and it goes both ways, of
course. But, and there is a 'but' coming, isn't there... ?� Mary asked.

&nbsp;

�Yes, there is, because we both did things that
night that we never thought we�d do. What about you with Pauline? That was a
pretty hot number. Should I be getting jealous of you two?�

&nbsp;

�Ok, I get your point.� Mary thought for a moment. �How
about this? We both agree that we�ll never do anything when the other isn�t
present, and we both agree to use the �stop� word if we get uncomfortable with
what�s going on. In fact Pauline and I agreed a separate stop word, lettuce,
which means we don�t want to stop, exactly, but were getting uncomfortable
about the direction things are going. How does that sound?�

&nbsp;

�That works for me, but what is it with Pauline and green
vegetables?� They both laughed. �Oh, and can I take this collar off now.�

&nbsp;

Mary pulled back from Tom and looked at him thoughtfully.

&nbsp;

�No. I think you should keep it on for tonight. And your
panties. You�re so much nicer when you�re my little slave. Talking of little
slaves, my knickers are hand wash only. I had to do them last time, I don�t
think I should from now on, understood?� Tom nodded in agreement. �Now come and
give me another kiss.� 

&nbsp;

Mary put her arms around Tom�s neck and pulled him back to
her. As they kissed she felt Tom�s penis stir. It was beginning to look like
tonight wasn�t over quite yet, and, although they had had plenty of sex, it
would be nice to end up making love. She hugged him a little closer and felt
Tom respond in kind.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Saturday found Mary and Tom shopping in town. They passed a
key cutting shop and Mary pointed out to Tom that they also did tags for pet
collars. Dragging him by the hand Mary led Tom inside. They looked at the
displays and Mary chose one in a heart shape.

&nbsp;

�That�s the one, go on, get it engraved.� Mary said. Tom
looked up. The only free assistant was a sixteen-year-old girl doing a Saturday
job. Mary nudged him hard and he went over to the counter.

&nbsp;

�Er� I�d like a dog tag please. That one, the heart shaped
one.�

&nbsp;

�Certainly, sir. And what should I engrave on it?�

&nbsp;

�Ma�am�s Slave.� Tom said as quietly as he could.

&nbsp;

�Sorry, I didn�t quite catch what you said.�

&nbsp;

�Ma�am�s Slave� Tom repeated, his face now bright red. The
girl gave him a knowing look and, giggling to herself, took the tag from the
case and put it in the engraving machine.

&nbsp;

�There you go.� She said when she had finished. She gave
Tom a bright smile. �That will be two pounds fifty. Shall I wrap it or will you
wear it?�

&nbsp;

Tom scrabbled to find the change, handed it to the girl,
grabbed the tag and, without another word, hurried from the shop. The girl
looked over at Mary and gave her a wink.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

As on every other Sunday morning, Tom and Garry went off to
football together. Once they had left Mary went round next door for their usual
cuppa. Pauline had already put the kettle on and was sorting out the teacups
when she arrived.

&nbsp;

�Hi there. How did you get on with your purchases?� Pauline
asked with a twinkle in her eye.

&nbsp;

�Oh, fine. Tom�s a little sweetie when I want him to be.�

&nbsp;

�I told you men like to be dominated. But what about you?
How are you getting on?�

&nbsp;

�Do you know,� Mary began, thoughtfully, �I never thought
I�d be into all this. You must remember how shocked I was when I found that
magazine? But now I�ve got into it, well, it�s like I�ve discovered a whole new
me. I love being in control. It was a little scary at first, I�m not used to
demanding things, or getting them, but now I�m loving every minute of it.

&nbsp;

�But what really gets to me,� she continued, �is not the
sex part. Don�t get me wrong, the sex is great, I�ve had more orgasms in the
last few days than I�ve had in ages. No, it�s the being worshipped. Last night
I had Tom, on his knees, begging to be allowed to kiss me. I�m have a fine time
up on this pedestal; after all the years I�ve run around looking to his needs
it�s nice to have him looking to mine.�

&nbsp;

�Wow, listen to you! I must admit I never saw you as the
bitch goddess.�

&nbsp;

�I didn�t either, but that�s the point, I�m discovering
things about myself I never knew existed.�

&nbsp;

�And are you still up for foursomes?� Pauline asked.

&nbsp;

�Yeah, I�m still on, but you sound very keen. What�s up? Do
you want to get your hands on my Tom or something?�

&nbsp;

�No! Mary!� Pauline blushed. �Well, Ok, maybe a little, but
nothing without your consent, you know I wouldn�t do that. It�s just, after we
were talking the other day, it started an itch in me. I can�t stop wondering
what it would be like to go with someone other than Garry, and this way, with
your permission, of course, I can scratch that itch, and nobody gets hurt.�

&nbsp;

�Ok, Ok.� Mary was secretly delighted. Not that she was
particularly keen to see Tom and Pauline together, she knew that the whole
foursomes thing was an emotional minefield and they would have to tread
carefully. No, it was the sight of Pauline feeling flustered. And with Pauline
confessing to wanting Tom to scratch her itch, well that gave her an edge; if
she was careful she could use that edge to turn the tables on Pauline just as
she�d turned them on Tom.

&nbsp;

�How about next weekend, Saturday night maybe?� Mary
suggested.

&nbsp;

�I can�t I�m due the curse soon and I won�t have finished
by then. Can we make it the Saturday after?�

&nbsp;

�That suits me. My place or yours?�

&nbsp;
