Synopsis:   Sub and Dom relearn their relationship after a 3 year hiatus.






 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It had been three years.&nbsp; Three looooooong years as far as her libido was concerned.&nbsp; She&#8217;d stayed far away from all of it; buried herself in her awful temp job that had since become a permanent secretary position, not that it&#8217;s permanence made it any better, just more predictable.&nbsp; She&#8217;d aided her ailing mother until she&#8217;d died six months before and her sister was so far AWOL she hadn&#8217;t even shown to the funeral.&nbsp; She was alone and emotionally destitute when not so long ago her life had been rich and wonderful.&nbsp; So, in desperate need for something, anything, she went back looking for something like she&#8217;d had before.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Three and a half years ago they were all so happy.&nbsp; Her mother was well, her father was alive, her sister was a well adjusted child and her job was interesting and varied.&nbsp; And there was Him, her loving . . . No!&nbsp; She stopped herself and pulled her coat tighter around her shoulders.&nbsp; She scanned the area nervously as if just thinking about Him would summon His attention.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Three years and three months ago her father had been in a horrible car accident.&nbsp; The EMT&#8217;s saved him even though he was DOA and months of emergency surgery, ICU and drug encouraged comatose sleeping later, mother nature wrested control back from the doctors and he died.&nbsp; And her happy life, her whole world, began to unravel.&nbsp; She had to be the strong one as her mother spiraled into a dark depression and her sister took to screwing anything with an Adam&#8217;s apple and snorting anything she could grind into powder.&nbsp; Every night she went home to Him and He was there for her, she could cry on His shoulder.&nbsp; She could be everyone else&#8217;s rock as long as He was hers.&nbsp; And then it all went wrong.&nbsp; Her mind unwillingly searched back to that night.&nbsp; She came home, shaking and stumbling and fell into His arms as usual.&nbsp; He listened to her retell her day and shake and cry out her sorrow in supportive silence and when she&#8217;d finished He drew her up to eye level.&nbsp; He said she wasn&#8217;t taking enough care of . . . NO! 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She shook out her head again.&nbsp; That was a long time ago.&nbsp; She was looking for something new and exciting, not old ghosts.&nbsp; She tossed her artfully piled curls and clicked her four inch heels into the squat building in front of her, prepared for everything.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He saw her walk in, He&#8217;d been waiting for her.&nbsp; She was just as gorgeous as He remembered as she slipped out of her overcoat and handed it to the coat check girl.&nbsp; Her crimson dress was nearly the most conservative outfit in the room but it must have felt risqu� to her.&nbsp; Backless with a halter tie around the back of her neck, it hugged her curves deliciously and He could see from across the room that she wore no bra and possibly no panties either.&nbsp; She wore a simple golden chain around her neck signaling her submissive nature and no tag of ownership.&nbsp; He glared around the room and was annoyed to find He wasn&#8217;t the only dom who noticed her.&nbsp; He&#8217;d never felt so impotent.&nbsp; By the end of the night surely one of those doms would have her and He couldn&#8217;t do a thing.&nbsp; He couldn&#8217;t even approach her, He&#8217;d acted so badly three years ago.&nbsp; He ran His fingers through His hair angrily.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was just trying to care for her.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t understand.&nbsp; It was the fourteenth day straight she had come home emotionally and physically wrought and had laid in His arms to cry and gibber for hours.&nbsp; Her mother was failing and her sister was rebelling and her father was dead.&nbsp; She said she had to be strong for them but she was even more wrought then the rest of them not just from his death but from the burden of the rest of them.&nbsp; She was killing herself.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t eat, didn&#8217;t sleep, so at the end of the second week He told her He wanted her as a full-time slave.&nbsp; It was a formality really, she&#8217;d already been His slave for months and she lived with Him and enjoyed His dominion but He wanted that next step, really He&#8217;d wanted to separate her from her family a little, let her have her time to grieve before she killed herself being strong for them.&nbsp; But she recoiled, she&#8217;d thrown up her walls and instead of easing into it, taking His time and convincing, He pushed and in doing so pushed her straight out of His life.&nbsp; She&#8217;d run and never looked back.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He sighed and took a long draught of His beer.&nbsp; He knew how fragile she&#8217;d been, known that she needed Him to hold her up but His pigheadedness had gotten in His way.&nbsp; Of course, His way was right, He was Master, He hadn&#8217;t seen that she couldn&#8217;t leave her family as He wanted.&nbsp; By the time He had realized His mistake she was gone.&nbsp; He continued to watch over her, but He didn&#8217;t chase, He waited and watched.&nbsp; He&#8217;d scared her away from the lifestyle and had to wait until she could come back on her own.&nbsp; It took all He had not to claim her when her mother died and when her sister vanished but here she was, in a BDSM club, with the eyes of every wolf in the vicinity on her ample charms.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A dom in the corner got up and started towards her, and He had to make a decision.&nbsp; Leave her alone and hope she stayed unattached or go to her and risk her rejection.&nbsp; He saw the wolf get nearer and suddenly it was no longer a choice, estranged or not, she was still His and no one was going to touch His property.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She saw Him head towards her and it took a sheer effort of will not to drop to her knees before Him.&nbsp; She turned toward the other dom making a beeline for her and put Him out of her mind.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You new here, darlin&#8217;?� the dom wondered, a sexy drawl making his voice purr.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yep.� she answered lightly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You wanna play?� he purred, he ran a couple fingers down her collar bone following the path of the gold chain she wore. His touch didn&#8217;t make her shiver with anticipation nearly as much as the hot jealous stare she felt between her shoulder blades.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Maybe a drink first, eh, tiger?� she smiled.&nbsp; The dom wasn&#8217;t thrilled with that response but he obligingly led her to the bar and ordered for her.&nbsp; Fruity drinks weren&#8217;t her thing, but, she reasoned, he wasn&#8217;t her dom.&nbsp; When the drinks came, hers a frilly slushy with some kind of liquor, another came with it.&nbsp; A rum and coke.&nbsp; The dom raised his eyes at the barman but he shrugged.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�For the lady, man said she&#8217;d know who it was from.� he shrugged and walked away.&nbsp; Rum and coke was her drink.&nbsp; She forced herself not to look around and meet his gaze, she&#8217;d be lost if she did that.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Thought you said you were new here darlin&#8217;.� the dom wondered, bordering on angry.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;ve never been here before and I&#8217;ve been on hiatus from the lifestyle for years, must be the wrong person.� she told him, nevertheless she drank the rum and coke and completely ignored the fruity frozen concoction.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They talked for a little, she explained her hiatus minimally and he talked about his life and work.&nbsp; Soon the bar and dance floor began to clear, people were going to find private playrooms or to see the show.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You want to see the show, darlin&#8217;?� he wondered, courteously assuming she wasn&#8217;t ready to play.&nbsp; She was ready to play, she just didn&#8217;t want him as a playmate.&nbsp; So she smiled and nodded and he escorted her into the theatre.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t feel the hot stare on her back anymore and so she fooled herself into believing he&#8217;d gone, left her be.&nbsp; She should have known better.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They took their seats as the lights darkened and a low sorrowful tune played.&nbsp; The stage lights came on and fell on a couch and a couple lying on it.&nbsp; The girl was in a skimpy t-shirt and shorts, like what she normally wore to bed and the man wore a pair of leather pants.&nbsp; She was lying prone on him, sobbing terribly but she soon quieted.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You&#8217;re in so much pain, let me give you a little release.� he whispered and she nodded, looking up at him with desire and sorrow and hope.&nbsp; Her breath caught in her throat and she came very close to passing out before she noticed she wasn&#8217;t breathing.&nbsp; The show was familiar; in fact it was identical to her last night with Him.&nbsp; She watched the show with halting breath but she wasn&#8217;t seeing the actors she was seeing her own history.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Let me ease that pain a bit.� He whispered.&nbsp; He slowly relieved her of her clothes, what little she wore, just a ragged t-shirt and a pair of booty shorts.&nbsp; She stood before Him naked and still a little blush crept across her face and neck.&nbsp; He smiled at the blush and cupped her overwarm cheek, He enjoyed her odd discomfort, she had been naked before Him many times but every time she blushed.&nbsp; He took her hands His eyes never leaving hers and kissed them, the backs then the wrists then every fingertip as He fastened the soft leather cuffs around them.&nbsp; With a snick they were locked together and ever so gently, he drew them above her head to a hook hanging from the ceiling.&nbsp; It was at perfect height, high enough to hold her arms extended over her head and still allow her to stand flat on her feet.&nbsp; She moaned a little in anticipation and He captured it with His mouth, kissing her deeply, tenderly.&nbsp; He broke the kiss before her knees gave way and slipped a silk scarf over her eyes.&nbsp; The material so thin she could dimly make out light but not enough to distinguish shapes and shadows.&nbsp; She heard Him to go the cabinet and retrieve something, heard it snap through the air as He took a practice swing and heard the tinny whistle that signaled it flying through the air towards her prone body.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;SNAP!&nbsp; A dozen tiny tails flicked across her back and ass.&nbsp; She sighed with pleasure, it was a light blow, a tickle really.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;CRACK! Apparently she was only to get one warm-up strike this one burned across her flesh as every tail raised a separate welt.&nbsp; She jerked forward but that was no respite, CRACK another blow just as hard skittered over her breasts and stomach.&nbsp; A low cry slipped through her lips and she groaned.&nbsp; He took that groan from her as well swallowed it with a chaste kiss and moved away.&nbsp; SNAP, SNAP! two more stroked like the first, warming her marked flesh.&nbsp; After that He set a steady pace, harder than usual but somehow He knew that was exactly what she needed. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;CRACK, CRACK, CRACK, again and again the whip soared and scored her flesh.&nbsp; Each lash bit deep and she soon dissolved into tears and screams.&nbsp; Finally, it was done he gently unfastened her arms and held her tight as her sobs quieted again.  
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her eyes flew open as the crying girl on the stage rested in the arms of the man and the music hushed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Be mine.� was all he said and the lights went out.&nbsp; In her own history, he had said that and she&#8217;d readily agreed but after they&#8217;d made love and bathed and were in bed he began to say things like she shouldn&#8217;t spend so much time at her mother&#8217;s house and how the tutoring sessions weren&#8217;t helping her sister.&nbsp; In her own history, they&#8217;d argued for hours before he stormed out.&nbsp; In her own history, she&#8217;d left the next day and never returned. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The house lights came up and she wondered why they were so hazy until a tear splashed down her cheek.&nbsp; She brushed it away and stemmed the rest of them.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That was a powerful one.� the dom next to her commented, subtly excusing her emotional reaction.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yeah, not what I expected.� she sniffed and forced a smile.&nbsp; They headed out and she headed for the door and he followed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You think you&#8217;ll be up to play next time?� he wondered escorting her to the doors.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I might be.� she smiled encouragingly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well, if so, I&#8217;m here every week this time.� he offered.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;ll keep an eye out, thank you.� I assured him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Do you need a ride home?� he offered politely, obviously torn between not wanting to leave, not wanting to loose his chance with me and not wanting me to drive mildly inebriated.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No, I&#8217;m going to catch a cab, thanks.� I assured him, it had been my plan anyway.&nbsp; He nodded and I headed through the parking lot alone, or so I thought.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Did you enjoy the show?� a voice that haunted both her fantasy and nightmares called from the shadow.&nbsp; He stepped forward under the street light, sleek and dangerous.&nbsp; A carefully placed ease in his stance would make the unwary think he was lazy and slow.&nbsp; She was far from unwary.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m surprised at you, Bobby, you didn&#8217;t launch yourself at that dom for daring to touch your property.� she taunted, He hated being called Bobby, His name was Robert and He hated all the nicknames commonly associated with Robert but Bob most of all.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Don&#8217;t be a brat, Lil, you know very well that I would never make such a scene unless he tried to leave with you although I am glad you still identify yourself as my property.� she started to make a sharp retort but stopped when she noticed He&#8217;d drawn closer.&nbsp; A lot closer.&nbsp; Her breath hiked and her blood pressure spiked and even if she wasn&#8217;t about to admit it to herself she knew her pussy was moistening.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Robert,� she shook her head sadly, �You know as well as I that isn&#8217;t the case.&nbsp; I haven&#8217;t been your property in years.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That&#8217;s a boldface lie, Lil and you know it.� He responded stubbornly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You made a request of me that I couldn&#8217;t do, we argued and I left.&nbsp; Three years ago.&nbsp; That&#8217;s it.&nbsp; I&#8217;m surprised you&#8217;re here, it&#8217;s nice to see you, but that&#8217;s it, Robert.� she sighed and turned back toward the street.&nbsp; He strode forward and grabbed her arms and pulled her into a kiss.&nbsp; She meant to struggle, to pull away, to protest, she really did, but instead she melted.&nbsp; It was like the last three years hadn&#8217;t happen.&nbsp; His body knew hers and even as His mouth ravaged hers, His hand snaked down to find her wet and ready for Him.&nbsp; He chuckled into her mouth.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Is that it, Lil&#8217; Slave?� She caught herself before she purred contentedly at His old name for her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I have to go home.� she whispered without conviction, she was caught, she knew it.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�To what, Lil?&nbsp; An empty house that used to be full of light and laughter but is now just a sad reminder of happier times?&nbsp; A job that makes you want to jump out the nearest window?&nbsp; A phone that will one day ring asking you to identify your sister&#8217;s corpse?� He said harshly.&nbsp; He felt her shake in His arms torn between anger and grief.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You&#8217;ve been following me.� she sniffled, trying to pull out of His arms.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes,� He agreed, not letting her go, He crashed another earth-shattering kiss on her lips and she melted again.&nbsp; He drew her to His limo and His driver obligingly opened the door as they fumbled inside.&nbsp; When they came up for air, she was vaguely surprised to be inside His limo, and she wondered when that happened.&nbsp; Her brain flickered back to life as He bent to take her mouth again and she stopped Him.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No, Robert, take me home.&nbsp; You hurt me too badly last time and I don&#8217;t know how I survived.&nbsp; I won&#8217;t if it happens again.� she shook her head and moved away from Him to stare out the window.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It won&#8217;t happen again, Lillian, I learn from my mistakes.� He whispered but she just shook her head.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Not again Robert.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You&#8217;re not listening, Lil&#8217; Slave.� He growled, getting angry.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m not that small.� came her stubborn response.&nbsp; She actually was that small at barely five foot but it was the response she used to give when she knew she was going to be punished.&nbsp; It was probably an automatic response, probably didn&#8217;t even think of the history and He knew that but He needed to regain control and her attention.&nbsp; In a flash her hands were cuffed behind her and her ankles shackled and connected with a hobble chain that was attached to the wrists.&nbsp; She opened her mouth to scream and curse at Him and He forced a gag in and buckled it tight and watched her struggle furiously.&nbsp; And boy was she furious.&nbsp; She wasn&#8217;t His anymore, He&#8217;d lost those rights, He couldn&#8217;t just tie her up and gag her in the back of His limo.&nbsp; She tore at the chains, pulling and tugging until the cuffs rubbed her wrists raw.&nbsp; She gnashed her teeth angrily on the huge ball gag in her mouth and glared death at Him even as He sat back, amused. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Moving with the motion of the vehicle He leaned forward and untied her halter dress letting her breasts fall free.&nbsp; She tried to jerk away, to stop Him, to hit Him but her bonds were sufficient.&nbsp; He then pulled up her short skirt to reveal her shaven quim.&nbsp; He stroked a finger through her slit.&nbsp; She was soaked and she groaned and blushed when she realized it.&nbsp; He brought the finger to His mouth and tasted with relish.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I missed you, Lil&#8217; Slave, soo much.&nbsp; Are you ready to listen now?� he wondered.&nbsp; She stubbornly shook her head and looked away, �Very well, I can wait.�&nbsp; And wait He did, He leaned back in His seat and looked out the window. She struggled for awhile more before sagging in her bonds in defeat.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Are you ready to listen now?� He asked again and she stubbornly shook her head.&nbsp; He sighed and strapped a posture collar around her neck.&nbsp; The limo rocked to a halt and He clipped a leash to her collar.&nbsp; He slipped the hobble chain from around her handcuffs and attached it back to her feet and began to pull her towards the door.&nbsp; She resisted mightily and fruitlessly.&nbsp; She had no leverage with high heels and bound limbs.&nbsp;&nbsp; He pulled her effortlessly out of the car and into the vision of the driver who gave no reaction.&nbsp; He tugged her up the stairs to His house, it was more of a mansion really but He didn&#8217;t like to call it that.&nbsp; Up the stairs, past the doorman and a maid and down into the dungeon she was so familiar with.&nbsp; It hadn&#8217;t changed a bit, and she wondered with a start if He had not had anyone else down here since her.&nbsp; But no, that wasn&#8217;t possible, He was a dom, He wouldn&#8217;t have stayed chaste for her.&nbsp; Not for three years.&nbsp; He lead her over to the Saint Andrew&#8217;s cross and carefully strapped her left leg to it before removing the hobble chain and securing the other.&nbsp; With blinding speed He had her hands loose then strapped tightly to the cross before she had even half a chance to fight.&nbsp; She was pressed tightly to the rough wood and groaned as her breathing rubbed her taunt nipples against the planks.&nbsp; He chuckled at her predicament.&nbsp; He took down a cane from the wall in front of her and she shrieked in protest from behind her gag.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Now don&#8217;t be that way, Lil, you know you deserve and want this as badly as I.&nbsp; You were a brat today and you left without permission all that time ago.� He gently traced her tear streaked cheek with the tip of the cane as he stepped forward, �This is a long time coming, Little Slave.� He whispered kissing her forehead gently before moving behind her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I will stop every five and ask if you are ready to listen.&nbsp; I will stop when you are.� He called and swung.&nbsp; The first five blows were a lark.&nbsp; Barely a sting and her confidence grew.&nbsp; He was taking it easy, it had been three years after all, she could withstand this. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Are you ready to listen?� He asked and she shook her head, �Very well.�&nbsp; This time the blows rained like fire.&nbsp; No sign of sympathy for the time away or thought for her well being each felt as if it broke skin.&nbsp; Making a ladder of angry flesh across her back.&nbsp; She screamed into her gag and pained tears covered the angry ones that had streaked her cheeks.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Are you ready to listen?� He wondered.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Fuck you!� she screamed and although the words that came out were unintelligible He got the message.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Very well.�&nbsp; Another four rained down each harder than the last and finally the fifth split skin across her already welted shoulders.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Are you ready to listen?� He repeated, giving no sign of how out of practice He was.&nbsp; He hadn&#8217;t meant to split skin, she shook her head again and He sighed, �Very well.�&nbsp; He lashed her through three more negations and she seemed to note His newfound hesitancy.&nbsp; He still made each stroke felt but never enough to break skin again.&nbsp; The last no came with an obstinate wiggle of her ass, a place He had hitherto avoided.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Very well.� He growled through clenched teeth.&nbsp; He leashed in His anger and landed a hellish blow to the very center of both ass cheeks.&nbsp; She screamed in newfound agony but He wasn&#8217;t done.&nbsp; Four more times came the cane across her ass and four more welts appeared in a neat striped pattern. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Are you ready to listen?� He begged, He could no longer keep the pain from His voice, He wasn&#8217;t sure He had it in Him to give her another four, already her back was patterned in an ugly shade of abuse and the slash across her shoulder must burn with the salt of her sweat.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t say anything, she didn&#8217;t shake her head, she just hung there in her bonds, shaking and crying.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Give me an answer, Lillian.� He demanded.&nbsp; She nodded and slumped completely boneless in her bonds.&nbsp; He tossed the cane away from Him angrily and came around to face her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m sorry, my love.&nbsp; I know I made a mistake three years ago, I pushed too hard at a bad time.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t realize how much of a rock I was too you and how far you fell when I shifted.&nbsp; When you left I had a good long think and decided that I loved you too much to let that be it, especially with you so wounded and fragile.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t want to chase and scare you off further so I waited until you came back to the scene.&nbsp; You don&#8217;t know how many times I almost threw caution to the wind and reclaimed you.&nbsp; When your mother died, I swore it was time but I didn&#8217;t want to hurt you.&nbsp; I waited for you to be able to come back to the scene.&nbsp; My love, I&#8217;ve been in that club every night for three years, and I never played with anyone.&nbsp; No one has been down here except for the maid, not in three years.&nbsp; There has been no one, nothing but you.�&nbsp; He removed her gag and kissed her gently and she looked up through her pain glazed eyes for so long He wondered if she even registered what He had told her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You&#8217;re not lying.� she said hoarsely, �Three years and no others . . .� she said that more to herself but He nodded.&nbsp; He stroked her hair and cleaned off her face with a damp rag.&nbsp; Finally, she seemed to come to a decision in her own mind and leaned into His gently wiping hand.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Please Master,� she begged and He knew what she wanted but she needed to say it.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Please what, Lil&#8217; Slave?� He wondered.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Please fuck me Master.� she groaned and He smiled.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Gladly.�&nbsp; He tossed away his clothes fervently and moved back behind her, already rock hard.&nbsp; Gently He parted her nether lips and entered her.&nbsp; She screamed in pleasure and pain as He rocked back and forth into her, brushing her tormented back and ass with His chest and loins.&nbsp; He trailed His fingers down her chest and tweaked her nipples playfully before caressing lower to her naked pussy lips.&nbsp; Even as He pounded into her from behind His clever fingers found her clit and began to play.&nbsp; She moaned and He knew she was close, He pushed hard, both His cock and finger plying expertly until a desperate scream signaled her climax and the clenching of her muscles below sucked His own orgasm out of His control.&nbsp; He collapsed against her, catching His breath then jumped back, remembering her horribly abused flesh.&nbsp; She moaned lowly and He untied her bonds.&nbsp; He caught her as her legs collapsed and swung her into His arms as he carried her upstairs.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She woke from her post-coital stupor propped up against His chest in His enormous bathtub.&nbsp; He was kneading her back gently rubbing in some ointment that cooled the burning in her flesh.&nbsp; He had always been the best at aftercare.
