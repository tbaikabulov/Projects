Arena Fights

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The band�s booming drums and
blaring trumpets shook even the groggiest awake; unnecessary because it seemed
the circus-like atmosphere already awoke all. The mastermind behind the day�s
Arena Fights also needed no further help in being aroused. Arousal was
something new and could be dealt with. 

&nbsp;

Slydus
corpulence shifted. His loins stirred uncharacteristically. Last evening such
movement was perfectly explainable as he set about �greeting� his latest
captive. This morning�s movement in his groin did, however, perplex.

&nbsp;

�Somewhat
uneasy, I take great satisfaction in knowing the warrior will soon learn the
awful consequences of her rebellious lack of compliance to my many, many charms.
Perhaps another luscious fig will help
ease my perplexity��

&nbsp;

He plopped one into his mouth, turned
to his simpering nephew beside him and said, �Today, you shall see the true
meaning of courageous strength and beauty.

&nbsp;

�I wonder if my charge fully appreciates the scenes about to unfold�� 

&nbsp;

The young aide twisted his high-lighted
curls and nodded in animated agreement. He hiked the frilly gold hem of his
pastel tunic up above his knees. Despite the early hour, the day already warmed
and he wanted to stay as cool as possible. 

&nbsp;

�His uncle the governor, whatever his vast, really, REALLY vast, shortcomings
did after all hold my fate in hand. I hardly wish to curry disfavor with El Tubo.�

&nbsp;

He scanned the arena. Even at this
hour the five tiers were nearly filled with patricians like his boss seated in
the lowest rings, then civilians, then military, etc., on up to the nose-bleed
section where women sat. �The place was
nearly S.R.O. with anyone and everyone just totally unattractive.�

&nbsp;

The inspiration for the day�s
events, hardly felt beautiful as she emerged from the shadows. Quamria saw stands filled with people, a sort of mesh overhead
for shade. Warming sand between her toes gave some assurance of being actually
�grounded�, while at the same time there was no mistaking where she was, or why
she was were she was� 

&nbsp;

In the center,
clear of the shaded area, stood a man holding a bow and arrow at his side.
Quamria recognized the bearded toughie as another of
her rapists from the night before. Determined to settle that particular score,
she took another step forward. The capture, later tortures and rapes could easily
have dampened a lesser spirit. She could succumb to their barbarous invasions,
yet she wanted to be no victim. Instincts taught her to seek revenge. The
attacks aroused more bitterness than hurt. She strode purposefully, each step masking
more agony. The metal collar chafing her neck reminded her of one more
humiliation. She determined to confront the bearded man with a brave face.

&nbsp;

Last night�s many abuses lingered
in ways not quickly forgotten. By design, the beaten copper plates she wore
over her chest freshened Hell with the slightest of movement. Small holes in
the centers of each disk allowed her nipples through, yet the circumferences of
the holes were unfinished. Nerve endings fired from fleshy nubs scraped raw. 

&nbsp;

The brief skirt made of interlocked
metal rings did not cause further pain, but clearly was designed more as some
sort of light armor and less for any sense of modesty. Beneath its loose weave
her tightly cropped nest of light brown pubic hair showed.

&nbsp;

Slydus
animatedly observed. The blonde stood taller than his soldier. He saw her
surprise as the man handed the bow and arrow over to her, wasn�t surprised in
the least that she immediately knocked the shaft to the bow and aimed it
directly at the swarthy lout�s chest.

&nbsp;

�I would not blame you if you did
shoot me here and now,� he said in voice only she could hear and much too
confident for such an easy target. �But I do caution that you only have one
arrow and might possibly find another use for it.� 

&nbsp;

Quamria
lessened the tension. 

&nbsp;

�He reeked��

&nbsp;

She listened and then curiously watched
as he turned to walk away. His �disarming� manner-certainly not inspired by the
slightest hint of any charm-caused her to lower the bow and arrow. Annoyed noises
from the tiers ringing the arena muttered restless boredom.

&nbsp;

Quamria
pivoted. Behind her bars forming the portcullis clanked. Crowd noise grew. Out
from the shadows stalked a mountain lion. Yellow cat eyes spotted Quamria.. She heard a low growl. The
feline continued to circle in the shadows of the arena, licking its chops.
Already hungry and sensing that a good meal was �there� for the taking, the
mountain lion bounded for the circle of light and Quamria.


&nbsp;

The single tail of her golden hair
blurred as she rearmed the bow and arrow. Timing it just as front claws sprung
out at her, Quamria fired. The shaft flew and sunk into
the lion�s fur. 

&nbsp;

At her feet it lay bleeding and
almost dead. Cheers saluting her called around the compact arena. Quamria dumbly twisted around at the sound of so many
people so close, and then knelt to remove the shaft from the dying animal�s
neck. Before she could pull it out, however, more cheers sounded. 

&nbsp;

Arena Fights

Part
Two

&nbsp;

Quamria
stood just in time to see a chariot heading straight at her at full speed. More alarming than the chariot and its driver were ankle-high
blades flashing from behind each wheel. She timed her jump just as the
blades met where she stood, but felt her hair yanked to their roots. She ran
and saw that the driver was a nude Nubian female tightly clenching her hair.
Snapped along, she ran after the chariot.

&nbsp;

Quamria
stumbled and fell to her knees, her hair freed. The chariot stopped just as
suddenly. Its driver stomped back to where Quamria
knelt panting. Quamria glanced up to see the Nubian�s
skin shown of oil. Scars between naked thighs showed evidence of female
castration. The blonde started to rise. A kick along her spine shoved her back
down. Slydus popped another luscious date into his
mouth as he watched the scene unfold. Another Nubian female holding a trident
kicked the warrioress� back again. This woman waved
to the chariot driver and reversed the trident. She bent down and lifted up the
metallic hem of the rebel�s skirt. Slydus spat out
his half-eaten fig and watched with more intensity as the blonde�s ass was
revealed, shining in the morning sun. Taking the handle of the trident, she
plunged it into the warrioress� open �sweet spot�.

&nbsp;

�To
think that he was �there� just last night.� Slydus
salivated, rolling the fig between his teeth as he savored this latest act
unfolding before him. �Again my loins
stirred for possibly the fourth-no, the fifth time in such a short span! Oh he
could just not keep track�

&nbsp;

How
virile! What a man!�

&nbsp;

�By
the gods,� the nephew, cum, assistant thought. �Flabby �Mr. Boss-man� was actually pleasuring himself. The perve! The pig was sweating buckets, his hand jerking off under
his royal purple robes.� Not
wishing to get any closer to his uncle he pretended not to notice the action to
his immediate left. He concentrated instead on the cool shade under which they
sat; a dull alternative, but at least not hot�.

&nbsp;

Using the trident handle as a thick
prod, the taller of the two Nubians forcibly guided their impaled target back
to where the stilled animal lay. The two�s cruel ingenuity won the noisy
approval of the formerly stunned spectators. The threesome on the arena floor
slowly advanced toward the fallen carcass, the stuck rebel leaving a
pain-wracked sandy wake as she crawled on her hands and knees.

&nbsp;

The one wielding the trident bent
down and lifted up a front paw of the now dead lion. With it, she used the
claws to rake the blonde�s back. Bright blood erupted. The cord tightly binding
the plates snapped. The two discs plopped into the sand.

&nbsp;

The shorter of the two Nubian�s
grabbed Quamria�s left-arm and placed it between the
lion�s jaws. She raised her foot high, poised to force it down towards the arm
in the jaw. Quamria�s right-palm caught her heel by
surprise. With effort she threw her attacker off-balance and backward. The warrioress pulled her arm free and twisted. Rolling, the
handle still deep inside, she used both feet to kick up. The Nubian saw the
flash of feet. Shock widened the whites of her eyes. Quamria
kicked the trident�s points into her oiled neck. She jerked the handle free and
rolled back to face the other woman. 

&nbsp;

The warrioress
got to her feet and charged. Her lowered head grazed the other�s well-oiled
stomach. Her hair again got pulled. She pulled back. Legs kicked up more arena
sand as the two fought. Quamria grabbed both oiled
shoulders. Her�s were grabbed as well. Muscles
flexed. The blonde had a height advantage but the other�s strength compensated
for her shorter stature.

&nbsp;

�Are you sure there�s nothing I can
get you from the concessions?� The sycophant looked aghast at his relative and
superior. �He should really get a room! Really!� Unsavory gurgling noises came from Slydus,
his sole attention seemed to be on the girl fight happening in the arena. �Maybe, just maybe, he�ll settle down after
getting his rocks off this time.�

&nbsp;

Quamria
got her foot up into the other�s belly and did a backward somersault, pulling
the two of them close to the fallen lion. They landed hard, but Quamria sensed her opponent�s strength flagging. She
grabbed the black woman�s head and shoved it where her left-arm had been. She
slammed her forearm down on the carcass�s snout. The Nubian screamed shrilly as
lion canines cut. Quamria spun away just as the other
got to her feet. Holding the sides of her face, blood streaming between her
fingers, she ran back sobbing into the shadows.

&nbsp;

Quamria
rose slowly to her feet. Inventory time. All of her
ached. She had no concerns about being half-naked, in fact, freed of the
cumbersome discs tied with their binding cord, her breasts presented more
normally; gentle slopes and curves stood out from her chest. But her nipples
burned from the jagged plate openings, and various bites and bruises marking
her breasts hurt. She looked down her stomach. Blood trickled along the insides
of her thighs.

Arena Fights

Part
Three

&nbsp;

Mid-morning sun illuminated the
arena surface. The stands remained shaded, but heat on the floor rose. A male
slave labored under a yoke heavy with two sloshing water buckets swinging from
either end. Close to where Quamria stood, he set down the load and offered the
liquid contents of one bucket to Quamria. She poured the refreshing water over
her head and sipped some of its coolness. A guard stepped near the two and
said, �Hands on your knees, rebel. We will wash what�s left of the other bucket
over your back.� Quamria did as told, catching ever deeper breaths. Very close
to her feet lay the yoke. 

&nbsp;

�Please be gentle. As you can see,
my back has injuries.� 

&nbsp;

As expected, the guard moved closer
to see where the lion�s claws where used to break skin. Diving forward, Quamria
picked up the yoke. Now freed of the buckets she slung the wood behind her
neck. The male slave dodged her swing, but the guard did not. The wood caught
his temple. Another soldier came running. He too was struck as Quamria planted
her feet and pivoted. 

&nbsp;

Every man and woman in the arena,
regardless of their status yelled. Slydus, too out of shape to instantly react
by standing, choked on a half-swallowed pear where he lay on his couch.
Anxiously, he gulped down a full chalice of wine. He grabbed himself. All were
amazed at the lone female�s prowess in fighting. Slydus added his voice to the
cheering.

&nbsp;

From her periphery, Quamria saw
another soldier-this one almost on top of her. She dropped the wood off her
shoulders and hit with an end squarely in his crotch. The man fell with the
others sprawled across the sand.

&nbsp;

�Enough!� The shout came from the
thin circle of shadow surrounding the arena. Quamria held the yoke and looked
in the direction of the shout. Into the sunlight appeared an officer. He was
flanked by other soldiers with swords drawn and archers with arrows all aimed
at her�

&nbsp;

The officer was not one she remembered
from the night before. Nearly what one might otherwise call �handsome� in some
different situation, now he was just one more menace.
She sat on the small wood square of a mean device that was not just a vertical
rack, but a horizontal one, too. Clearly, it was designed to stretch and pull
every axis. Another menace� 

&nbsp;

Her back faced where she knew
Slydus sat. Almost touching each shoulder were two uprights that reached high
into the stifling air. Long chains from near the top held
cuffs. Next to her hips lay more chain and opened shackles. From the
looks of the encrusted insides they had already been used� 

&nbsp;

�Put these on the rebel!� Quamria
winced. The wrist bands further chafed already bruised skin. Her legs were
raised up and ankles locked into the dangling cuffs. �Widen it!� Clogs
clattered and rumbled under Quamria�s tiny seat. The uprights began to move
away. Behind her, the one cranking the contraption grunted. Her feet and arms
tugged. Arms soon extended out, level with shoulders. Legs soared then spread
as they lifted. Blood rushed to Quamria�s head as most of her body inverted. 

&nbsp;

Only the back of her neck rested
where she sat, a right angle to most of her. She twisted her head from side to
side, but could no longer see the arena wall. The roaring noise could have been
from the crowd, or from her own body. Frantically she used her only option; to
look up. The burning sun now high above glared impossibly bright, but Quamria
involuntarily peeked. Sweat cascaded down. Breasts nested her cheeks. The metal
ring skirt simmered, draped upside down over her tummy. Chains stopped climbing
halfway up the timbers, spreading her legs into a wide �V�. Splayed as she was,
there was little to do but submit.

&nbsp;

Three chained female prisoners
walked past. Quamria anxiously sought their help, but in vain. None gave her a
glance. Their attentions seemed to be on where she remembered Slydus to be. She
thought she heard him begin to address the three newcomers�

&nbsp;

�What
could he be thinking?!� The young chief of staff shifted away in his chair
next to the governor and fanned himself. �Well
obviously, the girl fight thing and now torturing the rebel so that everyone
could see what the girl had for lunch were big hits with this bunch, but did
the greasy� oinker really have to stand
on his own couch and make such �a
complete fool of himself? The aide worried over just how he�d have to
explain such crudeness. 

&nbsp;

��Guilt by association� and all that crap. Pals, especially in that bath group-nice as
they were-could be such a bitchy bunch �Such a spin he�d have to concoct!�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Arena Fights

Part
Four

&nbsp;

�You each will have two turns, �the
high-pitched voice said, �With the weapons you are given. Do well� and freedom
is yours.� 

&nbsp;

�So that�s why the three ignored her! Figures. Slydus and his motive opportunities.�

&nbsp;

�You look thirsty.� Quamria
blinked, from her perspective a huge shape towering above. �See if this helps.�
She gulped the cool water, but struggled to swallow. She choked. Most of it ran
out of the sides of her mouth, some out her nostrils. �Not too easy drinking
from your position, is it?� She recognized the officer�s voice.

&nbsp;

�You,� Slydus said to the first of
the three, �get this branch; you this whip and you get to operate the rack. I
suggest you with the rack begin first.�

&nbsp;

�Here, let us get you started.�
Quamria braced for more. Added rumbling tugged at her arms. Her legs further
rose and parted. Tendons stretched and sockets threatened to pop. Her head hung
completely upside down, only her hair brushing the small wood seat. 

&nbsp;

She saw more of the three women.
From the floor of the arena they looked like giants coming right at her. Behind
them, she could barely make out the high wall of the arena where she knew
Slydus was. Forces pulled more and more apart. The three came closer.

&nbsp;

�Looks like you won�t need this
anymore,� said the officer. She felt fingers around her waist remove the hot
metal skirt. �I think we can also loosen your hair.� The small cord holding her
hair together was snipped.

&nbsp;

The filthy, ragged hem of one of
the women brushed her face as she reached for one of the two cranks. Quamria
tried to prepare for what was to come, but had no idea. She heard the woman
strain. The rack began to pull her again: Wider and higher she split.

&nbsp;

Slydus elbowed his nephew whose
focus seemed to be drifting. Below, long legs split. Gaping genitalia glistened, a pink cavern folding around a dark pit, one many
in the arena knew led to pleasure. 

&nbsp;

�I want to share with his nephew his last night�s adventure in that particular region, and at least have him
watch the sight before him, but
wasn�t entirely sure how much the boy really cared. Regardless, today�s sight
in his opinion did inspire.� The warrioress�s ribcage expanded as her
stomach sunk. Every curve and definition dripped with one thing or another. �No doubt her sweet ass must be clenched
tightly behind her, too. So much for the kid. He was
missing quite a show��

&nbsp;

Quamria fought to breathe. Quartered so was unbearable. Panic shook her head. She felt
her hair brushing across the wood below her. Open eyes saw dirty bare legs and
tattered dress of one of the women. Behind, sand stretched to the base of the
arena wall.

&nbsp;

Another of them hefted the sturdy
branch. �She might use both hands to
swing it. She appraised the hanging blonde. Freedom would be so nice but she�d need to get through this strong one first.� She peered at the upside-down ribs.
�They looked like a good place to start. She had never broken any,
but these she might at least hurt. That ought to make a good impression to help
her own her way out the �door�.�

&nbsp;

�She gripped a gnarled end of the wood and set
her feet to swing along the front flank. �She
almost felt sorry for the girl, but then again, it was her freedom��

&nbsp;

Bones absorbed most of the impact
from the harsh blow; the rack�s tension did not allow any movement. Quamria
cried out. Immediately, her already struggling breath was drastically
shortened. Any inhaling proved nearly impossible. Daggers plunged into her
lungs and twisted�Her cries were cut short. Her sunken belly made rapid shallow
beats. 

&nbsp;

The sick smacking sound forced the
nephew look back down into the arena. �Oh my�. A quick glance at his fatuous uncle confirmed the
worst. All around people were going crazy with chant after chant. 

&nbsp;

Down in the arena the one holding
the branch stood back. The suspended nude tried to contort her body, but the
rack pulled her so tightly she could hardly move. With morbid fascination he
joined the others and watched as the woman with the whip in her hand stood
behind the blonde and took aim at the center of the parted legs. 

&nbsp;

Quamria�s insides exploded. Raw
terror overcame all, including the recently injured ribs. The single-tailed
whip gouged deeply and fiercely into the inverted blonde�s sex.

&nbsp;

Slydus grabbed for all of the fruit
and wine in reach. Beside himself with questionable ecstasy, he felt another
ejaculation-this time with no hands! He sat back down into the plush divan and
stole his nephews fan. He immediately fanned his face, seeking coolness in any
way possible.

&nbsp;

�Very good for
all three of you. You are halfway free. Now you know what next you need
to do.� The women below nodded in understanding. His job done, Slydus further
relaxed to enjoy more of the show.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Arena Fights

Part
Five

&nbsp;

Brackish water splashed her face,
somewhat reviving. Another dousing poured down her flexed torso, through the
wide valley of her upside-down bosom and over her elongated neck. Quamria
sucked what ran over her mouth. In addition to the already foul odor, the water
had the coppery taste given by blood.

&nbsp;

The rack moved again, the uprights
moving farther from her shoulders. She lifted more, groaning loudly as she did.
Bits of air came in short stabs. Another blow smashed into her back ribs.
Quamria cried out. The lash ripped into parted genitalia.

&nbsp;

Her screams, higher pitched due to
the severity of her bruised ribs and added trauma endured, lasted well after
the crowd�s roar lowered. Eventually, Quamria�s wailing turned to muted moans.
Slydus stood. Below him stood the three women shoulder-to-shoulder. 

&nbsp;

�A classic �Thumbs Up�, he said to
the hopeful three, �Or, �Thumbs Down� from not just me, �he gestured around the
arena, �but from all here. I will, however, say my opinion is well in favor of
the jobs you three have done. Admirable.�

&nbsp;

His nephew wanted to shrink from
site. �Surely he must be seen by someone
here. He nervously fingered his locks. What
a brute his uncle is! How he would ever live THIS one down escaped him.�

&nbsp;

�So I give the three a hearty
Thumbs Up!� The majority in the tiers echoed the governor�s sign. Smiles widen
on all three women especially when their wrist shackles were removed. The
threesome bowed their combined gratitude and turned toward the exit.

The arena crowd still was noisy,
but more subdued. �Dare he?Dare he? Why
not? It was his show and he could call the �shots�. Privilege did have its,
uhm, Pleasures.�

&nbsp;

Slydus surreptitiously nodded to
the awaiting archers. The first of the �freed� prisoners added an arrow shaft
to her forehead. Mortally wounded, she crashed. Horrified, the other two fled
to the far arena wall. The archers followed. One caught an arrow in the back.
Her hands reached around to try and pull it free. Blood gushed from the wound.
She also fell. The third and surviving member, the one whose task it was to
operate the vertical rack, made it to the high wall until stopped by another
arrow. Momentum carried her forward and her body smeared the wall as it fell.
She lay in a heap where sand met stone.

&nbsp;

�Can
he possibly top himself?� The young assistant shared shock with those
around. �And here he was, actually
related to this savage!� He looked with pity at the arena women; arrows in
three of them, one still alive and impossibly stretched on the vertical rack. �All this carnage because of his OWN uncle!�

&nbsp;

�Take her down. First splash more
water on the rebel. Perhaps that will bring her to her senses.� Slydus
triumphantly retook his seat. �Her final lesson in What Not To Do is almost at
hand��

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Once righted, Quamaria staggered
and nearly toppled. Legs once noticed for their abundant qualities wobbled. Fortunately,
there was not far to go. Knees divoted the loosely-packed sand. The officer
forced thighs together making sure she faced Slydus. Exposed less to the sun, contrasting
marks on her breasts shown vividly. Cuffs and shackles remained, as did the
collar.

&nbsp;

�Do you have anything to say before
your days as a rebel slave come to an end?�

&nbsp;

Quamaria saw the fallen corpses of
the three who thought they tortured for their own freedom. �How can you be so
cruel to your own people?� she squeaked, each tiny breath an ordeal compounded
by raising her voice to be heard.

&nbsp;

Slydus regarded the warrioress
kneeling now before him and laughingly said, �Them?� He pointed to the slain three.
�THESE are my people!� Great cheers from the arena horde grateful for such
demonstrated magnanimity and relief that they were not the ones down on the
arena floor rose in kind.

&nbsp;

�I have nothing further to add.�
Quamaria bowed her head. Water could do only so much to fight off exhaustion
and ease agony.

&nbsp;

�Then you will kindly show us
another example of your celebrated strength. Remain kneeling as you are,�
Slydus said as two male slaves took the warrioress� hands and placed them in
the sand. �Support your upper body with those long arms�But wait. What am I thinking?�

&nbsp;

The sycophant wanted to shrink into
the chair. His uncle obviously had not had enough fill of this female. �What would the monster do next?�

&nbsp;

�Let�s make this a little more
interesting.� 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

To Be Continued�

Arena Fights

Conclusion

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The officer took his cue. Holding
two broadswords of the same length, he knelt in front of Quamaria
scarlet face. He could see from the sweat and pain in her eyes that she was
suffering and struggling to keep her body arched up from her waist. Aligning
the sharp blade of one sword under the warrioress he
sunk a pommel from the hilt into the sand. He did likewise with the other. Both
swords stabilized underneath, their sharp edges parallel.

&nbsp;

Beads of sweat rained over the
metal. Those watching from the sides could see her nipples hovering just above
the blades. Quamria�s face flushed with more
exertion. Shoulders cramped, veins along forearms knotted. 

&nbsp;

She fought against the slow
descent. Bare arms shook. All around mad shouts called for her surrender. Taxed
from too much on the rack, her strength fled. Shoulders and arms weakened�

&nbsp;

�Why
no cuts remained a mystery. Her breasts must have folded over the blades. I
certainly can feel them.� She rested her chin on the sand. �Her heart felt ready to explode, the rest
lay slump, burning on the hot bed.�

&nbsp;

�Lift up the rebel. Show us what
has happened,� Slydus said, shouting above the crowd
to make himself heard in the arena. He laughed with the rest as Quamria�s arms were grasped and her torso lifted. Red lines
glowed up and down her chest. One of the lines perfectly bisected a nipple; the another ran along the outside edge of the other brown
aureole. �It appears as though a slight adjustment is in order�� Slydus said as he sat. He signaled the officer to move the
errant sword and nodded for the gate to be opened. �Too bad, warrioress. Looks as though you�ll
have to use your hands to support yourself up again.�

&nbsp;

�I
can�t lay upon the swords another time and yet��Loose hair hid the sides of
her face, but also trapped waves of heat. Dazedly, she saw two slaves
approaching. �They seemed to pull
something attached to rope.� 

&nbsp;

The sycophant nephew was totally blown away by the arena
spectacle. Two male slaves were dragging behind them a rusty iron ingot-the kind
used for ballast in ships� hulls. The heavy bar left a wide and deep wake in
the sand. The rebel saw them too. Her arms trembled. Her sweating torso
lowered, the upturned blades testing each nipple. Another collapse seemed at
hand.

&nbsp;

Quamria�s
eyes cringed as the male slaves reached her. The object they so laboriously
towed heavily rose by rope attached and went behind her, its dark shape
blocking the sun for an instant. Breath came in quick, short spurts. She felt
light-headed.

&nbsp;

The two slaves struggled to lift up
the ingot. Once it was over the warrioress� shoulder
blades, they let go. The tall blonde at their feet cried out, pounding her
fists and toes once. One of the men bent down to inspect the stilled rebel.
From under the iron and her smashed tit grew an oily pond. The other side must
be the same.

&nbsp;

�I�ll take it from here,� said the
officer to the two slaves. Waving them away, he gripped the sword handles. He
pulled up and out. The swords dripped fresh blood. �But don�t go too far. Get
this slab off of her first.� He turned to face Slydus
and held the dripping swords aloft.

&nbsp;

The nephew wanted to vomit. His
uncle, however, seemed to be enjoying himself more than ever. �At least, he wasn�t playing with himself�The
poor bitch down there was barely moving.� He watched as they turned her
over. �No wonder she seemed in shock.
Both tits were cleaved, covered in gore, sand and who knows what.�

&nbsp;

Slydus
shook his heavy jowls. Those �awful consequences� now were learned, even to one
of such courage, strength and beauty. �Wash her off so that we may all see!� �No longer would she awaken his dormant lust, or anyone else�s, for that matter�.

&nbsp;

The rebel female lay on her back.
Cleared sand revealed split tits. The officer picked up the trident from the
floor, held the barbed points over her abdominal tunnel, and pushed.
Blood-stained hands reflexively gripped the shaft, but slipped free. The
officer yanked the trident out much as a fisherman would a gaff from a landed
fish.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Few remained in the arena stands to
watch the warrioress bleed out. Little could be heard
in and around the arena in contrast to earlier frenzy. Most departed, including
the portly Slydus and his nephew. 

&nbsp;

�I still don�t have the foggiest notion if the lad prefers the pleasures
of �snails� or �oysters���

&nbsp;

Conflicted by many thoughts from a
most confusing day, the nephew�s signature flounce appeared sluggish. He
lackadaisically shuffled behind his rotund uncle. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

(Short)
Epilogue

&nbsp;

Below, one of the male slaves
warily collected the shackles and collar from the dying female. Unlike her,
they could possibly be used another day.
