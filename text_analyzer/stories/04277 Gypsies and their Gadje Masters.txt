The Gypsies and their Gadje Masters

Story:



The Beginning:



It was a Gypsy Community,&nbsp; somewhere in Canada.&nbsp; The Canadian Government took in many gypsies from Europe,&nbsp; back in the late 1990s.&nbsp; Many of these gypsies were living in Vancouver�s outskirts.&nbsp; But like how they lived in Europe,&nbsp; they lived the same way in Canada:&nbsp; caravans and tents.



The Gypsies still scared&nbsp; a lot of people, especially the fact that Canadians are well read in news and media reports about them.&nbsp; From time to time,&nbsp; some skinheads would attack them and harass them, but the Canadian authorities always cracked down on them, really hard.&nbsp; 



When this all went to court, the three skinheads were sentenced to jail and after the judge hits his table with his Hammer of Justice,&nbsp; the last skinhead said loudly for everyone to hear, �You are sentencing fellow Canadians.&nbsp; Soon, these gypsies will own all your property.�



After many days passed,&nbsp; the gypsies were dancing and singing at night.&nbsp; Not far from where they were, was actually the suburbs and many people who have passed by the Gypsy Area, wished that it was those bloody skinheads who won the court case trial.



That was until� many Gypsy women fell sick.&nbsp; Many Gypsy men had fallen sick too. No one was really worried until a child died, about the age of four.&nbsp; The mother went ballistic.&nbsp; The whole Gypsy Community cried for them. It was so terrible that the Gypsy Elder sought wisdom from an even older Gypsy. She was older than their leader Gipser. When he entered her tent, she was sat by her crystal ball and said, �I have seen what this is all about. Because we moved here to Canada and were welcomed by the Gadje (non gypsy) rulers of this land and had not shown thanks, Indra and the Gods have cursed us.�



Gipser was frantic.&nbsp; He sacredly said, �What should I do, wise one???� The old lady looked up at him and said, �You must go to the city,&nbsp; where the gadjes live.&nbsp; There, you must seek a gadje and you must ask him if he wants to rule over us�.



Gipser�s dark gypsy eyes shot open, �What?&nbsp; You can�t be serious�. The old woman then hissed at him, �Do not mock the Gods. Unless you want this epidemic to continue�. She broke out into an evil laughter.&nbsp; 



The Suburbs



It was a corner shop, ran by an Indian guy and his wife.&nbsp; Derek always went there and bought his Slurpies.&nbsp; The Indian Guy would speak in his accent, �Please come again�. Derek took the drink from the man, after paying him, �I shall come again�. He looked at the man�s wife for an instance, before walking off.



Once outside the corner shop, he met his two other friends Sam and John. Sam mimicked the Indian guy from the shop, pretending to have that accent, �Please come again�. John then said in an Indian accent, �But I want to cum at his wife�. They were all from high school and were upset about how foreigners were taking over Canada, from white Canadians.



Derek drank his slurpy and John joked with him, �This is why our fellow Canadians are losing jobs, because you buy from those Ragheads�. Derek finished his drink, �I suppose so. But hey man, what do I care. I still got a job. You guys working too, right?�



Sam nodded but John said, �I got fired last week and they gave my job to some Chinese Gook girl�. These boys often used such language, though they didn�t mean in that extreme sense like how skinheads used it.



While the three boys were standing there, by the car park, and joking around, Gipser approached them. At first, all three boys were shocked that he did. They knew that Gypsies were camping not far away from where they lived. Gipser was speaking to them in a rough way, �I say you don�t go. You hear me out�.&nbsp; Sam then went defensive, as he had to put with always being labeled as �the racist one�, although he was not as bad as the others. Sam said to him, �Hey now you listen here�.



Gipser was intimidated by Sam fighting back. Gipser put his hands out, ready to defend himself. John looked at Gipser and said in an angry way, �What you want old man? You want our money, is that it, huh?� Derek finished his slurpy and threw it in the ground, saying, �Thank God we�re all Americans now�.



Gisper knew some broken English, �I no enemy. I need help.� John then softly said, �You want our help�. Gipser was trying to move and had his hand in an assuring way, �Follow me. I take you. Come come. I no harm you. Gypsy word. No harm�.



The three boys were reluctant at first but then decided what is the worse. If they tried to screw them over, they could take on these gypsies and hence, confirm their bad experiences to other Canadians, who would then vote them out of the next election ie no more Gypsies in Canada.



But if they helped these geezer out, they were thinking about rewards, like some nice gypsy pussy to play with or maybe even the old man�s daughter. They were thinking of someone pretty but thought, maybe all their women look shit.



Derek then looked at Gipser, �Ok gypsy, we follow you�. Gipser nodded his head, �Thank you Gadje, thank you�.



Gypsy Camp



The three boys were on their bicycles and had them tied up to a tree, not sure if they could trust Gipser.&nbsp; 



They could see caravans, wagons and tents everywhere. It was like the Mongol Horde camping, here in Canada, Vancouver.&nbsp; As Gipser couldn�t speak good English, he had his oldest grandson, about the same age as the three boys�s DADS.&nbsp; 



The grandson was a man in his 30s and his name was Vlek.&nbsp; He had curly black hair and black eyes to go with it.&nbsp; He fitted the stereotype of the romantic gypsy that some women have fantasies about.



Derek talked to his two friends, �If he asks me for a sexual orgy, I say we�re outta here�. Vlek smiled at the three of them, �Hi. Can I offer you boys drinks.� John, Derek and Sam were looking at each other.&nbsp; John then aggressively said, �What kind of drinks.� Vlek laughed, knowing what these boys were thinking, �I am getting you guys hot tea. Good for you. Gypsy tea.�



The three boys were inside Vlek�s wagon home and they were all sat by his table (from donation). They hated the tea and Sam said, �I can�t take this stuff�. Sam put the drink away, as did the other two boys. Vlek, his wife and his two daughters (Gipser�s great grand daughters) started laughing and they were saying something in their Romani language.



Vlek laughed at the three boys, �You guys ain�t that tough. You talk tough but you just nothing. Bet you still live with your mommas�. Derek got up and so did his two other friends, �Let�s get outta here.&nbsp; Our host invited us here to be their joke�. Vlek and his family then looked worried. Vlek said to them, �Please don�t go. I didn�t mean you no harm�.



Sam shouted back, in a very American-style emotional voice, �Well you hurt our Canadian feelings, after having stolen our jobs so screw you, you Gypsy Asshole�.



Vlek was about to get defensive but realized that, this was his fault. Boys will be boys and no one in Gadje society likes being laughed at. Vlek said, �Please don�t go.&nbsp; I will tell you why we need you�.



Vlek explained about the Curse of the Vedic Gods. Sam, John and Derek were interested. They liked what they were hearing. Vlek then said, �We have to follow you and do what you wish, for at least tonight�.



Later�



All the Gypsy families were standing out.&nbsp; The young children were given to the old woman to take care and so she could tell them a story, so they don�t know what is about to happen.



The Gypsy men, fathers and uncles and brothers and sons stood on one corner while their women, both the ugly ones and pretty ones, mothers and aunties and nieces and daughters were stood on one corner. They wore skirts and large earrings and many had black curly hair. Their dark eyes looked back at the three white boys,&nbsp; their Gadje Masters.



Vlek was stood away from the rest, being their translator. Even Gipser, with all his Gypsy pride, was made to stand with the other men.



Derek then looked at the men and Vlek had to be prepared to translate it to them but this was how it went.



Derek announced to the men, �You are all to take off your clothes.&nbsp; And after you do that, I want you to beat each other�s legs with sticks and hit as hard as you can.&nbsp; Got that�.



Vlek heard what Derek said and he wanted to plead but John told him, �Do as he says or we are gone. You have to carry out demands and wishes that we want to see happen. We don�t care about your fucking comforts. The Canadian government can give you that.&nbsp; But we have to work our assess off so we want to have our Night.�



Vlek�s head went down in defeat and he translated to the Gypsy men and at first, the gypsy men looked at the boys defiantly but knew that, tonight, they belonged to the Gadjes.&nbsp; Derek then said, �Don�t forget you gypsies, when you carry out our orders, you must loudly say Masters. Got that�.



�YES MASTERS� the Gypsy men said (even those of romantic stereotypes) as they undressed until they were completely naked in this freezing weather.&nbsp; Once naked,&nbsp; they moved slower and so Derek screamed at them, �I said you hit yourselves with sticks. �



The gypsies did not want to carry out more orders. This boy has humiliated them, far worse than the Nazis could have had. Vlek pleaded, �You made us stand naked. Isn�t that enough�.



John and Sam shouted at Vlek, �No, Gypsy. It is not enough. We want to see more.�

The Gypsy men and boys may have cried but they carried out these demands. They walked to where the sticks were piled up and started hitting at each others� legs. 



Derek commands and Vlek translates (with defeat in his Gypsy Voice), �Faster. Faster.�

Vlek had tears in his eyes when he sees Gipser and his father, who had a reputation for seducing gadje women and running away with their money,&nbsp; hitting each others� legs.&nbsp; Blood trickled and it hurt like hell. They screamed at lashes from each other.



After a while, the men stopped. They were tired and way too hurt to hurt each other anymore. Their women folk cried. This was too much to bear.&nbsp; Vlek himself was glad that he was spared such an ordeal, only because he spoke English.





John then looked at the women, �Now your turn�. Vlek gulped but knew that his protests would do no good. He saw his own wife and daughters.&nbsp; He went up to Derek and said, �Please spare my wife and daughters.&nbsp; You can do what you want with the rest.&nbsp; But pease..�&nbsp; Sam shouted to Vlek, �Shut yer mouth. You all belong to us and disobedience to your Canadian masters is serious.�



John gives the orders and Vlek translates it to the women.&nbsp; The women started dancing sexily like how they normally do their gypsy dancing, with their large earrings clustering in the air.&nbsp; But this time, there were going to be changes.&nbsp; While they were dancing, they had to start stripping.



They took off their Gypsy women clothes and did it, like how strippers. John then laughed at Vlek, whose tears flowed down his eyes (he was taller and more muscular than these boys but was powerless to challenge them) �I always knew that Gypsies were the first strippers. A&nbsp; $1 a night. A $1 a night�.



Sam and Derek had an evil idea.&nbsp; They told Vlek was what was going to happen.&nbsp; Vlek shook his head, �You are too much, no. no.� Sam and Derek threatened to walk off. Vlek went to his knees and begged them, �No no. don�t do this. Would you like it if your own people were asked to do this�.



Sam punched Vlek, knowing that the taller man could not strike him back. �Don�t you ever call us your people. Even your own gods made your our servants. To you, we are Masters. Got that, Gyp�. Vlek cried and nodded, �Yes master. Yes master. I am just a stupid gypsy. You have it all figured out�.



The uglier women were forced to shove Sticks up their pussies and no matter how much it hurt, Derek and Sam used the Horse Brander on their bodies, marking them out as animal properties and they easily did it to the men, who were powerless to fight back at all.



As for Vlek�s wife, his two daughters (same age as the three boys) and the less ugly and slightly more attractive women of this community, they were to go to the city for the night.



Vancouver�s Main City



It was a quite night in Canada.&nbsp; The police were not doing their jobs properly and were probably in some whore houses.



But these streets were full of rowdy men,&nbsp; who had just come out of their pubs.&nbsp; They were drunk and were ready to fuck whores.



Tonight was their lucky night.&nbsp; The moment, they left the pubs,&nbsp; they were approached by some Gypsy women.&nbsp; Some of these men were rednecks but a pussy was a pussy.&nbsp; 



The Gypsy women were flirting but in a Gypsy way. One of the rednecks said to her, �How much?&nbsp; You want us to pay for your services.� He chuckled his joke with his fellow rednecks.&nbsp; �$1 a night, sir�, the Gypsy woman said, with her below.



�A $1 a night.�, screamed the excited Redneck.&nbsp; Many of these gyspy women offered themselves to the very people they hated. The rednecks would just FUCK their asses and cunts on top of their own cars or inside it.



Many Gypsy women were going to suffer tonight.&nbsp; Some of these men were even sucking and biting at their nipples, till blood trickled out.&nbsp; After the women would run away crying, which they normally do after getting paid their buck, the rednecks would just laugh back, �We always knew you were a buncha whores�.



A Gypsy woman had at least 5 guys to 10 guys each and they could make $10. But all their hard earned money went to the pockets of the 3 white boys or white masters.



As for Vlek�s two daughters, they didn�t have to WHORE themselves. The three boys took turns fucking them, inside their tree house.&nbsp; While the eldest daughter had both John and Sam sucking hard on her nipples and aggressively shoving candle sticks up her cunt,&nbsp; Derek had the other daughter all tied up.&nbsp; He put clippers on her nipples and put bird seeds on her pubic hair and so when he let his pet Parrot out for feeding time, it pecked right down on her black pubic hair. It pecked and pecked. The younger daughter cried and screamed.





But after the night was over,&nbsp; all the Gypsies were allowed to return home. The boys made some money but the gypsies had their egos and bodies HURT.
