The Present

&nbsp;

Written by Hawk_Fann and Sbbe

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Beth screamed into the hand
covering her mouth. She struggled but to know avail. He pulled her against his
body and shifted into the van behind them. The door slammed and it jerked to a start. �It�s me Bethany,� the sexy British voice said
in her ear. �You know you wanted this,� he said leaning in pressing his mouth
just behind her ear. His hand slipped away from her mouth just a hair. 

&nbsp;

�Master?� she asked fear in her
voice but her body relaxed just a little. 

&nbsp;

�Yes it�s me Beth, your master.�

&nbsp;

�But��

&nbsp;

�No, no buts only yes sirs.� He
growled as he pulled her in closer. �You are my slut, mine.� 

&nbsp;

�Yes sir. Please sir. You�re
scaring me. I told you we couldn�t meet?�

&nbsp;

The hand slammed over her mouth,
his mouth dropped to her shoulder and he bit till she screamed loudly into his
palm.

&nbsp;

�What did you say slut?� he
growled.

&nbsp;

�Yes sir. Yes sir,� she begged, �please sir.�

&nbsp;

�Obey me Beth, don�t ever fight
me.� The menace in his voice was clear and firm.

&nbsp;

She fell into the relationship they
shared on line. Her eyes dropped and her body relaxed, �Yes sir.� She panted,
he slipped a hand between her legs and stroked, she moaned. 

&nbsp;

He�d been her online master for
months now, working on her mind, molding it, making her his slave. She�d fought
the title, only taking the title of submissive, she�d resisted their meeting
but he�d persisted till he knew her, knew her name, knew where she lived. He
knew her desires, her fantasies, he knew better than she did what she wanted. 

&nbsp;

�Master,� she moaned as he rolled
her onto her back on the thinly carpeted van floor. He pressed between her legs
lifting her hands above her head into one of his hands. �Master,� her eyes met
his begging, �I�m afraid.�

&nbsp;

�Does master know what is best for
you slut?� He rocked against her as if having sex stimulating her, helping the
pleasure to over come her fear.

&nbsp;

�Yes sir. Oh sir,� she moaned.

&nbsp;

He knew her so well. The pleasure
she craved overrode her common sense. It did it to her every time. She was
moaning loudly as he freed her from her clothing piece by piece. He rolled off
her then back, stroking, pulling, manipulating her
body. �Master knows what you need, slut.� She let him cuff her wrists, she lifted her knees up so he could cuff her ankles
without moving. She writhed as he licked a nipple then sucked it in deeply. The
cuffs were both attached so to open her legs she had to draw her heals up. He
slipped a finger in her pussy fucking her gently. She begged trying to unzip
the soft jacket he wore. He�d chosen it for the dark color and hood. He had
needed the anonymity it gave him as he took her. 

&nbsp;

�You will do as Master says,� he
told her. �You will obey me.� 

&nbsp;

�Yes sir,� she panted, her head
thrashing back and forth. She knew she couldn�t ask, it wasn�t allowed, and she
dare not cum no matter what he did. �Master?� escaped her lips. He smiled and
pressed hard on her clit.

&nbsp;

�Cum for Master, slut,� he ordered,
again growling. 

&nbsp;

Her body arched and she gasped,
responding as he�d always imagined. The convulsions that washed over her made
his body throb for her. The van was slowing. They were at their destination. He
leaned forward pressing in harder encouraging the multiple orgasms she had so
often. She mewed, making beautiful noises against him. Kasim
would fulfill his part of the bargain and buy her at the sale. He would train
her at his slave camp and make her the slut she truly was. He would wait a year
then buy her back. She would service him with the skill that only Kasim could teach. She would be the slut for his friends.
He could just see their eyes as she crawled out beside him and knelt at his
feet. 

&nbsp;

The van door opened, she gasped as
his hand moved away and she saw the driver standing at the door. �Master?�

&nbsp;

�Come, do not embarrass me slut.�
He said pulling her up.

&nbsp;

�Yes sir,� she said the fear almost
overwhelming her again. He pressed between her legs and she sighed, ripples
still washing over her. 

&nbsp;

Beth trembled against Master as he carried
her into the warehouse through the dock. She was naked, her wrists and ankles
cuffed. She reached up and realized he had not put a collar on her. He was
carrying her into a building without his mark. She started to tense. �No,� he
barked sharply at her and she relaxed against him, laying her head over his
shoulder. She sobbed, feeling uncontrolled. 

&nbsp;

�Will she behave?� a harsh German
accented voice said. Beth looked up to see a tall muscular man standing before
them. �Or will she have to be restrained the entire time?�

&nbsp;

�Master, what��

&nbsp;

�Man you haven�t even told her?�
The muscular man sighed in disgust. 

&nbsp;

�She will behave,� Master set her
down on her feet and looked her in the eyes. �You will behave; if you don�t you
have humiliated me. My name is connected to you, you will not embarrass me.� 

&nbsp;

�Master please, sir, what�� she
begged setting her hands on his chest the chain attaching them tinkling. 

&nbsp;

�You are being sold. It is what you
need to fulfill your desires.�

&nbsp;

�No, sir?� she said in a frantic
whisper. �No, sir, I need to feel safe, to be held tightly.� 

&nbsp;

�Beth,� he growled pulling her a
step aside, letting someone else move ahead of them. �You do. You will not
argue with me.� 

&nbsp;

�You�re giving me away?� she mewed
up into his face, frantic.

&nbsp;

�No, I�m selling you. It is what
you need. You will not argue with me. You will behave. This is what you want.�
He jerked her along, the short chain between her ankles made her progress slow
and difficult. 

&nbsp;

Beth lifted her hands to her face
and covered it as they stood in line before a table. The man came forward
again. �Will she behave?�

&nbsp;

Master pulled her hands down, �Will
you do as you are told?� 

&nbsp;

�Yes Master,� she mewed between
little sobs. �I will behave.� 

&nbsp;

~

&nbsp;

Beth watched as Master walked away,
his back straight his chin up. He believed this was what she wanted and needed.
She knew he was wrong. She needed his love, his care, to be protected. The
chain at her wrists hooked onto a moving chain, there was about 10 feet between
her and the next woman, and to the woman behind her. They were moving slowly
toward a curtained doorway. She had no choice, it was too late. 27 had been
written on her front thigh and her right hip. She was a number, a nothing to be
sold. 

&nbsp;

~

&nbsp;

Beth heard the auctioneer and
wanted to fight, she wanted to run but she was chained. She would walk through
the curtains next as the chain was pulled. What was he thinking to do this to
her? The chain pulled she walked forward the woman before her was on her
tiptoes the chain rose in front of the audience. She noticed that the women
before had been removed from the chain. Where were they? She felt suddenly
frantic. A movement and she saw Master at the back of the room. Maybe this was
all a mistake and he was just testing her. She felt her body and mind relaxing.
She would make him proud.

&nbsp;

Beth could only hear roaring in her
ears as she watched Master just stand there as they bid on her. She turned, she
shifted, she felt the tears trickling down her face.
Master jerked, he went pale. A man in the second row raised his hand again. Two
men were bidding now, Master took a step forward but
then back. He met her eyes, the gavel fell. He looked down,
she thought he was going to be sick. 

&nbsp;

�Girl,� she turned to look at the
tall German as he unchained her from the long chain and walked her toward the
stairs. �You�ve been bought for a good price. Make your Master proud, behave.�
He shifted the chain at her cuffs behind her back.

&nbsp;

Beth couldn�t respond her mouth was
dry, her body numb, no words would even form when she tried. �Perfect,
just perfect.� The man looked down at her, the man who had bought her.
She watched as he reached for her then heard Master.

&nbsp;

�There has been a mistake?� 

&nbsp;

The man�s eyes went cold as he
slowly turned. �I have paid for what I have purchased. There is no mistake.� It
was clear the man was not used to being argued with. She watched as Master just
stood there. 

&nbsp;

�Could we speak privately?� Master
asked in a tone she never expected to hear from his lips. 

&nbsp;

Beth stood silently outside a door, her wrists chained to a hook on the wall, the man who
owned her had the keys. She leaned in burying her face in her hands. This was a
dream, a nightmare, even a night terror. It couldn�t be real.

&nbsp;

�Beth,� Master�s voice was at her
side. �I�ve been a fool, there was a mistake, my
friend was to buy you. I didn�t expect someone to��

&nbsp;

�You undervalued her,� she lifted
her chin and turned to see her new owner. �Now stop traumatizing her and go,
it�s too late. I�m not giving you an opportunity to own her she is a present. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Chapter 2

&nbsp;

I could not believe my good fortune
- she was just the one I wanted.&nbsp; I had picked her out of the catalog on
my first read-through, but I had figured that she would be out of my price
range.&nbsp; Thank God for cheap people.&nbsp; Whether the rest of the crowd
had overlooked

her
because she wasn't from an exotic land or didn't have this or that, I didn't
know.&nbsp; All I knew was that in the end it was just me against the other
guy, and he obviously wasn't going to pay what I was willing to.&nbsp; This
woman - Beth had been her name - was perfect

for my
needs.

&nbsp;

I led her by a leash that was
attached to her collar, her feet stumbling as she tried to walk without the
balance her arms would have provided but for the fact they were bound behind
her.

&nbsp;

&quot;Please,&quot; she said,
&quot;this is all a mistake.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;No, there is no
mistake.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;But my Master, he thought -
he meant -&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I am your Master.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;But I -, Master...&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Master&quot; I said,
derisively, &quot;sold you.&nbsp; He is not your Master and you are never to
speak of him again.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;I want to go home,&quot; she
sobbed.

&nbsp;

&quot;That's where you'll be
going.&quot;

&nbsp;

At this she brightened, the sobs
stopping momentarily. &quot;Y-you mean..you
mean you're going to let me go?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Who said anything about
letting you go?&quot; I said.

&nbsp;

I led her into the business office
and hitched her leash to one of the hooks on the wall, leaving her to stand with
the other slaves who were being purchased. 

Then I waited until one of the men
at the four desks in the room was free so that I could sit down and complete
the paperwork.&nbsp; He glanced over the form, nodding, making some entries on
the computer.&nbsp; I watched Beth from the across the room, standing there
with her arms pulled tightly behind her, breasts out, perhaps a head taller
than most of the other slaves.&nbsp; Her blue eyes were fixed on me, and I
could see that she was trembling.&nbsp; I was not a heartless person, and there
was a part of me that pitied her, this librarian who had been living her life
on the Internet, chatting with a dom,
living out her fantasies in cyberland with no thought
that any of them would ever come true. 

&nbsp;

This fellow she had been playing
with had decided to find her - a meeting that led to her being put up for
auction.&nbsp; Only I had changed the plan- it was not his friend who had
bought her but me.&nbsp; I could not wait to begin reshaping her world.

&nbsp;

&quot;I see you want her delivered
on Christmas Eve,&quot; the man at the desk said.&nbsp; &quot;That's going to
cost you.&nbsp; Our delivery people have families too, you know, they like to
be home that night.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;That's ok.&nbsp;&nbsp; I
think I can afford it given the good price I got on her.&quot;

&nbsp;

The man ran through a couple of
options with me, given that they would be keeping her for the next few days.
There were boarding costs, and for a price they could give her some crash
training, house-break her so to speak.

&nbsp;

&quot;No, that won't be necessary, &quot; I said.&nbsp; &quot;We plan to train her ourselves.&quot;&nbsp;
The man looked at me.&nbsp; &quot;My wife,&quot; I explained, glancing back
across the room at my trembling new slave.&nbsp; Gawd
was she magnificent. &quot;This is her Christmas present.&quot;

&nbsp;

Chapter 3

&nbsp;

Shari
and I had a pact on Christmas morning � whoever woke up first would wake the
other up with oral sex. OK, so we did it on other days, too - but those were
just as a surprise.&nbsp; On Christmas morning it was a tradition in our house,
and had been for the seven years we'd been married.&nbsp; This Christmas morning,
Shari was sustaining that tradition by giving
my cock the best sucking she had given it all month.&nbsp; I was in heaven as
she worked it in and out of her mouth and swirled her tongue around the tip
like it was a lollipop.&nbsp; Shari was proud
of her cock sucking ability - she considered it an art form and herself
unmatched in skill.&nbsp; It was a good thing to be confident about,

I thought, smiling down at the way
the sheet, which covered her completely, bobbed up and down with her movements.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;Is that one of Santa's elves I feel down there?&quot; I said.&nbsp; She
stopped for a moment, then gave my cock a nice long lick and kiss before she
came prowling up from under the sheet, her dark locks tousled down over one of
her brown eyes.&nbsp; She was grinning like the

proverbial cat who had swallowed
the canary.&nbsp; &quot;I didn't mean to interrupt,&quot; I said.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;Merry Christmas, baby&quot; she said, kissing me as she climbed on board,
positioning her pussy over the tip of my cock and slowly sliding herself down
into the

saddle.&nbsp; She moaned and threw
her head back as she began to ride me.&nbsp; My hands reached up and fondled
her breasts, rolling her nipples back and forth as she fucked me.&nbsp; The
pace gradually quickened, until I was thrusting up and lifting her small body
up off the bed, her head thrashing from side to side as she rode me like a
wave.&nbsp; &quot;Oh Chad,
Oh Chad,
baby,&quot; she began to say though her gasps, &quot;fuck me, fuck me, fuck
me,&quot;

and so on, over and over until she
and I came together in a big crash.&nbsp; She collapsed on top of me and we lay
like that for a few minutes, her hand on my chest, feeling my heart beat, both
of us catching our breath. &quot;Geez I'm glad we
don't have kids,&quot; she said, and we laughed.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;True.&nbsp; Who wants to be up half the night putting together a tricycle,&quot;
I said.&nbsp; She brushed her hair out of her eyes and smiled that smile at
me.&nbsp; &quot;What?&quot; 

I laughed.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;You were up to something last night,&quot; she grinned. &quot;I heard you
downstairs.&quot;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;That must have been Santa you heard because I slept like a log.&quot;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;Liar,&quot; she giggled, playfully slapping my chest. &quot;So are you
going to tell me?'

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;Tell you what?&quot;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;What big surprise you were working on for me?&quot;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;I don't know anything about a surprise.&quot;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;I have ways of making you talk,&quot; she said in a mock-menacing tone.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;That I don't doubt.&quot;&nbsp; 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
She kissed me on the lips and purred &quot;Tell your little Shari
baby what you got for her.&quot;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;Well, maybe there's a little something.&quot;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
She squealed in delight.&nbsp; &quot;Tell me, tell me.&quot;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;How about we just go have a look?&quot;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;Yay!&quot; she said, jumping off the bed and
clapping her hands.&nbsp; &quot;You know how I like prezzies.&quot;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I got up and put on a pair of black silk pajama bottoms and a t-shirt.&nbsp;
Shari put on her sexy little red shorty-PJs from Victoria's Secrets that
showed her cute ass off so well.&nbsp; I know what she was thinking, that I
wouldn't be able to resist her and that I'd be fucking her doggie-style under
the tree within the hour.&nbsp; I smiled, thinking about the surprise she was
going to get when she walked into our living room.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;Hurry,&quot; she said, doing a little dance as I put on my slippers. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;Relax,&quot; I said, chuckling to myself now.&nbsp; &quot;Your present
isn't going anywhere.&quot;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
As we got to the top of the stairs I cut her off so I could go down first; I
wanted to be able to see her face.&nbsp; We walked down the long curving
staircase and through the foyer to the living room and....

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
There she was, in the middle of the room just as I had left her-tied to one of
our heavy oak kitchen chair, arms behind her, legs pulled back, so that her
feet were off the floor and her ankles were tied to the chair's rear legs - a
bright red ball gag in her mouth and a matching ribbon sash with a bow wrapped
around her, coming down between her breasts.&nbsp; About the only thing she
could move was her head, and she jerked it back in surprise (I guess it was
surprise, wondering what could truly surprise the poor girl at

this point) when she saw us come
around the corner.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Shari's jaw dropped, and she slowly brought a
hand to her mouth.&nbsp; She turned to me, her big brown eyes wide with
surprise.&nbsp; &quot;Oh...my...God,&quot; she said, taking a step
closer.&nbsp; She looked back at me, trying to form words - she didn't even
know what to ask!

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;Do you like her?&quot; I asked, as if the bound woman in our living room
was a new puppy.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Shari giggled.&nbsp; &quot;What's going on?
Who is this?&quot;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Beth was watching us both carefully, moving her head from me to Shari as we spoke.&nbsp; She was not struggling, she must
have already come to the conclusion she was

going to be here for awhile.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;She's your present.&quot;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;My what?&nbsp; Who is she?&quot; Shari took another step closer, then another, until she
was standing over Beth, who moved her head away from her as best she
could.&nbsp; Shari squatted down and looked
her in the eyes. &quot;Is she a prostitute or something?&quot;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;Baby, do you think I'd bring a dirty prostitute into the house for
you?&nbsp; You know me better than that.&quot;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;Well then who is she?&quot;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;She is our slave.&quot;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;Our what?&quot; Shari
giggled.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;Our slave.&nbsp; I bought her, at an auction,
for you. For us.&quot;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;You bought her?&quot;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;Yes.&nbsp; I thought it was the perfect solution to our little
dilemma.&quot;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Ah yes, the little dilemma, which was how this all got started.&nbsp; Both Shari and I enjoyed bdsm, but
both of us enjoyed the dominant role.&nbsp; While we tried to accommodate each
other on occasion with some bondage and role play, it was the one aspect of our
sex life that just did not have a lot of fire power to it.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;But how does it, who, I mean, where was this auction, how can this be
-&quot;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;Sssshhhh,&quot; I said.&nbsp; &quot;None of
that matters.&nbsp; She is here now and she is ours and that is all that
matters.&quot;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;She has a nice body,&quot; Shari
said.&nbsp; 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;You can touch her, she can't bite, not with that
gag in her mouth, anyway.&quot;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Shari reached out and took Beth's right breast
in her hand.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;Mmmmmmpppphhh&quot; Beth said, or tried to say,
through the gag, rocking against her bonds.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Shari jerked her hand back, surprised, then
blushed. &quot;I don't think she likes that.&quot;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;What she likes doesn't matter, baby.&nbsp; You�re the boss of her
now.&quot;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Shari frowned and furrowed her brow
&quot;That's right, I'm the boss of you,&quot; she said to Beth.&nbsp; She
reached out and took the woman�s breast in her hand again, and this time Shari did not let go when she began bucking and making
noises through the gag.&nbsp; Shari giggled
and turned back to me.&nbsp; &quot;I don't think she likes her titties being touched.&nbsp; Shame too, they're such nice titties.&quot;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;She'll get over it,&quot; I said.&nbsp; &quot;That's what these are
for.&quot;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Shari had been so excited by the bound slave
girl (could you blame her, really?) that she hadn't even noticed all of the
packages under the tree.&nbsp; &quot;You did get me prezzies!&quot;&nbsp;
she giggled and clapped.&nbsp; &quot;Are these all for
me?&quot;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;Well, I plan to use a few of them myself.&nbsp; Open this one first, &quot; I said, handing her a long, thin package wrapped in
green foil paper.&nbsp; She ripped off the wrapping and tore open the box and
held up the sleek black crop.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;Weeeeeeee!&quot; she said, swishing it through
the air. Beth's eyes widened in alarm.
&quot;Hah!&quot; Shari, said, pointing the tip of the crop at the terrified woman.&nbsp;
&quot;You better be on your best behavior, girl.&quot;&nbsp; She whistled it
through the air again, seeing how close she could come to Beth without hitting
her, giggling all the while.&nbsp; Tiring of this, she dropped the crop to the
floor and clapped her hands 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;What else?&nbsp; What's this?&quot; she said, picking up a smaller
package and ripping off the paper.&nbsp; It looked like a jewelry case for
earrings, only a bit bigger. I smiled as she opened it and looked at the silver
items inside, then looked to me with a questioning

expression.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;Nipple clamps,&quot; I explained. &quot;Let me show you,&quot; I took one
out and bent over our slave and took her left breast in my hand, rolling the
nipple until it got hard.&nbsp; I fastened the clip to the nub and then turned
the screw to tighten it into place.&nbsp; She winced and groaned through the
gag, then tried to shake it free. Nothing doing.&nbsp;


&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;Let me try,&quot; Shari giggled, taking
her other nipple and putting the clamp in place.&nbsp; &quot;Like this?&quot;
she said, turning the screw.&nbsp; She must have given it one more turn than I
did because Beth reared her head back and groaned even louder.&nbsp; She began
shaking her head no-no-no and there were tears in her eyes.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Shari giggled again.&nbsp; &quot;She's
slobbering,&quot; she said.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;I think the term is blubbering.&quot;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;No silly.&nbsp; Look.&nbsp; She's slobbering around her gag.&quot; It was
true, the saliva was running out the corners of her
mouth down onto her chest.&nbsp; &quot;That's kind of

yucky.&quot;&nbsp; Shari went to the kitchen and came back with a towel and
dried Beth's tears and her slobber. &quot;Can't have you all
yucky.&nbsp; I hate yucky.&quot;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;Open something else,&quot; I said.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;Yay,&quot; Shari
said, and opened another package, this one containing a long bullwhip.&nbsp;
&quot;Woohhhh,&quot; she said, &quot;this must be for
when she's really bad.&quot;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;No.&nbsp; This one is,&quot; I said, handing her another. Shari tore it open and held up the long metal rod.
&quot;Cattle prod,&quot; I explained.&nbsp; &quot;Bet they didn't have many of
those in the City, where you grew up, Princess.&quot;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;You mean -&quot;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;Yep, it's charged.&nbsp; Just turn it on and - HEY, be careful, don't
touch the business end of that thing.&quot;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Shari giggled, holding the thing in front of
Beth, who's eyes were very wide.&nbsp; She had gone
perfectly still.&nbsp; &quot;This seems to have her attention.&quot;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;That it does.&quot;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;What else, what else,&quot; Shari said,
diving under the tree.&nbsp; She began tearing package after package open. A cane. &nbsp;A flogger.&nbsp; Arm binders.&nbsp; Cuffs.&nbsp; An assortment of blindfolds and gags.&nbsp; Some of them she
knew what they were, others of them I had to explain. Through it all Beth sat
there, mewing through her gag, the slobber dribbling down, her face flushed
with fear and humiliation.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Shari went on opening presents as I made some
coffee and poured it into big mugs for us, then started a nice fire.&nbsp;
&quot;I can't believe how much stuff you got.&quot;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;We're going to need it,&quot; I said.&nbsp; &quot;We have to train her
ourselves.&quot;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;Train her, you mean to do like tricks?&quot;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;No sweetie, train her to be our slave.&nbsp; She is not here willingly.&nbsp;
She is here because she was bought and sold.&nbsp; Just because I paid a good
price for her does not mean she's ours, not in every sense of the word, I
mean.&quot;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Shari crinkled up her nose the way she did
when she didn't know what I was talking about.&nbsp; She was adorable.&nbsp;
&quot;So, you're saying...what are you saying?&quot;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;I'm saying we have to train her to be obedient, to follow our every
command,&quot; I said, handing her the last wrapped package.&nbsp; Shari tore it open and took out the black leather collar.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;Pretty,&quot; she said, running her finger over it.&nbsp; She stood up
and placed it around Beth's neck and fastened the buckle in the back.&nbsp;
&quot;There you go, girl.&nbsp; Now

we're all set.&quot;&nbsp; Beth
hung her head, the tears dripping from her eyes onto her lap as she wept
through the gag.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Shari turned to me.&nbsp; &quot;Hey, what's
her name?&quot;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;Whatever we want it to be?&quot;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;What was it?&quot;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;They didn't tell me.&quot;&nbsp; I don't know why I lied,
it just came out that way.&nbsp; For some reason I wanted to be the only one
who know her as Beth.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;Hmmmmmm,&quot; Shari
said, putting a finger under the slave's chin and lifting her head so she could
dry off her tear-stained face.&nbsp; &quot;Now what should we call you?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;There's time to decide that,&quot; I said.&nbsp; &quot;Now do you want to
see the other part of your surprise?&quot;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;What do you mean?&quot;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;Well, our slave has to have a place to live.&quot;&nbsp; Shari looked at me, a grin spreading on her lips.&nbsp; I
nodded toward the basement door.&nbsp; &quot;You see, not all of that noise
from last night was me putting our little friend in place here.&nbsp; There
were a few workers making some modifications to our sub-basement.&nbsp; Want to
go peek?&quot;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;Oh you bad, bady, boy,&quot; Shari said, throwing her arms around my neck and raising
up on her tippy-toes to kiss me.&nbsp;
&quot;What have you done?&quot;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;Let's go see.&quot;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;Can we take her with us,&quot; she said, looking back over her shoulder
at our new slave.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
&quot;Baby, when it comes to her, you can do anything you want.&quot;

&nbsp;

Chapter 4

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
I watched as this woman leaned over me again. The prod in her
hand forgotten by her as she wiped me face again. �Such
a sloppy, ummmm, slave.� She had glanced up at
her husband. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
�Careful Shari,� he reached out and took the
prod and set it aside. He was smiling and chuckling. �Do you want me to help
you untie her?� 

&nbsp;

Shari
nodded, �I can�t see�� Chad
reached down and placed a rope in her hand. �Pull.� 

&nbsp;

One hard jerk and I was free from
the chair. My hands shot to my nipples and I tried to remove the clips. �Chad,� Shari
whined. I saw him coming and tried to run but my legs wouldn�t function.
Suddenly the pain of the blood flow returning to my arms and legs caused me to
crumble off the chair as I leaned. 

&nbsp;

�Chad,�
Shari yelled as she reached down and lifted my
shoulders, kneeling beside me. I saw Chad move toward the tree then
back. He handed her another box. Her smile above me was instant. �Chad,
another prezzie?� I gasped as I was dropped
back to the floor as she rose. I scurried to my knees through the pain. A hand
dropped to my shoulder pressing down biting in firmly.

&nbsp;

�I think we�ll need them for the time
being.� The heavy leather sleeves encased my arms with effort. Chad straddled
the back of my head. I wasn�t going to give in easily. I had to get free. If
what I�d been through the last couple of days was any indication. I wouldn�t
survive a week here. 

&nbsp;

�Tighter, Shari,� Chad said as he
pushed my shoulders into the floor. She was sitting on my calves harshly
pressing my knees into the floor as she tied the long sleeve. 

&nbsp;

�She�s being a little pain Chad.� Her
voice was annoyed. 

&nbsp;

�She�s straight from the auction Shari. I told you we have to train her.� He always spoke
with a patient humor as he explained each little thing to this woman. 

&nbsp;

I just wanted to shout but the ball
gag was still implanted between my lips. �She should be nicer,
she almost knocked me over Chad.�


&nbsp;

He lifted and&nbsp;
I saw a wet patch on the inner thigh of his black pajama bottoms from my
face. I tried to turn but his hand pressed down. �Shari,
show her who is the mistress dear.� 

&nbsp;

�Oh Chad, really,� I felt her almost
fall of me as she hurried away. I tried to push up but his hand shifted from my
shoulders to my neck. He pressed in, a cutting off the air as a burn exploded
across my thighs. �Weeeee, oh Chad watch her wiggle. Hold her still.� I screamed into the gag
as the woman whipped me again in the same spot. �Oops, Chad look at that. I think I made her bleed just a little.� 

&nbsp;

�That will do Shari,�
I couldn�t believe he chuckled. 

&nbsp;

�But she doesn�t know I�m the
Mistress yet, look at her fight.� 

&nbsp;

�Ask her Shari,
ask her if she knows.�

&nbsp;

�Do you know I�m your mistress?�
Her face came into my line of sight as I tried to answer. �She sounds like a
little kitty.� She laughed in my face, tehn pursed her perfect lips in mock seriousness. �Be still
little Kitty or your mistress is going to spank you again.� I forced myself to
still and beg behind the cruel gag. 

&nbsp;

�Oh Chad,� she reached out and stroked
my cheek around the gag. �She does, she knows.� The whip dropped from her
fingers, the handle landing with a thud not an inch from my nose. I whimpered
again. 

&nbsp;

�Kitty, she�s kitty. I can name her
Kitty, can�t I?�

&nbsp;

�Sure Shari,
you can name her Kitty.� 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;
