Synopsis: Susan would like to help her father and the town with a special tourist attraction that will get more tourists to town. Although she is warned she would not understand the full implications to play witch. Susan and four other young naked girls end up as witches at the stake in the beautiful midsummer night.
The story is only fantasy.




A tourist attraction

The city was a trading centre for the large local country. But the city was also the city you quickly driving through at the highway. The city has only the usual tourist attractions, the old buildings, a war story and a dusty museum. Local people lived like the most and were not distinctive.
Of course, families and friends visit the city. The city provided only a limited resource for tourism. In several years the city had tried so many things to get part of the tourism.
Of course, there was a larger wooded area with lakes west of the city, a paradise for hunters. Sorry took the landowners too much for the hunting rights and the overnight stay, so it was only a few who were lured by hunting and nature.
Tourist Association went several times to the politicians for help. But who would generate the interest at the city. Another of the many fruitless meetings was set up again.
The local Tourist Association President Marcus Millstein opened the meeting. He reported on the nights in the municipality for the previous year but still awaiting figures from the cottage rental. Scouts expect to organize a camp in week 30, but expect only that the activities going on in camp. The Tourist Association will establish a tourist information satellite at the camp.
Sports Games will draw some spectator and some will stay overnight.
There will be made a new tourist brochure for the entire area and the President asked for new features in the directory.
As last year there will again be offered guided buses in the area and if it was possible it would be nice to change images in the museum.
Developments such as 'the beer day' gave a nice turn at the weekend and will be guaranteed more tourists next time.
Generally had more tourists visited the city, but the impression was that there was put less money in the city of the tourists. What the President strongly deplored.
President's orientation and the lacks of economic attraction of tourists were discussed.
There should exist something which made the city unique and put the city on the world map.
- The city's summer festivals look like all the other cities. Is it possible to fresh the festivals up a bit? I suggest that perhaps we should advertise with striptease. It would get some more tourists to the city.
- Yes, men. Of course they will then spend some money and have fun. But striptease advertises several cities it is not particularly appealing.
- Can we beat the summer festival with solstice celebrations? It would be a great night with striptease in the lights of the witch fires.
- Yes, but there will still be missing the great unique things. Witch dolls at the stake are giving no extra attraction.
- Do you mean we should have real live witches at the midsummer fires?
- I don't say so. No, witch burnings belongs to the middle Ages and it will not be allowed today. It would also be sorry for the victims.
- But it would then be a hit.
- Forget the idea. We are a modern society and no one believes in witches nowadays.
- Of course people believe in witches, and they believe in Santa Claus, too. People believe in witches and each year we burns symbolic witch dolls at the stake. Witches are thus sent to black mass with the devil.
- It was during the burning time between the years of 1400 and 1700 that was burned many witches in the Christian part of the world. I know that there were burned witches until two hundred years ago. It was terrible for the women it went beyond. But today? 
- I have heard of young women in their imagination actually want to be burned at the stake as witches. 
- I have also heard about it, but it is only wild wish fantasies. In fact they don't want this
- Stop now. Of cause a real public witch burning would guaranteed get tourists to this city, but I know a real witch burning is not possible. We must find more realistic tourist hits... 
- If I could get some young witches would Tourist Association so be interested in trying to get started a real witch&#8217;s process? 
- How?
- We must capture the witches when they are demonstrably engaged witchcraft. The witches must confess that they engage in witchcraft against public authorities and the Church. In consequence, then the Church must ask for, that the witches must be burned at the stake. The latter is a legal decision that might not be succeeded. The result will be that we have real witches in this town. It will give many curious tourists, especially if witches are young and attractive. We can always exhibit witches publicly when they are convicted.
- You may like to try, you need help? 
- Naturally. There must be witnesses and police presence when witches perform their magic. I think my daughter, Susan, will help us very much. But it must be prepared and there is only a little over a half months to the summer solstice. About two weeks from now, I present the witches.
The idea was discussed during the rest of the meeting and ending with that may be found up to four young witches to a possible witch burning. The agreement about the witches was not in the recorded. The witches must be appearing as something sudden appearance in this town. 
Since Marc Benson came home from the meeting he got an interview with his eighteen year old daughter at his work office
- Susan, I have something very important to talk with you about, something that could have a major impact on the city's tourist life. Do you think there are some girls who want to be witches?
- All girls are witches, Dad.
- Yes, but the city wants only four young witches for a tourism promotion. First, I try to create a credible witch Sabbath in the woods. I wish that you participate in the early ceremony to get the four girls in work, but you must pull yourself when the witches begin to practice witchcraft.
- Dad, did you mean I should lure four young girls to act as witches?
- Because, to be honest, so yes. The Tourist Association would like to see the four young girls acting like real witches. But I do not want my daughter to be called a witch, right?
- It could be fun.
- No. You keep away from this event.
- How and where should we set up our witch Sabbath?
Marc agreed details with her daughter without telling her about the final goal with the witches.
Already next day Susan began to look for possible witches at her high school. Two days later, four young girls agree to be the witches for the tourism association together with Susan. 
All five girls appeared the idea to make a secret witch Sabbath in the woods next Saturday night. The girls thought they would be alone also Susan. 
Susan told her father about the plan that girls would be holding a witches Sabbath on Saturday next Saturday.
Marc Benson contacted the tourist association. 
Via politicians, became a police unit appointed by the city authorities as witches hunters and two photographers were tasked to create documentation about the witches&#8217; activities this Sabbath night. Everything should go right to the town got its witches. 
The girls knew nothing about the city's plans with them and met with Susan to plan their witch fun in the woods. It all sounded exciting and everyone was keen to get an exciting and fun night deep in the western woods.
Susan was a little uneasy at not being able to tell the tourist association's idea that the girls later should act as the town's witches for the tourists. She held her mouth and then she planned that she also would be one of the town's witches. She would have some fun, too.
Marc Benson had given his daughter a large witch cauldron with a tripod to hang the cauldron up and to be use at the witch Sabbath. Marc had promised to run the equipments into the forest for the girls. 
Naturally, Susan was elected to the witches&#8217; priestess for the girls and one of the girls Lisa made it all more exciting by suggesting that they should be completely naked as witches to get completely in harmony with nature. After planning, the girls saw a DVD about witches. The girls were happy that they didn't live in the middle Ages when witches ended at the stake.
Susan drove into the West woods with her father Saturday afternoon and got mounted the tripod and hung up the cauldron. They had found a lovely open glade at the beach of a forest lake. There were beautiful, the forest bent down towards the water and flowers on the forest floor was in fullest bloom. The glade was well placed, so the girls could see the full moon when it came up over the treetops on the lake's opposite shore. 
- Dad, it's just instead of a witch. A witch can not get more in touch with nature than here.
- It's a beautiful place and I hope you all will amuse you. I have a few bottles of mead to help you in my car. Mead may be right for witches. Susan, remember that you must leave the square when the photographer comes. Do not stay there any longer. You agreed as the witch queen, so find a good excuse to leave the place. May be that you need to visit the toilet.
- Yes, father. - Susan told her father that she had no objection and se agree to continue the witch celebration. She was pleased to go a little wild this time. 
- You said something like that you all will be naked at the witches Sabbath, is it true? 
- Yes, Lisa thinks that we should enjoy ourselves as naked witches. 
- It's a really good idea. There will be no other than the photographer as onlooker.
Marc Benson didn&#8217;t tell Susan that there were Fantasy drugs dissolved in mead bottles to change the girls' senses. 
After having filled spring water and vegetables into the saucepan and making the firewood ready, they took home for dinner. 
The five girls met and cycled out to the forest lake in mid of the western forest. They reached the forest lake in good time before the sun sank below the horizon.
- No, where is it a romantic place. Here I am going out with my guy one day. Sheila looked excited around; - it is a true secret place for us witches. 
- Yes and it's a beautiful warm May evening; I can see you and your father have made it clear to us. It will be damn fun to be witches for a night. I think many girls dream about to try to be witch for a time. There is something exciting about the witch cult.
- We can always repeat this joke, Helen. I think we can easily create our own witches group. Barbara sat by the lake. - The water is warm enough for a midnight bath I think I will love this place. Shall we begin? I can see that the cauldron is already filled with vegetables. Should we not also have frogs and toads in the cauldron? We must be real witches. 
- Let us unclothe with the same, so we can enjoy the sun's last rays to our body.
- Do not you think there are some? May there someone whom jogging nearby or has their shepherd hours here. Why are you so eager to be completely nude as witch, Lisa? 
- I've always dreamed of being a witch in harmony with nature. Witches are nature's queens, the witches are original and they are life-giving. It is we girls who challenge the men so we can birth babies and keep the human race going. We are nature's guardians. All girls and women are witches by birth. Let us get the clothes off and feel nature's freedom.
Lisa's enthusiasm caught fire and soon the five girls stood completely naked. They looked embarrassed at each other. Then Barbara burst into laughing. 
- Why are we so embarrassed, however, we are not more different than we are in the bath after a gymnastics lesson, right?
The girls began to make ready for the evening. They put wood under the cauldron for the future warming. A bonfire pit was made clear and Helen work out a fairy ring together with Susan. Within the circle they made the five-star witch symbol. They made the star so big that each of the five girls could stand between two star tips. As Helen said, this was the way they all five could be inaugurated as nature witches at the same time.
Susan likes the feeling to walk naked around between the trees to gather wood for fires. Sheila and Barbara went small nonsense-making in front of her while they put their naked feet carefully on the forest floor among fallen branches and leaves, and went around the thorny bushes and nettles.
- How do you feel that being naked here in the deep forest, Susan?
- It's wonderful, I have always dreamed of this without knowing it. I hope not it's the last time we're here.
- I also think it's great. See how free those two are. - Barbara pointed at the two naked girls in front of them.
Several times they went into the forest to gather firewood for the bonfire. As the dusk fall they had gathered enough wood for the whole night.
No matter what her father had said, Susan would be witch all the entire night. If her father&#8217;s photographer would photograph her new girlfriends as witches to the tourist association's new booklet, so she would be liable with the other girls. It was just pictures and it thrilling a little bit to be a naked witch in the brochure.
They lit the fire and the fire lit up the small deforestation. Then the fire crackling and none of the five naked young girls discovered the two photographers who put the cameras up at a safe distance and began filming the naked girls' activities.
Only nonsense projected the naked girls and they began to playing horny with each other. They enjoyed the fire heat against their naked bodies. 
The Moon stood up and looked over the treetops at the lake's opposite shore. 
- Should we open a couple of your father's mead bottles, Susan?
- Yes, of course. - Susan had completely forgotten wine bottles lying beside the cauldron. The girls opened the sweet mead at only 15 percent. 
- Oh, it tastes wonderful, like honey. 
- It's honey beer, as people were drinking in the old witches&#8217; days. My dad thought it belonged to our witch&#8217;s night. Therefore, he found these bottles for us.
 The girls sat and stared into the fire while they drank some mead from the cylinders. It was as if each of the flames was alive and moving. Susa felt a kind of connection to the flames movements, the flames seem to dance. Susan stood up and began to squirm as flames and soon after the other nude girls attend into her the flame dance. The girls felt them strongly connected with each other and flames. They feel as they were real witches in the night.
The effect was caused by the drug of Fantasy, as Susan's father had come into the mead. But the girls did not know. They were just euphoric in their dance.
- Keep up where it looks good. Is it the time we must go to the girls and photograph them? - Whispered the one photographer.
- No, it's too early; we must wait until they are ready to entre their fairy ring. Yes, it's damn beautiful girls. I understand that the tourism association would like to have movies and pictures of their performances. - Whispered the second photographer back. - Wonder what they use our footage to. Hey, there's something... 
Susan remembered her duty as the chosen nature's queen and priestess.
 - Girls, I think soon, the moon is at its highest, we must make clear to our dedication as witches. We must purify ourselves by taking a bath into the forest lake in this beautiful moonlight. 
Glad they went naked girls the few steps down to the lakeshore in the soft grass. Carefully they went through the lakeside's reeds flora, out into the cool water. The girls threw them out into the quiet water, where the chilly temperatures prompted them to hold their breath a few seconds before their naked bodies had became accustomed to the chilling environment. As the girls showed up they began to spray water on each other. They were playing in the water for a while.
The photographers were fascinated by the horny and playfully naked wet bodies only illuminated by the moons shine at the lake. Only after nearly a half hour plays the girls went up from Lake Bath and the water at naked bodies sparkled in the moonlight. The girls went to the bonfire to let the heat dry them. 
The cauldron was cooked up and a couple of the girls put on more fire wood during the big cauldron which hung down from the tripod. The flames licked up at the cauldron's sides. The naked girls waited a little while they drank more mead.
The Witch ring and the five-star symbol in the middle were turned on. Susan then asked the naked girls to take their seats spread around the burning witch ring. Susan could feel the mead effects, she felt her elated, and feeling there should be something fundamentally positive, a sense of clarity and joy and love for the other naked girls. The substance Fantasy took effect. So much that she or the other four girls not discovered the two photographers came up to them.
- Hey, we've promised to take some pictures and movies of you girls, is it okay? 
The drug effect they got naked girls to smile lovingly at the photographers. They wanted to enjoy the men when they were finished with the ceremony. They would all seduce the two men. The photographers had their equipment ready and began filming the naked girls.
Susan's body trembled with excitement to see what would happen. Somewhere in her, she heard her father's voice told her that it was now she had to leave the witch ceremony. But she had never had this feeling of happiness before. Drugs took effect. She was together with the other naked girls and she had prepared her selves to this witches ceremony. She enjoyed to being a centre for photographers, so much that she was just about to forget the ceremony. Susan smiled and cleared his throat.
- I call now on all items when I turn on the candles. I call on the moon goddess, who hovers over us; I will call the sun god. - Susan turned toward the North Star - I call on our inner energies on behalf of the moon goddess who is our spiritual mother. Raise and release all your energies and himself. Sun God will take the moon goddess as his beautiful bride and followed along in the sky at all times. We will dance nine times around the fairy circle as a tribute to our mom up there in heaven. 
The two photographers filmed and photographed the naked girls' unbridled dancing around fire circle. The naked girls&#8217; bodies glistened with sweat.
- The Moon Goddess now demanding that we will be inaugurated as her true priestesses, as her witches. Step over the witch circle's borders and receive moon goddess blessing. Sit down and look at the moon; let the moon goddess give you your new energies.
The naked girls sat inside the burning witches circle and between two burning points of five star symbols for witches. The fire flickered and played with the shadows on the naked bodies. The girls hardly noticed the two photographers because of the drugs; they were only focused on the fascinating witch ceremony. 
- Raise you in the moon goddess name and thank you in silence for our admission as her priestesses.
The young girls stood as live nude monuments bathed in the moonlight, when police stormed towards them. Brutally, were the naked girls pulled out of the burning witch ring and thrown to the ground. Susan screamed while ushers forced her hands behind her back and brutally put her in handcuffs.
They tied behind naked girls were raised up to stand and then moved around the fire while they were held fast by the cops.
- You were notified of being witches and practice witchcraft. You were in flagrante delicto at this witch Sabbath. You have the rights of arrested people and may refuse to speak before you have lawyer present. We will now collect evidence of your activities.
The cops took pictures of witch ring and the five pointed star symbol. In addition the cops confiscated the photographers' cameras.
The naked young girls got a shock when a policeman took a toddler up by the now-boiling witch cauldron. Susan was sure that the child had not previously been in the cauldron.
- There is now a very serious accusation against you as witches. You have killed a small child and put it to boil in cauldron, witches. Do you want to make witchcraft with the child?
The girls wept as they naked were driven into the city's jail and put behind bars.
Marc Benson visited his daughter early the next day. He had been informed she had been arrested along with four other naked girls. 
Marc was unhappy, he has been so sure that Susan was secured. She should have gone when the photographers came to the naked girls. She had promised him explicitly to walk away, take his clothes on and come home. But Susan had been left with the other naked girls, why? He had warned her. Was it because she had drunk too much mead with the drugs? Marc was unhappy.
He could not demand that Susan were set free without the four other naked girls also were demanded to be set free. Moreover, he then had to admit, that Dr. Ralph Schmidt had detained a baby at the hospital who had suffered the infant death syndrome. The coffin had been officially buried with the child. But Marc has got the dead child by the physician, who was also a member of the Tourist Association's board of directors.
Marc had driven into the forest to put the baby corpse into the cauldron after he had driven Susan home yesterday afternoon. None of the girls had looked into the dish and if they had done it, the baby corpse was covered with vegetables.
Marc and the doctor would be jailed for their deed and scandalized. So Marc kept his mouth.





Accused of witchcraft

Marc went into the prison's one corner cage where the five naked girls were trapped. The cage was only designed for two persons with a bunk bed and a toilet. Only two walls were solid, the other two walls consisted of metal bars, so the naked girl was quite visible to those who came into the prison.
The girls sat and wept when Marc and a prison guard came to the cage. Susan saw that it was her father and went to the cage bars.
- Dad gets us out from here. It is humiliating to be here without any clothes or get us some clothes.
- I can't do it Susan, you must be kept naked as when you was arrested as naked witches. Why did you not as I said?
- They are my friends now, I had such a wonderful feeling together with them, and I could not leave them this night. It was wonderful until police arrived. Why did they do it? What happens? Who reported us as witches to the police?
- I can not answer your questions. But I know you all will be accused of being witches. I am truly sorry that you are one of the witches. It becomes difficult to change it now. I am truly sorry.
Marc went weeping out of prison; he knew he could lose his daughter. But if he revealed something, then would his life fall into gravel.
The first trial was the very next day. The five naked girls were again handcuffed and with his hands tied back, they were led into the courtroom. There sat three judges and two priests in magistrate seats. Otherwise, only the police, two lawyers, a prosecutor and a defender, and tourism association members present in the courtroom.
All five girls were placed in front of judges. The naked girls were read out the charges against them. 
- ...&nbsp; You all five accused of being witches and practice witchcraft. You are all in flagrante delicto during a witch&#8217;s ceremony in western woods. You acted as doing now completely naked and were naked into the witch's symbols, when police arrived. There was found a great witch cauldron to boil with the herbs, frogs and vipers, and a dead baby at just under a year, a macabre soup. We presume that you have killed the child to use for practice witchcraft. Simultaneously, three young people died in a car accident here in town tonight. We presume that a curse has brought upon them. In addition, four more died in this night, perhaps naturally, perhaps with your curses. It is know to be studied. There is in this morning found FMD on a farm near the western forest, a disease which is very unusual here in the area. Several events will probably be reported later. 
As prosecutor, I firmly ask the court for the harshest punishment for witches, especially because the accusation involving a murder of an infant and a horrible use of the corpse into the witches soup. 
The five naked girls were shocked. They had just enjoyed themselves and now this. The defender could easily reject the accusations. Susan looked over at him. He said nothing.
- We have never seen the baby before ... - Barbara tried to protest but was immediately adjourned. 
- Have you been asked, witch? You&#8217;ll probably be questioned if necessary. Has the prosecutor more right now? The defences? 
- I must ask that my clients get clothes made available.
- The court must unfortunately reject this because the witches have been found in naked condition. As long as they are accused, the witches remain in the discovery mode. Any more?
 - No. Then we go to the interrogation of witches. You are witches? 
- No, we are young students in high school last year.
- I can see in the papers, you are 18 years and 19 years old. Then you are fully accountable to the law. Will the prosecutor interrogate the witches? 
- With pleasure. The first question is naturally is you young girls real witches? 
- No, 
- Why were you completely naked out in the woods?
The girls hesitated a little. 
- We held a private party. 
- I can understand it if it were a normal bonfire, but there were also lit a burning witch ring with the five-star witch symbol in the middle. Why were you all inside the fairy ring when you were arrested by the police? 
The girls whispered a little together. 
- Higher, so we can hear you. This is a courtroom.
- We ... - began Lisa - We exchanged energies with the moon goddess. Susan elicited the moon goddess as our natural queen. We wanted only close contact with nature, as women. 
- Will you recognize that you are witches? 
- No.
Movies, pictures and content in the cauldron were presented as evidence. The child's corpse was highly incriminating. But the naked girls denied that they were real witches. A new and this time a public hearing was fixed a week later, when the tourist association felt that they had approval for a witch process. The naked young girls were put back in prison.
The city received the official legal authorization to conduct a witch process based on the tourist association's evidence against the five young women. It was agreed that the ruling by the judges had to be referred for approval with the documents at the government.
It echoed. It was the city with real witches. It was completely naked witches and they had to remain naked throughout the whole witch process. The hotels were booked up more days before the witch process. In order to accommodate the many listeners was the courtroom moved to the city's large modern sports hall.
 Marc Benson was both happy and really sad. His plan to get tourists to the city had succeeded beyond all expectations, but how could he get his daughter out of this game. Marc could not see any possibility because she had been girls&#8217; priestess and had arranged throughout the witch ceremony.
Marc showed that more accusations against witches in the Middle Age were rejected by the courts. But the tourism association wanted to convict these witches just to bringing the city to the tourists mind. There seems no ways to get Susan out of the witch accusations, the accusations he himself had helped to fabricate, just to get a great spectacle for the tourists.
The official proceedings began and the naked girls were brought to the filled sports hall and admitted at small cages at a podium to the right of judges. The cages were adapted so small that the naked girls could only stand upright in the cages. The podium had a height that everyone in the hall could see the naked girls.
Susan was shocked. She was exhibited as an animal. She saw herself and the other naked girls on a giant screen set above the judges. The naked girls&#8217; hands were loosened when the girls were in cages.
The Witch process began with a presentation by judge panel of the three judges and the two clerics, the prosecution and defences.
Then the naked girls were presented and were asked if they would admit that they were witches and that they practised witchcraft. The naked girls told they were innocent. Then the prosecutor got the word.
- High court, ladies and gentlemen. We have in this case a very unusual accusation. The city prosecutor these five young women to be witches, to exercise witchcraft and sorcery, to commit infanticide with a terrible purpose, and there a number of other charges related to the use of witchcraft.
On of the city behalf a couple of photographers paraded throughout the five accused witches&#8217; ceremony and the photographers result will now be shown on the big screen in an abbreviated version. The original is in the mayor office safes.
The film was run on the big screen. Susan cried when she saw the movie. The night had began as a happy evening and ended with the police fished a dead baby out of the boiling cauldron and the naked girls were jailed.
- High Court, ladies and gentlemen. Everyone will be able to recognize the young women on film as they were completely naked at their witchcraft ceremony. These witches stand here totally naked in their cages just as police caught them. Nothing has been changed, as the witches nakedness itself is a proof of their deeds.
The film proves that the young women have sought a witch&#8217;s ceremony and have completed the... 
The prosecutor reviewed the movie and noted that none of the naked girls had hesitated to cross the burning witch ring and stand by the burning pentagram, the five-star symbol of Satanism. There is no doubt that these young women is consecrated to Satan or the devil, what the film clearly shows.
What should the witch cauldron used to? We saw that the witches&#8217; puts fire under the cauldron just before doing their rituals at the witch ring. We know that there were subject different herbs into the cauldron, we know there were put toads and vipers in the cauldron, and macabre, we know that there was a small child in the boiling cauldron. These are the ingredients required for the exercise of witchcraft. That&#8217;s a strong proof of witchcraft.
This city prosecutors therefore these five naked young women to be real witches. I would like to hear that the witches&#8217; main priestess will agree with their sake before I continue. 
- She is the prosecutor's disposal. I do not recommend that she will be sworn on the Bible. 
Susan stared nervously down at the prosecutor from her narrow cage. The prosecutor looked directly up against her. 
- Are you a witch?
- No, no, I'm not a witch. 
- But you exerted witch ritual and you made incantations. 
- No, but I admit that I elicited moon goddess energies, as the movie shows. It is not witchcraft. It was to be a part of nature. It is the same as when the wolf or the dog howls at the moon, or when lovers enjoy the moon evenings.
- It will say that you called upon the original powers?
- Yes. 
- So not the power of God. You call upon you a heretical force to exercises witchcraft with The Moon's energies. 
- It is also the power of God.
- Why do you built a fairy ring with a pentagram in the middle? 
- We thought it would be fun in the wonderful night. 
- I do not know how much fun it could be; you performed heretical rituals as true witches? 
- No, we are not witches.
- Good, but why do you lit the cauldron in which there was elements of witchcraft? 
- We did not know what was in the cauldron. 
- How comes the child into your cauldron and when do you killed the child? 
- We have not killed this child and we did not know that the child was into the cauldron.
Susan wept violently, and the prosecutor inquired the other nude girls who gave in to the film documentation and other evidences and acknowledged they might be witches. 
Several incidents in recent times were attributed to the five naked witches' witchcraft. 
In the afternoon the witch process was suspended for two days so the naked girls could get time to recognize themselves as witches.
Crying the girls was again placed naked in their prison cage. 
Early the next day became the naked girls taken out of their cage and led in handcuffs to the prison museum. The three judges and the two priests sat waiting at a table.
- We have arranged a small corner especially for you in honour of the occasion. You have to spend all day today to clarify for yourselves that you are real witches. Here in the museum, we have various tools that can help you to confess that you are witches and that you have done witchcraft. We just need your confession with your signature. Would you confess that you are witches now?
- We are not witches. - The naked girls protested. 
- It shows the film and the images clearly you are. Well, we have all day to help you to confess you are witches. Let's start the show with The Rack; it helps quite well on memory.
Two prison guards seized one of the naked girls, Sheila, and put the protesting naked blonde girl up at The Rack. Her arms were bound out to The Rack two differential wheels over her head and her legs were spread and tied to the two solid corners. The other four naked girls stared with horror at the show. 
- Naked girl will you admit that you are a witch and have done witchcraft, then you will not be torture.
- I'm not a witch, sniff. - Crying Sheila, she felt totally degraded by lie open as a willing whore. 
- Stretch her.
Susan so fascinated at the naked girl who was clamped at The Rack. She was beautiful. A pair of sharp click from the latches broke Susan's thoughts. Tighten the wheels were turned; the naked body was stretched out. Sheila screamed in panic. The wheels were yet another notch. The naked body was stretched out so it was really bad.
- Do you admit that you're a witch? 
- No. 
- Give her a click more and fill the water in her.
The naked girl screamed as the two prison guards gives the wheels one notch more. 
Then they put a funnel in the mouth of the naked girl and forced water into her. She tried to cough, but fainted as she was drowning. The naked girl was released and placed coughing on the floor. 
All five naked girls came through the same treatment. But none of them would admit that they were witches.
Then the naked girls were hung up in the legs with his head down. Girls legs spread out like a 'Y' and hands were tied in handcuffs to a cement block under them. 
Susan was shocked, she and four other naked girls got pushed wide candles into their cunt.
- From now on, you just say to and you will get no more torture. The candles are fast burning, so they are burned down at two hours. But long before you will feel the candles heat. So we are only waiting for your confessions. Turn on the lights.
The candles were lit. Susan could feel the faint flame heat against her legs. How long could she keep? She knew it would do terrible evil when the light reached down to her labia. She was not sure she could cope with the pain.
The fast burning candles gave very stearin that ran down onto the naked girls' skin when they moved them just a little. Occasionally one of the girls screamed with pain. After an hour Susan began to feel the candlelight warmth against her cunt. The heath became worse and worse. She heard several of the girls scream in pain and she could not stand it any more she screamed and screamed.
All five naked girls signed their confession as witches and that they had practiced witchcraft.
The trial process against the naked girls the next day became a showcase of the city's five witches. The prosecutor showed and confirmed the five naked girls&#8217; confessions as being witches and has performed witchcraft. Moreover, the court finds that only the five witches could have killed the baby and put the corpse into the cauldron.
Although the labia even were red after the torture burning, the naked girls were taken to income, that they voluntarily had confessed their actions. No tags for possible torture could be seen on their naked bodies and their limbs were in good shape. A protest from the girls was suppressed. 
All waited in excitement on the court ruling and the punishment for the five naked witches. After an hour of deliberation the judges came back into the courtroom. The top judge announced.
- Prosecution and defence, ladies and gentlemen. The city has alleged that the five young women, Sheila, Helen, Barbara, Lisa and Susan, all naked in this trial are real witches. This is based at the proofs of their documented activities as witches.
Next, it is argued that the five young women all voluntary and written confessed to be inaugurated as witches, to have incurred witches ceremony and have done the witchcrafts to the detriment of the city and its inhabitants. Furthermore, it is shown that a child has been killed and put in the witch cauldron for magical purposes. Judicial, we call it a murder.
Therefore, the Court will deliver judgments in accordance with the applicant's claim. 
The judgement. The five naked witches must be condemned to the witch Punishment. All five witches are condemned to be burned at the stake before the 25 June this year. They must tread the fire, as they stand at this moment, completely naked.
The five naked girls broke down in tears. The close occupied courtroom was in shock even though all in secret had expected this judgement. The naked girls were led out of the converted sports hall to the police cars and driven back to their prison. None of the girls wanted to eat dinner, they wept into a restless sleep.
The five naked girls awoke next morning in a nightmare and the prison officers confirmed that it was the reality. 
- It's a tough ruling you have received. Unfortunately, requested this city that you should be forced to sign the confession as witches since the movie records shows that you without doubt are witches.
- The film clearly shows that you are witches, so we used only torture to promote the witch process for the sake of the many people who have come as tourists. They would then have an exciting trial to take home with.
 - What ... what will happen with us? 
- You will stay in jail until you will be burnt naked at the stake as witches. 
The naked girls were crying in the cage and prison guards smiled. It had been an experience practicing torture against the young beautiful shapely witches. They will dress the mid-summer witch fires. It would be the first time in a couple hundred years that there were real live witches at the stake. 
Days passed and Susan began to feel it natural to be naked as the four other girls in their little prison cage. Her nightmares were her fantasies about witches at the stake.
She began to feel an excitement to be a witch. The five naked girls had actually had a really lovely evening out in the woods. It was total freedom, a freedom which led them to feel nature's vicinity, yes, they by themselves had been a part of nature. The moon goddess had really given them an unforgettable night until police arrived. The rest had been a nightmare.
The naked girls&#8217; families often came and visited them. Only Susan's father, Marc Benson did not turn up. He would not see into his daughter's eyes. He had betrayed her, but she also had betrayed him by failing to leave the forest when photographers arrived. He could only see that it was due to the drugs in the mead, Susan had had drunk too much mead and dissolved drugs; then she may be having a feeling to be mentally tied to the other naked girls.
Marc was aware that she would be recognized in the first part of the movie, but it could be clipped prior to publication. But now ... now his daughter was indicted and convicted as a witch. Everyone knew that he had a witch in the family. Marc felt his family was hung out in public. 
He considering to telling the truth about the five naked girls, that the girls had been lured into a trap so the city could obtain a tourist attraction.
Marc had to recognize that a disclosure would come too late. All looked forward to the witches burning at this year's midsummer evening. It would be an event everyone would enjoy. Tourists will flow to in a great numbers. Marc's tourist idea was a success.
Officially, the town was given a one-off permission for these witch burnings, due to the serious nature and the judges&#8217; agreements to the witches&#8217; death sentences. The mayor saw a possible more permanent authorization in the future for his city for an annual midsummer event for tourists.
When the city's large square could become too small for the witch burnings, then the tourist association and the city's politicians chose to build the five bonfires in the hills south of town. A great valley was found so that people could camps up at the hill sides and all could see the witch fires.




Summer solstice witch burnings

Tourists flocked to the city several days before midsummer festival where there would be real live witch burning. The hotels reported busyness. The city had come on the great tourist map.
The last night they slept naked girls hardly. They were very scared but also excited. The girls had talked much about being burned as witches. They knew that they would suffer a terrible death. They all hope that they would either faint of smoke poisoning or the fire would spend a total of oxygen around them. They hoped it.&nbsp; 
Conversely, it&#8217;s were pricking the naked girls to be tied completely naked at the stake. Just the fire should not be igniting. 
The naked girls got breakfast and lunch. The girls waited anxiously and nervously.
At two o'clock in the afternoon came prison guards in and tied up the girls' hands on his back with rope, and the naked girls were led out of jail and down into the courtyard to an open horse-drawn open two bucket with rubber wheels. One by one the naked girls came up on the wagon and leave were told to get up while they were driving through town. The platform was only 35 cm deep, so the naked girls were widely exposed to the spectators along the route.
Susan was surprise when the horse wagon drove out of the courtyard. People stood near the sidewalk, everyone would see the naked witches and take pictures or film of them. 
- The witches are coming. - It sounded down the street and soon there came shouts against the five naked girls on the horse-drawn carts.
- Burn the witches - Do not fly away on a broomstick - Send them to the witch-Sabbath with the devil...
Susan cries. She saw the crowd in a flicker of tears. All pointed at her and cried witch. There were cried &#8216;witches&#8217; along the streets against all the five naked girls on the horse cart. Susan had no more tears, and only now she noticed the lovely afternoon sun. She looked bitterly out against the people while the horses pulled the wagon through town. The city as they are now naked witches had grown up in.
At the city limits, the naked witches were put into the bottom on the horse-drawn, when the wagon was driven into the hills uneven terrain. The naked girls are looked scared up against the many people who already had gathered on the hillsides. 
- Oh, no ... - Helen was the first of the naked girls who saw the bonfires. 
Each of the five bonfires was just over two meters high built around a thick pole where witches should tie firmly. The bonfires consisted of small branches and brushwood, which probably got the fire to burn with a high flame.
Two men dressed in medieval costumes came to the horse cart that had stopped in front of the nearest bonfire, and grabbed Barbara. The naked girl came down from the horse cart off to the grass. The two men took a firm grip in the arms of the naked girl and led her to the bonfire. A ladder was set up and the naked girl became untied then she could climb the ladder.
One moment stood the naked girl confused at the bonfire while three men came up at the bonfire; the two of the men grabbed her arms and pushed her towards the pole, then she stood with her back to the pole, then the men forced her arms to the back of the pole, while the third man chained her hands with handcuffs.
The naked young girl was left alone at the bonfire top and the ladder was removed. Against her will, Susan stared fascinated at the bonfire. She felt the thrill of seeing a real live witch at the stake instead of a stuffed clothes witch.
Horse carriage drove ten meters further to the next bonfire where Helen became tied up to the pole. The next who came up on her bonfire was Sheila.
 Susan was torn away from hers thoughts as the two men in medieval costume grabbed her and lifted her off the horse cart. She felt the soft grass against her bare feet as she was led toward the fourth bonfire, her bonfire. Susan looked towards the bonfire while she was led toward it. She did not accept that she should entre up on the pile of branches, twigs and other wood pulp. She feels that it was another girl who stood here while a short ladder was set up at the bonfire. Then her hands were loosened while the men still holds their grip at her.
A man went up the ladder. 
- Come up here, naked witch.
Susan turned her a moment to looking towards one of the two men who pushed her towards the wooden ladder. He just smiled. She grips with her hands on two steps of ladder and sets her naked foot up on the bottom step. She climbed two steps up the ladder and stopped to feeling the bonfire materials. Branches stuck into her palm.
The naked girl was given a boost in her ass and was forced upward fashion the waiting man who grabbed her arm and got her up at the bonfire. The wood materials poked against her naked soles. 
Susan looked towards the pole, while the last two men came up at the bonfire. In front of the pole was placed a small plate of woods, which she could stand on when she were tied to the pole.
Brutally grabbed the two men her arms and forced her to the pole. She was placed with its back against the pole and her arms were forced behind the pole and tied securely with handcuffs. Then the men went down the ladder leaving the naked young girl at the top of the bonfire.
- No, no. You must not leave me. I will back down. 
No one answered the naked girl. There was still more work to be done. 
The last naked witch was finally tied up on her stake.
Marc Benson had been praised by city council for his ideas to create something for tourism and it would of course be mentioned in the Bonfire speech. The mayor regrets of cause that Marc&#8217;s daughter is one of the naked witches, but it&#8217;s too late to save her from her fate without the other witches also must be taken down from their stakes. If then, the images of the city were destroyed and the city became a laughing stock. Susan must being Marc's distressing victim at the city's altar. It was a big sacrifice, but also a victim of a huge success for the city's tourism.
Marc Benson was obviously still sad to lose his beautiful daughter, but at last he had accepted it. She was as beautiful as she stood completely naked at the stake. All five naked girls dressed the fires. Marc had to admit that his idea had been fruitful. All spoke of the city which burnt real live witches and even naked witches. Marc so proudly up at her daughter.&nbsp; 
Susan cried the last tears. She looked at the many people who flocked down hills. Everybody want to watch the naked witches, everybody want to shoot photos and record movies of the bonfires with the naked witches. Through tears, she saw her father, who stood in the middle of the crowd in front of her wood bonfire.
- Dad, Dad, get me down from here. I'm not a witch. Save me, please. 
But there was no reaction from her father. Nobody would help her down. She had to be burned as a witch, she had to accept it. She looked at the other bonfires, where the four other naked girls stood as witches at the stake in the afternoon sun's glow.
How long must the naked girls wait before fires were lit? Susan doesn&#8217;t believe that the bonfires would be ignited until after sunset. She would live a few hours yet as an exhibited naked witch. 
Many people had camped in the hills around the bonfires in the afternoon sun. It was an afternoon excursion, and some began to eat their own food.
- It must be incredibly exciting to stand completely naked at the stake as witch. I am quite wet in the cunt to think about it. Shall we go behind the hill; I want you to rape me. I get so excited by the naked witches. 
- What do you say, must it be now? - Matthew looked down at his fianc�e, Carina, who was in a white short summer dress.
- Yes, I&#8217;m hot, come quick, we can't do it here in front of the people.
Matthew and Carina searched behind the hill. Soon they found out that they were not alone. Many were sexually excited about to seeing the naked witches at the stake. Carina could not wait until they found a hiding. She was warm and she felt that Matthews cock grew. Carina was raped in the grass. She stripped off her dress off the body and kicking the shoes off, she want to be completely naked like the witches.
- I hope your cock is so big that you can tie me to it as a witch. Oh, come, I'm your witch now. 
Matthew almost threw himself upon the naked girl with a bristly cock. He was also ready. Soon she caught his rhythm and they ended up as in one meat and together they exploded. They fell gasped for breath into the grass.
- I would like to swap with one of the witches on the stakes. I've often had fantasies about standing naked on a bonfire as a witch. Every time I read about witches&#8217; persecution in medieval times I get these fantasies. It gives me excitement. I would like to try to be tied to the pole completely naked on a witch&#8217;s bonfire. I want to play witch when we get home. Maybe I will volunteer as a witch at the stake next year. I do not think they will reject me.&nbsp; 
- But you will be burned as a witch. 
- Yes, but maybe I only want this. It is so wild and exciting. 
They went back to the bonfires.
The sun sank deeper in the sky and it began to spread a tense atmosphere. 
The sun neared the horizon and would soon the bright summer night making inroads. The witches' bonfires then had to be ignited.
Susan was so tired being tied up at the pole in more hours. She was excited, nervous and scared. The mayor went up at a lectern, which was set up in front of the witches bonfires and people sat down in the grass. Even the children were quiet. Only the speakers rattled when they were lit.
- It is a tradition in this town that the Mayor does the speech at the year midsummer bonfire. I have now done it for seven years. 
At the six previous years the midsummer fires stood only in the symbol signs. We burned witches dolls on this night, as a relic of old days. It is in this night that witches flew on their broomstick to the Sabbath with the devil. We all felt it was a romantic evening. Burning Witch dolls is just to reminding us of time for hundreds of years ago when there were real witches burned at the bonfire.
Everything was idyllic in our city until the police for a month ago seized five real witches in a big witch ceremony with witchcraft, sorcery and murder of an infant. The police found the infant boiling together with herbs, toads and snakes in a big witch cauldron. Witches were arrested completely naked and confessed to be witches and to use witchcraft. The five naked witches were convicted to the witch's only judgment, to be burned at the stake.
 There is to this midsummer evening raised five bonfire. At each of this bonfire stands a real live tied witch in this night. 
I want to thank the Tourist Association and especially Marc Benson of works to do this summer glowing night so exciting in these idyllic hills. The bonfires are beautiful here in the dusk and the naked witches are waiting impatiently to fly to the witches Sabbath with the devil.
We are gathered here, as in the old days, to scare the dark and dangerous forces away and to remind the witches that they will be burned in our town...
Susan felt the night's coolness against her naked body. She listened nervously to the mayor's speech. Although she knew that she would soon be burned, she felt her sexually high, where she would like to have one last rape. Maybe the death was her greatest sexual experience. It was really exciting to stand here at the stake as a naked witch. She was something special, as all the people had come to admire. Susan's cunt was all wet with excitement. Yet she was really scared, afraid of the fire, afraid of the death. She shuddered as mayor ended his speech. Now it should happen.
- ... Tonight we will celebrate the summer light and the liberation of evil witchcraft. I will conclude my speech here and wish everyone a great summer. The bonfires will be lit in sequence so we all can follow the burning of everyone of our witches.
Around the each of the bonfire ten young schoolchildren had been posted. Each of the children holds a lit torch in their hands. The torches brighten up so everyone could see the five naked witches on the bonfires. Carina could not take his eyes away from the beautiful sight. She really wanted to become one of the witches in the next year. This was romantic in the midsummer night. She wanted Matthew right now.
Suddenly it happened everyone had been waiting for. One of the children, a boy bent himself forward with his torch and put the burning torch in between the dry bonfire materials. Slowly the fire got hold at the bonfire with Barbara. The naked girl's screams sounded in the still bright night. She screamed in panic. She scoured at the handcuffs that bound her hands behind the pole.
The children pulled them away from the bonfire so that everyone could see the flames as grow more and more up through the bonfire. The flames were approaching the top edge of the bonfire.
Susan could only follow the flames from the other side of Helen and Sheila bonfire. Susan could not see Barbara, but she saw the flames rise higher and higher in the air while the naked girl screaming in fear. The fear screams suddenly changing to screams in high pain and shortly after it became quiet. The fire flickered high in the midsummer's night. The first witch was burning on her bonfire.
Susan saw the first flames rises from the Helens bonfire. People stared fascinated at the witch burning. It was amazing and beautiful. The flames fondle at the naked body of the witch, before they finally surrounded the witch and swallowed her. Only a dark silhouette stood still for a while at the burning stake and then it fell into the fire.
Susan held her breath and she looked at Sheila. The naked girl stood sharply delineated by the first two fires burning in background.
Sheila looked in panic down toward the children, who stood with their burning torches in front of her bonfire. Susan then look fascinated against the naked girl, she stood leaning against the stake with her hands tied behind it. The firm tits bristled in protests into the air. Her ass balls rested against the stake and her naked feet disappeared down between the bonfires even though she stood on a small wooden board.
The dark haired Sheila was the perfect naked witch. The bonfire was perfect. Susan was pleased to see another witch burn before it was her tour. It would be the last perfect midsummer bonfire Susan had to see. She was excited to see the bonfire burns with the living witch. It runs a chilling through Susan's back.
The children around Sheila bonfires move away from it. Only one little boy was left with his burning torch. He looked up at the young naked witch. Susan looked towards the boy's tense face just before he leaned toward the witch's bonfire and stuck his flaming torch into the bonfire.
The fire got hold. Susan could see how the small flames grew and jumped from branch to branch. Soon being several small flames joined together to larger flames. Susan looked up at the crying naked witch. Susan was wet in her cunt; she was so excited by the flames. Oh if only she could be raped just now, she was so ready.
The bonfire burning and the boy retreated. As the flames rose above the fire edge screamed the naked girl in panic. She scoured to get free of the stake. The flames lit up the naked body. Susan looked towards the exciting sight. Susan could smell the smoke and began to feel the heat of the flames. Next time it was her turn. Susan could see witch burning.
The flames began to creep in towards the naked witch. Susan could see that it began to glow near the naked witch feet. Sheila lifted alternately feet from the hot bonfire surface. The wooden panel holds the flames temporarily away from her feet. The flames rose around her, she screamed in pain as flames began to lick her legs and body. She writhed in pain. The skin was red and seemed to collapse. The witch screamed and then there was fire in her hair. She became suddenly quiet and she was enclosed by the flames. The silhouette of the naked body gets still darker.
Susan looked shocked to while the witch's naked body charred into the flames. Suddenly the black charred body slid down into the bonfire flames. Only ashes would be left of the beautiful naked girl.
Susan became nervous and scared. It was her turn to be burned as a witch. She felt the heat from Sheila fire beat against her own naked body. She was a living midsummer witch on the bonfire. She wished it was over as for Sheila.&nbsp; 
The children with torches smiled expectantly back at her. She saw in glimpses her own childhood, she saw in flashes from the times when she and her family had stood and looked at the midsummer bonfires with witch dolls. Her father had told about the burning time when they had burned witches alive at the stake. Susan and her siblings had shuddered with terror. Indeed, she had imagined that the witch dolls was a real living witches.
Now she was even the real living witch at the stake. In Panic she saw the children around hers bonfire began to pull away.
- No, no I'm not ready yet. 
Susan knew that she would never be ready, she just wanted to experience this moment a little longer. She looked down toward the little girl who was left with her burning torch. The girl looked up at the naked witch and smile. The little girl has a very important thing to do and she was very proud to be the one who must light the bonfire with the witch.
Susan felt her nakedness, she was defenceless. She noticed the stake behind her back. The little girl leaned forward. Susan knew what happened but she could not see anything. The first signs that her bonfire had begun to burn was when she began to see a thin smoke move up over the bonfire's edge. Susan panicked. The girl had lit the bonfire as Susan stood on. The little girl moved away with bright expectant eyes, as if it were Christmas Eve.
Susan could smell the smoke. She scoured in the handcuffs to get free. The flames licked up at the bonfire's edge. Her bonfire was burning; the flames would soon reach her
Susan looked against the hillsides, where people stood close. She could see people as they stood illuminated by a myriad of torches. The people had come to see the naked witches being burned at the stake in this lovely Midsummer Night. She was a witch at the stake and there was fire in the fire. Susan saw children and adults looking anticipation and excitement towards the bonfire. She also felt the thrill of being the witch, one of the witches who had pulled the many tourists to the city. She didn't felt it was she who stood on the burning bonfire, there stood a second. She stood between the people and looked up at the naked witch, who would soon be burned in the flames.
Marc Benson looks proud against his beautiful shapely daughter at the bonfire. She is a beautiful witch. The fire was about to break through the bonfire upper layers. Marc was pleased he had secured a permanent job in the Commune, and he still had two other children. Susan would soon die at the stake. Well, she might as well be dead in a car accident or she got cancer.
Marc had Tourist Association's word that he should organize next year's midsummer celebration with real burning witches. Maybe it was harder to get witches at this time?
Carina kept her not back, she and several other young girls lets them raping of their boyfriends into the bonfires light. Sweaty looked Carina towards next witch bonfire where the fire climbed up at the bonfire's front. She became wild with fire; she would stand naked up there at the stake next year and feel the flames caress her naked body in a final. She loved the fire; it was like a living organism.&nbsp; 
Susan tried to see her father one last time before the flames were too high. She felt already the heat from the fire. She thought she briefly saw him in front of the bonfire.
The fire began to come up inside the bonfire. Small flames came up right in front of the little wooden panel she stood on. More flames united and flames rose around her. Wooden panels began to be hot.
Susan looked up at the star-filled bright summer night's sky. Should she be one of the stars when she was dead? The fire heated her up. The flames grew around her. She had to make footstep when wooden panel was getting too hot for her naked feet.
Susan screamed in pain as the first flame licked up her left bare legs. There were flames on both sides of her and detached burning flame disappeared up over her. The heat was intense and she found it difficult to breathe. The fire spent plenty of oxygen and each time she breathed, she got only hot air into her lungs.
The flames caress the naked girl's body. She screamed in pain. Below her there were only red flames. Her red leg was only deaf from pain; she couldn't feel them any more. The fire licked up the legs and up to caress her naked body. Susan felt it almost like being in the bath in a flame shower.
Her brain would not let go. The naked burning witch looks upward with a face distorted by pain. She saw a single star over her between the flames.
- My star ... &#8211; the flames overwhelm the naked witch into an inferno of flames.
