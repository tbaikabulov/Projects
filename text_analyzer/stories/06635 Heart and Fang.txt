Synopsis: A young vampire has found the love of his life but is tormented by a desire to drain her blood. Little does he know that his beloved has her own twisted desires...






 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Darren stared into the mirror musing over his shirtless reflection.&nbsp; The dim lamp light played against his lean, muscular body and glinted off his mane of jet black hair.&nbsp; In the back of his mind, Darren knew how attractive he was but his eyes kept returning to the wickedly curved fangs peeking out from between his lips.&nbsp; Being a vampire made everything so much harder.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He listened to the pattering of running water, as his fianc�e showered in the nearby bathroom.&nbsp; A spark of hunger shone in Darren&#8217;s evergreen eyes.&nbsp; How he longed to pierce the woman&#8217;s neck and taste her blood.&nbsp; No, he pushed the thought out of his mind.&nbsp; This was Kayla, his beloved, the girl he wanted to marry!&nbsp; How could he even think of harming her?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Just then, the bathroom door opened.&nbsp; Darren abruptly withdrew his fangs.&nbsp; Before the wedding, he would have to reveal his true identity; he wouldn&#8217;t allow their marriage to be based on lies.&nbsp; Right now, however, the time just wasn&#8217;t right (or at least that&#8217;s what Darren told himself to justify his timidity).
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He turned toward his future wife.&nbsp; Without a word, she flipped off her shower cap, setting loose a cascade of shimmering brunette hair.&nbsp; She coyly allowed the towel to fall away from her slender female form.&nbsp; Darren filled with a different sort of &#8216;hunger&#8217;.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Come here,� he grinned lustfully as he tore the shorts off his legs.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh, and what ever for?� Kayla flirted.&nbsp; She glided to Darren&#8217;s side and playfully ran her fingers through his hair.&nbsp; Darren pulled her into a deep, passionate kiss.&nbsp; Rolling unto the bed, they gazed lovingly into one another&#8217;s eyes.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Darren ran his hands over every inch of her body.&nbsp; He lightly traced the edge of her neck, winding his way down to massage her tender breasts.&nbsp; He gently squeezed and kneaded them back and forth.&nbsp; Kayla moaned, rapping her arms over her beloved.&nbsp; The man gave one last playful squeeze before letting his hands travel downward.&nbsp; Rubbing over the muscles of Kayla&#8217;s narrow waist, Darren&#8217;s hands slid under her body and clutched her firm behind.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You&#8217;re so beautiful,� he whispered.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She tightened her embrace and kissed him softly in response.&nbsp; Darren tickled Kayla&#8217;s thighs before parting the lips of her pussy.&nbsp; She was practically dripping with female lust.&nbsp; He traced a finger around her opening before plunging it deep inside her.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kayla grabbed him by the shoulders and moaned, �Take me now!� in a low voice barely above a whisper.&nbsp; Darren was more than happy to oblige.&nbsp; His throbbing cock surged inside her thrusting against her clit.&nbsp; Each penetration sent waves of pleasure rippling through their bodies.&nbsp; Kayla felt the pressure building within her.&nbsp; The powerful cock pressed back and forth against her moistened clit.&nbsp; Up and down, forward and back.&nbsp; Finally, she couldn&#8217;t stand it anymore.&nbsp; An explosive orgasm wracked her body.&nbsp; She came and came over and over again until she couldn&#8217;t even keep count.&nbsp; At the same time, Darren&#8217;s cum exploded into her body until they both collapsed in sexual exhaustion.&nbsp; They fell asleep in one another&#8217;s arms.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Two hours later, Darren woke.&nbsp; He could never get used to sleeping in the nighttime.&nbsp; The covert vampire watched the slow rhythmic breathing of his beloved.&nbsp; After a few minutes she muttered something incoherent.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What did you say?� he inquired.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Darren� *mumble*.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He realized that she was only talking in her sleep&#8212;and apparently dreaming about him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unaware of her eaves dropper, Kayla dreamed her deepest erotic fantasy.&nbsp; She found herself bound spread-eagled to the bed, wriggling helplessly as a dream version of her fianc� stood over her with a wicked grin on his face.&nbsp; �You&#8217;ve been a very bad girl,� the dream Darren brandished a riding crop with a look of mock disapproval.&nbsp; He traced the end of the weapon lightly over her body.&nbsp; Starting under her chin, he wound his way down her neck, over her breasts and down her stomach.&nbsp; The skillful dominant let a light slap on her thigh.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Do you want more, bitch?� Darren demanded.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes, Master!�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Beg me.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh please whip me, Master.&nbsp; Whip me hard and have no mercy!�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He thwacked the crop with full force against her tender thigh, �Yes, you like that.�&nbsp;&nbsp; Without waiting for an answer, he let loose a flurry of blows up and down her arms and legs.&nbsp; He varied the intensity from feather light swats to vicious thrashings.&nbsp; Once her body was aglow with exquisite pain, he mounted her helpless pussy.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the real world, Darren continued to watch his sleeping angel.&nbsp; Up until this point, she hadn&#8217;t said anything recognizable besides his name and a few soft moans of pleasure.&nbsp; But now she pronounced, quite clearly, the words, �Oh�yes�Darren�fuck me�bite me!� The last part made his fangs protrude involuntarily.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Just as her dream lover began to slide his dick into her writhing body, Kayla awakened unsatisfied and wanting more.&nbsp; She rolled over, delighted to see that her mate was also awake.&nbsp; The bedroom&#8217;s darkness cloaked his fangs.&nbsp; Kayla snuggled up next to Darren, unaware of his vampiric hunger building to dangerous levels.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;ve been having some very naughty dreams about you,� she grinned.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Darren pulled away; his self control waning.&nbsp; He lost the ability to retract his fangs. �Kayla, wait,� he warned.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Too tired?� Kayla asked, deflated.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes,� he lied but began to regret the decision, �Wait�, actually, there&#8217;s something I need to tell you.�&nbsp; It didn&#8217;t matter that it was two o&#8217;clock in the morning; Kayla needed to know the truth and Darren had finally found the courage to admit it.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What&#8217;s wrong?� Kayla questioned innocently.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Darren flicked on the light switch but faced away from his concerned lover. �I know it&#8217;s unbelievable but I can prove it.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not human.&nbsp; I&#8217;m�a vampire,� he hung his head.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Wait, you&#8217;re� what?� Kayla thought it must be some sort of joke but she wasn&#8217;t getting the punch line.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Don&#8217;t be afraid,� he slowly turned to face her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On the sight of his gleaming canines all Kayla could say was, ��wow.�&nbsp; The pair stared in nervous silence for a moment.&nbsp; Kayla was the first to break the glaring quiet, �How is that even possible?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Vampires have secretly lived in the shadows of human society since prehistoric times.&nbsp; We&#8217;re created when one vampire transforms a human or, obviously, when two vampires mate.&nbsp; I was born by the latter method.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�So your parents, Mr. and Mrs. Johnson��
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Both vampires.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Wow�,� Kayla had an anxious thought, �Wait, you&#8217;ve never attacked anybody, right?� Kayla didn&#8217;t really need to ask; human or not, her Darren wasn&#8217;t a killer.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No, of course not.&nbsp; I survive by taking massive doses of iron supplements.&nbsp; They don&#8217;t help much with the cravings, though,� he wondered if he should&#8217;ve kept that last sentence to himself.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Cravings�for blood?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes,� he sighed shamefully.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Have you ever wanted to bite me?� Kayla pried.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�More than anything,� the words slipped from his lips before he could stop them.&nbsp; �But I&#8217;d never hurt you,� he added hastily.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I know,� she assured, �Hey, I always wondered; if a vampire bites a human, do they die or become another vampire?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Neither, actually.&nbsp; We don&#8217;t take enough blood to kill an adult and we can only &#8216;turn&#8217; a human by feeding them some of our own blood.&nbsp; But we have this venom, it&#8217;s not dangerous, but a vampire bite would hurt like nothing you&#8217;ve ever experienced.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kayla&#8217;s masochistic little heart skipped a beat.&nbsp; Darren didn&#8217;t notice.&nbsp; He trudged over toward the mirror, �I&#8217;m hideous.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No,� Kayla guided his face toward her, �you&#8217;re perfect.�&nbsp; She leaned in for a kiss but Darren pushed her away.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Please, not now.&nbsp; I might lose control.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You don&#8217;t get it do you?&nbsp; You know, I have my own little secret�,� she moved closer to whisper in his ear, �I want you to bite me.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What are you?&nbsp; Some kind of masochist?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Exactly,� Kayla grinned with a mixture of shyness and lust.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For a moment, Darren beamed at the possibility, but he couldn&#8217;t allow himself, �No, I won&#8217;t hurt you.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Are you sure?� she flirtatiously bit her own finger, drawing a single droplet of blood.&nbsp; Darren&#8217;s eye&#8217;s followed the crimson bead as Kayla drew her tongue over the wound. Leaning against the tormented demon, she flicked her hair aside to expose her slender neck, �Go ahead; it&#8217;s what we both want.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He grabbed her roughly around the waist but a lingering mote of doubt remained in his eye.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Really,� Kayla assured, �It&#8217;s okay.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This was enough to persuade him.&nbsp; Darren threw her onto the bed and pounced, lying horizontally with his fangs over the soft flesh of her stomach.&nbsp; The vampire sank his teeth into her like a ripened peach.&nbsp; He drank lightly so as to savor each drop of her crimson nectar.&nbsp; Relenting, Darren took Kayla&#8217;s opposite hand to his lips.&nbsp; He glided seamlessly from a tender kiss on the hand to a violent bite on the wrist.&nbsp; Again, he only drew a few sips.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Darren crawled over her blood-streaked body, bringing the pair face to face.&nbsp; He kissed her deeply, allowing Kayla to taste her own blood on his tongue.&nbsp; He moved to her neck for the final bite, grinning sadistically as he claimed his willing prey.&nbsp; Dagger-like fangs drove fiercely into her waiting veins and Darren drank deep.&nbsp; His venom flowed freely into the wound, enveloping her body in delicious agony.&nbsp; Though she writhed in blissful torment, his supernatural strength kept her pinned to the bed.&nbsp; He greedily drained her, feeding until she reached the point of exhaustion.&nbsp; The blood-loss left Kayla slightly drowsy but her smile carried an unmistakable glow of satisfaction.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Darren, too, was on cloud nine, fulfilled in a way he once thought impossible.&nbsp; He knew Kayla was the love of his life but he never dared dream she would share her body with him like this.&nbsp; Now more than ever, Darren was certain that this woman was his perfect mate.&nbsp; And he would do much more than marry her.&nbsp; Piercing his own finger, Darren whispered, �I&#8217;m going to make you mine� for eternity.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He offered a taste of his transformative demon blood.&nbsp; Kayla took the finger into her mouth and began to suck gently, allowing the metallic potion to course down her throat.&nbsp; A few droplets were all it took.&nbsp; Afterward, Kayla drifted into blissful slumber wrapped in the arms of her future husband.&nbsp; As she dozed, her tongue brushed lightly against a newly formed set of fangs.
