The Symbiote

By Darqside

&nbsp;

Victoria
always wondered why it was she felt so determined to be a scientist.� Was it the money?� The fame and tenure she got for doing
research?� Was it because she was a woman
dedicated to knowledge and uncovering the mysteries of the universe?

&nbsp;

Hardly.

&nbsp;

It was usually because she couldn�t get a date.� She was plain ole ordinary Vicki to her
friends, and any male within a 3 mile radius was always interested in someone
else.

&nbsp;

That wasn�t to say she didn�t know how to strut her stuff,
she just had a hard time handling pressure in
relationships.� She didn�t feel like
committing to anything would be worth her while.

&nbsp;

God must�ve been laughing hard and loud when Vicki got the
job at Derma-Dyne, a business dedicated to the science of beauty and skin
research.� She was the only unattractive
girl in the whole facility, which struck a chord with her co-workers who would
usually not be in ten feet of her.

&nbsp;

�I�m a nerd!� she whined to herself.� Her black rimmed glasses having to constantly
be pushed up on the base of her nose.

&nbsp;

It wasn�t always like this, she recalled.� She used to have many friends back in
college, even a boyfriend.� But she did
something stupid, despite being so smart.

&nbsp;

She dumped him, with the excuse that he was interfering with
her academics.� What a load of crock that
was, and to top it all off her friends knew it and abandoned her soon after.

&nbsp;

Academics and science were all that was left for her, it
seemed.� She was alone in her research,
and alone in her social life.

&nbsp;

That is, until her new lab assistant came.

&nbsp;

Rick wasn�t much older than her, maybe a year or two,
surprising for being a lab assistant.� He
was hired on by the company to help her do some epidermal research on a new
project Derma-Dyne was working on.�
Apparently it was going to blow the competition out of the water, so
they had to keep all their findings hush-hush.

&nbsp;

�Dr. Victoria Stanton?� he addressed her so formally with a
shake of her hand.� �I�m Rick Swanson,
head of the development firm from Cell-tech.�
I was transferred here to assist you in your research.�

&nbsp;

Her mind was wandering again, she�d barely registered he was
talking to her.

&nbsp;

�Oh I�m sorry, come again?� she blinked, somewhat
embarrassed.

&nbsp;

�Rick Swanson,� he repeated, somewhat amused at her absent-minded
personality.� �I�m the one they sent to
help you with your research on the specimen?��
He was rather tall, and his hair was remarkably blonde, with blue eyes
to compliment it.

&nbsp;

�Ah, you�re the one they sent.� She repeated.� �I�m afraid I�ve barely begun research as
they haven�t shipped me the new culture yet.�

&nbsp;

�They haven�t?� his blonde brow arched, something she found
incredibly attractive for some distracting reason.� �I think we should call the department head
and sort this out�that culture should�ve been here last week!�

&nbsp;

She decided it would be best if she distracted herself from
his manly appearance by calling up the department head herself to see about the
culture.

&nbsp;

�Why isn�t the specimen here like we ordered?� she asked
through the receiver.

&nbsp;

�Sorry about that, there was a slight malfunction in the
recombinant chamber, we�ve got the bugs fixed though,
so it should be stable.� A lab tech muttered into the phone.

&nbsp;

�It better be stable,� she fake grumbled, �or your job is on
the line.�

&nbsp;

She hung up the phone with a flick of her wrist and sat in
thought at her desk.

&nbsp;

�You think that was necessary?� Rick asked.

&nbsp;

�If I�m not bossy with those guys over at the DNA lab, they
never get anything done!� she sighed.

&nbsp;

�I guess so�you�re the boss.� He nodded and smiled.

&nbsp;

�Call me Vicki.� She said, wistfully.� �I hate professional formalities.�

&nbsp;

�Okay, Vicki it is then.� He smiled again.

&nbsp;

She felt she could get lost in that smile of his.� And the fact she�d be working with him now on
a regular basis only meant she now had a chance to prove she was more a woman
than a scientist.

&nbsp;

And she wasn�t about to pass this chance up.

&nbsp;

Later that afternoon, after several boring conference calls
about the nature of the research, Vicki was getting bushed and decided to go for
coffee.

&nbsp;

�I can get it for you if you want.� Rick offered.

&nbsp;

�No thanks,� she sighed wearily, �I need to get up off my
fat duff.�

&nbsp;

He glanced at her somewhat curiously, �I hardly think you�re
fat, Vicki.�

&nbsp;

�Why thank you, Rick.�
That has to be the nicest thing anyone�s said to me in a long time.� She
was quite surprised by his comment, at least until she noted he was eyeing her
hips swaying lazily in her lab coat.� She
decided to give him a show.

&nbsp;

She walked down the hall to the coffee machine in large tight
strides like some kind of model.� She
smiled to herself that she actually knew how to walk in her heels, unlike other
women she knew.� It was the sort of
talent she saved for rare occasions, just in case something or someone might come along.

&nbsp;

And sure enough, ole Rick swallowed the bait hook line and
sinker.� She could practically see his
tongue dragging on the floor.

&nbsp;

�It�s definitely nice
to have some attention for once,� she thought to herself prideful of the
fact.

&nbsp;

A few minutes later the courier arrived with their new
project.� Something that Derma-Dyne
apparently had paid a great sum of money to do research on, and was relying on Victoria
Stanton, the scientist, to pull off.

&nbsp;

For all appearances it looked like a black sphere surrounded
by a strange glass containment field.�
And anyone who saw it would most likely confuse it for a rubber ball the
size of a bowling ball.

&nbsp;

�So have you read the briefing on this thing yet, Rick?� she
asked.

&nbsp;

�Apparently its supposed to emulate
and restore natural skin cells while simultaneously developing skin�s natural
adaptability to renew itself in harsh environments.� That�s what it says in the brochure anyway.�
He smiled nonchalantly.

&nbsp;

�That�s what they want it to do.� But I know better.� She said, peering at it through
its glass shell.� �It�s alive.� And it depends on the human body for its
sustenance.�

&nbsp;

�Forgive my unscientific bravado, but, what is it exactly?�

&nbsp;

�From what the recombinant scientists have told me, it�s a
culture from a specific bacteria that interacts with a
special species of tropical tube worms that live in the volcanic water channels
in the Pacific Ocean.�
In simple terms it�s a symbiote.�

&nbsp;

�You mean it thrives off of a host?�

&nbsp;

�Exactly�but the thing is, the host has been the tube worm
for at least 6 centuries now, and changing its nature to serve as the host for
a human being is going to take a lot of research.� That�s where you and I come in.�

&nbsp;

Rick scratched his head.�
�I see.� So basically we have to
test it and adjust it so that it adapts to natural human skin culture, am I
right?�

&nbsp;

�That�s the gist of it.� She put the container in an even
larger observation tank.� �First thing
tomorrow we�re going to poke and prod it to test its response to stimulus.�

&nbsp;

�Okay, well I suppose I should finish up settling in the
lab.� I�ll see you tomorrow then.�

&nbsp;

�Glad to have you helping me out, Rick.� She smiled.� Although she felt the slightest urge to kiss
him for his humorous remarks earlier, she stifled herself and tried to hold
back her smile somewhat.

&nbsp;

This was going to be one hell of a research project.

&nbsp;

The first day went off without much trouble.� They�d sent several electric impulses to the
black sphere, noting when it took various shapes and reverted back to its
former sphere shape.� They began testing
the impulse intensities to see if that could control the sort of shapes the
symbiote could form.

&nbsp;

Eventually Vicki developed an algorithm of many different
electrical pulses that resulted in various geometric forms for the
creature.� Controlling it, of course,
would only be half the problem.� Getting
it to adapt to human skin would be something else entirely.

&nbsp;

A few weeks passed and Rick began submitting various skin
cultures to the enclosed unit.� It was
bombarded with several radiation rays so as to better observe the skin cells
and the malleable structure of the symbiote.

&nbsp;

It was noted that the skin remained relatively untouched
even though it could still be classified as �living tissue�, but it was
beginning to get obvious to Vicki that this symbiote was not reacting well to
human skin, or at least, dead human skin.

&nbsp;

They�d tried several samples of the symbiote and mixing it
with test subjects, such as monkey skin, and the skin of a cadaver.� But nothing was working.� Derma-Dyne�s main branch office called not
long after that, asking whether or not Vicki was making any progress.� 

&nbsp;

Vicki was starting to feel the pressure.� And she didn�t like it one bit.

&nbsp;

�Vicki�that�s crazy!�
You can�t test it out on yourself, you don�t
have the faintest idea of what might happen!� Rick waved his arms in the air in
frustration with her.

&nbsp;

�I told you the head of the department wants results�he
didn�t say what kind, and if we�re going to keep our jobs�well�somebody has to
test this thing the way it was meant to be tested.�

&nbsp;

�I know we�ve done several tests and the results have come
up negative, but I can�t believe you�d risk your own life for a Petri dish!�

&nbsp;

�Listen Rick, I�m doing this for science, not for the money,
not for the fame�.I�m doing this because I want to know
if it works!� she felt like she was having an argument with her old boyfriend.



�It�s just that�I don�t want you to get hurt, Victoria.� He
muttered softly.� �I�I really like you��

&nbsp;

�Listen, Rick�I want you to know you�ve been a good friend
and colleague, but right now I need you to be a scientist.� There�s just no other way.� And I need you to be the control factor in
this experiment.�� She sighed at last.

&nbsp;

Rick looked at her long and hard, wondering where the woman
had gone where the scientist now stood.�
He knew it was unethical�he knew it might be dangerous�

&nbsp;

He just couldn�t say no to her.

&nbsp;

�Alright�I�ll help.�
But not a word of this leaves the lab, okay?�

&nbsp;

�Fine, not that I would�ve told my superiors anyway.� Vicki
took a special needle filled with a separated culture of the strange black orb
and injected it into her skin.

&nbsp;

�Nnn�� she winced.

&nbsp;

�How do you feel?� he asked, recording her reaction on tape.

&nbsp;

�It feels cold�and wet�but at the same time feels somewhat
nice.� It�s hard to describe.� Kind of feels like Aloe
Vera or hand cream.�

&nbsp;

A patch of black sludge appeared in a small pore on her
forearm.� Taking her arm to a nearby
microscope, she began to study the reaction.

&nbsp;

�The cells seem to react to the substance well enough.� But it�s hard to say what its doing right
now.� It�s too soon to��

&nbsp;

For a brief moment she felt dizzy and lightheaded.

&nbsp;

�Vicki, are you alright?�

&nbsp;

�Just�feel tired for some reason�and hungry.� She mumbled.

&nbsp;

�That may be a reaction from the cells in your
bloodstream.� You might need to eat
something with iron in it.� He offered.

&nbsp;

�Listen,� she said, weakly, �I don�t want you coming in
contact with this stuff until we know what it will do.� I�m going to put my arm in a safety
containment glove just in case.� Don�t worry, I know what I�m doing.�

&nbsp;

She sealed her arm up in a shoulder length hazmat glove and
sat down at her desk.

&nbsp;

�Do you want some food?�
I can bring you back a sandwich?�

&nbsp;

�That�d be�great.� She tried, but she was just so tired.

&nbsp;

�Vicki, if I think your life is in danger for any reason,
I�m terminating this experiment, even if I have to go over your authority to do
it.�� His voice was concerned, and
adamant.� �I�ll get you a sandwich.�

&nbsp;

He left for a minute and returned with some food.� Vicki had a dazed expression on her face, but
the moment she saw the sandwich her eyes lit up.

&nbsp;

�Oh that looks delicious!� she smiled, licking her lips.

&nbsp;

�It�s just peanut butter and jelly.� He cocked his head in
confusion.

&nbsp;

�Still, I�m famished!� she yelped, and downed the snack in a
few bites.

&nbsp;

�You going to be alright for the rest of the day then?� he
asked.� �I have something I need to do
this afternoon.� But if you need me, you
have my cell phone number.�

&nbsp;

�I still want to continue observing this reaction on my
skin.� I�ll be here and let you know if
anything happens.� She said.

&nbsp;

Rick left, leaving Vicki by herself to observe her newfound �houseguest�, she was the host after all.� Despite her lightheadedness, she felt an
incredible urge to eat something.� She
wasn�t quite sure what to make of it.

&nbsp;

Her skin now seemed to tingle a bit on her forearm.� Observing the transparency of her hazmat
glove, she noted the black stuff was growing over the length of her
forearm.� Not really at a rapid rate, but
such that it appeared to be feeding off her.�
It didn�t hurt, as far as she was concerned, but it did feel
interesting, like some skin cream was massaging her arm.

&nbsp;

Something was wrong though�something she hadn�t anticipated.

&nbsp;

Her pulse was going up�as though she were about to have a
panic attack.

&nbsp;

She stood up and walked over to the main culture
container.� For some reason, being near
it calmed her nerves.� As
though one part of the symbiote were resonating with the other.� This didn�t last long however�her lungs began
to feel like they were getting tighter and she was having a
hard time breathing.

&nbsp;

She felt like she was on the verge of passing out.� Her arm flailed in a convulsive jerk as her
heart felt itself begin to stop.� She�d
accidentally knocked the big sample out of its containment unit.� The glass chamber around it broke with a
small crack.

&nbsp;

She was breathing heavily when she noticed that she�d
unconsciously stuck her whole exposed arm right in the symbiotic goo.� She tried to pull it out, but it stretched
and stuck itself like gum to her arm.

&nbsp;

She began to scream as the substance lithely crawled along
the surface of her arms and hands.� The
hazmat glove that she�d worn earlier was torn off in the struggle.� She tried to wash her hands off in the sink
nearby but stepped in something black and slippery and hit her head on the sink
and passed out.

&nbsp;

When she came to�her head was throbbing�but only for a
moment.� After a while the pain appeared
to subside.� Her stomach was growling for
food and her whole body felt tingly and itchy for some reason.

&nbsp;

She looked at her arms and hands�nothing out of the
ordinary?� What happened?� Her skin looked smooth and soft to the
touch.� Her fingernails glistened in the
industrial lab lights overhead.� She
couldn�t put her finger on it, but something had happened to her.� She walked over to a nearby mirror and heard
the crunch of glass at her feet.

&nbsp;

She�d stepped on the containment holder for the
symbiote.� And the symbiote itself was
nowhere to be found.� Something else she
also noticed; ribbons of torn clothing appeared to be lying in a large pile
beside her feet�like it had been eaten by acid or some corrosive
substance.� Yet the funny thing was�she
was wearing her lab coat, just as before.�
Even the hazmat glove that had covered her arm prior to whatever had
occurred was securely on her arm.� But
telltale signs of the real hazmat glove lie in tethers on the floor.

&nbsp;

�What is going on here�?� she spoke to herself.� Yet another thing she noticed was
different.� Her voice!� It seemed deeper, rounder�sexier?� She wasn�t quite sure what was going on.

&nbsp;

She decided to head to a nearby mirror to find out what was
going on.� Nothing appeared to be
different on the outside�but for some reason she was having trouble seeing very
well.

&nbsp;

Her glasses!� Her eyes
appeared to have somehow managed to get corrected and she could now see
perfectly out of them!� Not to mention
her face seemed to be a lot fuller and healthier than she�d ever dreamed
possible.

&nbsp;

Her suspicions were proven when she removed the hazmat glove
to find her arm had returned to normal�although that normal was more along the
lines of being smoother, silkier, and all around sexier than ever before.

&nbsp;

Curious, she began to check the rest of her body, first by
taking off her lab coat�only to find she was having trouble doing so.� Even her glasses seemed to be stuck to her
face.

&nbsp;

She struggled for a moment, but then everything on her skin
turned to a black liquid substance and in an instant morphed itself deep into
her skin.� In total embarrassment, she
now stood buck naked in front of the mirror.�
No glasses, just good ole Victoria.

&nbsp;

But this Victoria
she saw in the mirror was improved.� No
blemishes showed up anywhere on her skin, her eyes were perfect, her voice was
perfect, and her breasts and hips�was she seeing things?� They�d gotten bigger?� Even her hair was longer!� Her lips had the sexiest pout she�d ever
seen.

&nbsp;

She usually liked her hair short, but now it seemed as
though the longer style was very impressive on her.� Her blonde hair shimmered in the bright lab
light.� Out of curiosity she squeezed her
breasts together.� They felt soft and
sensitive to the touch, and most definitely hers, so she wasn�t dreaming.

&nbsp;

The problem then was that she was stark naked in front of a
lab mirror.� How was she going to explain
this to Rick?� What was she going to
wear?� If she�d only had her lab coat and
old outfit back and not torn to shreds she would have something to fall back
on.

&nbsp;

Just as she thought of her lab coat, her skin turned a
shimmering black and then took the shape and colors of her lab clothes, faster
than she could blink.� Her glasses were
now firmly back on her face, just as if she hadn�t experienced being naked in
front of a mirror.

&nbsp;

Something about her body wasn�t right, she finally
thought.� She walked over to a nearby
microscope and placed her arm underneath.�
She gasped in astonishment to find her entire skin cell structure had
changed dramatically.� Not only her skin,
but her very clothing appeared to have the exact same malleable cell structure
as the symbiote once had.

&nbsp;

�I don�t believe it�the symbiote is bonding with my body.�
Her thoughts were starting to drift back to food again, so she walked over to
her purse, hazmat glove still firmly on her arm and got some money for the
vending machine.� Ten dollars worth!

&nbsp;

She felt extremely famished for some reason, she suspected
it was the symbiote, but all her stomach could do was get
a bite to eat.� She couldn�t� think straight otherwise.

&nbsp;

Buying a lot of sugar-based snacks, she ate them all in
quick succession without so much as a hiccup.� Yet her stomach still seemed to be
complaining.� She had to get out and get
more food.

&nbsp;

�I can�t go out like this!� she said, somewhat embarrassed
by her lab coat and the hazmat glove.� It
would�ve been easier for her to go someplace without drawing suspicion if she
was in more civilian clothes.

&nbsp;

Less than the amount of time it took for her to blink, she
was now wearing a pair of khakis and a simple casual blouse, her
hair tied neatly in the back by a scrunchie.�
Her previous raiment nowhere to be seen, hazmat glove
gone.� To her discovery her
glasses were also missing, but she didn�t need them anyway.

&nbsp;

To her discovery, she was able to change her clothing
ensemble at will.� Just a thought of
various outfits and she would wear them.�
Armani, Prada, all the stuff she couldn�t
afford, she was now wearing!� She smiled
thoughtfully of this strange creature that had merged with her body.� She decided she wanted a large diamond ring
on her finger to keep the boys at bay, and sure enough, her hand produced what
her mind wished.

&nbsp;

�This isn�t just good skin care, this could be worth
millions!� she beamed.

&nbsp;

But of course she had still felt
incredibly hungry, and her body desired food above all else.� Heading over to a nearby restaurant, she
ordered the biggest entr�e she could find.

&nbsp;

It didn�t take long before she polished off the food, and
her stomach finally seemed to be content for the moment, but it was odd, as she
didn�t seem full at all from having eating all the courses.

&nbsp;

�The symbiote must be
feeding off my bio bio-energy, so I�m eating for two now, it seems.� She
thought.

&nbsp;

As an afterthought she ordered a double order of the food
she�d ordered and at that without a second thought, much to the surprise of the
chef, who didn�t think such a petite woman could eat so much!

&nbsp;

Before long her stomach was content and her body felt full
of energy, almost like it had some sort of lost renewed vigor.� She felt like she could run for ten miles and
not break out in a sweat.

&nbsp;

She decided to head back to her house, if only to
investigate the full extent of her fusion with the symbiotic creature.� She left a message on the lab�s answering
machine telling Rick what had happened and where she was.� She informed him she was okay for the moment,
and that it seemed as though the symbiote was improving her overall functions.

&nbsp;

Taking a shower, she noted how full and muscular her body
seemed to have become.� Not entirely
buff, but enough to seem toned and very attractive.� Her hips and waist were perfect for her size
and shape, and her breasts, although originally a B Cup, were now at least two
full sizes larger.� She enjoyed every
minute of looking at herself�and the fact she could change her clothing in an
instant with but a thought, made it all the more sweeter.

&nbsp;

Just to have fun she made the symbiote transform into
several costumes, from Marylyn Monroe, Nichole Kidman, Kristina Aguilera, and
all the other famous stars.� Even her
hair changed color and length to match her imagination.

&nbsp;

After a while she realized all the changing into different
outfits was turning her on!� Her sex was
feeling mighty hot, and it wasn�t long before she felt the urge to rub her
clit.

&nbsp;

Before she could do anything, however, the symbiote reacted
in a strange way.� The creature�s appearance
on her skin took the shape of shimmering smooth rubber of a deep oblique
black.� Her lips and all her body were of
the same surface, nothing but the shine of black.

&nbsp;

�I didn�t think my libido was into that sort of thing�well,
maybe I did, but I didn�t expect the symbiote to figure it out.� Oh well�might as well go all the way if I�m
going to enjoy myself.�

&nbsp;

Focusing her mind, she willed a pair of the tallest pair of
pony boots she could think up to conform to her feet, of the sort that forced
her to walk on her toes like ballet boots, but of a horse-like shape. A rock
hard corset appeared to tighten her waist in such a way as to make her breasts
jut out in large angry spheres.� Her hair
pulled itself into a long wisp of a tail, and much to her surprise, her hair
also appeared to instantly jut out of her butt like a true pony tail!� She could even swish it if she so desired.

&nbsp;

A large bridle appeared in her teeth, and her hands now had
a pair of hooves on them that extended all the way to the ground so that she
didn�t have to bend her knees to touch the floor, merely leaning forward on her
hands was enough.

&nbsp;

She was now fully transformed into a fully harnessed
pony-girl, and it pleased her so much as she shook her waist, her breasts
jiggled to and fro.� Her clit felt hot,
but because of the hooves on her hands, she was unable to touch them.� She also realized her weight was now
redistributed so that she was perpetually leaning forward on her feet, and she
would have to lean on her side if she wanted to sit down, just like a real
horse.

&nbsp;

For fun she began to strut throughout the house, her tail
swishing all the way.� It was so
wonderful a feeling to be able to be bound in such exquisite splendor.� Now if only she could find someone who could
dominate her!� Rick was her first choice,
but she wasn�t sure if he�d get into the idea.�
Plus the whole �symbiote might be dangerous� thing might get in the way
of her plans.

&nbsp;

She decided she�d had enough of her pony outfit and willed
her body to switch to something more comfortable.� The hooves on her hands were replaced by
normal rubber gloves again, conforming to every contour of her hands.� But her feet changed shape to that of the
tallest ballet boots she�d ever dreamed she could walk in!� A pair of nipple clamps appeared and pit deep
onto her areolas underneath the thick epidermis of rubber catsuit she
wore.� A rubber dress formed about her
black legs and hips that was so tight she was forced
to hobble, a single hole formed at the base of her pussy to expose it, although
it too was encased in a conforming layer of black rubber.� To top this off a posture collar formed at
the base of her neck, making it impossible for her rubber head to turn.� Her hair was released in shimmering strands
only to be encased in thick black rubber.�
To top off her new ensemble a double arm sleeve formed on her back and
made her arms fuse into a single socket behind her, in back prayer formation.

&nbsp;

Much to her surprise, her arms weren�t in pain whatsoever,
as if they�d automatically acclimated to the adjustment.� Her black rubber breasts were swelling
angrily outwards, and she only wished someone were there to see her, lying
helpless on the bed, squirming as her juices begged to be caressed.

&nbsp;

Her body desired stimulus, it desired to be fondled,
caressed, not to mention penetrated.�
Much to her surprise, the symbiote reacted with strange tendrils that
jutted out of the fetish suit she was now wearing.� They latched themselves over the tips of her
breasts and over the more sensitive parts of her vagina.

&nbsp;

In an instant she was writhing in pleasure as the tendrils
set to work.� Not only were they
massaging her, but the lower liquid creatures were penetrating her, just like a
real penis.� She began to moan softly,
but that moan turned into a wail, and soon she was panting and screaming all
the while�perturbed by the noise, it seemed, the creature forced her mouth to
seal itself shut, forcing her to breathe through her nose, and take in all the
exotic rubber smells.

&nbsp;

Her breasts felt like they were being fed upon, and her clit
felt so wet her legs couldn�t help but swing upwards in the air, hourglass
dress and all!

&nbsp;

After an hour or so of pure pleasure and indulgence,
breathing heavily, she stood up on her ballet boot heels and looked at herself
in the bedroom mirror.� Being head to
foot in a fully stimulated latex outfit was heavenly�more than she could have
ever expected.� And she had the symbiote
to thank for it.

&nbsp;

She felt exhausted, and most definitely needed sleep.� So she decided she would make a few
adjustments to the suit by freeing her hands a bit.� The hobble dress disappeared in favor of just
long legs of black latex, and her arms were freed for sleeping.� For some reason the symbiote continued to
stimulate her, much to her surprise.

&nbsp;

For now, she thought, she�d let the little creature have its
fun with her while she slept.� Rick would
be told in the morning about her �discovery�.

&nbsp;

The next day she woke up in the same black suit as the night
before, but something had changed for some reason. �She felt wet all over, which wasn�t
unexpected, but her body was still being stimulated.� Not to the point of pain, as the intensity
shifted from moment to moment, but she felt as though her body had gone through
more changes as she slept.

&nbsp;

Her breasts were now even bigger than before!� A full E cup!�
She couldn�t walk without feeling them sway, and her hips and waist
appeared to match the large hourglass figure she now had.� Her nipples felt extremely sensitive, even
more so than before, and she felt like she was leaking, in more ways than
one.� Her hips rocked with her every
movement and she felt herself thrust with every step, a forced orgasm with
every step she took.

&nbsp;

She concentrated on her appearance in the mirror.

&nbsp;

Her breasts were lactating!�
Not just normal lactation either, the milk was pouring out of her!�� Not only that but her hymen was pulsing with
juices, and her cum was whiter than usual.�
Though this seemed incredible, she found that because of the layer of
rubber on her skin, not a single drop of milk or cum spilled itself.

&nbsp;

It all disappeared into the blackness of the suit�as if the
creature was feeding off her!� Not just
drinking her milk, but her cum too.� The very essence of her sex.

&nbsp;

All her thoughts of what this meant were interrupted by a
phone call.� It was Rick.

&nbsp;

�I heard your message!�
Are you all right?� The creature
didn�t hurt you did it?� he asked, concerned.

&nbsp;

�On the contrary.� She licked her
rubber lips in the most tantalizing voice ever.�
�Rick�you need to get over here.�
I have a surprise for you.�

&nbsp;

�Uh�okay�I�ll be right over.� He didn�t know what to make of
what she was saying, but he wasn�t about to abandon his colleague to the throes
of science, so he hung up the phone.

&nbsp;

In a fit of ecstasy, she howled in laughter as the creature
busied itself and continued to feed off her.�
She could feel it trail deep into her innards and penetrate her, forcing
her to cum all the more.� Her breasts
felt a little sore, but she didn�t care, it felt good, and she looked good!

&nbsp;

�Derma-Dyne�you�re going to make a cool million off this
thing�� she sighed as the pleasure began to flow from her.� Her hips began to thrust and rock as the
creature bore deep into her uterus.

&nbsp;

It didn�t take long for Rick to arrive, and she was all too
eager to get started with him.� She heard
a knock at the door.� She began to swing
her hips heavily as the urge to have sex filled her every thought.

&nbsp;

Much to her surprise however, Rick was dressed from head to
foot in a large hazmat suit, complete with gasmask and some sort of nomex body
armor.

&nbsp;

�Now we�re the perfect couple,� she giggled
deliriously.� �You�re a man who�s wearing
rubber�and I�m a girl that has rubber wearing me.

&nbsp;

�I apologize for this, Miss Stanton, but when you told me
what happened, it left me little choice.�
I�m taking you back to the lab.�

&nbsp;

�Oh don�t be such a scaredy cat�I won�t bite�although my
pussy will�rowrr..� she
sounded drunk on her own juices.

&nbsp;

Taking some sort of small injection gun, he pressed it deep
into her neck, and soon she was out cold.

&nbsp;

�She�s been incapacitated, Mr. Chairman�I�m sorry I was too
late to stop the process�� he spoke into a radio on his wrist as he slung her
rubber body over his shoulder and into a nearby car.

&nbsp;

When she came to, she found herself floating in some sort of
large transparent tube filled with strange pink fluid.� She panicked at first but then realized the
fluid was already in her lungs, and relaxed a bit.� It seemed she wasn�t going anywhere.

&nbsp;

Rick walked into the room with a docket in his hand.� Standing beside him was none other than the
chairman of the board of Derma-Dyne himself!

&nbsp;

Vicki found she could still speak through the tube, although
it sounded like partial glubs and muffled somewhat.

&nbsp;

�Mr. Chairman!� her eyes went wide, she knew exactly what
that meant�she was either fired or worse!

&nbsp;

The chairman raised his hand to silence her, and turned to
Rick and nodded, he whispered something in Rick�s ear, to which Rick nodded
assent.� He meekly walked out of the
room.

&nbsp;

�What?� What�s going
on?� Am I in trouble?� she looked at Rick
pleadingly through the glass tube.

&nbsp;

�The Chairman thought I should be the one to tell you this, Victoria�but
I�ve got some good news and bad news��

&nbsp;

�What are you talking about?�
Let me out of here��

&nbsp;

�I�m afraid I can�t do that, Vicki�at
least not when I don�t know the full abilities of the symbiote that�s merged
with you.� You see�there are a few
things we need to discuss.�

&nbsp;

�Like what?�

&nbsp;

�First of all the good news�you�re keeping your job�despite
the fact you bypassed protocol and took the full sample into your nervous
system.�

&nbsp;

�But that was an accident!�
I only wanted to test part of the sample!�

&nbsp;

�We�re aware of that, Vicki, that�s why we didn�t charge you
with bioethics violation.�

&nbsp;

�What do you mean �we�?!�
I thought you and I were doing this together!�

&nbsp;

�The truth of the matter is, Vicki�there�s been a conspiracy
between myself, the DNA recombinant lab, and the president himself.� It all concerns you, Vicki.�

&nbsp;

�I don�t understand�you�ve been plotting against me??�

&nbsp;

�From the very start, it�s been known you were the only
employee at Derma-Dyne to not use the products that we manufacture here.� There�s a hidden employee clause that states
that �any employee working for this corporation will be willing and able to try
stable versions of our products, for the purpose of enhancing the science of
beauty.�� For a long time, the review
board considered firing you from your position, but because of your impeccable
work ethic, plus your irreplaceable job as head of the science lab here�we just
couldn�t let you go.�

&nbsp;

�So you orchestrated all this?� Just so I�d end up wearing the symbiote?� her
eyes glared at him, as though he�d lied to her ever since they�d met.

&nbsp;

�Not really�the intent was to pressure you to just try the
sample like you�d planned originally�the sample itself would�ve been harmless,
but we didn�t expect you to ultimately take the full specimen into your body.�

&nbsp;

She began to pound in futile frustration against the
tube�the symbiote also appeared to swell around her legs and try to squeeze out
of the glass, but it was all pointless, as the tube was incredibly thick, and
she had no purchase with which to make a dent.�
All she could do was sit there in the tube and float.

&nbsp;

�Something else we didn�t anticipate, Vicki�the symbiote�it�s
done more than merge with your skin.� Your
synapses, your thoughts�your sex drive�your heartbeat�it�s merged with
everything.� There�s no way to take it
off now�if ever.� But that�s not entirely
the bad news��

&nbsp;

�What?!?!?� You mean to tell me, that aside from being
stuck in this thing for the rest of my life, there�s more!?�� She wanted to scream at him�to throttle
him.� She noted her thoughts were being
projected as angry teeth and jaws snapping at him above her head from the
symbiote.

&nbsp;

�You�re aware of the fact the symbiote feeds off your body�s
energy�but there�s more to it�since you�re the host, as a symbiote it is
genetically programmed to adapt your bodily functions to suit its needs, not
only that but it is a self-replicating creature.�

&nbsp;

�What do you mean?�
What�s it doing to me?!�

&nbsp;

�From the first night you merged with it�your body�s been
changing, it�s forcing you to orgasm and lactate on a regular basis.� It�s also adjusting your hormones so that
your body is in a constant state of arousal.�
It literally feeds off your sexual bodily fluids as nourishment.� What this ultimately means is�it�s altering
your DNA so that you lactate and cum constantly�you�ll no longer be able to
control your body in that respect.� It
uses all the fluids you�re producing to reproduce itself
for the purpose of generating new life.�

&nbsp;

�I�m�.I�m going to die�aren�t I?�
she felt like sobbing.

&nbsp;

�No, Vicki, you�re not going to die�the symbiote won�t let
you, you see it�s developed photosynthesis inside your body�your body now acts
like a plant.� Water, light, and oxygen
are all you need to survive.� Your eating
habits will most likely cease to exist, as for bodily waste�well, the symbiote
eats that too.� But that�s not all��

&nbsp;

�Because the suit is adapting to your body�s libido...your
sex drive, it�s going through some changes to cause you to be more stimulated
to sex, not to mention your desire for the opposite gender will be increasing
several times that of a normal woman.�
It�s your outfit, Vicki�the symbiote has determined you derive most of
your pleasure from the latex skin on your body�and it won�t be long before
you�re stuck like that, at least until the mitosis phase.�

&nbsp;

�Mitosis phase?� she felt like she had no life now, but
Mitosis?

&nbsp;

�We�re not quite sure what that entails, but�we believe
you�ll be replicating the symbiote after a certain amount of time.� It will carry your DNA in it, and from
there�who knows��

&nbsp;

The first week Vicki spent the entire time in the tube�being
poked and prodded sexually by several scientists�which she found incredibly
stimulating much to her chagrin and frustration�she wanted to have sex with
everyone in a ten mile radius it seemed.�
Her sex was begging her, but the tube prevented it.� After the week had passed, they deemed she
was safe enough not to contaminate anyone else with the symbiote and was
allowed to go back to work again, on the minor condition she not try to fuck
every man she came across, which was hard to do considering.

&nbsp;

A few days passed after the second week, and sure enough, she
found herself having a hard time concentrating on anything due to the constant
climaxing and lactation she received from the creature.� Her �catsuit�, which not only covered every
inch of her skin, face, and exposed vagina included, forced her to permanently
walk in ballet heels while her now enormous breasts and hips swayed to and fro
as she walked down the halls of the lab, forced to forever wobble and clack
wherever she went, her blonde hair coming out the top of her rubber head in a
long tussle that reached down to the back of her thighs..� She took to at least wearing a lab coat over
her rubber skin to avoid catcalls and actually get some work done.

&nbsp;

The third week came, and she found herself unable to go to
the bathroom or eat regularly.� Instead
standing out in sunshine, or at least in front of a
specially designed solar radiator and taking long wet showers did the
trick.� The water made her black rubber
body glisten, which in turn turned her on all the
more.� The suit would regularly milk her
like she was a cow�licking all her external pleasure points and plunging itself
deep into her innards.� There were days
when she was unable to walk without thrusting her hips to compensate for the
fucking motion being forced inside of her.�
Her vagina and anus were now effectively closed and non-existent�meaning
she couldn�t relieve herself by having sex with anyone other than the symbiote.

&nbsp;

The fourth week came and went, and nothing out of the
ordinary happened, except one of the new lab assistants tried to get her to
suck his dick without anyone noticing�she of course complied, as that was the
only orifice left to her that the symbiote didn�t use�at least�until she
started to like sucking the young man�s penis.

&nbsp;

The next day, in short order, her mouth was sealed by rubber
in the shape of a large penis forcibly fused to her mouth like a gag.� She was no longer able to speak�and her mouth
was nonexistent.� It would periodically
fuck her mouth during the day, inserting some sort of warm liquid created to
simulate cum down her throat.� She took
to communicating with a docket she wrote on to the lab assistants,
despite her predicament she held a level head about it.� Her colleagues could tell when she was being
mouth-fucked because she would perform multiple gag or swallowing reflexes
during the day.� During this time she
began to cry as the process would always happen to her in cycles�the forced
suckling from her constantly lactating breasts which seemed to swell even
larger with every feeding�and then anal and vaginal penetration, making it seem
like not a single hole existed on her body.�


&nbsp;

On the fifth week�she took to crying every time her body got
turned on�and soon her eyes were turned into transparent black orbs so as to
absorb the tear ducts whenever she released herself in some fashion.� Even her hair was turned into a black long
tuft of rubber.� This symbiote wanted
every aspect of her for itself�and she was now entirely belonging to it.

&nbsp;

The sixth week�she came to work wearing the lab coat and
docket�her solid black catsuit with no holes as usual.� But this time she appeared to be carrying a
suit case of some kind with her.

&nbsp;

�Rick, please meet
with me over in the main lab.� I want to
show you what happens when science gets out of hand.� She wrote on her
docket and placed it on his desk.

&nbsp;

She sat at her own desk, alone, in the lab, the suitcase
sitting on the desk.

&nbsp;

Rick came in with a semi-concerned look on his face, and
noticed she was merely sitting at her desk, playing with her long lock of
rubber hair.

&nbsp;

�What�what is it you wanted to see me for?�

&nbsp;

She wrote on the docket.�
�I fell in love with you the day
you walked into this office�and I no longer blame you for what�s happened to
me.� I am a living fucktoy now�but a
fucktoy with no holes is a useless fucktoy, even if she�s a brilliant
scientist.� The symbiote has kept me all
for itself.�

&nbsp;

�Vicki�I didn�t know you felt that way about me.�

&nbsp;

She nodded, then continued to
write.� �I don�t want to live like this anymore�not in such a way as to never
be with you, to be able to touch you�I can�t live like that.� And so�I�m putting an end to it.�

&nbsp;

�What?� What are you
saying?�

&nbsp;

Before he could finish asking her, she opened the suitcase,
inside was pistol.

&nbsp;

She took the gun and pointed it at her head and closed her
eyes.

&nbsp;

�No!� You can�t do
this!� We�ll find a way to free you!� You don�t have to do this!�

&nbsp;

Before further protests could be made, she pulled the trigger, a loud bang rattled the lab.� The bullet went through her skull and out the
window in an instant.� Her head hit the
desk she sat at with a loud thud, and black goo came pouring out of it.

&nbsp;

�No�no�it can�t end like this!� Rick began to sob�he held
her dead body in his arms�

&nbsp;

Only to note her hands were twitching.

&nbsp;

The black goo began to clump and solidify while slowly
regathering itself back into the hole in her skull.� In minutes, her head had reformed back to its
black rubber shape and her eyes reopened�her body was instantly assaulted by a
punishing body-fuck by the symbiote, even her eyes appeared to be assaulted by
the forceful entry.

&nbsp;

�What�???� Rick�s eyes opened wide
in horror.

&nbsp;

Her eyes fluttered, as though waking from a dream, only to
reawaken into a nightmare.

&nbsp;

She scribbled fiercely into the docket.

&nbsp;

�I can�t die�it won�t
let me�I�ve tried everything.� I�m
nothing but a fucktoy now�and there�s nothing I can do.�

&nbsp;

�We have to find a way to get you out of that suit, Vicki�as
a scientist I can�t bear to watch you suffer!!� his eyes glared in
determination for her plight.

&nbsp;

�Who says I�m
suffering��� She began to laugh
hysterically and gurgle as her throat was being assaulted again.� �I�m a
fucktoy now�that�s all that matters�not my job�not you�not my life�Victoria
Stanton is dead now!!!� Fucktoy killed
her!!�

&nbsp;

In a fit of insanity, she squeezed and bounced her breasts
while forcing Rick down on the laboratory table with nothing but her monstrous
thighs�knocking aside several beakers�apparently the symbiote had given her
unnatural physical strength and soon she shoved her clit (what was left of it
that wasn�t being consumed by the symbiote) on top of Rick�s face and began to
bounce up and down on him, trying to get him to smell her, laughing and
gurgling on symbiote cum all the while, trying desperately to get some human
sex inside her.

&nbsp;

For a time she tried to smother him with her breasts, but he
somehow managed to inject her with a mild sedative, which knocked her out cold.

&nbsp;

Rick was left panting heavily, having lost the most
brilliant and beautiful colleague he�d ever had.

&nbsp;

Rick decided it would be best to place her back in the tube,
where she would at least pose little physical threat to anyone.� When she awoke, she began to gyrate, �thrust, and bounce
every inch of her body, dancing with tendrils of the symbiote in the fluid like
some kind of living lava lamp.

&nbsp;

All Rick could hear now was giggling, gurgling, mooing like
a horny cow, and insane laughter.� The
constant assault was too much for her mind to take.� He felt guilty for what had happened to
her�but for the time being, there was nothing that could be done.

&nbsp;

The next day he returned to the lab, only to find she�d
somehow flipped herself upside down and convinced the symbiote that the tips of
her ballet heels were a pair of penises she wanted to suck on�and soon enough
her legs were twisted in such a position so as to have the ballet boot heels
that were part of her feet, fuse themselves to what was left of her face,
forcing her to suck on her own heels while suspended upside down inside the
tube�tumbling the whole while in perpetual motion.� Her hands had fused themselves via the
symbiote to her clit and anus respectively, and thus she looked like a large
floating rubber ball mass.

&nbsp;

�Vicki�if you can hear me�I promise we�ll find a way to get
you out of that mess�� his voice fell on deaf orgy absorbed ears.

&nbsp;

After a few days it was apparent she wasn�t going to change
her fused position in the tube, and continued to tumble and rotate inside it
like some kind of rubber egg.� Also it
was noted her stomach was swelling, apparently the time for Mitosis was coming
soon, and what would happen next was anyone�s guess.

&nbsp;

Rick was now more determined than ever to free the
intellectual woman from the black creature trapping her in her sexual sensual
prison.� From sonic vibration bombardment
to electrical impulses, nothing could faze the creature.� After a while her stomach was swelling to the
point she appeared to be nine months pregnant with something, and he had
assumed the Mitosis process would kick in at any time now.

&nbsp;

The day finally came, and for some reason or other the suit
released Vicki�s arms and hands and she reverted into a fetal position and
simply floated in stasis.� She appeared
to be unconscious the entire time the process began.� Then her pulse began to quicken and she began
to, for lack of a better term, go through labor spasms.� 

&nbsp;

The whole process took place in the pink fluid, so there was
little else that could be done to comfort her during the process.� The symbiote had apparently forced her to
spread her legs wide and push.� And from
the looks of things, the labor process would be a simple procedure.

&nbsp;

After a few hours, something began to crown from within
Vicki�s body, and fell out just as soon as it appeared, leaving no trace of
umbilical chords or even any sort of blood.�
It was as though the symbiote had given birth instead of Vicki, although
it was apparent she�d done most of the work.

&nbsp;

The result was a perfectly round white sphere, not unlike
the original specimen, only different in color.�
This was apparently the symbiote�s offspring produced for the purpose of
passing on its genetic information.

&nbsp;

Within a few hours after the new symbiote was born, Rick
decided to extract it from the tank, to avoid complications, and place it in a
high-safety confinement unit.� This time,
made of a special polymorphic steel, to prevent
mishap.� Rick wasn�t sure what to make of
the little white sphere, except that it was growing in density and slowly
changing from a solid white to a dull grey, and then to the thick black color
he recalled the original symbiote had.�
Apparently that was its life cycle.

&nbsp;

But during this process of growth, much to Rick�s surprise,
not to mention the entire scientific community, the symbiotic suit that had
fused itself to Victoria Stanton�s body began to dissolve in the tank.� Like a black cloud of ink, it was apparent it
had utilized all of its combined energy and that of Vicki�s body to give birth
to its offspring.

&nbsp;

She awoke after several days, completely naked, but at the
same time feeling incredibly rejuvenated.�
Rick decided she was more than able to leave the stasis tank.� And as though they were lost lovers reunited,
Rick embraced Vicki with all the love he could muster.

&nbsp;

�Vicki�� he finally said, �I�m sorry we did this to you�I�m
really sorry you had to go through this.�
We couldn�t predict this was going to happen, and we could barely
predict you would be able to abandon the symbiote.�

&nbsp;

After a few moments of silence, she spoke, �What I went
through was initially for the sake of science, and although I lost my composure
after a while�it was just a matter of seeing the experiment to its conclusion.� I�m sorry I lost it, Rick.� I really am.�
Any woman would really, when faced with something like that.�

&nbsp;

Rick smiled his usual smile while placing a hot blanket on
her and a cup of hot coffee in her hands, which she gratefully accepted.

&nbsp;

�I don�t think anyone could�ve predicted that the suit�s
full intention was to pleasure your body to the point of driving you
crazy.� I�m just glad to have my
brilliant scientist back.�

&nbsp;

She corrected him, �That�s brilliant scientist girlfriend, buster, and don�t you forget
it.�

&nbsp;

He smiled abashedly, as he�d realized he�d fallen for her
just as she had him.

&nbsp;

The fact that she survived her own attempt at suicide was
miraculous enough, as the suit had protected her, but the simple fact remained,
her body was gorgeous.� Her skin was
silky smooth, her waist, hips, bust, and even thighs
cut an intimidating figure.� Her eyes had
perfect 20/20 vision, something no modern eye surgeon could ever produce.� Her body had reverted back to its normal
state of functionality, despite the DNA tampering from the symbiote, and she
was able to eat and drink again as she had in the past.� It even felt good just to go to the bathroom again,
she realized, and after everything was said and done, she felt human again.� They�d even given Vicki a physical with
X-Rays and no trace of the bullet entering her skull remained�as though she�d
never gone through with it.

&nbsp;

�Vicki�� Rick said, turning to her.� �Don�t ever
scare me like that again!�

&nbsp;

A week or so after the symbiote had freed her, Rick and
Vicki began to analyze the new specimen.�
It had the same morphing properties as the original, and most likely
would do the exact same thing it had done to Vicki, that the original had.� That was its life cycle, its expected
process, but the end result spoke for itself�body perfection that no plastic
surgeon could ever create�the ultimate make-over.

&nbsp;

Within the next couple of days it was obvious Vicki was
going steady with Rick, and they�d even had the greatest sex ever.� Rick even announced he was going to marry
Vicki.� But Vicki insisted upon a certain
stipulation, that should they marry, she expected nothing but perfection from
him, both intellectual and physical.

&nbsp;

�What do you mean?� I
love you and you love me?� What could
possibly be more perfect than that?�

&nbsp;

�You�re going to go through what I went through, lover, and
you�re going to enjoy it!�

&nbsp;

�Oh no�you don�t mean�� he sighed as he was handed a
familiar containment box.

&nbsp;

�Yes�I analyzed it earlier, and it works on males just as it
does females�you�re going to enjoy yourself.�
I even paid for this one this time�straight from the company with their
compliments of course.�

&nbsp;

�I don�t believe this�how can you possibly expect me to�?�

&nbsp;

She grinned a devilish smile, �You and the other members of
the board of trustees in the company tricked me into wearing that thing�think
of it as compensation for potential damages.�

&nbsp;

He began to stare at the box as though it were a sort of
almighty test of his fortitude.

&nbsp;

�Don�t worry�I�ll take good care of you�just like you did
me, Rick�you have my word.� She put her hand on his gently.� �And afterwards, we�ll be married�how can you
not pass this up?�

&nbsp;

Rick sighed, �Fine�but I want you to know I�m doing this for
you�and not because the company commissioned you to test it on a male
subject.� I read the briefing same as
you.�

&nbsp;

�The whole process takes five to seven weeks�you won�t have
to lift a finger.� She grinned.

&nbsp;

�You say that like you enjoyed yourself!� How can you possibly expect me to go through this!�

&nbsp;

She waved her finger at him, �Because I did enjoy myself�I
just have trouble dealing with stuff I like sometimes�and the end result is as
you see.� If anything you can think of
this as a commitment to science.�

&nbsp;

�All for science, huh...sheesh.�
Rick smiled at his absolutely stunning fianc�.

&nbsp;

He finally began to open the box.

&nbsp;

�It�s gonna be a long seven weeks��
Rick sighed.

&nbsp;

The
End?
