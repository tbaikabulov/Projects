Valentine's DayBy
BZBrian and Debra Valentine celebrated their' third wedding Anniversary on St.
Valentine's February 14th 2004. Brian had decided that this anniversary was
going to be really special, he had prepared for the memorable occasion for
nearly three anxious months. It was then, three months ago just after a very
forgettable Thanksgiving getaway that he had decided that their marriage needed
to take on a new direction.Brian and Debra were not your typical young married
couple (say mid twenties and fresh from college) celebrating a third
anniversary. Brian a debonair and athletic man was in his mid-thirties and a
much in demand Cardiologist at a major hospital. Debra an auburn haired
lithesome beauty was in her late twenties and already a partner in a growing
law firm. They had each established successful professional lives before
committing to that Valentine's Day wedding (with his last name when else) in
the Centennial year of 2001.Brian and Debra did pretty well financially, his
medical practice was doing extremely well and his brother (a stockbroker) had
steered him onto several very profitable business deals over the past years.
And Debra's legal practice was also doing quite well; they were in fact quite
well off. But, after all, money wasn't everything in a marriage; sure the two
incomes were great it just wasn't what he had envisioned his marriage being all
about. Brian often thought that Deb seemed too preoccupied with her work. Sure,
he conceded, on occasion he would get a call from a patient in the middle of
the night and have to run to the hospital, and yes maybe a few of those calls
had come at some inopportune times as concerned their love life, but on the
whole he was confident that he left his work at the office after business
hours.� Deb, by contrast, always seemed
to have a briefcase full of legal papers to mull over. The straw that wound up
breaking the Camel's Back, however, was that Thanksgiving weekend three months
earlier. They had spent Thanksgiving Day at a family gathering as they usually
did, but then the plan was for a nice romantic weekend, just the two of them
alone. Alas, those plans evolved from the romantic tryst he had envisioned into
a lonely three days of sitting alone by the pool or in the bar while Deb poured
over her legal papers up in their room the entire three days. She was very
apologetic on the way home, and explained that she'd had to have the brief done
first thing Monday morning. Her apologies, however, fell on deaf ears.As they
drove home two large billboards suddenly inspired Brian, one was for some local
jeweler who was promoting, &quot;Buy that special someone their gemstone for
their Anniversary&quot;. The other had something to do with training a
disobedient pet. And he wondered, &quot;Just what is the gemstone for a third
Anniversary?&quot;February 14th fell on a Sunday that year and Brian had the
whole day planned. He allowed Debra to sleep in. After waking sometime around
10:00 A.M., she showered then leisurely strolled into the kitchen. She found a
note on the coffee pot directing her to the Dining room.� The Dining room table had been romantically
set for two, their best china at each setting. Two dozen long stemmed red roses
and three elaborately wrapped presents stacked according to size awaited the
still sleepy-eye Debra. Brian pulled out her chair, &quot;First breakfast, then
presents.&quot; He pushed her chair up to the table as she sat, and then served
her breakfast, starting with a Mimosa and Eggs Benedict and followed up with
cappuccino and Cannoli.As they finished their cappuccinos Brian said; &quot;you
can open the presents if you like.&quot;Debra started with the small box on top
and carefully unwrapped it. It was, as she had guessed, a small jeweler's box.
The lids of her eyes opened wide in unison with the lid of the box as she espied
an elegant platinum ring with a lovely round vivid green stone that shone, with
just a glint of gold, up at her.&quot;It's beautiful Brian, is it an
Emerald?&quot;As he took the ring from the box and placed it on the ring finger
of her right hand he said. &quot;No dear, it's a Peridot, it's the gemstone
that represents a third anniversary.&quot;The next box was bigger and much
heavier, before opening it she guessed that it was probably chocolate; and she
was right, her favorites no less.She had no idea of the contents of the last
box it was bigger than the box of chocolates but weighed nearly nothing. She
opened it to find; &quot;nothing?&quot;It took her a moment or two to realize
that what she at first thought was packing tissue was actually a delicate set
of lingerie that consisted of just three items a pair of the sheerest red nylon
stockings she had ever seen, a matching garter-belt defined only by the
elastics and the snaps that would eventually hold up the stockings and a
matching chemise that defied definition as an article of clothing.&quot;So
Brian,&quot; she said with one raised eyebrow, &quot;you bought me something
for yourself as well.&quot;Brian was smiling like the Cheshire cat, but said
nothing.He started to clear away the table when the doorbell rang. &quot;That
ought to be the masseuse.&quot;&quot;A masseuse?&quot; &quot;Yes dear, she is
going to get rid of those nasty little muscle kinks you are always complaining
about.&quot;Brian answered the door and ushered in Helga a very large, but not
unattractive blonde (kind of a Norse Amazon and a credit to her Viking heritage).&quot;Vere
I set up table?&quot; Helga asked.&quot;Why don't you take Debra and the table
upstairs to the bedroom and set up in there.&quot; Brian suggested.After
setting up the stereo to play some of her favorite background music he gave the
headphones to Debra. Then as Debra relaxed on the massage table Brian whispered
something in Helga's ear and then left Debra and Helga to their business.About
thirty minutes later Helga came looking for Brian. &quot;You say let you if she
fall asleep, she is sleeping now.&quot;&quot;Good, good Helga, thank you. Would
you like anything, a cup of coffee or a glass of water perhaps?&quot;&quot;Ya,
ya I would like glass of water.&quot; Brian got Helga her water then went into
the bedroom changed the CD in the player and programmed it for continuous play.Helga
returned moments later, &quot;I go back to massage she feel real good when I
finish.&quot;Helga resumed massaging as Debra slept. After an hour or so Helga
returned to find Brian. &quot;I almost done mister. Okay.&quot;&quot;Thank you
Helga let me get those headphones out of your way then you can wake sleeping
beauty there.&quot;Helga finished the massage by giving Debra a loud and heavy
smack on her ass.Debra jolted awake. &quot;Whah, what happened? I feel like
I've been asleep for ages.&quot;&quot;Ja you sleep, but feel good now huh?&quot;&quot;Yes,
yes I do. I feel very good.&quot; Debra said as she stretched her lithe body.
&quot;Thank you Helga.&quot;Just then Brian popped his head in the door.
&quot;Well since you are feeling so good you better get ready. We can't be late
for our own anniversary party.&quot;Helga packed up her table. Brian paid her
for the massage, and then with a wink gave her a fifty-dollar tip. He then saw
her out.The party was a typical country club affair, friends and family met to
wish the couple happy returns and the like. As the evening drew to an end Brian
and Debra bid adieu to their guests and thanked their well-wishers, and then
headed for home.Once home again they both headed for the bedroom to change and
relax a while before going to bed.&quot;You know I'd really like to see you in
that outfit I gave you.&quot;&quot;Oh you would, would you?&quot;Yes, I
would.&quot;&quot;Well this has been such a wonderful day I guess you do
deserve a treat for all you have done.&quot; She picked up the box that
contained the lingerie and headed for the bathroom.While she was gone Brian slipped
out of his tux and pulled on a pair of comfy boxers he usually wore to bed.
Then he got out another box he hadn't bothered to wrap and placed it on the
bed. He removed a gold chain from the box, a crystal pendant dangled from the
chain.Debra returned from the bathroom, and she was truly a vision. The red
lingerie was so sheer that as it mingle with the warm tones of her flesh it
seemed as though she glowed, like an ember about to extinguish. Providing just
enough of a reddish glow to blend well with her auburn hair that it accented
the sparkling green stone of her new ring.As she approached Brian held up the
chain with the crystal pendant.&quot;Well Brian how do I lo...&quot;Debra stood
transfixed her eyes fixed upon the swinging crystal being held by her
husband.&quot;You look fantastic my pet, you look just like a pretty little sex
slave should.&quot;Panic stricken but still as rigid as a statue. Debra's mind
revolted &quot;SEX SLAVE, did he say SEX SLAVE? No, no way I am no ones sex
slave, not even yours Brian.&quot; This frantic outburst, unfortunately, was
heard only be by the transfixed victim herself. As it rattled mutely around in
her brain, since she remained silently fixated on the slowly swaying
crystal.&quot;You know Deb I not only found out that the Peridot was the
official gemstone to denote a 3rd anniversary I also discovered that the
contemporary gift for the 3rd anniversary is crystal and glass. Perhaps you
noticed that a lot the gifts we received tonight were stemware and included a
couple of very nice pieces of Waterford Crystal.&quot;&quot;So, you might say,
this little crystal I hold is an anniversary gift I reserved for myself.&quot;
&quot;I do hope you enjoyed all of your little treats this morning; they were
designed specifically to put you at ease. The Mimosa and coffee were lightly
laced with a sleeping drug and your massage simply aided in the inevitable.
Then once Helga let me know that you had dozed off I changed your music CD for
one that I had made especially for you.&quot; &quot;The CD drew you into a deep
Hypnotic sleep; which intern permitted your present entranced state. You see
you were conditioned during your massage to respond to the crystal as a trigger
that would return you to your current Hypnotic state. When I had Helga slap
your rump to wake you all of the triggers from my CD where permanently imprinted
on your brain.&quot;&quot;Now my little pet drop to knees and crawl to your
master.&quot;Debra was repulsed. &quot;How had this happened? What did I do to
deserve this? This can't be. No, I won't crawl to anyone.&quot; But as she
silently dropped to knees, and then slowly crawled over to Brian she continued
to think, &quot;But, but I have to, I can't stop myself.&quot;&quot;Good girl
Deb, set,&quot; Brian said. Still holding the crystal before her he then with
his free hand began to pet her head as he would a dog. This allowed him to put
the crystal down since the petting was another trigger that would continue to
deepen her trance.&quot;Open that pretty little mouth for me Deb&quot;The next
thing Deb knew Brian was exploring the inside of mouth with two of his fingers,
&quot;Good girl, now suck.&quot;As Debra sucked diligently on his two fingers
Brian's excited member was gradually coming to attention, forcing its way
through the opening in his boxer shorts.&quot;Very nice Deb now allow me to
introduce the star of the show,&quot; as he directed her attention to the shaft
that now protruded from his boxers. &quot;Put your hands around it
Deb.&quot;Her hands encircled his cock.&quot;Stroke it Deb, gently until it is
fully erect.&quot;As Deb worked his cock like a pump she was thinking.
&quot;No, no, no. He is not going to make me do this; he knows how much I hate
it. Then she thought, yes, he knows how much I hate this. Oh, my
god!&quot;&quot;Good girl, very good Deb. Now lick around the surface of the
head.&quot;Her tongue darted out and started licking the tip of his
cock.&quot;Good girl, now lick the entire shaft Deb.&quot;Debra's tongue moved
smoothly up and down Brian's cock.&quot;Now, take it into your mouth, just the
head at first. Good girl, now swirl your tongue around it. That's a good girl
Deb. Now slow down and suck.&quot;Debra couldn't believe it. She was performing
an act that she absolutely abhorred, but she couldn't stop and neither could
she deny the feelings of her excited nipples nor the gradual wetness that
slowly trickled down her inner thigh.Brian had wanted this for a long time, and
then suddenly he felt the impending explosion that he could not control.
Vesuvius suddenly erupted in Deb's mouth. &quot;Good girl, swallow it all, then
lick me clean.&quot; As Deb continued to suck away his cock eventually grew
flaccid and finally he sat back exhausted for the time being.Brian had waited
three long years to experience that again, he was certain that it would not be
that long before he experienced it again.&quot;You've been a very good girl Deb
(the positive reinforcements also served to deepen Deb's trance). Now Deb, do
you remember, that I told you crystal and glass were the contemporary gifts for
the 3rd anniversary, well guess what the traditional gift is.&quot; He said as
held up a leather dog collar, &quot;yes Deb, it is leather.&quot; &quot;This
leather collar is very special, it is your talisman. It works like this Deb, as
long as the collar is around your neck you are capable of functioning like your
old self, you can go to work, you can go out in public and no one will suspect
you are my slave. But if the collar is removed you will become a mindless robotic
slave capable only of obeying direct commands from your master and only your
master. Do you understand Deb?&quot;&quot;Yes, Brian.&quot;&quot;Now my pet
kisses the collar I hold before.&quot; Debra kissed the collar and sealed her
fate. &quot;Good girl, your kiss means you accept the powers of the
talisman.&quot; And then he placed the collar around her neck.He then encased
her wrists and ankles in matching leather cuffs. &quot;These additional leather
ornaments are mere symbols of your status as a slave, they are not talismans and
do not have the same power as your collar.The last item removed from the box
was a leash, which he now attached to her collar. He then commanded: &quot;Heel
Deb&quot; He gave a tug on the leash and she followed on her hand sand knees as
his lead led her across the room to his walk-in closet. In the corner of the
closet stood a steel dog cage. Brian led her to the cage and ordered her
inside.Once in the cage he removed the leash and order her lay down. &quot;Good
girl, now listen and repeat after me, I am Slave Deb.&quot;She repeated.
&quot;I am Slave Deb.&quot;&quot;Brian is my Master.&quot;She echoed.
&quot;Brian is my Master.And the exchange continued.&quot;Slave Deb must obey
Master.&quot;&quot;Slave Dem must obey Master.&quot;&quot;Slave Deb lives to
please Master.&quot;&quot;Slave Deb lives to please Master.&quot;&quot;Master
speaks and Slave Deb must obey.&quot;&quot;Master speaks and Slave Deb must
obey.&quot;Until finally Brian said: &quot;Good girl Slave Deb, now listen
only. Do you remember the phases that you just repeated to me?&quot;&quot;Yes,
master.&quot;Brian smiled, that's the first time she had called me master.
&quot;Repeat them for master.&quot;&quot;I am Slave Deb. Brian is my Master.
Slave Deb must obey Master. Slave Deb lives to please Master. Master speaks and
Slave Deb must obey.&quot;&quot;Good Girl. Now Slave Deb those phrases are a
mantra, and you must repeat your mantra over and over again. When I say 'good
night Slave' you will begin to chant your mantra. After thirty minutes you will
fall into a deep natural sleep, but even in sleep you will continue your
mantra, your dreams will be filled with images of being a good and obedient
slave, obeying only her master, and your mantra will echo in your mind through
out the night. You will sleep until your master says 'wake slave'. Do you
understand Slave Deb?&quot;&quot;Yes, master.&quot;Brian closed and locked the
cage door. Then said, &quot;good night slave.&quot; He turned the closet light
out and went to bed.He could hear Debra from the closet. &quot;I am Slave Deb.
Brian is my Master. Slave Deb must obey Master. Slave Deb lives to please
Master. Master speaks and Slave Deb must obey. I am Slave Deb. Brian is my Master.
Slave Deb must obey Master. Slave Deb lives to please Master. Master speaks and
Slave Deb must obey. I am Slave Deb. Brian is my Master. Slave Deb must obey
Master. Slave Deb lives to please Master. Master speaks and Slave Deb must
obey...&quot;After thirty minutes he could still hear her droning on but it had
become much softer like some one talking in a whisper.Brian woke early the next
morning, he showered and dressed for work then he went into the closet. Deb was
still mumbling very softly &quot;I am Slave Deb. Brian is my Master. Slave Deb
must obey Master. Slave Deb lives to please Master. Master speaks and Slave Deb
must obey.&quot;&quot;Wake Slave.&quot;Debs eyes fluttered open.Brian opened
the cage, attached the leash and led her out into the bedroom.&quot;Hi there,
what's your name?&quot;Slave Deb.&quot; Came the monotone.&quot;What does Slave
Deb do?&quot;&quot;Slave Deb must obey Master.&quot;&quot;Who is
master?&quot;&quot;Brian is master, you are Master.&quot;&quot;Good
girl.&quot;&quot;Do you remember who you were before you became Slave
Deb?&quot;&quot;Yes, I used to be Debra Valentine.&quot;&quot;What did Debra
Valentine do?&quot;&quot;She was your wife master, and an attorney at
law.&quot;&quot;Good girl. What is that around your neck.&quot;&quot;My collar
master.&quot;&quot;And?&quot;It is my talisman.&quot;&quot;What does it
do?&quot;&quot;It allows me to function like Debra Valentine.&quot;&quot;Are
you Debra Valentine?&quot;&quot;No master.&quot;&quot;Who are you?&quot;&quot;I
am Slave Deb.&quot;&quot;What would happen if your collar were removed from
your neck?&quot;&quot;I would become a mindless robotic slave, that could only
function from direct orders from my master.&quot;He reached around and
unfastened the collar. Slave Deb's eyes closed and she became as rigid as a
statue. He replaced the collar and her eyes open and her muscles
relaxed.&quot;Good girl.&quot; He said as he patted her head. &quot;You may
stand slave. Remove your wrist and ankle cuffs then go to the bathroom and
clean up.&quot;As she stepped from the shower Brian was there waiting for her,
he gave her a towel and allowed her dry off then he attached the leash to her
collar and led her to her walk-in closet. &quot;HMMM. Lets see panties? No I
don't think so, not any more. Bra? No, no, nope not that neither. Ah,
pantyhose? Nope, no, no, no definitely not those. Ah I just remembered I have
another little package for you. Wait right here I'll just go and get
it.&quot;Brian was enjoying himself even if Deb didn't seem to get the joke.&quot;Here
we go,&quot; he handed her a black garter-belt, black nylons with seams down
the back and black patent leather pumps with five inch heels. &quot;Put these
on.&quot;Slave Deb did as her master ordered.&quot;Now lets see, ah this looks
nice,&quot; he picked out a grey business suit that had both pants and a skirt.
He threw the pants in the trashcan and handed her the skirt. He held onto the
jacket and continued to look through her wardrobe. &quot;Ah, here we go,&quot;
he'd found a white cashmere sweater with a turtleneck collar. He handed the
sweater and jacket to her and ordered her to finish dressing.&quot;Good girl,
Ooops, missed that.&quot; He reached under her sweater and unhooked the leash
from her collar.&quot;Okay, here is today's agenda, you will go to work at the
law office and function as Debra Valentine, you can no longer drive so I will
drop you off and pick you up. You must be ready to leave when I arrive. If you
are doing something you will stop as soon as you hear me and only me say 'Deb,
time to go.' While we are in the car you will chant your mantra unless I tell
you to stop. Do you understand Slave Deb?&quot;&quot;Yes, master.&quot;Brian
drove up to the front of Debra's office building and said: &quot;Slave Deb on
the count of three I will snap my fingers and you will be able to function as
Debra Valentine. ONE, TWO, THREE, snap. Have a good day Debra see you around
five.&quot;&quot;Bye, Brian see you then.&quot;At around 5:15 Brian arrived at
her office. She was on the phone with a client. He looked as his watch and
pointed at it to her, she shrugged and remained on the phone. &quot;Time to go
Deb.&quot; She hung up the phones instantly packed up her brief case and they
were gone. On the way out she told her secretary that if Mr. Johnson called to
tell him that something unexpected came up and she'd get back to him in the
morning.Once in the car Brian said, &quot;good girl Slave Deb&quot; and Slave
Deb said, &quot;I am Slave Deb. Brian is my Master. Slave Deb must obey Master.
Slave Deb lives to please Master. Master speaks and Slave Deb must
obey.&quot;Brian had his Cheshire cat smile all the way home. He realized she
still had a lot to learn, that Slave Deb was a work in progress, and they
probably needed to shop for some new clothing. But the first thing he did once
in the car was take the brief case from her hands and toss it on the back seat.
&quot;No need for that thing to ever enter into my house again, it'll be right
there in the morning when Debra Valentine returns to her office.&quot; Right
now though, he intended to get to know Slave Deb a whole lot
better.EPILOUGUEWith the passage of another three years Brian has managed to
work out all of the kinks in his Slave Deb.The transition from Slave Deb to
Debra Valentine has become flawless. All that is required is to identify
costume to role. And Brian gets a real kick out of dressing his life-sized
Barbie Doll.Debra Valentines is still a productive partner in the Law Firm of
Simpson, Lowell, Addison, Valentine and Evers. And she manages to get all of
her work done at the office. Early on, the other partners seriously considered
buying Debra out of the partnership after several untimely hang-ups on clients.
But things worked out for the better as Brian, for his part, developed a new
sense of patience.Slave Deb has experienced many new things Debra Valentine
would have never even considered, but then she has no say in the matter. She
doesn't spend much time in her cage these days either, only when Brian has to
go out of town and can't take her with him, or when he just feels too tired to
do anything but look at his sexy little pet locked away for the night, then
again he doesn't really need an excuse. Now does he?THE END 12
