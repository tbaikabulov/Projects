Blake looked up from the sofa he was sitting on. He was a
good-looking young man. He was slender but muscular was visible on his lean
frame. He was 6�3�� and 170 pounds. Not a big man at all.� He had dark brown hair with a reddish tint to
it and was fairly dark complected for a Caucasian. He thought about the meeting
he had with one of his �partners in crime� coming up in about an hour. He
smiled as he thought about where his life had taken him. He had grown up being
raised by his aunt and severely abused by her husband. Instead of destroying
him it had made him stronger and eventually his step-uncle had introduced him
to the drug business. Blake was very successful and had made millions. He was
part of a network of dealers that worked from Columbia into the states and
involved massive amounts of drugs and money. Blake was only 19 but he had
enough money to be set for life if he chose to �retire�. He smiled. It wasn�t
even about the money anymore; it was about an incredibly exciting lifestyle. He
had thought of a way to make it even more exciting. The man he was to meet in
an hour, Byron, had lost a lot of money on a deal. Blake was capable of
protecting him from those he owed the money, but only for a special price. The
man had a sister, an incredibly beautiful sister. Blake had met her before, but
of course he had met her as only a friend of her brother. She had no idea what
her brother was involved in. Her name was Arial and Blake had been infatuated
with her since he met her. Currently Blake was living in a cabin in the
mountains in Colorado. This was only one of his homes but it was the closest to
the associate he wanted to see today. There was a knock at the door, Byron must
be here early. Blake looked out the window briefly just to be sure it was Byron
and that he had come alone and then he answered the door.

&nbsp;

�Hey man, how�s it going? Come in.� Blake smiled
sardonically. 

&nbsp;

�I think you know how it�s going. I need help very badly.�
Byron was nearly in tears out of sheer desperation. He knew he was in trouble. 

&nbsp;

Blake looked at him and decided to get right to the point.
�I know what kind of trouble you are in and I�m quite willing to help you, but
here is the deal. I want your sister for 2 years and I�ll pay all your debts.
That�s it and it�s all I�m going to offer.�

&nbsp;

Byron looked shock. �What do you mean you want my sister? I
don�t understand. What do you want her for?�

&nbsp;

Blake explained. �I want her to live with me, not here but
somewhere I have a place that�s even more secluded. I get to do whatever I
please to her. She is mine to do whatever I want with for 2 years. I know your
sister loves you and I know she is a very sweet girl. Why don�t you ask her how
she feels? I know she wants to help you and I promise that I won�t cause her
any permanent harm.�

&nbsp;

Byron nearly exploded with rage. �How can you ask me that?
You�re sick. My sister will never be involved in this. I won�t call her, I
won�t do anything. The answer is no.�

&nbsp;

Blake picked up a cell phone and began dialing a number. He
was calling Arial himself. He told her to come up to his cabin and visit with
him and Byron. She was 16 and had just acquired her license so she was excited
to drive to the cabin. Byron and Blake waited. 

&nbsp;

Arial arrived and walked up to the cabin. She was a tiny
girl, 5�1� and only 90 pounds. She had green eyes and blond hair with
strawberry blond highlights. She was wearing a white sundress and looked
stunning. Blake greeted her at the door, brought her inside and explained the
situation in detail. He didn�t exaggerate but he told her exactly how much
trouble her brother was in and how unpredictable the people he owed money to
were. He spent a lot of time filling her in on what her brother had been up to.
Arial sat and listened with tears streaming down her face but as soon as Blake
had finished she immediately agreed. She was a very sweet girl and loved her
brother. She would go through anything to help him. Byron was also in tears and
tried to talk her out of it but she wouldn�t hear of it. She was terrified but
she was also determined to do it. Finally Byron left and Arial was left at the
cabin with Blake. 

&nbsp;

Blake walked over to her and cupped her chin in his hand. He
had a half smile on his face as he looked at her. �I�ve wanted you since the
day I met you. Now I have you. There are hardly any words to describe how
wonderful I feel right now. I want to make something perfectly clear though.
For the next 2 years, I own you. I can and will do whatever I please to you. I
expect you to cooperate because you agreed to this. If you fight with me too
much I will just call off the deal and your brother will be on his own. I don�t
expect complete cooperation, I understand it will be hard for you to cooperate
with someone who will be hurting you as badly as I plan, but don�t try to
escape and don�t try to fight with me. You�ll lose. If you really decide you
can�t stand it, tell me and I will send you home and your brother can deal with
his own problems.�.

&nbsp;

Arial was trembling with fear and still crying from being so
upset. She was stunned that her brother had been involved in the kind of
activities described to her. She was an extremely innocent girl and Byron had
done an excellent job of hiding what he did from her family. She remembered
when she had met Blake before, he had seemed like such a gentleman. She had
even thought he was good looking and had looked forward to when he visited. She
really didn�t know what to expect from the 2-year arrangement she had just made
but she knew it couldn�t possibly be good. She expected he was going to hurt
her very badly. She looked at him through tear filled eyes, took a deep breath
and began to talk. �I have to help Byron. I am scared to death but I won�t try
to fight you or escape. You�ve just told me that all I have to do is tell you I
want out, but I won�t do that. I can�t leave Byron at the hands of those awful
people. I�ll go with you and do what you want.�

&nbsp;

Blake felt his hard on forming. Looking at the girl crying
in front of him and thinking about how sweet the next 2 years with her would be
was almost too much for him. He had no intention of taking her virginity yet
though. That was something special and was going to wait. He was however going
to get started on some other things. He took her hand and led her to the
bedroom. �Ok Arial, I�m going to beat you. I don�t have much here because this
was rather spur of the moment so I�m going to use my belt. Take off all your
clothes and bend over the footboard of the bed.�

&nbsp;

Arial took a deep breath. She couldn�t believe what was
happening. She slowly removed her dress. Blake watched all the while. She was
moving too slowly so he came to her and removed her bra and pulled down her
panties. She stepped out of them and walked over to the bed. She took another
deep breath and leaned over it. Blake moved up behind her. She was so small; it
made him think how helpless she was and that thought aroused him immensely. She
had small breasts, only a b-cup but they were round and pert. Her whole body
was slim but her hips curved gently. Her stomach was completely flat. �Lean
forward more and spread your legs apart.� She complied, sobbing in earnest now.
She heard him remove his belt and he stood behind her now. �I�m going to start.
I�m going to give you 15 strokes. If you get up or move from that position, the
stroke I�m on doesn�t count and you get an extra. I just want you to know now I
endured a lot of punishment when I was growing up so I know what people can
take. Get ready.� Wit that he took a step backward and brought the belt down
across her ass. She cried out in pain and clasped her hands to her behind. �Not
good enough dear, that stroke doesn�t count. You�re also up to 16 strokes. Move
your hands and lean forward again.�

&nbsp;

He brought the belt down on her backside again. She screamed
again but stayed in place. He let the belt fall again, up to 6 strokes before
she couldn�t take anymore and tried to shield herself with her hands crying out
�It hurts!�.

&nbsp;

�Of course it hurts. It�s supposed to and it�s going to get
worse. Move your hands. Blake walked to her and rubbed his hands along her hot
cheeks. He had never had an opportunity like this before and was enjoying every
minute of it. When she moved her hands he took a step back and gave her the
hardest stroke yet. Her back arched and she screamed but stayed in place. He
continued to give her the rest of the strokes in that manner, taking a step
back and hitting her hard. 

&nbsp;

Arial endured the beating by grasping the bed covers as hard
as she could and holding on for dear life. She sobbed quietly after the beating
was over waiting for him to tell her she could get up. He ran his hands all
over her body as she lay there and leaned up and kissed her neck softly. Then
he laughed. His laughter chilled her blood because it made it abundantly clear
how much he enjoyed what he had just done. 

&nbsp;

Blake straightened up and lifted her from the bed by the
waist. �Come along dear. That�s it for right now. I�ll have a place better
prepared but we have to leave now. You won�t need to take anything; I�ll take
care of it. I have to make some phone calls and get things set up. I think I�ll
get online and order lots of toys to play with. I�m sure I can find some out of
the way places where I can get some objects that are discipline only. This is
the last chance to change your mind before we leave. What do you think?�

&nbsp;

Arial cried softly but said she was still going. Blake
picked her clothes up but didn�t offer them to her. He looked at her for a
moment then left the room. He came back with 2 clothespins. �Come over here. I
don�t think I need to explain what these are for.� He attached them to each of
her nipples. She stiffened in pain but was silent. He ordered her to leave them
on and go sit on the bed. She went to the bed and softly massaged her nipples
with the clothespins still attached. She knew better than to take them off. She
cried and wondered what he would do next and when he was going to rape her. 

&nbsp;

Blake walked outside and went out to an old barn out back.
He was done with his calls and had made quite a few arrangements. He had a
plane ticket lined up and they were leaving that night. He wanted to have some
fun first though and he was searching for something to spice things up. He
rummaged around and found some rope and an old leather strap. He snapped it a
few times and decided it would work quite nicely. He went back inside carrying
the things he found into the bedroom. Arial looked up as he walked in and an
expression of shock and fear covered her face. �Get back on the bed. Lie on
your stomach. He pulled out a knife and cut the rope into manageable pieces and
quickly tied her wrists and ankles to the posts. Then he walked behind her. �I
want you to think for a minute. I haven�t decided how many times I�m going to
hit you yet but think about how badly this strap will hurt.� Then he stepped
back and struck her. �Aaahhh�, she screamed and jerked on the bed. He looked at
her ass which was bruised and a dark red from the belt. The welt the strap had
left was already showing up. He struck her 10 more times in quick succession.
He was breathing heavily and hitting her hard. Arial continued to scream and
vomited from the pain. He watched her and smiled. Then he resumed the beating.
He grabbed a pillow and placed it under her to get her ass up where he wanted
then worked over her entire behind. He tried to get every inch but he realized
he was going to have to stop before she passed out. She had vomited everything
in her stomach and was dry heaving and jerking in the ropes that bound her. She
was pleading with him in between cries of pain, �Stop it please, it hurts it
hurts�Stop!�

&nbsp;

Blake looked at his handiwork. Her ass was covered in welts
and bruises. She was bleeding in spots. He untied her and took her into the
shower. She wasn�t standing well on her own so he held her. He set her down on
the toilet while he undressed too and then took her into the shower. She
writhed in his arms but didn�t fight him. He cleaned her gently and gave her a
big soft towel when they got out. Arial didn�t look at him but looked at the
floor, still crying in bursts. She was in so much pain she didn�t know how to
handle it. Blake picked her up and carried her into the bedroom.

&nbsp;

Arial was terrified. She was hurting badly and was certain
that now he was going to rape her. She was too scared to even ask what he was
doing but was very surprised when he told her to get dressed because they were
leaving. She looked at him in shock and he smiled. �Believe me dearheart, that
was very mild. We have to get on a plane tonight and when we get to Arizona,
I�m really going to enjoy myself. Put your clothes on and get ready.� 

&nbsp;

Arial got dressed and walked out the door with him. She
wanted so much to run and get away from him and from the hell she knew was
waiting but she couldn�t. Her brother would pay for it if she did.
