Synopsis: Jean confronts her past.Jean's Past 
 I'm kneeling at the door hands clasped behind my back, eyes
  cast down just the way Master expects me to be when he gets home. 
 As soon as Master walks in the door, I could tell that something
  was on his mind. Normally when Master comes home he greets me tenderly, but
  today he just impatiently ordered, �Follow.� Starting to get worried, I follow
  with a shaky �Yes Master.� 
 I follow him into our bedroom where he has me kneel at the
  foot of the bed. With me kneeling obediently, he walks out of the room. A few
  minutes later, he comes back into the room with a box. I just stare at him
  like an idiot as he hands me the box. Sweetly he reaches down and guides me
  to my feet as he says, �Go ahead and open it, my sweet.� 
 Carefully I place the box on the bed and remove the lid.
  Inside the box, I see the most beautiful black dress of my life. Looking up
  from the dress, I start crying. 
 Surprised by my reaction he asked, �Sweetie is there something
  wrong?� 
 Sniffling I stutter, �N-no M-master, it's just the most beautiful
  dress I've ever seen.� 
 Smiling he hugs me and wipes away my tears saying, �It would
  look even better on you sweetie. Now go get dressed while I change.� 
 Not wanting to damage the dress I slowly pull the dress on.
  It's a short black dress with a low-neck like showing off my full breasts.
  Next I pull on my stockings and slip on my black high heels. Once I'm finished
  getting dressed I sit on the edge of the bed to wait for Master not wanting
  to wrinkle my dress. 
 My breath catches as I watch him walk out of the bathroom.
  He was so handsome dressed in a black silk shirt and black slacks. Giving me
  a kiss he says, �You look very beautiful, sweetie. I want you to put your hair
  up in a bun tonight I don't want it getting in your face.� Without hesitation
  I put my hair up into a bun. 
 After putting my hair up we head to the car and I tentatively
  ask, �Where are we going, Master?� 
 Helping me into the car he said, �It's a surprise my sweet.� 
 Knowing that any more questions about where we are going
  would only make him mad at me so I figured it would be safer to talk about
  his day. So I asked, �How was your day Master?� 
 �It was good, but the best part was buying that dress for
  you.� 
 �If your day was good then, why did you look upset when you
  got home today Master?� 
 �Because I wanted everything about tonight to be a surprise
  and if I walked in with a huge grin on my face you would've guessed that I
  had something special for you. Now enough about my day, have you talked to
  your parents recently?� 
 Looking out my window I say, �I haven't talked with my mother,
  but I have talked to my dad.� 
 �And why haven't you talked with her?� he asked me sternly. 
 �Because the last time we talked was when I told her that
  I was moving in with you and she blew a gasket.� 
 Glancing at me he said, �You mean she still doesn't know
  that we're married?� 
 �No Master she doesn't know that we're married.� as I say
  this I can tell that he wasn't happy with my answer. 
 Suppressing his anger he says, �Don't wait till it's too
  late to talk to her again Jean.� 
 Clenching my teeth I say, �I don't care if I ever talk to
  her again.� 
 I could tell I went too far because he pulled over and grabbed
  me by the arm and said, �Don't ever say that. One of these days you're going
  to want to talk to her about something and for one reason or another she won't
  be there to talk to.� 
 Looking back out the window I don't say anything not wanting
  to admit that he's right. Knowing that I was going to be stubborn and say nothing
  he tightens his grip on my arm and orders, �Look at me.� 
 Turning to look at him I can see disappointment in his eyes
  at my stubbornness. Seeing his disappointment made swallow my pride and admit
  that I will one day regret talking to her now. So I say, �Your right Master.
  I shouldn't wait till it's too late to talk to my mother again.� 
 Releasing my arm he smiles and says, �Now that wasn't so
  difficult was it?� 
 Shaking my head I say, �No Master.� 
 Kissing me passionately he pulls back into traffic. Five
  minutes later we arrive at his intended destination. As he pulls into the drive
  way I recognize where were at. 
 Turning to look at Master I tentatively ask, �We're going
  to Doris's place?� 
 Grinning boyishly he says, �Yes, Doris and I have been planning
  this night for you for the last few weeks.� Hearing this I practically jump
  into his lap as I kiss him. He knows that I love spending time with Doris.
  She always knows how to brighten my day. 
 As we walk to the door I can't keep my excitement contained
  and I gently skip all the way to the door. Master rang the bell and as we wait
  for the door to be answered he lightly puts a hand on my shoulder to settle
  me down. When the door opened I got quite a shock. Standing in front of us
  was a naked woman. 
 In a soft voice the woman says, �Mistress Doris is in her
  study.� 
 Walking to her study I shake my head thinking �That's the
  first time she's ever had one of her slaves open the door naked. That must
  mean that Master and her have some kind of bondage scene planned for tonight.
  Oh goody I can't wait.� As we walk into the room I look around. On the right
  the wall is covered in books. Directly in front of us is her desk. On the left
  there is a couch and armchair set. Master and Doris sit on the couch while
  I sit in the armchair facing the door. 
 We spend the next 20 minutes catching up on everything that's
  been happening. Then Doris mischievously asks, �Do you know why Jarod brought
  you here tonight Jean?� 
 Looking at them suspiciously I say, �No.� 
 Surprised by my answer Doris looks at master and asks, �Should
  I tell her or do you want to?� 
 Smiling he says, �It was your idea you tell her.� 
 �Sure, but before I explain about tonight's plans, Jean I
  want you to meet someone.� As she said this she rang a bell that I hadn't noticed
  earlier. The same woman from earlier came in dragging another girl that looked
  to be about my age. The girl's arms were bound behind her back and she had
  a huge red ball gag firmly strapped into her mouth. I could tell that she was
  trying to scream, but all you could hear was moaning coming from behind the
  gag. She was forced to kneel next to Doris. 
 Continuing Doris says, �Jean tonight Jarod and I have decided
  that you are to refer to me as Mistress. The reason for this being is we want
  you to show this slut how a good slave behaves.� 
 Murmuring I say, �Yes Mistress. Throughout her explanation
  I kept staring at the girl. There was something very familiar about her. Looking
  at both of them I ask, �Master, Mistress may I ask a question?� 
 In unison they both say, �Sure.� 
 �Who is she? She looks familiar to me.� 
 Slightly surprised Mistress says, �I'm surprised you don't
  recognize her. You remember the school bully that used to mess with you when
  you were growing up. Well this is her, AJ.� 
 As her words sink in I go completely numb. My first instinct
  is to run and that's exactly what I do. As fast as I can I jump out of my seat
  and start running through the house. Just as I'm about to go through the door
  I hear Master yelling at me to stop. I ignore him as I go running through the
  door only to trip partway down the drive way. I don't bother to get up and
  continue my flight I just lay there crying wishing I could disappear off the
  face of the planet. 
 Sensing someone behind me I become quiet afraid that my crying
  would piss the person off behind me. A few minutes later I'm roughly pulled
  to my feet by my arm. Terrified I look up to see who has a hold of my arm.
  What I see confirms my fears and I start stammering, �I I didn't mean�I I'm
  sorry�P-please�N-no please�I didn't mean.� 
 Seeing a hand flying towards me I instantly quiet down. In
  mid swing the hand drops. I am then lead back into the house. Not caring where
  I'm being lead to all I can think is that �I wish that Master was here.' I'm
  so caught up in my fear that I don't even realize that we had entered the house
  again. 
 Seeing Doris I realize that I'm safe and nothing bad is going
  to happen I nearly collapse in relief. The only thing keeping me from collapsing
  to the ground is the hand that has a hold of my arm. Looking up to see who
  has me I cry out in relief when I see that it's Master. Seeing recognition
  in my eyes he pulls me into a tight comforting embrace. Still holding me close
  he asks, �What's wrong? Why'd you run from me, my sweet slave?� 
 Staying as close to Master as possible I remain silent. Doris
  still mad that I ran like I had grabs me by the arm and forces me to look at
  her. Looking me in the eyes she says, �Answer his question, now?� 
 Scared I start mumble, �I c-can't. She said that if I ever
  told she'd k-kill me.� 
 Master showing more concern than I have ever heard or seen
  asks, �Who'll kill you?� 
 Afraid of answering him I look towards the study not wanting
  to see the worry in his eyes that I know is there. Where I see AJ tied and
  gagged. Master gently takes hold of my chin and forces me to look at him and
  asks, �Does this have anything to do with AL?� 
 Slowly I nod. With my confirmation of his suspicion I can
  see his expression change from worry to anger. Seeing his anger I cringe away
  thinking he's angry at me. But he only gently pushes me into Doris's arms then
  goes storming into the study. Doris pulls me along into the study following
  Master. 
 As we enter the study we see Master standing over AJ as she
  cowering on the ground trying to get away from him. Yanking the gag out of
  her mouth he yells at her asking, �What the hell did you do to her?� 
 Seeing us approach sneering AJ says, �Nothing she didn't
  deserve.� 
 Hearing her answer sets me off and I start screaming, �Deserve.
  Did I deserve to be beaten, made into a slave, and raped? What did I do to
  deserve all of that hell?� 
 With detest she spat, �You were born.� 
 Stunned I collapse to the couch as her statement sinks in.
  Then as if in slow motion I watch as she falls to the floor blood dripping
  from her lip. 
 Feeling someone touching my leg I look up to see who it is.
  It's the one person I wish was anywhere but here. It was my Master. I didn't
  want him to learn about my past, about AJ, about why I'm the way I am. If he
  knew he would leave me. This all goes flying through my mind as I look into
  his eyes searching for the rejection that I know is coming. Only it never comes.
  Instead he pulls me into his arms hugging me tenderly. 
 Trying to comfort me he whispers, �I know what you're thinking,
  that I'm going to reject you once I learn about your past, but you're wrong.
  Knowing about your past could only make me lover you more my sweet slave. Not
  only do you deserve to be here, but you make me whole. Do you believe me when
  I tell you that you not only deserve to be here but have every right to?� 
 Looking into his eyes I could see that he truly believes
  what he was saying. So I nod and mumble, �Yes Master.� 
 Feeling a light touch on my arm I jump with a start only
  to realize that it was Doris. I had completely forgotten that she was here.
  Looking up into her eyes I could tell that she held the same belief as Master.
  Giving me a reassuring hug I could feel the love that both Master and Doris
  felt for me. Relaxing into the feel of both of them I say �I do deserve to
  be here.� 
 Getting my attention Master asks, �What did AJ do to you
  that has you so afraid that you'd run from me? That has you crying with so
  much pain that I feel completely helpless to help you?� 
 Tears starting to fall I ask, �Master why do you have to
  know?� 
 �Well my sweet slave I have to know because I love you and
  until you tell me what happened I will have no way to help you. The thought
  that you're in so much pain and I have no way to help you frightens me terribly.� 
 Hearing that I realize that he needs to know and that by
  my not telling him I'm doing him a great disservice. He needs to know why I
  hurt so much and why I'm afraid that he'd leave me. 
 Taking a deep breath I exhale trying to push out all my worries
  and fears. With the exhalation of my fears and worries I start my story, �Everything
  started when I was a baby. My parents decided that they wanted to go on a trip
  around the world and having a baby would just interfere with all of their plans.
  They found a daycare provider named Carole that would be willing to watch me
  for the length of their trip. Even once they got back from their trip they
  didn't have me stop going to her house everyday. 
 �My first memory is from when I was about 5. We were in the
  garage and she was standing over me telling me that from this day forward I
  was to call her Ma'am unless there was anyone but her family there then I had
  to call her Aunt Carole. Anytime I disobeyed her she would spank me. But it
  didn't matter whether I obeyed her or not she would find a reason to spank
  me anyways. On nights that my parents would have me spending the night at her
  house she would spank me long and hard. Leaving me in pain and bruised. Things
  continued in this fashion until I was 8 and then she told me that I was not
  big enough to start doing work around the house. I was forced to pick up all
  the dirty laundry, and put away all of the clean dishes. If I forgot to pick
  something up or put the dishes away in the wrong places I would get a spanking.
  I would also get a spanking if I broke any of the dishes while I put them away. 
 �At about the age of 10 she decided that her daughter, AJ
  a year older than me was old enough to start taking part in my training as
  she called it. This is also when she told me that from then on I would be her
  salve and that any order from her daughter was to be obeyed without question.
  From then on I was to call her Mistress and AJ ma'am. I know did all the chores
  along with taking care of all of the other kids she was supposed to be taking
  care of. If any of the kids got into trouble I would be punished along with
  any punishment I would receive for not doing something. 
 �As my elementary school graduation came closer I started
  to have hope that I was finally going to be free form my nightmare. I was wrong.
  Mistress talked to my parents telling them that I had come to her saying that
  I didn't want to stop coming to her house once I started middle school. That
  I wanted to keep coming to her house to play with all the other kids. To encourage
  my parents to make the decision to let me keep coming she told them that they
  would no longer have to pay her. My parents readily agreed because they didn't
  want to have to deal with me. 
 �Things continued in the same manner until my 15 th birthday
  when Mistress decided that I no longer deserved to be a virgin any more. She
  had several men there that were willing to pay to have sex with me. She told
  them that if I didn't please them that I would get the whipping of my life.
  From then on she would have men coming several times during the month to have
  sex with me. At the end of each session with the men she would whip me calling
  me a slut and a whore. Through all of this you have to understand she was constantly
  telling me that if I ever told anyone what she was doing to me she would hunt
  me down and kill me. 
 �Finally at the age of 17 when I was on one of my rare trips
  home to see my parents I decided that I had had enough of her so I ran away.
  After I ran away I found a job and work hard to make a life for myself. AT
  17&frac12; I was able to start college. That's when I meet Doris and from there
  you know the rest of my story Master.� 
 With the completion of my story I look into Master's eyes
  to see his reaction. The look that meets me is one of pure anguish at all I
  had to live through. I was completely startled by his reaction. I was sure
  that he would leave me. Instead he pulls me into his arms saying, �My poor
  baby. I had no idea. You're safe now. I won't ever let anything hurt you like
  that again.� 
 Hearing his reassurance releases the floodgates with in me
  and I start crying for all those years of pain that I had kept locked up with
  in me. Calming down I pull away enough to look up into Master's eyes. They
  are the same as I have always known them to be. Filled with love and compassion
  for me. At that moment looking up at him I can feel all that love washing over
  me washing away all the years of pain and sorrow that I had locked up. At that
  moment I knew with all my heart that Master's love for me could never be taken
  away by something that I couldn't control. 
 Mustering as much courage as I can I look over to AJ and
  in the strongest surest voice I have I say, �You're wrong. I didn't deserve
  a dame thing you and your mother did to me.� Both Master and Doris nod in agreement. 
 Giving me a quick hug Doris says, �I think its time we dealt
  with this bitch. Don't you agree Jarod?� 
 Yes I quite agree. 
 Looking to me Doris asks, �Do you want be involved in her
  punishment or do you just want to sit back and watch?� 
 Leaning in closer to Master I tentatively ask, �Can we please
  just go home? I don't want to be anywhere near her right now. Master I just
  want to be alone with you right now snuggled into your safe strong arms. Please
  Master.� 
 Laughing softly he says, �Of course my sweet. What ever you
  want. Maybe another day you will be able to pay her back for all that she put
  you through.� 
 To Doris I say, �I'm sorry Mistress. I just can't handle
  being around her anymore tonight.� 
 Laughing she hugs me and says, �No problem sweetie. When
  ever you are ready to confront her she'll be here waiting for you.� 
 With that settled Master takes me home to the one place I
  know I will always belong. 

The End
