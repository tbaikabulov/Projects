Synopsis: Lisa is kidnapped and tortured before facing her final challenge.         






Lisa regained consciousness in great pain. Her wrists were pulled high above her head, holding her weight off the ground. Her shoulders screamed in agony as they felt as if they were being pulled from their sockets, one was already dislocated, though she was unaware of that, simply feeling the immense pain. Her legs were off the ground, and tied wide apart, her ankles hurting with the restraints, and her thighs aching as they were pulled wide by more ropes tied to her knees.

Any movement from Lisa was impossible, save for her head. Trying to ignore the pain she moved her head to see where she was. It looked as if she were in a large factory, with a high roof, lined with metal joists, from one of which she was hanging. The floor was a good three feet beneath her feet, ensuring that even if she somehow managed to get her ankles and knees free, she would still not be able to take the pressure off her shoulders and wrists.

She cast her mind back to earlier that day. Was it that day? She couldn&#8217;t remember.

There was a knock at the front door, and as she began to open it, the door was forced open, knocking her backwards, before she had been able to react a large man had forced his way inside the house, and without a word, had lashed out with his fist, hitting her in the solar plexus, knocking the wind from her, and dropping her to the floor. 

The man climbed on top of her. his knees pressing her body to the floor. And withdrew a hypodermic syringe from a pocket and removing the cover, placed it against her left arm, finding a vein, and pressing in. a light tingle followed as the man pumped something into her blood stream. Whatever she had been injected with was fast working.. in seconds she could feel herself getting light headed, her attempts to get free were more feeble. The man&#8217;s features seemed to blur, and then a wave of darkness came and took her.

Now she was here, in this factory, in agony and, as far as she could tell, alone. Her whole body ached and was stretched to its limits.

�Welcome back Lisa�

The voice came from somewhere behind her. it was a deep man&#8217;s voice, and, she could hear no warmth in it whatsoever.

�Welcome to my playground. Feel free to scream if you wish, we are miles from the nearest neighbour, and a few miles from a road. The lane leading to the factory is almost overgrown, and attracts no visitors. You may as well know, your life can now be counted in hours and minutes, instead of years. You will not survive what I plan for you.�

�Let me go� Lisa pleaded. �I don&#8217;t know you, I have not hurt you. Please, let me go�

In answer a line of fire erupted across her back, as the whip the man was holding flew out. The red welt appeared instantly, and brought a high pitched scream from Lisa&#8217;s mouth. Even before the sting of the first blow had began to lower, another line of fire crossed her back, causing another scream.

�I told you Lisa. You are not going to survive this. There is no escape, and no freedom to hope for. No-one will suddenly appear and rescue you, no-one to carry you off like a knight in shining armour. You are here at and for my pleasure. Hopefully, you will last long enough so I can take time to enjoy you, but the last couple didn&#8217;t last long.�

The man moved from behind her to stand in front of her, a long whip in his hand, a black leather whip. Without a word he pulled his arm back, and as if hypnotised, Lisa watched as the whip snaked slowly behind the man&#8217;s back, and then came forward with great speed. For a second she lost sight of it, but the scream of pain across her naked stomach told her where it had been heading. Again the man pulled the whip back, and with a flick, sent it back out in Lisa&#8217;s direction, this time, catching her breast, dragging a guttural scream from her lips. The red welt showed that it had actually crossed her nipple. No wonder her scream had been so guttural.

Again and again the whip snaked out, criss crossing her body with welt after welt. At some stage, Lisa had passed out, but this did not deter the man, as he again moved behind her and continued his treatment of her unconscious body.

Eventually, he stopped, and unfastening the ropes on her ankles and knees, he lowered the hoist holding her by the wrists, lowering her to the floor. Being only a little over five feet tall, and weighing less than 130 pounds, the man had no problem picking her up and carrying her to a room on one side of the old factory, securing the limp woman to a metal table. Laying on her back, her feet and ankles secured to the corners, again, stretching her. He had noticed but decided to ignore that one of her shoulders seemed dislocated. That was the least of Lisa&#8217;s problems.

When she again regained consciousness the man was standing over her. She tried to move, to sit up, but though she could wiggle her body a little, her arms and legs would not move. The pain in her shoulder was constant, but perhaps not as severe.

Looking at the man Lisa could see something shiny and metallic in his hands. It took a few seconds to realise it was a scalpel.

The man seemed to smile, though his eyes were not smiling, as he moved the scalpel towards her left breast, which she suddenly realised was tied with rope, making her breasts stand out, hard and straight. Mesmerised, she watched as the man moved the scalpel towards her nipple. And without a word, sank the point of the doctor&#8217;s knife in her breast, just to one side of the nipple.

Trying to hold stock still, so he would not cut her accidentally, was the reaction the man had hoped for, and before Lisa could realise she had made a mistake, the man moved the sharp implement, and had started cutting her, the scalpel passing easily though her flesh, grinning as the nipple was removed.

Lisa screamed louder than she had ever screamed in her life, as nerves were severed with the nipple, sending her body into shock. She knew nothing about the second nipple being cut off, her brain unable to handle the pain and shock, had caused her to lapse into unconsciousness again.

�No matter, Lisa� the man said to the unhearing girl.� We will continue later�.

With that the man walked to the door of the room and left her alone. It didn&#8217;t matter if she awoke before he returned, no-one would hear her screams, and the restraints holding her to the table would not release without the special key he had in his pocket..

It was two days before the man returned. Lisa was exactly as he had left her, and appeared to be asleep. He could see the gentle rise and fall of her chest. Accentuated by the two dark areas of dried blood where her nipples had once been.

Throwing a bucket of cold water on the girl brought her back to life with a start.

�Hello Lisa. Time to continue�.

The puddle and the mess between Lisa&#8217;s legs was testament to her still being able to shit and piss, though one of those was about to end. The man again produced the same needle he had injected her with at her own house, and finding a vein, soon had the heavy sedative coursing though her body. Ten cc was enough to put a horse down in seconds, and Lisa had just been injected with 20. once again she would be out for many hours, which would allow him to put his next plans into operation. Secretly, he was pleased that she was still alive, the last girl had died from shock when the nipples had been removed. 

Within seconds, Lisa&#8217;s body went limp. The sedative taking effect quickly. 

Taking his time, the man released Lisa from her restraints, but didn&#8217;t immediately move her from the table, though he did turn her over and lay her on her stomach. Had she been awake, her nipple less breasts would have been hurting her badly.

Taking up the bag he had brought into the room with him, he located a butt plug. It was larger than a man&#8217;s cock by a good inch or two in width, and he knew that even with Lisa&#8217;s body being limp. It would have to be forced into place. It was also longer than a standard cock, being ten inches long. Once it was in place Lisa would never crap again. Taking the superglue from his bag he removed the top and covered the butt plug in the adhesive. Quickly he placed the tip of the plug at the tight hole, and with great effort, rammed the plug into her. stretching her. It didn&#8217;t matter if the plug tore any flesh on the way in, the superglue would still prevent it coming out.

Once the plug was fully inserted, the man again left the room. Lisa would not be awake for a good few hours yet, and that would be plenty of time to ensure the glue set, making the plug a permanent part of her.

He walked slowly to another part of the factory, and started up the machine he had bought a few years ago. The cement mixer had been bought as he had originally intended to fix up the old factory, and sell it on. But that was now out of the question. Under its floor lay three bodies. Lisa would be number four, but, hopefully, she would last long enough to know where her last resting place was going to be. So far, she was standing up well to what was happening to her. He had doubted she would do so well when he first spotted her, months ago.&nbsp; But, he followed her, studied her routine, and worked out how and when the best time would be to kidnap her.

She didn&#8217;t seem to have many friends visit her house, and as she didn&#8217;t have a job, there would be no employer looking for her. in truth, she was not going to be missed for some time yet. He had spent the two days previously watching her house to see if police activity was evident, but, there had been nothing. The alarm had not been raised, and by the time it was, if ever it was, she would be long gone.

Leaving the cement mixing in the machine, the man made his way back to where he had left Lisa. She was still lying as he had left her, and when he attempted to remove the butt plug, it simply refused to move. It was now a part of her, and would remain so.

Once again the man turned Lisa over and replaced the restraints, but left her ankles free for now. He picked up a wooden box, open at the top, with a cut out that would allow her ankle to slide into, so that her foot was in the box. Repeating this with the other foot, the man went back to the machine. The cement had mixed nicely, and he allowed the contents to fill the wheel barrow he had next to the machine. Turning the machine off, he wheeled the load back to where Lisa lay. Using a shovel. It took little time for the man to fill each of the boxes, encasing Lisa&#8217;s feet in the cement. Once it dried, he could allow her to be restraint free. The weight of the cement would restrict her movement.

Once again he injected Lisa with more of the sedative. He didn&#8217;t want her waking up until the cement was dry. Checking that she was still breathing. The man left the room, and headed for the factory door. He would be gone three days, by which time, Lisa would be almost ready for the last acts.

He laughingly called it the last rites, but it would only be HIS rights he would be working towards.

On his return, Lisa was awake, but he could see she was a lot weaker than she had been before. The week without food had taken its toll. Her feet were now totally encased in cement, and he could see by the colour that it was completely dry. Moving quickly, the man released Lisa&#8217;s wrists from their restraints. Immediately she sat up, and squealed in pain. The butt plug, being solid, had caused a reaction as she had sat up. She had not really been aware of it&#8217;s presence until that moment when it had refused to bend with her.

Lazily she sank back onto the table, almost resigned to her fate.. the man undressed and climbed onto the table between Lisa&#8217;s open legs.

�I know you don&#8217;t want this, and I know you want to resist, but, you are not going to do so.� Lisa moved her arms to push the man away as his body covered hers, but he was much stronger than she was, and easily held her hands in his as he moved his cock towards her pussy. �You may as well enjoy this Lisa, as it&#8217;s the last cock you are ever going to feel inside you.�

With that, the man rammed his hips forward, his cock finding its target, and thrusting deep into the girl, ignoring her tears of protest. She had long since stopped pleading for him not to do something, as she knew he would simply ignore her anyway.

His cock was larger than she had though, and she could feel it pressing deep inside her, as if he were fucking her stomach. He was taking his time, slow deep strokes, his hips clashing with hers each time he thrust forwards. She tried to move her ankles. To close her legs, but the cement boots she now wore made sure that she failed, as the man continued to ravage her pussy.

She wanted him to cum, just to get it over with, but also, wanted him to stop, before he came. What if she got pregnant? Or even worse, got an STD.?

It didn&#8217;t matter. Nothing mattered now. she was fully aware that his boast that she would not survive, was no idle boast. She wasn&#8217;t sure how he would end it for her, but, she realised that he would when he was ready. Trying to stop his rape of her, would be as futile as trying to escape. But she didn&#8217;t have to enjoy it. Maybe if she lay still and ignored what was happening, he would stop. But even as that thought passed through her mind, she knew it was stupid. He had already said he was only interested in his own pleasures. How or what she was feeling, whether or not she had an orgasm, was of no consequence to him. As long as he came. That was all that mattered to him, and she knew he would cum inside her if he wanted. 

The fact she was suddenly getting warm, took her by surprise. She tried to push thoughts from her mind, but the growing heat between her legs simply couldn&#8217;t be ignored. She was getting sexually turned on by the rape. His cock was sliding deep inside her, his body striking at her clit with each thrust. 

He started to move faster. Driving harder with each thrust, his breath sharpening, and she knew that he was soon going to cum. What surprised her was that her own orgasm was also building. She was lifting her hips to meet his thrusts, grinding her hips against him as they made contact, making sure the collision of his body and her clit continued. It didn&#8217;t matter that this would be her last fuck, she just needed to cum.

Then it happened., it hit like a train,, as her orgasm exploded like never before. She lifted her hips and screamed out as his hips rammed again and again against her clit, sending her over the edge with a vengeance, and at the same time, flooding her cunt with his own juices.

She wanted to wrap her legs around him to hold him inside her, but the cement boots made sure she couldn&#8217;t, her legs simply refused to move. Tears flooded her eyes, but not tears of pain, tears of joy, emotional tears, mixed emotions. She hated this man, wanted nothing more but to see him die a slow painful death, but he had brought her the single most intensive orgasm she had ever had. She knew she wanted more, knew no-one could give them but him, but also knew that she would never again feel the same, never again feel a cock inside her, never again feel the sublime feeling she was in the throes of at this moment.

�Okay Lisa. The time is near. Your life is almost over, and I want to thank you for living long enough. I didn&#8217;t do half of what I planned, but, I had other things to take care of. My daughter is ill, and I had to spend time at home looking after her. Otherwise I would have been here torturing you.�

Lisa had never given a thought to who or what the man was, let alone that he could have a family. How could he be contemplating murdering her, and at the same time be spending hours at his child&#8217;s sick bed? Surely, he could now be reasoned with, but even as she opened her mouth, she knew it was not going to happen.

Moving away from the girl, the man grabbed both her wrists and began to pull, pulling her unceremoniously from the table. Allowing her body to slam against the floor as first one and then the other of her feet crashed to the floor.

It took some minutes to drag the girl across the factory floor, and towards the area he had not yet finished refurbishing. Even before they reached it, Lisa could see the hole in the ground. Panic set in as she realised the man was REALLY going to kill her. until now it had been just words, but the hole in the ground brought the reality to the fore. She wanted so much to live, wanted him to release her. she struggled to get free, but his grip was far too strong, and he co0ntinued to drag her with ease.

She was screaming threats, begging for forgiveness for things she didn&#8217;t even know she had done, begging him to let her live, but it was as if the man was deaf, as they reached the hole and the man lay Lisa on the ground at the edge of the hole.

Lisa twisted her head to see the hole. It was a little over four feet deep, and not very square. The man, she decided, was not the most neatest man in the world. She caught herself, and reminded herself that this man was going to kill her, whether he was neat or not was immaterial, he was a murderer. He had already admitted to killing at least one other, and now she was going to be number two, or three? She found herself wondering how many others he had murdered this way..

The man leant down over her ready to roll her into the hole, grabbing first one hand and then the other, placing metal cuffs on her wrists, behind her back, to prevent her using her arms.. Quickly, he rolled her over once, and the weight of the cement on her feet dragged her down into the hole.

Leaving her lying there screaming insults at him, the man returned to the cement mixer, filling it with gravel and cement. It would only take minutes to mix the concrete that would encase Lisa for ever.

Eventually the mix was ready, and the man tipped the concrete into the barrow, refilling the machine for the second load. Soon, he had manoeuvred the wheel barrow to the edge of the hole. It was going to take three loads, but, he didn&#8217;t mind, he had time. He lifted the handles of the barrow smiled as he heard Lisa&#8217;s scream as the concrete poured out over her legs. using a spade, the man spread the load out, covering Lisa past her knees and up to her waist. She wanted to sit up, he could see that, but the butt plug was making it difficult.

Again the man returned to the machine and emptied the second load into the barrow, refilling it one more time before he returned to where Lisa was in deep panic.

Lifting the barrow, the cold mix fell onto the helpless girl. Again, the man took up the spade and spread the load, covering her stomach, her breasts, but leaving her head free.

�One more load� he said, as he began to walk away. Lisa suddenly noticed the wheel barrow squeaked as it was rolled. How had she not noticed it before?

Then it dawned on her. the next load would cover her face. Cover her head, would cover her mouth. She tried in vain to move, but the weight of the concrete on her already made it difficult, and the inability to bend made it more so., whoever this man was, this murderer, he seemed to know what he was doing.

She listened, and then heard it, the squeak of the barrow. She could not see over the top of the hole, but the barrow was getting closer, and closer.. then the squeaking stopped, and she knew that the man was close to the hole, and was about to pour the mix over her head. Again she begged to be freed. Even promised not to tell anyone what had happened. Another squeak. At first Lisa thought he had changed his mind and was walking away, but as the cold, wet mix began to cascade into the hole, she knew she was wrong. She tried to keep her mouth closed, her eyes closed, but each scream allowed the mix to enter her mouth, faster than she could spit it out. She allowed herself to ask why there had been no last goodbye, but, she knew it had gone unheard.

The man smoothed off the concrete. He looked carefully at it. Yep, he would get away with that one. No-one would ever know what was under this floor. Walking back to the room where Lisa had been kept, he moved to a small filing cabinet in the corner, and took a photograph out of it, tearing it in half, before picking up another one, studying it.

�Anna� he said to the picture. �Your turn�
