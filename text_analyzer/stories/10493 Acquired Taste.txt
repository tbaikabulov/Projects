Introduction


Mature, but still definitely beautiful, Jill pursed then opened he deep painted lips. �No Anton�, she asserted as she stared down at her date as she sensed him pausing over an item on the menu.

&#8216;But I&#8217;m paying.&#8217; Anton could have rebutted, but he was raised a gentleman and there is nothing like a matriarchal Grandmother to imprint a code of conduct on a growing boy.&nbsp; The waitress young, a brunette, and obviously just of age seemed a little more relaxed as his eyes moved past today&#8217;s special described only as &#8216;Rose: Cooked to Order&#8217;.&nbsp; A quick check of her name tag by Jill told her that this waitress had indeed landed herself on the menu.&nbsp; Rose had a band aids over her pierced ears and her white sleeveless shirt half covered a tattooed thorns leading up to a red flower.&nbsp; Rose most likely came from an under privileged home.&nbsp; She was probably forced to sign a contract when she started placing her on the menu for a set period of time.&nbsp; If she survived her trail period she would be safe.&nbsp; Jill surmised she most likely would as those seeking such delicacies usually went into the more lavish restaurants of the city.&nbsp; Either out of intelligence or luck, Rose had risked her head at a Bar or Restaurant where the river fringed suburbia and those with the means to afford such indulgences rarely attend.&nbsp; Anton put his menu down and looked at Jill.&nbsp; Rose&#8217;s attention shifted.

�I&#8217;ll have the Chicken Parma with sundried tomatoes and salad side.�&nbsp; Jill said and Rose scribbled down the code for the kitchen.&nbsp; She turned, still a little apprehensive, to Anton.

�Rib-eye, medium rare with beer battered chips.�&nbsp; He ordered and looked down at Roses thighs beneath the hem of the short black skirt.&nbsp; Jill placed her leg on the inside of his as if to remind him of manners.&nbsp; Rose didn&#8217;t notice, her relief at not being ordered expressed in a deep exhale that admitted there would be another close call with someone else, and maybe even�&nbsp; She finished, smiled at Jill efficiently, but avoided eye contact with Anton.

�Wrong strategy.�&nbsp; Anton said to Jill as Rose left.&nbsp; �Someone&#8217;s going to order her just to see her squirm.�

�You&#8217;re so mean.�&nbsp; Jill said playfully, but her leg was running up and down Anton&#8217;s beneath the table.

�So this is our new routine.&nbsp; Pub food on Thursdays.�&nbsp; It was Anton turned to be playful.&nbsp; He had met Jill when they both worked for Goldman Sachs investment brokerage.&nbsp; Jill headed up a clerical department involved in administration.&nbsp; Anton had been hired to work in the Futures department.&nbsp; Where Jill&#8217;s talents kept her where fixed in her position, Anton&#8217;s talent at hedging commodities meant he quickly moved upward before he was overseeing a small department.&nbsp; As human resources became an issue Jill had seen an opportunity to move out of her rut.&nbsp; Her ambition turned to a friendship and finally to a relationship.

�There&#8217;s nothing wrong with Pub food Bub&#8217;� Jill said.&nbsp; She was just before forty, but had the privilege of a joggers physic and well-tended skin.&nbsp; Her shoulder length blonde hair curled inward at her neck around her slender face.&nbsp; Pale blue eyes sparkled at Anton and her blood red lips made an obstacle out of the small table between them.&nbsp; She was intelligent, funny, sexy and experienced.&nbsp; Her husband had died when there only daughter was ten.&nbsp; Jill went from working part time to full time and her daughter Sophia moved into day-care.&nbsp; Despite his playful criticisms Jill had been correct the Anton would learn to like this place.&nbsp; He was away from the opinions and sycophantic conversations of the city.

�Blind man walks into a bar.�&nbsp; Anton started.

�Says ouch!�&nbsp; Jill finished ruining his joke, but Anton smiled.

�You&#8217;re very pretty for a bank worker Jill Jones.�&nbsp; Anton flirted.

�Really I am quiet plan by my banks standards�, Jill replied leaning forward.

Anton was leaning in too.&nbsp; �I must visit this bank you speak of.�

�Are you sure, management is such a drag.�

�Boring people?�&nbsp; They were inches apart.

�Tediously so.�&nbsp; Grace held her ground making Anton close the last inch.

The moment was ruined as Rose re-appeared with their drinks and then froze in terror as if she expected her interruption to result in a change of order.&nbsp; The lovers gave each other a too be continued look and Jill allowed Anton to look at Rose with false, annoyed and contemplative eyes.&nbsp; The Waitress hastily placed the drinks and exited so quickly she almost tripped over her own feet.

Jill shock her head and separated herself from the commiseration an inept waitress deserved.

Anton sipped his scotch and mused that at least this place had Glenfiddich.

Anton&#8217;s BMW pulled up outside Jill&#8217;s two story catalogue home.&nbsp; She lived in a regulated village where the inhabitants had to have lawns of a set variety of grass, cut to a set length.&nbsp; She leaned over and kissed Anton once; twice; their kiss elongated and the pair started something familiar and welcome.

�You coming in Mr Bridges?�&nbsp; Jill drew her fingers forward and started twirling Anton&#8217;s tie.

Anton grew conflicted.&nbsp; He turned away from Jill to light coming from an upstairs window.&nbsp; �Sophia&#8217;s home� he said disappointed.

Jill frowned.&nbsp; She wanted to say &#8216;so what&#8217;, but she knew Anton wouldn&#8217;t budge.&nbsp; Sophia protested Anton&#8217;s presence in their home.&nbsp; She was not restrained from interruption the couples affections with banging on her mother&#8217;s door.&nbsp; The old tradition of parents interrupting their teenage children&#8217;s love life had been turned on its head with Jill.&nbsp; At times her daughter&#8217;s protests verged on juvenile tactics and Anton stepped away from assuming a fatherly role and disciplining her.&nbsp; Jill was sickly aware that if Sophia was not in her life that Anton would have asked the question by now.&nbsp; �Yes I will marry you Anton Biggs� she wanted to say.

She stopped playing with his tie and straightened it against his chest.&nbsp; �I&#8217;ll send her out next week.�&nbsp; She promised and kissed him again.

Anton didn&#8217;t re-engage knowing he wouldn&#8217;t be able to finish.&nbsp; �Take care Jill.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll see you tomorrow?�

Jill hummed through her lips.&nbsp; �Lunch with the girls.�&nbsp; She put on her smile.&nbsp; �I&#8217;ll call tomorrow night.�

�Ok.� Anton said and as Jill got out of the car he made another defeated look at the light from the window.

Jill got out and walked to her front door.&nbsp; Anton waited as he always did for Jill to slip inside before driving off.&nbsp; As Jill closed and leant on her front door and chaotic music mumbled through Sophia&#8217;s closed door.&nbsp; True to form her daughter wasn&#8217;t up doing homework.&nbsp; She took off her high heels and started up the stairs in the dark.&nbsp; As she ascended the music grew louder and before heading to her room she pushed open her daughter&#8217;s ajar door.&nbsp; Garbed in a long T-shirt and pink socks the blonde Socialite and hooky savant turned away from her monitor to face her hard working mother.&nbsp; 

�The shark with you?�&nbsp; Sophia said with all the attitude and beauty she could muster.

Her daughter was a poser.&nbsp; After nearly every comment or action she had to adopt a pose like her photo was just about to be taken.&nbsp; This time it involved piercing eyes, a cropped head and a flick of her long blonde hair.&nbsp; �Were the same age�, Jill pointed out tested at the use of &#8216;shark&#8217; to describe her boyfriend.

�Whatev&#8217;� Sophia replied losing interest.&nbsp; Her mother would have snapped if Anton was following her up the stairs.

�Turn that music down please.�

Sophia turned the dial, but not enough for her mother to be able to sleep.&nbsp; She started twirling her hair and turned back to the nonsense she was researching on the internet.

�I want you to go out next week.�

�Can&#8217;t.�

�When have you ever turned down going out on a school night?�&nbsp; Jill said starting to get vexed.
�Not going out till you take me down to the Registration office and emancipate me.�&nbsp; Sophia refer to her recent birthday.&nbsp; As she had just turned eighteen she was entitled to become a citizen and could look for a job.&nbsp; In order to become a citizen her mother had to emancipate her power of attorney over her daughter&#8217;s person.

Jill frowned.&nbsp; �I can&#8217;t get a day off this week and the office is closed weekends.�

�Care factor.�&nbsp; Sophia said without looking at her mother.&nbsp; It was blackmail plain and simple and a little bit of Sophia manipulating her mother and establish dominance.

�Sophia.� Jill pleaded.

�Find time or find somewhere else to hump Mr Boring Banker.�

�Why are you so interested in being emancipated?�&nbsp; Jill knew she wasn&#8217;t.&nbsp; Sophia was just using what leverage she could get hold of and lord it over her mother.&nbsp; Since she had starting seeing Anton Sophia had started acting up.&nbsp; She was demanding and confrontational.&nbsp; Jill backed down as she always did.&nbsp; �I&#8217;ll try and get a day the following week� she offered.

�Whatev&#8217;� Sophia confirmed disinterested.

Jill realised it was pointless to try and start and argument with her daughter and turned to her room.&nbsp; As she closed her door and started to slip out of her evening dress she heard the music get turned up in Sophia&#8217;s room.&nbsp; Jill just sat on her bed.&nbsp; If only Anton were interested in bringing her inline.&nbsp; Jill finished stripping and lay in bed.&nbsp; �Yes I will marry you Anton Biggs�, she said to herself and waited for her daughter to tire and turn the music down.

Jill sipped her Bloody Mary.&nbsp; She wasn&#8217;t listening to the conversation at the table.&nbsp; She was thinking about her life with woe.

�And she didn&#8217;t expect anything?� her colleague asked Mary as she performed in the metaphorical spot light.

�Not a thing.�&nbsp; Mary replied with opulent gestures not becoming her sweater vest and pink shirt.&nbsp; �She&#8217;d been causing all sorts of ruckus; staying out with boys; failing at school; NOT going to church.�

Jill hadn&#8217;t been paying attention as she zoned in and out of the conversation, but she knew from the inflection of her voice that Mary believed the last was unforgivable.

�So I went to the Vicar about her�, Mary paused to take a sipped in front of her captive audience.&nbsp; �And he said �&#8216;take her&#8217;� Mind you he only said &#8216;Take her to be emancipated and all will become clear.&#8217;�&nbsp; Another sip.

�You don&#8217;t believe he meant when you release her that you&#8217;ll realise that you have to protect her?�&nbsp; Her colleague pitched in again.

�When the receptionist behind the desk asked if we wanted her Emancipated or Consigned it all became crystal clear.&nbsp; I mean it was as if the Lord himself shown a light on the solution.�&nbsp; Mary looked up at the ceiling as if glancing into heaven.&nbsp; �And she was delicious.�

Jill finally caught up to the conversation.&nbsp; �You ate your daughter?�&nbsp; She said bewildered.

Mary looked a little hurt that such an engaging story performed with such descriptions had just been tuned in on.

�Yes Jill.�&nbsp; Yes said slightly annoyed, but still confident she held sway over the group of women from Goldman Sachs.&nbsp; �I consigned my eldest instead of Emancipating her and we through a party to eat her.�

Jill still hadn&#8217;t quiet taken in the idea brought to her attention whilst at lunch with the girls.

�I bet your other girls are behaving now.�&nbsp; A girl from Data Entry added.&nbsp; It was obvious she liked the idea.

�Like little angels.&nbsp; I tell you, if they all stay like this it&#8217;ll be like getting rid of one problem and stopping a dozen.�&nbsp; Mary held up her glass.&nbsp; �The Lord ain&#8217;t mysterious.&nbsp; He presents the solution to us.&nbsp; Most people just don&#8217;t listen.�&nbsp; As the laughter and clicking of glasses broke out around the table Jill felt slightly off ease.

&#8216;Could it be that simple?&#8217;

�How&#8217;d you get a day off work anyway?�&nbsp; Sophia&#8217;s bluff had been called.&nbsp; She stood in line at the Registration Office in her school uniform.&nbsp; She wasn&#8217;t aware of the looks she was getting from the men in the building.&nbsp; Polished black shoes; knee high white socks (Sophia&#8217;s personal touch of lace hems); a skirt she had raised the hem on to a near pornographic level and a nicely filled out white shirt, with the top two buttons undone.&nbsp; Her long blond hair and her mother&#8217;s eyes, innocent from her mother&#8217;s protection, surveyed the short distance to the counter.&nbsp; They had been inline for nearly half an hour.&nbsp; Jill was amazed it had taken her nearly this long before she started complaining.&nbsp; �Why&#8217;s the queue so long?�

�Because there&#8217;s a population crisis sweaty.�&nbsp; Jill answered.&nbsp; She was starting to get edgy, but handled pressure well.

�I don&#8217;t see why we have to do this today?�&nbsp; She tried.

&#8216;Oh no.&nbsp; You&#8217;re not getting out of this&#8217; Jill thought.&nbsp; �You wanted to come down here, so we came down here.&nbsp; Before you know it you&#8217;ll be emancipated and you can do what you like.�&nbsp; Jill watched the line ahead.&nbsp; A crying girl Sophia&#8217;s age finally got to her parents.&nbsp; They left the line, the girl, now overcome with relief at her parents mercy had been saved last minute� or maybe they just wanted to teach her a lesson.&nbsp; &#8216;No!&#8217;&nbsp; Jill assured herself thinking of putting just a scare into Sophia.&nbsp; &#8216;No more.&#8217;&nbsp; 

They stepped forward in line and Jill was surprised by her daughter&#8217;s coldness.&nbsp; �Shouldn&#8217;t have changed their minds� she said with regard to the now grateful girl who had been taken out of the queue.

Ordinarily Jill would have tried to correct her daughter&#8217;s ruthless view of those less fortunate, instead she waited patiently in line and did not have to wait much longer.&nbsp; Moments Later Jill and Sophia stepped forward to the clerk, a portly woman with black wavy hair.

�Form?�&nbsp; The woman with the name tag of Doris asked disinterested in the answer.&nbsp; It was most likely she had been desensitized to the pleas of those being Consigned and honestly no longer care what the beautiful and perky girl in front of hers fate was.

�Emancipation.�&nbsp; Sophia said with barbed tongue, insulted at the mere question that she was on the level of the girl who found themselves on the dinner table, but Doris looked past her at Jill.&nbsp; Legally it was Jill&#8217;s call.&nbsp; Jill felt awkward, she knew she couldn&#8217;t pause or give the game away so she played along.&nbsp; 

�Emancipation� she said and smiled down at Sophia hoping her nerves weren&#8217;t showing.

Doris turned away from her window and went and got the appropriate form.&nbsp; The short delay bought Jill time to think.&nbsp; As Doris returned with a printed leaf of paper Jill politely asked �Does my daughter actually need to sign anything?�&nbsp; She knew the answer.&nbsp; Sophia had no such rights till the form was stamped.

�No.&nbsp; You&#8217;re daughter has no rights until she is Emancipated from your custody.�&nbsp; Doris plopped the form down and extended a pen.

�Sweaty, since you don&#8217;t have to sign anything why don&#8217;t you go wait in the car.�&nbsp; Jill was gambling.&nbsp; If Sophia stayed she would be forced to ask for the other form whilst her daughter through a tantrum in public.&nbsp; She may have jogged and taken aerobics glasses, but given her temperament there was no guarantee her daughter wouldn&#8217;t become physical.

Sophia rolled her eyes, clearly annoyed she had been made to come down here when her presence wasn&#8217;t required.&nbsp; Despite her self-righteous indignation and this being her idea she composed herself, over the whole experience.&nbsp; �Whatev&#8217;� she said dismissively.

�Sorry sweaty, you go wait in the car and listen to the radio.�&nbsp; Before Jill had finished Sophia tuned her back on her mother and strutted out, catching the eyes of the wrong type of men as she went.

As Jill turned back to the counter Doris gave her a half smile.&nbsp; Every day she no doubt saw girls of polite and kind disposition sentenced as food.&nbsp; Jill quickly redeemed herself.&nbsp; �Actually I would very much like the other form.�&nbsp; She said with haste, not wanting Sophia to return before it was done.

�Oh no� Doris said sarcastically picking up the piece of paper and turning, �what will future generations think.�

Jill didn&#8217;t know exactly how to take Doris&#8217; deliberately poor performance of a concerned Social Worker, but smiled politely as Doris returned with the Consigned form.&nbsp; Jill immediately and with haste, motivated out of fear of losing her nerve, started to fill out the form.&nbsp; Once Sophia&#8217;s details had been filled in Jill bought out the complementary certificates to prove hers and Sophia&#8217;s identity.&nbsp; Doris collected the papers and went to photocopy them for the file.&nbsp; �You need to fill out the other side and sign�, she informed and left Jill alone at the counter.

Jill flicked the page and saw a checklist of options.&nbsp; She read the first.&nbsp; &#8216;Are you in any capacity going to make a non-tax deductable profit from the individuals Consignment&#8217;?&nbsp; Jill paused over the question and then read through the further options.&nbsp; &#8216;Do you plan to make a recording of the Consigned Individuals termination&#8217;?&nbsp; They were legal disclaimers regarding the treatment of Sophia once she was meat.&nbsp; Obviously having the right to do whatever you pleased to an individual had to be policed.&nbsp; Without such laws you could keep a Consigned person as a sex-slave or torture pet, not exactly doing its part for population control and possible tax-free income.&nbsp; Jill found herself unwilling to tick any of the boxes.

Doris returned and assessed Jill&#8217;s hesitation.&nbsp; �Just tick every box as yes.&nbsp; It&#8217;s what most people do.&nbsp; If you don&#8217;t there are a whole heap of timestamps that it has to be done by.�&nbsp; She was referring to Sophia&#8217;s death.&nbsp; �Also, the last thing you want is one of them Animal Rights activists slapping you with a lawsuit telling you you&#8217;re responsible for cruel practises.�

Jill still couldn&#8217;t sign.&nbsp; By chance she looked to her side and saw Sophia re-entering the building.&nbsp; Jill realised she didn&#8217;t have time and hastily tick &#8216;Yes&#8217; in every box, much to Doris&#8217; delight.&nbsp; As Sophia approached her mother Jill quickly signed and handed the form back to Doris.

�Mum.�&nbsp; Sophia barked annoyed.&nbsp; �I need the keys to listen to the radio.�&nbsp; Her voice was spiked with the outrage of having to walk all the way to the car only to have to turn back.&nbsp; Clearly a task that degrade her somehow.

�Don&#8217;t be like that honey.�&nbsp; Doris said in a mock friendly tone.

Sophia didn&#8217;t pick up on the conspiracy in her voice.

�All I got to do is stamp this bit of paper and it&#8217;s done.�&nbsp; Doris took the form Jill had just finished filling out and with a puncher, stamped in red ink &#8216;Approved&#8217; on the from.

Jill waited nervously hoping Doris wouldn&#8217;t give her away.

�So it&#8217;s done.&nbsp; I&#8217;m emancipated?�&nbsp; Despite her constant attitude her voice was tinged with the realization her life had changed.

�It&#8217;s coming honey.�&nbsp; Doris said with a pearly smile.&nbsp; She winked at Jill.

Sophia moved on immediately.&nbsp; �I want ice-cream� she order.

�Of course sweaty.�&nbsp; Jill said, not yet at peace with getting away with betraying her daughter.&nbsp; She moved away from the window and Sophia walked by her side.

�Do you think you could get me a job at Goldman Sachs when I leave school?�&nbsp; Sophia asked snapping back to thinking of her future now she believed she was Emancipated.

�Your grades aren&#8217;t good enough sweaty.�&nbsp; Jill answered fidgeting in her purse for her keys as they left the building.

Sophia acted outraged.&nbsp; �Jes&#8217; mum, I thought you loved me?!�

�Anton Biggs� he announced as he answered his office phone.

�What do you want me to wear?�&nbsp; Jill asked flirtation on her tongue.

�You&#8217;re very well sounding for a sick day� he playfully accused.&nbsp; Jill had gotten the day off work by playing she had a Twenty-four hour bug.&nbsp; Her supervisors wasn&#8217;t suspicious, Jill had a near perfect record.

Jill cut straight to the chase.&nbsp; �I want you to come around for dinner next Thursday, my place, bring what you need to stay the night.�&nbsp; Her voice was inviting and her tone created a picture of Jill laying in lingerie on a bed, eagerly waiting for him to come around.&nbsp; In truth Jill was in the kitchen of her house with the door closed as Sophia danced in her room to Hip-Hop music.

Anton broke the mood.&nbsp; �What about Sophia?�

�She&#8217;ll be there, but she&#8217;ll be very well behaved.�

Anton was silent.

�Anton, if she acts up on you then you can do whatever, anything, you like to me.&nbsp; No protests.�&nbsp; Jill whispered it into the phones receiver.

�Anything.�&nbsp; A man&#8217;s imagination can run wild and Sophia never behaved.

�Absolutely anything.�&nbsp; Jill could feel him taking the bait.

In his office Anton felt his member swell at the thought of what he might do.&nbsp; �Ok Jill, let&#8217;s hope she behaves.�&nbsp; He hung up the phone and straightened himself.&nbsp; His now firm member made him uncomfortable.&nbsp; He took a break from his spreadsheet analysis to look at Jill&#8217;s picture.

A knock came at his door.&nbsp; Anton&#8217;s meditation broke, but he hid his annoyance from his voice and sounded, �Enter.�&nbsp; A comely redhead with pale porcelain skin popped half through the now ajar door and waited for approval to step completely in.&nbsp; Anton smiled at the firm young body dress in a light Khaki short skirt and tight sleeveless shirt.&nbsp; The tight leather collar around her heck bit into her lean neck and the stiletto she was made to wear made her legs and buttocks mouth-watering.&nbsp; Anton refrained from starring at her slender waif waste and the two perky breasts bursting out of her shirt.&nbsp; �Janet come in� he said his erection renewed.

Janet still anxious and very much needing Anton&#8217;s approval stilted in on the stilettos.&nbsp; The individual in charge of the Consigned employees made sure they were a good inch too high for comfortable walking.&nbsp; �I have the print-outs of your projections for Cyanides portfolio.�&nbsp; She placed several folios on his desk and waited to be granted leave.

�Did you look over them?�&nbsp; Anton asked picking up the top and browsing through it.

Janet flushed, her pale skin turning pink.&nbsp; �I didn&#8217;t� It&#8217;s not my place to��

Anton flopped the folder back on his desk.&nbsp; �Janet, what did you do before the company caught you syphoning funds?�

�I was an investment clerk.�&nbsp; Janet answered.&nbsp; Her past was a reminder of her situation.

�A very good one.&nbsp; That is why I negotiated for the company to take you on rather than re-coup its losses by selling you the meat vender on the market.�&nbsp; He stared at her with omnipotent eyes.&nbsp; �If you contribute I can justify asking for concessions on your behalf.&nbsp; Better living quarters, personal allowance� he paused �increase in the duration of recompense prior to termination.�&nbsp; His final spoke of a delay in Janet&#8217;s inevitable date with a butcher.

�Ok Mr Biggs.�&nbsp; Janet replied enthusiastically.&nbsp; �I will�&nbsp; I will have something to offer next time.�&nbsp; She couldn&#8217;t make eye contact.

Anton reached forward and placed his hands on her hips.&nbsp; �We have to make the best of our station in life Janet.�&nbsp; He won.&nbsp; Janet finally looked him in the eyes and Anton was delighted with the intelligent submission he saw.&nbsp; Anton wanted to run his hands down to her firm bare thighs, but refrained.&nbsp; �Has anyone noticed that I loosened your collar?�&nbsp; He asked.&nbsp; This conversation was not the first &#8216;favour&#8217; he had done for her.

�No.�

Anton smiled.&nbsp; �Let me know if they do and I&#8217;ll loosen it for you again.�

Janet blushed pink again.&nbsp; �Thank you Mr Biggs� she whispered.

Anton patted her on the backside.&nbsp; �Back to work Janet.�

Thursday came and so did Jill&#8217;s nerves.&nbsp; &#8216;She&#8217;s not the sweat little girl you raised&#8217;, she told herself as she came home from work.&nbsp; The night before Jill had grounded Sophia with only slight provocation.&nbsp; The hours long tantrum Sophia performed did little to sway Jill&#8217;s mindset that she was making the right choice.&nbsp; Jill opened her front door to a cascade of Punk music echoing down the stairs.&nbsp; She never listened to the same album twice.&nbsp; If Sophia was grounded then she was going to make the house unbearable for Jill.&nbsp; Jill closed the door behind her and noticed all the lights in the house and the television were switched on.&nbsp; Sophia was playing a game of guerrilla warfare setting traps that would make Jill angrier and angrier, all this broke down what little sympathy for her daughter she had left.&nbsp; She put down her purse and briefcase by the door and started switching off the lights.&nbsp; The TV went off and Jill headed straight for the kitchen.&nbsp; Sophia only entered this room to take, without asking, whatever sustenance she felt the desire for.&nbsp; No matter how hard Jill tried she never got the right snacks or bread.&nbsp; Sophia&#8217;s tasted has constantly evolved to be disapproving of her mother&#8217;s shopping.

Jill made a quick check that the essentials for tonight were still in the pantry.&nbsp; She needn&#8217;t have.&nbsp; Sophia would not be interested in stuffing, garlic and butter.&nbsp; Things were in order so Jill took the can of Dr Pepper Cherry she had hidden in the fridge, Sophia&#8217;s favourite, and cracked the cold can open.&nbsp; She took out the vial of paralysis agent and tipped it into the can.&nbsp; She could have taken a moment to reflect on what she was doing, but she didn&#8217;t.&nbsp; Right now the worst that could happen was Anton arriving to Sophia in full rebellion and she didn&#8217;t like the thought of having to apologise after making her invitation so tempting.&nbsp; With deliberate steps she walked up the stairs towards Sophia&#8217;s room.

It seemed impossible but the music got even louder as she got closer.&nbsp; She knocked on Sophia&#8217;s door and pushed it ajar without waiting for reply.&nbsp; Sophia lay belly down on her bed reading a web page on her smart phone.&nbsp; She hadn&#8217;t heard Jill knock.&nbsp; Jill, camouflaged by the noise, walked over to the speaker and switched it off.&nbsp; Sophia snapped her head around and coiled like a cobra, her pretty eyes inherited from her mother flared angrily.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m sorry I grounded you Sophia.�&nbsp; Jill said.

Sophia&#8217;s eyes didn&#8217;t soften, but they did spy the can in her mother&#8217;s hand.&nbsp; �I was going to go see a movie.�&nbsp; Sophia snapped looking back at her mother.

&#8216;No she wasn&#8217;t&#8217; Jill knew.&nbsp; Sophia made sure she was always home on Thursdays to prevent Anton from staying over.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m sorry.&nbsp; I was unreasonable.�&nbsp; Jill said and the trap linked to the words made them seem eager.

Sophia, seeing her mother as weak, assumed the eagerness was for peace in the house.&nbsp; �Is that for me?�&nbsp; She asked looking at the can of Dr Pepper Cherry.

�Yes.� Jill said with a smile, her internal conflict was minimized by her situation with her daughter.&nbsp; &#8216;The future is not what it once was&#8217; she thought as she handed Sophia the can.

Sophia took it without saying thanks and sat up to drink it.&nbsp; She guzzled it down and didn&#8217;t notice her mother dip her head.&nbsp; It was so easy it should be illegal, but it was very legal and Sophia was so confident in ignorance of the protection her mother had sheltered her with.&nbsp; �You going out with Mr Boring Banker?� she asked finishing the can.

�No.�&nbsp; Jill answered and it was the truth, Anton was coming here.

�Good.�&nbsp; Sophia said.

�Why don&#8217;t you like Anton?� Jill asked, the deed done.

Sophia scrunched up her face.&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t know� Because he&#8217;s a creep.&nbsp; What&#8217;s for dinner?�&nbsp; The hand she was holding the empty can with suddenly twitched and the purple aluminium fell to the floor.&nbsp; Sophia seemed to realise the action was involuntary was tried to open and close her hand.&nbsp; All she got was a couple of minor twitches.&nbsp; She cried out a concerned sign, not yet aware of the betrayal.

�Is something wrong Sophia?�&nbsp; Jill asked knowing.

�My hand��&nbsp; Sophia tried her other hand she looked concerned at her mother, but was met with the reveal.&nbsp; �Mommy?!�

Jill stepped forward and sat beside her daughter on her bed.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m sorry sweaty.&nbsp; You&#8217;re not emancipated� and you&#8217;re what I&#8217;m having for dinner.�&nbsp; Jill put her arm around her helpless daughter&#8217;s shoulders, turned her head and kissed her goodbye.

As Anton pulled up at the house he took his usual cautionary glance at Sophia&#8217;s window.&nbsp; The light was off.&nbsp; Either Jill had sent her off or he would be forced to sit with her as they waited in awkward silence waiting for dinner.&nbsp; He loved Jill, he truly did, but of late he wondered� should he just settle down and make the best of it, or should be call it off and go back to spreading his seed at the Consigned girls whose services could be bought for pocket change, but came with no baggage.&nbsp; He straightened his tie and got out of his vehicle.&nbsp; The porch light was on and guided him to the door.&nbsp; In a very boring manner he knocked on the door and waited for it to be answered.

A sultry sweet smell greeted him as Jill opened the door and smiled.&nbsp; �Hello stranger� she said with an inviting smile reserved for privacy.

Anton did not hear the usual loud music filling the house and Jill was at ease despite having a guest in her home.&nbsp; �You sent her out didn&#8217;t you?�&nbsp; He started and then had to exclaim.&nbsp; �What smells so good?�

Jill played with the breast of Anton&#8217;s suit.&nbsp; It was already perfect she just wanted to fuss over him.&nbsp; �Sophia is here and will join us for dinner� As for what smells so good� she leaned forward and kissed him.&nbsp; �That&#8217;s a surprise.�

Anton frowned.&nbsp; Somehow Jill had taken back control of her house.&nbsp; �Right� he said eyeing her suspiciously.&nbsp; �So if you&#8217;re cooking what am I supposed to do then?�

�Watch TV.&nbsp; Watch whatever you like.�&nbsp; She turned and strutted back to her kitchen.

Anton was confused.&nbsp; He never got to watch what he wanted in Jill&#8217;s house.&nbsp; Sophia usually made an appearance to change the channel as soon as he was settled.&nbsp; He sat on the sofa and clicked the remote.&nbsp; The news came on; the news started.&nbsp; He looked around for Sophia to make an appearance and ruin his impending meditation on world events.&nbsp; �How&#8217;d she do it?�&nbsp; He wondered.&nbsp; The sweet savoury smell bellowed from the kitchen and as the news drew to a close he was salivating in expectation.&nbsp; 

Jill made an appearance right on seven.&nbsp; �Go wash up.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t want you to see dinner till it&#8217;s been bought out.�

�Jill��

�Go Mr, you&#8217;re not in charge tonight� yet.�&nbsp; Jill pointed to the downstairs bathroom and her partner turned not wanting to ruin the jovial mood she was in.&nbsp; He was definitely going to get lucky tonight.&nbsp; As he emerged from the bathroom the smell revealed itself and he smiled

�Jill how could you afford a Spit-Muffin.&nbsp; She&#8217;s perfect, she must have set you back at least three weeks��&nbsp; He stopped mid-sentence as he walked towards the table.&nbsp; Sophia lay on a silver tray, golden brown, eyes closed as if she were sleeping.&nbsp; Her chest shallowly rose and fell and she smelled and looked so� �I didn&#8217;t know you knew how to cook?�&nbsp; Was all he could think to say, still in disbelief?&nbsp; &#8216;Had Jill actually cooked her own daughter to serve to him?&#8217;

Jill didn&#8217;t pick up on Anton&#8217;s reservations.&nbsp; �You learn to cook when you&#8217;re the only A student in a house of six girls.�&nbsp; She said as if it were nothing.

Anton wanted to say &#8216;Are you sure?&#8217; or &#8216;She&#8217;s your only daughter!&#8217; but the words didn&#8217;t come out.&nbsp; He looked at the young, barely legal, girl laying on the table, a red apple in her mouth.&nbsp; He looked at her graceful, toned legs; her flat teasing belling; and her ample inviting breasts.&nbsp; Beyond his belief in family and loyalty Anton knew he very much didn&#8217;t want to let this meal go to waste.&nbsp; There was a morbid security in knowing Jill loved him so much she would serve him her only daughter.

Jill had waited long enough.&nbsp; �Let&#8217;s eat� she offered and surrendered the evening to Anton.

Anton crept to the table.&nbsp; When he had first gone out with Jill he had taken her to a Japanese restaurant that served live girl-meat to impress her.&nbsp; To Anton, the suffering of the Japanese girl had been a divine compliment to a fine meal.&nbsp; Jill had not protested the delicacy offer, but had seemed hesitant.&nbsp; Now she took the polar opposite position.&nbsp; Anton struggled for words.&nbsp; �You had sisters?�

Jill sat opposite him, the divine scent and inviting body between them.&nbsp; �Five.�&nbsp; She had never mentioned them.&nbsp; �Sole survivor I&#8217;m afraid.�&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t seem to have any conflict with the issue.

�You don&#8217;t miss them?�&nbsp; He felt he had to ask.

�It always came with an easing of the burden on my family.�&nbsp; Jill smiled faintly.&nbsp; �Less mouths to feed more treats for the survivors.�&nbsp; Jill gave him a look that spelled out &#8216;No more small talk Mister&#8217; and Anton looked for his utensils.&nbsp; �No cutlery.&nbsp; We use her hands� and as if aware at his hesitation she raised up Sophia elegant forearm in her hands and bit down on it like a drum stick.

Anton felt his member stiffen and he shuffled in his seat.&nbsp; With Jill taking the first bight he suddenly realised this was &#8216;Ok&#8217;.&nbsp; Sophia was offered up to him, he needn&#8217;t show respect or back away from conflict with his lover&#8217;s daughter.&nbsp; Jill had chosen him.&nbsp; As Jill nibbled away at Sophia&#8217;s arms to cooked girls eyes fluttered open as if she had been stirred from a deep sleep.&nbsp; The apple in her mouth prevented any outcry other than a dim moan that might accompany stretching.&nbsp; Her eyes shifted to her mother, taking playful bights on her arm, but no alarm sounded in her eyes.&nbsp; She was dazed and the cooking had dimmed her mind.&nbsp; Sophia was only faintly aware she was being eaten.&nbsp; Member as stiff as it could get Anton cropped his head to the perfectly shaped thigh and took his first bight.

He took the bight with his eyes closed and it was like a warm kiss.&nbsp; The skin gave way and as his teeth dug into Sophia&#8217;s flesh juices, rich and hearty, flooded into his mouth.&nbsp; He found himself giving a whimper as a tiny amount of ejaculate escaped his rigid shaft.&nbsp; Sophia was delicious.

�Oh no�, Jill said with playful domination.&nbsp; �The bits around the stuffing are the best parts.�

Anton looked up at Jill who was whipping her mouth with a napkin after her innocent bights.&nbsp; Anton didn&#8217;t follow at first, then he realised by following Jill&#8217;s eyes.&nbsp; Sophia&#8217;s sex was steaming and carefully placed stuffing filled it to brim.&nbsp; The young, perfect sex of Sophia lay before him and his partner was insisting he taste it.&nbsp; Anton stood up and leant over the steaming body.&nbsp; Jill was silent.&nbsp; The only noise in the room was Sophia&#8217;s gentle whimpers as she battled for consciousness through her cooked brain.&nbsp; Anton took in the sceptical and then teased a bit.&nbsp; The portion was so delicate he took little nibbled and Jill did the same to Sophia&#8217;s firm breasts.


***


Anton rolled of Jill, the excitement of dinner causing their bout to end too quickly.&nbsp; Jill didn&#8217;t judge.&nbsp; It seemed that she would never judge again.&nbsp; She snuggled into Anton as he caught his breath and patted the hairs on his chest.&nbsp; Anton just wanted to meditate and get his sex hard again, but he felt obligated to say something to Jill.

�You are a very good cook�, he said between pants for air.

�There&#8217;ll be left overs for breakfast.�&nbsp; Jill offered.&nbsp; They&#8217;d left Sophia in a half-eaten daze lying on the dinning room table.&nbsp; She would most likely pass away in the night but her meat would still be fresh in the morning.

�I&#8217;ll have to work up an appetite.�&nbsp; Anton said and prayed for a quick refraction of his member.&nbsp; One round hadn&#8217;t nearly sated his repressed apatite.&nbsp; Whilst hungry and in lust he made the mistake of looking at Jill.&nbsp; Her breast were still firm; one of her long legs was draped over him and her jogging made it shapely and� he looked at her neck, graceful and elegant.&nbsp; The fine muscle pulsated as she shock her hair.&nbsp; He felt a pang he had not associated with Jill yet.&nbsp; His penis stiffened slightly and he leant forward and playfully bit Jill&#8217;s shoulder.&nbsp; 

Jill chuckled, ignorant of his train of thought.&nbsp; �If you&#8217;re still hungry we can go back down stairs� she offered.

The rest of his erection was a no brainer as he made love bights on her body from neck to belly; from belly too, &#8216;Hello&#8217;.&nbsp; She was still moist from their first meeting of the evening.&nbsp; He was in her immediately and Jill let out a gasp of delighted shock.

After every round of sex Anton fell back on the fantasy of devouring Jill and they spent the entire evening wrapped around each other.&nbsp; Despite his orgasms, Anton never felt the satisfaction and completeness it usually bought.

�Mr Biggs?&nbsp; Mr Biggs?�&nbsp; Janet stood in the office.&nbsp; She&#8217;d knocked and waited, but as she had to meet criteria set couldn&#8217;t really afford for Mr Biggs not to sign the documents.&nbsp; 

Anton Biggs was staring out his window, lost in a fantasy of Jill slowly turning on a spit.&nbsp; Her long legs and flat belly twitched in the radiant heat and glistened with oil.

Janet started to feel a little frantic.&nbsp; If she didn&#8217;t get Mr Biggs to sign the document and then get then down to legal by eleven Claudia would report her� again.&nbsp; Janet didn&#8217;t know how many times it would take till Goldman and Sachs pulled the plug on her reprieve.&nbsp; In desperation she dropped the stack of papers in the centre of Anton&#8217;s desk with a &#8216;smack&#8217; sound.&nbsp; It worked.&nbsp; Anton blinked back to reality and seemed to take in the scene.

�Janet?�&nbsp; He said baffled.&nbsp; His eyes darted up and down the perfect specimen of an educated Redhead.

The urgency in Janet&#8217;s voice was not masked.&nbsp; �Could you please get these signed.&nbsp; I have to drop them off at legal in two minutes.�

Anton was back.&nbsp; �I wanted to discuss them with you�, he asserted.

Janet cringed her face.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m sorry Mr Biggs, but Claudia at legal has it in for me and��&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t get to finish.

Anton picked up the phone and dialled legal.&nbsp; After requesting the Desk phone of Claudia Black he greeted her politely, �Anton Biggs from Futures here.&nbsp; Listen, I was hoping I could delay Janet for a couple of hours without you making a complaint.�

Janet didn&#8217;t know what Claudia was saying at the other end.

�I realise that Claudia�, Anton replied �but she was sentenced to consignment because of her talents.&nbsp; I&#8217;d rather not let them go to waste.�&nbsp; Claudia obviously annoyed hung up, but Anton had won.&nbsp; As he placed his phone down he turned to Janet.&nbsp; �Now, what can you tell me about the Cyanides Portfolio?�&nbsp; His eyes drifted to her pushed up breasts in a flimsy shirt.

�Cyanides principle development is in��

�Just surmise please.�&nbsp; Anton said with a dismissive wave of his hand.

�Broad investments with low risk.&nbsp; They have a down turn coming and they know it.&nbsp; They&#8217;re not risking in hopes of making back their deficit though so I&#8217;d say they&#8217;re hiding behind sensible business practise to let their share price lower.&nbsp; There&#8217;s obviously a wanted take over in the works and their preparing for it.�&nbsp; Janet ignored Anton taking another slow appraising look of her figure and stood straight.

�Do you think with this take over their share price will recover?�

Janet was about to start another comprehensive assessment, but caught the look in Anton&#8217;s eyes.&nbsp; �Yes.�

�Good.�&nbsp; Anton said.

Janet leaned forward to recapture Anton&#8217;s attention as he turned away.&nbsp; �Are you going to use this inside knowledge to aid other portfolios?�

Anton ignored her at first and started signing the documents.&nbsp; �Janet, I&#8217;ve bought you two hours before you have to have these at legal.&nbsp; Why don&#8217;t you get us both Cappuccinos and join me for a break.�

Janet didn&#8217;t get breaks.&nbsp; �Um! Ok?�&nbsp; She said a little anxious.&nbsp; She set about her task.&nbsp; The heels made it difficult to navigate the busy office until she made it back to Anton&#8217;s office.&nbsp; He smiled at her as a friend as she placed the coffees down.

�Janet I wanted to ask you some questions and given your situation you have an interest perspective...�

Janet nodded and listened.&nbsp; If she pleased Mt Biggs, really made him happy, he might even see to it that she was liberated.

�There is a woman I am particularly taken with.&nbsp; Lately I&#8217;ve been finding myself compelled by my appetite though.�

Janet both blushed and went ghostly pale at the same time.&nbsp; Her hands started to shake violently and she felt the warm fires and the cold blade of the butchers lapping around her body.

Anton watched this and then realised his fopaux.&nbsp; �Oh no Janet.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not talking about you.�&nbsp; He smiled apologetically.

Janet&#8217;s worst fears coming so close to a reality, even through misunderstanding took its toll and the girl went to pieces.&nbsp; She hutched forward and started crying.

�Janet, no.&nbsp; Oh come now Janet.�&nbsp; Anton leant forward and took both her shaking hands.&nbsp; �Come now Janet.&nbsp; I wouldn&#8217;t have saved you if I wanted to eat you.�

Janet calmed.&nbsp; The brief tears stopped and she forced herself to composure.&nbsp; She straightened herself and looked Anton in the eyes.

�Can you love someone and ask to eat them Janet?�&nbsp; He asked as the pretty Redhead wiped her tears away.

�No!� Janet said speaking the descending view at the current state of Society.

It was this kind of attitude Anton knew Society ignored.&nbsp; Those condemned still had feelings and the urge to escape their sentence.

Janet&#8217;s survival instinct kicked in.&nbsp; Her previous words had been an expression of her prolonged sentence, now she spoke from Anton&#8217;s point of view; the contemporary view.&nbsp; �But it doesn&#8217;t matter.&nbsp; The suffering of the few doesn&#8217;t out way the rights of the many.&nbsp; If I were you�� Janet inhaled so as not to choke on her words, �I&#8217;d marry her.&nbsp; Then you own her and whatever views she holds on the matter are null and void.�&nbsp; Janet looked at him having delivered what he wanted to hear.

Anton eyes sparkled at the suggestion.&nbsp; �You&#8217;re a remarkable young woman Janet�, he said, but thought &#8216;If only I owned this filly.&#8217;&nbsp; He moved on from his contemplation.&nbsp; �Relax, finish your coffee.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll take these down to legal for you.�&nbsp; He flicked through and singed the paperwork before collecting it and heading for the office door.&nbsp; �I like you Janet.�&nbsp; He said as he opened his door.&nbsp; �Don&#8217;t worry Janet, I&#8217;m going to keep you close for quite a while yet.�

If Jill had of known Sophia&#8217;s presence had repressed Anton so greatly she might have sent her to boarding school years ago.&nbsp; There was a nice Prep School in-state that brainwashed girls into thinking being eaten was their life&#8217;s goal.&nbsp; Anton had been insatiable all week ever since tasting the forbidden flesh of Sophia, even to the extent they had visited a motel during working hours.&nbsp; They both fudged it on their timesheets as a meeting.&nbsp; Jill was so taken by hunger that Anton took her with she failed to notice the once many kisses had turned to playful bights as Anton stayed hard by imagining Jill taking Sophia&#8217;s place on the dinner table; a bounty and feast in one, begging to be tasted.

As they walked up the steps to their Thursday night regular Jill didn&#8217;t notice the chalk board that read, &#8216;Last days of Special: Rose cooked to order.&#8217;&nbsp; Rose greeted them at the door and either the short duration to her liberation or practise had made her more competent.&nbsp; She seated the couple in their regular seats and went about her rounds, unaware of Anton&#8217;s sideways glance at her young legs in her tiny black skirt.

�I knew you&#8217;d learn to like this place.�&nbsp; Jill boasted.

Anton turned to her and smiled.&nbsp; He did like this place, now.&nbsp; He leaned forward and took both of Jill&#8217;s available hands.&nbsp; He squeezed them tightly.&nbsp; �I got you a two weeks off work starting tomorrow.� He said and looked for a reaction.

�Anton!�&nbsp; Jill protested.&nbsp; �I was saving my leave for Christmas.�&nbsp; She was annoyed.&nbsp; Anton never took liberties without asking permission.&nbsp; Even if he wanted anal, he asked.&nbsp; Jill frowned at him, annoyed.

�Let me explain honey.�&nbsp; He started

�You&#8217;d better.�

Anton was going to love the next bit.&nbsp; �We need the time for our honeymoon.�&nbsp; He waited for the reaction.

�Anton, quit clowning around, I��&nbsp; Jill saw Anton pull the jewel box out of his pocket and open it before her.&nbsp; �Oh Anton!�&nbsp; Jill pulled her hands to her mouth and watched in disbelief.&nbsp; �Yes I will marry you Anton Biggs�.&nbsp; She finally got to say.

Anton didn&#8217;t even get to place the ring on her finger.&nbsp; Jill leaped forward and grabbed his tie, pulling him in for a kiss.&nbsp; It was a moment of pure joy for Jill as finally she had what she wanted.&nbsp; Getting rid of Sophia was the best thing she had ever done.

In a classic sign that she had not yet fully adapted to her role, Rose came forward with pen and paper to take there order, ruining another moment of intimacy.&nbsp; Anton only had to look at Jill with a twinkle in his eyes to receive the nod from Jill, granting him permission to order something special for tonight.

Anton smiled.&nbsp; �How are you Rose?�&nbsp; He asked, delaying it.

�Fine.� Rose replied casually thinking they were a safe couple.&nbsp; �What would you like this evening?�&nbsp; If she&#8217;d been sharp she would have realised they hadn&#8217;t looked at their menus yet.

�Rose, if it is at all possible I would like to have a look at your Prime Fillet.�

Rose started to pen Anton&#8217;s order then froze.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t move an inch.

�Rose?�&nbsp; Anton asked.

Rose started breathing deeply and rapidly.

�Rose sweaty, come back to use.&nbsp; We want to make an order.�&nbsp; Jill pitched in.&nbsp; Usually she was merciful, but she had just landed a husband.

�No.�&nbsp; Rose squeaked at them.&nbsp; �No, please don&#8217;t.&nbsp; I only have two days left.�&nbsp; She scrunched up her face as she spoke and looked at them.

Anton shook his head indicating they would not change their order.&nbsp; �Rose.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t make me call the manager over.�

A tear ran down Rose&#8217;s check.&nbsp; She fumbled with the pen, as if she was going to finish his order, then realised he wanted to see it first.&nbsp; She placed the pen and pad on the table and lifted her skirt.

It was shaven and neat.&nbsp; A pretty cunt.&nbsp; Anton reached forward and tested her flesh.&nbsp; �Supple�, he commented.

Rose sobbed.

Anton fingertip now explored her sex.&nbsp; He was delighted but how fresh it was.&nbsp; �Yes, very nice�, he added.&nbsp; �Medium rare and stuffed with bread crumbs and garlic.�&nbsp; The garlic used on Sophia was quite exquisite.&nbsp; He hoped to capture the same flavour.&nbsp; He turned to Jill.&nbsp; �And what would the future Mrs Biggs like?� he asked and let Rose&#8217;s skirt fall back to modesty.

�Could you please show me your belly Rose?�&nbsp; Jill said politely.

Rose was visibly crying now.&nbsp; By some morbid surrender she still complied though, lifting up her shirt to reveal and tender tenderloin.

�Hmmm� Jill sounded.&nbsp; �Very nice.&nbsp; Grilled, marinated in plum sauce and served with the spinach salad as a side.

Rose despite the sentence stood immobile for a few moments.&nbsp; It was obvious she was dealing with her fate.

�Rose sweaty.�&nbsp; Jill broached.&nbsp; �These are terminal cuts.&nbsp; It&#8217;ll be quick.�&nbsp; They were words of sympathy and seemed to have an effect.&nbsp; Rose turned to leave.&nbsp; Realised she had forgotten her notebook of orders; collected it; wrote down the couples orders; and slowly walked towards the kitchen.

�Poor thing.�&nbsp; Jill pondered.

Anton was already salivating at the thought of the meal.&nbsp; As Jill turned back to him he slipped the ring on her finger.&nbsp; She smiled politely and examined it to tease him.&nbsp; �It was my mother&#8217;s�, he said to add value to it.

�It&#8217;s gorgeous.� Jill complemented and leaned forward to kiss him again.&nbsp; 

Anton accepted the kiss.&nbsp; �We elope tonight� and tomorrow we meet at the airport for our honeymoon.�&nbsp; Anton had a small affair to attend once they were legally bound.

Jill smiled.&nbsp; �Where are we going?�&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t care that Anton was rushing things, she just wanted him.

Anton kissed her.&nbsp; �It&#8217;s a surprise.�


***


Anton had only left Jill for a couple of hours the next morning.&nbsp; Jill thought he was packing.&nbsp; In reality he had to make a quick stop off at the marital booth at the Registration Office.&nbsp; By an unknown coincidence he had gotten Doris as his clerk.&nbsp; Either she didn&#8217;t notice, or didn&#8217;t care, that Jill&#8217;s name popped up.&nbsp; Anton rushed up to her.&nbsp; She was wearing a red cocktail dress, short hem, low cut.&nbsp; �You look incredible�, he said.&nbsp; &#8216;And delicious&#8217; he thought.&nbsp; She straightened his suit as she always did.

�I know we&#8217;re going to Japan.�&nbsp; She said with her inviting smile.&nbsp; �It&#8217;s on the ticket.�

�Yes, but where in Japan Mrs Biggs.�&nbsp; He kissed her.

She fell into his arms and conformed to his frame.&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t care.&nbsp; I just want to spend the next two weeks with you.�

Anton smiled lovingly.


***


Anton had a town car waiting, the Gentleman that he was.&nbsp; Jill looked out the window at the busy streets bustling with people, everyone neat and travelling with purpose.&nbsp; As she watched the Japanese people Anton leaned over the middle space and kissed her shoulder at first.&nbsp; The playful bights followed and Jill relaxed into his admiration.&nbsp; Life was, and would be from here on out, perfect.

Two hours saw them travel from built up neon lights to cubicle apartments and finally trees and grass started to emerge.&nbsp; Japans brief country crept up around the town car windows and the road started to climb.&nbsp; �You going to tell me where we&#8217;re going?�&nbsp; Jill asked turning to her famished husband.

�A very special retreat.�&nbsp; Anton said and kissed her on the cheek.&nbsp; Having won her attention after the long tease of denial he relaxed back to his seat.

Jill turned her body towards him.&nbsp; �No skimping on extravagance.&nbsp; I want to be pampered.�&nbsp; She was teasing again.&nbsp; She liked teasing him, more so now they belonged to each other.

�You will be the centre of attention I promise.�&nbsp; Anton smiled at her hungrily.

They turned off the single lane highway up a parade of cherry blossoms.&nbsp; Above the trees a traditional Japanese palace with its criss-cross frames and paper window emerged.&nbsp; Jill smiled to herself and indulged in her immanent pamper.&nbsp; As they pulled up out front two bell boys in yellow suits came forward, one to open the door for Jill, the other to get the suitcases from the boot.&nbsp; Jill stepped out and the bell boy guided her with bows to the entrance.&nbsp; She waited for Anton who circled the car.

�It&#8217;ll do.� Jill wasn&#8217;t going to ease up on her playful mood.&nbsp; The feudal palace was beyond elegant and very exotic to Westerners.&nbsp; Jill started up the stairs leaving her husband to follow, hoping her long legs were giving him a good show.&nbsp; The bell boy ran around and opened the door for her.&nbsp; She entered followed by Anton.&nbsp; Anton finally caught up and kissed her softly on the cheek.&nbsp; As Jill hung back and saw her luggage head to the elevator Anton checked in.&nbsp; More bows from reception and they were clear to follow their bags.&nbsp; The elevator gave away the steel framework of the building and they went up two levels.&nbsp; A few people walked the halls, but all kept to themselves save the lustful looks directed at Jill.&nbsp; She imagined she was quite exotic to them, something to be desired.&nbsp; The room they were led into was spacious and had the same paper walls of the exterior.&nbsp; Jill waited till the short bell boy exited before commenting.&nbsp; �Aren&#8217;t our neighbours going to hear us?�&nbsp; She was merely testing for a reaction.

�I want them too.�&nbsp; Anton said, and as the door closed behind the bell boy and leaped at her kissing her passionately and desperately trying to rip her clothes off.&nbsp; A Town hall wedding meant restraint, but they were no longer surrendered by plane passengers and passers-by.&nbsp; Jill conceded and pulled her clothes away, only tugging at Anton when she was stripped down to her panties.&nbsp; They barely made it to the bed.

Jill lay, her legs comfortably wrapped around her consummated husbands.&nbsp; She had warmth between her legs and a spin in her light head.&nbsp; She snuggled into Anton&#8217;s shoulder.&nbsp; Anton was looking up at the ceiling.&nbsp; He glanced across at the clock in the room; 6:59pm.&nbsp; The second hand was rounding up to the six.&nbsp; �Jill.� He said calmly.&nbsp; �I want you to know that I really do love you.�&nbsp; The second hand started to climb.

Jill smiled and put her arm around him, now snuggling into him.&nbsp; �I love you too.�

There was a knock on the door the moment the hand flicked to twelve.&nbsp; They did not wait for an answer but came in; a plump man in chef whites and a strong muscular man in a black T-shirt and jeans.

Jill startled and sat up in the bed quickly grabbing the sheets to cover herself.&nbsp; Anton sat up, not uncomfortable with his nudity.&nbsp; He smiled at the man in white.&nbsp; �Konichiwa.�&nbsp; Anton bowed and smiled at the plump fluid man.&nbsp; 

The man bowed back, but said nothing.&nbsp; The man in black honed in on Jill.&nbsp; She screamed as he reached for her twisting her arm.&nbsp; �ANTON!!� she cried and the protective sheet fell away.&nbsp; The man dressed in black quickly secured both her hands behind her back and Jill started to kick out.&nbsp; Through experience the muscle man clasped Jill&#8217;s naked and wet from sex body into submission.&nbsp; She tried to head but him backwards but he found a pressure point and exploited it.&nbsp; As Jill cried out in confusion and pain Anton spoke to the Chef.

�Here is my paper work.�&nbsp; He hand Jill&#8217;s consignment notice to the chef gentleman and waited as he checked it.&nbsp; �She needs to last the entire two weeks.&nbsp; Parts of her at a time only and I wish to have her company when I dine.�

The chef handed back Jill&#8217;s death note and nodded firmly in understanding.&nbsp; The man dressed in black watched the exchange and as it quickly drew to a conclusion he started dragging Jill out of the safety of their suite and towards to hall and elevator that led to the kitchen.

�Anton.�&nbsp; Jill pleaded, betrayal in her eyes.

Anton looked at her and was a little sad the next meeting would be to eat a superfluous part of her.&nbsp; The chef would remove and prepare parts of Jill over the coming weeks and Anton would be afford the opportunity to savour Jill throughout their honeymoon.

As if in reflection on seeing the hurt in Jill&#8217;s eyes Anton urged the chef.&nbsp; �Please used pain killers.&nbsp; She is my wife and I don&#8217;t want her to suffer.�&nbsp; The chef nodded and Jill&#8217;s please were replaced with a look of terror at Anton as he salivated as she was carried away.


***

July meant overtime, deadlines and performance reviews.&nbsp; Anton straighten his suit and head through the desks of the masses that supported Management.&nbsp; With nods of recognition and a few smiled for the more attractive clerks he headed to the conference room.&nbsp; He checked his watch and knocked on the door.

�Enter.� Sounded and Anton turned the nob.

Keith Strange and Bill Baxter sat behind the conference table.&nbsp; Both rose as Anton closed the door.

�Anton, how are keeping.�&nbsp; Keith said shaking Anton&#8217;s hand.&nbsp; The sentiment was followed by Bill.

�Anton.&nbsp; Congratulations� and commiserations.�&nbsp; He gave Anton a look of smiling sympathy.

�Thank you Bill.�&nbsp; Anton said and tried not to think of the first night.&nbsp; Jill had been strapped to a table and gagged.&nbsp; They were always gagged on the first night.&nbsp; Anton had kissed her next and breasts before he had tasted
 the spicy dish made from her severed feet.&nbsp; Her stubs at the end of her beautiful legs stitched in a pattern.&nbsp; She had been delicious and he almost wanted to ask for more of her to be taken that very first night.

�She was a remarkable woman Anton.&nbsp; We missed her around here.�&nbsp; Keith followed Bill&#8217;s condolences his canines slightly showing as he kept his mouth passive.

By the fourth serving the chef had decided Jill would not beg and scream.&nbsp; She had broken quickly and Anton almost missed his little tease, always so eager to test him.&nbsp; But all she did was stared at him, broken heart, impending horrors to await.&nbsp; Her hands were gone and so was one of her calves and forearms.&nbsp; Tomorrow they would remove her kidney and serve it in soup.&nbsp; Anton had stroked her belly when finished.&nbsp; The Palaces concubines saw to treating the arousal each meal brought him.

�Thank you for your thoughts gentlemen.�&nbsp; Anton said and gave an appreciative smile.&nbsp; I must say, my own loss aside, the office has missed her.�

�Was it quick�, Bill enquired.&nbsp; He had secretly admired Jill and there was compassion beyond lust in his voice.

By night ten Jill had slipped into delirium and fever.&nbsp; So much had been taken, all that remained was her left thigh.&nbsp; Her muscle and shapely, remaining, stem offer a couple more feed before the fatal cuts came into play.&nbsp; As Anton held a shaved strip of the meat to Jill&#8217;s lips she had, though new trust formed in torment, tasted herself and with a sigh conceded sweet taste.

�She found piece in it.�&nbsp; Anton admitted.&nbsp; �I will missed her.�

Keith sat forward with energy changing to tempo.&nbsp; �Well Anton� Your department&#8217;s performance this year had been exemplary.�&nbsp; He sat back, brief review given.

Bill chimed in.&nbsp; �Your play on Cyanide was brilliant.�

�Well�, Anton conceded.&nbsp; �I just tipped of brokerage to the play.�

�And we&#8217;re glad you did.&nbsp; You&#8217;re a team player.�&nbsp; Keith settled down.

Bill flicked through Anton&#8217;s impressive revenue sheet and as there was nothing to be critical of he skipped to the end.&nbsp; Anton sat, hands folded waiting more.

�Bottom line is you&#8217;re getting your bonus, in full.&nbsp; The only reason we could have for not recommending you for advancement is we would need to find someone as talented to replace you.�

Anton brushed over the compliment.&nbsp; His final night with Jill her chest and belly had been glazed and grilled and he had lovingly kissed her failing lips good-bye.&nbsp; She was the love of his life, but now he needed someone to fill the space their honeymoon had left in his life.

�Gentlemen.&nbsp; If I may be so bold.�&nbsp; Anton politely made his request.&nbsp; �Instead of a cash bonus this year, I was wondering if the company would see fit to sign Janet over to my custody.&nbsp; She&#8217;s a remarkable young woman and I&#8217;d really like to take more advantage of her bountiful assets.�

Anton smiled back at the gentlemen who were his bosses.
