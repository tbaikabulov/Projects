VIRTUAL MASTER

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Prologue

&nbsp;

����������� Steffi groaned aloud with passion, and ground herself down
even further on the erect cock of J. Harris Faverington
III, a distinguished looking, silver-haired gentleman of some 58 years.

����������� Steffi Williams was a good 30 years younger than Mr. Faverington.� Her
long chestnut hair was unbound, and her pale skin flushed with the exertion of
her sexual exercises.� She was the very
picture of erotic perfection, and, more to the point, she knew it.

����������� But
Ms. Williams was no high-class escort.� No indeed.� Ms.
Williams was an Ivy-league educated attorney with the prestigious firm of
Duncan and Waters, and she was used to getting what she wanted, when she
wanted.

����������� At
the firm, she was known as a hard-charger, a woman who always knew that the job
came first.� One look at her gym-toned
body, draped in the finest Italian business suits cut just above the knee, and
her colleagues, male and female, knew that here was a true Alpha female.� With the best education, fluent in three
languages, and with money in the bank to spare, Steffi
was destined for the very top.

����������� Under
her clothes, she wore the finest silks and satins.� Nothing but silk stockings touched her legs,
which were waxed weekly at La Bellisima Salon.� 

����������� At
28, Ms. Williams was happy with her life.�
She would prefer it if her boyfriend, the investment banker Campbell
Mitchell, would hurry up and pop the question.�
Too many of her friends were able to run about showing off their
large-carat diamond rings.� She toyed
idly at times with the idea of denying her sexual favors to Campbell, but knew
that it was for the best if she allied herself with the powerful Mitchell
family.� Campbell�s
uncle, Thomas Mitchell, was one of the partners at Duncan and Waters, and Steffi knew that when she came up for partnership in a
couple of years, being related to Thomas might make all the difference.� That is how Steffi
thought, and that is how she calculated her decisions in life.

����������� Still,
to an outside observer, Steffi Williams would seem
lucky.� She lived alone in a beautiful
two-bedroom condo on the 28th floor of a downtown skyscraper.� She had money to spare, and most of all, she
had good looks.� Her stomach was flatter
than an 18-year-olds, and her 36C breasts were still firm and pointed.

����������� 

����������� Steffi increased the pace of her fucking, pushing off the
firm mattress and rubbing her clitoris against Faverington�s
pubic bone.� He was going red in the face
from the effort, and she knew that within moments he was going to shoot.� She stole a glance at herself in the mirror
behind his bed, and stifled a giggle at the sight.� If she continued like this, Mr. Faverington would be sure to continue working with Duncan
and Waters.� CEO of a Fortune 500
Company, Mr. Faverington controlled assets greater
than $300 million.� If Duncan and Waters
could land this contract, through her efforts, then she would be guaranteed a
partner slot, not to mention a very fat bonus at the end of the year.

&nbsp;

����������� When
she saw that Mr. Faverington was attracted to her at
an initial client meeting, Steffi barely hesitated to
let him �seduce� her.� What was one
evening of clinically faked passion in return for such professional
advantages?� Besides, Steffi
considered herself to be highly sexual, and enjoyed a
fling now and then.

&nbsp;

����������� In
fact, she could feel an orgasm building inside of her now, and she increased
her pace in an effort to cum at the same time as her client.� Within moments, she felt Mr. Faverington swell inside of her.� With a shout, he ejaculated deep inside of
her.� She let herself go, and orgasmed strongly, the walls of her vagina pulsating
against Faverington�s dick as she collapsed in a
sweaty heap across his chest.� 

&nbsp;

����������� As
she drifted off to sleep, Steffi smiled at the last
words Mr. Faverington had murmured in her ear � �If
that is an example of Duncan and
Waters� client care, consider yourself hired.�

&nbsp;

Chapter One

One Week Later

&nbsp;

����������� Steffi Williams arrived home from work at 8:30 PM on a Friday in June � June 28 -- and
poured herself a quick drink.� Kicking
off her 4� Balenciaga heels, she sat down in the
rolling chair that stood in front of her new IBM laptop and fired up the
computer, hoping to see an e-mail from Campbell
inviting her out to the Islands for the weekend.� She logged on to her personal e-mail, and saw
that one message was waiting.� It wasn�t
from Campbell though � it was from
an e-mail address she did not recognize:�
VM@gmale.com.� At first she was inclined to erase it as yet
another example of spam, but stopped when she saw that it had a large
attachment, and was addressed to her by name.�
Curious, she opened it.

&nbsp;

To: SWilliams@wahoo.com

From: VM@gmale.com

Subject:� You should read this tonight, Steffi

&nbsp;

My Dear Steffi,

����������� It
has been a few years since law school, hasn�t it?� Yet I hope you still remember some of the
rules regarding professional conduct of the legal profession.� At the very least, my dear, I hope you
remember the rules regarding sexual relations with current and prospective
clients �

&nbsp;

����������� Steffi turned pale, and could feel her pulse racing.� Of course she remembered this rule.� Her friends used to joke about it � you were
allowed to sleep with clients � if you had been sleeping with them before they
became your clients.� Otherwise, your
actions were unprofessional, and you could be disbarred � kicked out of the
profession forever.� Duncan and Waters was well known in the legal community for being very strict
about the ethical conduct of their employees.�
If this became known, Steffi was doomed.� Even if she could avoid disbarment, her job
at the firm was almost certainly in jeopardy.�
Unwilling to read further, Steffi nevertheless
turned her glance back to the screen.

&nbsp;

����������� That�s
right.� You�ve been a naughty girl.� And I know what you�re thinking � how do I
know?� No, I�m not Mr. Faverington.

����������� And
no, you won�t be able to lie or bluster your way out of this one.� Why don�t you click on the attachment and see
why not?

&nbsp;

����������� Steffi did so, and paused for a second, praying with her
eyes shut, while the computer downloaded and virus-checked a picture file.� When she opened her eyes, her worst nightmare
was coming true � there on the screen was her flushed body, nude, arcing back
in sexual ecstasy atop a recognizable Mr. Faverington.� Steffi realized
quickly from the angle that the photo had been taken through the mirror behind Faverington�s bed.�
Beginning to cry, she clicked back on the dreadful e-mail.

&nbsp;

����������� Now
you have seen yourself, my dear.� You are
very attractive.� And yes, I have many
photos, along with a movie of the evening in question.

����������� I
would hate to see you lose your job, your boyfriend, or your career over
this.� But what can you do for me to
ensure that this kind of conduct won�t repeat itself?� I don�t want money, and I don�t want you �
not directly.� 

����������� Right
now you are probably thinking about blackmail.�
But do you know who I am?� No, you
don�t.� What you should know is that if
you do not log on to Y-Chat by 9 PM
tonight, I will e-mail these photos and the movie to the entire e-mail
distribution list of Duncan and Waters.

����������� So
go ahead, my dear.� Ignore me if you
wish.� Or, log on and have a chat with me
to see what kind of deal we can arrange.�
It�s up to you.

&nbsp;

Eagerly Awaiting,

&nbsp;

Virtual Master (VM)

&nbsp;

����������� Steffi looked at her Luis Vuitton
watch.� The slim gold band contrasted
nicely with her tanned skin.� It was 8:50 PM � she would need to decide, and decide
quickly.�� Suddenly, she felt nausea turn
her stomach over.� She got up and rushed
into the bathroom, where she threw up into the toilet, crying as she did
so.� She straightened up and looked at
herself in the mirror.� Her eyes were
reddened and puffy, and she was pale.�
She didn�t know what to do.� If
she called the police to report a blackmail attempt they would want to know
more about the identity of her blackmailer.�
What could she tell them?� That
some guy named �Virtual Master� was after her?�
And by the time she called the police and got to talk to a detective, 9 PM would have come and gone, and it would be
too late.� She took a deep breath.� At the very least she should speak with this
� individual � she was bright, and an attorney.�
She could scare him into silence, and get him to destroy the
evidence.� At least if she spoke to him
she could put things off enough to form some kind of plan.� Alright, that�s what she would do.

&nbsp;

����������� Steffi returned to the computer and logged on to
Y-Chat.� She ignored the icons showing
that various of her girlfriends were online � probably
getting ready to go out, she figured � and waited.� She realized her hands were shaking, and she
cursed at herself, willing them to stay still.

&nbsp;

����������� Within
moments, a bell rang on her computer screen, and up popped a box showing that a
new person wished to chat.� The person
was named VM, and she realized the time had come.

&nbsp;

VM:�
Good evening, Steffi.� I think you made the right choice.

Steffi:
Who are you?� This is a serious crime you
are committing.

VM:�
Let�s be serious, my dear.� You�re
not going to the police.

Steffi:� Why not?�
You would go to jail.

VM:�
Who am I?� Where do I live?

Steffi:� I don�t know, but I will easily find out.

VM:�
I doubt that.� Let me tell you
about what I want from you.

Steffi:� Let me guess.�
You want sex.

VM:�
How na�ve.

Steffi: ?

VM: I need you to learn some self
control, my dear.

Steffi:� I don�t understand.

VM:�
You will.� Now, turn on the webcam
that you own.

Steffi:� How do you know that I own a webcam?

VM:�
The same way that I know that your mother lives at the Greenbriar Home for the Elderly in Stepponing.� 

Steffi:� !!

VM:�
Now, do you see why it might be a bad idea to go to the police?� Turn on your webcam.

Steffi:� One minute.

VM:�
That�s better.� You look like
you�ve been crying.

Steffi:� I have.�
The lies you are telling upset me.�
What do want me to do?� Strip?

VM:�
No, don�t be silly.� I told you
that I don�t want sex from you.� In fact,
after tonight, you won�t be chatting with me.

Steffi:� What then?

VM:�
Download this program from this link.�
It doesn�t have any viruses, I promise:�
http://www.virtualmaster.com

Steffi:� Um, OK.

&nbsp;

����������� Steffi clicked on the link, and a black webscreen
appeared.� She followed the instructions,
and within a few minutes the program VirtualMaster
had been installed on her computer.�
Little did she know how much this would change her life.

&nbsp;

VM:�
Alright, I see you have installed the program.� Please click on the �Start� button, and enjoy
your new way of life.

&nbsp;

CHAPTER 2

The
Torment Begins

&nbsp;

����������� Steffi Williams shrugged her shoulders and clicked the
�Start� button on an icon of a masked face that had appeared in the middle of
her screen.

����������� A
text box appeared.� �Good evening, Steffi� it read.� She
saw that there was a right-pointing arrow at the bottom, and she clicked it
with her mouse.

����������� �You
have just begun to participate in the VirtualMaster
Lifestyle Program.� You have 20
points.� If you fall below Negative 20
(-20) Points at any time, or fail to reach 50 points within one week, the
following file[s] [steffi(1).jpg, steffi(2).jpg,
steffi.wmv] will be e-mailed to the following
e-mail address [duncanwatersglobal@duncanwaters.com].�

����������� Steffi gasped.� 20 points?� What was
that?� How was she supposed to �earn�
points?� And how did she lose them?� Christ, this was ridiculous.� She got up and walked to the closet, deciding
to get her purse and take a taxi to the local police station.� This lunacy had gone far enough.

����������� She
had only gone a few steps when a loud ringing alarm bell began on her
computer.� Its shrill tone stopped her
dead in her tracks, and she returned to the desk to see that the text box had
been replaced with a timer, counting down from 60 seconds.� �60 Second Countdown.� Press �Here� before Zero or lose Two Points.�

����������� Steffi looked around, irritated and embarrassed.� In a moment, her competitive nature and,
admittedly, some nerves, asserted themselves, and she clicked the button with 8
seconds remaining.� The box disappeared,
and a blank screen reappeared. 

����������� Despite
herself, she felt a bit curious about the program.� She decided that if she was going to go the
police, she should at least learn a little more about this strange set-up.� At the very least, she was damned if she was
going to lose points for something ridiculous like not pressing a button!

����������� Moments
after she sat back down at the desk, a chime sounded, and a box popped up on
the screen. �TASK 1� read the box, with another of the ubiquitous right arrows
on the bottom.� She frowned and pressed
the right arrow.

����������� �TASK:� Read the following memo, and report when
finished.� Due Date: June 28, 11 PM� (Task worth = 2 points)

����������� There
was a beep, and a memo appeared on her screen, replacing the blank box.� Steffi crossed and
uncrossed her legs, feeling a bit odd as she bent forward to see what the
program would do.

&nbsp;

VIRTUALMASTER:� YOUR NEW
LIFESTYLE

&nbsp;

����������� Welcome Slave!� 

&nbsp;

����������� You
have been selected to participate in the VM Lifestyle Program, an
all-encompassing lifestyle guidance system designed for the submissive
woman.� Over the next period of your
life, you will learn to bend your pride and your will in obedience to the
dictates of this program.� Read this memo
� it may well be the most helpful document you�ve ever encountered!

&nbsp;

I.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
What is this Program?

VM is based on a simple three-tiered
system of control:

&nbsp;

A.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Requests:� From this point forward, you will have to
request permission to perform the following functions:


 Eating breakfast
 Washing
 Using the bathroom
 Getting dressed for work/home/outings
 Eating lunch (when at home)
 Eating dinner
 Watching television
 Reading a
     book or magazine
 Going to bed
 Speaking on the telephone
 Using the internet
 Inviting a friend to your home
 Going out with friends
 Leaving the house for any activity other than work
 Going out on a date
 Masturbation
 Sexual Intercourse


&nbsp;

B.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Tasks:

You will be
assigned tasks to complete daily, with longer tasks on the weekends and during
holidays.� These tasks will vary, and
can, but will not necessarily, include pain, humiliation, sexual torment,
boredom, and bondage.� You will notify
the VM immediately when you begin a task, and again when the task is completed.

&nbsp;

C.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
Points and Punishments:

Your Controller
has set the parameters for points (a maximum and minimum which you are required
to stay within at all times).� Reaching
maximum points may result in a reward, while falling below a minimum will
result in a severe forfeit.� Punishments
are available in two formats:�
Involuntary � as a result of failing to perform a task or permission
properly; and Voluntary � in order to earn points.� The more points you earn, either through
proper use of the permissions, or by completing tasks, the greater a chance you
have of being allowed to complete certain permissions.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Steffi
stopped reading and shook her head.� She
could barely believe this shit.� On her
screen, there was a simple box now, with a couple of headings:

&nbsp;

REPORT�������� PUNISHMENT REQUEST���� REQUEST������ ACTIVITY REPORT

&nbsp;

�Report� was in bold.� She wondered why, and then remembered that
she was supposed to �report� when she had finished reading the memo.� Well, that shouldn�t be too hard to do!� She clicked on Report, and a text box opened
up.

&nbsp;

She paused for a moment, and then
typed in �I have read the report.�

&nbsp;

A buzzer sounded, and her writing
was wiped out, replaced with a simple message.�
�IMPROPER FORMAT ERROR.� PLEASE ADDRESS ALL COMMUNICATIONS TO THIS
PROGRAM BY WRITING �DEAR MASTER� AT THE COMMENCEMENT.�

&nbsp;

That damn clock reappeared,
counting down from 60 seconds.� Getting
irritated, Steffi typed �Dear Master, I have read the
memo.�

&nbsp;

A bell chimed, and a new red figure
appeared.� 22 points.� Steffi smiled.� This wasn�t that hard!

&nbsp;

Moments later, her attention was
drawn back to the screen:� TASK
ASSIGNMENT � Due Date, June 30, 12 Noon.

&nbsp;

Purchase
one small sized butt plug, one medium sized butt plug, a set of vibrating Ben-Wa balls, a butterfly vibrator, and a set of nipple clamps.

&nbsp;

Steffi
sniffed.� She already owned a set of Ben-Wa balls, and a butterfly vibrator.� She assumed that the butt plugs were a joke,
since nothing � nothing � touched her
butthole.

&nbsp;

Just then the phone rang, startling
her.

&nbsp;

�Hello?�

&nbsp;

�Stef!�

&nbsp;

�Campbell,�
Steffi began, smiling in spite of herself.� �It�s good to hear your voice.� Are you still at work?�

&nbsp;

�Nope, I got to come home early
tonight � and I don�t feel like sticking around here.� Let�s go to that new Wine Bar on 18th
� you know the one I mean � VinoVeritas � it�s
supposed to be really hot.�

&nbsp;

�Sounds good,
sweetie.� I�ve, well, it�s kind of
weird.�

&nbsp;

�What?�

&nbsp;

�I dunno
� let me take a shower and get changed.�
I�ll meet you there at 10 PM,
and tell you about the fucked-up evening that I�ve been having.�

&nbsp;

�What is it?�



�Nothing, I think.� Just some really odd computer shit.� There are some real freaks out there, and it
just kind of got to me.� I�ll talk to you
soon, darling.�

&nbsp;

�Can�t wait.� Oh, and Steffi?� Wear something hot, kiddo!�

&nbsp;

Steffi
smiled.� A date would be just the ticket
to get this computer perversity out of her mind.� She couldn�t tell Campbell
about the problem, for obvious reasons, but she could run it by him like a
hypothetical, and hopefully he�d have some ideas.� Besides, once she was out of her apartment,
on the town, having fun, she�d be bound to get her mind off this crap, and
hopefully forget all about it.

&nbsp;

She walked into the bathroom and
disrobed in front of the large mirror.�
Usually bright lights didn�t do much for a woman�s figure, but she
thought that she still looked really good.�
Firm breasts, a firm stomach, and long legs.� She decided to shave the legs again in the
shower, and place just the right amount of scent in some of the clefts that gleamed
at the top of her legs � Campbell, for all his foolishness, could do wonders
with his tongue when she allowed him down there.

&nbsp;

Steffi
got into the shower, and began to soap her breasts with a
foaming sea-gel soap.� She felt
her nipples harden to her own touch.�
They had always been ultra-sensitive, and despite the tensions of the
day, she began to feel aroused.� Her
scent � thick, rich, and moist � began to fill the bathroom.� Her breath quickened, and without giving it
much thought, she trailed a finger through her fast-dampening lips.� If she didn�t do something quickly, she�d be
on her back, frigging like crazy � but wait, she could keep this under
control.� Despite her high sex drive, she
knew enough to save things for the date � she would just make sure that
Campbell satisfied her at least five times down there before she allowed him to
take her deep and hard.

&nbsp;

She toweled herself off with a
Persian towel, and then walked into her bedroom, opening up the walk-in
closet.� A rack of shoes, ranging from
sensible 1� heels to a few bondage-style 5� fuck-me pumps greeted her, along
with a horizontal bar that ran across the entire back wall.� Her dresses, skirts, and business suits hung
there, categorized by length and style.�
She was feeling sexy, so something short and hot tonight � her fingers
trailed across the hangars, settling on a light blue silk dress, a shift
really, that came down about halfway down her thighs.� Sleeveless, and cut
low in front, it was just thick enough to leave people guessing, but filmy
enough to give her man a show in the right light.� It was good for tonight,
that was for sure.� Paired with a
filmy skin-toned thong and some 3� strappy white
sandals, she would be a real knockout.�
No bra, either � her young breasts didn�t need one.

&nbsp;

Feeling much better, Steffi walked back into the living room, and stopped
dead.� Rather than the 22 that she remembered, there was now a
14 flashing in the top left corner
of her desktop.� What the hell?� Just then there was a loud buzz, and the
well-known 60 second clock began counting down � �Press Here, or lose Two
Points� � she looked at her watch, which she had put on again as she walked
into the room � she must have failed to do this damn pushbutton a few times
while she was in the shower.� Steffi bit her lip.�
This was getting really irritating.�
She pushed the button, and it went away, and then she had had
enough.� She shut-down her computer, and
marched into her bedroom to find a light wrap for the evening.

&nbsp;

On her way out, she paused by her
computer.� Maybe she should be smart, and
run a virus check while she was out.�
That would probably find the root directory of this program, and destroy
it by morning.� Campbell
could wait a few minutes for her, after all.�
She turned her computer on again, and cursed furiously.� The figure in bold at the top of her desktop
was still there, and now it was a 2.� What the fuck?� She sat down, and clicked her mouse on the
numeral.� A history file opened:

&nbsp;

+2: Completed Memo: 22 points

-2: Missed Time Check, 20:54, 28.6.06

-2: Missed Time Check, 21:02, 28.6.06

-2: Missed Time Check, 21:05, 28.6.06

-2: Missed Time Check, 21:10, 28.6.06

-10: Shut Down Computer, 21:15, 28.6.06

-2: Missed Time Check, 21:16, 28.6.06

&nbsp;

����������� Shit!� This meant that not only could the program continue
to work while the computer was shut down, but it penalized her for shutting the
computer.� Shit!� This meant that when she was at home, she had
to be on a kind of leash in front of the computer.� That was ridiculous.

&nbsp;

����������� She
decided to open all the menus to see if there was some way to reset the
program.� Under �Activity Report�, she
paled slightly � she had already forgotten how many things she was supposed to
ask permission for.� If she understood
things correctly, then in the past 15 minutes, she had broken three rules � she
washed, she spoke on the phone, and she got dressed for a date.� And she already had only 2 points.� This was going to
be really, really difficult.� 

&nbsp;

����������� Alright,
she promised herself.� She�d try to
follow the rules � and by so doing, work around them.� She would get permission to go on the
internet, and then find the asshole who set this up
and get him to shut the thing off.

&nbsp;

����������� Sighing,
she clicked on �Request� and scrolled down to �Use the Internet�.� When she clicked on that heading, a text box
appeared that read �Please Master, may slave steffi use the Internet?�

&nbsp;

����������� A
bell rang, and the answer YES appeared.�
She smiled, until she saw that a clock was counting down from 15
minutes.� Quickly she logged on to chat,
and luckily, within moments, VirtualMaster was there.

&nbsp;

VM:�
You�re starting to realize how this works, my dear.

Steffi:
It�s shit.� You�ve got to be kidding.

VM:�
Not at all.� How many rules have
you inadvertently broken?

Steffi:� Three, I think.

VM:�
Really?� Which ones?

Steffi:
Um, I took a shower, I got dressed for a date that I have tonight, and I spoke
on the phone to my boyfriend.

VM:�
Naughty, naughty.� Have you
reported your offenses?

Steffi:� No!� I
mean, I already have only 1 point �
I didn�t understand how it worked.�
Please!

VM:�
I find this very amusing.

Steffi:� Why?

VM:�
Because you�re already pleading with me.

&nbsp;

����������� Steffi went crimson.

&nbsp;

Steffi:� Please.�
Please don�t send the photos.

VM:�
I won�t � not until you get -20
points.

&nbsp;

����������� Shit!� There was that horrible sixty second clock
again.� Steffi
pressed the button quickly.

&nbsp;

Steffi:� But isn�t there some way to get off on a
better foot than I have?

VM:�
Feeling competitive?� Well, I will
tell you what � it�s your first night, so I will cancel the things you�ve
already done wrong.� But from here on
out, you have to follow rules.� And I
mean follow them.

Steffi:� But what if I lose points?� 

VM:�
My usual recommendation is that if you fall below zero, you should
definitely ask for at least a 10 point punishment.

Steffi:� Oh God.

VM:�
Enjoy.

&nbsp;

He logged off, and Steffi stared at the clock counting down her online time,
tears pooling in her eyes.

&nbsp;

OK, she could do this.� She�d weathered worse.� What rules would she now have to follow to do
what she wanted to do?� First, her date.�
Shit, she had to get permission to go on a date.

&nbsp;

She clicked on �Go on a Date� from
the request list.� And gasped out loud
when the answer immediately came back:� NO.

&nbsp;

Fuck, she though to herself, I�ll
have to call and cancel Campbell.� She picked up the phone and began
dialing.� Wait, she had to ask permission
to use the phone.� �Use the Phone� she
asked the program, and began to cry when the answer came back:� NO.� How could she call Campbell
and tell him she couldn�t come out?� What
would she do?� Alright, it wasn�t so
bad.� He understood how work could be
overwhelming, and she would just find him tomorrow and tell him she had to
suddenly go back into the office.

&nbsp;

What else?� Oh God, she had to ask the stupid program
what to wear at home.� She glanced down
at her gorgeous shift and sighed.� �What
should I wear at home?� she asked.� In a
moment, the answer came back, although it took a few minutes for her to believe
what she saw in front of her:

&nbsp;

Full-cut white panties

Lace thong-back teddy

Jeans

Turtleneck

Overcoat

One wool mitten

&nbsp;

This was ridiculous.� #1 it was June.� #2, she would look, and feel, ludicrous.� And what the fuck was this?� On the computer was another timer, counting
down six minutes � she realized, quickly, that this was the time she had to
complete her change.� 

&nbsp;

Normally, Steffi
took a long time to get dressed.� Her
body was her greatest asset, her greatest weapon, and it deserved pampering and
primping.� Six minutes � this would be a
challenge, to say the least.

&nbsp;

She hurried from the room, her
sandal heels clicking on the wood floor, and rushed into the bedroom.� Some of her winter clothes were kept in
boxes, but hopefully she could find all of this stuff.

&nbsp;

A lace thong
teddy � no problem � that was in the lingerie drawer.� She grabbed a black one out.

&nbsp;

White full-cut panties � God, she
never wore granny panties � she must have a pair of period panties somewhere �
she started rummaging through her drawer, scattering the finest silks, the
flimsiest lace across the floor.�
Normally she took care of her clothes, but couldn�t do that
tonight.� Tissue paper and its precious
contents lay strewn indiscriminately across the floor.� 

&nbsp;

A turtleneck � that
she could find.� She grabbed one off a
hangar, cursing as the neck stretched and slightly lost its shape.� Jeans, ditto � not hard to
find.� Just hard to get on without
a crowbar!

&nbsp;

She grabbed her gabardine overcoat
from its summer bag, and thank God, found one crumpled mitten lying on the
floor of the back of the closet.� 

&nbsp;

She glanced at her watch � about
two minutes to go � she could do this!�
Desperately, she clawed at her silk dress, and groaned as she heard it
tear as she yanked it over her head.� No
time for that now.� As for her �date�
thong � she ripped it from her body.� She
got on the panties, the teddy, and the turtleneck, and wriggled into the
jeans.� Then, feeling ridiculous, she
shrugged on the overcoat and put on one woolen mitten.� Leaving behind the wreckage of her closet,
she sprinted into the living room.

����������� Steffi hit the �Dressed� button, and the timer
stopped.� She waited with baited breath
to see how many points she would get for succeeding at this task.� And then it hit her � none.� This wasn�t a special task that might get her
points.� This was just part of her daily
routine.� Dressing like an idiot in
uncomfortably warm clothes, sitting in front of her computer on a Friday night,
waiting� -- yes,
there it was, the fucking timer again � for another command.� Oh God, this was not really worth it!� And yet, it had barely begun.

&nbsp;

����������� Steffi realized that part of her problem was that she had
to pee badly.� At least she could take
care of that if she was stuck at home!�
She got up and shuffled in her bare feet to the bathroom.� There she got a good look at herself in the mirror.� Just half an hour before
she had been in here looking sexy, hot � a woman.� Now, her makeup was smudged, her eyes a bit
pink from crying, and she looked absolutely ludicrous.� Fuck it, she thought.� I�ll have a bad evening, and then I�ll go to
the cops tomorrow and fix things.� She
returned to the living room, and her heart dropped.

&nbsp;

����������� What
was the most humiliating thing on the list?�
Maybe having to ask for sex, or masturbation � but actually, to her,
right now, it was the realization that she was supposed to ask for permission
to use the toilet, just like a little kid in school.� And she had forgotten to do that, completely
forgotten.� What now?� VirtualMaster had
warned her that ALL RULES had to be followed.�
So, she would have to report her error.�
She swallowed nervously, and clicked on �Report Activity� � �Used
bathroom without permission�.

&nbsp;

����������� A
loud buzzer sounded, and for the first time she heard the program�s .Wav file
#1 �Bad steffi!� it cried in a loud voice.

&nbsp;

����������� Her
points went from 2 to -13. �Shit!� A
15 point penalty for using the bathroom!�
And now she was below zero � and nearing the dreaded -20.�
She realized that she had no choice but to ask for a punishment.� Actually, she did have a choice, and that was
partly what made the next action of hers so painful � it was her choice to
click on Request a Punishment, and fill out �15 Points� in the box that asked
her what level punishment she desired.�
Jesus, she didn�t desire any
punishment!

&nbsp;

����������� And
here is what she had to do:

&nbsp;

����������� �slave,� announced the computer program, �you will be
punished as follows.� You will go into
your bathroom with a knife, a fork, and a plate.� You will unwrap a
bar of bath soap, place it on the plate, and then, using the knife and fork,
cut it into bites and eat it.� Once you
are completely done, you will spend the next 45 minutes on your knees, licking
the doorknob.�

&nbsp;

PLEASE PRESS THE BUTTON WHEN YOU
WISH TO BEGIN THE PUNISHMENT.� PUNISHMENT
MUST BE COMPLETED WITHIN THE NEXT 48 HOURS.

&nbsp;

Oh God, though steffi,
my evening just went from bad to worse.�
But, she thought, she didn�t want this punishment hanging over her head
for the rest of the weekend.� If she got
it done now, then she could go to the police in the morning.� And at least it was nothing horribly sexual,
or particularly nasty.� She liked her
Eau-de-Lavender soap, so how bad could it taste?� The whole knife and fork thing was a bit
perverse, but all in all it could have been worse.� 

&nbsp;

She went into the bathroom and sat
down on the tiled floor with a dinner plate in front of her.� She reached into the cupboard under the sink
and withdrew a bar of soap.� The smell
when she unwrapped it calmed her, as always, and she
became increasingly convinced that this wouldn�t be so bad.

&nbsp;

Placing it on the plate in front of
her, Steffi cut a small bite, speared it with her
fork, and popped it into her mouth.� It
was bitter, and the floral scent, rather than appearing subtly in the air, as
it did when she washed, filled her mouth and nose with an acrid stench.� She gagged slightly, and her eyes teared up.� She bit
her lip, trying hard not to think about the Chateau-Margot and seared tuna that
she should be dining on with Campbell
right now.� She cut a bigger bite, and
swallowed it whole � Oh God, this was worse � it felt like it was choking her
in her throat, swelling and slimy.� She
would have to chew.� How many more
bites?� At least six.� The next three were bad, but not nearly as
awful as the last three, which were deposited down her throat as she shook with
tears, and fought back a rising tide of nausea.�
Her stomach was cramping, rejecting the fats and perfumed oils that
filled the soap bar.

&nbsp;

Finally, she was done.� This had been a bad moment for her.� And now, she had more punishment to look
forward to � 45 minutes on the floor, licking, for fuck�s sake, her bathroom
doorknob.

&nbsp;

She got on her knees, feeling
actually grateful for her clown-like outfit of jeans and an overcoat.� Her pink tongue flicked out and began to
carve a graceful tracery across the metal doorknob.� Ah, she thought, this tongue was supposed to
be flicking in and out of Campbell�s
mouth, and then down his muscular chest to his groin.� She closed her eyes and tried to picture
herself doing that, but found it impossible to will herself away from this
place � this true place, where she crouched on her knees, wearing a woolen
mitten, licking away at a brass knob.

&nbsp;

The 45 minutes seemed like 45
days.� Finally, she saw on her watch that
her time in purgatory had finished.� She
rose to her feet, swaying unsteadily as blood rushed back to her extremities,
and tottered back into the living room.

&nbsp;

There she reported her punishment
done, and was pleased to see that her number returned to 2.� Still not high, but it
beat hell out of -13.

&nbsp;

And she was exhausted, completely
exhausted.� She wanted nothing more than
to go to bed.� Cursing her helplessness,
she asked the program �Please, Master, may slave steffi
go to bed?�

&nbsp;

And cursed further when she the
answer: �Yes.� Sleep on the floor
tonight, slave steffi, and be ready to report at 6 AM.�

&nbsp;

6 AM?� God, it was 11:00
now � and the weekend was her only time to sleep in.� And the floor?� Her bedroom had rough oak planking on the
floor � the rustic look, her interior designer had called it � and she had
always liked how it looked from the center of her silk-sheeted, King-sized
bed.� Now she would soon rue the day that
she decided to tear up the carpeting that used to be in her bedroom.

&nbsp;

And then she realized she had one
last thing to do � ask the computer what to wear to bed.� God, what it would come up with now?� And at this final straw, she burst into sobs:

&nbsp;

White lace demi-cup
bra

&nbsp;

Shaking, she stumbled into her
bedroom, stripped off her clothes, and fastened on a crumpled white lace demi-cup bra, that lifted her breasts out and left her
nipples, and the smooth slopes above them, fully exposed.� This was a bra to wear for a lover �
CERTAINLY not a bra to wear for an evening sleeping on a splintery wood floor.

&nbsp;

Crying, she collapsed in a heap on
the ground, there to spend an uncomfortably cold, and all too short,
night.� 


She had hoped that her dreams would give her a chance to escape the oppressive
reality, but even if they did, they ended all too soon with the dawning of her
next day.
