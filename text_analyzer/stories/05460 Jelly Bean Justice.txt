JELLY BEAN JUSTICE!

&nbsp;

By

Anne Gray

&nbsp;

It wasn�t a swagger, or even a strut, it was an attitude, she knew she
looked good and she did.� Even at just 5�
6�, plus a bit more with the heels on the boots, she had an arrogance about her
that managed to give the impression she was looking down her nose at
everyone.�� In a sense she probably was.


&nbsp;

I suppose that kind
of confidence was needed when you made your living defrauding people, but the
clothes certainly helped complete the picture.�
The black leather coat didn�t need a belt because several buttons down
the front pulled it snugly around her body from the closed neck, over a very
impressive bust line, and nipping in tight at the waist before it flared
slightly over her hips and dropped to the top of the
matching black leather knee boots.

&nbsp;

Long jet black hair
had a wide blonde streak from just above the center of her forehead to down
over the left ear; that drew attention to the impeccably made up face.� Nothing garish but every feature was
highlighted to catch the eye.

&nbsp;

Her left hand
resting, at waist height, on top of a black leather shoulder strap handbag was
also covered in skintight kid leather.

&nbsp;

My own hip length
jacket was dusky rose coloured leather and it was belted; I might not have her
impressive figure but was no slouch in my own right.� Matching tailored leather slacks covered the
tops of my ankle boots with 3� block heels.

&nbsp;

The two guys who
provided our target�s muscle were from the Caribbean and, as they walked along
flanking her, their dark skin provided even more of a contrast to her
beauty.� The beauty she used unashamedly
to fleece her victims.

&nbsp;

As the threesome
rounded the corner the bodyguards suddenly found themselves looking down the
barrels of shotguns held by Master Derek�s men. Julie�s eyes just about crossed
as she tried to focus on my automatic a few inches from her nose.

&nbsp;

Everything stopped
for a few moments while we gave them a chance to take in the situation.� They might be crooks but they were not stupid
and did not resist as three sets of wrists got handcuffed behind their
backs.�� Derek pulled up in a dark van
and another of his men followed in my Caddie.

&nbsp;

�Say goodbye to your
friends Julie.� I don�t deal with males
but Derek does and I expect he is going to put emancipation back about a
hundred years by the time he�s finished with them.� I, on the other hand, just love dealing with
unwilling ladies and you are all mine.�

&nbsp;

All three of them
were out cold before the needles left their necks.� The two guys were unceremoniously dumped on
the floor of the van while Julie ended up tucked in the trunk of the
Caddie.� I thanked Derek for his
assistance and told him that if he ever needed help from a Leather Domme just
to give me a call.

&nbsp;

Sometime later I
pulled into my garage and popped the trunk.�
The wide belt I buckled around her waist had a couple of shoulder straps
and a large metal ring that snapped on a hook from the ceiling pulley.� That took her weight and enabled me to lift
the limp form up and over to a wheeled chair.

&nbsp;

Pushing the chair
through to my �dungeon� I used another pulley to settle her in a heavy,
anchored, wooden chair then removed the harness.

&nbsp;

Using thin white cord
I soon had the sleeping girl firmly bound to the chair.� The white cord made a nice contrast over the
black leather of her coat and boots.�
While her right arm was tied behind to the chair back, with the
handcuffs around the wrist and one of the chair back�s
braces as extra insurance, the left was only held by some cord around the
bicep.

&nbsp;

I removed my jacket and
got a few other things ready while I watched for signs she was waking up.� As her chin came up off her chest and her
head stopped against the headrest, I forced in a hard rubber gag with slots top
and bottom for her teeth.� A strap around
her head reinforced the gag�s position; it had a removable plug at the center
that I left in place for the time being.

&nbsp;

A small, wheeled,
table about 4� high was positioned just off to one side where she could see
it.� On top was a digital clock,
something that looked like a heavy duty mousetrap, a pad, a pencil and about
two feet of rubber tubing.

&nbsp;

Sitting in a
comfortable armchair directly in front of her I sipped a glass of chilled white
wine and waited for her to finish waking up.

&nbsp;

As consciousness
returned Julie�s eyes focused, looked around, and almost immediately settled on
me.

&nbsp;

�Hello again
Julie.� Now that we finally meet I would like to tell
you a story.� It�s about a na�ve young
man.� A couple of months before his 21st
birthday he met a beautiful lady and was soon head over heels in love with
her.� On his birthday she gave herself to
him and he was completely lost.� The fact
that he had just come of age and received a very sizeable fortune wasn�t
mentioned but, strangely, the money soon began to flow from his accounts.�

&nbsp;

�Six months later he
was almost penniless and the lady dropped him like a hot potato.� He was devastated and followed her around
like a lost puppy.� Then one night the
police found him in an alley.� The
doctors said it looked like at least two guys with knuckle dusters had worked
him over.�

&nbsp;

�They also found that
damage from one too many hits to the head had left him with the permanent
mentality of a four year old.�

&nbsp;

�As a result he�s in
a constant care home for the rest of his life.�
You were that lady Julie and you got what you wanted when you cleaned
out his trust funds; the goons who went too far were yours and supposed to just
scare him off.� By the time Derek is
finished with them they will be a couple of blubbering, simpering slaves he
will sell at a good profit.

&nbsp;

The young man�s name
was Jim and he is my brother.� The
police say there is nothing they can do about the money and no way to prove you
set up the attack.�� 

&nbsp;

&quot;Now do you have
any idea why you are here?�

&nbsp;

She started shaking
her head and making mewling sounds through the gag.

&nbsp;

�Oh don�t try to deny
things Julie, I have my own methods of finding out
what happened.� I�m very wealthy because
I got my half of the trust fund a few years ago and nobody stole it from
me.� I also have a lucrative hobby as a
Leather Domme.� I have a regular
clientele of very high powered female executives and CEO�s who come to see me
every month or so to have me lower their stress levels for a few hours before
they head back into the fray.�

&nbsp;

�So, you see, I can
easily afford to have Jim looked after for the rest of his life but I think
that should be your responsibility.�
Don�t you?�

&nbsp;

I moved over to her
side and set the pad on the arm of the chair then stuck the pencil between her
fingers.

&nbsp;

�See Julie, I even
know you are left handed.� Now, I am
going to visit your home and you are going to write down the code for your
security system plus the location and combination of your safe.� Don�t shake your head.� The key ring from your handbag has one of
those cute little barrel keys that go in a safe door before you enter the
combination.� Write.�

&nbsp;

After a few moments
of staring at me trying to judge her options she started jotting down some
notes on the pad.� When she was finished
I unscrewed the plug from the center of the gag and screwed in one end of the
rubber tube.� The other end stayed on the
side table near the gadget that looked like a mousetrap.

&nbsp;

I buckled a strap
across her forehead and around the headrest then pushed two soft rubber plugs
in her nostrils so she was breathing through the tube and set the clock for 30
seconds but held my finger on the start button.

&nbsp;

�Now Julie I just
know you wouldn�t try to deceive me but let me explain something.� It is about half an hour�s drive to your
place so that�s a one hour round trip.�
Figure on two hours for me to spend there and that�s three hours. So,
when I leave, I�m going to set this timer at 180 minutes.� If I get delayed by, perhaps your security
company checking on a wrongly input signal or maybe the safe is wired to do
something nasty if the wrong combination is entered then I won�t get back in
time to stop the timer.� Let me show you
what that will mean to you.�

&nbsp;

I lifted my finger
from the start button and we both watched, she with
perhaps more interest than me, as the thirty seconds ticked away.

&nbsp;

SNAP!

&nbsp;

The heavy metal arm
of the �mousetrap� swung over and pinched the end of the rubber tube closed.

&nbsp;

I waited for a little
while Julie realized that her air supply was now cut off.� As I lifted the arm to reset it, and the
clock at 180, I grinned down at her.

&nbsp;

�Well Julie do you
want to change any of those notes you made for me?�

&nbsp;

I picked up the
pencil from where it had fallen as her air stopped and placed it back between
her fingers.� She changed two numbers in
the security code and one in the safe combination.� That done I grabbed her left wrist, secured it to the chair behind her back and felt sure
the trip to her home would now be a safe one.

&nbsp;

It was.� It was also interesting.� There was no problem with the security but
when I looked at the monitor showing what the six cameras were seeing something
was not right about the set up.� The
system was recording on a six hour looped tape that struck me as too amateur so
I checked more closely and followed some almost hidden wires to the computer
that was recording on to its hard drive.

&nbsp;

I formatted the drive
then frayed one of the wires to disable the feed and pulled the tape before
heading for the safe that turned into a goldmine.� All her records of off shore accounts
including passwords, a few very nice pieces of jewelry plus a sizeable amount
of hard cash were neatly stacked and ready for me.

&nbsp;

Before leaving I
rewound the tape and set it for a ten minute delay then got out of there.� Back home in plenty of time I waited,
watching Julie through a one-way mirror.�
The timer was running down and so was the sweat beneath the strap across
her forehead. With just one minute to go I casually
wandered in and slapped my hand on the stop button.� I figured that, psychologically and
monetarily, round one was most definitely mine.

�

Chapter 2

&nbsp;

�Hello little
brother, are we going to have fun and play games this afternoon?�

&nbsp;

�Oh yes please
Sissy.�

&nbsp;

It was still strange
to call Jim, who was 3� taller than me, little but when you looked into those
almost vacant eyes and remembered that behind them was the mind of a four year
old the word just fit.

&nbsp;

I was wearing a
bright yellow heavy knit sweater, a comfortable knee length skirt and low
heeled pumps.� My hair was in a ponytail
and I had on just a minimum of makeup.

&nbsp;

Taking the hand of my
brother I thanked the driver from the nursing home and confirmed he would be
back in about four hours.� The nurse, who
would stay while Jim was visiting, waved a book at me as I pointed her towards the
lounge and told her to help herself to tea or coffee in the kitchen. 

&nbsp;

Jim was wearing a
neat sports shirt and slacks with comfortable loafers on his feet and looked so
healthy and handsome until you looked into those eyes.� I led him through to the den and showed him
the new game on the table in front of the big mirror.

&nbsp;

�What are the little
hammers for Sissy.��
Jim pointed at the two small rubber mallets on the table and I answered
without thinking.

&nbsp;

�They�re for hitting
these�..�

&nbsp;

As soon as I said the
word hitting his face crumpled and then he dropped to the floor and curled in a
fetal position with his hands on his cheeks.

&nbsp;

�No, no, please don�t
hit Jim.� Jimmy doesn�t like being hit.�

&nbsp;

I dropped to his side
and took his hands in mine.

&nbsp;

�No Jim no one will
hit you they are just for the game.� Now
stand up and let me show you.�

&nbsp;

I sent a look at the
mirror that would curdle milk as I comforted my brother and after about five
minutes got him to sit on one of the chairs at the table.

&nbsp;

Clamped to one end of
the table was an 18� high copy of the �Ring The Bell�
game you see at fairs.� There were the
two rubber mallets, two decks of playing cards and a dish full of jelly beans
that were Jim�s favorite candy.

&nbsp;

When he spotted the
candy dish he got a real child�s look on his face and started to reach for it
but I covered it with my hand 

&nbsp;

�Those are a reward
for playing the game Jim. So listen while I tell you what we�re going to
do.� I will turn over the first card in
my pack and then you turn one from yours.�
If it is the same as mine you pick up the mallet and hit that knob with
it so the bell rings.� Then you get to
choose a candy.� If it�s not the same we
keep turning up cards, OK?� 

&nbsp;

�OK Sissy let�s
start.�

&nbsp;

I turned over a ten
and Jim�s first card was a seven.� His
mouth moved as he slowly counted the dots and frowned when they weren�t the
same.

&nbsp;

This continued for a
few moments then I turned up a two and so did Jim.

&nbsp;

Quick as a flash he
grabbed the handle of a mallet with both hands and whacked the knob making the
clapper slide upwards and hit the bell.� Then, with a big grin, looked at me.

&nbsp;

�Can I have a red one
Sissy?�

&nbsp;

I nodded and looked
at the mirror with a smile. 

&nbsp;

Behind that one-way
glass the ringing of the bell had caused a number of things to happen almost
simultaneously.� First, a strong tingling
sensation started in the clamps on Julie�s nipples then traveled down to the
one on her clit.� The large dildo jammed
inside her began to vibrate and then a trigger released to allow a 2� long and
�� thick leather strop to start its swing through a 180 degree arc.� Unfortunately for Julie her bare buttocks
were at approximately 160 degrees of the arc and the strop came to a stop
against them with a resounding thwack.

&nbsp;

Chapter 3

&nbsp;

In the soundproofed
room behind the one-way mirror Julie was not a happy camper.� Looked at from the side her position would
remind you of a swimmer just as they were about to dive into the pool from the
starting blocks.

&nbsp;

Up on tip toe,
knees almost touching her waist, rear end sticking out and back sloping
slightly upwards to the neck and her head that was up and looking towards the
other end of the pool.� The only thing missing from that picture were
her arms that should have been at her sides ready to swing forward in a dive.

&nbsp;

Julie�s problem was
that she had no control over her position.�
Yes she was on tiptoe, very much so, because the thigh high ballet boots
held her feet in almost a straight line with her shins.� The metal caps on the toes were fastened to
the platform with bolts and wing nuts.

&nbsp;

Short chains to the
metal belt around Julie�s waist attached heavy leather straps around each leg
just above the knee.� That was the same
belt that fitted over a very heavily boned corset running from her hips to neck.� From a threaded socket on either side of the
belt short metal bars extended out to clamp on vertical posts and hold her body
immobile.

&nbsp;

The fraud artist�s
arms were up between her shoulder blades.�
Her hands were folded into fists and covered with a single laced leather
mitt.� I had not yet been able to make
the forearms meet so strong training springs were hooked to rings at the point
of each elbow and out to the post on the opposite side.� I figured another week of the constant
tension would soon have her forearms touching in the classic reverse prayer.

&nbsp;

Her head was encased
in a tightly laced discipline helmet with the glistening black leather covering
everything except her eyes, ears and two breathing holes under the nose.� Julie�s chin was resting in a padded metal cup
attached to a neck brace and a very tight gag strap circled her head.� The cup held her head facing forwards and
immobile.

&nbsp;

Substantially sized
intruders were buried inside her two lower orifices and held in place with a
leather thong that had been pulled tightly to the front and back edges of the
corset.� This left her bare buttocks
nicely available for the gadget locked to the side of the frame.

&nbsp;

Her ears were not
covered because I wanted to drive home what she had done to my brother by
letting her hear everything that went on; that was also why she could watch
through the one-way mirror.

&nbsp;

Chapter 4.

&nbsp;

Two cards
later Jim got another match.� Strange, but that had
just been enough time for the strop to be reloaded by the small electric motor.

This time he picked a
green one.

&nbsp;

Since I had stacked
both decks there were exactly fifteen jelly beans that Jim enjoyed before that
game ended.� I told my brother that I had
to leave for a moment and not to eat any more candy because they would spoil
his dinner.

&nbsp;

Leaving him at the
table I went into the next room and rubbed a hand over one of the very warm
rosy cheeks Julie was sporting.� 

&nbsp;

A movement in the
mirror caught my eye and it gave me just enough time to get my hand out
of the way as the bell rang and the strop whipped over landing yet again on
Julie�s buttocks.� 

&nbsp;

Jim had used the
mallet to ring the bell but I watched as he picked out a jelly bean and put it
in his pocket.� Well I had told him not
to eat any more.� Smart kid!

&nbsp;

�Jim comes to visit
me every two weeks Julie and I have a nice bamboo cane that fits that gadget
and there is a �cat� I bought but found it was too harsh for my regular clients
so you�ll get to try it too.� And that
dear Julie is just the beginning because I don�t eat candy that�s bad for my
figure.� I prefer other forms of exercise
as you will discover.�

&nbsp;

The strop came over
again and another candy went in Jim�s pocket.

&nbsp;

I�ve got to find a
place where I can buy jelly beans in bulk.
