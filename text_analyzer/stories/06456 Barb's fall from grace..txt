Synopsis: This is a direct sequel to Roffeless, so you should read that first.  But it is a stand alone story.  Barb, our heroine, rebels against her submissive nature...  Will she succeed in recovering her self-respect and self-worth?






 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;





"Hey Barb," Colin said over the phone, "how's it going?"



It had been five days since that night, that intense, orgasmic, traumatic, horrible night where they'd fucked me, made me beg and whimper, had stripped away my illusions, and reduced me, as they had so many other times, to sodden, satiated, fucked out cumholes.&nbsp;&nbsp; But that last time had been different, intensely different.&nbsp;&nbsp; They'd known.



Here's the thing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Colin was a scumbag.&nbsp; One night, he'd tried to slip me roofies.&nbsp; I'd spotted it and dodged it, but decided to play along for a little while anyway, just pretend.&nbsp; Originally, I'd planned to fuck him up, like he deserved.&nbsp; But one thing lead to another, and I'd been the one getting fucked.&nbsp; And liking it.&nbsp; Liking it a lot.&nbsp; It became an ongoing thing.



It had been a perfect situation.&nbsp; I let Colin and Ted keep on thinking they were drugging me, and we'd have seriously intense fucking.&nbsp; Spectactular fucking.&nbsp; Of course, they had to keep it a secret, because if they ever talked, they'd be up on rape charges.&nbsp; They could never go too far.&nbsp; I never had to acknowledge or own up to any of it.&nbsp;&nbsp; And of course, I knew all along, so I was really in control.



All that fell apart five nights ago, when I learned that instead of being the one in control, they'd been playing me all along.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe that made the sex more brutal and intense than usual.&nbsp; I came and came.



But when it was over, the next day, I didn't feel very good.&nbsp; They knew.&nbsp; They've been using me all along.&nbsp; Playing me for a fool.&nbsp; I was devastated.&nbsp; I felt violated.&nbsp; I spent the next couple of days alternating between crying and getting angry. How dare they make a fool of me?&nbsp; How dare they use me like a slut whore? I was a total yo yo.



It was scary too.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now that the pretending was over, now that they knew and I knew they knew, it was unknown territory.&nbsp; I mean, what if they wanted more?&nbsp; I didn't know that I wanted to keep fucking them under the new rules.&nbsp; But they had pictures, and they'd done a lot....&nbsp;&nbsp; It was very open to all sorts of terrifying possibilities.



One thing for sure, I promised myself in those first few days:&nbsp;&nbsp; It's over.&nbsp; Seriously over.&nbsp; Colin and Ted were scumbags and nerds.&nbsp; They weren't the sorts of guys I could ever imagine dating or even being friends with.&nbsp;&nbsp; Our relationship had only been sexual, and only under very specific conditions.&nbsp; Those conditions no longer applied.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



I didn't like them to start with.&nbsp; The fact that they'd fooled me and used me didn't endear them.



It had all been a sexual adventure.&nbsp;&nbsp; A great one, a fantastic one, I'd done unbelievably kinky things.&nbsp; But now, that adventure was over, and it was time to get back to my life, to a real life.&nbsp;&nbsp; The only question was what kind of fallout I'd have to deal with from these assholes.&nbsp; But whatever it was, I would handle it.



That resolution helped to calm me down, help me get sorted out.&nbsp;&nbsp; It didn't take the sting out, but it did put things in perspective.&nbsp;&nbsp; As the days wore on, I even relaxed more, starting to recapture some sense of confidence and superiority.



Oh, and the sex had been so hot.&nbsp; I was starting to get wet just thinking about it again, reliving experiences, playing with myself.



So I was kind of glad when Colin phoned.&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean, one of us was going to have to call.&nbsp; The fact that I'd waited him out, had forced him to make the move, was a victory for me.&nbsp; He was calling me.&nbsp; I wasn't calling him.&nbsp; Point for Barb.



"Hey Colin," I tried to reply nonchalantly, "going okay.&nbsp; You?"



I'd gone a little dry in the mouth when I'd heard his voice, I'd had to swallow and my voice had cracked a little.&nbsp; I had major butterflies, my heart had pounded, and I'd gone weak in the knees.&nbsp; But it was the phone, so he couldn't see any of this.&nbsp; 



"Things are okay over here."



"Cool."



I wasn't giving him anything.



"I suppose there are some things we need to talk about."



"Yeah," I said.



"I should come over there," he said, "so we can talk face to face."



My heart started racing.&nbsp;&nbsp; I sat down.



"No," I said, trying to keep the tremble out of my voice.&nbsp; Be strong, Barb, I thought to myself.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look, its over.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a game, its finished.&nbsp;&nbsp; We all had fun, fine.&nbsp; But I don't appreciate being called stupid or self absorbed or any of that shit."



"Sorry Barb," he said, he actually sounded chastened.&nbsp;&nbsp; "But..."



"I want my pictures.&nbsp;&nbsp; And I want your promise, and Ted's promise that you're not going to talk about any of this."



"I have some, Ted's got the others," he said.&nbsp; "I can call Ted and we can come over."



My cunt clenched, suddenly wet.&nbsp;&nbsp; The two of them over here.&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't quite trust myself, I didn't want to let them into my home, it would be like inviting them to more.



"No," I said quickly, "you can't come over.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll go over to your place."



"Should I call Ted?"



"No," I replied.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Just you alone.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'll deal with Ted separately."



"Okay, Barb."



Go Barb!&nbsp; I thought.



"I'll drop by tomorrow."



"Oh..."&nbsp; Colin replied.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sorry Barb, I can't do tomorrow.&nbsp;&nbsp; How about today, around seven?"



My stomach fluttered.



"I don't think so..."&nbsp; I said.



"Well, I'm going to be pretty busy for the next few days.&nbsp;&nbsp; How about Friday?&nbsp; Or Saturday?"



Shit, I thought, that was five days away.&nbsp; I squeezed my legs together.&nbsp; I couldn't wait that long.&nbsp; I mean, there were the pictures, and they might talk, and we needed to get things sorted out.&nbsp; I just couldn't wait another five days.&nbsp; Who knows what might happen in that time?&nbsp; 



"I'll deal with Ted then," I said.



"Ted won't be available either," Colin said.&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's tonight or nothing."



Was he pushing me?&nbsp; His voice seemed so carefully neutral.



I chewed my lip, thinking.



"Barb?"



"Okay, fine," I said.&nbsp; "I'll drop over tonight."



"Seven pm."



"I heard you."



"Good."



"Alone.&nbsp; No Ted."



"Certainly."



"All right.&nbsp; See you then."



"And Barb, one last thing...."



"Yeah."



"Dress sexy."



I hung up.



I leaned back in my chair, listening to the dial tone before finally shutting off the phone.&nbsp; One hand crept to my crotch, where my thighs were firmly pressed together.&nbsp; I could feel myself already wet.&nbsp; I was almost amazed at the effect just talking had had on my.&nbsp; My nipples were so hard they were aching, and I could feel my hips rolling involuntarily.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was glad I hadn't allowed them to come here.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was absolutely certain that if I had, it would have ended up with them fucking me.



No, the way to handle them was one at a time.



And keep the upper hand.



Yes, I had to keep the upper hand with them.



I was pleased with how I'd handled Colin on the phone.&nbsp;&nbsp; He pushed, I pushed back, he folded.&nbsp; I laid down the line, he backed off.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



The sexual relationship was done, but I would have to shut it down carefully.&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean, you couldn't just cut it off and disengage.&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't want them blabbing, or pictures showing up on the net.&nbsp; I couldn't afford them carrying a grudge, or trying to be demanding, or getting like stalkers.&nbsp; They had to be managed and controlled.&nbsp; Fine, I could handle that.



As I thought it through, my legs slipped open, spreading further and further apart.&nbsp;&nbsp; My fingers slid under my sweats, beneath my panties, feeling pubic stubble.&nbsp; I began to make little circles around my clit.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was going to miss it, I thought.&nbsp;&nbsp; Too bad it had to end.



But it did have to end.



It was them or me.



The day passed slowly.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was hard to concentrate.&nbsp; I kept flashing back on my last fucking, on other fuckings, and getting really wet.&nbsp; I replayed my phone call with Colin over and over, trying tp pick it apart for nuances.&nbsp; I still thought I'd done well, completely in control for sure.&nbsp;&nbsp; But it hadn't been quite as one sided as I thought.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I mean, I had agreed to go over to his place, and at the time he'd chosen.&nbsp;&nbsp; That was sort of like giving in, I supposed.&nbsp; Or it could seem like that.&nbsp; And what was that 'dress sexy' crap?&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd fucking well go over there in a potato sack, I wasn't going to dress up just because he told me.



Very important to keep the high ground I decided.&nbsp; I wouldn't go over to his place.&nbsp; I'd call him up and arrange to meet at a neutral place.&nbsp; Someplace public?&nbsp;&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Not too public though.&nbsp; I didn't want him to think I was scared of him.&nbsp; And there were intimate things to talk about.&nbsp; 



I tried to call him back to tell him that the plan was changed.&nbsp;&nbsp; We'd work out a neutral place.&nbsp; His phone was busy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Damn.



I tried a few more times that day, but the line was always busy.&nbsp; Fuck, I thought.&nbsp; I was going to have to go over to his place.&nbsp; 



Oh well, I decided.&nbsp; It wasn't really a concession or compromise or anything.&nbsp; Maybe, on reflection, it wasn't the best option.&nbsp; But it was only the original plan.&nbsp; It wasn't as if I was giving in on something.



What to wear?



His 'dress sexy' comment rankled me.&nbsp; It was as if he figured I was just going to show up, get on my knees and start sucking his cock.&nbsp; Forget that.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was over, and he'd better get that through his head.&nbsp; I was finished being a sex toy.



At first, I thought, okay, show up in dirty jeans and an old sweater.



But then I thought, well, I didn't want to show up looking like shit.&nbsp; I mean, that was too obviously rebellious, which would show weakness.&nbsp; I mean, if I had to rebel, then wasn't I admitting he had power?&nbsp;&nbsp; Also, if I went over and looked like crap, then that would sort of make me look weak.



I went over it as I showered.&nbsp; I should definitely look my best.&nbsp; Not sexy.&nbsp; But good.



After the shower, I shaved my legs, and then my pussy, removing the pubic stubble that I'd allowed to grow.&nbsp; Not for them of course.&nbsp; Colin was never coming near this smooth velvet pussy, I thought, as I slipped a finger inside and remembered how hard he'd shoved his big hard cock in.&nbsp;&nbsp; I found myself starting to masturbate.&nbsp;&nbsp; No.&nbsp; My pussy was smooth for me, as a sign, as an expression of my confidence and power.&nbsp; He wouldn't see it, wouldn't touch it, but I would stand there and know.&nbsp; It would give me strength.



What to wear?&nbsp;&nbsp; Not slutty.&nbsp; I thought of the ultra-short skirt with a slit that they'd had me buy and that I'd worn on my last visit over.&nbsp; Nope, definitely not.&nbsp; That would send the wrong kind of message.&nbsp;&nbsp; Jeans, slacks?&nbsp; No.&nbsp; Something formal?&nbsp; No, I was going for a visit, not a job interview.&nbsp; 



Casual then?&nbsp;&nbsp; A summer dress?&nbsp; No, a one piece outfit might be too provocative.&nbsp;&nbsp; Eventually I settled on a white flounce skirt with hem just above the knee, and a low cut, black tank top with spaghetti straps.&nbsp;&nbsp; Matching black bra and panties, nothing fancy.



I checked myself out in the mirror.&nbsp;&nbsp; Okay.&nbsp; I looked good.&nbsp; Sexy, well yeah.&nbsp;&nbsp; But the sort of sexy of a pretty girl having a walk in the park.&nbsp; Definitely not a slut out to get fucked.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was casual, comfortable, summer-wear.



How long?&nbsp;&nbsp; An hour to go.&nbsp;&nbsp; Enough time to fix my hair and make up.&nbsp; Good.



Finally, it was time.&nbsp; 



As I walked over to Colin's apartment, I could feel myself getting wet.&nbsp;&nbsp; Well, I told myself, that was normal.&nbsp; You couldn't be going to see someone who had fucked you so hard so many times and not feel arousal in a situation like this.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was glad I hadn't given into the temptation and masturbated to orgasm before I'd gone over.&nbsp; I was afraid that if I'd done that, I might have been in a slightly submissive post-orgasmic state when I saw him.&nbsp; Or even been maybe just a bit more accepting or docile.&nbsp; No, I didn't need that.&nbsp; I needed to be strong.



I could handle a little arousal.&nbsp; I just had to be strong.



Be strong, Barb, I kept telling myself.&nbsp; Be strong.



It was just that my clit kept throbbing.&nbsp; 



Every time I took a step, I could feel how wet I was.



I had total butterflies by the time I arrived at Colin's place.&nbsp;&nbsp; I rang.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; He wasn't in.&nbsp;&nbsp; I checked my watch.&nbsp; Ten minutes to seven?&nbsp; He had to be in there.&nbsp; I knocked on the door.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; I knocked again.



I reddened.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



Had he stood me up?&nbsp; Forgot about our appointment?&nbsp;&nbsp; Or was he psyching me out, waiting.&nbsp; I should fucking well walk away, I decided.



I didn't move.&nbsp; Instead, I chewed my fingernail and rang the doorbell a few more times.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp; Screw this.&nbsp; I decided to walk away, turning on my heel and stalking away.&nbsp; But the further I got from his house, the more my courage deserted me.&nbsp; This was serious.&nbsp; If I blew off an appointment, would he be mad?&nbsp; What would he do?&nbsp; Could I really afford to piss him off?&nbsp; I needed to sort things out.



Half a block away, I decided to turn around.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had to give it one last try.&nbsp; If he wasn't there, fuck him.&nbsp; My legs were shaking as I walked up his drive again.



This time, the door opened on the third knock.



"You're late," Colin said.



I blushed.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was five past seven.



"I ... uhm, I knocked, and rang..."



He just stared at me.



"I was here early."



"Really?"



"Yes.&nbsp; Yeah.&nbsp; Ten to.&nbsp;&nbsp; But..."



"Are you sure?"



"Uhm... "



"Never mind.&nbsp; Come in."



Fuck, I thought, that had gone badly.



Be strong, Barb, I thought to myself.&nbsp; Be strong.&nbsp;&nbsp; He was just a douchebag.&nbsp; If I pushed, he'd fold, like always.&nbsp; All I had to do was keep control.&nbsp; Be strong.



To my frustration, he was as cool as could be.&nbsp; If he shared any of my nervousness and frustration, it didn't show.&nbsp; Immediately, I felt at a disadvantage, it was unfair that he should be so calm.



"Nice to see you again, Barb," he said.



I licked my lips nervously.&nbsp; My mouth was so dry.



"Whatever," I replied.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fuck, what a lame response.



"I mean," I stammered, "I'm not here to visit.&nbsp; We have to talk."



He shrugged.



"So, what do you have to say, Barb."



What?&nbsp;&nbsp; This wasn't the way I imagined it going.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



"Well, it's over."



"What is?"



Err....



"Uhm... you know, what we were doing.&nbsp; It's over.&nbsp; It's finished.&nbsp; Done."



"What's over?"



"You know."



"No..."



Fuck.&nbsp; I reddened angrily.&nbsp; 



"What are you talking about Barb," he asked.&nbsp; "The fucking."



"Yeah," I burst out.&nbsp; "The fucking, it's finished.&nbsp; I'm not doing it any more."



"Hmmm..." he said.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Okay."



What?&nbsp;&nbsp; Is it that easy?&nbsp;&nbsp; I expected more...&nbsp; Something.&nbsp; I expected argument, or threats, or begging or some sort of conflict.&nbsp;&nbsp; Not... 'okay.'



"Well," I said finally, deflated,&nbsp; "that's good then."



There was an awkward silence.



"And...&nbsp; And... I want the pictures and stuff."



"What pictures, Barb?"



"Don't play games, Colin," I snapped.



He didn't reply.



A minute crept by.



"The pictures of me fucking," I said finally.&nbsp; "And naked.&nbsp; And the videos.&nbsp; All the pictures...&nbsp; Of me."



"Oh," Colin said.&nbsp; "Those."



"Yeah, those."



He shrugged.



"No."



What?



"What?"&nbsp; I asked.



"No."



"Those are my pictures.&nbsp; Those are of me," I snapped, building a head of anger.&nbsp; I am woman, I thought.&nbsp; I'm strong.&nbsp; Stand up and he'll back down.&nbsp; "You have no right to them.&nbsp; I want them, and I want them all.&nbsp; If you think I'll stand here and let you blackmail me "



"Is that what you want?"&nbsp; Colin asked.



What the fuck?&nbsp; I was completely derailed.



"What are you talking about?"



"You want to be blackmailed?" he asked.&nbsp; "Sorry.&nbsp; Not doing it."



"Excuse me?"



"I'm not going to blackmail you.&nbsp; Forget it."



"I'm not asking...&nbsp;&nbsp; What the fuck!"



"You brought it up," Colin said.&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't.&nbsp;&nbsp; You put it on the table."



But... but... but...



"Well, that doesn't mean..."&nbsp; I said desperately, searching my thoughts.&nbsp; Had I brought it up.&nbsp; Yes.&nbsp; But I wasn't suggesting that he do it.&nbsp; At the thought of being blackmailed, my knees went a little weak.&nbsp; I could feel myself getting wetter.&nbsp;&nbsp; But that didn't mean anything.&nbsp; Did it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Did I unconsciously want?&nbsp; Was I suggesting without realizing?



No, I gathered myself.&nbsp; Screw him.&nbsp; He was head fucking me.



"I'm not playing that game."



"You think I'm here to play a game," I said incredulously.&nbsp; "You fucking asshole.&nbsp; Screw you.&nbsp; I'm here to tell you it's over, and I want everything back.&nbsp; It's finished, the door is closed, it's over."



"Okay," he said, without apparent concern.&nbsp; It threw me.



"I want my stuff."



"No."



"Don't fuck with me Colin," I warned him, "I didn't come over here for your stupid games."



"No," he said.&nbsp; "You came over because you need a good fucking."



Butterflies roiled through my guts, my mouth was bone dry.&nbsp; I could feel my heart pounding in my ribs so hard I thought it was going to punch out.&nbsp;&nbsp; No, I thought desperately, that wasn't true.&nbsp; But then, why was my cunt spasming, I could practically feel my wetness trickling down my legs.&nbsp; No, no, no, I thought weakly.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



"You're the one playing games, Barb.&nbsp; I'm not doing it.&nbsp; You want it, get on your knees for it."



I was speechless. 



"I don't need you for...&nbsp; that..."&nbsp; I said finally.&nbsp; "I mean..."&nbsp;&nbsp; 



You know, I thought.&nbsp; Men practically grow on trees.&nbsp;&nbsp; I could walk down the street and find someone if I wanted too.&nbsp; I didn't need them. 



 "What's so special...&nbsp; Who the fuck do you think you are?"



&nbsp; 



"Come on, Barb," Colin said, "you know you crave it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Even without us, you've gone out on dates."



"So what," I said, gathering some resemblance of force.&nbsp; "I've dated guys.&nbsp; Sort of shows you and Ted aren't essential."



"Want me to tell you how they went?&nbsp;&nbsp; They fucked you Barb."&nbsp;&nbsp; 



I bit my lip a little, surprised.&nbsp; How did he know that?&nbsp; Had I said something during our encounters. He must have kept tabs.



"We're not talking dating and building a relationship and petting and first base and second base or any of that shit.&nbsp;&nbsp; On the first date, you spread your legs for guys you'd never met before.&nbsp;&nbsp; You are so used to getting fucked, you're so conditioned to be fucked, that you just let them fuck you.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hell, it didn't even wait to the end of the date.&nbsp;&nbsp; It just seemed to happen, didn't it."



"It's not true," I said, blushing brightly.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who told you that?"



It was absolutely true, I just didn't want to admit it.



"You're getting a reputation, Barb," Colin barked a laugh.&nbsp; "And that's not anything Ted or I did.&nbsp; That's your doing.&nbsp; You're getting a reputation as a girl who spreads her legs easy.&nbsp; You're getting a reputation as a slut, Barb."



I felt myself growing hot, blushing and flushed all over my body.&nbsp;&nbsp; How dare he talk to me like that.



"Fuck you," I snapped.&nbsp; But he cut me off.



"But let me tell you a secret, Barb," he said, "all those dates you spread your legs for..."



"Stop saying that."



"All those dates you spread your legs for cock," he continued, "somehow, it's not as good, is it.&nbsp; You come away feeling...&nbsp; Unfufilled?&nbsp; Unsatisfied?&nbsp; There's something missing isn't there."



"I'm not discussing my sex life with you," I said defensively.



"Do you even come?"



"I said..."



"You don't, do you?"&nbsp; He pressed.



I bit my lip.&nbsp; What was I going to say?&nbsp; That I didn't come?&nbsp; That I came?&nbsp; That I came but it wasn't as good?&nbsp; It was a trap.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fuck it, I wasn't going to go down this road at all.



But the fact was, he was right.&nbsp; He was appallingly right.&nbsp;&nbsp; I didn't come.&nbsp; But on the few dates I'd been on since this thing had started, I'd become... easier.&nbsp;&nbsp; I'd wound up spreading my legs to be fucked far too soon, almost right away, they'd moved on me and found no resistance, moved further and I just kept giving in.



But I hadn't come.&nbsp; No matter how easily I'd opened for them, no matter how they possessed me, there'd been something missing.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



"You know why you don't come, Barb?"



"I didn't say I didn't come!" I said hotly, and then caught myself.



"You came then?"



He waited for me to say something more.&nbsp; Forget it, I thought.&nbsp; You're not trapping me.



"Because they're just fucking you.&nbsp; That's all.&nbsp; But Ted and Me, all the time that you were playing drugged out slut, well, we knew.&nbsp; But we were learning to push your buttons, figuring you out.&nbsp; And we were making sure you came.&nbsp;&nbsp; We always made sure you came.&nbsp;&nbsp; Do you want to know why?"



"Why?"&nbsp; I said sarcastically, trying to keep my voice steady.&nbsp; 



I was sick of this whole psychodrama bullshit line.&nbsp; It was affecting me a lot more than I wanted to let on.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



"Because we wanted to make sure you kept crawling back to us.&nbsp;&nbsp; And you did crawl back.... every time.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just like now."



Just like now.&nbsp;&nbsp; I could feel my cunt spasm suddenly&nbsp;&nbsp; The thought of it made me weak.&nbsp; My heart was hammering inside my ribs, my insides were full of butterflies.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was so fucking wet.



"Fuck you," I snapped.&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm not crawling."



He stepped towards me.



I stepped back automatically.



He took another step into my personal space.&nbsp; He was very close.



He expected me to back up again.&nbsp; Playing this childish fucking dominance game.



Well, I wasn't going to play.&nbsp; I stood right there, feeling him looming inside my personal space.



Breathe normally, I forced myself.



Be strong, Barb.&nbsp; 



"Can we stop playing these games," I said, trying to sound tough.&nbsp; "Let's just sit down and sort this out."



"Do you want to sit down, Barb?"&nbsp; He asked.



Neutral question, I thought.&nbsp; Safe to answer.



"Yes, I would like to sit down."



I needed to sit down, my legs felt like rubber.&nbsp; I was afraid he could see them trembling.&nbsp; 



"No."



What?



"Get down on your knees, Barb."



I blushed hot.&nbsp; For a second, I couldn't meet his eyes.



"Fuck..." fuck you, I thought, fuck you.&nbsp; "fuck...that."&nbsp; I mumbled.



I swallowed.



"I'm not getting on my knees in front of you, forget it.&nbsp; That's not what I came here for.&nbsp; So forget it."



He didn't reply.



A long moment passed.



I found it harder to look at him.



"I'm not going to do it just because you say it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Who do you think you are?"



He still didn't reply.



I muttered and mumbled something else.&nbsp;&nbsp; Argue, dammit.&nbsp; Respond.&nbsp; His silence was oppressive.&nbsp; 



If only he'd reply, it would give me something to push back against.&nbsp;&nbsp; If there was a conversation, then you know, that would be the focus.&nbsp; But he wouldn't reply, and so his command hung heavily in the air.



"I should just leave," I said without conviction.&nbsp; My voice felt flat and without confidence.&nbsp; "I'm going to leave....&nbsp; Right now."



"No," there was something blunt and flat about that.



Turn around, I thought, turn around and head for the door.&nbsp; If he touches you, scream.&nbsp; But somehow, I couldn't.&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt held in place.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was starting to tremble all over.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



I couldn't run, I thought, that would show weakness.&nbsp;&nbsp; If I tried to leave, I'd be showing him I was weak, that I was afraid of him.&nbsp; Then back up, I told myself.&nbsp;&nbsp; Move.&nbsp; Except that would be weakness too.



I could only stand there, trembling, under the awful weight of his command.



And still, he refused to say anything.&nbsp; The silence was worst of all.&nbsp;&nbsp; I could hear my own breathing getting louder, feel the trembling in my muscles.



Don't kneel, I told myself.&nbsp; Whatever you do, don't kneel.



"Are we going to stand here all day?" I mumbled.&nbsp; "Say something."



But he didn't need to say anything.&nbsp;&nbsp; He knew what he wanted me to do.&nbsp; I knew it.&nbsp;&nbsp; The order, his will, seemed to hang in the air around me, like a physical presence.



My knees felt so weak.&nbsp;&nbsp; How long could this go on.



Another moment passed.



My knees started to bend.



No, no!&nbsp; I thought.&nbsp;&nbsp; Don't!



But it was like I was no longer in control of my body.&nbsp; The minute my knee started to bend, it seemed to be like an avalanche.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was carried along, not quite in control.



I knelt in front of him.



"Good girl," Colin said with a deep satisfaction that shamed and humiliated me.



I stared at his feet.



"This doesn't mean anything," I insisted quietly.



"Of course not," he agreed.



He ran his fingers through my hair.&nbsp; I tossed my head, throwing his hand off.&nbsp; He let that happen, and ran his fingers through my hair again.&nbsp; This time, when I tossed my head, his fingers tightened in my locks and suddenly, he was gripping my hair painfully.



"I'm not doing anything," I whispered.&nbsp; "I'm not going to suck your cock and you can't make me.&nbsp; Your stupid game doesn't go any further."



"I'm not going to make you do anything, Barb."



Then why am I on my knees?&nbsp;&nbsp; Why is your hand in my hair, holding my head?&nbsp;&nbsp; This went through my mind, but I didn't say it.



Get up, I told myself.&nbsp;&nbsp; But I couldn't make my legs move.&nbsp; His hand gripped my head, holding me inplace.&nbsp; My whole body felt weak and submissive, I trembled like a leaf.&nbsp; My heart was racing.&nbsp; I couldn't seem to breath right.



"Please," I whispered.



"Please what, Barb?"



His free hand reached for his fly.



With a trembling, fluttering hand, I somehow reached up to put my hand on his, stopping him.



"Please .... don't take it out."



I could feel his amusement.



"Take your hand away, Barb."



My hand dropped, will-less.



"You don't want me to take my cock out?"



He unzipped.



"N... N... No."



He reached in.&nbsp; Oh god, he was going to take it out.



"Why?"



I could see his hand inside his pants, stroking his cock.&nbsp; I stared fascinated, despite myself.



"Why, Barb?"



I couldn't answer, I couldn't speak.&nbsp; Because, I knew that if it came out....



He drew it out, that big porn star cock.&nbsp; It never seemed so huge, like a pink serpent, the shaft thick and venous.&nbsp; The head like a swelling crown.&nbsp;&nbsp; Butterflies surged through me.&nbsp; I think if not for the hand holding my hair tightly, I might have gone completely boneless.



"That's not so bad," he whispered.&nbsp; "Is it, Barb."



Oh god, I thought.&nbsp; Oh god.



It was swelling in front of me, thick and heavy, stirring to life.&nbsp; I could smell it, smell the rich deep maleness, the acrid tang of his balls and manhood.&nbsp;&nbsp; I couldn't even look away.&nbsp; I was caught, hypnotized by the size and shape of it, by the richness of its colour, the sheen of it, the smell, the sense of aliveness, the desire.



I whimpered.



"It's okay, Barb," he said.&nbsp; "All you have to do is give it a kiss."



I gave a tiny moan.



We both knew it wouldn't stop there.



"Just a little kiss."



He drew my head towards it.&nbsp; It seemed to be aware of me, rising and swelling even as I came closer.



A kiss, I thought desperately.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just a kiss, and maybe it will be over.&nbsp; He'll have made his point.



I closed my eyes, pursed my lips, felt the tip of it pressing.&nbsp; I could feel the little peehole of the urethra, the notch in the glans, pressing against my lips.&nbsp; I swallowed involuntarily, and my lips parted just a bit.&nbsp;&nbsp; Its scent was stronger now that I was right in front of his crotch, filling my nostrils.&nbsp; 

Don't open your eyes, I thought.&nbsp; Kiss it and it will be over.&nbsp;&nbsp; All he wants is a kiss.&nbsp; This is just a stupid game.&nbsp; I kissed it, submitting to his game.



But he didn't take it away.&nbsp; It kept pressing against my lips.&nbsp; I couldn't help swallowing again, my lips parting even more.&nbsp; It began to press, or perhaps he was pushing on the back of my head, not hard, but with a gentle, insistent presence.&nbsp;&nbsp; Slowly my jaws parted, mouth opening in slow surrender.&nbsp;&nbsp; First the head of his cock slid past my lips, I could feel the shape of him as my lips opened and sealed around his growing violation.&nbsp; I felt the head on my tongue, tasted his precome.&nbsp; And then ever so slowly, as I whimpered around it, he slid the shaft, millimeter by millimeter, inch by inch.



I tried not to think of it, tried not to think at all.&nbsp; Some part of me was screaming to resist.&nbsp; But I couldn't seem to connect with it.&nbsp; I could feel my cunt spasming, wetness soaking my panties.&nbsp; A wave of sexual hunger that seemed to rob all will from me.



Finally, I felt his balls pressing against my chin, his pubic hair against my face.&nbsp; The male smell of him overwhelmed me.&nbsp;&nbsp; He'd shoved his entire length down my throat.



"Good girl," he said.&nbsp;&nbsp; The words sent a wave of shame and guilt through me.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh god, why was I letting this happen.&nbsp; Why couldn't I stop?



He began to rock his hips, drawing his cock in and out of my face, making me gag slightly.&nbsp; He drew me forward so I was slightly off balance.&nbsp; Helpless, I put up one hand to steady myself on his thigh.



"I've got something for you, Barb."



A metal jingle.



Then cold steel clamping around my wrist.&nbsp; 



I dared open my eyes enough to see, from the corner of my vision, a handcuff clamped around my wrist.&nbsp;&nbsp; A surge of fear rippled through me.&nbsp;&nbsp; No, this was going too fast.&nbsp; It was out of control.&nbsp; I didn't want that cold metal around my wrist.



He leaned in, shoving his cock back down my throat, making me gag a little, as he pulled my hand away from his thigh, swept it back behind me.&nbsp;&nbsp; The motion pushed my face into his crotch.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had to do something, but what?



"Other hand, Barb." he ordered.



My other hand was between my legs, stroking up and down the wet surface of my panties.



"Other hand," he ordered again, his voice harsher.



I made a little sound of protest.



"Other hand, Barb," he commanded again.&nbsp; "You know you want it.&nbsp; Do you want me to tell you why?"



Oh god, I thought again.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; No.&nbsp; No.



"Because, Barb," he whispered insidiously, "right now, you are responsible.&nbsp; You're choosing.&nbsp; But once you are chained.... you're not responsible any more.&nbsp; You don't have to worry.&nbsp; Just let it ..."



There was something seductive and compelling about his words.&nbsp;&nbsp; A way out.&nbsp; I was on his knees, sucking his cock, and I couldn't seem to understand how I'd wound up here, or why I couldn't seem to stop.&nbsp; Things were out of control.&nbsp;&nbsp; Was he making me?&nbsp;&nbsp; How?&nbsp; I felt like I was being a slut, I was so ashamed by the way I couldn't stop myself from surrendering.&nbsp;&nbsp; Maybe, maybe it wouldn't be so shameful if I had no choice.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then it would just happen, but it wouldn't be me doing it....&nbsp;&nbsp; I couldn't bear this shame.&nbsp; I had to do something...



Slowly, I withdrew my hand from between my legs.&nbsp;&nbsp; Some part of me whispered 'no, no.'&nbsp; But it had no power.&nbsp;&nbsp; I kept my eyes shut tight, as I drew my free hand behind my back.



Cold steel closed around my wrist.



"That wasn't so hard, now was it, Barb?"



He drew his cock from my mouth, leaving me gasping.&nbsp; I dared to open my eyes, stared at the pink, rigid length of it slick with my saliva, shining, connected to my mouth by strands of drool.&nbsp; Oh god, why was I letting this happen?&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, I realized, there was no choice any more.&nbsp; That from this point on, he would do whatever he wanted to me and all I could do was take it.&nbsp;&nbsp; The thought left me dripping.



"You know what I like, Barb?"&nbsp; He whispered.&nbsp; "I liked how you spread your legs automatically when you knelt.&nbsp;&nbsp; I liked how instinctive it was."



My cheeks burned with shame.



"But I think you need to spread them a little more," he kicked the inside of my knee, forcing me to spread wider.&nbsp; Another kick.&nbsp; Wider, I was splayed obscenely.&nbsp;&nbsp; "There, that's better."



He reached down into my top, pulling my breasts out, squeezing my nipples.&nbsp; My body had become his toy.&nbsp;&nbsp; His touch was electric.&nbsp; Some part of me ached for his hands, ached to submit, to be used.



He stepped back, pulling me forward by my hair.&nbsp; I shifted my hips, struggling for balance.



"Uh uh," he said, "don't bring your legs together, keep them spread for me."



I writhed, but held my place.&nbsp; He drew me forward, so that it was only his hand tight and painful in my hair that kept me from falling forward.



He slapped my face.&nbsp;&nbsp; I gasped.



"Open your mouth, bitch."



I opened wide.



He thrust between my lips without gentleness, fucking my face with his will, his hips thrusting easily, uncaring of my gasping or gagging.&nbsp; Occasionally he barked orders, telling me to swallow, to roll my tongue, to lick.&nbsp; I obeyed, helpless to his will, my entire off balance body swaying under his hand holding me up by my hair and his cock thrusting down my helpless throat.&nbsp;&nbsp; All I could do was squirm, and feel this strange sexual excitement build and build.&nbsp;&nbsp; My cunt ached, I needed something inside me, it was a desperate hunger.&nbsp;&nbsp; I surrendered to him, surrendered to his domination, his degradation.&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh god, I was so wet.&nbsp;&nbsp; I wanted to beg him to fuck me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I needed to be fucked.&nbsp; By him, by anyone.&nbsp; I needed to be a desperate aching hole with a cock plunging into it.



"Hey, how's it going?"&nbsp; His voice came.&nbsp;&nbsp; Was he talking to me?



Half dazed.&nbsp; I realized he must be talking to a cell phone.



"You owe me twenty bucks."



"Yeah, she's here."



"On her knees, sucking my cock."



"No shit."



"She caved so easy."



My cheeks burned.&nbsp;&nbsp; He didn't even bother to acknowledge my humiliation.&nbsp; It was simply matter of fact.&nbsp; He knew, had known, exactly where I would end up.&nbsp;&nbsp; My cunt clenched with desperate aching need.&nbsp; 



"I told you."



"You want some?"



Suddenly, he pulled me off, I stared up at him wide eyed, chin slick with drool.



"Hey, Ted wants to fuck you up the ass.&nbsp;&nbsp; Is that okay."



"Fuck me," I whispered.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please."



He thrust down my throat, roughly jerking my head back and forth on his manhood, literally jerking himself&nbsp; off in my mouth.



"When I finish with her, I'll send her over, how's that."



They were talking about me like I wasn't there, like I was a piece of meat.&nbsp; Somehow, that just added to my mounting desire, to my need to be fucked.



"Talk to you later."



Suddenly, he grabbed my head with both hands and started thrusting violently into my mouth, my body was shaken back and forth.&nbsp; I squirmed and heaved, rocking my hips, trying to balance with my knees.&nbsp;&nbsp; One hand of his found my throat, tightened on my windpipe.&nbsp; I was gagging loudly, drool flying from around his cock, snot running from my nose, gasping for breath.



"Take it bitch, he commanded."



Then his cock hardened, swelled hot and rigid inside my mouth, and I knew he was going to come.&nbsp; I could hear his hissing.&nbsp; The head throbbed wildly.



And then he tore himself from my mouth, leaving me panting harshly, hyperventilating.&nbsp; His cock ejaculated throwing semen into my face.&nbsp; Burst after burst shot from it, getting in my hair, my face, on my breasts, dripping onto my top.&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, it dripped smoothly from his cock, as he drew me onto the head to lick up the last drops.



"Good girl," he whispered.&nbsp; Again, I felt a course of shame, and an answering wetness between my legs.&nbsp; I knew I would have that phrase.



He let me settle back on my knees, balancing myself, and let go my hair.



"There we go," he said.&nbsp; "That wasn't so bad, was it, Barb.&nbsp;&nbsp; You liked it, didn't you.&nbsp; It's what you wanted, wasn't it?"



I didn't trust myself to speak.&nbsp;&nbsp; His sperm was still oozing down my face.



"Tell you what, Barb," he said.&nbsp; "Let's make you more comfortable."



He grabbed my hair and drew me forward, this time holding me under my breasts.&nbsp; He eased me forward until my face and shoulders were pressed on the carpet.&nbsp; He walked around, inspecting me.&nbsp; 



"Arch your back more," he ordered.&nbsp; I complied.&nbsp;&nbsp; He kicked the inside of my knees, making them spread wider again.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



"Nice ass."&nbsp;&nbsp; He told me.&nbsp;&nbsp; "I guess that's why Ted loves fucking it."



At the mention of Ted, my butt cheeks clenched, I could feel my cunt spasming again.&nbsp; Was he on his way over?&nbsp; Was he going to fuck me?&nbsp; I needed to be fucked.&nbsp;&nbsp; I whined with hunger.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Cuffed as I was, bound as I was, there was no possibility of resistance, of choice, of will.&nbsp; I was simply a wet cunt that needed fucking.&nbsp; 



I'm just a wet cunt, I told myself, repeating it like a mantra.&nbsp; Not Barb.&nbsp; I tried not to think Barb, struggled to shut away my identity, to concentrate my entire being on and in the wet cunt and its need.



He flipped my skirt up, exposing my ass.



"Amost perfect," he said.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Just one more thing..."



I jumped as I felt his hand on my ass, tracing the line of my panties.&nbsp; As it went up against my crotch, I could feel him pulling on the fabric, a welcome, exquisite, excruciating pressure against my clit.&nbsp; Then with a sudden jerk, I felt him gather it, pull tight, a rending of fabric and elastic, and as I gasped, my panties were torn off me.



"Gee Barb," he told me, "you're very wet.&nbsp; Dripping."



Fingers probed me.&nbsp; I couldn't help myself, I thrust back.



"You really need to be fucked, don't you?"



Slap!



"Yes," I whispered.



Slap!&nbsp; 



"What?"



"Yes," I said loudly.



Slap!



"Yes what, Bitch?"



"Yes... Master!"&nbsp; I almost shouted, half sobbing.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes I really need to be fucked.&nbsp; I need to come so badly.&nbsp;&nbsp; Please fuck me."



"Good girl."



My ass cheeks burned from his slaps.



"Do you want me to fuck you?"



"Yes... Master."&nbsp;&nbsp; I hadn't called him Master since that night.&nbsp; It had been the only time I'd called him Master.&nbsp;&nbsp; Now using the word, it seemed to reach deep inside me, burrowing into a core of submissive hunger I'd barely acknowledged.



"Sorry," he said cheerfully.&nbsp; "I'm done using you.&nbsp; But I'm sure Ted will be willing to make you come."



I could hear him standing up behind me.&nbsp;&nbsp; I stared at the carpet that my face was pressed into, waiting.



"Okay, Barb," he said.&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have to take care of a couple of things, but I want you to stay right where you are, right as you are.&nbsp;&nbsp; You look good, all drenched with sperm, face in the carpet, back arched, wrists cuffed behind you, legs spread and ass up and out.&nbsp;&nbsp; Hold that pose."



Suddenly, he was kneeling beside me.



"If you move a fucking millimeter, I swear I will whip your brainless ass raw!&nbsp; Do you understand?"



I froze up, and hiccupped a nod.&nbsp;&nbsp; He sounded scary.



I don't know how long I was in that position.&nbsp; Maybe five or ten minutes.&nbsp; How long did he intend to leave me here.&nbsp; It was humiliating.&nbsp; But it only fed my submission.&nbsp; I thought about moving, but was a little afraid to.



I heard the door opening.



"Here we are," Colin's voice came.



"Well, well, well," someone else, not Ted, said.&nbsp; "I definitely liked the view."



My bared ass and cunt, raised and upthrust for fucking was in plain view of the door.&nbsp; I blushed hot at the thought of an absolute stranger seeing me like this.



"It's not bad," Colin said.&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm just going to grab Ted's address, and you can bring her over."



Colin seemed to leave the room.



Behind me, I could feel someone approaching.&nbsp; I started, gasping at the feel of hands lightly touching my ass, but made no resistance.&nbsp;&nbsp; The hand became bolder, cupping my ass.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fingers brushed against my cunt, making me wet all over again.



"She's a hot one," someone said behind me.



"Yeah, totally submissive slut," Colin's voice came from the room.



"What's her name?"



"Who cares?&nbsp;&nbsp; She's just a wet cunt." 



My cheeks burned, a hot flush curling over my body.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was hard to breathe.



"Hey, do you mind if I...."



He wasn't going to offer me to a complete stranger!&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh god, no.&nbsp; I mean, Colin...&nbsp; Ted... that was okay.&nbsp; But this?



"Be my guest," Colin said, "have a quickie, only don't fuck her ass, that's Ted's.&nbsp; He'll want it tight... or as tight as she gets these days."&nbsp; He laughed.



I flushed hot and bright with shame.



"And she's not allowed to come."



"She can't come?"



I whined at that.&nbsp; Oh fuck, they were playing me again.&nbsp; I hated it, and hated how well it worked at reducing me to mewling meat.&nbsp; I involuntarily humped gently against his fingers.



"Not until Ted fucks her up the ass."



A sense of a shrug behind me.



"That's cool.&nbsp; Got a rubber?"



"Don't bother."



"I dunno...."



"She's clean.&nbsp; Are you clean?"



"Yeah, I'm clean."



"So the only thing to worry about is knocking her up, and that's her problem, not yours."



Laughter.&nbsp;&nbsp; Humiliating laughter.



"That's a pretty good case."



Fumbling behind me.&nbsp;&nbsp; No wait, I thought, finger me more.&nbsp; Stroke me.&nbsp; It felt as if he was simply taking out his cock and...



He thrust hard into me with one brutal stroke.&nbsp; I gasped out loud, arching my back, squirming.&nbsp; He grabbed my hips hard to hold me in place as he pushed my face hard into the carpet again and again, humping me, thrusting into me cruelly, deeply, so intensely it almost hurt.&nbsp; Oh god, I was so humiliated, being used just like a piece of meat.&nbsp; My cunt spasmed around him, getting wetter and wetter.&nbsp; I was getting close, I was getting so close...



And then I could feel him coming inside me, his hands gripping my ass so tight as to leave bruises.&nbsp; He pushed so hard and so deep my body was shoved flat into the carpet, the coarse fabric rough on my tender skin.&nbsp;&nbsp; He slammed into me.&nbsp; I could feel my own orgasm starting to build, moaning, my body writhing....



And then I cried out with frustration as he pulled out.&nbsp; I felt him spurting the rest of his come over my ass and thighs.&nbsp; I tried to jam my legs together, tried to hump the carpet, desperately seeking that last little bit of pressure that would pitch me over.



"Don't let her come," Colin warned.



"Please!&nbsp; Please!&nbsp; Please master!&nbsp;&nbsp; I need to!" I whined.



"Don't let her."



"Oh the bitch is so fucking close."



The stranger held me pinned helplessly, my thrashing unable to get me closer to that blissful orgasm.&nbsp; Finally, as I gasped and moaned, it subsided.&nbsp;&nbsp; I was still at a fever of arousal, but I knew I'd lost the orgasm.



"That's why she's cuffed," Colin explained.&nbsp; "So she can't bring herself off."



You bastard, I thought.&nbsp;&nbsp; You cruel, cruel bastard.&nbsp; It had been so close I could taste it.&nbsp; The tiniest little effort would have brought me there.



I could feel cool drafts around my now opened cunt.&nbsp; Feel cold semen trickling slowly down my thighs.&nbsp;&nbsp; I stared at the carpet, a tears beginning to form in my eyes.



Abruptly, I felt Colin bending over me, his hands wrapping tightly, painfully in my hair.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



"Up we go, Barb," Colin said, dragging me back by my hair.&nbsp; My cheek slid against carpet as I folded back on my knees and then he lifted me painfully up onto my haunches.&nbsp;&nbsp; I whined in protest.



"Up," he repeated.&nbsp; Dragged by my hair, I struggled painfully to my feet, standing unsteady.&nbsp; "Good girl." he said.



I blinked.&nbsp; It seemed hard to think.&nbsp; My submission, this spell of docility that had fallen over me seemed to slow my uptake.&nbsp; I stared at the other man in the room, and knew he must be the one who had fucked me.



I'd never seen him before.&nbsp; He was older, close to middle aged, dressed casually, wearing a jacket.



"This is your cab driver, Barb," Colin said.&nbsp; "He'll take you over to Ted."



My skirt had fallen down from where Colin had flipped it up to, but my breasts still hung out.&nbsp; The cab driver admired them appreciatively, making no secret of his hungry gaze.&nbsp; It made me feel dirty.&nbsp; And wet.



Maybe he would fuck me again?&nbsp;&nbsp; The thought came out of nowhere.&nbsp; It surprised me with its hunger.



Colin pulled the spaghetti straps of my top up, concealing, oh just barely concealing my hard nipples.&nbsp; A strap fell from my shoulder, he pulled it up again.



"You going to take the cuffs off?"&nbsp; The cab driver asked.



"Nah," Colin replied.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ted's got a key."



I was going to go over in chains?&nbsp; Oh god.&nbsp; It was unbearable.&nbsp; My knees started to tremble, my legs felt like they were made of water.



"Besides," Colin said silkily.&nbsp; "She prefers it this way."



What?



"What?" the cab driver asked.



"Oh sure, Colin," told him.&nbsp; "You see, she's just a cock hungry whore, a complete slut, and she knows it...&nbsp; But..."



Don't say it, I thought, my body flushing with shame.&nbsp; Don't say it out loud.&nbsp; Don't say it to this complete stranger.



"But as long as she's wearing these cuffs, she can pretend to herself that its not her fault.&nbsp; That she's not really a cock whore.&nbsp;&nbsp; That we're making her."



The cab driver laughed.&nbsp; I couldn't face them.&nbsp; I stared hard at the floor in front of my feet.



"That's fucked up," the cab driver laughed.



Colin laughed too, adding to my disgrace.&nbsp;&nbsp; "It sure is.&nbsp; But it works for us."



Then he slapped my ass.



"Your chariot awaits, cunt.&nbsp; Try to not get your cunt juice all over his seat, or he'll have to clean it."



And with that, a little push started me walking.



I felt weightless following the cab driver down the stairs, an observer in my own body, things seemed to happen, and I just drifted along on the current of circumstance.



At the cab, the driver held the door open.&nbsp; I couldn't open it, still cuffed as I was.&nbsp; He helped me into the cab, taking the opportunity to grope my cunt and breasts.&nbsp;&nbsp; A spaghetti strap fell from my shoulder, exposing one breast.&nbsp; He stared at it for a second, and then pinched the nipple, and slipped a seat belt around it.&nbsp;&nbsp; He stared at me sitting there in his cab, and then with a casual gesture, reached between my knees and spread them apart.&nbsp;&nbsp; He ran one hand along my mound.



"Nice," he said.&nbsp; "Smooth."



As he slammed the cab door, my legs remained spread.



The trip to Ted's was quick.&nbsp;&nbsp; The cab driver groped me again as he opened the door, undid the seatbelt and helped me out.&nbsp; As a casual afterthought, he pulled up the spaghetti strap on my top, barely concealing my nipple.



"Is that it?"&nbsp; I asked.&nbsp;&nbsp; The brief ride had allowed me to regain some coherence.&nbsp; In the haze of lust and submission, I'd managed to put together some thought.



Ted lived in a house with some roommates.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a short walkway to the front door.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



Walking away wasn't an option.&nbsp;&nbsp; Here I was, my hair disshelved, breasts practically falling out, semen dripping down my face and between my legs, hands cuffed behind my back.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had no choice but to go there.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ted had the key.



No choice.



No will.



I walked up, and kicked at the door.&nbsp;&nbsp; It opened.



A strange man stood there.&nbsp;&nbsp; He stared with surprise at my full lips and heaving breasts, the strands of sperm glistening on my skin.



"I'm here to see Ted," I mumbled.



He continued to stare.



Slowly, I flushed red.



"Ted?"&nbsp; I repeated.



"Are you some sort of hooker?" he asked finally, completing my shame.



People were walking by on the sidewalk.&nbsp; I could tell they were staring.&nbsp; Semen oozed down my leg. The cuffs were cold on my wrists.



"No."&nbsp; I mumbled.&nbsp; I was something even lower and more debased, I confessed to myself.



I don't remember what he said next.&nbsp; He lead me in, and up to Ted's room.



"Hey Barb," Ted said.&nbsp;&nbsp; He seemed nicer than Colin.&nbsp;&nbsp; "What brings you here?"



"A cab," I said dully.



Ted laughed.



The door was open.&nbsp; Some of his friends gathered in the door to watch.



"What are you here for?" he asked.



"Keys."



"Keys?"



"Colin put handcuffs on me," I mumbled.&nbsp; "I need keys."



"Oh," he said.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is that all you want."



I lowered my head.



"Is that all you want?"&nbsp; He repeated.



Oh fuck, I wanted to weep.&nbsp; Why couldn't they just stop fucking with me.



"Is that all you want?"



"No," I mumbled quietly.



"What do you want, Barb," he asked.



It was so unfair.&nbsp; Why did I have to do all the work?&nbsp; Why did I have to say it?&nbsp; His cock was hard.&nbsp; I could tell.&nbsp; But he was forcing me.



"Fuck me," I whispered.



"What?"



"I want you to fuck me," I repeated.&nbsp; "I need to come.&nbsp; I need your cock."



"I want to fuck you up the ass, Barb.&nbsp; Is that okay."



"Yes."



"You want it up the ass?"



"Yes."



"Say it."



There was sniggering behind me from the watchers.&nbsp;&nbsp; My insides curdled with butterflies and I trembled all over.



"I want it up the ass."



"You want it hard up the ass."



"I want it hard up the ass."



Ted shrugged and pointed to the couch.



"Go over there.&nbsp;&nbsp; Drape yourself over the arm."



I did as ordered, utterly beaten.&nbsp;&nbsp; Just do it, I thought.&nbsp; Do it and then I can come.&nbsp;&nbsp; In my submission, the last thing was the orgasm.&nbsp; If I could just come....&nbsp;&nbsp; But there was more than that.&nbsp; I felt I had no will left, it had all leaked out of me.&nbsp; I bent over the arm of the couch, my face against the cushion.



Ted wandered over.



He flipped my skirt up, exposing the bared, mound globes of my ass.&nbsp; I spread my legs open a little further, baring my asshole for him.



Outside the doorway, the watchers sniggered.



"Please," I whispered.



"What?"



"Shut the door," I whimpered.&nbsp; "Please....&nbsp; I don't want to be watched."



There was a long pause as he thought about it.



"Okay, Barb," he said softly.



This tiny bit of mercy seemed to break my heart, I wanted to weep, to give myself to him completely.



"Awww," came the voices from the doorway.



"Sorry guys," Ted said.



"Can she at least suck our cocks afterwards."



Ted paused.



"How about it Barb?"



"Okay," I said.&nbsp; "Afterwards.&nbsp; But make me come.&nbsp; Fuck me hard."



He closed the door, and returned.&nbsp; But instead of taking his place behind me, he stopped in front of me, lifting my head.&nbsp; He didn't need to tell me, I willingly swallowed his cock, slobbering all over it.



Finally, he mounted me, thrusting his big hard meat deep in my ass, leaving me groaning.&nbsp; He began to pound me.&nbsp; I heard snickering outside the door.&nbsp; Were they listening.&nbsp; Watching through a keyhole.&nbsp; I no longer cared.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ted shoved his big cock hard up my bowels, making me grunt with every brutal thrust.&nbsp;&nbsp; The sexual haze overwhelmed me, a burning, intense sensation that mounted higher and higher until I was shrieking with each pounding stroke, pushing me higher and higher towards orgasm.



I came screaming, and then came again.&nbsp; Helpless, my body convulsed on the end of his savage cock as it wrecked my ass.



Finally, he groaned as he shoved deep inside me and shot a huge load.&nbsp;&nbsp; My bowels twitched with the force of his thrusts.&nbsp;&nbsp; For a few minutes, he laid heavily on me, his weight crushing me down.



Then finally, he pulled out.&nbsp; I could feel his come leaking out of my violated ass.&nbsp;&nbsp; He stroked my upturned cheek affectionately.



"You're a hot fuck, Barb," he said, affectionately.&nbsp; "I've missed fucking that ass."



He moved around in the room, but I didn't try to follow him.&nbsp; I simply laid bent over the couch and tried to catch my breath.&nbsp;&nbsp; He returned, I could feel him fumbling with my wrists.&nbsp; And then there was a metal click, the cuffs sprang open one after the other, and I was free.&nbsp; 



"Is it our turn yet," a voice called through the door.



"Ready, Barb," Ted asked gently.&nbsp;&nbsp; I nodded, rubbing my wrists, rotating my shoulders.&nbsp;&nbsp; I felt as if they were ... nice.&nbsp; That if I needed time, Ted would give it to me.&nbsp; That they were taking care of me now, even as they used me.&nbsp; He stroked my hair, like I was some sort of pet.&nbsp; I was surprised how I responded to the touch.



"I'm ready," I mumbled.



"Strip, we don't need any more come on your clothes," he said.&nbsp; "And get on your knees."



As I obeyed, he went to open the door.



Four men came in.&nbsp; Their cocks were already out.



"Showtime, Barb."



Their eyes were hungry.



Their cocks felt good in my mouth.



It felt right to be on my knees in front of them.



It was where I belonged.



I swallowed each of their loads.



Afterwards, I was allowed to dress and leave.&nbsp; I didn't have money for a cab, so I had a long walk home.



Colin was there when I arrived, sitting on my couch, watching my television.&nbsp;&nbsp; He glanced up at me.&nbsp; 



Somehow, I wasn't surprised.&nbsp; Under other circumstances, I might have been shocked, might have been outraged, might have demanded that he leave.&nbsp; But now?&nbsp; Too much had happened today.



"Hey Barb," he said.



"Hey," I replied dully.



"How's it going?" he asked.



I shrugged.



"Okay."



He nodded.



"Get me a beer, would you."



I went into the kitchen and grabbed a beer for him, uncapping it, and bringing it out to him.



"Good girl," he said.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now kneel."



I stood there, indecisive for a few seconds.&nbsp;&nbsp; An impulse to tell him off came and evaporated away, I suspected that if I told him off I'd pay for it.&nbsp;&nbsp; What did he want, I asked myself.&nbsp;&nbsp; But really, I knew.



Slowly, I undressed in front of him until I was naked, my nude body on display for him.&nbsp;&nbsp; He gave the slightest of nods.&nbsp;&nbsp; His face showed no expression, but the fingers of his left hand flexed, a gesture.&nbsp; Down.



I got down on my knees.



And then on all fours.



Carefully, I crawled between his legs, head bowed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Without meeting his eyes, I knelt before him, reaching up to unzip his pants and fish his cock out.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was already hard.



I pursed my lips as if for a kiss, touched them to the head of his cock.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My lips parted, taking the head into the warm wetness of my mouth, I rippled my tongue against the underside, as I felt the shaft slide into me.&nbsp; I began to bob my head, rhythmically up and down on his cock.



I knew Colin was watching me service him. 



"You see, Barb," he said.&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is what you need."



His cock filled my mouth, so I didn't have to say anything, didn't even have to look at him.



"This is what you are now," he told me.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, maybe before all this started, this wasn't you.&nbsp; You were something else, someone else.&nbsp; But it started, you started, it was too good, you kept being drawn closer and closer, came too close to the flame and it consumed you."



Don't listen, I told myself.&nbsp; Don't think about it.&nbsp; Just focus on the cock, that big cock in my mouth.&nbsp; Service it.&nbsp; Worship it.&nbsp; Don't be Barb.&nbsp; Just be a cunt, a wet hole.&nbsp; Don't think.&nbsp; Just be.



But I couldn't help listening.&nbsp;&nbsp; 



Couldn't help knowing it was true.



Couldn't help the truth of it slipping into me, just like his cock, slipping deep inside me, taking root.



"We didn't do it to you, Barb," Colin said.&nbsp; His voice was almost gentle.&nbsp; "All we ever did was fuck you."



"The rest?" he paused.



"The rest you did to yourself."



Unbidden, tears began to stream down my cheeks.&nbsp; But I kept my mouth on his cock.



"We're going to keep on fucking you, Barb," colin said.&nbsp; "We'll fuck you all we want, any time we want, any way we want.&nbsp; We own you.&nbsp; We're going to keep on owning you."



The salt of my tears mixed with my saliva.&nbsp; It slid and dripped across his pubic hair.&nbsp; I could smell my quiet weeping in his crotch.
