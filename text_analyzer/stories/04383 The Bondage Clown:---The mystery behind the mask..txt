&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Ben Johnson and Juliet Catherine were the hottest couples in
their college. Both belonged to rich families. Both of them had their own
talents. While Juliet was very good in studies, Ben was very good in sports and
athletics. He was also good at other activities like mimicry, dancing and car
racing. And needless to say both were extremely beautiful and handsome. Both
fell in love with each other at first sight. Now the whole college knew of
their relationship. They both were doing their final year in their college and
they both had been recently awarded the award for the �Hottest couples� in
their college. 

&nbsp;

This Tuesday, it was Ben�s birthday. As planned, they both
went to a disco club in the evening. They both had a great dance and all the
other dancers looked with awe at how skillfully and co-operatively they both
danced with each other. When they had finished, they went to a hotel. �Hey
Julie, do you remember something,� Ben told, �you haven�t given me a birthday
gift yet�. Julie smiled freakishly, �I know what you are expecting, Ben.� �Then
why�, Ben said, �have I not yet received it. It�s my birthday, and I deserve
something special.� Julie leaned a little closer to him and almost whispered,
�That something has to wait till tonight.� �Now that�s not fair Julie, but
anyway, I trust you.�

�You better do that, Ben.� After finishing their dinner,
they both went for a ride along the beachside in Ben�s new car which his mother
had bought for his birthday. �You are driving your car pretty fast Ben. I
reckon you to drive a little slower, after all it�s a new car and you would not
want to damage it.� �Oh come on Julie! Don�t you know how good a driver I am,
and now it is pretty dark, and especially in these areas it would be surprising
if we see a vehicle at all.�

&nbsp;

�No sooner had he said
these words that a truck came ramming into his car. If not for his instincts, Ben
would not have turned his car just in the right moment. The truck just went
grazing past the car. Due to the sudden turn, the car went skidding down the
roadside. The truck sped past without bothering to stop. Due to the impact, Ben
hit the windowpane and smashed his head into the glass. His head immediately
began to bleed. Juliet, who hadn�t suffered any overall damage, immediately
applied a cloth over Ben�s injury. She took the Driver�s seat and drove Ben to
the nearest hospital.

&nbsp;

�Don�t worry sir, it will heal soon�, said the doctor who
had attended Ben, �it�s only a minor injury. But since it is in the head, it
has to be taken seriously. If you don�t mind, then can I ask you to stay in the
hospital tonight? It would be much better for you.� Ben started to say �no� but
Julie interrupted, �Did you hear that Ben? You have got to take rest in the
hospital tonight.� Ben started to protest, �Today is my birthday Julie, and I
don�t want to spend the night here. After all, it�s just a minor injury.� �Ben,
it�s just for today. And it�s for the sake of your health.� �But
Julie, what about my birthday gift?� Ben asked stubbornly. �I am afraid
that it would have to wait,� said Juliet, �but for now it�s just this.� And
Juliet kissed Ben in the lips. �Can�t you stay here with me tonight?� Ben asked
pleadingly, �anyway I have to inform my mother through my cell phone. I will
inform your mother also. It�s already very late in the night. You might not
want to go alone.� 

�I am sorry Ben, but my mother is alone and I have got to
go. But I promise that I will be here in the morning to receive you. Do you
mind if I take your car?�. �No problem Julie. But I will be expecting you by my
side in the morning.� �Sure Ben. Goodnight!� .She kissed him once again and
with that she left the hospital.

&nbsp;

Juliet had little idea that this incident would bring about
the beginning of the darkest days in her life. If she had got even the slightest
hint about what was going to happen next, she would have gladly stayed back
with Ben. But things proceeded as they would and perhaps it was written in
Juliet�s fate. As Juliet was on her way home on Ben�s car, in the middle of the
road, she saw the body of a person lying face downwards. She immediately got
down from the car to help the person. The whole area was deserted and it was
very dark. As she reached the person and bent down to take a look at the face,
she was taken aback. The person�s face was fully white with dark black stripes
around the eyebrows. The person�s cheeks were red. She was afraid that it may
be blood. But suddenly she relaxed. She had realized that it was not the
person�s face but was just a mask. The mask looked like the ones which circus
clowns wear.� �This isn�t funny�, she
thought, �in the middle of the night I come across someone in the road and how
can I expect that the person is wearing a mask.� As she looked closer she could
see that there were two gaps in the mask for the eyes beneath it.

&nbsp;

�Suddenly the eyes
opened and stared at Juliet. It was so sudden that Juliet was startled and she
jumped back in fear. The person leaped from his place and took out a cloth and
pressed it hard on Juliet�s nose. Juliet fought back and punched the person on
his stomach. But the person was very strong and he held both her hands with one
hand and with his other hand he pressed the cloth harder on her nose. Juliet
tried to scream and began kicking the person. But she had smelt the scent in the
cloth and it began to take its effect. She began to feel drowsy and soon her
vision began to darken.

&nbsp;

When Juliet opened her eyes she found herself in a very dark
room. The room looked like a dungeon. She tried to move around but found that
she had been chained. Her arms and legs were spread. Her hands had been spread
over her head and had been chained by iron chains to two pillars, one on her
right side and one on her left side. Similarly her legs had been spread and
chained to the bottom of the two pillars around her. She was totally spread
which put her in a very vulnerable position and offered her little movement.
She saw that she was fully dressed. She tried to shout but found out that she couldn�t
because she had been gagged. The gag had been made from a very rough cloth
which caused some pain to her mouth. Juliet began to panic and she tried
desperately to free herself from her bondage. She shook the chains forcefully.
This caused some sounds and this resulted in the awakening of her captor. She
heard footsteps coming in her direction and she froze with fear. She couldn�t
see anything in this darkness but she realized that the noise she had created
while trying to break free from the chains had caused her captor to come for her
now. She cursed herself silently. She could now hear the sound of the footsteps
coming very close to her. The footsteps stopped abruptly and she could sense
the presence of her captor right in front of her. Suddenly a matchstick was
lighted and the light shone right on her captor�s face. Juliet shrieked with
horror but her shrieks became muffled moans due to her gag. The face of her
captor was frightening enough. That mask and the circumstances under which she
was seeing the face gave her the creeps. It was as if she was staring into the
face of death itself. Suddenly the matchstick light went off and it was dark
once again. She heard the sound of a switch being switched on and light from a
single bulb was projected on her whole body. She was momentarily blinded by
this sudden outburst of light on her face after being in the dark for quite
some time. She could now see her captor very clearly. He was dressed fully in
black. He wore a black coat, black gloves on his hands, and a black pant along
with black shoes. He was also wearing a black hat. The combination of the hat
and the mask made it impossible for her to guess out what would be the genuine
face of her captor. Only the eyes beneath the mask were genuine. Suddenly the
captor got hold of her jacket and forced it open as one by one the buttons on
the jacket popped out of their place. Juliet was wearing a t-shirt beneath her
jacket. He also tore the t-shirt open. Juliet began to squeal uneasily but a
hard slap from her captor on her face silenced her. As her t-shirt was torn and
removed, a gold necklace which was worn on her neck became visible. On the tip
of the necklace were inscribed the words �B.J�. The captor paused and stared at
those letters as if he recognized something. �Perhaps he wants the necklace�,
Juliet thought. But she turned out to be wrong. Her captor left the necklace as
it was and quickly turned his attention on her blouse. He ripped it open with
his gloved hands. Underneath the blouse she was wearing a bra but her large and
magnificent curves were already visible. Her captor bent down and pulled down
her shorts. He removed her shoes. Now Juliet was chained, clad only in her bra
and panty.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

During this time, Ben�s mother had received a call from
Juliet�s mother. �Mrs. Johnson, I am very afraid. Nothing of this sort has ever
happened before.� �Relax Mrs. Catherine�, Ben�s mother replied, �Ben just met
with a minor accident tonight. May be Juliet is staying with him tonight.� �But
surely she would have informed me by this time�, Mrs. Catherine sounded very
much worried. �Don�t worry Mrs. Catherine. I will call Ben and find out.
Everything will be fine. You just go back to sleep. If anything is wrong I will
call you back�. With that the she ended the call. Ben�s mother quickly dialed
Ben�s cell phone number. But although the ring was going on nobody picked it
up. Even Ben�s mother became a little tensed. �Should I call the police,� she
thought, then she reconsidered her thinking, �but Ben must be sleeping. After
all it�s around midnight and he is
already tired. Anyone would be dozing at this time.� Ben�s mother assured
herself that everything would be fine and she went off to sleep. That was where
she made her mistake. It would be almost 8 more hours before she would realize
it.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Meanwhile, in the dungeon,
Juliet was sweating all over her body. It was partly due to tension and partly
due to fear. Her captor now removed a small knife from his pocket. He watched
the fear in Juliet�s eyes as he did this. Then he walked around her back and
she could no more see him. Her captor took the knife and cut open the hook of
her bra which was on her backside. The bra slid open and fell to the floor.
Similarly he cut down her panty and it also fell to the floor. Her captor moved
in front of her. Now Juliet was totally devoid of any clothing except for the
gag which was placed on her mouth. She was totally nude except for the gag and
the gold necklace. She could see the gleam in the eyes of her captor as he
inspected her nude body. He took one of her breasts in his gloved hand and slowly
rubbed the pink nipple with his finger. As he did this, she moaned behind her
gag. Then he left her for some time and went out of the dungeon. He returned
after a few minutes carrying a plastic bag. He removed something from the bag
which Juliet recognized as a bunch of wires. He took the wires and slowly
wrapped them around her naked body. When he had finished wrapping her, only her
head, her breasts and her pussy were visible. All other parts of her body had
been wrapped up completely in black wires. Then he connected one end of the
wires to a small wooden box which consisted of a regulator and a button. The
regulator had the markings from 1 to 5. He carried the wooden box in his hands.
He then went behind her and connected the other end of the wires to a switchboard.
Juliet was unable to see this because her back was facing the switchboard. Then
suddenly, without any warning, he pressed the button on the wooden box. Blue sparks
of electricity burst out from all the wires and they rubbed against Juliet�s
body causing her to yell in pain. But the gag prevented the yell from escaping
her mouth. Her captor, who had been standing behind her, moved in front of her
to show her the apparatus. He showed the wooden box to her and turned the
regulator from1 to 2.Then he pressed the button. Again the blue sparks of
electricity passed around her body and again she yelled causing the chains to
dangle. He turned the regulator from 2 to 3 and pressed the button. This time
more number of sparks passed around her and she violently dangled in the chains
causing her breasts to sway right and left. Her captor delightedly turned the
regulator once more from 4 to 5.When he pressed the button, the pain
encountered by Juliet was so much that she let out such a scream, that if not
for the gag, she would have awakened the whole neighborhood. Her whole body was
sweating vigorously. Her body was no longer able to stand upright. She allowed
her whole weight to act on the chains. But this did little to please her
captor. He returned his attention to the regulator and set the pain level to
the maximum, i.e., to level 5. As he did this he looked up to meet her eyes.
Her eyes were pleading him to stop. She shook her head as if to signal a �no�
when she saw what he was about to do. But he ignored her pleadings and pressed
the button. The impact of the electric blasts was so much that her whole body
shuddered violently and shook for one last time. Then she fell unconscious. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

It was around 8.a.m in the
morning when Mrs. Johnson received a phone call from her son. �Goodmorning mom!�, Ben said. �Good morning Ben. How are
you feeling?�. �I am feeling fine mom. Will you please do me a favor?
Call Julie and say that I am waiting for her. She promised me that she would
visit me in the morning and she has not yet come.� 

That was when Mrs. Johnson
realized that something was wrong.

������������������������������������������ Chapter-2

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&quot;Name
of the missing person?'', asked the police constable, as he noted down.

&quot;Catherine
Juliet�, answered Ben.

&quot;Lastly
seen ...&quot;

&quot;Yesterday
night&quot;.

Ben, his
mother Miss Johnson, Miss Catherine (Juliet's mother) and her husband had
arrived at the police station nearly fifteen minutes ago, but had been told to
wait by the constable until the inspector arrives. Just as the constable
decided to take down the information the inspector arrived.

&quot;Good
morning Inspector Jones!� the constable greeted him.

�A very
good morning Peitler!� inspector Jones returned the greeting.

&quot;Excuse
me!� Ben interrupted, �I don't think that it is a very good morning for
us&quot;.

Jones
gazed questionably at Ben.

Ben's
mother nudged at him, but Ben was in a very bad mood.

&quot;Pardon
me sir,� said Jones,� I don't get you.&quot;

Ben
almost burst out,� For the past fifteen minutes we have been waiting and being
totally ignored and all you come and say is that you don't get anything. What
do you think........&quot;

Jones cut
him off,� Please calm down sir and clearly tell me what the problem is...&quot;

This time
Miss Catherine spoke,� My daughter is missing since last night and we came to
give the complaint.&quot;

&quot;Why
are you so certain that she is missing? She might have gone to someone's house
for staying and she might be planning to return home today.&quot;

&quot;She
never goes without informing us in advance, inspector,� replied Mr. Catherine (Juliet's
father).

&quot;And
she wouldn't go roaming about in my car,� sneered Ben. He was getting very much
irritated.

&quot;No
need to get tensed mister,� Jones said.

&quot;I
didn't come here for you to advice me, inspector&quot;.

&quot;I
understand.....&quot;

&quot;No
you don�t!� Ben slammed his fist on the table.

&quot;Wait,
listen...&quot;

Ben again
started to say something before his mother realized that the conversation was
getting worse and stopped him and said,� Let us listen to him first, Ben.�

�Ben controlled himself somewhat.

Jones
continued,&quot; I just said it is too soon to imagine things..., but nevertheless
I am taking down the information. Do you have her photo?&quot;

Miss
Catherine gave him the photo.

&quot;Fine!
I will file the complaint. I have some work now. Come back in the noon. If she
still hasn't returned, then we will proceed with the search. Till then be
patient.&quot;

�

�������������������������������������������������������������������������
*********

&nbsp;

Catherine
Juliet woke up from her sleep only to get a cold greeting.

�Good
morning, Catherine Juliet! �

Juliet
froze in horror. A cold shiver went down her spine.

The
shiver was not due to the arrival of her captor, not because he had spoken to
her for the first time, it was not even due to the mention of her name,
but��..the voice���she felt as if she had heard this voice before.

�I have
been waiting for you to get up. I didn�t want to disturb you from your pleasant
dreams.�

Juliet
couldn�t talk as she still had the gag on her mouth. 

�Perhaps
you are surprised by the mention of your name by me,� spoke her masked captor. 

Though the
sound of his voice came, Juliet could see no moment of his lips. And how could
she? After all the voice came from the original mouth beneath the mask. 

�However
there is no need for you to worry about that matter. It is quite unnecessary
for you. What you should be concerned about, right now, is yourself.� 

Her
captor gazed at her chained nude body. He bent down so that she could directly
meet his eyes. He had tied her hands behind her back and her legs to a single
pillar so that she could lie down.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

�Now
listen to me carefully. I am going to remove the gag from your mouth. But
beware, if you make even the slightest sound you will receive good lashes from
this,� he lifted his hand to show her what he was holding,� this, is an
electronic whip.�

Even as
Juliet saw the cruel object in her captor�s hand, memories of the tortures she
suffered last night flooded through her mind.

�From now
onwards, I will do all the talking. You will just say a �Yes� or �No� whenever
I ask you a question. Did you get that?�

Juliet
slowly nodded her head not knowing what else to do.

�If you
ever break this rule, you will get a deserved punishment�.

Juliet
could not see a smile in her captor�s face but she could definitely sense a
glee in his voice as he said this.

Her
captor removed the gag from her mouth. But Juliet didn�t dare to shout. Her
hands and legs were still chained.

He placed
his hand on her right breast and slowly squeezed it hard. Juliet tried hard not
to yell.

He
pinched her nipple. This time she could not resist a slight muffle.

His hand
slowly moved down her pussy. His fingers circled around her crotch.

He poked
one of his fingers inside her tiny hole.

Juliet
bit her lip to stop herself from screaming.

The
masked face turned up to look at her face. The masked face came very close to
her face, almost touching her nose. �Do you know something Juliet, you smell a
little stinky. Would you like to take a bath?�

Juliet
was surprised by this sudden question. She simply stared at the mask.

�That was
a question Juliet! I need an answer.�

She
couldn�t bring about to say anything. At last she managed to blurt a �Yes�.

At least
she could be free from his poking of her body.

�Very
well�, said the voice beneath the mask.

Her
captor stood up and walked behind the pillar. From there he picked up a small
object. He came in front of Juliet again. On seeing a little closer Juliet saw
that the object looked like a remote controller. 

Her
captor pressed a button on the remote and an opening slid open just beside her.
It was filled with water and had the appearance of an underground water tank.

�Now this
will be your underground bathtub Juliet�.

Juliet
hadn�t expected this.

Her
captor moved behind the pillar and removed the chain bound to her legs. But
before Juliet could do anything he quickly tied both her legs with the chain.
This way she was free from the pillar but she couldn�t move her hands and legs
herself.

Without
warning, her captor lifted her to a standing position and quickly pushed her
into the underground water tank.

Juliet
felt slight pain as her body suddenly splashed into the cold water. The tank
was deeper than her whole height. She felt herself being pulled out of the
water by her hair. 

�Not tall
enough, eh?� sneered her captor as he pulled her face out of the water.

�It seems
we must make some arrangements for you�.

He took
two ropes and tied them to two knots on her hair which he made and then tied
the ropes to the two pillars such that the water level just stayed below her
nose but covered her mouth. This made breathing possible but difficult.

�It seems
fine! Now I have to go. I have some work. But you can expect me to return soon.
So till then, enjoy a nice bath Juliet�.

&nbsp;

����������������������������������������������������������������������
**********

��Are you Dr.Simons?�

��Yes, I am!�

�I am
Inspector Jones.�

Ben,
Juliet�s father and Inspector Jones were now in the hospital in which Ben was
admitted last night.

�You
wanted to see me inspector.�

�Yes
Doctor. Do you remember this person? �, he pointed towards Ben.

�Oh yeah!
He was admitted in our hospital last night for a minor accident and was
discharged this morning only.�

�You were
the doctor in charge.�

�Yes, I
was.�

�Then you
must be aware of his friend who admitted him. Her name was Catherine Juliet.�

�Yes. She
admitted him and left after ensuring that he stayed in the hospital. Why, is
there any problem?�

�As a
matter of fact, she has been unavailable from yesterday night.�

�So?� 

�We
suspect that she is missing.�

�What?�

�Since
this was the last place she was seen, I considered it necessary to visit the hospital
and see you.�

�I am so
sorry! Could I be of any help?�

�Did she
say anything to you when she left the hospital?�

�No.�

�Are you
sure doctor? Did she say anything�.anything at all?�

This time
Dr.Simons hesitated a little. �Err�.,�he paused slightly and then finally
replied,� no. Nothing that I remember.�

�Dr.Simons�,
this time Juliet�s father talked,�do you realize that any information you give
might be of utmost importance in finding my daughter.�

�I am
sorry sir! I don�t know anything else.�

�Well
then doctor!� inspector Jones said� We don�t have anything else to say. Thank
you for your co-operation.�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

When they
were out of the hospital Jones asked Juliet�s father,� According to what the
doctor said, Juliet must have directly headed to her house after leaving the
hospital. From here, which way do you use to go to your house?�

�There
are three routes for reaching my home from this place�.�

�Which
way is the shortest?�

�Two
roads are main roads and both of them take around the same time. The third road
may lead more quickly as it is mostly deserted and hence there is no traffic.
But we have never used that road because it is in a very bad condition.�

�But she
might have used the third route.� Jones turned to Ben,� What do you think Ben?�

�I don�t
think she might use a route which she has never used before.� said Ben.

�On the
other hand,� said Jones,� late at night, she might have wanted to reach her
house as fast as possible. So she might have preferred to use the third route.
It�s just an assumption. We will see soon.�

All three
of them headed for the third route in Jones� police jeep.

The
inspector turned out to be right. No further had they gone half the route, they
spotted Ben�s car which Juliet had driven the previous day.

Jones got
out and examined the car.

�The car
seems to be in a good condition�, said Juliet�s father.

�Well,
not totally,� said Jones,� there are some marks in the front side of the car.�

�They
seem like scratches�, said Juliet�s father.� But why would Juliet make those
scratches in a new car.�

�She
didn�t make them deliberately. They were made���.�

�Made?�
asked Juliet�s father with a puzzled look on his face. �How�.?�

�During a
fight or a struggle�.� Jones turned towards Ben.� For the first time I agree
with you Ben.�

�Why do
you say that?�

�I think
Juliet was kidnapped. She probably made these marks with her shoes while she
was having a fight with her kidnapper. Now we get the reason for her missing.�

Juliet�s
father looked shocked and frightened.

Ben was
getting tensed again,�Damn it! I know that she is missing. I have been telling
you that since morning. What the hell�, all I want to know is that �.where is
she now.�

�We will
find that out.�

The
inspector moved a little further to search. �Here I see the tyre marks of
another car, which probably would be our kidnapper�s car. Let us see where
these marks lead to. These marks lead to that direction. Let�s follow it in my
jeep.�

But no
sooner had they covered a few meters that the marks suddenly disappeared.

�Uh-oh!�
Jones sounded disappointed.� Our criminal seems to be very clever. From this
point onwards he has driven his car on a rocky path which leaves no marks. That
way he gets us off his track. He might have gone in any direction from this
path. The combinations are too vast to make any assumptions.�

And so,
their search ended as abruptly as it started. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

����������������������������������������������������������������������������
*************

&nbsp;

Juliet
was having a hell of time in her captor�s dungeon. She felt as if this was the
longest day in her life. She had been in the water for several hours now.

Her body
had become cold and rigid and yet there was little she could do.

She was
finding it very hard to breathe as her nose was just above the water. She
almost suffocated many times while trying hard to breathe properly.

She had
been suspended into the water tank through knots in her hair. Had it not been
to the upward force she was experiencing due to the buoyancy of the water, she
would have found it very painful to have been hanged by her hair.

In the
dungeon, she found it impossible even to guess what time or part of the day it
was.

She
couldn�t even shout because a considerable part of her face was inside the
water, which included her mouth. 

But the
most occupied thought in Juliet�s mind was the voice. That voice���..it had
sounded familiar, but she couldn�t recall where she had heard it before. It had
sounded very funny�if that was the right word to describe it��..sort of pitch
modulated voice.

No sooner
had she thought about this that she heard the footsteps again. She prayed that
it would be someone else for rescue, but, to her dismay it turned out to be her
captor as usual.

�I am back,
Juliet!� he said cheerfully.� Now let�s get you out of your bath-tub. I hope
you had a very enjoyable bath.�

He untied
the knots from her hair and started lifting her. As soon as he lifted her out
of the water, she spit in his face with some water she had already gathered in
her mouth for this purpose.

It turned
out to be a very bad mistake as she later regretted it.

�That was
a wrong thing to do Juliet. After all, you spit in my mask. No harm to my face.
What a way to waste a spit�.�

Juliet
yelled very loudly� You Fucker! Let me out! Let me go you sick bastard����, her
captor quickly slapped a gag over her mouth.

Juliet
desperately wrestled with her chains, but in vain.

He
slapped her hard three times on her face until she stopped struggling. He
caught her by the neck and pressed until she calmed down. He then tied her
again spread-eagled to the two pillars.

And to
Juliet�s� horror he took out the whip and fixed its wire cable to the plug
point.

�When I
mentioned you not to say anything, it also meant not to open your mouth. You
have broken that rule and it is time to see that you get the punishment you
deserve�.

Juliet
just watched him swing his hand and the next instant she felt pain tear through
her body as the whip landed on her stomach. She also felt a momentary shock rip
through her body as the powerful lash touched her skin.

�How did
you feel that?� He didn�t wait for an answer.

He moved
behind her and cracked a powerful lash on her ass.

Juliet
muffled in pain as her whole body shook terribly.

He
whipped her ass seven more times and came in front of her to view her.

Juliet
was terribly exhausted and her eyes had become very watery due to the pain.

The look
in her face let out a sorry expression as if she begged her torturer to stop.

�Now!
What does Juliet want to say?� he mocked her.

Juliet
let out a slow moan beneath her gag.

�Does
that mean you are sorry?�

Juliet
nodded her head desperately.

�Very
good! So let me finish our deal� and this time he brought down the whip on her
left breast. Juliet almost jumped with pain.

With
that, her captor went and plugged of the whip from its plug point.

�I am
going to remove your gag once again. But before that, I want to ask whether I
can have your full co-operation this time?�

Juliet
nodded her head quickly.

�Good!
Don�t ever do the mistake of behaving like that to me again. Do you
understand?� 

Juliet
nodded her head again.

He
removed her gag and then he suddenly asked,� Are you hungry Juliet?�

Juliet
was taken aback by this question and she realized that she had forgotten
something all along. She tried to remember the last time she had a meal.

�That was
a question Juliet.�

�Yes!�
she added quickly.

�Fine! I
have the meals prepared. However that won�t mean that you are having your hands
and legs free.�

He went
somewhere nearby and came back after a few minutes holding a bowl of food in
his hand.� I wanted to feed you myself, but since you behaved naughtily, I
suppose there is a change of plans.�

He set
the bowl on the floor. �Bend down Juliet�.

Juliet
looked at him, confused.

�I said
to bend down on your knees�.

Juliet
hesitated slightly but then quickly thought otherwise and did as she was told
.He tied her hands behind her back and also tied her legs together.

�Now I
want you to eat it. I am going to go and have my meals. And listen�.before I
come back I want that bowl to be licked completely clean. Otherwise it will be
the last meal you will be having for the next two days.�
