Super-Woman's Escape Challenge


THE TRAP

At the police station
"I am sorry Super-Woman, we can't still send Belinda into prison, we don't have enough proofs yet"
"But captain I know for sure she robbed the bank, I just couldn't catch her. I almost got her in the middle of the robbery. Damn!! This is so frustrating!"
Then another policeman came into the office with a smile on his face holding a poster and showing it to them:
"I guess being a super-heroine is not enough well-paid and so you need to get some extra cash working as an escape artist..."
The poster advertised the latest Belinda show. A famous magician performing that night an adults show in town featuring... Super-Woman and the Mega Water Torture Cell of Death.
"This is nuts! What the hell is she thinking? I have no idea what is going on but she is crazy if she thinks I am performing with her!!
"Calm down, lady, she may be trying to get into your head, this may be a trap, you should play it cool. Relax. We will keep working on finding who rob the bank, nothing else"
But Super-Woman is not taking it easy "Are you kidding me? This bitch knows I saw her at the bank and I cannot put her in jail and she's just laughing at me. I won't tolerate this"
"Calm down Super-Woman, you are just playing her game. Don't do anything stupid"
"Calm down? I just cannot believe it! There is a criminal in town toying with us and we, instead of getting her and putting her in prison we are discussing some dumb procedure. I guess I will have to do this alone"
"Please Super-Woman don't do anything stup.."
And she left.

At the show
Belinda was a extremely talented and strikingly beautiful woman, black hair, in her mid-thirties and dressed with a "Zatanna-style" costume, she looked so confident and happy that day. This woman had led the magic world for the previous two years with no competitors; she was the best. And she was proving it.
People were enjoying so much Belinda's show. They have already seen an incredible version of the metamorphosis and a wonderful zig-zag. They cheered and applaud so much every trick and every joke. However, they were waiting for the most expected part of the show: when Super-Woman was going to face death in an incredible feat.
After a dance interlude Belinda came on stage again to announce that she was going to perform some sort of "sawing in half" and she was going to need a volunteer.
"Let's see who wants to help us with..."
"Enough of this Belinda!!"
Interrupting Belinda, Super-Woman came into the theater looking defiantly to Belinda, who seemed to enjoy this very much with a suppressed smile.
"Stop this show and surrender, I am taking you to prison"
"Hey Super-Woman, you promised to perform, and this people came to see you defeat, not me, but the Mega Water Torture Cell of Death. They have seen the typical water torture, many times, this time is going to be huge. Only you can deliver this kind of show!!"
"I am not performing anything and you are going to jail"
"Ok, why don't you come here so we can talk? Maybe I can convince you"
Super-Woman came down the stairs to the stage while staring at her. Her red heels ticked loudly as she walked down the steps, her hips swung sexily as she walked in her panther-like gait. The people was loving this! They were going to do it as if Belinda was some kind of criminal! It was indeed a good show!
Once they were less than a feet apart, Belinda whispered very cocky to Super-Woman:"Hey, superbitch, why don't you turn around and use your supersight to look under the seats in the audience? Can you see the bombs? Oh, and can you see my three assistants? Each of them have a detonator, you cannot stop them all at the same time so, why don't you be a nice girl and play by my rules this time?"
Super-Woman quickly blinked as she realised the threat. Apart from that, her face remained of marble. She knew that she was trapped. Destroying the bombs or detonators was impossible. Warning the crowd would create a panic that would be as deadly as the bombs themselves, even if they did not detonate them. She had no choice but to enter Belinda's game.
�Come on, Superslut, I am just going to try to kill you� Whispered Belinda.
"Ok, Belinda, I accept" she said proudly, swallowing her rage.
"She accepts the challenge!! Super-Woman is going to face the Mega Water Torture Cell of Death!!!"
The crowd went wild. That was so exciting!!!
Soon some assistants removed the devices for the "sawing in half" trick from the stage and brought out some props and the Mega Water Torture Cell of Death, a glass booth half filled with water with an incredibly menacing appearance. The audience could see the water sloshing around inside. With it in position, they pulled out a hose and began filling it with more water. The tank was made of bullet-proof glass and the joints were reinforced with steel. Everything looked very solid. The only way in and out of it was the top part which had a cover with four locks and some rings to pass chains through them that make it almost impossible to remove it with no help from the outside. With the water level about a foot below the top of the tank, they turned off the hose and left.
"Ok Super-Woman, the Cell is ready, now is your turn, remove your costume, we have to make sure that you are not hiding any key"
"What are you saying?, I am not removing my clothes!!"
Then Belinda whispered her "remember you can't stop&nbsp; three detonators at the same time..." Super-Woman glared at her, anger boiling inside herself. There was nothing she could do though and reluctantly she accepted. Slowly she peeled her blue and red costume off her perfectly-shaped body untils she wore only a thong and bra. Nobody had never seen her like that and the crowd was gaping in awe at her muscular yet feminine silhouette.
"I will keep your clothes as souvenir of this incredible time. I am having so much fun! I am going to kill you and everybody will think it was an accident... You die and I get famous for the greatest performance ever... Let's get to work!!"
"Don't get too excited. As soon as I get out of this cell you are going to get into yours, and you will stay in for much longer than me!" Super-Woman whispered in response. Belinda smiled defiantly back to her.
Super-Woman stood alone at the center of the stage with her white bra and panties for a while so that the crowd could take a good look at her. That was the body of a centerfold; blonde, D-cup breasts, firm ass and magnificent body.
While Belinda began her speech describing the escape, her assistants, bringing some props, circled and faced Super-Woman. She stared at them confidently, almost cocky, looking into their eyes. They were three statuesque women dressed with boots, shorts, tops and caps with a military pattern acting as if they were real soldiers following Belinda's orders restraining the captive superheroine.
"Ok, first of all, this is not real, everything that you are going to see now is part of a play and it is being rehearsed many, many times so please don't try this at home and don't interrupt the show no matter what happens, we know when something goes wrong and when we need to intervene"
An assistant tried to undermine Super-Woman's confidence whispering "don't worry, we are not going to intervene, and you are going to die" and kissed her on the cheek.
Belinda continued with her speech:
"Let's do this, girls!!!" (Fighter from Christina Aguilera started to play in the background)
"Firstly, we are going to blindfold Super-Woman with a special fabric that will impede, even her, to see what's going on and, over all, to use her laser-shooting eyes. We want her to use her skills as an escape artist, not as a superheroine, so (looking at Super-Woman in a mocking tone, as a teacher to a pupil before a test) No superpowers today lady!! In addition, although Super-Woman has practiced a lot for this event, she knows nothing about the specific dangers that she is facing today and how we are going to bind her; we want to keep her surprised"
A black strip of eye-fitting reinforced leather was wrapped around her head, blinding her totally. The assistant buckled it behind her head, under her impressive blonde mane. Accustomed to her super-sight, Super-Woman was quite disoriented by her sudden blindness and she turned her head left and right as if to see what was around her. She tried her eye laser to cut a minute hole in the leather but she already knew it would be useless. Each laser was harmless in isolation. Only by converging them on a tiny spot could she use them to cut steel, and it was impossible to focus both of them on the blindfold. This felt so strange that such a powerful thing could be rendered useless with such a simple trick.
To confirm that she could not see anything, Belinda went in front of Super-Woman and started picking on her as if she was going to lick her tits or her pussy, which made the crowd cheer and laugh aloud. Super-Woman did not react, the blindfold was working very well.
"Next, a gag will have to be applied so that she's not able to interfere with the process or back down later in the show. (facing her with a very serious tone) Super-Woman, after this point there is no turning back. If you have doubts about this now it's the time to say it. Do you want to continue?"
An assistant next to her whispered in a mocking tone "remember our detonators..."
"Yes, go on" Super-Woman said frustrated but confident that no restraint would keep her for more than a few minutes.
"Good girl... What happened? Aren't you so cocky now??" Reply whispering the same assistant while caressing the superheroine blonde long hair with obvious fake affection.
And a ball gag made of a special superstrong rubber was buckled tightly in Super-Woman mouth sealing Super-Woman's compromise to face the Mega Water Torture Cell of Death. The ball was forced against her front teeth, forcing the blonde heroine to spread her jaws wider and wider until the ball finally popped in. The rubber was so strong that it felt like steel. As the strap was tightened behind her neck, the ball was pushed even deeper, forcing her jaws painfully wide apart and stretching her red lips into thin lines, revealing the full whiteness of her perfect teeth. The crowd responded with a huge ovation. People could not believe it, they were going to see the greatest heroine of all time performing an escape challenge!! Super-Woman felt that it seemed that the audience wanted her to fail... And die. As she tried to get used to the huge gag, she realised that the extreme spread of her jaws deprived her of so much leverage that her super-strong masseters could not engage their full power. Usually, she was able to bite chunks out of concrete plates but she now felt powerless. The humiliation got worst when she realised that she could not even swallow her saliva and that she was on the verge of drooling down her chin.
"Then we are going to handcuff her hands behind her back with these special handcuffs made by Safe Hard, the leading strongboxes maker in the country, specially for this challenge"
"Convince these experts in handcuffs was a great idea, the handcuffs were unbelievably strong. In the rehearsals, I had such a tough time to escape from them, luckily I was not inside a water-filled booth" thought Belinda with once again a naughty smile on her face.
The three assistants made sure the handcuffs were thoroughly closed. Even though her bullet-proof skin could not be dented by the hard steel of the cuffs Super-Woman felt the pressure around her wrists. She clenched her fists tights, causing the muscles and tendons to swell around her wrists. She was immensely stronger than any Human and thus the assistant, even though she tightened the cuff as much as she could, could not break her prisoner's strength. Once the assistant was done, the blonde heroine relaxed her hands a little and immediately felt a bit of slack. Anyway, those cuffs could be strong, they were still made of steel and breaking them apart should not prove so difficult, Super-Woman thought.
"Those handcuffs are going to be attached to this other chain (showing it to the audience) that is going to be wrapped around her trim waist. Her ankles are going to be also shackled."
Super-Woman felt the chain being threaded through the link connecting her handcuffs and then the assistants wrapped it twice around her waist. She contracted her steel abs, causing them to bulged under her glistening skin. Two assistants, each pulling on one end of the chain, tried to strangle her waspy midriff, but however hard they pulled they could not beat Super-Woman's iron muscles. The chain links dug into her flawless skin but could not force her to cave in. Sweat poured from them as they struggled with all their strength and weight, to no avail. Finally they locked the chain with a padlock without having won one inch. It seemed that the corners of Super-Woman's mouth, however stretched they were, twitched as she heard the two girls grunting and panting.
Panting from exertion they then locked a pair of heavy leg irons on their prisoner's strong ankles. The shackles were heavy and thick, connected by only one link of heavy-duty chain. They were probably weighing one kilogram each. To Super-Woman, such a weight was hardly noticeable though. Once again, the assistants were unable to tighten them more than what the heroine was willing to allow them.
Then Belinda shouted: "Have you finished, girls?"
The assistants, while caressing Super-Woman in a very sexy way responded with enthusiasm "Yes!!"
"Ok, let's get her into the cell"
The music was turned up and they all left Super-Woman alone in the center of the stage before the threatening Mega Water Torture Cell of Death while a hoist came down from the roof, ready to put Super-Woman inside it.
Super-Woman was so surprised: she could easily get out of that, the handcuffs on her wrists were really tough but she thought she could break them if she put all her strength at work. The rest of the escape would be a piece of cake once her hands were free. From the exterior she presented as proud an image as ever. Even blinded, gagged and chained she exuded an aura of power. Her body was taut, strong, unbreakable. She stood firmly and proudly and looked ready to break free at any second. Internally though, Super-Woman was not so proud. She hated to be nearly naked in front of a public. She hated the threads of saliva that were drooling from her lower lip and chin onto her cleavage. She was burning from the temptation to break her chains now and put an end to this comedy. She knew though that she had to play by Belinda's rules and wait to be in the cell before starting her escape. The bitch would pay for this later.
Then Belinda rushed into the stage again with a naughty smile and said: "Stop it!! Stop everything!! (and the music was turned off) We thought we were hosting a standard escape artist, but we have just realized that we are having today with us a great super-heroine, so we need to raise the bar!! Let's get her the challenge he deserves!!"
(Clubbed to death by Rob Dougan started to play very loud and Super-Woman started to feel uneasy)
The assistants came back on stage with many chains and props making a lot of noise and faced again Super-Woman. Belinda continued with her speech after another incredible and wild cheering from the audience:
"Now (shouting it synchronously with her assistants binding Super-Woman) two, three, four (with the crowd shouting also at the same time from now on), five and six handcuffs more are going to tie her wrists very tight behind her back" The assistants did their job, once again so thoroughly and with so much effort that Super-Woman could feel the handcuffs biting in her skin. Each pair of handcuff was placed above the previous one on her forearms, bringing them together almost up to her elbows. This forced her shoulders backward and her impressive bosom forward.
Now her uneasiness grew: that was going to be much harder than expected. Fucking Safe Hard made a great work. Keeping a super-heroine bound unable to escape has to be great publicity for a company like this, I bet they were extremely motivated developing these restraints, Super-Woman thought. The position of her elbows was also depriving her from much leverage when the time to break her restraints would come.
"Then a strap device is going to be secured around her arms. We don't want to let the handcuffs so easily reachable for Super-Woman. This is supposed to be a challenge" She smiled ironically almost laughing, responded with more laughs from the audience. The arm-binder was pulled up over her arms, encasing them from hands to shoulder into a sheath of thick leather. Her hands were enclosed together in a narrow pouch at one end. It was then zipped up all the way and the zip handle was broken so it could never be unzipped again. To make it tighter the air was removed from it and a lace was tied above the zip, criss-crossing it. This completed to pull her arms together, accentuating the strain on her shoulders and preventing Super-Woman to use her fingers.
In each of the parts of the binding of Super-Woman the assistants were encouraged by the audience to add more restraints to the super-heroine, cheering and shouting, which made her feel sent to a certain death. Belinda, on the contrary, felt delighted
"Finally, her legs are going to be tied with this seventy-five-foot length of steel chain". Most of its length had simply been wrapped around her legs, from her ankles to her thighs but the assistants had been careful to wind some loops diagonally and to lock some padlocks in between. When they ran out of chain a final huge padlock (also made by Safe Hard) secured the end somewhere amongst the confining steel. The blind blonde could not see it but she could feel the cold steel coiled around her legs and she contracted their muscles as hard as she could to make the wider and prevent the chain from strangling them too much. However, whilst she could harden her muscles to the strength of steel, she could do nothing to firm her skin and the chain necessarily had to sink into it a little, although it could not pierce or wound it.
A final check of her bonds was carried out by the assistants to make sure everything was as tight as possible. It was. The assistants were making an immense effort and treating Super-Woman very roughly to achieve it. They tug with all their combined strength before locking each and every of the 6 locks that kept Super-Woman's legs together and motionless. At least so did they think, unaware of how hard Super-Woman could clench her steel muscles.
They walked out of the stage again and turned off some of the lights leaving Super-Woman under the only spotlight, helpless in the center of the stage while the hoist came down. She was obviously sweating now, her perfect skin glistening with perspiration. Whether the sweat came from the heat of the spotlights, from her efforts to fight the restraints or from fear, was difficult to assess as her face remained motionless. Not that it would have been easy to read her emotion under her blindfold and evil gag.
The music finished, the lights were turned up again and then they came back. Belinda faced the crowd with a sexy smile and said "Who needs panties and bra to escape?"
She took a pair of scissors, removed Super-Woman's bra and panties and threw them to the audience, leaving her completely exposed. She struggled and wiggled and tried to say something through her ball gag but to no effect at all. She was now totally naked and offered to the crowd. Even deprived from the support of the bra her breasts remained as firm as twin shells of steel, their impressive nipple as hard as bolts. Everybody could see her neatly land-strip trimmed pussy hair, although her sex itself was less visible between her tightly bound legs. She was blind, but she was not deaf and she could hear the public's screams and whistles as they were offered that mighty sight, a naked super-heroine. Her impressive breasts seemed to attract most of their admiration or jealousy.
For a moment Super-Woman feared that her breasts would be molested or subjected to some bondage device. Indeed, whilst the skin covering her super-boobs was as bullet-proof than everywhere else, there was no muscle inside to resist strangling or squeezing, and the glands inside were as sensitive as any woman's. All this converged to make them the weakest part of her body, even if they looked and indeed were very firm.
"Save your strength for the Mega Water Torture Cell of Death, it is not going to be easy" Belinda whispered to the powerless super-heroine responding to her struggle. Then, speaking in her microphone, she announced, "Ok, Super-Woman finally it's the time for you to face your fate with the Mega Water Torture Cell of Death!!"
They helped Super-Woman lay down and then they hooked the hoist to the chain around her ankles and used it to lift her in the air head down. Then they left her swing in the air for a little while, until the cell was filled completely with water. They let her hang from the hoist so that the crowd could enjoy watching her nude body slowly pivoting around in the air, maybe for the last time.
Blinded, upside-down, she was totally disoriented now. Her impressively long blonde hair was brushing the floor, her painfully wide gagged mouth was now drooling all over her face, increasing her humiliation. Her muscles twitched as her restraints were putting a lot of strain on her shoulders and now her ankles. But the worst part for her was still to come�
Belinda grabbed the microphone again and continued with her speech: �as we said before, we want to give Super-Woman a real challenge today; we want her to face real danger, being threatened by real death, there has to be a real risk for her to die. That&#8217;s were excitement is and how escape artist write their greatests achievements and feats in history. As you may know, this superheroine that we have here, may seem helpless now, but we are currently 100% sure that she is going to survive this peril. It seems spectacular but there is not real hazard for her because she is able to last more than two hours underwater... unless�
(The Beautiful People by Marilyn Manson was played loud)
The three assistants appeared once again on stage all with very nasty faces and they circled again the upside-down nude heroine with many torture devices. They slap her ass scoffing her and then pulled her very strongly and let her rotate very fastly while Belinda continued with her speech.
�...Unless we can get her to hyperventilate before going underwater!! (wild shouts and cheering!!) In that case, we think that she may have around 30 minutes... Fair enough, don&#8217;t you think? (the audience showed its full agreement even asking for less time, more drama) Making one superheroine&#8217;s heart go wild is such a difficult task that we are going to need all the hard work and determination of my three gorgeous assistants, even me, but specially of you, the audience that will have to show us all your support and cheering!!� (unbelievable support!!)
Then came the biggest ovation of the night accompanied by shouts of people encouraging Belinda to do the nastiest things that one could ever imagine. Super-Woman could not believe how evil Belinda was and all the things that the audience wanted her to suffer... Now she was very frightened and feeling weird, she was doing this to save all those people that now wanted her dead. She was turning her head from side to side, trying to see what was going to happen. Her taut body kept spinning in the air. That was not making her dizzy but it added to the sensation of helplessness.
� (with a big smile) Thank you for your recommendations but we think we know what we have to do (the audience laughs):
�First of all, Jennifer is going to weaken her through sexual torture, she is going to use the dildo that you can see in her hands. It was specially designed for this performance by Super-Woman so that it can deliver one hundred times more vibrations than the best ones in the market, providing not pleasure but enormous pain. It works underwater and can be strapped so that it will still undermine our captive superheroine while she fights for her life in the cell�
The dildo Jennifer had in her hand was a true monster, as big as her forearm from wrist to elbow. Deep ribs adorned it, their ridges supporting blunt steel points. Next to its butt was an even narrower neck that flared out into a flat panel that supported straps. Every girl in the assistance shivered at the thought of having this huge thing forced up their vagina. The sight was lost to Super-Woman but she could sense the shrill that shook the audience when Belinda mentioned the dildo.
�Then Christina is going to strangle her tits with this barbed wire. This will achieve two objectives, first of all, it will torture her helping us making her go bust, secondly, she won&#8217;t be able to take big breaths and she will be sooner depleted of oxygen�
�Finally Maria is going to use these big pliers to �play� (big smile from Belinda) with her tits so that she feels great pain and gets to the hyperventilation that we are looking for. We need to get these big tools because, otherwise she would feel nothing. Let&#8217;s get to work ladies!!�
�What about me? Like many of you, I have always wanted to see a superheroine suffering terrible pain, so I will be biting and scratching her to increase the discomfort while my assistants do their job. We need to mentally destroy a superheroine, this is daring stuff!! let&#8217;s hear our lovely audience&#8217;s big support!!�
Super-Woman was living a nightmare. The audience wanted her not only to fail but to suffer incredible pain. That nightmare was nothing compared to what came some seconds later. Jennifer pressed the tip of the dildo against the entrance of her sex. Super-Woman tried to shake herself away from that unwanted touch but the two other assistants quickly took hold of her and prevented her from moving too much (once again, mocking her with the tone of voice that a teacher has to her pupils they said things like �be a a nice girl, you are going to like it...�). Hanging by her feet, the superheroine had no leverage to make use of her superhuman strength. Jennifer pushed the dildo deeper, stretching her victim's vulva. At one point it seemed the dildo was too wide to go further and she had to hammer her fist on it to shove it deeper, rib after rib.
All the time Super-Woman was yelping in pain under her gag as her vagina was stretched and clawed pitilessly. She was defenceless against that intrusion and pain felt even worse that she was not used to feel any. She vainly tried to contort her hanging body but there really was nothing she could do.
Finally the last rib got in and Super-Woman's sex swallowed the neck. Its narrowness ensured that the dildo would not come out easily but to make sure, Jennifer quickly buckled the straps around her victim's hips after threading them between her muscular buttocks. Only then did she switched on the monster.
The dildo's vibrations were very powerful and got her a very profound and sexual feeling but not of pleasure but of unbelievable pain. She immediately move her head with spasms and screamed but the ball gag was very effective indeed and only more saliva came out of her mouth. She could not think how she would be able to bear this feeling underwater, maybe 30 minutes was a very optimistic estimation for an arched in pain superheroine. 
Then it was Christina&#8217;s turn to add more pain over the �dildo effect�. She put some gloves on because the barbed wire was so sharp that it was even difficult to untether it. Once again it was specially designed by Safe Hard and so difficult to break that Belinda had to use the saw of the �sawing in half trick� to cut it in half, one half for each tit. Belinda childishly said that she wanted to help and immediately put some gloves on so that both girls could tighten the knots around Super-Woman&#8217;s big firm breasts and indeed they did (Jennifer also had to help to keep her still but, again, as she was hanging from the hoist that was an easy task). They pulled with all their strength to each side. With no muscle to resist the pull, constricting her breasts was very easy. As their base was strangled to half its original girth the flesh and glands were forced forward, causing the breasts to bulge and swell and get incredibly taut.&nbsp; �Where are your big muscles now?? No clenching?? Poor baby!!� The audience laughed aloud and shouted more of that stuff, making fun of the destroyed superheroine.
Once the breasts was properly strangled, they coiled the free ends of the wire around their bases, turn after turn, until they had used all of the wire. By that time the proud shell-shaped boobs looked like purple spheres mounted on narrower bristling stems. To Super-Woman the torture was incredibly painful. Unable to see what was happening, she had the impression that her breasts were severed from her torso, or about to explode from internal pressure. Indeed, because of her "armored" skin, the barbs could not pierce it nor cause arm. All the pain came from the crushing of her glands and the unbearable internal pressure.
When they had finished tightening the barbed wire as much as they could, they smiled to the audience proud of their job. Behind them Super-Woman's formidable body was twitching and contorting at the end of the hoist, looking like caught fish at the end of a hook. Her face was grimacing in agony. Sweat was pouring down her skin abundantly and her muscles rippled underneath, vainly trying to break her chains apart. Her toes were helplessly wiggling around, clawing at thin air. She was unable to breathe through her mouth and her nostrils were flaring widely as she tried to suck air into her lungs at an increased rhythm.
Last but not least, Maria grabbed with no small effort two big pliers (they had also been designed especially to deal with Super-Woman but Belinda was so excited that she had forgotten to say it this time. �fuck sponsors, I am going to kill Super-Woman!!�) and applied them to each nipple. Our powerless superheroine thought that she could not stand more pain but she was wrong twitching her nipples added even more suffering to this excruciating situation. While Maria was doing her stuff Belinda was caressing Super-Woman&#8217;s body and punching her anywhere she wanted, whispering in her ear that she was loving this moment so much, scratching her abs and finally delivering such a great bite that left a mark for a little time in her butt that showed very proudly to the audience (that responded enthusiastically).
The extra pain throbbing in her madly tortured nipples caused so much agony that Super-Woman thought she was going to turn crazy. Never had she felt such pain. Actually, she had never felt pain of any kind and the realisation that her body was not immune to it was a shock. Drowned in the new, extreme sensation, her brains lost all control. Her taut belly was heaving fast as she hyperventilated. Her nostrils did not let much air enter her lungs and the combination of agony and struggling burned her reserves of oxygen much faster than usual. She was too much lost in her private hell to realise it though, even though Belinda had explained her plan earlier. At this moment they decided that Super-Woman was not super anymore and so while she was twitching and shaking out of control, Belinda continued with her speech:
"The last thing Super-Woman will have to face to gain her freedom is this bullet-proof glass booth made by Safe Hard. Its strength has been tested under the toughest conditions. You will remember the previous model because it sent Jane the Queen of Escapes to her death when buried alive in it. So take care Super-Woman, because this model is, according to engineers at Safe Hard, ten times stronger!!"
Then she approached the shaking shackled gorgeous body and, with a gesture of seriousness and piety, finished her speech: "Good luck Super-Woman, you are going to need it. You have been very brave to accept this challenge. All&nbsp; the women in the audience (talking to them) can clearly understand what she is being up to; imagine, after being beaten up, that you have your best orgasm, then multiply it by 5, so much that it provides you not pleasure but an enormous, profound and continuous pain then imagine yourself locked in a tight cell, bound with lots and lots of handcuffs and chains with no possibility to see anything or even speak to beg for help. That's the definition of nightmare and that's what we are doing to our lovely superheroine. (looking to her again) We warned you that we were going to put your body to the test and that you would have to face some hazardous stunts even for a superheroine. I admire your confidence but I just hope your cockiness has not led you into biting off more than you can chew."
The Audience totally believed that Super-Woman was voluntarily facing this horrendous stunt and that everything was fake and no real harm was implied in this act. Like in every other magicians&#8217; act. They also admired how real everything looked, they just wondered how much Belinda had paid her to get her naked and tortured... 
 (Lux Aeterna by Clint Mansell started to sound)
Then Belinda recovered her pitiless face and after some seconds of tense silence (the only time that seemed that the crowd was worried about Super-Woman) making the �thumb down� signal, Super-Woman was quickly lowered into the water-filled cell, causing some of it too spill over the top as her body took its place. They then unhooked her from the hoist and she sank to the bottom, weighed down by all the metal attached to her body. Then they closed the booth with four locks at the top and many chains that after being wrapped around the cell many times were passed through the many rings above the cell (practically sealing it) were locked in a big padlock very tightly by Belinda herself with an expression of huge joy. Then she shouted "Go Super-Woman!! Fight for your life against the Mega Water Torture Cell of Death!!"
You could see our heroine fighting her bonds very strongly since that moment�

Escape from the Mega Water Torture Cell of Death
The water was icy cold against Super-Woman's naked flesh and her skin covered itself with goose-bumps, while her nipples grew even harder. As soon as she was unhooked from the hoist, she plummeted to the bottom of the tank and landed there with a clang. She fell on her belly, crushing her strangled boobs under herself and forcing her to roll onto her side. The water transmitted her the infernal noise caused by the rattling of the chains that were wrapped around the cell, conveying to her ears what her eyes could not see.
Normally she would not have been afraid of lacking oxygen. Her super-powers allowed her to fly through the vacuum of space for hours without needing air and flying underwater was no problem either. She could go for a couple of hours before she felt any need to fill her lungs, and several more before it became painfully urgent. But this time it was different, she could feel it. The infernal tortures had burned her oxygen much faster than normally, and still was. How long she could hold airless before dying was something she had no idea about but seemed awfully short after her beating up and that monstrous dildo inserted into her pussy. Moreover, floating blind in the middle of water was quite disconcerting. She also hated to be seen in so humiliating a state of helplessness.
Her first attempt was to curl her legs under her as much as she could with all those layers of chains surrounding her knees. The fact that the assistants had been unable to overwhelm the tonus of her muscles helped now, as she had a little bit of slack to work with. Contorting herself and bracing one shoulder, and then even flattening her breasts against the glass wall, she managed to squat on her feet. She then used all the strength in her powerful legs to rocket herself against the ceiling.
There was a loud bang as her armored-steel-hard skull hit the lid, causing a shallow bump to appear. The countless coils of chain held well though and Super-Woman was seen sinking back to the bottom of the tank, her skull ringing from the impact. That lid indeed was strong. She might eventually break it but in what state her brains would be at the end of the process she preferred not to know. A change of tactics was clearly needed.
She waited for the ringing to calm down before making her next attempt. If the steel lid was too strong, maybe the weak point was the glass walls? She curled herself on the bottom, on her side and then kicked her heels into the wall, as hard as she could. Again, there was a loud bang which echoes through the water, she felt a hard impact in her soles, but she did not felt like she had even dented the glass panel. Obviously, breaking out of the cell would have to wait until she had gotten rid of her other restraints.
For a moment panic overwhelmed her. She squirmed and jerked on the cell floor, incoherently, trying with all her might to break her restraints with the brute strength of her muscles. She rolled from one wall to the opposite one, banging her head and feet in the process, entangling herself into her impressive freely-floating mane. All the time the agony coursing from her throbbing breasts and vibrating torture dildo kept her mind paralysed with pain. The yet unknown anguish of asphyxia added to the deadly mix.
Super-Woman was not used to have things resist her immense strength and it took her several minutes to admit her defeat. At last the realisation that she would have use her brains rather than her muscles emerged in her pain-soaked mind. This helped her to calm down and look for a solution to her problem. Thinking straight proved hard as the dildo kept torturing her bowels but slowly a plan began to emerge.
Trying to ignore the pain and the burning in her lungs she concentrated on her hands. They were encased into a leather pouch at the end of the arm-binder. She began to claw at the thick material, combining the strength of her fingers and the sharpness and length of her nails to pierce a hole. As her hands had initially been balled into fist to fit inside the pouch, the progress was initially slow, only helped by the slight slack she had earned herself by contracting her muscles when the seven handcuffs had been locked. As the pouch got looser it became easier and after a few minutes her hands were rid of the leather. She flexed them a couple of times, enjoying this tiny bit if hard-won freedom.
She then tried to reach the chain that was wrapped around her legs. Because the first pair of handcuffs was locked to her waist she could not reach down to the coils that were around her thighs. She tried to flex her legs and bring her ankles next to her hands but there was such a thickness of chain around her knees that she could not fold them more than 90�. She would first have to get rid of that waist chain.
Moving her arms was painful because of the extreme strain in her shoulders. Still she forced to do it so as to bring her fingers to the waist chain. Once she managed to grasp it between her right fist she clenched it with all her strength on one of the links. The muscles in her arms bulged against the seven handcuffs. She felt the link caving in under the pressure and suddenly the link snapped apart. With a bit of work she managed to uncoil the waist chain, earning her arms a bit more freedom.
She took a few seconds to rest after this effort. Pain was spreading from her vagina and her breasts to her entire body. Her jaws too were aching badly, seemingly on the verge of being dislocated. The anguish of asphyxia was still present but at least she had the relief to have made some progress.
The next step was to free her legs. Now that she could move her arms she bent curled on the floor, bending at the waist and reaching with her fingers towards her thighs. Once she found a chain link she crushed it in her fist until it broke. Shaking her legs she got some slack in the chain before repeating the operation with another link. She progressed likewise, going down her legs, breaking links here and there and shaking her legs to get some slack. At some point she had broken enough links to slacken the chain above her knees and make it fall around her lower legs. This allowed her to bend her legs and reach for her ankles. There she broke some more links and finally the chained fell apart, leaving only the shackles to hold her feet.
By that time she was exhausted and her fingers were aching from working so much. Her lungs were now burning a lot and she felt the urge to breathe getting very strong. She indulged herself into a little rest before continuing her escape.
She now turned to remove the leg irons. Her first move was to explore the link between the shackle to break it as she had done with the chain but those were Safe Hard devices made in an alloy that was more resistant than steel. They were too much for her fingers. However, her legs were now free and she tried to fold one leg while stretching the other. The shackles creaked and groaned, pressed into her flesh, but progressively they seemed to bend and twist, slowly but really. Suddenly, after a lot of efforts, the link broke her feet were apart, although she was still wearing the cuffs on each ankle. At least now she could move her legs freely.
The pain in her breasts was growing relentlessly as more blood got trapped inside them as time passed. They had swollen bigger and tauter and were now throbbing as if they were going to explode. Her areolae had been stretched in the process as well and were now incredibly large. There was nothing the poor heroine could do to relieve the pain though, except continue to progress on the path to freedom.
She contorted her arms, trying to slacken the armbinder but after some frantic efforts she had to admit that it had been bound way too tight. It would never go like that. She would have to destroy it. Alas, so far it had resisted to all her attempts at breaking it, just because the seven handcuffs were holding her forearms so well. If only she could use her laser eyes� That thought triggered the next idea.
She sat up on the floor, pressed her soles against each other and spread her knees apart. She then bent over at the waist, bringing her face against her feet. Blind, she could not see exactly where they were and had to locate them with her nose. She began to rub the blindfold against her big toes, trying to push her toe-nails under the leather. By continuous effort she managed to push the blindfold up her face, millimetre by millimetre. As it moved off her eyes some space began to appear at the lower hem of the piece of leather. That space got large enough for her to push a toe under and from there she just had to push the blindfold completely off her face.
She blinked a few times, trying to focus her eyes under water. She looked around herself. She could see the crowd but not very well. She saw the sturdiness of the cell frame. It was going to take a lot of time to cut through it with her laser.
She stood up victoriously, trying to cross Belinda's eyes and glare at her. She then focused her eyes on the one side of the lid and shot her laser. The water instantly boiled along its trajectory and bubbles appeared on the steel of the lid where the lasers converged. She stopped the laser and looked at the damages. She had just punctured a very shallow dent in the extra hard alloy. Indeed, cutting through that lid would take a lot of time. More time than she actually had, judging by how bad her lungs burned. She even already feel a kind of dizziness and headache she had never felt but could only come from her brains getting short in oxygen.
Panic began to fill her heart again and for a few seconds she looked all around her with wide-open eyes, looking for an escape route that was nowhere to be seen. Then she forced herself to calm down. Oxygen was her main problem now and she had to get some. Maybe�
She got on her knees and focused her eye-lasers on a point of the glass wall, at the edge between the steel frame and the glass panel. Maybe the glass would frailer there, close to its edge. The glass too was very resistant to heat, it seemed but still she continued to burn the glass with all the strength she could put into her eyes. After five minutes of lasering, she had pierced a hole through the glass, about one millimetre wide. She then stood up and repeated the same operation near the ceiling. Five more minutes passed. Asphyxia was now severe. Her vision was tunneling and she had a terrible headache. Her lungs were like in fire and several times already she had breathed in water in her desire to get air.
Suddenly, the hole was pierced and immediately bubbles became to appear. Air was entering the cell, while water was coming out through the bottom hole. The holes were tiny and the debit was small, but it was going to happen, sooner or later.
Alas, it seemed that "later" was the most likely outcome. Air seemed to enter the cell at a slower rate than she was depleting her meagre reserves. The burning in her lungs was getting unbearable and the symptoms of asphyxia stronger. Her head ached as if a hammer was banging on her head with each heartbeat. Her legs felt weak and wobbly. Meanwhile, the horrible buzzing of the enormous dildo kept torturing her vagina, causing throbbing cramps in her lower belly as if she were in her periods but 100 times worse. She tried to curl in a ball but that only made it worse. Her breasts too were torturing her. They had now positively doubled in volume. It seemed that they had not yet exploded just because her skin was unbreakable. She could actually feel her heart beating inside them, each pulsation sending a wave of pain through her torso.
She needed air! She stood on her toes and pressed herself against the glass panel, offering an incredibly hot sight to those outside, to push her face against the tiny hole she had pierced and breathe from the bubbles. Perhaps, had she not been gagged, she would have succeeded but as she could only breathe through her nose it was impossible. Therefore she tried to enlarge the hole or pierce another one with her eye-laser. Unfortunately, she could no longer focus them properly.
There was narrow layer of air floating against the cell lid but she was not tall enough to reach it. The weight of the handcuffs and leg iron was keeping her down. She tried to swim upward but only succeeded in banging her head against the lid. She could not remain long enough with her nose pressed against the ceiling to breathe. All she was doing was to deplete her oxygen reserves faster.
Suffering like she never had, Super-Woman sat down in a corner, her legs folded in front of her. In that position, she was sitting on the external tip of the dildo, making it even more painful. She quickly switched to her knees, grimacing around the huge, unyielding ball gag. Her long blonde hair was floating around her head, blocking some of her vision. She contorted her severely bound arms again, trying for the hundredth time to break the handcuffs. She moaned in terrible agony, shaking her head in disbelief. How such a pain was possible?
Her fingers found the hip straps of the dildo, somewhat by chance. Immediately she broke them apart and then she tried to push the intruder out with the strength of her inner muscles. Alas, the object was much too wide and its neck much too narrow. Expelling it meant stretching the entrance to her sex almost as wide as if she were giving birth and she could just not bear the pain it caused. Moreover, each attempt she made to push it out pressed the studs hard into the soft tissue of her love channel, increasing her suffering.
Her vision was blurred by pain, narrowed by her imminent loss of consciousness. She was actually crying but thankfully her tears mixed with the water and could not be seen. Unable to stay on her knees any longer she let herself fall on her side and she squirmed some more, like a cut worm, desperately trying to find a position that would bring her some relief. This was impossible alas and she kept suffering miserably. Her jerking became weaker though as her energy was getting very low. Her eyes were wide open although she was not really looking at anything. Short blasts of laser shoot from time to time in random directions. Her nostrils were flaring helplessly. Her fists were clenched tight behind her butt and her toes were hopelessly clawing at the glass.
She suffered like that for a long time, becoming weaker and weaker. Her super-energy had become her curse as she could not just die quickly but had to endure the pain for longer than any common mortal. Had Super-Woman's life come to its fateful end?
She glanced one last time at the ceiling and she saw something glittering near the lid. Glittering? Wavelets? That meant there was a surface! There was air! Gathering all her willpower she forced herself to get back to her knees, screaming in agony into her gag. Then she braced a shoulder against the wall and pushed herself up to her feet. She then climbed on her toes and reached up with her nose. And there she reached the surface. She filled her lungs with several deep breaths and immediately she felt energy flow back into her muscles. Her brains cleared, hope shined again in her mind. The small volume of air was quickly consumed but it had been enough to revive her.
She went back down on her knees and used her eye-laser on the hole she had pierced at the bottom of the glass panel. Patiently she widened it, working in concentric circles. The water was now leaving the tank faster, flooding the stage around it. Air could enter more rapidly as well, allowing her to breathe more often and refill her energy supply. Her super-health had also begun to repair the damages caused by the dildo and the pliers. The battery of the former was also beginning to weaken and its vibrations were no longer what they used to be. Or maybe her body was adapting to it, strengthening her vagina at the same time it healed it.
Once the surface had gotten under her chin when standing, she felt strong enough to attempt to break the glass again. She had weakened it by dragging her eye-laser along lines that converged on the two holes she had pierced. Those lines did not go through the glass but had dented it, hopefully enough to weaken it.
She positioned herself carefully, bracing her arms against the opposite wall, and then she launched a powerful kick, hitting the middle of the glass panel with her heel. The whole cell shook under&nbsp; the shock and little cracks began to appear around the holes. Super-Woman kicked again, and again, each time lengthening the cracks. On the fourth kick, the glass wall suddenly exploded in thousands of pieces and the water rushed out on the stage like a cataract.
Super-Woman grinned. The only thing that now barred her way out were the chains that had been wrapped around the tank in order to prevent her from lifting the lid. She aimed her eye laser on one of them. The link quickly turned to a glowing red and snapped apart under the tension it had been subjected to. That chain fell on the stage, leaving a wide space.
She squeezed her naked body in between two chains. Forcing her bulging, throbbing breasts through proved very painful she was able to do it and there she was, on the stage, on her knees, dripping water, her blonde hair sticking to her skin down to her navel. She was still gagged, her arms were as tightly restrained as ever behind her back, the vibrator was running out of batteries but was still on and you could see on her face that she was currently really weak and tired. She tried to stand up but she just couldn&#8217;t. Some mild booing came from the crowd
Belinda grabbed the microphone again and mockingly patronizing the nude blonde said: �Hey guys, don&#8217;t be rude, she couldn&#8217;t make it at once, poor baby!! We now know for sure that she&#8217;s not a top tier escape artist, let her show us she&#8217;s a kind of average mediocre one, let her try to free herself for a second time and with no danger involved, like little kids do when playing cowboys and indians�
Super-Woman angrily glared at Belinda. She shook her head, trying to free her face from the blonde locks that were sticking to it. Now that she was out of the water she had begun to drool again; there was nothing she could do about it. The painful ball-gag left her totally unable to respond to Belinda's mockeries, which angered her even more. She tried to speak but the muffled moans she managed to produce felt even more humiliating than remaining silent. That helped Belinda mock her even more which heated the crowd hugely against her.
Realizing that indeed the vibrator was running out of batteries she damned Hard Safe for that and she put some new ones so that the sexual toy could work at maximum power again �It would be unfair if my favourite slutgirl does not enjoy this part as the rest of the performance�. People laugh a lot and insult Super-Woman even more, they were on Belinda side� and she knew it.
Realising what they were attempting to do, Uper-Woman clenched her thighs together to block the access to the infernal dildo. Her strength ensured the would never be able to pull them apart. Unfortunately, her slender legs left a space next to her pussy and, as she was already exhauste by all her efforts, she could not prevent the assistants to put fresh batteries in the torture dildo.
Immediately it began to vibrate to full power, renewing the inhuman pain that shook her vagina. She screamed into her gag and rolled on the floor while she tried to contort herself to get out of the armbinder; however it was obvious that she could not do anything. She tried to twist her neck and shoot her eye-laser at her restraints, but this was impossible too. She tried to bang her arms against the cell frame to break the restraints apart, but the more she tried, the more pain she felt in her bowels and breasts. Those kept swelling and getting more painful. In addition, the huge activity in her vagina during so many time was making her dizzy. That was not the best situation to face an escape. Furthermore she had spams once in a while. Impossible mission.
After 15 minutes of failed attempts she was once again covered in sweat and grimacing from pain. Worse, she had made no progress at all. The pain in her breasts had grown unbearable and she felt tears coming to her eyes. She shook her head angrily and helplessly twitched her lips around the ball-gag, grunting something that sounded like a desperate admission of helplessness. Tears were rolling down her cheeks, testifying of her agony, humiliation and rage.

THE ESCAPE DUEL
The audience did not know how to react: that was not the grande finale they were expecting and they had never seem Super-Woman so torn apart, so wasted, crying out for some help while arching in pain due to a huge dildo... So far away from the proud figure of renown and unpolluted crime-fighter � So some seconds of pretty uncomfortable silence followed until� people started taunting the destroyed superheroine for this awful, shameful performance. That lighted a bulb in Belinda&#8217;s mind, maybe she shouldn&#8217;t have felt so disappointed, maybe she would have another chance to kill Super-Woman and have an even better time.
Belinda&#8217;s mockery continued: �Well, well, Super-Woman, It seems that&#8217;s all you can do. Not much I would say. Me and the girls warned you: this could be more than you could chew and there you go, you cannot chew anything because you couldn&#8217;t even get your gag out� The audience laughed a lot. Really enjoying this.
Super-Woman growled into her gag. She wanted to reply, to defend herself, but she could not even use her tongue to do so and this made her feel even more humiliated and helpless.
Belinda went on, now with a very serious tone: �Anyway you have to admit that you failed miserably and this is the most shameful performance I have ever seen from an escape artist, we could say that it was very difficult but it is not an excuse because you accepted and, over all, you are a damned superheroine with lots of superpowers�
Walking around the stage facing the captive superheroine and the audience as if she were a prosecutor at a trial �we, the escape artists have a commitment with the public that if we fail, we must pay them with our lives. That is something that you broke today in a dastard way: you promised not to use your superpowers and that was all that you could employ to save your life. Cheating and breaking our rules for your escape was all you could do to avoid death and finally to lie forlorn begging for help."
Again, Super-Woman tried to speak, to tell that she had never promised anything, but all she could do was to bite the ball gag and drool some more on her chest.
"Anyway, let&#8217;s look forward, I can give you two options now: a) we all finish this show, go home and leave you here as you are, dishonored, chickened out or... b) we keep going with the show so you can fight to get your dignity and honor back. You and I do both my finale escape artist; obviously, you with kryptonite to make it a fair competition, I do not have superpowers. If you do it better than me, you get forgiven, if you don&#8217;t do it in time, you will certainly die and if you do it in time but later than me, you promise to face another challenge from me, next month at a nation-wide broadcasted show from the Madison Square Garden where, don&#8217;t fool yourself again, we will put you really, really to the test, no more mediocrity from a superheroine� So� What do you choose A or B??� People were imploring Super-Woman to choose B, but she could not talk, being gagged.
Belinda mocked her for a little while then patronizing her (she knew Super-Woman hated it) caressed her hair and unbuckling it very slowly, removed her gag. A huge gobble of saliva dribbled down her chin and for a moment she was unable to close her mouth, which remained gaping, giving her a rather stupid expression. The exhausted blonde, clearly on the horns of a dilemma, eventually chose B, even though she knew the competition would never be fair and she could die, she could not be pictured as a trembler in front of the public opinion, all her career as an honored and inspiring figure would be wasted if she chickened out.
People exploded with a huge ovation. This was the greatest show ever. Now they were going to enjoy the duel between the best escape artist in the world and the best superheroine in the world. 
Belinda showed her best smile and said with enthusiasm �Girls, untie our host, bring the kryptonite devices and prepare the crushing box!!! Well Super-Woman is joining me today� two crushing boxes�
Then the show went to a break so that some men removed what was left of the cell and cleaned and dried everything on stage, Belinda and the girls get to untie the naked superheroine with so much joy and sadism. They put some gloves on and started untying the barbedwire from her tits, very slowly, to cause more pain. As sharp as it was it had punctured some parts of her skin and you had to tug it to get it off, very slowly, they wanted her to suffer, even more.
The audience looked with attention to the nude heroine, she used to be so gorgeous, so cocky that everyone was enjoying very much this reckoning.
Then they removed the dildo, but first they played with her getting it in and out some times before finally getting it out with a big tug. Super-Woman was crying loud and the audience was having the time of their lives. She was begging them to stop and get her rid of the infamous object. Once the vibrator was eventually out but still running, the audience got so scared by the noise and the vibration that it made. It sounded like a plane taking off. The four girls could not even hold it so they let it fall to the ground to tackle and turn it off with a lot of effort. That was a funny scene but the people didn&#8217;t laugh at all because they were so impressed of the power of the tool that dwelt for almost an hour in Super-Woman&#8217;s vagina. They understood how relieved she felt now and what a maryrdom she went through. This pity feeling lasted only some minutes, they were ready again to more suffering!!
Finally, they removed the arm-strap device. Then told the audience that they would let Super-Woman rest for a while at the Backstage. The truth was that they had to wait for someone from Safe Hard to remove those handcuffs. Super-Woman clearly understood now why she could not get out of them�
Meanwhile they placed some Kryptonite devices on the defeated heroine so as to deprive her from her superpowers. A pair of kryptonite bracelets were locked around her biceps, a second one around her wrists, a third just above her knees and a fourth around her ankles. Those would reduce the strength of her limbs to human level, although Super-Woman was still of body-builder class. Finally, a kryptonite band was locked around her neck, whose aura would radiate down her upper chest and up her face. Hopefully, the combined effects of those devices would also block her ability to fly. Super-Woman was clearly not liking it. The kryptonite was very disagreeable to her.
Finally the Safe Hard engineers came and got her out of the seven handcuffs. By that time, Super-Woman's super-healing had restored her to normal. Belinda approached the nude (and finally free) superheroine and threw her a bikini �you seem to have recovered now and your tits look great again, cover yourself I don&#8217;t want you to get all the attention before New York� and she smilee ironically at her before going on stage. The bikini proved very skimpy and she would have preferred to get back her normal outfit, but that was better than nothing.
Super-Woman appeared a minute later wearing the green bikini. People would have preferred her nude but she was hot anyway. Belinda changed her zatanna-sltyle costume for another bikini. She was as hot as Super-Woman, but once they were one next to each other some differences were obvious: Super-Woman was much taller (almost 6 feet versus Belinda&#8217;s 5 feet 5) and had bigger breasts than Belinda (who seemed to have a still great C cup). She was also more muscular and athletic.
Everything was ready to begin the show again. Belinda grabbed the microphone:
�Welcome again, ladies and gentlemen, what a show we have had tonight!! Now I shall perfom my great finale but we have accepted to give our host tonight the chance to clean her honor dueling with me in this death-daring escape, the crushing box��
Belinda let the microphone to a gorgeous blonde presenter and went next to Super-Woman waiting to be tied for the escape. This girl had just come to the show wearing a tight white dress with a great perky ass and some good breasts too.
�Tonight these beautiful ladies will be blindfolded, handcuffed and put inside those steel boxes that these lovely assistants are bringing to the stage. Once inside, the boxes will be closed with locks and chains and the former will be broken so that they can no longer be opened. Both your boxes will be placed inside these industrial crushers��
On stage right next to the two ladies, you could see two incredibly threatening machines. They consisted simply of a steel platform were the boxes would be placed and, over it lied a huge solid steel plate that, once released, would fall with all its 10-ton weight, crushing everything on its way. There was a third box on stage that was used to show how much damage those machines could do to our performers� The Steel plate fell and the box was reduced to dust. They both (with emphasis) would be reduced to pulp, because �as some of you may figure Super-Woman may survive one of those impacts, as we say, but to make everything fair, we are going to use kryptonite�. The presenter showed the bands of kryptonite that had been locked around her limbs and neck, which, obviously, made her feel much weaker. She had had no choice to accept them and now it was too late to remove them. The presenter waited a few seconds and slapped hard Super-Woman who fell down and got a little bruise on her face. �You see, now she does not have superpowers. Fair competition�
Super-Woman stood back up, rubbing her cheek and glaring at Belinda.
�In case both girls escape before two minutes the winner will be the one that gets this gem inside this cardboard box� and place that gem inside the box and close it. It was placed in between the two crushing machines.
�If they fail to escape on time, their bodies will be smashed to pulp, if they both make it and Super-Woman wins, she will be forgiven for her disastrous performance and cheating about the conditions that had been previously established but if they both make it and Belinda wins, we will see you in New York in a month for the greatest show ever,&nbsp; Destroy Super-Woman!!� Everyone cheered Belinda, they wanted so much to see that show. However they didn&#8217;t have all the chances with them, despite of being without powers, Super-Woman was a great escape artist and she was feeling really confident about that escape �this is so much easier than the other one, even without my powers I think I can win this�
Two volunteers from the audience were asked to supervise the binding process and confirm that there was a fair competition between the two ladies and the show started.
Christina was tying Belinda with fake rudeness and Jennifer was tying Super-Woman rough and tough only one handcuff went into her wrists this time but it really bit her skin, then they both were applied blindfolds and were helped into their boxes as soon as Jennifer was closing the box whispered the kryponited superheroine: �I know you miss your vibrating friend but don&#8217;t worry we have another surprise. See you in hell or in New York� and she closed the lid and the locks with the chains.
Both girls were properly restrained and the presenter asked them if they were ready. When they shouted �yes�, she started the competition with a strong �start the countdown!!� and they started struggling.
Belinda knew that Super-Woman was a great escape artist and did not want to have the possibility of losing so, when our captive blonde startied fighting her bonds, some sleeping gas was released into her box making her clumsy and slow. She did not bother about releasing the handcuffs. Instead she just curled her legs up and squeezed her hips, then her legs, through her arms. With her hands now in front of her, removing the blindfold was easy. She then turned to break the box to pieces. With her super-strength that would have been done in a matter of seconds. Now, she was just an athletic woman and she had to break the planks one by one, kicking them with her feet, knees, elbows and fists. As soon as she got a hole wide enough to let her through she squeezed herself out of it. The chains were hanging loosely around the partly destroyed box and did not offer any problem.
As she appeared under the spotlights, Super-Woman was covered in sweat and saw dust. The left cup of her bikini top had slid aside during he struggles, revealing the nipple and areola of her magnificient breast. As she stood up in the middle of the wreckage she quickly put the cloth back in place. A quick glance at the chonometre told her that there still were 20 seconds to go.
Belinda was not out yet! Super-Woman grinned victoriously and ran to the cardboard box, opened it and� There she was, Belinda, inside it, with the gem in her hands �See you in NY bitch� she snarled. The blonde heroine's lips former a shocked O as she looked at her ennemy inside the box. It was so obvious that she had cheated that she could not find anything to say. Anyway, however Belinda had done it, she had won, at least to the millions of spectators she had, and Super-Woman was once again trapped.
The crowd went wild. Greatest show ever. Until next month.

DESTROY SUPER-WOMAN

Escape act in NY
The duel between Belinda and Super-Woman was so commented and all the media wanted to talk about it. It was sold out in some hours. TVs all around the world were broadcasting it, the only problem was that Belinda insisted that it would have violence, sex, strong violence... TVs offered her a lot of money to make more of a family show but she refused. She wanted to kill Super-Woman, she was already rich, she did not need more money.
Super-Woman has never given an interview and Belinda was missing since the duel. The Madison Square Garden was closed and reporters were not allowed inside, everything was treated with high security and privacy, supposedly because Belinda ordered it, so that the escape was a concealed secret, she didn't want Super-Woman to know anything about it and she was achieving it. Anyway, she was never seen at the Madison. As there were no news. A lot of buzz emerged: Rumours had it that Belinda and her crew was working at the Safe Hard headquarters with their engineers on new devices to finally defeat Super-Woman. There was another rumor that some people that were previously put in jail by Super-Woman were supporting Belinda financially to build her deadly devices.
TV talk shows discuss the "Destroy Super-Woman" show everyday, it was like nothing else happened that month. The problem was that everything were rumours� What they only know about the show was the press release in which Belinda talked about what to expect:
"the greatest show in the history of earth, the greatest superheroine, Super-Woman will face the most dangerous challenge that she has ever being put in by any villain. To avoid her certain death, she will have to survive unbelievably tough tests to her body, her mind and her senses"
"Belinda, myself, will design the whole show and all the devices that she will have to fight to achieve this incredible feat. Setting up an escape stunt for a superheroine is one of the most creative activities that I have been into, you don't have to think big but huge, everything has to be perfect and highly lethal, otherwise she will freed herself so easily and there won't be any interest in the show. The only limitation I will have is not to use kryptonite at any point of the performance"
"Judge Miss Peterson from NY has been invited by me personally so that she checks everything is according to the contract that me, Belinda and Super-Woman will sign prior to the escape, if I am going to kill Super-Woman this is because she is a cocky whore who needs to show her courage and prowess after starring the greatest shame in professional magic, and asks me to put her to the test. If she wants to save her life tell her to back down and confess that she is afraid of me, she will be asked at the beginning of the show, if she decides to go on with this challenge, she will face death with all its cruelty. We are not going to be pitiful anymore she may escape or she may die, there aren't any other possibilities, well, she may chicken out..."
"Recent bets talk about 70% probability of death for Super-Woman, I think that percentage is too low; we know what their weaknesses are, we know what to do, we have all the motivation and technology and specially, the first time, we almost got her, second time we are not going to fail again... if I were you I will put your money on Superbitch dying, or maybe on Superslut chickening out"

At the police station
(Reading the press release)
"My god, this girl is getting so aggressive... Super-Woman do you know what you are up to? You should seriously consider surrender and avoid all that weird show. Do you understand that Belinda is so dangerous and that you are going to serve yourself on a plate so that all the villains in this country try to kill you?? This time is not only Belinda, they all are helping her. And do not forget about Safe Hard, they are experts"
"I&nbsp; understand your concerns captain but I believe I got my honour and I need to go there and face my destiny, I know you were right and I shouldn't have started this but I think she tricked me and know I have to end this thing in NY with her even if that means confronting all the villains of this country. And you are right, those people at Safe Hard are geniuses, they develop great devices. It&#8217;s so hard to escape them. I cannot tell you why, but I will definitely go and show who the queen of escapes is"
"My dear, have you seen what the press says that your escape may be? Take a look, some guys in this newspaper said that they found in Safe Hard inc. some plan to weld a woman to a nuke and send it to explode somewhere in the middle of the ocean, some other people said that her plan is to put you in a very profound hole and fill it with cement... and then there's kryptonite, how are you so sure that she's not going to use it? and what about the new materials? You and I both know that you can't break anything and some others are not affected by your laser-sight... In addition you have allowed her to do anything to you before your escape... Do you know what does it imply?? You are definitely going to get nude and molested again!! And this will be broadcasted around the world... I think you are nuts..."
�Maybe captain, but I am going in and I may even enjoy that night, destroying that bitch's self-confidence."

Preliminary bondage
At the Madison Square Garden
"Destroy Super-Woman" was certainly the event of the year, maybe the century, TVs from every corner of the earth were here in NY to broadcast the greatest feat ever in the escapology world, many famous people came and something like the "oscars red carpet" was set so that they all could be interviewed. Some say that it was incredible that "our greatest heroine will face Belinda with no other limitation than the use of Kryptonite." Others highlighted the fact that "No one has ever being so brave, specially after knowing that the magician is capable of anything to achieve her deadly goals"
Belinda came early so was interviewed by the media "I just want to say to that hooker that I do not want to kill her, so she'd better get her slutty cape and fly away as fast as she can. I warned everyone, I am damn serious today. Once the show starts I am making sure she's not going anywhere. I have everything set to put her on an inescapable grave no matter how strong she is..." and refused to say anything else.
The show started with Belinda in the center of the stage with the microphone; the time had come and Super-Woman had not appeared so Belinda said that she will describe all the rules of this challenge to see if she may arrive then. When she was explaining that anything that might happen that day was Super-Woman's responsibility she appeared flying and landed at the top of the stairs, looking down at Belinda. Everyone was in silence listening to the verbal battle of the two gladiators:
"I am glad that you remember that when I beat you today, everybody will know that it is my responsibility that you are incapable of making a device good enough to kill me" she was not letting her win the mental fight. And she started going down the stairs to where Belinda was waiting for her.
"I am glad too that you finally came, but don't worry now you are going to be asked if you want to leave and so you can fly away and admit you are scared out of me" replied Belinda.
"My only fear is that anyone in the world may think that you are the greatest escape artist in the world"
"Well, superslut, maybe today there are doubts, in some hours there won't be any"
"Some hours? will this take me so long?? I&#8217;m in a hurry to put a thief magician in jail..."
"Yes darling, I could have killed you in a rapid way, but as you are so cocky to accept this challenge I am going to enjoy it very slowly. I am going to take my time"
"Ok Belinda, you got me" and, as she was right next to her, she kissed her on her lips very sexually. Belinda pushed her away and recovering her smile responded:
"It's nice to see that you are so happy today. We all like to frolic. Please Judge Peterson make sure everything is ok, we can&#8217;t wait to start playing our games in the show"
"Good Night, Super-Woman I just need to know that you are here voluntarily and that no one has forced you to face this challenge"
"Right, it is that way, judge" Then Super-Woman signed all the papers with conditions to this escape with disregard, without reading them handing them back to Miss Peterson.
"Aren't you going to read them?"
"No, it's ok, thank you for your time, judge"
"Okay, Belinda, everything is ok. Whatever happens today is on Super-Woman. You may proceed I will let you alone. Good luck with the show" and the judge took a seat from where she could check that the agreed rules were not broken.
"Thanks" Responded Super-Woman
"He meant good luck to me killing you" said Belinda with a smile.
The audience hasn't said a word yet because they were so into this verbal battle that they did not know what to do. Just when the judge left the stage, Belinda raised the curtain, started the music (Tainted Love by Marilyn Manson), and her three gorgeous assistants appeared on stage and the first round of applause was heard. They looked incredibly hot.
The three assistants Christina, Jennifer and Maria this time were dressed very sexy but not as if they were soldiers, today their attire pictured them as executioners. Very appropriate for how Belinda wanted to end this show. Shorts, boots and cleveaged tops all in black leather with a hood. Very sexy and unsettling appearance. Belinda maintained her �Zatanna-Style� costume from her last performance.
They circled and caressed Super-Woman with pity while Belinda stayed some feet away with the mic. The situation seemed like when in the Medieval Times executioners prepare someone to die, maybe with a guillotine and some other person read the execution sentence. The three girls stayed still at a mere feet of Super-Woman looking straight at her. Super-Woman tried to stay calm but was starting to feel the tension of the event and she was not joyful anymore. Belinda noticed it and smiled.
"Ok Super-Woman you decided not to leave so, you will die. We don't want to waste your beautiful costume and lingerie, let's see you nude again."
"I already kissed you, Belinda, what else do you want from me" mocked Super-Woman while she was removing her clothes
"I love to see you smile, in a while you may be crying aloud, don't worry, enjoy your time while you can. In fact, I am tired of you chitchat. Ladies put her the gag... Is it familiar? It's an improved version of the one that you enjoyed so much one month ago, you liked it so greatly that you wore it until the end. Do you remember?"
But already Super-Woman was unable to respond anymore to the smiling villain that felt more confident. The ball gag had been forced past her perfect teeth and pulled as far down the back of her mouth as the assistants could. The ball was slightly bigger than the previous time and it was made out of pure steel as they had found that the hard rubber had been dented by her extra-strong teeth. Its shape was noticeably different as well, resembling a pear, whose narrower end was now pushed towards her throat and making her drool and gag fiercely. She attempted to ignore the urge to gag, shaking her head as if it could get her rid of the huge pear.
The audience started siding with Belinda with timid shouts. Bets were 85% that she was dying so the expectation was that the audience clearly wanted the superheroine to fail: 5% was her backing down and the rest 10% thought that the superheroine was going to make it. Not a favorable outlook for her.
"You know what? I am also tired of your whore face so I brought this disciplinary hood made specially for you by your friends at Safe Hard. They love you so much" Belinda was starting to enjoy this all again very much. "As last time you managed to get out of your blindfold and use your laser-sight, we decided that we should use something more difficult to remove to avoid you cheating again. We told you, today you may escape or you may die..."
Super-Woman's eyes grew wider at the sight of the evil hood. The idea of having her face encased in it was not pleasing her at all, but there was no way she could object to it now. The hood was made of some thick material pre-shaped to fit a female face. It was pulled over her somewhat anguished features. It had to be yanked down to fit snugly. Her hair was pressed inside the hood. The hood went down to just under her jaws. A few straps were tightened behind her skull to make it even tighter, pressing pads into her eyes and forcing her nose into its lodgement. She finally buckled them tight behind her head and locked them with a small but strong padlock. It&#8217;s keyhole was filled with cement to make it impossible to introduce any key and, obviously, to open again. It was perfectly blocked. It was very tight and fitting snugly to her face features. There were only a few opening in the hood: a pair of holes in front of her nostrils, and a few more in front of her gag. Those were not to let air come in but to let her saliva drool out, something the public had enjoyed a lot as it was so deeply humiliating for Super-Woman.
"As long as you have this hood on, you won't be able to use your laser eyes. It is made of the same fabric as the last one. As you see, we studied our last encounter very carefully whilst on the contrary you are a careless bitch and that's why you are going to be dead tonight"
People in the audience started to warm up and some shouts and applauses could be heard as the superheroine was being buried under bondage devices. Now with the hood on and with the girls around her in such an aggressive pose, Super-Woman really looked as someone about to be executed, we only needed to see how...
"Studying your last performance, we have understood that you could make it because we got you to hyperventilate very late, not long enough that was why you still had a lot of stamina left. Now we want to wear you down, that's why you are going to get the dildo right now, at the beginning so you get to enjoy it very much and you don't have much strength before facing my lethal device. Now I know that, as many jokes I tell the more tired you will be" People laugh aloud for the first time.
Belinda kept talking about the dildo: "We know through social media that it was one of the things that people liked the most and so, we have been working since then to make it even better. This lovely whore is going to enjoy it very much, the one that we used on the other show was one hundred times more powerful than the ones in the market this one gets to five hundred times; improvements were made also on the battery so that it lasts more and our horny host can enjoy the whole ride. In addition we improved the straps, we saw one month ago that you wanted it out, no, no, you are going to wear it forever� Belinda was so happy. Super-Woman felt nervous now. The motorised dildo had been a nightmare already and she was scared by what the new version was going to do to her poor vagina. Just at that thought her sex clenched in fear.
�I know our fans were very impressed by its vibrations once it was outside of the vagina of this lovely crimefighter and so we want to show you this" and she placed it vertically on a special support and turned it on; it started an increasing noise that turned deafening in some seconds. It was like you were sitting right next to a plane engine while taking off, the audience could feel the menacing throbbing of the device and they stayed in silence for a while so excited for what they were going to see. Super-Woman could not see it but she could hear the infernal noise and even feel the vibration transmitted through the stage floor to her bare feet.
The �executioner assistants� turned it off and pointed it towards Super-Woman. Scared to get that monster into herself, she refused to open her legs to let it inside her. Even though the assistants tried, they were unable to force her legs apart. After a few minutes, in the middle of the struggle between our captive blonde legs and the three assistants, Miss Peterson interrupted them.
"Dear Super-Woman, I am even more afraid than you of that outrageous vibrator but I am also afraid that you have to let Belinda use that dildo inside you as monstrous as it may be. You accepted it in the conditions: (reading) Belinda will be able to use any kind of specially modified sexual tools for the event. I understand that Belinda wants to use all the advantages that you confer her. Therefore you have to let her put you either in peril or in bondage. Please let Belinda introduce the dildo" Belinda smiled at Miss Peterson and Super-Woman lower her head in frustration. She opened her legs and the three assistants kneeled and pushed up with huge efforts the immense dildo while Belinda was making fun of her caressing her abs and butt and licking and biting her breasts "I know this is your favourite part Super-Whore" Yes!! The crowd was now already connected and they responded cheering and shouting to the suffering of the superheroine.
The dildo was so monstrous that, even without being turned on it was destroying Super-Woman from the inside. She tried to stay still with dignity but she just couldn&#8217;t bear it, she contorted her body and made some strange noises. Belinda mocked her �See, I knew you would like it. Can&#8217;t hear your giggle now�� She approached her and added referring to the saliva coming down her hood to her boobs and belly: �you are such a filthy whore� and she spread that liquid all over the superheroine magnificent breasts massaging them while licking and biting them. People in the audience were very surprised of why Super-Woman was quiet, not using her still unbound arms to resist; they didn&#8217;t know that, if Super-Woman resisted twice in her ordeal, Belinda would be able to use Kryptonite on her which would mean her certain death.
Some women in the audience felt aroused. But Belinda did not want Super-Woman to feel any pleasure so, she did everything to inflict pain, subtly pinching her tits while the massage and, late doing the same with their belly and clit. With this Belinda wanted to try to get access to the Kryptonite but also to avoid the captive blonde to feel how the assistants were fastening the dildo to her at that same very moment. They were kneeled, thoroughly binding it with two shackles to her hips and securing each with two very strong padlocks.
Once finished they stood up again and made an OK sign to Belinda, who stopped caressing Super-Woman and touch her clit and right next to it, turned on the dildo and broke the button �Enjoy, nobody will ever stop it�.
Belinda could never try it but she worked extensively with Safe Hard Engineers to understand perfectly what she would feel if her body was strong enough to wear it: first of all, you feel a nice sexual feeling in your clit, just like a regular dildo but, in some seconds the vibrations got harder and harder that sexual pleasure transform into excruciating pain in your inside growing and growing. This would lead a standard woman to die. Super-Woman was getting as dizzy as to find it really hard to merely stand. She finally kneeled and leaned with her hands on the floor; people in the audience could not hear the captive superheroine screaming in pain, but Belinda and the girls did. That gave them a huge sadistic enjoyment.
Their arch-enemy was having such a bad time. Belinda reminded then her conversations with the engineers, they said that Super-Woman would have it more difficult to escape if she&#8217;d get orgasm and orgasm while performing but Belinda did not want her to have any kind of pleasure so she insisted on changing the greatest pleasure giver in the world into the biggest nightmare pain provider. Super-Woman was attesting it very crudely; she was not even able to stand.
Belinda told the girls to leave their host alone for a while contorting in pain, kneeled in the center of the stage, nude, gagged and hooded. Her hands were untied and the temptation to turn the dildo off was growing in her head. That would allow Belinda to use Kryptonite and the certain death of the blonde heroine. She knew it was a huge mistake to reject the dildo initially because she had it anyway and lost all leeway, now if she gave in to her weakness and resisted any of the things that Belinda would be doing to her, she would lose all her superpowers. She had to stay strong, but the vibrator was giving her unbelievable pain from her very deep inside. Both her judgment and her abilities were quite clouded and we were only at the beginning. That was going to be a long night.
Belinda saw that Super-Woman was not going to give up then, so she tried to raise the bar a little bit, to tempt more Super-Woman and to keep exhausting her up.

Torture
�I am sure that Super-Woman is still too rested. We need to tire her some more so that the escape is a challenge to her and, what tires you more than� torture?� Sweat from Snoop Dogg began to play while the girls danced to it around the exhausted superheroine who was contorting herself on the stage, holding her hands clutched together lest they would do some irreparable mistake. They all were kissing and caressing the superheroine's nude and firm breasts, giving the audience some clues about what part of her they were going to torture�
Belinda continued talking: �Now Christina and Jennifer are carrying each a 30 pounds weight which we will hang from each Super-Woman nipple with these strong metal pegs. Consider she is the mightiest heroine, we have to think big when torturing her, otherwise she would not feel anything�
The girls seemed to gently help Super-Woman standing up but it was just so that she suffered more when her breasts were carrying the weights. Firstly they applied a peg to each nipple, causing her to scream into her gag. Indeed, the pegs were actually as strong a car battery jumpers. Then they attached a big weight to each; automatically, Super-Woman leaned forward, pulled by the cruel yank, but she was immediately stopped and held straight by the girls. Unexpectedly the expoiled breasts were still looking firm in spite of the huge weights that hung from them.
Belinda approached her and kissing her tits said �My god, after this beating these two look this great!! We have to keep challenging this girl to see what her limits are. Bring the squashers!!� The audience could see Maria and Jennifer bringing each a very simple device: it consisted of two metal planks with a crank on one side. �This devices are very simple when cranking, the two planks will approach each other squashing what&#8217;s inside. (smiling) In this case a superheroine breast will be inside.�
Of course, Super-Woman could not see the evil devices but the description she heard made her shiver with fear. Belinda realized it, and did not hesitate to make fun of the captive heroine �Hey, look, she is not so fearless after all�� People laughed very loud. They loved to see the once cocky heroine, devastated.
Maria held both Super-Woman&#8217;s breasts while Jennifer and Christina placed the squashers and started cranking. The steel began to squeeze the base of her boobs, crushing the glands underneath and causing almost immediately unbearable pain that spread to her whole chest. Still the assistants kept tightening the planks, forcing her areolae to bulge out as tit meat was pushed forward against her extra-taut skin. As always when everyone thought that an enormous suffering was provided to the captive blonde, Belinda asked for something more. The girls put all their effort into cranking and managed to give two more turns. In the end, Super-Woman magnificent breasts were transformed into some incredibly squashed, red, painful pieces of flesh with a huge weight hanging from each.
Belinda said with a big smile while showing her cleavage �That&#8217;s better girls, I always love to be the girl with the best boobs in a party.� People laughed aloud.
Belinda was so proud of what had she had done but she was kind of frustrated because Super-Woman had not yet interfered with the bondage in spite of having her arms totally free. Anyway, she hoped that, at least her energy was totally drained.

Final bondage
When that last torture ended Super-Woman had really succeeded in enduring and not resisting any of the pain that Belinda had applied to her. The bad side was that she was not only hyperventilating but was totally destroyed and wasted, Christina got her up as offering it to the audience as some kind of ritual sacrifice. She was sueding a lot with her legs very weak, bent, practically unable to stand. The crowd was very happy, Super-Woman was so tired, totally destroyed; it would be impossible for her to escape even the weakest device in this condition. She was hopeless to front the top-tier lethal devices that Belinda had prepared for her to overcome.
The music ended and Belinda grabbed the microphone again and, after waiting for the crowd to finish their cheering said: �OK, SuperSlut I think it was a good warming up. Now, get ready for the big test�
Laughs and shouts followed. Then Belinda went on talking to the helpless hooded figure: �When something works you should not changed it and that&#8217;s what we did with your arms restraints, we just improved it a little more. We have seen that you were unable to get out of them but it is true that some of them were a little bit chapped so we worked with the Safe Hard Engineers to develop this even stronger handcuffs. As they are going to impede your survival we decided to paint them green like Kryptonite. It was a pity that we were not allowed to use it but you are going to die anyway��
The crowd could see the assistants coming from the backstage with the seven green handcuffs. The picture was so terrifying: three women dressed as executioners sending another nude woman with a hood, so weak, almost unconscious, directly to death. Even though she was so feeble then, the executioners were given their best tying that poor captive woman. Belinda knew her plan was working when she saw that Super-Woman was not clenching her muscles to win some slack, now the seven handcuffs were as tight as her captors wanted; she was so busy recovering from the bondage all around her body and the unbelievable torturing received. Each girl pressed each ring of each hancuff until they hit bone. Super-Woman&#8217;s mind was somewhere else, but she should be thinking how she was going to get out of this snug predicament.
�You were very witty to tear with your nails the pouch where we put your hands in� That&#8217;s why we had to develop this restraint�: it was like two metal boxing gloves welded together with their inside made of very strong fabric... �in addition we will have to put each of your fingers into a plastic tube so that they are not sharp anymore. Even if they were, they would have to cut through steel and that&#8217;s too much even for you, superbitch!� People loved this
Jennifer was holding her, while her colleagues were doing all the arm-binding, once finished, she released her. As the assistants let go of her arms, Super-Woman was unable to support herself and she collapsed on the floor, barely managing at the last second to roll on her side to avoid landing over her cruelly squashed boobs. She could not escape the brutal yanking the weights inflicted to her throbbing nipples.
�Don&#8217;t worry, whore, we can apply the arm-strap binder while you are on the ground� And Mar�a closed it very tightly around her arms from her �boxing gloves� until her shoulders, removed the air and tightened it some more with chains with and padlocks. Then she broke the padlocks keyholes and blocked the zip. Everything was sealed. Those arms would remain motionless for a long time.
Super-Woman was so quiet laying on the floor, maybe because she was dizzy and exhausted or maybe because she wanted to seem open to any predicament Belinda wished to apply to her. Lying on the floor nude and helpless let the four villains to pose mocking her like she was some kind of hunted animal, to the huge amusement of the crowd.
Belinda kneeled down and kissed the superheroine nude ass while caressing her legs: �those legs need to be taken care of� Ladies, do you have something for them?� 
�We have been thinking of a hogtie, what do you think, boss??� And they showed some chains and shackles that they were holding.
�It&#8217;s ok for me, what does our audience think?�
The crowd went wild and erupted a great ovation
Belinda shouted: �Ok girls, hogtie our host but remember that she is no ordinary woman, she is our favourite super-heroine!!�
�Yes boss!!�
The three assistants surrounded Super-Woman following their �executioner acting� in a very rude way, Maria took a very strong and broad chain with a steel collar at one end and two shackles at the other end. She put the collar and fit it very tightly around her neck then Jennifer and Christina each grabbed a leg and pulled them both towards Super-Woman&#8217;s head and shackled them. The audience felt pity for all the pain Super-Woman would have been feeling in that position. Anyway, Belinda grabbed the microphone and said: �come on!! We all know she is more flexible than that!! This is a challenge!! Put her to the test!! 
The three girls came back to the suffering heroine with a much smaller chain. To straighten her more, they put a foot on the small of her back to get more leverage and Jennifer and Christina pulled with all their combined strength. Working this way they were not able to flex her enough to fit the short chain they had brought so Belinda decided to help. They first secured the neck collar and then Jennifer and Belinda pulled her left leg and Christina and Maria pulled her right leg with all their strength making grunts of effort and getting their faces red. Belinda and Jennifer made it and shackled her left leg to the hogtie. Christina and Maria were not able to bend that much Super-Woman&#8217;s leg so the four girls got to it and finally shackled the superheroine right leg into the devious device. The audience thanked their huge effort with a great ovation and the girls did a high five.
The crowd wowed with what the girls had done: only four links joint her neck shackle with their feet shackles. Super-Woman was living quite a nightmare her body was in a great tension from being stretched to the maximum, the assistants set aside, turned off some lights and left her under the only spotlight you could see her body trembling and sueding. The hogtie not only tensioned her body and gave her a lot of pain but also, whenever she could not bear it anymore and unbend her legs, she would choke herself. She was very tired but was somehow recovering from the torture; anyway the extreme hogtie she was suffering and the monstrous dildo were doing a great job destroying her. They made sure these shackles were really tight and secured and told her boss that the escape artist was ready to face death.
The broadcasting cameras moved around the powerless superheroine while the reporters assured this was the end of Super-Woman. There was no way she could get out of that. That made the bets on the death of Super-Woman rise upto 90%. People at home and the audience at the big screens could see the 360� view of her magnificent body tightly bound and hooded. The cameraman stopped a while at her back so that everybody could see her legs in tension and her vagina where you could see the enormous dildo tightly fit vibrating inside her.
Belinda now approached the helpless superheroine and told her while facing the audience at the same time: �Well Super-Woman, now the spotlight is on you. It&#8217;s time to prove the world that you can survive this. If you die you will always be remembered as a cocky slut. Nothing else.�
Then the three assistants approach the bound superheroine and Belinda got to her place as a presenter and shouted: �Let&#8217;s start with the challenge!! and (Du Hast by Rammstein started playing )
�As Safe Hard has been collaborating with us since the beginning we decided that it was very well deserved to give them the honour to kill Super-Woman, so, what could be better to finish her stupid life than inside a safe?� Crowd went wild!!
�The safe will be closed and sealed so there will be no air coming from the outside. Super-Woman, in her situation will have more or less 25 minutes. To make sure she dies if she does not leave her imprisonment, we are going to drop the safe into this swimming pool (a trap opened in the floor and the crowd could see it). We should add that the safe is the best creation from Safe Hard and they believe that if we would have put Super-Woman inside with no torture and no binding her life would still be in danger anyway. They do not know how to escape it. I do not trust them that much so my girls will add some very hard chains around the safe with strong padlocks. Ok girls, let&#8217;s get to work�
The safe was casket-shaped and lied next to the pool; very coherent with the intention of the show. Jennifer opened the safe with a passcode and then Maria and Christina tried to remove the lid but it was impossible for them, it weighed too much. �We would need a Super-Woman to seal Super-Woman inside it� and smiled. A truck with a hoist came on stage and tried to remove the lid, surprisingly it was not an easy task even for the expert machinery, the lid weighed several tons, it was made out of some special kind of metal, unbreakable according to Safe Hard. That company was putting all their reputation at stake, Super-Woman had to die.
The truck lifted the lid and then released it on the stage with a loud bang. The assistants got Super-Woman and laid her inside on her belly. The safe was just a little bit bigger than an actual casket.
Belinda took the mic and put her most serious face: �What you have just seen was, for sure, the greatest challenge for an escape artist ever, it would mean certain death to any magician trying to escape from it and it does mean almost certain death to Super-Woman. She wanted to prove the World she was invincible and she may prove it or die. Just to understand what a great feat this would be for this currently helpless superheroine, let me recapitulate what her present ordeal consists of: we tied her up with so many chains and handcuffs, then we stretched her to her limits, we tortured her unbelievably and we are going to put her now into an inescapable cell. Getting out of that would be quite a feat!! But� on top of that she&#8217;s suffering from the greatest vibrator ever used. Imagine feeling orgams after orgasm but not of pleasure but of huge pain. Would you be able to do anything?? Would you be able to front that unbelievable feat?? We will get the answer in a few minutes (looking at her) Super-Woman you may be the greatest escape artist ever or a dead heroine. God bless you.�
The music was turned up, the truck picked up the lid and covered the safe again. Then many locks were activated and the safe was sealed then the girls got some chain and wrapped the coffin up and down and right and left until they ran out of chain, then they locked everything with a huge padlock that rested on top of the casket. Four more locks were placed among the chains. Finally, the truck pushed the safe into the pool where it immediately sank to the bottom.

The escape
Super-Woman was positively scared. The vibrator was destroying her vagina and plunging her in a haze of agony that prevented her to focus her mind on the problem at hand. Her breasts were torturing her as well and she was only glad that the way her body was severely arched by the hogtie, she was not resting her weight on them. Still, in the midst of her agony, over the mad buzzing of the dildo that was propagating to her inner ear through her skeleton, she had heard the safe locking mechanisms work, and then the rattling of the chain against the external hull of her prison. Then a loud bang and a jerk, then nothing but that mind-grinding buzz. It was going to drive her mad.
Her arched, naked body was covered with sweat. Her belly was concave and hardly breathing because of the gag, the hood and the rarefying atmosphere around her. Still, her powerful muscles kept rolling and bulging under her skin as she fought the unyielding restraints that had been layered upon her. Her main effort was to pull on her back muscle every now and then to relieve a bit of the pressure on her throat, allowing her to suck some air into her burning lungs.
A few minutes passed without her doing much. She felt like a drill was rotating inside her sex, wrenching her bowels in compact, torturous knots. She could not think of anything else as it was draining all her energy. She felt she was getting crazy with the infernal pain. She was uselessly clenching her fists inside the heavy steel mitten, as if she could reach the dildo and turn it off.
Then an idea began to emerge in her pain-soaked brains. The dildo. She had to turn it off! She had to! It acted like kryptonite, highjacking all her energy from her. Fortunately, her arms had not been secured to her back. She could contort them a bit, even lift them off her back for short amount of times. She did that, and then let the heavy steel boxing gloves land upon her butt. Yes! There was hope! She tried to part her legs a little bit, until her knees touched the sides of her coffin and then did it again. The heavy mitten crashed on the bottom of her buttocks, heavily, painfully. It also banged her lower belly against the floor. She felt the vibrator jerk inside her, causing a surge of agony. That meant her idea could work. Belinda had made those gloves too heavy. She could now use them as weapons. Weapons she directed at her own body but she knew that she was much more resistant than this dildo.
Thus she continued to pound her butt with her weighed gloves. Each heavy punch caused more pain to her vagina as the dildo was squeezed harder inside but she ignored it. Her mind was entirely focused on escaping the maddening pain it caused by its infernal vibration. After a dozen of bangs she began to feel that something was begin to change in the evil device. It did not vibrate quite in the same way. The motor had been affected by the constant banging of the boxing gloves. She continued. More punches to her own butt, slowly crushing the mechanisms inside the monstrous vibrator. Every now and then she had to stop to rest her arms and get some air. But at last the dildo got completely jammed and it stopped to work.
She let out a sigh of relief through her nose. The silence was now total around her, except for her heart pounding hard inside her heaving chest. She accorded herself some time to recover and calm down. It was now easier to think. The pain in her tortured breasts was tremendous, but it was nothing like the vibrating dildo. The evil way her spine had been curled in tight circle was awful as well. Her vertebrae were grinding against each other and, had her bones not been harder than steel, could have threatened to snap apart. The intense pressure of the collar against her throat was disagreeable and was cutting her breathing, but that was something she could deal with. She thought about her bondage, her position, analysing it to find any weakness.
And she found one! Once again Belinda had been too eager to torture her, ending up providing her with a way to release herself. Or so Super-Woman hoped, at least. The hogtie was strict indeed but still it left some freedom to her legs, and in particular to her feet. It was strange that Belinda had gone overboard to secure her arms and hands while restraining her legs with only a pair of shackles.
Super-Woman took as deep a breath as she could and then reached with her toes to the back of her hood. She was curled back so strenuously that her feet were already almost touching her head. She explored the hood with her toes and soles, building a mental image of it. She found the padlock, which attached together four straps that were keeping the hood tight on her face. She ignored it though and concentrated on grabbing one of the straps with her toes. Where the four straps met there was a bit of room between them and the hood proper, enough that she could push her toe under and then she grabbed and pulled.
Super-Woman's feet were as strong as any other bit of her body. Tearing a strap apart was no great feat to someone who could lift and throw a car as though it were a mere suitcase. The difficulty came from getting a good hold. It was tricky because she could not get a good grip and her toes were slippery with sweat. She failed several times, the strap sliding from her grasp. Then she got at last a good angle of attack, a strong grip and it was only a matter of pulling. She heard the seams tear apart and the hood slackened somewhat. Being done with that strap, she moved to the opposite one. It was now easier to get a good grip, thanks to the additional slackness. Tearing that strap off happened faster. The two last ones were done in a few seconds, leaving the hood as loose as a bag over Super-Woman's head.
She shook her head violently and rubbed the hood against her soles, forcing it up her face until it fell on the bottom of the steel coffin. Her face was red and puffy and covered in sweat and saliva. The gag seemed monstrous, stretching her lips so thin and spreading her jaws so wide.
It was dark inside the safe but it did not hindered her night vision. She saw around her almost as clearly than in full light. The first thing she did was to focus her eye-lasers on the devices that were flattening her breasts and clamping her nipples. They too fell on the floor with a rattling sound. As blood rushed back into the martyred flesh pain skyrocketed and she moaned more loudly in her pear gag.
As the pain from her abused boobs lessened, others began to hit her mind. It was like unfolding a multi-layered pack: Each layer gone revealed a new one. In this case, Super-woman's incredibly bent spine began to be felt. Would the torture never end? She tried to pull on her legs to break the chain that was linking her ankles to her neck but she had little leverage that way and almost no muscles arrayed to pull in that direction. Moreover, she was pulling right at her throat, which caused its own kind of pain. For a moment she oscillated on her hips, her muscles rippling under her sweaty skin as she tried to break free from the remaining restraints.
During one of those oscillations, as she helplessly contorted her arms, her steel gloves got stuck in between her shins. As she fought to free them an idea came to her mind. She might use the strength in her legs to break the shackles attached to those gloves?
Immediately she set herself to that task. She lifted her hands as high as she could, wedging them between her lower legs towards her feet. Then she began to squeeze them together, hardening the muscles in her calves, using them like steel vice-grips. In the confined space the shackles began to creak and groan and suddenly they snapped apart. Super-Woman shook her hands and slowly worked her hands out of the heavy gloves, which landed on the floor with a loud noise. She then repeated the same operation with the next handcuffs, crushing them between her lower legs until they broke apart. Once there only remained two pairs, close to her elbows, she pulled hard on her arms, struggling to separate them. Her biceps and deltoids bulged and suddenly the cuffs snapped apart. Her arms were free.
Her first action was to support her torso so as to get at last a full lungful of air. Alas, by now the oxygen had been so much depleted that it did not bring the relief she had hoped for. She then turned to remove her remaining restraints. Reaching behind her head, she easily broke the chain that led from her feet to her neck. At last she was able to straighten her back. It was aching so much that she had to uncurl herself slowly so that each vertebra came back in place without too much grinding against its neighbour. Once she was lying on the bottom of the coffin she felt much better. The next thing to go was the vicious pear-gag. She finished by extracting the humongous dildo out of her vagina. This was a lengthy and painful process, but one which brought a great relief.
By then the air in the safe was almost pure carbon dioxide. Super-Woman had been living on her reserves for several minutes and she was beginning to feel her head aching and her vision blurring. She had to get out of this cell fast.
Her first attempt was to fly and push the safe with her. Thanks to the buoyancy, she was able to lift it to the surface of the pool but then, without Archimede to help her, she could not get much higher.She let if fall, and her with it. It crashed hard on the bottom of the tank and the impact of its own weight destroyed the chains that had been wrapped around it. She repeated it twice more, each time jarring the door a little more. Water began to pour inside the coffin. However, by now, the door had been jarred just enough that Super-Woman could see the bolts. There were several of them, all around the door. She focused her eye-lasers on each of them in succession until she could swing the door open and at last swim to the surface of the pool and get on stage.
She was panting and coughing hard, she was drenched and looked like a soaked cat, but she was free!
There was some seconds of silence partly because nobody thought she would have made it and partly because she was so hot, nude and wet kneeled in the middle of the stage, then a great ovation from the crowd erupted. Belinda was also in shock and took her some minutes to react; disguising her disappointment with some fake admiration came to Superwoman with a towel and hugged her to shout them to the crowd �the great Superwoman has made it!!�
This is when Superwoman told her �Sorry, Belinda, you are going to jail� and policeman took the stage and handcuffed Belinda �Thanks Superwoman, if Belinda would not be so busy preparing this show she would have destroyed the evidence that we now have to put her into jail�
Belinda clearly understood that, in the end, it was her the one tricked, she lowered her head in frustration and to avoid seeing Superwoman mocking smile.
Now the audience was so confused, they did not understand anything, anyway, they enjoyed the show so much so a huge standing ovation follow and Superwoman saluted back and left the arena.
