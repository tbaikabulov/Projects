Synopsis: she is ready and waiting for him, to do what he wants. she wants it too.






She kneels as she waits, quietly, completely still; her body barely rises with breath. The black sheet is smooth and slippery beneath her bare legs, as soft and velvety as the red rose petals surrounding her. The thorns of those roses contrast sharply with the delicate softness; the blood red of the petals contrasts sharply with her pale flesh. Her legs folded under, her torso bound tight is a sleek black corset, head down, her arms tied firmly behind her back, hair piled loosely at the nape of her neck; she calmly waits. 

Finally she hears a noise and glances towards the door&#8212;carefully moving only her dark eyes. She sees him standing there, a silhouette by the doorway. He&#8217;s coming for her. Seeing his bright eyes staring straight into her nearly makes her pant. He smiles widely and walks towards the kneeling girl, reaching out with his delicate hands to tenderly brush her cheek. His fingers trace the lines of her face, from temple to jaw, then following the curve of her throat to her collar bones, then around the back of her neck. With a sharp jerk her pulls free her wavy hair; it cascades down her back, strands of gold shining brightly in the mass of pale brown. 

Winding that hair around his beautiful hands he yanks it down, forcing her to look up into his clear bright eyes. The pain of it compels her to let loose a short gasp, leaving her red lips parted for his crushing kiss. His lips crush into hers; at first the kiss is so sharp her teeth nearly slice the inside of her lips. Then he pulls back and gently, slowly, dances his mouth on, in, hers. Releasing her mouth, letting fall her hair, he shoves her down onto the bed of roses. The thorns prick her pale skin, leaving little dots of red as bright as the rose petals.

He tells her to lie still and begins to pull off his clothes. His flesh is nearly as pale as hers, and just as smooth. His slender body fits hers perfectly. Grabbing another silken cord he lashes one of her ankles firmly to the bedpost, leaving the other free. He kneels down beside her, careful to stay clear of the thorns, and gently strokes her body. His phallus grows, the mere sight of her bound and wanting him is overwhelmingly arousing. She opens her mouth to take him in as he wants, stroking him with her tongue. After some minutes he pulls back, and presses her shoulders sharply into the thorned roses. Gasping again she looks up into his eyes, begging. With one hand he strokes down the length of her body&#8212;still tightly bound by the corset&#8212;and reaches between her legs. His fingers wet from her fluid he strokes her clitoris, filling her with nearly unbearable sensation, she fights against her bindings until finally he plunges into her.

But when she stops struggling he also stops. Painfully slow, he pulls out of her and rises to his feet. The cabinet doors are pulled open to reveal countless pleasurable toys. With his back to her he first reaches for a soft doe skin flogger, but changes his mind--the flogger is too inexact, too violent. Instead his delicate fingers wrap around the pinwheel's slender handle. The sharp little spiked wheel is exactly what he wants, exactly what she needs. He turns and walks back to the bound woman waiting for him, tells her to remain perfectly still. 

He lightly rolls the spiked wheel over the mounds of her cleavage, so lightly it is barely more than a tickle. With one hand he unfastens the painfully tight corset, the other traces the path of the first with the pin wheel. Once her breasts are free he leans down and takes one perked nipple into his mouth. He circles his tongue and then bites down, hard, forcing a little gasp to escape her swollen lips. He lightly rolls it over her sturnum, increasing the pressure as he reaches her flat stomach. As it begins to prick her skin the sharp points of pain send bolts of warmth throughout her body. She tries to stay still, but the pleasure those sharp little pricks makes her writhe with uncontrolable little jerks. He frowns down at her, drops the pin wheel and presses her back down on the rose thorns, and then yanks her up to her knees.

Her mouth opens with a gasp, as he wanted. He forces her lips to part even further and then shoves himself in. His hand forces her head to remain still as he violently pumps himself in her mouth, so deeply she cannot stop gagging. He comes nearly to climax, then stops abruptly. He pushes her, face down onto the rose covered black sheet. Sharp little thorns raise drops of bright blood on her pale breasts and stomach. With her leg still bound to the bed and her arms tied behind her back she cannot move or rise to relieve the pressure of the thorns.

She does not notice his absence until he returns and she feels the sharp bite of the flogger as it snaps against her buttocks. He whips her mercilessly, raising long pink welts on her thorn pricked skin. She jerks with each snap, her world melting away to the intense pleasure of it. Eventually he stops, the cessation of pain confuses her for a moment. Then she gasps as his hand finds her clitoris. He rubs and dances his delicate fingers over her most sensitive spot. The pressure builds, climbs to more and more intense heights till it seems ready to burst. He stops then, not yet allowing the release she so desires.

His long slender fingers wrap around her thighs, forcing them further apart. Then he shoves his full length inside her. Losing all tenderness he thrusts, forming a rhythm, building in speed and force. It hurts her more than a little, but that just makes it so much more pleasurable. His nails scrape against the flesh of her bare back as she whrithes beneath him. Her writhing increases his pleasure, increases his tempo and force until finally she can feel the warm spurts of him coming inside her.��He collapses on top of her, but quickly recovers and turns her over to lay on her back once more.

He begins working his mouth on her body. Starting at her neck, licking, sucking and biting. He takes a nipple into his mouth again, and then heads lower. He sucks the sensitive area next to her protruding hip bones. Then he glances up at her before lowering his face between her parted thighs. He licks and sucks until she feels she can bare no more of this intense feeling. He does not stop, but just continues working at her until, finally, her mucsles tense and she begins to pulse with the intense orgasm shaking its way through her entire body.
