Pleasing Nathan

&nbsp;

I was sick of everything about Curtis
Springs, the people, my lousy job working at the local caf� and most of all my
step dad.� Not that he was a bad guy, but
since my Mum had died four years ago, he just didn�t do much of anything anymore.� I had stayed around because of him long after
my friends had moved on to other places but I had just turned twenty and knew I
had to get away.

&nbsp;

I quit my job and just told him I was
going. He didn�t try to stop me, just gave me some money and told me to ring
him every now and then.� Part of me felt
insulted that he hadn�t tried to stop me but on the other hand I could now
start to live my life.

&nbsp;

I was waiting for the bus when I first saw
him.� He drove up in a black car and just
stared at me, my pussy moistening as I too stared back. I couldn�t describe
what I was feeling as he got out of the car, his lean body dressed in black �
boots, jeans and t-shirt and his hair just completed the image. When he opened
the door for me and picked up my bag, I just couldn�t help but get into his
car. I was vaguely aware of my bag being placed on the back seat and then he
slide back into the car and drove off.

&nbsp;

If I was dreaming I didn�t want to wake up,
my whole body just tingling with anticipation and something else I couldn�t
name.�� He turned to me and spoke for the
first time, his voice as beautiful as he was.�
�Where are you headed?�� It was
the same question I had asked myself everyday for the last year or so, but for
once I had an answer. �Anywhere you are going?��
He raised an eyebrow and then smiled at me, a smile so sensuous I almost
came on the spot.� I was not normally so
forward, but it just seemed like the only thing to say.� 

&nbsp;

His hand came to rest on my thigh and I
didn�t stop him as he pulled my skirt up my leg. He gave me another smile as he
rubbed my thigh, my breath becoming short until he pulled his hand away. It was
all I could do not to moan and ask him to put his hand back. �What is your
name?�� I was jolted back to reality.
�Julie, my name is Julie.�� Somehow
telling him my name made things more real but I still had no desire to be
anywhere but beside him. 

&nbsp;

�I�m Nathan. Julie, I want you to take off
your panties for me.�� I hesitated only a
moment, before raising my bottom off the seat and lowering my g-string to the
floor.� He held out his hands for them
and smelt them once before putting them into his pocket.� Normally his behaviour would have creeped me
out but I only felt more and more turned on. 

&nbsp;

�Good girl, now I want you to pull your
skirt right up, that�s it and spread your legs for me,� There had been no
hesitation this time, and as I felt the air on my already soaked pussy, I felt
alive. �I want you play with yourself but you�re not allowed to cum. If you
feel yourself getting close, you will take your hand away for a while.�� 

&nbsp;

I did as he asked, excited by what he
wanted me to do.� I looked down and
rubbed along my already puffy slit a few times before pushing two fingers
easily into my pussy. �Look at me while you play with yourself.� �I looked at him, taking in his strong jaw and
his large hands on the steering wheel.�
Longing for him to touch me, I almost came but pulled out at the last
minute, my breathing ragged.� 

&nbsp;

�Let me taste you.� I brought the hand that
had been inside me up to his lips and thought I would cum with just the feel of
his mouth on my fingers. He sucked them in and the ran his tongue up and down
each finger before letting me pull them free.�
�Taste yourself.�� I dipped my
fingers into me and brought my hand up to my mouth, tasting my own sweet juices
just as he pulled off the road to a rest stop surrounded by trees.

&nbsp;

I stayed quiet and still as he got out and
walked around to open my door. When I went to lower my skirt he slapped my
hands away and I left it where it was as I stood up.� We were alone and by the looks of the place,
no one had been here for a long time.�
Without a word, he pulled my top up and removed my bra, taking in his
breath as he looked at my body. I had always been proud of my body and had been
told I looked just like my Mum had when she was younger.� The only difference was that she had been a
blonde and I had always been a brunette. 

&nbsp;

�I
gasped as his hands roamed all over my breasts before he roughly turned me
around and pushed me over the bonnet of the car.� It was warm and I tried to pull up, but then
his hand was in me and I forgot all about my own discomfort as he worked his
fingers in and out of me.� I heard a zipper
and tried to turn around to see what his cock looked like but he held me firm
with a hand on my back.� 

&nbsp;

I thought he would never end as he pushed
in what felt like the biggest cock I had ever felt, not that I had a lot to
compare it to. In fact I knew that I was inexperienced for my age, but when all
the decent guys leave after high school, you don�t have many opportunities to
expand your horizons.� He sped up and I
felt him grip my hair, making me look up. 

&nbsp;

My nipples were rubbing on the top of the
car and felt like so hard I thought I must be scratching the paint.� The grunts coming out of my mouth echoed
around me and I wondered if anyone else could hear us.� When he suddenly pulled out and spun me
around, I didn�t know what had happened, only that I had been so close to
cumming.� I was pushed down to my knees,
the pebbles rough under me and his cock was pushed into my mouth.� 

&nbsp;

I gagged as he pushed it down my throat and
held it there, his cum spurting straight down into my stomach. He allowed me
some air and I gasped a deep breath before he pushed down even further and
finished cumming in me.� I longed for him
to just touch me once and went to bring my hands down, only to find he was
holding them together behind my back.� I
was just starting to need more air, when he pulled out so that his cock was
just resting on my tongue. �Julie, you are not to make yourself cum.� I will let you cum later, if you continue to
be a good girl.�� I could only nod at
this man who had come into my life in such a way that I felt like I couldn�t
refuse him anything he asked. 

&nbsp;

He did allow me to lower my skirt and to
put my top back on, but kept the bra.� I
felt so alive and so much like a woman, my pussy still tingling with need.
Moaning as I sat down again, I wondered when he would allow me to cum.� We drove on, the music the only sound in the
car.� He would at times tell me to play
with myself, either pinching my nipples and rubbing along my slit, but still
would not let me cum.

&nbsp;

�By
the time it was getting dark and I was getting more and more frustrated, he
pulled into a motel.� I tried to sit patiently
as he got us a room and unpacked the car.�
Finally we were inside but he didn�t rush me liked I had hoped he would,
but instead played with the TV and then rang up and ordered us some food.� I didn�t even notice what he ordered, my
hunger nothing in comparison to my need to cum.�


&nbsp;

�I�m having a shower. Be a dear and answer
the door for the food when it comes. Oh and Julie, make sure you are naked when
you answer the door.� He didn�t give me time to reply as he had already turned
on the shower, his beautiful body being exposed to me bit by bit as he
undressed in the doorway and then stepped into the shower.� I stood and watched him through the dappled
glass screen, almost forgetting what I had been asked to do. I didn�t think of
anything but pleasing him as I took off my skirt and top.� 

&nbsp;

After about five minutes there was a knock
on the door and I answered to see a young man standing with his mouth
open.� I had to resist the urge to giggle
as he struggled to talk till he gave up and just moved past me to put the tray
of food on the bench. I hadn�t noticed that Nathan had finished his shower and
jumped at his deep voice. �Thank you son.�
Do you like my girl here?�� 

&nbsp;

I turned to see Nathan with one hand on the
teenager�s shoulder. He was only wearing a towel and I just wanted the kid to
go so I could get to what was underneath.�
My being naked did not seem to worry me but I could see it was affecting
the teenager, the bulge in his pants growing bigger the longer he stood and
stared.� 

&nbsp;

�Would you like to touch her?� For the
first time since I had stepped into his car and his world, I felt
uncomfortable. It was one thing to give the kid a thrill but the thought of
being touched by him didn�t feel right.�
�Julie has tried very hard all day to please me and I know she would let
you touch her because it would please me.� I sighed, knowing he was right and I
would do anything to please him. 

&nbsp;

�Yes, if you want to touch me you
can.�� I moved closer to the teenager and
brought his hand up to my breast, hoping a quick grope would satisfy both of
the them. Nathan seemed to have other ideas though as he undid the kid�s belt
and the zip on his jeans, and then finally pulled his cock out for him.� Nathan then brought one of my hands down to
grip it and the hand on my breast squeezed me painfully as I began to jerk him
off. 

&nbsp;

Nathan moved away as I continued, the hands
on my breasts now opening and closing in rhythm to the motion of my hand. I
knew he was close to coming when he closed his eyes and started to moan deeply,
my breasts squeezed in a grip much stronger than I would have thought possible
from his slight build. I felt the sticky goo hit my hand and run into my palm
as I continued to rub his cock until he was spent.� He let go of my breasts and almost ran from the
room, the door slamming shut behind him. 

&nbsp;

I went to go into the bathroom to wash my
hand. �Hey, where do you think you�re going?��
About to turn around to tell him he had gone too far, I was stopped in
my tracks as he bent me over and pushed his cock into my pussy.� He powered into me and if he wasn�t holding
me up I am sure I would have landed in a heap on the floor.� It didn�t take long before I was rocked by an
orgasm that left me weak and gasping for air. He pulled out and I felt his cum
spurt all over my back.� When he was
done, he let go and pushed me toward the bathroom. �Now you can go wash
up.�� 

&nbsp;

I was too stunned to say anything and had
my shower in what felt like a daze. When I came out, Nathan had the food laid
out on the bed and held out a glass of wine.�
Suddenly I felt embarrassed by all that had happened and felt like I
wanted to hide. He put the glass down on the table and taking my hand, led me
to sit on the bed. �Julie, I hope I didn�t push things too far before but there
just seems to be a connection between us.�
If you want to leave, then I won�t stop you but I really like you and it
would make me happy if you stay.�� It was
the most he had said all day and I felt myself melting into his eyes. 

&nbsp;

�Sorry, I just got a little embarrassed but
I have to say that this has been the most exciting day I have ever had and I
don�t want to leave.� After that we ate in silence, the food tasting wonderful
and I again wondered at how this amazing, sexy man had come into my life.� Later, we cuddled up in bed watching a movie,
my eyes growing weary as I rolled over onto my back.� I was just drifting off to sleep when I
felt� my arms being moved over my head
and then something soft was tied around them. Opening my eyes in surprise, I
tried to pull my hands down but found they were held in place, though there was
no pain.� 

&nbsp;

�It�s ok Julie, I was just thinking how
beautiful you would look with your hands tied.�
If you want I can undo it but it would really make me happy if you would
be willing to stay that way overnight�� I
wasn�t so sure but I really did want to please him, plus he had provided me
with a meal and a place to sleep.� I
nodded, thinking it would be interesting to experience what it would be like.
�Good girl, I knew as soon as I saw you that you would be my kind of
girl.�� I drifted off to sleep, testing
the feel of my tied hands once more, hoping I had not made the biggest mistake
of my life.

&nbsp;

Chapter 2

&nbsp;

I woke early and tried to stretch my arms
above my head, before I remembered the way Nathan had tied my hands the night
before.� I wriggled my hands, pleased
that there was no pain but eager to be free so I could go to the toilet. Trying
to ignore my full bladder by thinking about the previous day I only managed to
make my pussy wet.� 

&nbsp;

Eventually I knew I would have to wake
Nathan up and tried to nudge him with my foot. That didn�t seem to make any
difference, so I started by calling his name softly.� I got louder until he moaned in annoyance and
turned to look at me, the darkness in his eyes taking me by surprise.� �What the fuck are you making all this fuss
for?�� I could feel tears come to my eyes
at the tone of his voice and shrank away from him.� His face softened and he stroked my face, my
heart thumping as I thought of how little I really knew him.� �Julie, forgive me. I just don�t respond well
to being woken up. Now how can I help you?� 

&nbsp;

�Please, I need to go the toilet and can�t
with my hands tied.�� It was humbling to
have to ask for something so basic and I could feel a blush cover my face.� I was still upset by the way he had spoken
and wondered what I would do if he said no.

&nbsp;

�Of course, I wasn�t thinking.�� He gently untied my hands and I could see
that he had used what looked like a scarf.�
Wondering where he had found it, I stretched and headed off to the
bathroom.� By the time I had returned,
Nathan was up and had made me a cup of tea.�
He patted the seat beside him but I needed a bit of distance, so I sat
down on the bed instead.� He sighed but
didn�t make a fuss. 

&nbsp;

�Julie, I hope I have not blown what I
think has the potential to be a good thing. Do you want to go on your own way
or are you willing to stay with me?�� It
was exactly what I had been thinking and had come out ready to tell him I was
going to catch the bus but one look at him had made me change my mind. 

&nbsp;

�He
was the only man who had ever stirred up the emotions I had experienced
yesterday and though he had a dangerous edge to him, I decided I wasn�t yet
ready to turn my back on him. �Nathan, I have to admit to being a bit freaked
out before, but if it is ok with you, I want to travel with you some more.� 

&nbsp;

Now I had said it, he stood up and looked
around for my bag, putting it on the bed beside me. �Show me what you have to
wear today so I can see if we need to go shopping or not.�� I pulled out my jeans, two denim skirts and a
range of T-shirts.� He put all except one
t-shirt to the side and placed it along with the shorter of the skirts on the
bed.� 

&nbsp;

I went to take out my underwear but he just
shook his head. �Julie, while you are travelling with me, you will not need
underwear.� He gave me a look that told me there would be no arguing and I
thought about how it had felt so sexy yesterday.� �Here put these on and then we can decide how
to make it look better.�� I pulled on my
skirt first and then the t-shirt.� 

&nbsp;

�Ok, we just need to tie it in the front
like this.�� I looked down to see him
knotting my shirt in the front so that he bared my stomach and then ripped the
collar of the shirt down the middle, tucking the flaps under, so that it looked
like a v-neck.� He reached into the shirt
and pinched each nipple until they were standing up firmly, standing back with
a satisfied look on his face.

&nbsp;

��Not
perfect, but much better. Go and have a look and then we can grab some
breakfast.�� The girl I saw staring back
at me was not the Julie I was used to seeing but a much sexier version.� You could see my nipples standing out through
the thin material as well as half of my breasts from where he had torn the
material. I had to admit it was sexy but I had never gone out wearing anything
so skimpy before. 

&nbsp;

Nathan appeared behind me, his jeans almost
moulded to his hips, and ran his hands back down the top of my shirt. It was
the first time I had seen us together and the vision combined with his hands on
my breasts, made me forget about my concerns.

�We had better go and eat or you won�t be
going anywhere.�� I was flattered to
think he found me so attractive and wanted me again, but I was also feeling
hungry, so was pleased when he let go and we headed over to a caf� across the
road.

&nbsp;

The first sign that I was causing some
attention was when a car drove by and I heard someone whistle.� Then everyone seemed to stop talking as we
entered the caf�, some people shaking their heads in disgust while most of the
guys just openly stared. I was glad Nathan had his arm around me but I had not
noticed how far his hand was on my breast until he touched a nipple with the
tip of his finger. I looked up but he seemed to not have noticed, so I thought
it best to play it cool and act like it was normal.� We reached our table and he removed his hand
as we slid onto the bench seat. He was right beside me and I had to bite my
tongue as his hand moved to tickle my pussy under the table.� 

&nbsp;

�Please Nathan, not here.� I whispered to
him and tried to close my legs, but he just ignored me and all I managed to do
was to lock his hands in place between my legs.�
Sighing, I open them wide again, my reward being one of his beautiful
smiles.� He kept the same smile on his
face as the waitress came over to take our order, a flash of jealousy going
through me. I knew it was silly, I had only known him for a day, but already I
thought of him as being mine.� He ordered
for me again, but with his hand still rubbing gently on my slit I doubted I
could have spoken anyway.� When the
waitress left, he turned to me, his stare intense as he pushed his fingers into
me.� 

&nbsp;

�Julie, do you know what would make me
happy?� I would love to see you cum with
everyone around us having their breakfast.�
No one can see due to the cloth on the table but you have to do it
quietly. Do you think you can do that?���
I didn�t know but found my self nodding, my mind going to mush as he
ignited the flame that had been smouldering from the moment I saw him. 

&nbsp;

�The
sounds of the caf� faded as he pushed two fingers in to me and I was sure
everyone could hear the squishing sound his fingers in my wet pussy was making.
I went to close my eyes, but Nathan bent to whisper in my ear. �Oh no, keep
those pretty eyes open or you will give the game away.� 

&nbsp;

It was not easy as he increased the speed
and his thumb found my clit. I bit my lip as I felt my orgasm approaching and
looked into his eyes as I felt it explode, flooding his hand with my juices. I
was still trying not to make a sound as he leaned in and kissed me, his tongue
playing with mine.� He pulled back a
little and placed his hand on my lips, the same one he had used on my pussy and
stared intently into my eyes as I sucked in his fingers.� He had just pulled them out when a plate was
put down on the table and I was subjected to the burning glare of the waitress.
Instead of being upset, I found myself laughing and she walked away in a huff. 

&nbsp;

As I ate the pancakes Nathan had ordered, I
felt elated that I had managed to not only please Nathan but to do something I
didn�t think I would be able to achieve. When we walked out of the caf�, I
didn�t try to hide but walked proudly, enjoyed the stares.� Nathan held my hand and squeezed it as if to
say well done.� We reached the car and as
Nathan had already had it packed, he asked me to wait in the car while he went
to pay the bill for the motel. I was looking at a road map, not taking any
notice of what was going on around me, so assumed Nathan had returned when the
door opened. Smiling, I looked up and was surprised to see a strange man
there.� 

&nbsp;

�Hey love, do you charge by the hour or can
I get a quickie?�� He had his hands on
his belt and had started to unbuckle it when I saw Nathan come up behind him.
The man was pulled back and spun around before Nathan punched him on the
jaw.� The man stumbled back and landed
with a thump on the ground.� Nathan went
to kick him but seemed to change his mind and came around to get into the car.

&nbsp;

�I
was shaking, no so much from what the man had said but more from the violence
Nathan had shown.� He was still fuming,
his jaw twitching as he drove off. I could see the man shouting at the car and
was glad we were on our way out of town.�
It was a while before Nathan seemed to calm down and turned to me,
seeming to realise I was there for the first time since he had driven off.
�What did he say to you?� Did you
encourage him at all?�� 

&nbsp;

�I
was shocked by his questions and saw again the dark look that I had seen that
morning. �What? No, he just came up and asked me if I charged by the hour or
could he get a quickie, and then you came along.� I didn�t do anything to encourage him!� I was
insulted, especially since he was responsible for what I was wearing.� �It properly had something to do with the
fact that I�m dressed like a whore!� I hadn�t meant to raise my voice and knew
he was not happy when he jammed on the brakes and pulled the car over to the
side of the road.� 

&nbsp;

Before I even had a chance to react, his
hand was in my hair and he pulled my head back, making me look up at him. I
winced in pain, bringing up my hands to try to pry his hand off me. �Julie,
don�t ever raise your voice to me again, do you understand?� He was scaring me
now and I moved one hand down to the door handle, only to find it was locked. I
again thought of how little I knew about him. 

&nbsp;

�
�Nathan, please, you are hurting me.� He looked me in the eyes and then
loosened his grip but kept his hand in place. �Do you understand?�� I nodded and he let go of my hair but brought
his hand down to grip the back of my neck.�
Breathing hard, I felt a rush of emotion as my fear of him started to
grow.� I pulled back as his other hand
came to rest on my knee and moved up to my pussy yet again.� My fear didn�t go but was joined by the
familiar feeling of pleasure he seemed to be able to ignite in me.� 

&nbsp;

�Julie, by now you will be starting to work
out that I am not always an easy man to live with, but just do as I tell you
and I promise I will look after you.�� He
abruptly removed his fingers, let go of my neck and assumed driving as if
nothing unusual had happened.� Curling up
in my seat, I closed my eyes and tried to work out what to make of this man I
was so attracted to but was starting to fear as well.� He let me be and I fell asleep, only waking
up when he parked the car in what looked to be a car park.� �Wake up baby, we have some shopping to
do.�� 

&nbsp;

Standing up, I was still a bit unsure of
how to react to Nathan. He must have sensed something as he gently stroked his
hand down my face and flashed me another of his beaming smiles. �Julie, I got a
bit fired up before and I�m sorry if I hurt you, but I tend to get very
protective.� I decided a bit of fun might
be just what we both need.� He didn�t wait for me to answer but took my elbow
and led me into the shopping centre. He seemed to know what he wanted as he led
me past a range of shops before steering me into what looked to be a very
trendy store.� While I looked at the
clothes, he talked to the girl behind the counter and they both selected a
range of clothes for me to try on.� 

&nbsp;

�Come into the change room Julie and let�s
get you some new clothes.� I spent the next hour trying on more clothes that I
had ever had in my life and by the time Nathan was satisfied, I had so many
bags we could hardly carry them all. We put them in the car and then returned
to get shoes and then while I got us both some lunch, Nathan bought some things
he wouldn�t let me see. Hours later, when we were back on the road, the events
of the morning seemed like they had never happened. We drove for another few
hours until Nathan pulled into a motel.� 

&nbsp;

Settled in the room, he again rang for room
service while I tried on the clothes we had bought. I put the shoes with the
outfits and we tried to decide which ones we liked the best.� It was no coincidence that all the clothes
showed off my breasts and my legs but it was the nicest thing anyone had ever
done for me.� The knock on the door made
me jump and I remembered what had happened last time food had been delivered
but this time it was a lady and Nathan just took the food and said thank
you.� I wasn�t sure if I was relieved or
disappointed as he placed the tray of food on the bed and we sat down to eat.� 

&nbsp;

We ate in silence, something I had noticed
he liked to do and soon I was back up, trying on the last of the outfits.� It was then that he pulled out one of the
bags that he had not let me look in and started to lay the things out on the
bed. At first they seemed fairly normal, scarves and masking tape, but then the
items started to get a bit stranger.� He
placed what looked like a plastic cock with a dial on the bottom, a coil of
rope and what looked like a short whip of some kind.� If these did not freak me out, the last item
did as he placed a pair of handcuffs on the bed. I was speechless, looking at
the door and wondering if he had locked it or not.� 

&nbsp;

�Baby, don�t look so worried. I just
happened to find a sex shop and was curious. After last night, I just wondered
if you wanted to play but if it freaks you out too much I�ll just put them away
again.� Shame though, after spending all
that money and not get to at least try them once, it would have made me so
happy.�� He started to put the things
back in the bag and I started to think about all the money he had spent and
despite my fears reached out a hand to stop him. 

&nbsp;

�Wait, I didn�t say I wouldn�t be willing
to try some of these things, I was just a bit surprised, that�s all.� He smiled
and I thought it was worth his moods to be on the receiving end of just one of
his smiles.

&nbsp;

�Great Julie, I need you undress and stand
with your hands behind you.�� I was
surprised by how quickly he moved around me, tying my hands behind me with one
of the scarves and then bending me to kneel at the end of the bed. He kicked my
knees apart and used some of the rope to tie them to the legs of the bed.� Standing up on the bed, he wound another
piece of rope around the ceiling fan and then attached it to the scarf tying my
arms together, pulling until my arms were up in the air and my shoulders were
just on the verge of hurting. 

&nbsp;

�He
stepped down off the bed and I thought he seemed to be very aware of what he
was doing, not looking very new to this at all.�
He knelt down beside me and rubbed his hand up my back. �Julie, are you
ok?� I saw this pose on the Internet once
but if it is too much for you, I can alter it.��
I saw the gleam in his eye, like a little boy with a new toy, so despite
that fact it was a bit awkward I nodded. 

&nbsp;

He picked up another scarf, tied a knot in
the middle and placed the knot in my mouth before tying the scarf around my
head.� I could no longer speak and make
any sense and that bothered me. He went behind me and picked up the tape,
winding it around on top of the scarf, meaning even less sound came out as I
tried to speak.� I struggled to get out
but found I was not going anywhere. Nathan moved back behind me and I could
hear him fumbling around in the bags.�
His hand on my bottom made me jump as did the feel of leather being
dragged over my skin. He left the thing lying on my back as he turned on the TV
and then picked it up again.� 

&nbsp;

I knew I was well and truly in over my head
from the moment he hit my back, the scream lost behind the gag, my body jerking
as much as it could in it�s current position. He continued to hit me, moving
from one place to the next.� I kept
hoping someone would knock on the door but the sound of the TV must have been
masking the other sounds in the room.�
Finally he dropped what he had been using on the floor and I felt his
hands on my hips as he pushed his cock into me.

&nbsp;

�Like
all the other times I was wet and he had no trouble getting his cock inside of
me.� He ran his finger around my ass and
I froze. �Don�t worry baby, I�m leaving that one until another time.� I tried
again to get away from him but he just laughed and started to work his cock in
and out of me at a frantic pace.� Closing
my eyes, I thought of the times he had given me the opportunity to leave but
somehow had always pulled me back to him. He increased his pace even more,
using his hand to stimulate my clit, so that despite never wanting to cum for
him again, I knew he would be able to make me.�


&nbsp;

The tears dripped onto the bed as he
stretched me wide, his fingers tight on my hips.� When he started to cum, I felt only relief
that he would soon be done and I hadn�t yet cum, but he seemed determined to
make me cum too.� I tried to hold back
and managed to not cum as much as other times, but still he had won.� I felt his cum inside of me, the first time
he had done that, and knew that that was also not a good sign.� 

&nbsp;

I was left as I was while he went and
showered, finally letting my arms down but not untying them.� He untied my legs and sat me up on the bed,
my back resting on the bed head. He tied my legs to the end of the bed, making
me spread my pussy out for him.� �Julie,
I am sure you have figured by now that I am not actually as new to all this as
I lead you to believe.� You may be sorry
you didn�t go when you had the chance as now you belong to me.��� 

&nbsp;

I wondered if he was crazy or just plain
dangerous, neither options sounding good to me.�
�In a few days time, we will reach my new home. I had thought I would
have to look for a new girl once I got there but you were so nice to actually
come with me.� Now, things are going to
change a bit, but basically you just keep doing as I say and you will be ok.� 

&nbsp;

He sounded so casual, like he told girls
every day that he owned them.� It was
just too much to take in and I started to cry, the gag making it hard to catch
my breath. Thankfully he pulled of the tape and then the scarf, letting me take
the deep breaths I needed.� He held up a
glass of water for me to drink and then sat back down on the bed, watching me. 

&nbsp;

�Julie, I know this is a big shock to you,
but after the way you have done all I have asked the last two days, I believe
you may actually even enjoy learning to serve me.� I glared at him and went to
speak, his hand coming down to cover my mouth before I could get a word out.� �One of your new rules is to not speak unless
you are asked to.� Another one is from
now on you will call me Sir.�� I wanted
to pinch myself to see if this was real but knew it all was. �Now, I am going
to trust you not to scream and if you can do that, I will let you ask me some
questions.�

&nbsp;

I looked at this man, this handsome, scary
man I knew I was both terrified off and starting to fall in love with, and
tried to think of what to ask him. �Nath, ah Sir, what are you going to do with
me?� He seemed to be thinking and I wondered if he was still trying to decide
himself. 

&nbsp;

�Julie, that will depend somewhat on you
but put simply you will become mine.� If
you do as you are told, you will have fun, just as you have done the last two
days.� I tried to digest what he had told me, my feelings all churned up.� 

&nbsp;

�What if, what if you are not happy with me
Sir?�� I had already experienced an
unhappy Nathan but sensed that things would only get worse. Again he seemed to
be thinking of what he might say.� The
longer he took to answer me, the more my imagination kicked in.

&nbsp;

�Julie, you would be punished.�� I fought to not cry but the thought of being
punished in any way just petrified me. I tried to get my hands free but they
wouldn�t budge. I started to shake, the reality of what he was saying starting
to slowly sink in.

&nbsp;

��Nathan, Sir, please, it is not too late to
let me go, I won�t tell anyone, please. I just don�t know if I can do what you
want me to do.�� I searched for any sign
of mercy in his eyes but when I saw none, the tears again flowed.� Once I had calmed down a bit, I had to find
out one more thing. �You are going to make me do things in public, aren�t you
Sir?�� This time his smile returned
though it was more evil than the ones he had used before.

&nbsp;

��Oh
yes, I like to see how the public react and of course how you react too.� If you do half as good as you did this
morning, then we will both have lots of fun. Ok, enough for tonight. I need to
get you tied down and then we both need a good night�s sleep.� He pulled the
rope tying my legs to the bed and I was forced to slide down the bed, until I
was lying on my tied arms.� Thankfully,
he lifted me up and untied the scarf, laying me back down again onto the bed. I
couldn�t help but moan as he pulled my hands up and again tied them to the top of
the bed, this time using rope and not a scarf like last night. Once my hands
were tied, he tightened the rope around my ankles until they were tightly bound
to the bottom of the bed.

&nbsp;

Picking up the scarf he had used to gag me
before, I tried to avoid it, without any success as it was tied firmly in
place.� Turning off the light, he lay
down beside me and I tried to move away from him but didn�t have much movement
at all.� He spent the next five minutes
running his hand over me before he drifted off to sleep, leaving me to ponder
my uncertain future. 

&nbsp;

Chapter 3

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The night had been a long one, with both my
mind and my gradually stiffening body not letting me rest. I am sure I heard
every car on the highway and every tick of the clock on the wall.� I think I dozed off sometime in the early
hours of the morning and woke again to the sounds of the birds in the trees and
pressure in my bladder.� Unlike
yesterday, I didn�t try to wake him, but had to try hard not to piss all over
the bed. 

&nbsp;

He eventually began to stir, looking across
the pillows to see me wide awake.� He
smiled and ran his hand down to my pussy.�
�Morning baby, I bet you really need to pee, don�t you? Well, here is the
rule, you want me to help you, you have to do something for me first.�� Thinking of how little I could do in my
current position, I shrugged my shoulders to try to show him I didn�t
understand.

&nbsp;

However, once he knelt up on the bed,
straddling me, his morning erection was impossible to miss. Reaching behind my
head to untie the gag, I would have loved a drink of water but he had other
plans.� Before I even had the chance to
close my mouth, his cock was inside and surging down into my throat. My mouth
was dry and it hurt as his cock stretched out my throat. With my head on he
pillow I had little room to move and had to let him control the movement of his
cock. 

&nbsp;

I was gagging with each thrust and closed
my eyes so I didn�t have to see it going in to me. He didn�t take long to cum,
but he held his cock deep in my throat, my head feeling dizzy and my lungs
needing air by the time he was done.�
Shaking my head, he kept his cock in place until I thought he was never
going to pull it out.� Finally he pulled
out and while I tried to catch my breath amid my coughs, he untied me.� 

&nbsp;

Sitting up slowly, I felt stiff and sore
but refused his offered hand as I made it to my feet.� �Julie, you have twenty minutes to do
whatever you need to do in the bathroom. Your clothes will be ready on the bed
when you come out.� I nodded and headed into the bathroom, using the toilet
first before looking to see if there was anyway I could get out using the
window.� Turning on the shower, I tried
to get the window open until my fingers were sore, but it wouldn�t budge. Starting
to panic about the time, I jumped in the shower, still trying to the think of
ways I could get away from him.� A knock
on the door warned me to hurry up and I turned off the water, shaking at the
thought of facing him.� 

&nbsp;

I contemplated staying in the bathroom but
the thought of his possible reaction made me find the strength to dry off and
head back out.� My stomach was doing
flips as I walked out of the room and stood in the doorway.� I just couldn�t seem to take another step and
used my hands to cover my pussy and breasts, despite the fact he had seen me
naked already.� He smiled at me, though
not his nice, friendly one, but one that sent chills down my spine, and strode
towards me.� He was in front of me in
what felt like seconds, his hands firmly taking hold of my wrists and holding
them above my head.� His other hand
travelled down my stomach to find my pussy and he began to pump me. It seemed
like he only had to touch my pussy to make me hot and I closed my eyes to enjoy
the sensation, when he pulled his fingers out. 

&nbsp;

Moaning in frustration, I opened my eyes to
his laughing as he picked up something from the bed.� It was the vibrator he had shown me yesterday
and I was not surprised when he pushed it up into my pussy.� What did surprise me was the straps he picked
up and attached around my waist and the other one he pulled up between my legs
that he attached to the waistband back and front.� He pulled it tight and I gasped as the
vibrator moved even deeper into my pussy.�


&nbsp;

I didn�t know what he had in mind, but when
I felt a jolt go through me it took me by surprise. �Feel that Julie?� That is the lowest level, take a deep breath
now as I turn it to the highest level.��
He only gave me a moment before an agonising jolt spread throughout my
whole body and I only remained standing because he was holding me up.� He turned it off and I slumped against him,
not even caring that I was so close to him, as I tried to recover.� �Now, you will wear this all day until I decide
to remove it and if I think you are trying to escape or get attention, you will
think that was nothing.� 

&nbsp;

�A
feeling of despair washed over me as I thought of the control he would have
over me.� It would be just as if I was
tied up, he had me bound by the thought of the pain he could inflict on me.
�Please Sir, I won�t try to get away, please don�t hurt me again.�� He touched my face, his fingers gentle as he
lifted it to look at him.� 

&nbsp;

�That�s what I hope, that I don�t have to
hurt you. Julie, just do as I say and everything will be like it has
been.�� Except you have me stuffed with a
plastic cock ready to shock me, I thought.�
�Now, we need to get you dressed and ready for another exciting
day.�� For the first time, I looked to
see what he had laid out for me to wear and wasn�t surprised to see one of the
short skirts we had bought yesterday and a little halter top which left little
to the imagination. 

&nbsp;

�I
dressed; trying to ignore the full feeling the vibrator caused me.� A pair of shoes were placed on the bed and I
sighed, seeing the ones Nathan had insisted we buy, the ones with the five inch
heel.� I had hardly been able to walk in
them in the store and didn�t know how I would manage all day, though I hoped
much of it would be spent sitting in the car.�


&nbsp;

Sitting gingerly on the bed to put the
shoes on, I found my hands were shaking too much to do up the buckle and I
looked fearfully up at Sir hoping he wouldn�t think I was wasting time. �Sir, I
can�t seem to do up the buckle.�� I could
hear the tremor in my voice and hated that he made me feel that way. 

&nbsp;

��Well, you only have to ask if you need help
Julie. You will not be in trouble if you try you hardest, only if you don�t try
at all.�� I flinched as his hand touched
my leg, but he just did up the shoes and stood me up, helping me to walk on
wobbly legs out to the car.� �I thought
we might just get some breakfast on the run, as there is some place I want to
be by afternoon.�� 

&nbsp;

It was only just past 7am so I figured we
had a full day of driving ahead of us and I was right.� We only stopped twice in the next 7 hours,
once for some lunch bought through another drive thru and again just before
3pm, when he pulled into a small park.� I
had almost forgotten the vibrator, not having given him any reason to use it on
me, so when he reached into his pocket to pull out the controls, I started to
panic.� 

&nbsp;

He pressed the button and I braced myself
for the expected pain but instead felt a warm, buzzing sensation fill my
pussy.� Looking up in surprise, he
grinned smugly at me. �Like you will learn, where there is pain, pleasure is
often not far away.� You have been very
good today and this is your reward.� I felt the buzzing increase and closed my
eyes as the vibrator did its job and I felt all the pent up emotions and fear
vanish as I let my body take over. 

&nbsp;

The orgasm when it came was a strong one
and for a few moments I had been able to forget the man who literally had
control over me.� It took me a moment to
take in my surroundings and I felt the reality of my situation hit me again.� I pulled down the skirt that had ridden up my
thighs and sat up, feeling shame at the way I had cum in front of him. He
pulled out of the park, stopping only moments later in front of a bar in a
small town.� �Julie, I thought it might
be nice to have a drink. Don�t forget what will happen if you try anything.�� He came around to my door and helped me into
the bar. I was very aware of my nipples showing through my halter and the way
the shoes made my bottom wiggle. 

&nbsp;

There was only one other person in the bar
and for the first ten minutes or so we did just enjoy a drink.� I was aware of the bar tender giving me the
eye but as he made no move to approach me, I tried not to let it worry me.� Nathan had just about finished his drink when
the doors of the bar burst open and a group of workers entered. They looked hot
and dirty and they all stopped and starred at me. 

&nbsp;

I looked to Nathan, hoping he would let us
go out to the car, but to my horror he waved at the guys and got up to talk to
the ones closest to him. No one had approached me yet, but I was getting very
uncomfortable with all the stares.� I
heard laughter and looked up to see Nathan pointing at me and then shaking the
hand of the bar tender, who had come around to join in the group.

&nbsp;

When he came back to the table and held his
hand out to me, I thought we were going, until he led me to stand near the back
of the bar.� I went to resist him and was
jolted slightly, just enough to remind me who was in charge. �Julie, don�t make
me have to do that again. Now, the boys here are keen to spend some time with you
and you are not going to disappoint them.��


&nbsp;

�What do I have to do Sir?�� I didn�t really want to know, but didn�t want
another shock either. I could feel the blush rising up my chest and onto my
cheeks and lowered my head so that he wouldn�t see the embarrassment he was
causing me.

&nbsp;

�That�s my girl. First they want to see
your body and I know they will love to see what you wear under your
skirt.�� I went to speak but his finger
hovering over the button on the remote stopped me. Taking a deep breath, I
figured that though it would be embarrassing it would be over with
quickly.� Nathan went over to the jukebox
and soon a song blared out through the room and the men starting to cheer and
clap. 

&nbsp;

I saw Nathan come back to sit on the table
close to me, the remote in his hand.�
Closing my eyes, I started to grind my hips and was met with a rousing
cheer. Thinking it may not be so hard to please the men, I put a bit more
effort into my movements before reaching behind to undo the halter behind my
neck. Teasing the men, I made as if to lower the top, covering back up again a
few times before I let it drop fully.� 

&nbsp;

Suddenly I felt the vibrator start up, the
warm feeling spreading gently through me again.�
I paused, looking over at Nathan, who just smiled and waved the remote
in the air.� Fearing being shocked again,
I resumed my dance by reaching around and undoing the tie behind my back, the
last thing keeping my top on.� I brought
my hands up to my breasts, squeezing them gently amid more cheering.� The vibrator increased in speed, making me
gasp as I involuntarily wriggled my hips.�
It was all I could do to stay standing, as I tried to fight the
vibrations, finally having to squat down.�
The men started to clap and chant to see my pussy and I realised they
would also get to see the base of the vibrator as well.� 

&nbsp;

The vibrations decreased and stopped and I
was able to stand, knowing I had to remove the skirt.� The cheers increased as the skirt skimmed
down my legs and as I picked up one leg to remove the skirt from the heel of my
shoe, the crowd drew in their breath. I froze as I realised they must have
noticed the vibrator and went to cover up, when the vibrator burst into life
again, this time at what had to be the highest setting.� There was no hope of ignoring it and I found
myself on the floor with my body wiggling around amid the cheers and catcalls
of the men.� I was lost again to everyone
and everything as my body reached the heights of pleasure.� Expecting Nathan to let me recover, I was not
ready for the vibrations to continue and was helpless to stop yet another
orgasm from forming and rocking my body.�


&nbsp;

As the vibrations stopped and I started to
become aware of my surroundings once again, I flinched as a hand touched my
shoulder.� It was Nathan and he ran his
hand over my breast as he lifted me to sit up and leaned down to whisper in my
ear.� �Baby, you are doing very well, now
you just have to thank these guys for there kind words and support, and then we
can go.�� I went to say thank you, when I
was confronted by one of the men with his cock in his hand.� Waiting for Nathan to send him packing, I got
a sickening feeling when he just stood up and sat back down at the table.� 

&nbsp;

The man grabbed my hair and pulled my head
to his cock, not even giving me time to take in a breath as he used my ears
like handles and pushed his cock into my throat. I couldn�t believe Nathan had
done this to me and hoped I wouldn�t be expected to service them all.� I couldn�t breath as the big cock blocked my
air and he came quickly, sending his cum into my stomach.� There was no time to recover as another cock
took the place of the first, this guy taking his time, despite the calls for
him to get a move on. 

&nbsp;

�It
gave me the time to do a head count and saw at least a dozen guys lining
up.� He came all over me, a trend that
was repeated by half of the men as I struggled to cope with what they were
doing to me. Some of the men reached down to grab my breasts while their cock
filled my mouth and throat, while others liked to grip by hair till I thought
it would come out. My jaw was aching and I felt dirty as finally Nathan stood
up and held out his hand to me.� I had
not noticed but all the men were gone and we were alone, though I could still hear
the men talking not far away.� 

&nbsp;

I was in a daze as I felt him drape a
blanket over me and lift me up.� I buried
my head in his shoulder as he walked back through the bar, not wanting to look
at the men who had used me.� He lowered
me into the car and I curled up on the seat, not caring where we went so long
as it was away from the bar.� 

&nbsp;

I don�t know how long we drove for but
eventually we were in another motel room, with Nathan lifting me into warm
bath.� I noticed that the vibrator was
gone and was amazed that I hadn�t even noticed it being removed. The feeling of
a washer made me jump as Nathan washed off the dried cum that had collected on
my body, even washing the cum out of my hair.���
I felt numb, my mind not yet able to come to terms with what I had been
made to do.

&nbsp;

After my bath, he offered me some food, but
I just couldn�t eat. Later, I was tied down to a chair while Nathan had his
shower. It was while he was in the shower that I began to feel angry over what
had happened and struggled to get free from the chair. I had not been tied very
tight, properly due to the fact I had hardly moved since we had got to the room
and to my surprise I managed to get one hand free. 

&nbsp;

Frantically, I got the other hand free,
aware that while the shower was still running, he wouldn�t be too long.� I tried the door, which was locked and
started to search for the room key. I had just about given up when I saw it
poking out from under his coat and tried to open the door with out being heard,
when I realised I was naked.� Under his
coat I could see the clothes I had worn that day and was just pulling up the
skirt when the shower stopped.� 

&nbsp;

Trying to stay calm, I slipped the key in
the door and once outside I used the key to lock the door, just as I heard him
yell out for me.� I didn�t know how long
it would take him to get the door open but I knew I had to move.� Cursing that I didn�t think to look for the
car keys, I ran to reception to see if they could ring the police for me. The
man behind the counter was on the phone and looked right at me as I ran in. He
smiled and told me to wait, while speaking into the phone. As he hung up, he
looked at me in a strange way and asked if he could help me.� I started to say that I needed to use the
phone to call the police and that I was in trouble, all the while he continued
to give me the same strange look. 

&nbsp;

Starting to feel uncomfortable, I looked
around to make sure Nathan was not out of the room yet, when he came around the
counter and locked the door.� Now I
really was sure something weird was happening and started to back away from
him. �Hey, my mate was just telling me about this little slut who sucked off
him and his work mates at the bar and the way he described her, she looked just
like you.� Was it you darling?��� I couldn�t believe I had managed to get away
from one mad man to run right into another one.�


&nbsp;

�Please, he made me do it and I have to use
your phone to call the police.� I was almost hysterical now and knew I wasn�t
making a lot of sense. The phone rang again and I breathed a sigh of relief as
he went to answer it. I moved to try the door, but without the key, I couldn�t
get it open. His expression changed as his conversation continued and he looked
at me like I was his prey.� 

&nbsp;

He called a young girl out from a room
behind him and whispered something to her, before she got a key from under the
desk. I had an awful feeling I knew which room it was for and who was on the
phone. I tried to dash behind the counter, as there seemed to be a way out the
back, only to trip over his leg. Winded, I attempted to stand only to find his
foot resting on my back. �Please, help me.�
Don�t let him hurt me.� 

&nbsp;

��Listen here you little slut, I know about
your show this afternoon, cumming in front of a whole group of guys and then
sucking them off with not one complaint. Don�t try to tell me you don�t love
it.� I just had your doctor on the phone
and he told me about your addiction to sex and the way you love to exhibit
yourself in public. Lets get you up, as here comes the good doctor now.� 

&nbsp;

He held me by my elbow as he unlocked the
door and let Nathan in. �Doctor, it was such good luck that your patient was
here when you called. Fancy her locking you in the room just so she could make
a scene. It is a real shame that you have to lock her away but I guess it is
for her own good.� I barely heard a word the man was saying as Nathan glared at
me.� I started to shake, thinking for the
first time what he might do to me.� He
took me from the man, shaking his hand, his anger barely contained as he
dragged me across to our room.� Once we
were inside, he pushed me up against the wall and gripped me by the throat. 

&nbsp;

�I thought I had made myself very clear,
but it seems you need a reminder.�� My
shaking increased as he blocked off my air and then let go, throwing me down
onto the bed. He was on me in seconds, ripping off the skirt and pulling my
breasts out of the halter.� He pulled out
what looked to be my panties from the first day and told me to open up.� When I hesitated, he held my nose until I was
forced to open up and he shoved them into my mouth.� Ignoring the taste, I tried to stay calm as
they threatened to go down the back of my throat. He pulled them out a bit and
then use the masking tape to hold them in place.� 

&nbsp;

Dropping me onto the bed, he tied my arms
above my head, tightly this time and did the same thing to my legs, so that I
was spread wide.� I tried to see what was
he getting as he pulled something out of the shopping bag from yesterday.� Something shiny caught my eye, but not for
long as he pulled on my nipple and I looked down to see his fingers pinching
me.� I was surprised when he took his
hands away to see a shiny clamp there, something he applied to the other nipple
as well.

&nbsp;

�There was some pain but when he got a rope and
pulled it through each clamp and pulled it up, I had to moan as the pain just
got more intense the higher he pulled.��
He wound the rope around the light fitting and used it like a pulley to
pull my nipples up high, finally tying the rope off to the bedpost.�� I was panting behind the gag, trying to find
a way to cope the best I could with the way he had stretched my nipples.� 

&nbsp;

He walked over to the mini bar and poured
out a drink, watching me all the time.� I
was trying hard not to move, as it only caused me pain, when he came and sat on
the bed beside me. �Julie, you still have a lot to learn but tonight I hope you
are learning not to fuck with me.� I nodded, trying to tell him I was learning,
but he just stood up again and turned on the TV.� I spent the next thirty minutes with the
sound of canned laughter in my ears as he watched some lame comedy and tried to
block out the pain.

&nbsp;

When the show was over, he lessened the
pull on the ropes and put his hand on one of the clamps. The pain only
increased as he took off the clamps, making me cry as he rubbed each nipple in
turn. Thinking my punishment was over; I started to whimper as he picked up the
vibrator he had made me wear all day.� He
pushed it in, having a bit more difficulty than this morning. �I did warn you
what would happen if you tried to escape.��
I was shaking and trying to beg him not to do it, but it made no
difference as I felt the shock jolt through me.�
Jerking on the bed, I closed my eyes and wished he would stop.� When the shock stopped, I kept my eyes
closed, sobbing as my poor pussy throbbed. 

&nbsp;

The bed dipped as he sat down and wiped the
hair out of my eyes. �Julie, look at me.� I did as he asked, not wishing to
disobey him again �If you try anything like that again, your time being
punished will double and be worse than it was tonight.� I sobbed more and he
took off the gag, my mouth dry as he removed my panties.� I just couldn�t seem to stop crying and found
myself coughing as the crying irritated my dry and still sore throat. 

&nbsp;

Holding a glass of water against my lips, I
drank greedily until I had eased my thirst but it did nothing to help the
burning in my throat caused by all the cocks.�
Thinking of the afternoon only made me cry again.� By the time I had calmed some, I realised he
had untied my hands from the bed, though they will still tied in front of me
and untied my legs. He pulled me to sit up and sat down on the bed beside me.
�What made you think you could get away from me?� 

&nbsp;

He didn�t sound angry anymore but I didn�t
know if he would remain that way. �I didn�t think, I just saw an opportunity
and had to take it �. Sir.� I had almost forgotten to use his title and was
glad he didn�t have a reason to punish me more. I watched his face to see if he
was showing any anger but he seemed calm.�
In fact, he looked just like he had the first time I had seen him. 

&nbsp;

��Julie, I know a lot has happened but the day
will come when you will never wish to leave me.�� I doubted that but kept it to myself. �I
would not have decided to keep and train you if I didn�t think you have the
ability to be submissive. You will see, in time you will be begging me to use
your body anyway I want to.� His hand was running all over me and it was all I
could do not to move away from him.�
�Well, it is late and there is still a fair way to go if we want to make
it to our new home tomorrow.�� I hated
how he called it our new home, like I had chosen to go there.� 

&nbsp;

He pulled my arms up again, tying them off
and turning me on my side so that I was forced to feel his cock against my
thighs and could feel my breasts rubbing against his chest.� I got some sleep, but woke up each time he
moved and his cock rubbed on my leg. When I did manage to get some sleep, it
was to dream of cocks and I woke with a start. I thought about what he had said
about begging him to use me and vowed I would never do that, as once again I
drifted off into a troubled sleep.

&nbsp;

Chapter 4

&nbsp;

I woke before Nathan and lay looking at
him.� He looked so handsome and I felt
again the desire I had felt when I had first seen him. It was hard to believe
that was only a few days ago and the way he had taken control of my life.� He started to stir and I quickly closed my
eyes hoping he would still think I was sleeping.� His cock twitched on my leg and I had to grit
my teeth not to pull back away from it.�
His hand started to tap on my hip and then when I didn�t respond, moved
down between my legs.� I had to gasp as
he rolled me over onto my back and wormed his finger into my dry pussy. 

&nbsp;

��Morning baby, hope you slept well.�� I couldn�t look at him as he continued to
finger me, spitting on his finger a few times to create some moisture.� He was hurting me and I started to moan in
pain, his other hand coming down to cover my mouth. �A bit dry this morning
Julie, don�t worry, we will soon fix that.��


&nbsp;

He picked up something from the bag beside
the bed and tried to lift up my head to see what it was, but his hand held me
down.� I squealed as he held something on
my clit, the vibrations making me squirm on the bed.� As much as I didn�t want to, I felt my pussy
getting wet and he pulled the vibrator away and pushed his cock in.� He pumped away, making me feel like an object
as he used me to ease his morning erection. When he came, I felt nothing except
a sense of helplessness.� Nathan pulled
out and went into the bathroom, leaving me to lie in the sperm that was
dripping out of my pussy.� 

&nbsp;

When he emerged again and untied me, I
still didn�t look at him. I was allowed time to use the bathroom, the clothes
he wanted me to wear on the bed when I came out. I dressed quickly and sat
waiting, my mind seeming to be in a haze.�
Even when he stood me up and inserted the vibrator I had worn yesterday,
I just let him.� Later as we drove away
from the town, the bar where he had made me strip and suck all those cocks in
front of me, I just closed my eyes till it was out of sight.�� I could sense Nathan looking at me from time
to time but I just stared out the window as people went about their lives in
freedom.� 

&nbsp;

We didn�t stop at all until mid afternoon,
our lunch having been bought at a fast food restaurant.� I was glad he had not demanded any more of me
today, my body feeling sore from the day before.� When we pulled into a small park, I thought
back to the similar park we had stopped in only yesterday, before our trip to
the bar. I didn�t move as he came around to open my door, my heart beating as
he held out his hand for me to take. I wondered at his gentle approach, even
more so as he sat me down gently on the park bench. 

&nbsp;

��Julie, you have been very quite today and I
thought we should have a little talk before we get to the house.�� The mention of his house just made me feel
even more trapped and I felt tears come to my eyes.� �You do know I am not mad about last night
anymore.� I just stared at him, not understanding how he thought that was all I
was upset about. �Julie, you may speak to me openly here, so please talk to
me.�� What could I say that would make
any difference? 

&nbsp;

�What do you want me to say, Sir, that I am
terrified of the control you have over me or that I hate you for what you made
me do yesterday?�� I stopped, horrified
at what I had said and expecting him to explode.� Instead he stood up and squatted down in
front of me.� 

&nbsp;

�Julie, I can�t blame you for feeling that
way. I pushed you hard yesterday but you did very well and you made me happy. I
am sorry that you don�t appreciate what I am trying to do for you but in time
you will.� Trying to stand up, I found his hands on my shoulders and he pushed
me back down again. 

&nbsp;

��Why
can�t you just let me go? You have had your fun and I won�t tell anyone. Please
Nathan, I�m begging you.�� I felt the
tears come again as he brushed my hair back from my eyes. I was scared I had
gone too far and expected him to pull out the remote and shock me again at any
moment.

&nbsp;

�No Julie, I�m not going to let you go but
I do have a proposition for you. If you will stay with me and do all that I
say, then I promise that in six months time I will let you go if you still want
to go.� I thought I must have been hearing things and looked up expecting to
see a smirk on his face.� However he
looked that most serious I had seen him and I felt a ray of hope that I might
get away from him one day.

&nbsp;

�Six months?� How can I be sure you are not just teasing me
to get me to do what you want me to do, Sir?��
My heart was beating and I hoped he was not tricking me. Six months
still felt like a lifetime to me, at least it was better then a whole lifetime.


&nbsp;

��Julie, I promise you I am serious and when we
get to the house I will put it in a contract for you.�� My head was spinning and I didn�t know what
to think.� First he scared the hell out
of me and now he was sounding like a businessman talking about contracts. 

&nbsp;

��What if I decide I want to leave after six
months, will you let me?�� He sighed and
looked me right in the eye. Again I feared I had upset him and waited for the
pain from the vibrator buried deep in my pussy.�� When it didn�t come, I looked to see him
staring intently at me, a serious look on his face.

&nbsp;

��Julie, if I say I am going to do something, I
do it.� You can be sure that if you want
to go I won�t stop you, though I am certain you will be staying.�� I didn�t know why he kept on insisting I
would want to stay but I was starting to feel the depression I had felt all day
lifting a bit. Though it would mean spending six months with him, at least
there was hope. 

&nbsp;

�Well I suppose I have no choice but to
agree, do I?�� I sounded a bit more
aggressive than I had meant to but my emotions were just so raw. He smiled at
me and I though I didn�t want to, I felt my pussy respond.� 

&nbsp;

�Julie, I understand that you need time to
get used to everything but be careful how you speak to me.�� His words reminded me that he was in charge,
as he lifted me up off the seat.� Six
months, the words kept going around in my head as he drove along a country
road.� He pulled into a driveway and a
soon we were heading up to a well cared for old home.� �Here is your new home. What do you
think?�� I couldn�t think of anything
other than spending six months with him, but tried to think of something to
say. 

&nbsp;

�It�s nice sir.� He parked the car and as I
sat looking at the house while he came around to the side of the car and opened
my door.� Suddenly it all seemed so real
and despite his promise, I felt like the moment I set foot inside the house I
would never get my life back.� Starting
to shake, I was pulled to my feet and led in the direction of the house.� I couldn�t help but wonder at what six months
with Nathan would be like.� As he led me
to the door, I knew that whatever happened, my life would never be the same
again. 

&nbsp;
