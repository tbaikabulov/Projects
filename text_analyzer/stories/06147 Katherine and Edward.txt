Synopsis: A half way romantic, half way masochistic fantasy about a spoiled young wife, and a rather sadistic husband (who of course is truely in his right :))         








Katherine felt attracted to him the very first time she saw him. He was different than the other men she knew, not that she knew that many, but there was something altogether safe and yet demanding about him. He looked her straight in the eyes, unlike boys her own age, and he showed his interest in her, in an open and pleasant manner. They met at a party of the better circles. She had come there with her two sisters, both older, and both married. The youngest in the family, she was used to having it her way, and she was generally considered a bit of a wit, her sharp tongue, combined with her rather pretty face and figure, gave her an advantage to both her sisters, and most of the local girls of her surroundings. She had only been going to balls a few times, due to her young age, and the fact that there just wasn't all that many balls in the sleepy little country town, she lived in. Each ball was therefore quite an event, and something the whole neighbourhood looked forward to. Her mother had made sure she was dressed in a new, stunning, yet rather shiny dress, all in different shades of green, to match her red hair. Her mother hoped for a good match for her daughter, yet she, who had been reading love novels since she reached puberty, and she enjoyed the notion of scandalising the town with an interesting wedding. Scandalising was something she enjoyed doing in general, and she was often encouraged by her indulgent parents. So the fact that he was merely a teacher at a university in town, didn't disturb her in the least. She had lived in a privileged home her entire life, and thus had little idea of what it meant to live in a different environment. 



She was drawn to him before she was even introduced to him, he was standing in a group of men much older than himself, and discussing something she was unable to hear, yet he impressed her with his air of gentle openness, and before they had spoken many words of common pleasantries, she had decided he would be hers. They had conversed on nothing interesting, just the state of the weather, the niceness of the ball, the amount of courses at the preceding dinner. During the dances that she had willingly let him take throughout the night, she had started planning the wedding. He was no dashing beauty, though not at all disgusting to look at, his main advantage was the fact that she had only the country men and boys to compare. Her first dance partner from this winter, who had stepped on her toes, and nearly tripped her, who was so nervous that he could hardly stammer about the weather, or the young man of fortune, who had been so overconfident in his bragging just a fortnight ago. Now, this was what she had been waiting for, and with the coyness of youth, she impatiently pursued him. New to the game, and without anything, but her large consumption of love novels to guide her, she tried her best to look romantic, and to encourage his advances. She even tried complementing his good sense, but ended up blushing furiously when her only reply was a surprised smile, and a raised eyebrow.&nbsp; The next days consisted in many a walk in town, hopping to meet him by chance, and to make her father invite him to dinner, something he eventually did. 



Her father, who didn't find much stimulation from his rather silly wife, and equally silly daughter, was excited to have find a companion for more interesting subjects than the lacing of a gown, and gossip about the neighbours. It therefore did not take much encouragement, before the young man was coming to visit them almost every day. Between discussions, that she, after a few futile attempts of looking clever,&nbsp; did not participate in, they managed to get some time alone, going for walks in the surroundings, and&nbsp; engaging in a game of whist at night. He brought her books, and encouraged her to read more, but after a few pages, she always found it to tiring, and instead she had him tell her about them. In such a fashion the day passed, and turned to weeks. Her father, who was not the most observant gentleman, did not notice the young peoples attraction for a very long time. When at first he did, he tried to explain to her the disadvantages of such a match. His daughter, who had become rather obsessed after the last weeks constant exposure to the young man, became even more obsessed with the idea. When just a fortnight later, Edward, which was the name of our hero, asked her to marry him, she hardly let him finish his sentence before she interrupted him with her consent. He became, if possible, even more serious, and, whilst hushing her, and holding&nbsp; a finger over her mouth, he told her that �you cannot expect this lifestyle that you have been used to here, to continue with me. I do not have the means of your father, my house is small, you will not be able to get&nbsp; fancy new dresses, nor will there be any balls, or jewellery, you will have to work in the household yourself, until I get a chair, and we can afford a housekeeper. You must understand what it is you are saying yes to. I will expect more from my wife, than you have been used to, I expect my wife to obey me, there will be no more idle time for silly love novels, and girlish games. � Had she listened more carefully to what he was saying she might have reacted differently that she did, but she was to occupied with a tingling feeling of success, and her plans of the wedding. She imagined her fathers face, when Edward would ask him, and the envy of all the girls of the town, at their wedding. As soon a he stopped speaking she told him �please go see papa at once! Oh, when shall we set the date, please do let it be soon!�. Seeing as he had made no impression on her, he smiled, and went to talk to her father, convinced that she must have already had those thoughts herself. Her father, though reluctant, gave his consent, and the wedding was planned for the coming spring, mainly due to the impatience of the bride to be. 



Edward had already disappointed his bride, by forbidding her to use a fortune on the wedding dress. She had been most offended at this, since her parents where paying, and since she was used to having her will. But she thought to herself, that she would not have to endure such things once they where married, and that it was wiser to play along for the time being. Without her knowledge, Edward had already refused to accept any financial support from his father in law. Their wedding, though much smaller than she had hopped, lived up to her expectations. She looked lovely in her white dress, and not an eye stayed dry, all the young girls in church envied her, and she loved every second of it. Straight after the marriage, they travelled post to their new home. It was the first time she had been utterly alone with him. 

He moved closer to her, and put his arm around her, and, because she shirked away, blushing, he used his other hand to guide her head towards him, and kissed her for the first time. Katherine, who had but little notion of intimacy, had not given this part of her marriage a thought. The closeness of his body, the feeling of being encompassed in his arms, was already making her dizzy and afraid, but his surprisingly soft lips on hers send waves of shock through her body. Had she been more prepared, and had she been expecting this part, she might have enjoyed it, but as it was, she felt like she would faint, and her heart pumped like it wanted to jump out of her chest. She dared not pull away, but she remained only lightly returning his kiss, mainly from pure instinct. Had she not thought of intimacy before, it was but all she could think of now. 



Edward could feel her shaking like a little bird in his arms, and enjoyed how his kisses made her heart race. He looked her straight in the eyes and smiled at her teasingly, but she was to terrified to return his smile. The trip lasted several hours, and he held her the whole time, kissing her, and caressing her hair and face, to soothe her, with much the opposite effect. On the whole trip thoughts kept racing through her head, how to get out of this ordeal, how to avoid being so close to him. When they got out in front of her new home, she was quite weak from emotions. She tried not to look at him at all, and just stared at the ground, her whole head red with embarrassment. The luggage was brought up, and the coach was paid without her even looking at her new home. 



She stood in the entry way, and completely missed the smirk the coach gave her new husband, and she didn't look up until Edward had taken of his coat, started a fire in the bedroom fireplace, and went past her to lock the front door from the inside, with an even bigger smirk on his face, than the coach. She had been trying to figure a way out of the whole situation, she was to shaken, the only thing that kept running through her mind was herself promising to honour and obey just the same morning. When she heard the key being turned in the lock, she looked up at him, eyes wide, like a trapped dear, and tried to stammer �I think.. I mean, I don't .. you shouldn't.. you see...� in a very week voice. He walked towards her, as she tried to back away from him. In a few quick steps, he was in front of her, close enough to kiss her, and looking down at her, he put a finger on her mouth, and hushed her. 



He bent down and kissed her again, but this time much more demanding. She felt his lips burn against hers, and his tongue caressed her lips, and met her own, as she opened her mouth in surprise at the attack. Soon she was shaking again, and he stopped, and looked down at her. He seemed to hesitate a little, and she looked at him with pleading eyes, on the verge of tears. In one quick move, he picked her up in his arms, and she was forced to put her arms around his neck, not to fall. He carried her to the bedroom with quick steps, as if she weighed nothing at all. She could feel the muscles&nbsp; in his arms under his shirt, as he moved. She had never even considered what he might look like without clothing, and his strength scared her even more. For the first time it really dawned on her, that she could do nothing against such strength, should she not be able to talk her way out of things. He more tossed, than lay her on the bed, and started opening his shirt. She sat up in the bed, and tried to tell him not to proceed, Eyeing the open door, she got up from bed, and ran towards the opening. She managed two steps, before she felt his strong arms grasp her again, and he threw her back on the bed with a smirk. Tears started running down her face, as she realised her defeat, and again she tried to plead with him, this time even more incoherently through her tears. He finished taking of his shirt, and revealed a muscular chest, sparsely covered in black hair, and two strong arms. Katherine had never seen a man this naked before, and stared at his chest, had she had more time, she might have had an opinion about it, but as it was, she was to horrified to really do anything but be overwhelmed at all the new sensations of the day. He leaned in over her, and whilst pressing his lips on hers again, he started opening her dress, pulling out the string that held it together. She started struggling, but his kisses kept her strangely passive, she pushed him away with her arms, which he first ignored, but when she tried to hold her gown together, he used one hand to pin both of hers, shortly stopping the kiss, to lift her arms above her head. He quickly pulled away the top layers of her clothing, and as she found herself only in her flimsy under dress, she started struggling in earnest. She felt waves of panic rush through her, as she started kicking and wriggling for all she was worth. He pinned her down with his body, effectively immobilising her, and he used his free hand to glide down her arm, over her neck and heaving chest, as he reached her equally heaving bosom, he stopped his kiss, and looked down at her tear streaked face, fixing her eyes to his, as he let his fingertips caress the outlines of her breast. 



She felt violated beyond anything she had imagined, and the slow caress of his hand send electric bolts through her body, feelings she had never before experienced. She looked at him with fear now, his eyes seem to swallow her up, and she was beginning to feel rather light headed with the fear. Had he moved faster, she might have gone through the whole thing without being to concious about anything, but he moved agonisingly slowly, making sure she would feel every second of it. 



He cupped her breast and squeezed it, just hard enough to make her blink, and open her mouth. Then he grasped the flimsy fabric, and tore it from her body in one yank. She closed her eyes from the humiliation, and started crying again. Her arms aching from his rough grip, and her futile attempts of freeing herself. She felt his hand stroke her breasts, and squeeze them again, again submitting her to sensations of such intensity, she did not know what to do with herself. He leaned his body in over her, and placed his mouth near her ear. She could feel his breath on her neck, as he whispered&nbsp; �you are so beautiful, my dear. Stop fighting me, and do as I wish. I am your husband, you belong to me now�. She felt moved by his words, it was as if she heard him speak for the first time, he had been so deaf to her objections, she had almost given up speaking. She felt that he was right, she had married him, she knew he was in his right to use her, her mother had talked to her about it, yet she felt unable to do something that scared her so much. She did stop fighting, opened her eyes, and sobbed out her pleads. �please stop, wait.. I can't.. It's to much�. He lifted his head, and looked down at her, he looked serious and a little angry. �No, we will not wait, I will not stop, and you will do as I say. Do not close you eyes again, and stop fighting.� His tone was demanding, though he did not speak very loudly, she felt as if his words filled her entire world. She dared not close her eyes again, as he eased his grip on her arms, and he kissed her neck, then he let his mouth trail towards her lush breasts, kissing her as he went, gently kissing her breasts all over. She sobbed, but didn't fight or close her eyes, her breathing was shallow, and fast, but again, he was in no hurry, and lingered on her shaking breasts, making his kisses more intense, an lightly bighting her nipples, something that made her whole body jerk beneath him. His hand, which he had let rest on her breast, while he was kissing the other, he now let wander further down, with a feather light touch, he let her know where his fingers where moving. As it glided farther down her belly, she again became nervous, as&nbsp; he moved them past her navel, she jerked her arms, first testing, then again fighting his steal grip around her wrists. He immediately looked up, and looked her straight in the eyes �I told you to stop fighting. You leave me no choice�. With that he got up from her, and she barely managed a sigh of relief, and to cover herself with the shreds of her dress, before he had torn the string that had held her dress free of the fabric. He grabbed both her arms, and wrapped the string snugly around her wrists, finishing with a knot. Now she was crying in earnest, pleading between sobs �I promise, I wont fight, please don't�. He didn't answer her, nor did he pay her any heed, he just pulled her arms and whole body into the middle of the bed, and tied her hands to the wooden connection between the bedposts. He leaned over her again, this time with his face just inches from hers, he looked her in the eyes, as he again let his hand trail from her chest, over her belly, this time reaching her soft pubic hair. She jolted when she felt his hand there, but she was trying her hardest not to panic again, and looking into his eyes had a strangely soothing effect on her. He gently stroked her pubic hair, then he let his hand go further, he could feel her soft labia and a little further down the tip of her clit. She again jolted, gasped, and wiggled a little, as he invaded her body, her eyes looked pleadingly into his, and her lip started trembling again. She pressed her legs so firmly together, that her muscles where shaking from the effort. He lifted a brow, and looked at her sternly, but she only responded with eyes turning moist again. �Open your legs� he commanded, but she just shook her head in horror. 



He got up from the bed, and whilst looking down at her, he removed his pants and undergarments. Had she not been so confused and scared, she might have had the good sense to look away, but she had no idea what expected her, and stared as hypnotised. Whatever she had imagined (which wasn't much, she simply had not cared about the subject) she had not expected what she saw. His dick was big, both in length, but certainly also in circumference, reaching higher than his navel, the bulging head pointing upwards. Edward couldn't help smiling at his virgin bride, tied up in a bed,&nbsp; hair messed up in a halo around her head, face tear streaked, and red eyed, staring with a gaping mouth at his erection. It wasn't before he started climbing unto the bed, and moving towards her, that it dawned on her what it was meant for, and she lost it. Fighting as much as she could trying to get away. He moved fast, and confidently, holding her body with his hand, and spreading her legs with his own legs. She struggled to keep her legs closed, but he was far stronger than her, and he spread them easily. He positioned her shaking legs at his hips, and used his finger to find her opening. He positioned the head of his dick at her tiny whole, and pushed ever so gently forwards. Katherine gasped in pain, she felt like she had a whole arm inside her �nononono! Auhh! Please, I'll do what you say, I promise, please don't!� she begged, looking Edward in the eyes. 

�Stop fighting, you had your chance�, he said, whilst he repositioned her legs, to get a better aim, her thighs now resting high on his hips, he looked her in her eyes, and pushed slowly forwards. First, she tried to fight him of, the pain giving her new strength, she felt like she would be split in half, when it only made the whole thing more painful, she gave up and let her legs be pushed further apart, allowing him to do with her as he pleased. She felt a snap, and a sharp pain, as her hymen tore, and she sobbed a little louder, as she looked into his unrelenting face. As she stopped fighting, and resigned to her fate, he stopped his onslaught, and leaned forward, bringing her lower body with him, he held her head gently between his arms, and bend them, until he leaning on his elbows. �shh.. it's ok, the worst is over� he whispered, and she felt herself again oddly comforted. Still she would have given anything to have the whole ordeal be over. He kissed her gently on the lips, and tilted her head slightly, to kiss her better. She let him, the kiss still sent shivers through her body, and there was something else in her pain and fear now. He slowly started moving again, and it was only marginally less painful, stretching her as wide as she thought possible. Finally he stopped, he was still kissing her now sobbing, but still responsive lips, his testicles now touching her crotch and anus. He kissed her more intensely, and lowered one of his arm, and started caressing her breast, then he started moving. She still groaned with pain into his mouth, but there was not much fight left in her, and after a few gentle strokes, he started to increase the speed. He lifted himself back up, and held her hips with his arm. Soon he was pounding in to her. With each new pump, he made her body quiver, and&nbsp; her breasts bounce. Had he not held her in place, he would have pushed her up the bed. Katherine was breathless, the pain and all the new sensations a blur to her. It seemed to go on forever, she had stopped crying, and was just moaning with each new thrust, Edward, however, was in heaven. He enjoyed the tight grip around his dick, so tight it was keeping him from coming. It took over twenty minutes until he quickened his pace even more, and she felt his dick pulsating inside her. She had been so overwhelmed by the pain and the humiliation, it wasn't until now, that she felt her body tingle, responding to the sensations. She moaned loudly as he stopped to bury himself as deep as he could, and climaxed inside her, eyes closed, and teeth clinched. He lay on top of her, regaining his breath, and enjoying the feeling of her small soft body beneath him. Katherine was stunned. She had only expected pain and embarrassment, the new sensation had surprised her immensely. 

When he finally did pull out, she almost felt a sense of loss, along with the relief. He got up and untied her hands, then he turned of the lamp on the night stand, and with only the half dying fire to illuminate the room, he pulled her with him under the covers. Katherine was very relieved to have her arms let down again, and let herself be held naked in his embrace, for the first time that night, feeling secure. She was still shaking from the ordeal, but with Edward arms around her, and his gentle stroking of her hair, she soon fell asleep from the exhaustion. 



She awoke many hours later, the bedroom was no longer dark, the sun had started to rise, and could be glimpsed through the curtains. Edward was leaning in over her, as she was lying on her back. He had pulled the covers from her body, and he was gently caressing her breasts and belly. Knowing that it was useless to fight, she gently put a still shaking hand on his, and looked at him imploringly. He removed it and put it roughly at the side of her body, whilst giving her a stern look. What could she do, but resign to her fate. His caress brought new sensations this time, without her efforts to avoid them, and being drained of tears to cry, the feelings flooded her, and send jolts of pleasure through her body. As he moved his hands between her legs, and told her to open them, she obeyed. His gentle caress around her clitoris made her whole body come alive, and she moaned in response, turning her head towards his shoulder, closing her eyes, and blushing at the shame. �Look at me�, her commanded, and she dared not but obey him. He continued his caress, following her moans and increasingly ragged breathing to hasten or intensify his touch, until she was panting and covered in a film of sweat, her hands in fists, and her mouth half open. He stopped, leaned over her, and kissed her on the mouth. It was as if her lips where tingling with pleasure, and as he caressed her her whole body, first with his hand, then with his mouth, it was as if her body came alive for the first time. She was shaking in a new way, aching for his touch, light headed with pleasure. It wasn't until he rolled on top of her, and again spread her legs with his knees, that she felt the fear setting in again. She shook her head, and looked at him pleadingly. The fear in her eyes clear, the pain of last night still clear in her mind. Edward didn't hesitate in the least, and completely ignored her weak pleas for mercy. He again positioned the bulging head of his dick at her opening, this time red and swelled from last nights activities, and she gasped in pain at even this light touch. Edward wasted no time, and drove his dick into her with brutish force. Katharine wailed in pain, the walls of her entrance sore and swollen from last night, it was hardly any less painful, even aroused as she was now. She felt every millimetre as he drove into her, and started pumping her again. For the first few minutes, all she could sense was the pain, but after his pumping had increased to a rhythmic pace and her body had grown more accustomed to the onslaught, the feelings of pleasure started emerging. Slowly at first, but as Edward adjusted his pace to her involuntary jerks and moans, it was as if the whole world disappeared. There was only Edward fucking her, driving her insane, his eyes still fixed on hers. Soon she pushed herself against him, still aware of the pain, but no longer caring, she wrapped her legs around him, trying to hold him closer. He gently removed them, and started pumping her for all he was worth. She moaned in response, her feelings intensifying until she came panting and shaking around his dick. He came shortly after, the rhythmic spasm around his dick taking him over the top.&nbsp; Again he let himself lie on top of her, both where short of breath, and covered in sweat. After catching his breath, he lifted his head to kiss her, then look at her, whilst gently brushing a strain of hair, that had strayed onto her cheek from her face. �Good Morning, dear�, he said with a smile at his furiously blushing wife. 

After having cleaned and shaven, he went down stairs, Katherine was to embarrassed to get up before he left the room. When she did, she found all of her muscles sore, and her wrists where bruised and red from trying to escape the string last night. She washed and dressed gingerly, almost not recognising herself in the mirror, her hair standing out to all sides, eyes swollen and bloodshed from all the crying. After her toilette, only her shaking hands gave any indications of last nights activities. So this was what married life was like, she thought to herself. She would have to find some other way to make him do as she wanted, obviously he was not as easy to control as she had thought. But she was not about to give up the reminder of her dream, and be the heart of society, and not least the envy of all. She cheered up immensely at the thought of this, and the daylight coming through the window made last nights activities seem distant and unreal. 

She went down stairs, and found her husband in the kitchen. It was indeed a small house, the furniture and fabrics, though neat and well kept, where cheap and out of style. It was the first time since she arrived, that she took the time to look around her new home. It was small and shabby, she thought, hardly a place one could entertain, but with the money she was sure he would have received from her father, they would be able to afford something more appropriate. Not that she was about to take this up with Edward to soon. 



She was still blushingly avoiding to look at him. He was preparing breakfast, and smiled at her, as she entered. �Come over here, dearest,&nbsp; let me show you how to do this�, he said in a friendly tone. �Why in the world would I want to cook?�, she answered, trying her best to not let her annoyance at such a strange suggestion shine through. He looked op from the pan he was stirring, surprised, and vexed �Now, I told you before we got married: I can not afford a housekeeper with my current income. The only help you will have in the house is the next door boy, who can help you carry when you go to the market, and the like�. In a softer tone, with more patience in his voice, he continued �I will show you everything, I have a few days before I must resume work, and after that, I'm sure some of the women in the neighbourhood will help you, until you have learned everything.�. Katherine looked at him in shock �you want me to do manual labour! But, surely, you must be joking�. Edward felt his patience wearing thin, and with&nbsp; an angry expression on his face, he snapped at her �Come here. NOW!�. Katherine had already had some experience with disobeying him, and she was not about to collect any more, so with a frightened look on her face, she rushed over to him. The rest of the day until lunch went with her being introduced to most of her daily chores, and finding them all utterly disgusting. She dared not object to much, but she tried to express her feelings through a sarcastic tone, and half hearted participation. Edward was getting increasingly vexed at her behaviour, but since she complied with his requests, found nothing overt to be displeased with. After lunch, which they ate in silence, he went and locked the front door, and pulled his wife with him, none to gently. His irritation at her behaviour did not encourage his gentleness, and he pushed her against the wall in the main room, away from prying eyes. He hoisted up her dress, and pulled away her undergarment. With no apparent effort, he lifted her against the wall, and dropping his pants, he pushed into her sore and dry opening. Katherine was utterly flustered and terrified at the roughness of this, helpless as she was, all she could do was wail in pain as he had his way with her. Crying and clinging to his shoulder with her arms, she took it without to many protests this time. The pain was severe, though a tingling feeling of pleasure managed shine through. She did not come, and Edward took his time, using her body as he saw fit, he simply let her drop, as he had finished. 



She lay on the floor crying, as he pulled up his pants. �Now, I'll show you how to keep the floors clean�, he said, and pulled her to a stand by her arm. She barely had a chance to rearrange her clothing, before she was on her knees and hands, washing the floors. The next days she was introduced to the neighbours, and she dared not be anything but polite and friendly, as long as Edward was there. But she felt that it was a humiliating chore, since they where obviously much below her. She had not dared ask him about the money from her father, since she was aware that it was something that would accentuate&nbsp; her fathers home higher standing in society, a subject Edward always abruptly stopped from being discussed. 

He used her often, and most times he did not take the time to make her ready for the treatment. However painful it still was to her, and how humiliating she still found the ordeal, it was not without pleasure to her. Though mostly she started out whimpering and crying, she was normally moaning when he was finishing. Edward saw it as her duty to be available whenever he wanted her, and he was very good at making her fulfil her duties. He had her in any way he found fitting, on the floor, against the wall, on the tables. He had especially enjoyed bending her over a big chair in the main room, and through whimpers and sobs, penetrating her from behind. The rough sex also had the effect of keeping Katherine subdued. When she was about to object, or became sarcastic and sulky about her duties, he would be particularly rough with her, and she would soon be obliging again. 

When the day finally came where he started teaching again, she even managed to cook him breakfast, without burning to much. Edward had made it clear, that he did not intend to do any housework, so Katherine fumbled her way through the chores. She would have some hours to herself in the middle of the day, after eating lunch with Edward. Edward had given her a stack of books for this time. Katherine, however had other plans.&nbsp; Edward had kissed her goodbye, happy in his believe that she had adjusted to her situation. She had been given some money to let her purchase the necessary for dinner and housekeeping. After having tried the preceding day to teach her about the budget, and Katherine had found the subject uninteresting, and could not be persuaded to make a budget for the whole month in any realistic fashion, so Edward had decided to simply give her weekly allowances, and a list of what she was allowed to purchase with the money. Katherine dressed herself in her best informal dress, and happily had the neighbours boy hail a coach, and, giving him a fair share of the money, she send him to the market alone. She called on her friend. Her plan was rather simple, and planning on her husband not daring to disagree with her in front of society much above him, though of course not her, she had decided to get an invitation to stay at her friends mansion, far away from flor scrubbing, coal shovelling, cloth washing and other demeaning activities. Another advantage would be a reduced amount of privacy. Soon, she was certain,&nbsp; they would purchase a more proper place, with servants, at least a housekeeper, from the money her father would surely send her. 



Her friend was pleased to see her, and it was easy to obtain an invitation to stay with them, without mentioning their current situation. Her husband, who arrived for tea, was more sceptical at a married woman, who, without consulting her husband, invited herself, when she was clearly now below them. Katherine was exited at the prospect of enjoying the city as it ought be enjoyed, with lots of money and servants to help her shopping for a new set of clothing, and especially the prospect of all the balls and parties of better society. She returned to home to pack, rather pleased with herself. Soon her husband would learn to do as she wished. In those thoughts, she met the next door woman on her way. She greeted her, and commented on her elegant dress. Katherine enjoyed setting her straight, and asking her not to ever attempt such disgusting familiarity with someone so clearly above her. She rushed by her, and as soon as she entered the house, she pulled out her chest to pack&nbsp; the dresses, she had so shortly placed in the cabinet. Whilst thus engaged, she heard fast steps down the alley, that led to their house, through the open window. Curious, she looked out, and to her freight, saw her husband walking determined towards home, a note in his hand, next to his books and papers. On the way, he lifted his hat at the neighbour wife. She however did a little sarcastic inclination, and turned away. Taken aback at this, he went to talk to her. She couldn't hear what they said, but she could tell that he was infuriated at her words, and they parted after a few minutes on better terms. Katherine started getting nervous. Maybe it would not be as easy as she thought. If she could only convince him of the uselessness of his anger, and make him see that it was unavoidable to do as she wanted without loosing face, she would be fine, she convinced herself. When he was closer to the house, he suddenly looked up, and looked her straight in her eyes, she had never seen him this angry. She hurried away from the window, cursing herself for her curiosity, now he had already gained on her, she had had no time to compose her face, and she was sure she had looked worried, to say the least. So she hurried to practice an innocent, unworried face, and to look engaged in her packing.



 Soon, the door swung open, and he entered. She tried to look up with a smile �Oh, Hello Edward, you are home early, I'll say. I have the most exiting news�. Her voice was a bit shaky, his face was positively darkened, and he glared at her angrily, he had not bothered taking of his shoes, nor his coat. It was the first time she had used his christened name, and she hoped it would sooth him a little. �Well, Katherine, what news would that be�. Katherine breathed a short sigh of relief. She would be allowed to make her case. �The oddest thing, dear. I happened to come upon a friend of mine today, while I was out shopping for a few things.. She simply implored me to.. visit her for some weeks, to help her with a ball she's having. I simply cannot let her down�. Her voice had grown softer, and she found it hard to finish her statement, since Edward had taken of his coat and jacket, and had started rolling up his sleeves. He moved towards her, and she couldn't help but move backwards a little, until she bumped into the bed. �That is odd, considering the note I received this afternoon from her husband. He seems to be of the opinion that you called on them unannounced, and more or less invited yourself�, he said with a snarl.&nbsp; She knew she had to make a stand now, or the battle would be lost. She tried her best to look unconcerned, as she tried to brush past him, he grabbed her arm, and held her, her lips trembled, but she managed to talk in a firm commanding tone �It is of little consequence who called on who, you must see how impossible it is for us to decline such an invitation. Now, if you please. I'm trying to pack a few things�. He swung her around roughly to face him �I had hoped to not have to do this so soon, but you leave me little choice.�And with that, he sat down on the bed, pulling her with him across his lap. Katherine, who had finally worked up her courage to be defiant, flew into a rage, she kicked and screamed for him to let her up, but he gathered her hands behind her back with one hand, lifted her skirt with the other, and then he locked her legs in place with his&nbsp; leg. He let her fight a little, letting her feel how little she could do to change her situation. Then he began to spank her. His hand came down on her bottom with such force, it took her breath away, the sting was terrible. She started fighting him for all she was worth, he continued to spank her. It hurt so much, and she felt totally humiliated. She started screaming at him, calling him by the worst names she could think of. This was not the best method to make him stop, but rather spurred him on. She kicked and screamed until she could stand it no more, and her screaming became crying, and the cursing, begging. Edward stopped shortly after he felt her relax over his knee. �Now, let us see what you have managed in a single day: you have squandered most of the money, you have lied to me, you have disobeyed me, you have snobbed our neighbour, on whom you must rely on, when I'm not there. You have imposed yourself on friends, and schemed against me, behind my back�. His voice was not loud, but she felt his anger. �Please, I'm sorry. But you must see that it isn't reasonable to live as I do now, we could so easily ..�He started spanking her again, slapping her bottom with almost all his strength. �I&nbsp; ..*SLAP*.. will see.. *SLAP*.. no such.. *SLAP*.. thing�. She had started crying, moaning in pain each time his hand impacted on her bottom. �Now, I have sent a message to your friends husband, excusing us from the visit, and you will send your friend a note, apologising for the fact that you cannot keep your promise. Then you will go down and beg our neighbour for forgiveness.� Katherine felt her dreams shatter, and the idea of apologising was more than a little outrageous. She knew she was beat, but couldn't help but plead �Be reasonable, I beg you, I am not fit for all this work. I cannot apologise to someone so much below me�. She feared he would spank her again, instead he paused, and seemed to consider things. She could do nothing but hold her breath, and hope he would see reason. After a few seconds, he instead started undoing her undergarments. When he had bared her bottom, he let his hand rest on her bottom. She was a little sore from the slaps, and she could feel how his big hand almost covered her entire seat. �Now� he said with determination and anger in his voice �Let us bring this behind us. I will not let you actions go unpunished, we shall address the in increasing order of magnitude. Let us start with the money. I think twenty strokes are appropriate� With that he started spanking her, fast and hard. Her bottom was on fire, the stinging was more than she could bare. She tried her best to not anger him by fighting, but she soon started begging his forgiveness. After what seemed like forever he halted, she was lying limp across his knee, sobbing, relieved that it was over. �now, let us deal with snobbing the neighbours, a far more grave sin indeed, one that truly reflects on your pride. What do you think it deserves, wife�. She had started crying when she realised it wasn't over, and it took her some while to understand that he was really asking her. �Please, no more, I promise I will apologise.. I shan't be proud any more, please..� She begged. �No, you will also apologise, it is not part of your punishment. I think seventy strokes will do, since it is your first time. But you are not to fight, and I will have no more pleading�. With that he released her hands, and positioned her on top of both his knees. She had started sobbing in earnest at her impending punishment. Soon he started raining hard slaps on her soft cheeks, only alternating a little from the top of her bottom, to whacking her bottom from below. Katherine grabbed the sheets and yelped at each impact, soon running out of tears to cry. He was hitting her faster, and it didn't take more than a few agonising minutes to finish. She didn't dare move a muscle when he had finished, and he stopped to look at his work. From her tail bone to the top of her thighs, she was bright red, finger marks showed where he had slapped her for fighting, visible in an even deeper red. He grabbed her arm, and stood her up, along with himself. �Remove you knickers, and go fetch me your slippers� He said. She looked at him, both puzzled and scared. Why should she bring him her slippers?. She rightly figured it was not a good idea to ask, and she complied with his request. He threw one slipper to the ground, then asked her to lean over the end of the bed, bottom sticking up the air. She obeyed weeping, and he wasted no time telling her how many she would get, but started whacking her butt with the slipper. It was a rather light slipper, still the sting was worse, and different than his hand. She lost track of how long, and how many strokes. When he finally paused, her seat was even redder, and she had buried her head in the sheets to keep from screaming. �why did I punish you, just now?� He asked. Katherine mind spun like crazy. What was next? �For disobeying you?.� she managed to croak, again not daring to get up. �No, you cursed at me. I never want to hear you curse, and least of all at your husband. It will NOT happen again�. He emphasised the last words with more strokes from the slipper. �Now. Let's deal with your scheming.� With that he again let the strokes fall like rain. She had managed to stuff the sheets into her mouth, but with each rapid stroke, a yelp and sob was still audible. When he finally finished, she was at the end of her wits. He grabbed her again by the arm, and lifted her of the bed. She fell to his feed, as he stood her up, and begged him for mercy. He looked at her with no pity in his eyes, and soon tiring of the drama, he simply picked her up, and dragged her downstairs. She tried her best to keep up, but he was to fast, she she was pulled most of the way. He stood her in the middle of the room, where she hid her face in her hands, not daring to move from where he had placed her. Her bottom was warm and throbbing, but the pain had stopped. The idea of more punishment sickened her, she felt unable to take any more. Edward left his wife in the main room, and when he returned, he placed a leather strap, and horsewhip on the table. Katherine, who had removed her hands, to see her husband return, wished that she hadn't. She knew pleading was useless, resistance or escape would only worsen the situation, so all she could do was shiver and wait. He picked up the horsewhip. �for disobeying me, I will have to give you twenty strokes. Lean over the chair, and pull up your skirt�. She stumbled towards the chair, and bend over, and with shaking hands, she lifted her skirt.&nbsp; �I am sorry, Edward� she wept, whilst trying to brace herself for what would come. Edward stepped up to her, swinging the whip through the air, he brought his arm up all the way, and let the whip crack across her seat. She almost jumped over the chair with this, and wailed as loud as she could, at the second impact, she lost it. Grabbing her bottom with both hands, she jumped up, and tried to escape. Edward stopped her before she managed more than a step. �None of that, now�, he said in a stern voice, as he held&nbsp; her under his arm, bending her over. �I'm afraid we'll have to do those two again�, with that he gave her twenty strokes, each one leaving a crimson line. He spaced them out from the top of her cheeks, all the way down her thighs. Katherine was positively wailing at each stroke. It felt like her bottom was just one big burning mess. When he finally stopped, she still found it hard to breath. He let her hang under his arm a few seconds to compose herself, then he stood her up again, and held her upper arms in a steal grip, as he shook her. �You lied to me. How am I to trust you know? You smiled at me, and lied me straight in my face. Me, your husband, whom you promised to obey just a fortnight ago�. He was angry, and he wasn't afraid to make her feel that. Katherine knew that it was true, and for the first time in a long while, she felt truly sorry for her deeds. She was brought up to believe in the system of the world, a wife should not disobey or lie to her husband. She had dreamed of romance like in the novels she would read, and she knew her heroins would never do as she had done today. She blushed in shame, �I will never lie to you again, I am sorry, I really am�, she said with determination in her voice, beseeching him to believe her. He did look less angry, �no you wont, not when I am finished with you� he said in much to calm a tone. Then he opened her blouse, and exposed her breasts. He picked up the leather strap and started slapping her across the chest, stinging her still youthful breasts with each slap. He continued for a while, she didn't move, she just yelped and cried with each slap. He paused only to remove the rest of her garments. He resumed his onslaught on her breasts, but occasionally landed a strike across her belly and lower thighs. He didn't seem to want to stop at all, and after having turned her breasts a deep red, and he had striped her thighs and belly, she could take no more, and tried to turn and protect herself from the strokes. He followed her, and landed the strokes where ever he could reach. Striking her legs, her bottom, her back and even arms. When he had backed her up unto the sofa, he finally stopped. She was in a ball, weeping and pleading inaudibly. �Open your legs� he commanded. And when she only slowly tried to comply, he pulled her onto her back, and spread her legs for her. Katherine was almost hyperventilating with fear and pain. Edward looked her in the eyes, as he starting bringing the strap down between her legs. The leather lashed both her cunt and anus, again making her wail in pain. He brought it down ten times, only stopping to spread her legs again, when she closed them in panic. 



When he was done, he threw down the strap, and picked her up. He lay her across the backrest of a big reclining chair. Then he left the room. Katherine didn't stop sobbing for a while. Her crotch was on fire, she ached in places she didn't know existed. After some minutes the pain subsided to a throbbing ache, and she heard the door open, and Edward stepping up behind her. She inwardly begged not to be fucked now, she ached so much, and all she dreamt of was being allowed to sleep, to forget about this awful day. Edward roughly readjusted her position, and spread the cheeks of her bottom. He then greased his wives battered anus. Katherine tensed, and started sobbing again. Edward positioned his dick over her small tight butt hole, then he started pushing down on her, using his weight to hasten his entrance. From the first centimetre entered, Katherine was in a world of pain again. Humiliation soon gave way to pure agony, as he relentlessly pushed into her. She found enough strength to wail again, but he didn't hesitate, nor stop for a second, he just pushed his huge dick into her small hole, filling her to the max. As he pushed in the last inch, she screamed hoarsely in pain, pinned down against the chair, she was helpless against him. He did not waste time, but as soon as he felt her grip ease a little, he started pumping her anus. She wailed in pain through the whole ordeal, and it was more than fifteen minutes before he sprayed his semen deep inside her, with a last few brutal strokes. He pulled out, and enjoyed the view of his thoroughly punished wife, fingermarks, red, with welts and a still somewhat gabbing anus, dripping with his semen. He let her hang for a little, then he picked her up in his arms, and carried her to bed. Katherine had no more fight in her, and the prospect of keeping the house now seemed like a very reasonable request. He held her to him, as she fell asleep in his arms.
