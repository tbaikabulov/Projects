Synopsis:  A look into the life of a Dominant woman and the life she has built for herself. Not your typical story...






 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Samantha Smith appeared completely normal to the outside world. As a nurse at the UCSF hospital specializing in ICU, she had a lovely home in Berkley and volunteered her time every month at the free clinic. At 25 she was 5&#8217;4� petite but very curvy with long dark hair, green eyes and a bright smile. She kept her hair cut in blunt bangs circa Betty Paige and accented with long layers. At work it was usually tied back and kept out of the way and at home was kept down and around her face. Her personality was bright and warm but firm. People were drawn to her though they could never have explained why. They saw her as the caring sympathetic nurse who got the job done and worked hard to ensure her patients were comfortable, often working long hours and being the first to stand up for patient rights. Her patients would never have suspected that the person Sam really was was quite different than the person they were used to seeing working tirelessly at the hospital. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Finishing her shift at work she drove from San Francisco to Berkley listening to music and thinking of the things she needed to get done at work. At the end of her day her job was never truly done.&nbsp; Her steel gray Prius was the first thing she had bought herself when she had first gotten into nursing school. Her house being the first big thing she bought after nursing school.&nbsp; She was still undecided about Medical school to become a doctor but knew either way in the next couple of years she would begin working on her Masters. Pulling into her driveway she smiled at the old Victorian&#8217;s appearance. She had slowly been restoring it with her husband&#8217;s help for the last year. It was now a pretty cream color with dark green trim, and landscaped beautifully with flowers and a well maintained lawn.&nbsp; Getting out of her car she grabbed her purse and bag and headed into the house. Unlocking the door and walking in she shut the door and turned back to find the maid finishing up some last minute tidying. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Krystal was 6&#8217;1� regularly and with the 5� stiletto heels she had on she towered over Sam. However Krystal was not a regular woman, or a regular maid she was in fact half man currently. She had begun the change to a woman many years ago but still retained one piece of her born anatomy. However her breasts were completely fake and pushed up rather sluttily in the leather maid&#8217;s costume she wore attached to the black garters. Her hair was in an elegant auburn twist and her makeup perfectly done. Seeing Sam she rushed over dropping to her knees and kissing the ground at Sam&#8217;s feet humbly the skirt of her frilly petticoats slipping up showing off slutty white lace panties.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Welcome home Mistress. Did you have a good day at work?� Krystal asked as she kept bent making sure her eyes were on the floor.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes thank you slut. Take my bag and put the lunch stuff in the fridge. I take it you did what I asked of you today and behaved yourself?� Sam asked as she dropped her bags on the floor and walked forward into the living room. It was done minimally but had numerous pictures and pieces of art everywhere. The couch was big and plush and warm with pillows and throws. A large screen TV was set into the entertainment center complete with a large DVD collection as well as a complete gaming system.&nbsp; It opened up into the dinning room and kitchen. Glancing into the kitchen she saw that Krystal had in fact done everything she had asked her to do, sweeping, mopping and making sure all the dishes were done and put away. The floors were clean, the dusting had been done and smelt of warm vanilla, sandalwood and lavender.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mistress� I did. Sir had me do the bedding in your bedroom as well.� Krystal responded as she picked up Sam&#8217;s bags and started putting things away. Putting the used tuperwhere in the sink to be taken care of later and putting the leftovers in the fridge.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good girl.� Sam said as she walked over to Krystal and pulled her down by the back of the neck kissing her firmly on the lips making the other woman blush and smile. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Thank you Mistress� Krystal responded as she quickly dropped down and kissed the floor at Sam&#8217;s feet. Sam smiled before turning and heading up the stairs towards the upper level. Going down the hall she entered the Master bedroom. It was a warm room done in blood red, a soft golden color and accented with dark woods and black. The bed was a huge king size bed covered in thick pillows and bedding. At the foot of the bed was a large black cage. The carpet was lush and soft to walk on. On one side of the bedroom was a sitting area with a lounge chair and on the other was a desk area with some books and things. On the wall across from the bed was a large flat screen TV. Off to one side next to the large window was the walk in closet and Master bathroom. It was Sam&#8217;s pride and joy. The closet was large and spacious and the bathroom lavish with warm marbels, a shower stall, and large Jacuzzi tub. Stopping in the closet she changed out of her scrubs from work and left on only a black lace bra with matching thong. Walking into the bathroom she washed her hands and looked in the mirror.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her body had once not been perfect but after years of hard work she was finally proud of it. It was toned and smooth and decorated with piercings and tattoos. Her septum was the one facial piercing few saw in addition to her many ear piercings. Her other piercings include her nipples, naval and clit hood.&nbsp; Many people didn&#8217;t realize it but she was in fact missing one of her legs. She had been in an accident a few years ago and had lost her right leg. Many people would have thought that such an active woman like her would have gone deep into depression because of it but now it was a part of her and she did not miss her leg.&nbsp; Turning in the mirror she admired her winding back piece that crawled up her back like dark vines against her pale skin. Smiling she heard someone come into the room and knew it had to be her husband. Walking out of the bathroom and into the main room she smiled as she saw him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Hey.� She smiled as she walked over to him and wrapped her arms around him kissing him firmly. Winding one hand into his hair she grabbed his head and pulled it back hard grinning at him as he let out a sound of pleasure and his submission to her. Biting his neck playfully she released him and moved back to the closet.&nbsp; �How was your day?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Alright, got the last shipment for the SR25 in so I&#8217;ve been tinkering all day. How was work?� Gabriel asked as he moved and sat on the edge of the bed. He was about 5&#8217;6� with a solid build, long dark curly hair, a go-tee and steely blue eyes. Dressed in a t-shirt and Dickies he looked younger than his 29 years. His septum, and tongue were pierced and his ears held plugs. Watching her he couldn&#8217;t help but love to look at his wife. She was incredibly beautiful with all of her imperfections. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It was busy, and stressful as usual. I love it but I can see why so many burn out quickly. We see too much.� Sam replied as she pulled on a pair of lounge pants and a tank top and headed towards the door. �Did you work on your thesis paper today?� she asked as she paused heading out the door.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Uhm� no�� Gabriel mumbled as he looked down knowing she would not be pleased. He was in his final semesters at UC Berkley majoring in business with a minor in Homecare. She had helped him get through the prerequisites it took to get into UC Berkley and continued helping and pushing him to do the best he could. It was something he knew he could never repay.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I see.� Sam said carefully. She was not going to put up with him putting another paper off. The last time that had happened they had been up until 3am doing edits. Most people would have said to let him fail and make the mistake on his own, and she had been tempted, but she believed in him too much to abandon him.&nbsp; �After dinner, the table. Understand boy?� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mistress.� Gabriel answered quickly knowing he was in for it now. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good.� Sam said shortly as she turned and headed downstairs. Going into the kitchen she smiled seeing that Krystal had already gotten everything put away from her lunch and that the kitchen area was practically spotless. Taking the package of chicken out of the sink she began fixing dinner. Gathering various ingredients and pots and pans she started making one of her favorite recipes; Apple braised chicken. �Slut, turn on my ipod.� Sam called as she worked in the kitchen. Krystal hearing her Mistress calling came into the dining area and turned the ipod on at once letting the room fill with music. She then turned and headed back to the downstairs bathroom where she had been scrubbing the floors. Sam grinned pleased that she hadn&#8217;t had to remind her. Getting to work preparing dinner she lost herself in the world of cooking.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Dinner&#8217;s almost ready!!! Slut come set the table and make sure Gabriel is washed up for dinner.� Sam called forty minutes later as the wonderful smell of chicken, apples, potatoes and green beans with nuts wafted through the air.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mistress.� Krystal called as she came into the room. Gabriel entered a few minutes later pushing his hair out of his face as he came into the kitchen.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What did you make?� He asked playfully as he leaned over her shoulder to look. Krystal started setting the table, working quickly to ensure everything was where it belonged. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Braised chicken with apples, potatoes and green beans. I&#8217;ll have iced tea with dinner.� Sam replied easily as she turned and started dishing up the food into serving plates. Handing them off to Krystal she turned off the stove and oven before going and sitting at the dining room table.&nbsp; Waiting for Gabriel and Krystal to bring the rest of the food over she smiled at her little family. The only person missing was Jon and he did not live with them but with his girlfriend. Watching as her subs sat and waited for her to begin dishing up she couldn&#8217;t help but laugh a little as Gabriel handed her a glass of iced tea. �Go ahead.� She said with a grin as she reached forward and dished up her own plate. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dinner passed smoothly with them talking about their day like normal friends. Mind you when you have a woman who used to be a man dressed up in a leather maid uniform dinner is never normal but it was normal for them. Talk ranged from work, to school and various fetish events coming up as well as their numerous friends.Finishing her dinner Sam scooted her chair back and relaxed while waiting for them to finish. She would never rush them as she enjoyed their time together but both her subs could eat quite a bit more than she could. Looking at the clock she glanced out the back door wondering where the dog was. Normally by now she would have been greeted by his cute face begging for a treat.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Has Nova been in today?� Sam asked referring to their black lab/ German Sheppard mix mutt. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No, he&#8217;s been chasing squirrels and getting muddy so I made him stay outside Mistress.� Krystal responded as she took a drink of the water she had in front of her. Gabriel looked down at once laughing slightly knowing Sam would not be happy about that. Nova was her baby and she treated him as such.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�While I appreciate you wanting the house to be nice as I ordered you, you do not ignore my dog slut.� Sam said firmly as she stood and went to the back door. Opening it she called out for the dog. Not five seconds later he came bounding in covered in mud and wagging his tail as he got excited to see his owner. �Aren&#8217;t you just the cutest boy� much cuter than Krystal.� Sam laughed as she knelt down and coddled the big mutt. Letting him lick her face she stood and smiled as he ran into the kitchen tracking mud all over the tile. �That&#8217;ll be for you to clean up as well as him. I suggest you wash him off first in the yard before cleaning the floors�and then of course your regular chores. Don&#8217;t forget to blow dry him as it is chilly out. Nova, sit! Stay!� Sam smiled as she stood behind Gabriel&#8217;s chair and started rubbing the knots out of his shoulders. He always managed to mess his shoulders up something that amused her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mistress. I&#8217;m sorry for ignoring Nova.� Krystal said to her plate and Sam could see that she was almost in tears.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes well as long as it&#8217;s not repeated and you learn your lesson girl.� Sam said as she walked over to her slave and lifted her chin to meet her eyes. �You are such a good girl; it&#8217;s not like you to make mistakes like this. I shall let it slide this once without punishment as you have gone weeks without a single hair out of line. But mark my words girl; if you push me I will punish you. No more gang bangs with the boys club, understood?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mistress! I&#8217;ll be good!� Krystal cried as she looked up desperately at her Mistress. She was a complete whore when it came to being fucked by men. Not that she didn&#8217;t love playing with Sam, but she loved the humiliation of being used by various men, something Sam used to her advantage often. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good girl. Now clear the table before you wash Nova. Gabriel when I come back down from my bath I would suggest that you have quite a bit of work done on that thesis or maybe you and Nova will be sharing a bed tonight.� Sam laughed as she walked out of the room and headed upstairs. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Going to the Master bathroom she lit a few candles and turned off the lights so that in the sunset the room was bathed in golden soft light. She then turned the hot water on letting the bathtub start filling as she poured bath salts and lavender bubble bath in it.&nbsp; Piling her hair on top of her head she stripped out of her clothing and sat on the edge of the bathtub. Undoing the latches on her prosthetic leg she slid it off what was left of her right leg before setting it to the side. Scooting around on the edge of the bathtub she couldn&#8217;t help but let out a slight moan as the ring in her clitoral hood rubbed against the smooth surface causing vibrations to hit her. Carefully sliding down into the bath tub she sighed and relaxed amongst the warm water. This was heaven. She was proud of herself for all that she had accomplished in the last five years. To have lost her leg and have to relearn life and come out on the other side as happy and accomplished as she was, was not an easy feat and she knew she had to thank her husband for it. He was truly the love of her life and she could not have gotten through the things she had without him. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Laying back amongst the bubbles she remembered how hard it had been when she had woken up in ICU&nbsp; and realized her leg was gone. Her mother had been there as had Gabriel. Her mother had burst into tears at once and left the room which was so unlike her that Sam knew something was very wrong. It was Gabriel who had told her. The first words out of her mouth had been �Will I ever ride again?� She loved horses more than almost anything else, Gabriel excluded, and could not imagine never being able to be on the back of her amazing Warmblood, Valiant.&nbsp; Gabriel had told her she would have to ask the doctors when they came and she had demanded that they come at once. Of course she had gotten her wish and they had informed her that her chances of ever being able to compete or jump again were slim to none but that it was up to her if she wanted to ride bad enough she could do it. Gabriel had sworn to her then and there in front of everyone that if it killed him he would make sure she could ride again, even if that meant he had to learn and sit her in front of him. They had cried together then and in that moment Sam had known that he would be the man she married.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Smiling to herself now she couldn&#8217;t have been happier. She was strong and was able to do all the things she had done when she had had her right leg. Sure it had been hard and painful to learn to ride again but she had done it. Now very few people knew she even had a fake leg, she had learned to hide her limp so well. It still pained her at times but for the most part she didn&#8217;t notice it. It had not been the life she thought it would be but it had not been the end of the world either. Relaxing in the bubbles she dozed off and awoke sometime later after darkness had fallen completely. The water was still warm though so she knew it hadn&#8217;t been too long. Pulling herself up and out of the tub was hard but she could do it. Grabbing the towel she started drying her body off as best she could. Once her stump was completely dry she reattached her leg and stood. Drying herself off the rest of the way she wrapped the towel around herself before standing in front of the mirror. Grinning to herself she fixed her makeup and did her hair up in a tight fierce bun like a librarian would wear. Putting blood red lipstick on she walked into the closet and got dressed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dressing in a pair of sheer stockings attached to a black garter she slide a pair of pumps on her feet, thanking technology that she could still wear heels. Pulling a black pencil skirt on and a black lace bra she chose a very simple very sheer white button up shirt and put it on before tucking it into the high waisted skirt. Walking over to the desk she grabbed a wooden ruler and slid on her reading glasses. She grinned in the mirror as she caught her reflection seeing&nbsp; the sexy woman she was before turning grabbing a key off the desk and heading down stairs. She was pleased to see that in her absence Krystal had cleaned everything up and was nowhere to be found. Most likely she had retired to her room with Gabriel&#8217;s permission. Turning the corner she stopped and stood there ominously looking at the dining room table where Gabriel sat working hard. Waiting for him to look up from his laptop she didn&#8217;t have to wait long. Grinning down her nose at him she could see the desire evident on his face. It flashed for half a second before she saw the pain set it at being aroused and being locked away in chastity. Walking forward she saw him gulp as she set the key down on the edge of the table and came and draped herself over the back of his chair.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�How much have you gotten done?� Sam asked as her voiced dropped to a husky purr.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�A couple of pages Mistress.� Gabriel spoke quietly as he fixed his stare on the screen. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�And do you think it&#8217;s ready to be read and edited?� Sam asked as she took one of her manicured nails and ran it over his chest sliding her hand under his shirt. She felt him shiver at her touch and grinned.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mistress, unless you desire me to finish it tonight.� He said carefully as he swallowed hard.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good boy. Let me sit and read it while you fetch me some ice water.� Sam said as she stood and let him have just enough room to move knowing he would have to press against her if he wanted to pass.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mistress.� Gabriel respond at once as he stood and went to move past her. Pressing against her she reached out and cupped his ass bringing him into her and pressing her breasts against him as she brought her lips to his ear.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You get me so wet when you act all sweet and like a good boy.� She purred as she nipped at his earlobe before releasing him and sliding down into the chair. She heard his intake of breath as his cock was squeezed even tighter within the confines of his chastity device. Grinning she adjusted her glasses before reading over the work he had done on his thesis. Reading through it carefully she was both surprised and bummed to see that it was literally mistake free. Taking a sip of the ice water he had brought her she turned to him. �Did you correct this already?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No Mistress, I was careful to do my best work.� Gabriel spoke quickly as he shifted in the chair next to her. Over the years together they had worked hard to help him overcome his learning disabilities and dyslexia. It was not cured nor gone but it had improved greatly to the point where if he was careful you would never have known he had struggled so badly in school.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I see. How disappointing.� Sam replied softly pouting a bit as she turned back to the essay. Remembering the last time she had done this exercise with him she sighed. He had made a great many mistakes and for that she had spanked his ass red and purple with her ruler before sending him to fetch her strap on. She had lubed his ass up before sliding the 7� purple dildo deep into him. Bending him over the kitchen table and pulling him back onto her cock by his hair had gotten her off in so many ways except one. With him locked in chastity still she had laughed when he gasped and felt him so close to orgasm by way of her hitting his prostate. Pulling out she had slide the strap on off and ordered him to stand. Pulling her skirt up she had propped herself up on the table with the skirt around her hips and spread her legs. Demanding that he eat her cunt she had laid back on the table and enjoyed his skilled tongue and tongue piercing to three orgasms before she had had enough. Telling him to clean up the mess and report to her in the bedroom she had made him sleep in the cage that night. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Disappointing Mistress?� Gabriel asked slowly as she stood and closed the laptop after saving the work. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes, I was kind of hoping I would get the pleasure of beating it into you not to make mistakes, but it seems that particular lesson has already sunk in. Strip boy.� Sam demanded as she snatched the key up off the table and turned to him tapping her foot as he quickly peeled his clothes off revealing a couple of tattoos, his pierced nipples, a brand and his chastity enclosed pierced cock straining against the plastic of the Curve chastity device he wore. The Prince Albert cock piercing he wore was another sign of his devotion to her and it sat within the Curve the 2gauge ring through the head of his cock pulled all the way to the tip of the device and threaded through the opening with a padlock locked onto it to keep it in place. Once he was naked she stepped towards him. �But seeing as you have worked so hard to be such a good boy, its time you were given a little treat don&#8217;t you think?� She purred against his lips as she pressed her body against his again moving her hands to the lock on the device undoing it and then moving lower to the PA lock and undoing it as well. Sliding his cock out of it she felt him swell to full erection quickly as she met his eyes grinning playfully and nipping at his lip daring him to move.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What am I allowed to and not allowed to do right now Mistress?� He growled out and she could tell his control was on the edge. She could see the feisty man she had first been drawn to coming out in him and was looking forward to it. He knew she liked it rough, he knew her better than anyone. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You are not allowed to cum without my permission as always, other than that��She teased as she began stroking him and running her nails up the shaft of his cock making it sting. �Game on��
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gabriel let out a feral growl as he grabbed her and practically threw her down onto the table kissing her hotly and passionately. Her hands travelled up his chest scratching and finding his nipples and twisting the rings in them making him arch and cry out in pain as he reached down to her skirt pushing it up and moving between her legs. Her tongue slid out to meet his taunting his as she nipped and sucked at his mouth. Biting down on her tongue he sucked it into his mouth as his hand found her hair and pulled her head back baring her neck. Moving down he bit the side of her neck hard and sucked. Her nails bit into his scalp as she tore him off her neck with a cry of pain and pleasure. But he was ready for her and grabbed her hands pinning them to the table above her head as he tore open her blouse and pulled the lace cups of her bra down. Finding her nipples hard and ready with the rings in them he latched onto one as he twisted the other. Biting down he loved her cry of pleasure and pain and felt her moving against him pulling her skirt up. He knew he had won this round and knew he would not win another again for a long time. But for now he was going to take her and he was going to fuck her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sam moaned and clawed at his back as he bit and sucked at her nipples. She loved the pain and the pleasure of it all. She loved his roughness. Spreading her legs she reached between them and grasped his cock pulling him forward, no longer willing to wait. He hardly needed any encouragement as he pulled back from her breasts and looked down at her laid out before him. Grasping his cock he moved it forward to her dripping wet entrance and rubbed the head against her making her gasp and arch. Letting their piercings touch and tease each other for a second he moved back down to her entrance and shoved in one hard thrust. Sam let out a cry as she gripped the table and arched her back in complete pleasure feeling the ring of his piercing rubbing her deliciously. Reaching up she grabbed him by the back of his neck and brought his mouth to hers kissing him feverishly as he began thrusting into her deep and hard. Her good leg was up around his waist as she took him even deeper moaning out her pleasure.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh god yes Gabriel! Good boy!� She moaned as she broke this kiss and nipped at his lip again. Gabriel moved down to her breasts biting and sucking careful not to leave more than one mark as he would be punished if he did. Thrusting harder he reached down and flicked her clit piercing making her cry out sharply and clench tightly around him. She was completely lost in pleasure by the time her first orgasm crashed over her. Racking her nails up his back as she convulsed around his plunging cock she couldn&#8217;t let out a cry as her entire body tensed. Seeing her in such pleasure he felt himself getting so close.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Mistress please let me cum. Please let me cum in you. I&#8217;ve been a good boy. Please Mistress let me cum.� He groaned as his balls tightened but did not release. Only with her approval could he actually achieve climax, something she had trained him to for a long time.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Cum!� she cried out breathlessly still lost in her own orgasm. Gabriel didn&#8217;t need telling twice and let out a whine as he came hard into her spilling his load deep in her. Clenching and breathing hard they rode out the pleasure together. As the waves of her orgasm subsided she ran her hands up his body cradling him to her on and soothing him. He collapsed against her burying his face in the crook of her neck. Running her hand up to his hair she soothed him and stroked him as they caught their breath.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good boy.� She whispered against his hair as she nuzzled him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Thank you Mistress.� He said as he caught his breath and moved back sliding out of her and standing. Helping her to stand he wrapped his arms around her and kissed her deeply. She allowed it and melted against him. She may have been his Mistress but there were times they were also a couple who loved each other and shared that tenderness. Stepping back she smiled.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Let&#8217;s go to bed, I&#8217;m exhausted.� Sam said as she took his hand and headed out of the kitchen leaving his chastity device and computer on the table. She would deal with it in the morning. Gabriel followed, nodding. Going upstairs she stopped at Krystal&#8217;s room and knocked once before poking her head in to find her laying on her bed in her nighty with her makeup washed off. �You can clean up the kitchen in the morning, the table needs to be lysolled. Sleep well sweet one.� Sam said with a smile as she blew a kiss to her before shutting the door.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Walking down the hall to the Master bedroom she started undoing her skirt. Reaching the room she let go of Gabriel&#8217;s hand and slid the rest of her clothes and shoes off. Undoing her hair and setting her glasses to the side she smiled and climbed up on the bed where he was already waiting. Taking her leg off she crawled in and slid into his arms resting her head in the crook of his arm. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I love you.� Sam smiled up at him as they pulled the covers over them and turned off the lights. Hearing Nova come in she knew he would sleep on the floor at the side of their bed. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I love you too.� Gabriel replied before kissing her one last time. Curling up together Sam couldn&#8217;t help but feel that this was the best feeling in the world. Drifting off the smile on her face was obvious.
Sam awoke the next morning and rolled over finding Gabriel still asleep, his back to her. Smiling she moved closer and snuggled into him wrapping her body around his and spooning him. Nuzzling into the back of his neck she smiled remembering how things hadn&#8217;t always been so easy or so happy. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She had first met Gabriel when she was 19. She had been in her second year of college, struggling to get out on her own and had just gotten out of a long abusive relationship with a man who used BDSM to abuse and use her. Sam remembered that time of her life as the dark days. She had met Gabriel at a party in the spring after she had moved home from living in San Diego. A friend had dragged her out to a party at UC Berkley much to Sam&#8217;s dismay. She was trying to keep up with pre-nursing, working for Starbucks, and feeling better about herself. He had approached her and she had been taken aback by him. At the time she was very down on herself being overweight and unhappy. Sam knew she was pretty but she didn&#8217;t believe anyone would ever truly want her. And here was this guy who was extremely good looking, confident and had numerous women looking at him longingly yet he was talking to her. She had been a little distant and concerned at first but warmed up to him and at the end of the night when he asked for her number she was shocked. Figuring he was just trying to be nice she gave it to him. Leaving with her friends she had almost had a heart attack when he texted her not ten minutes later. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And so they began getting to know each other via text, the phone and online. Their friends clued them in that they were each into the same lifestyle though that they were both submissive. But the more they talked over the next couple of weeks the more Sam felt something waking up inside of her and couldn&#8217;t resist starting to consider that maybe she wasn&#8217;t really submissive. Maybe she had been hiding behind that out of fear and because of her own rough upbringing. Taking control of her life she got herself into therapy and began learning about herself and the things she wanted. The more Gabriel chased after her trying to get her to come down to Oakland and go out with him the more she considered it until she finally gave in. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It had been almost a month since they first met and he had convinced her to come stay the night one day after she was done with classes. Agreeing, they had decided to go to Berkley while he was on a job interview and then get dinner. Meeting him at his house she had forgotten how attractive he was and was drawn to him instantly. Driving to Berkley she remembered not knowing quite how to act. Her last relationship was the only relationship she had been in and to say it was a good experience was a vast understatement. She was nervous and jumpy. Of course she had told him about her anxiety and he was really good about it but she couldn&#8217;t help but keep asking herself over and over again why was this man interested in her.&nbsp; Their first kiss had come in the parking garage in Berkley, he had taken her face in his hands and kissed her firmly but simply on the lips. A thanks for driving since he didn&#8217;t have a car. She had promptly tripped down the stairs. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That night they had cuddled and fooled around a bit but much to her total mortification she had gotten her period something she only found out once his hand was inside her panties. Never before had she wanted to disappear. But then amazingly he had been completely relaxed about it.&nbsp; Falling asleep had been next to impossible. He made her feel so alive, it was like learning how to breath after not realizing you weren&#8217;t.&nbsp; And so they had started seeing each other. He had opened her up to being a Domme but she was so unsure of herself it resulted in a lot of topping from the bottom. Still they had amazing sex and explosive chemistry. Then came the news that he was going to move to the east coast and that he had met someone else. It had hurt. Badly. No they weren&#8217;t together, no she didn&#8217;t love him but she was so attracted to him, and liked him a lot, and had opened herself up to having a relationship with him. So to lose him hurt. It was like once again she wasn&#8217;t good enough. No one was ever going to want her. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They didn&#8217;t speak for two weeks. And then one Sunday he messaged her online joking about how horny he was and how he was bored and joking that she should come over. She knew then that this wasn&#8217;t over, that she was pissed and that she wanted closure. So she had gone down there prepared to have angry sex and ready to move on the next day when it was over. But it hadn&#8217;t gone exactly like she&#8217;d planned. He&#8217;d been gentle and sweet and talked about wishing he could bring her with him. Telling her about the other woman and how she was Poly. Sam had tried so hard to keep her guard up but he had broken down her walls and that night she learned what it was like to truly feel something for someone. The sex had been beyond incredible for both of them and extremely intense. After that night they didn&#8217;t go more than four days without seeing each other. And the sex got hotter and hotter. And she got more and more sure of herself. She convinced herself that she was just enjoying him until he left. And then he was staying. And the other woman was out of the picture. And suddenly she realized she was falling for him. Over the couple of months this had gone on she realized that this was someone she cared quite deeply for and wanted to be with.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;So she told him. And he hadn&#8217;t been ready. So she tried to move on only to have him pull her back and want a relationship. That had been the best time of her life. She turned 20 had an amazingly attentive boyfriend. Got into nursing school for the following fall. Was moving down to the bay area for school. And then she found out he&#8217;d cheated on her. Twice. They had worked through it. No one was perfect. And then he had left her.&nbsp; The pain had been unbearable at first. She was lost and broken and didn&#8217;t know what to do. She felt betrayed by so many of their friends and by him. It took a couple of months but she put herself back together. She moved to the east bay, she continued working hard in school and she made some huge changes. Getting approved for Gastric bypass she took her life into her own hands. Meeting an amazing former Pro-Domme she started learning and training to truly be the Domme that she realized was within her. She pushed herself and learned as much as she could about herself with the help of her therapist. And her and Gabriel remained close friends. She trusted him above anyone. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She started seeing Jon and Krystal that spring and found that she loved being polyamorous. She felt at home with these two toys. Yet the more she learned the more she realized who she really wanted and who was missing in her life. Yes he was there but he was not hers. So when he was finally single again she came to Gabriel one night and claimed him. Smiling into his neck in the present Sam remembered that night clearly.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Getting out of her 2002 Jetta she adjusted her skirt and grabbed her bag and pillow. She knew what had to be done and he knew it was coming he just didn&#8217;t know the extent of it. They had been flirting and toying with each other since they had broken up. Their connection undeniable no matter how much either one of them tried to deny it. They tried to stay away from each other, they had seen other people but they couldn&#8217;t stay away from each other at the end of the day. They didn&#8217;t know what that meant long run but denying it was obviously not working. Walking up to the door she knocked and waited. He knew she was coming&nbsp; and she didn&#8217;t have to wait long for him to come bounding down the stairs. Smiling slowly as he opened the door she was glad she had opted to wear four inch heels. They made her taller than him and that was a good start. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�How are you?� Sam asked slowly her voice a purr as she walked in the door and headed towards the stairs, glancing back at him through her lashes before starting up the stairs. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good, you look � nice. How are you?� Gabriel asked the confusion evident on his face. She had called him a little while ago asking if she could come stay with him that night as she had been having night mares. Of course he had agreed but seeing her now was sending a jolt through him. Resisting her was going to be difficult.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Thanks, just had an interview for a phlebotomy job.� Sam replied as he followed her up the stairs to his bedroom. Walking in she threw her pillow onto his bed and set her bag down before waiting for him to come into the room. Her plan was working out perfectly. Her heart raced behind her chest in anticipation. She felt like a spider setting a trap and waiting, about to strike and capture her prey.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�How did it go?� Gabriel asked as he reached the landing and came forward into the room.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good. Very good.� She purred as he stepped passed the door. Once in the room she moved quickly pushing him back and closing the door pressing his body against it as her hand found her way into his hair and grabbed pulling back and exposing his neck to her. Locking the door with the other hand she grinned. �I think its high time we stop dancing around Gabriel. I will stop at any time if you so choose to safe word me of course, but I&#8217;m done playing games�� She purred as she pressed against him and brought her lips close to his. �I want what is mine.� She growled as a possessive almost feral gleam came into her eyes. She could feel him trembling beneath her touch and laughed deeply in pleasure. Kissing him she bit his lip hard and reached out for his belt undoing it and cupping his cock through his pants. She could feel him stiffening rapidly and knew he wanted this as much as she did. What she didn&#8217;t expect was him to fight her. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His hands came up grabbing her by the shoulders and digging in as he pushed her back his eyes flashing in challenge as he managed to free her grasp on his hair. It caught her off guard but she was ready her eyes flashing and meeting his defiant ones. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�And what if I do not agree? What if I am not ready Sam?� Gabriel said firmly as he kept a firm hold on her arms. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You and I both know that is the fear speaking not you. For once will you let yourself stop being so goddamn afraid and let yourself feel what it is you truly want and then let yourself have it. Your body knows what is right.� She spoke as she ripped her arms out of his and moved back sitting on the bed and crossing her legs as she looked up at him through her lashes.&nbsp; �You have two choices Gabriel� kick me out and you will NEVER touch me again or strip and kneel.� She demanded calmly her voice holding command and power in it.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She watched the look of annoyance pass over his face and saw him contemplate it. She knew there was a chance he would say no. That he would push her away. And in the back of her mind the fear was running rapid. But she pushed it down and refused to show her true fear of his rejection of her. She fixed him with a look of playful power daring him to tell her to get out while she kept just enough of a smile to entice him. The intensity of their gaze would have been enough to make anyone run and cower. She held his eyes unblinking, unflinching willing him to do as she wanted. The minutes ticked by and finally she saw him give in, his eyes dropping as he looked away and for half a second she waited to hear him tell her to get out. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Miss� he mumbled as he pulled his shirt up over his head. In that brief moment he did not see her face she let the relief flood across it. The relief she felt washed over her. She had truly been terrified when coming here half convincing herself he would never want to try again that she was foolishly in love with a man who would never love her. But at his submission her heart leapt for joy knowing now that he was hers. She would have him and claim him. Grinning she watched him strip quickly admiring his body and feeling herself grow moist as he stripped completely showing her his hardening cock. Oh how she loved his cock. Tapping her foot she waited as he knelt before her head down. Chuckling she uncrossed her legs and stood towering over him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Kiss the toe of my heel boy. Show your Mistress how you want to please her.� She demanded as she looked down on him. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mistress.� He said quietly as he bent forward and kissed the toe of her heel.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good boy. Stand and bend over.� She demanded of him as she walked around him and picked up her bag. Moving back to his bed she set it down and opened it as he stood and bent over his ass facing her.&nbsp; �I am going to punish you for teasing me all these months. I have not enjoyed it boy. Your constant come here go away come back routine. I will not stand for it any longer. At the end of this night we will talk about the details of what this means boy but I am done playing this game. Do you understand?� she asked as she moved forward and ran her hand over his ass grinning as he trembled slightly
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mistress I understand. I&#8217;m sorry Mistress.� Gabriel said quickly. She knew he must have a thousand thoughts running through his head but she was surprised he was allowing this so easily. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good boy. Now don&#8217;t forget to count and thank me.� Sam grinned as she pulled her hand back and snapped it back against his ass in a firm spank. She wanted to warm his flesh up and see just how much he could take. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�One thank you Mistress.� Gabriel responded after a brief intake of breath. Snapping her hand back she spanked him again.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Two thank you Mistress� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Three thank you Mistress�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�F-Four Thank you Mistress� Gabriel gasped out as Sam increased the force and snap feeling her hand heating up.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Five thank you Mistress�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�SIX thank you Mistress&#8217;&#8217;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Seven thank you Mistress�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Eight thank you Mistress�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Nine Thank you Mistress�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Ten Thank you Mistress� Gabriel gasped out as Sam stepped away.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good boy. Stay� don&#8217;t think you are done yet.� Sam said with a grin as she reached into her bag and pulled the flogger out. �Continue counting.�&nbsp; Sam demanded as she smoothed out the strips of the flogger before winding and swinging bringing it down upon his ass with a quick flick.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Eleven Thank you Mistress� Gabriel gasped out as the new stinging sensation washed over his already hot backside. His pale skin was turning a beautiful shade of red. Swinging again she brought the tails of the flogger down on his back side again and again delighting in his jumps and twitches.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Twelve thank you Mistress.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Thirteen thank you Mistress.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Fourteen Thank you Mistress�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Fifteen thank you Mistress.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Sixteen thank you Mistress.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Seventeen thank you Mistress.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Eighteen Th-Thank you Mistress!� Gabriel gasped out as she add harder blows bringing them across his flesh harder.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Nineteen Thank you Mistress.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Twenty Thank you Mistress.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Is your poor ass stinging boy?� Sam taunted as she laid the flogger out on the bed and pulled the paddle out of her bag. Going over to him she ran her nails over his ass watching him twitch and arch his back trying to relieve the sensitivity while still trying not to move. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mistress� Gabriel mumbled as he leaned into her cool fingers. Moving swiftly she brought the paddle hard on his ass. The resounding crack echoed around the room as did his cry of pain.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Twenty-one thank you Mistress� Gabriel gasped out hardly able to get his vocal chords to work properly. Sam couldn&#8217;t help but giggle as she brought the paddle down. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Twenty Two Thank you Mistress� Gabriel gasped out. Sam could feel him reaching his breaking point and grinned rubbing her cool hand over his now hot backside. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Do you feel bad for teasing me for so long boy?� She asked him calmly as she racked her nails against his skin scratching lightly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mistress of course.� Gabriel gasped as he trembled against her touch. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Stand boy.� Sam demanded as she set the paddle aside and turned him to face her. Reaching out she cupped his balls and stepped close to him bringing her lips to his neck near his ear and nipping. �Tell me what you want.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�To please you Mistress. You&#8217;re right this is what I want. Please Mistress use me.� Gabriel begged softly as he leaned into her touch. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good boy. Lay on the bed. And spread your legs and put your hands above your head.� Sam said with a grin as she stepped away from him and reached down into her bag pulling out a pair of handcuffs and too lengths of rope. Moving up the bed she took his hands and slid the cuffs on one wrist before threading them through the bored and headboard and cuffing his other hand tightly. Moving down she kissed him hotly on the lips nipping his bottom lip before trailing her lips down his body kissing and licking her way to his nipples. Taking one of his nipples into her mouth she sucked hard before biting down. Hearing his intake of breath she laughed against his skin and pulled back kissing and licking her way lower. Pulling back she moved lower taking each of his legs in turn and tying them spread apart. Standing up she looked down at him and couldn&#8217;t help but grin at her handy work.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Too bad I didn&#8217;t bring anything to pierce you with� I have you here completely at my mercy.� Sam grinned as she started undoing her skirt and peeling her top off.&nbsp; Wearing a red lace bra and black panties she moved up over the bed. Watching him she reached down and flicked his balls gently. Hearing his sharp intake of breath she grinned and flicked the other ball. �Maybe I should pierce these�� She taunted and laughed when she saw his eyes widen.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Please no Mistress�� Gabriel begged quietly as she continued fondling and squeezing his balls and rubbing his cock&nbsp; gently. Raking her nails up the shaft of his cock she used her other hand to pinch and twist his nipple. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What do you want me to do now boy?� Sam asked as she shifted over him and nipped at his nipple again.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Use me Mistress�� He begged quietly. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�How?� Sam asked as she shifted moving away from him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Sexually, use me for your pleasure.� Gabriel begged as he pulled against his bindings. �Please Mistress, I&#8217;ll be good Mistress.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Of course you will.� Sam grinned as she moved over him straddling his hard cock and moving her panties to the side. Rubbing her wet pussy against his cock she watched him. �Beg me to let you inside me boy.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Please Mistress let me be inside you. I&#8217;m dying to feel you around me Mistress.� Gabriel begged as he pulled against the bonds pushing up against her. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sam didn&#8217;t answer him with words but moved him against her entrance and slid down slowly. Moaning as she felt him sliding into her she arched her back at the pleasure of having him inside her again. It was like coming home. Reaching back she undid her bra freeing her large DDD cup breasts for him. Moving against him she leant down and kissed him nipping at his lip and opening her mouth as her tongue came out to meet his. Their tongues rubbed against each others as she rode him and moved up and down on his cock. Reaching up she released the handcuffs and pulled back breaking the kiss and bringing one of her nipples up&nbsp; to his mouth. He took the hit and sucked her nipple into his mouth biting down gently and rubbing his tongue against her. Sam arched her back in pleasure moving harder against him as she reached down and twisted his nipple. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Please Mistress I&#8217;m going to cum�� Gabriel gasped suddenly as the pleasure and overwhelming intensity of the situation crashed over him. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Cum boy.� Sam demanded as she clenched her inner muscles around him knowing he couldn&#8217;t help it. He let out a cry as he tensed under her spasming and arching his back as he came inside of her. Sam rode him grinding her hips down on him and riding out his orgasm. Relaxing down against him as he finished she nuzzled his neck&nbsp; and let him catch his breath. Moving off his cock slowly she grinned down at him as she moved up his body. �But now you are going to eat your cum out of me and make me cum.�&nbsp; She demanded.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mistress� Gabriel gasped out as she moved over his face, lifting herself over him and then lowering her pussy down to his mouth. Feeling him suck at her entrance she moaned feeling his tongue delve into her and swirl his dripping cum. Sucking and licking at her he rubbed his nose against her clit causing her back to arch as she started moving carefully against him. She felt herself getting close quickly and had to grab the headboard to steady herself as moved against his face harder. Arching her back she let out a cry as she came feeling him sucking the mixture of his cum and her own juice out. Cumming hard she tried to steady herself to keep from crushing him as wave after wave of pleasure rushed over her.&nbsp; Coming down from her orgasm she moved back off of him and knelt undoing his feet before crashing down next to him. Pulling him to her she wrapped herself into his arms cuddling him close and kissing him softly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good boy.� Sam said quietly. Laying there they calmed down in silence enjoying the feel of each other&#8217;s arms. Sam could help but feel the relief crash over her. She had been terrified he would push her away the way he had been for the last few months.&nbsp; Now that he had finally given in she felt the joy spreading throughout her chest. But also the fear. What if he wasn&#8217;t ready? What if he wasn&#8217;t really serious?�&nbsp; �Are you ok?� she asked quietly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yeah, I&#8217;m just overwhelmed. What just happened?� Gabriel asked slowly as he looked at her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I proved that I can handle you. Gabriel, I want to be with you. We should be together. Look at everything that has happened over the last few months.&nbsp; And still we feel like this. Why do you think that is?� Sam asked slowly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I don&#8217;t know. What if I&#8217;m not ready for this?� Gabriel asked slowly as he watched her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You wont know if you dont try. But here is what I know. Life is short and god forbid anything ever happen to one of us, but I don&#8217;t want to wonder what could have been. I know things are going to be hard and we&#8217;re going to have to figure out what works and what doesn&#8217;t. But I don&#8217;t want to regret anything. I&#8217;m not going to beg you but listen to your heart. You cannot stay away from me. The last year has proved that. You&#8217;re as addicted to me as I am you. You&#8217;re just scared. So push through it and grow up Gabriel.� Sam said as she looked at him letting her frustration come out.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m scared.� He said slowly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yeah well so am I. But there is never a good time to be with the person you love. I&#8217;m not saying I&#8217;m in love with you, but I do love you and I do think we could be amazing together. Look at how much chemistry is still between us. You&#8217;ve tried to deny it but it doesn&#8217;t work. This is natural it just works.� Sam said simply. She saw conflicting emotions cross his face before he sighed and smiled slightly
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You&#8217;re right. I don&#8217;t want to keep fighting this. We&#8217;ll figure it out.� Gabriel said slowly before pulling her to him and kissing her. �You weren&#8217;t really having nightmares where you?� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No. Definitely not.� Sam laughed.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Smiling as she nuzzled Gabriel in the present she remembered how hard it had been after that. How they had almost broken up numerous times. But it was all worth it now. Smiling she closed her eyes and dozed in the morning light taking in his smell and realizing that she was a lucky woman. Many told him how lucky he was to have her, but the reality was she was lucky to have him too.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Waking up an hour or so later to Nova barking downstairs Sam grinned feeling Gabriel awake next to her. He turned in her arms facing her and pulling her close. Snuggling into the crook of his arms she smiled at how many would disapprove of this exchange. Yes he was her submissive and yes she was the Dominant, but that didn&#8217;t mean she wasn&#8217;t also still a woman who wanted to feel the comfort of the man she loved arms around her. It didn&#8217;t mean she didn&#8217;t have vulnerable moments. It didn&#8217;t mean sometimes he didn&#8217;t have to take care of her. And many people looked down on her for having such a romantic relationship with him. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I suppose that&#8217;s our cue to stop laying in bed.� Sam grinned as she looked up at Gabriel their noses close to touching. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Krystal can let him out.� Gabriel muttered as he pulled her even closer.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Krystal is at work and you have class soon.� Sam said firmly as she looked at the clock seeing that it was 9am. �And I have to go to a meeting for the clinic. So no, you can go let Nova out while I lay here and enjoy myself.� Sam grinned as she poked him in the ribs gently and playfully.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I don&#8217;t want to go to class, can we just blow everything off and stay in bed?� Gabriel whined as he rubbed his hardening cock against her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Nope. You haven&#8217;t earned it! Get up.� Sam laughed as she rolled away from him. He rolled after her grasping her around the waist and pulling her back, tickling her and playfully biting her arm. �Get off me you mutt!!!� She shrieked in laughter as she writhed trying to get away from his tickling. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Pwwwwwease �� Gabriel teased as he wrapped his arms tightly around her holding onto her like a small child would hold onto his&nbsp; mother.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No! And if you continue being a brat I&#8217;m going to have to punish you like one.� She said her tone becoming more serious but still holding a playful tone to it.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Maybe that&#8217;s what I want�� Gabriel pushed teasing and nuzzling her, his voice becoming that of a spoilt child.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Maybe you had better go let the dog out before a beat your ass. And take a shower.� Sam said becoming serious. As much as she wanted to give into him and play she knew they had things to get done that day. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Fine.� Gabriel groaned hearing her becoming serious and knowing he wasn&#8217;t going to get anywhere at the moment. Plus she was right he did have to go to class. He hated when she was right. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�If you&#8217;re going to pout you can go get the cane now.� Sam pushed as she sat up in bed and sat on the edge reaching for her crutches. As much as she knew he was playing he could very quickly become an actual brat.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m sorry Mistress, I&#8217;m going.� Gabriel said with a sigh as he got out of bed and went to the closet grabbing a pair of scrub pants that he used as lounge pants before leaving the room calling to Nova. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sam rolled her eyes as she stood and crutched to the bathroom. Turning the shower on she turned back to the mirror letting the water warm as she took last nights makeup off and combed her hair out. Going to the large glass shower stall she set her crutches off to the side and used the special pulls on the shower to balance herself. Opening the shower she maneuvered herself in using the hand grasps around the shower to keep herself balanced. Moving into the spray she placed herself strategically and caught her balance. Since loosing her leg her overall balance had approved greatly. Letting the hot water crash over her she started washing her hair and body. Rinsing she heard Gabriel come into the bathroom as she was applying conditioner. Hearing the stall door open she grinned as he stepped into the shower. It wasn&#8217;t often that they did this but she felt her desire for him washing over her. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Let me help you Mistress� He said deeply as he stepped towards her. Letting him come to her she grinned as he pulled her wet body into his running her hands up his chest.&nbsp; He cupped her ass lifting her slightly as he walked them back against the warm wall. Pressing her into it he kissed her hotly before moving his lips to her neck and then lower to her breasts, capturing her nipple and sucking it. Rolling his tongue against the nipple jewelry she wore she couldn&#8217;t help but moan as he manipulated her body easily. She was quickly getting more and more turned on and more and more ready to be pleasured. Finding the grips on the wall she grasped them letting her body rest back against the warm marble as he moved his hand up to cup her hot pussy. Looking up at her as he manipulated her nipple and rubbed lightly at her pussy lips Sam couldn&#8217;t help but let out a moan as she saw his eyes flashing in pleasure and triumph. She would have to get him later for making her want him like this.&nbsp; Watching him pull back and kneel she was delighted when he started caressing her amputated leg. 
Rubbing what was left of the muscles in her thigh he leant forward and kissed along the scars where they had cut her leg off. Licking kissing and nibbling along the scar Sam watched his eyes seeing how caring he was and how turned on he was by her amputated leg. Rubbing up and down her stump and caressing it she moaned feeling the pleasure of being pampered like this. He rubbed his cheek against her inner thigh teasing her and biting her inner thigh hard and sucking. The pain made her cry out as she reached down with one hand and gripped his hair pulling him away and making him pull at the sensitive skin. Kissing it gently he grinned and kissed his way over her leg again nuzzling it and rubbing the muscles helping them to relax with the heat and the delicious pressure of his thumbs. Needing more she reached to him pulling him up and kissing him deeply before letting him go back to her nipples as he once again cupped her pussy.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sliding his fingers between her moist lips he bit against her nipple as he slid two fingers against her entrance feeling her wetness and making her move against him. Sliding his fingers into her he moved his thumb up against her clit rolling it around and flicking her jewelry lazily as he thrust his fingers in and out of her slowly. Sam let out a sigh of pleasure as she leant her head back against the wall of the shower rolling her hips against him and moaning. Feeling his tongue trailing lower she spread her legs as best she could in anticipation. He didn&#8217;t disappoint as he kept his fingers pumping in and out of her pussy moving harder and deeper before taking her clit into his mouth and sucking and swirling it with his tongue. Letting out a cry she gripped the wall hard. Manipulating her he felt her shaking against him getting close to orgasm. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Fuck me.� Sam begged as she felt herself getting close but needed more. �Get up here and fuck me Gabriel.� She demanded of him as she looked down at him. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She didn&#8217;t have to ask him again as he stood and pinned her against the wall and moved between her legs, her stump making it easier. Pushing the head of his cock against her he grinned and thrust in hard. Sam let out a loud cry that echoed as he pushed hard into her. He didn&#8217;t wait long before pulling back and thrusting in harder his piercing scrapping along the walls of her pussy in a painfully pleasurable way that made her see stars. Letting out a moan he began thrusting hard and fast into her over and over again driving her quickly to orgasm. Moving against him she rode him as he continued thrusting into her over and over again. Her pussy clenched around him tightly milking him and driving him to orgasm as well. Reaching down he started rubbing her clit hard and fast manipulating the jewelry completely pulling and flicking it. Sam let out a scream as her orgasm suddenly crashed over her&nbsp; making her have to hold herself up against the wall as her body spasmed in total pleasure. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh god yesssssss. Cum with me Cum!� She ordered him as she rode out her total pleasure. Gabriel let out a cry hearing him ordering her to cum and thrust hard two more times before cumming hard into her. Pinning her against the wall her buried his face in her neck as he came straining against her in pleasure. Coming down off her orgasm she took a couple of deep breaths as she felt him tense against her. Holding him in her for a few minutes she bathed in the joy of morning sex. Pulling out and stepping back a few minutes later Gabriel stepped away from her making sure she was steady on her leg. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Thank you Mistress.� He said with a smile as he stepped under the spray of the water. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Thank you boy.� Sam said with a smile as she watched him under the spray. Moving towards him she got under the spray as well and rinsed her hair and body again before grabbing the soap and starting to wash him. Helping her he enjoyed her touch as she washed his body. Starting with his shoulders she rubbed circles with her hands massaging him as she cleaned him. Running her hands over his torso and back she made sure not to miss a single spot taking the time to rub his now flaccid cock and balls and making sure his ass was clean as well. Washing his hair she smiled enjoying the time with him. She scrubbed his scalp gently and ran her fingers through his long hair. Gabriel grabbed the soap and washed her body again as well working the soap over her arms, leg breast and making sure to rub her clit as he washed her pussy and ass before rinsing off and helping her rinse. Helping her out of the shower he helped her stay steady while she dried off and wrapped her hair in a towel. Once she was steady he took time to dry himself off as well.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�How long is your meeting going to be?� He asked as they went their separate ways in the bathroom getting ready for the day. Sam went to work doing her makeup and hair while he got dressed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�A couple of hours then I was going to go to Berkley bowl for groceries and then come home.� Sam answered easily as she put lotion on.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Alright. I have class until three. So I&#8217;ll be home then.� Gabriel said as he towel dried his hair. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�When you get home if I am not here, check on Nova and then work on your paper until I get home. I want to play tonight so tell Krystal to be ready as well.� Sam said with a grin as she pulled out the blow drier and started drying her hair. Finishing getting ready she knew Gabriel would make sure not to displease her. Dressing in a pair of jeans and a t-shirt she headed downstairs. After a quick breakfast she kissed Gabriel goodbye before heading out to her meeting. Normally she would have locked him in chastity but figured a day out would be a good thing.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The meeting with the clinic was long but they made good progress. Sam was glad to be done though. Going to the grocery store she picked up some items that they had needed. Going through her list of things she opted to get a couple of extra things including some fresh cut flowers. The Lilies were beautiful and she knew they would make her smile. Finishing up she drove home to find Krystal home early.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What are you doing home?� Sam asked as she walked in the door carrying bags of groceries. Krystal stood and rushed over taking some of the bags. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�The office power got shut off because of electrical issues. So I&#8217;m home early. Are there more bags in the car?� Krystal asked brightly as she walked towards the kitchen and set the bags down.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh bummer. Yeah there are. Lock up when you&#8217;re done.� Sam said with a smile as she set her bags down and started unpacking the groceries. She knew that she could make Krystal do it but sometimes she enjoyed the simplicity of the tasks. Putting things away she waited for Krystal to come in with the rest of the bags and the flowers. Hearing her come through the door she went around the counter to help her with the last of the bags. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�These flowers are gorgeous.� Krystal said with a smile as she set the bags down and handed Sam the flowers. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Thanks, I thought they would be cheery. Put the rest of the groceries away while I get these in water.� Sam said as she grabbed a vase from under the sink and started cutting the ends off the lilies and putting them in water. Setting the vase on the table she turned and watched Krystal who was still in the kitchen putting groceries away.&nbsp; She was dressed in a business suite with a low cut white shirt stretched over her big fake tits. Grinning at how sexy she found man made woman she stood and walked towards her. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�When is the last time I showed my favorite little slutty bitch any attention?� Sam asked as she made the older woman look down at her. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I don&#8217;t remember Mistress? A couple of days?� Krystal said softly as she looked down humbly. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Come on slut.� Sam said with a playful smile as she took the other girls hand and led her out of the kitchen. Going down the hallway downstairs she led her to the dungeon. It was the guest bedroom formally but they had converted it when they bought the house. Now sound proof with a wooden floor , the room could be used as a guest room if necessary but was mostly used as the dungeon. Walking into the room Sam turned on the lights, leading Krystal forward before stopping. �Strip girl.� She demanded as she left the door open for when Gabriel got home. She wanted him to hear what was going on before he saw it. And she knew he would be home soon.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Walking into the room she looked around trying to decide where the best place was to play. The room was large and spacious with a double bed on one side. But this was not just any bed it was a special bed made of iron with four posts and a special canopy. It was made specifically for bondage and suspension. Of course it could also be made to look like a strange four poster for when company was over.&nbsp; Around the room there were a number of interesting pieces of furniture. A doctor&#8217;s table complete with Gyno exam addition, a spanking bench, medieval shackles and a school desk were the standouts. Along the walls veryng instruments hung including whips, canes, floggers, paddles, crops, and switches. Various tool boxes and chests stood around the room as well. It was a dream room for Sam and her slaves.&nbsp; Turning to Krystal she grinned knowing just what she wanted to do with her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Come here girl.� Sam ordered the redhead as she looked at her. Krystal came over to her and dropped to her knees at once keeping her head down. �Good girl. How do you feel about doing some fisting work today girl?� Sam asked. It was easy to order the tranny to do what she wanted but with this particular favorite of hers she wanted to make sure Krystal was feeling ok and had had a regular bowel movement. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�If that would please you Mistress I would love to try and stretch even more for you.� Krystal responded quickly and eagerly letting Sam know that not only was she feeling alright but she was eager to do it. Krystal was newer to fisting and they were still getting her stretched. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good girl. Go fetch the puppy training pads while I set up the enema for you so we can get you cleaned properly.� Sam said as she walked around the girl. Going to one of the cabinets on the wall she opened it and pulled out a box labeled �Slut� within it contained Krystal&#8217;s enema supplies including the � gallon sack, tubing and nozzle. From the same cabinet Sam grabbed a pair of latex gloves and some lube.&nbsp; Going over to the bed she watched as Krystal crawled towards the bed carrying a large puppy training sheet. They weren&#8217;t necessarily the&nbsp; most glamorous fetish item but Sam had found the absorbent sheets worked well when giving enemas. With the bathroom right across the hall it was the ideal setup.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Lay the pad on the bed and then lay back girl.� Sam ordered as she set the supplies on the bed before going to the bathroom to fill the bottle. Letting the water get luke warm she added salt to it to allow it to absorb more easily into the girl. Filling the bottle she capped it and carried it back in the room to find Krystal laying back on the bed with her legs dangling over the edge, ass ready to be filled. �Good girl.� Sam said with a grin as she looked down on Krystal&#8217;s non-responsive cock. Attaching the tube to the bag and hanging it on the bed hook so that it couldn&#8217;t drain yet she moved to grab other supplies. Pulling on the pair of latex gloves she attached the nozzle to the hose. Turning the bag over and hanging it to drain she let some of the water squirt out onto the wood floor before clamping the hose shut. Krystal could clean it up later.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Picking up the lube she uncapped it and squeezed some onto the nozzle before putting some on her finger. Stepping between Krystal&#8217;s long legs she pushed them up to rest on the bed, her feet braced on the posts spreading her wide and giving Sam easy access to her ass hole. This was a practiced position and one they had found was the most comfortable. Rubbing her finger against Krystal&#8217;s well used asshole she easily slide the lubed up digit within her. Grinning she moved the nozzle up to her opening and slid it easily within the girl&#8217;s rectum. Moving her hands out of the way she grinned down at the other girl as she soothed her rubbing her inner thigh gently with her hand.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Ready slut?� Sam asked with a grin as she met the other woman&#8217;s eyes.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mistress.� Krystal responded breathlessly as she relaxed against the bed knowing what was coming. Sam laughed quietly as she unclenched the hose and let the water rush full force into Krystal&#8217;s ass. Hearing her sharp intake of breath she grinned and continued rubbing soothing circles over her lower abdomen. She could feel the water rushing from the hose and grinned. �How does that feel girl?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Shocking every time Mistress. But good. Thank you Mistress.� Krystal said as she breathed through the filling of her rectum. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good girl. Breath through it and relax. Tell me if it gets to be too much.� Sam said as she glanced at the bag seeing that it was draining at a fairly good rate. Not too fast or too slowly. Having spent time as a sub and having still enjoyed the occasional enema she knew what this feeling was like. Keeping her demeanor warm and calm as she did with patients at work she soothed Krystal and watched her breathe through the cramps and feelings of fullness that always came with the deep cleansing properties of an enema. As the bag started getting down to the last bits she heard Gabriel coming home. �How humiliated are you to know he is going to walk in here any minute to see this slut?� Sam taunted.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�He has seen it before Mistress.� Krystal tried to say though Sam could see the blush creep over the other woman&#8217;s body. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Don&#8217;t lie Krystal. We&#8217;re in here boy! Come in here now and strip and wait while I finish with the slut.� Sam called loudly to Gabriel as she reached up and grasped the enema bag squeezing gently to increase the pressure slightly. Hearing Krystal&#8217;s intake of breath she giggled. �Take it all girl and then you&#8217;re to hold it understand?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mistress.� Krystal answered at once just as Gabriel walked into the room.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mistress.� Gabriel said quietly as he quickly started stripping. Piling his clothes next to Krystal&#8217;s he dropped to the floor and knelt there with his head down. He had known this was coming and could feel Sam&#8217;s Dominant energy radiating off of her. He knew she was getting into her zone and crossing her would not result in anything good.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good boy. Go get your enema bottle and prepare it with lukewarm water and salt. Quickly boy.�&nbsp; Sam said as she emptied the last of Krystal&#8217;s enema into her. Pulling the nozzle out slowly she grinned as she felt the other woman clenching her ass down hard in an attempt to not loose a drop. She knew that if she did Sam would punish her for it. Sam also knew that sometimes it was impossible. Gabriel quickly got his own enema set identical to Krystal&#8217;s and rushed to the bathroom to fill it. �How do you feel girl?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Full Mistress. Like I&#8217;m going to burst.� Krystal said quietly as she breathed in deep breaths trying to keep her body calm. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�When he comes back you may go empty yourself girl.� Sam said with a smile as she stepped away from the other&nbsp; girl and gathered the used enema supplies. Setting them within their box again she set the over on one of the chests to be cleaned and dried later. Going to the cabinet she threw her used gloves away before grabbing another pair of latex gloves. Hearing Gabriel come back into the room she laughed as she watched Krystal jump up off the bed and rush into the bathroom shutting the door quickly. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Hand me the bottle and lay back on the pad. The slut was a good girl and didn&#8217;t spill a drop so there is no reason to change the pad.� Sam grinned as she came over to the bed taking the enema bottle and Gabriel&#8217;s kit from him. He was already half hard something that Sam wasn&#8217;t sure to laugh at or be annoyed at. He was turned on entirely too easily.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mistress.� Gabriel said quickly as he got up on the bed and laid back in the same position that Krystal had just been in.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Do you feel ok for doing some fisting play tonight boy?� Sam asked as she prepared the enema for him. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�If that would please you Mistress. My body can handle it.� Gabriel responded knowing that he could take it. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You like having my fist up your ass don&#8217;t you?� Sam taunted as she walked towards him hanging the enema on the hook right side up so it wouldn&#8217;t drain and leaning over him pressing her clothed breasts against his now hard cock.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mistress.� Gabriel answered quickly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Tell me why boy.� Sam demanded.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Because its so wrong that it should fit up there Mistress but it feels so good being so completely taken and violated by you Mistress.� Gabriel answered quickly as he resisted pressing up against her as she leant over her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Such a naughty little ass slut.� Sam laughed as she stood and walked to the door of the room. �How are you doing slut?� She called to Krystal.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Ok Mistress� I&#8217;ll be done in a few minutes.� Krystal called back through the door.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sam grinned and walked back to Gabriel pulling a pair of gloves on she lubed up the nozzle and a finger and inserted them one at a time. Grinning down at him she unclenched the tubing and allowed the flow to flow into him. Hearing his intake of breath was like music to her ears. As she had done with Krystal she soothingly rubbed circles along his lower abdomen helping him to relax and take the water pouring into his rectum. Listening for Krystal she kept him calm breathing with him and watching his face for signs of discomfort. It always amazed her that now after being together for five years they could read each other so easily. Of course that didn&#8217;t mean every once in awhile she didn&#8217;t check in with him but knowing him so well did have its perks. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hearing Krystal come out of the bathroom she grinned as the girl came into the room and knelt by the door waiting quietly for directions as Sam finished up with Gabriel. Once the bag had emptied completely she pulled away from him putting it in the container and setting it over with Krystal&#8217;s. Going over and sitting on one of the chests she waited. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�How are you doing boy?� She asked after a few minutes of making him hold it in.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Please Mistress let me go empty. Its starting to feel like I&#8217;m going to completely explode. Please let me go empty.� Gabriel begged sweat forming on his brow as he looked up at her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Go boy.� Sam ordered and watched as he got up carefully and then rushed from the room shutting the bathroom door hard. �That never gets old watching you to scurry around like that. Go clean up the bed slut.� Sam ordered as she leaned back resting and watching. Krystal went to the bed and cleared the pad and used gloves away. Throwing them in the garbage can she put the lube away before kneeling waiting for further instructions. �Get the astro-glide and the long latex gloves out girl.� Sam demanded. Krystal rushed to do her bidding. Once done Krystal knelt again and waited.&nbsp; �Get over hear and rub my foot until the boy is done.� Sam said as she slid her foot out of her flat.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Krystal rushed over and began rubbing and messaging. Leaning back Sam sighed enjoying the feel of a good foot rub. It was one of the things she missed sometimes about having another living leg but at the same time professional salons often cut their price in half for her when the realized she only had one foot to pedicure. There was always a silver lining. She only had to wait a few more minutes until Gabriel finally came out of the bathroom. Smiling she moved away from Krystal and stood sliding her shoe back on.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Now then slut you&#8217;re going to go first. Go lay on the bed the same way as before. Boy you&#8217;re going to comfort her and distract her understand? And make it good because I&#8217;ll be watching as well.� Sam said as she moved towards the bed watching as they rushed to get into place. Gabriel got on the bed up by Krystal&#8217;s head and smoothed her hair back out of her face as she spread her legs and tucked them up against the bedrails. Sam stepped between them pulling on the long black gloves and picking up the astroglide. Lubing her hand up she started rubbing Krystal&#8217;s asshole gently helping the girl to relax. Gabriel seeing that they had begun moved forward and kissed Krystal much to Sam&#8217;s pleasure. Watching as he teased and manipulated her tongue and moved his hand up to rub and play with her nipples made her wet. Sliding a finger into Krystal&#8217;s ass easily she loved the moan it got her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You like having your ass fucked don&#8217;t you slut? Its your pussy isn&#8217;t it?� Sam teased as she slid her finger in and out of Krystal gently lubing her up before adding a second finger easily. �You let lots of men fuck it don&#8217;t you? That&#8217;s why my fingers slide so easily into your slutty stretched out hole isn&#8217;t it?� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mistress. Its true. I&#8217;m such a slut to be fucked.� Krystal moaned out as Gabriel moved down to lick and suck on her tits making her arch into him and push against Sam&#8217;s fingers. Sam worked her fingers in and out of her more feeling her readiness and looseness. Adding more lube she slid a third finger in and was delighted when it went in just as easily as the first two.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�All that practice with that super plug is helping isn&#8217;t it slut?� Sam asked in reference to the butt plug she had gotten Krystal recently to help stretch her to take fisting more easily.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mistress.� Krystal responded breathlessly as the pleasure washed over her making her whimper and moan loudly. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Such a slut.� Sam laughed as she worked her fingers back and forth harder. Adding more lube she pushed her pinky into the girl feeling a little tightness for the first time. Sam didn&#8217;t have huge hands but her knuckles weren&#8217;t small either. Bringing her thumb up she started pressing deeper into the writhing girl stretching her further as she rubbed her inner thighs to comfort her as well as let her know she was ok.&nbsp; Gabriel was back to kissing her pinching and flicking her nipples. Adding more lube Sam moved her thumb back down and started pressing it against Krystal&#8217;s ass. Feeling her tense at the knowledge at what was coming she slowed down a little. �Relax slut or it&#8217;ll hurt. Breath and relax.� She ordered her in a soothing voice as she continued working her thumb in with her other fingers. Feeling Krystal relaxing she watched her interacting almost mindlessly with Gabriel. Pushing forward she felt Krystal&#8217;s ass giving in though and stretching to take her hand. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Breath girl.� Sam called to her as she added more lube and pulled back&nbsp; little bit before pushing forward. Feeling Krystal&#8217;s ass give way she kept a steady pressure as she pressed in hard. �Press out against me� She demanded as she felt the pressure enclose on her hand. Feeling Krystal pressing out against her and breathing hard she eased up before pressing smoothly in and watching in delight as the girls ass enveloped her hand completely. Keeping her fingers pressed together like a cone she pressed a little deeper moving her knuckles past the ring of Krystal&#8217;s ass. �Good girl. Good girl I&#8217;m in relax and breath. Tell me how you&#8217;re doing sweety.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It feels so good Mistress, slightly sore and like I&#8217;m being completely taken. Oh god don&#8217;t stop.� Krystal moaned as she lost herself in the sensations. Gabriel was back to her nipples nipping and sucking them as Sam started fisting her ass more completely pushing in harder and backing out thrusting ever so carefully within her. Knowing she was working Krystal&#8217;s prostate she moved carefully but smoothly. She knew the other girl was close to orgasm seeing the precum dripping in globs from her cock.&nbsp; Working her harder she knew she was close.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Don&#8217;t forget to ask to cum slut.� Sam teased as she continued fisting her loving the tight feel of her sub&#8217;s ass around her hand. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Please Mistress I&#8217;m so close. Let me cum Mistress I&#8217;ve been a good slut. PLEASE MISTRESS.� Krystal cried out wantonly as she pressed her hips down taking more of Sam&#8217;s hand. Sam could feel her loosing all control and worked her even more.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Cum girl.� Sam ordered working faster to bring her more pleasure. Krystal let out a scream as she came hard, her orgasm splashing up her stomach as her ass spasmed tightly down on Sam&#8217;s fist clenching and squeezing. Sam moaned softly at the feeling knowing she was bringing her complete pleasure. Watching Gabriel she could see he couldn&#8217;t wait to be fisted and knew he would be more than ready to play next. As Krystal came down of her orgasm Sam slowly pulled her fist from her ass. As her knuckles popped free Krystal&#8217;s muscles gave out like putty and she slumped against the bed. Grinning Sam stripped herself of the used gloves before moving onto the bed and kissing Krystal gently.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good girl.� Sam cooed to her as she kissed her again gently. Brushing her hair off her face Sam grinned down at her. �Such a good girl taking my fist. Are you ok? No pain?� She asked carefully as Gabriel got up knowing he would be asked to clean Krystal up. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I feel so good Mistress. Thank you.� Krystal said as she bowed her head. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good I&#8217;m glad slut. Gabriel just get a warm washcloth.� Sam said as she watched him trying to find something to clean the girl up with. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mistress.� Gabriel answered quickly as he rushed out of the room. Sam layed there soothing Krystal as she came down off her high. She could see the glazed look in her eyes and knew she was in subspace. Grinning she kissed her forehead as Gabriel came back with a warm wash cloth. Wiping Krystal&#8217;s cum off of her stomach he then wiped up the excess lube. Setting the damp towel down on the enema supplies he came back to the bed. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Help me get her up to her room. You should take a nap girl.� Sam said gently as she stood and looked to Gabriel. Gabriel nodded and together they helped to get Krystal standing. She was still noodle but not too bad.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mistress you&#8217;re right Mistress.� Krystal said dazed as they led her up the stairs. Reaching her room they led her in and got her in bed. Sam curled up with her soothing her while Gabriel sat on the edge of the bed quietly. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Sleep girl, I&#8217;m right here and will stay until you fall asleep.� Sam said soothingly knowing that Krystal usually needed to sleep after hitting subspace. But she would not leave her until she was asleep. They didn&#8217;t have to wait long before Krystal fell asleep completely relaxed and happy. Standing carefully Sam led the way out of the room shutting the door quietly. Not looking at Gabriel she led the way back downstairs. Once in the dungeon she turned to him and grinned.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Your turn boy. Get in position.� Sam said with an evil grin as she looked at her sub. Pulling a&nbsp; new set of gloves on she followed him to the bed as he quickly climbed up. �Such an eager boy. Its so cute when you are so ready to please me like this boy.� Sam laughed as she grabbed the lube and started lubing her hand up. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I love it when you use me like this Mistress.� Gabriel said as his eyes clouded in lust.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I know boy and your ass always so accommodating.� Sam laughed as she pressed her fingers against his asshole and rubbed them in circles. Hearing his sigh of pleasure she didn&#8217;t waste too much time pressing a finger into him. His ass easily took her finger and as she lubed him up and added a second finger she grinned at his moans of pleasure. �Barely two fingers in and you&#8217;re already dripping in precum boy.� Sam laughed. He was such a fisting whore. He loved his ass played with and it delighted her to oblige him. Working her fingers in and out of his ass she had added more lube, and a third and fourth finger before she knew it. His ass, used to being fisted took them easily. Adding her thumb and pressing in she met some resistance but he was already there breathing through it and pressing out against her helping her to slide in. With a pop her knuckles moved past his outer ring of muscles and his ass took her hand and fist.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Ugh yesss Mistress.� He moaned out as he arched on the bed taking her fist. Same grinned and started moving back and forth in his ass slowly at first.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good boy, take my fist�� She moaned out deeply as she started working her fist more and more into his ass pushing deeper carefully and working faster. Feeling him tensing she knew he was getting completely lost in pleasure. His cock was hard and moving against his stomach as she fisted him. Leaning over carefully she took the pierced head into her mouth and sucked&nbsp; hard swirling her tongue around him playing with the piercing and moving deeply in his ass. �Oh GOD MISTRESS� He cried out moving against her in pleasure. Sucking more of him in to her mouth she started bobbing up and down on his cock deepthroating him carefully as she fucked his ass completely. �PLEASE Mistress let me cum. Oh god&nbsp; PLEASE� He begged and she felt his ass starting to contract.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Cum� She commanded around his cock as she continued sucking him. She was rewarded almost at once by his orgasm erupting into her mouth as his ass clamped down on her hand hard. Gabriel was completely lost in the most mind blowing pleasure he had felt in a long time. Gripping the sheets he came hard into her mouth groaning as he felt&nbsp; her sucking him dry as she milked his prostate. It was mind blowing and something she had never done before. The pleasure went on and on until he didn&#8217;t think he could take it anymore and started letting out whining sounds at the overwhelming sensitivity in his cock.&nbsp; Giggling Sam pulled up off his cock and slowly pulled her fist from his ass. Taking her gloves off she dropped them off to the side of the bed as she crawled up the bed and kissed him. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Coaxing his mouth open she surprised him by sharing his own cum with him. Letting it flow from her mouth to his she rubbed her cum coated tongue against his as she pressed up against his naked body and kissed him deeply. Pulling back she grinned at him before swallowing her half of his load and licking her lips. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Swallow it boy.� She laughed. Swallowing Gabriel nodded before closing his eyes. �You ok boy?� She asked gently.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mistress.� Gabriel said breathlessly as he relaxed against the bed his brain foggy. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good boy. Wait here.� Sam said as she kissed his forehead before scooping up the dirt gloves and throwing them in the garbage. Grabbing both used enema kits she smiled at him before she walked out of the room. Going to the kitchen she set the enema kits on the counter before grabbing his chastity device, padlocks and keys and heading back to the bedroom where she found him still in the same position his ass open and legs tucked up a complete noodle against the bed. �Move up on the bed you silly boy.� She laughed as she walked over to him. Helping him scoot up the bed she moved up on the bed and gently tucked his cock into the curve pulling his piercing through the tip and tucking his balls up. Locking him into the curve and then his piercing in as well she pocketed the keys before moving up the bed and pulling him into her cuddling him gently.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You were such a good boy.� Sam said gently as she smoothed his hair back off his face and kissed his forehead again. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Thank you Mistress.� Gabriel said as he nuzzled her stomach cuddling into her and closing his eyes still out of it. Laying with him for a little while she waited until he came back into himself. She didn&#8217;t have to wait too long not that she minded, she never rushed aftercare.&nbsp; Shifting against her he stretched lightly his eyes much more focused.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You good now hun?� She asked with a smile.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mistress.� He smiled as he leaned up and kissed her before moving.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good. Straighten the bed up and then go rinse off before checking on Krystal. I&#8217;m going to go start dinner so I suggest one of you is down her to set the table in an hour or so.� Sam said as she shifted and moved off the bed. �Oh and take the dirty clothes up with you and put them in the hamper.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mistress.� Gabriel said with a nod as he moved up off the bed and started straightening the room up.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sam went to the kitchen and let Nova in checking his paws for mud before giving him a bone. Going to the sink she rinsed and cleaned the enema Kits before drying them and folding them up in their respected boxes. Setting them on the end of the counter she got to work preparing dinner. That night they were having pasta with meat sauce. Getting out the canned tomatoes and meat she got to work simmering and preparing the sauce. Uncorking a bottle of wine she poured herself a glass before pouring some to cook with. As it simmered she cleaned the lettuce for salad and got the pasta water on and boiling. Hearing someone coming down the stairs she turned to see Krystal dressed in a pair of lounge pants and a tshirt.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You ok hun?� She asked her as she watched her come into the kitchen and lean against the counter.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yeah, still a little tired and out of it though.� Krystal said quietly. Sam watched her carefully not wanting the poor thing to feel abandoned. Coming over she wrapped her arms around her pulling her head down and holding her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m here girl.� She said as she stroked her hair. Feeling Krystal relax against her she smiled and kissed her neck. �Come on sit at the table and I&#8217;ll pour you a glass of wine.� Sam said as she helped her to the table.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Thank you Mistress.� Krystal said with a smile, already perking up a bit. Pouring her a glass of Merlot she handed to her before going back to finish dinner.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;ll just make Gabriel set the table.� Sam said with a smile. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�He hasn&#8217;t done it in awhile.� Krystal laughed as she took a sip of wine. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What haven&#8217;t I done in awhile?� Gabriel asked as he came downstairs dressed in scrub pants and a t-shirt.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Set the table.� Sam said as she finished up the last of dinner and started putting it in serving dishes. �You&#8217;re right on time. Set the table while I finish this. Do you want wine or a beer?� Sam asked already knowing the answer.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Beer.� Gabriel laughed as he set out the plates and silver where.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Of course. God forbid you have good taste.� Sam teased as she set the food on the table and handed him a beer. Krystal laughed as well as she turned and tucked herself into the table. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I chose you didn&#8217;t I?� Gabriel laughed as he sat down and opened his beer. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I am pretty sure I was the one who chose you.� Sam said pointedly as she too sat down and tucked into dinner.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yeah that&#8217;s probably true. I was kind of an idiot.� Gabriel mumbled as they all started dishing up.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That&#8217;s an understatement.� Sam muttered with a smile at Krystal who snorted into her plate as she took a bite of pasta.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�This is REALLY good. Thank you!� Krystal said quickly as Gabriel stared at his wife indignantly. Laughing Sam toasted him enjoying the playful banter that continued throughout the meal. She wouldn&#8217;t have had it any other way.













 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;









Dream Life Part 2
Sam drove to work the next day completely lost in thought. Her commute wasn&#8217;t too difficult but it could be long at times. Usually she thought about her patients and what the day would bring but today she was lost in memories. He leg was paining her a bit today and she couldn&#8217;t help but remember the accident. 
�������������� She had been 22 and in her final semesters at nursing school. It had been a rough couple of years. She and Gabriel had made it past the one year mark and she couldn&#8217;t have been more thrilled. She had had gastric bypass and reached her goal weight. What&#8217;s more Krystal had finally decided that she was ready to make a commitment to Sam and only Sam instead of continuing the casual sexual friendship they had maintained for the last year and a half. Jonathan had just met another girl he was interested in and while they still played and saw each other it wasn&#8217;t as much as Sam had hoped it would be. She and Gabriel had moved in together a few months ago and life was pretty good. Driving to class that Monday morning in January it had been pouring rain. She had left Gabriel asleep in bed in their apartment and gotten into her Prius ready to be done with school and working. 
�������������� Driving on the 880 freeway going towards San Francisco the roads had been slick. Sam was a careful driver though and didn&#8217;t think too much of it. Listening to music and sipping her tea she didn&#8217;t see the semi truck swerve out of control until it was too late. �The world had stopped in that moment as she swerved her car trying to avoid the fast coming truck. Tires squealed around her and she had enough sense with the weather to not hit her breaks. It was in slow motion that the front end of the truck slammed into the passenger side of her car. The jolt threw her into her seat belt and Sam let go of the steering wheel praying to god as she flipped through the air that she made it through this. The last thing she remembered thinking before the world went black was of Gabriel. 
�������������� There was a beeping sound that was really starting to annoy her. But she couldn&#8217;t get her body to work, for some reason it wasn&#8217;t listening to her. The world around her was dim and foggy and she couldn&#8217;t quite process what was going on. Screaming at herself she ordered her body to wake up. OPEN YOUR DAMN EYES. She screamed within her head. Suddenly she blinked and crashed completely back into her body. 
�������������� �Sam! Oh god honey!� Her mom cried as her face swam above her. Tears leaked down her mother&#8217;s cheeks and suddenly she was gone. Hearing the door close she wondered what the hell was going on. Slowly it came back to her. The accident. Blinking a couple of times she let out a sigh of relief. She was alive. Feeling like a brick was sitting on her chest she started trying to move, taking her body into account. She couldn&#8217;t move very well though and as she tried the aching of her entire body set in making her cry out. 
�������������� �She&#8217;s awake.� She heard her mom&#8217;s voice out in the hall and suddenly the door was opening and she could hear someone come into the room. Looking as best she could she saw a warm blonde haired nurse coming towards her. 
�������������� �Hello there sweet heart. I&#8217;m Carolyn your nurse. Try not to move and just relax. Do you know who you are?� The nurse asked as she appeared above Sam her good natured face warm and calming. 
�������������� �Yes.� Sam croaked as she tried to make herself talk. Her voice was like nails on a chalk board. 
�������������� �Here have a sip of water.� Carolyn said gently with a smile as she held a straw up to her lips. It took her a minute but Sam remembered how to swallow. 
�������������� �Where am I?� She managed after swallowing the cool liquid.  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
�������������� �You&#8217;re at UCSF hospital here in San Francisco. Can you tell� me your name?� Carolyn asked as she moved to set the glass on the bedside table. Sam took the room into account seeing lilies of various colors on every surface and the cool colors of the private room. Pictures and cards were everywhere. She could feel the love of the people that had brought them. 
�������������� �Sam. Samantha Smith.� Sam said carefully as she blinked and looked back to the nurse. �There was a semi truck. It was raining.� Sam said slowly as she looked at the nurse. 
�������������� �Yes there was an accident. Are you in pain?� Carolyn asked as she started checking the monitors and things. 
�������������� �I feel like I&#8217;ve been beaten. I can&#8217;t quite feel my body right.� Sam said as she tried to sit up and look at her body. 
�������������� �Just relax and rest. I can give you some more pain medication if you would like. Your family is very anxious to see you.� Carolyn said soothingly as she laid a hand on Sam&#8217;s shoulder preventing her from sitting up. 
�������������� �I&#8217;m fine. Where&#8217;s my mom?� Sam asked slowly as she looked towards the door. She wanted to� know what was going on but she also knew that Carolyn would have been instructed not to tell her anything. This was an ICU room, Sam recognized it from her studies. Which meant something was really wrong and she wanted to know what. 
�������������� �She&#8217;s right out in the hall with the rest of your family. I will bring her in now if you want?� Carolyn said as she moved towards the door. 
�������������� �Yes.� Sam said as she blinked and looked around trying to figure out what day it was and what time of day it was. She wanted answers and she wanted them now. Opening the door Carolyn stepped out and Sam could hear voices in the hall. The door opened again and she saw her mom. At 5&#8217;5� she was a slightly dumpy woman with bright blue eyes, dark red hair and a warm face. Coming forward her eyes were tear stained. 
�������������� �Hi sweat heart.� Joan said as she came to her daughter&#8217;s bedside. �How are you feeling?� 
�������������� �Sore. How long have I been here?� Sam asked as she watched her mom. Her mom&#8217;s face was guarded telling Sam that she didn&#8217;t feel comfortable in the room. Granted it was a hospital room and it was her daughter lying in the bed, but her mother had been a Chaplin for many years, this should not have affected her like this. It had to have been something else. 
�������������� �About a week. It&#8217;s 4pm on the 23rd of January. Your dad and step mom are here. So are Krystal and Gabriel. Gabriel has hardly left your side.� Joan said carefully as she watched her daughter&#8217;s face. 
�������������� �A week? What happened what&#8217;s wrong with me? Where&#8217;s Gabriel I want to see him.� Sam said quickly as she started trying to move. Her mom&#8217;s eyes overflowed as she rushed from the room. Getting mad at everyone not being straight with her she started moving trying to sit up and moving her head from side to side. The movement hurt but she was not going to just lay there. 
�������������� �Whoa Sam calm down.� Gabriel said as he came into the room. Seeing him her eyes filled with tears as she swallowed hard and stopped struggling. He was at her side at once his forehead resting against hers letting her feel him. �Breath baby, I&#8217;m here its ok, you&#8217;re going to be ok.� He said as he caressed her face. The fear was evident on his face but also the relief at seeing her awake. 
�������������� �What&#8217;s wrong with me? What&#8217;s happened?� Sam asked as she looked at him her tears slowing. 
�������������� �I don&#8217;t know if I should be the one to�� Gabriel started as he stood up and looked down at her glancing to the door. 
�������������� �Tell me Gabriel.� Sam demanded as she tried to move again. 
�������������� �You have a broken arm, hand, some broken ribs, a broken hip and� and they had to uhm� the doctors didn&#8217;t have a choice baby, your leg was crushed completely there was no saving it. They took it.� Gabriel said as he looked down his eyes filling with tears. Sam stared at him blinking hard. 
�������������� �Sit me up.� She said after a few minutes of staring at him. �Now. NURSE!� She cried as she started trying to move again. 
�������������� �Baby please relax breath you&#8217;re weak. You don&#8217;t want to hurt yourself.� Gabriel started as Carolyn rushed into the room. 
�������������� �What&#8217;s going on here? Miss Smith you need to relax and rest and let your body recover. I don&#8217;t want to have to give you a shot.� Carolyn said gently as she pressed Sam back into the bed gently. 
�������������� �Sit me up then. I need to see my body.� Sam said as she glared up at the nurse. She was getting mad. �Look I know what I need now fucking let me see it!� 
�������������� �There is no need to get angry Miss Smith. Take a deep breath and we&#8217;ll see about sitting you up slowly. Your body has sustained quite a lot.� Carolyn said firmly as she looked at the young woman pointedly. 
�������������� �I&#8217;m sorry; please just let me see it.� Sam said as she closed her eyes in defeat. Feeling the bed shifting and her upper body moving up she looked down trying to see her legs. The pain wasn&#8217;t too bad though the soreness was starting to take over.� Looking down she saw a long lump where her left leg was and a shorter lump on her right. Staring at it she looked to Gabriel as she shifted against the pillows. 
�������������� �Pull the cover off.� Sam said carefully as she moved her left arm a little bit realizing that it wasn&#8217;t hurt and finding the feeling was coming back quickly. She didn&#8217;t feel like lead. Pushing the blanket off her chest she started trying to move. 
�������������� �Miss Smith I will lay you right back down if you don&#8217;t stop trying to move.� Carolyn said carefully as she put a hand to Sam&#8217;s good arm. Gabriel looked at Sam carefully before moving the blanket down showing her her bandaged leg. Staring at it she felt the shock coursing through her body. 
�������������� �Its ok baby.� Gabriel said soothingly as he came to her nuzzling her carefully. 
�������������� �Will I be able to ride again?� Sam asked suddenly as she looked at Carolyn. The blonde nurse sighed before speaking. 
�������������� �Your mother warned me you were headstrong.� You&#8217;ll have to ask the doctor when he comes. For now you need to lie back a little and rest.� Carolyn said as she pulled the cover back over her and laid her back a little. 
�������������� �Thank you.� Sam said as she swallowed hard trying to process this. Closing her eyes she sighed. Hearing Carolyn leave the room she opened her eyes looking at Gabriel. �I&#8217;m sorry.� Sam said softly as tears started falling again. 
�������������� �For what?� Gabriel asked as he moved around to the other side of the bed taking her good hand in his and leaning down nuzzling into her neck. 
�������������� �For all of this. If you want to break up I understand. This is a lot.� Sam said quietly. She couldn&#8217;t imagine asking someone to go through this with her. She saw the fear that was on his face. She was damaged and broken and would never be the same 
�������������� �Are you completely crazy? Did they take your brain? Baby, how many times have I told you amputee chicks turn me on? And now you&#8217;re going to be one of them and you think I&#8217;m going to just disappear?� Gabriel asked with a laugh as he stood up. �Is it wrong and weird that I&#8217;m turned on right now?� Sam stared at him unsure of how to react. Part of her was laughing that here they were in this situation and the man she loved was standing there turned on despite this being a horrible situation.� The other part of her was terrified though relieved and a feeling of calm was washing over her. He could always calm her down when she was upset in a way that no one else could. 
�������������� �I love you.� She said finally as she smiled up at him. 
�������������� �I love you too.� Gabriel said with a smile as he leaned down and kissed her. Sighing into the kiss Sam was bummed when he stepped back. �Your family want to see you.� 
�������������� �I know. Don&#8217;t go though ok?� Sam said as she reached for his hand. 
�������������� �Of course not.� Gabriel smiled as he took her hand and squeezed it once before going to the door. Coming back to the bedside he took her hand again moving up on the bed next to her so that she could lean her head into his leg feeling him and getting strength from him. The door opened again and her Mom, Dad and step mom Lucy came in. All looked worried. Her mom came around to stand next to Gabriel while her step mom came to her head and leaned down hugging her carefully. 
�������������� �We were so worried.� Lucy said as she looked down at her step daughter. Lucy and Sam were very very close. Sam and her father didn&#8217;t get along very well as his hatred for her mother got to her. But since he had married Lucy when Sam was 18 their relationship wasn&#8217;t as rocky. She spent more time with her step mother than her father and they had built a close relationship. Lucy was 5&#8217;6� slender and petite with sandy brown hair and brown eyes. She was a nurse supervisor at one of the big hospitals in Sonoma county and had helped Sam get into nursing school. 
�������������� �Its ok. I&#8217;ll be ok.� Sam said bravely as she leaned into Gabriel. She knew he didn&#8217;t like being around her father but she wasn&#8217;t about to let go of him. 
�������������� �We know honey. We&#8217;re all here for you.� Lucy said as she began rambling about her family and how they had sent flowers and cards and were watching the house and praying for her. And would be so relieved to hear that she was ok. Sam&#8217;s father didn&#8217;t speak but Sam knew he was worried. Her mom told her how she had gotten a hold of Sam&#8217;s step father John to let him know she was ok and that he was worried and would be getting off the ship at the next port. He was a captain for Princess Cruise line and had been out at sea for a month out of the three he usually was. �Listening to her parents talk about friends and trivial things, Sam hoped the doctor would come soon. She got her wish when the tiny oriental man came in smiling. 
�������������� �I&#8217;m glad to see you are awake. I&#8217;m Doctor Lee.� He said as he came and stood at the end of the bed. He rambled off about the various medical things she had endured but Sam didn&#8217;t quite care. She only cared about one thing. Glancing around he nodded to her parents and Gabriel before continuing. �Of course you&#8217;ll have plenty of questions I&#8217;m sure.� 
�������������� �Will I be able to ride again?� Sam asked simply as she looked at him. She knew recovery would be hard, she knew things would be different she wasn&#8217;t concerned about those things though. She wanted to know if she could ride again. 
�������������� �I have talked to your mother about your involvement with horses and the various you have worked so hard at enjoying with the horses. However she also informed me how much you enjoy jumping and competing. Unfortunately I don&#8217;t foresee you ever being able to jump or compete again but with hard work I am sure you will be able to enjoy leisurely riding.� Doctor Lee said carefully. 
�������������� �I don&#8217;t want to ride leisurely.� Sam said slowly as she thought of the horse her step father John had bought her. Valiant was a 17 hand dark bay Warmblood imported from Germany. She adored him and rode him often.� She couldn&#8217;t imagine never being able to ride him again. 
�������������� �Miss Smith, I&#8217;m sure your parents will agree that for your safety it would be best that you not do the things that you were formerly able to do.� Doctor Lee said clinically. �You will have to get used to a new way of life now. I know it will be difficult but you will be able to have a fairly normal life with time. However you will always have limitations.� 
�������������� �That&#8217;s not good enough.� Sam said fiercely as she glared at him tears coming to her eyes. �I am not going to just take that.� 
�������������� �We will figure it out Sam.� Gabriel said sensing that she was on the edge of losing control out of frustration. �I swear to you if I have to learn to ride myself and put you in front of me on the saddle you will ride again and do the things you love. It&#8217;ll be ok.� Gabriel said as he cupped her face making her look at him and see the sincerity in his eyes. 
�������������� �You have a supportive family. Do you have other questions?� Doctor Lee asked as he glanced at his watch. 
�������������� �No.� Sam said shortly as she looked up at Gabriel and sighed. She could see the love he had for her and knew in that moment he would have done anything for her. It left her breathless and she felt herself growing closer to him in that moment. This was the man she was going to marry. She knew it now. 
�������������� The days after that were hard. The pain was bad but her body slowly healed. Gabriel was there for her everyday helping her learn to walk. When she was finally able to go home she couldn&#8217;t wait to just be in her house. Gabriel had helped her take a shower and crutch out into their bedroom. Sam started getting frustrated when she couldn&#8217;t keep her balance and ended up falling back against the bed. Feeling the tears coming to her eyes she bit her lips feeling like she was losing who she was. How was she ever going to Dominant him again when she couldn&#8217;t even stand properly. 
�I&#8217;m never going to be able to Dominant you again.� Sam said as she laid there staring up at the ceiling voicing her fear. She couldn&#8217;t look at him. This was it there was no way they could make it through this. He would get scared she knew it. He would want someone who could better handle him. 
�Stop it Sam.� Gabriel said slowly as he felt her mood shift. He could understand her frustration but what he couldn&#8217;t understand was why she was taking it out on him. 
�Its true! I can&#8217;t even stand! How the hell am I going to to... I don&#8217;t know control you.� Sam wined as she let the tears flow down her cheeks. She didn&#8217;t want to lose him but maybe it was best if she did. Letting herself wallow in her own self pity she couldn&#8217;t see what this was now doing to him. 
�Do you not want me anymore?� he asked slowly as he stopped drying her off and stood staring down at her in only a towel, his chastity device having been removed when they had gotten home so that he wouldn&#8217;t get too sore. The fear and sadness was evident on his face but Sam was too wrapped up in herself to see it. 
�Of course I do Gabriel but how is this going to work? We both know that you need someone who can handle you and physically be with you and Dominate you. And look at me, I can&#8217;t even stand.� Sam said as she finally looked at him. Seeing his fear and sadness she was taken aback for a minute. 
�Stop it. You will learn to walk and stand but for god&#8217;s sake you JUST got out of the fucking hospital Sam. What do you expect? Your body has to get used to things. I love you and don&#8217;t want someone else. I want you Mistress but if this is your way of saying you don&#8217;t want me anymore fine, tell me. �But I have stood by you through all of this doing everything I can for you. If you don&#8217;t see how much I love you then fine.� Gabriel said as he shut down his face becoming clouded with anger at her rejection. He didn&#8217;t understand how she could be like this. Sam stared at him as the weight of what she was doing crashed down on her making her cry anew. 
�Oh god Gabriel I&#8217;m sorry.� She said quietly. �Of course I want you! I&#8217;m so sorry, I love you and don&#8217;t want to lose you. I&#8217;m just scared.� She finished as she sat up and reached for him. 
�I know you are but we can get through. I&#8217;m here Mistress.� Gabriel said as he took her hand and squeezed it looking at her gently. �Its ok to be scared, but don&#8217;t push me away.� He said as he moved up onto the bed leaning into her and kissing her gently. Sam sighed and pulled him to her wrapping her arms around his neck and laying back into the bed bringing him with her as she kissed him, feeling him nipping at her lip and sucking on it. Moaning she laid back as he moved his lips to her neck and sucked and bit her below her ear. �Let me show you just how much I love you.� He whispered as he nipped her earlobe and began kissing his way over her jaw line to her pulse point. 
Kissing and licking his way to her breasts he grinned up at her as he took her nipple into his mouth and sucked hard making her arch as his bit down on the barbell and worked his tongue against her. Sam felt her body light on fire for the first time in what seemed like years since the accident. Feeling him against her she lost herself in pleasure as he worked her nipples over making them harden and ultra sensitive. Moving over her breasts he kissed his way down her stomach, nipping and kissing his way lower and lower. Moving down her right hip Sam tensed unsure how she felt about him getting close to her stump. 
�Relax and just feel.� Gabriel whispered against her skin as he moved his lips lower. He felt her tensing and rubbed his hand up and down her left leg trying to sooth her. Kissing his way lower along her stump he felt her holding her breath as he moved over where the now healed over wound was. Kissing it gently he looked up to see her crying softly. Laying his cheek against her stump he reached up taking her hand and wrapping his body against her caressing her stump with his face nuzzling it and showing her the love he felt for her even without her leg. Moving his hands up to what was left of her thigh he started massaging it as he kissed the scar over and over again whispering how much he loved her against the scared skin. He could feel her crying softly as she reached down and caressed his face. Kissing every inch of her stump he made sure she knew how much he loved it. Nipping at the skin carefully he moved up her inner thigh to her pussy lips. 
Feeling him moving higher Sam sighed and relaxed, her tears slowing as she felt the desire returning. She could feel the love radiating from him into her. Letting him spread her legs she gasped and arched her back in pleasure as he took one long lick up her pussy tasting her wetness. Stopping at her clit he took the un-pierced flesh between his teeth and gently sucked it biting carefully and working the bundle of nerves with his tongue. Hearing her loud moan of pleasure he chuckled against her making her body vibrate. Sucking� her clit hard he moved down licking the entrance to her pussy where her juices were flowing sliding� his tongue in against her he curled it within her entrance making her gasp before moving back up to her clit and tracing it slowly. Sam was lost in pleasure toes curling and gripping the sheets as she rolled her hips against his mouth wanting and needing more. Sitting up carefully she grabbed his hair and pulled him off her pulling him up to her and kissing him hotly. 
Tasting herself on his lips she moaned and spread her leg letting him move between them easily as she arched and kissed him. Reaching down she pulled the towel off his hips throwing it to the side as she moved against him her hands scratching up his back as he shifted pressing his cock against her folds and grinding it into her not entering her but teasing her as he kissed her making her forget that she was broken, making her forget everything but the feel of him. Feeling the head of his cock moving against her she shifted spreading wider for him and moaning as she felt him move against her entrance. Biting his lip she pressed up into him sighing as he sank into her. Feeling him moving deeply into her she broke the kiss letting her head fall back as she sighed in pleasure. They moved together slowly and deeply treasuring each other and every movement. Looking into his eyes she lost herself in their depths feeling her breath match his as they took their pleasure from one another gently and sensually. 
Arching and rolling her hips against his she moaned feeling him moving deeply into her over and over again. Feeling her orgasm approaching quickly she moved against him harder her nails scratching down his back. Letting out cries of pleasure she came hard clenching around him tightly and pulling him into her deeply by his ass grinding her hips against him as waves of pleasure crashed over her. 
�Cum� she whispered breathless in pleasure as she held him to her. He hardly needed telling as he let out a cry cumming hard into her as his hand wrapped themselves up under her shoulders pulling her to them, embracing her completely as they loved each other completely with their bodies. Relaxing against each other Sam had felt like the most beautiful woman in the world. They had been through so much and to still have softness and tenderness between them was amazing. Falling asleep that night wrapped around each other Sam had known that she would get through this. She had to. 
The days after this were hard. Sam felt lost, broken and like she would never be who she wanted to be. There were ups and downs. Her body was sore and not what it had been. She tried to push herself but her body wouldn&#8217;t cooperate. Gabriel tried to be there for her but it was hard. When she finally was able to start learning to walk again she was so impatient he didn&#8217;t know what to do. He could remember the first time he came home to find her trying to walk. She had had physical therapy that morning and her mom had brought her back to the apartment. Gabriel had built her a bar that ran along one of their walls so she could walk back and forth between the two ballet like bars. Which is where he found her. Sam was wearing a white tank top with black sports bra under and a pair of shorts. The tank top was stuck to her body from the sweat pouring off her. It was obvious she had been at it awhile.
�What are you doing?� Gabriel asked slowly as he watched her struggling to stay upright and balance both the pain of her new prosthetic with the feeling of not having her leg. 
�What does it look like?� Sam snapped as she struggled to take step after step. Her face was drawn in determination.
�It looks like you&#8217;re pushing yourself after the doctors told you not to.� Gabriel said simply as he walked over to her watching her progress. 
�I want to walk.� Sam said simply as she stumbled and fell against the bar hard. Gabriel rushed forward to help her but she batted him away. �Don&#8217;t fucking help me! I am going to do this myself! I refuse to be pathetic!� Sam said fiercely as she held back tears as she tried to pull herself up. But her arm strength wasn&#8217;t enough and she crashed to the floor with a cry. Gabriel was at her side kneeling at once to help her as she tried to bat him away. 
�You&#8217;re not pathetic&nbsp; Sam, stop it.� Gabriel said softly as he pulled her to him pushing her hair out of her face and helping her to sit up. �How long have you been at this?�
�Since I got home.� Sam said as she struggled to sit up tears streaming down her face. Undoing the prosthetic she winced in pain as she slid it off. Unwrapping her stump she groaned as she saw the bruising and raw skin from pushing to hard.
�Jesus Sam. That&#8217;s over four hours ago.� Gabriel said sharply as he watched her. Moving he stood and helped lift her so that she could brace herself before helping her over to the couch. She didn&#8217;t resist him and he could feel how exhausted her body was.&nbsp; �You can&#8217;t do this to yourself. Its not going to help you.�
�I don&#8217;t want to be a cripple!� Sam wined as the tears fell. Sitting back into the couch she sighed, her body sore. The muscles in her stump were seizing and she winced trying to rub them out. Seeing this Gabriel sighed and knelt in front of her reaching out and moving her hands away. Massaging the muscles gently he watched her.
�I know you don&#8217;t, but this is what you are going to have to deal with. It&#8217;s going to take time Sam.� Gabriel said as he continued massaging her leg working his hand over it carefully so as not to aggravate the sensitive flesh. 
�I know. I know I just hate this.� Sam said as she wiped her tears away. 
Gabriel tried to do all that he could to make things easy for her. He loved her and wanted her to see that in everything he did for her. And slowly she came out of her depression and got used to life without her limb. The first time she made dinner for him since the accident he had been by her side helping the entire time. Watching her struggle and getting frustrated he had started caressing her stump running his fingers across the sensitive nerve endings and making her sigh in pleasure. He had found that this was a new erogenous zone for her, bringing her a new kind of pleasure. Leaning back into his touch Sam had calmed down and so a habit had been formed. Gabriel used her stump to calm her down when she got upset. And over time she learned to control herself better. 
By the time her birthday came around six months later she had made a lot of progress and was able to ride Valiant. It was hard and it hurt at times but she was determined. Gabriel was with her the entire time helping and pushing her to grow.� Krystal helped as well committing herself to Sam completely. She went back to school that fall and got ready to graduate that spring. And then that Christmas something completely unexpected happened. Gabriel had come with her to the family Christmas on her Mother&#8217;s side the weekend before Christmas. They had plans to go see his family as well. Sam had been so nervous about him meeting her uncles and cousins. He had met some of them over the last few months but to have all of them together like this was intimidating. They had been sitting on the couch after dinner watching her little cousins unwrapping the last of the presents. Just then her cousin Brooke had come from behind the tree holding a small wrapped box. Coming over to Sam she handed it to her smiling. 
�������������� �What&#8217;s this Brooke?� Sam asked confused as she had already finished unwrapping the last of her presents. Looking at the box she frowned not knowing who it was from. Brooke just giggled and shrugged walking away. All the eyes of her family were on her as she glanced at her mom she was surprised to see her smiling widely. She wondered if it was a graduation present. 
�������������� �I guess you better open it�� Gabriel said quietly making her look at him. He was next to her and as she shifted to look at him she saw he wouldn&#8217;t look at her. Frowning she undid the wrappings on the box and was confused as a small white box was left inside. Looking at the engraving on the box though she gasped. Gabriel took it from her opening it and pulling the black velvet box from within it. Sam&#8217;s heart stopped as she starred from him to the box and back again. Finally he met her eyes his showing a mixture of emotions. Love, passion, fear, nerves, joy. Opening the box she had to bite her lip to keep from making noise. There nestled on a black velvet backdrop was a diamond ring. It was simple and done in white gold. But there was no mistaking what it was. �Will you marry me?� He asked finally. Sam gasped and grinned quickly. 
�������������� �Yes! Yes oh my god yes!� Sam squeaked out as she wrapped her arms around him pulling him to her and hugging him tightly. Pulling back she kissed him deeply not caring that her family was there and watching. Pulling back she grinned as he slid the ring onto her finger. Looking down at it and then back up at him she had been the happiest woman in the world. 
�������������� Her family had of course known about this all along and had been thrilled for her. Their friends had been thrilled. Entering her final semester of nursing school she started planning a wedding for that fall. But this would not be just any wedding. For one, Sam had a huge family when you put her step mother, step father and her mother&#8217;s family. Her father&#8217;s family were estranged so they were not invited. She was also not just planning a wedding but also a private collaring ceremony and the honeymoon.� The wedding was going to be fairly traditional and simple. The collaring ceremony was to be more complex. 
As a present to them both Sam had decided if they were going to marry she was going to improve Gabriel&#8217;s chastity. Working with a piercer friend of hers she had learnt how to do it and was thrilled when she was finally ready to pierce Gabriel herself. Of course he had been hesitant and nervous about the idea at first but it was something they had talked about for a long time. That final day she worked with a piercer friend of hers she had also decided that it was time to pierce her clit hood. Piercing it horizontally had been a little painful and driving home she had constantly been aware of it. She was also aware that she wouldn&#8217;t be able to enjoy sexual acts of any kind for a couple of weeks which was perfect since neither would Gabriel when she was done with him. Krystal was out of town for a few days so it was the perfect time. 
When Gabriel got to their apartment that night she had told him it was time and ordered him to strip and lay on the bed. Gathering the equipment including gloves, the special tube needed, the jewelry, surgical lube, alcohol pad and needle she set them all on a tray and came over to the bed grinning. Setting the supplies off to the side she removed the curve chastity device and started teasing his cock playing with it and stroking it as she grinned at him. Licking and kissing the head she started sucking. Sam enjoyed sucking cock, something that not many people knew. Deep throating him she sucked hard humming lightly as she bobbed up and down on his cock. Hearing his sighs and moans Sam was quickly rewarded as he became fully hard. Pulling back she sucked his smooth balls into her mouth one at a time sucking them and swirling them with her tongue as she worked. Moving back up to his cock she took him into her mouth again and sucked hard before deepthroating him and bobbing up and down quickly. She could feeling him getting closer and closer. Pulling back she lifted his balls and grinned as she pushed his legs apart slowly licking down his gouich, letting her tongue flick against it before moving even lower and rimming his ass with her tongue slowly. Hearing his intake of breath she grinned before pushing her tongue against his ass hole letting it slide in and rolling it around letting the pleasure of it drive him slowly crazy as she could tell by his moans. Licking back up to his balls she sucked them again deeply before sucking his cock again deepthroating and moaning around him. 
Pulling back she picked up the tray off the floor and grinned at his face as he went from turned on to shocked. Pulling the gloves on she lubed up the tube that would go into his urethra to help guide the needle. Sliding it into his now hard cock she opened the alcohol pad and wiped the site before going back and getting the needle and jewelry ready. It was an 8 gauge ring that would be used for the Prince Albert piercing. Once the alcohol was dry she grinned up at him as she moved the needle up to the site. It was right behind the glands on the underside of his cock. She had gotten to do the piercing a couple of times and felt confident. 
�Take a deep breath boy.� Sam said with a grin. Seeing him inhale she waited for the exhale before quickly and smoothly pushing the needle forward through the shaft of his penis and into the tube. He let out a small cry and the laid back breathing hard. Putting a drop of surgical lube on the end of the needle she smoothly threaded the jewelry through the hole moving it up out the tip of his cock and setting the needle aside. Sliding the half tube up out of his shaft she clamped the ring shut making it form a smooth ring. Stepping back she gathered her supplies and took her gloves off setting them on the bedside table before grinning down at him. �You doing ok?� Sam asked with a grin as she moved up on the bed where he was laying with his eyes closed, his cock pretty much deflated by now. 
�Yes, that wasn&#8217;t as bad as I thought it would be but it still hurts.� Gabriel said slowly as he opened his eyes and looked at her. 
�If it helps� I pierced my clit hood today.� Sam said with a grin as she bit her lip naughtily. 
�Really? Show me.� Gabriel said with an apprehensive look on his face. 
�Ask nicely and maybe I will boy.� Sam said as she poked him in the arm. 
�Please Mistress show me your new piercing.� Gabriel said with a sigh. Of course Sam showed him. 
�������������� Finishing nursing school she was relieved and so proud of herself to have graduated. Her leg was stronger than ever and she was excited to start working at a little hospital in Livermore. It wasn&#8217;t what she wanted to do forever but it was a good place to start. As that November came around the wedding plans were in full swing. The first weekend was the date and she was so excited. Having found a house as well she had been able to take a loan out with the help of her mom so they would be able to move in after they got back from their honeymoon in Europe. Her bachelorette party took place the weekend before the wedding and the week leading up to the wedding seemed to be the busiest and most surreal. 
�������������� The day of the evening ceremony wedding dawned bright and cold. Kissing Gabriel goodbye that morning she had spent the day getting ready. Her long dark hair was going to be pulled off her face and then curled down her back in long waves. With a traditional veil tucked into the curls and simple makeup Sam couldn&#8217;t have looked more radiant. The dress itself was a floor length strapless gown in white with beading and bits of lace on the bodice. The trumpet shaped skirt was light and airy with a train flowing behind. The wedding took place on an estate in Sonoma County near the beach. The air was crisp and clear and the hills alive with gold, reds and oranges. The ceremony was to take place in a small valley lakeside. Sam planned to enter by horse drawn carriage. She couldn&#8217;t have Valiant there with her but she wanted the symbolism to be there. She of course would have preferred human ponies as well but her family would definitely NOT have approved of that. 
�������������� The bridesmaids were dressed in strapless simple floor length chiffon burgundy gowns. The grooms and groomsmen were dressed in simple black suites with slate grey dress shirts, except for Gabriel who was dressed in a white button down shirt. It was formal without being stuffy. Sam had been so nervous as she had gotten in the carriage to go to the ceremony. She was excited and scared but so ready to take the right steps into the future with the man she adored. She had practically stopped breathing as she waited for the formalities of the wedding party and her parents to be seated. Then at last she felt the carriage move bringing her to her husband to be. 
�������������� Stepping carefully out of the carriage Sam couldn&#8217;t stop the smile from spreading across her face as she saw Gabriel waiting at the end of the isle for her.&nbsp; She had made as much progress as she could have but she still walked with a cane. However today her cane was special. The dark stained oak was carved with symbols of horses and Celtic knots. It was custom made for her by the one person she would use it to walk to. Gabriel. He had spent months working on it smoothing and polishing it and it was a beautiful piece of art that she would always cherish. Just another thing she adored him for. It was the small things he did for her. Walking to him had seemed to take forever but when at last his hand was in hers she knew she would never have to let it go. This was what was meant to be. She had known it all along and now here she was marrying the most important person in the world to her. She had barely heard the priest as he did the opening lines, she couldn&#8217;t help but keep her eyes on Gabriel&#8217;s. As they exchanged vows Sam felt unbelievably happy. She could hardly believe it when they were kissing and being proclaimed husband and wife. 
�������������� The reception had been a sit down dinner that went well. Dancing their way into the evening with their friends and family Sam had enjoyed herself but she couldn&#8217;t help but also think about the upcoming private ceremony that was to take place later that night in their suite in Santa Rosa. When at last the reception fizzled out and the guests went their separate ways, Sam and Gabriel were finally able to get in their limo and head to their hotel. Both knew they would probably not sleep that night but that they would have plenty of time to catch up on sleep on the plane over to Dublin, Ireland.� Going up to the suite they were greeted by their closest friends involved in the lifestyle. Kissing Gabriel one last time she smiled before going to the huge bathroom with Krystal to get ready. 
�������������� Once in the bathroom she had Krystal help her out of her wedding wear. Applying a special lube she had Krystal help her slide into the black and red latex gown. It had been custom made for her and fit like a glove. The dress pressed her breasts up perfectly and hugged her every curve. It fit snuggly to her knees before flaring out slightly and falling in latex ruffles. Sliding the fitted cropped jacket on she fastened it and laced it around her neck. Letting her curls fall down her back without the veil she grinned at herself in the mirror before sliding a pair of four inch stiletto heels on. She had only just mastered walking them thanks to technology and was glad to get to show them off. Stepping out into the now candle lit room Sam grinned around at their friends. They had helped make this possibly setting up the bed so that it could be used in the ceremony, lighting the candles and helping get things ready. 
�������������� Alina, Sam&#8217;s mentor and former trainer was there to perform the binding ceremony. For this would not just be a collaring, it would also be a binding ceremony.� Sam felt it was important that she not only collar him but bind herself to him and him to her in a Celtic inspired way. Stepping over to where Alina was standing at the foot of the bed she grinned at her. Turning she waited. Krystal and Jonathan came into the room from the living area first, dressed simply in black they were smiling as behind them walked Gabriel. He was completely nude except for the jewelry he wore in his ears, septum, tongue, nipples and cock. His head was bowed humbly as he walked behind the other two subs. As they moved around to stand at the sides of the bed Gabriel came and stood before Sam dropping to his knees at once. 
�������������� �We are gathered here today to bind these two souls together. We have all seen them grow and love one another as much as two people can. Tonight Gabriel is charged with committing his life to his Mistress.� Alina said formally as she glanced down at the couple. 
�������������� �I Samantha Smith proposition Gabriel to commit his life to mine, serving me until the end of his days and devoting his life to me. What say you boy?� Sam said as she looked down at him, lifting his chin to meet his eyes with her own. 
�������������� �I Gabriel swear to devote my life to you my Mistress. I swear to show you devotion until I cannot physically worship you any longer. And then I swear to worship you with my words. I give my life in service to you until death should part us from this world. You mean the world to me and I promise to give all that I can and make you my world if you will so have me as I humbly am.� Gabriel said carefully as he watched her the emotion of the moment crashing over him. 
�������������� �I take your devotion and demand that you wear my mark as a badge to the world who you belong to. Do you accept these terms?� Sam asked carefully as Alina stepped away from the bed and over to desk where a few items lay up on a piece of black velvet. 
�������������� �I do Mistress.� Gabriel said softly. 
�������������� �Then stand and lay back on the bed.� Sam said as she nodded to Jonathan and Krystal. Turning she walked to wear Alina was and picked up one of the items. Its handle was made from wood but it was long and clearly made of metal as it was reflecting the light from the candles. It was a thin short brand with a small mass of symbols and letters at its head. It was no bigger than the palm of your hand and was round like a silver dollar. Picking up a blow torch Alina lit it and began warming the metal of the brand. Gabriel stood and laid back on the bed as he had been instructed to. Krystal and Jonathan came to him and pinned his arms down getting ready to hold him. The guests looked on as the brad was finished being heated. Sam walked to the bed carefully and moved to the left side. Alina was there gripping his feet and holding them down preparing him. 
�������������� �You Gabriel are mine henceforth unless I so choose to release you. I bind you to your word with the burning of your flesh.� Sam said as she moved and pressed the brand down upon his lower abdomen near his left hip. Gabriel let out a guttural cry as the hot metal was pressed into his skin. The searing and sizzling of flesh could be heard as Sam held it. Waiting a few seconds as he struggled she pulled it back and moved away from the side of the bed placing it in a bucket of cool water before returning to her sub as they released him.&nbsp; The brand glowed a dark angry red, a beautiful S seared into his flesh with two small Celtic knots on either side of it. It was delicate and simple but the meaning was very clear. Gabriel lay back on the bed panting and wining quietly as the pain radiated from his hip. Sam came to him and soothed him quietly letting him know she was there. Alina came forward carrying a special device on a piece of red velvet. The metal rings looked ominous. Moving up onto the bed Sam grinned. 
�������������� �I adorn you with your enslavement to me and only me.� Sam said formally as she took his cock in her hands and slid both the his cock and balls through the first ring of the device. Sliding the rest of his cock through and into the cage of the device she adjusted his PA piercing taking his jewelry out and sliding the jewelry attached to the chastity device through the hole. Locking it down into place with the padlock handed to her by Alina she took the key which now hung on a chain and pulled it over her head letting it hang around her neck. Taking a small ring of metal from Alina she took Gabriel&#8217;s left wrist and fastened it around it. 
��I collar you with this permanent collar as a mark of ownership over you.� Sam said formally as she took the Allen head screw from Alina and a small tube of Lock tight. Applying the red gel to the screw she screwed it carefully down into place with an Allen wrench done in the shape of a special key. It too went onto the chain around her neck. Once it was firmly in place Sam grinned knowing only heating the metal would release the screw �Stand and kneel boy.� Sam said finally as she moved off the bed. Gabriel stood carefully still wincing in pain from the brand kneeling at her feet he kept his head bowed. Alina came forward once again but this time accompanied by a man with a tattoo gun. 
�������������� �Now I charge you Sam with this boy&#8217;s protection and care. What say you?� Alina challenged. 
�������������� �I accept this charge and swear to protect and care for this boy Gabriel with all of my heart. He will be mine and mine alone and I shall care for him for the rest of my life. I show him my own devotion by the marking of his name onto my ring finger so that he may forever know my commitment to him.� Sam said as she removed her wedding bands and held her hand out to the tattoo artist. He moved into place quickly having her hold her hand steady as he first applied the stencil to her hand before dipping his gun into the ink Alina held and tattooing Gabriel&#8217;s name around Sam&#8217;s ring finger. Sam took it stoically grinning down at Gabriel as he watched his Mistress ink herself for him. When the tattoo was finished and wiped clean Sam placed her wedding bands around the chain on her neck before turning to Alina. �Stand boy.� Sam ordered as Alina came forward once again with a piece of red ribbon. Gabriel stood but kept his head bent. 
�������������� �I bind Sam and Gabriel to one another so that their souls may be together for eternity.� Alina said as she took Sam&#8217;s right wrist and Gabriel&#8217;s left and brought them up wrapping the red ribbon around them carefully before tying it. �I now pronounce you bonded for eternity.� Alina said with a smile as she stepped away. 
�������������� Their friends clapped and cheered coming forward to hug and kiss them both in turn. Once congratulations had been passed they quickly left to allow the new couple time alone at last. Kissing Krystal and Jonathan goodnight Sam turned back to Gabriel and grinned. Going to him she wrapped her arms around him kissing him deeply. Letting their tongue rub against one another&#8217;s Sam couldn&#8217;t have been happier to be in his arms. 
�������������� �I love you.� Sam said gently against his lips as she pulled back and looked into his eyes. 
�������������� �I love you too.� Gabriel said with a smile as he kissed her gently again. 
�������������� They had gone to bed shortly after that without sex, without playing, just wanting to be in each other&#8217;s arms. It didn&#8217;t help that Gabriel had been horribly sore from the burn. But Sam figured they had plenty of time to play and plenty of time to make love in Europe. For that night she had had him help her out of her dress and into bed and together they had fallen asleep in the candle light man and wife for the first time.�������������
� Pulling into work in the present Sam smiled and looked down at her ring finger where she could just make out the tattoo of his name. Getting out of the car and heading into work she was again reminded of how happy and lucky she was.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Work was long and rough that day for Sam, she lost one of her patients and it hit hard. It was a young woman who had been in a coma for quite some time. Today she suffered an aneurism while Sam had been on duty. They had done everything they could for her but her brain function was gone. Sam had gotten to know this young woman&#8217;s family and when they finally made the call towards the end of Sam&#8217;s shift to pull the plug and let her go, Sam had been there. Part of her training had taught her to never get too close to her patients. It was important to maintain a close relationship without emotions. But she would have been lying to herself if she had to say that she didn&#8217;t have some patients that touched her more than others. And for some reason this patient had. Getting off work she had managed to keep it together as she walked out to her car. Getting in though she broke down in tears. Letting herself cry for a minute she got it together and started her drive home. Calling Krystal via Bluetooth she waited for her to pick up.
Krystal had met Sam when she was 24 and had just moved back from the east coast to the San Francisco Bay area. She had finally accepted who she was and had spent the last three years working so hard to be the woman she knew she was. Three years hormone therapy and a recent breast augmentation had brought Krystal from the scrawny 6&#8217;2� man she had been to the beautiful voluptuous woman that she was today. With DD cup sized breasts and her thin frame, many women were jealous of her. However she would always be jealous of other woman&#8217;s natural curves and padding. The gym had helped her get a butt but it would never be enough. After she had finally started dressing and acting as a woman on the east coast she decided that people where she was living were too stuffy for her. So she had opted to become a red head and move back to California where she had grown up. That spring she had started going out to the clubs in SF and had been shocked and surprised when she had met Sam.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Krystal had been taken by Sam from the moment she met the younger woman. At 20 she had been so full of life and wisdom. At the time yes she was plus sized but her long dark hair and striking green eyes had lured Krystal in. The night she met her was the night she knew she wanted to get to know her more and had asked for her number. They had started talking getting to know each other and meeting up for coffee and shopping trips. Krystal had loved being able to have a real girl as a friend. So many girls shunned her because she wasn&#8217;t considered �real�. But Sam hadn&#8217;t cared. In fact Sam had flirted with her and wasn&#8217;t concerned by her lack of biological femaleness. The more they got to know each other the more Krystal became more and more taken by her. It didn&#8217;t take long for her to get up the courage to tell Sam that she was attracted to her. Sam had been sweet, kissing her gently and telling her how she was attracted to her as well. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Krystal had been so excited. She knew about Sam&#8217;s past with Gabriel and was supportive with knowing that Sam was still very much so taken by the man she had only seen in passing at clubs. For someone Sam was in love with out in public they didn&#8217;t talk very much. But Krystal knew how close they really were. And it didn&#8217;t bother her. Sam had fit her into her life easily making time to go on dates and get to know each other sexually. Sam had been shy and reserved the first few times they had sex until she got used to being with a half woman half man. And then Sam&#8217;s Dominant nature had come out. Krystal knew she was submissive, having been with tons of men and enjoyed numerous gang bangs. Krystal enjoyed being used as the slut she saw herself as. Something Sam encouraged. The closer they got the more Krystal desired to please the younger girl. Sam encouraged her to go out and be gang banged but Krystal knew Sam wanted more from her.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It took almost losing Sam for Krystal to realize how much the young woman meant to her. After two years of friendship and a year and a half of casually dating and playing it took the terrifying moment when Gabriel called her to tell her there had been an accident and that Sam was in critical condition for Krystal to come to the realization that she loved her. She had been there as much as she could. She still had to work her job as an accountant, something she had worked hard to get and maintain. But she had been there when she could be, helping Gabriel keep up with the house work and sitting with Sam as she recovered. When Sam had come home she had helped take care of her making sure she was never by herself and always had someone to take her to her appointments. It had been hard but Krystal knew it was the only way she could prove to Sam that she loved her. Watching the tension between Sam and Gabriel, Krystal knew she had to wait before bringing their relationship up. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sam had been ahead of Krystal though and had told her that her feelings for her were deep. That she wanted to collar her and make her a bigger part of her and Gabriel&#8217;s lives. Krystal had been taken aback but had confessed her love for her. She didn&#8217;t care that Sam didn&#8217;t have her right leg anymore or that she was having a hard time. She loved her and wanted to commit to her. And so she had. She had watched this incredible woman go through gastric bypass, breast reduction (to which she told her she was crazy), getting into nursing school and then the accident. She couldn&#8217;t help but love her. When she and Gabriel finally got engaged and then married, Krystal had been shocked when they asked her to move in with them. But she had quickly accepted and became a part of their daily lives. And she had never looked back. As the maid and homemaker of the house she balanced her job and making Sam&#8217;s life as easy as possible. And she loved it. She was usually off an hour before Sam and was able to be home and have things straightened by the time Sam walked through the door. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Hello?� Krystal answered as she picked up the portable phone in the kitchen. She had gotten home and changed her clothes before doing some light dusting and making sure meat had been taken out for dinner.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Krystal its Sam.� Sam said her voice still full of emotion.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Hello Mistress, what&#8217;s wrong?� Krystal asked at once sensing the emotion in Sam&#8217;s voice. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I lost a patient today.� Sam said simply as she headed onto the freeway making her way to the bay bridge that would take her home.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh I&#8217;m so sorry Mistress, Sir isn&#8217;t home right now but would you like me to call him?� Krystal asked at once. Every once in awhile Krystal knew that Sam had a hard time with the loss of a patient. She usually needed a little extra care when she got home from Gabriel.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�He&#8217;s in class until late. Will you order take out? Chinese?� Sam said carefully as she tried not to think about things. She hated when she got emotional like this. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Of course Mistress. I&#8217;ll make sure everything is ready for you when you get home.� Krystal said quickly. She had an idea of what might help.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Thank you. Ill see you in a bit.� Sam said before hanging up.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Pulling into the driveway a little while later she got out of the car and grabbed her bag before locking the car and walking up to the house. Unlocking the door she stepped inside with a sigh. Walking in she was confused for a minute as she didn&#8217;t see Krystal anywhere to be found. Setting her purse and lunch bag down she looked around downstairs before heading upstairs to change. She figured the girl had had to go pick up the Chinese or something. Walking up stairs she pulled her black and white scrub top over her head as she entered the bedroom and threw it in a special laundry basket she kept just for her scrubs. Seeing a light on in the bathroom she was confused and called out.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Krystal?� Sam asked carefully.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m in here Mistress.� Krystal said from within the bathroom. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What are you doing?� Sam asked as she walked forward through the closet and into the bathroom to find it lit with candles and incense. Krystal was pouring bath salts into the tube as it filled, filing the room with the smell of lavender and vanilla. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m sorry you had a hard day at work.� Krystal said as she came to Sam and wrapped her in a big hug. �Dinner will be here in about an hour and I thought it might be nice to have a good soak.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Thank you Krystal. You&#8217;re such a good girl.� Sam said as tears sprang to her eyes. This woman really understood her and could touch her quite deeply sometimes. She never forgot how much she loved her but sometimes it was clouded by other things and other concerns in life. Krystal was such an important factor in their household. Pulling the taller woman down she kissed her on the lips pressing against her smoothly. Krystal let out a soft moan and melted into her Mistress. �Stay with me.� Sam said against her lips as she undid her bra before kissing Krystal again hotly and pulling her t-shirt up over her head. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Undoing Krystal&#8217;s bra she pulled it off not breaking their kiss. Nipping at her bottom lip she kissed her more firmly sliding her tongue into her mouth and rubbing it against hers. Reaching for Krystal&#8217;s jeans she undid them and helped her slide out of them pulling her panties down as well. Grinning Sam undid her left shoe and slid her scrubs and panties off before sitting back on the edge of the bath tub undoing her prosthetic. Setting it down she beckoned Krystal to her, pulling her down and kissing her again as she reached up and rubbed the head of her cock. Hearing Krystal moan she released her and grinned at her before moving forward and engulfing the head of Krystal&#8217;s cock into her mouth. Grinning up at her slave she gave her a rare treat as she began sucking and rolling her tongue against the ultra sensitive head of Krystal&#8217;s cock. The shaft itself wouldn&#8217;t get hard but as Sam sucked and nibbled she heard Krystal&#8217;s sighs of pleasure. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sucking and licking she teased the woman before her working the head of her cock in a way she knew Krystal liked. They joked about the head of her cock being her clit and found that she could still achieve orgasm this way though the production of semen was rather small. Bobbing her head up and down on her, Sam grinned up at Krystal and reached up flicking her nipples with her fingers before pinching and rubbing them making her back arch and her knees go weak. The little slut was so easy to manipulate to orgasm.&nbsp; Pulling back she grinned up at her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You&#8217;re not close already are you girl?� Sam taunted as she went back to sucking and rolling her tongue over the head. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh god yes Mistress.� Krystal moaned out as she reached out and braced herself on the wall.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�And just yesterday you were allowed to cum were you not girl?� Sam continued taunting as she worked the head of her cock harder teasing and making the pressure build.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mistress.� Krystal gasped out.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Then get down here and pleasure me and just maybe I&#8217;ll let you cum again today girl.� Sam laughed as she pulled back and refused to touch the panting woman before her. Krystal&#8217;s face fell in frustration but she quickly dropped to her knees and bowed her head.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mistress.� Krystal said quietly as she moved forward between Sam&#8217;s leg and stump as Sam spread them baring her wet pussy.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good girl.� Sam said as she ran her fingers through Krystal&#8217;s hair.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Krystal wasted no time delving into Sam&#8217;s pussy. She knew she was not allowed to use her hands to help her and quickly went to work attacking Sam&#8217;s clit flicking the ball of her piercing back and forth before sucking her clit into her mouth hard. Hearing Sam&#8217;s cry of pleasure she started humming against her clit working her lips against it and sending vibrations through her. Sam&#8217;s head fell back and she gripped Krystal&#8217;s hair holding her to her quivering pussy as she arched her back enjoying her slave&#8217;s attention. Releasing Sam&#8217;s clit she took a long lick up her pussy tasting her Mistress and enjoying her wetness. Pressing her tongue into her entrance she circled it deeply pressing in and beginning to fuck her slightly with it. Licking up to her clit she started teasing her writing the alphabet with her tongue against Sam&#8217;s clit. She knew this drove her Mistress wild by the time she reached the letter S and rarely got to finish the alphabet. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Krystal was right and by the time she reached P Sam demanded that she stop teasing her and make her&nbsp; cum. Krystal was more than happy to oblige. Sucking Sam&#8217;s clit into her mouth again she bit down gently and began flicking her piercing back and forth quickly. Sam let out a cry and Krystal could feel her body tense getting ready to release in the ultimate pleasure. Working her tongue harder against her Mistress she started nibbling against her clit bringing her pain and pleasure. Sam saw white as her orgasm crashed over her making her clamp her legs around Krystal&#8217;s head and throw her head back in total pleasure as she came grinding her face into Krystal&#8217;s mouth. Krystal moaned feeling the woman she loved cumming hard against her and continued flicking and sucking not letting up. Sam let out a cry as her orgasm rolled on and on. Her ultra sensitive clit could hardly take it and she pushed Krystal away releasing her and holding onto the edge of the tub as she gasped her body still convulsing in pleasure.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good girl.� Sam gasped out as she felt her muscles tensing and releasing in total pleasure. She loved orgasms like this. They seemed to never end. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Thank you Mistress, you know how I love pleasing you.� Krystal said with a smile as she stayed kneeling. As much as Krystal loved cumming too, she loved pleasing her Mistress more. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I know you do. Come wash me girl.� Sam said with a soft smile as she moved into the bath tub sliding into the water carefully. Relaxing against the tub she sighed feeling completely relaxed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mistress.� Krystal said as she moved to the side of the bathtub and picked up a soft sea sponge and dipped it into the water and brought it to Sam&#8217;s arm beginning to wash her slowly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�She was only 20.� Sam said slowly as Krystal washed her gently careful to not miss a spot. �She was hit by a drunk driver. She had been my patient for 2 weeks. Her family is from near where I grew up and they hardly left her side. She had an aneurism today. They decided it was best to pull her off the ventilator.� Sam finished as tears sprang to her eyes again. It broke her heart. Death was a part of the job of a nurse. Especially an ICU nurse. It wasn&#8217;t like Sam wasn&#8217;t familiar with it. She would never get used to it as that would be to deny being human but it wasn&#8217;t unfamiliar. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That is horrible Mistress.� Krystal said as she stood and moved over Sam working the sponge over her other side carefully.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It is. I don&#8217;t know why it&#8217;s affecting me this much either. I know better than to get to close to patients. And I wasn&#8217;t too close to this girl&#8217;s family but she was just so young. And her family were devastated. I just hate that there was nothing I could do.� Sam said as she looked up at Krystal like a lost child.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You cannot stop those whose time has come from being taken Sam. Death is a part of life. You did everything you could have.� Krystal said slowly as she looked down at the vulnerable woman she loved. Sometimes D/s didn&#8217;t matter minutes after it had. Sometimes being human was more important.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I know. It&#8217;s just not fair. Murders get to live while a young girl dies. The guy who hit her gets to live while she will never get to finish college or get married or have kids. It&#8217;s not fucking fair.� Sam said as the tears rolled down her face. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No its not. All we can do is be thankful for the time we are given.� Krystal said carefully as she finished washing Sam and knelt at the edge of the tub.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I am thankful. You are so important to me Krystal. I know I don&#8217;t say it enough but you do know that right?� Sam asked slowly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes of course Mistress! I know you love me and I love you. You make me so happy. This life is all I could ask for. You have never judged me and for that I will always love you.� Krystal said with a smile.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I do love you Krystal. And any time you feel you are ready to move on and meet someone you can settle down with you know I will support that and be there 200 percent of the way.� Sam said with a soft smile.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Of course I know that. And the thought has crossed my mind. But I am happy here. I don&#8217;t want to lose you or Gabriel though mostly you Mistress.� Krystal said with a smile as she leant her forehead against Sam&#8217;s
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I don&#8217;t want to lose you either.� Sam said with a smile. Resting in the water she felt herself relaxing. Sitting there together quietly Sam felt the love and joy coming from the other woman and knew she was truly happy. Sam worried though. She never wanted to take opportunities away from Krystal to have a more conventional relationship. Though as Krystal constantly reminded her, as long as she still had her cock no relationship was going to be conventional. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Moving up out of the water Sam had Krystal help her to dry off and move into the bedroom. She didn&#8217;t bother with clothes opting to rest in bed the rest of the evening. Hearing the doorbell ring, she sent Krystal to go get their dinner and let Nova in. Relaxing back against the pillows she turned the TV on and ordered a movie for the night from on demand. When Krystal returned with their food she smiled patting the spot next to her. Enjoying their Chinese food and movie it didn&#8217;t take long for Nova to come up following the smell of food. Eating Sweet and sour chicken with rice Sam was glad to not be alone. When they were finished she sent Krystal to take the leftovers downstairs where she knew they would get eaten. When the girl returned she ordered her up into the bed where the cuddled up together to finish the movie. When Gabriel got home that night he was greeted to a quiet house. Going upstairs he found Krystal sitting up in bed with Sam fast asleep curled up against her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Is she ok?� he whispered as he came into the room and set his backpack down over by the desk before coming to the bedside and petting Nova.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�She had a rough day, she lost a patient. A young girl.� Krystal whispered back as she smoothed Sam&#8217;s hair back off her face.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I see. Let me change and then I&#8217;ll stay with her. I know you have work in the morning.� Gabriel said as he moved to the closet stripping out of his clothes and leaving his boxers on. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Thanks.� Krystal whispered back as she shifted off the bed. Gabriel climbed up carefully so as not to wake Sam.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Of course. I&#8217;ll see you tomorrow. Thank you for taking care of her girl.� Gabriel said with a smile as he reached out and pulled Krystal to him kissing her gently on the lips.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You&#8217;re welcome Sir. Goodnight.� Krystal said with a smile as she stepped back and left the room.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Getting down into bed Gabriel smiled down at his wife knowing she could be sensitive at times. It was the Cancer in her. Not that he believed horoscopes generally but it was pretty cool to think about. Curling up with her he turned on the TV quietly catching up on one of his shows as he fell asleep.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sam awoke the next morning feeling better about things. Reaching for her crutches she tried not to wake Gabriel as she got out of bed and started getting ready for work. Showering and applying her makeup she dried her hair and tied it back in a long pony tail before getting dressed. Dressing in burgundy scrub bottoms with a white and burgundy hello kitty scrub top she knew attached her prosthetic before heading downstairs to make breakfast and get her lunch things together. Making an egg with cheese in it she ate it slowly before drinking a glass of orange juice. Since her gastric bypass she had to be careful how much she was and wasn&#8217;t eating. She could only just now handle citric and drinking with her meals. Packing a lunch filled with lean protein and her daily mix of vitamins she took her morning dose of supplements before packing the rest of her things including a big bottle of water. Checking the calendar she grinned seeing that the next day was Krystal and Gabriel&#8217;s days off and that she had a short shift. This would be the opportune time to do a scene she had been planning for quite some time. Writing Gabriel and Krystal a note to prepare dinner and make no evening plans she pinned it to the refrigerator. Gathering her things she headed to work.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All day at the hospital she had been distracted. She couldn&#8217;t help but be excited about the coming night. She had thought about it many times and was excited to finally get to put her plan into action. Going through her day working with the families of her patients she was surprised to find a card for her on her desk. Opening it during her lunch she was touched to see it was from the mother of the patient she had lost the day before, thanking her for all of her hard work. It made her choke up a little and she knew that she was doing a good job. Finishing her shift she was pleased that nothing to traumatic seemed to happen. Getting in her car she headed to her favorite part of the city. Hoping on Folsom street she grinned as she drove down the street she paraded her slaves around on every year at Folsom street fair. Finding a parking spot she grabbed her purse and headed to one of her favorite sex shops. Walking in she was pleased to see her long time friend Melissa working. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Hey!� Sam called with a big smile as she walked into the shop and over to Melissa hugging her. �How are you?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good how are you? Look at you all scrubbed out.� Melissa teased as she saw that Sam was still dressed in her scrubs from work.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m good. Planning a little fun for tonight and figured I had to stop by here and get a few things first.� Sam said with an evil grin. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh fun! Well let me know if you need help with anything!� Melissa said with a smile before returning to what she was doing. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sam moved to the latex section of the store and started looking at the various racks. Spotting the item she wanted she was looking for she went over to it and started looking for her size. Normally she preferred to custom order latex but given the cut of the dress she knew it would be fine if she didn&#8217;t. Finding the size large she grinned and took it off the rack. Walking back to the counter where Melissa was going over order forms she grinned and held it out.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�This should do it today I think.� Sam said with a grin. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh la la la I wondered when you were going to finally buy this one. Sounds like Gabriel and Krystal are in for a fun night.� Melissa laughed as she rang Sam up and pulled a garment back out sipping the outfit into it. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I would think so.� Sam said with a laugh as she handed over her credit card. She wasn&#8217;t in the habit of dropping hundreds of dollars on an outfit without planning for it but today was a special case. Signing her recite she thanked Melissa and took the garment bag before heading back to the car. Driving home she couldn&#8217;t stop grinning. Pulling up to the house she grabbed her stuff and made sure the garment wasn&#8217;t showing within the bag before heading up to the house. Opening the door she was pleased to see Krystal setting the table while Gabriel was cooking away at the stovetop.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m home.� Sam said brightly as she set her bags down and stuck the garment bag in the hall closet. Walking into the kitchen she caught the smell of cheese and meat and wondered what Gabriel was making. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Hello Mistress.� Krystal said as Sam walked over to her and gave her a huge kissing her softly. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Thank you for last night by the way.� Sam said as she moved over to Gabriel coming up behind him and grabbing his ass as she pressed against him looking around him at the stovetop where she was greeted to the sight of quesadillas cooking away. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Hey.� Gabriel said as he turned and gave Sam a quick peck on the lips. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Have a good day you two?� Sam asked as she leaned against the counter and watched Gabriel finish dinner and move it to the table.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I did. Work was busy but not too bad. I&#8217;ll be glad for my day off tomorrow.� Krystal said cheerfully as she got a pitcher of water out of the refrigerator and set it on the table. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�My day was ok; I passed my test in accounting.� Gabriel said as he pulled Sam&#8217;s chair out gesturing for her to come and sit down. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good I&#8217;m glad to hear it.� Sam said as she came and took a seat at the dinner table. They ate dinner together, talking about the coming weekend and the various things they had to get done. They had all been invited over to a friend of theirs house for a baby shower and Sam was excited to go. Finishing dinner Sam ordered Gabriel to clean up and asked Krystal to grab the garment back out of the hall closet and meet her upstairs. Going upstairs she peeled off her clothes stripping completely but leaving her prosthetic on. Putting on a pair of heels she heard Krystal come into the room.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Help me put this on.� Sam said as she grabbed a special bottle of lube for Latex and walked over to the bed. Taking the garment bag from Krystal she undid it and smiled at the contents. Inside was a short white strapless dress with bright red piping. With it was a shrug also in white with red piping sporting two red crosses, the mark of a nurse. Inside was also an old styled nurse&#8217;s hat done in latex. Handing Krystal the lube she held her arms out to the side. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mistress.� Krystal said with a nod as she took the lube and rubbed it into Sam&#8217;s stomach and breasts before taking the dress out of the garment bag and lubing up the inside. Sam held her hands up over her head as Krystal pulled the dress on over her head. Aided by the lube the dress slid snuggly down over Sam&#8217;s breasts and slid into place. It wasn&#8217;t a perfect fit but it was a good fit and Sam was pleased with it. Reaching for the shrug she put it on before grabbing the hat and walking into the bathroom. Placing the hat upon her head she arranged it carefully before nodding and grabbing red lipstick. Putting the red lipstick on she walked out of the bathroom to a grinning Krystal. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�So what do you think?� Sam asked as she struck a small pose showing off the tightly fitting short nurse&#8217;s dress. Krystal could only stare for a minute.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It is gorgeous Mistress.� She finally managed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good girl. You remember me talking with you about casting Gabriel right? Well tonight we are going to do it. Is that clear girl?� Sam asked as she moved towards the door.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mistress. I will gladly assist you.� Krystal responded quickly. Heading downstairs behind Sam, Krystal knew Gabriel was in for it.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sam walked downstairs feeling her Domme side taking over.&nbsp; It felt like there was this lioness within her that would come roaring out when she allowed it. Most of the time it was content to be fairly quiet, though never truly quiet, tonight it was roaring to life and she could feel her fingers itch in anticipation at was to come. Reaching the bottom of the stairs she moved towards the kitchen hearing Gabriel finishing the dishes. Stopping she turned to Krystal.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Set up the supplies we talked about girl in the guest bedroom.� Sam said firmly as she turned back to Gabriel who had turned off the water and was watching her over the sink. The look in his eyes told her all she needed to know. �Boy, get over her and kiss the toe of my heel. You&#8217;ve been much too casual this evening.� She demanded as she met his eyes challenging him to disobey her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mistress.� Gabriel said quickly as he quickly rushed to her, dropping to his knees and kissing the toe of her heel. Sam watched him carefully as he sat up and kept his head down. Grabbing his hair she yanked his head back making him look at her. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You are going to be kept completely at my mercy until I deem you able to be released from my binds. I know your schedule is free so there is no reason why you should object. Follow me on your hands and knees like a good little puppy.� Sam said as she released him and turned heading down the hallway and entering the room where Krystal was gathering supplies. Walking into the room she was glad to see that Krystal was making use of the medical table, having dragged it near the bed and was laying supplies on it including gauze, foam pads, rolls of what looked like vet wrap, a catheter set with bag, tube and actual catheter, gloves, lube and a bucket with towels on the floor. Krystal was just setting the last roll of gauze down when Sam walked over to her and kissed her cheek. �Good girl. Wait at the foot of the bed while I get this boy ready. Strip boy.� Sam demanded as she turned and looked down upon him tapping her foot lightly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gabriel scurried to strip his clothes off quickly. Pulling his shoes and socks off Sam had to bite her lip to keep from laughing at how fast he shed the rest of his clothing. Kneeling naked on the cold floor Gabriel kept his head down and waited. Sam walked over to the side of the bed and turned back to him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Come here boy and get up on the bed. I want you to lay on your stomach with your legs out over the edge of the bed. You can use the edge to rest your knees on boy.� Sam demanded as she moved forward and pulled on gloves. Gabriel quickly moved up onto the bed laying on his stomach and putting his legs in the air like she asked. He had an idea what was about to happen and was excited but trying not to show it. He could hear Sam moving around behind him but had no idea what she was doing. �Krystal go fetch my blow dryer and an extension cord. Boy if you haven&#8217;t guessed by now what is going on, I&#8217;m about to make one of your fantasies come true. I&#8217;m going to put you in a full body cast boy and keep you there until I decide you can be released.� Sam said her voice dropping to a purr as she picked up the scissors and gauze and moved to his left leg begging to wrap it carefully in gauze creating a sleeve. Krystal quickly rushed from the room and could be heard moving about upstairs.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m going to enjoy this Gabriel. Having you completely at my mercy. I&#8217;m going to put a catheter in you and leave you here while I go about my life. Krystal will of course be around to help you eat and drink but you will not be leaving this bed anytime soon.� Sam continued as she moved down his calf to his knee, straightening his leg out carefully so that it had a softer bend in it before continuing to wrap the gauze up his thigh. Krystal came back downstairs coming into the room and plugging the extension cord and blow dryer in and bringing it over to the table. �Good girl. Put on a pair of gloves and unwrap a roll of the fiber glass casting there and hand it to me. Bring the bucket and towel over here as well. And then hold this.� Sam said as she finished wrapping his leg carefully with thick gauze and foam. Holding the end carefully she watched as Krystal did what she asked. Taking the black fiber glass casting roll from Krystal she dipped it in the water and started unrolling it activating its cement like properties. Starting at his foot she began wrapping carefully while Krystal held the top part of the gauze in place. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Keeping the black fiber glass roll wet she wrapped over his foot and around his ankle working carefully up his calf. Reaching the end of the first role she reached over and opened a second working her way higher and higher keeping it wet and helping the fiber glass bind together. Making her way over his knee she grinned a Krystal knowing Krystal was fascinated. Finishing the up the first of the two full leg casts that kept his legs immobile with soft bends at the knees, Sam picked up the blow dryer and turned&nbsp; it on hot letting the hot air seal the cast completely making it solid and preventing him from having any movement within it. Once satisfied with her work she moved to his right leg and began working to do the same thing. Krystal helped, offering a third hand when Sam needed it and within twenty minutes they had both of his legs bound completely within full leg casts. Sealing the right one with hot air Sam grinned at her handy work.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Such a good boy, not moving and keeping still for me. Roll over and sit up boy.� Sam demanded as she stepped back to watch him struggle. Gabriel did struggle a bit unused to the strange weights on his legs. Flipping onto his back he used his arms to sit up slowly letting his legs hang off the bed awkwardly. Sam grinned and moved towards him grabbing him by the chin and making him look at her before kissing him deeply. Pulling back she grinned at him. �And now for your torso and arms.� Sam laughed as she stepped back and grabbed the gauze and foam again.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With Krystal&#8217;s help the started on his torso wrapping the gauze and foam thickly but not too tightly about his entire body. Sam could see how in lust he was by the whole situation. His silence spoke of his fear and humiliation but his eyes spoke clearly to her of his joy. He was quickly entering subspace something she loved to see him do. It brought out the protector and Domme in her like nothing else. Working the gauze up over his shoulders and down his arms carefully Sam had Krystal fetch a couple of safety pins to hold the gauze in place so that she wouldn&#8217;t have to have Krystal holding two things at once. Once the layer of gauze and foam was in place she set to work fiber glass casting his torso. She was glad she had chosen black fiber glass loving the contrast of it with his pale skin, dark hair and steely blue eyes. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It took Sam forty minutes to get his entire torso and arms wrapped but the end effect was worth it. His arms were held slightly out away from his body with his elbows bent slightly. The only thing he could move were his fingers, his hips and his head. Grinning at her handy work she began blow drying the fiber glass with hot air while sending Krystal to fetch a camera. She couldn&#8217;t resist wanting pictures of her sub this way. Moving towards him she kissed him again deeply unable to resist. Winding her fingers into his hair she kept her lips against his sensually.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Having you completely helpless and at my mercy has me wet like nothing else boy. Do you like knowing you make your Mommy this wet?� Sam asked bringing up another side of their relationship that she loved. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mommy.� Gabriel whispered against her lips as he nuzzled her gently sliding deeper into subspace.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You want Mommy to take care of you don&#8217;t you baby?� She cooed to him nipping at his lip and watching his eyes slide out of focus.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mommy. Please take care of me Mommy. I just want to be a good boy for you.� Gabriel begged quietly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I will little one. Be a good boy for Mommy.� Sam smiled as she released him and stepped back as Krystal came back into the room coming over and handing Sam the camera. Sam quickly took a few pictures before setting the camera aside and having Krystal help her get Gabriel situated on the bed Moving him back against the pillows they made sure he was comfortable with two pillows under his knees and pillows behind him. Once he was settled Sam moved back to the table and changed her gloves before picking up the lube and the catheter kit. Moving to the side of the bed she ordered Krystal to retrieve the keys to his chastity device. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Mommy is going to make sure you can&#8217;t have any accidents by putting a catheter in.� Sam said slowly as she stroked along the bare skin of his hips towards his groin. Watching him blush lightly she grinned. �It embarrasses you to know whoever walks in here is going to be able to see you so vulnerable with a bag of your own pee attached to her leg doesn&#8217;t it?� Sam asked as she&nbsp; watched him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mommy.� Gabriel responded as he looked down in shame.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Maybe I should make you drink your pee from the bag.� Sam taunted.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�If that would please you Mommy.� Gabriel said quietly. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good boy.� Sam responded as she reached up and stroked his hair. Krystal came in the room again and handed Sam the keys. Reaching down Sam carefully unlocked Gabriel from his chastity and slid his cock out. Setting the curve and keys aside she picked up the end of the catheter and the lube. Seeing him hard she chuckled as she started lubing up the catheter tube. Putting a dot of lube on the tip of his cock she moved the end of the tube forward and slid it into his urethra carefully alongside his piercing. Hearing his sharp intake of breath she pulled back slightly before advancing the tubing in. Slowly working the tubing into his urethra she moved it back and forth lubing the entire length as she gently fucked his urethra. Gabriel&#8217;s moans and gasps encouraged her at last she felt some resistance and knew she was about to enter his bladder. Pushing forward firmly but carefully she inserted the catheter completely within him clamping the end of the hose shut before his urine could begin leaking out she had Krystal move forward and attach the bag. Once it was attached she attached it to right leg via elastic hooks that attached to either side and helped it fill without leaking back into him. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�All set. Such a good boy.� Sam taunted as she stepped back and looked down at her handy work.&nbsp; Picking up the camera she took a picture of the final result. Taking her gloves off she moved over to Krystal and kissed her deeply. �Thank you for being a good assistant girl. Tonight you will sleep downstairs on the couch in case the boy here needs anything. Clean up in here and then get ready for bed.� Sam ordered as she pulled back and walked over to Gabriel. Leaning down she kissed him gently before pulling back. �Sleep well little one. Mommy will come check on you&nbsp; in the morning. For now I am going to go relax and watch T.V. upstairs with Nova and fall asleep. Enjoy the peace and quiet.� Sam said with a grin as she turned and walked to the door.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mommy.� Gabriel said quietly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mistress. Goodnight Mistress.� Krystal said with a nod as she started cleaning up the medical supplies.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Goodnight.� Sam said as she walked out the door and heading upstairs. Going to her bedroom she carefully peeled her clothing off and kicked off her heels. Grabbing a damp towel she wiped the lube off her body using soap and water and then toweling dry. Going out into the bedroom she called to Nova and gave him a couple of pats before climbing up into bed and taking her prosthetic off. Lying back in the pillows she turned the TV on before dosing off enjoying the peace and quiet after a long day. She was looking forward to the next day when the real fun would begin. 
Waking bright and early the next morning far before she needed to, Sam got out of bed and took a quick shower before getting ready for work. Dressing in her scrubs and putting on tennis shoes with her prosthetic she headed downstairs quietly. Walking quietly so as not to wake Krystal who was fast asleep on the couch she snuck into the guest bedroom. She could hear Gabriel fast asleep and grinned. Finding her way over to one of the chests she quietly retrieved a long thin box. Moving over to the bed she set the box down on the bedside table before going and getting a bottle of lube. In the early morning light she could see fairly well but knew he wasn&#8217;t aware she was there yet. Moving up onto the bed next to him carefully she watched him shift and open his eyes.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good morning boy.� Sam teased as she moved over him and kissed him deeply.&nbsp; Nipping at his lip she moved over him and straddled him as she continued kissing him deeply. She was light enough that with his torso cast on she could use it for support without crushing him while her prosthetic stuck out to the side on the bed unable to bend and be knelt on. Running her hands through his hair she tugged it gently and ran her finger nails over his scalp. Sucking his tongue into her mouth she stroked hers against his sensually. Pulling his head back into the pillow she grinned down at him. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good morning Mommy.� Gabriel said quietly as he looked up at her sleepily. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�How did you sleep?� Sam asked as she moved off of him and stepped down onto the floor on the left side of the bed. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Fine Mommy but I missed you.� Gabriel whined as he watched her clamp the hose on his catheter before detaching the bag of urine and hold it up. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Such a sweet boy. Are you thirsty?� Sam asked with a gleam in her eye as she held the urine bag.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No Mommy�� Gabriel said carefully as he bit his lip.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Are you lying to me Gabriel?� Sam demanded as her eyes narrowed at him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Y-yes Mommy� but I don&#8217;t want to have to drink my pee.� Gabriel said quietly as he refused to look at her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�And why is that? Do you not love drinking Mommy&#8217;s pee when she allows you the pleasure of her urine?� Sam asked as she put a hand on her hip.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I do love drinking your pee Mommy but�� Gabriel started.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Enough boy. You know you will drink your pee if I so choose don&#8217;t you?� Sam demanded
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mommy.� Gabriel said quietly as he looked down.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good.� Sam said shortly before turning and walking out of the room. Going into the kitchen she got a glass down and filled it part of the way with room temperature water. Taking the urine bag she carefully poured his pee into the glass before pouring the rest down the sink. Letting the water wash it down she turned it off and grinned at the mixture. It still smelt and looked like pee and would taste like it but it would also give him the water he needed to not become dehydrated. Not that she was going to tell him she had done this. Grabbing a straw for him to drink from and the now empty urine bag she headed out of the kitchen. Walking back to the room she moved over to the bed side and held the cup out for him to see. �You are to drink this down understand me boy?� Sam asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mommy.� Gabriel said as he swallowed and looked at the glass. Satisfied Sam brought the straw up to his lips for him to drink. Grinning she watched as he took a deep breath and began drinking. She could tell he was trying to swallow it down as fast as he could and pulled the glass away from him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Not so fast little one. You don&#8217;t want to give yourself a stomach ache.� Same taunted as she moved the glass back towards him. �You know I&#8217;m going to punish you for lying to me don&#8217;t you?� Sam asked slowly as she watched him begin drinking again but more slowly this time. Watching him swallow each mouthful of pee she wanted to laugh. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mommy. I&#8217;m sorry for lying to you. Especially about something so stupid Mommy.� Gabriel said as he finished the last of his pee. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You will be sorry little one.� Sam said as she patted his head and set the glass down on the bedside. With the light coming through the window she could easily see now. Going and getting a pair of gloves she pulled them on before moving back to his side and grasping his cock carefully. He was semi hard as was typical for him in the morning. Stroking him carefully she moved up to the head of his cock and carefully began removing the catheter tube. Sliding it out she was pleased to see there was no urine in the tubing. Setting the catheter to the side she moved back to the head of his cock and carefully removed his Prince Albert piercing. Setting the jewelry to the side she picked up the long thing box and brought it to the bedside. Opening it slowly she pulled out a long instrument that looked like a strange silver straw. Holding it up for Gabriel to see she grinned seeing his eyes widen in surprise and desire. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Be a good boy and let Mommy play.� Sam teased as she reached for the lube. Lubing up the urethral sound she moved it to the head of Gabriel&#8217;s cock and slowly lubed up his urethra opening and piercing. Sliding the first part of the sound in she looked up at him to see his reaction. His eyes closed in anticipation and pleasure as the sound slid into the head of his cock. Moving it slowly up and down she pressed the sound deeper into his urethra. Thrusting it slowly in and out of him she slid it deeper and deeper until it was lodged entirely inside his now completely hard cock without going too deeply so as to cause damage. Watching his face Sam slowly began sliding the sound in and out of his urethra going quickly with short thrusts and then slowing down to move back and forth smoothly varying the friction in his cock.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hearing his moan of pleasure she grinned and continued working the sound in and out of him at varying speeds. Reaching down with her left hand she continued fucking his urethra as she started playing with his balls squeezing and fondling them gently. Watching him try to arch into her touch only to be stopped by the cast made her chuckle as she continued fucking him gently and rubbing his balls. Moving her hand off his balls she started carefully twisting the sound as she thrust it in and out of him letting it slide left and right as it moved in and out of him. Hearing his sharp intake of breath she smiled and moved it faster in and out of him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh God Mommy�� Gabriel whined as she continued working it in and out of him her wrist moving quickly making the sound fuck his urethra fast and while still keeping the movements controlled so as not to damage him. She could tell the sensation of having to pee and but also making him want to cum was overwhelming him. It was making him squirm and squeeze his eyes as he clenched his fists against the casts. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Does Mommy&#8217;s little sex toy like having his urethra fucked?� Sam taunted as she continued moving quickly in and out, thrusting smoothly and quickly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mommy. Oh yes Mommy.� Gabriel moaned as rolled his hips slightly moving with her as she fucked his urethra. Reaching down she started fondling his balls again rubbing and cupping them completely as she continued fucking him faster in short thrusts. Hearing him cry out she knew he was so close. She could feel his balls tightening in the palm of her hand and grinned.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Does the boy want to cum for Mommy?� Sam asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mommy please Mommy let me cum for you.� Gabriel moaned out as his breathing became short and labored. Sam continued her movements not backing off but driving him closer and closer to the ever nearing peak, knowing he would not cum without her explicit permission. He could not cum without her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Why should I let the lying boy cum?� Sam asked as she squeezed his balls.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�PLEASE Mommy! I&#8217;ll be a good boy! I&#8217;ll never lie again! Please let me cum Mommy!� Gabriel cried out and she knew he was starting to be in pain from holding back. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Hmmmm�.� Sam taunted as she cocked her head to the side watching him. Moving her hand off his balls she smoothly pulled the sound out of him with a small pop. �No. You&#8217;ll suffer today boy.� Sam teased as she stepped away from him hearing his whimper of frustration. Setting the sound down she picked up his PA jewelry and moved back to the head of his cock rubbing him and grinning at his eyes squeezed shut in concentration. Placing the jewelry back in she reinserted the catheter as well before attaching the bag back. Moving it back to his leg she stepped away from the bed and pulled off her gloves.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Aren&#8217;t you going to thank me for checking on you boy and wish me a good day at work?� Sam asked as she looked down at him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Thank you for checking on me. Have a good day at work Mommy.� Gabriel said as he caught his breath, keeping control, his cock hard as a rock. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good boy. Be good and enjoy your day.� Sam said with a smile as she leaned over and kissed his forehead before gathering the sounds and her gloves and heading out of the room. Walking past the living room she saw Krystal sitting up looking at her from over the back of the couch.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good Morning Mistress� that was quite hot and quite evil.� Krystal said with a smile.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Be a good bitch and I won&#8217;t do it to you.� Sam said with a smile as she entered the kitchen and threw her gloves away before setting the sounds on the counter, the used sound on top of the box. �Wash the sound when you get a chance. And make sure he drinks plenty of fluids. No solid food.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mistress.� Krystal said quietly as she lay back down on the couch. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good girl.� Sam said as she fixed herself a quick breakfast and her lunch before heading to work. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At work all day Sam couldn&#8217;t believe how turned on she was. She was dripping wet the entire day. She had no idea having him casted like this and completely at her mercy would turn her on so much. Sure they had talked about doing something like this for years but they had never actually gotten around to doing it. She hadn&#8217;t anticipated being this turned on. Going about her work was challenging but she made herself focus and concentrate. Her patients needed her and she wasn&#8217;t going to be forgetful with them just because she was horny as hell. When at last the end of the day came she couldn&#8217;t wait to head home. The drive seemed to take hours. When she finally pulled up at the house she had to stop herself from rushing in. Sometimes she could be like an impatient little girl who wanted her dolls. Walking up to the house she unlocked the door and went inside. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Welcome home Mistress.� Krystal said with a smile as she got up off the couch where she had been watching TV and took Sam&#8217;s purse and lunch bag.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Thank you girl.� Sam said as she handed the bags over. �How is the boy doing?� Sam asked as she walked towards the stairs.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�He&#8217;s bored Mistress but otherwise good.� Krystal responded easily.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Bored is he? Such a shame, I figured he would have convinced you to entertain him. Be a good girl and put my things away. I&#8217;ll make dinner in a little bit.� Sam said as she headed upstairs bypassing the guest bedroom where she could just make out Gabriel straining to catch her eye. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mistress.� Krystal responded quickly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Going upstairs Sam changed out of her scrubs and detached her prosthetic leaving her bra and panties on she shrugged and grabbed her crutches. There was really no reason to have a bunch of clothes on tonight. Crutching her way downstairs she entered Gabriel&#8217;s bedroom and grinned seeing him looking eagerly at her. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Welcome home. How was work Mommy?� Gabriel asked eagerly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Work was fine. Have you been a good boy for Krystal?� Sam asked as she crutched over to the bed where he was propped up on the pillows. Kneeling carefully on the bed via her stump with her left leg on the ground she looked him over.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mommy.� Gabriel said quickly as he looked at her taking in her body, dressed only in a black bra and black panties. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Were you bored boy?� Sam asked as she glanced down at his hard cock so very like the way she had left him. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mommy. I had nothing to do all day.� Gabriel said with a sigh.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Let&#8217;s see if we can give you something to &#8216;do&#8217;.� Sam said as she stood balancing herself carefully as she pulled the pillows out from under him making him lay back completely. Sliding her panties down she maneuvered them over her stump before letting them drop to the floor. Moving up onto the bed she knelt awkwardly as she moved up over him straddling his face. �Eat Mommy&#8217;s pussy boy.� She demanded as she used the bars on the bed to balance and brace herself lowering her pussy over his face onto his mouth. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gabriel didn&#8217;t answer but dove into her cunt. Feeling him lick slowly up her folds she shivered in pleasure. She knew she was dripping wet from having to wait all day for this. Arching her back she spread her stump more to the side opening her pussy up to him even more. Feeling his skilled tongue lick up her and settle on her clit she moaned feeling him flick her piercing. Biting her lip she let out a low moan and moved against his tongue as he flicked it against her clit piercing over and over again just slowly enough to drive her nuts. She was already so turned on from earlier she knew it wouldn&#8217;t take much for her to cum. But she wanted him to work for it. Feeling him lick back to her entrance and swirl his tongue against it fucking her shallowly she moaned and sat more on his face keeping her weight carefully held off him. Tilting her hips back she allowed him to breathe before he delved back in and wrapped his lips around her clit sucking it into his mouth.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Crying out her hips bucked in pleasure as she threw her head back her hair tickling her back making her feel even sexier as she moved her hips back and forth against his sucking and nibbling mouth. Her body hummed with pleasure as she built quickly to orgasm. Gripping the headboard tightly she cried out as her orgasm broke over her suddenly. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good boy!� She cried as she rolled her hips against him her body tensing in total pleasure. He continued licking her in long strokes of his tongue, letting the barbell in his tongue drag against her clenching pussy. Feeling the pleasure ebbing slowly she moaned and slowly pulled up and swung off his face. Moving down on the bed next to him she couldn&#8217;t help but lean over and lick his lips tasting herself on him. Licking through his goatee up to his lips she kissed him tasting her juices on his lips and moaning. Teasing his tongue with hers she grinned and pulled back. �Such a good boy making Mommy cum. Good little sex toy.� She teased as she moved off the bed and grabbed her crutches. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Thank you Mommy.� Gabriel said with a grin as he laid relaxed laying back against the pillows. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sam grinned back at him before crutching her way out of the bedroom and into the living room. Crutching over to the couch she collapsed down on it still wound up. Grinning at Krystal she sighed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Screw it I&#8217;m so not making dinner. Order pizza?� Sam asked with a laugh as she looked over at her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You know I&#8217;m always game for that.� Krystal said with a smile as she reached over and grabbed the phone. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Plus it&#8217;ll torture Gabriel that he can&#8217;t have any.� Sam laughed as Krystal dialed the number. �Get a large pizza for you and Gabriel and get me a chicken Caesar salad.� Sam said as she leaned back into the cushions watching whatever random reality TV show Krystal had on. Krystal ordered before turning back to watching TV. They didn&#8217;t have to wait too long for the doorbell to ring. Getting up Krystal handed Sam one of the blankets so she would be covered before opening the door and paying. Shutting and locking the door she brought the food over to the couch. Sam didn&#8217;t usually let them eat on the couch but Krystal could tell Sam was tired and not going to enforce her usual eating rules. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eating in the glow of the TV, Sam wondered how long before she should go tease Gabriel with the knowledge that Krystal was eating his favorite Pizza. Eating the chicken on her salad first she picked at the greens filling up quickly. Relaxing back against the couch for a minute she watched Krystal devour half of the pizza. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Were you hungry?� Sam laughed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Just a bit.� Krystal said as she blushed lightly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well I&#8217;m glad you enjoyed it. When you&#8217;re done will you go get the Dremel out of the garage and attach the saw head to it? I&#8217;ll need it in a bit but first I want to go have more fun with him.� Sam said with a grin as she stood and balanced on her crutches heading for the bedroom. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mistress� Krystal said as she stood and headed for the garage.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Crutching her way into the bedroom she grinned when she saw Gabriel waiting still hard. Making her way over to the medical table she reached down and grabbed the bucked out from under it. Carrying it over to the bedside she knelt slightly on the bed with her stump to balance herself so she could set her crutches aside. Reaching for his cock she slowly slide the catheter out. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Have you enjoyed being hooked up to a catheter boy?� Sam asked as she removed it and detached the bag from his leg. Setting it down in the bucket she turned back to him moving up on the bed towards him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Sort of Mommy. It is humiliating that everyone can see my pee.� Gabriel said honestly as he watched her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�See, telling the truth is easy.� Sam taunted. �You didn&#8217;t like it when I left you all hot and bothered this morning and so close to cumming did you?� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No Mommy.� Gabriel said honestly as he looked down at his still hard cock. It had gone down at various points in the day when she wasn&#8217;t here but as soon as she had come in the room wearing such little clothing he couldn&#8217;t help but get hard again.&nbsp; She was so ridiculously sexy.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Do you think you have been taught not to lie to me about stupid things boy?� Sam asked carefully.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mommy. I won&#8217;t lie to you about stupid things again.� Gabriel said slowly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I hope not boy or you will seriously regret it. Sit up so I can put the pillows back.� Sam said as she moved forward. Helping him sit up she tucked the pillows back under him so he was leaning up more. �Do you have any idea how wet it makes me to have my little fuck toy completely helpless and ready for my use?� Sam asked as she moved and straddled him carefully moving over the casted part of his stomach and not letting his skin touch her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I love being your helpless fuck toy Mommy.� Gabriel said as he watched her his eyes narrowing in lust. Sam grinned and sat up undoing her bra and tossing it to the side. Once her tits were free, her nipples hard and already sensitive with the black barbells through them, she moved forward lifting one to his lips.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Suckle on Mommy.� Sam said quietly as she pressed her hard nipple to his mouth. Gabriel latched onto her nipple at once sucking it into his mouth deeply and rolling his tongue against it. Manipulating her nipple as he sucked deeply Sam moaned and closed her eyes in pleasure as she moved back feeling the head of his cock against her pussy lips. Moving down over him she started grinding back and forth along the shaft of his cock slowly. Pulling back she brought her other breast up for him to suckle and he wasted no time latching on and sucking deeply. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Moaning Sam started grinding her clit ring against the shaft of his cock careful not to catch it on his piercing. Moaning she started grinding back and forth on him harder as he sucked her using him completely for her pleasure. She was so horny she could hardly stand to not have him inside of her. Looking down at him she bit her lip. Feeling him bite down on her nipple she let out a cry. Reaching back she grasped his cock and brought it to her entrance teasing him by pressing him against her opening slowly. Pulling back she sat back slightly and watched him as he looked up at her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�How badly do you want Mommy to fuck you?� Sam asked as she rubbed the head of his cock back and forth against her. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Please Mommy use your fuck toy.� Gabriel moaned. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unable to resist anymore Sam sunk down on him slowly moaning as she felt him stretch her deliciously. Feeling the ridge of his piercing against her she bit her lip sinking down completely. Once he was completely within her she braced her hands against his casts and started riding him moving her hips up and down on him. With her stump it was slightly odd but she had long perfected it and started moving up and down on him quickly. Throwing her head back in pleasure she rolled her hips riding him harder.&nbsp; Leaning forward she kept her hips moving making his cock thrust in and out of her shallowly as she kissed him deeply pulling his hair. Teasing his tongue she bit it gently before pulling his head back and moving her lips to his neck. Moving to his pulse point she bit down and sucked as she started grinding back and forth on him. Moaning as her nipples scrapped against the roughness of the cast she released him and sat up. Riding him harder she reached down and started rubbing her clit fiercely wanting to cum. Moving up and down faster and harder against him she moaned and panted already so close.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Cum Mommy, please cum on my cock. Cum on your fuck toy Mommy.� Gabriel begged as he pushed up against her. Crying out Sam couldn&#8217;t hold back anymore and pinching her clit hard she came hard around his cock. Rolling her hips against him she rode her orgasm out completely lost in pleasure as she came. Biting her lip from the total pleasure of it all she felt her toes curling with the intensity. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good boy make Mommy cum.� She panted as she moved her fingers off her clit and rolled her hips slowly against him coming down off her orgasm. Moving against him she continued riding him drawing out her orgasm. As it subsided she leaned forward and kissed him again deeply. Nipping at his lip she started moving slowly against him again. Gabriel moaned into her mouth as she continued fucking him. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sam continued kissing him hotly letting their tongues tease and stroke each other&#8217;s as she moved against him. Rolling her hips she started moving up and down on his cock letting the pleasure build all over again for her. Pulling back she grinned down at him and brought her nipple up to his mouth again. Catching her eye he pushed his cock up into her sharply as he flicked her nipple with his tongue before biting it. Sam moaned breaking eye contact with him as her head fell back in pleasure. He knew how to manipulate her body to bring her the most pleasure. Moving up and down on his cock more quickly she moaned feeling him sucking and biting her nipple. Reaching up she started rubbing her other nipple pulling on the barbell and twisting it as she started shaking against him riding him harder. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh god baby you&#8217;re such a good boy. You&#8217;re going to make Mommy cum again. Do you want to cum with Mommy this time?� Sam moaned out as she pulled her nipple back from his mouth and braced herself against his casted chest riding his cock all the harder as her orgasm fast approached.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mommy please Mommy cum on my cock Mommy.� Gabriel begged as he strained against the casts trying to thrust up into her more. Biting her lip Sam couldn&#8217;t take it anymore.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh yes good boy I&#8217;m going to cum. Cum boy cum with Mommy cum in Mommy.� Sam demanded as she lost control and let out a cry as she started cumming hard on his cock her hips grinding against him quickly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh god yes Mommy!� Gabriel cried as he threw his head back and squeezed his eyes shut cumming hard into her with a whining cry of pleasure. Straining against his casts he came hard into her his entire body spasming with total pleasure as he erupted within her. Feeling her milking his cock as her orgasm rolled through her it helped intensify his. Staining against each other they lost themselves in total pleasure. Wave after wave of pleasure crashed over them both leaving them gasping and panting. When at last the waves of pleasure subsided Sam collapsed against him breathing hard, her face in the crook of his neck and her hands in his hair as she held onto him catching her breath. She didn&#8217;t rest her entire weight against the cast but slowly came back into herself.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good boy.� She whispered into his ear before sitting up slowly. Moving off him to the side of the bed she flopped down next to him breathing hard. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Thank you Mommy.� Gabriel said quietly as he caught his breath. His orgasm had been one of the most intense he had had. Breathing hard he felt his head spinning.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Krystal, bring the Dremel and plug it in.� Sam called as she laid back in the bed blinking a couple of times. Her body just wanted to relax completely but she couldn&#8217;t allow it to. She had to cut him out of the casts first. Krystal came into the room carrying the Dremel and an extension cord. Plugging it in she brought it over to Sam. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good Girl. Bring the Pizza as well for him.� Sam said as she sat up and moved over him taking the Dremel in hand.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mistress.� Krystal said before turning and doing as she was told.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Just relax and stay still.� Sam ordered as she fired up the saw. Cutting up his arms one by one she stopped at his neck. Working her way down his chest she cut a solid line. Once that was done she realized she didn&#8217;t have the tongs she needed to break the cast open. �Krystal! Bring me the tongs from the kitchen.� Sam ordered, improvising. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Mistress.� She heard Krystal call from the other room. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Moving to his legs she cut a solid straight line down both legs. Krystal had come by then bringing Pizza and the tongs. Setting the Dremel aside Same took the tongs and inserted them into each of the cuts in turn, doing his torso and arms first. Opening them quickly she pushed the cast part causing the fiber glass to give and break in the back and creating enough space for him to slide out.&nbsp; Helping him slide out of the torso cast and then the arm casts Sam threw the casts off the bed onto the floor.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Eat while I get you out of these. I&#8217;ll deal with this stuff tomorrow. Krystal you may go to bed or whatever. You were a very good girl helping me and I&#8217;ll reward you tomorrow.� Sam said as she felt tiredness crashing over her. Reaching out for Krystal she brought her to her kissing her sweetly before releasing her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Thank you Mistress. Goodnight.� Krystal said smiling at Gabriel who was scarfing down pizza before turning and exiting. Sam worked the tongs down Gabriel&#8217;s legs, opening the casts up. Helping slide his legs out she grinned at him when he was finally out. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You were a very very good boy.� Sam said affectionately as she tossed the used materials aside and crawled up the bed towards him where he was finishing a slice of Pizza.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Thank you Mommy.� Gabriel said as he set the plate of Pizza aside, full.&nbsp; �This was so hot, thank you.� He continued as he pulled her onto his chest hugging her and nuzzling her neck.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I have to say it was a lot hotter than I had thought it would be. But it also took a lot out of me I think. Are you ready to move upstairs or do you need a few more minutes?� Sam asked with a smile as she ran her fingers through his hair. She loved his long dark curls.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m ready to move upstairs.� Gabriel said with a nod. Helping her up and onto her crutches they made their way upstairs. Once in their bedroom Sam crutched her way into the bathroom. Turning on the bathtub she waited for the water to get warm before putting the stopper in and adding some bubble bath. Sitting on the edge of the bath tub she set her crutches aside and beckoned him to her. Wrapping her arms around him she hugged him tightly and running her hands up and down his back.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I love you so much you do know that right?� Sam said as she nuzzled him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I know. I love you too.� Gabriel said as he hugged her back. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good.� Sam said as she pulled back and kissed him softly. He returned the tender kiss running his hands through her long hair. Once the bath tub was full Sam moved to the side and beckoned him in. As he settled into the tub she moved over him and picked up a sponge. �Just relax baby.� She said with a smile as she started washing him slowly moving the sponge over his body. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Washing him she rubbed his muscles out slowly. Working her way over his front she helped him sit up before sliding down behind him in the large tub. Working her hands over his back she started rubbing out the knots he constantly got in his shoulders. Massaging him gently she enjoyed the feel of the warm water. Once he was relaxed she pulled him back against her in the water wrapping her arms around him and cuddling him to her. Nuzzling him she sighed. They laid there in the quiet of the night enjoying the glow that came from an amazing scene. As the water cooled Sam yawned deeply. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Lets go to bed.� Gabriel suggested as he moved, turning and kissing her gently before rising out of the water and grabbing a towel. Nodding Sam undid the stopper and waited while he dried himself off. Reaching out for his help, Sam had him pull her up onto her feet in the tub, using her good leg to help push herself up. Balancing she grabbed a towel and dried herself off. Reaching for her crutches she carefully maneuvered out of the bath tub. Crutching out into their bedroom she moved to the bed and climbed up dropping her towel and laying against the cool sheets. Holding the covers open to him she waited, resting on her right side.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gabriel turned off the lights before climbing up into bed. Rolling onto his right side he moved back against her letting her spoon him and wrap her body around his as best she could. Sam rested her head against his nuzzling him as she closed her eyes. Feeling safe and at peace with him wrapped in her arms she felt him relaxing. He knew he was safe and loved and that she would always be there. Drifting to sleep they were completely at ease with each other.
