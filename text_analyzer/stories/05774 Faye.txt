THE EXCHANGE

&nbsp;

Faye wasn�t told everything. How could she
have accepted the invitation if she had known it would be the last invitation
she would ever accept.

&nbsp;

John, her Master, had made all the
arrangements, and all he had to do was deliver Faye, and walk away, richer, and
ready for the next girl he had found. 

&nbsp;

It was Friday night, a night like any
other, when Faye arrived at her Master�s house. Entering the building she did
what was normally expected of her, and removed all her clothing and jewellery.
Her body had to be totally naked for her Master, not even a ring on her finger
was allowed, or a watch.

&nbsp;

�You have been invited to a party� said
John as she knelt before him. � do you accept the
invitation?�

&nbsp;

Faye knew better than to say no to him, his
word was law. He was in charge of every minute of her life, even if she were
not with him.

&nbsp;

�Yes Master, I accept� answered Faye in her
most submissive voice.

&nbsp;

�Good� said John. �The party is in the
hills, but for reasons I cant go into, you will not be
allowed to know where, you will travel tied and hooded in the boot of the car.
There will be loud music played through headphones inside the hood, to distract
you and ensure you cannot concentrate on directions. Any
questions?�



�No questions Master� answered Faye.

&nbsp;

�Okay� said John. �First I am going to tie
your hands behind you, you will then walk naked to the garage and stand behind
the car waiting further instructions. When I tell you to do so, you will climb
into the boot. And I will apply the headphones and hood. Understood?�

&nbsp;

�Yes Master, all is understood. Am I
allowed any questions?�

&nbsp;

�None at all, what will happen, will happen, you will comply at all costs�

&nbsp;

�Yes Master�

&nbsp;

John produced a short piece of rope and
told Faye to place her hands behind her. Doing so, He then proceeded to tie
them so she could not release them.

&nbsp;

As soon as her hands were tied, Faye moved
to the kitchen door, which led directly to the garage, and stood at the back of
John�s car, waiting for him to arrive.

&nbsp;

A few minutes later after making a
telephone call, John strolled into the garage and opened the boot of his car.
Faye struggled, but managed to get into the boot, laying on her side and
waiting for the next phase.

&nbsp;

John produced an MP3 player, and placed the
head phones inside Faye�s ears, and then taped them in place, so that if the
hood was ever removed, she would still not be able to remove them. Just before
turning the MP3 player on, John looked Faye in the eyes and said.

&nbsp;

�I have enjoyed using you as a slave, but
all things must end. When we arrive at our destination, you will be handed over
to your new owner, though you will not be with him long. You will never see me
again after I place the hood on you.�

&nbsp;

Before Faye could
respond. John turned the MP3 player on, and
turned the volume up full, and then placed the hood over the girl�s head, tying
it tight. This would be the last time Faye ever saw him, and once delivered,
the last time John would see her.

&nbsp;

The drive was over three hours, driving carefully, following the instructions he had been given. He
knew that without the instructions he would never find this place, and also
knew that he would never find it again, as he had been told that when he
arrived at the destination he was to hand over the instructions. It was almost
midnight when he arrived, and presented himself at the Lodge.

&nbsp;

A short conversation followed, and John was
told to drive to the garage, open the boot, and walk away, so he would not see
and later recognise any of the Lodge;s staff. What he
didn�t know, he couldn�t give evidence on.

&nbsp;

Following the instructions John drove to
the garage, and took the keys from the ignition. Part of him wanted to drive
away again, taking Faye with him, but he had been paid, and knew that no matter
what he did, or where he went, they would find him, and take Faye from him. 

&nbsp;

Walking in the gardens a hooded man came
over to him and told him he could now return to his car, and drive away. 

&nbsp;

John had not said goodbye to Faye, but the
girl was no longer in his boot when her reached his car. She was now no longer
his problem, and the money in his bank made him wealthier than he had been for
quite some time. Money seems to take away any conscience.

&nbsp;

At the gates of the property, John said a
silent and last goodbye to Faye, and hoped that she would be enjoyed by her new
owners and their guests.

&nbsp;

NEW SURROUNDINGS

&nbsp;

Faye didn�t hear the car boot open, but she
felt the hands guiding her from the car. She was led from the garage through a
door and along a long corridor, still hooded, the loud music still playing in
her ears. She stumbled once or twice, but hands prevented her from falling. 

&nbsp;

Eventually they came to a halt before a
white door, and led Faye inside it, placing her on a table, before removing the
hood, and finally, the MP3 player.

&nbsp;

Quickly and efficiently, the men who had
escorted her placed ropes on her wrists and ankles, and then tied them to the
table on which she lay.

&nbsp;

She could not see any of the men�s faces,
as they wore hood, with only their eyes visible, eyes that showed no emotion.

&nbsp;

A man in a white coat crossed the room and
approached her.

&nbsp;

�I am Doctor Williams� said the man. �it is my job to ensure you are fit and healthy, to take your
weight and measurements. Everything has to be logged perfectly to get the right
results.�

&nbsp;

Faye wanted to ask what results, but she
knew better than to question a superior being, as this Doctor was. Faye was a
slave, she obeyed, she didn�t question, ever.

&nbsp;

The Doctor gave Faye a full examination,
weighing her breasts, checking her temperature, taking blood samples, urine
samples. He also gave her a questionnaire to complete, which asked what, if
any, illnesses she had suffered between birth and now, when she started to
menstruate, how many men she had slept with. It was perhaps the most personal
thing she had ever completed, and by the end, her life story was written there
in black and white for anyone to read.

&nbsp;

Satisfied, the doctor placed a handcuff on
one of her hands before releasing it from the table. Then, brought her hand
over to the other one and cuffed that before releasing her second hand. Faye
was never going to be cuff free until the party, on Sunday.

&nbsp;

Releasing her legs, the Doctor told Faye to
stand up and wait further instructions. Obeying, Faye stood, her legs slightly
parted, her hands cuffed in front of her, wondering what would happen next.
John had said she would never see him again, so it was pretty obvious that he
had sold her to someone new, but, who was it? John had given no indication, and
she already guessed that the guy who had inspected
her, wasn�t her new owner.

&nbsp;

About half an hour later two men came into
the room and walked over to Faye, and told her to follow them, though follow
wasn�t the right word, as she walked between the two men, both hooded, so she
could not see their faces, and was led along a corridor and then up a flight of
stairs.

&nbsp;

The house, as she could see it, was well decorated, with expensive furniture, whoever
her new owner was, he was quite wealthy.

&nbsp;

The two men led her into an opulent room,
deep shag carpets, antique furniture, large windows
looking out over a great expanse of greenery, which Faye assumed was his
garden. She could see poplar trees lining an avenue through the window.

&nbsp;

A man sat at an antique desk, also hooded,
writing in a book of some sort.

&nbsp;

�Welcome� he said, without raising his
head. �You are now My property to use, abuse and
dispose of at My will. You are here for one purpose only, to entertain My guests at a party on Sunday. For this your former Master
was paid �2000, a tidy sum, if I say so Myself.�

&nbsp;

Faye was shocked, not that John had taken
the �2000, but that anyone had felt she was worth that much.

&nbsp;

�During your time here you will not speak
unless spoken to, you will see no-one�s face, as everyone except you will be
wearing hoods. You will not hear any names, simply letters of the alphabet
which may or may not refer to some one�s actual name, usually,,
it doesn�t.�

&nbsp;

�this is your last
chance to ask questions� he ended.

&nbsp;

�Why am I here?� she asked.

&nbsp;

�I told you. To entertain My guests, and for no other reason. It is how you entertain
them that should worry you, but, it matters little, as entertain them you will�

&nbsp;

�Yes Master� she replied, assuming that
this was her new owner.

&nbsp;

At this point the two men re-appeared and
guided Faye out of the room, and down the stairs
again, taking her to a sparsely furnished room which would be her home for the
next 48 hours.

&nbsp;

She was left cuffed, but other wise free as
they closed the door of the room, leaving her to investigate. The first thing she
noticed in the bathroom was that the shower was activated by foot controls. She
could shower anytime she wished and not have to worry about taps,
she assumed this was because she was staying cuffed.

&nbsp;

The bed was soft, but not too comfortable,
the bedding only light sheets, but the room was not cold, and she realised that
heavier sheets would not be needed. 

&nbsp;

There was a hole like a dog flap in the
door, with no handle, though it was only then that she realised the door itself
had no handle. She was not intended to get out of this room unaided.

&nbsp;

About an hour after she had been placed in
the room, the �dog flap� opened and a plate of food was pushed through, and a cup of hot drink. The flap closed, and Faye
moved over to the food. It wasn�t much, just two sausages and some mashed
potato, but Faye didn�t care, food was food, and after serving John for so long
she had learned that food was a gift, not a right.

&nbsp;

What Faye didn�t know was that the mashed
potato was laced with a sleeping drug,� and within a few minutes of eating it,
she lay on the bed and slipped slowly into a deep, dreamless sleep.

&nbsp;

PREPERATIONS

&nbsp;

Over the next 24 hours, Faye slept, the
powerful drug ensuring that she would not wake, until the party had started.
She was going to be the start of the party, and her owner had a lot to prepare.

&nbsp;

First were the invitations, carefully
worded, inviting them to a �tasty Party� with �special guest�.
No-one other than those who received an invite would ever know what the theme
of the party was going to be. John did not receive an invite.

&nbsp;

Faye�s new owner also had to ready the site
for the party, ensuring that everything was in order, and that all of his staff
new their places. This was going to be a splendid party, and he didn�t want his
guests disappointed, after all, they were paying over �500 a head to attend.

&nbsp;

The Champagne was already on ice, and the
barbeque pit was filled with coals ready for use. Martin felt happy with
himself, and ready for the event.

&nbsp;

He paid a visit to the still sleeping Faye
and measured her carefully, he couldn�t afford slip ups.

&nbsp;

The last thing he wanted was for Faye to
wake up too early, so he instructed one of his staff to give her another dose
of the sleeping draft by injections as she slept. He looked carefully at her.
Long brown hair, blue eyes, though now closed. She had� nice breasts, not overly large, but
certainly enough to get your teeth into. Her legs were long and athletic, a sign that Faye was no stranger to a gym, and her
pussy had been shaven clean. Closer inspection told Martin that it had been
shaved for some time, as there was a continuous suntan in that area, no bikini
or hair had stopped the suns rays from reaching her.

&nbsp;

Martin smiled to himself. She would be
perfect. 

&nbsp;

Martin� next job was to ensure the cage was
going to be the right fit for Faye. The workshops at the back of the building
were busy getting all the little things done that would make the party a
success. With practised ease metal bands were being bent and shaped to form a
cage that would hold Faye tightly. Martin smiled as he looked at the dark metal
bands, each one an inch wide, they were bent to form a cage exactly the shape
and size of Faye, once she was in it, there would be
no movement. He inspected the locks to make sure that they would not open
prematurely. He didn�t want any accidents. In five years he had never had one,
and he always said this was because everyone took complete care in their work.

&nbsp;

Walking back to his office Martin let his
mind drift back to his five years in charge of the Party. It had been a good
five years, and he had managed to entertain at least three times a year. In the
Community he had a good name, and he intended to keep it that way.

&nbsp;

Satisfied that all was in order, Martin
allowed himself to rest, there was nothing else he could do now until the party
started.

&nbsp;

THE PARTY

&nbsp;

The guests had started to arrive an hour
ago, each wearing the traditional mask, hiding their faces from each other. At
these parties it was traditional that no-one knew who anyone else was, apart
from the host, who knew and had vetted every guest.

&nbsp;

The evening air was mild, though Martin had
worried earlier that there would be a light drizzle. Rain would not have helped
matters, but it had held off. The party area was lit by a ring of low lights, encouraging
guests to enjoy themselves.

&nbsp;

Martin looked at his watch one last time,
and then climbed onto the podium, and clapped his hands to get everyone�s
attention.

&nbsp;

�Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the
Party. As you know, this is the last party of the year, and so we looked hard
to find you just the right fare for the evening. There are light snacks on the
bar if you get peckish while the main dish is cooking, and remember, if you
want your meat rare, get in quick.� At this point the guests laughed lightly.

&nbsp;

A noise to the left of the guests made them
all turn around, to see two men dressed totally in black from head to toe,
carrying a cage. It wasn�t the cage that attracted their attention, but the
contents.

&nbsp;

Faye was encased inside the cage, her arms down
by her sides, her legs closed. Each of the bars of the cage made contact with
her body, so even as she was being carried to the place of honour, no part of
her body moved. Faye still slept, as she would do for a while longer yet, the
powerful drug was enough to make her sleep, but not enough to ensure she slept
through the party.

&nbsp;

The cage was carried over to the barbeque
pit, and the two rods, one either end, were placed on stanchions at each end of
the pit. One end was fixed carefully to a motor what would revolve the cage.

&nbsp;

Martin again called for the attention of
the guests. �As you know, you all bid to see who would light the fire, and as
usual, all bids were made without knowing what else had been bid. In this way,
we do not get the same person outbidding everyone else every time. �

&nbsp;

Martin came down from the podium and walked
over to a tall woman wearing a long green evening gown, and a cat�s mask.

&nbsp;

�Congratulations,� he said. �You have won
the right to light the fire and get the festivities under way.�

&nbsp;

With this Martin escorted the lady to the
barbeque pit and stood by as she placed her fingers on the ignition switch.
With an unseen smile, her finger pressed, and a single click filled the night
air. Almost immediately the gas fuelled flames bounded into life, and the red
and yellow flames began to heat the coals.

&nbsp;

Above the coals, Faye still slept. If
Martin had judged the dose right, the drug would wear off just as the heat was
starting to cook her soft white flesh.

&nbsp;

The cage started to rotate, so that Faye
would cook evenly, and Martin joined the other guests in the traditional drink
to the volunteer.

&nbsp;

Faye started to awaken slowly, feeling more
than a little hot. It took a few seconds before she realised that the heat was
coming from below her, and that she was looking at the night sky. As the spit
rotated and she now looked down into the flames, she screamed.

&nbsp;

�Oh God, someone help me. Please. Get me
down.�

&nbsp;

But there was no sound,
the Doctor had cut her vocal chords as she slept

&nbsp;

The heat was getting greater under Faye,
her hair began to singe, and her skin began to blister. One of the attendants
poured oil on her from a bottle, ensuring that her skin didn�t dry out as it
cooked. And still Faye screamed out for someone to help, someone to free her,
but that was never going to happen.

&nbsp;

She felt herself cursing John, surely ha
hadn�t known what was going to happen after he had sold her? She could still
feel her body rotate, and the heat growing.

&nbsp;

Louder and louder she screamed, but the
guests heard nothing, few even watching their dinner cook, they would be told
when dinner was ready.

&nbsp;

Faye�s blood slowly began to boil, her
heart burning inside her as the hot blood coursed through her veins. In a few
more minutes it would be all over for Faye, her blood would no longer feed her
brain, and she would die.

&nbsp;

The attendants finally acclaimed that
dinner would be served in half an hour, and would all guests please freshen up
ready.

&nbsp;

The guests were led to the main building
and shown to their rooms, each with its own bathroom. By the time the last
guest returned to the party, Faye had been removed from the fire, and the cage,
and was now laid out on the huge table. 

&nbsp;

�Ladies and gentlemen� called Martin.
�Dinner is served�
