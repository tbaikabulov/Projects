Synopsis: Can the love between a pretty patient and her aneastheologist be real?






She was scared as they wheeled her into the operating room. �Hi Misty� said the cheery voice of a young doctor. �I&#8217;m the one who&#8217;s going to make sure you have wonderful dreams�. Misty smiled weakly as she was helped onto the operating table. She lay down, feeling exposed beneath his gaze in the thin white gown. He moved round to the side of her and she felt a sudden sting as he inserted an IV into the back of her hand. Tears started welling in her eyes and she blinked them away quickly. �This medication might sting a little ok, but it wont be for long� he said as he took a small syringe and injected into the IV port at her wrist. Her heart beat faster and she squeezed her eyes closed as she felt a burn in her hand. He noticed her anxious expression and put his hand on her shoulder. �It will be ok. Be over before you know it�. He shouldn&#8217;t have said that because it unleashed a flood of tears that spilled over and ran down her cheeks. ��I see I&#8217;m going to have to give you some of my special mix�. He reached over and took a small syringe off the counter and quickly injected the contents. Now the �Milk of amnesia� as they call it. The large syringe was in his hand and slowly he injected&nbsp; the milky liquid into her IV, then placing a&nbsp; black mask over her nose and mouth, he instructed her to take five deep breaths. He smiled down at her again as her eyes grew heavy and she drifted off to sleep.

She felt the tube slide down her throat but could not react, she vaguely heard the voice of the doctor saying that she should relax and breathe normally. Again a small burn in her hand and she remembered nothing more.

She awoke in a sea of pain and tears coursed down her cheeks. She tried to call out but the&nbsp; tube was still in her throat. �I see we&#8217;re awake, good�. She looked up and saw his smiling face. �Do you have pain�? She nodded. He plugged his stethoscope into his ears and listened to her chest for a minute. �You know you gave me quiet a scare in there. I thought we were going to loose you�. She frowned. �You stopped breathing,&nbsp; that&#8217;s why you still have the tube in you throat. Would you like it out�? She nodded again and he called to a nearby nurse who bustled over cheerfully. Slowly and gently she took the tape off and the doctor instructed Misty to take a deep breath and breath out slowly. As she breathed out, he slid the tube out produce a coughing fit in his patient. �5 cc&#8217;s valium please nurse and 10 cc&#8217;s morphine. The nurse hurried off to get the medication and returned with two syringes that he injected into her IV. �Thank you nurse�. The woman hurried off. Misty felt drowsy as the medication started working. �That should make you sleep for awhile� he said in a gentle voice. �I&#8217;ll check on you later�. His lips brushed against hers and he squeezed her hand. She smiled weakly and drifted into a deep sleep. 

She awoke to find herself in a small room with two beds. The other was unoccupied. He walked in and smiled. �Good you&#8217;re awake. The surgery went well but I&#8217;m a little worried as to why you stopped breathing. I moved you here so I can keep an eye on you. A nurse will stop by in a while to draw some blood and do a blood gas ok�. He put on a white lab coat over his green scrubs and placed his stethoscope round his neck. �I&#8217;ll be back to check on you after rounds�. He kissed her lightly on the lips and left. A nurse bustled in a while later to draw the bloods and then left Misty alone with her thoughts about how lucky she was to have him as a friend, but she wanted more. She wanted him to notice her inviting pussy and taste her juice. She wanted to feel his fingers inside her as he probed her warm interior. To feel him slide his manhood inside her. She smiled and drifted into a deep sleep.

�Start CPR�! She heard a voice yell. She felt hands on her chest, a mask on her face as oxygen was forced into her lungs. �Come on come on Misty, you cant leave me now�. She felt heavy and limp. She willed her body to respond but nothing reacted to her commands. She felt the tube slide down her throat and she gagged a little. �Ok ok Misty just relax. Give her 5 cc&#8217;s eppi IV STAT�. A light was shone into her eyes and electrodes were placed on her chest. �We have breathing doctor� said a female voice.&nbsp; �Turn the oxygen to high and call me when she wakes, I&#8216;ll be in Ob-Gyn�.


The walk down to neonatal ICU was the longest in his life as he tried to think what could have gone wrong. He stopped at an incubator in the centre on the room with a tiny form in it under soft lighting. He poked his hands through the portholes and touched the tiny figure. The baby recoiled. Good he thought and smiled. �Its okay little one, we&#8217;ll take good care of your mommy�. He checked the baby&#8217;s vitals&#8217; to see if they had improved and was please to see that they had. He left instructions with the sister and walked back to the staff lounge. He needed coffee. He poured himself a mug and sat down on the couch and closed his eyes., drifting off. He awoke with a start as his pager beeped and his face formed into a smile. He rushed to Misty&#8217;s room, his heart pounding in his chest. 

A sister had removed her breathing tube and she looked up at him, smiling weakly. A nurse handed him a file and he opened it, frowning slightly. He adjusted here drip flow and sat down on the bed, taking her hand in his. Her heart fluttered at the feel of his touch. �You know you gave me a scare for a while, but everything is going to be fine. The baby is doing well, but you need to rest�. He took her blood pressure, noting that it was a little high and placed a nasal canella in her nostrils for oxygen. He injected a sedative into her Iv line, smiling down at her as she yawned. He sat holding her hand until she fell asleep and then tiptoed out of the room.

It had been a week ago that Misty, into her seventh month of pregnancy, had started showing signs of toxic shock. Her doctor had admitted her as a precautionary measure due to her low blood pressure. Three days ago her placenta had started to tear away from the uterus wall and she was scheduled for a C-section the following day, because to top it all off, the baby had been in a frank position, a breech birth. An ultra sound&nbsp; 
confirm the worst and she was taken to theatre. And then she&#8217;d heard the only voice she dreaded��.. His.&nbsp; It couldn&#8217;t be, but it was. He stood there, hansom as ever in his scrubs and her mind went back to that one night. She shut her eyes. No�.It could never be, he was married and she was going to be a single mother. She felt the sting of the IV and her eyelids grew heavy with the drugs. She tried to focus but her vision started swimming and she drifted off to sleep.

She couldn&#8217;t remember much of the past two days but she did remember his voice, gentle and caring. They day was bright and sunny outside and she yearned to be out amongst her flowers and animals. Her mind wondered back to her baby and she wondered when they would allow her to she her. She could hardly believe it, she was a mother and ���..The door opening interrupted her thought. �Glad to see you&#8217;re feeling better Miss�, said the nurse as she wheeled in a wheelchair. �Dr Tainton said you may go up and see your baby�.
Upstairs, she was taken to a small incubator in the corner. The tiny figure inside bought tears to her eyes and she look at the nurse who smiled. �Put your hands through there Miss�, she gesture towards the two portholes in the side. Misty felt tears sting her eyes as she gentle touched the little form in the incubator. The baby turned its head and she imagined her baby gazing into her eyes. Thin tubes snaked into her body and disappeared beneath white bandages.&nbsp; �My Mel�, she whispered and she could swear she saw the baby smile.
Back in her room she let her emotions overwhelm her and let the tears flow freely down her cheeks as gazed out at the big Magnolia tree outside the window. How could she tell him that Melanie was his? It would destroy his marriage? She made up her mind not to tell anyone who the father was. A knock on the door startled her out of her daydreams and she turned to see him standing there.&nbsp; �Glad to see you&#8217;re up and about. Have you seen your baby yet�? She nodded and smiled shyly. �Thank you�. He strode into the room and she felt her cheeks flush. �I did nothing. Except maybe love you�. He took her hand and she felt a warm wetness growing between her thighs. �You know we cant� she replied trying to excavate her hand from his. �Your wife�..�, she let her voice trail off as he was shaking his head. �We haven&#8217;t been together for ages. I signed the papers last week�. Her heart leaped but she controlled her emotions as he gently bought her hand to his mouth and she felt his lips softly plant a kiss on her palm. She felt tears well in her eyes and spill over to run down her cheeks, breaking the dam inside her. Her tears startled him and he grew concerned. �What is it?&nbsp; Has something happened�? She shook her head slowly&nbsp; and then nodded. �Oh Adam, nothing is wrong, but yes, something has happened and has been happening since the first day in High school that we met.&nbsp; I was in love with you then and I am in love with you now.� A slow smile spread across his face and he gently picked her up and lay her on the bed. She was aware of the slight bulge of his stiffening erection as he turned and locked the door. He got onto the bed next to her, careful of her IV, and she felt her heart give a little flutter as he drew her into his warm embrace, his mouth descending onto hers,&nbsp; his lips parting,&nbsp; his tongue probing hers. She moaned softly as his fingers found her throbbing cunt but she knew that she could not feel him inside of her, was too soon after surgery. He kissed her waiting lips and cupped each soft breast in his hand �Oh Misty I have waited so long to taste you�. She gave&nbsp; a sort of little chortle and he carried on feeling her wetness. �I want to make you mine�. he said as her hand tightened around his arm, gripping harder and harder. �Misty you&#8217;re���..�, he voice trailed off as his eyes flew to her face and he notice her frightened expression. He made a lunge for the door and ripped it almost off&nbsp; its hinges �Code Blue� ,he yelled to a passing nurse and get me a cardiac consult STAT�. He turned back to the bed and the pale, scared face. Misty was not going to die now, he swore.











END OF PART TWO

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Within twenty minute Misty was again laying on the cold, hard operating table, He had not been allowed to scrub in this time as the cardiac team had a resident aneastheologist. She lay naked under the harsh lights as a circulating nurse quickly draped her body in green towels. She was quickly anesthetized and the surgeon made his incision under her right breast while another nurse taped it out of the way. Her heart was exposed a pool of blood welled into the wound. The hiss of the suction and the tarn was reduced to a trickle.&nbsp; The pericardium was stitched back and the doctor began the task of repairing the heart and locating the hole. 

Misty had no idea what was happening only that she felt a stabbing pain in her chest and couldn&#8217;t breathe. Oh no please��not now��She pleaded to whoever would listen. He loves me and I have to tell him. She heard lots of activity around her and knew that something was wrong. Adam! Adam doesn&#8217;t leave me? I&#8217;m frightened? No answer and she willed her mind to concentrate. She felt lots of hands, strange hands on her and wanted to scream but no sound escaped. She saw her body on the operating table again. The bright lights reflecting off the steel instruments. �Scalpel!� Suddenly she was drawn back into her body by an unseen hand. Her body felt cold now as she lay there with her heart exposed.

Adam paced the floor outside the closed theatre doors and willed her to live. He had to be sure. He needed to know. The minutes dragged into hours and he went into the doctor&#8217;s lounge to get some coffee. He sat down and closed his eyes. Dr Tainton, Dr Tainton. A nurse was shaking him gently. He came to his feet and looked at his watch. He had been asleep for two hours. �Dr Hostetler would like to see you�. The nurse bustled out and he walked into the bathroom, splashed water on his face and made his way the recovery area. He looked around, he didn&#8217;t see Misty. Oh dear god no! No!. No! A voice behind him startled him and he realized he had tears in his eyes. Hastily he wiped them away and turned to see Dr Hostetler&#8217;s smiling face. �It&#8217;s ok. She&#8217;s a lucky one. We&#8217;ve moved her to SICU to keep an eye on her but she&#8217;ll be fine�. Relief washed over him like a cool wind and he took the stairs three at a time up the surgical intensive care wing, the tears finally flowing freely down his cheeks. Now he knew. He needed her and she needed him and the baby���.HIS baby. They had the rest of their lives together�


 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;THE END
