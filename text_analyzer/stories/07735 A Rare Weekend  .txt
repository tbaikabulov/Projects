Synopsis: 









CHAPTER 1. HIS STORY

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was putting the breakfast dishes away when she walked into the kitchen. I still thank God for her every time I see her, even though we have been married for two years now. I am a realist enough to know that the honeymoon feeling should have ended after six months and I am amazed at each day that passes without that first major fight. Don&#8217;t get me wrong, there are times I wonder why a sane man would move into a house with a woman and her two daughters, the estrogen level can certainly be unnerving at times. And there is the rare occasion that I feel she is testing me, to see just how far out of my comfort zone I am willing to go to make her happy. That morning turned out to be one of those rare moments. �The girls are going to be with their father next weekend. I would like to attend the Opera in Kansas City and spend the rest of the weekend shopping, is that all right with you?� I stared into her big brown eyes searching for some hint of reasoning for a question like that. This had to be a test; she knows I would rather have a root canal or colonectomy than go to the opera and shopping. We stared at each other for what seemed to be an eternity when, thankfully, her youngest daughter interrupted and asked for help. There are dozens of things we both enjoy that we could spend a free weekend doing, why would she choose something she knows is way out of my comfort zone? I was hoping she would change her mind by the time we got home from work that evening.
After dinner was over and the girls were doing homework she brought it up again. I had already given this some thought and decided that truth is always the best policy. �The answer to your question is no, I don&#8217;t want to go to the opera or shopping. However, if it is truly important to you, I will. I just feel like there are many other things we could do that both of us would enjoy� Once again she caught me by surprise. �Lets make a bet; our two favorite teams are playing tomorrow evening. If my team wins we will go to Kansas City to see the opera and shopping. If your team wins we will go anywhere you want to go and do anything you want to do� Evidently she had given







this some thought too. Red flags and alarms went off in my head; I was thinking that this can not end well. I sensed our first real fight heading our way. And then out of no where I got a divine inspiration. If I could think of something that was way out of her comfort zone and contrary to her very character, then I could neutralize this situation. �Anything I want to do?� I asked in my most sinister voice. She got quiet �well anything that is not illegal or immoral�. Thinking fast I said �if my team wins I will rent us an out of the way cabin and you will spend the entire weekend naked and tied up as my love toy�. Her big brown eyes got the size of quarters and she spat out �not even in your wildest dreams will THAT ever happen� then she walked out of the room. Score, I win! A Mexican stand off. 

CHAPTER 2. HER STORY

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He was cleaning up the kitchen from breakfast as I walked in. How I was so blessed to find a man who treated my two daughters and I like royalty remains a miracle to me even after two years of marriage. His patience is amazing; although at times I can tell it is all he can do to deal with a house full of women. I can&#8217;t explain why, but on occasion I have a need to find his limits. I blame it on being a red head; I believe being a red head gives me the right to push just a little once in a while. And that was one of those days; I just wanted to see what kind of reaction I would get if I asked him to go to the opera and shopping on a rare weekend that the girls would be with their father. I truly enjoyed going to the opera and shopping, but I think seeing his reaction was what drove me to ask him. When I told him my plan he just stood there looking at me with those intense blue eyes, searching into mine to see if I was serious. There was no emotion on his face, no anger, no sadness, possibly there was curiosity. Then before he could react my daughter interrupted us.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought about it while at work that day and came up with a better approach. He loves a challenge, and our two favorite teams are playing tomorrow evening. If my team wins we will go to the opera and shopping. If









his team wins, we will go where he wants. He had talked about taking a road trip to look at the changing colors of the trees and staying at a bed and breakfast the next chance we got. Either way I couldn&#8217;t loose. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I knew I caught him off guard when I suggested the bet to him. He wasn&#8217;t expecting that approach! However, when he asked if I would go anywhere and do ANYTHING he wanted I got nervous. His look and tone suggested he was thinking of more than a road trip to look at the leaves. Then he stated that if his team won I would spend the weekend naked and tied up as his �love toy�. For him to even think that I would be his �love toy� made me angry! He thinks he won, but I don&#8217;t give up that easily.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We went to bed that night and he cuddled up next to me like always, I knew in his mind this was over and he had won. I spent the night in restless sleep turning it over in my mind. Was it so bad that I wanted to stretch his boundaries? It would be good for him to step out of his comfort zone, right? I just couldn&#8217;t believe he would even consider that I would be his �love toy� for a weekend. Where did that come from?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought about it a work the entire next day. Maybe it was pride, or maybe it was the fact he challenged me, maybe it was my competitive spirit, but I just couldn&#8217;t let him win that easy. Besides, I knew my team would win tonight! I went home and with an attitude told him I accepted the bet!

CHAPTER 3. HIS STORY

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had gone to bed that night happy with myself. I had mastered that situation well. I wrapped myself around her tight little body and slept in total peace. The next evening she came home from work with fire in her brown eyes. She announced that she accepted the bet and could not wait to see her team win this evening. What had I got myself into? During the game I was cheering for my team with all I had, but secretly I hoped her team would win. I couldn&#8217;t possibly back down now after my show of bravado, but what would I do if my team won?









&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And wouldn&#8217;t you know it, my team won at the last minute by a field goal. If they had lost I wouldn&#8217;t have to deal with this mess I created. And although I put on a jubilant victory dance for a show, on the inside I didn&#8217;t know what I was going to do. She took the defeat better than I would have, though. I have to giver her that, she is a real lady. �Congratulations! Make the arrangements and I will be your �love toy� next weekend� was all she said. What was I going to do now?

CHAPTER 4. HER STORY

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; We watched the game together and each of us was cheering for our team with more vigor than usual. My team was winning right up until the last minute when his team made a touch down and tied the score. As they set up for a field goal, I was praying to God with every ounce of strength I had that it would miss. I saw it go through the goal posts and my heart just sank. I was in denial for a few moments, it just could not be! What had I done, how did I get myself into this mess. I never realized how stupid he looked when he did his victory dance until then. I choked down my disappointment and as calmly as possible I told him I would be his �love toy� the next weekend. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All week we ignored the subject of the up coming weekend and I was becoming more nervous as the days went by. I hardly slept all week and by Thursday my nerves were really on edge. I asked him when we were leaving, what clothes I should wear, and what I needed to pack. He told me to wear something really nice Friday evening, because we were going to eat at a 5 star restaurant. I hoped he had changed his mind and we would have a quiet romantic weekend, but then he told me all I needed to pack was a tooth brush, my make-up, a blow dryer, a razor, and perfume. He said he wanted to leave as soon as the girl&#8217;s father picked them up Friday afternoon.

CHAPTER 5. HIS STORY

&nbsp; I was really worried because there was so much to plan and so little time. I








called a 5 star resort located on the lake and asked if they had any log cabins available for the following weekend. I was in luck; it seems I called during their slow season. I asked for a well appointed cabin that was as isolated as possible, had a good view of the lake and of the surrounding hills. I was hoping it would be beautiful with the trees changing colors at their peak time of year. I also made reservations at the restaurant for Friday evening. I went shopping after work the next day at an adult toy store that had a catchy little jingle I had heard on the radio. I was concerned it would be in a seedy part of town, but was pleasantly surprised to find it located in a nice strip mall surrounded by a dry cleaner, an appliance store, a hair salon, and other normal business. I went inside not knowing for sure what I was looking for. My thought was to find some toys that would make the weekend different, but nothing that would scare her or hurt her. After browsing for awhile I settled on a few items that intrigued me and left happy. My plan was to be prepared if she actually went through with our bet, and be willing to let it drop if it became too much for her. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was Thursday before we mentioned the weekend again and she asked me when we were leaving, what she should wear, and what she should pack. I explained that I would like to leave Friday afternoon as soon as the girls were picked up by their father. I told her to dress nice because I wanted to take her dining at a 5 star restaurant. What should she should pack? I hadn&#8217;t given it any thought until now. �Well, you will need your tooth brush, make-up, a blow dryer, a razor�oh, and perfume would be nice�. I was hoping she would swallow her pride ask if we could forget about the bet, but she just nodded yes and walked away.

CHAPTER 6. HER STORY

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Friday went by so very slowly. Finally it came time for the kids to get ready to go with their father and I spent a long time getting ready for our weekend. My shower lasted much longer than usual, and then I spent forever









picking out a dress in which I would feel comfortable going to a 5 star
restaurant. My husband had already packed the car and was dressed very GQ for the occasion. As I kissed the girls goodbye and watched them get into their fathers car, I noticed that my nerves were bow string tight. My husband went through the house checking to make sure it was ready to leave, and then opened the car door for me, and we left. The drive was beautiful as the road curved through the Ozark hills. The brilliant colored leaves and the deep blue lake with the sun sparkling off of it was an incredible sight. He spent the entire drive trying extra hard to be funny and put me at ease, and I did my best to relax. Entering the gates to the resort was breath taking. Massive rustic buildings and spectacular landscaping with waterfalls and fall foliage made for a Norman Rockwell painting. We found the restaurant and attendants opened my door, while the valet took the car, and then others opened the doors leading inside. The hostess asked my husband his name and led us directly to a table beside a huge window overlooking the lake and the Ozark hills. An oversized stone fireplace cast warmth and a flickering light on the wall next to our table. The service we experienced was second to none and the food was outstanding. By the end of the meal I was starting to relax for the first time in a week. When the waitress arrived with our bill she handed my husband a card and told him it was the pass key for our cabin. She also assured him our luggage had already been placed in the cabin as he had requested. He thanked her, signed the bill, and we left. All of a sudden the tension in the pit of my stomach returned. Our car was waiting for us as we exited the restaurant and we drove slowly through the resort. It was now dark and I wondered what it would look like in the daylight. �It is a shame you are going to be tied up all weekend, it would have been nice to explore the resort� he said. I couldn&#8217;t tell if he was trying to be funny or was serious, so I just smiled. We drove down a small winding lane with cabins built on the side of the rock bluffs and then up towards the top of the highest point around. He stopped in front of a cabin that sat alone in the woods overlooking a great expanse of the lake. After parking the car he came









around to my side and opened the door. I took a deep breath, got out and walked toward the cabin. He used the card to open the door, stepped back, and I entered into a room that could have been taken from a page of Home and Gardens magazine. I would describe it as rustic chic. The ceilings went all the way to the peak of the roof and great beams spanned the entire width of the room. There were dormer windows in the roof that would let light in during the day and polished brass and copper lights that hung on chains from the ceiling. The huge room used the furniture and plush carpet to divide the living area from the dining area and the small kitchen. The living area had two overstuffed leather sofas, two matching chairs, a coffee table made of heavy wood that was six foot long and end tables to match. There was a stone fireplace that covered the entire wall that the living room furniture faced. The mantel was just as impressive in size as the fireplace and was mounted to the stone with ornamental iron brackets. The dining room had a heavy double trestle table with six high back matching chairs sitting on the hardwood floor, and the kitchen was separated by a breakfast counter for four people. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I heard the door close and felt him standing behind me. My stomach felt as though all my intestines had turned to mush. I took a deep breath and without turning to face him I said �I would like to freshen up before we begin�. �Sure, there should be a robe in the bathroom, I would like you to put your clothes away, remove all your jewelry, and I will be here waiting for you when your are ready to start. No hurries, no worries� he said so very chipper. Maybe he had no worries, but I had a lot!

CHAPTER 7. HIS STORY

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Friday went by in a blur. I had a couple hours of work to finish before we could leave, and I had decided I should bring along some rope. I went to the Home Depot store never dreaming there would be such a wide selection of










rope. There are dozens of materials and sizes to choose from. I was careful not to buy something rough that may cause rope burn. Finally I decided
upon sash rope which is used to hold draperies back. It was soft as silk and pure white. Once I was back at home I packed the car and was surprised to find it was already time to shower and dress for our trip. I decided to use our guest bath so she could have all the time and space she needed to get ready for the weekend. When she came out to tell the girls goodbye, she was beautiful. The dress she chose complimented her red hair and showed off her toned figure. She has great legs and the high heels she was wearing accentuated them nicely. 
&nbsp; By the time we left the city I started to feel more at ease and did my best to make light conversation so she would relax also. The drive was breathtaking with the leaves changing colors and when we arrived at the gates to the resort I was in amazement. Giant stone and oak buildings covered the grounds, and my undying admiration went to the crew who landscaped the place. We were met at the restaurant by attendants and valet parking, and then another gentleman opened the door to let us enter. The hostess seated us at a table next to a window overlooking the lake as I had requested when making the reservations and the warmth of the nearby fireplace was welcome. The food and the service were outstanding. My wife started to relax by the end of the meal and when we finished the waitress brought us the key card to our cabin along with the meal ticket. As I was signing the ticket the waitress assured me our luggage had been placed in the cabin. My wife and I walked hand in hand to the car and drove a winding lane to the cabin. It was everything they had promised, secluded and with a fantastic view of the lake. I opened the car door for my wife and she led the way to the cabin. I used the card to open the door and once inside just stood in awe for a few minutes. Everything about this resort was massive in size and this cabin was no exception. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was still taking in the cabin when she asked if she could freshen up before we began. I returned to reality and remembered why we were here. I








explained that I would like for her to put on the robe furnished in the bathroom after she had removed her clothing and jewelry, and then return when she was ready. I tried to be as light hearted as possible, but she just walked toward the bedroom. I spotted our luggage by the dining room table and opened the small one. I had brought with me four vanilla candles because they are her favorite scent. I lit them and placing them on the end tables. Using the instructions they had e-mailed me earlier, I figured out how light the gas fireplace, and then I turned out the lights. I again looked in the luggage and removed the wrist cuffs I had purchased for this weekend. I knew I did not want to use rope to tie her with, because I was afraid it may cut off the circulation in her hands or leave marks. Who knew there would have been so many choices when a person wanted to buy wrist cuffs? Red ones, black ones, white ones, 2� wide, 4� wide, locking, non locking, soft, stiff, leather, vinyl and steel handcuffs. I had finally settled on soft leather, fur lined, two inch wide, locking, red cuffs. I had also purchased matching ankle cuffs and a collar. Another intriguing toy that I purchased looked like a small gold necklace with a rubber noose at each end. The package showed a woman with a small noose around each nipple and the chain hanging between them, it also promised that it could be worn comfortably for hours while keeping the nipples erect. I just had to try it and see. I placed the wrist cuffs, the collar, and the nipple chain on an end table beside an overstuffed chair facing the fireplace, and then I opened the drapes to a picture window overlooking the lake. The moon was so full and bright it almost appeared to be daylight and it shimmered on the lake giving the hills a romantic shadow. I stepped out onto the deck and looked back through the window. Because the moon was so bright and the room inside was dark, no one could see inside. I stepped back inside and decided to leave the drapes open. I sat down in the chair and waited to see if my wife was actually going to go through with our bet.

CHAPTER 8. HER STORY

&nbsp; I walked into the bedroom and it was just as grand as everything else we






had encountered at this resort. The bed was a large four poster that had decorative iron at the top connecting all four oak posts. Large armoires were used as closets, a matching dresser and two arm chairs that would have dominated any other room seem to fit perfectly. Like the living area, the carpet was plush and luxurious. I stepped into the bathroom and was surprised to find a jacuzzi, a shower, a double sink, and a toilet in its own little room.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I sat down on a small chair beside the tub and willed myself to calm down. Finally I got the strength to remove my clothes and jewelry. I slipped on the robe and stepped into the bedroom to hang my dress in the armoire. I placed my shoes in there also, and then put everything else in a dresser drawer. I walked to the door, took a deep breath and went into the living room.
The room was dark with the only light coming from the fireplace and a few candles. The smell of vanilla filled the room, it was my favorite and I wondered if it was a coincidence. He was sitting in an arm chair facing the fireplace, and not knowing what to do; I walked over and stood in front of him. He stood up, smiled and slowly pulled on the belt holding my robe closed. I felt it open, and then he slowly lifted it off my shoulders and let it fall to the floor around my feet. I instinctively placed one hand in front of my sex and the other arm over my breasts. Even with the warmth of the fireplace on my back a chill ran through me. I heard him speaking, but I couldn&#8217;t concentrate on what he was saying. �Did not want to use rope�� Why was I doing this?.... �Did not want to leave marks��. I knew him well enough to know that I could stop at any time�.. �Bought cuffs to secure your hands��. I knew that he would never bring this up again if I chose to stop�.. �Fur lined so they won&#8217;t leave any marks��. He probably would even apologize to me�. �Soft red leather to accent your hair��. Why was I standing here naked in front of him? He stopped talking and I realized I had closed my eyes. I forced them open and saw that he had a cuff in his hand and was waiting for me to put my wrist in it. I saw my hand leave the front of my sex and my wrist lay itself in the cuff. I watched as he buckled it and heard a small click as it locked. I moved my hand back and felt the butter soft leather against my stomach. He picked up the other cuff and for some









reason I held out my other wrist. After buckling the cuff on it, he gently took my shoulders and turned me to face the fire. His fingers slowly and lightly traced a path down my arms until his hands were on the cuffs and he whispered in my ear that he wanted to connect the cuffs behind my back. I resisted his gentle pull on my wrists and in that very second I knew why I was doing this. Somewhere deep inside me I wanted to know what it would be like to give myself completely to him. To be naked and helpless. To let him use my body any way he wanted. I let him pull my hands back and I held them there until I heard the lock click. One of his hands rested on my shoulder; the other moved my hair back from my neck. He whispered in my ear how much he loved me, how beautiful I was, assured me he would never hurt me, and encouraged me to relax. My mind had stopped functioning, I was on autopilot. He nibbled on my earlobe and kissed slowly down my neck while his fingertips started a slow trail across my collar bone. I leaned back into him, let my head fall against his chest and closed my eyes. I could feel the heat from the fireplace on my legs, tummy and breasts. His fingers continued to explore, circling my breasts but never touching them, down my belly, around my belly button, almost touching my sex, and then slowly back up to do it again. I realized that we had not made love all week. The tension, the fear, the building need within me, emotions and feelings that I had never experienced before soon brought me to a boiling point. He placed a finger on each nipple and waited for what seemed like an eternity. At last he lightly flicked my nipples and fireworks went through my body. I spun around and rose on my tiptoes searching for his mouth. One of his hands went to the small of my back pulling me close and his other hand tangled in my hair. I pulled frantically on the cuffs so that I could put my arms around him to no avail. His dress shirt felt like sandpaper on my nipples. As we kissed passionately&nbsp; his leg pressed between mine and I went over the edge. Wave after wave crashed over me. After the fireworks subsided I broke the kiss and lowered my heels to the floor. Resting my head against his chest, I listened to his heart pound while waiting for my own breathing to return to normal. He held me tight the whole time.






&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I needed to cool off, so I regained my balance and took a step back. He smiled and said �I have a lot more toys I would like to try out on you�. He picked up what appeared to be a dog collar, only it had more than one place to attach a leash. It was also red and had fur lining like the wrist cuffs holding my hands behind my back. He brushed the hair that had fallen into my face aside and worked the collar around my throat. I stood still and let him buckle it while dealing with the fact that I really was his pet for the weekend. He sweetly asked �Is it too tight?� I couldn&#8217;t speak yet so I just nodded no. I watched as he picked up a small gold necklace and I realized it was not going around my neck as he attached a noose that was on one end around a swollen nipple. I was afraid it would hurt as I watched him tighten it, but was relieved to find that it didn&#8217;t. Oh, I definitely knew it was there, but it wasn&#8217;t painful. He attached the other noose and let the chain fall between my breasts. It wasn&#8217;t heavy at all, but I could feel it swinging back and forth. �Are you thirsty?� he asked. I nodded yes and he hooked the chain with his finger and said �follow me�. I am not certain if it was pride or anger that surfaced as I thought to myself �I am not a dog to be led around�. He put gentle pressure on the chain and waited. A few seconds later I found myself following him to the kitchen. He poured a drink from the refrigerator, found a straw, and put it to my lips. I drank all I wanted and then he finished drinking the rest.&nbsp; I rolled my shoulders; they were beginning to ache from having my arms behind my back for so long. He asked �Need a change in positions? I can tie you in a different way any time it starts to hurt� I realized he was serious about keeping me tied up all weekend and I was not sure I could handle it. He took a key from his pocket, stepped behind me, and separated the cuffs. I rolled my shoulders again and stretched trying to make the ache go away. He waited patiently and when I had finished he pulled my wrists together in front of me and locked them together again. Then he raised my wrists up and behind my head. He held them there while he circled behind me and then he attached the wrist cuffs to the back of the collar. I can&#8217;t explain why, but I felt even more exposed than before. He stepped in front of me and once more hooked his finger in the nipple chain. While gently pulling, he said �I want to show you something�. I









followed as he slowly backed into the living area again. He was moving toward the window. I had been too distracted before to notice the drapes were open and panic was starting to rise again. He was calmly assuring me,&nbsp; �I have checked, no one can see in, it will be alright, trust me�. When his back was near the window he circled behind me and held me in his arms again. �Look at the moon, isn&#8217;t it beautiful? The lake is so smooth it looks like glass doesn&#8217;t it?&nbsp; Look, I see a house boat way out there. Do you see it? It looks so small gliding across the water� Once again his fingers were exploring my skin, only this time his left hand came to rest on my sex, and his right hand covered my left breast. My nipples were becoming very sensitive from the chain and when I breathed my right nipple would rub his arm. It was too soon, I needed more time before being teased again, but my body began to tell me otherwise. I leaned back into him again and let my mind go numb once more. I looked out the window as his hands kept gently squeezing my sex and breasts at random intervals. The moon was sparkling off the water and it appeared like a million diamonds. The distant lake front homes had turned on their lights and they looked like fireflies. His fingers were working their magic. �Spread your pretty legs� he softly asked. It took all my strength to put my weight on one leg, move it, and then do the same with the other. He cupped my sex and slipped a finger inside, but never moved it. He just kept gently squeezing and talking. I felt the climax building to a peak once again. His finger inside me touched the area behind my clit, rested there for what seemed an eternity, and then he stroked it. My body exploded for the second time that evening. Again he held me tight until I quit shuddering and was able to stand on my own. He unlocked the cuffs from the collar leaving my wrists connected to each other and I lowered my hands in front of me. He took my hands and I followed him to the bedroom and watched as he turned down the covers on the bed. I sat on the edge and then awkwardly lay down using my cuffed hands. My nipples were really sensitive and I grimaced slightly as he removed the nipple chain. He covered me up, kissed me on the forehead, and I slept for the next twelve hours straight.







CHAPTER 9. HIS STORY

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She came out of the bedroom wearing only the bathrobe and stood in front of me. I knew then that she really was going to go through with the bet. I stood up and took hold of the belt that was keeping the robe closed. I slowly pulled on it letting the robe open. As it fell to the floor I saw her shiver. She still takes my breath away with her beauty. We had not had sex for a week, and my need for her was demanding that I lay her on the floor and have her now. However, I had planned this weekend carefully and my mission was to see how many times I could pleasure her to climax. I started explaining to her about the cuffs, but I could see her eyes glazing over and suspected her mind was elsewhere. I picked up a cuff and waited patiently for her to let me put it on her wrist, but she had closed her eyes and covered herself with her hands. A few seconds later she opened her eyes and looked at the cuff. Ever so slowly she raised the hand that had been covering her sex and placed it in the cuff. After I locked it on her wrist she offered me her other hand. I locked the second cuff on and then I gently turned her around. While reaching for her wrists I explained, �I would like to lock your hands behind your back�. She resisted and I could see that there was a war going on inside her head. It appeared we had gone as far as she was would go. I was ready to stop, but she surprised me and put her hands behind her back. She held them there while I locked the cuffs together, and then I started to tease her slowly, watching and listening for signs that my plan was succeeding. When she relaxed and leaned back into me I knew that she was mine for the weekend. It took some time but she started responding to the attention I was lavishing on her. The last thing I anticipated was for her to spin around in my arms. She rose on her tiptoes and her lips came searching for mine. I could feel her passion building and a few minutes later she shuddered as her body found its release. She laid her head on my chest and I held her close until she regained her strength. After long minutes went by she stepped back and looked at me. I didn&#8217;t want to give her time to think before I moved on to the next part of my plan. I reached for the collar and carefully put it around her neck, 







making sure I did not pull any of that pretty red hair. Next I picked up the nipple chain. To prepare for this moment I had experimented at home by attaching the nipple chain to the eraser of a pencil. I tightened the noose around one of her nipples while watching her face carefully for signs of pain and then repeated the process with the other one. I asked if she was thirsty and she nodded yes. I hooked a finger in the nipple chain and started to back towards the kitchen. I saw a look of defiance come across her face so I stopped to see what would happen. I stood there with a slight amount of tension pulling on her nipples and waited. Once more the war raged inside her head and once more I wondered if we had come as far as she would go. At last her expression changed and she followed me to the kitchen. I looked inside the refrigerator and found a selection of juices; this resort is one classy place. I found drinking glasses, filled one, and located a straw. She drank without hesitation and when I was sure she was satisfied I finished the rest. I noticed that she rolled her shoulders and I suspected they were aching from being restrained so long. I took the key to the cuffs and unlocked them from each other. I waited until she had stretched and then reattached the cuffs in front of her. I then raised her hands up, stepped behind her, and pulled her wrists close to her head. Without resistance she let me lock the cuffs to the collar. My need for her was raging; I had never wanted her so much. I took a deep breath and regained control of myself. Once again I hooked a finger around the nipple chain and started backing toward the living area. She followed compliantly until she looked past me at the window and realized the drapes were open. I kept slowly moving backward while reassuring her that no one could see her. Once we were in front of the window, I circled behind her and whispered to her while starting a second wave of exploring her body. Eventually my fingers succeeded at satisfying her, and she collapsed in my arms. I was happy my plan was working. When she was able to stand on her own again, I unlocked the cuffs from the collar, but left her wrists connected. She lowered her hands and I led her to the bed. I carefully removed the nipple chain and covered her up. She was asleep before I could kiss her forehead goodnight. I blew out the candles, turned off the fireplace, undressed and held her tight. Tomorrow I would continue playing with my �love toy�.







CHAPTER 10. HER STORY

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What a luxury to sleep without an alarm clock or my girls to wake me. I woke up just enough to realize I was in a strange bed; figured out my hands were still cuffed together, then slipped back into that glorious land of slumber. The next time I woke the sun shining through the windows led me to believe it was late morning. I peeked out from the covers and saw him in a chair facing me from across the room. He appeared to be working on his laptop, so I just lay there enjoying the silk sheets and warm bed. When boredom started to set in I asked �What are you going to do to me today?� He smiled, closed the laptop, and said �You know how your girls like to play video games? Well, after you have taken a long soak in the jacuzzi and have eaten, you get to be my video game� I thought about that for a few seconds and decided not to ask. I should have been worried, but I was now certain he would never hurt me. And the fear I had been dealing with had been replaced by curiosity. Also, I hated to admit it, but the attention I was getting could become addictive. �Would you like me to remove the cuffs so you can start your bath?� he asked.&nbsp; I stretched, and pushed the covers down before sitting up. As he walked toward me I extended my arms toward him, he took the key and removed them. I passed through the bathroom and into the small room where the toilet was located. I heard the water start pouring into the tub and when I came out he was lighting the candles that had been in the living room the night before. I put a foot into the water to test the temperature and slowly got in. He sat in the chair that I had used a few short hours ago while building my courage and we made small talk. When I was ready he took a wash cloth, kneeled beside the tub, and washed me. I dunked my head and then he washed my hair. When I started turning into a prune I stood up and he toweled me off, wrapping the towel around me when he finished. He opened up a drawer of the sink cabinet and picked up four stainless steel balls about an inch in diameter with a rubber cord connecting them and also a tube of personal lubricant. �I would like you to put these









inside you. You need to leave the end of the cord hanging out.� He smiled and then added �I ordered breakfast for us when you are finished� and he left.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I took my time shaving, blow drying my hair, and putting on my make up. I left the task of sliding the balls inside me for last. They were not big enough to be painful, but they weighed enough to let me know they were there.&nbsp; I truly wanted to have clothes on again, but after a lot of thought I walked back into the kitchen naked. He smiled, picked up a cuff, and waited for me to hold out my hand. Hearing that �click� when he locked them on me made my knees weak. After connecting them together in front of me, he patted the bar stool at the counter and said �have a seat and I will get us breakfast�. I gasped when I sat on the leather seat, not only because it was cold after taking a hot bath, but also because the balls inside me shifted. He took out bowls of sliced fruit from the fridge, and bagels from the oven. �What would you like to drink?� and after pouring a glass of juice he asked �what would you like on your bagel?� Being a �love toy� certainly was turning out to be a lot different than I had imagined. I was being pampered like a queen while remaining naked and cuffed. The conflicting emotions kept my mind working overtime.&nbsp; It took a few minutes to get the hang of eating with my wrists cuffed together and drinking was even a bigger challenge. When I was satisfied, he put away the dishes and sat on the stool beside me. He opened a newspaper and spread it out on the counter. We read the entire paper and discussed it while his fingers made figure eights up and down my back. He would stop to turn the page and start trailing his fingers over my back again. The whole time I was wondering what he meant earlier when he said I would get to be his video game today. I don&#8217;t know if it was curiosity, or just wanting to end the anticipation that made me ask �I am to be your video game today?� He smiled once again, took my hands and led me toward the living area. I saw a white silk rope that went up and over one of the beams spanning the ceiling. We stopped beside the rope and he tied one end to the cuffs. I watched as he took the other end of the rope and started to pull it over the beam. As his end of the rope came down, my end started to pull my








hands upward. He stopped when my arms were a few inches above my head and walked toward the fireplace. He tied the rope to one of the iron brackets that mounted the mantel to the stone. He stared at me for a few seconds with a look of pure lust, and then seemed to regain his thoughts. On the coffee table were several objects I had never seen before. He chose a very small electrical cord and started talking to me �Everything is battery powered so there is no chance of getting shocked� Last night I could not concentrate on anything he was saying, but today I was hanging on every word. Every word and a rope! I watched as he connected the wire to a socket, like a charging cord of a cell phone, on the end of the cord I had left hanging out when I had slid the stainless steel balls inside me. He attached the other end of the cord to something that looked like my daughters x-box game. He then picked up a triangle piece of cloth that was an inch thick and had straps attached to each of the three corners. He covered my sex with the triangle cloth and used the straps to hold it around my waist. �Spread your legs please� I did as he asked and he pulled the third strap between them. And then I felt him pulling it snug against my sex as it was connected to the other straps. Another electrical cord was connected from the controller box to the triangle. He held up what appeared to be a small plastic egg with a noose attached to it. He smiled as he explained, �The eggs go on your nipples; however it appears they need some attention before they are hard enough�. I heard someone moaning as he started gently sucking on a nipple and realized it was me. When it was hard he placed the noose over it and then let the egg hang free. It was heavier than it appeared, but not enough to hurt. When he had made the other nipple hard, he attached the second egg. He then attached wires from the controller to each of the eggs. He picked up a blindfold, put his hand on the back of my head, kissed me long and passionately, and then slipped the blindfold over my eyes. I heard him sit down in the chair and fear once again gripped me while I waited to see what would happen next. A barely discernable hum came from the egg on my left nipple causing my body to tense for a few seconds and then the hum quit. I felt it again inside me and squeezed my legs together. Then the intensity got stronger and I









could feel the stainless steel balls vibrating on each other. I couldn&#8217;t help but to lift my right leg off the floor, cross it over my left one and squeeze as hard as I could. The humming eventually stopped and minutes passed before I could relax enough to put my foot on the floor again. The triangle covering my sex started to buzz making me gasp and I found myself holding my breath. I lost track of time, I must have hung there for hours while he played with me. He had complete control of which device he wanted to use, and the intensity as well. I don&#8217;t remember how many times I came close to release only to have him stop, wait for my breathing to return to normal and start again. And those eggs on my nipples, the only time they would stop swinging was when I was able to hold absolutely still. At last I heard myself begging �No more, please, I can&#8217;t take anymore� He removed the blindfold, and gently removed the eggs from my nipples. Reaching behind me, he unfastened the straps holding the triangle to my sex. I spread my legs so he could remove the strap between them and then gasped once again as he slowly pulled one of the balls out of me. He stared into my eyes as he slowly pulled out a second one. He held me close and kissed me passionately as he slowly pulled the third one out. His shirt was rubbing my sore nipples and sending sparks throughout my body. The last ball did the trick as it slid out of me and I went over the edge. He continued to kiss me, hold me, and stroke my back until I stopped shuddering. Then he walked over to the fireplace, untied the rope from the mantel bracket, and slowly let my hands down in front of me. He returned to untie the rope from the cuffs and gently pushed down on my shoulders and said �Sit down on the floor and rest�.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He opened the doors to the entertainment center and turned on the TV. I watched as he put in a DVD and a few seconds later my favorite romantic movie appeared on the set. I heard him ask �Would you like popcorn?� I could only nod yes and he went toward the kitchen. As the opening credits rolled from the movie I heard the sound of popcorn in the microwave. I sat with my legs drawn up, my hands on my knees and my chin resting on the soft cuffs. I remember thinking that the smell of real leather from the cuffs









was so very erotic. As the opening lines of the movie started he handed me a glass of Coke and a big bowl that had steam rising from it. I spread my legs out and placed the popcorn between them feeling the heat on the inside of my bare thighs. He sat behind me and I felt him brushing my hair. I sat naked and cuffed, watched my favorite romance movie, and ate popcorn while he brushed my hair. The feelings going through me were like nothing I had ever experienced before. After the movie he moved the bowl and gently pushed me to the thick carpet as I worked my cuffed hands around his neck. He didn&#8217;t hurt me, but his need was evident as he took me. Again that night I fell asleep as soon as he pulled the covers over me. 

CHAPTER 11. HIS STORY

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I woke up hours before she did, and I decided to let her sleep as long as she wanted. I took my shower then ordered breakfast and a newspaper from room service. I had already planned the day&#8217;s activities, so I went about preparing everything. I threw the rope I had bought over a beam that ran the width of the living area near the fireplace. On the coffee table I set out one of the toys that had most intrigued me. The box had promised that a person could tease their partner for hours using a battery operated game controller. It had all sorts of attachments to fit male and female body parts. Some looked painful to me so I chose a few that I knew wouldn&#8217;t hurt her. One attachment I had picked was made of four stainless steel balls connected by a very small electrical cord the size of a cell phone charger. The instructions said to insert the balls inside her and leave the cord hanging out. After some thought I decided to leave that up to her because I didn&#8217;t want to take a chance of hurting her. I took the balls and a new tube of personal lubricant and placed them in a drawer beside the bathroom sink. I also moved the vanilla candles I had brought with me into the bathroom and set them on the corners of the jacuzzi. As I passed through the bedroom I noticed she was still sleeping soundly. She had pulled the covers up and all I could see was








her cute little nose and a mane of red hair on the pillow. I had some work I could do on the laptop to pass the time, so I sat in one of the big arm chairs facing the bed. A few minutes later I heard a chipper little voice ask �What are you going to do to me today?� I nearly laughed, I had been so afraid that this weekend could have been disastrous for our relationship, but she sounded up for anything. �After a long hot bath and breakfast you get to be my video game for the day�. I watched as her brow furrowed and I could see her processing that information. She never said a word though, so I asked if she was ready for her bath. She pushed the covers down and used her cuffed hands to sit up. Once again I thanked God for such a beautiful wife. She held her hands out to me as I walked toward her. I unlocked the cuffs from each other, and then removed them from her wrists. She made a bee line for the toilet, so I started her bath water and then lit the candles. The bath water was very warm and she took her time lowering herself into it. I turned on the jacuzzi pump and sat on a chair next to the tub. We talked while she just soaked and when she reached for a wash cloth I took it from her, soaped it, and bathed her. She handed me the shampoo and dunked her head, so I poured some into my hands and washed her thick red hair. When she stood up and stepped out of the tub I reached for one of the big fluffy towels and dried her off. After she was dry I wrapped the towel around her, turned away from her while I gathered my courage, and then took out the toys I had placed in the drawer. As nonchalantly as possible I explained what I wanted her to do with them and then I left before she had time to react.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I was really surprised to see her walk out of the bedroom confident and naked. I would have guessed she would have put on the robe or at least left the towel wrapped around her. I held out a cuff and she offered her wrist without hesitation, and after I locked it on, she held out the other hand. Then I locked both cuffs together in front of her again. I patted the bar stool at the counter and invited her to sit while I prepared her breakfast. I was curious if she had put the attachment inside herself as I asked, so I waited for an opportunity to look between her thighs for the cord. As she climbed on the 










bar stool I was pleased to see that she had. From the corner of my eye I
enjoyed watching her eat and drink with her wrists locked together, and when we were finished I spread the newspaper out on the counter. I wanted to make the day last, so I was in no hurry to start the main event. I was hoping that reading the paper together would help her to relax, however I sensed the anticipation of being my �video game� was starting to get to her. When I closed the newspaper she nervously said �Soooo� I am going to be your video game today� I smiled thinking that this was as good as anytime; I reached for her hands and led her into the living area. When she was standing in front of the rope I watched her eyes as they followed it up and over the beam. I tied one end to her cuffs and moved a few steps away with the other end. I pulled slowly on the rope and watched as her hands started to rise. I pulled the rope until her hands were crossed over her head and then tied the rope to a bracket holding the mantel onto the fireplace. I explained to her the game was battery powered and would not shock her.&nbsp; I connected a wire from the stainless steel balls inside her to the control box and then I took a vibrator that is shaped like a triangle with straps at all three corners and walked behind her. I held the triangle to her sex and pulled the straps around her waist keeping it snug against her and buckled it behind her. I asked her to spread her legs and she shuffled her feet apart. I pulled the strap snug between them and buckled the third strap to the other two. It looked like she was wearing a thong only it was an inch thick. I picked up an attachment that looked like a small plastic egg with the same type noose that was on the ends of the nipple chain. However her nipples weren&#8217;t hard enough to attach the noose yet, so I took great delight in sucking them until they were. The vibrator inside the egg had a small amount of weight to it and I was concerned it may be painful, so after slipping the noose over a nipple I watched her carefully as I slowly let the egg hang free. I saw no signs of distress, so I did the same with the other one. Then I finished connecting the











wires between the attachments and the control box. Last but not least, I picked up a blindfold and started to put it over her eyes, however I felt the
need to kiss her first. My master plan of not having sex with her until it was time to leave the resort was at war with my growing desire for her. The control box was capable of doing many different functions with the attachments offered; some I thought went to the extreme. I had experimented with it earlier by just holding the attachments to get an understanding of what they felt like; however I decided to start with the lowest settings and work my way up the scale. I sat in a chair facing her and barely turned the knob controlling the intensity of the vibration to an egg on her nipple and I watched as she tensed her entire body. I turned it off and found the knob that controlled the stainless steel balls inside her. I was amazed to see her squeeze her legs together when I barely turned the knob. I couldn&#8217;t resist so I turned it up a little more and watched as her right foot came off the floor and she crossed her legs. I would have left it on longer but she was holding her breath. I shut that one off and tried the knob to the triangle. She went rigid again as I turned it up slowly. I spent the next few hours watching her as I played with the control box. Anytime I sensed she was close to climax I would turn it off and wait. When she calmed down enough that the eggs attached to her nipples would quit swinging, I would offer her a drink of juice from a glass with a straw, and then start playing with her again. Finally I could see that she was exhausted. She begged me to stop, so I removed the wires from the attachments, the eggs from her nipples, and the triangle from her waist. I decided to remove the stainless steel balls myself. I very slowly pulled the cord down and as one came into view she tensed. I stared into her eyes as I slowly pulled the second one out. I put one hand on the back of her head and kissed her passionately as I pulled the third one out. I waited for a few more seconds and then removed the last one. Her climax from all my teasing hit her hard. I held her with both arms until she rested her head on my chest. When she stood on her own again I untied the rope from the 










fireplace and lowered her arms. I then untied the rope from the cuffs and let
her sit on the carpet.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I had found a DVD of her all time favorite romantic movie on the internet and had it shipped overnight so it would be here for this weekend. Now seemed like a good time to watch it. I put a bag of popcorn in the microwave, and while it was popping I found a large bowl in the cabinet. I returned with the popcorn and a glass of coke and handed them to her. She was very quiet as she ate the popcorn and watched the movie. I brushed her hair during the movie but the war was raging inside of me this time. By the time the movie was over, my desire for her was stronger than my willpower to wait. I tried to be gentle as I took her, but my need was all consuming. After I regained control of my breathing, I stood and then helped her up. I reached for her cuffed hands and led her to the bed, and she was asleep before I could kiss her goodnight.

CHAPTER 12. HER STORY

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was Sunday already! I had thought that it would feel like an eternity before this weekend was over, but now I was strangely sad that it would come to an end today. I pushed the covers back, swung my legs over the side of the bed and raised my cuffed hands high over my head. As I was stretching, the bathroom door opened and he walked out freshly showered. I put on my best �little girl pouty face� and held out my hands to him. He smiled and shook his head, then reached into his pocket for the key to the cuffs. As he was unlocking them he said �You know there will come a day when that look has no effect on me�. I didn&#8217;t say anything, but inside I hoped he was wrong. While using the toilet I came to the realization that we hadn&#8217;t eaten much the day before and I was starving. I needed a shower but hunger pains had my full attention at the moment. I decided to find out if he had already ordered breakfast and I was in the process of opening the










bedroom door when I saw the young room service attendant setting the table. I quickly closed the door and waited for him to leave. The food smelled fabulous as my husband pulled out a chair for me to sit. Once again I gasped as my bare skin touched the wooden chair and I wondered if I could ever get used to that part of being a �love toy�.&nbsp; This was real comfort food, the kind grandma used to make. There was ham, bacon, eggs, toast, and pancakes. A variety of syrups and butter were in cut glass jars with polished silver lids. The jars sat in a matching polished silver serving tray that had an electrical cord plugged into a nearby outlet to keep them warm.&nbsp; To drink there was juice, milk, and a carafe of French Vanilla Cappuccino. I could not remember the last time I ate that much food for breakfast. As I was eating I realized that for the first time that weekend I wasn&#8217;t cuffed. I opened my mouth to ask if he had forgotten, but caught myself just in time, thinking how stupid that would be. After we ate he slid his chair back from the table and sat idly playing with the syrup jars and making small talk. He proudly announced �We have Blue Bunny Chocolate ice cream; it&#8217;s your favorite, want some?� I couldn&#8217;t have eaten another bite if I had to. I noticed that he hadn&#8217;t eaten any pancakes or syrup, and when I asked he said �I want to wait and have the sweet stuff later�. I thought no more of it and just relaxed for a while. At last I decided I really wanted a shower. He stopped me saying �I will personally give you a shower later, but I want to play with my �love toy� one last time before we leave� He lazily stood up, stretched, and took my hand. We walked to the massive four poster bed, and I watched as he threw the pillows and covers off, leaving only the sheet. �I would like for you to lie down in the very middle for me please� I sat on the bed and worked my way to the middle, then lay down. I moved a stray hair from my face and waited. My intestines were starting to turn to mush again. I found myself instinctively crossing my ankles and I was about to cover my breasts and sex when I saw him pick up a wrist cuff from the night stand. Instead I held my hand out to him and watched as he locked a cuff on it. He walked











around the bed and repeated the procedure with my other hand. Then he reached into the drawer of the night stand and removed four short pieces of rope. He tied a rope to the cuff, stretched my arm out and tied it to the nearest post at the head of the bed. As he was walking back around the bed, he dropped a rope beside each ankle. With the last piece of rope he stretched my other arm out, pulled it snug, and tied it to a post also. He reached into the drawer again and brought out two more cuffs that matched the ones on my wrists. He went to the foot of the bed, held one out and waited. I uncrossed my ankle and held a foot up for him. The fear was growing inside me as he locked the cuffs around my ankles. �Spread your legs� he said softly. I moved my heels a few inches apart on the sheet. Quietly he said �No, I would like you to spread your legs as far apart as you can without it hurting you� It took a lot of effort to move my legs. I parted them until it was uncomfortable, moved them back a small amount, and looked down my body as he tied the ropes to the cuffs. I felt him pull the ropes snug as he tied them to the posts at the foot of the bed. I was stretched out like an X and tied tight enough that I had very little movement. I was trying to will myself to calm down and I concentrated on slowing my breathing. �I will be right back, don&#8217;t go anywhere� he said in a cheerful voice. He came back carrying the tray of syrup, sat it on the night stand and plugged the heating cord into a receptacle. I knew instantly what he had in mind. �I need a few more things and we will get started� he said. He returned with a spoon, the ice cream, and a huge feather. I realized then that this may be a long afternoon. He started with the feather. Agonizingly slow, he ran it down my arms, around each breast, and then teased my nipples. The trip continued down my stomach, around my belly button, and played on my clit for a while. He ran it down the insides of my thighs, and then made his way back up my body. This went on until I was so close to release that I was panting, and then he stopped and waited for my breathing to return to normal. I could do nothing










as I watched him pick up a jar of syrup, dip the spoon into it and let it slowly drip onto my nipple. I moaned as the warm liquid inched its way down my breast. He picked up a different flavor and did the same to my other nipple. Using a third flavor he dribbled syrup from my breasts down to my belly button, around it, and then dangerously close to my sex. Smiling he opened the container of ice cream and I shook my head no. �Please no, not that!� I begged. He dipped out a spoonful and turned it upside down over my belly button. I tensed as the ice cream stuck to the spoon for a second and then fell. My back came off the bed as far as the ropes would let me and I gasped. He bent over and started licking the syrup off my breasts and sucking it from my nipples while the ice cream melted on my belly. He licked his way down my tummy and finally ate the ice cream. My body went wild when he licked the last of it out of my belly button. The journey continued down to my sex and then he stopped to pick up another jar of syrup. The last two flavors were dribbled down the insides of my thighs, and then I watched as he removed his clothes. He climbed onto the bed between my legs and starting at my knees he licked his way up the inside of each leg until he reached the promise land. I was going out of my mind as his tongue reached my sex and I closed my eyes as his full weight lay on top of me.&nbsp; He entered me and in just a few moments, wave after wave of release swept over me.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When he recovered he untied me and removed the cuffs for the last time that weekend. He put his arm around me and held me as we walked to the shower. When the water was steaming hot we stepped in and he lovingly washed the syrup off, and then washed my hair. When I was clean I stepped out and dried off with one of those big fluffy towels. I was blow drying my hair when he finished his shower and said, �I&#8217;m going to get dressed and start packing the car; you can take your time getting ready� Later I was surprised to find that putting on clothes again after being naked all weekend felt really strange. Once again feelings I had never experienced before were coursing through me.







 

CHAPTER 13. HIS STORY

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She was still sleeping peacefully when I awoke Sunday Morning. The cabin was a mess from the night before and I spent some time putting things away and getting prepared to leave that afternoon. Starvation was about to overtake me, so I ordered breakfast and her favorite ice cream, Blue Bunny chocolate. Once before I had brought home Blue Bell ice cream, and vowed never to make that mistake again. I had a master plan for the day&#8217;s activities, but now it seemed like too much work. I decided to take my shower and come up with a new plan. As I came out of the shower she was sitting on the bed with her arms raised high over her head, stretching like a cat. Mercy, she does have an effect on me. She gave me that pouty face of hers and held out her cuffed hands toward me. It crossed my mind that I may not be the one in control here. I separated her cuffs, unlocked them from her wrists and watched as she headed for the bathroom. Room service was at the front door, so I closed the bedroom door on the way out. I watched in amazement as the young man set the table. Did I really order that much food? I saw the bedroom door open and wondered if his smile was because he caught a glimpse of her before she jumped back. After he left we ate till we were stuffed. The syrup for the pancakes was sitting in a heated serving tray, and while eating I came up with a main event for the day. I waited until she got restless and then I led her to the big four poster bed. I tossed the pillows from the bed onto the floor and took off all the covers. I asked her to lie in the middle and watched as she worked her way across the bed and got comfortable. I picked up a wrist cuff and she automatically held out her hand. I locked it on her, then circled the bed and cuffed her other hand. I had already cut four pieces rope into two foot lengths and put them into the nightstand in preparation my original master plan. I took one piece of rope and tied it to the cuff. Stretching her arm tight I, tied it to the post at the head&nbsp; of the bed. I dropped two pieces of rope by her ankles on the way back to the other side, and then I took the last piece of rope and tied her other arm while











stretching it out tight. I reached into the drawer again and removed the ankle cuffs. I went to the foot of the bed and held them up for her to see. She had crossed her ankles and I could tell she was nervous about letting me cuff them. After a few moments she raised a foot so I could lock a cuff on, and then offered me her other ankle. I asked her to spread her legs, but she only moved them apart a few inches. I quietly explained that I wanted them as far apart as possible, and she reluctantly complied. I finished tying her legs to the bed posts and my desire for her was growing at a phenomenal rate. I went into the kitchen and brought back the heated syrup tray, then made a second trip for a spoon, the ice cream, and a feather I had bought at the adult toy store. I started stroking her lightly with the feather and I took my time teasing her body, hoping I could make her as turned on as I. When I suspected she was close, I stopped and waited for her to settle down.&nbsp; Then I watched her intently as I picked up the spoon and a jar of warm syrup. I greatly enjoyed the look of trepidation on her pretty face as I slowly dribbled warm maple syrup on her nipple causing her to gasp. It was fascinating to see it slowly cover her breast. I chose a different flavor and repeated the process on the other nipple. I took yet a third flavor and slowly dribbled it down her flat tummy, around her belly button, and as close to her sex as I dared. I then reached for the ice cream, and smiled as she started begging me �NO�. I took a spoon full and watched as it dropped it into her belly button. She arched her back and pulled at her bonds so hard I thought the ropes would break. I started licking the syrup off her breasts and sucked on her nipples. I licked down her tummy and as I ate the ice cream from her belly button she went wild in her bonds. Choosing another flavor of syrup I dribbled it from her sex down the inside of her thigh, then chose still yet another flavor and did the same to the other thigh. My desire for her was starting to overcome my will power fast and I could wait no longer. I took











my clothes off and climbed between her legs. I licked up the inside of one thigh, stopped and continued up the other until I reached her clit. I smiled as she quivered and knew she was ready. I entered her and it wasn&#8217;t long until&nbsp; the waves of release were washing over her. A few minutes later it was my turn to have the release I had been craving. It took a long time to regain my strength, and then I untied her and removed the cuffs. We both really needed a shower and walked arm in arm to the bathroom. I washed the syrup from her and then shampooed her hair. When she got out to towel off, I took my second shower for the day. I got dressed and started packing the car.

CHAPTER 14. HER STORY

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I waited in the car while he went into the office of the resort to settle the bill. As he was getting back in the car I put on my best smile and said �Honey, the next time the kids spend a weekend with their father, I want to do this again�. He smiled from ear to ear and said �Wow! I can hardly wait!� I believe that timing is everything, so I waited patiently while he started the car and put on his seatbelt. Then as he was reaching for the shifter I said �And it will be YOUR turn to be MY �love toy!�. His hand never made it to the shifter. The smile disappeared from his face and he slowly turned to face me. He sat there looking at me with those intense blue eyes, searching into mine to see if I was serious.&nbsp; There was no emotion on his face, no anger, no sadness, possibly there was curiosity. This time I was sure there was no one to interrupt us. I waited until he blinked and then I asked �Where did you get those toys, I am definitely going to need a shopping trip before we come back!� He was looking out the window past me now. There was certainly emotion on his face, and it appeared to be panic! I let reality set in for a couple of minutes, and when I thought he was ready I said �When you












 unload the car, would you be kind enough to sit that box with the video game and all of its attachments on my desk. I want plenty of time to read the instructions before I use them on you� He was lost in his own little world and gave no response. �Honey, you don&#8217;t look so well. Are you OK?� Again I waited, but he said nothing. �Honey, you look pale, I think I should drive home�. I can&#8217;t explain why, but on occasion I have a need to find his limits. I blame it on being a red head.
