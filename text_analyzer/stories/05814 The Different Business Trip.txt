7. A visit at the dentist

Carl laid awake in the bondage bed. After some time, the lights went on. In came Mrs. Rachel with two guards. They took place at the door. Mrs. Rachel wore a tight blue outfit and shiny black boots with high heels. Her blond hair was pinned up. She went over to Carl and deeply looked into his eyes. She cruelly smiled at him. �It&#8217;s time for your yearly dental check-up.� Carl shuddered. With that Mrs. Rachel left the cell. The guards unstrapped him and tied his hands behind his back. They dragged him out of the cell to the elevator and took it two floors downwards. Then they forced him down the corridor to a door. They opened. It appeared a large windowless room &#8211; completely covered with white tiles and bright lights. It looked like a doctor&#8217;s treatment room. In the middle of the room was a large white padded dentist&#8217;s chair bolted to the floor. There hung white straps from the armrests and there were special restraints for the feet. In front of it was a rack with various drills. Carl shivered. He tried to resist, but the strong guards dragged him to the chair. Then he was strapped down &#8216;till he could hardly move: His wrists to the armrests &#8211; his feet were buckled to the two footrests. A large white belt was pulled tight around his chest and over his upper arms. The guards left wordless and closed the door. With fear he stared at the drills in front of him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After around twenty minutes, Carl heard somebody coming along the corridor. His heart heavily pounded. The door opened and in went Lady Mercedes and Lady Dana. They both wore white doctor dresses with white trousers and shiny white high-heeled boots. Lady Dana carried a silver tray covered by a white napkin that she placed next to the chair. When she took away the napkin, Carl was frightened. He saw lots of vicious dentist tools on it. �Mr. Petersen, did you always brushed your teeth like a good boy?�, asked Lady Mercedes in a strong voice. Meanwhile Lady Dana went around to the headrest of the chair and fixed a strap around Carl&#8217;s forehead, so his head was tied back to the headrest. There were padded metal braces on each side of his head. Lady Dana turned adjusting knobs until the braces held his head tightly. Now no motion was possible.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lady Mercedes sat herself into a swivel chair beside Carl. She touched a switch with her foot and the back of the dentist&#8217;s chair began to lower. Then she turned on a bright light and put the beam of light to his mouth. Carl&#8217;s eyes widened as she took a sharp stainless steel toothpick and a small mirror. �Now open wide!�, she ordered. But Carl refused to do it. �Should Lady Dana bring the Bunsen burner again?� Carl gave up, while Lady Dana handed Lady Mercedes a special bracelet. Cautiously he opened his mouth a bit. In went the padded bracelet between his upper incisor teeth and his jaw. It had a special device to hold his tongue down like a tongue depressor from hell. With small knobs Lady Mercedes slowly widened the dental bracelet until his mouth was forced completely open. Then she took the toothpick and the mirror again and thoroughly examined his teeth without hurting him. Afterwards she stood up and turned over to the sink to wash her hands. �Unfortunately there is a hole in one of your lower molars�, she said without looking at him. Carl had a panic fear.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lady Mercedes went over to him while she dried her hands with a towel. �Do you want an anaesthetization?�, she asked. Carl tried to nod his head but it was impossible. He made some unidentify noises and pleaded with his eyes. Lady Mercedes smiled: �You don&#8217;t need one. Such a brave little fellow.� Carl tried to move, but he was firmly secured. Lady Mercedes and Lady Dana then put on white masks over their mouths and nearly transparent latex gloves. Lady Dana went to his head and patted Carl&#8217;s face from behind the chair. �This is going to hurt you�, she said sadistically when she looked down on him. Carl&#8217;s eyes widened in fear when Lady Mercedes took the drill and hold it in front of his face. Then she turned on the drill, that made a terrible clinically sound, and leaned forward to him. She guided the drill into his mouth and carefully began to drill into one of his molars. Muffled pleas for mercy escaped from Carl&#8217;s mouth which turned to screams of pure agony as the drill cut into his tooth. Lady Mercedes drilled carefully through the enamel. Soon she hit the nerve. Steam rose from the tooth that she was drilling and Carl screamed in pain. Lady Mercedes worked with excruciating slowness. Carl&#8217;s pain was beyond belief &#8211; he thought that he would go insane and his throat ripped raw from the screaming.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Around five minutes Lady Mercedes drilled in his tooth. Carl nearly passed out from the pain. Then she took the drill away. Carl breathed heavily. �Lady Dana, would you please remove his saliva by the ejector�, asked Lady Mercedes. Lady Dana took place. It made a slurping sound when she thoroughly vacuumed his oral cavity with a drain tube. When it was done, Lady Mercedes sat down again. She took the sharp stainless steel toothpick from the tray and pressed it firmly into the hole. Carl screamed madly and trashed in his bonds. Tears were in his eyes from the pain. Then she stopped. �We can grind down all your teeth to the gums &#8211; one by one.� Lady Mercedes looked into his terrified eyes. Carl cried softly. With this the ladies turned over, throw the masks and the gloves into a waste bin and left the room. Carl whimpered.

The Different Business Trip

Carl Petersen was a business man who worked successfully for a medium-sized oil company. His main area of responsibility was in Saudi Arabia and so he often travelled into the Middle East. One day, it was at the beginning of his annual vacation, two large men in dark suits rang at the door of his apartment. They showed him two cards and said that the &#8216;Department Of Homeland Security&#8217; had some questions and therefore he should come with them. Carl hesitated. After they affirmed that it won&#8217;t last too long and they would bring him back home right after the questioning he went with them. Carl wondered what they wanted from him but as a patriot he got his jacket.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The men went to a black Mercedes limousine. One guy opened the back door and Carl sat down on the back seat. The two men in front of him. Then they drove straight through the city into one of the outside districts. Finally they arrived at a large building, Carl never noticed before. They drove to a heavy gate that opened immediately &#8211; it led directly into an underground car park. The men left the car, guided Carl to an elevator and took it five floors upwards. They went through a long clear corridor to a glass door. They opened. It appeared a bright office with a large wooden desk and a comfortable leather office chair. In front of the desk was another chair &#8211; a small one. �Take a seat�, said one of the men. �Someone will be with you in a few minutes.� With that the men kept Carl guessing about what these people wanted from him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After around ten minutes the door opened and in went the two men with a large woman. �Ah, Mr. Petersen�, said the woman. �I am Mrs. Rachel.� She sat down at the desk. Mrs. Rachel was in her mid-fifties &#8211; with a well-groomed appearance: She wore a beige pinstriped business suit with a tight skirt going down to just below her knees, a shear white high collar blouse, black stockings and shiny black ankle boots with spike heels. A black push-up bra was clearly visible through the blouse. Her hydrogen-blond hair was pinned up. She had put bright red lipstick on. When she took out some documents, Carl saw her long perfect painted red fingernails &#8211; like claws.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Mr. Petersen, there is no time, so I&#8217;m coming to the point right now. We need to know everything about your contacts in the Middle East�, she said. �I cannot say that�, replied Carl. �They are company&#8217;s secrets.� �You have to! The security of your country depends on it.� Mrs. Rachel urged him most strongly to do so. �If you refuse to tell us what we want to know, we&#8217;re going to force you.� �You cannot detain me here. I haven&#8217;t done anything.� �We can and we will, Mr. Petersen�, warned Mrs. Rachel. �That&#8217;s ridiculous�, said Carl. With this he stood up and went to the door. But the guards blocked his way out. After a short hand to hand fight, the guards wrestled Carl down and pressed him to the floor. Mrs. Rachel brought a large syringe and a phial. Then she squatted beside him. She wound up the syringe with a solution from the phial and snapped at it. �I guarantee you&#8217;ve never felt anything like this before.� With her right hand she grabbed his head by the hair. Pulling on it, she forced his head sideward. �What you&#8217;re doing?� Carl&#8217;s eyes widened in fear. Without any other word Mrs. Rachel pressed the needle into his carotid. Carl flagged. Then the men hauled his lifeless body back to the elevator.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They took it two floors downwards and brought him to a white coated heavy steel door. Inside was a white tiled windowless cell. Not too large, with only one furniture: In one corner of the room was a flat bed. It had an universal system of fixing &#8211; like the one used for securing patients at psychiatric departments. Carl was conscious of being stripped by the guards and put in a white shirt and white trousers. Then the upper part of Carl&#8217;s body was put into a kind of corset before the guards lifted him up and placed him onto the bondage bed. A broad belt was fixed around his belly. Next his wrists were fixed in padded cuffs beside his body. Two additional belts were put to the chest set, preventing him definitely from rising from the bed. Then a set of belts for immobilisation of the lower extremities was affixed. It included fixative belts for each thighs and cuffs for the ankles. When they&#8217;d finished, the guards left the cell and locked the door. Now Carl was completely secured to the bondage bed and pumped full of tranquillizer.









First meeting

After some sleep, Carl was awoke. Still weak from the drugs. He gradually became aware that he was fixed to a bed in one corner of a darkened room. There was a dim light overhead, but the light didn&#8217;t reach the other corners of the room. He tried to move his arms and discovered that each of his wrists was handcuffed to one side of the bed. Carl pulled hard against the cuffs but there was no freedom of movement. He was overcome with that sinking feeling one gets when they are very frightened as he realized the predicament he was in. Stiffened with fear.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Soon he heard rapid footsteps of heels. Bright lights went on and the door opened. Two beautiful tall dark-haired ladies came in. They wore severe dark blue business outfits &#8211; trouser suits and shiny black stiletto boots. Both went to the bed he was tied to. The six-inch heels of their knee-high boots were clicking cruelly on the tiled floor. One went beside his head and the other one at the foot of the bed. �My name is Lady Mercedes &#8211; this is Lady Dana�, said the one beside him in a strong voice.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lady Mercedes was a tall woman with black shoulder-length hair that she&#8217;d tied together to a ponytail. She was in her mid-fourties and had a prominent look. Lady Dana was maybe ten years younger &#8211; with her long dark-brown hair she looked like her younger sister. Lady Mercedes put her hands on the hips when she looked down on him. Carl saw strong fingers with perfect manicured long red nails. Around her right wrist dangled a heavy plaited silver chain. She also wore a wedding ring. �There we have our little offender�, said Lady Mercedes. �We can do very painful things to you. Should we give him a little demonstration?�, she asked Lady Dana. �Sure!� With that, Lady Dana kneeled down and took his left little toe between thumb and forefinger of her right hand. Then she glanced up into his terrified eyes. With heavy pressure she pressed against the joint of his toe until it cracked. Carl cried out loud as Lady Dana bent his little toe backwards with a jerk, snapping the bone audibly. His little toe was broken. �Oh, did Lady Dana hurt you?�, smiled Lady Mercedes. �This was just an appetizer. How about some role playing games? You won&#8217;t like them. But &#8211; remember &#8211; you can stop this anytime. When you tell us everything we want to know.� With these words Lady Mercedes and Lady Dana walked away quickly. Carl was left wailing in his bondage bed.









Feeding time

The cell was soundproof. The only indication that anyone was at the door was when it slid open. Three intimidating looking men walked in. Wordlessly the men freed Carl from the bondage bed, grabbed him by his arms and pulled him up. After he was being forced to his feet, his wrists were handcuffed behind his back. Carl was more carried than walked out of the cell, down a hallway to the known elevator. Again it led two floors downwards. Carl thought of the �gym� that he had been in earlier, and momentarily panic made it hard for him to breathe. But they walked past the room.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The guards brought Carl down the corridor to another room which was obviously a kitchen. On the stove something was cooking in a pot. In the middle of the tiled windowless room was a heavy chair bolted to the floor. It looked like a kind of dentist&#8217;s chair with armrests and a padded headrest. There were heavy straps for the arms and the feet. The guards dragged Carl to this chair, in which he was firmly secured: His wrists to each of the armrests and the ankles in special foot straps. Then a broad padded belt was fixed around his chest and upper arms. When he was tied down the guards left the room and shut the door.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After around ten minutes Carl heard the well-known sound of the heels. The door went open and Lady Mercedes and Lady Dana came in. They said nothing at first. Lady Mercedes went to the stove and gleefully stirred in the pot. Both wore long white latex aprons with cooking symbols over their blouses, tight blue jeans and shiny black high-heeled knee boots. Their dark hair tied back to a pigtail and a nice strong make-up with dark eyes and bright red lipstick on. Carl shuddered.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You have Lady Dana to thank for your gourmet meal. She had diarrhoea.� Lady Mercedes took the pot and showed Carl the bubbling lumpy brown substance. He could smell the contents and started to choke. �Broth loaded with clots�, described Lady Mercedes. �It&#8217;s fresh, but we kept it warm for you.� His eyes widened in fear &#8211; then he began to shake his head wildly from side to side. Lady Mercedes put the pot back on the stove. �Don&#8217;t make such a fuss!�, she said. Lady Dana was back around at the headrest. Next she was strapping his head down with a leather strap over his forehead. She smiled at him and his eyes saw what almost appeared to be a caring woman with long dark hair and full breast. In the meantime Lady Mercedes went to a cabinet and brought another fixture device that was for the uncooperate clients. It was fastened on the back of the headrest with some screws. The device had two padded metal braces on either side of Carl&#8217;s head. With a firm grip of her right hand Lady Dana took his head under the chin and with the other hand on his forehead to hold it steady. Then Lady Mercedes turned adjusting knobs until the braces held his head tightly at his temples &#8211; like it was clamped into a vice. Now his head was totally immobile and utterly stiff fixed. �So, Mr. Petersen, when you&#8217;re refusing to eat, we will help you.� Lady Mercedes pushed a button and the chair started tilting back until Carl was nearly in a lying position &#8211; strapped firmly into the chair. Lady Dana brought a white bib on which was written in light blue cursive writing: �Feed me�. It was tied around Carl&#8217;s neck. Meanwhile Lady Mercedes took a small bowl from the cabinet and with a ladle put some of the stinking mash in it. She put the bowl on a table beside the chair, along with a small yellow plastic spoon.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Now it&#8217;s eating time�, said Lady Mercedes. Carefully she took some of the hot brown soup with the spoon from the edge of the bowl and hold it in front of Carl&#8217;s mouth. �Say &#8216;ah&#8217;�, she ordered. But Carl refused to open. Lady Mercedes sadistically smiled at him. She nodded to Lady Dana who then went to one of the cabinets. When she came back into Carl&#8217;s view, she brought something like a bracelet and a Bunsen burner. The first thing she put to use was the burner: Soon she opened the gas tap and lighted the flame. Lady Mercedes took the sinister looking dental gag and held it in front of his mouth. �Open!� Carl didn&#8217;t react. Thereupon Lady Dana turned a knob and converted the flickering flame into a very hot blue one. She rolled up the right sleeve of his shirt. It sizzled when Lady Dana took the Bunsen burner and held the flame near Carl&#8217;s forearm. He screamed out in pain &#8211; and while he was opening his mouth, Lady Mercedes easily put the dental gag between his teeth. �There you go!�, she laughed. With that Lady Dana took the burner away. Lady Mercedes slowly opened the metal gag until the ratchet audibly blocked his jaw &#8211; keeping his mouth wide open. Carl widened his eyes in terror when Lady Mercedes gave him the first spoonful of shit. �Enjoy your meal!� Carl tried desperately to beg but the dental gag turned his efforts into humiliating baby talk. Lady Mercedes cooed to him as if he were a big baby. �Yum! Yum!� She smiled at him. Carl struggled in the restraints &#8211; his body arched up in the chair. He shook wildly as he began to gag and retch. But Lady Mercedes skilfully massaged Carl&#8217;s convulsing throat to help ease the shit down. First it kept coming back up. With Lady Mercedes coaxing him skilfully, Carl eventually choked it down and kept it down. �Very good! The first yummy spoonful is always the hardest.� He had to force it down. Then she gave him a second spoonful &#8211; this time with lumps. He retched and retched. Tears rushed into his eyes from the loathing. �If you puke we&#8217;re going to repeat the procedure with your own vomit�, warned Lady Mercedes. Even with this approach it took a considerable amount of time before he managed to hold down his meal.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Spoonful by spoonful Carl was fed with the warm excrement. She gave him small portions of mess. Things went smoothly for a minute or two, but then he began regurgitating the repellent repast they had prepared for him. The unequal struggle continued for a time, but it was soon apparent that he had no ability to prevent his body from reacting this way to what he was being fed. From time to time, when something remained stuck to his chin, Lady Mercedes picked it up carefully with the yellow plastic spoon and wiped it to his tongue. They had time�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good boy�, laughed Lady Mercedes when the bowl was empty. It left a bitter taste in Carl&#8217;s mouth. He experienced the warm disgusting mash that spread like chewing gum in his mouth. But Carl was relieved that it was over. He felt as if it made his stomach turn. �I have some nice dessert for you.� Lady Mercedes went to the refrigerator and took a small plate with a hard dark-brown �sausage� out of it. �I did this for you yersterday�, said Lady Mercedes. Carl began to cry. Lady Dana brought a can with a viscid limpidly fluid. �I&#8217;d leveraged Lady Dana to a wonderful orgasm this morning�, Lady Mercedes laughed and cajoled, �we&#8217;re such generous hosts, and even provide a sauce for your sweets!� Then she poured the slimy stuff over the hard chunk. Again she put the plate on the table and sat down on the stool beside him. She took a small bit with a clear plastic spoon. �That&#8217;s delicious, I&#8217;m sure�, she smiled. With this she put the small piece of cold hard shit with cum into Carl&#8217;s mouth. He retched. Immediately he felt how his mouth was stuffed with the bitter brown pulp. Then a bigger piece. Carl&#8217;s eyes widened when he began another desperate struggle. But he got it down and kept it down. Again and again &#8211; the complete �dessert�. Lady Mercedes grinned.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That's a good boy! We give you something to wash it down.� Lady Dana went to the fridge and brought a litre bottle with a dark yellow-red liquid. She hold it in front of Carl and sarcastically said: �That&#8217;s not blood orange juice &#8211; but similar.� Carl&#8217;s eyes bulged in terror as Lady Dana smiled down at him. �I have my period.� She put the bottle on the table. Then she reached to the utility cupboard nearby and took out a large clear plastic funnel, which had a wide opening. Carl grimaced when the funnel-like tool was forcibly screwed down his gullet. He strangled. Lady Mercedes opened the bottle and began pouring some of the yellow piss into the funnel. But Carl refused to swallow. Lady Dana snapped on a nose clip to pinch his nostrils shut, forcing Carl to breathe through the funnel. �Now you have to swallow it all down before you can breathe.� She smiled wickedly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carl was fighting hard &#8211; he gagged and gasped for air. Now the only way he was able to breathe was through the large funnel violating his mouth and throat. He choked incessantly. Lady Mercedes filled more of the yellow liquidness in the funnel. It wasn&#8217;t too long before Carl had no choice: swallow or suffocate. He was given ten seconds to drink the urine before another portion was forced into his mouth. Carl gagged at the piss that was running down his throat and immediately started retching. Little by little Lady Mercedes poured in the funnel when he&#8217;d drunk off until the bottle was empty. Pee gurgled into his throat as he struggled emptying the funnel in order to breathe. He had a disgruntled look and shifted in his bonds when loads of yellow piss was poured down his throat. Now it was an endless stream with no breaks and seemingly no end. Sputtering and wheezing he finally gulped it down &#8211; his chest heaving as he gasped for air.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Carl wailed constantly as he was forced to ingest the dark yellow piss. Over and over the process was repeated until the �soap� was completely consumed. By the end Carl was exhausted &#8211; he just moaned. �Don&#8217;t be so squeamish! We&#8217;re going to do a lot of worse things with you. That was just the appetizer.� They laughed. Lady Mercedes and Lady Dana left the room. The guards came and unstrapped him. He was guided into his cell where he was laid back into the restraints.
