THE VIOLATION OF NURSE MARY DAY
My name is Douglas Sinclair; at the time of the following incident I was 28 years old. Born of British and Chinese Parents; my Father was a member of staff at the British Embassy and my Mother worked as an interpreter with the British Foreign Office.&nbsp; My tale takes place during the unforgettable Christmas of 1941, when the island of Hong Kong still belonged to the British Empire, and I was employed as a Caretaker at St. Stephen�s College.&nbsp; At this period of our history, British, Canadian and Indian troops had for weeks passed, been locked in a bloody conflict with the forces of the Imperial Japanese Army, and St. Stephen�s college was being used as a hospital to treat the allied casualties from the front line; as I recall it the hospital was nursing more than ninety wounded soldiers at the time. It soon became clear to me that things were not going well, from talking to the wounded it became obvious that the allied armies were hopelessly outnumbered; I became convinced it could be only a matter of time before the Jap�s got the upper hand, as a result I believed the college would soon be in enemy hands, so I decided to make preparations against just such an eventuality.

The college building was one of the tallest structures in the vicinity, so its large roof could not be overlooked, the roof was flat, several metal ventilation shafts with wooden shutters were dotted about at various intervals upon its surface; these shafts I decided would make ideal hidey-hole�s in an emergency. There were several skylights which doubled as access points to the roof, so providing I was careful, I could keep an eye on the enemy and when thing�s had calmed down as they eventually would, I could simply re-appear; then due to my parentage I would be able to blend in with the local population. I continued over several days to stash away substantial reserves of food and water against a prolonged period of hiding.

It would have been about 10 O�clock at night on Christmas Eve, when, on passing the nurses staff room, I heard someone weeping; on entering the staff room to investigate, I found Nurse Mary Day, she was alone, sitting at a table head in hands sobbing like a frightened child. Nurse Day I guess would have been around 19 years-old, strikingly beautiful in appearance with a&nbsp; flawless, smooth as silk, slightly bronzed complexion, curly, shoulder length blonde hair and the deepest blue-eyes; she stood around 5� 6� in height, and was further blessed with the classic �hour-glass� figure, a walking, talking wet-dream if ever there was one! Sitting down at the table next to her, I placed my arm gently around her shoulders and enquired as to why she was so upset. It transpired that earlier that day she had received bad news concerning Alicia, her cousin.&nbsp; Alicia had been living with her husband�s parents in a village around 5 miles from Hong Kong, when it had been over-run by Japanese troops. According to an eye witness, who later managed to escape the carnage, there was indiscriminate slaughter, and Alicia�s in-laws had been savagely butchered in front of her eyes by hordes of drunken Japanese soldiers, then driven mad by an alcohol fuelled lust, they turned their attentions towards her 22 year-old cousin. Alicia had been beaten, tortured and raped for hour upon hour, until the poor wretch eventually died from the savagery inflicted upon her. Still shaking with fear, it became apparent that Mary was terrified of meeting the same fate as her cousin.
With my arm still around the girls shoulders, I gave the frightened teenager a gentle squeeze and attempted to re-assure her, I promised her that if the Jap�s did manage to attack the hospital I could personally see to it that she was hidden away somewhere within the building where no-one would ever find her. 

Although re-assured, Mary was still upset and clearly in no fit state to resume her nursing duties; at my suggestion, she agreed that a good sleep would probably do her the world of good, I further suggested that for safety it would be best to sleep in one of the offices on the top floor, that way if anything did occur during the night, I could immediately wake her and we could escape together via one of the skylights; 15 minutes later, curled up on an old couch in one of the offices, Nurse Day had fallen into a deep and thankful sleep. 

It would have been about 1.30 in the morning when I first heard the sounds of gun fire in the distance; shortly afterwards the hospital became a scene of chaos, panic and confusion. Concealed from view near the top of the first floor stairs, I watched as the first of the Japanese soldiers were met at the hospital entrance by two senior doctors, both were instantly shot several times then bayoneted for good measure. Soon afterwards, the soldiers burst into the wards were they embarked on an orgy of mutilation. Wounded allied soldiers who were incapable of defending themselves were either shot or butchered in their beds. A foolishly brave doctor who tried to protect his patients suddenly found himself looking down upon his own entrails as they burst out from a gaping bayonet wound to his stomach. Any male that exhibited the slightest token of resistance was immediately and brutally slaughtered.

By the time I reached the office in which Nurse Day was still sleeping, blissfully unaware of the impending danger below, the Jap�s had begun wreaking havoc on the 2nd floor; at the rate they were going, I estimated that we had 6 to 7 minutes in which to make our escape.
I burst into the office and switched on the lights, the sudden commotion awoke Mary with a frightened start. I quickly conveyed to her the necessity of immediate escape as I positioned a chair underneath one of the skylights. Pushing back the cover I paused for a moment, I could here the unmistakable sound of women screaming from the floor below; the marauding soldiers had located some of the twenty or so young nurses on duty, and were proceeding to gang-rape and torture them with all the bestial cruelty of which they were capable. I looked at Mary, She was pale and anguished, I could see the look of pure terror in her eyes; if those lust driven, drunken savages ever managed to get their hands upon such a prize as this innocent young girl; it was unthinkable even to imagine her fate, yet even as those thoughts began to cross my mind, I became conscious of my rapidly hardening cock. I was suddenly alarmed to hear the sound of pounding feet and angry shouts in the distance; the Jap soldiers were now closing in. I quickly heaved myself up through the skylight and out onto the roof, Susan had climbed up onto the chair and was now stretching up to grab my hand; the soldiers were now close, very close, a cruel and rabid mob fuelled by lust, hunting as a pack and searching for their next victim. I reached down and grabbed Mary�s hand, I took a firm grip and held on tight, but I didn�t pull her up. 
She looked up at me in desperation, bewildered and confused, she began to panic, she tried to pull away from me, but I had her hand locked in mine. I watched as the tears began to stream down her face. The soldiers were approaching along the corridor, drawn like moths, heading towards the only office where the lights were on. The desperate girl made a last but futile lunge with her free hand in an effort to grab my arm, it was at that moment that I choose to let go of her hand. Her face a picture of wide-eyed terror, clawing in desperation at the empty space before her; she teetered precariously on the edge of the chair before crashing heavily upon the wooden floor. 
It was a matter of only a moment for me to lower the glass cover to the skylight; kneeling there surrounded by the inky blackness of the night sky, I could look down unobserved into the well lit interior of the office. I could see Mary prostrate on the floor below, still lying there winded from her fall. At that moment the door to the office was kicked violently back on its hinges, as three, then four, then five obviously drunk Japanese soldiers burst headlong into the room, every one of their sadistic yellow faces exhibiting a picture of evil and cruel intent; they had found another victim, and this one was young, almost certainly virginal, with a figure that made her particularly choice.&nbsp; 
The poor young nurse screamed in despair as the brave soldiers of the imperial Japanese army threw themselves upon her. I watched entranced, almost overcome by my own heightened feelings of lust as they began to maul and grope their helpless victim, claw like hands grabbed and squeezed her firm succulent breasts, while other�s thrust their hands up under her uniform, caressing the bare flesh at the top of her thighs, fingers poking, searching, squeezing and prodding; the crotch of her white silk-knickers roughly pulled aside, as cruel stabbing fingers, probing, and ramming, forced their way into the tight dry hole&nbsp; of their screaming victim. The basest urges within the girl�s rapists were beginning to build, they realised now that their victim was indeed a virgin, they start to jockey for position, each of them desperate to be the one; overwhelmed by the need to punish her with their cocks, to fuck her hard, the primeval urge to breed and impregnate. The hem of the nurse�s uniform was soon bunched around the girl�s waist; her silk-knickers were grabbed and torn away, the final barrier to her sex had gone, her breasts jumped and shook as the front of her uniform was ripped from neck to waist, her bra followed seconds later, the violence of the act made her nipples harden momentarily. The girl continued to scream, crying out again and again, begging for help, hoping against hope that someone would come to her aid, suddenly her arms were yanked back over her head and pinned; two of the soldiers were each holding an ankle, and they were spreading her legs; before she knew what�s happening, the first was on top of her, he grabbed a fist full of her hair, and yanked her head back, he wanted to look into her eyes, he wanted to feed of her anguish, her pain and her fear. Suddenly she feels it, hard and unyielding; it feels impossibly large as it probes and stabs at her opening, she can feel the tip, its wet and slimy with pre-cum, he�s searching in earnest now, suddenly its hard-up against the lips of her pussy, she gasps, the fear she feels is reflected in her eyes, as her rapists mouth forms into a cruel sneer, he screams something at her in Japanese,&nbsp; and lunges forward, his buttocks clench tight as the force behind this cruel punishing thrust&nbsp; transfers to his rock hard penis, he punches through, ripping and tearing as he skewers her cunt. The sudden pain from her abused pussy almost overwhelming her senses, her agonised scream was a terrible thing to behold, as I continued to watch the lust crazed soldier rape away her innocence. 

As the pace of her rapist began to quicken, Mary became possessed of a new and more terrifying fear, as I watched, she became more and more animated as her rapist pistoned his cock ever deeper and faster into her young cunt. He was about to perform the ultimate act of defilement and the pretty young nurse was well aware of what that could mean. The Japanese soldiers cock was now ploughing into her pussy at an alarming rate, she tried to beg and plead with her attacker, and she tried desperately to struggle free, but pinned down as she was, she knew it was hopeless; every stroke of his cock now became a short jabbing thrust into her cunt, and his pace was becoming frenzied, her whole body suddenly stiffened, and she screamed out in frustration; the normally attractive face of the pretty 19 year-old nurse was now a mask of fear and despair, her rapist had buried himself to the hilt in her warm and receptive cunt, and his rampant cock was unloading its first thick jet of sperm. Mary could feel her attackers cock pulsing uncontrollably inside her, she knew that each and every ripple along its length, meant another deposit of potent seed, deep inside her fertile young cunt. 
The first soldier to rape her had lasted barely five minutes, as he withdrew his rapidly deflating penis a mixture of blood and sperm began to ooze out from the girls sore and abused sex. The next soldier to fuck her was little more than a boy, watching his comrade defiling the young nurse had worked him up to the ultimate peak of arousal, barely had his engorged cock bottomed out inside the girls cunt when he too added a fresh deposit of creamy potent seed. Mary had kept her eyes tightly closed throughout this rape, her screams had now subsided, replaced by a pitiful sobbing, but as she felt the cock of the second rapist flooding her with a second torrent of sperm, she let forth another despairing moan of anguish. I watched as the third, then the fourth soldier took their turns with the girl and it was just as the sperm from fourth rapist was being deposited, that I heard the commotion. Crawling along with a raging hard-on in my pants wasn�t something I found particularly comfortable, but I was curious to find out what was developing; as I reached the end of the roof, I peered cautiously over to scan the immediate vicinity. 
If Nurse Mary had been hoping that her ordeal would soon be over, she was going to be grievously disappointed. A second and third wave of General Ito Takeo�s Imperial Japanese Army, numbering around 200 troops, drunk, and further intoxicated with the spirit of victory, were now running amok in the streets below, shooting, bayoneting and beheading as many of the local inhabitants as they could find. In the gloom below, I could just make out the grass verge that bordered the college on two of its sides, a soldier was busy raping a nearly naked young girl, he had both his hands around her neck and was choking the life from her while rutting into her like a vicious wild animal; I continued to watch in morbid fascination, as he literally fucked her to death. Word must have reached some of the newcomers that there was more pussy available in the shape of young nurses, as ninety to a hundred of the ravenous blood thirsty killers began to surge purposefully towards the college entrance. 
Back once again at my viewing point by the skylight; Mary�s hands and legs had now been released, and her fifth rapist was withdrawing his softening member from the nineteen-year-olds swollen and ravaged cunt. In sudden desperation, Mary snatched up a nearby knife, carelessly dropped on to the floor by one of her over excited attackers; her intention was to cut her own throat, she�d decided that death was preferable to what these yellow dogs might do to her next. My heart skipped a beat as she began to raise the knife, but the nearest soldier was far too quick for her and landed a vicious punch to the side of the head; Mary fell to the ground stunned, the knife flew from her hand and clattered to the ground, now tragically out of reach. Seconds later, and fifteen to twenty of the new arrivals were pushing and shoving each other in their eagerness to get through the doorway and into the interior of the office. Ravaged, cum-filled, battered and bruised, the naked young nurse was still an undeniably choice victim, and the most aggressive of the newcomers wasted little time in sampling her charms. To the accompaniment of renewed agonised screaming, her cunt, her mouth, and her anus were all brutally violated, again and again and again, as the merciless band of rapist�s fucked themselves to orgasm inside the wretched teenager�s body. There is of course only so much any man can take, and being only human, I had by now started to masturbate while observing the scene below; it was at the point when another ten or so of the emperors finest burst into the office, that I finally lost it and dumped my own huge wad of sperm on the glass covering of the skylight. 
I spent six days in all, holed up in one of the more spacious ventilation shafts, before things had calmed down enough for me to risk joining the local populous. The day after the slaughter, a huge pyre was built, and all the dead bodies, murdered by the victorious forces of the Japanese army, were burnt in an effort to hide the truth. But no-one who was there, and lived through that day, December 25th 1941 will ever forget.

As for Nurse Mary Day; she did, miraculously survive, I believe she managed to escape from the college a couple of days after her ordeal began. Unfortunately she was detained soon afterwards and imprisoned in a Japanese brothel where, already pregnant, she was fucked day and night by the brave soldiers of the imperial army. I believe it was five children she produced in the end, although it may have been more.
