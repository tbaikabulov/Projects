The smell

Bosnia July, 1995 � A
fountain

&nbsp;

Boris
approached a group of Dutch soldiers. He shortly greeted Fritz - a sergeant he
had been drinking with after the Dutch general had surrendered without a single
shot firing. 

&nbsp;

Ivan � his
second in command just stood and looked at the five youngsters, the Dutch
should have protected. However, instead of protecting them, it had been
arranged that the Dutch would separate men and woman from each other turning
the male over to Boris and his men. It was easier so. If Boris�s men should
have done the job, panic would have risen among the Muslims. Now, still falsely
believing that the UN-sanctioned Dutch would protect them force, the civilians
let themselves be divided in small groups without protest.

&nbsp;

�I am ready
to take charge off the prisoners. I would recommend that you remove your men
before we ship them to their final destination. Some of your men look innocent
and there is no reason to destroy their na�ve understanding of the world. �

&nbsp;

�I do not
mind what their destiny will be. Seeing it would not mean anything to me. But
of course you are right. Some of my men are quite new out here.� Fritz waived
to his men so they would return to their base.

&nbsp;

Ivan
commanded the youngster to go in front of him. When they had walked for about
15 minutes, Boris took out his handgun. �Would you like to be part of the fun?�

&nbsp;

Fritz
nodded. Born in a small town with the name of Nunspeet,
he should have taken over his father�s tulip nursery, but he did poorly in
school. He actually did not like gardening. The only part about tulips at all
was the smell of the flowers. He was so good that he blindfolded could tell the
different sorts apart. Eventually he wanted to become a flavour expert, but his
poor academic performance stopped that. His younger sister made it. He hated
her for it. She left town after high school and he only met her a few times
after that.

&nbsp;

Bitter and
angry he joined the army and after some training, he ended up in Bosnia as part of the Dutch peacekeeping
force. However, he did not feel much for the people, he was supposed to
protect. He had, like most of his senior colleagues, been used to view the
Russians as the enemy. He wanted to protect his home, his country. Not some
far, remote and irrelevant county and the indifferent people living in it.

&nbsp;

Ivan told
the youngster that they have to wait for a truck to pick them up. In order to
prevent them from running, he would tie them with their hands on their back.
They became a little nervous but Fritz assured them that it was all right and
calmly they let Ivan tie them. His Dutch uniform made them relax.

&nbsp;

Ivan
ordered the down on their knees. When they all were in position, Boris went
behind the first of them and shot the youngster in his head. The other
youngsters began to scream. However, Boris was not distracted. As a machine he
shot another three before he stopped at the last surviving Muslim. �Should we
make a fountain?�

&nbsp;

They all
nodded.

&nbsp;

�Let me
try!� Fritz stepped forward.

&nbsp;

Fritz moved
behind the remaining captive. He positioned him head just behind the youngster.
Then he took a pause to enjoy the very little enjoyment, he had down here in Bosnia. He took a deep breath. Oh � he
could smell the fear. The mixed smell of sweat running down the youngster�s
body combined with the pee he had left in his pants. It was so good. This was
what he lived for: Smelling new flavours.

&nbsp;

�When are
you going to finish him? We have not all day.�

&nbsp;

�Just a
minute: I also want something from this experience.�

&nbsp;

Fritz took
out his knife. His next move must be precise or they would be cheated for the
sight of the fountain.

&nbsp;

�SCREAM.
Scream at loud as you can!� 

&nbsp;

But the
youngster was in shock. Fritz reached out and took his knife and made a cut at
the youngsters genital. It made him scream out. It was exactly the reaction,
Fritz wanted. Quickly he sliced the youngster throat and they all got the
result they wanted. Blood stood out from the youngster with a gurgling sound as
a fountain.

&nbsp;

�Nice work.
We have to go now. Do not mind the bodies. I would send some men over and burry
them.� Ivan and Boris left the scene joking and laughing. This safety area had
been so easy to capture. Ivan mentioned Tuzla and Boris�s eyes showed the fear at
once. When attacked a year ago the Danish troops had engaged in what the Danish
called operation �Hooligan Bashing�. In just one day they had lost about 150
men without the Danish side losing just one. It could have changed the course
of the war if the public had known the true number of casualties. They had to
bury their men in secret. 

&nbsp;

It took
almost a minute before the body of the youngster tipped over. Fritz maintained
his position just behind him until that moment. This was also a kind of
enjoyment. He could smell the blood. It had been quite an experience. He almost
got a hard-on.

&nbsp;

When he had
cleaned his knife, he stood for a moment shaking his head �Stupid people,
stupid county� and left.




Sarajevo August, 5 1995 �
A hunter becomes prey

&nbsp;

Ivan sat in
an apartment with his sniper riffle. He had been drinking all weekend and had a
headache. It would be nice with some simple targets before the column of truck
from the relief agency did pass. He looked carefully down on the street and saw
an elderly woman. She would have to do. He slowly positioned himself and aimed.


&nbsp;

Just as he
was ready to take hit shot, out of the corner of his eyes, he saw something
blinking at a rooftop of a building nearby. He stopped and looked up. Then he
felt himself being thrown across the room. For a moment, he was caught in
surprise. He had been hit in his arm. It hurt a lot. Just as he was going to
turn his head in order to inspect the damages he saw his arm lying on the floor
a meter from him.

&nbsp;

They had
shot his arm off!

&nbsp;

Slowly he
tried to stand up on his feet. It was the last thing, he remembered.

&nbsp;

---

&nbsp;

�Good
shoot.�

&nbsp;

Jensen was
excited. It was the first time he had shot and hit another human being.
Normally he only hunted ducks and deer but he had been approached by a former
Danish officer, who had offered him a one-in-a-lifetime chance to hunt the
most, difficult and intelligent animal to kill: Another human. It would cost
him, but Jensen did not care.

&nbsp;

He had paid
the amount and had been flown to Bosnia with false papers. Another Danish
officer had driven him into Sarajevo and had shown him up on the rooftop
where he had been handed the riffle. Even the target had been pointed out to
him. He just had to aim and push the trigger.

&nbsp;

First he
was nervous because they were out in the open. But asked why, they did not hide
in an apartment; the Danish officer said that the riffle was a powerful Barret MK II. It could kill a man from a distance of 800
 meters without problems, but when fired inside a building it would cause the
ceiling to fall down on the shooter.

&nbsp;

When he was
ready to shoot, the officer moved away saying that a safety distance of 5 meters had to be observed. Jensen�s first
shoot did not kill the sniper and he was both excited and a little bit scared.
Would the sniper fire back on him? Then for some inexplicable reason the Serb
sniper did make the mistake to stand up, which made it possible for Jensen to
have a second shot. It made the snipers head smash like a tomato. Jensen could
claim his kill. 

&nbsp;

For a
moment, he was almost on his way to stand up and dance out of enjoyment, but then
he remembered where he was. When he moved he also discovered that he had
nosebleed and his arm hurt. �What the fuck?�

&nbsp;

�Hurry!
We have to move fast. You were not hit. It is only the recoil.�

&nbsp;

Jensen took
the riffle and ran down to their car with the officer.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Sarajevo August, 6 1995 �
Good bye to a dear friend

&nbsp;

�Oh - My dear friend -Those bastards�. Boris was in rage. On the stretcher lay his
long-time friend Ivan or what remained of him. Most part of his head and some
parts of his upper parts were missing like a shell had struck him. Ivan did not
know who was responsible. He left the room accepting that he needed to get his
anger under control or he could end up dead if he in a hot-tempered mood
attracted some opponents, so he went to his new studio.

&nbsp;

He could
always whip the life out of some random peasant girl.




Sarajevo August 1, 1995 -
The studio

&nbsp;

Shortly
after the events in July, he, together with Ivan met with Fritz a last time
before Fritz had to return home to Holland. There was no demand for Dutch
troops after their failure to protect their safe area, so Fritz would be
stationed home just killing his time with one exercise after another.

&nbsp;

As Fritz
would have much spare time, he asked if they could set up a business together.
Boris and Ivan should make the product and Fritz should distribute it across Europe. Their business was the making of
snuff movies. It was an obvious choice because there were plenty of �actors� to
choose among.

&nbsp;

Together
they build the studio outside Sarajevo in a barn. Present at the making of
the first movie was beside the three of them, G�nter � a former mercenary �
that had helped Ivan from time to time and 5 young Bosnian woman.

&nbsp;

Take 1: Electrical
tit-torture

&nbsp;

The young
woman was dragged in the studio. G�nter and Fritz � both hooded - tore her
clothes of leaving her naked. They took her to some leather cuffs hanging down
from the ceiling and hoisted her leaving her feet just a few inches above the
ground. Fritz stopped for a moment smelling her fear. He put his head under arm
and inhaled her smell. Oh � it was so good.

&nbsp;

G�nter came
with some wired clamps. She cried out when he applied them on her tits. G�nter
took the control box and activated it. It was their first movie and at once her
body cramped and smoke started to rise from her tits. �Damn � the voltage is
too high.� G�nter stopped at once, but the damage had already been done. The
girl had passed out and hang limp in her restraints. They lowered her and took
her to their custom-made oak chair where they cuffed her.

&nbsp;

Then they
repeated the process with the next girl. When G�nter activated the power the
girl began to scream and she pissed herself. For some minutes they shocked her
and watched her squirm and then let her doze off for a minute or two before
applying the next shock. Then they paused before they applied a clamp at her
clit and inserted a wired metal butt plug.

&nbsp;

Take 2: Electrical all
over.

&nbsp;

Ivan took a
bottle of water and threw it at the poor woman. She woke and G�nter applied the
power in her lower region. Fritz had newer heard such a scream from a human as
she stiffened as result of the electrical power. They kept the power on for
almost a minute with the woman twisting and shaking. When they turned the power
off, Fritz went over to the woman to check whether she had died. She was still
alive barely breathing. Fritz took a deep breath. The mixture of her sweat,
piss and burnt flesh was new to him.

&nbsp;

He put his
gloves on and took the plug out. A stream of faeces ran down on the floor. She
had lost totally control of her body functions.

&nbsp;

He looked
at her face. She woke and stared with empty eyes at the crew. Fritz probed her cunt and found it quite wet. He then inserted a large metal
dildo and went back to his fried. �Start and increase the power a little every
15 seconds until she is dead.�

&nbsp;

G�nter
activated the control and once again she let out a cry and began to shake. Soon
the smell of burnt flesh filled the room and smoke was seen rising from the
woman�s clit. Her body trembled for the last time and they turned the current
off and waited for her body to cool down before G�nter checked her and
pronounced her dead.

&nbsp;

Take 3: Slow hanging 

&nbsp;

The first
girl had slowly regained consciousness and began to groan in the chair. 

&nbsp;

Fritz came
up with an idea. 

&nbsp;

�What about
hanging her instead of grilling her? It could also be fun.�

&nbsp;

�Good idea.
I would make the necessary preparations.�

&nbsp;

When they
were ready Fritz threw a bucket of water on the girl in order to wake her
completely. She began to cry out and Fritz took a gag-ball and inserted it in
her mouth. They released her from the chair a dragged her to the execution
spot. In order for her to have the right posture Fritz put an arm-binder on
her. It was very tight and forced her breast up. Tears were pouring down her cheeks
but Fritz continued his work.� He gave
her a leather belt on. Beside a belt that went round her waist, it had also a
strap going between her legs. Fritz took a butt-plug out of steel and
lubricated it before he pushed it inside her. It made her attempt to cry out
but the gag prevented it.

&nbsp;

Finally he
forced a steel dildo in her vagina before he tightened the belt. Fritz
connected a D-ring at the end of the arm binder to a similar D-ring in the belt
forcing her to stand up strait. G�nter attached wires to both the plug and the
dildo, which he connected to his control panel. At the end Ivan came into the
studio with a wine barrel. 

&nbsp;

Together
they supported her to stand on the barrel and put a noose around her neck. Ivan
hoisted the rope so she stood on her tiptoes on the barrel.

&nbsp;

�OK here is
the game. If you succeed in standing on the barrel for 5 minutes without making
it rolling away from your, we will let you go. If not and the barrel rolls away
from your feet, you will hang and strangle.�

&nbsp;

They moved away
and Ivan said �Action.�

&nbsp;

The poor
girl did the best to maintain balance. They could see sweat coming from her
forehead. It ran in her eyes, which were very irritating for her. Fritz took a
feather and went over to her and touched her breast causing her to work hard to
maintain balance.

&nbsp;

Fritz was
doing his best to make her fall, but she was very concentrated and managed to
keep her balance. Four minutes had passed. Only one minute to go and the girl
would be free to walk. Then G�nter activated his ace � control panel. He
applied an electrical shock to the butt plug causing her to jump. By pure luck
she managed to land on the barrel. �She is going to get difficult,� he thought.

&nbsp;

�Plleee!!!� She tried to plead for her life, but the gag
made her message unintelligible.

&nbsp;

But when he
applied a shock to the dildo, she lost balance. Her eyes opened wide with
horror and she started twisting around with a gurgling sound. Her legs went I
direction of the barrel just it was out reached and rolled further away from her.
Then she began to make her final dance. Her legs went wild and at the same time
a purple colour began to show in her face.

&nbsp;

With a
painful look in her face her pace began to slow down. When she was almost
unconscious, she peed on the floor. In the end only a quivering were seen at
her body.

&nbsp;

During the
entire take Boris had sat in the corner smoking a cigar. When it was clear that
there were no life left in the girl, Boris went over and put out his cigar on
her bare skin with hissed sound just because he wanted to be 100 percent
certain that she was a goner. Fritz also came over. He just had to smell the
flavour of the burnt flesh.

&nbsp;

Dinner and relaxation

&nbsp;

�It was
hard work. I never thought it would be so hard to make a movie. Let�s have some
lunch!�

&nbsp;

They all
sat down and dined. �What about the other girls?�

&nbsp;

�What you
don�t achieve today, you do tomorrow!�

&nbsp;

�I have to
report to my station tomorrow and I do not know when I am send back home.�
Fritz was worried. His time in Bosnia had been so rewarding. He had
developed as a person. No one would ever trust Dutch soldiers to guard anyone
in the future after Srebrenica. The prospect of
spending the rest of his life back home in barracks, was not the kind of future
he wanted for him self.

&nbsp;

After dinner Fritz put a
collar on one the girls and took her up to his bedroom. He connected the leash
on the collar to the bed frame and commanded her to give him some massage and
she did.

&nbsp;

�Could you not spare my
life? I would serve you forever.�

&nbsp;

�Are you sure? You don�t
know anything about my demands. I can be very demanding.�

&nbsp;

�I would do anything.�

&nbsp;

�Anything??�

&nbsp;

�Anything!!�

&nbsp;

Fritz looked the girl over.
Just under 6� feet. Trim body. Dark hair. She could be something
to work with.

&nbsp;

�Let�s sleep together. Then
I would decide.�

&nbsp;

They went into bed. First
she let her tongue lick his scrotum; then she continued by giving him a
blowjob. He thanked her and cuffed her hands at her back, so she would not
escape and went to sleep.

&nbsp;

During the night he woke by
her licking his member. He released her and took from behind. When he came, he
thanked her and cuffed her once more. He had made his mind up. She would be
nice to have around at the farm. He knew his day in the army was numbered. He
had to move on in life.




Sarajevo August 2, 1995 �
New staff at the farm

&nbsp;

In the morning he looked at
the beautiful girl next to him. She would do nicely back in the Netherland. Some months before, he had received bad news
from his mother. His father had been ill for some time and had passed away.
Even though, he had not visited them a lot, he knew that he had to take over
the tulip-farm, because the market for farm like his parents was not good. He
hated gardening, but with a little bit of help, it could be bearable.

&nbsp;

When she woke, he asked her
�What is your name?�

&nbsp;

�Lisa!�

&nbsp;

�Do you have family?�

&nbsp;

�I don�t know what happen
to most of my family, but my two twin-sisters are still in the basement. We
were five girls from our villages until last evening, when you took two of us.
What happened to them? I heard them screaming.�

&nbsp;

�I would not lie to you.
They were used as sex toys. I do not know where they now.� Of course, he knew.
But if he did not tell the truth, she would be more manageable. His greatest
problem would be convincing his mates.

&nbsp;

Still cuffed, he left her
at the bed and went to Boris and explained his situation. �You can just capture
some new ones. I feel that I can make good use of her and her sisters back at
the farm. You have to take into consideration that we cannot duplicate the master-tape
here and just ship videos out over the world. This country is still under U.N.
Embargo. If I set up the duplication process in the Netherland,
it is just the master-tapes, we have to smuggle out of Bosnia. By doing so, I would need people, which cannot tell
the police anything. If take these girls with me and provide them with a false
identity, they could not go to the police, because they would be sent back to
here without a future. The Dutch authorities are very strict about these
things. Whatever their destiny would be, they would be sent out of the Netherlands.�

&nbsp;

�I would think about it.�
Boris sat for a while. Then he pronounced: �It is OK. But you have to kill
them, it something goes wrong down here. I would no leave any witnesses. Can
you manage this?�

&nbsp;

�Is my name Fritz?� They
had an agreement.

&nbsp;




Nunspeet August 15,
 1995 � A
plant is set up.

&nbsp;

Upon arrival in the Netherland, Fritz did not waste time. He handed his
resignation also as soon his feet touched the ground. None thought it was
strange. The massacre was very shamefaced for the Netherland
as a country. It would be a dark spot in the country�s history books.

&nbsp;

His mother
moved from the farm and a week later a truck came by driven by G�nter. The
three girls were cuffed and gagged in the trunk. They were very thirsty. Ann
and her two sisters Betty and Julia were locked in a storeroom where he had
installed water, a toilet and kitchen facilities. They have to eat and sleep in
there naked.

&nbsp;

After the
girl had been locked away, G�nter told him about the death of Ivan. Fritz was
very sad but knew that it was an occupational hazard. They decided to go into
town and buy some food and wine so they could have a formal dinner in the
memory of their deer friend.

&nbsp;

Back at the
farm, they ordered Ann out and prepare the meal for them. Ann had some
knowledge about work in the kitchen because she had helped her mother back
home, so the steak was not so bad.

&nbsp;

�You are
lucky to have such a good staff. They just have to be broken in. Are you sure
that you are the man for it.�

&nbsp;

�Well, the
twins are only 15, so properly would spare them for later. But Ann would be at
my service at all times, when I choose so. Just to be to the safe side, I would
buy two chastity belts for the twins, so they would be mine, when Ann is worn
out.�

&nbsp;

The next
morning G�nter left for Bosnia and in a couple of weeks a daily
routine appeared.

&nbsp;

Ann would
sleep in his bed most of the nights wearing a collar. Whenever he couldn�t
sleep, he took her and every morning during the winter, she had to drink his
morning urine if he did not feel like leaving the bed early. Most of the days,
he finally left his bed about 9 a.m.

&nbsp;

After Ann
was fitted with cuffs at her feet and wrist, which were connected chains she
would start making breakfast. Then he went out to the storeroom, where the
twins slept. He handed them some panties and boiler suits and cuffed them like
Ann.� 

&nbsp;

Together they ate and while
Ann remained in the house, the two twins had to work at the farm and in the
small plant in the basement, where he edited the raw film sent to him from Bosnia. Once finished editing, the sisters handled the
duplication machinery and made copies and packed them to shops all over Europe.

&nbsp;

The sisters also had to
work around the farm. Most of the days, they ended up in the kitchen about 8 p.m. where they had dinner. When they were finished, the
twins were ordered out to the storeroom and told to undress, before he locked
them up. Ann would be tied to his bed and they would start over the next day.

&nbsp;

Two weeks after their
arrival, Fritz suddenly realized that they newer spoke. He went to Ann and
asked her why they were dump.

&nbsp;

�When the soldiers entered
our home, our parents were shot and we were all gang-banged in every hole, we
have. Then even forced us to clean their dicks with our mouth
after they had satisfied themselves in our end.� My sisters were only 14 years at that time,
and they stopped to talk on that very day.�

&nbsp;

Fritz was not exactly
surprise and in a way it did not worsen his situation. If by accident, some
passer-by would try to talk to them, they would not be able to sneak.




Mount Vis September
 10, 1995 �
Red wine and Boris�s demise

&nbsp;

In a bunker on the side of
the mountain, Boris and his men were about to drink a toast for their next
attack. Since the unfortunate death of Ivan, Boris wanted to revenge his death.
So he joined his men at the end of august in order to attach the Danish safe
zone at Tuzla. They had used mortars at several attacks. In a single attack they were
able to kill 37 people. But some U.N. public officer far away from Bosnia controlled the Danes, so the Danes could not strike
back.

&nbsp;

One of his men came with a
bottle of red wine. �I could not find any champagne, so we have to settle with
these bottles. However, the owner told me himself that it is a good quality
just before I shot him.�

&nbsp;

�OK, that is fine. Bring in
the men and we should toast on the death of our enemies.�

&nbsp;

His men came into the
bunker and they all toasted for their good fortune in the upcoming battle.

&nbsp;

Boris heard some gunfire
and went over to look out of the gun skit. It was just some machineguns down in
the valley. Just as he held his glass up to in order to drink from it, he
discover something trough the glass.

&nbsp;

He held his glass up in the
front of his eyes. It was some ray of light coming from a hill nearby. �What is
that?� Then he heard an airplane and realized.

&nbsp;

�LEAVE THE BUNKER NOW! GO-GO-GO!!�

&nbsp;

His men looked at him like
he was crazy.

&nbsp;

�They have locked a laser
target marker on this bunker. We would die if we don�t run now.�

&nbsp;

Panicked, they all ran for
the exit, but it was small and only one man could pass at the time. Only two of
the soldiers managed to leave the bunker before the first Harrier dropped its
bombs. Boris died at once together with most of his men.

&nbsp;

One of the escaping
soldiers managed to fire a missile against the second Harrier, but it did not
hit. He was killed off when the third plane - a F16 � fired its missiles
against his position.

&nbsp;

Across the valley, a Danish
officer was very satisfied. Very different planes from various countries had
wiped the entire top of the mountain out. Operation �Sugarbowl�
was a success.




Nunspeet October 4, 1995 � Depression and
the Stockholm syndrome

&nbsp;

Fritz was
sitting at his table in the kitchen. 10 empty beer cans were lying at the
floor.

&nbsp;

�Damn! It
is not fair. What shall be of me? It can not be true.�

&nbsp;

He had been
expecting a new movie from Boris and G�nter, but instead of some videotape, he
had received a letter from G�nter telling him about the death of Boris. Boris
had been his mate almost since his first day in Bosnia. It was Boris that should arrange
for the recording of the snuff movies. He should take prisoners among the girls
and use them in the movies. Now he was dead and as if it was not bad enough
everyone talked about peace in Bosnia.

&nbsp;

G�nter
couldn�t continue alone and it was not his intention according to the letter.
He had already left Bosnia in order to seek new adventure
another place on the planet.

&nbsp;

It was a
catastrophe for Fritz. The duplication equipment had set him thousand of
dollars back. The first movie had sold well, but without new movies in the
future it very limited how many videotapes there was demand for. He could lose
his farm

&nbsp;

For days he sat and drank
one beer after another. He had lost interest in Ann and the twins. But even if
he had left her and her sisters going around without chains they did not try to
escape. Finally one evening, when he lay in his bed drunk and dirty with puke
down his shirt and wet trousers after having wetted himself, they all three
came in. 

&nbsp;

They lifted out of his bed
and dragged him to a prepared bath, where they washed him while his was
half-unconscious and shaved him too. After bathing him, they dried him and
dragged him to the kitchen where they served him one cup of black coffee after
another.

&nbsp;

When he finally was
himself, he was a little surprised by their act. �Why did you help me? Why
didn�t you run away?�

&nbsp;

�Where should I go? Our
family is properly gone? Our house was destroyed and even though you have
cuffed us, you have not whipped us or raped us. You have been nice to us. We do
not want to leave.�

&nbsp;

It was a light in the ocean
for Fritz. Now he could avoid fulfilling his promise to Boris about killing the
girls when the operation stopped. Not that is matters. The only persons, who
could be hurt if they went to the police was G�nter and himself. Everybody else
was dead.

&nbsp;

So things changed around
the farm. He managed to sell the duplication equipment and they just turned all
their activities into cultivate new kinds of tulips. The money situation was
tight, but for some time, they could exist until Fritz would come on to another
source of income. Ann still shared bed with Fritz, but she was no longer cuffed
and collared. The twin also moved from the storeroom to the house and they were
hard workers in their silenced way.

Amsterdam March 2001 � Fritz�s new work.

&nbsp;

It has been some years
since we visited the farm. What have happen since?

&nbsp;

Ann learned Dutch and it
turned out that she had a talent for accounting. So she ran the books at the
farm. They were still low on cash. After some years, it was clear that the farm
needed more income so Fritz had to get a job.

&nbsp;

There were not many jobs
for a former soldier, but one day he received a letter from G�nter. He had
opened a boarding school for American teenagers and he needed help. G�nter was
so sure that Fritz would help him that he even had send a plane ticket along
for Jamaica. Ann said that she could
manage the farm for some months and Fritz left the next week.

&nbsp;

Fritz flew to Miami and from there to Kingston, where G�nter greeted him. While they drove to the school, Fritz asked
what kind of school, it was.

&nbsp;

�It is a school for
troubled teenagers. When the war was over, I needed to lie low for some time
and Joe had a house here, where I could spend some time.�

&nbsp;

�Across the some Mormons
had created a similar boarding school and I bribed one of the local so-called
qualified staff-members and found out that the students were treated even worse
than our victims back in Bosnia.�

&nbsp;

�They use some kind of
grade level system and for the students count that even the right to raise once
look from the floor and look a teacher in the eyes is something that the
student had to earn. Most of the students lie on the floor on their stomach for
all day for weeks � sometime even months. Their food was uneatable, there were
maggots in it, and the water was certainly not clean.�

&nbsp;

Fritz was shocked. �That�s
sound horrible.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, but the best part is
that the parents don�t care. They pay up from 25.000 to 40.000 $ per year just
to get rid of their own kids for up to 5 years.�

&nbsp;

Fritz dropped his jaw �What
kind of parents are we talking of?�

&nbsp;

�As we have discovered, it
is just ordinary middleclass American people in a double income society. It is
not like they come from a special part of the states. The Mormons does only
have one problem. That is that they trick some of the more na�ve parents into
the illusion that their kids are educated.�

&nbsp;

�Is it not a school?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, but they have created
a scam association in Idaho that accredits the
diplomas. There is no real education going on there.�

&nbsp;

�So you decided to go into
the business?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, and I have done a bad
thing or two in my time. But cheat parents and batter the children just for
money is not my style. In our school we give the children real education, so
they are able to go on in life.�

&nbsp;

�But would the children not
be better of going to school at home?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, they would. But their
parents have so many things of their own going on in life, so they have no
surplus so they can understand the modern world, their children live in. They
just want to escape from their responsibility and all the worries having a
teenager in their home could create.�

&nbsp;

�You called it a boarding
school for troubled teens. Don�t they have some special problems like drugs,
alcohol or unprotected sex?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, about 25 percent has
problems with drugs. The rest of them have acted out like normal teenagers. We
have been teenagers ourselves and don�t you remember how it was?�

&nbsp;

�I had my share of booze
and women.�

&nbsp;

�As I see it we are doing
those parents a favour. We would see to that that the teenagers don�t get
tempted by drugs, alcohol and the other sex. We will protect them from all the
temptations normal teenagers are up against. We offer them a structured
environment where they can focus on their studies and work with themselves
towards adulthood. And when they are either 18 or 21, they would be ready to go
on to college.� 

&nbsp;

�How do you prevent them
from doing normal things and what is my job?�

&nbsp;

�You will soon discover
what kind of precautions, we have taken and your future job is being a teen
escort.�

&nbsp;

�What does that job consist
of?�

&nbsp;

�Going to the teens home
and bring them to the school. It sounds simple and it sometime is. But some
time the children are not informed by their parents that they are going to
attend school here and means use of force. There is the school.�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;




Black River, Jamaica September 2001 � The boarding
school.

&nbsp;

When they came to the gates
of the school, G�nter greeted a guard so he could open the gate. A wall, which
was eight feet tall, surrounded the campus and the only exit besides the gate
was the ocean.

&nbsp;

When car was parked in a
secured garage, they got out in the yard. Then it was that Fritz saw a student
and the sight was with an easy word bizarre.

&nbsp;

The student had a corset
looking outfit on that reached down just above his knees. He was barefooted and
had leg-irons on. Around his waist he had a leather belt with chains going to
some cuffs on his wrist. 

&nbsp;

It was only as they
approached the students, that Fritz saw that the student was � a boy.

&nbsp;

�Why do you have a boy
wearing a corset?�

&nbsp;

�Because the corset causes
their lungs to be compressed, so they can�t run very fast. Look at the neck
part. It is very rigid so they also have to keep their posture straight.�

&nbsp;

�Is corset mandatory for
all students?�

&nbsp;

�Yes. That is the only type
of force used here to maintain discipline. New students are put in a discipline
corset and restrained, when they arrived. In fact, we have a new student
waiting in a holding cell. You can take part in fitting her in her new school
uniform. Meet me at the lacing room. Just follow the signs.�

&nbsp;

Fritz placed his luggage in
his room and went to a lacing room. In the room a 15-year-old clearly angry
girl was hanging naked in her suspension cuffs and she was stretched out
because her feet were bound in similar leather cuffs.

&nbsp;

�Let me loose. I will tell
my parents. They will sue you for all you got. This is not fair!�

&nbsp;

G�nter replied �What a
temper. I have to introduce myself. I am the head master here at Meditation Inlet
where you are going to study until you are 18. It is a school of your parent�s
choice. They know that this is a school with a Victorian age theme where purity
is in seat of honour. Your parents told me you has been with boy and have
participated in drinking alcohol. So in order to save you from going down the
toilet, they have placed you here. Accept it sooner than later.� 

&nbsp;

�Oh my god - It can not be
true. They couldn�t.�

&nbsp;

�Yes they have. You have to
earn their trust again by studying hard and learn how to obey house rules. If
you do well, perhaps you will go back before you are 18. But for now, you are
going to be put in your uniform.�

&nbsp;

G�nter took out some stiff
canvas. �You will be wearing this.�

&nbsp;

�What is that? Are you
sick? I am not going to wear something from a horror movie.�

&nbsp;

�That is not for you to
decide. It would improve your stooped-over posture and make you behave like a
lady. Give me a hand, Fritz!�

&nbsp;

They started to lace the
corset. The girl cried and yielded but eventually she lost her air and when the
corset was almost entirely laced she could only manage to produce small grunts
when they tugged at the laces. Once finished they lowered her to the ground and
when her feet were on the ground G�nter buckled the shoulder straps on the
corset in place causing her shoulder to be pulled back. It seemed that it was
somehow a little painful as she made a wry face.

&nbsp;

�Now for the waist belt: We
buckle it on their back and place their wrist in leather cuffs which is chained
to the waist belt. Their feet are also placed in cuffs with a 20 centimetres chain between them so they can walk but not run. We
have promised their parents that sex must not take place the corset has a thick
leather flap going between their legs, just in case so they can not abuse
themselves when we are not watching.�

&nbsp;

The girl almost stumbled
when he took the flap and pulled it between her legs and fastened it on the
back of the corset. The girl was now broken and just looking down in the
ground.

&nbsp;

�And now to the difference
between our boarding school and the Mormon nightmare across the bay: Our
students shall keep their heads up.�

&nbsp;

He took out a strange
thing. It was a neck corset made of leather. He laced it on the girl, which
forced her head up. She looked straight but Fritz could see in her eyes that
her spirit was gone. They had created something looking like a human but acting
like a robot. G�nter called a guard.

&nbsp;

�Take her to her room.
Remember to put gloves on her so she doesn�t tamper with her laces during the
night.�

&nbsp;

G�nter and Fritz went back
to his office where they ate dinner before Fritz went back to his room in order
to sleep.
Black River, Jamaica September 2001 � A typically school day

&nbsp;

The morning at about 6 a.m. he woke and ate some breakfast in the kitchen. 30
minutes later he helped the staff getting the students up.

&nbsp;

The students had to be
helped to the toilet because the strap prevented them from using the toilet on
their own. When he asked one of the staff what would have happen if the students
needed to go to the toilet often, the reply was: �They have to plan ahead or
use a diaper.�

&nbsp;

The student had 30 minutes
to eat breakfast. The breakfast consisted of soup. Fritz tasted it and it was
good. �Why are they having soup for breakfast?�

&nbsp;

�Most of the teenagers
needs to loose weight in order to achieve an attractive body. In fact all their
meals are soup. It contains fresh vegetable and the finest meat we can buy
here. No maggots here.�

&nbsp;

Oddly there were about 300
students in the dinning hall and no one spoke. They seemed very concentrated.

&nbsp;

�Don�t you have trouble
makers from time to time?�

&nbsp;

�Yes and we have some
special discipline corsets with an electrical unit built in it. Those students
would receive a shock of two second, which would send them to the ground. We
also use isolation hoods. But for most students being corseted is doing the
job.�

&nbsp;

A clock sounded and the
students went to their classes. �What kind of stuff are they studying?�

&nbsp;

�They study normal high
school things. They have monitored Internet access. We approve every site they
want access to. However, all email must be read by our staff before its leave
this facility. Our firewall prevents the use of web-mail and only mails that it
necessary for the studies and a single email every week to the parents are
allowed. Not even email to other family members is allowed unless the parents
pass them on.�

&nbsp;

They looked into a
classroom. It did not look like an ordinary classroom, more like an office with
cubicles for every student. G�nter could see the question coming and he replied
in advance. �It is not a chat club. There is no reason for them to talk with
each other.�

&nbsp;

Suddenly they heard some
noise down the hall. One of the guards dragged a boy out. When G�nter asked
what the problem was, the guard explained that he could see that the student
was sweating a lot and noticed a small bulge at the leather flap between the
legs. It was clear that the student had become aroused for some reason, and he
needed to get a relief.

&nbsp;

G�nter helped the guard and
they dragged the boy down to a male relief room. Inside there was a special
contraption. It was a massage bed with a hole to the head of the student, but
also with a second hole just where the genitals would be when the students were
placed on the bed on his stomach.

&nbsp;

The boy was placed on the
bed and the leather strap between his legs was removed. Several wide leather
straps secured his body to the bed and a last strap went over his head, so he
was lying with his face looking through the hole down on the floor.

&nbsp;

When they removed the
leather strap, they saw that they were right. The boy was aroused and his penis
was very stiff and pre-cum was floating from it. The guard flipped the bed so
the boy was now placed vertical instead of horizontal.

&nbsp;

The guard came with some
small leather item. It was a ball stretcher. �We are going to teach you that
ejaculation is only allowed Saturday morning. All other time you must maintain
self-control. 

&nbsp;

The guard put the ball
stretcher on. It consisted of a leather part with was wrapped about the base of
the scrotum making the ball being displayed very clearly and the tight scrotum
was also must purple. The boy groaned when the stretcher was tightened. There
were two other straps one went around the base of the penis and another worked
as a ball divider. The boy was in pain but his ordeal increased as the guard
attached a weight so his scrotum was pulled down.

&nbsp;

�No. Please stop. I can not
take the pain.� He whined.

&nbsp;

�Your parents were too
tired of you abusing your self every day. They had found leftovers from your
semen all over your room. They have sent you here so you can be content with
jacking it off once a week.�

&nbsp;

�It hurts. Please. I would
behave.�

&nbsp;

�Do you promise to control
you self until Saturday? Then we will grant you relief and you will get off
with 3 hours in an isolation hood so you can your thoughts together.�

&nbsp;

�I promise.�

&nbsp;

The guard took an aneros
and lubricated it before he inserted it in the student�s rectum. Wearing a
latex glove he also gave the student a hand job. The boy began to tremble and
he came with a small cry. The guard continued to massage until the last drop
was milked.

&nbsp;

Then they released the
student from the bed and buckled the leather flap back on. They took the
student to a chair where they secured him to the chair. The guard came with a
leather helmet. Once they had put it on the student�s head they laced it tight.
The only opening in the hood was for the nose. 

&nbsp;

�Now he can not hear us and
he would stay here for 3 hours.�

&nbsp;

�What is the longest a
student has sat here?�

&nbsp;

�20 x 8 hours with a 1 hour
break so they can eat and drink. When they are confined to the chair for such a
long time, we wheel the chair over a toilet and remove the leather strap so
they can use the toilet whenever they need. They even sleep in the chair. Trust
me, they behave in the future.�

&nbsp;

They continued their walk
around the campus. Between the palms they saw a group of students that rested
on sun lounges with earplugs obvious hearing some music. �What are they doing?�

&nbsp;

�That is level 4 students.
They rest for two hours before they continue to study. They are almost ready to
leave. Opposite students on the other levels they have no chores. It is not
actually music they hear. It is only the sounds of waves. We do not allow any
kind of music. According to our client � the parents - music is the root of all
evil and promotes intake of alcohol and drugs.�

&nbsp;

�For how long do they study
every day?�

&nbsp;

�10 hours every day at
level 4. All the other levels study less. However, they don�t waste the day.
Students on level one or in mistrust spend a half the with the isolation hood.
The other levels have chores enabling us to run this place in a proper manner.�

&nbsp;

About 6 p.m. the students ate dinner and went back for 3 hours of
study before it was time to sleep. Television was not allowed, but during
weekend the students were allowed to watch Disney and Teletubbies movies. News
was available on an intranet site, where the staff selected what kind of news
the students could read.




Oxnard, California December
2001 � Picking up Jack 

&nbsp;

Fritz was in a company car
with John � one of the staff members. 

&nbsp;

A worried mother had called
Meditation Inlet
because her 16-year-old son�s grade had dropped and he had begun to argue with
her. She had found out that he dated a girlfriend living at a trailer park. It
was not a girl from the social standard; the son had grown up in. The mother
did not want a son around that could endanger her family from keeping up
appearances.

&nbsp;

It was about four a.m. in the morning, when their car pulled up in the
driveway of their client. The worried mother greeted them silently and they sat
down in her living room and spoke about what was suppose to happen.

&nbsp;

�Does he have some weapon
up in his room?�

&nbsp;

�No. We don�t have weapons
in this house. I don�t know about his trash girl friend. But I searched his
room yesterday and he did come home alone, so you should be safe.�

&nbsp;

�Does he suspect you of
doing this?�

&nbsp;

�No. He is so in love with
the tart that he has no eye for anything else and that is the sole problem. He
doesn�t care for school either.�

&nbsp;

�Did you read our manual?�

&nbsp;

�Yes. I introduce you and
leave the house until you have driven off.�

&nbsp;

�Shall we proceed then?�

&nbsp;

�I just have one question.
You don�t use maze or something like that? One of my neighbours had a teen
escort service using pepper spray and it stuck in the wallpaper so she had to
have a paintjob.�

&nbsp;

�No. We use a stun baton,
but only when things get tough.�

&nbsp;

�Oh. That is a relief.
Let�s go then.�

&nbsp;

They went to the child�s
room where the mother woke the child.

&nbsp;

�Jack. Waky.Waky.�

&nbsp;

The very sleepy teenager
woke up and starred in disbelief on the two men in his room.

&nbsp;

�Jack. These two gentlemen
are here to take you to a boarding school of my choice. I want the best for you
and I want you to go with them. Now I have to go to work. Bye. See you later.�

&nbsp;

She kissed him on his
forehead and left.

&nbsp;

�Jack. Please stand up. We
want you to understand that our job is to take you to the school � not to argue
whether you are going. We are ready to use every force necessary so just
undress and place your hands on your back.�

&nbsp;

The boy slowly did what he
was told. When he was finished John moved behind him. Very fast wrapped a
leather piece around the forearms on the boy and fastened leather straps to two
leather cuffs on the upper part of the arms. The boy was now unable to use his
arms. He started to protest when John pulled an isolation hood over his head.
Fritz joined in holding him still. John put a diaper on the boy and each took
the boy under his arms virtually carrying to the car. They strapped him with a
custom-made 4-point seat belt and went to the airport where a private plane
waited for them.

&nbsp;

Well arrived in Jamaica, they drove on to the school. Jack was still in
restraints and the transport version of the isolation hood had a detachable
mouthpiece so they could give Jack something to drink and eat. Of course he had
a lot of questions but the policy was not to inform the students of their
destination before they were hooked up to the lacing bar.

&nbsp;

Once on the school they
unbuckled the restraint and placed cuffs on his wrist and feet so they could
hoist him in the lacing bar. When his body was almost stretched entire out, he
wailed from the pain. 

&nbsp;

Jack removed the isolation hood
and gave him the welcome speech. When he showed him the uniformed him
complained at once. �That is girls wear. You can not have me wearing that.� He
cried. Jack was not a man of many words. He quickly wrapped the fabric around
the boy�s waist and began to tug. The boy yielded and tried to pull the
restraints, but the result was certain. Yields became groans and the groans
ended up in small grunts whenever Jack pulled the laced. He placed his foot on
the boy�s back and pulled the laced to tight that they had to use smelling salt
when Jack passed out two or three times during the process.

&nbsp;

Again it was a broken
student they could lower to the floor.

&nbsp;

When he was fully placed in
restraints they took him to the room with isolation hoods. He was placed in a chair
on a 5 x 8 hour isolation period, which was mandatory for reluctant students.

&nbsp;

��Another job well done.�

&nbsp;




&nbsp;

Black River, Jamaica may 2002 � Exit plan

&nbsp;

Fritz was worried. Paula
was an 18-year-old girl, which had been placed at the school for 8 months ago.
Her parents had a divorce and as a result of the broken up home their normally
overachieving daughter had begun to date boyfriend and having sex.

&nbsp;

So she was sent to Meditation Inlet,
but her treatment was not finished when she turned 18 and according to the law
they could not held her here if she did not want it herself. Paula entered the
office.

&nbsp;

Fritz started: �You are
here because I first of all want you to congratulate you with your birthday and
secondary because we are going to offer you a voluntary treatment plan until
you are 21.�

&nbsp;

�Forget it. I want to go
home. Put me on a plane and I am out of here.�

&nbsp;

�Of course. If it is what you want. However.
Your parents would not receive you. You will get 50 dollars, your passport and
a plane ticket to Miami. From there you can
go where ever you decide.�

&nbsp;

�What. But I live in Monterey, California. How am I going to ride home from Florida to California?�

&nbsp;

�That is your problem. And
I also have to inform you that your parents would not pay for any further education
if you decide to leave this school now.�

&nbsp;

�That is blackmail! Forget
it. I am going anyway.� 

&nbsp;

�Fine. Leave the office. We will meet here so you can get
some clothes so you can travel.�

&nbsp;

The next morning they stood
in the office. Paula was naked and she was noticeable weakened because her body
was not used to go without a corset.

&nbsp;

Here are your clothes for
your journey. If you remember how you were brought here, you did not have a lot
of clothes with you, so I have convinced your parents to sponsor a suit out of
pure kindness.

&nbsp;

�I can not travel like
that. People would think that I am a hooker.�

&nbsp;

�That is the only clothes
we are able to buy from our supplier at the present time.�

&nbsp;

�I just want to go, so I
have no choice I guess.�

&nbsp;

�Well. It is your choice.
Here is the plane ticket and your money. Dress into your clothes. I will send
in a female guard to help you with the corset.�

&nbsp;

When he returned 10 minutes
later, Paula was finished and stud in her new clothes. She wore a red PVC
corset and had net stockings with 6-inch high heels. Besides that she only had
a black PVC jacket. She looked like a tart. No one would hire her looking like
that. She would be living in the streets or at a shelter for the homeless.
Fritz handed her a small handbag. 

&nbsp;

�Here this is for your
plane ticket and money. You will also find a calling card with a number you can
call anytime, if you rethink your decision. Before you go, I also have a phone
call for you.�

&nbsp;

He pushed a bottom on the
phone and Paula heard a familiar voice. It was her father.

&nbsp;

�Hey! Pumpkin.
I just want to bid farewell to my daughter before I loose her. I know bye my
heart that we won�t be seeing each other any more. Your brother also has a word
to say to you.�

&nbsp;

Her brother was crying
sounding as he was very convinced that his sister now was about to die. Finally
an obvious tear-wetted mother said farewell to her once bellowed daughter. In
his mind Fritz send a grateful thought to the parent�s manual and some of the
courses the school held in the state. Paula was emotional touched by the
phone-call and Fritz knew that they had successfully planted a little doubt in
her mind.

&nbsp;

Paula left the office with
tears running down her chins. He saw her taxi go off for the airport. How many
days would it be before she called in and wanted back?

&nbsp;




Black River, Jamaica October 2002 � Delivery problem

&nbsp;

Fritz was summoned to
G�nter�s office where a very worried manager greeted him.

&nbsp;

�What is the problem?�

&nbsp;

�We had a power failure
yesterday and our uninterruptible power supply did not work as intended. We
lost our supplies of this month semen.�

&nbsp;

�I did not know that we
kept semen. What purpose serves the semen supply?�

&nbsp;

�I have not told you about
it. We are a subcontractor to one of the largest sperm banks in the states. Of
course no one knows from where we get the semen. When a new student enters the
school, we test him for all kind of sickness. If the tests are good, all the
semen collected during the mandatory masturbation session on Saturdays would be
stored here and send to the states every month.�

&nbsp;

�And the school earns extra
money!�

&nbsp;

�Yes. The best of the all
is that no one is hurt. Long-term denial at males means a higher risk of
prostate cancer, so it is good for the boys. A lot of people up in the states
can�t have a baby of their own. Those people we help too. But of course it is a
secret because it could look wrong in the eyes of our customers � the parents.�

&nbsp;

�It is always nice to know
that we help out with making this world a better place to live. But how can we
produce almost a whole month production?�

&nbsp;

�We have to milk the boys
every day.�

&nbsp;

�Would it not be
unhealthy?�

&nbsp;

�Not if we care extra for
them regarding food intake, minerals and vitamins.�

&nbsp;

�Let�s go then!�

&nbsp;

The first
three boys were led into the �cow-stable�, as the milking room was named and
fastened on some gynaecology treatment tables. Ones
they had straps strapped around their body and their feet were bound in the
stirrups, a nurse carefully removed the leather flap covering his genitals and
teased his scrotum so the penis became erect. It was never a problem with these
kids.

&nbsp;

Being
the victim for long-term denial meant that they were so sensitive towards every
touch to those areas of their body. Also the fact that most of them were hardly
experienced in sexual activities combined with the rather strange and bizarre
surroundings, contributed by making them being on their toes. The sensation in
their young bodies was for most of them a new strange feeling they did not know
how to handle.

&nbsp;

As
soon as the pre-cum was visible a special masturbator were force on them. It
was transparent so the staff could see when they have milked the boy. In order
to increase their senses an isolation hood were pulled over their heads.

&nbsp;

Now
they were ready. The masturbators were started and it caused a visible reaction
by the boys. Their bodies tensed up and the nurse checked the restraints. Of
course there was no problem. After a minute the first boy came and the nurse
checked every table helping a little with her hand. 

The
whole process had not taken more than 5 minutes and normally the next step was
to release the first set of boys and send in the next team, but due to the
shortage of semen, every team was to be milked twice.

&nbsp;

It
was obvious that it was more difficult for the nurse to ensure the erection the
second time. She had to use a cock ring on two of the boys. Once prepared, the
process started over again. This time sobbing sounds were heard from inside the
hoods and the nurse knew that she had to be careful when she massaged the
scrotums because they were tender.

&nbsp;

The
second batch was released from two of the boys but the last one had
difficulties. The nurse lubricated the prostate massager and inserted it
gently. She was very skilled and after 30 seconds the last boy reached his
climax.

&nbsp;

The
boys were cleaned and when the leather flap was in place, they were released.
They had to be supported and were visible weakened. None of them dared to ask
why they were milked twice. As it the rules in Meditation Inlet stated talking to the
staff was only allowed when a student was addressed.

&nbsp;

It
took the rest of the afternoon to milk all the boys and during the entire week
every boy was milked twice.

&nbsp;

At the end of the week most of the boys
were so emotional worn down, that they cried when the staff came to take them
to the �cow-stable�.

&nbsp;

On Friday one of the boys
panicked when he entered the �cow-stable� and passed out. Nevertheless, they
milked him while he was unconscious.

&nbsp;

Fritz was rolling the boy
out on a stretcher while he was conversing with the nurse.

&nbsp;

�Are we close at the
target?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, we have reached the
normal volume; we would normally produce during a month.�

&nbsp;

�What about tomorrow? We do
milk them every Saturday.�

&nbsp;

�I have talked with G�nter
and we have decided to give them this week off. Milking is also a kind of
security measure against the students having sex if they should succeed in
tampering with the leather flap but now we have milked them twice for five
days. Their genitals are now so tender that they don�t want to do anything with
it for the next week. I don�t think that anyone of them would even think of
sex, so we skip the next milking session.�

&nbsp;




Black River, Jamaica May 2003 � Graduation

&nbsp;

It was a day of celebration
at Meditation Inlet. 20 students were
ready to leave the school and all were busy.

&nbsp;

Graduation was held in a
secluded area at the campus. In order to graduate the students had made it to
level 4 before marts. Two nights before the graduation the guards in the middle
of the night waked them and escorted them to the secluded area.

&nbsp;

Speaking of graduation was
strictly forbidden. It could distract the attention of the students from the
studies. Often the rest of the students woke in the morning with an empty bed
beside them. G�nter had put a lot of research into that subject when he started
the school and they had chosen this approach because they would spare the
students left behind for the emotional stress of saying goodbyes to the
graduates. 

&nbsp;

The next day they had to
try on dresses. Because the school was run with a Victorian theme the gowns the
girl wore, were replicates from that period. They were also issued corsets
without shoulder-straps, but their corsets were laced just a tight as the old
one. 

&nbsp;

The boys wore under-breast
corset and a dress suit and on their head they had a top hat on.

&nbsp;

The most difficult task for
the students was however to walk up to podium where they would be given their
exam papers. Both male and females had a pair of locking high heels on. So
besides fitting gowns and dresses also walking practice took time preventing
the students from doing naughtiness throughout the day. It was a matter of
keeping them busy. The parents for the majority of them were already on their
way from all over the states and Europe. It would be difficult
to explain the parents that their travel would be in vain.

&nbsp;

In the evening they were
strapped in their bed for the last time. Tomorrow they would be welcomed back
into a family � their own family.

&nbsp;

At six a.m. they were waked by the guard and began to prepare
themselves. All the morning went with bath, makeup and styling the hair. Most
of the girls had not worn make-up since they came to school. Make-up was
forbidden. The only hairstyle allowed for the students male or female was
rat-tales.

&nbsp;

The boys got a well-needed
haircut and for the first time in month�s even years for some of them, they
looked as young men again.

&nbsp;

When they were ready they
were lead to the graduation hall where they were placed in a chair where they
were buckled to the chair with cuffs to the armrest and a wide leather strap
around their waist.

&nbsp;

A facemask, which covered
their eyes and mouth, was also put on them and earplugs were inserted, so they
could not hear what was going on.

&nbsp;

Slowly the families entered
the hall and took their seat. When all were present G�nter mounted the podium
where he started the ceremony by welcoming the families and made a speech about
the lack of values youth in the western world live by and how these families
should fell so lucky that they were able to save their children from certain
death.

&nbsp;

When the speech was done,
he called the family to the podium one by one and when a student�s family was
standing there the guards freed the student and remove the earplugs and
blindfold. First they were a little confused by the assembly in the hall, but
soon the recognised their own family and there was a lot of tears and hugging.

Every time a student came
up to the podium the process was the same. First the family hugged the student
and welcomed him or her back in their family. Then G�nter asked the student to
kneel on a spanking bench. A guard lifted the gowns on the girls so their
underwear was visible. The boys just had to drop their trousers.

&nbsp;

The father or mother was
handed a cat-o-nine-tale and their task was now to administer one blow
corresponding to the student�s age.

&nbsp;

This part of the ceremony
served two purposes.

&nbsp;


 The kid was to enter the adult world and move on
     in life. Their past had now been forgiven and they were about to re-enter
     a normal family life. Sometime a kick is necessary to move forward in
     life. The spanking represented a symbolic kick.
 No anger in the parents towards the kid must
     remain in the parents. If they still held some grudge back their
     relationship would be difficult to fix. They had to let bygones be
     bygones. By spanking their kid they could get the anger out of their
     system.


&nbsp;

Most of the student
received about 16 to 21 blows. Of course � it was a celebration after all - it
was a light whip, so there was no blood even if it seems that some of the
parents had to blow some steam off. In some cases some of the siblings were
encouraging their brother or sister during the whipping. Some of the students
were quietly sobbing at the end, but as soon as the last blow had been
administered, the family hugged and comforted their child. 

&nbsp;

G�nter then handed the exam
paper to the student and wished good luck in the future and the family with
their new old member went back to their seats.

&nbsp;

When all students had been
joined together with their family they went to the dining hall where all joined
in for a banquet. A local band had been hired and for the students it was the
first music they had heard since they had sat their feet on the school campus.

&nbsp;

It was also the first time
they had enjoyed alcohol, and as the evening progressed the atmosphere became
more and more merry. It became very plain that alcoholism was a sickness that
could be inherited.

&nbsp;

Bonds were formed between
the families and it was past midnight before hired busses collected the families with the former students for
a drive to the motel G�nter owned further up the coast, which parents normally
used during visitation days. G�nter also used the motel to lure children of
European clients to Jamaica on a fake holiday because Teen Escort Services were forbidden in Europe. But tonight the motel would be solely reserved for the former students
and their family. Tomorrow they would go back to their homes in normal clothes.

&nbsp;

Fritz sat in a chair with a
bottle of wine. He thought of how strange it must be for the student to sleep
without a corset and with their hands free instead of the gloves. He knew that
G�nter and some staff members would go to the motel and offer the students
corsets for a fair price so they could continue to be laced for a period until
they their bodies had adjusted to do without a corset. Some the students would
never go without corset for the rest of their lives. A trim body would be their
key to society.

&nbsp;

But also another feeling
overwhelmed Fritz. The wine, female companionship made him think about Ann and
the twins. In the morning, he went to Fritz and quit the job. Later that day he
flew back to Holland.

Nunspeet, August 2003 � Changes

&nbsp;

When Fritz
returned to his farm, he was in for a surprise. A new resident had moved into
the house - His sister Beatrice.

&nbsp;

Both his
parents had died during his stay in Jamaica and Fritz and Beatrice were the
only lawful successors. For the first time in year the two siblings sat down a
talked about their life. Fritz was very curious to know what Ann had told
Beatrice about her and the twins but it seemed that Ann had made a story up
about Fritz saving them from the war.

&nbsp;

Beatrice
had taken a degree in child psychologist after some years studying law. When
she first came to the farm, she looked through the books with Ann and
discovered some entries where they could improve the
economy. So during Fritz absence they changed a few things so Fritz no longer
needed a job outside the farm to making the wheels turn.

&nbsp;

Ann and the
twins would run the farm if he just helped out once in a while.

&nbsp;

For a while
it was heaven. After having collected the mail he would sit on the terrace
until lunch. Sometime the girls would have time to have lunch with him -
sometimes not. In the evening Ann would come to him and they would have sex
like it has been before he went to Jamaica.

&nbsp;

He could
not understand how he had managed to do without Ann for such a long time. She
was so wonderful. It was like he had never left. Somehow she had matured and
was so good in licking and teasing him that he at some point got the suspicion
that she at some point during his absence must have got a lover. But as hard as
he investigated no sign of a man that should have stayed on the farm was seen.
So eventually he dropped his suspicion and enjoyed the sex with Ann.

&nbsp;

But there
was another change at the farm � the twins had begun to talk. When he asked how
that could be possible, Ann told him that Beatrice had given them some
consultations in private. Somehow it made Fritz uneasy. What if they discovered
what had happened that night with the other girls? All the tapes had been sold.
Even the master tape was gone. So they would only be able to figure the event
out if they by chance had seen some from the basement. It should have been
impossible.

&nbsp;

All though
he had enjoyed his stay at the farm after haft a year he wanted to have a job
outside the farm and by sheer luck he was contacted by a former soldier which
had started a low price airline. He agreed to take the job as a flight
attendant on a part time basis, so he could be at the farm and enjoy sex with
Ann from time to time.

&nbsp;




Somewhere
over the Atlantic, April 2006 � Revenge

&nbsp;

Fritz enjoyed his new job.
It was only part time and the only route he worked on was M-Air route from Amsterdam to Miami. 

&nbsp;

A former colonel from the
Dutch army had started M-Air, a discount airline company. Fritz was approached
by the manager and accepted the job as a flight attendant on the spot. In a way
he was sad for leaving Ann and the twins in charge, but at the other hand his
urge to leave was bigger, so he was soon on his first flight. M-Air was a true
discount company. A internally joke sounded �It is Sergeant Schmidt welcoming
you onboard as we can not afford a captain.� The management saw passengers as
cattle, which needed transport from, spot A to spot B - Nothing more.

&nbsp;

If he had been working full
time, the work would have been too stressful. They did not have time to clean
properly. During the flight the crew was shorthanded by the demanding
passengers. But as said before -The job was only part-time. It was bearable.

&nbsp;

On December 26, 2004 a tsunami struck Thailand. A lot of Dutch tourists had to be evacuated. M-air
sent one of their planes to Thailand and picked up some of the survivors. 

&nbsp;

When they arrived back at
the airport in Amsterdam, one of the relatives asked Fritz whether they could
take the back door avoiding the press because their relative was quite upset.
But Fritz said no. They had transported their passengers and their task was
over. So he ordered the passengers to go out trough the front gate where the
reporters waited. This was the kind of standard M-air was known fore. Just transport
� nothing more!

&nbsp;

Of course ordeal of passing
through a mob of journalists and photographers of course did put a strain on
the victims and Fritz had a laugh. Most of the company customers knew of the
bad and poor service but they considered the low price in favour of the level
of service.

&nbsp;

But then late in April his
plane was on tour to Miami from Amsterdam.

&nbsp;

He noticed the tall blond
woman at once when she boarded the plane.

&nbsp;

Her slim body was
outstanding and for once his considered giving a customer a decent treatment,
but then he notice another thing.

&nbsp;

The woman kissed her
girlfriend when they were seated in a manner that left no option. They were
lesbians.

&nbsp;

Fritz was disappointed. He
wanted so to have her. He had done it some times during his years at M-air.
Being very experienced he had seduced a young tourist into having sex at a
motel in Miami.

&nbsp;

One time he even got caught
red handed when he left his room at the motel by his sister. Beatrice did
sometimes attend conferences in the states due to her line of work. She
promised not to tell about it back home and he believed her.

&nbsp;

The two women on the plane
continued to hug and ordered wine while they played some kind of a card-game.
They were enjoying themselves and Fritz became exasperated. He took the
passenger list and discovered that they were Danes. If he was crossed before,
it now got him totally pissed off. He remembered how Danish soldiers back in Bosnia had destroyed his business by killing his mates.

He made a couple of
negative remarks to his colleagues. Most of them worked full-time and was
always exhausted and worn-out with little surplus left to deal with passengers.
The cheerful couple also irritated them. Passengers should sit down and remain
silent throughout the flight.

&nbsp;

His mind was filled with
intention about revenge but he did not know how to carry it out. Perhaps he
could drop wine on their clothes or spit in their food, before he got his
chance to do anything about it, the couple went to sleep.

&nbsp;

On the inside Fritz was
foaming with rage, but he couldn�t do anything. But after some hours fate did
throw matters into his hand.

&nbsp;

Shortly before the plane
was about to land, he went over to their seats to adjust the seat by the
window. The tall blond was sleeping with her blindfolds on. When he leaned in
over her, he got to smell her scent. She had a shirt blouse on and he put his
nose down to her cleavage in order to smell it. It reminded him about the
fields back at the farm.

&nbsp;

The lady woke by his
breathing into her face. Still wearing blindfolds she oblivious was alarmed
over it and slapped him in the face by reflex. It made a lot of noise and some
of his colleagues noticed it and giggled. Fritz stepped back and the woman
removed her blindfold and held her arm up as a sign of apology when she saw
whom she had hit.

&nbsp;

Every muscle in his body
wanted to punch her right in her face, but it would of course not be
appropriate. He went back to the stirrid where he
tried to calm himself down. One of his colleagues noticed his disposition and
said to him:

&nbsp;

�You could notice the
airport that we have passenger which is on an air rage. She did slap you and
after 9/11 we are the lords in the air. She would not stand a chance in court.
Go to the pilot and convince them to call for police backup upon arrival. If we
instead of using the loudspeaker go to each passenger and tell them to buckle
the seatbelts, they would sleep when we land and the police would be able to
take them by surprise. They would not know what hit them.�

&nbsp;

Fritz did as his colleague
told him and when the plane landed, the police was ready. They entered the
plane and pulled the poor women out of their seats still sleepy. Needless to
say that they became confused and started to talk in Danish, which upset the
police officers because they though that it was some kind of code messages. The
tall blond was thrown to the floor and her arm was twisted to her back where
she was handcuffed.

&nbsp;

They virtual dragged her
off the plane and on the inside Fritz was laughing at the scene.

&nbsp;

When he got the motel and
turned on the Television, the story was all over the news. The tall woman was
some kind of model and the when the police had handled her just like everybody
else she got extremely hurt because she was partly invalid from a former
traffic accident and also underweight due to her profession.

&nbsp;

He ordered a six-pack and a
hooker from the room service spent the rest of the evening partying.




Nunspeet, July 28 - 2006 � Surprise visit

Joyful

&nbsp;

Fritz was
at the farm reading his newspaper. He had some days off and had nothing to do.
Perhaps he would get Ann in later and have some sex with her. Lately he felt it
like there was some kind of distance between them. It was not like it used to
be. She had become demanding and he could not kill her off, because of his
sister.

&nbsp;

Beatrice
had moved her office from town to one of the buildings on the farm. It also
irritated him because even if she was his sister, he did not want to be around
her.

&nbsp;

His eyes
caught an article in the newspaper. It read that the Danish woman had been
forced to make a deal with the prosecutor. He had to admit that he had become a
little nervous when he was told that the woman was up to getting a jury trial.
He had contacted the police at the airport, and they had assured him that he
was not in danger. After 9/11, the aircrew could have kicked her in the face
and would not have faced any legal action.

&nbsp;

The model
was forced to undergo Anger Management therapy as a part of the deal with the
district attorney. Fritz had talked with Danes during the war in Bosnia from time to time and he knew that
she in the eyes of the Danish population was now much worse off than it would
have been the case if she had got 6 months in jail. Psychiatric treatment is
regarded as very shameful in Denmark. He knew from his talk with the
soldiers that they would rather endure with the psychological after effects
from being in a war zone the rest of their life than letting their family know
that they have been treated. Some had relatives with such social unacceptable sicknesses
and they had their names changed in order to protect their family.

&nbsp;

He knew by
hart that the model never again would appear publicly and properly would end
her career in a few years. He had his revenge in some way over the Danish
people.

&nbsp;

Out of pure
joy, he sat down and did something new in his life. He wrote a limerick.

---

&nbsp;

I notice you on the
plane as you board. Normally due to my low salary passengers do not make me
care.

Your long bright
hair - your trim figure -I long to talk to you, but do not dare.

&nbsp;

It seems that your
girlfriend is more than just a friend. Your kisses and laughing makes it seems
that we have a married couple to take care about.

It is contemptuous
to illustrate such an unnatural relationship in the open. The sun you let shine
on my vanished behind that cloud.

&nbsp;

You order wine and
yet more wine. Of course as a Dane you take can handle the booze. You only end
up getting sleepy.

You take your
blindfolds on. I have my chance to get happy.

&nbsp;

I am closing in on
you. How I want to squeeze those firm oranges.

Both you and your
girlfriend are sleeping heavily. Before I decide to make my move I hope the
situation does not bring any changes.

&nbsp;

My job is to adjust
the chairs. I bent my body in over you. My lips are 10
 centimetres from your. How I would like to take this kiss.

Then I smell you.
The time seems to stop. The scent of roses reaches my noose. I fantasy my hands
going over your entire body. I can feel every breath you take. You should not
have made your shirt stay to open. I move closer. I have all the time in the
world. How peaceful � no stress.

&nbsp;

WHACK!!

&nbsp;

You suddenly woke
and your hand flew up. You looked shocked by your own reaction. You put up your
hand in order to sign an apology.

I do not care. I
want rehabilitation. You have stopped my dream by your intend to start a
battery.

&nbsp;

If you were my wife
I would have you�re behind smacked.

I contact the pilot
in order to arrange for a reception committee, when we land. He also thinks
that such a conduct characterizes a brat. I knew I would be backed.

&nbsp;

When the police
arrived, you still have the blindfolds on.

They yank you up
without warning. You and your girlfriend are caught by surprised. You shout in
your funny language and it upsets the police. A 250-pound officer forces your
110-pound body to the ground and cuffed you on your back. The skin is torn on
one of your wrists. They pull you up and carry you. Then you are gone.

&nbsp;

Yesterday I bought
the newspaper. I got you. They had made you pay. Not by prison but by ordering
you to correct being bad-tempered crackpot.

The shameful
sentence would prevent you from ever been being taken serious. The sweetness of
revenge fills my mind. I could never have planned such a plot.

&nbsp;

I hope you one day
would travel in my plane once more. When I approach you I know you would be
stiff from fear. I would take my kiss. Squeeze your oranges. You will forever
become a property to me.

Both you and me
would never forget our night together on six - four - three.

The naughty flight
attendant

&nbsp;

---

&nbsp;

The rest of
the day he drank and ate in a cheerful mood. Tonight he would have the twins in
the bed too. They had the age so it was time that they had a real man.

&nbsp;

He was
about to get ready to have dinner when Ann called him from the barn. Something
was wrong. He went over just to find the lights all out. The must be something
wrong with the power was the thought he had.

&nbsp;

He called
for Ann. Then something hit him on his head and he went black.

&nbsp;

When he
came to himself he discovered that he was naked and tied to a chair.

&nbsp;

5 women
stood looking at him.

&nbsp;

Ann, the
twins, Beatrice and Paula!

Downer

&nbsp;

He was
confused. Why had they tied him up? How come that Paula is here? She should
somewhere in the states in a shelter.

&nbsp;

�Why have
you done this to me? Release me. Beatrice � help me! They have gotten mad!�

&nbsp;

Beatrice
stepped forward.

&nbsp;

�As you
know, I have worked with the twins. I have discovered your dirty secret. A
month ago, I also met Paula at a seminar about the abusive teenager
modification industry in the states. All those facilities put strains on the
charity organisations in the states, when you send innocent teenagers on the
road as victims for your so-called Exit Plans. And a lot of taxpayer�s
money goes to the treatment of the former students, when we wake from the post-traumatic
stress reaction. We can�t stop the industry but Paula and I made friends and in
fact we are lovers. We can however stop you and that is going to happen.�

&nbsp;

�But you
can not do this to me. I am your brother!� 

Ann
interrupted him. �I also have news for you. Beatrice had researched what took
place in Bosnia. Because she is Dutch and Paula is
from America, they can travel around in Bosnia without caring about their ethnic
roots. They talked with the landlord where you had your studio and paid for information
that led to the graves of the two girls from my village. One of them was my
cousin by the way. They even located some of the survivors and some of my
relatives. Those girls were reburied at a decent place.�

&nbsp;

�But I did
not kill them. I was forced.�

&nbsp;

�You can
stop those excuses up your ass. We know who was present. We will deal with
G�nter later. In fact Beatrice would start at a job as child psychologist at Meditation Inlet next month and the twins would
join me at some other positions, when I have arranged for it.�

&nbsp;

�What are
you going to do with me? You can�t prove any of those accusations.�

&nbsp;

�You will
see. I was able to obtain a tape of your first production. It must have slipped
behind one of shelves in the storeroom. It inspired us, but you will learn that
we are creative.�

&nbsp;

�I will
report you and I would beat you when I am free.�

&nbsp;

�I don�t
think so.� One of the twins went behind him and suddenly she held a cloth with
chloroform over his mouth. Fritz passed out again.

Cleaning job in the
storeroom

&nbsp;

When he
woke, he was hanging in his arms with suspension cuffs connected to chains from
the ceiling. He recognised the storeroom. They had inserted a huge gag ball in
his mouth.

&nbsp;

They had
used a spreader bar so there was free access to his genitals. He notices that
they all wore heavy latex apron and latex gloves. 

&nbsp;

�Good
morning, sunshine. You are up for a cleaning job, before we go to business.�

&nbsp;

One of the
twins moved behind him a pushed kind of butt plug in his behind. It hurt a
little. Then he felt it being pumped. She was some kind of tube connected to
the plug, which the twin connected to a tap. When she turned it on, he felt
cold water enter his rectum. His stomach soon began to cramp and he twisted and
turned in his bonds. 

&nbsp;

The pain
became intense and Ann signalled that they should stop. �We don�t want you to
get hurt � yet. Beatrice has made coffee and I think we just would take a
break, while the water settles in your system.�

�

They left.

&nbsp;

The pain
became more and more intense. He felt like screaming but the gag ball was very
effective. It was like he was going to explode. 15 minutes later they returned
to a Fritz covered in sweat and drifting in and out of unconsciousness.

&nbsp;

One of the
twins deflated the butt and removed it, which caused cascades of water running
out on the floor. They continued to clean him with cold water from a hose.

&nbsp;

�We need
you to be totally cleaned up inside. Here we go again.�

&nbsp;

This was
too much for Fritz. Even though he was gagged they could understand that it was
sobbing sounds that they could hear from behind the gag. The twins look
surprised at each other. They had broken him and they had not really started.
Was it the same man they had feared for years?

&nbsp;

Fritz was
filled with soap water a second time and left in agony. They returned and find
him limp. After his bowel had been released and he was cleaned they were ready
to some fun.

&nbsp;

The Jamaica way

&nbsp;

When Fritz woke he found
himself cleaned and dry. One of the twins had used his unconsciousness to shave
all his hair off. They had cuffs his legs to the floor so they were a little
apart.

&nbsp;

Ann came with a lot of
wires. He also saw Beatrice crying. He tried to make eye contact with her. She
was after all his sister. But she left so the twins could continue their
preparations.

&nbsp;

Paula came in front of him.
�We are going to prepare you like I was when I entered the school. Still, I
have to use corset because my body have adjusted to long time wear in the
school.�

&nbsp;

Fritz tried to protest but
the twins had already started with wrapping the rigid leather lining around his
waist. 

&nbsp;

Ann and Paula made sure
that he was hoisted off the ground so his body became stretched out.

&nbsp;

Both the twins tugged at
the stays, which caused the air to leave his lungs. His breathing soon became
difficult but they continued to tug. At some point, Fritz passed out but the
twins did not stop. Finally they were finished and Ann put a ball stretcher on
him. When Fritz woke after Paula had used smelling salt on him, he looked with
disbelief in the mirror Ann held up.

&nbsp;

His body had been
completely transformed. His lower body had an hourglass shape. His breath had
become very restricted. It was unbearable. And they were not finished. One of
the twins went behind him and he felt something enter his behind. Carefully a
butt plug was inserted and once inside it was inflated. Each pump meant
additional pain. He pulled his restraint and tried to shout. It was of no use.

&nbsp;

Ann patted him on the
cheek. �Now we are going to leave your for tomorrow. Try to get some sleep. I
will be a long day.�

&nbsp;

His brain mind was working
for full speed. His body hurt. His arms hurt. They could not leave him here.

&nbsp;

But they did. 

Nunspeet, July 29 - 2006 � A very long day

Electrical torture

&nbsp;

The next morning the women
entered. Beatrice had prepared a breakfast and took the ball gag out.

&nbsp;

�Beatrice. Release me. You
are my sister. Does it not count?�

&nbsp;

�After having learned what
you have done of damage to our family name I regard myself as not having a
brother anymore. A part of me would always have feelings about you but that is
memory and the past. For me you died the moment I saw the graves of the poor
girls in Bosnia.�

&nbsp;

�I have saved three girls
from the certain death. Does it not count?�

&nbsp;

�You saved them because you
needed some sex-slaves. You will properly have done them in, if your pals
haven�t lost their lives.�

&nbsp;

�But..�

&nbsp;

�No but! Eat! You are going
to need it.� Beatrice began to feed Fritz. Slowly he finished his breakfast.
His stomach was compressed so he couldn�t eat very much. Paula came closer.

&nbsp;

�For an unspeakable amount
of time I had to live solely of soup and bananas. Now you would learn how it is
to be hungry and be unable to eat just because there is no room for food.� Then
she pulled a hood over his head. There were openings for the eyes and the
mouth. She laced it tight.

&nbsp;

The hood was also issue
with a gag ball that could be clipped on and Ann put it in his mouth. Fritz did
not even resist. If Beatrice wouldn�t help him, he was as left to their mercy.
When the gag ball was inserted Ann buckled a piece of leather over the mouth
opening. He could not utter a sound.

&nbsp;

Ann took some wires and
clipped them on the corset. Suddenly Fritz realized that it was one the awful
punishment corset from the school. 

&nbsp;

He tried to make some
protests but he was only able to make mumbling sounds.

&nbsp;

When he was all wired up
Ann stood in front of him.

&nbsp;

�We can not burn you alive
and still having fun later on. So we are going to progress slowly. The fun
starts now.�

&nbsp;

With these words she pushed
a button on the panel.

�

Fritz felt it like someone
had kicked him in his kidneys. His body tensed up

&nbsp;

When they stopped the
current, his body continued to shiver.

&nbsp;

�I hope that it was not
fatal.�

&nbsp;

�Ill weeds grow apace.�

&nbsp;

Ann checked him with a stethoscope.
When she decided he was OK, she gave a sign to the twins. A second shock went
through Fritz�s body. When they turned it off, he
pissed on the floor. 

&nbsp;

At once, they reapplied the
electricity. This time the he also lost bowel control. It was way better than
they had expected. They began to laugh hysterical. Their feeling was a mix of
revenge, anger but also a kind of reunion with their own torment years back.
One of the twins broke down in tears remembering their former girlfriends,
which lost their life at the end of the rope by the hands of Fritz and his
pals.

&nbsp;

Paula entered the room.
�Don�t you think that you should give you self a break before you lose it?�

&nbsp;

The left Fritz and sat down
over the lunch table.

&nbsp;

After some time eating
without a word, Paula broke the silence. �Could we not say that the punishment
for his actions in Bosnia is paid? Further electrical torture would properly just kill me and
they you won�t get the chance for repaying him for his years of abuse on this
farm.�

&nbsp;

One of the twins nodded. Paula
continued �Let continue with our plan.� Ann agreed: �Although I still miss
something, I think that your revenge must be our next step.�

Strap-on dildo torture

&nbsp;

Beatrice did choose to go
to town for some shopping in order to put her mind on something else.

&nbsp;

The rest of them came into
the room. They checked him and found him unconscious. Then
went on to the next step.

&nbsp;

When he woke he was back at
the bench tied up. They had removed the hood and he found the four of them
standard in front of him. All of them had leather corsets on. Also they had a
strap-on dildo mounted on a harness on.

&nbsp;

�Years of abuse are going
to be repaid now.� One of the twins went behind him and soon he felt the
pressure from the dildo against his sphincter. The pain was intense. The pressure
increased and suddenly it slipped inside him. He screamed from pain. No
lubricant as all was used. She picked up speed at once. The other twin moved in
front of him. She wanted him to lick her.

&nbsp;

He cleansed his teeth.
Paula interfered. �I have an idea so he would be more service-minded.� She
returned with some kind of a gag. �It is a tube-gag. This way he has to serve
us.�

&nbsp;

But he refused to open his
mouth. However, the twin working his rear hole knew the trick. She grasped his
balls hard, which made protest. The gag went in at once and soon after he had
to lick the dildo the other twin inserted in his mouth through the tube-gag.

&nbsp;

The twins switched places
and he was almost ready to vomit when the dildo which had been in his rectum
was put in his mouth.

&nbsp;

Both the twins were panting
and exhausted. The twins left for a shower and now it was Paula and Ann, who
took their time.

&nbsp;

First Paula was hesitant
but Ann convinced her to go on.

&nbsp;

They must have done it for
hours. What Fritz did not know, was that their corset also had built-in dildos.
She satisfied them selves while fucking him. Ann came with a cry. Paula
followed soon after. 

&nbsp;

When Ann redrew for the
last time, she noticed the blood. �Oh. That must hurt. What a fitting
punishment for all those years of having me to lie under a sweating disgusting
man.�

&nbsp;

�Well, I never had to serve
him, but his manipulating made my parents disallow me to return home. I ended
up with 50 dollars several hundred of miles from home. I had none to call. I
had been at the school for so long that I could not get hold of my family for
friends in my hometown. I just couldn�t remember a phone number. I lived on the
streets until Beatrice found me in a shelter. I even won�t talk about what I
did for a living. Just remembering all those things I wanted to repay him for
it so hard that I would slice his throat this instance.�

&nbsp;

�We all have a reason for
revenge, but you have to get a hold on yourself. Beatrice is our key towards
you complete revenge. You can not even get close to G�nter, but she can. You
also know her demands when it comes to her brother. She wants to have her
private moment with a corpse, which have no nasty holes in it and of course she
made it very definite that his head has to be connected to his body.� 

&nbsp;

�We can let him go after
this. I hope that you have a plan for him to die.�

&nbsp;

�Oh. I have. Oh. You can be
sure that I have.�

The last dance

&nbsp;

Ann was busy in the barn.
She was a little stressed. It had to be perfect. 4 four deck chair was lined
up. Drinks - toys � had she remembered everything in place.

&nbsp;

The door opened. The twins
and Paula entered with Fritz. He was naked but had an arm binder on. When he
saw what was in store for him, he panicked. He tried to pull away. It looked at
he begged for his life, but a gag ball had replaced the tube gag. Even if they
could have understood his begging, even he knew that they would not spare him.
It was just pathetic.

&nbsp;

Soon he was positioned
under the noose. He had a frightened look in his eyes.

&nbsp;

Paula took a wide leather belt
and strapped it around his thighs. They wanted to see some kicking.

&nbsp;

Ann gave him a kiss on his
chick. �Happy journey - Darling.� Then she pulled a
hood over his head.

&nbsp;

Next the noose came into
place.

&nbsp;

One of the twins had a
remote control and she activated it so a winch in the ceiling pulled the rope
tight. It was cold in the barn. They could see his breath when he took his
breathe.

&nbsp;

The girls were warmed up.
They undressed and sat down in the deck chairs. Soon they were busy satisfying
them selves. Ann activated the remote control once more. Now Fritz was forced
up on his toes. They could see how his breath was becoming more difficult. It
just turned them on.

&nbsp;

It was so arousing to see
the hood moving very fast: �Breathe in � Breathe out, in � out, in � out.� Ann
felt her nipples tense up.

&nbsp;

Ann used a vibrator and she
was almost in heaven when she felt a tongue in her private parts. It was
Beatrice. She was supposed to be in town, but regardless of the fact that Fritz
was her brother, she wanted to be present.

&nbsp;

Beatrice�s skilled tongue
soon brought Ann to her climax. Just as waves of pleasure rolled through her
body, she activated the remote control a last time. 

&nbsp;

The feet of Fritz left the
ground. For some minutes it was as they tried to find support, but then the -
for the girls sexually arousing - sight of a man dancing in a panicked attempt
to avoid deaths started.

&nbsp;

Fritz tried to turn and
twist in frantic try to get out of his deathly situation while groans escaped
from his hood. One of the twins came with a cry. She slipped back in her deck
chair. Fritz�s member became erect. It would not be
fun, it he came too soon, so Ann went over a put a ball stretcher on him.

&nbsp;

Beatrice started to work on
Paula. She was in some kind of service-mode today. She licked all the juices
from Paula and soon Paula came violent.

&nbsp;

The movement of Fritz had
turned into a shiver. Ann stood near him. �He is almost a goner. I will assist
him. With a quick move she took a dildo and forced it up with rectum, which had
been enlarged from hours of strap-on dildo. He shot a load, which they had
never seen him do before. It just did not seem to stop. It made the last of the
twins reach her climax.

&nbsp;

They left him there until
next morning.

&nbsp;

The next morning Ann found
Beatrice crying next to her brother body - Still hanging from the day before.
It was as he still had a hard-on, but of course Ann knew that it was due to his
blood being caught in the lower part of his body after his heart had stopped.

&nbsp;

�Do you have regrets?�

&nbsp;

�No. Even due to the fact
that he was my brother, he had to go.�

&nbsp;

�Where shall we put him?�

&nbsp;

�I want it to be up in the
new field. He loved the smells of flowers. Let him rest in peace.�

&nbsp;
