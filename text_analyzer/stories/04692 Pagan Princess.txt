&nbsp;

It is the year 50 AD; Roman invaders had set up enclaves
throughout the southern lands of Briton. They had met with fierce Pagan Kings
who fought bitterly against them and also showed the same aggression toward
their neighbouring counterparts.

&nbsp;

One of these Kings was Alfred who had spawned two children, a boy
and a girl. His son who was every bit as fierce as his father perished at the
hands of the Romans in one of the bloodiest of battles ever to have raged on
the south coast of Briton. The experienced Romans quickly took control of the
southern lands, sacking villages and exterminating all resistance that stood in
their way. Soon many of the communities found themselves devoid of their young
men who had perished at Roman hands.

&nbsp;

Alfred�s grief knew no bounds as he looked upon his remaining
offspring, his daughter Melissia. At this time she was just 18 years old, she
was a tall slim girl with deep red chestnut hair and large brown eyes. Eyes
that could melt a man from twenty paces and what is more had inherited her
mother�s beauty. He watched her as she hacked at a sack that she had strung
from a tree.

&nbsp;

�What game are you playing daughter,� he said wearily but with an
amused smile.

&nbsp;

�I am killing those people that took my brothers life,� she
replied puffing out her chest pretending to be a warrior.

&nbsp;

�What you do Melissia is commendable but you are no match for
those invaders from Rome, now put down your sword and help your mother prepare
supper.�

&nbsp;

�Bah! All I ever do is woman�s work, I want to fight father, to
kill Romans.� She gave a mock frown and squared her jaw.

&nbsp;

Alfred put his hand on his daughters shoulder.

&nbsp;

�Melissia your bravery knows no bounds but you know little of
these people that you hate so much. They fight differently from us, they speak
a language that is unknown to us, what can you hope to do against them?�

&nbsp;

�Father I want to learn how to fight them, I want to learn their
language, I want to know everything about them and most importantly of all I
want to avenge your son, my brother.�

&nbsp;

Alfred�s eyes moistened as he gazed at the determination of his
daughter.

�

�I do not want you to become a warrior my little princess but by
all means learn their language. I know of a learned man that can teach you but
he lives far from here, are you prepared to go to this man for the knowledge
you require?� He gazed into her doe like eyes hoping that leaving home would
dissuade her.

&nbsp;

�Yes I want to learn all there is about Romans, how they think,
how they fight, everything.� There was an immense eagerness in her eyes that
disturbed the old King.

&nbsp;

�Melissia please, first things first, I will arrange for you to go
to the man Arnold who speaks Latin the Roman tongue. It is a difficult language
but your mind is quick, I think you will learn fast.�

&nbsp;

She hugged her father and ran off to tell the good news to her
frail mother. Alfred bowed his head in thought and wondered what he had
started. 

&nbsp;

The man Arnold was not only a wise scholar but also an
accomplished swordsman and he felt sure his daughter would flash those wondrous
eyes at him to extract this skill from him. No one could resist Melissia�s
pleading look, she could twist a man around her little finger. 

&nbsp;

Oh! Thought Alfred, what have I inflicted on poor Arnold? The old
King turned and slowly walked back to his fortress bracing himself for the
tongue lashing that would surely come from Melissia�s mother.

&nbsp;

Nearly two years had passed and Melissia was returning to her
father�s fortress in South Downland, she reflected on her past years under
Arnold�s tuition.

&nbsp;

Arnolds home was an old monastery that was very befitting for the
scholar he was. Alfred had warned him in a letter about his daughter and of her
ambitions for revenge on the Romans. In it he wrote, �Teach her Latin and any
other tongues she wishes to learn but please omit the sword play she will
surely crave.� The Kings words had a pleading note to them and Arnold resolved
himself to obey them.

&nbsp;

When Melissia arrived at his door Arnold was totally smitten by
her. She moved with the grace of a gazelle and had the dark soft brown eyes of
a baby deer. Her body was almost fully developed and it was obvious to him that
she kept herself exceedingly fit. She had strong firm breasts leading down to a
flat muscular stomach; her legs were lean with a well-defined muscle structure,
peculiar to those of an athlete. When she smiled she revealed a perfect set of
pearly white teeth. �By the gods!� thought Arnold �I have a goddess in my
house.�

&nbsp;

As time passed at the monastery Melissia soaked up knowledge like
a sponge, Latin became a second language to her, she also became fluent in
French and German. Arnold found it increasingly difficult to keep up with her
thirst for learning. Soon the dreaded question arose.

&nbsp;

�Dear Arnold, will you teach me how to use a sword?� She said it with
that look that made him melt on the spot.

&nbsp;

�I�I�� Arnold stammered, taken aback by the directness of her
question.

&nbsp;

�Well Arnold, will you?� She went on, cupping her delightful chin
in her hands and flashing those eyes.

&nbsp;

�Oh Princess, I promised your father that I would not teach you
such things.� He replied with a look that said, �Please don�t ask me again.�

&nbsp;

Over the next few weeks, having used her charisma and charms to
their maximum, Melissia had made Arnold relent and so began her training, which
she took too with an even greater relish than that for language. Arnold also
taught her good manners, etiquette, and civility and over the following months
Melissia�s hatred for the Romans began to mellow. Even so, she still managed to
glean every tiny bit of Arnold�s fighting knowledge from him. As the months
wore on he felt deeply guilty as to what he was teaching Alfred�s daughter. He
had broken every promise he had made to his King and he was truly ashamed of
himself. Melissia had charmed him like no other could; he could not resist the
power she had over him, he was like soft clay in her hands and his love for her
knew no bounds

&nbsp;

Melissia snapped herself out of her reminiscences as she neared
her father�s fortress. She pulled her horse up at the top of the downs and
looked down into the valley. Her heart froze as she surveyed the smouldering
ruins that were once her home. In a terrible frenzy she rode full gallop toward
the ruined fortress, as she rode she could see many mounds of freshly dug
earth. An old man was tending two of the mounds as Melissia pulled up her mount
beside him.

&nbsp;

�What has happened here, tell me old man?� she screamed stricken
with panic. 

&nbsp;

�It was the Romans little lady, they came on yesterday�s dawn and
murdered everyone.� He bowed his head in tearful grief, pushing at the fresh
earth.

&nbsp;

�My Father my Mother what news of them?� She looked at him utter
dread filling her eyes.

&nbsp;

�And who may they be?� Asked the old man wearily.

&nbsp;

�Why Alfred and Serena, the King &amp; Queen of South Downland, I
am Melissia their daughter have you forgotten me already?�

&nbsp;

He looked up at the flame haired woman who addressed him.
�Melissia is it really you? May the gods be praised, you have returned.� The
old man was truly pleased to see her.

&nbsp;

Then his smile faded, �Melissia the news is as grave as it can be,
the Romans have been systematically killing our leaders. Your Mother and Father
were put to the sword, their bodies lie under these very mounds I tend.� With
that he bowed his head and sobbed.

&nbsp;

Melissia
dismounted and flew to his side. �Dead!� My parents are Dead?� 

&nbsp;

She
grabbed some of the soil and held it to her chest. 

&nbsp;

�Old man
tell me all you know of these vile killers, I had forgiveness in my heart but
now I see nothing but blood and hate. MY HATE, THEIR BLOOD!�

&nbsp;

******

&nbsp;

Melissia rode deep into the forest her emotions filled with both
grief and anger. Coming upon a clearing next to a babbling stream she
dismounted from her horse and knelt down to take a drink from the cold clear
water. Having drank she sat back on her haunches and surveyed the surrounding
forest, everything seemed so very quiet, there was just the faintest sound of
the wind rustling the trees.

&nbsp;

Unknown to Melissia eyes were upon her, the eyes belonged to a
girl named Helena. She was about the same age as Melissia with thick brunette
coloured hair and olive skin. She too had a lithe healthy body thanks to
healthy eating and clean living. Helena�s eyes drank in the sight of the woman
in the clearing; she noted the deep redness of her hair, the regal look, and
she seemed to have all the prowess of a hunter. The scantiness of her attire
stirred her, the soft leather loincloth around her nether regions and the small
piece of material that covered her breasts. She wondered at the girls golden skin
colour that she showed so much of. In addition she appeared to be some kind of
warrior, for she carried a great sword and other some fearsome looking weapons.

&nbsp;

Helena�s eagerness to see more of her quarry caused her to tread
on some twigs that alerted Melissia who unsheathed the deadly looking sword she
kept at her side.

&nbsp;

�Who�s there show yourself?&quot; Melissia shouted through
clenched teeth

&nbsp;

Helena stepped out of h.

&nbsp;

�My name is Helena daughter of Seth and Mary.� Replied the
quivering girl.

&nbsp;

Melissia lowered her sword realising the girl was a Briton and of
no threat to her. 

&nbsp;

�What is it you seek Helena?� Asked Melissia as she sheathed her
sword.

&nbsp;

�Oh I was here in the clearing and I saw you arrive, clearly you
are not from here and your weapons intimidated me.� Said Helena hoping that the
warrior woman�s sword would remain where it was.

&nbsp;

�Please don�t be afraid of me Helena, I am just passing through,
here, come sit with me.� Melissia sat down and patted the grass beside her.

&nbsp;

An hour passed while Melissia gave the girl a brief resume of her
life story, she told her of her tuition under Arnold and the death of her
parents and brother. Helena�s story was much the same regarding her parents;
they too had died at the hands of the Romans, she too was very bitter toward
the invaders.

&nbsp;

�Then like me you have no family to speak of, would you like to
join me?� Melissia put a pleading hand on Helena�s shoulder. 

She went on, �I seek like minded women to join my band, I will
hone them into fearsome warriors have no doubt about that, are you with me
girl?�

&nbsp;

Helena had been mesmerised by Melissia�s eyes, the sheer look of
determination in them was incredible and she knew the answer had to be yes. To
be just a small part of Melissia�s army would indeed be a great honour, even
then Helena felt she could lay down her life for her and her cause.

&nbsp;

�Then
come Helena, from this very day you will be my first lieutenant, let us seek
out others who have suffered the same fate. We will become a great thorn in the
side of Rome.� 

&nbsp;

�������� 
 


&nbsp;

With
that the two women mounted Melissia�s horse and rode ever deeper into the
forest to seek out what would be the most formidable guerrilla army ever to
have roamed Britons lands.

&nbsp;

For the next six months Melissia and Helena visited all the towns
and villages gathering recruits as they went. Finally they had amassed an army
of would be warrior women. Melissia trained five of the toughest women
personally, then sent those out to train another fifty each in the art of
combat and swordsmanship. The women learned quickly for they all had a
consuming hatred of the Romans. 

&nbsp;

Helena had introduced Melissia to Rebecca daughter of the late
blacksmith of Storrings Town. The Romans too had murdered him but before his
untimely death his daughter had acquired her late fathers skills at the forge.
It was Rebecca�s task to forge the initial crude weapons the women would need.
Melissia insisted that the armour should be minimal, just enough to cover vital
organs, shoulders, forearms, and thighs. This attire would not be appropriate
she said but it would give them the utmost agility.

&nbsp;

Rebecca had expressed her concerns to Melissia regarding the
amount of weapons needed plus all the horses and body armour required. Melissia
allayed her fears by describing how she would systematically relieve the Roman
patrols of theirs.

&nbsp;

And so the slaughter started, the Roman invaders were spread very
thin in southern Briton and were easy pickings for the marauding women. Indeed
the invaders had thought they had contained any would be threat by either
killing or enslaving all the young men from the towns and villages. They had
not made any allowances regarding an uprising by mere women. 

&nbsp;

Soon Melissia and her army of warrior women had all the weapons,
horses and armour they needed. They had attacked food supply columns, this
helped boost their own supplies meted out by loyal towns folk and villagers.
Within a year the women had slaughtered every patrol they had encountered and
had set up strongholds in all the villages in South Downland. In all that time
not one Roman soldier had been spared, the women had vowed to take no
prisoners.

&nbsp;

Meanwhile back at the old forge in Storrings Town Melissia and
Helena reflected on the past months. Melissia was removing her body armour by
the fireside; Helena was seated at a nearby trestle table.

&nbsp;

�We have done well thanks to you Melissia.� Helena gazed at
Melissia as she removed her breastplate.

&nbsp;

�Yes, I am extremely pleased at our success so far, you and the
other women have excelled yourselves.� Melissia removed the final piece of
thigh armour from her legs. Then in all innocence removed the rest of her scant
clothing.

&nbsp;

Helena stared transfixed at the scene before her; Melissia�s body
was illuminated from behind by the flickering fire. The sheen of her skin
glowed in the golden light; Helena was totally smitten by her leaders beauty.

&nbsp;

�Why do you stare so?� inquired Melissia as she wiped the skin
that had captivated Helena so much.

&nbsp;

�Oh I�I�m sorry.� stammered the brunette, �I didn�t realise I was
staring.� Helena looked down at her feet stunned at her leader�s perception.

&nbsp;

�Don�t worry Helena, I myself have those feelings from time to
time, none of us have known any kind of love for many a year.� Melissia went
over to Helena and cupped her face in her hands. �I too have tried to hide my
feelings from you Helena and now I guess the killings have stirred deep
passions within us. We have no men to quell those passions, so what else is
there?� With that Melissia gave the brunette the gentlest of kisses.

&nbsp;

�Let us go outside Helena, we shall vent some of those feelings
tonight, tomorrow we both could be dead!� Melissia took Helena�s hand and lead
her into the forest.

&nbsp;

Helena melted at the thought of being made love to by this flame
haired temptress. Her loins burned and flooded at the thought. She followed
Melissia into a forest glade.

&nbsp;

�I would gladly die a thousand times for just this one night with
you Melissia.� Said Helena as her leader peeled away her garments.

&nbsp;

�������������� 
 


&nbsp;

�And I too.� Replied Melissia. �Pleasure me lieutenant, pleasure
me and believe me, I will pleasure you like no other person on this earth can!�
With that the two girls locked themselves into a violent embrace.

&nbsp;

********

&nbsp;

At his palace in Nova Magus the Roman Consul Petronius Arius gazed
toward the estuary far down in the valley of the Ems River. Petronius was a hawkish
man some thirty-eight years old; he was tired of this barbaric land with its
heinous Anglo Saxon�s and marauding pirates from Germany and France. He lorded
over some 200.000 soldiers of the Roman Empire who had been spread thinly all
over the south coast of Briton. To him Briton was the most inhospitable place
on Earth with its cold wet winters and temperate summers. This summer however,
was exceedingly hot and humid even by Britons standards.

&nbsp;

To add to his discomfort he had been receiving reports that food
convoys and patrols were being systematically wiped out. Not one of the
soldiers had lived to tell who the perpetrators were. He sent for his General
Honorius Plexus who controlled all his troops south of Londinium. The General
was also a battle weary soldier who longed to return to Rome. He stood before
the Consul and saluted.

&nbsp;

�Honorius, I thought we had eradicated all opposition to our
troops in South Downland, by the gods man we even disposed of its errant king!�
The Consul turned from the window and faced his General, a quizzical expression
on his face. 

&nbsp;

�Consul I am sure we had but it seems we have a new enemy on our
hands. Yet another enemy to add to the ever growing numbers.� Replied the
General wearily.

&nbsp;

�This one is different Honorius, they have acquired horses, horses
from our own men. Up to now Britons had little knowledge of horses and indeed
little knowledge of fighting on horseback, so who are they?� The Consul slammed
his fist down on the marble table in front of him.

&nbsp;

�At this moment I have no idea, release some more troops to me
Consul and I will appoint an appropriate Commander to seek them out and destroy
them, whoever they are!� Replied the General sternly.

&nbsp;

�Yes, yes Honorius, I will give orders for a legion to be released
from our border with Caledonia. Things are a little quieter there now since the
wall was built marking our territory but you must not fail me General, if this
news gets back to Rome we will both be banished to the Siberian wastes!�
Petronius sat down and unfolded a map of South Downland.

&nbsp;

�Get your men to start their search here.� The Consul tapped the
map with his finger. �And General.� He went on. �If it is at all possible bring
the leader of this uprising to me personally.� An example must be made; it must
be understood that anyone leading an uprising against Rome will meet with a
long lingering and terrible death!� 

&nbsp;

Honorius saluted his Consul and left to organise his counter
offensive in South Downland. At his headquarters in Nova Magus he sat down and
thought about whom he would appoint to lead the first sweep. The name that came
to mind was Antoninus Maximus, a bright young centurion that had excelled in
the destruction and capture of would be guerrilla�s forces. He was a powerful
young man and extremely battle hardy, the General felt he would be the man to
bring these rebels to account.

&nbsp;

During the next few weeks a legion of three thousand men arrived
just south of Londinium. Honorius Plexus was there to meet them together with
Antoninus Maximus. The men were tired from their long march from the north.
Honorius told the captains to let their men rest and then select a cohort of
three hundred men to carry on to South Downland. 

&nbsp;

Antoninus was duly promoted to Tribune and was to lead this first
cohort and seek out the guerrillas, he wanted dearly to kill them all but he
was ordered to bring back a special prisoner. This prisoner was to be made a
supreme example of, so Rome could be appeased, so the Britons would think twice
before challenging the might of Rome again!

&nbsp;

*******

&nbsp;

Melissia and Helena continued to seek sexual pleasure from each
other over the next few weeks. Every time they killed Romans they sort refuge
in each other�s arms. Killing and lovemaking became entwined, they were
insatiable together.

&nbsp;

Meanwhile just to the north in a village called Middle Hurst
Antoninus Maximus arrived with his cohort of soldiers. It was his intention to
question the villagers as to the possible whereabouts of the guerrilla army he
sort. The villagers froze as the Romans marched into their haven, they wanted
to run but there was nowhere for them to go. All the young men and boys of the
village had been killed or taken to the Roman galleys for a lifetime in
slavery. All that remained were a handful of young girls and a smattering of
very elderly men and women.

&nbsp;

Antoninus dismounted from his horse and accompanied by three
centurions walked from one hut to another. In the darkness of one of the huts
they came upon a young girl cowering in the corner, she was clearly afraid of
the invaders. The girl was in her early 20�s and was called Meena, she was a
small lean girl, with a pretty round face and light straw coloured hair. She
was barefoot and wore a rough dress made of sackcloth.

&nbsp;

Antoninus who spoke the Saxon Language addressed the girl. �Come
outside, we wish to ask you some questions.� He grabbed her by the elbow and
dragged her out of the hut. He liked it when they were afraid, the frightened
ones always proved very helpful.

&nbsp;

�You can start by telling us your name girl!� Yelled the first
centurion as he towered over her.

&nbsp;

�M.m.my�n.n..name..is..Meena.� She stammered, hardly able to
speak. 

&nbsp;

The villagers looked on, they were all truly terrified by this
unwelcome intrusion by so many Romans. They all knew why they had come it was
only a matter of time, now here they were in terrifying numbers surrounding the
village.

&nbsp;

Antoninus put his hand on the centurions shoulder and moved him to
one side; he then gripped Meena�s shoulders. �What can you tell me about the
attacks on our patrols Meena?� His fierce eyes burned into her.

&nbsp;

�I..I...know nothing of what you ask sir.� She whimpered,
terrified of the large Roman.

&nbsp;

Antoninus turned to one of his centurions. �Did you bring your
whip Drachius? I think Meena�s memory is somewhat lacking.� He continued to
gaze into the girls eyes, looking for tell tale signs that she knew more then
she let on.

&nbsp;

Drachius nodded and fetched a fearsome looking whip from his
saddlebag, in full view of Meena and the villagers he uncoiled it.

&nbsp;

Antoninus turned to the villagers. �I have no stomach for putting
young women under the lash, so if anyone would like to give me the information
I seek then we can put an end to all this unpleasantness!�

&nbsp;

There was just a murmured shuffling amongst the villagers but no one
spoke up.

&nbsp;

�Very well then, the lash it will be, seize her up!� 

&nbsp;

Three soldiers stepped forward and dragged Meena to a nearby post.
They stripped her naked and tied her hands above her head. The girl stood
trembling and braced herself for the ordeal that was to come.

&nbsp;

Antoninus address the assembled villagers once more. �There is no
reason for this girl to receive a single lash if I receive the information I
need!� He waited for an answer but none came, the villagers just stared down at
their feet.

&nbsp;

�Very well Drachius lay it on!� Antoninus stepped back

&nbsp;

Drachius was a well-muscled man with immensely powerful arms; he
drew the whip back and laid the first lash squarely across Meena�s shoulder
blades. The blow completely knocked all breath out of the young girl and drew a
shrill scream from her which was followed by loud sobs. A large red weal
quickly formed on her soft skin. 

&nbsp;

Antoninus addressed the villagers again. �As you can see I am not
bluffing, he turned to the girl. �Meena, there is no need for you to suffer
this torture, tell me what I want to know and I will have you cut down!�

&nbsp;

Meena spoke through continuous sobs. �P..P..Please s..s..sir..I
cannot help you with the information you seek, d�d�don�t hurt me anymore, this
is so terrible for me!� She sobbed even more.

&nbsp;

Antoninus countered, �That is not the right answer, Meena,
Drachius, lay it on until I tell you to stop!� He stepped away once more.

&nbsp;

Drachius drew back his mighty whip arm and struck the girl firmly
across the shoulders once more, her whole body shook and another ugly weal
criss-crossed the first. Meena screamed so loudly her voice became hoarse. The
soldier struck again, this time the lash landed across the young girls
backside, her buttocks trembled under the blow. Meena struggled wildly in a
vane effort to avoid the punishing strokes; her body glistened in the sunlight
as the pain from the welts burned into her skin. This was a pain like no other
she had ever experienced in her young life, she hoped beyond all hope that her
suffering would be worthwhile for she did not want to betray Melissia or her
army. 

&nbsp;

Drachius continued to lay stroke after stroke across Meena�s back,
buttocks and thighs. She had now lost her ability to scream, her vocal chords
were damaged and she was loosing control of her bladder.

&nbsp;

Antoninus ordered the soldier to stop; he turned once more to the
villagers. �I am going to ask one last time for the information I seek, if it
is not forthcoming I will have this girl lashed to death!� He paused to wait
for an answer that did not come. He spoke to the two soldiers that were
standing each side of the suspended girl. 

&nbsp;

�Very well, turn her around to face us, we will see how her
breasts and stomach fare under the lash!�

&nbsp;

Meena could not believe what she had heard; having lacerated her
back they were now going to do the same to her front. She squeezed her eyes
shut and gritted her teeth. 

&nbsp;

�Proceed!� Antoninus turned to the crowd once again. � I mean what
I say, please understand she will be whipped to death!�� 

&nbsp;

The two flanking soldiers turned Meena�s body around for her to
receive lashes to the front of her body. As Drachius drew his arm back to
continue his onslaught one of the village elders stepped forward.

&nbsp;

�STOP!� he shouted, �I will give you the information you require,
I cannot standby and watch you murder this young girl!�� A murmur went through
the assembled crowd.

&nbsd. �What is your name old man?�

&nbsp;

�I go by the name of Frederick� He replied

&nbsp;

The Tribune rose from his crude wooden chair. �Well Frederick you
have given us much to ponder and I thank you for your candour regarding these serious
matters, you may leave us now.�

&nbsp;

As soon as Frederick left the hut anger erupted from the three
centurions.

&nbsp;

Antoninus held up his hand to silence them. �Gentlemen, calm down,
we must approach this problem calmly and logically. An army has been constructed
from the very persons we overlooked, the women. Therefore we must take steps to
see that this cannot happen ever again. So centurions, instruct your men to
round up all the capable women and little girls and have them ferried to the
galleys. We must let this Pagan Princess know that her people are once again
under our total control. Also let it be known that we are retaining a small
proportion of children as hostages. She must be advised that if she does not
surrender herself to me personally within the month the hostages will be put to
death. So let it be written, so let it be done!�

&nbsp;

Shouts and screams came from the villagers as the Roman soldiers
rounded up the women and children. They were put into crude wooden cages that
had been commandeered from the village. The cages containing the captives were
then loaded onto wooden carts to begin their arduous journey to the south coast
of Briton. The Tribune left word that he would receive Melissia�s surrender at
the very town she called home, Storrings Town. 

&nbsp;

Thanks to Frederick Antoninus had been furnished with all the
information he needed regarding the errant Princess. He knew she would
surrender herself once the plight of the hostages reached her. Already in his
mind he planned her punishment. It also crossed his mind what the Consul would
have to say when he heard that his troops had been dieing at the hands of a
young woman and her female friends. He also remembered the Consuls last words
to his General; �I want the transgressor brought to me alive!�

&nbsp;

�Ah yes.� Thought the Tribune. �I will save enough of her for the
Consul to set his example to the people. In the mean time I will make her
scream for mercy, to beg for death, the road to Nova Magus is a long one.� He
smiled to himself. �Soon Melissia, soon your skin will be mine.�

&nbsp;

It only took a few days for the news as to what happened in Middle
Hurst to reach Melissia. She was mortified at what the Roman heathens had done
to the women and children. She called a meeting of her commanders.

&nbsp;

Helena was the first to speak. �NO Melissia! We cannot condone you
surrendering to that man, he is a monster.� She said tearfully.

&nbsp;

The other commanders suggested that they �all surrender, no one
woman should receive Roman punishment on her own.� Melissia however, had other
ideas.

&nbsp;

Helena and Melissia had a farewell night of unbridled passion;
tongues and fingers worked their magic in the most delicate of places. The two
girls brought each other into the erotic world of multiple orgasm, they writhed
simultaneously in each other�s arms for most of the night. Their exertions
caused their golden skin to glisten in the moonlight. Totally exhausted and
sexually sated Helena relaxed in Melissia�s arms.

&nbsp;

Helena sighed deeply and whispered to her lover, �Melissia, please
change your mind about surrendering to those Roman murderers.�

&nbsp;

Toying with a strand of Helena�s blond hair Melissia replied,
�This is the only way, my surrender will save the children.�

&nbsp;

�But Melissia,� Helena countered, �What if that cruel Tribune is
not a man of his word?� 

&nbsp;

�Then you my dear lieutenant you will have to take my stead and
wipe him and his murdering soldiers from the face of this earth!� Melissia
gripped Helena�s shoulder and shuddered at the thought of leaving her, she
whispered under her breath in Latin. �Nil illigitimus carborundum.�

&nbsp;

Helena looked puzzled, �What does that mean?�

&nbsp;

Melissia laughed, �It means, don�t let the bastards
grind you down!� Giving Helena a hug she went on. �It will take more than one
Roman Tribune and his cohorts to snuff the life out the Saxon women of this
land. Come Helena, the dawn comes we must put our plans into action, do not
fear, the gods are with us.� With that Melissia and her lieutenant dressed and
summoned the leaders of their army. 

&nbsp;

*********

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Some days later Antoninus lay in his tent unable to sleep, he
tossed and turned on his makeshift cot. The deadline for that woman to
surrender herself was almost up and he really did not want to kill the
hostages. Perhaps he had misjudged her? Perhaps she really would let them die
rather than surrender to him? He drifted off into a fitful sleep, his throat
irritated him, the constant prickle at his neck, and a musky smell of a
sexually charged woman permeated his nostrils. It all seemed so real, even the
soft whispering voice in his ear telling him to wake up. He opened his eyes,
the tickle at his throat was real, the smell of a woman was real, and here she
was in his tent with a fiendish looking sword at his neck.

&nbsp;

�Ah he wakes.� Whispered Melissia. �Just stay where you are
Tribune, else I cut you a new mouth!�

&nbsp;

�������� 
 


&nbsp;

�By the gods, how did you slip by my sentries?� he snarled,
pulling himself up on his elbows.

&nbsp;

�Move not one more inch Roman, I want to look at the man who has
been sent to capture me!� Melissia dug the point of her sword harder into the
Tribune�s neck. She ran her eyes over her quarry; his physique was outstanding,
as were his powerful arms and chest muscles. She marvelled at his incredibly
muscular thighs and the magnificent phallus that lay between them, Melissia
salivated.

&nbsp;

�So Melissia.� He had used her name for the first time, for he too
wondered at the exquisite creature that stood before him. �Are you going to
surrender to me, or kill me?� He raised a quizzical eyebrow.

&nbsp;

Melissia having devoured the Adonis before her lowered her sword.
�Yes I have come to surrender myself to you and your empire, so take me in
return for your captives, do with me what you will but spare the children.�

&nbsp;

Antoninus took the sword from her. �This is all very noble of you
Melissia but my duties regarding you are quite clear. I will keep my word and
release the hostages and you young lady have an appointment with the lash. My
centurion Drachius is a master of it; you will be whipped all the way to Nova
Magus. Then I am to save a small piece of you for the Consul!� 

&nbsp;

Melissia folded her arms across her chest, �And here�s me thinking
that it might have been something I said!�

&nbsp;

That remark earned Melissia a slap across her face; the powerful
blow sent her sprawling across the floor. Melissia wiped the blood from the
corner of her mouth, she went to get up but the Tribune stopped her by putting
his foot on her chest. 

&nbsp;

�Not so fast princess, I am not done with you yet!� Antoninus
grabbed her by the leather halter she was wearing and pulled her roughly to her
feet. 

&nbsp;

�Ever since that old man in Middle Hurst described you I have
dreamt of the day I would possess you, now that moment has come!� 

&nbsp;

With that he grabbed Melissia�s flimsy leather top and ripped it
from her chest.

&nbsp;

�By the gods, Frederick was right, your beauty surpasses you.� He
stared at Melissia�s firm breasts, his hand moved down to the chamois leather
loincloth she was wearing and tore at it eager to get to the honeyed treasure
beneath. She said nothing to him, she knew that this would happen and she
wanted it to happen ever since she laid eyes on him. His hand found her vagina
and parted the soft fleshy lips, he plunged a finger into her and then withdrew
it to examine the wetness he found there.

&nbsp;

�Ah my presence is expected, so let�s not disappoint you
Melissia!� He said in a heavily whispered voice as he pinned her down on his
map table.

&nbsp;

Melissia felt him prise her legs apart and then felt his phallus
enter her. With one very hard thrust Antoninus burst through her hymen. She
cried out more in ecstasy than pain, for his delightful meaty rod filled her to
the very limits.

&nbsp;

�Ah the rumours were true, you were a virgin princess!� Said the
Tribune as he continued to pound into her.

&nbsp;

Melissia spoke for the first time since her rape began, she looked
deeply into her assailants eyes.

&nbsp;

�Yes what a pity it has to be with a pig from Rome!� She gasped as
Antoninus� thrusts gathered momentum.

&nbsp;

�Well spoken young lady that will earn you extra time on the
whipping frame.� He panted as his tongue raped her mouth.

&nbsp;

�Better to spend more time on the whipping frame then having to
endure you between my thighs you Roman dog!� She gasped as she tried to avoid
his probing tongue then she felt the Roman reach a thundering climax.

&nbsp;

Antoninus did not reply to her derogatory comments as he was busy
emptying his seed into her. Her pelvic grip was intense, she was able to wring
every last drop from him, he had never known anyone who could do this before. 

&nbsp;

�Have you quite finished?� Melissia exclaimed as the Tribune
withdrew from her.

&nbsp;

�I shall never be finished with you young woman!� Replied
Antoninus as he poured some water into a bowl to wash the virgin blood from his
loins. 

&nbsp;

�Each night when Drachius has finished flaying your body, I shall
satisfy my lust on your body. That Melissia is my promise to you!�

&nbsp;

Melissia�s eyes flashed. �As I said before you spawn of Rome, do
with me what you will, all I ask is that you keep your promise and release the
hostages!� She stooped to retrieve the remnants of her garments.

&nbsp;

The Tribune started to dress himself. �To you I may represent all
that is evil Melissia but I am a man of my word.� Antoninus buckled up his
beautifully tooled leather breastplate. �Then after their release, your
punishment will begin.�

&nbsp;

�Very well Tribune, I thank you for that, I will gladly die for
what I believe in!� She said as she bathed her bloodied thighs.

&nbsp;

Antoninus countered. �Oh no, I will not be granting you a swift
death Melissia, you will beg me for it but I shall deny it to you. Believe me I
shall keep my word on that too!�

&nbsp;

Antoninus had his personal guards arrested and put in irons; he
was incensed that the girl had entered his command tent undetected. Their
punishment was to be a severe flogging, castration and then returned on the
galleys to Rome to serve as eunuchs.

&nbsp;

Melissia was taken to a makeshift prison cell in the town. The
sheer numbers of soldiers that were assigned as her guard flattered her. She
had been stripped naked and suspended by her wrists to a beam in the ceiling.
As the joints in her shoulders burned she reflected on the fate that awaited
her. Nova Magus and the Roman Consul were three days march away. That meant at
least three sessions under Drachius� whip plus whatever they were going to do to
her this day. Her loins still ached from the Tribune�s violent administrations
and with the promise of more to come caused her flush.

&nbsp;

Melissia was paid a visit by the centurions Drachius, Marcellus
and Drusus. The three men were equally as powerful in physique as Antoninus.

&nbsp;

Drachius spoke first. �So this little girl is the one that has
been causing so much trouble?� He stood squarely in front of Melissia and
unleashed an incredibly hard slap to her face. Her head snapped back from the
force of it and blood flowed freely from her nose and mouth.

&nbsp;

�And that little girl is just my hand, imagine if you will what my
lash will do to you.� He stood back awaiting her response.

&nbsp;

&quot;Ah
yes�.Roman rhetoric. I've studied Greek, and recall that this was the classic
Roman response to Philosophy. You are a strong man Drachius but your blows lack
the force of logic&quot;. 

&nbsp;

Livid,
Drachius held Melissa by the hair and pulled back his massive fist. Antoninus
had entered the cell unseen and gripped the centurion�s arm.

&nbsp;

&quot;That will do for now - we want her to feel your expert
attentions. And I will visit you later Melissia, to give you my
attentions�.&quot; 

&nbsp;

&quot;I
notice you didn't say 'expert' attentions.� Melissa added, audibly, under her
breath.

&nbsp;

He turned and went outside to breath in the air of the fresh dawn;
the girl troubled him as he reflected.

&nbsp;

He must
faithfully discharge his commission to punish her, taking her before the Consul
humble and powerless. This could be done; it would be like overcoming the
natural fear all men felt before battle. The witch had undoubted power but she
would be no match for a Roman Officer.

&nbsp;

When
their eyes had met he was, despite all this, unprepared for the force of it. He
felt almost dizzy. Her taste was in his mouth; her intoxicating scent in his
nostrils - the sound of her voice flogged him: &quot;You are wrong again Roman.
I am willing to die but will never beg you for it. Torture is the only example
of Roman artistic originality so I expect to be tortured. But remember well the
circumstances of our meeting. And know that on the next occasion I will not
restrain my blade&quot;.

&nbsp;

Oh yes
she troubled him immensely, maybe he would snap out of it when her punishment
began. Antoninus ordered that all available soldiers be assembled in the town
square. The carpenter knocked together a formidable whipping frame that would
stretch the girl to her very limits. It was designed so that she would not be
able to flinch from the lash. Having caught a brief glimpse of her it had
become a labour of love to build such a fiendish device.

&nbsp;

When all
were assembled Melissia was brought out into the strong morning sunlight. Her
naked body glistened as the sun bounced off her delectable skin. 

&nbsp;

She
walked with the grace of a young gazelle to the foreboding frame. �Please don�t
let them see you tremble.� She had thought to herself.

&nbsp;

On her arrival at the frame two soldiers stepped forward and
manhandled Melissia into position. Leather straps were tightened about her
wrists and ankles. The wrist straps were attached to an overhead beam on the
frame; this beam could then be raised and lowered according to how much the
occupant of the frame needed to be stretched. The straps about her ankles were
fastened to the upright posts either side of her body. Now in this position she
formed a perfect X. The beam was raised by a winding mechanism and stretched
Melissia so tightly that her joints in her arms, legs and back screamed out in
protest.

&nbsp;

Drachius stepped out from the front ranks of the assembled
soldiers carrying one of his many assorted whips. He was stripped to the waist
and Melissia could see every detail of his well-formed muscle structure. The
man was a superb athletic specimen.

&nbsp;

�At the behest of my commanding officer I am to use a light weight
whip on you little girl. You see the Tribune wants to deliver you to the Consul
in one piece. This situation will enable me to whip you for a very long time
without killing you. I can tell you now that all this makes me very happy and
of course light whips cause so much more pain and agony than the heavy ones!�
Drachius cracked the whip right under Melissia�s nose to gain a reaction from
her.

&nbsp;

�Well,� she replied, �if I can bring a little happiness into your
pathetic life then so be it, I do hope it doesn�t tickle, I would really hate
that!� She looked straight into the centurion�s cruel eyes to gauge his
reaction to her remark.

&nbsp;

�Goad me all you want little girl, for you will dance for me this
very day and your screams will be music to my ears!� 

&nbsp;

Drachius put his hand between Melissia�s legs and fingered her
vagina. 

&nbsp;

�Ah so you think being flogged will give you a sexual thrill do
you?� Continued the centurion as he examined the moisture on his fingers.

&nbsp;

�Better your whip centurion than a ministering from your phallus!�
She held his gaze and could see her remark incensed him.

&nbsp;

Drachius had enough of these verbal jousts and turned to his
Tribune for the signal to commence this sharp-tongued vixens punishment.

&nbsp;

�Lay it on Drachius, I will tell you when to stop!� Antoninus
waved his hand as a signal to start.

&nbsp;

Drachius looked at her superbly well-muscled back and decided to
start carving a criss-cross of welts on what was to him a blank canvas. His
first lash landed squarely across her shoulders and drew a sharp intake of
breath from her; he felt a surge of passion as her muscles started to spasm
under the shock of the impact.

&nbsp;

To Melissia the pain was more intense than she could have possibly
imagined. 

&nbsp;

Before she could draw breath the next blow landed in the small of
her back, this produced a small stifled sob from her. After the next six she
felt that her skin was on fire, the tightness of her restraints increased her
agony even more. Sweat started to run down her outstretched body, she bit into
her lower lip in an effort to try and not scream.

&nbsp;

Drachius was indeed a very accomplished master of the whip as
after 18 strokes most of Melissia�s back, buttocks and legs were covered in
angry red welts. Antoninus noted that her bladder had emptied as a result of
the intense pain and fear she was feeling at this dreadful moment in time. He
admired her spirit; her efforts not to cry out were commendable but as the
blows continued Drachius had started to extract shrill screams and sobs from
her. The Tribune saw how she curled up her toes and balled her fists in a vain
effort to gain some sort of control over herself.

&nbsp;

Melissia inwardly prayed for the blessed relief of unconsciousness
as the incessant blows continued to flay her body. After Drachius had delivered
his 30th lash a black veil drew across her eyes, Melissia fell into the arms of
Morpheus.

&nbsp;

�That�s enough for now Drachius, anymore will not be felt!� The
Tribune stepped forward and drew a halt to the proceedings. �Take her down and
return her to her cell!� he shouted to the two guards that were stationed each
side of the frame. Antoninus watched as his men carried Melissia�s unconscious
body back to her confinement. He thought how well she had taken her punishment,
Melissia never failed to amaze him. That night he decided to tend to her wounds
personally.

&nbsp;

The soldiers carried Melissia�s limp body back to her cell. There
they placed her face down on a makeshift wooden rack, securing her arms and
feet to the four corners. They examined their centurion�s handy work with
pride, running their hands over her back and buttocks and legs, feeling and
stroking the inflamed patchwork of raised red welts on her skin.

&nbsp;

�I must give Drachius credit for his expertise.� Said the first
soldier. �These patterns are superb, he made her scream so much I very nearly
ejaculated�.

&nbsp;

�Me to,� replied the second soldier. �What a superb body this girl
has, do you think we could take her, right here, right now? I am so aroused.�
He then started to massage his swollen phallus.

&nbsp;

�I think not, she belongs to the Tribune, we would take her place
on that whipping frame if he found out we had ravaged her!� Replied the first
soldier. �We had best leave her untouched!� With that the two soldiers went and
stood guard outside dreaming of what might have been.

&nbsp;&nbsp;

As he stood over her she began to stir. �Melissia it�s me,
Antoninus!� He could not believe how softly he was speaking to her; she truly
had a remarkable affect on him.

&nbsp;

Melissia groaned, her voice cracked and broken from screaming so
much. �Forgive me if I don�t stand.� 

&nbsp;

As full consciousness returned to her she became aware of the
intense pain she was feeling all over her back, buttocks and thighs. 

&nbsp;

�Your centurion truly does enjoy his work Tribune, does my skin
glow to your satisfaction?�

&nbsp;

Antoninus knelt down beside her and removed the lid on the jar of
balm he had brought with him and replied in a whispered voice.

&nbsp;

�I have something that will sooth your pain Melissia.� 

&nbsp;

Melissia said nothing as she felt the first cold administration of
the creamy unguent that the Tribune applied to a large welt that snaked
diagonally from her right shoulder to the small of her back. The balm brought
blessed relief to her suffering as Antoninus continued to apply it to her
tortured body. For a big man he had a gentle touch and Melissia relished it.
She felt his hand move in between her buttocks and felt his finger as it probed
her petal like entrance. The balm tingled as he massaged it into her anus; the
Tribune noted her audible gasp as he fingered her.

&nbsp;

�What are you doing?� She sighed unable to resist the sensation
she was feeling. Melissia was totally at the mercy of the Tribune�s
administrations.

&nbsp;

�I am now going to give you my �expert attention� Melissia!� He
said as he released his ample phallus from his loincloth. 

&nbsp;

�I will take you the Roman way!� 

&nbsp;

With that he entered her anus, Melissia tried to let out a howl of
protest but her voice and sexual cravings dampened her will to scream and
resist this strange assault. She clenched her fists and curled her toes as she
felt the Tribunes fleshy manhood slide into her most forbidden place. It was an
exquisite pain she felt as he continued to ravage her. The feeling of his
phallus inside her plus the incredible sensation of the magic balm brought her
to an incredibly powerful orgasm. To add to her raptures the Tribune had
reached under her abdomen and sort out the engorged bud at the entrance to her
vagina. As soon as Melissia felt his touch on that erotically charged nub
multiple orgasmic waves shot up from between her legs and exploded through her
breasts, only ceasing their rippling journey at the tips of her hardened
nipples.

&nbsp;

At that very moment she felt the Tribune convulse and empty his seed
inside her. She found herself whispering. �Et tu Antoninus?�

&nbsp;

The next morning Melissia awoke to noise and activity outside her
cell. As she slowly came round her guards came in, released her from the rack
and dragged her outside. She could see columns of soldiers preparing to leave
the town. 

&nbsp;

Drachius approached her. �Ah I see you have recovered from our
last encounter?�

&nbsp;

�Yes!� Replied Melissia, �It is very difficult to keep a good
woman down!� She held her head aloof and looked down her nose at him.

&nbsp;

Drachius scoffed at her and ordered that she be tethered behind
the leading cart.

&nbsp;

�You will walk to Nova Magus as naked as the day you were born
little girl and if you trip and fall then we will drag you there!� He laughed
as he turned to mount his horse.

&nbsp;

Just as the column was about to set off a lone rider appeared
riding at great speed. Melissia watched as he dismounted and approached the
Tribune. She saw Antoninus summon his centurions and after some discussion
noted the growing agitation in them. Antoninus broke away from the group and
came over to her.

&nbsp;

He towered over her and shouted at her. �It would appear that the
women and children I sent to the galleys have disappeared along with my
soldiers, would this have anything to do with your army?�

&nbsp;

Melissia glared into his blazing eyes and replied. �I am no longer
in command of my army, they will have a new leader by now and it would appear
they are making a very good job of it!� She flared her nostrils at him and held
his gaze.

&nbsp;

The Tribune gave Melissia a heavy slap across the face that sent
her sprawling on the ground. She pulled herself up onto one elbow and wiped the
blood from the corner of her mouth. 

&nbsp;

�I take it you are not too happy about that then?� 

&nbsp;

Antoninus pulled her roughly to her feet. �I�ll show you how happy
I am girl!� he bellowed as he beckoned to three nearby soldiers. �Take her to
the ironmongers shop now!� he continued.

&nbsp;

The soldiers dragged Melissia into an opened sided building at the
end of the street. The building contained a hot ironmongers forge, she felt the
heat from it as she was pushed inside.

&nbsp;

�Secure her to that beam!� Shouted the Tribune.

&nbsp;

Very quickly Melissia found herself with her hands and arms tied
above her head and with her feet and ankles spread and securely bound to beams
either side of her. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

This turn of events disturbed her very much, staring at the
burning forge she knew she was in for even more serious torture. Sweat ran down
her gleaming torso, more from fear than anything else.

&nbsp;

The three centurions seething with anger joined Antoninus at the
forge.

&nbsp;

�I need to know what your army plans to do next Melissia? Speak
now and avoid this interrogation by branding!� He pushed a long bladed knife
into the hot coals and pumped the bellows several times.

&nbsp;

Trying to hide her nervousness Melissia replied. �As I said
earlier, I am no longer their leader, branding me will not change anything!�

&nbsp;

�We shall see, Melissia, we shall see!� The Tribune withdrew the
knife from the forge and examined the glowing blade as he approached the woman
spread before him.

&nbsp;

He held the burning hot blade in front of Melissia�s face; she
just stared at it transfixed. She closed her eyes tightly to protect her eyes
from the searing heat. Without any further hesitation Antoninus applied the glowing
blade to the soft skin on the inside of her left thigh and held it there. Her
soft sweat soaked skin made a sizzling sound and Melissia�s piercing screams
could be heard throughout the town.

&nbsp;

�Yes Melissia the pain is beyond belief is it not and I will not
be done with you until you tell me what I want to know!� The Tribune put the
knife back into the forge. Preparing it for the next kiss on her writhing body.

&nbsp;

The Tribune placed the red-hot blade against the inside of
Melissia�s right thigh producing another even shriller scream of agony from
her. He held the blade against her tortured thigh for several seconds and
watched her buck and writhe desperately in a futile effort to avoid the hideous
burning pain between her legs.

&nbsp;

Antoninus had to shout to make himself heard above Melissia�s
uncontrollable sobbing. 

&nbsp;

�Ah little princess this is so much more painful than the lash is
it not? Please, tell me what I want to know and I will end your torment!� The
Tribune noted a pleading look in the girl�s eyes. �Yes you really do want to
tell me something don�t you?� He went on.

&nbsp;

Melissia spoke through agonised sobs. � Li�.li�listen to me you
Roman filth, it would not have been difficult to predict your movements once I
was in your custody. My lieutenants have been trained well in Roman tactics and
are correctly guessing your every move. They do not need me to tell them how to
do that!� 

&nbsp;

�And may I assume we may be visited by them between here and Nova
Magus?� He replied quizzically.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Melissia�s courage returned. �You can assume what you will
Tribune, I am dispensable, they will attack you when and wherever necessary, my
being your prisoner will not deter them. The destruction of you and your cohort
is inevitable.� She held is gaze delighting in his quandary.

&nbsp;

�Then we will proceed by another route, thank you Melissia for
making it so obvious to me. What a pity I had to mark those wonderful thighs. I
will get the apothecary to make up a lotion for you.� With that he plunged the
hot blade into a nearby bucket of water, Melissia breathed a sigh of relief.

&nbsp;

The Tribune and his three centurions left Melissia with her guards
and went to make alternative arrangements for their journey to Nova Magua. The
guards released her from the beams and pinned her down on some nearby straw
bales. They brutally spread her legs, groped her at her breasts and plunged
their fingers into her vaginal folds.

&nbsp;

�You seem to have lost our Tribune�s favour girl, seeing you
branded like that has made me very excited indeed.� Scowled the first soldier. 

&nbsp;

With that he withdrew his swollen member from his tunic and
started to pleasure himself. His two colleagues continued to grope Melissia�s
tortured body. In what seemed like seconds he emptied his semen all over her
abdomen.

&nbsp;

�Thank the gods you are not my lover!� Croaked Melissia wearily.
The remark earned her another slap to her face. 

&nbsp;

�Oh please wash your hands before you do that again!� She
continued deridingly.

&nbsp;

In a few short minutes the remaining two guards emptied their
scrotal contents onto her face and breasts.

&nbsp;

�Well, you pagan whore all your skin is worthy of is to be a
receptacle for our ejaculate!� Exclaimed the second guard as he slapped her
face again. �I sincerely hope I will be your guard when you are dragged before
the Consul!�

&nbsp;

�Yes of course.� Replied Melissia. �All friends should stick
together should they not? And talking about sticking I would like to wash your
filth from my body!� She continued haughtily.

&nbsp;

The first guard was about to slap her again when Antoninus walked
in. �That will do! Let her up and get out! He bellowed at his three soldiers as
they hurriedly left the forge.

&nbsp;

The pain was so intense between Melissia�s thighs she could not
stand. The Tribune walked over to her prone body and stood over her. 

&nbsp;

�Well now, I leave you alone for just a few minutes and as soon as
my back is turned I find you titillating my men, shame on you.� Antoninus�
humour had returned; he felt he was in control of the situation once more. 

&nbsp;

�Yes, that was some party, what a shame you missed it!� Agonised
Melissia trying to get to her feet.

&nbsp;

The Tribune noted the ejaculate covering her belly and breasts. 

&nbsp;

�Did they penetrate you?� He asked looking on with some concern.

&nbsp;

Melissia scoffed at him. �Huh! Why should you care? They were just
playing follow my leader!� She finally managed to stand up. 

&nbsp;

Antoninus examined her bruised face. �That insolent tongue of
yours will be torn out one of these days believe me! Now go wash yourself and
apply some of this to your burns.� 

&nbsp;

He handed her a small earthenware jar and pointed to a large water
trough in the corner of the shop. Melissia snatched it from him and went to
attend her burnt and bruised body.

&nbsp;

While Melissia attended to her wounds and washed herself another
messenger arrived outside. This time it was good news for the Tribune. Two more
cohorts were approaching from the north, these would swell his army to 900 men,
he was jubilant.

&nbsp;

�Let them try and rescue her now� he thought to himself.

&nbsp;

While Antoninus waited for the reinforcements to arrive new men
were posted to guard Melissia. They were warned not to violate her in any way
and to do so would bring swift retribution from the Tribune.

&nbsp;

The moment the reinforcements arrived Antoninus called a war
council with the nine centurions who were now under his command. He informed
them that he expected Melissia�s warrior army to ambush them somewhere between
here and Nova Magus. Therefore, he wanted the extra troops to perform a sweep
to the south and north of the road all the way to the city. Antoninus was
confident that with three cohorts he could repel any form of attack or rescue
attempt from the pagan women. He advised his new officers how the prisoner had
told him she was dispensable and how he himself thought very differently.

&nbsp;

So the advanced reconnaissance force was sent out, the remaining
forces were to proceed with all speed to Nova Magus. Drachius was informed that
the first stop would be short and subsequently there would be no time to put
Melissia to the lash for a second time. The centurion could barely hide his
anger, he felt sure his commanding officer was softening toward the girl. With
that in mind he decided that the quicker she was taken before the Consul the
better.

&nbsp;

Melissia hardly noticed the general noise from the gathering troops
outside her cell. She busily applied the lotion that the apothecary had mixed
for her. 

&nbsp;

On first application it seemed to cause her even more pain but
after an hour it brought here blessed relief. She silently thanked the unknown
person who concocted this magical balm. 

&nbsp;

The guard that was stationed at the end of her cot spoke out. �You
will need a lot of that unguent when the Consul has done with you girl!� He
said, laughing at his own jocularity.

The guard remembering his Tribune�s warning, suppressed his urge
to slap her but retorted. �Curse me all you want for now little girl but heed
this. It is we who will break you and your kin and it is you who will dance to
the tune of the Consul�s painful torture and it is I who will be the first in
line to nail you to the cross when he is done with you!�

&nbsp;

Melissia finished tending her wounds and looked up at her
tormentor. �And I promise you soldier that it will be you and your kind who
will dance on the end of a pagan sword, that is my solemn promise to you and
the rest of your murdering kinsmen!�

&nbsp;

Before the guard could make a further reply a sentry came in and
gave an order for Melissia to be taken outside. She was astounded when she saw
how many Roman soldiers had arrived. Drachius appeared from one of the nearby
groups, he grabbed her tightly by the arm and lead her to his horse.

&nbsp;

Melissia was intrigued. �Am I not to be dragged to Nova Magus
then?� she said haughtily trying to break away from the centurions vice like
grip.

&nbsp;

Drachius gave her a cuff to the head. �I have no more time for
your verbal jousts woman, we are to proceed with all speed, your dalliances
will not be tolerated at this time!� With that he threw her over his horse.

&nbsp;

The centurion then climbed up behind her and joined the column
with Melissia protesting vehemently about her exposed position across Drachius�
saddle. She looked around for Antoninus but he was far away at the head of the
line of troops.

&nbsp;

�Any more noise from you little girl and I will punish these
resplendent buttocks that rise up so nicely before me!� Melissia�s anger worsened
as she heard Drachius laughing at her predicament.

&nbsp;

They rode hard all day and well into the night, finally just
before midnight they made camp. Melissia�s head spun from the buffeting she
received whilst laying across Drachius� saddle. Her chest and ribs ached
unbearably and she had no doubt that was the centurion�s intention. He pulled
her off his horse took out some leather twine, strapped her arms behind her
back and tied her ankles together. Four soldiers were assigned to guard her
while he went to see his Tribune.

&nbsp;

Antoninus saw him coming and noted the anger in the Drachius�
face. 

&nbsp;

�What is it Drachius?� He asked, wondering what had angered his
favourite centurion and friend so much.

&nbsp;

Drachius looked at his leader squarely in the eyes. 

&nbsp;

�Tell me Tribune, are you in love with her, has she managed to
dazzle you with those doe eyes of hers?� He searched Antoninus� face for an
answer to his question.

&nbsp;

�By the gods no Drachius, she has stirred my loins on occasion but
no she has not captivated me.� He went to dismiss his centurion.

&nbsp;

�Prove it!� Replied Drachius, �Prove to me that there is not more
to this situation!� Still continuing to search his leaders face.

&nbsp;

�And how should I do that Drachius?� This questioning from his
subordinate troubled him.

&nbsp;

�You promised I could put her under the lash each and every night
on our way to the city!� The centurion held his stare.

&nbsp;

�Yes, Drachius I did but���

&nbsp;

The centurion interrupted him. 

&nbsp;

�You can prove to me there is nothing between the two of you
Tribune, let me put her to the lash tonight. Then tomorrow we can present her
to the Consul with a beautiful set of fresh stripes!� Drachius waited for the
compromise.

&nbsp;

Antoninus did feel he was compromised and searched his thoughts
for a solution that would spare Melissia this extra punishment before her
arrival at Nova Magus. Drachius� argument was strong and before he could stop
himself the Tribune heard himself giving the order for the girl to be lashed
immediately.

&nbsp;

Melissia was lying uncomfortably on some leafy ground under a
large oak tree and her four guards were staring at her nakedness. She was in
too much pain to goad them this night and simply glared back at them. She had
been denied the lotion given to her earlier and now the burns to her inner
thighs began to cause her more distress.

&nbsp;

She heard Drachius approach and give orders for her to be strung
up to a branch above her head. 

&nbsp;

�What are you doing?� She protested vehemently, trying in vain to
struggle against the strength of the four soldiers as they manhandled her. 

&nbsp;

�The Tribune said I was not to be whipped this night!� She went
on.

&nbsp;

Drachius gripped her throat. 

&nbsp;

�That is where you are wrong little girl!� Tonight will be just
for you, me, these four soldiers and this!� The centurion held out a whip in
front of Melissia�s face and laughed, as did the four guards. 

&nbsp;

The branch of the tree had been pulled down to meet Melissia�s
outstretch arms. Each of her ankles were secured to a stake in the ground. Then
the branch was released stretching her body taut. Melissia made a delightful
spectacle, the sheen of her light brown body, her distended ribs topped off by
her exquisite breasts. This vision had caused delirious swellings in the groins
of her tormentors.

&nbsp;

The guards drew back to give Drachius space to weald his whip.
Melissia�s eyes flashed defiance at the whipmaster daring him to do his worst. 

&nbsp;

�Tonight is your punishment for all the insults you have hurled at
my men and myself these past few days you little heathen. And do not look to
your Tribune to rescue you from this one, he himself ordered this!� The
centurion uncoiled the whip.

&nbsp;

Melissia�s mind was in turmoil, she had not expected any more
whippings before the ordeal she would surely endure at Nova Magus. What had
changed the Tribune�s mind since yesterday? Her body was already racked with
pain and now she was to suffer even more. Melissia snapped out of her thoughts
as Drachius landed the first lash squarely across both her breasts catching the
tip of one nipple. Breath flew out of her and she gave a stifled sob, the pain
radiated down from her chest and into her abdomen. She struggled against her
bonds to no avail; she was totally at the mercy of the powerful centurion who
was relishing every moment of her anguish.

&nbsp;

As she was getting her breath back from the first lash another
landed across her abdomen, this blow produced an even louder sob from her. The
tip of the whip had snaked around her hip and raised a painful welt to the top
of her left buttock joining the other marks from her previous encounter with
Drachius and his dreaded whip. Melissia tried in vain to ride the torturous
blows of the lash but she was suspended so tightly all her efforts were futile.
Lash after lash rained down on her writhing body, producing tormented screams
from Melissia, her breasts, ribs, abdomen and thighs now bore a criss-cross of
painful welts, she prayed for unconsciousness. 

&nbsp;

Antoninus lay on his cot trying to shut out Melissia�s screams of
agony. His mind was in torment, Drachius� words went round and round in his
head. Was he right? Has this Pagan Princess captivated him? Again Melissia�s
shrill screams tortured his ears, the incessant crack of Drachius� whip as it
found the girls soft flesh caused him to wince. After what seemed like an
eternity Melissia�s screams ceased but the whipping continued.

&nbsp;

Drachius goaded by the four guards continued to flog Melissia�s
unconscious body. She just hung from the tightly sprung tree branch, her body
bathed in sweat and bearing a patchwork of welts from her neck down to her
ankles. Her head hung to one side clearly not feeling anything now.

&nbsp;

�CEASE THIS AT ONCE!� The Tribune bellowed at his centurion,
grabbing the trailing whip and pulling it from Drachius� grip. �Can you not see
she is no longer feeling your blows Drachius?� 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The centurion was incensed by his leaders interference and replied
through gritted teeth.

&nbsp;

�As I said before Tribune, we would do well to present her to the
Consul with a fine set of crimson welts!�

&nbsp;

Antoninus replied angrily. �And would you care to experience the
Consul�s wrath if we presented him with a dead body?� The Tribune raised a
quizzical eyebrow to his centurion.

&nbsp;

Drachius conceded that maybe his leader was correct and ordered
for Melissia to be taken down. �Yes Tribune you a right, I think she has
learned an important lesson today and that is she cannot insult my men and
myself and not receive retribution!�

&nbsp;

Antoninus put his hand on his centurion�s shoulder. �Drachius she
will receive all the retribution Rome can offer once she is put before the
Consul, mark my words well.�

&nbsp;

Drachius headed his words. �Then let us proceed with all speed
when day breaks Tribune, I feel her army may not be far away, we could do well
without their interference!�

&nbsp;

Later that night Melissia awoke in a delirium, she drifted in and
out of consciousness and her head swam as she felt constant rising nausea. This
latest session under the lash had been brutal, she felt close to death. Every
part of her body cried out in stinging pain, the burns to the insides of her thighs
gave out agonising pulses of heat. Rivulets of perspiration ran off her skin as
she thrashed about in agony. 

&nbsp;

The Tribune had given orders for her to be placed inside one of
his command tents and had doubled the guard on her. He was troubled by the deterioration
in her health, troubled by his feelings for her and most of all, troubled that
she seemed to be dieing. It did not bother him now what the Consul would think
if presented with a dead prisoner, now he was bothered about Melissia. His mind
was in turmoil, he felt like a traitor to Rome allowing this woman to take over
his very being; he felt she had possessed him.

&nbsp;

Antoninus sent for his personal physician to attend Melissia. The
physician wondered how anyone could inflict these terrible things to such a
beautiful creature as the one laid out before him. Lovingly he covered her body
with cold damp compresses in an effort to bring down the consuming fever that
was burning within her. The physician informed the Tribune what he did not want
to hear, that the girl was near death.

&nbsp;

�She is in deep shock Tribune.� Said the physician, looking
genuinely concerned for his patient. �I will give her a potion that will put
her into a deep sleep, her body needs to recover and must not be troubled by
consciousness. Her survival will rest upon her own will to live.� 

&nbsp;

�Thank you.� Said Antoninus �I value your skill, I think this
woman�s will to live will surpass all our expectations, I have no doubt about
that. It is a pity however, that our efforts may be in vain as the Consul has
plans to torture her to death should she survive this trauma!� The Tribune
watched as his physician administered his potion and then dismissed him. 

&nbsp;

Antoninus mopped Melissia�s fevered brow, his heart sank to see
her like this and he felt he had been instrumental in destroying a thing of
beauty. Even near death she brought out intense desire and lust in him. 

&nbsp;

�May the gods strike me down if you die Melissia.� He whispered
under his breath.

&nbsp;

Melissia opened her eyes and tried to focus through the red mist. 

&nbsp;

In a broken voice she said. �G..gi..give me your sword Tribune and
I will spare your gods that task.� With that she drifted into total
unconsciousness.

&nbsp;

Antoninus� heart seemed to leap from his chest when she spoke. He
replied to the sleeping enchantress before him. 

&nbsp;

�You brave brave young woman, it seems nothing can dampen your
spirit. If you survive this I will gladly give you my sword so that you may
extinguish the life from me.� His words fell on deaf ears as Melissia slid into
the darkest of voids.

&nbsp;

The Tribune stayed with her the entire night, lovingly mopping her
body, applying lotion to her welts and burns totally transfixed by her beauty.

&nbsp;

The next morning Antoninus awoke to loud trumpeting sounds coming
from the edge of the camp. Bleary-eyed he went outside and was met by his
general Honorius Plexus complete with fifty men of the Consul�s personal guard.
He saluted his general and took him inside the command tent to see his captive.

&nbsp;

The general gazed at the unconscious girl. �It would seem you have
done the Consul�s work for him Antoninus?�

&nbsp;

The Tribune shuffled uncomfortably. �She was impudent and loose
tongued, she goaded my men with derisory remarks. I felt certain punishments
were in order General.�

&nbsp;

�Quite so Antoninus, in your position I would have done the same.�


&nbsp;

Honorius looked more closely at Melissia. �She looks so innocent
like this, hard to imagine this little girl leading an army of savage warrior
women, why there is nothing of her.� 

&nbsp;

Antoninus� confidence grew. �She has been trained well Honorius,
she and her army have learned our battle tactics and she speaks several tongues
fluently, including our own.�

&nbsp;

The general raised his eyebrows and ran his fingers over the
girl�s skin feeling the array of raised welts on her abdomen. Honorius
salivated. �Magnificent specimen of womanhood Tribune, if she lives we must
quiz her as to who her teacher was. Whomever it is they are a danger to Rome
and must be brought to task as quickly as possible.�

&nbsp;

Eager to please his general Antoninus replied. �Then we must hope
the girl lives so that we may question her more thoroughly.�

&nbsp;

�Yes indeed Tribune!� The general nodded enthusiastically. 

&nbsp;

�I will arrange for her to be transferred by litter for the
remainder of the journey to Nova Magus. Then whilst there she will be nursed
back to health so that she can face an inquisition.�

&nbsp;

*******

&nbsp;

Petronius Arius looked down on the prisoner who had just arrived
and was lost in his thoughts.

&nbsp;

�How could this whelp of a girl have caused so much grief? Here
before him was the torn and bloodied body of a pagan girl born of a Saxon King
and Queen. Because of her injuries he failed to see the former beauty of the
girl. He dearly wanted to know how she acquired her fighting and strategy
skills and how it came about that she knew so much of Roman battle tactics?� So
many questions remained unanswered.

&nbsp;

He wanted to know the name of her tutor, for this tutor was
initially responsible for all the carnage that had ensued to this very day. He
vowed in his mind that he would extract this information by every means
possible from this flayed and bloodied pup that lay before him. 

&nbsp;

The Consul sent for his personal physician and ordered that he
attend to this very �special� prisoner. �I want her brought back to the very
pinnacle of health!� He ordered. �I cannot have her expiring on me at the very
first question.�

&nbsp;

The Consuls physician surveyed his task, laying before him on a
crude cot in the cell assigned to her was the bruised and torn body of
Melissia. The physician looked upon the handiwork of Drachius with utter
dismay. For he was a man who liked to heal people and he could not comprehend
how one human being could inflict such suffering on another. Now here he was,
ordered to heal this bruised, bloodied and battered creature. So once again
they could torture and mutilate her. He felt like administering a poison so she
would be spared the ordeal that lay ahead of her. Then again it would be he who
would take her place if she should die in his keeping, he thought better of it.

&nbsp;

As the days passed Melissia started to come out of her delirium,
her head still swam and she felt for one fleeting moment that the handmaiden
swabbing her fevered brow was her lieutenant, Helena. 

&nbsp;

For the physician, healing Melissia had become a labour of love as
the true beauty of his patient began to blossom once more. He dismissed the
handmaiden and carried on with the mopping of Melissia�s brow. 

&nbsp;

�That girl.� Whispered Melissia in a trembled voice. �Who is she,
I know her do I not?�

&nbsp;

The physician put a finger to his lips and urged her not to speak.

&nbsp;

�Rest little lady, do not worry yourself with the identity of
handmaidens, they are of no importance.�

&nbsp;

�But, but��I know her.� She insisted.

&nbsp;

�You cannot know her Melissia, how could you? She is nothing but a
palace slave.�

&nbsp;

Melissia lay back and cooed at the delicate touch of this
wonderfully kind and gentle man. �You have tended me for days now and I do not
even know your name, what is it?�

&nbsp;

�It is of no consequence Melissia but if you must know it is
Ithicus.�

&nbsp;

�So Ithicus�..� Trilled Melissia. �What is to become of me? Shall
I make a guess?�

&nbsp;

The physician�s brow furled.�
�Let us not speak of it now little lady, we must make you well.�

&nbsp;

�For what?� Countered Melissia. �So that I can be put to the
question, so once again I will be the cruel sport of those cruel centurions. So
my flesh can be torn from my bones, is that your desire?� 

&nbsp;

Melissia�s questions were relentless and Ithicus had no answer for
her. �Worry not Ithicus, I do not hold you responsible for my current
predicament. If it were not for my desire for vengeance neither of us would be
in this position now, I do not place any blame on you.�

&nbsp;

�Oh what a noble creature you are Melissia, indeed you are the
Princess of all Princesses and I feel nothing but utter contempt for myself for
being the coward that I am.� A tear trickled down from the corner of Ithicus�
eye.

&nbsp;

Melissia reached up and wiped the tear away. �You are no coward
Ithicus, you are simply a man doing his duty, nothing more nothing less.� With
that Melissia drifted back into a fitful sleep.

&nbsp;

Melissia finally screamed. It was different from the sound torn
from her under torture -- deep, throaty, insistently alive. On her third scream
a name was almost torn from her. She began to cry out Helena's name, for it had
only been from her beloved that she had felt such transcendent pleasure.
Melissia stifled the cry, instantly perceiving the risk. Through the miasma of
her rapture, she dimly perceived a foreshadowing. They would spare no effort to
force her to scream out names under much different circumstances. 

She chuckled to herself; Ithicus had given her practice at being
tight-lipped under such circumstances.

&nbsp;

She thought of Helena. Her body and soul shook simultaneously, in
perfect rhythm. She kept the vision of Helena before her. She wondered, for a
split instant whether that vision would sustain her under the torture to come.
Then her universe split; only impossibly intense pleasure remained. She had
experienced so much sensation since presenting herself at the camp, but she had
not imagined this sensation. She screamed one, final, endless time as Ithicus'
expertise in her intimate geography fiendishly prolonged her now convulsive
pleasure. She swooned - not in and out of consciousness, but in and out of an
enhanced consciousness a higher place of purpose clarity certainty. In the
final seconds, he tested her capacity for pleasure and she passed the test --
almost killing him in the process as she bucked and writhed, and wrapped her
powerfully athletic legs around him. Then -- perfect peace; the convulsions
becoming delicious shudders; the ecstasy coming back unexpectedly in waves and
then even more delightful ripples, long after she thought it should have
passed.

&nbsp;

Ithicus lingered in her most private place, relishing it as the
supreme goal of manhood to explore and service those incomparable inches. In
the course of perfecting his craft he had visited inhospitable regions.
Melissia was paradise. Defying his physician's craft, he had long since learned
that every inch of her invited, seduced, and rewarded the explorer. He slowly
disengaged; kissing his way to her mouth; inhaling her musk and flicking off
her sweet sweat with his still dexterous tongue. As he approached her mouth,
Melissia roughly took hold of his face with strong fingers and kissed him
deeply, urgently. Now it was her turn to put her tongue to work and she did so
with superhuman skill. 

&nbsp;

Several minutes later Melissia sighed with perfect contentment,
she smiled and pointed to Ithicus' throbbing -- flopping might have been the
better term -- phallus. 

&nbsp;

&quot;I can help you with that thing. He needs some
attention&quot;.

&nbsp;

&quot;I am the physician here Melissia. You will take my
prescriptions.�

&nbsp;

&quot;And so you have healed me&quot;. She stretched. The blanket
fell from her. He gasped at her perfect beauty; rippling muscles; taut abdomen.
With her eyes, she invited him to devour her with his. She flicked his leg
playfully with one curled foot. Some scars remained visible, but Melissia had
somehow appropriated them to enhance her beauty. The traces of torture only underscored
her strength; the lines decorating and not vandalizing her unique architecture.
She continued:

&nbsp;

&quot;I am perfectly healthy now, protected from their inquisition
only by your lies.&quot; She laughed affectionately. &quot;You are a fraud,
Ithicus&quot;. A frown crossed her brow. &quot;I will not have you risking
yourself like that dear friend&quot;.

&nbsp;

He fought back a sob. &quot;How can I hand such perfection,&quot;
he gestured helplessly at the body that had so exceeded his most outrageous
expectations of the human form -- &quot;over to their torturers. Unless
--&quot;

&nbsp;

Melissia cut him off. &quot;We've had this discussion
before.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;But wait -- Antoninus has been working on the Proconsul.
This would not be the first time a foreign foe had been turned to their use.
There is opposition to be sure -- you killed many Romans. But if you give them
their names; sign what they want you to sign; it could be months before they
decide what to do with you. I want to pleasure you. I want to capture your form
in my sculpture. I want --&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Sweet Ithicus, if I do what they want then my form is
hollow. Do not disappoint me -- you of all people. I love my body too, but it
is a shell. You love my will and my choices and if I choose as you say, my
beauty will fade whatever use is made of that shell.&quot;

&nbsp;

He averted his eyes. He knew she was right. Was she too good for
this world? He shuddered for her. He would die for her.

&nbsp;

She read his thoughts. &quot;No, my loving little man. I will not
let you sacrifice yourself for me. But now -- let's put this body to good use,
while we still have it to play with&quot;. She smiled mischievously. She nudged
at his phallus with her toe. It came to life instantaneously. She stared at it
for a moment, then her eyes met his, her eyebrow arched suggestively.
&quot;Let's see what tricks we can teach this beast&quot;. He surrendered to
her.

&nbsp;

Drachius
and Honorius conferred not far from Melissia's quarters.

&nbsp;

&quot;She is too
dangerous. She belongs on the cross. I have sworn to pound in the nails
myself&quot;. Drachius forgot about rank in his orgasm of hate. Honorius
considered.

&nbsp;

&quot;The
Proconsul wants names. Then he wants to see how we may use this woman. She may
be politically valuable.&quot; He spoke the next sentence through clenched
teeth. &quot;He thinks she may be useful in training our troops -- my troops!!
Anyway, Antoninus has him convinced to crucify her conspirators but use her as
a figurehead in our re-pacification&quot;.

&nbsp;

&quot;Antoninus
was once a good man -- she's bewitched him. She'll bewitch the Proconsul! I've
never seen a woman stiffen so many pricks. But it's worse. She gets to them
above the belt&quot;.

&nbsp;

Honorius
regarded him thoughtfully. &quot;She has got to you as well Drachius. Do you
seek to punish the woman or possess her?&quot;

&nbsp;

Drachius
was momentarily speechless. He proceeded slowly, remembering that Honorius
could put him on the cross next to Melissia for an ill-considered remark.

&nbsp;

&quot;I
seek to avenge your men, General. Fallen in battle. Murdered by a treacherous
little girl.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;So
the question is this: will she cooperate?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Not
this one. I've flayed her alive and she screamed prettily enough. But I never
broke her. The problem is she may break any man sent to interrogate her&quot;.

&nbsp;

&quot;I
don't trust that worm of a physician -- she looks fit enough for another
session under the lash.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Hmmm
-- you're lucky the Proconsul didn't crucify you for overdoing it the last
time. You can understand why he would be risk-averse with this girl's life. I
think I have the answer. Your whip will draw Melissia's blood again&quot;. At
that, Drachius tensed. He felt his penis hardening and hoped it was not obvious
to his General. Honorius was inwardly amused but pretended not to notice.

&nbsp;

&quot;I
know a woman who can supervise her interrogation. The woman, Fulvia, is cousin
of Messalina who was banished to the provinces for exceeding her in beauty,
cunning and ruthlessness. She is the Proconsul's lover; ambitious and sadistic.
If she gets us our names --- all to the good, the Proconsul will be pleased. We
will have time enough to plot Melissia's downfall with her help. If the wench
is stubborn -- she will expire under your tender caresses. I will plant the
idea with Fulvia and she will advance our agenda in the Proconsul's
bed-chamber.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Excellent
battle-plan General. What do we do about Ithicus?&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;We
rack him until he signs a clean bill of health for this girl. Then, my passionate
friend�&quot; (he permitted himself an ironic glance at Drachius' bulging,
throbbing member) &quot;our stubborn disobedient Melissia will be entirely
yours. Except I caution you -- Fulvia is more than your match in her love of
inflicting pain&quot;.

&nbsp;

&quot;General!
I look forward to the challenge�.&quot;� 

&nbsp;

They
came for him in the early hours, Ithicus was dragged protesting vehemently all
the way to the palace dungeons. They wasted no time, he was stripped naked and
placed on the rack.

&nbsp;

He
trembled as Drachius stood over is prone and vulnerable body.

&nbsp;

�I have
just one question for you Ithicus, is the girl well enough to be put to the
question?�

&nbsp;

�In my
opinion she is not Centurion.� Said the physician dreading what was coming
next.

&nbsp;

�The
last time I set eyes on her she looked well enough.� Countered Drachius.

&nbsp;

�Looks
can be deceiving sir, she has some way to go yet.�

&nbsp;

�Ithicus,
spare yourself from this unpleasantness, tell me the girl is now in full
health, give me a document confirming it and you will receive just a few lashes
for your deception.�

&nbsp;

�I
reiterate sir that in my expert opinion she is far from well.� Ithicus new full
well that this was not the answer they wanted and hoped he would be strong
enough to withstand their tortures.

&nbsp;

�I have
no time for your games Ithicus, I want you to release Melissia for questioning,
I feel you and she are playing us for fools and you both will pay dearly for
it.�

&nbsp;

With
that the Centurion nodded to the dungeon master who in turn gave the signal for
his men to turn the wheel that tightened the rack chains. Ithicus quickly felt
the wrist and ankle cuffs tighten. 

&nbsp;

�Stop
this infamy at once!� Yelled Ithicus. �You will surely answer to the proconsul
for harming his physician!� The physician felt the first burning pains in his
joints as the wheel continued to turn.

&nbsp;

�The
proconsul will not come to your aid Ithicus, he wants information from Melissia
without further delay, there is no more time for niceties.�

&nbsp;

The
wheel continued to click wrenching a piercing scream from the physician. The pain
from his tearing cartilages plus having hot irons run up and down his body
quickly broke his resolve. Having been broken he was dragged over to a nearby
table and made to sign a parchment giving Melissia a clean bill of health. 

&nbsp;

Drachius
picked up the freshly signed parchment. �If only we could break that Pagan
bitch as quickly as you physician but I fear she will lead us a merry chase.�
Drachius made to leave, turning to the master of the dungeon he left orders for
Ithicus to be lashed for his deception towards the Empire.

&nbsp;

Petronius
Arius studied the document releasing Melissia for torture. Fulvia his beautiful
mistress stood by his side. She was just 25 years old and had the most perfect
body which was topped off with a mane of beautiful jet black hair. Her skin
bore the natural olive colour that was common in Romans. Fulvia was totally
bored with this Saxon Isle, were it not for the proconsuls attentions she would
have returned to Rome a long time ago. She hated its climate and its savage
people. Her forte was pain and suffering followed closely by a veracious need
for sex in any shape or form. She relished in the torment she inflicted on any
that dared to stand up to her or resist her in any way. Now something else of
interest was afoot, a new challenge, this infamous pagan girl that caused such
a stir to all that came into contact with her.

&nbsp;

She
looked on with interest as Petronius studied the parchment in his hands. �What
is she like this girl, this Melissia?�

&nbsp;

Petronius
looked up. �She is very much like you Fulvia, strong in body and spirit, she
captivates all with her gaze, she can melt a man with those eyes of hers. My
centurions have all denied it but I can see it in their faces. Especially
Antoninus, he thinks we can turn her to our side. I cannot blame him for I have
seen her since her recovery and I too have felt myself being drawn in by those
eyes.�

&nbsp;

Fulvia
felt a pang of jealousy. �Then we had better pluck them out my lord before she
can do any more harm with them.�

&nbsp;

�Yes
that is one answer to the problem Fulvia but I fear it will not solve what she
has inflicted upon the empire. She has been trained most cleverly and has
passed on this knowledge to all her subordinates. They still roam this Isle
even as we speak inflicting heavy losses on our armies.�

&nbsp;

Fulvia
looked deep into the proconsuls eyes. �Let me have her Petronius, I will make
the little wretch tell all.�

&nbsp;

This is
a delicate matter Fulvia, my soldiers want to see her suffering for themselves
and I feel I owe it to them for what she has done to their pride.�

&nbsp;

�So she
is to be questioned before an assembly my lord, is that your final word on the
matter?� Fulvia looked disappointed. 

&nbsp;

Petronius
thought for a moment then looked at Fulvia. �By all means go and see the
creature and sow the seeds in her mind of what is about to happen to her, the
more fear she holds in her heart at the beginning of all this the better, what
do not think?�

&nbsp;

Fulvia
felt her heart leap with excitement, for she truly enjoyed the suffering of
fellow beings. Especially when it was she who administered it. She had been
reminded many times that this was abnormal in a woman but she dismissed their
ramblings. �Ah yes Petronius let me prepare her for what is to come, I will
make her tremble with fear, it will make the inquisitors task a little easier.�

&nbsp;

Fulvia
gathered up two of her loyal bodyguards and bade them take up position outside
Melissia�s quarters. As she turned the key in the heavy door she turned to the
guards. 

&nbsp;

�Only
enter if I call for you, is that understood.�

&nbsp;

The two
men nodded and watched the proconsul�s mistress enter the pagan girls quarters.

&nbsp;

Melissia
was worried for she had not heard from Ithicus for some hours. He had never
left her for so long in the past, her feelings told her something was wrong. She
tried to ease her fears by taking a bath in scented oils. On exiting her bath
she tied a silk loincloth about her waist and covered her chest with a light
halter necked top. She heard the door of her quarters open and her heart leapt
with relief, as she believed her beloved Ithicus had returned at last.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Melissia
stared at the voluptuous woman standing before her; Fulvia�s body stirred
something inside her.

&nbsp;

�Who are
you and what has happened to Ithicus?�

&nbsp;

Fulvia
delighted in Melissia�s obvious discomfort on seeing her. �Worry not about your
physician my girl, he is the least of your worries at this time.�

&nbsp;

�Ah your
very demeanour tells me something has happened to him.� Melissia took a step
towards Fulvia fists clenched.

&nbsp;

�Take
not a step further Melissia it will not ease the situation you find yourself in
here.�

&nbsp;

�I
presume you have not come here alone lady, someone like you would never dare do
that.� Melissia did not want to antagonise this woman until she had knowledge
of who she was and what she wanted.

&nbsp;

�It is
true what they say about you Melissia, you must learn to control your
aggression for it does not become you.� Fulvia was happy that she did not have
to call the guards just yet.

&nbsp;

Melissia
calmed herself. �So are you going to at least tell me your name before you have
me dragged off to face my fate?� Melissia�s in-built haughtiness had returned
once more.

&nbsp;

�My
sweet girl, there are so many questions written on that pretty face of yours.
My name is Fulvia, I am a close friend and associate of the proconsul here on
this dreadful rock you call Briton.�

&nbsp;

Melissia
began to feel contempt for this woman. �Well it�s not much but we like to call
it home, and by the way it is our home and not yours, but then again I suppose
you have noticed that? Tell that to your precious Arius next time you straddle
him.� Melissia enjoyed her dig at Fulvia and relished scoring the first verbal
blow.

&nbsp;

Fulvia
relished the girl�s obvious fire at first hand and knew that this was going to
be a battle of wills between them. �I shall be telling him a lot more by the
time I am finished with you Melissia believe me.�

&nbsp;

�Now I
get it,� retorted Melissia. �You are going to be the one who butters me up
before they hand me over for crucifixion.�

&nbsp;

�Dear
Melissia I shall be doing more than buttering you up as you call it, I shall be
doing some roasting as well. When I warm up that delightful backside of yours
you will wish you had never been born with it!� Fulvia delighted at the
reaction in Melissia�s face.

&nbsp;

�Well
while you are attending to it you can kiss it because that is all you will get
from me lady.� 

&nbsp;

�I have
never failed to get the guests in my chambers to sing their hearts out my dear
and you shall be no exception.�

&nbsp;

�Then
let us not dally any more with mindless banter, do with me what you will, you
are boring me.�

&nbsp;

�Very
well Melissia you quite obviously have very little survival skills and are
quite suicidal, I expected more from you. Drachius will be attending to you
this evening; I will attend to you tomorrow. Personally I would not like to be
in your skin these next few days. Your punishment will not be quick Melissia,
it is all going to be long and painful, I pity you.�

&nbsp;

Melissia
tried to suppress a shiver at Fulvia�s words. She had not reckoned for another
session with Drachius just yet. Then to be quickly followed by a session of god
knows what from Fulvia did not bare thinking about. 

&nbsp;

She
snapped out of her negative thoughts. �Ah dear sweet Drachius how is he these
days? I have missed him so much.�

&nbsp;

�You do
not fool me with your false bravado Melissia, enjoy your evening I shall expect
you in the morning, a little worse for wear I should imagine.� With that Fulvia
left the room. 

&nbsp;

Outside
Fulvia instructed the guards to give Melissia a few minutes to reflect on what
had been said then they were to deliver her to Drachius.

&nbsp;

Melissia
pined for Ithicus; she just knew something had happened to him, she just prayed
he was still alive. As for her? Well she knew full well that they wanted to
give her a slow lingering and painful death. �I just need to hold out for just
a little longer.� She thought to herself.

&nbsp;

�We meet
again pagan bitch.�

&nbsp;

�Well
hello to you too Drachius, how is the world treating you these days? I
personally have been having a ball.�

&nbsp;

Drachius
could hardly contain himself with her sarcasm; he fought inwardly not to let
this girl get the better of him. He knew deep down he was no match for her
verbal skills; after all he was just a simple soldier.

&nbsp;

�I will
ignore your flippancy Melissia for it will be I who will win out in the end.
The road before you is going to be a long and painful one and I shall be there
to watch you take every step of it.�

&nbsp;

�Fine
with me muscle head but watch out for diversions, things are not all they
seem.�

&nbsp;

Drachius
could not help but admire the audacity of this brazen girl, what on earth was
she on about now?

&nbsp;

�Enough
pleasantries Melissia, you are here to answer a few nagging questions.�

&nbsp;

With
that the centurion pulled Melissia over to a crude looking wooded contraption
in the middle of the room. She stared at it wondering what on earth it was.

&nbsp;

�I
cannot offer you a seat girl but I can offer you a ride on my horse, it is like
no other horse you will ever see.� Drachius laughed at his own joke

&nbsp;

He is
right thought Melissia she had not seen anything like it before but as it was
blood stained she knew full well that it was an instrument of torture.

&nbsp;

Drachius
grabbed her and tore off the flimsy clothes she had been wearing leaving her
totally naked.

&nbsp;

�Oh
Drachius I thought you might have learned some lessons by now on how to treat a
lady, you are so informal.�

&nbsp;

Drachius
gave her a mighty slap across her face for her ever-increasing insolence. He
was annoyed with himself once again for his loss of self-control. Melissia
picked herself up off the floor wiping the blood away from her mouth. This time
she said nothing.

&nbsp;

While
she was still dazed Drachius pulled her hands behind her and tied her wrists
tightly with a strong piece of leather thong. He then lifted Melissia up and
put her astride the wooded horse. The sharp pinnacle of the horse bit deeply
into the folds of her vagina causing her to gasp. He then pulled her arms up
behind her and attached the long strand of leather to a beam above Melissia�s
shoulders.

&nbsp;

Drachius
took a step back to admire his handy work. �What, nothing to say girl? Do you
not like my horse?� He was laughing quite loudly now.

&nbsp;

He was
right Melissia was quite speechless at the predicament she now found herself
in. Her own body weight was pulling her down hard onto her pelvic mound, it was
a pain she had never experienced before and she found it to be excruciating in
the extreme. She could hardly draw breath it was so bad, the more she struggled
the more it hurt. 

&nbsp;

�You
will find if you keep still it will be less painful Melissia but I have no
intention of letting you keep still on my horse.� He then produced his beloved
whip much to Melissia�s horror.

&nbsp;

�I want
to hear your pretty screams now girl and if in the mean time you would like to
answer a few questions then please feel free to do so.�

&nbsp;

Melissia
was too preoccupied with the fiery pain emanating from between her legs to hear
anything that was being said to her.

&nbsp;

Drachius
stripped off his tunic exposing his well-muscled torso, he stood before her in
his breeches pulling the wicked looking whip through his hands. 

Melissia
admired his physique but it was a fleeting admiration as the first blow of his
fearsome whip struck her soundly across her stomach. The pain it caused was two
fold, for it caused her to violently move her body thus she experienced the
ever-increasing burn from her vagina and the sharp severe pain from the lash.

&nbsp;

Just as
Melissia was about to add to the sarcasm another blow from the whip caught her
squarely across her chest. Drachius was clearly enjoying his work. A large red
wheal formed across her breasts, the double pains she was experiencing
literally took her breath away. �What kind of man gets his rocks off doing such
things to a woman.� She thought to herself. She did not know what pain to
concentrate on first, the one between her legs or her chest.

&nbsp;

Several
more blows reigned down on her and her body began the process of shutting down.
Her head began to spin and she felt herself drifting into unconsciousness, to
her it was a blessed relief.

&nbsp;

Drachius
could not help but notice she was losing consciousness. �She has grown soft
since being with Ithicus.� He thought to himself as he admired the criss-cross
of welts he had left on her skin. He knew deep down he would get nothing out of
her accept a tirade of caustic remarks. So he decided he would leave her over
night sat on the wooden horse. It would be interesting to witness her reaction
to the pain from it in the morning.

&nbsp;

�������������������������������� ��������
 


&nbsp;

As dawn
broke over the Roman Palace Melissia stirred from her fitful sleep. Her groin
and legs felt numb; in fact she could not feel them at all. Her arms were still
pulled high up her back and she was still sat astride Drachius� infernal contraption
he called a �horse.� The welts across her breasts and abdomen burned like hell,
she had not been spared that pain.

&nbsp;

She
heard the turning of keys in a door lock, the door creaked loudly as it opened,
then two guards walked in.

&nbsp;

�The
bitch is awake,� she heard one guard say.

&nbsp;

�Get her
down,� said the second one, �The Lady Fulvia awaits her company.�

&nbsp;

The
leather was loosened and they lifted her roughly off the horse. As soon as the
pressure was taken off her crotch the numbness disappeared. When the feeling to
the area returned Melissia was subjected to the most excruciating pain
imaginable. She could not help but let out a shrill scream, her agony excited
the guards. 

&nbsp;

�This is
nothing to what the Lady Fulvia has in store for you bitch, if I did not hate
you so much I would pity you.� Said the first guard.

&nbsp;

Melissia
sucked in some air. �Let�s cut the small talk please Fulvia is expecting me to
have breakfast with her, it would be rude to keep her waiting.�

&nbsp;

The
second guard punched her squarely in the abdomen and Melissia fell heavily at
the feet of the first who then kicked her in the ribs.

&nbsp;

�Will
this bitch ever learn to keep her mouth shut?� Said the first guard.

&nbsp;

With
that they dragged Melissia�s limp body to Fulvia�s quarters.

&nbsp;

Fulvia
was angry with the two guards. �It is I who will be inflicting the pain here
not you two meat heads.� She screamed. 

&nbsp;

Fulvia
examined Drachius� handy work. �Hmmm..� she thought to herself. �He has made
clever use of the horse, how admirable.�

&nbsp;

She
guessed the girl had given them all a fair amount of lip judging from the
bruising about her body.

&nbsp;

Sitting
in the middle of the room were two large wooden wheels coupled together with
wooden slats. Imbedded in the slats were pointed metal studs. It stood the
height of two people. Next to it stood a glowing brazier with hot irons
sticking out from the top of it. The very sight of it made the guards shudder.
Melissia was too dazed to take any of her surroundings in.

&nbsp;

�Seize
her up,� commanded Fulvia. 

&nbsp;

With
that the two guards placed Melissia�s limp body on the wheel. Her ankles were
shackled to chains at the base that in turn were imbedded in the ground. Her
wrists were shackled and chained high above her head further up the wheel. 

&nbsp;

Melissia
tried to take in what was happening to her, she looked anxiously around her and
realised with abject horror that she was being racked. As soon as the wheel
turned her body would go up around the wheel but as her feet were shackled at
the base she would in fact be stretched between the two sets of shackles. This
to her was the worst fate imaginable, being torn limb from limb did not appeal
to her one little bit. She tried to struggle then felt the sharp pain of the
metal studs in her back.

&nbsp;

�You
unspeakable bastards!� she yelled.

&nbsp;

Fulvia
smiled. �Now you realise that all this is not a joke little lady, we want
answers from you and we intend to get them.� Fulvia salivated at the sight of
Melissia�s pert breasts with their hard nipples. She noticed the shiver in her
body. �Now she is afraid,� she thought to herself.

&nbsp;

�I would
imagine just being up on my wheel is painful enough, just imagine what the pain
will be like when it is turned?�

&nbsp;

Melissia
looked down at Fulvia who was literally salivating at the sight before her.
�You truly are one monster of a woman but do you not think my death will be
swift when you tear me limb from limb?�

&nbsp;

�My dear
girl I have no intention of doing that, I just want you stretched tight before
me then I am free to use my other friends on you.�

&nbsp;

With
that Fulvia pulled one of the glowing red-hot irons from the brazier. �These
are the items that will have you singing like a song bird.�

&nbsp;

Melissia�s
mind raced back to the time in the stable when Antoninus had used them on her.
The pain had been so appalling she did not have the words to describe it. Now
here she was about to suffer it once more. She wondered to herself what she had
done to deserve such a fate.

&nbsp;

She was
aroused from her thoughts by the loud clanking of machinery, suddenly the
shackles tightened and her body was stretched taught the metal studs bit into
her back. The sinews in her arms and legs began to feel like they were on fire,
her spinal chord sent out the most excruciating signals of pain. She felt she
was entering hell.

&nbsp;

Melissia�s
screams could be heard throughout the building, the soldiers smiled. Soon she
will be ours they thought. They had planned her fate right down to the last
detail. They were going to rape her to within an inch of her life then she
would be nailed to a cross at the gates of the city. Some wanted to impale her
but had second thoughts because her death would be too quick.

&nbsp;

�You
scream so prettily Melissia and I have not even started yet.� Torturing this
girl was going to be even more pleasurable than she had imagined, thought
Fulvia.

&nbsp;

Melissia�s
body was bathed in sweat; she was stretched so tightly she could hardly breath.
She saw Fulvia remove one of the hot irons from the brazier once more, she
clenched her teeth, and her head was filled with shear terror. �Brace yourself
for the most terrible pain imaginable,� she thought to herself.

&nbsp;

�I am
going to be very nice to you Melissia, just give me the name of your tutor and
all this will stop. I shall be dreadfully disappointed but a name is more
important to me at this time. Quickly now before this iron cools too much.�

&nbsp;

Melissia
looked down, and then spat at Fulvia.

&nbsp;

�How
very very silly of you girl. Then so be it, I will not stop until you give me a
name.�

&nbsp;

Fulvia
placed the hot iron just under Melissia�s left breast and drew it slowly down
her body and across her abdomen stopping just short of her pubic mound.
Melissia screamed so loudly she almost ruptured her vocal chords. Fulvia did
not want her to faint so she lifted the iron off her body and stood back to
admire her handy work.

&nbsp;

�� ����������������
 


�Try not
to faint dear girl, you obviously want this to last a long time, I cannot think
why but who am I not to grant a pretty girl her dieing wish.�

&nbsp;

Melissia�s
eyes were clenched tight shut; she could barely hear what Fulvia was saying to
her. Her main object was to somehow shut out the pain but it was proving
impossible, she truly wanted to die. With that she felt the iron being raked
once more across her torso. Fulvia was truly a master at this, she knew exactly
when to lift the iron from her skin. 

&nbsp;

Fulvia
passed the iron for the third time across Melissia�s quivering body, something
exploded inside her head, she heard herself screaming the name �Arnold! His
name is Arnold, in the name of all that is holy lift that iron from my body!� 

&nbsp;

Her
voice had been reduced to a croak with too much screaming. Her whole body shook
and was racked with pain. Fulvia had broken her she could take no more.

&nbsp;

**************

&nbsp;

�And she
informed you where this Arnold can be found?� The proconsul was delighted with
Fulvia�s efforts at interrogation.

&nbsp;

�Yes she
gave me exact details of his whereabouts, a troop of soldiers are on their way
there now.� Cooed Fulvia.

&nbsp;

�I
thought this girl would be difficult to break, how was it done?�

&nbsp;

�Well it
was a dual effort between Drachius and myself, but she certainly has a serious
aversion to branding irons.�

&nbsp;

�Yes I
heard tell that she has experienced them before at the hands of Antoninus. But
well done Fulvia I will see that you are very well rewarded for this.�

&nbsp;

�We must
celebrate with good food and wine my Lord. You seem to have an abundance of
serving wenches in the palace?�

&nbsp;

�Very
true, I do not know where the Master of Servants is getting them all from and
how much it is costing me, but then again one cannot have too many slaves.�

&nbsp;

Melissia
lay in her cell in a state of delirium; she felt that her skin was on fire. She
was aware of the presence of another person in the room. In fact it was another
of the proconsuls physicians. He had been sent to attend to Melissia�s latest
wounds in the absence of Ithicus who had been returned to Rome to ultimately
face banishment. He was a kind man but he was no Ithicus.

&nbsp;

Melissia
stared at him through pain filled eyes. �Ah yet another sent to heal me and
ready me for execution?�

&nbsp;

�Please
do not make this any harder for me than it already is my lady.� Like Ithicus
this physician did not like what had been done to this splendid looking
creature before him.

�Sorry I
know this is not your doing but healing me seems all pretty pointless.�

&nbsp;

Melissa
never did find out the mans name but like Ithicus he did his work well and
within a few days she felt a lot better. She knew that whoever was sent to
capture Arnold would soon return empty handed for it was foreseen that she
would break under the combined efforts of Drachius and Fulvia. Would she then
be subjected to more brutality? It was more than likely. 

&nbsp;

As she
was drifting off to sleep she heard a muffled cry from outside her door, then
she heard the sound of keys. As the door creaked open she could see the shadowy
figures of several women. �Where have you been I have been having so much fun
while I was waiting for you?�

&nbsp;

Helena
stood before her beloved leader trying to suppress a tear at what they had done
to her. �Those bastards will pay for this Melissia.�

&nbsp;

�All in
good time my dear friend, tell me is everything in place?�

&nbsp;

�Yes,
fires are being set in the north of the city as we speak, hopefully this will
draw the soldiers away so we can attend to the task in question here.�

&nbsp;

Melissia
was impressed by how well the plan had been executed. �How many of us are
present in the city?�

&nbsp;

�Thanks
to your delaying tactics over 2000 of our women have infiltrated the city over
the last few weeks. They will take down the few remaining guards here and go for
the proconsul.�

&nbsp;

�Excellent!
We may not be able to win this war but we can cause immense embarrassment to
Rome. Any news of the whereabouts of Antoninus?�

&nbsp;

�We
managed to get word that he was sent up to Caledonia with a legion of troops.�

&nbsp;

�Dam
them, they have denied me my revenge on him.� Melissia angrily paced about the
room. �Why did they send a whole legion away?�

&nbsp;

�Because
local hostilities had died down, little did they know we were up to something
more cunning.� Helena suppressed a laugh.

&nbsp;

�You do
realise we will bring the might of Rome down on us Melissia.�

&nbsp;

�Of
course I do, but this is our moment, we will have embarrassed Caesar, I would
love to be present in the senate when he tries to explain this one to them.�

&nbsp;

Melissia
was interrupted in mid flow by one of the women guerrillas entering the room. 

&nbsp;

�We have
the proconsul and his woman.�

&nbsp;

�Good,
take me to them, this is going to be interesting!�

&nbsp;

Melissia
found herself staring at a very red faced proconsul and a seething Fulvia.

&nbsp;

�You
little bitch, you will die screaming in hell for what you have done this day.�
Petronius Arius was mortified by the circumstances he now found himself in, as
was Fulvia.

&nbsp;

�Well
considering that has been your intention all along Arius I do not think
anything has changed much do you?�

&nbsp;

The
proconsul glared at her and detested her smugness. �So what is it you want from
me now you have won the day with your bitch army? It will be very short lived I
assure you.�

&nbsp;

�I am
not going to harm you as I respect your position, but what I will do is put you
aboard a galley for Rome. I think your Caesar will decide your fate.�

&nbsp;

�And
what of Fulvia?�

&nbsp;

�Now she
is a different matter Arius.� Melissia spoke about her as if she were not in
the room, for she knew this to be the ultimate insult. �I think a good and
bloody flogging would be well deserved, then maybe a session on that beloved
wheel of hers would be most befitting.�

&nbsp;

Fulvia
had a face like a wild cat, spitting and hissing hardly able to speak. �You
despicable little mare, you will never get away with this.�

&nbsp;

Melissia
turned and faced her. �My dear Fulvia.� She cooed. �I think I already have.�

&nbsp;

They
were interrupted by a commotion outside in the corridor. On investigation
Melissia was delighted to see Drachius who was chained head to foot and being
dragged along by a posse of her women warriors. He was covered in blood.

&nbsp;

�He put
up one hell of a fight.� Said one of the warriors through blood stained teeth.

&nbsp;

Melissia
smiled. �I would have expected nothing less.� She placed her face just inches
from his. �And just what shall we do with you dear Drachius?�

&nbsp;

Drachius�
pride had been damaged beyond belief and he was passed caring at what was to
become of him. He just stared at the gloating Melissia.

&nbsp;

�I shall
have you impaled, after all the idea of doing that to me did cross your mind
did it not?�

&nbsp;

Drachius�
face seemed to drain of all colour. It pleased Melissia that she had thought of
something to put fear into this mindless and cruel man. �What a pity Antoninus
is not here to witness this. I will just have to picture his face in my mind
when he hears of all this. Maybe they will even send him after me, I would look
forward to that very much.�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Epilogue.

&nbsp;

And so
it was, Melissia got her revenge. The proconsul Petronius Arius was sent back
to Rome and was thrown to the lions in the Coliseum. Fulvia was lashed and
racked to within an inch of her life. It had left her a ruined and broken
woman. She was taken to an outlying village where she was made to work until
she died a few months later from the severe trauma of her wounds.

&nbsp;

As for
Drachius, Melissia kept her promise and had him impaled in the city square of
Nova Magus. It had been a gruesome spectacle with Melissia herself pushing a
Roman pike into his anus. He was then raised high into the air where the pike
penetrated up through his body and out through his shoulder blades. His screams
could be heard right across the city. He died many hours later.

&nbsp;

Many
months later Antoninus was once again dispatched to seek out and capture Melissia
and her rebel army but this time he did not succeed. They seemed to have melted
away into the mist. By now the Romans had become tired of this land and he and
the hearts of his men were not up to the task assigned to them. And secretly
deep down he wanted this brave and stubborn girl to live out her life in peace
for he had been truly smitten with her.

&nbsp;

The
Roman Emperor Nero became more and more insane and eventually stood back and
idly watched his city burn.

&nbsp;

In the
far reaches of southern Briton two women lay in each other�s arms. One
whispered to the other.

&nbsp;

�Pleasure
me lieutenant, pleasure me like only you can.� For just this brief moment in
time Melissia was finally in heaven and in the arms of the woman she loved.

&nbsp;

As for
the future? Well that was in the lap of the gods.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The
End

&nbsp;
