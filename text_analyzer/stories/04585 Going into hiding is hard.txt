Going into hiding

Part 1

By Tcheser

&nbsp;

Salvatore Giuseppe hated to do it
but there was no other way. His life as a mobster had to come to an end. He had
done too many bad things and the police had finally caught him. He knew he
wasn�t blameless, but it was the result of his upbringing that had really laid
the foundation for his criminal endeavors. Had he not been born the son of a
gangster he would have most likely never been more then a corrupt accountant or
a bill padding lawyer. As it was the police had him for drug trafficking and he
was looking at 10-20 years in the pen. He could have done the time, but the
hard ass DA was on a mission and promised him that should he stay mum about the
mob�s doings he would personally make sure Sal�s time in prison was a living
hell. Having no other options Sal accepted the DA�s offer for immunity from
prosecution in exchange for turning states evidence. He would of course have to
go into the witness protection program, but these things were as they were.

&nbsp;

A month later Sal was out of New
  York and in lovely Iowa.
He hated every moment of it. He couldn�t stand not being a mobster. It was all
he knew and having that part of him gone was like living without a leg. This
made him quite irritable. What made him even more irritable was how his wife
barely seemed to care or notice. She was in her own little world. 

&nbsp;

As long as she was still the
elegant Mrs. Annabelle Giuseppe with her fancy clothes and fancy cars and her
life of leisure she was fine. She was blitzed most of the time. Whatever time
she wasn�t shopping or strutting around in her expensive revealing clothes. Her lifestyle hadn�t really changed much. Their
house was a little smaller, but she still had a maid, ate out or ordered in
every meal and had a pool to sun herself by. It was infuriating to Sal who had
sacrificed so much and completely rearranged his life.

&nbsp;

Finally he decided he would do
something about it. It would be fun bringing Annabelle back down to earth.
Besides he didn�t really have much else to do after all. So starting that
Monday he began to hatch his secret plan to make his wife understand what he
was going through.

&nbsp;

The first thing he did was wake up
his lovely wife at 6 am. Annabelle had
been up late as usual talking with her fancy friends in New
  York and Paris
and was thus still sleeping hard. She rarely got up before noon in fact. This though was the first thing Sal was
going to change. She whined as he shook her and didn�t move a muscle until he
took the covers and splashed a cup of water in her face. 

&nbsp;

Annabelle sputtered and cursed then
demanded to know what was going on at which point Sal explained. He told her
that they were now in Iowa and in
Iowa things were done a bit
differently. If they were going to live here he told her they needed to adjust
and try and blend in. And in Iowa
housewives did not sleep until noon.
Annabelle was arrogant, vain and superficial, but she listened to Sal. She was
also from a crime related family and although not a criminal herself she knew
what these animals were capable of. So she got up and quickly through on her
robe.

&nbsp;

Next Sal wanted breakfast. He said
it was too early to go anywhere or order anything so since Annabelle was up she
could make breakfast. Annabelle of course wasn�t eager but did as Sal said. She
made a simple breakfast of eggs and sausages and juice. She wasn�t a very
skilled cook, but Sal said it was pretty good and encouraged her with the fact
that she would only improve with more practice.

&nbsp;

After breakfast Sal told his wife
that they were going out. He was going to treat her to a day of beauty and
shopping he said. Watching her eyes light up and her fake little kisses on his
cheeks Sal couldn�t wait for the payoff. Annabelle hurried and got dressed. As
always she was very much overdressed. She wore a sleek red dress with a short
fur coat, silk stockings and high stiletto heels. Her long blonde hair and
sultry face was reminiscent of a late 30�s movie star. Sure she looked sexy as
hell, but then she always did. It was exciting for other men to see her slutty
attire but Sal had fucked her so many times it was almost more stimulating to
him to see her at her worst. They climbed into his FBI leased Buick regal and
were off.

&nbsp;

The first stop was the beauty
parlor. Up until now Annabelle had been traveling an hour to the closest big
city and going to a real ritzy and expensive beauty parlor. The parlor Sal
drove to today was along the main street of the small
sleepy Iowa town. It wasn�t a
fancy place, there was a classier parlor with a French name down the street for
the more well to do town ladies. When they pulled up in front of the
establishment Annabelle took one look, took off her fashionable sunglasses and
turned to look sternly at Sal. She said she couldn�t go to this place, it was
shabby. Sal replied calmly that this was where the ladies in town went. He
didn�t mention the other salon. After a moments silence Sal got out of the car
and opened Annabelle�s door. Hesitantly she got out and after some urging
approached the little beauty parlor sandwiched between the donut shop and $.99
store. A number of high school age boys were hanging out in front. When
Annabelle past by them they all stopped goofing about. She was the hottest
thing they had ever seen in the flesh and they immediately started making obscene
proposals and making wolf whistles. Annabelle always liked such attention and
despite Sal�s stern glance she blew them a little kiss and straightened her
stockings on the curb. It made her hot that she knew a number of them were
going to immediately run behind the store and rub one out.

&nbsp;

The place wasn�t large. It had only
three chairs, two sinks and three dryers. There were a half
dozen middle aged and older ladies and three beauty parlor employees. Everyone
looked at them when they entered the salon. Annabelle looked hopeful when she
saw that there were at least three women in front of her. These hopes were
shattered though when he told her to have a seat and wait her turn. He said she
needed to meet some of the local women so she wouldn�t be on the phone with New
  York and Paris
all the time exposing them. He then left her there to run some errands. 

&nbsp;

Sal returned an hour later just in
time as a hairdresser called Annabelle�s name. Reluctantly Annabelle went with
the hairdresser at Sal�s insistence. She was asked how she wanted her hair and
what she would like done, but Sal answered for her.
One look from him and she knew she couldn�t argue. Somewhat amused that the
looker was having her hair styled per her husband�s orders the hairdresser,
Georgia, waited patiently as Sal explained what he wanted. For his own
amusement and to torture Annabelle, Sal then slowly guided Georgia
to do Annabelle up just the way he wanted. 

&nbsp;

He had noticed that his wife had
chipped one of her nails while she was doing the dishes that morning after
breakfast. Annabelle always had long nails and currently had a glorious set of
two inch long French tipped acrylic nails. She liked to paint them in flashy
dark reds or bright pinks with sparkles. Sal told Georgia
to cut and file them down to the quick and remove any nail polish. Annabelle
gasped but did nothing to anger her husband as Georgia
trimmed her beautiful nails down to square little nothings. Her nails hadn�t
been that short since she was eleven.

&nbsp;

Sal wasn�t sure about the hair or
makeup just yet but was sure they needed to do something with it. Catching onto
Sal�s intent here Georgia
suggested they wash Annabelle�s face and shampoo her hair so she would be ready
for whatever they intended to do next. She would be a clean slate so to say.
Sal agreed that was a wonderful idea. He then read a magazine and tried to hide
his mirth as Georgia
went about removing all of Annabelle�s jewelry. She didn�t want it to get in
the way or be misplaced. Sal took possession of it for safekeeping. That done Georgia
then undertook the chore of removing all of Annabelle�s carefully applied
makeup and cosmetics. Sal averted his gaze as to not spoil his own surprise. He
did notice the two move to the shampoo station though.

&nbsp;

A few minutes later they were back
at the styling chair and Sal rejoined them. Annabelle seemed to be in a sour
mood, but Sal ignored her. He told Georgia
he had decided how he wanted her hair done. He then handed Georgia
the magazine and pointed to a picture in it. Georgia
nodded and asked it he wanted it that color as well. He said he did and almost
laughed aloud when he heard Annabelle gasp. She had always enjoyed the many
compliments her light golden blonde hair had garnered for her. She couldn�t
imagine changing her hair color. Sal went for a smoke while Georgia
did her work. 

&nbsp;

When he returned he was not
disappointed. Georgia
had done a great job and he would have to remember to give her a huge tip. She
had given poor Annabelle the exact cut from the magazine and to Sal�s delight
and his wife�s horror it was just as unflattering as he had imagined it would
be. She pouted delightfully as she sat there. Her long wavy golden tresses were
long gone. Her hair was now a dull lifeless brown and cut in a tapered bob cut.
Her once chest level hair now fell no lower then her ear
level. She also now had a set of high limp bangs. Sal could almost
detect tears. He told Georgia
it was perfect. It was just the thing for a busy homemaker who didn�t have much
time to spend on her hair.

&nbsp;

Georgia
asked at this point how he would like her makeup. Sal smiled and replied that
he needed some time to think about that and she should just leave her bare for
now. Georgia
giggled a bit. Annabelle was aghast though as Sal paid the bill and led her
completely devoid of makeup out of the salon. She was never without makeup and
felt dull and plain when she wasn�t wearing it. She had to look away as they
passed the other ladies on their way out the door.

&nbsp;

Somewhat fearful of the way the day
was turning out Annabelle asked Sal what they were doing next as they walked
down main street. Sal just smiled as his plan continued along its scheduled
route. Then he took her hand an guided her into a
store. It happened so fast she didn�t have a chance to see what it was. Once
inside it was clear it was a ladies clothing store. She asked where she was and
Sal was delighted to tell her she was in a dress barn. On a number of occasions
Sal recalled hearing Annabelle joke with her friends about the store and the
poor sluts who had to shop there. Now she was here herself and Sal said she was
going to buy some new clothes. Horrified Sal had to lead her further into the
store.

&nbsp;

A dreary young woman named Rita was
the only person working at this hour. Eventually she came to see what they
needed. Sal greeted her warmly and took aside so they could speak as
conspirators. He slipped her a hundred dollar bill to get the ball rolling.
Once she was on board he explained in a louder voice so that Annabelle could
hear that she was going to be spending a lot of time around the house cleaning
and keeping it up. She therefore needed several durable garments to wear. As
they would only be seen around the house they didn�t need to be fancy or
anything. If she had any seconds or returns in the back that would be
acceptable.

&nbsp;

Rita went to see what she had with
the gleam in her eye that could only be enjoyment at seeing Annabelle�s wife
degrade her like this. When she returned she carried several garments. With the
ok from Sal she then helped his wife undress so she could try them on. Sal
loved seeing his stuck up wife divested of her fancy clothes by the common
little dress barn clerk. When she was stripped down to her imported silk bra
and panties Sal had another idea. He asked if they sold underwear. They didn�t
as he thought. That was okay he told Rita and instructed her quietly to find
Annabelle three of the ugliest least flattering dresses in the place and
prepare for a fashion show when he returned. Rita smiled and agreed and Sal
left.

&nbsp;

When he returned the two women were
waiting for him. Rita stopped the folding she was doing and happily rejoined
the fun. Sal gave Annabelle a bag he had brought with him. Inside she found a
cheap cotton long line bra and a pair of very large full coverage white cotton
panties. They were both fruit of the loom. She knew Sal wanted her to put them
on so she pulled off her expensive lingerie and put on the cheap counterparts
Sal had bought her. They looked and felt horrible. They didn�t flatter her
figure at all and made her feel quite insecure.

&nbsp;

Next came
the fashion show. Rita helped Annabelle try on and parade around in three
different dresses. The first was an awful green affair with purple flower
appliqu�. It was short sleeved and hung on her like a sack. The second was a
blue jean material dress with a frilly lace hem and collar. It was a very odd
dress. Lastly was a jumper style dress of blue corduroy. With it she wore a
striped green and yellow blouse. It was terribly embarrassing for the
clotheshorse Annabelle to walk around in the awful tacky clothing. Sal asked
her then which dress she like the best and which one the least. Starting to
catch on Annabelle figured that Sal would make her wear the one she hated. It
didn�t matter much though as she hated them all and told him so. Sal thought
that was very disrespectful a thing to say in front of an employee of the
store. As a way of apologizing he said he would buy all three outfits and she
could wear the one she was currently wearing home. He then said he was a little
short of cash and asked if Rita would make a trade. After the amusement he had
already supplied her Rita would have given the clothes to Sal for free, but her
interest was peaked. She asked him what he had to trade. Sal smiled and handed
her all of Annabelle�s cast off designer clothing. These were worth many times
what Sal was purchasing. Annabelle�s jaw dropped in silent horror. None the
less he also dug into his pocket and threw in all the jewelry Annabelle had
been wearing earlier that morning. Annabelle despite herself couldn�t help but
scrunch up her pretty face and curse. She couldn�t believe her husband was
giving away her fancy dress and her best jewelry away to some shop girl. Sal
gave that look again and she stifled it though.

&nbsp;

Thrilled Rita accepted all Sal
offered. She even asked if he would like to see her in the new garb. Sal said
he would. A moment later she reappeared from the changing room. No longer was
she a dreary salesgirl. Now she looked like a Parisian runway model. Sal
thought it was great and made Annabelle complement her on her style. She didn�t
want to but did it anyway. The salesgirl just beamed and twirled about in her
new clothes. Sal said her was pleased he could make her so happy. 

&nbsp;

Sal then produced another item he
purchased while he was out. As Rita now had Annabelle�s heels she was barefoot.
That wouldn�t do so Sal had purchased her some new shoes. She was not impressed
by the imitation blue keds. She put the shoes on though; it was slightly better
then being barefoot. She wore them reluctantly with the white cotton socks he
had also gotten her. Now from head to toe she noticed in the mirror she was a
very plain looking Iowa
housewife. Additionally Rita also now towered over her. Annabelle was only
about 5�4� and so always wore shoes with at least a four inch heel. Without the
help of high heels she was somewhat on the short side. Sal was thrilled and she
was horrified.

&nbsp;

Pulling her out of the store and
waving goodbye to Rita, Sal took her back out onto Main
  Street. She was even more humiliated now then
before and kept her head low and averted from everyone she saw. Sal saw her
doing this and told her to stop and walk properly. He even gave her a swat
across the ass to prove his seriousness. Annabelle did a little hop when he spanked
her. That was another new thing. Where they came from if a man was mad at a
woman he slapped her. The swat on the ass seemed very white bread and very
Midwestern. Annabelle then put on her dark designer sunglasses. At least with
them on she didn�t have to look anyone in the eye. Sal noticed her wearing them
though and snagged them from her. He told her it wasn�t bright enough to wear
such things and besides they didn�t go with her outfit. Then to her chagrin he
tossed them in a trash can they passed.

&nbsp;

They then entered the town
municipal building. It housed the police station, courthouse, and Clerk�s
office and just about everything else. Sal led Annabelle by the arm down the
hall to the DMV. Inside was a lone clerk looking bored and reading a magazine.
She was a somewhat overweight woman and dour women who never expected much of
anyone. Sal brought Annabelle up to the counter and waited happily for the
clerk to come help them. Annabelle insisted on knowing why they were there. Sal
told her that in Iowa women often
had to do for themselves. He couldn�t chauffer her around so she would need to
get a local up to date drivers license. That didn�t sound so bad Annabelle
thought she might even get her own car out of this.

&nbsp;

Finally the clerk came over and asked
how she could help. Sal told her right off that his wife needed a new driver�s
license. Grunting something she handed them the forms. She actually slid them
toward Annabelle but they were intercepted by Sal. She didn�t care really who
filled out the forms though and shrugged as she walked back to her magazine.
Sal then began to fill out the forms. Annabelle was curious at what he was
writing but he wouldn�t let her see it. He then handed in the forms to the
clerk. He saw that her name tag labeled her Betty. 

&nbsp;

Shortly Betty returned to them and
went over a few things with them. First was the matter of insurance which Sal
provided proof of. Then there were a few local laws that they needed to be made
aware of. Then Betty went over physical description. Ethnicity
White. Height 5�8�. Weight
129. Hair Brown. Eyes Blue.
She then went to confirm that Annabelle didn�t need glasses. Annabelle said
that was right. Sal absently mentioned that he guessed contacts didn�t count.
Betty froze, hushed them and told them they did in fact count. Annabelle
silently cursed. Her contacts were one of her biggest secrets. Betty led her
over to the eye test. She administrated the test quickly once and then told
Betty to remove her contacts. Slowly Annabelle did so. Without them her eyes
were no longer the beautiful baby blue she was known for. Now they were just
her plain old natural brown. She then read or tried to read the eye chart
again. It was no use she had pretty bad vision without her glasses. Digging
around Betty had her try on a number of corrective lenses until she found the
one that fixed her vision. That settled she marked that Annabelle had to wear
corrective lenses when driving. 

&nbsp;

Annabelle sighed heavily and turned
to take off the glasses and put her contact lenses back in. She couldn�t find
them though. They weren�t where she left them and she couldn�t find them
anywhere. Helpfully Sal asked if she could keep the glasses until they found
her contact lenses. Betty was about to say no, but then she looked at the awful
black frames that Annabelle would have to wear and sadistically said that she
could have them. She then guided poor Annabelle over to get her new picture
taken. 

&nbsp;

This was sheer torture for
Annabelle. To have this horrible day immortalized on her driver license was
unbearable and she nearly broke down right there. Betty chuckled
a little as she took the picture and went to develop it and then laminate the
ID. Before she knew it Betty was back and after Sal paid her she handed her the
new ID. She knew it had to be horrible and avoided looking at it as long as she
could. Sal quickly led her out of the office and back to the street. Finally though Annabelle made herself look at the ID. It was
worse then she had thought. Sure the picture was crummy. It showed her awful
haircut, plain face, glasses, and her frumpy clothing from her chest up. What
was worse was what it said. Gertrude Marjorie Watkins, age 32. That wasn�t her
terrible name and that was her actual age. Sal just chuckled, called her Gerty
and told her to hurry along.

&nbsp;

Soon they came back upon their car.
The boys were still and were still goofing off in front of the hardware store.
She walked right past them and they didn�t give her a second glance. This hurt
Annabelle deeply but she kept walking. Then one of the boys called out to Sal
and asked where the hot blonde he came here with was. Sal just shrugged and
disappointed the boys went back to flinging soda cans onto the roof. Upon
hearing this Annabelle started to cry openly as she got into the car. Everything
was so different for her now looking the way she did. She was so humiliated she
wanted to die. Sal turned to look at her as he got in the car. He smiled. His
work was done. She was miserable just like him and could share in the shame of
their hiding. It may seem mean but the old saying is true misery loves company.


&nbsp;

&nbsp;














Sal was also very turned on for some reason

Going into hiding

Part 2

By Tcheser

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

After their fateful and to
Annabelle humiliating trip downtown a strange thing occurred. Sal found himself
very turned on for some reason as they drove home. He wasn�t sure if it was
from the way he had taken charge in his relationship with his wife or because
he enjoyed seeing Annabelle distressed. Whatever the reason though they arrived
back at their FBI supplied house in record time. He then pulled the woman who
was for all intents and purposes �Gerty� into the house by her elbow. From
there he led her into the bedroom only stopping long enough to drop her new
clothes off by the dresser. He then tossed her onto the bed and started
unbuckling his pants. 

&nbsp;

Gerty had been confused at first
but now realized that Sal was randy. Although she wasn�t really in the mood she
had always found in the past that having sex with Sal got her what she wanted. If
she had wanted to take a trip she would sleep with him to get it. If she wanted
a new fur coat sex was again the answer. She had yet to find a situation that
sex couldn�t get her what she wanted. So she decided she would end his little
tirade the old fashion way. She gave him a sexy smile and positioned herself on
the pillows for him. When he was naked he came to her and told her he was going
to take her like they do in the Midwest. She happily
smiled and prepared herself for some pleasure. 

&nbsp;

It didn�t come though. Sal simply
pushed up her skirt, pulled down her awful cotton briefs and slid inside her. Less
then two minutes later he blew his wad and pulled out. He gave her one kiss and
rolled over. She lay there for a few minutes expecting more. When it didn�t
come she finally complained. She asked where her orgasm was. Laughing Sal said
that was her problem. If she wanted him to get involved with that kind of a
thing from now on she was going to have to be a very good little wifey indeed.
From now on she would perform her wifely duty without question or special
reward.

&nbsp;

Furious Gerty rolled over to the
nightstand by the bed. Pulling open the bottom drawer she came back with her
trusted friend. It was a foot long pinkish vibrator of the latest ergonomic
design. She looked at it like a kid with a hot fudge Sunday and her look was
similar to that same kid having been told he was diabetic when Sal suddenly
snatched it away from her. Gerty asked him what was going on and he said simply
that good little Iowa wives
didn�t use such things. If she wanted pleasure she was going to have to play
ball. Pouting she became suddenly very irritable and tried to grab it back from
Sal. He was much stronger though and easily kept it away from her. He then took
the pink vibrator and smashed it hard against the wall. It busted into several
pieces and then fell to the ground dead.

&nbsp;

For her insolence and childish
behavior Sal then did something he had never done before except in play. He
grabbed Gerty and pulled her over his lap. Her panties already down she then
received a hard bare bottom spanking. This left her crying again and kicking
and bawling like a little girl. When he was done he asked her to apologize for
her behavior toward him. When she refused he gave her another hard set of
spankings. After receiving these stinging smacks she did as he asked and very
contritely apologized for her bad behavior.

&nbsp;

Sal then got up and took Annabelle
by the ear pulling her painfully up with him. She squealed in pain as her
sensitive ear was twisted and pulled. Sal led her into the living room and
positioned her face first in the corner. She was to stay there quietly until he
said otherwise. When she went to pull up her panties he swatted her hands away
and told her they stayed where they were. To further illustrate the point that
he wanted her bare red ass on display he pinned her ugly skirt to her back so
nothing obscured it. He then left her there with a stern warning that if she
moved or so much as took her nose out of the corner she would get another
spanking. From the other room she could hear Sal rummaging about, but had no
idea what he was doing. She didn�t dare turn around. 

&nbsp;

A half hour into her punishment she
began to feel the real effects of what Sal had done. Being spanked was one
thing, but to have to stand on display for all the world to see showing her
shameful behind was another. She was also getting quite tired of standing with
her nose pressed into the corner. She wasn�t used to this kind of thing at all.
She alternated lifting one foot up at a time to get them off the floor. She was
about to summon up her courage and call to Sal to beg to be released when there
was suddenly a disturbance she hadn�t expected. 

&nbsp;

She heard the front door open and
someone come in. A moment later she heard the voice of her next door neighbor
calling to Sal. Worse yet she was getting closer as she came down the short
entrance hallway to where Gerty stood bare assed. Fearing being humiliated in
front of the fat, very lower middle class neighbor Judy, more then Sal for the
moment, Gerty sprang into action and dove behind the sofa. From there she saw
the very down to earth, plump, church going, Judy walk past following Sal�s
voice as he called her to join him in the bedroom. 

&nbsp;

Crouched behind the sofa Gerty then
tried to hear the two speaking. From where she was though it all sounded like
gibberish. After a few minutes Judy left the bedroom shortly followed by Sal.
From the sound of things Sal was giving Judy a hand with something, but Gerty
wasn�t sure what. They went outside and came back in and went to the bedroom
several times. Finally they seemed done and were discussing something
pleasantly on the porch. Deciding she had to know what was going on and that
they would be on the porch for a few minutes Gerty slipped into the bedroom. 

&nbsp;

At first everything seemed normal.
The bedroom was neat. The bed was made. The dresser straight. Then she went
into the big walk in closet. She screamed when she saw what had been done.
While she had been in the living room facing the wall Sal had removed all her
clothes from the closet. All her fashionable designer clothes were gone. Her
Versace, her DKNY, her Gucci, her Fendi, her St. Laurent,
her Bebe, everything was gone. There was nothing left but the other two gross
outfits Sal had purchased her earlier. Hurrying to the dresser she found the
same. All her hip clothes were gone, right down to her Victoria�s
secret lingerie and tight jeans. Nothing was left. 

&nbsp;

Then it hit her. Sal had given all
her clothes to Judy. Running as fast as she could in the god awful keds she
sped out to the porch to stop Sal. Bursting out the front door onto the porch she
was crushed to see that Judy was already pulling away. She could see that there
were boxes full of what she recognized as her expensive wardrobe piled in the
back of her pickup truck. On the boxes it said in black magic marker �for
church sale�. She was too late. She fell hard to her knees and started crying
and bawling again. This was worse in many ways for a clotheshorse like her then
the spanking was. She thought Sal understood this when he looked down and gave
her a very ironic smile. He however didn�t seem to though.

&nbsp;

He let her cry for a bit. Then he
told her how wrong it was of her to leave the corner when she was told not to.
He then grabbed her by the arm and pulled her to her feet. Right there on the
porch he then sat down on the steps and made her lay over his lap again for the
second time that day. Her skirt was already pinned up so he only had to pull
down her panties again as she had pulled them back up. Once her cute little
bottom was bare again Sal laid into her with his strong open handed smacks. 

&nbsp;

He spanked her hard and fast this
time so before she knew it she was screaming in pain and frustration and
kicking her feet like mad. She kicked her legs so furiously in fact that one of
her shoes came off. It flew it a lazy arc off the porch and landed in the
bushes. Sal took note of where it landed, but didn�t let up from his spanking
of Gerty for one second. She was very mad as well though and cursed and spat at
him for getting rid of all her fancy designer clothes. She told him how
expensive they were and how long it had taken her to buy them all and how
stupid of him it had been to give them away. Sal didn�t let up one bit though despite
her accusations that he was a bastard and a sadist and going crazy.

&nbsp;

Sal only stopped when some of the
neighbors started to come out of their houses to see what was going on. Before
they got too good a look at what was going on though he shoved Gerty off his
lap and led her by the ear back inside away from prying eyes. For that at least
she was thankful. Once inside though her punishment continued. She was dragged
into the kitchen and shoved up against the sink. Sal then lathered up a bar of
ivory soap real good and shoved it in her mouth. The taste was awful. He made
sure she tasted it fully too. He methodically rubbed it all around her tongue
and mouth and more then a little was scraped off onto her teeth. A thick foam
rose from her mouth like a rabid dog and at that moment she didn�t think she
could get any angrier at Sal. He didn�t even let her rinse out after her mouth
washing. He let her spit a couple times but that was all. 

&nbsp;

Then Sal said it was lunchtime.
Normally they would have ordered in or gone out, but today was different. Sal
wanted Gerty to make lunch with her own two hands. Just as she had made breakfast
and would be making all meals from now on Sal reminded her. Humbly Gerty did as
she was told. She wasn�t eager to get another spanking. As her husband watched
her she went about preparing lunch all the time with her bright red ass on full
display and almost dying from the soap still in her mouth. It was terrible and
it was very hard for Gerty to concentrate on what she was doing. She moved
around the kitchen like a drunk person, but finally managed to heat up a frozen
pizza and make a tossed green salad. Sal was amused by the whole spectacle
though and just watched with a wry smile plastered all over his mug.

&nbsp;

When lunch was finally ready he had
Gerty set it all up on the dining room table. By then it had begun to rain and
the sound broke the eerie silence that had fallen over the household. Sal had
her sit with him to eat. It didn�t escape either of them that she would be
sitting on her bare blistered ass. Sal didn�t mention it, but took delight in
watching her try to delicately lower herself onto the chair. Gerty for her part
decided she was going to do whatever Sal wanted in order to escape more
punishment. Sooner or later he would tire of this game and she would be able to
work her old tricks. Then she would have things the way she wanted them again.
It was just a matter of having patience and waiting Sal out.

&nbsp;

So after a tense but quiet dinner
Gerty did all the dishes and pans by hands just as Sal told her to. They had a
dishwasher of course, but Sal still made Gerty wash the dishes by hand. He told
her that her hands were too soft. The soap and hot water would toughen them up.
Gerty didn�t like that idea, but did as she was told. She washed the pots and
pans and dishes and glasses as carefully as she could. She tried to be thorough
so Sal could find no fault and make her do it again. When she finished the
kitchen was spotless. 

&nbsp;

Sal watched it rain through the living
room window and drank his single malt scotch while she did this. He only
checked up on her a few times and never found her goofing off or slacking
because she wasn�t. She even mopped the kitchen floor to a spic and span shine
which was something she had never done before. Seemingly satisfied with her
work Sal invited her to come join him in the living room when she was finished.

&nbsp;

Still uncertain whether or not a
punishment was forthcoming Gerty entered the living room contritely. She still
had her skirt pinned up; her panties pulled down and was still missing one
shoe. Sal noticed this and had to stifle a little laugh. He called her to come
over to where he sat on the easy chair. In doing so she came to stand within
arms reach and feared another spanking from Sal. This feeling was only
reinforced when he reached around and grabbed her panties. This time though he
pulled them up and then unpinned her skirt so it fell back to where it normally
hung. It was a bit wrinkled but still in far better shape then her poor ass. He
inspected her for a moment and she stood before him nervously. 

&nbsp;

Abruptly he pointedly asked her
where her shoe was. She looked down at her one bare foot in nothing but its
white sock. Almost of its own volition it seemed to try and hide behind her
other foot. She said she must have lost it when they were outside. Sal asked if
she meant when he had been disciplining her for disobeying him like a naughty
little girl. She said that was the case. Not satisfied Sal made her say it.
Choking on her shame Gerty did as Sal commanded. She said she had lost her shoe
when Sal had been forced to discipline her for disobeying him like a naughty
little girl.

&nbsp;

Sal then told her she would have to
go get her shoe. She couldn�t just walk around with one shoe. Gerty nodded and
turned to head outside to find her lost shoe. Sal however stopped her before
she got two paces. She had no idea what he wanted now, but turned to face him
and find out. He told her that it was raining outside and even pointed out the
window. Gerty said she understood that. Sal however said he didn�t think she
did. He explained that as it was raining outside she would get wet if she went
outside. He knew she didn�t want her new clothes wet after all not did she?
Gerty knew the answer he wanted to hear and gave it to him. She said she
absolutely did not want to get her new clothes wet. Sal said he was glad she
understood and told her to remove her skirt and blouse. Reluctantly she did so.
Sal took the terrible outfit and placed it carefully on the coffee table. He
said it would be here for here when she returned with her shoe. Aghast at what
Sal seemed to be suggesting Gerty just stood there. Only a slap across her
tender buttocks got her moving again.

&nbsp;

When she was outside and alone on the
front porch in her Gerty paused again. She couldn�t believe what was happening.
Did Sal really want her to run around outside in her underwear? It certainly
seemed so. Despite this she still mulled it over for a few moments. Finally
though she went ahead and did as she was told. Still raining hard she noted she
decided to take off her remaining shoe and her socks and go barefoot. This done
she crept quickly down the porch steps and ran across the lawn looking for her
shoe. She didn�t really know where it had gone like Sal who saw where it had
landed did. So she scoured the tall grass for her lost footwear. Several times
cars went by and she hurried and hid. Once she hid behind a bush and once
between the trash cans. She couldn�t be seen like this she declared.

&nbsp;

So between the rain and the
interruptions in her search it took a good ten minutes for her to find the
shoe. It was stuck in one of the bushes closest to the porch. She was already
soaked as she crossed the flower beds to get to the bush. It certainly didn�t improve
her mood any when she slipped in the squishy mud and fell hard into the flower
bed. Lying on her back in the flowerbed she couldn�t help but laugh in
frustration. The whole situation was ludicrous. When she struggled back to her
feet and finally recovered her errant shoe from the bush she surveyed the
damage. She had crushed quite a few flowers, but more importantly she had landed
in the mud. Her whole backside and upper thighs were covered in the thick mud. 

&nbsp;

Cursing she began to stomp back to
the house when she was frozen with terror as she heard someone call her name
from the street. Peeking over her shoulder she saw it was another of her
neighbors, Rosie. She was a tall buxom redhead who carried only a few extra
pounds despite being a couple years Gerty�s senior. She was good looking in
what Gerty considered a very common sort of way. She always wore nice dresses
that nevertheless showcased her very eye pleasing figure and was never seen
without perfectly styled hair, heels and stockings. She was the so-called
neighborhood hottie. At least she had been before Annabelle had moved into the
area and stolen the secret desires and looks of all the neighborhood men.
Stealing the title of hottie from Rosie had been amusing to Annabelle. She
enjoyed the attention and hadn�t even really made much of a secret of it. Rosie
worked as a hairdresser out of a little shop attached to her home which
explained why she was home in the middle of the day.

&nbsp;

Because of all this Gerty couldn�t
face Rosie looking as she did now. She had just had a horrendous makeover,
endured several spankings and was wearing nothing but her mud spattered
underwear. Worse still she looked nearly flat-chested in the unflattering bra
Sal had made her wear. She hated to admit it but she had never really been that
big up top. With a proper padded pushup bra and the right clothes no one ever
noticed and generally thought she was more then well proportioned. She didn�t
want Rosie to see how plainly underdeveloped Gerty was compared to herself.
What were her choices though? She was still trying to decide what to do when Rosie
came up her sidewalk to her. Lacking any other options she tried to scurry back
inside and pretend she hadn�t seen her. She could deny the whole event later
and tell Rosie she must have seen someone else.

&nbsp;

Running on the slick grass proved a
problem though. Her delicate foot somehow landed on a sharp acorn startling her
and Gerty again fall to the ground. This time she fell nearly on her face. Rosie
helped her up, the whole time chuckling. The tall redhead towered over her even
more then Rita at the store had. Rosie couldn�t believe that this sad rain drenched
dirty underwear wearing woman was her once beautiful rival. Her latest tumble
had dirtied the front of Gerty�s soaked bra and briefs as well as given her
skinned knees. Rosie looked lovely as always with her long red hair and perfect
makeup. She was prepared for the rain as well unlike Gerty and wore a long coat
and carried an umbrella. 

&nbsp;

Sounding concerned Rosie asked her
what was going on? Why was she outside in the rain, barefoot and in her
underwear? Gerty couldn�t tell her the truth. Sal would kill her if she told Rosie
what was going on. So she told Rosie just that she had come outside without
thinking and now she had to go. Before she went though Rosie commented on her
new look. She said she understood that natural was in, but told Gerty not to
take it so far. She could be rather attractive if she wore something nice and
did something with her face and hair she said. Infuriated Gerty didn�t even
reply. She just stalked off back toward the house with Rosie�s laughter
reverberating in her ears.

&nbsp;

Sal was waiting for her in the
foyer when she entered the house. He looked disapprovingly at her and told her
to hurry into the bathroom. She should take a hot shower and get out of the wet
underwear she had ruined playing in the mud. He would bring her some fresh
clothes. Nodding contritely Gerty did as she was told and scampered off to the
bathroom. She ran a nice hot shower. Under the streams of high pressure water
she began to relax for the first time that day. She didn�t even hear Sal come
in with her clothes. She was too intoxicated by the sweet motion of the water
against her nude body. Already overheated by Sal�s frustrating teasing earlier
and more perversely by the whole spanking and stripping she couldn�t resist
sliding her hand down her firm belly and between her legs. 

&nbsp;

Then the water suddenly turned
bitterly cold. She was shocked back to reality and leapt from the freezing
shower. She cursed Sal. The water only turned cold like that when someone
turned on the dishwasher. What was he washing anyway, his scotch glass? Gerty
had washed everything else. Teeth still chattering and holding her arms around
herself for warmth she then looked for a towel. 

&nbsp;

Gerty then tried to do something
with her hair, but the bowl cut she had received at the salon didn�t really
give her a lot of styling options. There wasn�t much she could do with her high
straight bangs and short, now dull brown hair. She found a package of hair dye
hidden under the sink. She used it for touch ups occasionally. She considered
for a moment dying her hair back to the blonde it had been that morning. Then
at least she wouldn�t look so pale and washed out. She would look more like she
had before. Unfortunately with Sal acting the way he was she was certain she
would be punished quite severely for doing such a thing. He would probably make
her march right back down to the horrid little salon that had butchered her
hair in the first place and beg them to dye it mousey blonde again. This on top
of whatever other sadistic punishment he came up with. She decided neither she
nor her hair could take any of that right now and stashed the package of dye
back where she found it. Then sighing heavily to herself she styled her hideous
head of hair exactly as the hairdresser at the salon had and slipped on the horrid
black framed eyeglasses Sal was making her wear. She couldn�t believe Sal was
doing all this to her.

&nbsp;

She then noted the clothes her
bastard of a husband had brought her. She had expected what she found but was
still displeased with it. Sal had brought her another of the outfits they had
purchased that morning. This one was the green dress with purple appliqu�. With
it of course was another plain white bra, matching panties and ankle socks.
Dutifully she put the ugly ensemble on and tried not to look too often at her
displeasing reflection in the bathroom mirror.

&nbsp;

Dressed Gerty left the bathroom to
rejoin Sal in the living room. He barely seemed to notice her. He just motioned
for her to join him on the sofa. He was watching television. She did as he commanded
silently and sat rather stiffly by him. It was hard to relax when he was in one
of these moods she found. She had to be on constant guard. It was all for
naught though. Nothing more happened that night. They watched TV until eleven
and then went to bed. Gerty slept in the one nightgown Sal hadn�t given away.
It was a plain cotton long sleeved number that came down to her calves. It was a
miserable night of perfunctory sex for Gerty and then silence until morning.

Going into hiding

Part 3

By Tcheser

&nbsp;

Gerty was awoken abruptly at six
again the next morning and pushed out of bed. Once again she was told by Sal to
make breakfast. This time she didn�t argue and did her best to please him. She
made frozen waffles with butter and maple syrup and about a pound of bacon. Sal
informed her that they had a waffle maker and next time it would be used. Gerty
didn�t even know they had a waffle maker or where it was, let alone know how to
make waffles from scratch. Sal then added that she had made far too much bacon.
He appreciated her efforts and all, but as she apparently didn�t know these
things he felt obliged to tell her when she made a mistake. Otherwise she might
never learn the correct way of doing things. Gerty nodded that she understood,
but said nothing. Sal then made polite conversation while they ate giving her
no further clues as to how the day was to proceed. It was torture for poor
nervous Gerty. As they were finishing up though she caught a
break. 

&nbsp;

The phone rang. 

&nbsp;

Sal went and answered it and from what
Gerty could overhear it sounded like it was Sal�s FBI handler, Joe Martell. She
couldn�t stand the guy. He was very stodgy and always seemed to be looking at
her like he thought she was a tramp. She continued to listen as she cleared the
breakfast dishes. Then she carefully picked up the extension in the kitchen so
she could hear both sides of the conversation. She smiled when she heard that the
Joe needed Sal to come into their branch office today. The branch office was
two towns away. Sal would be gone at the very least most of the day. Sal agreed
of course and the agent said he would pick him up in a
couple hours. 

&nbsp;

So for the next two hours Gerty
anxiously awaited Sal�s departure. He hadn�t mentioned anything about his
eminent meeting with the FBI to her so she couldn�t let on that she knew. In
the meantime he directed her in cleaning the house. He painstakingly wrote out
a chore list for her to follow. He had to watch her though as he found Gerty
didn�t even know the difference between cleanser and soap. This was a job the
maid, Maria or Maribel or something, usually did so Gerty never had to. From
what Sal said the maid would soon be unemployed though. Gerty was to do all the
household chores from now on. When the maid arrived the next morning Sal was
going to break the news to her. 

&nbsp;

Finally there was a honk. Sal
peeked out the window and confirmed it was the FBI agent here to pick him up.
It appeared to be so he prepared to leave. Before doing so though he warned Gerty.
He told her to do her chores as marked on the list he made for her or she would
be in big trouble. Then he left the house and Gerty was alone. She made sure
the FBI car was fading in the distance before she moved into action though.

&nbsp;

She had been waiting for an
opportunity like this and already knew what she was going to do. She was going
to show Sal that he could boss her and cajole her, but she wouldn�t be his
slave. She called a cab and prepared to go out. She couldn�t stand to go out
the way she was dressed though. Fortunately she had a little stash Sal didn�t
know about. Going into the garage she pulled out the shopping bags she had
stashed behind the workbench a few days ago. She had purchased a new outfit
from an expensive store after Sal had told her not to buy any new clothes. So
she had been forced to hide it until he cooled down. That plan didn�t really
work, but at least he had been unaware of it when he gave away all her other
clothes.

&nbsp;

Bringing the bags into her bedroom
she quickly pulled off her nightshirt and socks. Then standing before her floor
length mirror she began to dress in the decadent new outfit; a short white
designer skirt and a matching jacket with silk stockings and sexy heels. Her
hair was a mess, but it looked somewhat decent when she slicked it all back
with styling gel and made her face up glamorously. She found her emergency
spare set of contact lenses, popped them in looking instantly better she thought.
She then took the pair of eyeglasses she had been given at the DMV and threw
them on the ground so she could crush them with her heel. The sound of the
glass breaking was very satisfying. That done she found her purse and went out
to meet her taxi finally feeling like herself again.

&nbsp;

She was going the finest restaurant
in town to meet with one of her oldest and dearest friends, Genevieve DuPont,
the wife of a very wealthy industrialist. She had called her friend just days
earlier and had been surprised to find out she was currently staying at a fancy
health spa only a few hours away from where the FBI had stranded Gerty. She was
a gorgeous woman with elegantly coiffed dark hair. She wore only the finest
French designs and fragrances. Her long black dress had a high slit up one side
and she wore strappy black heels that were straight from Paris.
Thousands of dollars of jewelry graced her ears, neck and wrists. She was
pleased to see Annabelle, but couldn�t help but make a least one catty remark
about her friends new hairdo. Over fine French fusion cuisine Annabelle then told
her how horrible Sal had been. Genevieve was naturally very sympathetic. She
couldn�t imagine a man taking charge like Sal had. In her social circle it was
unheard of. She agreed to help Annabelle in any way she could. Genevieve said
she would let Annabelle stay with her until she could get a divorce or
whatever.

&nbsp;

She then put the expensive lunch on
her husbands AMEX black card and they then decided to go back to the safe
house. Annabelle needed to get a few things from there before leaving town with
Genevieve. Slipping inside she worked as fast as she could. At first she did at
least. Then feeling cocky and a bit vindictive she stopped to play some pranks
on Sal. She stole all his petty cash, ripped the breast pockets on all his
suits, smoked his cigars and drank his favorite cognac with Genevieve.

&nbsp;

They were still there laughing,
drinking and smoking on the sofa together when Sal walked into the room a
couple hours later. Sal demanded to know what was going on. At first the two
women were stunned into silence. Then Annabelle gathered up her courage. Most
of this of course came from the cognac though of course, so her next words were
ill chosen. She stood on somewhat unsteady feet and told Sal she wasn�t going
to let him treat her like he had been anymore. She said he was a bully and an
asshole and worse. Sal for his part just stood there and listened. 

&nbsp;

When she was finished venting and
cursing at Sal she went silent and just fumed. Sal then turned to Genevieve. He
asked her what her part in this was. She stood boldly and told him how his wife
had come to her for help and she had agreed to give it. She thought what he had
done was horrible and she wouldn�t stand for it. She was going to help
Annabelle see to it that Sal paid for what he did. 

&nbsp;

Sal nodded and then told them how
it was going to be. He had come home some time ago and found them drunk on the
couch with his cigars and smokes. He investigated a little around the house and
noticed all they had done. He was displeased. So he went back out quietly the
way he had come. He had some things to do. While he was out he also called
Genevieve�s husband. At hearing this Genevieve visibly blanched. Sal continued
and told her how her husband, Armin, couldn�t believe how she had behaved.
Encouraging an errant wife to try and leave her loving husband, stealing from
him and vandalizing his possessions were all things he didn�t approve of.
Suddenly nervous Genevieve demanded to know what else her husband had said. Sal
smirked and stepped closer to Genevieve. She was tall for a woman, but was still
dwarfed by his great height. He told her Armin had given him permission, nay
begged, Sal to deal with her as he saw fit. She wasn�t welcome at home until as
Armin put it �She has been straightened out.�

&nbsp;

Genevieve couldn�t believe her ears
and refused to believe her husband had said that. She had him wrapped around
her little finger. He would never let a brute like Sal lay a hand on her. She
turned to get her cell from her purse so she could confirm. She found the
service had been disconnected though. Sal told her there was no point in
calling her husband anyway. He had said just what Sal had told her almost word
for word. As much as she wanted to call Sal a liar and spit in his face deep
down Genevieve knew this to be true. Sal would never lie about something like
that. He could be killed over something like that. Still she was Genevieve
DuPont! Who did Sal think he was? She spat in his face, called him a pig and
smiled victoriously. 

&nbsp;

Sal said nothing immedietly he just wiped off the spit and then to Genevieve�s
horror, and that of Annabelle who was looking on, pulled her by slender wrist
over to a high backed armless chair with him. Then once sitting Sal grabbed her
skirt at the hem and tore it in two starting from the high slit already in it.
He tossed the torn and ruined garment away revealing an almost nude Genevieve.
All she had on now was a flimsy black thong and heels. She hadn�t been wearing
a bra. Her pale skin blushed red with embarrassment and anger. She tried again
to get away and called for Annabelle to help her. Her friend however was too
terrified. The confidence the alcohol had instilled in her was fleeing her quickly.
She just stood there watching petrified. Getting no help from Annabelle, Sal
had no trouble dragging Genevieve back to the chair. There he removed her
diamond earrings and necklace. He said she didn�t deserve such things and would
give them to someone more worthy. 

&nbsp;

She wasn�t beaten yet though and
was just about to make another break for it when Sal threw her over his lap. He
pinned her arms, one under her and one behind her and once this was done she
was helpless. Then agonizingly slow her black thong panties were drawn down her
long shapely legs until they rested around her ankles. She had just long enough
realize how exposed she was before the spanking began. For this Sal didn�t hold
back. Genevieve was even more spoiled, arrogant and selfish then Annabelle. She
had been born rich and married even richer. Such a sheltered existence had
spawned one of the coldest, most spiteful and useless creatures Sal had ever
seen. She was a real pit viper. 

&nbsp;

So he began her punishment with a
good fifteen minute spanking. He alternated hands when needed and cheeks when
he felt like it. The whole time he admonished her for sticking her nose where
it didn�t belong and for generally being a miserable useless thing. Her ass
reddened quickly and soon began to turn crimson. Halfway though she began
crying and blubbering like a fool. Her tears made her makeup run and it all
mixed with her snot and dripped off her chin onto the carpet. Genevieve had never been spanked before in her life and found the
experience as excruciating as it was humiliating. 

&nbsp;

When Sal was finally finished with
her he pushed her off his lap and she fell in a crumpled mess on the floor. He
then told her to get up and stand in the corner. Still bawling she stood and
tried to do as he said. Her heels had come off as well so she now stood
barefoot. Her panties being at her ankles made it difficult so she went to pull
them up. Sal told her not to and slapped her already ruined ass again making
her jump. Seeing that she had to leave her panties where they were she had to
half stumble and half hop to get to the corner. She nearly fell several times,
but finally made it to her relief. 

&nbsp;

Sal next turned his attention to
his wife. She had been disciplined just like Genevieve several times already.
She was quite stubborn, more stubborn then he had suspected, but that just made
it all the more fun. He started off nice though. He called Gerty over to him
and complimented her on her new outfit. This unnerved her quite a bit. Then he
had her sit on his knee and explain her thinking. She
started slowly but soon was telling him everything she had done that day and
why. She began to think he wanted to settle things reasonably. Then it all fell
apart suddenly. He turned everything she had done around on her as the childish
antics of a spoiled brat. Not only had she been disobedient she had actually
endangered them by meeting with Genevieve. They were supposed to be in the
Federal Witness Protection Program after all. She apologized rapidly and
profusely.

&nbsp;

Sal said this was noted, but
misbehavior bears consequences. He told her that since she chose to disobey him
and act like an idiotic and spoiled child, then there was only one punishment
appropriate for her. She was already sniffling and crying and he had yet to do
anything to her he noticed. Without another word, he pulled her new skirt down
her legs and off and handed it to her. She wore no panties. He told her to wipe
her eyes and blow her nose. She was hesitant, but she could tell by looking at
his patient steady gaze that he wasn�t joking. So reluctantly she did as she
was told and blew her nose on her beautiful new skirt. When she was done he
grabbed her and pulled her face first over his knees again. 

&nbsp;

Gerty couldn�t stand to be in this
situation again after being so close to escape. She kicked and tried to free
herself to no avail. She found her battle with her tears was getting harder.
She could not believe this! It wasn�t fair! Spanked again?!? Not if she could
help it! 

&nbsp;

Sal told her she could struggle all
she wanted. It wouldn�t change a thing. He patted her bottom gently for a
moment, almost as if to reassure her, then lifted his hand and brought it down
hard on her bottom---his hand was large and nearly covered it entirely. Gerty
gasped and cried out. She begged Sal not to strike her again. Sal ignored her
completely though and proceeded to soundly spank her wobbling bottom. Gerty
struggled as best she could to avoid the blows, but it did no good. There was
no escape from Sal�s stinging hand. The pain was intense and soon she began to
cry even harder then she had been as her bottom was still very tender from the
spanking she had received earlier. She begged frantically between her sobs for
her husband to stop, to have mercy.

&nbsp;

And he did stop for a moment. He
rubbed her back soothingly for a second before speaking. He asked her why she
thought she was being punished.� Gerty
sobbed for a moment, her delicate shoulders heaving. Then told him she was
being punished for leaving the house. Sal wasn�t satisfied with that and urged
her to answer fully. When she didn�t right away he landed a particularly hard
smack on her bottom. Gerty jumped and howled at the impact. She answered
though. She told him she was being punished because she snuck out with
Genevieve and was planning to leave him and had stolen and vandalized his
belongings. 

&nbsp;

Sal told her that was correct and told
her she had another 100 spanks coming for it. She nodded and then moaned as he
began spanking her again. The majority of the stinging blows all seemed to be landing
in relatively the same spot she noticed and mentally cursed her husband. Sal
wasn�t quite certain that Gerty was learning, but he was sure she would think
of this moment the next time she considered acting up again. When he finally
finished her lovely bottom was two shades darker then Genevieve�s crimson
blotched derriere.

&nbsp;

Then he rubbed her backside in slow
steady circles driving her mad with conflicting emotions. Her tiny bottom hurt
so very badly. She sobbed and sobbed. What a rotten day she had had. She had
not been able to spend all the time out that she had wanted, she hadn�t gotten
away and she had received another spanking! In the last few days she had
received more spankings then she had in the rest of her whole life. Damn this
high handed man! She moaned again, trying to reach back and rub her sore bottom,
so embarrassed that she was in this position again. Sal wouldn�t let her rub
her bottom though. 

&nbsp;

Sal made her get up and go stand in
the corner. A different corner from her little girlfriend he added. She obeyed
quickly, anything to get away from his stinging hand. He told them not to move
or they would be very sorry and then left them alone to stew in their own
anguish for a bit. Neither one of them moved an inch from where he left them.

&nbsp;

Sal didn�t mention their obedience
though when he returned a few minutes later. He was still in punishment mode
and with him was Rosie, their neighbor and until recently Gerty�s only real
competition for local hottie. Gerty, despite having just been spanked again for
her attitude and behavior demanded to know why Rosie was there. She couldn�t
bear to be seen by her rival standing in the corner with fresh tears in her
eyes, half naked with her bare red ass on display. Sal hushed her quickly
though by taking off his black leather belt and asking her if she wanted to see
how it felt on her naughty behind.

&nbsp;

Rosie for her part seemed rather
amused by the sight of the two formerly glamorous and aloof women standing in
the corners after having obviously just being spanked. She had always suspected
there wasn�t much under all the fancy clothes, makeup and haughty attitude. Now
seeing Gerty and Genevieve stripped of these affectations she saw that she had
been right. They looked like little more then skinny little teenage brats fresh
from receiving a spanking from their Pa.
She kept these observations and feelings to herself though and followed Sal�s
lead. 

&nbsp;

He told the women they were taking
a short trip. He told them to get dressed and to hurry. He was in no mood to
wait. Worried about where they were going but pleased that they could get
dressed Gerty and Genevieve left their respective corners and went to pick up
their cast off clothing. Sal stopped them though and grabbed the clothes from
their hands. He told them he was going to keep the garments they had worn that
day as a further penalty for their bad behavior. Then he made them strip off
whatever they were still wearing and give it to him. Only once this was done
did Sal dismiss them to go to Gerty�s room and put something decent on.

&nbsp;

Gerty of course no longer had a
closet full of beautiful clothes to wear. Sal had taken care of that when he
boxed them up and gave them all away to be sold at the church. Now Gerty had
all of three dresses left and all of them were hideous. Sal had purchased them
for her at a terrible little dress shop just to torture his vain wife. She had
already worn two of the dresses and they were now in the hamper. She dug out
the awful dress she had worn the day before and gave Genevieve the dreadful
denim frock with the stupid lace collar. Cursing they both dressed quickly and
it was a good thing as Sal only gave them a few minutes before he came to the
bedroom and dragged them out. They both looked horrible and Genevieve didn�t
even have any shoes to wear.

&nbsp;

Then Sal and Rosie led Gerty and
Genevieve across the street to Rosie�s house. Both women were confused as to
why they were there. What part was Rosie to play in all of this? Her home
though was more or less what Gerty expected. Lower middle
class and a very common. She certainly didn�t have Gerty�s sophisticated
tastes and posh sensibilities. Sal told her it was a nice place though and even
complimented her on a few decorations. Gerty wasn�t sure if he was for real or
not. To her Rosie�s things looked like she must have found them at a garage
sale. She had Furniture that didn�t look like it was even made this century.

&nbsp;

They didn�t stay there long though.
Rosie led them through the living room into the kitchen and through a door that
led to her work area. Her hairdressing salon. Gerty
didn�t like where this was going and she and Genevieve shared a concerned look.
Then Genevieve tried to bolt out of the room. She ran into Sal though who grabbed
her and sat her down in one of the salon chairs. He told her if she tried that
again he would have Rosie shave her bald. Mortified at the very thought she
remained very still after that. She did however ask what Sal and Rosie were up
to. As Rosie put a smock around her Sal was happy enough to explain.

&nbsp;

����������� He told her
that she was just like Gerty, if not worse. She was spoiled, selfish, and
elitist. And just like Gerty she wasn�t going to get away with it. Not on his
watch. He could think of nothing at the moment he would rather do then put her
in her place. Teach her the error of her ways. So he was going to make her look
like one of the women she so looked down on. One of the women who might not
look like a fashion model because she�s too busy taking care of her family,
working or volunteering for a cause that needs her. A woman of substance,
unlike the superficial flake she was. 

&nbsp;

Genevieve gave Sal a look of such
ire at that point Sal couldn�t help but laugh. Then he gave Rosie a smile and
told her to make Genevieve presentable just as they had discussed. She returned
his smile and went to work humming a cheerful country tune that stabbed at Genevieve�s
nerves. Genevieve asked what was going on. What were they going to do to her
lovely hair? Rosie just said that she would see when they were done.

&nbsp;

����������� Sal just
sat down in one of the waiting chairs next to Gerty and pretended to read a
magazine. Gerty tried not to watch what she was certain was to be a mutilation,
but couldn�t help it. Rosie was giving Genevieve a haircut and an undesired one
at that. It was clear the hairdresser enjoyed giving it to her as well. The
same however couldn�t be said for the woman sitting in terrified in the salon
chair. Gerty saw her friend cringe when Rosie�s shears came toward her head.
She let out a little wail when Rosie made the first cut and every time after
that when the shears cut away another lock of her gorgeous pampered hair. Rosie
didn�t seem to notice or perhaps didn�t care how Genevieve felt. Gerty imagined
Rosie might actually be enjoying the whole process and that made her hate the
woman all the more. Fresh tears rolled down her friend�s cheeks when her once
long lustrous hair was finally all cut away. She could see the beautiful hair
laying all around her and in the mirror the horrible reflection of what she was
left with. Rosie had cut off almost all her hair. It was only about two inches
long now and the same length all over.

&nbsp;

����������� She only
got to mourn her hair for a short time though. Before Genevieve knew it Rosie
led her over to a sink, forced her to lay her head back and gently but
forcefully washed her hair. Seeing all her smeared and running makeup Rosie
quickly washed Genevieve�s face off as well. She said she looked much sweeter
without all that stuff anyway. Gerty couldn�t help but scoff at that notion.
She could only believe that if sweeter and plainer meant the same thing. 

&nbsp;

Genevieve was then led back to her
salon chair and Rosie went at her hair again. His time however she wasn�t
cutting or trimming. This time she brought out some very foul smelling solution
and a bowl of pink and green rollers and proceeded to give the fancy lady from New
  York a very down home perm. Genevieve was naturally
horrified. She had never had or wanted a perm. Her hair was lustrous and thick.
She didn�t want those chemicals in messing with it. Unfortunately there was
nothing she could do about it. Rosie was giving her a perm and Sal was sitting
right across from them insuring that it would indeed be given. So her hair was
permed with the multitude of little pink and green rollers despite her wishes.
Impotent she just fixed her eyes on the floor and tried not to watch.

&nbsp;

When Rosie was done she whisked the
smock off Genevieve and pulled her quickly out of the chair so she could brush
off any stray hairs. To Genevieve it felt like she had no hair left. Like she
was bald or something, but she did still have hair. She just didn�t have much
of it and it was all tightly curled around her head. This style made her look a
least a decade older. Only women in their golden years wore their hair like
that after all. She certainly didn�t look like she should be on a fashion
runway now. After having her long hair decimated and permed, having her makeup
all washed off and made to wear a frumpy nearly shapeless denim housedress she
looked more like an old spinster librarian. It was a shock that left Genevieve
speechless and staring at herself in the mirror almost catatonically.

&nbsp;

Sal looked at her and said it was a
good start. She looked more like a decent woman now, but he knew she still
wasn�t. It was going to take a lot of hard work for them to turn the corner and
even more to get themselves back in his good graces after their shameful
display that day. He said it was evident that Gerty and Jenny (Formerly
Genevieve) had far too much free time on their hands. That however was going to
change. He was going to make sure of that. Tomorrow would be a busy day he said
and with that he said good evening to Rosie and led the two former beauties
back to the FBI provided safe house. Gerty and Jenny walked across the street
slowly, their minds on the future. Neither of them liked what they had heard
one bit and were terrified of what they were to find
the following morning. 

&nbsp;
