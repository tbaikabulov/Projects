LISA�S
REALITY

&nbsp;

Chapter one - Taken

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Oh god, not again!� Lisa struggled as she felt a hand cover her
mouth and was lifted off the ground by a firm arm around her waist.� She kicked her legs in the air, but soon realised
she was not going anywhere.� Suddenly,
she felt a sharp pain like a bite in her bottom and everything started to go
fuzzy.� Try as she might, she was unable
to stay alert and felt herself getting weaker until everything went dark.

&nbsp;

****

Lisa started to wake slowly, feeling
strange but not knowing why.� She had a
bit of a headache and she was thirsty.�
She went to move her arm out to grab the glass of water she always kept
beside her bed, but it wouldn�t move.�
She tried again, and this time she pulled harder, but found she still
couldn�t move her arm.� She tried to open
her eyes to see why her arm was stuck and found she couldn�t do that either.
Trying not to panic, she tested her other arm and found it wouldn�t move
either. The same thing with her legs, they were somehow held firmly to what felt
like a bed. Suddenly she remembered being grabbed and the sting in her
bottom.� Lisa started to panic and
struggle against her binds.�� 

&nbsp;

�Now, now, don�t fight so, my dear.� We don�t want you hurting yourself�.� Lisa heard the deep male voice and froze.�� She went to say something, but felt a finger
lightly touch her lips. �Shhh, I don�t want you to say anything, just listen,
ok.�� Lisa nodded and the finger was
removed from her lips.� She felt the bed
dip and realised that the man was now sitting on the bed beside her.� She held her breath as she felt a hand move
down her neck and rest on her left breast.�
With a shock, she realised that if she could feel his hand on her breast,
she must not have her shirt and bra on anymore.�
She let out her breath in a small sob as the hand moved to touch her
other breast. 

&nbsp;

Steve looked at the young girl that lay
tied to the bed. She was 17 and was in her final year of high school.� They had been watching her for a while, and
had grabbed her on her way to school that morning.� He knew that she was not yet fully recovered
from the shot she had been given and that this was the best time to begin to
mould the girl to the role she would eventually become � that of a slave.� That is what he did, he trained slaves and he
was very good.� It helped that the
company he worked for kept an eye on the young girls in the towns around the
state and were very good at spotting signs of submission.� Lisa had been earmarked over a year ago; it
was just a matter of when to collect her. As Steve ran his hands over the soft
breasts of the girl, he could feel her body shaking and her little sobs.� � Lisa, listen to me,� he heard the girl give
another sob, � today you left your old life behind.� You will never go back to your school or your
home� He knew it was harsh, but he had found out over time, that it was better
to be brutal at the start.� This message
would be repeated over and over until they knew it was true. 

&nbsp;

Lisa started to cry as she heard the words
the man was saying.� �What did he mean?
she thought. �I �.I� didn�t tttell
anyone.� she sobbed quietly.� She felt
the man�s hand move from her breast to cover her mouth. � I told you not to say
anything, Lisa.� Now I will have to gag
you.�� She tried to shake her head to get
his hand off her mouth, but he was too strong.�
She felt his hand move off her mouth down to her chin to pull her mouth
open.� She didn�t even have time to react
before she felt a hard round object being pushed into her mouth behind her
teeth.� It just sat there for a moment,
and then she felt her head being pulled up and the ball was pulled deeper into
her mouth.� Lisa struggled not to panic
and to keep breathing, but it was hard.�
When her head was placed back down she could feel straps bitting into
her cheeks.� She was so busy trying to
calm down her breathing; she didn�t hear the man speak.� It was not until he grabbed her face that she
realised he was talking to her again.� 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Steve watched the girl trying to breath
through the ball gag he had just placed in her mouth. It wasn�t a big one, but
the feel of a ball gag took some girls a while to get used to.� He told her to breath through her nose but
she didn�t appear to hear him. He grabbed her face firmly, and said again, � Lisa,
just try to breath through your nose, that�s it.�� He watched as she managed to slow down her
breathing. � I�m sorry I had to use the gag, but I did ask you not to
speak.�� He did wonder a bit about what
she had been trying to say, but figured that she was just trying to say she
wouldn�t say anything if he let her go.�
He let her face go and sat back watching her. She really was
beautiful.� Her breasts were moving up
and down with her ragged breaths and her long, dark hair was splayed out on the
pillow around her head.� He longed to
remove the blindfold and see her eyes, but knew it was best to do that
later.� She had a strong, athletic build
and he knew that she used to run for her school track team.� However, she had quit suddenly mid season,
and no-body knew why. � Now, where was I, oh yes, you will never see your
family again. You will be trained to be what you were born to be.� I know that you don�t understand what I am
saying, but you will in time.� For now, you
need to do what you are told.� As you
have already found out, I will not tolerate disobedience.�� Steve reached out and touched the ball gag in
her mouth as he said this. � However, if you behave and do as you are told, you
will find me firm but fair.� Now, I am
going to release you.� So long as you do
not fight me and try to get away, you can stretch and go to the bathroom if you
need to.�� 

&nbsp;

As soon as he mentioned the word bathroom,
Lisa realised she did need to go-- badly. She hoped that he would be quick and
that it wasn�t a trick. She didn�t know what was going on, she had been sure
that the same group of men that had brutally raped her earlier in the year had
grabbed her again, but now she wasn�t so sure.�
She hadn�t been hurt, at least not yet, not like last time. She felt his
hands move down her legs and tensed thinking that maybe he was just teasing,
but then she felt his hand on her ankle releasing whatever it was that had been
holding her there.� � Just lay still,
until I undo everything. If you fight me, I�ll have to retie you, but you won�t
like it much�, the man said. She just lay there, too scared to move, knowing
somehow that he would do as he said.�
Finally, she felt her limbs released, however he didn�t touch the
blindfold or gag.� It seemed like she lay
there for hours, but it was really only a minute or two. She fought the urge to
pull her legs together, wishing he would let her stand up.� Just when she thought he never would, she
felt his hand on her upper arm.� �Good
Lisa, very good, now just stand ..�
slowly, you will be stiff for a while.��
She was stiff and it was several minutes before she could stand up
straight. 

&nbsp;

As Steve helped the girl to stand, he could
feel her shaking, both with the pain of cramped muscles and with fear. He had
been here many times before, but there was something different about this one.
He wasn�t sure what it was, but he guessed he had plenty of time to find
out.� Once she was able to stand
straight, he led her into the bathroom and sat her down onto the toilet.� He knew many girls were embarrassed to go
with him in the room, but he also knew this was something they would have to
get used to.� He wondered how long Lisa
would be able to hold out. 

&nbsp;

Lisa was thinking the same thing.� She was desperate to go, but didn�t know if
she could go with him still holding onto her arms the way he was. She had not
gone to the toilet in front of anyone since she was a child, but if she didn�t
go soon she would burst.� Not knowing how
long he would be willing to wait, she started to pee.� It seemed like it lasted forever and she was
so embarrassed she dropped her head and cried behind the blindfold.� She felt him doing something behind her head
and breathed a sigh of relief when she felt the awful thing that was in her
mouth being removed. She took a deep breath and wondered if he would also take
off the blindfold.� She felt very
vulnerable, even more than when she had been tied to the bed.� She began to shake and to worry about what he
would do next.� Like the time she had
spent lying on the bed untied, the time seemed to crawl.� She had no idea how long she sat there, but
the longer she did the more she shook.

&nbsp;

Steve felt her take the deep breath as he
removed the ball gag.� He hovered behind
the blindfold, but decided to hold off for a bit longer. He knew the feeling of
helplessness that it produced and wanted her to feel it fully.� He felt her begin to shake as she sat and
knew that she was starting to think of what he would do next.� Finally he grabbed the top of her arms and
pulled her to stand in front of him. Despite his earlier plans, he reached out
behind her head and removed the blindfold.�
He saw her blink a few times trying to get used to the light and then
move her eyes to look at him.� What he
saw were a set of the most beautiful, big blue/green eyes he had seen in a long
time.� He could see her fear and her
pleading, and finally her tears.�� 

&nbsp;

Lisa felt the blindfold being removed after
he had finally let her stand up.� At
first the light blinded her but soon she was able to see his face. What she saw
was a man with a strong face, dark eyes and short, dark hair.� She tried to see what he was thinking but
only succeeded in making herself feel even more afraid.� She felt her eyes fill with tears yet again
and had to look away.� As she put her
head down, he lifted her head back up to look at him again.� �Lisa, look at me.� Now in time, you will always look down unless
directed to do otherwise, but for now I want to see your eyes.�� She found herself looking at him again, this
time with tears streaming down her face. It was strange, he hadn�t hurt her but
she knew that he had full control over her. It was not like before, where she
had been controlled by brute force but it was still control. 

�You have been very good since I removed
you from the bed, so you will rewarded by being allowed to have a shower and
then you can ask me three questions. Now, I will give you 15 minutes to
shower.� With that he was gone.� Lisa
looked around her and saw the shower and the door through which the bed was.� She had a brief thought of running out of the
door and finding a way out, but quickly put that thought out of her mind as she
knew he would not just let her get away that easily.� In fact, this could just be a test to see
what she would do.� Lisa took a deep
breath and made her way to the shower.�
Once she had let the warm water wash over her for a few minutes she
remembered what he had said about asking three questions.� She had so many to ask but what three would
help her to learn more about her situation.�
She was scared to ask him straight out if he was part of the gang that
had attacked her in case he confirmed her fears that he was.� She was no longer so sure as he was treating
her so different from how she had been treated. By the time he re-entered the
room, she had just turned off the water and was looking for a towel to dry her
self with. She jumped as she heard his voice.�


&nbsp;

� Here, is this what you are looking for�,
Steve asked, making her jump.� He handed
her a small towel, a hand towel really.�
She took it and sub-consciously began to dry herself.� He watched as she tried to cover herself,
then realising that the towel was too small just tried to do the job as fast as
she could.� He knew that she would feel
more naked trying to dry herself then she had before, even though she had been
naked all the time.�� When she was dry,
he reached out and led her by the elbow into the other room.� He sat her on the bed while he pulled a chair
up to sit in front of her.� He saw her
watching him as he moved across the room to get the chair and sit down.� Once he was settled, he asked her if she had
decided on her three questions.� She took
a deep breath and nodded her head. He noticed that she had not spoken since he
had removed the gag. At least she seems to respond well to a little training,
he thought.� � Ok then, here is your
chance, three questions.� I can�t promise
I can answer them fully, but I will tell you as much as I can.�� 

� 

&nbsp;

Chapter two - Questions

&nbsp;

Lisa sat on the bed, her heart pounding as
she thought about the questions she would ask and the ones she didn�t dare to
ask.� She lifted her head and looked at
him again, finding herself at first unable to look him in the eye.� She had watched him as he moved to get the
chair and saw that he had a good body, strong and fit.� She thought that if she had seen him in the
street, she would have thought he was a very handsome man.� However, here she just saw that he was strong
and could overpower her without a moments thought.� She realised he was waiting for her questions
and made herself focus on trying to make her voice calm. She had thought hard
about her first question, wanting it to be a good one. � Why am I here?� she
asked, in what she knew was not a clear voice, but a shaky one. 

&nbsp;

Steve heard her first question and was
pleased.� Often the girls wasted the first
question, by pleading or begging to be let go.�
He wondered how much to tell her, but thought he at least owed her a
decent answer; after all she had done almost everything he wanted so far.� He looked her in the eye and began to
talk.� � First, let me say that was a
good question, though I don�t know if you really want to know the answer�. At
that he saw her eyes widen with fear and then look down. �No, I want you to
look at me.� You are here because you are
to going to be trained to be a slave.��
He paused to look in her eyes, wondering if she believed him or
not.� He saw her start to shake a little
and her eyes again filled with tears.� He
reached out and saw her flinch as he wiped a tear from her cheek. �You are here
because the people I work for have been watching you for a while and thought
that you had a very submissive nature. I know that sounds scary, but I do
believe you will do very well. Already today you have shown that, apart from me
having to use the gag.� As I said
earlier, I do feel it is what you were born to be� He saw that she had tensed
when he mentioned that she had been watched.�
He wondered why this seemed to worry her more then the news that she
would be trained to be a slave.� 

&nbsp;

Lisa sat and listened as he told her.� She didn�t know if she believed him or not.
However, what he said about her being watched made her wonder yet again if this
was all connected to her rape. She was so confused by this point that she
almost stopped listening.� She managed to
pull herself together though, and continued to try to focus on what he was
saying.�� He saw him stand up and go to
the bathroom. He returned with a glass of water for her to drink. She tried to
take the glass, but without her noticing, her shake had returned and he ended
up holding the glass up for her to drink from. As she drank the water, she
wondered what she should ask next. She had had her questions planned but what
he had told her, had made her rethink what she wanted to ask.� She was grateful for the extra time that
drinking the water was giving her to form her next question. He removed the
glass and said,� �Ok, I�m ready for
question number two.� She looked up at him, knowing that there was no way she
could even hope to speak in a clear voice. �Why did they, the people who were
watching me, think I am submissive?�

&nbsp;

Steve listened with some amazement at the
question he was asked.� It was one that
he had never been asked before this early in a girl�s capture.� It was one they sometimes asked later but
never now. He looked at her and tried to read the look in her eyes.� She still showed fear but a certain anxiety
could be seen too, as if she expected much more from the answer then what he
thought he could give her.� He thought
for a moment and then said, � Well, what a question. I am not sure what I can
tell you, as I was not part of the team, but I will try to convey what they
normally look for.� 

&nbsp;

On hearing what he said about not being
part of the team, Lisa felt like a weight had been lifted from her
shoulders.� Even if the others were part
of her rape, at least she knew he wasn�t.�
Strangely, she wasn�t thinking about what he had said about slave
training. That would come in time.� 

&nbsp;

Steve had paused in his answer, as he saw
her let go a breath as if she had been waiting for what he would say.� He didn�t really understand but decided he
would pursue it later.� �They look for
certain signs such as how the girl responds to male figures, if they stand up
for themselves, sometimes it is as simple as where they look during certain
situations.� But they are trained in
seeing things that others would miss, and they claim they saw a lot of this in
you. Of course, all this is done from a distance so the real test only comes
now when we get to see you up close and personal�� 

&nbsp;

Lisa had listened to what he was saying,
and suddenly she knew for sure that what was happening to her had nothing to do
with her rape.� Almost overcome with
relief she found herself beginning to shake and cry.�� At first just a little bit but in a few
minutes she was crying so hard she couldn�t stop even if she tried. Steve
watched the girl, wondering what he had said that had caused such a reaction.
He wondered was it a delayed reaction to what he had told her earlier, but he
somehow didn�t think so.� He watched as
the girl sobbed for at least a good 10 minutes.�
Finally he went into the bathroom and wet the towel she had previously
used to dry herself.� He went to the
still crying girl and sat her up again, as she had ended up curled up on the
bed, and used the cloth to wipe her face.�


&nbsp;

Lisa felt the cool cloth on her face and at
first didn�t know what was happening.�
She tried to calm herself and focus on her breathing.� The cloth helped, and soon she was able to
almost stop her sobs and open her eyes.�
She looked up to see dark eyes looking at her, with a mixture of concern
and amusement in them.� � Well, that was
not quite what I expected.� Are you ok
now?�� Lisa wasn�t sure how to answer
him, on one hand she was so relieved that he and whatever group he was a part of
had no part of her rape and yet what was happening to her was starting to sink
in.� 

She knew she had to say something, but
didn�t think she could so she just nodded. 

&nbsp;

Steve watched her as she struggled to
regain some kind of composure.� He saw
her go from a look of relief to one of concern again.� Maybe not as much as before, but he could see
that she was now showing some of the signs he had expected to see earlier when
he told her she was going to be a trained as a slave.� He wondered what had been going on in her
head before.� � Slave!� he said, knowing
that would get her focused on him.� Lisa
heard what he said and felt a jolt go through her when she realised what he had
actually said.� She looked up at him with
a shocked look on her face.� �Tell me, what
just happened?�� What could she tell him?
� I �I� oh god, I� she stopped and looked
at him, hoping that he would not make her tell him, but one look told her that
he expected an answer.� Steve watched her
as she stammered out her answer and give him a pleading look that he knew meant
she wanted him to let her not answer him. He wasn�t going to let her not
answer, not only because she needed to start to get used to the fact they would
be no secrets from now on but also because he really was curious to know what
had caused such a reaction.� 

&nbsp;

Lisa knew she was not going to get out of
telling him, but it was hard. She hadn�t told anyone about her rape and here
she was expected to tell a complete stranger who now called her his slave. She
tried again to tell him but found herself again stammering.� By now he was starting to get annoyed and
grabbed her hair in his fist, bringing her around to face him again.� �Slave, you really don�t want to make me
angry, tell me now!� Lisa felt him pull her hair back even further and give her
head a fierce shake.� She was panting now
and knew there was no out. �Ok, ok, please let go and I will tell you,
please.�� Lisa felt the grip lesson but
the hand did not leave her hair.� At
least he was not pulling her head back anymore.�
He was however looking at her and waiting for an answer.� �About eight months ago I was going to study
at the library when I was grabbed and pulled into a van.� I was raped by at least four men. I don�t
know how long I was in the van for but finally they let me go, dropping me
right near my house.� They told me that
if I told anyone, they would come back and next time I wouldn�t be going
home.� So when I got picked this morning,
I thought it was by the same men.�� As
Steve listened to what she was telling him, he let go of her hair but kept his
hand on the back of her neck.� He was
starting to understand her responses.� �
So you have been trying to figure out if I was involved?� he asked.� She just nodded, not able to look at him,
feeling embarrassed by what she had told him. � I thought ..that maybe ..this
was related but as I hadn�t told anyone, I didn�t know�.� She paused and felt his hand on the back of
her neck, not hurting her just resting there.�
She didn�t know what else to say, so she just waited for him to
speak.� 

&nbsp;

Steve sensed her uncertainty about what to
say now.� He was trying to digest what
she had told him, not only in terms of what he felt about it but also about how
it could affect her future slave training.�
They usually choose girls that were virgins or had very little
experience, as they proved to be easier to train. He brought his mind back to
the current situation. Some things began to make sense to him. �So that is why
you quit the track team! The guys were wondering why.�� � I just couldn�t do it anymore, thinking
that maybe they were watching me.�� Lisa
bit her lip and tried not to cry yet again.�
Until today, she had thought she was all cried out, but today she just
couldn�t seem to stem the flow of tears.�
Steve suddenly thought back to the two questions she had asked and began
to understand why she had asked such unusual ones.� � Your questions, they were very clever, you
know.� What would you have done if I
hadn�t answered the way I did?� Did you
have a third question to help you find out more?� 

&nbsp;

Lisa heard his question and was glad he
wasn�t asking her for any more details about the rape.� She was not sure how much she would be able
to tell him at the moment.� She nodded
and said � I was too scared to ask outright, thinking that maybe it was all a
trap or something.� But I just had to
know, so I thought � hold on, if I tell you, is this considered my third
question?�� She was surprised to hear a
deep laugh. � No I guess this doesn�t count, you can still have your third
question later� �Ok, well I would have asked something like what had I done to
be here or something. But I was so relieved when you said what you did that I
just couldn�t keep it in anymore.�� 

&nbsp;

Steve moved to sit on the edge of the bed
and pulled her towards him in an embrace.�
He felt her tense up but he held firm and she soon relaxed a bit more in
his arms.� Lisa felt his strong arms
around her, and felt her fear return.�
She tensed, waiting for him to do something, but when he didn�t she let
herself be held and felt her tears come again for what felt like the hundredth
time today.� Steve held his new little
slave as she cried in his arms.� This
certainly is an unusual start to training, he thought, but it is important that
she try to let this go before they start on the training.� As he held her, he began to run his hands up
and down her back.� First it was just for
comfort but then he started to get turned on by having a beautiful, young girl
in his arms.� He felt his cock jerk and
start to respond.� He had moved his hand
down to rub against the side of her breast when he felt her tense up in his
arms. He knew that now was not the time, so he moved her back so he could look
at her.� She was looking up uncertainly
at him.� �So, do you have your third
question to ask?�� Lisa felt relief that
he had stopped what he was doing, but knew that the time would come when he
wouldn�t stop.� She tried to refocus her
mind to concentrate on the final question, not knowing when she might get a
chance to ask another one.� � You said
you were going to train me, what does that mean?� Steve looked at her and
decided that before he answered that question they both needed something to
eat. � I will answer your question, but I think we both need some food, don�t
you think� Lisa realised that she was in fact very hungry.� Not only had she not eaten since breakfast,
the emotion of the day was also taking it�s toll. � Yes, I am hungry�. Steve
moved to corner of the room and used his phone to call the kitchen to send down
some sandwiches and drinks.� As he moved
back to the bed, he saw her looking at him.�
�That won�t take long, now I think we need to sort a few things
out.� From now on when you speak to me
you will call me master.� You will also
only speak when you have permission or you are answering me.�� Do you understand slave?�� Lisa looked up and said � yes�. Steve grabbed
her by the hair,� Yes what slave?� Lisa winced saying �Master, yes Master, I�m
sorry master�.� Steve smiled at her and
said � that�s better� Just then there was a knock on the door and Steve let go
of Lisa�s hair, much to her relief.� 

&nbsp;

Steve went to the door and returned with a
trolley on which there were sandwiches, water and juice.� Lisa just sat, not knowing what to
think.� She didn�t feel in any direct
danger but there was a sense of the unknown that unsettled her. Her new Master,
as she had to now call him, was a mystery to her.� He had been comforting when she needed a
shoulder but he also had an edge to him that scared her.� She knew that he would expect total obedience
and she hoped she could do all that he wanted her to.� Lisa reached out to take a sandwich and
yelped in pain as her new master slapped her across the hand � oh no, my dear,
slaves have to wait to be given permission to eat� he said, with a satisfied
grin across his face. Lisa was just about to say that he could have told her
before he hit her, when she remembered the rule about talking and shut her
mouth.� Steve saw this and said, � Well
done slave, I thought I might have had to use the gag again and then you would
have really been waiting a while to eat�.�
Lisa looked up him and then at the food.�
She hoped he would not keep her waiting too long as just the smell of
the food was making her tummy rumble.�
Steve knew she had to be starving, but it was a good test to see if she
could hold out.� After five minutes,
which felt like fifty to Lisa, he allowed her to eat and have one of the
drinks.� Lisa wasn�t sure if saying thank
you would be considered talking or not, but decided to risk it. � Thank you master�
she said in a soft voice.� She held her
breath waiting to see if she had made the right choice.� Steve could see that she was waiting for him
to comment, � You are welcome slave, by the way, you made the right decision to
say thank you. I would have stopped you eating if you had not done so.� You must always thank your master or mistress
when they allow you to do something.� Do
you understand?� Yes master�. � Good, I can see that you are a quick learner,
that will help you in your training. Speaking of training, I will answer your
question shortly.� As soon as you have
finished eating and I have you ready for bed.��
Lisa looked at him questioningly but did not ask what he meant by ready
for bed. She hoped it did not mean what she thought it might mean.� Steve saw her thinking about what he had
said, and knew that she must be wondering if it meant he was going to want to
sleep with her tonight.� He knew he could
have eased her mind but liked keeping her a bit on the edge.� 

&nbsp;

After another trip to the bathroom, Lisa
found herself once more sitting on the bed.�
She started to worry about what he had said earlier about getting her
ready for bed.� Steve moved towards her
with something behind his back. Lisa wondered what it was as he looked down at
her. � You really are beautiful my dear, I am looking forward to getting to
know you much better� Lisa tensed up as he said this, but he continued � No my
dear, relax, nothing will happen tonight, though I am sorely tempted,� Lisa
looked up at him, biting her lip. Steve had seen her do this before and knew
that meant she was feeling nervous.� He
reached down to touch her check before sitting in the chair near the bed.� Lisa sat and waited while he settled himself
in the chair and put what he had behind his back in his lap. She gasped when
she saw what it was but managed to not say anything.� Steve watched her reaction to the collection
of ropes and leather cuffs he had in his lap. Lisa tried to work out what they
were all for. Even though she had been bound when she first woke up she had not
been able to see what had held her to the bed because of the blindfold.� She was starting to understand that by
getting her ready for bed he meant to bind her again. She jumped when she heard
him speak; she had been so intent on trying to work out what every thing might
be for.� � So have you figured it out
yet?� He looked at her so she knew that she was expected to speak. � I think
that you will get me ready for bed by restraining me to the bed again, is that
right Master?� � Oh yes, my young slave, but don�t worry, we will start simple
for now. I need you to put your arms out in front of you, yes that�s it, now
lie back and put your arms up to touch the top of the bed, good girl. Now for
the legs.�� By the time he was done, Lisa
had her arms attached to the top of the bed with the cuffs around each wrist
and her legs tied to the opposite ends of the bed, so her legs were spread
wide.� She felt very conscious of how
this allowed her pussy to be on display, but suddenly remembered that it had on
display the same way when she first woke. Still she wished he had let her have
her legs closed.� Steve stood back and
looked at Lisa as she lay there, he had not tied her very tightly, knowing that
as the weeks and months went by, she would be forced into more extremes
bondage. This was just enough to allow her to feel the binds with out them
really hurting her.� The worst she would
feel in the morning was stiff.� However
she did look beautiful and he had to work hard to not fuck her then and there.� He sat down in the chair and decided it was
time to answer her question about what her training would entail. He had
stalled a bit, trying to consider how much to tell her know so he would not
freak her out too much.� 

&nbsp;

Lisa tested the cuffs around her arms and
ankles and decided that though she would not be able to get out, they wouldn�t
hurt her either.� She was grateful for
that, as she didn�t think she could have handled anything too tight tonight.� As she was thinking about this she was aware
that her master was looking at her. Looking up, she saw a strange look in his
eyes that passed at he sat down.� The
look had made her feel funny inside and she was glad that it passed quickly.� He began to talk and she knew that he was
finally going to answer her question. There was a part of her that really
needed to know but another part was starting to feel scared of what he was
going to say. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

� Well, now that you are all settled in
your bed, I guess it is story time, or in this case answer time.� Ok. I have been considering how much to tell
you, so that you can be a bit prepared but there will still be some surprises
along the way.� There will be several
stages to the training and you will expect to do your best in each stage. First
we will continue with the rules that we already began today.� This early stage will also start to introduce
you to some simple bondage play.� Later
on this will become more intensive, but I will let you find out about that when
the time comes� Lisa was listening to all he was telling her, but did not
really understand everything. She knew that bondage meant being tied up, but
had no idea what he meant by bondage play.�
She just hoped it was something she could handle.� Steve was watching her face as he told her
about the first part of her training and could see her trying to understand
what he was saying.� He was impressed
again with how intelligent she appeared to be and made a mental note to check
on her school marks. �Do you understand some of what I am saying?� he asked.
�Some master, I don�t really know what you mean by bondage play, but I guess I
will find out. I am just worried that I won�t be able to do all that you ask of
me and, � and� � and what dear girl� �
and you will have to punish me master�. Steve found himself marvelling yet
again at the beautiful creature before him.�
Often by now, the girl had either given him a headache with her pleas
and yelling or had given up. He found Lisa to be the most interesting girl he
had been asked to train in a long time. Though obviously scared she was trying
her best not to upset him. � Now, how about you leave that up to me.� I can�t promise that I won�t have to punish
you, but if I can see that you are really doing the best you can, then it won�t
be as bad as if you were not trying at all, ok� Lisa nodded her head and then
quickly replied with the yes Master that she knew he expected.� Steve saw her give him a quick look of
concern to see if her little slip up would cause her to be punished.� He decided to leave it go as she had so
quickly corrected her mistake.� When he
began to speak again, he heard Lisa sigh softly.� � Of course, there is another aspect to your
training that we haven�t covered yet.�
You will be expected to learn how to satisfy a man and in time a women.�
He looked to see what her reaction to this was and saw that she had closed her
eyes and turned her head away from him, He reached out to turn her face back to
him and asked her to open her eyes and look at him, Lisa opened her eyes as she
was asked, but found herself unable to look him in the eyes.� Lisa felt a sharp slap on her inner thigh of
her left leg as he again asked her to look at him, not wanting him to slap her
again; she made herself look directly at him.�
�Lisa, you have to learn that you do not have the option of doing what
you want anymore. I know that what I said will be hard for you considering what
you have suffered but it will be a big part of your training and you will have
to face up to it. I will try to go a bit slower than I usually do, but I still
will have to push you harder then you would like.� Do you understand this? 


�Lisa looked at the man who was now her
master and said in a whisper� yes master, I understand and I will try my best,
but please be patient with me.�� The only
experience I have with sex is not one I want to have again.� I still have nightmares about what they did
to me and I don�t know how I will react, but I will try, just please don�t hurt
me like they did� by now she was close to tears again.� Steve again moved to sit on the edge of the
bed and moved his hand to lightly caress her breasts.� Lisa felt him move and the gentle movement of
his hands on her breast, so different to the brutal hands that had hurt her so.� She was deep in thought when she felt the
hands leave her breasts and move down to her pussy. She gasped in surprise when
she felt him slide his finger up and down her slit.� She tried not to panic, but found her breath
getting short and it was all she could do not to scream and beg him not to
touch her. Steve saw how she reacting. In a quiet voice he said� shh, I won�t
hurt you.� I know it will be hard but if
we take it slow, you will be ok, now just take deep breathes, that�s it, I am
just going to keep rubbing lightly down here until you relax a bit more, there,
that is better. � He continued to talk to her as he rubbed her soft lips.�� Slowly he felt her start to get wet and
gently moved to slide his finger inside her. This of course, set her off again
but eventually she had calmed down enough to be able to slide his finger in and
out while he began to massage her clit with his other hand.� Lisa felt what he was doing and alternated
between almost blind panic and a feeling of pure bliss.� She knew he was not hurting her but the
sensations he was causing were making her remember the rape. Each time she
tried to let herself enjoy the feelings he was creating she would have a
flashback of something related to her rape � the feeling of a large cock in her
throat choking her, the pain of having her hymen broken with a brutal lunge,
the burning pain of having a cock forced up her bottom and the humiliation of
having more then one man�s cock in her body at the same time.�� She tried so hard to just focus on what was
happening to her now, but her mind would not let her.� She was so frustrated she started to think
that she would never be able to forget when she felt something she had never
felt before. A pressure was starting to build up and as it was sometime that
she had not experienced during her rape, she found she was able to concentrate
on it more and more until finally she felt her body explode and she felt a
peace she had not felt for a long time.�
Steve felt her relax more and more as he stimulated her and when she
finally came he was pleased to see her let go and not fight it. 

&nbsp;

�He
reached up and moved her head so he could look into her eyes.� Her breathing was still ragged and she had
not yet recovered fully, but he waited, wanting to see her eyes when she first
opened them.� He was not disappointed, as
instead of the fear and worry he had seen all day, he now saw her at
peace.� After a few more minutes he asked
her how she was feeling. �Master, what was that?� He realised that this must be
the first time she experienced an orgasm and gently said, �that my dear girl
was an orgasm and I would dare say your first? �Yes master, I have never felt
anything like it.�� I was scared of what
you were doing at first, not because you were hurting me but because it made me
think of what had been done to me and as much as I tried to only focus on what
you were doing, I kept going back in my mind to that awful day. � � What made
you relax?� � I think it was because the feeling of the orgasm building was so
new, that I was able to focus on it. The only feeling I had before was pain and
because you were able let me have a new feeling, I was able to let it happen.
Thank you master, thank you so much� 

&nbsp;

Steve let of her face and reached down to
kiss her gently on the lips. A big hurdle had been overcome in his mind,
knowing that she could allow herself to cum meant that he could work on that
until she was able to go further. He knew he would have to get her to tell him
more details of her rape, just so he could help her overcome her fears.� He leant down to say goodnight, but she was already
asleep.

&nbsp;

Chapter three � The Nightmare

&nbsp;

Lisa tried to breathe around the thick cock
that was being held down her throat.� It
seemed like it had been there for ages, and she was started to feel light
headed.� She grunted as she felt the
other cock that was raping her continue to pound into her pussy.� She struggled against her binds and heard
someone screaming.� She wondered if there
was someone else in the van.� She could
hear a voice calling her name and felt hands on her.� She didn�t know what was going on.� Why could she now feel a bed under her
back?�� She could hear the voice calling
her name get louder and felt her arms and legs being released.� As she struggled she felt her body being
lifted of the bed and a pair of strong arms pulling her into a hard chest.� 

&nbsp;

�Lisa, wake up, wake up�, Steve said as he
tried to calm the still struggling girl.�
He has been woken by her screams and could not believe the sight he saw
as he ran into her room. Lisa was screaming out and struggling so hard against
her bonds that he was afraid that she would dislocate something.� She continued to fight him as he quickly
moved to undo the cuffs holding her to the bed and move her into his arms.� �Wake up, Lisa�.� Lisa slowly began to wake, trying hard to
work out where she was.� She heard the
voice calling her to wake up again and opened her eyes to see a set of dark
eyes staring at her.� Still not knowing
where she was she opened her mouth to scream, when she felt a hand cover her
mouth. 

&nbsp;

Steve had seen that she was about to scream
again and reached out his hand to cover her mouth.� He could feel her ragged breathe and knew
that she was not yet fully awake. ��
Lisa, shh, it was only a dream.�
Come on, wake up�.� Lisa�s mind
searched to remember where she was and suddenly it all came back to her.� She was being held by this man, her master,
and was going to be trained as a slave.�
She remembered everything that had happened yesterday, feeling herself
blush when she thought about what had happened before she went to sleep last
night.� She became aware of the hand
covering her mouth and opened her eyes fully to look up the man holding
her.� 

&nbsp;

Steve, seeing that she was now calm and
looking at her with clear eyes, removed his hand from her mouth.� �Lisa, are you ok now?�� Lisa looked at him and was able to squeak out
an, � I think so�. She felt that had said something wrong, but couldn�t think
what it was. Just as she felt a hand on the back of her neck, she remembered
what had missed and quickly added, � master, sorry master�.� The hand on her neck was removed and she
relaxed.� �Well slave, I was planning an
exciting start to our day, but I can see you beat me to it.�� Lisa looked at him and saw a slight smile on
his face. She, however, could also see the remains of something else in his
eyes. Concern maybe, or worry?� �Slave,
you need a shower, off you go� 

&nbsp;

As Lisa moved into the shower room, Steve
sat down on the bed and thought about what had happened.� He was certain that her nightmare had much
more to do with her rape then her current situation, but he was worried about
how severe it had been.� He was sure that
if he hadn�t released her from her bonds when he did, she would have caused
some serious injury to herself.� He was
also worried about what his bosses would say when they found out about her past
and the nightmares.� He knew what
happened to girls who were unable to be trained and even though he hardly knew
Lisa, he knew that he didn�t want her to suffer the same fate.� However if he were going to train her to the
standard required, he would have to stop her nightmares. 

&nbsp;

As Steve was pondering her fate, Lisa made
her way on unsteady legs into the shower.�
She sat down on the toilet and thought about what had happened.� She was not able to remember the dream
exactly but knew that she had again relived part of the rape.� However, she remembered pulling on her cuffs
and looking down at her wrists, she could see red marks where she had obviously
pulled hard to try to get out.� She
wondered if she would ever be able to forget.�
She stood up and made her way into the shower. She was grateful that she
had been allowed to have this time to herself. She always found it hard to talk
to anyone for a while after she had one her nightmares. At home, she had been
able to just stay in her room until she was feeling better. Her parents had
known she was having some bad dreams, but did not know why. 

&nbsp;

The warm water felt wonderful on her body
and she found her head clearing even more.�
She thought about the man in other room. She did not know what to think
about him.� In the short time she had
been under his control she had been treated in a not unkind way, but she also
knew already that was in charge.� However,
she also thought that about the way he had helped her to recover from the dream
and of course the orgasm he had given her last night.�� She did not have any experience with sex,
apart from her rape.� She knew that her
friends had thought it a bit strange, but she really had not found anyone that
she liked enough to want to go out with, plus her parents had been quite old
fashioned.� She thought that even if she
hadn�t been told not to say anything about her rape, she would not have told
anyone anyway. She had been worried about getting pregnant, but when her next
period came she knew that at least that was one thing she could stop worrying
about.� She didn�t know how long she had
been in the shower, but didn�t want to push her luck and stay too long. She
moved out of the shower and looked around for something to dry herself with, finally
seeing the same washcloth she had used yesterday on the bench.� She was amazed that with all that had
happened that she was not more worried about being naked. She made her way into
the room to see the man whom she now called master sitting deep in thought on
the bed.� Not knowing what to do, she
just stood in the doorway, waiting. 

&nbsp;

Steve became aware of Lisa standing in the
doorway, obviously not knowing what to do. She looked better than she had
before the shower, with the colour back in her cheek.� He could see the redness on her wrists and
ankles where she had fought against her cuffs. �Slave, come and knell on the
floor, knees spread and hands behind your head.�� Lisa moved to do what he said without really
thinking.�� She wondered again why she
was doing what he said, but found herself kneeling as he asked.� She didn�t know where to look so looked down
at the ground. �Well done, slave, you just need to straighten your back a bit
more�. Lisa did as she was told and waited to see what would happen now.� She was just starting to feel a bit nervous
when he reached out and touched her cheek.�
He moved her head up to look at him. � That is what you will do when you
enter a room that I am in or I enter the room. Of course, there will be times
that you may be hindered in your ability to do this, but when you are not bound
or told otherwise, this is what you will do. Do you understand this,
slave?�� � Yes Master, I understand� 

&nbsp;

��Good, now show me your wrists.�� Lisa brought her hands around from behind her
head and held her hands out in front of her.�
Steve examined each wrist and was pleased to see that already a lot of
the redness was fading.� � Stand up and
let me check your ankles too?�� As she
stood, she became aware of the position they were in, with her standing and him
sitting, he had a perfect view of her pussy.�
Steve was very aware of the position his slave would be in once she was
standing.� He watched as she rose from
her knees to stand before him. � Usually when you stand, you will spread your
legs, but now I want you to put your foot on my knee.�� Lisa felt even more vulnerable putting her
foot up onto his knee, but once again did as he asked.� Steve checked both of her ankles, noting yet
again that no major damage had been done.�
He was not unaware of her discomfort in presenting herself to him but
was again pleased with the way she was responding to his commands.� He briefly considered letting his hand wonder
a bit, but knew that he had other things that had to be done.

�Good, everything seems to be ok.� Come and have something to eat, then you can
tell me what happened.�� 

&nbsp;

Lisa moved over to the table and was about
to sit, when she realised that he had not told her to.� She paused, wondering again at how quickly he
had influenced her actions. Steve saw her move to sit and than stand, looking a
bit nervous about her choice. � You can sit down but do not start to eat
anything� � yes master� Lisa sat down and looked at the food on the table.� Although she was not as hungry as she had
been last night, she was still feeling quite hungry.� He moved and sat at the table opposite her,
pouring out a cup of tea for both of them and placing a piece of toast on a
plate in front of her.� � You may eat
now.� Lisa and her master ate in silence.�
Once she was finished, he sat back in the chair, crossed one leg on top
of the other and asked her the question she had been waiting for. � So, what
happened this morning?� 

&nbsp;

Lisa took a last sip of her tea and braced
herself to answer his question.� � I had
a bad dream, that is all�, she said, hoping he would leave it at that. Steve
leaned forward in the chair and looked directly into her eyes �Slave, you know
that I expect you to obey what I say, don�t you�. �Yes master�. �So don�t mess
with me! I know it was not just a bad dream.��
Lisa was alarmed at the menace in his voice and knew that she had to
tell him everything, no matter how embarrassing it was. �Sorry Master, it is
just that I have never told anyone about my dreams, I didn�t mean to disobey
you.�� 

&nbsp;

Steve watched as she took a deep breath and
proceeded to tell him the details of her dream that she could remember.� Although it was only a small part of her
actual rape, it was enough for him to realise that what she had suffered was
not something she would get over in hurry. He may be a slave trainer, but he
had always preferred to use a more subtle form of control then just brute
force.� He knew he could control a girl
just like that men that raped Lisa had done, but he also knew that to make a
girl into a slave you had to control their mind not just their body. � How
often do you have nightmares like this?�
Can I expect to be woken up each morning in the same way?� 

&nbsp;

Lisa considered the question.� At first, after the rape, she was having the
dreams each night but over the last few months they had become less frequent.
�I am not sure Master.� I have not had a
nightmare like the one I had this morning for a while. I used to get them every
night but over the last few months they were coming only once a week or so.� I am sorry I woke you Master, but I don�t
know if I can say it won�t happen again. Please don�t be upset with me.�� Lisa waited for his reply but was surprised
when he stood up to stand in front of her.�
She started to panic, thinking that she was in trouble. When she felt
his hands lifting her to her feet, she started to shake.� 

&nbsp;

Steve felt her shake as he stood her up
before him. �Slave, look at me.� I am not
upset with you.� I understand why you
would have nightmares after what happened to you. What does concern me is how
it will affect your training.� Lisa tried to comprehend the fact that he wasn�t
angry but was worried about her training.�
� I know you don�t know what I mean but believe me it is very important
that you complete your training� Lisa could sense the importance of what he was
saying and felt the tension in his body.�
What she didn�t know is was he worried about her or just about getting
another slave trained.� For some reason
this made her angry and twisted herself to lessen the grip he had on her
arms.� 

&nbsp;

Steve felt her try to twist away and held
on even tighter. He was not sure why, but she was suddenly showing some
anger.� He knew he needed to control this
now. He reached up and grabbed her hair, pulling her head back with a sharp
tug. Lisa grunted with the pain of him pulling back her hair and felt tears in
the corner of her eyes. �What are you doing?��
Lisa tried to answer but didn�t know what to say.� She felt him move his hand away from her
other arm to grip her face. �I said what are you doing?�� Lisa was now feeling real fear for the first
time since she had been with him. � I..I..nothing master, I just felt like
..� please don�t hurt me. I�ll be good,
please.� By now she was sobbing, still not knowing what he would do.� 

&nbsp;

Steve slowly let go of her hair and pulled
her face down to look at him.� �Slave, I
don�t want to have to hurt you but you can�t try to pull away from me like you
did.� Now what made you act like
that?� Lisa looked at him and saw that
some of his anger had passed, though he still did not look happy.� �When you said that you were worried about my
nightmares affecting my training, it made me angry for a moment thinking that
getting my training done was more important than me.� I�m sorry, master.� I don�t know why I felt that way. Please
forgive me!� 

&nbsp;

Steve saw her close her eyes, waiting to
see what his reaction would be.� He
reached out and put a hand on her hair again, but this time he just collected
her hair with pulling it.� Lisa opened
her eyes as he did this, looking at him with apprehension, obviously waiting
for him to hurt her again.� �Listen to
me. I am worried about your training but I am also worried about you. I usually
don�t tell a trainee this but there is a time frame in which I have to work,
and if you are not trained to a certain standard by that time then..�� He paused as he watched the emotions play on
her face.� They had gone from pleading to
worry and now she was showing signs of fear again.� He moved her to sit down beside her on the
bed.� �then what happens will make your
rape seem like a picnic� 

&nbsp;

Lisa heard what he said and wondered why he
was being so cruel.� She didn�t even want
to think about what could be worse than what had been done to her.� She looked up to see if she could tell if he
was serious and one look at his face told her he was. 

&nbsp;

� I�m sorry to make it sound so blunt, but
I thought it fair that you know what is at stake.� If we have known about your rape, we would
have reconsidered whether you were suitable for training.� Now there is no turning back.�� Steve wondered if he had pushed her too far,
he had never faced this situation before.�
Sure, he had had girls that were harder to train, but none that had the
added problems that Lisa had.� Yet he was
not ready to give up on her and he hoped she wasn�t ready to give up either.

&nbsp;

Lisa felt like she had been punched in the
stomach.� She tried to focus on what he
had said but it was all just a confused jumble.�
If they had known about the rape maybe she wouldn�t be here but if she
had told someone she could have ended up back with her rapists again.� She couldn�t get over how unfair it all
was.� All she wanted was a normal life
and look where she was now.� 

&nbsp;

Steve looked on as she struggled to come to
terms with what he had told her. He wanted to know what she was thinking but
knew that he had to leave her sort things out for a while.� He moved away from the bed and sat on the
chair nearby.� She had lain down on the
bed and was curled up like a little girl.�
He didn�t think she was crying but as he couldn�t see her face he wasn�t
sure.� 

&nbsp;

Lisa didn�t even notice him moving from the
bed or the fact that she had moved to lie down on the bed.� She felt empty, like she was nothing.� She couldn�t even cry. She didn�t know how
long she just lay there before she felt a hand on her shoulder rolling her over
until she lay on her back.� �Slave, look
at me�, she heard the voice but couldn�t make herself open her eyes.� � Lisa� she heard her name and something
clicked inside her head.� She opened her
eyes and saw those dark eyes again looking at her. 

&nbsp;

Steve had left her for alone for as long as
he could, but was starting to get worried. He was now looking into her eyes but
all he could see was a blank stare. �Lisa� he tried again and this time he saw
a small spark of life enter into those beautiful eyes again.� He helped her to sit up and gave her a drink
of water.� Lisa let her self be sat up
and drank the water he offered her. She still wasn�t really with it yet, but
she could feel some sense of life coming back to her. She looked up at the man
and wondered what would happen now. 

&nbsp;

Steve was relieved to see that she seems to
be coming around.� �How do you feel?�
Lisa heard the question and thought, how do I feel. �I�m not sure.� I have never felt like that before, like I
was nothing.�� Steve noted that she had
not addressed him as she should have, but knew that this was not the time to
stress that point. � And now, what are you feeling now�.� � I want to,� Lisa was not even sure what she
was going to say until it came out, � I want to survive this.� I don�t really know what I will have to do
but I can�t bear the thought of being treated worse then how I have already
been treated.�� 

&nbsp;

Chapter Four � A New Surprise

&nbsp;

Steve felt the tension leave him as he
heard her speak, he had been so sure that he had lost her before he even
started.� Now he knew what he had to
do.� �Okay, slave, now that we have
sorted, we need to get you some help.��
Lisa looked at him and wondered what he meant, but she remembered that
since he hadn�t asked her a question or said she could speak, she wasn�t able
to ask him. � I know just the right person who can help you.� I just hope she can be allowed the time to
come here.�� Steve went off to the other
side of the room and used his mobile phone to make a call. Lisa could not
really hear what he was saying, but he seemed to be pleased with the call.� � Right, that is all set.� Your first session wit the doctor will be
this afternoon.� Lisa again wondered what this all meant for her.� Surely he wouldn�t let her leave here and go
see a doctor, but if he did maybe she could get away some how.� At least she would have to be given something
to wear. 

&nbsp;

While Lisa was pondering all this, Steve
was thinking about what he had to do to get ready for this afternoon.� He had called John, a man who was master to a
slave that had gone through her training here, but not with him. She was a
rather unusual case; she was already a trained doctor, a psychiatrist, who
happened to stumble across the group he worked for.� She was older than the girls who were
normally chosen to be trained but because of her beauty and her brains, it was
decided that they would at least see how she reacted to training rather then
just kill her.� So at the age of 25, Dr
Caitlin Jones had found herself in training to be a slave.� She did prove to be a challenge but
eventually made the grade and was bought by John not long after.� Steve had only seen her once, at a party over
a year ago, but he could still remember how beautiful she looked crawling along
after her master wearing nothing but the gold collar around her neck. He had
attached a chain to the collar and made her go around the room at least ten
times showing her off.� Her long blond
hair he had pulled back into a ponytail so everyone could see her beautiful
face. What you could also see where the signs of recent and past floggings on
her back and bottom. It was obvious that her master was fond of the whip.� 

&nbsp;

John had agreed to let her keep up her
work, but of course not as freely as before.�
He set up a room in his house and it was mostly other slaves or people
who were part of the community that they helped find slaves for, the used the
service.� Luckily John had agreed to let
her come and stay for the six weeks that he had to train Lisa, in fact he said
that he was going to call the centre and ask if she could be sent in for some
further training. He felt that she was not responding as he thought she should
in certain situations. So he agreed that in return for her services he would
assist in her retraining.� He knew that
he would need some help, but knew just the man. He would talk to him later, but
was sure that it would not be a problem as he knew that the girl the he had
been meant to be training had been involved in a car accident the night before
she was meant to be taken, so he was free for a few weeks at least. 

&nbsp;

He looked over at Lisa to see what she was
doing, when he saw that she had fallen asleep. He was not surprised, as the
morning had been a stressful one. He decided to let her sleep and organise his
extra helper. 

&nbsp;

Steve met up with Justin in the staff
common room.� He was lucky, as due to not
having a training assignment, Justin had been thinking of heading off for a few
weeks. When Steve told him about his time with Lisa, Justin was
fascinated.� He had never worked on this
type of case before but was keen to help.�
When Steve then told him about Caitlin coming along to stay and help
out, he was in.� Justin had also been at
the same party, and the image of the beautiful slave was very clear in his
head.�� Steve at last felt that he had
more than a good chance of getting Lisa through her training now that he had
some much needed assistance.� It would be
a very interesting six weeks.



&nbsp;



&nbsp;

Back in her room, Lisa was stirring after
having slept for well over two hours. She sat up and looked around, taking a
moment to remember where she was. At least she had not had any dreams, but she
still felt drained from her morning.� She
stood up, looking to see if she was alone or not.� Seeing that she was alone, she went over to
the door, and was not surprised to find it locked.� She noticed that there was some toast still
left on the table and was about to have some, when she was suddenly struck by
the fear that she could get in trouble eating with out permission. She wondered
yet again at how much her life had changed.�
She put the toast down and decided that she would be better to freshen
up a bit while she had the chance. She hadn�t been told she couldn�t so she
assumed it would be ok.� She took the
time to have a shower and felt much better afterwards.� She was just coming out of the bathroom, when
her Master walked in with another man behind him.� Lisa froze and then quickly dropped to her
knees as she had been instructed to do.� 

&nbsp;

Steve saw the surprise on Lisa�s face when
he walked in with Justin behind him.�� He
was pleased that she was up and even more pleased when she fell to her knees
and assumed the pose he had taught her. He had wondered if he would have to
begin the little training they had done again, but that did not seem
necessary.� �Well done slave, I am
pleased that you have remembered how to present yourself.�� He touched her on the head as he said this,
noticing that her hair was damp. �Have you had a shower while I was gone?�� Lisa swallowed and answered, not knowing if
he would be angry or not, � Yes Master, I hope that is ok, I just wanted to
clean and fresh when we see the doctor�.�
Steve could see that she didn�t know if she had done the wrong thing by
the way she was now biting her lip. �Well slave, usually you would have to wait
for permission, but given the unusual morning we have had, it is ok.�� Lisa let out the breath she had been holding
and started to wonder who the man standing behind her master was.� 

&nbsp;

Steve knew that she must be curious about
who Justin was but wanted to hold off for a bit longer before letting her know.
�Stand slave.� Lisa stood before him and remembered to move her feet
apart.� She didn�t know what to do with
her hands so she put them back behind her head. She knew she had made the right
choice when she saw him smile at her.� He
beckoned the other man to come closer and she started to worry about who he was
and why he was here. She hoped he wouldn�t touch her, but knew that she would
have to let him if he wanted to.� 

&nbsp;

Steve saw her tense up as Justin came
closer and could see in her eyes that she was worried.� Justin stood beside Steve, � You are right,
she is just gorgeous, and for such a new girl, she is behaving very well.� �Yes,
I am pleased with her progress, especially considering the added extras we have
had to deal with.� At this comment, Lisa knew that this new man had been told
what had happened to her and dropped her head in shame. Seeing this, Steve
reached out and lifted her head back up making her look at him. �Don�t be
embarrassed, you have done nothing wrong. Now, I suppose you are wondering who
our guest is, hey?� � Yes master.� � This is Justin, but you will address him
as Sir.� He is going to be assisting me
in your training, especially when the doctor arrives. Say hello� Lisa looked at
the man, and said, � Hello sir.� 

��Hello my dear, as your master said, I will be
here to help with your training, you will obey me as you do your master. Any
hesitation to obey will result in you being punished. Do you understand
slave�� � Yes sir�� 

&nbsp;

�Well now the introductions are over, I
need to get things ready next door for the doctor. Justin will you stay here
and keep our lovely new slave company for me?�

�Of course, I am sure we can find lots of
things to talk about.�� Steve could see
Lisa biting her lip again as he arranged for Justin to stay with her. He knew
he was pushing her a bit fast to accept someone else to be in charge of her,
but he had to catch up some of the time he had lost. He also trusted Justin not
to take advantage of the situation.� 

&nbsp;

Lisa watched as her master left, leaving
her with alone with the other man. She felt him watching her and wanted so much
to be anywhere else but here.� She felt
him guide her to the bed and urge her to sit down. Much to her relief, he sat
in the chair nearby, just as her master had this morning. 

&nbsp;

Justin watched as this new slave sat on the
bed, biting her lower lip. Steve had mentioned that she did that when she was
nervous.� � Slave, I understand that you
have been through a lot since you have been here.� Your master has told me your story and I am
sorry that had to happen to you.� He saw that she again dropped her head and
reached out to lift it up, just as he had seen Steve do earlier. � As your
master said, there is no need for embarrassment.� I am pleased that your master is willing to
take the time to get you the help you will need to complete your training.� You are lucky, not every master would have
bothered.� At this, Lisa looked up and for the first time really looked at the
man sitting opposite her.� He looked to
be a bit younger then her master, with short blonde hair and very green eyes.
He too was well built. He was quite handsome but he too had the same edge she
saw in her master.� One that meant that
while he could be quite nice he also would be quick to discipline her when
necessary.

&nbsp;

��Do
you think you are lucky, slave?�� Lisa
wasn�t sure what to say, �I�m not sure.�
I haven�t really had a chance to think about it Sir.� However, if what you say is true, and another
master may not have bothered with me, then yes, maybe in a strange way, I am
lucky sir.� Justin listened to the answer and had to agree with Steve that this
girl was certainly different to any other he had trained. � Well said, now I
have been told that you used to be a member of the track team. I used to run
also, what was you best time?� Lisa spent the next ten minutes talking about
her running days. In the back of her mind she couldn�t help but wonder at the
strangeness of talking about running while being naked in front a man who would
help train her to become a slave.��
However, it did help to lessen her fears and relax a bit, which was a
good thing.

&nbsp;

Justin observed the change in her as they
talked about running. It was something that he felt was important while
training a new girl � giving her some time to forget what was happening to her,
if only for a short time.� It didn�t
always work though, as some girls found any talk of things they used to do upsetting,
but with most he found they relaxed as they could take their mind off the
situation they were in for a short time.�


He also found that it helped the girls to
see him as someone who was not all bad.

&nbsp;

Neither of them heard Steve re enter the
room, so he sat and watched them for a while. He also noticed how much more
relaxed Lisa looked than when he had left.�
She even gave a brief but lovely smile.�
It made him even more determined to help her through her training.� He looked at his watch and saw that it was
almost time for John to arrive with Caitlin.�
�As much as I hate to interrupt you two, it is almost time for the
doctor to arrive.� Justin, could you go
and meet her and bring her up for me please? John will be expecting you.��� � Of course, slave Lisa, I will see you
soon� 

&nbsp;

Lisa watched him go and again marvelled at
how normal everything had just felt, despite her lack of clothes.� It had been good to be able to think about
something else for a little while.� She
saw her master walking over to sit on the bed beside her. �So, I see that you
were having a good conversation.� Did it
make you feel better about having him around to help?�� �Oh yes master, it was so nice to be able to
talk about something else and I am not so worried about him being a part of my
training anymore. He also told me that not every master would have bothered to
help me. Is that true?��� � Yes, I would
imagine that would be true for some trainers that I know. What else did he
say?�� � That I was lucky to have you to
train me Master, and I think I can say that he was right.� Although, if I had a choice I would not be
here, since I am, I am glad that you are willing to help me Master� Lisa
stopped and wondered at how she could feel this way about a man who was holding
her captive, but then she also knew from bitter experience how he could be
treating her. 

&nbsp;

Steve yet again wondered at this amazing
girl.� What would have crushed most girls
her age had somehow seemed to make her even stronger.� He was about to say something, when his phone
rang. Knowing it would be Justin letting him know that he was back with the
doctor, he left Lisa on the bed and went out the door to meet them both. Lisa
suddenly realised that if the doctor was coming here, then her earlier thought
of getting away and even getting clothes was now gone.� She wondered what the doctor would be
like.� When the door opened and the two
men returned with the most beautiful woman that Lisa had ever seen, she could
only stare.�� Surely this was not the
doctor, but she was dressed like a doctor. 

&nbsp;

Chapter Five � The Doctor

&nbsp;

�Slave, this is doctor Caitlin, please say
hello� Lisa stood up and faced the doctor, �Hello doctor Caitlin, I am
Li--�.� She realised she didn�t know how
to introduce herself anymore.� �Doctor,
this is Lisa, my new slave.� Slave, you
will be given one to two hours each afternoon to spend with the doctor. I will
not stay in the room during this time but will be just next-door if needed.
Feel free to say anything at all to the doctor as you need to, you will not be
punished for any opinion expressed to the doctor.� She is here to help and can only do that if
you let her.� Ok, that being said, there
is some food and drink on the table for you both, which you have permission to
enjoy.� 

&nbsp;

Once the men had left the room, Lisa went
to sit at the table with the food. She was hungry, but didn�t want to eat
unless the doctor did.� She was pleased
when the Caitlin came and sat down too. �Go on, eat, I can see that you want
to.� You are allowed and I know how
hungry training can make you.� Lisa wondered at the remark, but let it go as
she picked up a sandwich to eat. � I see the food had not changed much, I was
so sick of sandwiches by the time I left here. Mind you they always tasted
great when you were almost starving.��
Lisa again wondered at what the doctor was saying. When she had finished
that sandwich, she just had to ask, � Did you work here?� � Oh no, I was
trained here as a slave, just like you.� Lisa almost chocked on the sandwich
she was eating, �What, you are a slave, but you look so normal, I�m sorry, but
you know what I mean, don�t you.�� � Yes
I do know what you mean.�� I only get to
wear clothes when I am working with a patient, but once our session is over, I
will be naked again, like you.� Lisa could still not believe what she was
saying, but didn�t think she was lying to her.�
�Don�t worry, you can ask me all the questions you want later, but for
now, we have work to do�� 



&nbsp;



&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Steve took one last look at the two
beautiful slaves as he and Justin shut the door.� �Do you think Caitlin will be able to make a
difference?�� Justin asked Steve.� � I hope so, I really do. I may not have
known Lisa for very long, but I do feel that she is a natural submissive.� If she had not been raped, I am sure that she
would be one the best girls I have ever had the pleasure of training.�� Both of the men sat down on the comfortable
leather couch.� Steve reached out and
picked up the remote control and turned on the TV set.� On the screen they could see Lisa and Caitlin
eating the sandwiches left for them.�
They could just hear what they were saying, as the volume was turned
down for now. � I know that I should respect the doctor/patient privacy, but
there is just not enough time to have Caitlin relate what happens in each session,
plus this way I can be aware of what is happening.�� 

&nbsp;

�Are you also taping the sessions, just in
case�, Steve smiled at Justin, thinking again about how alike they were. �
Naturally, you know, I think it is going to be fun working with you.�� As the girls on the screen moved from the
couch to the bed, Steve turned up the sound so they could hear what they were
saying.� Over the next two hours the two
men sat and listened as Caitlin encourage Lisa to describe the painful details
of her rape.� Though Steve knew that Lisa
had suffered at the hands of the men who had raped her, it wasn�t until he
heard all the details that he began to have some understanding of why she was
still having nightmares eight months later.�
Neither man spoke during the time that Lisa and Caitlin were talking,
and were surprised when the alarm went on Steve�s watch, indicating that the
two hours were over already. Steve stood up and poured them both a strong
drink.� As the two men quickly threw down
the drinks, both were reflecting on what they had heard. On the screen, they
could see Caitlin hug Lisa and move to knell near the door. She had a timer
that let her know when the two hours were over too.� She knew that she was now just a slave again,
and had to act like one.� 

&nbsp;

Chapter Six - Slaves

&nbsp;

Lisa saw Caitlin move and kneel in front of
the door.� For a moment she wondered why
and then remembered what she had said about being a slave too.� She couldn�t believe that the woman who had
just encouraged and comforted her while she told her story was the same woman
who now knelt, head bowed, in front the door. Lisa heard the door begin to
open, and suddenly remembered that she should be doing the same thing. She
hurried to kneel beside Caitlin and was just rising to put her hands behind her
head when the two men entered the room.�
Her heart was beating hard and she felt sure that everyone in the room
could hear it beating.� Lisa gave a start
as she felt a hand reach out and touch her chin, lifting her face to look up
her master.� � Slave, you have done
well.� Stand now�.� Lisa stood and let herself be led to sit back
onto the bed.� 

&nbsp;

Caitlin remained on her knees as Lisa�s
master moved her over to sit on the bed.�
She was not sure what would happen now, but knew that it could not be
any worse then what she suffered at the hands of her own master.� She could still feel the welts that he had
placed on her body the night before. Even though she had been a slave now for
over 3 years, she still found it hard to get used to the pain her Master made
her suffer.� She didn�t think she was a
bad slave, but Master John always found a reason to punish her.� She became aware of Lisa�s master standing in
front of her again and of the other man moving to sit on the bed beside
Lisa.� � Stand slave and remove your
clothes� �Yes sir,�� �Slave while you are
here, you will call me Master.� �Yes Master, sorry Master�.� She stood and proceeded to remove all her
clothes, placing them on the hangers that her temporary master held out to
her.� Once he had put her clothes over
the back of the chair, he turned to look her.�


&nbsp;

Steve turned to look at Caitlin.� She was just as beautiful as he remembered.
�Turn around slave�. �Yes Master�.� As
Caitlin turned to show him her back, he saw the fresh welts.� He remembered seeing her at the party with
similar marks on her body.� He reached
and ran his fingers gently along one of the many marks on her back, feeling her
tense under his touch. �Slave, are you very disobedient or does your master
just like to make you suffer?�� Caitlin
had often wondered the same thing. �Master, this slave tries hard to do as her
master wishes but often seem to fail him.�

Steve considered what she had said, and
thought that from what he knew about Master John that any slave would find it
hard to please him. 

&nbsp;

Lisa, sitting on the bed with Justin,
gasped in shock on seeing Caitlin�s back.�
How could she stand the pain, she wondered.� Justin was sitting behind her and had his
hands sitting loosely on her shoulders. She felt his grip become a bit firmer
as she watched her master gently touch Caitlin�s back.� Justin was aware that his grip on Lisa�s
shoulders had tightened as he watched Steve trace his fingers over Caitlin�s
beautiful back.� Although he was not one
to punish his slaves as severely as Master John seemed to like to do, he was
not averse to giving his slaves a good flogging. He hoped he would be able to
introduce Lisa to that pleasure during his time here.

&nbsp;

Steve gave Caitlin a slight push on her
shoulders, letting her know he wanted her to move more in the middle of the
room.� He stopped her when she was in the
spot he wanted her to be and turned her around to face him.� �Slave, you have not yet welcomed me as your new
master.� Caitlin felt firm hands on her shoulders, pushing her down to her
knees again.� �Yes Master�. She reached
up and undid his belt and then his zip, lowering his trousers around his
feet.� She then freed his penis from his
underpants and took the tip his large cock into her mouth.� She was aware of shocked gasps coming from
the bed and the doctor part of her wondered briefly what Lisa�s reaction would
be. 

&nbsp;

Lisa now knew why her master had ensured
that Justin was sitting behind her.� As
soon as she became aware of what he wanted Caitlin to do, she tried to turn
away from the scene in front of her eyes.�
However, she found the she was firmly held by Justin and was unable to
move. Even when she tried to close her eyes, he grabbed her hair and whispered
for her to watch. Justin could feel Lisa trying to turn away from the sight of
Caitlin servicing Steve, but he knew that he had to make her watch.� He could feel her breathing become more
ragged and felt her start to shake.� 

&nbsp;

Caitlin worked her new masters thick cock
up and down her throat.� She knew that
over the years, she had become very good at this skill and rarely now did she
find herself gagging on a cock.� This was
very different from when she first came here to be trained.� She had not had very much experience with
giving blowjobs, not really liking the feeling of having a man�s cock in her
mouth.� However, having to perform this
task over and over until she was able to overcome her gag reflex soon made her
very good.� It was not something that she
really enjoyed but she had been a slave for long enough to know what was expected
of her. 

&nbsp;

Steve felt Caitlin work her mouth and
throat over his cock.� It had been a
while since he had had a trained slave work on him, and he was savouring the
difference.� He was used to having to
give instructions and to hearing the sound of the girl gagging on his cock as
she attempted to deep throat him.� He
knew that this was something that he would have to get Lisa used to, but for
now he just enjoyed the sensations Caitlin was giving him.� He felt himself ready to cum and reached down
to grab Caitlin�s head as he exploded deep down her throat. He slowly came back
to reality again as he felt 
Caitlin�s head pushing back on his hands and he realised that his cock was
still deep in her throat, blocking off her air.�
He removed his hands, letting her move her head off his cock and take a
few deep breaths, getting air back into her lungs.� 

&nbsp;

Lisa felt like the room was spinning as she
watched Caitlin struggle to breath with her master�s large cock in her
throat.� She felt she was back in the van
trying desperately to breathe with some stranger�s big cock forcing it way down
her throat.� She knew that she would have
to do that too and hoped that it was not today.�
She was aware of Justin holding her in place, but was too focused on
what was happening in front of her to worry about him.� 

&nbsp;

Justin could tell that Caitlin�s blowjob
was having an affect on Lisa.� He could
feel her shaking and thought that if he weren�t holding onto her, she would be
in a heap on the floor.� He felt her go
limp in his arms and worried that she had fainted, lay her down onto the
bed.� Lisa felt herself being moved to be
laid down on the bed. She still felt a bit dizzy, but not as much as
before.� She was aware of Justin looking
down at her with a concerned look on his face. �Slave, are you alright?� I thought I was going to have to pick you up
from the floor.�� Lisa looked up into his
green eyes, �Yes Sir, I just felt a bit dizzy.�
I am starting to feel better now though, thank-you sir.�� Justin was about to say something more when
he became aware of Steve standing beside the bed.� �Justin, could you take Slave Caitlin into
the bathroom to let her have a shower.� Justin nodded and moved off the bed. 

&nbsp;

Lisa lay and watched Justin move away from
the bed and lead Caitlin into the bathroom.�
She didn�t want to look at her master, not sure what he wanted of
her.� She found herself shaking and
flinched away from him as he reached out to touch her.� Steve saw her move away from him as he
reached out to touch her. �Slave, stay still� Lisa heard his command and
despite wanting to move away, forced herself to stay still. �Good, now look at
me�. Lisa really didn�t want to do that, but she also didn�t want to make him
angry with her.� It took all the courage
she had to turn her head and look at him.�
By now he was sitting on the bed near her, touching her hair.� �Tell me what you are feeling?� Lisa knew
from experience that he would expect a full answer.� �Master, I know that you were not hurting
Caitlin, but .. but it was very hard to watch you do what you did and not feel
like it was happening again to me.� Lisa paused to take a deep breathe before
she continued, �When I saw you grab her hair and hold yourself in her throat, I
felt the room spin and if Sir had not put me down on the bed, I am not sure
what would have happened Master�� 

&nbsp;

Steve could hear the nervousness in her
voice and knew that she had found it very hard to tell him her feelings. He
sensed though that she had not told him everything, and gripped her hair in his
fist. �Slave, you are not telling me something, what is it? Lisa gasped as he
again pulled on her hair, wondering yet again about his ability to seem to read
her mind. � Master, I am worried about doing what Caitlin did.� I don�t know if I will be able to do it� She felt
his grip lessen and his hand stroke her hair.�
�Slave, I will expect you to perform the same act but I know that you
have little experience.� I will instruct
you when the time comes and gradually you will reach the level that Caitlin
has.�� Lisa felt some relief at his
words, but still worried about when he would start his instruction.� She wanted to ask but knew that she couldn�t
unless he allowed her to speak again. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

In the bathroom, Justin led Caitlin in the
shower and watched as she washed herself under the spray of water. He was
fighting the urge to enter the shower with her, but as Steve was her temporary
master, he knew that he had to wait for his ok before he could get too
close.� At least he had the pleasure of
watching her beautiful body as she cleaned herself.� He saw her wince as she gently cleaned her
back and he thought that she could need some ointment on her back when she was
finished.� He moved to look in the
cupboards under the sink and found just what he was looking for.� He also managed to find a towel, which he
held out to Caitlin as she stepped out of the shower.

&nbsp;

Caitlin took the towel and began to dry
herself off. She knew to do this quickly and not hide her body for too
long.� She had been grateful for the
opportunity to have a shower, but was worried about how Lisa was.� She had seen she had been lying down on the
bed and did not know why.� �Slave, turn
around and show me your back�.� 
Caitlin turned around and tensed when she felt his fingers on her sore back.
�Relax, I am just going to put some ointment on.� I don�t want to see an infection spoil your
time here with us.�� Caitlin felt his
firm fingers rub the ointment into her back and her bottom.� It was a bit painful, but she was grateful
for the act.� Master John never let her
put anything onto her welts unless he could see that they were getting
infected. This simple act put her mind at ease and let her know that the men
who would control her during her time here would be firm but not merciless.� This thought brought tears to her eyes.� 

&nbsp;

Justin finished working the ointment and
turned Caitlin around to face him again. He saw that she was crying and worried
that he had hurt her. �Slave, I am sorry if I hurt you, but they looked at bit
red to me.� Do you need some pain killers?�� Caitlin, hearing his concern, tried to
control her self enough to answer him. � No sir, you did not hurt me. In fact,
it was for the opposite reason that I was crying.� � Sorry, I do not understand
what you mean.�� � Sir, I want to tell
you but it would mean talking against Master John, and I am not sure if I
should do that.�� Justin saw the fear in
her eyes as she mentioned her Master�s name. �Slave, what you tell me will not
get back to Master John�s ears.� Now, why
were you crying?�� Caitlin somehow knew
that he would not tell her Master, so she decided to be honest with him.� �Sir, I was crying because that is first time
in a long time that anyone has cared about if I was hurting or not.�� �Surely John uses ointment on you, I mean it
is so easy for a welt to become infected.��
� No Sir, Master John only lets me get some relief if he sees any major
infections. He likes me to have to bear the pain, especially when he knows I
need to be dressed to be with a patient.��
Caitlin wondered if she had said too much, but knew it was too late to
take back what she had said.� 

&nbsp;

Justin could not believe what he was
hearing. As much as he enjoyed watching a girl suffer under his own hand, he
never let them suffer after, always making sure he gave what pain relief was
necessary. He also knew that the only way to keep a girl strong enough to
survive her training was to keep her healthy.�
He supposed that everyone treated slaves in different ways, but still
felt that John was playing a dangerous game with his slave. He wiped away her
tears and led her back into the bedroom. 

&nbsp;

Steve stood Lisa up as Justin and Caitlin
entered back into the room.� He could see
that Justin had applied some ointment to her back. �Justin, thank you for
putting some ointment onto Caitlin�s back, I was thinking that I would have to
do that later.� Now if you don�t mind
keeping her company for a bit longer, I will see you at dinner. Feel free to
make yourself at home.�� �Thanks, I will�

&nbsp;

Lisa had hoped to talk to Caitlin about
what had happened earlier, but it was obvious that was not going to
happen.� However, she did manage to catch
her eye and although she looked like she had been crying she did not seem too
worried about going with Justin.� In
fact, she almost looked pleased. Lisa wondered what had happened in the
bathroom. �Come on, slave, I think it is time for a shower.�� Lisa was led into the bathroom, and was about
to step into the shower when she felt her master�s hand on her shoulder. �Hold
on, where do you think you are going?� Lisa froze, not knowing what he meant.
�I was going into the shower, isn�t that what you said for me to do
Master?�� Steve could hear the confusion
in her voice.� �Well I did say it was time
for a shower, but I didn�t say it was only for you, now did I?� Lisa turned to
face him, hoping that she had miss heard him.�
�What� I mean, no master, you didn�t say that.� I just thought�� she did not finish her
sentence as Steve was starting to take off his shirt.� 

&nbsp;

Steve could see the panic in her face as he
took off his shirt.� A part of him wanted
to laugh at the shocked look on her face but he knew that this would be a big
test for her, so he kept a straight face.�
Lisa did not know what to do.� She
wanted to just close her eyes and make everything go away.� Instead she turned away so she was not
looking at him anymore. She was aware of more movement beside her and knew that
he was undressing fully. She just kept her eyes looking down at the ground,
almost as if by ignoring him, he might go away.�


&nbsp;

Steve could see what she was doing and let
her be. He knew once they were in the shower she would have to look at
him.� When he was naked, he gripped her
shoulders and led her into the shower. He reached around her to turn on the
water, feeling her shrink away from him. �Slave, turn around� Lisa felt like
her feet were glued to the bottom of the shower.� She knew she had to turn around, but didn�t
know if she could. �I said turn around, now!��
Lisa heard the threat in his voice, but still felt frozen to the
spot.� It was not until she felt a hard
slap on her bottom did she turn around. �Now, what did I say about doing as you
are told. You are lucky I am in a good mood and you only got one slap. Next
time, don�t expect to be so lucky.� Lisa could feel herself starting to panic again.� She looked to see how much room there was
between his body and the entry into the shower, but knew that even if she could
fit past him, there was little chance that she would actually make it out of
bathroom, or even the shower. She wondered what he intended to do and the more
she stood there waiting the more nervous she became.� 

&nbsp;

Steve could see that she was looking for
escape routes out of the shower.� He
purposely kept her on edge, waiting for her to look at him.� He knew that eventually she would not be able
to not look at him. He had been here before and he had not been proved wrong
yet.� When she finally raised her eyes to
look at him, he could see she was once again biting her lip.� �I was wondering when you would look at me.
Now, I need you to pick up the sponge and soap and clean me.� Do a good job, and I might not have to finish
your spanking.� Lisa wasn�t sure if he was serious about the spanking but knew
he was serious about her doing a good job.�
She soaped up the sponge and began to sponge his chest, then his arms,
back and his legs, even lifting his feet to clean under them.� She purposely did not look at his penis as
she cleaned his thighs.� When she was
done she went to put the sponge away when he said.� � I thought I said to do a good job, you are
not finished yet.�� Lisa went to say that
she was, when she realised what he was talking about.� Surely he didn�t mean that she had to clean
his penis. Up until this afternoon, she had not even seen a man�s penis, let
alone touched one.� She looked at him,
hoping that maybe she was mistaken, but when he looked at her and then down at
himself, she wasn�t mistaken. She would have to actually touch it.� 

&nbsp;

Steve saw her continued discomfort, but
knew that this was an important step in the training process. He had to get her
comfortable touching him.� Lisa looked at
the sponge for a moment, then not wanting to be spanked again, she reached down
to where his penis should be. �You will have to look at it sometime, you know�.
She looked up at him quickly and finally looked down at his penis.� It was much the same size it had been earlier
and she knew that meant that it was almost fully erect.� She used the sponge to wipe it, jumping when
it moved under the sponge.� Lisa had
hoped she could just use the sponge but saw that it wouldn�t work. She brought
her hand to hold it and was surprised by the warmth she felt. She used the
sponge to carefully clean every part of his penis, trying not to think too much
about what she was doing. She moved her hand away, �uh, uh I do believe you
have missed something or should I say two things.�� She couldn�t believe he wanted her to clean
his balls too, but she did, trying to be as quick as she could. 

&nbsp;

Steve felt her cleaning his balls and found
it hard not to cum on the spot.� He
reached out and grabbed her hand, making her gasp, and placed it around his
penis.� He moved her hand up and down,
forcing her to rub his penis. Lisa tried to pull her hand away but his grip was
just too strong.� She could feel the cock
jump and sensed that he was about to cum. She tried even harder to pull her
hand away, but it was held tight.�
Suddenly she felt a warm, sticky substance covering her hand.� She tried to pull her hand away again and to
her surprise this time she was able to.�
She somehow pushed past him and had almost made it to the bathroom door
when she felt his strong arm wrap around her waist.� She screamed and kicked, but found his hand
covering her mouth as he moved her forward into the room until she was lying
face down on the bed.� She was turned
over and her arms gathered in one of his, held up over her head.� He still had his hand over her mouth and was
straddling her body so she was unable to move.��


&nbsp;

Steve had been stunned for the moment by
the force of his cum and by the time he had realised she was not in the shower
anymore, he saw her running towards the door.�
Now he watched her chest rise and fall, her eyes wide and fearful.� After they had both calmed down a bit, he
removed his hand from her mouth.� He
still, however, kept her hands locked in his, as he didn�t quite trust her not
to come out fighting. 

&nbsp;

Lisa was not sure what had just happened.
One moment she was being forced to jerk him off in the shower and the next she
was lying on the bed with him almost sitting on her and his hand holding hers
in a tight grip.� She waited with dread
to see what he would do, scared that she would be punished for running from
him.

&nbsp;

�Ok, now that we both have some breath
back, do you want to tell me what that was? You didn�t really think you could
get away that easy, did you slave?�� Lisa
tried to look away from him, but found her head held firmly. �Don�t push me,
now tell me what you thought you were doing!��
� I don�t know.� I didn�t plan
that to happen, I think I just panicked and when you let my hand go, I just
found my self running.� Please, I am
sorry Master.� Please don�t punish me, I
didn�t mean it, please,� Lisa found her self crying yet again, but just
couldn�t seem to control it.� It had just
been too much on top of everything that had happened over the past two days. 

&nbsp;

Steve listened to her crying pleas and
considered what to do. He knew now that he had pushed her too far after
everything she had already been through but also knew that if he gave in
without any form of punishment, then she would think she could get away with
something like that again.�� � Slave, I
am sorry, but I can�t let behaviour like that go without some form of
punishment.� He heard her cry a bit louder at his comment. �I had promised a
spanking if you did not do a good job, so that is what you will get.� Now when I let go of your hands and stand up,
you will turn over and spread out your arms to grip the top of the bed.� If you do this by yourself, I will only give
you twenty slaps, however if I have to move you I will double the number,
understand?� Lisa heard what he said and though she did not want to be spanked,
answered yes master and rolled over and lay as he had asked.� She braced herself for the first blow, and
although she tried not to make a sound, found that by five she was crying
loudly with each slap.� By the time he
reached twenty she was too tired to cry and just lay sobbing on the bed. Her
bottom was on fire.� She had never been
spanked before and could not believe how much it had hurt.� 

&nbsp;

Steve knew that she had to be hurting. Her
bottom was a bright red and was very hot to touch.� �Just lie there and I will get something to
make you feel a bit better.� He went into the bathroom and came back with the
same ointment Justin had used earlier on Caitlin.� He felt her flinch when he touched her bottom
to rub the cream in.� Lisa felt him
rubbing something onto her bottom, which although did not take all of the pain
away, at least removed the worst of the throbbing pain that she had been
feeling. She was hoping he would leave her alone for a while, but instead she
felt him sit on the bed next to her.�
�There, that should ease some of the worst pain, though you will feel
sore for a while I am afraid.� I hope
that you can learn from this, slave.� Lisa turned her head to face into the
room.� �Yes master, I am sorry. I will
try harder next time.� Lisa realised that she really meant this.� She didn�t like the thought of being punished
again, sensing that next time he would punish her even more severely.� �Now, stay there for a while and I will come
and get you when it is time to eat.�� He
brushed her hair out of her eyes and returned to the bathroom to get
dressed.� Returning to the room, he saw
that her eyes were closed and she appeared to be asleep. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Lisa heard him leave the room.� She had not been asleep but was pleased that
he thought she was.� She had not wanted
to look at him again as he left the room. Her head was spinning with everything
that had happened over the last few hours.�
Her emotions felt like they were all over the place.� She hated the way he had treated her, firstly
expected him to wash him and then cumming all over her hand. She hated the
control he seemed to have over her and most of all she hated the way she had
felt after he had spanked her. Not because of the pain but because she somehow
felt he had more control over her now than ever.� She knew that she would try even harder to
please him and do what he said, not only because she didn�t want to be punished
but because she could feel him gaining more and more control over her the
longer she was here.� Maybe they were
right; maybe she was just a natural submissive who had no control anymore.� With these thoughts running around her head,
Lisa did actually manage to drift off to sleep.

�

Chapter Six � Slave Caitlin

&nbsp;

Steve wasn�t sure what he was feeling as he
shut the door behind him. He felt a bit responsible for what had happened but
also knew that in terms of her training, they had taken a big step forward.
Once a girl had actually been punished for the first time, they usually obeyed
even more; knowing that further punished would be applied if needed.� He went and poured himself a drink and sat
down on the couch.� He could see her on
the screen and was sure that she was asleep. He heard a noise and looked up as
Justin and Caitlin entered the room.�
Caitlin came and knelt down on the ground at his feet, while Justin
poured himself a drink too and sat down beside him.� �Wow, that is one red bottom, what
happened?�� While Steve told him, Caitlin
listened, thinking that this would be something that they would need to talk
about in their session tomorrow afternoon.�
She found it hard not to ask to talk to Lisa now, but knew that unless
she was given permission, she would have to wait.� 

&nbsp;

�Slave do you know how to cook?� Steve
suddenly asked her. Caitlin was a very good cook and often made the evening
meal for Master John. �Yes master, would you like me to prepare the meal for
this evening?�� �Yes, come with me into
the kitchen�.� 

In the kitchen, Caitlin prepared a simple
meal of steak and salad while the two men talked. She was glad to have
something to do. Her mind was so full of everything that had happened today
that she needed the distraction.� She had
had an interesting time with Justin, who apart from getting her to give him a
blowjob had not touched her.� Instead
they had talked about lots of different things.�
It had almost seemed normal, like before she had been taken and trained,
however she had never had a conversation with a man who was dressed while she
was naked before she had been taken.� She
couldn�t work the two men out. They were just so different not only to master
John but to the man who had trained her.�
She didn�t know if it was because she had been older and more set in her
ways, but she had received quite rough treatment when she had last been
here.� It was not that she thought the
two men were soft, but that they seemed to care about the girl as much as the
training. She had always just assumed that all of the trainers and masters were
the same, but now she was seeing that there were other kinds of men who could
still control but in a way that was not so brutal.

She thought that if she had a master like
that all the time, she might not hate being a slave as much as she did.� 

&nbsp;

Justin was enjoying himself talking to
Steve while watching Caitlin prepare the meal.�
He liked Steve and found that their views about training were very
similar.� He had told Steve about what
Caitlin had said about John and found that they shared the same thoughts on the
matter.� Neither of them felt that the
girl needed to suffer anymore than was necessary after a punishment was
over.� 

&nbsp;

When the meal was almost ready, Steve went
back to the room to bring Lisa out to eat.�
She seemed to be still sleeping when he came into the room but saw her
eyes open when he sat down on the bed.� �
Come slave, Caitlin has a meal ready and it is time to eat.� Lisa rolled onto
her back to sit up and winced when her bottom touched the bed. She managed to
stand but found she was not able to look at her master.� She felt him reach out and touch her hair,
�Slave, don�t worry, I am not angry with you anymore. Know that once a
punishment is over, I don�t hold any grudges.�
I hope you can feel the same way?� Lisa had not thought of it that way,
she just figured that her feelings would not even be considered. � I don�t hold
any grudges, Master, though I was worried about you still being angry. Thank
you for helping me to understand master.��
Lisa was still upset over what had happened but felt that it was a
feeling she would have to get used to. �Turn around and let me see what that
bottom looks like now� Lisa was embarrassed but did as she was asked. �That is
not too bad, do you feel like you want some more cream put on before we go?� �
No thank you, master, it is not as sore as it was.��� 

&nbsp;

As Lisa was led out of the room she had
been kept in for the first time in two days, she felt strangely excited.� She didn�t know where she was being taken but
at least she would be somewhere different for a while.� She looked around with interest as she was
taken through what looked to be a lounge room to a large kitchen.� She saw that Justin was already seated at a
table with Caitlin kneeling on the floor beside him.� The smell of the food made her mouth water
and she hoped she would not have to wait too long before being allowed to eat.
�Well, slave, I hear you had an interesting afternoon.� Come over here and show me what your
beautiful bottom looks like.� �Yes Sir.� Lisa made her way over to where Justin
was sitting, blushing slightly at the thought of yet again showing her bottom
to a man. Justin saw the blush on Lisa�s face and was reminded of how young and
inexperienced she was. He touched her bottom gently seeing already the redness was
fading and that there would be no bruising.�
�Mmm, I guess you have learnt a big lesson. It is not a good idea to
disobey your master, is it?� � No sir, it is not.�� 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Chapter Seven � An unwelcome visitor

&nbsp;

Three weeks
later

&nbsp;

Steve was pleased with way Lisa�s training
had progressed over the last three weeks. Her sessions with Caitlin seemed to
be helping her greatly, even to the point where her nightmares seemed to have
stopped.� Lisa was also starting to react
better to sexual contact, though she still had her moments of panic. This did
really not surprise him, after what he knew about her rape.� The only thing that was concerning him at the
moment was a phone call he had received from John, Caitlin�s real master,
asking if he could come and see her this afternoon. He said that he was
swapping over the replacement slave that the company had offered him while
Caitlin was away and would have an hour or two to fill in.� Of course, Steve agreed and now he was
wondering when would be the best time to tell Caitlin. Over the last few weeks
he had got to know her quite well, and he knew that she was quite scared of
John.� 

&nbsp;

He looked at the TV screen and saw the two
slaves talking in the other room.� He had
just decided that he could not put off the task any longer, when Justin entered
the room. He told him about John�s upcoming visit.� He knew that Justin would be upset by this
news, as he had become quite fond the Caitlin over the last few weeks.� Justin heard the news about John�s visit and
told Steve that he would tell Caitlin.�
He knew that she would be not be too happy about seeing her real master,
especially as she had hoped that she have at least another three weeks before
she had to face him again.� Justin had
spent the last three weeks trying to think of ways that he could get her away
from John, even wondering if he could offer to buy her from his, but he had not
discussed that with anyone yet. He knew that today he could do nothing, but be
there later if she needed him.� 

&nbsp;

Caitlin was surprised to see the door open
and Justin and Steve enter the room, as she had at least another hour of the
session left.� She looked up and was
instantly concerned by the look on both of the men�s faces.� She went to knell down and was surprised to
feel Justin grip her arm and stand her up in front of him.� For a moment she wondered if she was in
trouble, but could see that he did not look angry.� �Slave, you will have a visitor this
afternoon. Your Master John has asked to spend an hour or so with his slave,
and of course we had to agree.� He will
be here in about an hour, so you have plenty of time to prepare.�

&nbsp;

As Caitlin heard that Master John would be
here soon, she began to shake.� Over the
last three weeks she had almost been able to put her real master out of her mind,
as she found herself drawn more and more into her temporary life here.� She now knew that the way Master John treated
her was not the way that many other slaves were treated.� She had always just accepted the brutal way
he had always treated her as part of the life of being a slave.� She now knew that not all Masters were
cruel.� 

&nbsp;

Justin felt her begin to shake and looked
on with concern as he saw her face drain of colour.� He wished that he could just tell John that
he could not see her, but knew that he had no say in the matter. �Slave, look
at me.� I know that you are worried about
seeing your Master again, but there is nothing we can do about it.� Are you going to be all right? You look very
pale.�� He moved her to sit on the bed
and asked Lisa to get a wet cloth from the bathroom. When she returned, he
gently held the cloth to her forehead, until he could see some slight colour
return to her cheeks.� �Are you ok? Do
you need to lie down?� Caitlin could hear the concern in his voice and once
again compared him to her Master.� �No
sir, I don�t need to lie down. I am feeling much better now.�� However, she knew as she said this that it
was a lie. She felt sick, not knowing how she would get through the afternoon
visit. The only thoughts that keep her going was that she knew that Justin and
Master Steve would be there to help when he had gone, unlike at home where she
would be left to suffer.� She felt
slightly better at this thought, and began to stand up.� �Sir, I think I should have a shower before
my master arrives. Is it ok to do that now?���
Justin said yes and watched her walk, still slightly shaky, into the
bathroom.� He made a move to follow her
when he felt a hand on his arm.� �Justin,
she needs to be alone for while, come and have a drink.� Slave, stay here and tell Slave Caitlin that
I will call for her when her master arrives.��


&nbsp;

Lisa said that she would do that and sat on
the bed as the two men left the room.�
She waited for Caitlin to finish her shower and rushed to give her a
hug.�� She could feel Caitlin sobbing as
she tried to comfort her. Once she had calmed down a little bit, she gave her
the message and brought her over to sit on the bed beside her. She felt a bit
strange, as over the last few weeks, it was often Caitlin comforting her as she
helped her to deal with her past.�
�Caitlin, I wish I could help you like you have helped me.� I can only tell you that your are a brave and
beautiful woman, and I am sure that you will get through this.� On hearing
these words, Caitlin reached up to hug her new friend again.� This was something else she would miss when
she had to leave.� She had not had a
friend to comfort her for so long, she had almost forgotten what it felt like.
�Oh god Lisa, I hope so.� He just scares
me so much.� He is not like Master Steve
or Sir.� He doesn�t care about me; only
what he can do to me.� I had allowed
myself to forget him for a while, and know I..��
Caitlin did not finish her words, as the door opened and the two men
entered the room.� 

&nbsp;

Justin helped Caitlin to her feet as Steve
did the same for Lisa.� He wanted to say
something, but knew that whatever he said would not change the situation.� Caitlin took a deep breath and let herself be
led by Sir into the lounge room. � I think that I should take Caitlin in to greet
John.� Can you stay here with my slave
until I return?�� Justin nodded and
watched as Steve led Caitlin into the room at the end of the hall.� He could hear the men talking as they said
their hellos.� He became aware of a
strange sound beside him and turned to see Lisa gasping for breath. �Slave,
what is wrong. I know you are worried about your fellow slave, but there in
nothing was can do for now.�� He was just
in time to catch Lisa as she tumbled to the floor.� 

&nbsp;

Steve entered the room in time to see
Justin lay Lisa down onto the couch. �What happened?� � I�m not sure, I heard
her gasping and the next I knew she had fainted.�� �While I get her back to her bed, keep an eye
on what is happening on the TV.� I know
that we shouldn�t be taping them, but I just don�t trust him.� 

&nbsp;

Lisa felt herself waking up and wondered
why she was on her bed. Hadn�t she been in the lounge � she suddenly remembered
the voice and opened her eyes.� It was
the same voice, she was sure it was, and he was here. She started to shake and
tried to get up to get away. � Slave! Lisa!�
Calm down, calm down.�� Lisa heard
the voice and turned to where it came from. � Shhh, you are ok. Quiet now.�� �Please don�t let him hurt me, please,
please.� Steve didn�t know what she was saying, but realised that this was more
than just worry over Caitlin. He wondered if this was another nightmare.� �Slave, it is over, you are safe here, calm
down.� Lisa tried to make herself be understood. �No, he is here, if he sees
me, he will hurt me. Don�t let him hurt me��


&nbsp;

�Who?�
Master John? Is that who you are worried about?�� Lisa realised that the voice she had heard
must belong to this Master John, and suddenly felt real fear for Caitlin�s safety.� �Caitlin, master, you have to help
Caitlin.� He will hurt her� Steve saw the
fear and pleading in her eyes as she asked him to help Caitlin.� �You know that I can�t. He is her master and
I can not interfere.�� Lisa knew that she
was not making much sense and struggled to sit up to face him. � No, you don�t
understand.� It is the same voice.� The same voice I have heard over and over in
my nightmares.� The voice of one of the
men who raped me.� I would know that
voice anywhere, and he is here. Please don�t let him hurt me again.�� 

&nbsp;

Steve sat stunned by what he was hearing.
Could she be right?� Had John been
involved in her rape? He had no reason to think that Lisa would lie to
him.� What if what she said was true and
John was one of the men who raped her?�
He knew that he could not just call the police and have him arrested, or
even confront the man. Realising that Lisa was waiting for him to respond, he
said, �Are you certain it is the same voice. I mean a lot people sound
alike?�� �Yes master, I am certain. It is
him, I know it is.�� Lisa felt like she
was in the middle of one of her nightmares, except this time she was awake.
What would she do if he saw her?� What if
her master did not believe her? �Slave, you have nothing to fear. I won�t let
him see you. He won�t hurt you�.� Lisa
felt a bit better knowing that she would not have to see him, but she was very
scared for what he might do to Caitlin. �Master, I am very scared for Caitlin.
Can�t you help her?� Please?�� Steve just pulled his slave to him to give
her a hug, knowing that there was nothing he could do. He felt a building anger
at the man who had hurt Lisa, but knew that to do anything now would risk him
taking Caitlin from them. For now he just had to wait and think about what he
could do.



&nbsp;



&nbsp;

Caitlin knelt in front of the man who was
her Master.� He had not spoken a word
since Master Steve had left and she was getting more nervous by the
minute.� She was shaking and just wished
that whatever he was going to do, he would just do it.� 

John knew that the longer he kept her
waiting, the more nervous she would become. He had missed her more then he
thought he would have, though he had enjoyed breaking in a new slave girl over
the last few weeks.� However, he had had
to be more careful then he usually was, as he knew that she needed to be fit to
be sold to her new master.� He was also
looking forward to getting another girl this afternoon.� For now though, he was just soaking in the
sight of his beautiful, scared slave girl.�
He reached down to grab her hair in his fist, feeling her flinch and
then gasp, as he pulled tighter. �Did you miss me slave?� I have missed you.�� 

&nbsp;

Caitlin struggled to breath as he pulled
her hair viciously back until she was forced to look up at the ceiling. �Yes
Master, your slave has missed you.�� She
knew what he wanted to hear, even though she knew it was a lie.� She found herself being pulled up to her feet
and spun sharply around so her back was facing him.� �Hmm, I can see though you have some colour
on your back, it is not the same as when you came here, is it slave?�� �No master.� Caitlin saw something dark move
in front of her face and then felt the blind fold being fastened tightly,
blocking off all light.� She hated being
blind folded as she lost any chance she might have of avoiding him.� Next she felt him pull her arms behind her,
and ties being applied very tightly to her elbows and to her wrists. Though her
shoulders screamed in pain, she only let out a grunt as he tightened her
bonds.� She hated to let him know how
much he hurt her �Now the game begins� he whispered in her ear.� She felt him turn her around and around until
her head was spinning and then suddenly let her go.� Not knowing where she was, she stood as still
as she could, trying not to fall over as her head spun.� She was scared to move, not knowing where he
was. They had played this game before and she hated it.� Sometimes he would make her stand for ages,
just waiting for him to make his move and other times it would be no time at
all before he began to hurt her.� He
seemed to know that making her wait only made her more nervous.� She then felt him pull her arms up, forcing
her body to tilt forward, and her arms were attached to something.� She was now unable to lower her arms.
Suddenly she felt back explode in the most awful pain. She went to move
forward, when he said, �Don�t you dare move bitch.�� Caitlin struggled to keep her feet still,
knowing from experience that he would only just keep hitting her until she
could stand still for the required number of strikes.� She never knew how many this would be, she
just prayed that today it would not be too many.� After what seemed like an eternity, he
finally stopped hitting her.� By now, she
was screaming out with the pain and her back and bottom were throbbing.� She felt her arms being pulled up even more,
forcing her body to move down more.� She
knew what was coming, but still jumped when she felt his big cock force it way
fully into her pussy.� She screamed with
each thrust, feeling the agony of his body hitting her burning bottom. She felt
his cock move within her, savagely forcing his way into her body. He gripped
her hips harder as she felt him start to cum.�
She screamed even louder as he slammed as hard as he could into her,
yelling as he spurted his cum into her body.�


&nbsp;

John smiled as he pulled his cock out of
his slave�s pussy.� He loved the way she
looked, her back and bottom covered with red stripes.� He could see her trying to catch her
breath.� He walked around until he was
standing in front of her and reached up to grip her hair.� He watched as her mouth opened and pushed his
dirty cock into her mouth, forcing to down to back of her throat in almost one
go.�� He had spent a lot of time in her
first year training her to take his big cock into her throat. At first, she had
been unable to succeed in taking all of him in, but over time and some not so
gentle persuasion she had become an expert.�
He worked his cock in and out of her throat, loving the feeling of her
warm mouth and pulsating throat.� He knew
that he would have to leave soon, but wanted to make sure his slave would not
forget him when he was gone.� He pulled
out of her throat and made his way back around his slave.� He used his hands to pull the cheeks of her
bottom apart and pushed as hard as he could into her anus.� He had to work hard to get his cock into her,
but once he did, he pushed his body forward, using all the force he had to
drive his cock to the hilt inside her.

&nbsp;

Caitlin screamed again as she felt his cock
push forcefully into her bottom.� She
could hardly breath from the pain she was feeling.� No matter how much she tried to block out the
pain, she was unable to do anything to ease it.�
She didn�t know how long he fucked her for, but it felt like forever.
When he was finished, he used her mouth to clean his cock.� She hated this the most, but knew better then
to let it show.� �Slave, do you have
something to say to your Master?�� �Thank
you master for using your slave� Caitlin had to force herself to thank him for
hurting her, but knew it was what he expected her to say. �Slave, I have to
leave you soon, but I can�t go without leaving something for you to remember me
by.� Caitlin trembled wondering what he would do.� She felt him pinch one of her nipples
sharply. When he moved to pinch her right nipple, she realised that she could
still feel the pinch in her other nipple.�
She knew that he had put some clamps on her. She was just thinking that
she could handle this when she felt her nipple pull down and begin to hurt more
and more, knowing that he had put weights onto each clamp. �Can you feel that
slave?� I will just leave these here as a
gift for Master Steve to remove later.�
Now you be a good slave while I am gone.�� With a final slap to her already sore bottom,
Caitlin heard him leave the room and the door close.� She hung, feeling her back throbbing and her
nipples aching, hoping that it would not be long before she was let free.� 

&nbsp;

Justin had watched the screen on and off
over the last hour.� Part of him wanted
to watch to make sure that Caitlin was OK but another part could not bear to
see her being so abused.� He knew it was
ironic, given what he did for a living, but he hated the way John was treating
his slave. Over the years he had trained many girls to be slaves, but he had
never treated any of them way he saw Caitlin being treated.� He always believed there had to me more then
fear to make a slave obey, more then just the physical force he could apply to
make a girl do what he wanted her to do. Sure, pure, brutal force could make a
girl do anything, but he had never wanted a girl to be so scared of him or what
he would do, that she couldn�t think. He liked to think that by the time he had
finished training a girl, she felt that she had found her true purpose in life,
and might actually enjoy her life as a slave or at least parts of it. 

&nbsp;

He felt like he was going crazy, knowing
that he could do nothing to help Caitlin.�
He was also confused over what had happened to Lisa, and wondered what
was keeping Steve so long.� He wanted to
go and see what was happening, but knew that Steve would be upset if didn�t
keep an eye on what was happening in the other room.� He looked at his watch and saw that it was
very close to the time that John would have to be leaving.� On the screen he could see him attach the
weighs to the clamps he had applied to Caitlin�s nipples, and winced at the
pain they must be causing her.� He
noticed that she was not screaming any more, but was sobbing quietly. It was
all he could do not to run in and stop her torment.� He thought of how good it would feel to give
John a taste of how he was treating his slave.�
Another time, he hoped, he would be able to do something.� 

&nbsp;

Steve had stayed with Lisa over the hour
that John was with Caitlin.� He wanted to
make sure that she knew she was safe from John, but he also didn�t want to have
to talk to Justin until John has gone.�
He knew he would have to tell Justin what Lisa had said, but was worried
about what he might do once he knew.� He
couldn�t risk Justin doing something stupid and John taking Caitlin with
him.� So he waited until he thought John
would be due to leave to return to the lounge room. He had left Lisa with more
promises that John would not see her, and that he would be back as soon as he
could be.� He didn�t like to leave her,
but knew John would want to see him before he left.� He saw Justin look up as he entered the room,
and could see that he wanted to know what was going on with Lisa, but he was
saved from saying anything as John appeared in the doorway.� He could see Justin fighting to control
himself, and was thankful he hadn�t told him anything yet. Steve said goodbye
to John, fighting the urge within him self to do major damage to the man, and
somehow managed to be polite. He breathed a sigh of relief when he was gone,
and turned to see Justin rushing past him to help Caitlin.

&nbsp;

Caitlin heard John go and felt like she
could breath again, despite the agony she was in.� She felt the clamps being removed from her
breasts and her arms being untied.� She
couldn�t help but scream as she was released from the blood rushing back to
each injured part of her body.� When she
was free of all her bonds, she tried to stand, but almost collapsed as she
tried to stretch her injured back.� She
felt gentle hands ease her to the bed and finally felt the blindfold being
removed.� It took a moment for her eyes
to be able to focus and take in the concerned face of Justin staring at
her.� She felt embarrassed at him seeing
her this way and tried to drop her head, but he held her head firmly so she had
to look at him. The look he gave her was too much and she burst into tears.
�Caitlin, shh, don�t cry. It is over.� 

&nbsp;

Justin wanted to hug her, but knew that
with her back the way it was, it would only cause her more pain.� He held out two painkillers and a glass of
water and watched as she swallowed each one.�
He then gently had her lie down on the bed and proceeded to clean her
back and bottom and apply an ointment to help ease some of her pain. He
shuddered to think of the countless times she must have suffered similar
injuries without any pain relief.� At the
thought he once again felt an overwhelming hatred for the man who had done
this.� He noticed that Caitlin had
stopped crying and was now just lying on the bed. �Slave, Caitlin, is there
anything else I can do to make you feel better?�� Caitlin heard the question and again could
not help but think how different her life, as a slave would be with a Master
like Justin or even Steve.� Though she
had been still treated like a slave and expected to obey any command given her
by the two men, she still felt that she had been treated like a person
too.� �No Sir, there is nothing else you
can do.� Thank you Sir.�� Justin was concerned by the listlessness in
her voice, but knew that it would take her some time to recover from the visit
from her Master.� He left when she fell
asleep and went into the lounge room, where both Steve and his slave were
sitting. He could sense a certain tension in the room, and wondered if it had
something to do with Lisa�s faint earlier.�


&nbsp;

Steve saw Justin come out of the room.� �How is she?� Justin looked up, a combination
of anger and frustration on his face.�
�Sore, he really gave her a fierce beating.� I have given her pain relief and applied the
ointment. She is sleeping now, but I can only imagine how she will feel when
she wakes up.�� �Maybe we might need to
keep her sedated for a while, at least until she gets some strength back.�� �Good idea, I will do that.� Justin turned to
look at Lisa, noticing that she was looking pale and that she had been
crying.� �Slave, how are you feeling now?
You gave me quite a scare, you know?�� �
Sorry Sir, I didn�t mean too, I�� Justine saw Lisa give Steve a look and then
put her head down.� He felt the tension
in the room again and wanted to know what was going on. �Steve, have I missed
something?� He saw Lisa tense up and start to cry softly. �Slave, go and get
Sir and myself a drink.� Lisa felt relief that he was not going to make her
tell Justin about Master John and walked with shaky legs over to the bar to
make the men their drinks. She still felt like she was walking in a dream, her
sense of reality not yet returned to her. She took her time over the drinks,
watching the men talking.

&nbsp;

�Lisa fainted when she heard John�s
voice.� She says that he is one of the
men who raped her.�� Justin listened with
shock as Steve told him about the news.�
He felt another wave of anger engulf him as he thought of all the harm
this man had done. �Is she sure?� �Yes, I asked her the same question and I am
convinced that she is telling the truth.�
I only had to see the fear in her eyes when she thought he might see her
to know that he was involved.� I�m sorry
I kept this from you until now, but I didn�t want to risk him taking Caitlin
early if anything happened.�� Justin
nodded, knowing that Steve had done the right thing. He knew that if he had
been told this news before John had gone, he didn�t know what he would have
done.� Just then Lisa returned with their
drinks.� 

&nbsp;

Lisa handed both the men their drinks and
knelt down on the carpet. She wasn�t sure how she should be feeling. When she
had heard that voice, she had felt like she was back in the van. She had been
starting to feel so much better and had stopped having nightmares even, and now
she felt like she was back to square one. 

&nbsp;

�Slave, your master has told me about you
recognising Master John�s voice.� I don�t
know what we will do yet, but know that we will both do what we can to have him
punished for what he did to you.�� Lisa
looked up and wondered yet again at the contrast of the two men.� On one hand, they could very strict,
expecting obedience at all times and on the other, they really did seem to care
about her. �Thank you sir, it was a great shock to hear that voice.�� Lisa had calmed down a lot, but was still
shaken at hearing that voice again. Suddenly, she thought of Caitlin. �Sir,
where is Caitlin? Is she ok?�� 

&nbsp;

Justin thought of Caitlin lying on the bed,
bright red welts covering much of her back and bottom. �Well, she is not too
good at the moment, but she will recover in a short while.�� Lisa decided to risk asking just one more
question, though she knew she was pushing her luck. �Master, may I see
her?� Now I know who her master is, I can
only imagine what he has done to her. Please Master, can I?� Lisa held her
breath, not knowing if she would be punished for speaking. Steve heard the
desperation in his slave�s voice, knowing that she had risked punishment by
asking her question. �Slave, I don�t remember giving you permission to speak!�
Lisa tensed when she heard this and braced herself for what might come.
�However, this is certainly what I could call special circumstances, so I will
allow it for this time.� Lisa sighed, pleased that she would not be
punished.� �I can understand that you
would be worried about Slave Caitlin and once I have checked on her, then I
will let you know if you can see her.� 

&nbsp;

Steve saw the disappointed look on Lisa�s
face, but as he had not yet seen what condition Caitlin was in, felt he was
right to make her wait. He went into the room and was shocked to see the state
that Caitlin had been left in.� Although
she had been given painkillers, she was still moaning softly.� He moved around to the top of the bed to see
if she was awake, and saw her looking at him. �Slave, I know you are hurting,
is there anything I can do to help you?��
Caitlin tried to focus on what he was saying through the pain.� Though the throbbing pain had eased, she
still felt an ache in her back and her bottom was sore both inside and
out.� �I am very thirsty, could I have a
drink please master?�� She saw him stand
and then come back with a glass of water.�
She tried to drink from the glass, but lying on her stomach made it
impossible.� She saw her Master rise
again and return, this time with a straw in the glass.� She felt an overwhelming urge to cry when she
saw this, for this simple act of kindness was something she was just not used
to anymore. 

&nbsp;

Steve saw the tears in the corner of her
eyes as he returned with the glass and the straw.� Watching her sip the water, he wondered what
kind of man found pleasure in causing the level of pain Caitlin was in. �There,
is that better?�� �Thank you master, you
are very kind to help me.�� With that,
Caitlin could hold back her tears no more, and began to cry with all her heart.
Steve watched as Caitlin�s abused body was wracked with sobs. He reached out to
stroke her hair, trying to ease her distress. Caitlin cried even harder as she
felt the hand stroking her hair.� She
felt so moved by the fact that both Master and Sir were so concerned for her
wellbeing. Eventually, she managed to calm down, and saw her master move a
chair over to sit beside the bed.

&nbsp;

�Slave, please do not be afraid to ask for
help. We are going to keep you in here for a few days, and will make sure that
you have pain relief when needed.� Now,
slave Lisa had asked if she would be able to see you, as she is very worried
about you. Are you up to seeing her now or would you rather wait until you are
a bit stronger?� Once again, Caitlin was struck with the fact that she was being
given a choice.� �Master, if it is you
wish, then I would like to see Lisa. Thank you for asking.�� Steve went to get Lisa and bring her in to
see Caitlin. He stopped just outside the door, knowing that he needed to
prepare her.� �Slave, I need to warn you
that Caitlin is in a bad way.� Her master
whipped her very badly and she is quite weak. Do you still want to see her
today?� Lisa did not really know what to expect, but knew that if she did not
see her now, she would only be awake tonight worrying about her. �Yes Master, I
need to see her.� Steve nodded, and was about to lead her into the room, when
he remembered he had not said anything to Caitlin about Lisa�s discovery
earlier. �Slave, I have not mentioned anything about what you told me about
Master John. I think that it would be best for now not to say anything�. Lisa
nodded, in a way relieved that she would not have to talk about her rape
again.� 

&nbsp;

Chapter Eight - Punished

&nbsp;

Lisa entered the room behind her master,
and froze in shock at what she saw. She could not believe that this was the
same woman she had been talking to not two hours ago.� She walked up to the head of the bed and
knelt down so she could see Caitlin�s face.�
One look was all it took before they were both crying.� She knew that Master Steve was still in the
room, but for a moment he was forgotten as she shared the pain her friend was
feeling.� She didn�t know how long she
knelt beside the bed, but when she felt a strong hand on her shoulder, she knew
she had to go.� 

&nbsp;

As Lisa went to stand up, she felt Caitlin
grab her hand and give it a light squeeze.�
In that moment both women knew that whatever happened, they would always
be together in spirit.� Lisa left the
room and was led back into the lounge room.�
She went to kneel down, but was led to sit on the lounge between her
Master and Justin.� �Slave, what are you
thinking?�� �Master, I am worried about
Caitlin.� I have never seen anyone with
marks like the ones she has. Will she really be alright?� 

&nbsp;

�Well, with care she will be heal, though I
am not sure if she will have any scars or not.�
The real danger with injuries like the ones she has suffered happen when
infection sets in. If we are careful, she will not get any infections.�� Lisa thought about this and what she had
heard Caitlin saying once about never getting any pain relief when she was with
Master John.� She couldn�t help but
shudder at the thought of the pain she must have suffered in the past.� 

&nbsp;

Both the men saw her shudder. �Slave, what
made you shudder just then?�� �Master, I
was just thinking about the pain that Caitlin has been through over the years
as Master John�s slave.�� Justin had been
thinking the same thing.� �Slave,� Justin
said, �I too have been thinking about her past.�
It saddens me too to think of what she has suffered.�� Although Lisa had learnt a lot about her two
trainers over the time she had been with them, she was still a little surprised
by Justin�s statement. She didn�t feel like either of the men would hurt her
like Caitlin�s master had, but she was still aware that they were holding her
against her will and that they were all part of the same world that Master John
belonged to.� 

&nbsp;

Steve watched Lisa�s face as she thought
about what Justin had said and could see that she was looking a bit confused.� �Slave, what is bothering you?� Did you not think that we would find
Caitlin�s past abuse upsetting?�� Lisa
looked at her Master, hearing a touch of anger in his voice.� She wondered how she could tell him what she
was thinking without angering him more.�
�Master, I know that you care about Caitlin.� I � I was just thinking how..��� Lisa paused, not knowing how to put into
words what she was feeling.� She felt a
hand rest on her thigh, and knew that she shouldn�t keep her master waiting for
too long. � Sorry master, I am just trying to work out how to tell you what I
was thinking. I was just thinking about the difference in how you both treat me
and the way Caitlin�s master treated her. Sir, I was a bit surprised that you
were so upset over the way Caitlin has been treated in the past. I am sorry
Sir, I did not mean to think badly of you, but I �� Lisa found her voice
trailing off as she knew that she was not really explaining herself
properly.� She found herself becoming
tense, wondering what the men were thinking.�


&nbsp;

Steve listened to what his slave was trying
to say, not really understanding her, but recognising her attempt at not
upsetting him.� He reached out to turn
her face to him, feeling her tense up as he touched her.� �Slave, I am not sure what you are trying to
say, but I hope that you are not meaning to show disrespect to your me or to
Sir. However, I do need to understand what you are trying to say�. He felt Lisa
relax in his grip and saw her frown slightly, obviously trying to sort out her
thoughts.� �Slave, I think you should
kneel so that we can both see you.�� 

&nbsp;

Lisa moved to kneel on the mat in front of
the couch, facing both of the men.� She
was very aware of both of the men waiting and watching her intently. She
wondered how she had got herself into this mess, but knew that she needed to
make her thoughts clear.� �Master, Sir, I
will try to express my thoughts better.�
I guess I am just trying to work out how you can associate with someone
like Master John.� I mean, he is such a
mean man and while I don�t think that you would do the same thing he did, you
are both holding me here against my will. I was also a bit surprised to hear
Sir express the same emotions I was feeling, I mean you live in this world all
the time, and I had just assumed that you would not feel the same about it as I
would. I guess I am just feeling confused about what has happened and am trying
to work out how this new world I have found myself in works. I really do not
mean any disrespect, please forgive your slave her doubts.�� Lisa stopped and looked down at the ground,
feeling unsure about what the men�s reactions would be.

&nbsp;

Justin looked at Steve as he stood to stand
in front of Lisa.� Justin could
understand what Lisa was saying, but thought that she might have overstepped
her bounds this time.� Steve was not
really upset with Lisa, understanding in a way what she was saying. However, he
was also aware that her training had to prepare her for her future as a slave,
so he had to teach her that not everyone would accept such comments from a
slave. �Slave, what makes you think that you have the right to question what a
master does or how they will react to a situation?�� He watched as Lisa�s face went pale and she
began to shake slightly.� �You need to
learn that as a slave you must show respect to those who are in charge of
you.� So, as your punishment, you will be
gagged and bound while you prepare tonight�s meal for us. Justin, would you get
me the big ball gag from the other room, you know the one I mean don�t
you?�� 

&nbsp;

Justin had to suppress a smile, as he went
to get the gag. He had to admit that it was not a bad punishment; it would
certainly make Lisa remember to hold her tongue next time, but would be over in
a short time also.� As he came back with
the gag, he saw Steve putting cuffs on each of Lisa�s wrists and connecting
each cuff with the length of chain.�
There was enough chain to allow movement, but it would still restrict
her in her cooking duties.� He had
already done the same thing to her ankles, meaning that she would have to take
little steps as she moved around the kitchen.�
He handed the gag to Steve, seeing Lisa�s eyes go wide as she saw the
size of the ball.� It really was very big
and one that they would only use on a girl for a short time.� He went to check on Caitlin, leaving Lisa
moaning as Steve inserted the gag.

&nbsp;

Lisa tried to stretch her mouth around the
massive ball gag that her master was trying to put into her mouth. She was sure
that it would not fit, but after a bit of pushing, the ball finally popped in
behind her teeth.� Even before the awful
thing had been done up, her jaw was already aching. She hoped that she would
not have to wear it for too long.� 

&nbsp;

Steve was relived when the gag finally
popped into place behind Lisa�s teeth. He knew that it had to be hurting but he
also knew that it would help her to know that she had to watch what she said in
the future. He knew that her new owner might not appreciate a slave being as
open as Lisa could be about her thoughts.�
He saw her struggle to get used to the gag and the tears that were
forming in her eyes. He didn�t know if they were from the pain of the gag or
because she was being punished.� He
turned her around and with a slap on the bottom, sent her off to prepare the
meal.� 

&nbsp;

Lisa tried not to think too much about the
gag as she went about getting the meal together.� It took her a bit longer to then usual, both
because of her chains and also because she did not have Caitlin to help her.� She thought back to the sessions she had had
with her and about how helpful and kind she had been.� Not only had she used the time to talk about
her rape, but she also was able to discuss her reactions to what was happening
to her during her training. She had been particularly helpful when she had to
have sex with her master for the first time. This had been only a few days ago,
and Lisa still was not quite used to it yet.�
She thought about that night as she prepared the meal.

&nbsp;

Lisa had known that eventually she would be
expected to have sex with her master, and though she had begun to be more
relaxed, she still did not know how she would react.� She been giving him blow jobs for the last
week and was becoming more used to this act.�
She had just been returned to her room after the evening meal and was
not surprised to be asked to kneel and satisfy her master with her mouth.� She had just started to work her head up and
down his cock when she felt his hand pull her head back to look at him.� She thought she had done something wrong and
expected him to instruct her on what she should be doing. However he said
nothing, just stood her up and moved her to lie on the bed. Lisa felt her heard
beat a thousand miles a minute as he removed all of his clothes and lay down on
the bed next to her. The next few minutes were almost a repeat of the first
night as he worked her up to one, then two orgasms. She had felt herself relax
as her orgasms wash over her, but suddenly she felt something new.� He had removed his fingers and had repositioned
himself so he was lying over her, his hands on the bed beside her head, holding
his body up over her. She closed her eyes, trying to stop the shaking that had
started.�� �Slave, I know that you are
scared. I will go slow and try not to hurt you, however you will have to try
and relax for me. Do you think you can do that?�� 

&nbsp;

Lisa had heard what he was saying but her
brain was having a hard time focusing on the words.� He had asked her a question and she knew she
had to answer. �Master, I don�t know, but I am trying. I know that you will not
hurt me, but I just have so many bad memories that I need to forget.� Please be patient with me.� Steve felt sorry
that he had to be the one to push her past this limit; but knew that with
little over three weeks left of training he had to.� If she were not able to meet the sexual
demands of her new master, then she would not survive.� He lowered his body until he was just
touching her, and moved to centre his cock in the opening of her pussy. He
heard her gasp as he did this and her body start to shake even more. 

&nbsp;

Lisa could feel the cock at the entrance to
her pussy and her mind began to replay the rape yet again.� Try as she might, she could not get the
images out of her head.� She knew that
this was different and that she would not be hurt, but she just could not seem
to relax. She tensed, waiting for the thrust she was certain was coming.� When it didn�t she wondered why and opened
her eyes.� She was confronted by two
concerned, dark eyes staring at her. �Relax, you have to relax, otherwise I
will hurt you without meaning to. Would it help if I spoke to you, would that
keep your mind on me better?�� Lisa
nodded, not knowing if it would help or not, but willing to try. �Master, I am
not sure but it has to be better to listen to you then the thoughts that are
going around in my head.�� 

&nbsp;

�Ok, now I am going to go as slow as I can,
but I want you to listen to my voice.� I
also want to tell me if I am hurting you, or you need to me to slow down for a
while.� We have all night, so we don�t
need to rush this.� As he was talking, he was slowing pushing himself into her
warm, moist pussy.� She was still wet
from her orgasms, but as he was quite big, he still needed to take it
slow.� He was glad that Caitlin had been
able to keep him satisfied over the last few weeks, as he had been able to
resist taking Lisa before now.� He
finally managed to work himself fully into her and stopped to let her become
used to the feel of him.

&nbsp;

Lisa felt him enter her bit by bit.� The sensation was so different and his voice
was so calming, that she found herself being able to relax some and ease her
shake down to just a slight tremor. She still had images of the rape in her
head, but they did not seem to as loud or as clear as they had been
before.� As he stayed still in her for a
moment, she heard him speaking to her. �How does that feel?� Are you ok?��
�Master, thank you for being so gentle with me.� You are not hurting me, though I feel very
full.�� Steve couldn�t help but smile at
her comment.� He had always been rather
proud of the size of his cock, a nice 9 inches long and about 3 inches
around.� He had also learnt that the
first time he fucked a girl, he needed to go slow and get her used to his
size.� �Good, you are doing very well.
Now I am going to start to move slowly and we will see how we go, Ok?�� � Yes master.� Steve felt her again tense up
a bit as he began to move within her, slowing pulling out until he was almost
out of her and then a slow push back in.�
While he was slowing fucking her, he used his mouth to gently nibble and
suck on her nipples. He heard her start to moan softly beneath him and hoped it
was in pleasure and not in fear.�� He
opened his eyes to see and met her eyes looking at him.� He could tell by her glazed expression that
she was starting to respond to him, so he began to go a bit faster.

&nbsp;

Lisa felt the movement quicken, and felt a
touch of fear, that was quickly replaced by something else, something she
couldn�t quite name.� She felt her breath
quicken as the familiar feeling of another orgasm started to build.� As her body surrendered, she felt his cock
grow larger and then the feeling of cum spurting into her.� She was glad that she was still in the throws
of her orgasm as he came, as it meant that her mind was not able to overpower
her with the memories of the other cocks that had cum in her body.

&nbsp;

Steve felt her orgasm only moments before
he came in her.� He was glad that she had
been able to achieve an orgasm, as it meant that she had been able to relax her
body and her mind.� He stayed where he was
until she slowly opened her eyes to look at him.� �Slave, you did very well and you even
managed to cum too.� How do you
feel?�� Lisa blushed a little as she
answered him. �I feel great master.�� She
really did feel great, like a weight had been lifted off her shoulders.� �Thank you for letting me know what sex
really feels like.�� Lisa felt him move
away from her, thinking that he would leave her now, but was surprised to find
he was just moving to lie beside her on the bed.�� He stayed with her all through the night,
using her body two more times before morning. Each time he fucked her a bit
harder, getting her more used to the type of sex that would be expected of
her.� 

&nbsp;

Lisa was deep in thought, when she felt a
hand touch her shoulder, making her jump.�
She turned to see her master, knowing that he had to be wondering why
she was blushing. �Slave, you seem to have been daydreaming and by the colour
of your cheeks, it must have been a good one. However, we are getting hungry
and want to know when dinner will be ready.��
Lisa, being unable to speak due to the massive ball gag in her mouth,
held up two fingers to indicate that the meal was almost ready.� She hoped that her little daydream would not
mean having to keep the gag in longer, as she didn�t know how much longer she
could stand it. She moved as fast as she could in her bound state to finish the
meals and put the plates onto the table for the two men. She did not serve up
her meal, as unless the gag was removed, she couldn�t eat it anyway. 

&nbsp;

Steve ate his meal, chatting to Justin, all
the while aware of his slave kneeling beside him begging him with her eyes to
remove the gag. He had almost reached down several times during the meal to
remove it, but knew that having her watch them eat, would reinforce her
punishment even more. Lisa waited, praying that he would have pity on her and
remove the gag.� She thought he was going
to do this a few times during the meal, but was disappointed each time he
resumed eating. Finally he was finished eating.�
�Slave, I hope you have learnt a valuable lesson tonight.� You are a slave and have to learn when to
speak. I will remove the gag and cuffs now, but know that if there is a repeat
of this behaviour, the gag will stay on all night. Is that understood?� Lisa
nodded and felt him reach around to undo the gag and pull it from her
mouth.� It was almost as hard to get out
as it was to get in, but finally her mouth was free.� She tried to close her jaw and almost cried
out at the pain she felt.� Once her hands
were free, she massaged her aching jaw and was able to close her mouth.� She knew her jaw would be sore for a while
and could imagine how it would feel after wearing it all night.� 

Chapter Nine � An Explanation

&nbsp;

After the meal, Steve left Justin to look
after Caitlin and took his slave into her room.�
Despite having had to punish her for her outburst earlier, he had been
thinking about what she had said.� He
decided that he needed to talk to her about what she had said. Once he entered
the room he sat in Lisa down on the bed, while he sat on the chair near the
bed.� �Slave, we need to talk about what
happened tonight.� Lisa felt a shudder go through her at her master�s words,
she had thought that he had finished his punishment, but maybe he was madder at
her then she thought. She sat looking down at her hands, which she noticed had
started to shake slightly. What she heard her master say next was such a
surprise that she could not help but gasp.�
�Slave, I do agree with what you said earlier.� Master John�s manner is certainly different
to the manner of Sir Justin or myself.� I
know that neither of us would wish a slave to suffer as he had made Caitlin
suffer.� I suppose it is true to say that
everyone is different and that is also true in the community in which we are a
part of.�� 

&nbsp;

Lisa listened to her master talking to her
and felt grateful that he was taking time to acknowledge what she had said
earlier.� She had not been sure what he
was thinking as he not really spoken to her after he removed the gag and cuffs.
�She had eaten her meal and cleaned up
while the two men had talked.� She had
felt frustrated that he was ignoring her comments and was beginning to think
that though he had already punished her, he was still angry with her.� 

&nbsp;

�I also know that today�s events must have
you wondering what could lie ahead for you.�
That is something I can�t answer for you.� I would like to tell you that your new master
will not be someone like Master John, but that is something I can�t do.� He saw
Lisa flinch as he said this, knowing that she would be terrified if she ended
up in the hands of someone like John. �However, I can say that I know of many
more who would be firm but not cruel.� As
to your comment that you were feeling confused about the way we could treat
you, I only hope that by now you know that Justin and I would never, ever treat
you as Caitlin was treated.� That doesn�t
mean that you may not have to suffer under the whip or satisfy us as we wish,
but know that we would never totally disregard your feelings.� Everything we do is to help you become the
best slave you can be and learn to enjoy your role as a slave.� Finally, yes you are being held here but I
hope that the experience has not been all bad for you.� Now, I would like to you to tell me what you
are thinking and before you ask, you will not be punished for what you might
say.� I had to punish you earlier, as not
every master or mistress will appreciate your candour, but it is just us know,
and I really need to know your thoughts.� 

&nbsp;

Lisa paused a moment before speaking, not
sure wether to tell him what she was really thinking or just what she thought
he wanted to hear. The thought of wearing the ball gag all night was making her
hesitate, even though he said she would not be punished.� She wanted to trust him, but the events of
today made her weary of what he could do.�


&nbsp;

Steve could see her hesitation and thought
he knew the reason behind it.� �Slave,
please believe me when I say that you will not be punished by answering me
honestly. I know I threatened you with the gag if you spoke out again, but this
is different.� The rest of our training
time together really does depend on how much you trust me.� If you are going to doubt me and my actions,
then I need to know.�� 

&nbsp;

Lisa again debated what to tell him and
realised that she was doubting him.� She
knew that despite the risk of future punishment, she had to clear the air and
tell him what she was really thinking.�
Taking a deep breath, she began to speak. �Master, you are right, I am
finding myself wondering if I will be punished again for telling you how I am
really feeling.� I hesitated, as the
thought of wearing that gag all night scared me. I am sorry, master, that I did
not trust your word. You have never lied to me and I forgot that for a
moment.�� Lisa paused, seeing if he
wanted to say something but when he remained silent, she continued. �Master, I
am very grateful that you have taken the time to talk to me tonight.� I must admit that I was feeling a bit lost when
you ignored me after you removed the gag.�
I guess I was hoping that you would talk to me then about what I had
said.� I also was starting to think that
maybe all masters were like Master John deep down and maybe that is why I
showed surprise at Sir�s comment. I definitely meant no disrespect and realise
now that the all the shocks of today must have altered by thinking for a short
time.� You and Sir have never treated me
cruelly.� I have felt fear at some of the
things you have wanted me to do, but you both have always tried to guide me through
that fear. In fact, in a strange way I have felt safer here than I have done in
last eight months, no longer having to look over my shoulder or wonder who
might be watching me. I have been given the help I needed to talk about my rape
and have been able to begin to believe that I will be able to leave it in my
past.� Master, I hope that you no longer
doubt my trust in you� Lisa stopped talking, realising that she had said a lot
more than she had intended.� 

&nbsp;

Steve was pleased to hear Lisa speaking
honestly to him.� He had worried that he
had frightened her too much with the threat of the gag.� There was always a fine line between
punishment and abuse and he had been worried he had pushed her too far.� 

He also knew how important good communion
was to a slave/master relationship.�
�Thank you slave for being honest with me. I am glad that we were able
to discuss what we were thinking. If I had felt that you were lying to me, I
wasn�t sure how the next few weeks training would have been.� It may sound strange to you, but by you
reacting honestly to each experience, we are better able to help you cope.� I know that we have pushed you hard and that
we will continue to push you over the rest of your time here, but it is all for
your own good.� I would not be a good
trainer if I did not send you out with the best possible training that I could
give you. Don�t you agree?�

&nbsp;

�Yes master, I do understand what you are
saying.� Though I am scared of what the
future holds for me when I must leave here, I can see that you are trying to
help me be a success.�� Lisa had only
recently begun to think beyond her training and start to worry about what might
happen to her.� If she was lucky enough
to get a master who treated her like she was treated here, than she knew she
could survive but if it was someone like Master John, than she really didn�t
know how she would cope. 

&nbsp;

Steve saw Lisa bite her bottom lip, meaning
that she was worrying about something. �Slave, you are still worried about
something, what is it?�� Lisa was once
again struck by how well he knew her, almost seeming to read her mind at times.
�Master, I was just thinking about how I would cope if my new master was
someone who was like Master John. I know that as a slave, I would have to do
whatever my new master says, but ��� she found herself unable to finish.� She felt her eyes start to fill with tears
and her lip tremble as she thought about what a terrible life it would be.� 

&nbsp;

Steve saw Lisa start to cry and could
almost taste her fear. Most girls he had trained had expressed some fear over
their future master or mistress, however none had faced the experiences that
Lisa had either before or after being captured.�
He usually took only a passing interest in where the slaves he had
trained went, preferring to concentrate on the next girl he had to train.� He occasionally saw one of his trained slaves
at parties, but often never saw them again.�
He knew, however, that this time it would be different. He was doing
what he had been told never to do, and that was to not get personally involved
with the girl he was training. He had never in all the years he had trained
girls broken this rule and had been able to quickly forget each girl as he
moved onto the next.� He didn�t think this
made him cold, only professional. Now he found himself in a situation he was
not sure how he would get out of, or even if he wanted to.� He pulled Lisa into a hug as she cried,
feeling her body shake with her sobs. Oh boy, he thought, I could really be in
trouble here.

&nbsp;

Chapter Ten � Reflections

&nbsp;

Meanwhile, Justin was thinking similar
things as he gently rubbed more ointment into Caitlin�s back and bottom.� He was pleased to see that a lot of the
swelling was starting to come down and that there was no sign of any infection
yet.� He knew, though, that it was still
early days, and that any of the cuts could still become infected.� He had given her more pain killers and could
see that she was sleeping.� He knew that
in the short time he had known Caitlin he had come to respect her as a doctor
and to care for her as a woman.� She had
done all that she could to please him. He knew that at first she had been acted
out of fear of punishment, and after what he had seen today, he could
understand that fear. However, he had been noticing a change in her lately, and
even if she had not been fully relaxed she had had moments when she seemed to
be free of worry or fear.� 

&nbsp;

He thought back to the first time he had
been with her.� It was a few days after
she had been with them, and Steve had agreed to let her spend the night with
him. He had led her to sit on the bed and could see a flicker of fear in her
eyes as she waited for him to do something. 

&nbsp;

Caitlin could sense that tonight Sir would
want more than just a blowjob and tried not to tense up while she waited on the
bed. She really didn�t think she had any need to fear what would happen, but
she found it hard to leave behind the fear she always felt when Master John
used her body.� He was a cruel man and in
all the time she had spent with him, she had never felt anything but pain after
he had finished with her. 

&nbsp;

�Slave, I am sure you have realised that I
want more from you tonight.� I can see
that you are looking scared, do you think I want to harm you?�� Caitlin looked up in surprise, not expecting
the concern she heard in his voice. In fact, she was so used to her feelings
being ignored, that she was shocked that Sir had even noticed her
nervousness.� �No sir, I don�t think you
intend to harm me, I am just feeling a bit nervous as I don�t know what you will
expect of me.�� Caitlin did not know if
she had said too much, thinking that if she had even thought of speaking to
Master John in this manner, he would send her flying across the room.�� He never wanted to hear what she was
thinking unless it was to express how much pain he was causing her.� 

&nbsp;

Justin bent down, so that he was at the
same level as Caitlin was, and took her hands in his.� As Caitlin felt him hold her hands, her first
impulse was to pull away from him but she managed to calm herself down and let
him hold her. Justin felt her brief resistance before she let her hands lay in
his. �Slave, I need you to relax.� He gently squeezed her hands and was pleased
when he felt her give a slight squeeze back.�
�I am going to tie you up but as this is the first time we will be
together, I won�t make it anything too extreme.�� He felt her tense up again when he mentioned
wanting to tie her up but she did not say anything.� �Slave, tell me what you are thinking?�� 

&nbsp;

Caitlin was not used to being asked to share
her feeling. �Sir, I will do my best to please you.� �Slave I am sure you will
but that is not what I asked you.� I want
to know your feelings.��� Caitlin tried
again, this time actually thought about what she was feeling before she
answered.� �Sorry sir, I am not used to
sharing my feelings.� I am just a bit
worried about how you might tie me up.��
Caitlin still did not tell him her real feelings, but this was still
more than she had ever told anyone before. 

&nbsp;

�Thank you slave, I want you to trust me. I
would like you to turn around on the bed and put your hands behind your
back.�� Caitlin did as she was told,
although she really hated being tied up. Unlike most of the girls chosen to be
trained, she was not really submissive.�
She had fought hard against her training when she was first captured,
but over time she had come to the conclusion that to fight was to get
hurt.� Once she was with Master John, she
knew that she could do nothing to stop him.�
If he wanted to hurt her, he hurt her.�
If he wanted to fuck her, he fucked her.�
Her life was no longer her own and she knew that she just had to accept
it. With a sigh, she turned and lifted her arms.� She waited for the pain of having her arms
tied, not sure if he would tie her as tightly as Master John did. She hoped
that he wouldn�t, but knew she had no control over what he might do.� She wondered what was taking him so long,
when she felt him touch her shoulder. She willed herself to remain calm,
knowing that whatever he might do could be no worse than what had been done to
her a hundred times over.

&nbsp;

Justin had stood watching her for a few
moments, her arms held out behind her, her head bowed down. He was trying to
work out what was so different about this slave.� He knew that she had been a slave for a while
and wondered if this was the difference he was sensing.� He had really only worked with new girls,
either in training or just finished.�
That meant that the girls were usually nervous and often eager to please
but because they were also selected because of their submissiveness, they were
often also discovering their true nature. This would lead to many girls being
curious about what was happening to them.�
He realised that this was missing, this feeling of wanting to be
dominated that so many of the girls he trained had come to recognise in
themselves.� He wondered if Caitlin had
ever felt this, remembering what Steve had told him about her capture. Justin
took her wrists in his hands and began to tie them securely but not too
tightly.� He moved the rope up to tie her
elbows, noting that her elbows were flexible enough to meet but not making them
join as he wanted her to be able to stay in the tie for a while. 

&nbsp;

Caitlin felt him begin to tie her wrists
and then her elbows.� She was relieved
when he did not make her elbows meet, knowing how painful that tie eventually
could become. She noted that unlike Master John, he was not tying her too
tightly, though she remembered he had said that he would not be too extreme
tonight.� Caitlin felt him begin to wind
more rope around her chest, looping around her body several times both above
and below her breasts.� She tested the
amount of movement that she had and was pleased to note that like her arms, the
rope was firm but not overly tight.� 

&nbsp;

Justin could feel her body trembling
slightly as he tied a piece of rope at the side of her breast, pulling the rope
above and below her breasts together.� He
repeated the same on the other side and then turned her around on the bed to
face him. He noticed that Caitlin had no expression on her face, just staring
out in front of her. He used another piece of rope between her breasts, making
what almost looked like a rope bra. He pulled that rope a bit tighter, wanting
to get some kind of response from her.

&nbsp;

Caitlin had managed to block out what he
was doing, until she felt him pull the rope tighter between her breasts.� She could not help but give a small groan and
looked to see him smiling at her.� �Slave,
I am glad that you are still with me. I like to hear some response to what I am
doing.�� Caitlin thought for a moment
that he was upset with her, but his smile showed her he wasn�t. She was used to
keeping her emotions to herself, knowing that Master John would use any
weakness against her. If he knew she did not like something or if it caused her
pain, he would make sure that he repeated it over and over again. 

&nbsp;

Justin had seen her reaction when he had
spoken to her and saw the flash of fear that had come into her eyes. He could
see that she was still looking at him now with some sign of life in her eyes,
though she was still far from an open book.�
He reached out to touch one of her nipples, again feeling a flinch as he
touched her.� He pinched her nipple,
feeling it grow harder beneath his fingers.�
He heard her make a small moan, not sure if she really meant it or
not.� He did the same to the other nipple
and heard a similar moan as before.� He
pinched harder; this time hearing what he knew was a real moan.� 

&nbsp;

Caitlin had thought that she should show
some reaction, after his comment.� She
thought she was sounding convincing, though his fingers on her nipples at first
really caused her no reaction.� When he
pinched her nipple harder, she realised her moan was real, and wondered if he
had noticed. She knew that she was risking pissing him off, but couldn�t think
of what else to do.� She didn�t know how
her remaining silent would make him react either.� 

&nbsp;

Justin pinched her other nipple harder
again, causing her to moan for real again.�
At least he now had a better idea of her pain level.� �Spread your legs for me slave.� Caitlin
opened her legs, spreading each foot to the side of the bed.� She felt him gently rub her pussy and slowly
work his fingers into her.� She hoped he
would continue to go slowly, as she was not very wet.� She often found that her fear kept her dry
but Master John had never worried about this, seeming to get pleasure out of
making her suffer as he fucked her.��
Though she was not feeling the same fear with Sir Justin, the uncomfortable
feeling of being tied up meant that she was still fairly dry. 

&nbsp;

Justin was surprised at how dry she was,
expecting to feel the wetness he usually felt when he was with a trainee
slave.� Most of the girls found that
their bodies reacted to the stimulation of being tied, either if their minds
didn�t.� However, this was
different.� He removed his hand and sat
back to look at Caitlin. Caitlin, realising that he had removed his hand and
was looking at her, started to shake. She did not know why he had stopped but
was starting to think he was not happy, and she would soon suffer because of
it.���� 

&nbsp;

�Slave, you really don�t want to do this,
do you?�� Caitlin wondered how she should
answer him. �Sir, I don�t know what you mean. I will do whatever you say.�� Justin knew that this was not what she was
really thinking.� �Slave, you know that
is not what I mean, I want to know what you are really feeling.�� Caitlin thought about what to say, was this a
trick or did he truly want to know. Thinking that she had nothing to loose, she
decided to tell him what he seemed to really want to hear. �Sir, you have
treated me very well but I really don�t like being tied up.� Caitlin paused,
thinking that if he were going to turn then this would be when it could
happen.� When he remained sitting quietly
she continued.� �I have learnt over the
years to endure it, knowing that to fight was useless.�� 

&nbsp;

Justin now understood why she had pretended
to like what he was doing. As she had said, she was simply enduring what he was
doing to her. �Slave, please stand up� Caitlin started to feel nervous at this
sudden change, wondering if she had said too much and he was going to punish
her.� Justin, sensing her fears, said,
�Slave I am not upset with you,� Once she was standing, he removed her ropes
and massaged her shoulders. He then led her through to a large bathroom,
beautifully decorated in blue and white.�
In one corner was a large spa bath and it was to this that she was
led.� 

&nbsp;

Caitlin relaxed when she saw the spa. �Do
you like spa baths?� I do, I often find
that they help me to relax and when I have to make a decision, this is where I
like to go.�� Caitlin had not had a spa
bath for a very long time and never in one a beautiful as this. �Sir, I have
not had a spa in a long time, but it does look very nice. Would you like me to
undress you, sir, so that you can enjoy your spa?� Caitlin had just assumed
that he would want her to bathe him.�
Master John never let her enjoy a bath, making her always use the
shower, and even that was timed so that she never got to relax.�� 

&nbsp;

�Yes that would be good, then we can both
take some time to relax before we return to the bedroom.�� Caitlin was not sure if he meant for them
both to use the spa and must have looked confused. �What is wrong, do you not
want to share the spa with me?� �Sir, I would love to share the spa with you. I
was just not sure if that is want you meant. I mean I never�.. Master John
wouldn�t let me�.� Caitlin found it hard to speak, dealing with emotions that
she had thought she had buried a long time ago.�


&nbsp;

She had become very good at blocking her
feelings, knowing that if she let herself think too much about what was
happening to her, she would drown.� She
knew this was not healthy, but it was the only way she could cope with the
constant abuse she suffered.� Now, this
man she had only known for a few days was threatening to unblock these
feelings.� 

&nbsp;

Justin watched as Caitlin fought not to
cry, not knowing why taking a simple bath would cause such a reaction.� He was not one of those masters who wanted
simple obedience from a slave.� He
actually preferred it when he knew if the girl liked something or not. This
would not usually stop him doing whatever he planned to do, but it did help him
to know how to make the experience a less traumatic one then it could have
been.� �Slave, I am not sure why you so
upset, or at least trying hard not to be so upset.� Please tell me.�� 

&nbsp;

�Sir, I �I, this is just not something I am
used to.� I have not been allowed to
bathe since, well before�.�� Justin began
to understand what was causing her reaction.�
�Do you mean to say that you have not been in a bath since before you
were trained?� �Yes sir, Master John does not like me to use the bath.�� At this, Caitlin found that she could no
longer contain her tears, and felt all the misery of the past three years wash
over her. She did not know it at the time, but she had actually crumbled onto
the floor and lay sobbing, before she was lifted and placed into the spa.� The soothing water was the first thing she
felt, followed by the feeling of strong arms around her waist.� She realised she was sitting in the spa, with
Sir sitting behind her. 

&nbsp;

Justin held her as her sobs slowed and then
finally eased.�� He had found himself
thinking about his years as a trainer, hoping that this was not the way the
girls he had trained felt. He had always felt that although the girls were
brought to him by force, that by the time they left, most would not go back to
their old lives if they had a choice.�
�Slave, relax and let the water soothe you. When you are ready, we will
talk about what just happened, but for now relax.� 

&nbsp;

Caitlin tried to do as Sir said, but after
so long not doing anything to please herself, found it hard. She was not sure
what had happened, how she had ended up in the spa. She wanted to ask, but had
been trained too well not to speak.� She
could feel Sir rubbing her back and shoulders, trying to relax her.� What it was doing, though, was making her
tense up again, ready for the next attack.�
Justin felt her tense up.� Finally
he stopped and turned her around so he could see her.� �Ok, so this is not really helping you, is
it?� I had hoped that a spa would relax
you enough so that we could both enjoy our time together.�� 

&nbsp;

Caitlin could not believe what she was
hearing. Enjoy our time together, that was what he had said.� For the first time in years, she felt herself
getting angry.� How could he think that
anything about her life was enjoyable.�
Justin saw the change in her, a spark came into her eyes that had not
been there before.� He did not know what
he had said had caused this reaction, but he liked it. At least now he might
really get to know what she thought. �Slave, you seem angry, tell me what have
I done to make you angry.� And don�t worry,
you can say what you feel without the threat of punishment.�� 

&nbsp;

Caitlin felt her anger build and spurred on
by what he had said, started to speak. �Enjoy out time together, that is what
you said. How do you think I could do that?��
I am a slave, I have no rights, I have no choice in what is done to
me.� I just do what I am told and hope
that I will make it through each day without too much pain or humiliation.� Even when I am allowed to treat a patient, I
have constant reminders of what I am. If I could, I would run from this so
called life and never look back. You have no idea how awful my life is.� You just get to order girls around, not
caring how they feel or what they really want to do.� I hate you all�.� Caitlin suddenly stopped; shocked at her
outburst.�� For a moment she had felt
like her old self but now she realised what she had said and didn�t know what
to do. Not since her early days of capture had she spoken like she just did,
and that had got her a severe punishment. She started to tremble, waiting for
the pain that she was sure was coming.� 

&nbsp;

Justin was shocked by the strength of her
emotions.� He knew now that she was not
meant to be a slave, that she had never feel any pleasure out of the life
chosen for her.� He saw her cower before
him, all of her anger gone, replaced again by fear. He reached out to grab her
hand, causing her to jump. �Sshh, it is ok.�
I am not angry with you. I just feel so sad that that is how you view
your life.� I don�t know how your master
treats you, but I promise while you are here, I will try to let you see another
side to being a slave.� I know you don�t
believe me, but will you let me try?�� 

� 

Caitlin could not believe that not only was
he not going to punish her, he was actually being very nice to her. �Sir,
please do not tell Master Steve or Master John what I just said. I don�t know
what came over me, I�m sorry Sir.� Caitlin knew that if Master John heard of
her outburst, she would be severely punished. She could hardly think for the
fear that he would find out.� �Slave, I
will keep this between us, if you wish, but I would like to tell Master Steve.
I just think that the more we know about you the better your time here with us
can be.�� �Thank you Sir, I should not
have said what I did. I will not do that again, I promise.�� �Slave, I will not tell your master, so long
as you try to relax for me.� Do you think
you can do that?� 

&nbsp;

Caitlin felt her fear lessen but was not
sure if she could relax as much as he wanted her to. �I will try but I don�t
know why you care so about what I think and feel Sir?� I am here as a slave to serve you and I will
do whatever you say. What I feel or think had never been considered
before.�� Justin was again shocked by
Caitlin�s comments. �Slave, I know that you will do what I tell you, but I have
always tried to communicate with my slaves.�
Without communication, I may as well have a blow up doll. You may not
believe this, but I have had girls thank me for training them and allowing them
to explore a part of themselves they never knew existed.�

&nbsp;

�Then call me a blow up doll, that is what
I feel like most of the time.� I do
believe that some people are naturally submissive and that some girls,
particularly young girls, would be more open to the training you provide.� However, I was not young or submissive. I did
not have someone like you to train me, wanting to communicate my feelings with
them. I had men forcing me to conform, making me do what I didn�t want to do,
beating any spirit out of me.� Until I
came here, that was my life and will continue to be my life, once I leave
here.� I can�t begin to think there might
be hope of a better life.� I can�t, it is
just too hard.�� 

&nbsp;



It was at this
point, that Justin started to make plans for getting her away from her
master.� He knew that what ever else he
did in his life, this was one of the most important things he would ever
do.� Later that night he had brought
Caitlin back to his room and he continued where he had left off earlier, minus
the ropes.� As he stood, looking at her
lying in pain on the bed, he knew more then ever that he had to get her away
from John. He just had to work out how.

&nbsp;

Chapter Eleven
� The Challenge begins

&nbsp;

A week later,
Caitlin was up and about, though still feeling quite sore.� Due to Justin�s care, there had been no
infection.� Lisa�s training had continued
over the week, without her usual sessions with Caitlin and also without
Justin.� Steve had enjoyed the chance to
spend the time alone with Lisa, not having spent anywhere near as much time
with her before as he normally spent with the girl he was training.� He thought Lisa was coming along quite well.
She had been shaken up by what had happened to Caitlin and the discovery of
John�s part in her rape, but had managed to settle down as the week went on.
Now Steve was at one of the toughest parts of the training process.� To ensure that a new slave would be able to
satisfy the needs of their new owner, he had to know how much they could
take.� This meant the slave had to survive
for a length of time in quite severe bondage.�
The longer the girl could cope and the more extreme bondage she could
stand, the more money they could ask for her.

&nbsp;

With everything
that had gone on over the last month, he knew that he was behind in her
training, though she was doing very well.�
He had done some simple bondage with her and she was comfortable now
with him using her body, though she had not been with anyone else.� He knew that the next few days would be a big
test for her.� Lisa could see that Master
Steve had something serious to tell her by the look on his face. She had come
to be able to read him much better but he still left her wondering at
times.� She lay on the bed, waiting for
him to release her from her bonds.� She
had begun to be able to wear them again about two weeks ago, her dreams having
first eased and then stopped.� The only
night she had dreamed again of her rape was the night Master John had been here
and Master Steve had stayed with her all night.�
When she had woken, screaming, he had calmed her until she went back to
sleep again.� 

&nbsp;

Steve thought
how beautiful she looked as she laid waiting for him. She was no longer wary of
him and actually seemed pleased to see him each morning. He went to untie her
but paused, knowing he had to prepare her for what was coming. �Slave, how are
you today? Did you sleep well?� �Yes thank you Master, I slept very well. Not
one bad dream. Do you sleep well Master?��
Steve had not really slept well, thinking about what he would do today,
wondering how far he could push her and still keep her going. �Slave, I need to
tell you something about what will happen over the next few days.� Lisa felt a
surge of fear at his words.� She had
become used to the routine of her training and wondered what was happening to
change that.� �You have done very well in
your training so far, despite the challenges you have had to face.� Over the next few days, you will face one of
your biggest challenges so far.� I need
to push your limits and see how much you can take. I am sure that you will hate
me before we are done.� I will not cause
you any permanent damage but I will cause you pain.� I do promise though, that I will also give
you pleasure when I can.� You will have
to trust me to know what you can take and go with it.�� He watched her face as he talked, seeing the
fear but also seeing a look of determination.�
� Right now, you will have your shower and eat a light breakfast.� I will be back in around half an hour and we
will begin, OK�� 

&nbsp;

Lisa was scared
by what he had said but also felt a need to prove to herself that she could
survive whatever he had in mind for her.�
She quickly had a shower and ate the food left on the table for
her.� It seemed like no time until he was
back to collect her.� �Slave, are you
ready?� �Yes master�.� He led her down
the hall to a room that she had not been in before.� It was filled with a number of strange
looking items, some she could recognise and others she had never seen
before.� On the wall were all kinds of
bandage gear, many of which she had been introduced to already. She knew that
she should be scared but felt a strange feeling of calm come over her.� Steve could feel her calmness and was
relieved. It was always a good sign when girl could calmly face what lay ahead
of her. �Slave, this is where you will spend much of the next few days.� You will be shown little mercy but remember
Justin and I will never be too far away.�
When we are certain that you can take no more, we will help you. Are you
ready to begin?� Lisa nodded and said, �Yes master, I am ready.�

&nbsp;

Lisa felt a
blindfold being placed over her eyes.�
Once this was in place, she was led over to her right, stopping when her
legs felt the end of the object in front of her. She was turned around and felt
her arms and then her legs being secured to the object. She was now forming an
X with her arms and legs spread wide.�
She felt her master pinching her nipples and gasped as he attached
something to each one.� She waited for
more and was startled when he spoke to her. �Slave, I need you to stay in this
position for as long as you can.� Right
now it might seem easy, but over the hours your arms and legs will start to
burn.� To add to your pain, your body
will be whipped or new toys added to keep things interesting. I know that you
will not let me down.� 

&nbsp;

Lisa was just
beginning to wonder what he was doing, when she felt a sting across the top of
her breasts. She did not even have time to react when she felt the same sting
across the bottom of her breasts. Her master continued to strike her across her
breasts, stomach and thighs until she was screaming. �She did not know how long he hit her for but
by the time he was finished, she was burning all down her front.� What she also noticed was a feeling in her
pussy she had never had before.� She
gasped as her master rubbed his fingers into her, delving deep into her pussy
before pulling his hand out and walking out of the room.� Lisa wanted to scream, not from the pain but
from the way he had left her.� She knew
now that it was not just the pain she would be fighting but also the need for
sexual release.

&nbsp;

Steve had had
to force himself to leave the room when he did.�
He had been pleased with the way she took the strap and by the feel of
her pussy; she had certainly had a positive reaction as well.� He remembered how she had managed not to
scream until he had laid at least six or seven strikes across her body.� He would now leave her alone for at least an
hour and then return to torment her more. He had also arranged for Justin to
assist him, so that between the two of them they could keep her going for a
while. �He went into the lounge to
monitor her while he waited for the time to return to her.

&nbsp;

Lisa felt had
felt the ache in her arms first. She did not really feel much pain from where
he had hit her anymore and her nipples were just numb. She had tried counting
to keep a track of the time and thought that it had been about an hour since
her master had left her.� She was
beginning to wonder how long it would be until he returned, when she heard
footsteps approaching her.� A hand ran
across her breasts and continued down her body, stopping when it reached her
pussy. He rubbed her like before and she was surprised to feel that she was
still wet though not quite as much as before.

&nbsp;

Steve felt her
wetness and was pleased.� �Slave, I see
that you are not suffering too much yet.�
We will have to see if we can change that.�� He removed the clamps from her nipples,
knowing that the rush of blood back to her nipples would hurt more than the
clamps had.� He heard her intake of
breath and then her moans as the blood rushed back.� 

&nbsp;

Lisa had only
worn clamps for a short time and had not expected the sudden rush of pain that
the removal of the clamps caused. She moaned as he rubbed each nipple.� She was still recovering when she felt a rope
being wound around her waist. She wondered what he was doing as she felt a rope
being pulled up between her legs, going between her moist pussy lips.� When she felt the rope being pulled tighter,
she gasped and hoped it would not go much tighter.� With another tug, she felt her lower body being
pulled forward and the rope pull even tighter. Steve tied the end of the rope
to a ring in the wall to keep the rope tight. Lisa breathed slowing, trying to
come to grips with the pain in her pussy.�


&nbsp;

Steve saw the
way the rope bit into her pussy, knowing that she had to be feeling intense
pain. She was taking deep breaths, though she was not making much sound.� He knew she trying to cope with the pain and
hoped she could cope for a lot longer yet. He stoked her cheek, feeling her
turn her face to the direction of her hand. �Slave, you look beautiful.� You are doing very well.� 

&nbsp;

Lisa heard his
words and felt strangely pleased at his compliment.� She struggled to find a comfortable spot but
soon realised that moving only caused her more pain. She tried to count again
to mark the time, but found herself distracted by the waves of pain radiating
from her pussy.� By the time she heard
the footsteps she was crying softly with the pain. She was still crying after
the rope had been removed and she felt a cup being raised to her lips. She
drank the water slowing, still trying to stop her tears. 

&nbsp;

Steve had seen
her start to cry as the pain became too much.�
He knew that the rope was causing her great pain but also knew that it
would not cause her any serious injury.�
However, he did not leave her as long as before, returning in just over
30 minutes to remove the rope and give her some water.� He then untied her from the cross and gently rubbed
her arms and legs, allowing the circulation to flow. After a few minutes, he
led her over to the middle of the room and forced her to kneel. 

Lisa felt him
rub her arms and legs, helping her to get some feeling back into her limbs. She
was glad that he did not rub her sore pussy like he had done before, though she
was still very wet. When he forced her to knell she thought he wanted a
blowjob, so was a bit surprised when she felt him force her to bend forward at
the waist. She felt a hard surface under her and her arms pulled down in front
of her body and fastened to floor.� Something
was then pulled onto the top of her wrists, locking them in place. Once her
arms were secure, her legs were spread wide and cuffs were placed around each
ankle. When he let go of her, she found that she could not close her legs
anymore.

&nbsp;

Steve stood up,
looking at the sight of his beautiful slave with her arms locked in placed and
her legs spread wide with a spreader bar.�
He picked up the flogger and ran it gently over her bottom.� He saw her flinch from surprise and then
tense up, waiting for what was to come. He let her stew for a moment before he
began to hit her, knowing that the anticipation would only increase her
torment.� When he thought she had waited
long enough, he began to hit her with a steady rhythm, increasing the strength
of each strike until she was screaming and begging him to stop.� He continued until his arm was sore and her
bottom was a bright red.� By now she was
sobbing and gasping at the same time, trying to catch her breath and deal with
the pain.� Not saying a word, he left the
room.

&nbsp;

Lisa had never
felt pain like she had when he hit her bottom. He had hit her there before but
never so hard or for so long.� She had
begged him to stop but he had only hit her harder.� By the time he had finished, she was sure
that her bottom was on fire and that it must be bleeding.� She was barely aware of him leaving the room
and it was not until she had stopped crying that she realised she was alone
again. It was then too that she began aware of a throbbing in her pussy and
wondered how amid so much pain she could feel so turned on.

&nbsp;

Steve had
really had to force himself not to drop the flogger and take her on the spot,
but knew that he needed to stick to his plan.�
He knew that the longer he left her alone the more she would crave the
sexual release she would need.� He made
his way into the lounge area again, eating some lunch as he watched his
beautiful slave on the screen. Justin entered the room with Caitlin, the later
kneeling on the floor in front of the chair Justin had sat down in.� Steve had noticed the growing relationship
between the two, and knew that he would have to have a talk to Justin some time
soon. They would have to work out what to do about John and what they now knew
about him. Right now though, he needed Justin for another reason.

&nbsp;

Chapter Twelve
� The Panic

&nbsp;

Lisa heard the
door open and strained to hear the sound of footsteps. She jumped as she felt a
hand on her chin as her head was raised slightly.� She waited for what would come, as the hand
continued to hold her head up.� When she
felt a cock placed at her mouth, she simply opened her mouth and let it slip
right in till the head hit the back of her throat. She had improved greatly
over her training and did not even gag as he worked his cock in and out of her
throat.� She was caught up in the moment
when she a hand touched her pussy.� She
wondered briefly how he could reach her there, when she felt the unmistakable
feel of another cock sitting at the entrance to her pussy. 

&nbsp;

Justin had felt
how wet Lisa was before he moved his cock to her moist entrance.� He had been waiting for the time when Steve
would let him have her in this way.� He
had understand why he had wanted him to wait, though he was still not sure how
she would react to this current situation. Steve had asked him at lunch to join
him as he pushed her past yet another limit.�
Lisa froze when she felt the other man at her entrance, her mind
slipping back to the only other time she had felt two cocks use her body, when
she had been raped.� She struggled in her
bonds, breathing deeply as she felt the cock move out of her mouth.� 
She went to scream as she felt the cock drive deeply into her pussy, not
stopping until it hit her cervix. A hand being held firmly over her mouth cut
off her scream. She started to panic and struggled even more, trying
desperately to escape.� She was back in
the van, being raped over and over.� She
was no longer aware of anything else other then the cock raping her and the
hand over her mouth. She did not even realise that her blindfold had been
removed or that she was looking into the eyes of her master. It was not until
she heard the voice, one that she had heard many times before, that she started
to remember where she really was and what she was doing here. 

&nbsp;

Steve had not
been sure how she would respond to this new situation, knowing that it was very
close to how she had been bound and raped.�
He knew that he had to force her into confronting her feelings now,
rather then risk her freaking out when she was with her new owner.� He was not surprised to feel her freeze when
she became aware of Justin and was ready to stifle her scream.� He had warned Justin of her possible
resistance, but had insisted that he not stop.�
He saw that he was now indeed pounding into her, forcing her body to move
forward with each of his thrusts.� He
used his other hand to remove her blindfold, knowing that she was not really
seeing him yet. �Slave, it is ok. You are save. You are not in any danger.� Relax, relax.�� He watched her eyes as he spoke, seeing the recognition
slowing come back into her eyes.� He
continued to speak to her until he thought she was able to know where she
was.� 

&nbsp;

Justin felt his
cock grow as he savoured the feeling of her tight passage on his cock.� He was reminded of her youth and her lack of
previous experience. He was aware of Steve talking to her, telling her to calm
down. He knew that she was not really aware of who was fucking her and he hoped
that he would be able to spend more time with her in more calming
circumstances.� 

&nbsp;

Lisa jerked as
she felt the cock cum in her, thrusting deeply as he came. She still felt a bit
strange, but at least she now knew where she was.� Master Steve still held his hand over her
mouth, but his grip had lessened.� When
the cock was removed from her, he removed his hand and freed her hands.� She felt him hold her upper body still, as he
signalled for the spreader bar to be removed from her ankles.� Lisa then felt both pairs of hands help her
to stand, her legs aching as she moved from her spread, kneeling position for
the first time in over an hour.� She did
not want to face the two men after her performance earlier so kept her head
down as she was moved to sit on a couch at the side of the room.� 

&nbsp;

Steve could
tell that Lisa just wanted to forget what had just happened, but he knew that
it was important that they talk about it. Caitlin had prepared a light salad
for her and she sat drinking water and eating while the men sat in
silence.� He could tell that she was chewing
her food very slowly, wanting to delay the discussion she knew must be
coming.� Finally she had finished and sat
still with her head down.� �Slave, now
that you have had a chance to recover a bit, we need to talk about what
happened.� It was obvious that you were
not with us for a while back there. Tell us what you were feeling.�

&nbsp;

�Master, Sir, I
think I panicked when I felt you both using me, it was just so much like my
rape, that I could not help myself.� Sir,
please do not think that it was you I was reacting to.� I just forgot where I really was for a
while�.� Lisa still had not looked up and
was not surprised when her master told her to do just that.� �Slave, we of course understand the reason
for your reaction. What we need to do is to work to eliminate that reaction in
the future.� We will have to try it again
to see if we can wipe out the old images and replace them with new ones. Do you
understand?� Lisa had thought that he might say something like that, so was not
really surprised. �Yes Master, I understand.� �Good, now I just need to go
check on Caitlin for a moment.� Justin,
can you let Lisa go to the bathroom and then set her again the same way as she
was before?� 

&nbsp;

Justin knew
that Steve was giving him the chance to talk to Lisa and told him that he would
do as asked. When Steve had left the room, he noticed that Lisa was again
sitting with her head down.� He moved her
head up to look at him.� �Slave, I know
that I took you by surprise before but I wanted you to know that I have looked
forward to this day since I first saw you.��
He saw her blush at his words.�
�You are very beautiful, even more so with your nicely red butt and
marked body.� I hope that we will be able
to spend some time together after your tests here are over. Would you like
that?�

&nbsp;

Lisa had known
that she would have to spend more time with Justin some time before her
training was over, and had been dreading the first time he used more than her
mouth.� It was not that she was scared of
him, but it was still so awkward.� In one
way she had been spared that by what had happened. �Sir, you know this is all
still very hard for me, but if I have to submit to a man, then I would be glad
to submit to someone like you.�� Justin
was pleased with her answer, understanding how far she had come in her time
here. �Thank you slave, I will have to talk to your master to arrange a time
for us to get to know each better.� Now,
I had better get you ready for round two. Bathroom first, you have two minutes.
Go!�� He saw her rush off to go to the
bathroom and come dashing back into the room just under her set time.� By the time he had her ready, Steve had
returned. 

&nbsp;

The rest of the
afternoon was spent with the two men using her body, sometimes separately,
sometimes together. Lisa did not have a panic attack like before, though at
first had to fight to remain calm as the men used her even more fiercely.� However, by the time the afternoon was almost
over, she found that she no longer thought about her rape, only what these two
men were managing to do to her time and time again. She had lost count of the
number of times she had cum.� She was
exhausted by the time she was finally unbound and allowed to have a
shower.� After a quick meal she was
allowed to sleep. As she drifted of to sleep she heard her master say that she
would need all her strength for the day to come.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Steve sat with
Justin after their meal, watching Caitlin wash the dishes in the kitchen.� He was thinking back on the events of the
day, feeling pleased that Lisa seemed to have made huge progress.� He had been worried when she had her panic
attack earlier in the day but these lessened and finally vanished as the day
went on. �She did well, didn�t she?��
Steve looked at Justin, knowing that he was thinking the same thing he
had been thinking. �I am very pleased with her progress.� I wonder how she will go tomorrow?�� For the next half hour the two men discussed
what they would need to prepare for the next day.� 

&nbsp;

Caitlin could
hear the men talking as she did the dishes.�
She was pleased to hear that Lisa seemed to be coping; she knew how
challenging this part of the training could be.�
She could still remember everything that had been done to her during her
training, though she knew that while Lisa would be pushed to her limits, that
she would not deliberately injured.� She
started as she felt a hand on her shoulder but relaxed as she remembered where
she was.� She turned to see Sir standing
in front of her with a look she was coming to know very well.� Caitlin felt a tingle in her stomach, not of
fear but of anticipation.� She knew that
she was allowing her feelings to take over her, something she had tried not to
do for the last three years.� Despite
knowing that these feelings would be for nothing when she had to return to
Master John, she found herself looking forward to their time together, even to
allowing him to tie her up.� 

&nbsp;

Justin saw the
calm look in Caitlin�s eyes and was pleased that she showed no fear of him
anymore.� Since her visit from Master
John, he had felt himself grow even closer to Caitlin. Watching her cope with
her pain as she recovered showed him how courageous she was.� He knew that the day would come when he would
have to give her back but for now he only had one thought on his mind � how
quickly could he get her into his bedroom!

�
Chapter Thirteen � The Challenge continues

&nbsp;

Lisa woke
slowly, her body feeling stiff after the events of the day before.� She wondered what was in store for her today.
She felt a jolt of fear, hoping that she would be able to cope with whatever
her Master demanded of her. She let her mind dwell over what she had been able
to achieve yesterday.� She did not know
if she would suffer panic attacks in the future with a new master but she was
pleased that she had been able to calm herself enough to start to enjoy what
Master and Sir were doing to her.� She
felt herself blush as she thought of the way her body had reacted to the two
men.� She had lost count of the number of
orgasms she had achieved.

&nbsp;

�Well, I see
that you are awake.� How do you feel this
morning?�� Lisa jumped as she heard the
sound of her Master�s voice. She had been so deep in thought; she had not heard
him come in.� She hoped she did not look
a red as she felt. �I feel fine Master, just a bit stiff.�� Steve had noticed her flushed face and
couldn�t help but comment on it. � I see that you have been having a good
dream, is that true Slave?�� Lisa blushed
an even deeper shade of red at his comments. �Master, I ..I was thinking about
�well you and Sir.�� Lisa found she
couldn�t finish and hoped he wouldn�t make her.�
She looked up to see an amused look on her Master�s face.� �Slave, we will have to work on your
communication skills but I think I know what you are trying to say.� You certainly were a sight to behold
yesterday. I was very proud of you.��
Lisa felt a warmth spread through her as she heard her Master�s
words.� She knew it was a strange thing
to feel proud of but after all she had been through she felt she deserved
it.� 

&nbsp;

Steve released
Lisa from the bed and helped her to stand.�
He heard her moan and knew that not only was she stiff from being tied
all night but also from the day before.�
He gently led her into the bathroom and allowed her to shower.� Lisa felt the spray of the water ease the
pain in her body.� She stretched as best
she could in the shower stall and by the time she had finished her shower, she
was feeling much better.� 

&nbsp;

An hour later,
the only way Lisa could describe the way she was feeling was agony. She was
bent into an extremely tight hogtie, her back curved into an unnatural
arch.� Her back hurt, as did her neck
that was pulled back by the rope that had been tied into her hair.� This rope had then been tied to the rope
holding her ankles together.� Her nipples
were also in pain, as a rope had been tied around each one and the rope pulled
taut to rings in the wall.� She tried
hard not to move, as each movement caused the roped to pull, but this was not
easy as the vibrator that had been placed in her pussy buzzed continuously.� Lisa was aware of her Master sitting in the
chair in the corner. Unlike the day before, he had not left after he had tied
her but had sat and watched her. 

&nbsp;

Steve could see
that Lisa was hurting, but needed her to stay in her current tie for as long as
possible.� He had given her a safe word,
but also told her that using it would cause her to be punished more. He knew
that this defeated the purpose of the safe word but he really needed her to
push herself over her limits.� He would
release her when he felt she could take no more, which by the level of moans
and tears would not be too much longer.� 

&nbsp;

Lisa longed to
say her safe word, but knew that to do this would not only mean that she had
failed that test set for her but also cause her more punishment.� She hoped that she would be allowed to be
released soon.� She tried to turn her
head to look at her Master, but only succeeded in causing herself more pain as
her nipples were pulled on the ropes.�
She breathed in deeply, trying to ease the pain and sensed her Master in
front of her. 

&nbsp;

Steve took
Lisa�s chin in his hand and looked into her pain filled eyes. �Slave, you are
doing very well. I know you are hurting and I will release you very soon. You
just need to hold on for a little bit longer. Can you do that for me?�� Lisa nodded, though she really did not know
how much longer she could hold on for.�
�Slave, I need to hear your answer.� �Yes Master, I will try.�� Lisa felt like she was talking under water,
her mind so clogged with the pain.� She
took deep breaths, trying to block out the pain as she waited to be released.

&nbsp;

Steve saw her
try to deal with her pain and was impressed with her toughness.� He had put many girls into this tie before
and not many had lasted as long as Lisa had.�
However, he knew that she was a her breaking point and that it was time
to untie her. By the time she was free of all of the ropes, Lisa lay on the
ground feeling only relief that for now the pain was mostly gone. 

&nbsp;

The rest of the
day continued in a similar way.� Lisa was
tied in a number of extreme ties, each one pushing her to her limits and
beyond.� She was allowed some release
through the use of vibrators but was not given the human contact she longed for
from her Master.� By the end of the day
she was again given a light meal and fell into a deep sleep the moment her head
hit her pillow.� 

&nbsp;

Chapter
Fourteen � Feelings

&nbsp;

Steve sat back
onto the couch, deep in thought about the day�s events. He had been extremely
impressed by Lisa�s endurance and knew that she was well on her way to meeting
the criteria set for new slaves.� He
should be happy that she would be another successfully trained slave but he
felt a certain sadness at the thought of another man or woman owning her.� He had never felt anything like this for any
slave he had trained.� He knew that at
the beginning of her training it had been a challenge to see if she could be
trained, but now it was more than that.�
Justin sitting himself down on the couch next to him interrupted his
thoughts. �How did she do?� Steve looked up at Justin, surprised that he had
not heard him sit down. �She did very well.�
I really pushed her and she took it.��
Justin listened to what Steve was saying but wondered why his words did
not match the tone of his voice. �For someone who should be pleased you don�t
sound like you are.� What�s wrong? Are
you worried that she still won�t make the grade� �No, she will pass with flying
colours, I guess I am just not quite ready to let her go.� I don�t know why, I have never had this way
before. I suppose it because of all the extra challenges I had to meet this
time.�

&nbsp;

Justin could
not believe that Steve thought he was feeling the way he was because of extra
challenges. �Steve, I am sure you really know why you don�t want to let Lisa
go. I mean, it is obvious that Lisa has become very special to you.� Could it be that you feel more for her then
just another girl you have to train?��
Steve considered what Justin was saying but was not sure he wanted to
admit the truth to himself. �I guess I have become somewhat attached to Lisa
but I am sure it is just a passing thing.�
When I have a new girl here looking at me with those frightened eyes
they all have at first, then I am sure I will have forgotten all about
her.�� Justin knew that Steve was fooling
himself but didn�t push it.� He just
hoped that when the time came for Steve to let Lisa go, he had sorted out his
feelings.� �Steve, while we are talking
about our feelings, I am sure that you have noticed how I feel about
Caitlin.� I have been trying to work out
what to do about John.� I just don�t
think I could bear the thought of her going back to him.� I want to keep her with me, to show her that
her life does not have to be a misery.��
Steve had known that Justin was becoming very attached to Caitlin but
had not realised that depth of his feelings. �Justin, I too want to make John
pay for what he has done to both Caitlin and to Lisa. I have been trying to
think of what to do and have one plan that might work.� I have a friend who is a private detective
and is also aware of what I do, so I have been thinking that he could watch
John on the chance that he might grab another girl. I know it is a long shot,
but it is the only thing I can think of. What do you think?�� 

&nbsp;

�I suppose it
is worth trying. Maybe we could get lucky.�
How long until we have to let Caitlin go back to him?�� Steve considered the question. �I really
should have her back in about two weeks, but I may be able to stretch it out
another week. Still that is not a lot of time.��
�Well, give your friend a call and see if he can help. At least it will
feel like we are doing something to help.� As Steve left to make the call,
Justin wondered if it would make any difference.� He was beginning to think he should just take
off with Caitlin, but that would not help the other girls he might hurt in the
future. It would also leave Steve in trouble and he didn�t want that.� �Ok, that is set.� Mike will keep a watch on John over the next
few weeks and if he sees any suspicious behaviour he will contact the
police.� Let�s just hope he does
something stupid and we can get him.�

&nbsp;

Chapter Fifteen
� The Plan

&nbsp;

Steve hung up
the phone, disappointment showing on his face.�
He had just spoken to Mike and found out that he had nothing yet to
report on John. It had been ten days and he knew that the time was getting away
from him.� He had managed to get some
extra training days but that still only gave him another week until John
expected Caitlin to return to him.�
�Steve, was that Mike?�� Justin
had just walked in as he hung up the phone.�
�Yeah, but still no joy.� I have a
feeling that this is not going to work.��


&nbsp;

Lisa and
Caitlin were in the kitchen making the evening meal and overheard the
conversation.� Though they had not been
told directly what was happening, they had overheard enough to guess that
someone was watching Master John.� Lisa
assumed they were trying to catch him raping another girl and knew that the
changes of that were slim.� She knew she
had to do something to help Caitlin and thought that now she was strong enough.
She just had to convince her Master and Sir to let her try.

She took a deep
breath and walked into the room where the two men were talking. Steve became
aware of Lisa entering the room and wondered what she was doing.� He could see that the meal was not yet ready
and that Caitlin was looking puzzled as well at what Lisa was doing.� �Slave, what are you doing?� You know you are not allowed to be here at
this time.�� Lisa entered further into
the room and knelt down in front of her Master.�
�Master, I can help you.� I can
get Master John to admit what he did to me. Please let me try.� I owe Caitlin so much and can�t stand the
thought of letting him hurt her again.��
Lisa stayed still, waiting for some response. She felt a hand curl into
her hair and head lifted up to look her Master in the eyes. �How did you know
that we were trying to get Master John?��
Lisa knew that she would have to admit to listening to his private
conversation. �Master, I heard you talk to Sir. I know I should not have been
listening to you but when I heard you mention Master John, well I wanted to
know what you were saying. I �m sorry Master.��
Steve considered whether he should react to her confession but was more
interested in what she had said. �Slave we will discuss what punishment you
deserve for listening to private conversations later. Now stand up and tell me
how you think you can help me.�� Lisa
stood up, a little shaky at what she was about to offer to do.� She let her Master lead her to sit on the
couch, aware of Sir Justin sitting in the chair near by.� 

&nbsp;

�Ok, I am
waiting.�� �Master, Sir, I am aware that
you are trying to catch Master John but I am aware that your plan might not
work.� Let me be the bait to catch
him.� If you can get him to confess to what
he did, then maybe you can get the tape to the police or something.�� Lisa was feeling uncomfortable under the gaze
of the two men. �Slave, it is too risky.�
Last time just hearing the man�s voice was too much. How do you think
you would be able to be in the same room as him. And even if you could face
him, what would you say. �I hate to sound
negative, but he may not even remember you.� Lisa knew that everything he said
was true, but still had the feeling that she could help.� �Steve, you are right, but maybe we could
help Lisa out by telling John a bit about the slave we have been training.� Of course, we leave out the fact that we know
he was part of her rape and just see what his reaction to that might be.� Then if we bring Lisa in to meet him and leave
her with him for a short time, he might say or do something we could get him
on.�� Steve considered what Justin had
said, part of him agreeing that it could work and part of him wanting to leave
Lisa right out of things.� �Master, I
think sir has a good idea.� I don�t
really want to be alone with him at all, but if it is the only way to help
Caitlin then I want to do it.�� 

&nbsp;

Steve stood up
and paced the room.� He was aware of
Caitlin in the kitchen watching him and of the others in the room. �Ok, even if
we try this, how is this going to get him away from Caitlin.� I mean, we still can�t go to the police, even
if we have something on tape.�� �Maybe we
could blackmail him. Force him to let Caitlin go or we will make his secret
public.� He is a respected man in the
business world.� I am sure he wouldn�t
like his extra activities known to his clients.� Steve agreed with what Justin
had said, thinking for the first time that maybe they had a chance. He moved to
squat down in front of Lisa.� �Slave, are
you sure you are willing to do this?� I
know why you want to do it, but do you think you will be able to?�� Lisa had been trying to work out the same
thing as the conversation went on around her.�
�Master, I am determined to try.�
I am sure I will be scared but I will know that you and Sir will be
close by to help me.� Please let me try.�� 

&nbsp;

Caitlin felt
weak with the thought of what Lisa was willing to do for her. She had been told
of Master John�s role in her rape after she had recovered from his visit. She
had not been overly surprised, given her Master�s brutal manner. She hated the
thought of Lisa having to confront one of her rapists but at the same time felt
a small ray of hope that maybe she would not have to return to Master John. She
hadn�t even realised that she was crying until she felt Sir�s hand on her face,
wiping away her tears. �Slave, I am sure you have heard what is going on.� How do you feel about what Slave Lisa wants
to do?�� Caitlin thought about the
question. �Sir, I hate the thought of Lisa having to face Master John but ��
�But what slave?�� �but I can�t go back
to him.� Do you think it will work?�
Caitlin leant back onto the counter behind her, her legs feeling weak at the
thought of being free of her current Master.�


&nbsp;

Justin saw how
much this was affecting Caitlin and took her into his arms.� He felt her body press into his, her head
resting on his shoulder.� For once, he
did not think of what he could do to her, instead he had an overwhelming need
to protect her.� Caitlin felt him hold her,
taking comfort in his strength.� It
seemed ironic to her that she had to become a slave to find a man who she could
love.� She had been aware that she was
falling in love with him since the night of the spa bath but now knew for
certain that what she felt was real.� She
had thought that she had no hope of being with him once she went back to her
real Master, but now she dared to think that maybe it would be ok. �Slave, you
know I will do anything to help you. I want you to be with me. I want to be
your Master.� Would you allow me to be
your Master?� 

&nbsp;

Caitlin had
never thought that the idea of someone wanting to be her Master would make her
so happy.� Of course, she had learnt a
lot about what a real Master could be like since her time away from Master
John. �Sir, I would be happy for you to be my Master. When you told me that not
all Masters were like Master John, I didn�t believe you. However, you have
shown me that someone can be a master and still treat their slave like a human
being.��� Justin was thrilled to hear her
words, glad that if things worked out as planned, that Caitlin would come to
him willingly.� He was not sure if she
realised that if John was no longer her master and she would not come with him,
that she would be resold.� 

&nbsp;

Chapter Sixteen
- Jealousy

&nbsp;

Back in the
lounge room, Lisa watched Caitlin and Sir.�
She felt a stab a jealousy, not because she didn�t want Caitlin to be
happy with Sir, but because she wanted to feel that same way about her new
Master.� If she was honest, she wanted to
stay with Master Steve but knew that once her training was over, she would be
sold off to someone new.� She had tried
not to think about this but as each day went by she found herself becoming more
and more nervous about her future. 

&nbsp;

Steve was aware
of Lisa watching the two in the kitchen and saw the look that flashed through her
eyes.� He thought she looked jealous and
wondered if she wanted to be the one in Justin�s arms. This thought made him
angry and he grabbed her arm firmly, making her look up at him. �Slave, after
the meal you will come with me and we will deal with your punishment. Now I am
hungry, so get into that kitchen and get the meal ready.�� With that he slapped her rather hard on her
bottom, forcing her to move into the kitchen. 

&nbsp;

Lisa did not
know what had caused the change in Master Steve�s behaviour. Her bottom sore
where he had slapped her, she moved quickly into the kitchen to finish
preparing the meal.� Whatever had changed
his mood, she did not want to risk pushing him further. She hoped he would be
in a better mood after dinner.� 

&nbsp;

Lisa stood in
front of the spa bath with Master Steve behind her holding her upper arms in a
firm grip. He had hardly spoken all through the meal and had only let her have
a little part of his meal.� She was
nervous, having never seen him act like this before.� He pushed her forward, tapping her behind her
knees to let her know he wanted her to step into the spa. Lisa sat down,
looking down at the water.� She was aware
of Master Steve removing his clothes and stepping into the spa with her.� She felt herself begin to shake, not knowing
what he would do. She had not felt this scared of him since her first
week.� When he reached out to grab her
hair, she flinched and tried to move her head away from his hand. 

&nbsp;

Steve knew that
she was scared when he saw her flinch away from him. He had thought about how
she had looked at Justin all through his meal and his anger had grown.� He knew that he was partly angry at himself
for thinking that she might want to be with him by choice and not only because she
had to be here.� He grabbed her hair,
pulling it firmly back until her eyes were forced to look up at the
ceiling.� Moving her body so that she was
lying in the water, he suddenly pulled her head down until her head was under
the water.

&nbsp;

Lisa had gasped
as her head was forced back and her body moved so she was lying fully in the
water.� She was not prepared for her head
to be pulled under the water and began to panic as she was firmly held in
place. She tried to shake her head, feeling the need to breath.� She began to thrash about in the water,
kicking her legs in an attempt to get her head up. Lisa felt her Master pinch
and twist her left nipple. The more she thrashed the more he twisted and she
knew that he would keep twisting until she stayed still.� So she lay still, praying that he would soon
let her breath and felt him ease the pain he had been applying to her nipple.
He had not let go of her nipple and she knew that if she tried to struggle
again, he would just twist it like he had done before.� She felt her head being pulled up and took a
huge gulp of air as her head was lifted out of the water, only to find herself
pulled down again by her hair. This was repeated another five times, the last
time the longest.� Each time she remained
still, not wanting him to hurt her nipple again.� She counted to 30 in her head before he let
her come up for air.�� She had to take a
few breaths before she could breath freely again.� She was just about to take another deep breath
when she was moved to a sitting position again, his hand still gripping her hair
firmly. 

&nbsp;

Steve had felt
her panic as he held her head under the water. He knew that she had had no idea
what he had planned to do and had not had the time to take a breath. He felt
her body begin to move, her legs kicking in an attempt to get free. He pinched
her nipple in his fingers and twisted it hard until she eventually stopped
moving.� She had only been under water
for around ten seconds, but because she had been unprepared she had to take a
huge gasp of air when he lifted her head up.�
He saw the water run off her hair and her fleeting hope the he would not
pull her under again. He knew he would usually block of a girl�s nose before
dunking her but he just wanted her to feel some of the pain he was
feeling.� Each time he lifted her head,
she learned to take a deep breath before he pulled her under again.� He let her stay under a little longer each
time, seeing the panic in her eyes. She had remained still for the remainder of
the time under water, his grip on her nipple a reminder of what could happen.
The last time he held her under was just over half a minute and by the time he
let her come up for air, she had gasped a number of times to catch her
breath.� Knowing that she needed a break,
he sat her up, releasing the grip on her nipple but keeping his other hand
gripping her hair firmly.� He saw the
confusion mixed in with her fear as he looked into her eyes.

&nbsp;

Lisa tried to
stay calm as Master Steve continued to grip her hair firmly. She could not
understand why he was treating her this way. She knew it was her punishment but
he had always talked to her before he punished her so that she knew a little of
what to expect. Her head was beginning to ache where he was holding her but she
didn�t dare try to free herself.� She
felt the tears begin to roll down her face and knew there was nothing she could
do to stop them.� She heard him sigh and
saw him reach out his hand towards her face.�
She wanted to move away, fearing his intentions, but could not due to
the grip on her hair. When he simply wiped her tears away, she let out of sigh
of relief.

&nbsp;

Steve held her
hair, feeling some of his anger ebb away.�
He still did not trust himself to speak to her yet, not knowing what he
wanted to say to her.� When she started
to cry he knew he had to take control of himself and sighed, knowing that he
wasn�t being fair to her.� He saw her
look of fear as his hand moved towards her and then her own sigh as he wiped
away her tears.� He loosened that grip on
her hair, hearing another sigh as he did so.�
�Slave, you know that you broke the rules this afternoon by coming into
the room without permission.�� �Yes
Master.� Lisa was relieved that he had let her hair go though she was still
wary of what he might do. �And you know that you earned a punishment for this.�
�Yes Master.� Steve knew that he was asking her these questions to give himself
time to let his anger leave him fully before he spoke to her properly.� He had never allowed anger to take over his
emotions like that before. He stroked her hair as he spoke to her, to try to
calm them both down.� �Slave, I know I
have been acting differently towards you tonight and I hope that I have not
scared you too much. Have I?�� Lisa did
not expect to be asked such a question but knew he always expected honest
answers from her. �Master, you did scare me.�
It was like you were angry at me and I don�t know what I did to make you
so angry. I am sorry Master.�� 

&nbsp;

Steve could
hear the fear in her voice still as she told him she was sorry. He cursed
himself for letting his jealousy get in the way and for making her fear him
like she had when she first came to him.�
He hoped that he could earn her trust again. �Slave, you have nothing to
be sorry for.� I was angry but I took it
out on you in a way I should not have done.�
I have never punished a slave without telling them why and what I
intended to do. It was not right of me to punish you as I did without any
warning. I do hope that you can learn to trust me again.� 

&nbsp;

Lisa still
could not understand what had happened tonight. First her Master terrified her
by almost drowning her and now he was almost apologising to her. She hoped he
would tell her what happened to make him so angry so she could try not to let
it happen again.� �Master, I don�t
understand why you acted the way you did. However, you are my Master and you
can do what you want to me.� Lisa knew she had not told him she could trust him
as she was still wondering about that.� 

&nbsp;

Steve could
tell by her answer that she did not trust him again yet.� He knew the only way to clear the air between
them was to tell her what had caused him to feel angry in the first place.
�Slave, I can see that you need to know what made me so angry.� I saw your face as you watched Justin and
Caitlin and saw your jealousy that it wasn�t you he was holding.� I felt angry that you wanted to be with him
and not with me and took that anger out on you.� Lisa could not believe what he
was telling her. �Master, I did feel jealous when I saw Sir and Caitlin
together, but not for the reason you think.�
I remember thinking that I wish I knew who my Master would be and hoped
that it would be someone like you. I have begun to dread who my new master will
be and how they will treat me. I was only jealous of the promise Sir was making
to Caitlin.�

&nbsp;

Steve was not
sure that he had heard her correctly. He had been right that her look had been
one of jealousy but not for the reasons he thought.� This made him feel even worse for the way he
had treated her. �Slave, are you saying that you did not want to be with Sir?�
�Yes Master.� �And that you only wished to have some control over who will be
your master?� �Yes Master�.� With that
Lisa began to cry.� All of the tension
and fear come out in her sobs.� Steve
just held her until she began to gain some control and then lifted her head
back so he could see her face. �Slave, I am truly sorry for the way I have
acted tonight.� Not only was it wrong of
me to let my personal feelings affect the way I treated a slave but because I
never want you to be as scared of me as you were tonight. I have come to feel
strongly about you, in a way I have never felt about any other girl I have
trained before.� I can�t guarantee what
will happen to you in the future but if I have a say in it, I would like to keep
you with me as my own slave.�� 

&nbsp;

Lisa looked at
her Master and for the first time all evening she could see the calmness back
in his eyes.� She felt the last of her
fear slip away. �Master, if I could stay with you, that would make me very
happy.�� Lisa knew that what she said was
true despite the fear she had felt only a short while ago.� She knew that he was not a deliberately cruel
man and that there had to be some reason he had acted the way he had.

&nbsp;

�Right, now
that that is settled, slave I think it is time you catered to your Master�s needs,
don�t you?�� Lisa looked down and could
see the tip of his erection popping up out of the water. �Yes Master�.� Lisa brought her hands down to feel him as
she moved her head down towards his cock. At least this time she knew she would
not mind getting her head under water. 

&nbsp;

Chapter
Seventeen � The Trap

&nbsp;

Three days
later, Lisa sat in her room trying to calm herself to see one of her rapists
fact to face. She knew that Master John was sitting in the next room right know
talking to Master John, telling him all about the challenges he was facing
training his latest slave.� Master Steve
had asked him to come and give him some advice about how to best train the
slave, pretending that he was not sure if he would make the deadline set.� He would come in soon and bring her in to
introduce her and then they would see what if any reaction they would get.�� 

&nbsp;

Steve had spent
the last half hour talking to John about his supposed inability to properly
train his latest slave.�� He had to
control his emotions so that he had the right about of interest and concern in
his voice.� Justin sat in the next room,
making a copy of everything that was being said.�� He also did not want John to see the hatred
that was in Justin�s eyes. Caitlin was sitting stiffly in John�s lap while his
hands explored her body.� He could see
that Caitlin was very uncomfortable, but he needed her here to back up what he
was saying about Lisa. Steve had told John all about his slave�s history,
including graphic detail of her rape experience. He had been hoping to see some
reaction in John�s face, but about from his apparent interest he had remained
in control.� He knew that he would have
to bring Lisa out of her room to meet John, though he had hoped it would not be
necessary.

&nbsp;

Lisa heard the
door open and braced herself for what was to come.� �Slave, this is your last chance to back out.
Are you sure you want to do this?�� Lisa
longed to say that she had changed her mind but knew that she had to go through
with this. �Master, I have to do this.� I
am not sure what will happen but knowing that you will be near will give me
strength.�� Steve took her arm and led
her out into the room where John and Caitlin were waiting.� 

&nbsp;





Caitlin sat
nervously as Master Steve left the room, afraid to be alone with her Master
again. The only thing that gave her the strength to act like she always did was
the knowledge that Sir was just in the next room.� �Well, salve, it seems as if you have failed
again.� I should have expected something
like this, you never manage to get things right.�� Caitlin tried hard not to let his words
affect her. She knew it was his way of making her feel small.� �Turn around and get that pussy onto my cock.� Do a good job and I may not punish so
severely when we get home later in the week.� Despite the fact that Caitlin
knew there was a good chance she would never have to go back home with him, she
shivered at the thought of what he would do to punish her.� She lifted her body up and spread her legs
wide so that she was straddling his body.�
She gripped his cock in her hands and moved it so that is was sitting at
the entrance to her pussy.� Just as she
was about to gently lower herself onto him, she felt his hands on her shoulder
pushing her down.� 

&nbsp;

Caitlin could
not help but scream as he forced his cock into her body.� As usual her fear of Master John had left her
dry and she felt like he was splitting her in two.� After he had moved her on his cock a few
times, she was grateful to fell her body start to lubricate and ease his entry
somewhat.� She could still felt very full
and her legs were beginning to ache from her unnatural stance.� She heard a cough and was aware of Master
Steve and Lisa standing in the doorway. Caitlin felt herself blush, despite
everything they had all shared together.�
She could feel her Master�s cock swell and knew he was close to
coming.� She grunted as he came in her
and roughly pushed her of his lap onto the floor.� 

&nbsp;

Steve coughed
as he entered the room, as John was forcing Caitlin firming up and down on his
cock, her body shaking with the force.�
John continued until he came in his slave�s body and then roughly pushed
her to the floor.� It was all Steve�s
strength not to help Caitlin to stand but he knew he had to keep up appearances
in front of the other man. He could sense Lisa standing frozen beside him and
forced himself to led her to knell on the floor in front of John.� By know Caitlin had regained her feed and
stood shakily, her Master�s come dripping down her thighs.� �John, I would like you to meet Slave Lisa. �Slave, say hello to Master John.�� Lisa kept her eyes down, as she knew she
should and greeted the man who had raped her. �Welcome, Master John.� 

&nbsp;

John looked at
the slave girl kneeling before him.� He
was trying to place her as one of the girls he and his friends had raped. From
what Steve had told him, it certainly sounded like she had been one of their
victims, but he had to admit that it was not usually their faces that he
remembered.� He moved to raise her face
to him and once he saw her eyes he knew for certain that she had been one his
girls.� He remembered seeing a photo of
her before they had grabbed her and thinking how unusual her eyes were. He
smiled at the memory of what he had done to her and felt his cock move with
anticipation. 

&nbsp;

Lisa tried
hard not to react to Master John�s touch on her chin.� She could tell by his eyes that he remembered
her and was unnerved by the way she could see his cock moving in his
pants.� She was startled by the voice of
Master Steve behind her. �John, would you mind keeping my slave company for a
moment?� There is something I need to do
and if it is ok with you I will take Slave Caitlin with me to freshen up a
bit.� Maybe you can get some sense of
what I could do to help improve her training while I am gone.�� 

&nbsp;

Steve had also
seen the look of recognition in John�s eyes and knew for certain that he now
remembered Lisa. He made himself leave her in the room alone, knowing that this
was what she had asked him to do.� He
could see Caitlin pale face and quickly ushered her into the bathroom to wash
up.

&nbsp;

Lisa waited
nervously as Master Steve and Caitlin left the room. She knew she had to do her
best to get him to talk but was not really sure what she would do yet.� She became aware of Master John standing up
and walking around her, examining her body.�
She made herself stay still and not run screaming away from him.� She thought if Caitlin had been able to
survive three years with this man then she could survive however if might take
to make him talk.

&nbsp;

John walked
around the slave girl, admiring her firm breast and tight butt.� He also tried to tell if she was aware of who
is was and what he had done to her. So far she had reacted as any trainee slave
would to a meeting a new Master.� He
decided he would have some fun with her, after all Steve had asked him to
obverse her and give him some advice on how to train her better.� �Stand up slave and present your body to
me.�� He watched as she stood, spreading
her legs and placing her hands behind her head. �Now, you must answer me
honestly, do you understand slave?�� 

&nbsp;

Lisa stood
stiffly, bracing herself for his touch. �Yes Master, I understand.� �Good, now
Master Steve tells me that you have not cooperated with him during your
training, is this true?�� Lisa knew that
Master Steve had told him this so had to agree. �Yes Master, after what had
happened to me before I came here, I have found it hard to do everything that
Master Steve has wanted me to do.�� �Tell
me, what happened before you came here?��
As he asked this question, John had reached out and placed his hands on
her breasts, squeezing them firmly.� Lisa
had to bite back her revulsion of letting this man touch her again and answer
him. �I was raped Master by a number of men.��


&nbsp;

John continued
to squeeze her breasts as he continued his questions. �Do you know who these
men are? �No Master, I was kept blindfolded the whole time and was unable to
identify any of the men.�� John moved one
hand down to rub her backside, causing him to move closer to her body. Lisa
could feel his cock in his pants and he moved his hand to cup her bottom. She
shivered slightly, but managed to maintain her control.� �So slave, you have never told anyone about
your rape, not your family or the police?� Lisa knew that this was what she had
been warned never to do or she would me made to disappear.� �No Master, I was told not to say anything to
anyone. so I said nothing.�� 

&nbsp;

John moved the
hand that had been on her breast to her hair, pulling it back sharply. Lisa
gasped at her head was pulled back, forcing her to look into his eyes. John
moved to whisper in her ear �Well then, if you told no-one, how come everyone
here knows what happened?� Telling no-one
means telling no-one bitch. Now we will have to see what we can do to punish
you for breaking the rules.�� Lisa froze,
feeling again the fear she had felt in the months after her rape.� �I am sure that I could arrange for one of my
friends to buy you once you are trained and then we can all have some fun, what
do you say slut?�

&nbsp;

Lisa couldn�t
move let alone speak.� She had forgotten
that this was exactly what she had wanted to achieve and only felt fear at what
he was saying.� �Something stuck in your
throat slut? I remember seeing you with my cock stuck in your throat. Do you
remember that bitch?� I sure do and I
can�t wait to get it down there again. Plus into some other holes as well.� As
he said this, John moved his hand from her bottom to her ass hole, rubbing it
and pushing a finger into her.� Lisa
moaned as he moved the finger in her ass, feeling like she had gone back in
time to her rape.� She forced herself to
remember what she had to do and found her voice at last.� �Master, do you mean to say that you were one
of the men who raped me?�� Lisa felt the
finger being removed and Master John tilt her head back a bit more to look at
her again. �Slave, not only was I one of the men but it was on my orders that
you were taken. We had a number of girls to pick from but you were just in the
right place at the right time. I never thought I would get the chance to have
to anytime I want to.� My friend, whom
you have never seen but know his cock, would be happy to share you.� Who knows we could even re-enact that day
over and over. Wouldn�t that be fun, slave?�

&nbsp;

Lisa wondered
if Master John�s words were loud enough to be heard. It would be a waste of
time and very dangerous for her, if his words could not be heard because of his
whispers. She knew she had to get him to say it louder.� She struggled to get out of his grip and was
surprised when she managed to break free. She ran to stand behind the couch.
�No, get away from me. You raped me and I won�t let you touch me again.�� 

&nbsp;

John had been
taken by surprise when she wriggled out of his grip and was even more surprised
by her outburst.� �Stupid bitch, what do
you think you are doing? Don�t you realise that you will never get away from me
now.� Even if you don�t meet all the
training standards, I will get my friend to go to the company and offer to take
you off their hands.� As he was talking he had moved around to the back of the
couch and now held her in a grip with his arm around her throat, her back to
him.� �We raped you then and we will do
it again.� This time though you will know
that they will be no end.� You will be
ours until we tire of you and then maybe we will sell you off or make you
available to others so they could rape you too.�� 

&nbsp;

Lisa felt his
firm grip on her throat and struggled to stay conscious.� She could hear him talking but had stopped
listening to what he was saying. Just as she thought she was going to pass out,
he let her go.� She fell forward onto the
couch and felt his hot breath on her ear.�
�One week, bitch, one week and you will be mine� She shivered despite
knowing that what he said would not happen, at least she hoped not.� Just as she stood up, Master Steve she heard
a knock on the door and heard Master Steve ask if he could enter.� She felt Master John move away from her and
open the door allowing Master Steve to enter.

&nbsp;

Steve had seen
what had occurred on the TV in the other room. He had had trouble hearing what
he was saying to her at first but when she had struggled away from him and made
him speak to her louder, he knew they had enough evidence to use against
him.� He looked with concern at how pale
Lisa was looking but knew he had to address John before he could help her.� �Well, do you think she is worth continuing
to train?� I really hate to admit
defeat.�� John had been concerned that
his outburst had been overheard but by the manner of Steve, he guessed the
rooms must be sound proof.� �Of course.
It would be a shame to let such a beauty go to waste.� I was just telling the girl that I know a
fellow Master who is looking for a new slave and I know he would have no
problems dealing with her.� I mean to say
he would be happy to continue her training.� Steve forced himself to smile and
shake the man�s hand, seemingly sealing Lisa�s fate.� John shook back; smiling to himself at how
well the day had turned out. In a week�s time, not only would he have his slave
back but he would have a new fuck toy to play for him and his friends to play
with. 

&nbsp;

Steve saw the
smirk on the man�s face and it was all he could do not to wipe it of him with
his fist.� Instead he smiled and asked
him to come into the other room so they could work out a few more details. What
he was really doing was leading him to Justin was preparing the tape to show
him.� Justin was making a copy as he left
and he knew that he would be ready by the time he brought back into the room.
�Just give me a moment to return the slave to her room and I will be with
you.�� He took Lisa by the arm, forcing
her to move quickly out of the room, knowing that John would think any show on
concern strange.� 

&nbsp;

Lisa had stood
gripping the back of the chair, listening to the men discuss her. She had to
remind herself that this was not real and that Master Steve did not just sell
her to another one of her rapists.� She
felt his firm grip on her upper arm and almost stumbled on her way out of the
room.� It was not until they were both in
her bedroom that she allowed herself to let go and relax.� �Slave, I have to get back but I have to tell
you that you did very well.� Slave
Caitlin is here to help you.�� With that
he was gone and Lisa found herself in Caitlin�s arms.� She felt herself start to shake with the
delayed reaction to her encounter and soon she was crying hard.� 

&nbsp;

Caitlin let
Lisa cry, knowing that her experience had been a traumatic one.� Eventually, she felt her sobs lesson and
moved to wipe the tears from her face. Lisa became aware of her surroundings
once more, feeling Caitlin wipe the last of her tears away. �Lisa, are you
ok?� He didn�t hurt you, did he?�� Lisa sat down on the bed with 

Caitlin
sitting beside her.� �No, he didn�t hurt
me, but he scared me. He said that I needed to be punished for telling Master
Steve about the rape and that he would get one of the other men who had raped
me to buy me. He said that then they would re-enact the rape over and
over.� It was awful.�� Caitlin listened to what Lisa was saying;
knowing that given that opportunity Master John would do exactly what he had
said. �Shhh, Master Steve would never let that happen. From what he said when
he came in, you did a good job, so they must have enough on tape to trap him.�� Lisa hoped that she was right; she knew she
would rather die then let those animals touch her again.

Chapter
Eighteen � Blackmail

&nbsp;

Steve led John
into the room where Justin had a drink ready for them both.� The three men sat on the couch and drank
their drinks, each one lost in their own thoughts for the moment. �Well John, I
hope we have not wasted your time today,� Justin asked, �Steve and I were
pleased when you agreed to assist us in our slave�s training. She has come a
long way, but just needs a little something to see her through.�� �Yes, I have made Steve an offer of help. One
of friends needs a new slave and I just know that this one would suit him very
well.�� 

&nbsp;

Justin tried
to hide his anger as he heard this; certain that he was offering to let another
one of Lisa�s rapists buy her.� �That
sounds like an interesting option.� I
would just like to show you something which might just change your mind.�� John wondered what they were going to show
him.� Maybe it was a video of some of the
girl�s training so he would know what had yet to be done. Whatever it was, he
was sure it would not change his mind.�
However, as he watched himself with the slave girl he wondered what
their game was.� By the time it was done
he was considering his options.� They
were both strong men and he was sure he would not be able to leave without them
stopping him. One the other hand, maybe he could offer them a piece of the
action. �Ok, so you know my little secret. What do you want, I could let you
know when we are next heading out, if you want to join in.�� 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;





Steve saw the
muscles in Justin�s jaw twitch and moved to speak before him. �No thank you, we
do not want any part of your sordid little games.� What we do want is your slave Caitlin.�� Steve waited for a moment to let this sink in
before he continued to speak.� �If you
let Caitlin go then we won�t have to let this video be seen by your business
colleagues. I am sure even you would not want to brag about this to them.�� 

&nbsp;

John thought
for a moment, considering the reaction the harm the video would do to his
reputation.� In the world outside of this
one, he was a respected business man who had worked hard to get where he
was.� He was not stupid and knew when he
was beat. �Ok, if I let Caitlin stay here with you, what guarantee do I have
that you won�t let this video be seen anyway?��
�Well, you don�t but I give you my word that this video will never be
seen outside of this room if you do as we ask.�
Of course, that also means your friend will also never get his slimy
hands on Slave Lisa either.� 

&nbsp;

John cursed and
realised he had not option.� He been so
looking forward to getting his hands on the slave again, but again he figured
that he could get plenty of other girls. None of them were worth his business.� �Ok, you have a deal.� I will let you have Caitlin. She beginning to
bore me anyway.�� Steve again saw
Justin�s jaw twitch at his comment but was relieved to see him keep his
thoughts to himself.� He was surprised at
how easy things had gone and hoped that John did not have something up his
sleeve.� 

&nbsp;

John stood to
leave, knowing that he would not win this fight today.� He knew that, in time, he would find a way to
get back at the two men and the bitches that had caused this.� However he knew that now was not the
time.� He shook the men�s hands and left.

&nbsp;

Justin went and
poured then both another drink.� �Wow,
that was easier than I thought it would be.�
Do you think he is up to something?��
He handed Steve a drink and sat down.�
�I am sure he is.� He is not the
type of man to give in so easily, but I do believe that he would never want
that tape shown to anyone.� I will keep
Mike on, even if it takes months, until he slips up. I have been thinking of
moving on from here find a place for Lisa and me to live.� I have saved plenty of money over the last
ten years to keep me going.�� Justin was
pleased to hear Steve�s plans and began to release he could now do the same.
�That sounds great Steve.� Do you think
Lisa will go with you willingly?�� �We
spoke about it a few days ago, after I let my jealous rage scare the life out
of her.� I guess you were right about how
I felt about her and it took me acting like a dangerous fool to understand how
I was feeling. What about you, will you make a new life with Caitlin?�� Justin nodded, �Yes, I suppose we can now. I
am not sure where but so long as she is away from John, she will be safe.���� 

&nbsp;

Both of the men
finished their drinks and stood.� �Well,
I guess we have kept our slaves waiting long enough. They will be dying to know
what happened.�

&nbsp;

Chapter
nineteen � A new life

&nbsp;

Lisa heard the
door open and held her breath until she saw Master Steve and Sir walk in the
door. She had had the crazy fear that somehow Master John had overpowered the
two and she would be dragged back into his clutches again.� Steve saw Lisa�s frightened face as he opened
the door and then her face break into a big grin as she saw it was him.� Any doubts he might have had about her
wanting to stay with him vanished as he saw her smile. �Slave, it is over.� He has agreed to let Caitlin stay with us.�� Lisa felt a rush of relief for Caitlin but
then released that he had not said what would happen to her.� Would Master Steve still let her go with
Master John�s friend? Maybe he was happy to have found a master for her and
make the money he must get from her sale.�
She turned away, not wanting to look at him. 

&nbsp;

Steve saw
Lisa�s relief at Caitlin freedom from John but was confused by her changed
attitude.� He watched her turn away from
him and move to stand by the door to the bathroom. �Slave, what is wrong?� Are you still upset over having to confront
Master John?�� �Master I am very happy
for Caitlin and I was very upset when I got back to the room before. Caitlin
helped me and I feel much better know, though I will not forget this day for a
while.�� Steve still did not get any clue
as to why she was acting the way she was.�
�Slave, you don�t sound very happy.�
What is troubling you?� He turned her to face him and had to force her
head up to look at him. He was surprised to see tears in her eyes. �Master, you
said that Master John was going to let Caitlin stay here but you did not say
what will happen to me?�� 

&nbsp;

Steve was
puzzled for the moment until he remembered his discussion with John about his
friend buying her.� He had assumed that
she would realise that he was just humouring the man and would never let any of
John�s friends own her.� �Slave, what do
you mean what will happen to you?� Are
you concerned about Master John�s friend? Surely you know that I would never,
ever let any of those bastards touch you let alone own you.�� Lisa felt such relief at his answer that she
felt weak. She felt her knees give way just as he caught her.� �Master, I wasn�t sure.� I know you have to find a owner for me and
just thought that ��� Lisa stopped
speaking as her Master bent down and kissed her.� He had never done this before and by the time
he let her go, her head was spinning.�
�Slave, I thought you understood that I want you with me, always.� The thought of anyone else owning you drives
me crazy. I have decided that you will be my last job and we will go somewhere
else and start a new life together.� 

&nbsp;

Lisa had to sit
down to digest what he had said.� She
made her way over to sit on the bed, ignoring the looks she was getting from
Sir and Caitlin. She was aware of Master Steve sitting on the bed next to her.
�Master, do you mean that? Would you really give up everything for me?�� Steve could see her trying to take in what he
had told her. �I am not giving up everything, I am just making a new start. I
have done this job for over ten years and up until you came along I had not
realised that I was looking for more.� Of
course, you would still be a slave and I continue to be your Master. That won�t
change.�� Lisa was starting to believe
him, but still needed to make sure he was really to make such a drastic change
for her.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

�Master, what
about your job?� Would be happy doing
another job? What if you are not happy and you start to blame me?�� �Shhh, I would hate to get that gag out.�
Lisa looked at him with shock thinking he couldn�t seriously gag her at a time
like this, when she had so much to ask him.�
One look at the smirk on his face told her he was teasing her. �Ok, not
a good time for a joke, I see.� Now,
about my job, I have plenty of money saved so will not need to work for quite a
while. So there will be no worry about me blaming you for my choices.� Of course, if you go looking at other men,
then we might have a problem.� Lisa shuddered at bit at the memory of his
jealously and knew that she never wanted to see him that angry at her ever
again. �Master, I would never do that.�
Even if I had not experienced your jealousy the other night, I would
never look at another man.�� 

&nbsp;

Steve heard her
tone change as she mentioned his anger the other night and was sorry he had reminded
her. �Slave, I promise I will try to not hurt you with my anger again. Now, you
have not told me what you think of this plan.�
I will have you with me but I would prefer it if you wanted that too.�� �Master, I do want to be with you.� I want to make you happy just as you have
made me happy.� Thank you Master, for
giving me my life back.�� Steve could
resist her no longer and moved to kiss her again.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Justin had
taken Caitlin out of the room as he realised that Steve needed some
privacy.� Caitlin had too been relived to
see the two men return to the room.� Once
he had her settled in his room, he too discussed the future they would have
together.� Caitlin felt total relief at
the thought of never having to be touched by her former Master again.� For the first time in over three years, her
future actually looked bright. She smiled to herself as her new Master stood to
remove his clothes.� She knew exactly how
to please her new Master.� 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

EPILOGUE

&nbsp;

A year later,
Lisa and Caitlin were preparing the evening meal while the two men sat having
their pre dinner drink.� Both the woman
were aware of how familiar the scene was, having done the same thing each night
for over a year.� It had been Steve�s
idea to share a house together.� He knew
how close both the women had become and he also liked the idea of having
Caitlin and Justin living with him and Lisa.�


&nbsp;

Lisa reflected
on the changes the last year had brought.�
The had all move to a beautiful estate in the country that allowed them
the privacy to enjoy themselves the way they wanted to.� Over a month after they had moved in they had
received word that Mike, the private detective, had finally caught Master John
and his friends grabbing a girl. A girl to the police had seen them all
arrested and charged with a number of charges.�
They had been too late to save the girl from being raped but as least
she had only been in the van for a short time before the police saved her.� She felt sorry that another girl had had to
suffer but at least she knew that with John behind bars for a long time he
would not be hurting any other girls.� 

&nbsp;

The change in
Caitlin after John had been arrested had been quite amazing. She had relaxed a
lot under Justin�s control but still held a fear that John would find her and
make her suffer.� However, once he was no
longer a threat, she blossomed in front of their eyes.� It was now usual to hear her laughter flow
through the house.� Of course, at times
the only sounds to be heard were moans and cries, but even when the two women
were suffering they knew that they were in good hands.� 

&nbsp;

Lisa finished
serving the meal and knelt down beside her Master�s chair, knowing that this
was how she wanted to live the rest of her life. This was the only reality she
ever wanted to live.
