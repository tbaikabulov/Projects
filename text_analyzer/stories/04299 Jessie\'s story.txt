Jessie�s story- Pt. 1

&nbsp;

Tuesday,
 8 November 2005

&nbsp;

It had been another long day. Jessie
screwed her tired eyes shut, fingers still resting on the keyboard. She had an
idea for another story in the back of her mind, but had been too busy to write
one word. It was well past her usual finishing time &amp; her work was almost
done. There was no one left in the office- the coast was finally clear. Opening
her secret folder, she brought up a new document &amp; started typing.

&nbsp;

The cares of the day washed away as she
drifted into her special place. A place without deadlines,
criticism or boring, endless work.

&nbsp;

In twenty minutes, she�d gotten the first
page done, enough to take home and get her teeth into.

Popping a floppy disc into the computer,
she hit save &amp; waited for the familiar grinding noise to stop. Another
minute &amp; she�d be out of the office &amp; on her way to the train station.

&nbsp;

Leaning back in her chair, she stretched,
&amp; closed her tired eyes again. What a day! Just one damn
thing after another. �I suppose that�s the price you pay for being
efficient &amp; dependable.�

&nbsp;

She sensed, rather than saw a flicker of
movement behind her. Suddenly, a gloved hand was forcing a large rubber ball
between her jaws. Panicking, she reached up to grab the wrists of the unknown
attacker. His grip was like iron. Without any leverage, she was unable to stop
the straps being buckled tightly behind her head. 

&nbsp;

Catching a glimpse of a black balaklava as she fought to break free, she felt her arms
twisted up behind her back and lashed together. In a matter of moments she�d
gone from a sophisticated secretary to a helpless heroine, just like in her
stories!

�

As the inevitable blindfold cut off her
sight, the thought flashed through her head. �It couldn�t be HIM, surely. He�s
in Australia for god�s sake.�

&nbsp;

�What the fuck are you doing?� she tried to
say. �I wasn�t serious, you goddamn weirdo!�

&nbsp;

He heard a garbled scream as he pulled her
to her feet. �Don�t worry little slave girl� he murmured into her ear �you
don�t have to worry about a thing anymore. I�m going to take you far, far away
from all this- no more fog and rain for you, my sweet.�

&nbsp;

A sense of unreality hit her- she was being
taken away from her life, her friends, and the country she�d grown up in. To a
far off land with some guy who knew her darkest fantasies. The question she was
asking herself- if it was a nightmare too horrible to contemplate, why was she
so excited? 

&nbsp;

She was led out of the office, by a lead
&amp; collar he�d thoughtfully fitted. She staggered along in her high heels,
trying to keep her balance without her arms. Taken down to the underground car
park, she heard the echo of her shoes clicking against the concrete walls.
Thankfully, her uncertain walk ended, &amp; she was pushed into the back of a
van, and quickly hogtied, face down on the carpet. The lead was clipped to a
ring on the wall, &amp; she heard the door slide closed &amp; then slam.

&nbsp;

The asshole was talking to her again, over
the noise of the motor. �Don�t worry, my sweet, we�ll have you on the ship in
about half an hour.�

&nbsp;

Jessie�s story- Pt. 2

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The trip took ages, with her lying face
down on the floor of the van, being rolled back and forth. Every time they hit
a bump, she banged her head on the floor. As she moved around, the lead pulled
on her collar, making breathing more difficult. He�d even thrown a heavy
blanket over her, a hot itchy thing, which smelt of horses &amp; grease. She
struggled against the ropes to no avail. Not an ounce of give &amp; the knots
were nowhere to be found. She wriggled around, arching
her back, trying desperately to get free.

&nbsp;

Eventually they stopped &amp; she heard
voices. Trying to make some sort of noise around the gag, with the collar
cutting off her air was almost impossible. The blanket also helped to muffle
any cry she could utter, and to make matters worse, he�d turned the stereo on! 

&nbsp;

Another short trip and the van stopped, the
motor was shut off and she heard him open the door. �I hope that wasn�t too
uncomfortable for you� he said, uncovering her. Was that a note of concern in
his voice? Up til now, he�d been as casual as if he was transporting livestock.

&nbsp;

Perhaps if she put on a pathetic act, with
some tears he might have second thoughts. Maybe it was just some sort of sick
joke- he couldn�t really be taking her overseas? 

&nbsp;

She turned her face toward him, and tried
to make intelligible sounds. If only she could get him to take the gag out-
maybe she would be able to talk sense into him. God, it was so frustrating, not
being able to speak! The lead was unhooked, &amp; her legs untied- it was good
to stretch out again. Still blindfolded, she was dragged out and stood upright.
She could hear seagulls &amp; what sounded like forklifts &amp; trucks.

&nbsp;

�Come on my sweet� he ordered, pulling on
the lead in a no-nonsense manner. �We�ve got to get you packed up ready for
transit. The ship leaves in less than an hour.�

&nbsp;

A cold chill ran through her. Her heels
echoed once again, as she wobbled along behind him, on her stiff legs. She was
more frightened than she�d ever been in her life &amp; was desperate to pee.
The sound of a door opening and closing behind her, and she was in a warm room.
It felt like carpet under her feet and she could no longer hear the forklifts. 

&nbsp;

The blindfold was removed and she saw the
face of her captor in the bright light. Blinking and screwing her eyes up, she
saw he looked OK- no film star looks, but tall and fairly good-looking. Not the
weirdo she�d imagined while hog-tied in the back of the van. He looked strong
and competent and didn�t seem to have an ounce of humor in his eyes. 

&nbsp;

By then she was hopping on one leg, bending
over with the urgency to urinate. Smiling, he said �does little slave girl need
to go pee-pee?� Ignoring the humiliating put-down, she nodded desperately.
Ushered through another door, her face burnt with shame as her skirt was lifted
up, and her panties pulled down. He took them right off, remarking that �you
won�t be needing them again.�

He went out and closed the door, leaving
her gagged and still tied, in a utilitarian bathroom. All thoughts of modesty
went out the window as she hurried over to the nearest convenience and plopped
down on it, trying to keep her skirt up.

&nbsp;

Things didn�t seem quite so bad afterwards.
She could almost breathe normally again. Managing to clean herself up a bit,
she wasted no time in standing and pulling her skirt down as much as she could.

&nbsp;

The door opened- �Finished are we? Let�s
get you out of those clothes first, and into something more comfortable.�
Trying to evade him, she almost slipped over. He looked at her like a parent
whose child was acting up. �When you�ve quite finished?�

�

She thought of kicking her shoes off, for
better balance, but realised she�d be worse off in her stockinged feet. She
could easily fall and knock her head against the wall or worse. Better to just
go along with the guy and hope he didn�t become antagonised.

&nbsp;

Clipping the lead on again, he led her out to the carpeted room. She followed meekly,
her head down, feeling the cool air between her legs. With a start she realised
he hadn't touched her in a sexual way yet. That was creepy. As if reading her
thoughts, he sat in a chair and pulled her down to her knees in front of him.
�You can take your shoes off now� he said, pulling her towards him.

&nbsp;

�I�m going to give you your first choice my
sweet. Either you can oral sex on me until I�m satisfied, or you can go
straight in the box still wearing that gag. I�ll give you a drink of water
after you�ve satisfied me- you�ll be in that box for a long time.� 

&nbsp;

She glanced over at a plain wooden packing
crate, with �Australia- Top Load Only� stencilled on it. Her stomach flipped-
this was one of her darkest fantasies.�
That was the scariest thing about all this- she�d been communicating
with the guy for years, he knew stuff about her no one else knew. Even her worst fears. 

&nbsp;

He went on as if he was talking about the
weather- �Now I don�t want to force you to do anything you don�t want to do.
You�re perfectly free to go straight in there right now if you�d rather?�

&nbsp;

The smug git! What a choice. �Do you choose
the devil or the deep blue sea?� �The frying pan or the
fire?�

If only someone would burst in the room-
the Police or Interpol maybe. The idea of being boxed up was something to dream
about when she was in control of the situation. This was more of a nightmare,
too frightening to contemplate. It must be a dream, things like this only
happened on TV. 

&nbsp;

He placed his hand against her head and
looked into her eyes. �I�m not going to hurt you Jessie, I promise. I could
have just taken you to the car park and raped and strangled you by now. I want
us to be together always.� 

&nbsp;

�Always�� she thought with a sick feeling. �Oh God.� 

&nbsp;

As the feeling of hopelessness swept over
her, she bowed her head and closed her eyes. It was the way he said it- he was
dead set. The reality of the situation hit her, as if for the first time.
Something melted inside her, her whole body felt hot and flushed. She was a
prisoner, never to see the real world again. 

&nbsp;

With the fear and hopelessness, came a
strange feeling of relief. It was something she�d never felt before- her mind
became detached from her body, and floated around like a leaf in the wind.
Everything seemed clearer- she could feel her heart beating and her breathing
slowed. Her awareness seemed to increase dramatically and the ropes seemed to
caress her wrists. She noticed that the ropes rendering her helpless hadn't
loosened at all since she�d been first tied. She still had feeling in her
hands, and the tie still felt tight and unyielding, not cutting into her skin.
At that moment she became one with her own fantasies. For a moment she felt
safe, her destiny� in
someone else�s hands. 

&nbsp;

�Well, my sweet� he said, with a smile
�what�s it to be?� In answer, she moved towards him. There was nothing to be
gained by fighting. It made more sense to go along with him, and wait for her
chance. Maybe it wouldn�t be so bad, it was kinda nice to be so well tied, and
the collar and lead felt good. Even the gag strapped deep in her mouth felt
snug and effective. He unbuckled it, giving her a chance to swallow and catch
her breath. �You have permission to ask one question� he told her, �not start a conversation.�

&nbsp;

�Please let me go� she begged- �I�ll do
what you want, but please let me go home afterwards.�

�Let you go? I�ve only just acquired you�
he replied incredulously. �Now keep quiet-you have your first task to perform.�
He leaned forward &amp; unbuttoned her blouse and carefully opened it. As her
lacy bra was revealed, he whistled appreciatively. �You look real nice Jessie-
I just love your sexy underwear. It�ll be such a shame to take it all
off.�� As she shivered in anticipation,
pulling uselessly at her bound wrists, he slid her blouse off her shoulders and
began to caress her naked skin.

Jessie�s story- Pt. 3

&nbsp;

Jessie watched apprehensively as her captor
leaned back and undid his pants. As she reluctantly moved closer, she heard
voices outside the door. In a flash, her instincts of self-preservation took
over. Slamming her forehead down on his delicate parts, she scrambled to her
feet, and aimed a kick at his crotch. With the second blow, he slithered to the
floor moaning. In her stockinged feet, she hurried to the door, and turned
around to open it. Bursting into the passageway, she slipped on the shiny lino
and unable to use her hands, overbalanced and fell down. Looking around
frantically, she saw two domestics disappearing around the next corner. 

&nbsp;

�HELP HELP� she called out- �I�ve been
kidnapped!�

&nbsp;

The two women turned around, and ambled
towards her, pushing their cleaning trolley. They looked to be in their 40s,
shapeless women, who had spent too many years cleaning up other people�s
messes. They looked unsympathetically at Jessie, lying there with her wrists
tied behind her. She was scrabbling around on the slippery floor, trying to get
up, her hair in disarray and top almost off. �Please help me, there�s a guy in
the next room, who�s trying to take me out of the country.

&nbsp;

Wordlessly the domestics leaned down and
took an arm each. Dragging her non-too gently to her feet, they turned to the
door she�d just come through. Her protests were ignored as she was dragged back
into the room she�d just escaped from. �What are you doing?� was her desperate
plea. �He�s still in there, let me go. Why don�t you untie me?�

&nbsp;

Still no word from the
two determined women, as they entered the room.
Her captor was sitting hunched in a chair, holding his bruised privates. In
disbelief, Jessie looked from the cleaners to the kidnapper. �Please, just let
me go,� she begged, all the fight gone out of her.

&nbsp;

�Is this yours Mr. Kimodo?� asked one of
the women, who still held her upper arm in an iron grip.

&nbsp;

�Can you put her in the box for me girls?�
he said in a hoarse whisper. �I don�t feel like prevailing upon her for sexual
favours right now.�

&nbsp;

�Like this? Or you want her clothes off?�

&nbsp;

�I want every stitch of clothing off her�
he replied. �Don�t rip her clothes though, I like that outfit.�

&nbsp;

Jessie began to scream and kick as she was
dragged over to the box. When one of the domestics took the lid off, she saw it
was tailor made for her. It was long enough for her to stretch out in, and
about 3 feet wide. A thick board on edge ran across one end, which came apart,
like a set of stocks, revealing holes for her neck and wrists. A similar one
near the bottom had a hole for each ankle, on each side. 

&nbsp;

Black sponge rubber lined the bottom and
sides, as well as the lid. �No- please,� she moaned, becoming panicky �you
can�t put me in there- I�ll suffocate.�

&nbsp;

�No-one has yet, my little wildcat� said
the Australian guy. �Besides, if you did, it�d serve you right!�

&nbsp;

While one of the women stood behind her,
holding her arms, the other peeled her blouse down, and undid her skirt. The
skirt was left around her ankles, hampering her efforts to kick, and her wrists
were untied. Soon, she was completely naked, her arms forced up behind her
back. 

&nbsp;

The repulsive pair� took the opportunity to grope and
squeeze her, pinching her nipples and poking at her snatch. No matter how she
fought and twisted around, it was impossible to evade their questing fingers.
Although she was humiliated and terrified, her body was betraying her. There
was no denying it, these creepy women were getting her
excited. The way they were handling and humiliating her was having an effect
she couldn�t deny.

&nbsp;

�Her
body was trembling in fear, anticipation and a fair amount of lust as they
installed her on her back in the box. The bar went over her wrists and neck,
forcing her head back so she was unable to see the rest of her body. Once it
was fixed into place, she couldn�t even turn her head and the fit was so tight,� her breathing was
restricted. Too petrified to move, she lay still as she was stretched out and
her ankles received the same treatment. 

&nbsp;

She was stuck! Nothing in her life had
prepared her for this. Normally a strong-willed woman, she was finding it hard
to think straight. Her mind was numb with terror. This couldn�t be happening,
it just didn�t seem real. 

&nbsp;

Her eyes closed as the clumsy fingers were
at her most secret spot again. Her legs were held far enough apart that a
well-lubricated finger slipped inside her with no trouble. It moved around
inside her, then withdrew, to be replaced by a small
egg-shaped object. Craning her neck, all she could see was the back of the
woman�s head- she couldn�t even see her own breasts.

&nbsp;

A plastic mask was placed over her face and
taped into place with a generous amount of duct tape. Her eyes were covered, then more duct tape went over that. As her world went dark,
air began to hiss into the facemask. 

&nbsp;

Again, the hands were all over her body,
the same rough, clumsy hands. Duct tape was plastered over her crotch- sealing
her up tight. The egg was not coming out now. A hard triangular object was
wedged into place between her legs, with a rubber cover that pressed hard
against her and forced her legs even further apart. 

&nbsp;

�Ticklish are you?� asked a disembodied
voice, as someone tickled the soles of her feet. She jerked from side to side,
trying to evade the flickering fingers. 

&nbsp;

Some sort of soft rubber packing material, was poured around her, covering her entirely, as
if she was being drowned in styrofoam beads. The lid of the box was forced
down, compressing the packing, and making any movement impossible. Suddenly it
was just Jessie, with no external influences whatsoever. 

&nbsp;

The sensations were unbelievable. She was
squeezed from all sides, unable to even twitch. It was like being in concrete.
The only sound was the air hissing into the facemask. For a moment she
considered the possibility of asphyxiation, if the air supply failed. 

&nbsp;

The bar was tight around her neck, as she
tried to keep her panic under control. Breathing deeply and rhythmically, she
could feel her heart pounding and a roaring in her ears. 

&nbsp;

The box seemed to be moving- it was hard to
tell, but her feet seemed to rise- yes, that was a
bump. �Oh my God� she thought- they�re putting me on a ship. Suddenly it was
too much, panic overcame her. �LET ME OUT OF HERE� she screamed. With all her
strength, she tried to gain some sort of movement. Flexing her muscles, she
pulled, pushed and threw herself from side to side, screaming incoherently. For
a few minutes she was in a state of blind panic, until she was spent. 

&nbsp;

Fists clenched, she tried desperately to
calm herself. �I�m not going to die. I�m going to be OK. I�ve got air, I�m
perfectly safe.� 

&nbsp;

The box seemed to drop into place and all
was still. As she gradually willed each muscle to relax, her breathing slowed
to the point that she entered a state of detachment. Her brain seemed to cease
functioning- as if she was now on autopilot, like a computer going into sleep
mode. 

&nbsp;

A small voice deep inside her seemed to be
saying �I�m OK- I can survive through this.�

&nbsp;

�Without any warning, the egg deep inside her
started to gently vibrate.

&nbsp;

Jessie�s story- Pt. 4

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Time passed slowly for
Jessie. The egg inside her buzzed quietly away, not doing
much to arouse her. It felt nice to start with, but after 2 hours or so was
more of an annoyance. If it was one of her stories, she thought, the speed would
increase until she was moaning in frustration, then stop
or die down, driving her crazy. Instead it was just a gentle hum deep inside
her, enough to put paid to any thought of relaxing, going to sleep or thinking
straight. 

&nbsp;

Her thoughts were far
from the normal rational, well structured, patterns she usually had in her
head. Instead they were disembodied- with no single train of thought going for
more than a few seconds. Try as she might, she couldn�t think of any rational
plan. Apart from trying to reason with him, she was at a loss. How could you
reason with a guy who came thousands of miles to kidnap her? He could have gone
up the road &amp; grabbed some babe in his hometown! Why go to all this
trouble? 

&nbsp;

Again, she lost track
of what she was thinking. It was easier to just try and drift, to maybe try and
enjoy the sensations. For there was something about being shut in a box,
squeezed with rubber beads, while her wrists, neck and ankles were trapped in
immovable sets of stocks.

&nbsp;

One thought kept
coming back to her �HOW LONG?� If they were on a ship, was she to be trapped
for days? At the beginning of her ordeal, she had a mental image of being
unloaded at the docks onto a truck, and taken across
the country. Australia was a big place, she
could be in the box a long, long time. 

&nbsp;

Managing not to panic,
she wondered how smart the guy was. Did he have enough sense to realise you couldn�t just stick someone in a box, and leave
them for days? Did he believe the stories on the Internet were
all true? 

&nbsp;

God it was hot. She
was swimming in perspiration. With the heat came periods
where she lost consciousness for an unknown amount of time. Was she
sleeping or was the heat getting to her?

&nbsp;

By the time the box
was opened, she�d been in there a little over two hours. Light- headed &amp;
disorientated, she blinked as the bright light hit her eyes. The bars were
released &amp; she was lifted up, still unable to see in the glare. Were they
in Australia already? 

&nbsp;

�You didn�t think
you�d be in there the whole trip did you?� came the familiar voice of her
captor. �I would have told you how long it�d be, but I was having a little
difficulty speaking.�� 

&nbsp;

�I just had to keep
you out of sight to get through customs, we�re on my
ship now.�

&nbsp;

As her eyes slowly
focused, a plastic cup full of water was handed to her. So limp, she could
hardly hold it, she managed to pour some of it through
her dry lips. With shaking hands, she pulled the now dead egg from inside her
dripping snatch.

Jessie�s story- Pt. 5

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

As her vision and her mind gradually
cleared, she realised she was on the deck of a small cargo ship, 30 meters or
so in length. The guy sat watching her, with a smug look on his face. �Welcome
aboard, my sweet� he said. 

&nbsp;

They were on a sort of mezzanine deck, with
no land in sight. As her thought process resumed, she covered her nakedness
with her hands, and tried to speak. �What do you want? You must be crazy if you
think you can get away with this.� 

&nbsp;

�Oh, but I have gotten away with it,
Jessie. We�re at sea in International waters. Once we get back to Australia,
we�ll get off before the ship goes through customs.�

&nbsp;

�I must say I�m disappointed in your
behaviour so far- this could turn out to be very uncomfortable for you if you don�t
do as you�re told.� 

&nbsp;

She looked at him- he was serious! The
people you meet on the Internet, indeed. Everyone said you shouldn�t trust
anyone you meet online, in the chat rooms. Her mouth agape, she listened to him
raving.

&nbsp;

�Don�t think about attacking me again, my
sweet. I won�t be so accommodating next time. You�ll spend the rest of the trip
in that box unless you smarten yourself up a bit. Or perhaps
something different?�

&nbsp;

She glanced involuntarily at the box, its
lid lying next to it and saw small black rubber beads spilled around it. Some
of the beads were still stuck to her clammy skin, she
tried to brush them off without giving him the satisfaction of ogling her.

&nbsp;

�I don�t want you to turn your back on me
Jessie� he said in a way that made her flesh creep. �Stand up straight, hands
by your sides facing me please.�

&nbsp;

Teeth gritted, she complied. Sooner or
later she�d get a chance to sink her foot into him again. This time she�d knock
him unconcious. That thought gave her the strength to
straighten up, burning with shame as she felt his eyes roving over her body.
He�d get his all right- he�d regret kidnapping her for the rest of his
miserable life. �Open your eyes please.�

&nbsp;

�Please?� he said please! What the fuck was
this? Her eyes snapped open. The bastard was sitting there as if he was
watching a soap opera on TV. No self-respecting dom said �please�.

&nbsp;

�Don�t look at me� he said calmly, but with
a trace of irritation added-�don�t you know anything?� �You�re a well-respected fetish writer
Jessie, you know how this works.� 

&nbsp;

It was the way he said it, something
snapped inside her. With a lunge, she was at him, her heel going into his groin
with all the force she could muster. All her self-defense classes had finally
paid off! Getting her balance, she went to kick him again, almost blind with
rage. This time he turned and grabbed her foot, pulling her off balance to land
flat on her back on the steel deck. This couldn�t be right? He should have gone
down like a sack of potatoes! 

&nbsp;

A short time later, as she lay face down, her wrists and ankles lashed together with
thin cord and a large rubber ball stuffed into her mouth she had the answer to
her unspoken question. �You must think I�m pretty stupid Jessie� he said,
breathing heavily. �I thought you�d try something like that, so I took
precautions.� He stepped back and pulled a large white shield out of his pants.
�I hope you didn�t damage my protector� he said with yet another smug smile.

&nbsp;

�You�re pretty fast with your feet,� he
went on. �You�d make an excellent pony girl. I bet you could run for miles with
a cart behind you.�

&nbsp;

�This time you�ll be punished for attacking
me. I�ve been far too lenient. You can wait here while I think up a suitable
form of discipline.�

&nbsp;

For her part, Jessie was in agony. While
she had been restrained before, this time the ropes were obviously designed to
punish. The cord cut into her wrists and ankles was like nothing she�d ever
felt before. Every movement, every breath was sheer agony. There was nothing
the least bit erotic about this. All she felt was pain. Her back was arched,
her knees burning and her shoulders were on fire. This after
a few minutes. How long was he going to leave her like this? Surely her
shoulders would be dislocated or the tendons torn in her knees. Her hands were
numb and cold and the rubber ball forced her jaws apart at an impossible angle.

&nbsp;

Half an hour later, he came back. �How�s my
little wildcat going?�

&nbsp;

Turning her head, she looked mutely up at
him. Weak noises of protest came from around the ball,
she was in so much pain, even that hurt. �Let me make you a little more
comfortable�, he said with a note of concern in his voice. Kneeling down next
to her, she felt a wave of relief flood over her. Another moment of this, and
she would fall apart.� 

&nbsp;

His hands were at the back of her head. He
was going to take the gag out first- oh thank god! She closed her eyes in
anticipation as his fingers touched the buckle of the hated thing. �Now just
tilt your head back, Jessie.�

&nbsp;

She did so gladly. At that moment she would
have signed her soul to the devil to be free from those burning cords and cruel
gag.� There was no fight left in her-
she�d been kidnapped, tied in a van, manhandled by two�women, locked in a box,
and now hogtied tighter than anyone could bear. At that moment she would have
gladly taken any part of him in her mouth.

&nbsp;

Her reverie was interrupted by something
tugging her head back. Suddenly she was looking at the sky! Out of the corner
of her eye, she saw him stand up, brushing his hands
together as if cleaning dust off them. �There, isn�t that much nicer?� 

&nbsp;

He looked at her as if she was something
scraped off a shoe. �I�ve had it with you Jessie. I�ve tried to be nice and
reasonable, but you just don�t want to know. We could have had so much fun together
if you�d been a little accommodating. Now you can suffer.�

&nbsp;

Suffer? Her eyes flicked wildly back and
forth. �NO!� she tried to say. �Please don�t leave me like this.� Every ounce
of her went into the appeal. This would kill her- didn�t he realise the pain
she was in?

&nbsp;

He squatted down in front of her, and
brushed her hair out of her wide staring eyes. The rope from the back of her
gag pulled the ball deeper into her wide-open mouth. With the other end tied to
her ankles, she was forced into a position a yogi would have envied. Her bones
were cracking with the strain and her neck was bent so much she couldn�t
breathe. �I�m sorry to have to do this to you Jessie� he said, in a tone of
genuine regret. �I know it must be rather uncomfortable.�

&nbsp;

Her mind struggled to cope. He was a total
loony! The pain was such that she found it impossible to struggle or complain.
It just hurt too much. Even blinking was a tremendous effort,
her eyes were forced wide open.

&nbsp;

There was nothing left for her to do, but
lie there unmoving and wet the deck with her tears.

Jessie�s story- Pt. 6

&nbsp;

Time passed interminably for Jessie, her
mind drifting in a state of limbo. The pain was overpowering, it was impossible
to think of anything else. She was completely numb, afraid to move so much as
her fingers. All she could do was try and keep her breathing shallow and
regular. To panic would cause more pain than she could bear.

&nbsp;

All things must eventually come to an end.
This torturous hogtie was no exception- with no warning she felt his hands
freeing her from the rope, which had sunk deep into her flesh.

&nbsp;

Gradually the colour came back into her
hands as she lay curled up on the steel deck. The ache in her jaws began to
recede a little. A lead was attached to her collar, the only thing she now wore
and she was dragged to her feet, shaky and weak. Cowering and hunched over with
the pain and stiffness, she shambled along, helped by the occasional crack from
a riding crop on her bare behind. He steered her ahead of him, into a large
cabin. She noticed the cabin was well furnished, even through the waves of pain
and dizziness that still consumed her. The carpet was thick and soft, the walls
painted in soft tones and the light subdued.

&nbsp;

A huge bed took up much of the space, a
four-poster with a canopy, the design taken from a time long past. It looked
modern and comfortable, though. Guided past the bed, she was guided through a
door, into a beautiful bathroom, again in an old style, but with all mod cons. 

&nbsp;

�Kneel down please Jessie� came his first words since he�d freed her. Without thinking,
she dropped to her knees on a soft mat next to the shower, allowing him to
remove the collar. �Keep your head down� was his next command. The truth was, she was barely able to keep her head up. In fact her only
ambition was to collapse on the floor and pass out. She was completely drained:
all her will and energy lost.

&nbsp;

She felt another collar fitted to her neck
then a light chain padlocked to it. She knew without looking the collar was
locked on. The other end of the chain was locked to a towel rail, and he spoke
to her again. �You can get cleaned up now, ready for bed- you have 45 minutes.�

&nbsp;

The door closed, and she realised she was
alone. In a daze, she made full use of the extensive facilities. The cabinet
had every imaginable item- creams, powders and cosmetics. Everything looked
expensive and excellent quality- the thought crossed her mind that he was
obviously keen on good quality things- he�d appropriated her after all!

&nbsp;

There were towels, but no robe to be seen.
Hanging behind the door was one of the skimpiest babydoll nighties she�d ever
seen. One of the most expensive too, by the look of it.


&nbsp;

With a sigh, she took it down and stepped
into it. She lacked the energy to fight and didn�t seem to feel the urge any
more. It felt good to slide the lacy garment over her battered body. To her
relief, there was even a pair of matching white panties. 

&nbsp;

Steeling herself, she knocked on the door,
and stepped back. A voice in her head urged her to kneel
down- it was as if she was devoid of the will to resist. 

&nbsp;

He made her wait before coming in. Seeing
her kneeling, facing the door, her head bowed, he expressed his approval. �You
look lovely like that Jessie. It was good of you to tell me your sizes. A
shudder ran through her. He knew everything about her- she�d shared things with
him no one else knew. He even knew what foods she liked, and how she liked them
prepared. 

&nbsp;

His hands were on her again, gently
buckling leather restraints to her wrist. He locked them to the chain, which
was hanging down in front of her, so her hands were held between her breasts.
The other end of the chain was unlocked and she felt a tug. �Time for bed my
sweet.� It was as if he�d rescued her from the pain and suffering she�d so
recently endured. 

�Would you like something to eat first
Jessie?� he asked, as caring as any bridegroom on a honeymoon. He looked at
her, as she followed meekly back into the bedroom, head still bowed. As if by it�s own accord, her head nodded. She was hungry, and
something told her not to speak unless told to. 

Deep down inside her something felt right
about this. She was now a real-life slave, dragged forcibly away from her life,
friends and family. Guided into the big bed, pillows were placed carefully
behind her, so she was sitting upright, her wrists joined in front of her, as
if in prayer. 

&nbsp;

The chain was attached to ring in the wall,
giving her enough freedom to lie down, or move about, but not to get out of
bed. Half expecting a butler to come into the room, she was a little surprised
to see him come back with a tray of food.

&nbsp;

�I�ll leave you to eat now, but I�ll come
back soon,� he said in a tone which contradicted his behaviour earlier. Her
mind was starting to think of things by itself- �If I hadn't attacked him, he
wouldn�t have tied me up so tightly.� Somewhere deep inside she was trying to
rationalise his actions. 

&nbsp;

The truth was, she
was too tired to think. All she knew was that she was in a soft bed, with clean
sheets and had a delicious meal in front of her. 

&nbsp;

The chain rattled and clinked as she
transferred the food to her mouth. There was even coffee- not very hot, but
still nice. It was so good, she was starting to feel
normal again. The fact that she was a prisoner didn�t seem to matter any more.

&nbsp;

By the time he returned, she was almost
dozing off, the tray lying next to her on the bed, and her hands up on her left
shoulder. �Just one little thing before bed Jessie� he said, holding up another
pair of leather cuffs. �We�ll just clip your ankles together.� 

&nbsp;

She accepted without protest, shivering at
his touch, as he buckled the cuffs in place and locked them together. The
lights dimmed and she felt, rather than saw him climb into the other side of
the bed. His last words were �Please don�t try anything foolish tonight Jessie.
My patience with you is at an end.� As if she could! She was restrained in
leather and chains, and was drained of all will. Small tremors ran through her
even after she fell into a restless and troubled sleep.

&nbsp;

Next morning she was woken by a tug on the
chain. He had unlocked it from the wall, and was standing next to the bed
pulling on it. In a daze, unable to form a coherent thought, let alone a word,
she struggled to her feet and stood still as he unlocked and removed her ankle
restraints.

&nbsp;

Wordlessly, he took her into the bathroom,
unlocked her wrists and connected the long chain to the towel rail, as he had
yesterday. �Don�t dawdle Jessie,� he said- the first
words he�d uttered since last night.

&nbsp;

With a growing sense of unreality, she
performed her normal morning ritual. The only difference was that the make up
box was now on the side of the sink. As an unspoken hint, it served it�s purpose- once she was finished in the shower, powdered
and sweet smelling, she started applying the cosmetics.

&nbsp;

Her hands shook uncontrollably as she made
her face up. The tissues served the dual purpose of removing smudges and wiping
tears away. She was numb, and found it hard to concentrate on a simple task.
She managed a light foundation, eye shadow and eyeliner. Her cheeks were so
pale, some blush was needed- then one of the lightest colours of lipstick.
Studying herself in the mirror, she was impressed. 

&nbsp;

Still naked, she made a final scrutiny of
herself. As if for the first time, she noticed the shiny collar around her neck
and the chain running down to the floor, with it�s end
locked to the towel rail. She was forced to concede to her own beauty. Her
figure was curvaceous, and her skin smooth. The same face she�d looked at a
thousand times before, seemed to belong to someone
else. �My god,� she thought �I look pretty good.�

�

Swallowing nervously, she turned to the
door, relieved to see some form of clothing hanging, on the hook. Something
resembling a smile appeared as she took it down. It wasn�t the sort of thing
she�d normally wear to the office!

Jessie�s story Pt.7

&nbsp;

She held the costume
up with shaking hands and looked it over. A black shiny
leotard that looked 2 sizes too small, with a white ruffled skirt sewn onto the
waist, which looked a like an abbreviated tutu. 

&nbsp;

The leotard was made
of some sort of shiny material, which looked incredibly thin. The bottom had
lining, but not the top. God- her breasts would be crushed and squeezed flat.
Her nipples would make holes in the thin fabric!

&nbsp;

Something caught her
eye- hanging on the hook behind the door was the same egg that had been
inserted while she was locked in the box. The inference was clear. With a sick
feeling, she took it over to the sink, and opened the tube of jelly so
thoughtfully provided. 

&nbsp;

It was such an
innocent looking thing she mused, turning red as she worked it into herself. A
mental image flashed across her mind, of what would happen if she dressed
without it. Just for a moment, her hand lingered on herself. He eyes closed and
the thought of being held down and having the egg forced inside her seemed
almost inviting.

&nbsp;

Was this what she
really wanted? To be a mindless slave? All her usual
ambitions and aspirations seemed light years away. Walking into a boardroom in
her work clothes seemed unimaginable now. She could feel her heart pounding and
the egg deep inside her, as she began to pull the tight leotard on. Weak at the
knees, she tried to hurry- she could feel time slipping away as she struggled
into it. 

&nbsp;

She glanced at the
door- how long had she been? She was terrified of this guy, there was no
avoiding it. He was so calm and cool, his voice seemed
to seep right through her. The way he looked at her was different to anything
she�d ever experienced. He was so unpredictable, most guys were easy, a smile
and a flash of eyes and they�d melt for her. This guy seemed so unfeeling! It
was like being a piece of meat at the butchers. 

&nbsp;

With a huge effort the
leotard was now up to her hips. Whatever it was made of was unyielding- it was
so hard to breathe already and she still had to get her breasts inside it!

&nbsp;

Her body was quite
well-formed, slim and athletic. She had a membership at two health clubs, but
no amount of exercise had ever reduced the curve of her hips and her breasts.
They were always there, straining buttons and saying �look at me!� She was a
woman, there was no doubt about it- unwelcome attention was a fact of life ever
since she�d been a teenager.

&nbsp;

She slipped her left
arm in the hole and tried to pull the impossible garment up over her shoulder.
As she�d thought, her breasts were being crushed inside it. It was getting hot
now, as she fought her way into the thing, trying to suck enough air into her
lungs. The pressure on her stomach and lungs was like a vice.

&nbsp;

Finally it was on!
Each breath was an effort, lifting her arms up pulled it up into her crotch,
pushing the egg in deeper. A quick adjustment got both breasts straightened up,
with flesh bulging into her armpits. A look in the mirror confirmed her fears-
she looked ridiculous! The body of a 12 year old, with
enormous flattened breasts, her nipples clearly visible. The ruffled
skirt looked like something from a kid�s pantomime, obviously designed to make
her feel like an idiot. 

&nbsp;

Burning with shame,
she knelt down in front of the door and waited. Fragmented thoughts ran through
her head, as she fought for air. The leotard was cutting into her legs and
seemed to have become a part of her. It was so far up her crotch, the egg was
practically in her throat. 

&nbsp;

A thought hit her like
a ton of bricks- she�d been drugged! It wasn�t normal to feel like this, there
must have been something in the food or drink. The feel of the tight leotard on
her bare skin was taking over all her thought processes. The egg was deep
inside her, making its presence felt whether she liked it or not. She should be
outraged- surely being held against her will and forced to be some weirdo�s toy
wasn�t right?

Instead, she was
kneeling on the floor- in fact her head was bowed! It was some sort of relief
to believe she�d been drugged- she wasn�t that easy! Hell, she was a powerful
independent woman- wasn�t she? 

&nbsp;

She tried to breathe
enough for a sigh of relief. That was it, she wasn�t cracking up, it was a drug. Once that wore off, she�d get back on her
feet and come up with a plan to escape from this nut. It was essential to go
along with it, until his guard was down, thinking he could trust her. Then she
would strike! Visions of pushing him over the side into the sea gave her
strength, although there was a niggling thought that surely there was a crew of
sorts.� 

&nbsp;

The time dragged on.
He was deliberately making her wait! Probably sitting in the next room, smiling
enigmatically at nothing, amused at his latest attempt to humiliate her. 

&nbsp;

Eventually the door
opened, and in he came, smiling at the sight. �Gee, that�s a bit tight isn�t it
Jessie. We�ll have to put you on a diet or something!� He was holding another
garment similar to what she was wearing. �Why don�t you put this one on
instead? It�s a bit bigger- you might rip that one.�

&nbsp;

Gritting her teeth, she
struggled out of the accursed costume. Two conflicting thoughts ran through her
head- �just you fucking well wait� and �I have to do this, or�.�

&nbsp;

This was not like her!
A big reason she exercised was so she could defend herself from wackos like
this.

&nbsp;

It must be the
drugs- no asshole was going to capture her, ill treat her and have her go along
with it. She tried to form a question without upsetting him. No sound came out;
it was as if her vocal chords were frozen until permission was granted.

&nbsp;

As she squeezed into
an identical leotard, a half size larger, only this time without the ridiculous
skirt, he spoke. �You may ask a question Jessie. In a calm and polite manner
thank you.�

&nbsp;

�Please, did you give
me some sort of drug? I feel funny.�

&nbsp;

A smile spread across
his face, she could see even out of the corner of her eye. �Oh
no Jessie. You feel like this because I am taking your will away.�

&nbsp;

�You may look at me
for a moment, I want you to hear this.�

&nbsp;

�I intend to break you
Jessie. I am going to drive your will away and turn you into a mindless object.
You are no longer a human being, but a worthless toy, with no purpose other
than to amuse me.�

&nbsp;

His eyes held her in a
sort of trance. Frozen in time and space she stared open mouthed, hypnotised by
his words.

&nbsp;

�Most importantly
Jessie, I will succeed because deep down, you want this more than anything in
the world.� 

&nbsp;

�Now enough chitchat.
Hurry up and get dressed - we�ve got work to do.�

&nbsp;

He unlocked the chain
from the towel rail and led her out. �Put these on as well� indicating leather
items on the bed. She sat down and put on a pair of black leather boots, with
flat toes that reached almost to her knee. The next items puzzled her. She
studied them for a moment- �Knee pads?� 

&nbsp;

Again, he read her
mind- �Yes they�re kneepads. Put them on please.�� Her mind seething with questions, she buckled
them around her knees, then donned a pair of matching
mittens, something like boxing gloves. Once they were on, he bent down and
unlocked the chain from her collar, replacing it with a black leather lead. 

&nbsp;

The mittens were laced
up tight and a black harness gag was pushed between her lips. Once it was
tightened, a yank on the lead pulled her to her knees. Suddenly she realised
his intention. 

�

She was pulled in
front of the mirror-still on her knees �look at yourself Jessie� he said. �Look and feel the shame of your position. You are nothing
more than a mindless slave. You were born to serve and were wasted in your past
life. All that is over now, I intend to train you to be the thing you most
desire.�

&nbsp;

�Before we start,
we�ll just put these on.� �These� turned out to be a pair of Japanese clover
clamps, each with a small lead weight dangling from it. Producing a pair of
scissors, he pulled at the leotard where it covered her nipples and carefully
cut holes for them to poke through. �Look at me Jessie, while I play with your
nipples. I want them hard and red before I apply these clamps.� 

&nbsp;

He looked deep into
her eyes, as he gently pinched and pulled, moistening his fingers without
breaking his gaze. Again, she was hypnotised- it was as if he could see into
her soul, into a dark secret place that had been locked away. Eventually her
nipples were throbbing and sensitised. She involuntarily closed her eyes, and
felt the cold steel of the clamps bite into her. Before she could react with
more than a moan, she was pulled onto her hands and knees, and dragged out the
door with the weights pulling at her breasts.

&nbsp;

�Flicking her on the rump with a small leather
whip, he took up a position behind her, the lead in his left hand. �Now, let�s
go walkies Jessie. 

&nbsp;

As she crawled out
through the doorway, the egg started to gently vibrate.

Jessie�s story Pt. 8

&nbsp;

The ship was nothing like the size of an
oil tanker, but on her hands and knees, it sure felt like it. They went slowly
along one side, up to the bows. Not only was she flicked with the crop for
slowing down, but was constantly reminded to �walk properly�. The leotard had
long since gone right up inside her, leaving her cheeks bare, a good target for
the annoying thing. 

&nbsp;

It was so humiliating. Her cheeks wet with
tears, she tried to keep going, despite the clamps pulling on her nipples. The
weights swung back and forth, hitting her arms, as she struggled along. Every
now and then the egg would start buzzing inside her, a further distraction.
�Keep your head up Jessie� he kept saying. �You�re not concentrating�.� As the tears ran down her face, they combined
with the drool escaping from around the gag. Breathing like a steam engine, her
head spun with the exertion. 

&nbsp;

She was staggering by the time they got up
to the bow of the ship. Her vision was blurred from fatigue and the salty tears.
Why was he doing this? What had she done to deserve it.
She bumped into the steel bulkhead and caught a clamp on the side. The pain
shot through her, bringing her down, to scrabble at the thing which threatened
to pull her nipple off. An inhuman wail came from her, bubbling through a mouthful of saliva. The leather mittens on her hands
thwarted her attempt to remove the hated things.

&nbsp;

As she tried to relieve the agony, all
thought of caution gone, she felt the crop deliver a stinging blow on her
wrist. �Don�t touch those clamps Jessie� he said in a no nonsense voice. �Don�t
forget what happened yesterday.�

&nbsp;

�Now SIT.��
A harder crack on her behind was combined with a pull upwards on the
leash. She found herself on her haunches, knees up, her hands together on the
ground, just like a dog. 

&nbsp;

With stinging eyes and teeth gritted, she
tried to overcome the pain in her nipples. Through the tears, she saw a figure,
leaning on the side of the ship. As it became clear, she saw not one but 3
greasy crewmen laughing at her. They were some sort of eastern nationality, all
skinny and unkempt, one with teeth missing. All had tattoos and each was
watching her hungrily, drinking in the sight of her exposed breasts, with the
clamps dangling from them.

&nbsp;

�Hi guys� her captor said to them- �just
taking the dog for a walk.�

&nbsp;

All three bellowed with laughter, and one
in broken English said �good doggie!�

&nbsp;

This seemed a great joke to them, as she
sat there petrified.� �Stay� said her new
Master, dropping the lead on the deck. 

&nbsp;

He went away out of her earshot, taking the
crew members with him. She could hear the occasional word, not all of it
English, and shivered in fear. He wouldn�t let them touch her�would he?

�

Suddenly, she missed being with him in the
clean cabin on the nice carpet. Last night in the big bed wasn�t so bad- to be
thrown to these filthy wolves just didn�t bear thinking about.

&nbsp;

Her whole body was shaking uncontrollably
when he returned, followed by the crew. �If she doesn�t behave, I�ll let you
boys play with her� he said, picking up the lead.

&nbsp;

�Heel� was his only word, followed by a
pull. Never had a slave obeyed her Master so willingly. All thought of fatigue
or discomfort was gone from Jessie�s mind. Suddenly she was trotting next to
him, head up, looking more like a dog than Lassie ever did.

&nbsp;

It went on for hours, or so it seemed. Her
tears had dried and her only thought was to please. She would damn well trot
around all day, if it pleased him. Besides- this wasn�t so bad; it was a lot
better than the hogtie she was in the day before. 

&nbsp;

All things must end, and this was no
exception. Stopping in front of a bucket full of water, he removed her gag and
commanded her to drink. Once she�d done that, she was ordered to her feet. She
was silent, until he took the clamps off. Instead of removing them slowly, he
looked into her eyes with that same hypnotic stare, and released both clips
instantly. She fell to the ground, with the pain, screaming without realising. Her mittens going to her throbbing nipples. 

&nbsp;

With an amused smile, he watched her
thrashing around in agony. She�d worn them for almost an hour, with the weights
pulling on them her nipples were red and throbbing. Clutching her sore nips she
subsided into moans, and slowly got up again. �Well, that�s enough exercise for
now, Jessie. Let�s go and have something to eat.�

&nbsp;

He took the kneepads off and led her back
to the cabin. Once inside, he removed her mittens, and the remaining
restraints. She stood unmoving, as he peeled the leotard from her shoulders.
After being chafed and tortured by it, she was almost relieved to be naked. 

&nbsp;

Completely free apart from the egg still
insider her, she stood in the centre of the room, the
leering faces of the crew fresh in her mind. To be thrown to those greasy,
disease ridden halfwits was a new horror that seemed worse than anything she�d
experienced so far. Just to have them looking at her was a nightmare in itself.
She had no doubt he wouldn�t hesitate to �throw her to the wolves� if she
continued to displease him. 

&nbsp;

�Stand up straight Jessie. Eyes in front�
he said. His voice was quiet and calm, but the menace was there below the
surface. �I know what you�re thinking, but they aren�t a bad bunch of guys,
really.�

&nbsp;

Despite herself, her head turned and she
focused on him, for a moment, wide eyed. How did he know? 

&nbsp;

�You forget Jessie, I know more about you
than you know yourself� he replied with a smile. �I�ve read every story you
ever wrote. What do you think all those questions were about?� The smile
disappeared, and he flicked her behind with the riding crop. �Don�t look at me
again Jessie- I said stand up straight. Shoulders back, chest out, hands by
your sides.�

&nbsp;

Tears appeared in her eyes, partly due to
the shock of the blow, but mostly because, he really
did know everything about her. That hit home more than anything. She had shared
things with him no one else would ever know.It had
seemed so safe- a guy in Australia!
She�d thought if he turned out to be a weirdo she�d just press a button and
block him from contacting her. She�d told him where she worked without even
thinking about it- just like everything she�d told him. It just slipped out.

&nbsp;

She stood there more naked than she�d ever
been. She�d been stared at by men all her life, but not like this. They were
just looking at her body- this guy looked right into her soul. 

&nbsp;

In spite of all she�d been through since
he�d �acquired her� - this was the worst. To just stand there, too afraid to
move, stark naked while he just looked at her. It was like giving up
completely. What had happened to the confident, self-assured woman she�d been a
few short days ago? Again, she asked herself if this was what she really
wanted, somewhere deep inside her. Some dark place she was afraid to look in.

&nbsp;

A shiver ran through her, and she closed her
eyes, to feel another sharp blow from the crop. Her eyes opened of their own
accord- she was apparently meant to keep them open. 

&nbsp;

�Jessie, if I want you to close your eyes,
I�ll tell you to.�

&nbsp;

She jumped at a knock on the door. �Come
in� said her captor, not taking his eyes off her. A crewmember she hadn't seen
entered, carrying a blue bowl heaped with food. Staring open mouthed at her, he
placed the bowl on the floor under the dressing table. 

&nbsp;

�Here Mohammed, you can put her collar back
on if you like- I�ve been pleased with your work� he said, handing it to the
grubby cook. Too surprised to even smile, the little man came over and buckled
it on. Afraid to touch her, his eyes took in every inch of her nakedness. As
the loathsome creature came around in front of her, she closed her eyes at the
sight, which earned her another blow from the crop. 

&nbsp;

�You can touch her Mohammed, just on her
breasts.�

&nbsp;

Jessie sunk to new depths, as the slimy
little man reached out towards her right breast. Slowly he came closer, his
hand shaking slightly. She could hear his breathing in the silent room and
fought against the overpowering urge to close her eyes. Not once did he waste
time looking at her face.

&nbsp;

His mouth was open and his breath hot on
her neck as he made contact. A clumsy squeeze, his nails digging into her soft
skin and he was gone, leaving her feeling dirty and nauseous. 

&nbsp;

A voice came from far away �time to eat
Jessie.� 

&nbsp;

In a daze she was guided over to the dog
bowl and pushed down on her knees. Engraved on the side of it, was a name-
�Jessie�.

&nbsp;

�This is where you�ll eat all your meals
from now on� she was told.

Jessie�s story Pt.9

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

After she�d finished lunch, to her relief
she was led into the bathroom and locked onto the long chain again. Another shower and an application of makeup as she tried to avoid
looking at what she�d be wearing next. She was finding it hard to
concentrate and had to redo her makeup once or twice. The egg was still inside
her; she was afraid to remove it. It was starting to feel nice in fact- while
it had stopped vibrating some time ago, just having it inside her was quite
pleasant. If fact this whole thing was having a sort of wicked tingly feeling.
Catching sight of her eyes as she made a final check of her face, she was
shocked at what she saw. 

&nbsp;

Was that her? She was an upcoming junior
executive, not some rampant slave! She gazed at herself in a new light. The
transformation was incredible- it was her eyes that gave it away. 

&nbsp;

Her heart was pounding as she studied her
image. That collar around her neck with the chain dangling from it, the makeup
she�d applied, the unseen egg lying quietly inside her. It was then she
realised- she�d made herself up for him! The same asshole
that had taken her away from her life and her friends.

&nbsp;

Suddenly nothing seemed real. There was a
roaring in her ears as she continued to stare at her reflection. No longer was
she Jessica- the cool efficient one. No more was she untouchable. Her hand went
to her bare breast as if by it�s own accord. She could
no longer deny it- she was turned on like she�d never been. A moan startled her
from her reverie. She looked around; refusing to believe it came from her own
lips. 

�

He was standing behind her with that oh so
annoying smile, just watching her face in the mirror. �Yes Jessie, this is your
life now- you are my slave. Your old life is over.�

&nbsp;

She was stunned- how did he come in without
her knowing? How long had he been there? Most of all, how did he know what she
was thinking? She was overwhelmed by the realisation that his words were true-
she was a slave to his whims. The anger she�d felt such a short time ago seemed
to have died away, replaced by a feeling of inner contentment. It was all too
much for her.

&nbsp;

�Stand up Jessie� he said, �while I put
this on you. I�ve got a little surprise for you.�

&nbsp;

The chain rattling, she stood up, keeping
her legs tightly together. All she could think about was the egg inside her-
why didn�t he turn it on for gods� sake? She would have laid
down and let the whole crew have her, to relieve this damn frustration. 

&nbsp;

He buckled a wide belt around her waist,
with another strap attached. Ordering her to open her legs, he threaded the
other strap between her thighs and pulled it up tight, holding the egg inside
her. Leather cuffs were locked onto her wrists and another lock fixed her hands
together in front. As the final padlock clicked, she closed her eyes, giving in
to the sensations of tight leather forcing the egg up inside her. 

&nbsp;

�Open your eyes Jessie.�

&nbsp;

She was led out into the bedroom, where a
rope was tied to the lock between her wrists. He threaded it up through a ring
in the ceiling and pulled until she was stretched upright, on her toes. 

&nbsp;

�Jessie, in honour of you giving yourself
to me, I propose to allow you some pleasure.�

&nbsp;

She seemed to have reached a place where
�giving herself to him� was no longer incongruous. Stretched upright with the
leather straps digging into her naked flesh felt fantastic. His words had sent
a shiver though her body- �some pleasure?� Who was she to complain? It wasn�t
as if she had a choice!

&nbsp;

Her ankles were tied together with a long
rope, then another above her knees and her thighs. Her whole legs were welded
together, with cinch ropes appropriately fitted. Another was tied around her
chest above her breasts, with a knot in her cleavage. The ends went down under
each breast, lifting and separating just like a Wonder bra, to be crossed
behind her back. More strands went above and below, until she was well squeezed
and her breathing restricted. A knot was tied at the back, and all the ropes
pulled together tightly. The ends went over her shoulders and were tied to the
ropes crossing her cleavage. As it was all tightened, both breasts were lifted
with the strain and bulged out delightfully. 

&nbsp;

Yet more rope was used to cinch the whole
thing together, each side of her now bulging breasts, until she began to look
like Dolly Parton. Looking down at herself she couldn�t help but be impressed.
The ropes were neat and tidy, lying next to each other and the knots were just
right. The effect was nothing short of mind-blowing. She looked and felt like a
porn star and felt delightfully compressed.

&nbsp;

Wobbling around on her toes, she watched as
he went out and came back with a glass full of ice cubes. Her nipples, which
already stood out like marbles were treated to much
attention, with ice cubes, tongue and gentle nibbling. Without thinking, she
closed her eyes and moaned at the sensations. 

&nbsp;

His voice was in her ear �Did I ask you to
close your eyes Jessie?� 

&nbsp;

At the same time as her eyes opened, the
nipple clamps took hold. She moaned and tossed her head as the jaws bit into
her tender nipples. After the punishment they�d taken earlier it seemed cruel
to subject them to more. He flicked one of them, and as her mouth opened,
jammed a black ball between her teeth. Straps buckled around her head and under
her jaw forced it in deep and she began to drool over herself.

&nbsp;

The sensations were taking over- dangling
from the ceiling, she swayed around on her toes. Each
time she closed her eyes she received a sharp crack from the riding crop. The
combination of the tight ropes, gag and the clamps were doing something to her.
Her head was spinning and it was so hard to keep her eyes open. 

&nbsp;

The blindfold was such a relief she could
have cried. Her whole being could now concentrate on her feelings of pleasure
and pain. She slipped away into a place she�d never been, where nothing
mattered except what she was feeling. As she began to moan without even
realising, the egg started to gently vibrate, deep inside her.

&nbsp;

Slowly but surely the ship continued its
journey. The vibration of the engines a constant reminder, as it slid through
the waves. The days passed by one by one, as is wont to happen. His crew went
about their business, occasionally catching glimpses of the owners� new slave
and always dreaming.

&nbsp;

Jessie had slipped into another world-
consisting of pleasure and pain, love and hate. Her will became less as time
passed, until she was barely able to remember who she once was. The day she
spent lying on her back on a hard wooden bench, on a blanket had the greatest
impression.

&nbsp;

She was laid down, with her arms by her
sides, and fixed with duct tape. Her head was taped into position, her neck,
shoulders, waist and hips. More went around her ankles, above her knees and
around her thighs. By the time he was finished, she could not move a muscle.
Although her mouth was uncovered, she was unable to utter a sound- all her
effort was taken up with breathing. 

&nbsp;

Left staring at the ceiling, she stayed
there all day, unmoving. The only attention was a trickle of water from the
cook every hour, between her parched lips. By late afternoon she had become
physically and emotionally detached- as if her brain was incapable of thought.
Released from the tape, she was limp and unmoving, as he carried her naked,
sweating form back to the cabin.

&nbsp;

By the time they reached the shores of her
new country, she climbed into the box of her own accord. As the wooden stocks
closed over her wrists and ankles, she felt as if she�d come home again. When
the lid was screwed on, she closed her eyes under the blindfold and slipped
away into a world where only Jessie existed.
