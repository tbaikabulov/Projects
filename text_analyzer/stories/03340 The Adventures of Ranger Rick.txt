Synopsis: Park ranger Rick Breyer keeps the ladies in his neck of the woods out of trouble with the help of his trusty paddle known as "The Tear-Jerker".  THE ADVENTURES OF RANGER RICK  
 There was a gentle wind blowing off the lake. From where he stood in the
  ranger's station, Rick Breyer could see the tips of a thousand Douglas firs
  bending with the breeze. The treetops rolled like a dark green ocean. Rick
  poured himself a cup of coffee and picked up his binoculars. Taking a sip,
  he put the high-powered lenses to his eyes and scanned the woods. Mid-morning
  is a good time of the day for a forest ranger. There's nothing much to do,
  the coffee is fresh and the world looks perfect. His gaze meandered past the
  trees, over the bluffs and across the lake. He focused in on a small trail
  of smoke coming from the southwest corner of the woods. It seemed odd because
  Rick didn't know of any campers out that way. Deciding to investigate, Rick
  threw on his jacket and headed for the door. But before he could leave, he
  was met in the hallway by Dana Bramble who had just walked in. Dana was a counselor
  at Running Bear Summer Camp a few miles away. In their three year association,
  Rick had become more than friends with Dana. She was a buxom, twenty-five year
  old with short auburn hair and a winning smile. She wasn't smiling right then,
  however.  
 &quot;I want to talk to you!&quot; she stated, planting herself between
  the ranger and the door.&quot;  
 &quot;You mean you want to talk at  me, don't you?&quot;  
 &quot;I'm serious!&quot; Dana said. &quot;There's a rumor going around about
  you and that horse rancher from the valley!&quot;  
 &quot;Really? Where did you hear this rumor?&quot; Rick asked.  
 &quot;At the Flat Branch Bar. I heard folks talking about you and that Davis
  woman just last night.&quot;  
 &quot;First of all, her name is Dreyfuss- Letitia Dreyfuss. And what were
  you doing at the Flat Branch? You don't drink!&quot;  
 &quot;If you must know, I was looking for you.&quot; Dana said. &quot;I
  went by your cabin last night and you weren't there, so I figured you must
  have gone into town. Look, don't try to change the subject! People are talking
  about you and that woman and it just doesn't look very... professional!&quot;  
 &quot;Well, what are they saying?&quot; he asked.  
 &quot;What do you THINK they're saying?!&quot;  
 &quot;I don't know. She's a fine looking woman. She's unattached and I've
  been over to her place a few times. Maybe they think we're seeing each other.&quot; &quot;They
  think you're banging  each other! Some say they know it
  for a fact!&quot;  
 &quot;Who says it's a fact?&quot;  
 &quot;Debbie Morrow! Dana shot back. &quot;She's heard all about it!&quot;  
 &quot;Oh, come on! She's a waitress in a bar! She's bound to hear all kinds
  of wild stories!&quot;  
 &quot;Debbie heard this story from Miss Dreyfuss herself! She told Debbie
  that you two had a little meeting in the woods and that afterward she couldn't
  ride her horse for days!&quot;  
 Rick thought about it a moment, then burst into laughter.  
 &quot;It's not funny!&quot; Dana shouted.  
 &quot;It is if you know the whole story!&quot;  
 &quot;So is it true?&quot; she demanded.  
 &quot;Not really. I mean, I didn't give it too her that  hard!&quot;  
 Dana brought her hand across Rick's face so fast that he almost bit his
  tongue.  
 &quot;You bastard!&quot; she hissed as she turned to leave. Rick snapped
  out of his momentary daze and grabbed Dana by the arm.  
 &quot;Hey, wait a minute!&quot;  
 &quot;Get away!&quot; Dana said, trying to slap him again.  
 But this time Rick grabbed her other arm before she could strike. He held
  Dana's arms at her sides as he calmly spoke.  
 &quot;Hold on now. I think you misunderstood.&quot; he said, guiding Dana
  to a nearby chair and sitting her down. &quot;I did run into Letitia in the
  woods the other day and we did have a little meeting, but believe me, it was
  anything but friendly! See, I found her riding her horse near the east side
  of the lake which is way off the horse trail. I drove up and told her that
  it wasn't a safe place for riding and offered to escort her back to the trail.
  She argued for a while then gave me the old one-fingered salute and rode off.
  So I got back in my truck and followed her until I had her cornered near the
  foothills. I was so angry by then that I was thinking about hauling her into
  the sheriff's office, but then I had a better idea. I remembered that trusty
  oak paddle of mine in the glove box, so I decided to give her a taste of the
  tear-jerker.&quot;  
 &quot;You didn't!&quot; Dana gasped.  
 &quot;I did! And you should have seen the look on her face when I came out
  of the truck with that paddle in my hand!&quot;  
 &quot;Did she make a run for it?&quot;  
 &quot;She didn't have time! I dragged her down off that horse and over to
  a fallen tree before she could blink. Then I hauled her over my lap and started
  whacking her fanny. Boy, did she start yelling! Worse than you do!&quot;  
 &quot;I don't blame her!&quot; Dana said, remembering her last encounter
  with that particular paddle. &quot;You spank hard with that thing!&quot;  
 &quot;She deserved every swat she got! Anyway, I paddled her for a good
  minute or two and when I stood her up she was bawling and rubbing her bottom
  like a teenager!&quot;  
 &quot;I bet you liked that!&quot;  
 &quot;Well, she did look awful cute. Not as cute as you, of course.&quot;  
 Rick lifted Dana's chin with his right hand. He leaned in and their lips
  met in a soft kiss. All the tension in Dana's body fell to the floor.  
 &quot;So all you did was spank her?&quot; she whispered as she wrapped her
  arms around Rick's shoulders.  
 &quot;Yeah.&quot; he whispered back. &quot;Then I told her that next time
  I caught her, I'd use my belt. After she stopped crying, she apologized, got
  on her horse and rode away. So she couldn't have been all that  sore!
  She must have been exaggerating when she told the story to Debbie.&quot;  
 &quot;Not only that,&quot; Dana added. &quot;but the way Debbie told me
  the story, it sounded like something completely different happened out in those
  woods.&quot;  
 &quot;There you go, that's how rumors get started. Somebody exaggerates,
  then someone else puts their spin on the story and the next thing you know
  there's a big scandal! I think I'll drop by the Flat Branch this weekend. Let's
  see if Debbie can talk her way out of her own trip to the woodshed!&quot;  
 They both laughed as they shared a tight embrace. Rick picked Dana up in
  his arms and sat her down on the edge of the desk. She wrapped her legs around
  Rick's waist as they kissed once again.  
 &quot;Still mad at me?&quot; Rick asked.  
 &quot;Well, I am  a bit jealous. I thought you made
  that paddle to use on me, not some uppity bitch from the valley!&quot;  
 &quot;Oh, I wouldn't worry about that.&quot; Rick replied.  
 Out of the corner of her eye, Dana could see that Rick was reaching into
  the desk drawer and taking out the paddle in question. She squealed and tried
  to break away, but Rick had already grabbed hold of her left arm. It was a
  short struggle that ended with Rick sitting on the edge of his desk and Dana
  pinned over his lap.  
 &quot;What did you think was going to happen? You slapped my face, you little
  brat!&quot;  
 &quot;I was angry!&quot; Dana explained.  
 &quot;Well, now I'm  angry!&quot; Rick said, lifting
  the paddle.  
 &quot;Wait! You can at least let me apologize!&quot;  
 &quot;You'll have plenty of time for that while you're standing in the corner!&quot;  
 With that, Rick brought the paddle down with a loud smack across the young
  woman's denim-covered bottom.  
 &quot;Oooowwww!&quot; Dana shouted.  
 She started to squirm right away, so Rick got a firmer grip on her waist
  and threw his right leg over her calves. With Dana in a firm scissor-hold,
  the paddling resumed and Rick smacked Dana's fanny with renewed gusto.  
 &quot;Yow! You big bully! Ow!&quot;  
 &quot;Go ahead, get yourself in deeper!&quot; Rick said mockingly between
  cracks of the paddle. &quot;I guess I'm just not spanking hard enough!&quot; He
  started raising the paddle higher and bringing it down faster. Dana noticed
  the increased severity of the blows immediately.  
 &quot;Oh! No! Ow! I'm sorry! Ouch! Hey, I said I'm sorry!&quot;  
 &quot;You'll be sorrier in a minute!&quot; Rick stood Dana up and quickly
  unbuckled her jeans. Stunned and out of breath, all she could do was stand
  and watch as he yanked her pants and panties down past her thighs. The next
  thing she knew, she was back over Rick's knee staring at the top of his desk
  as the paddle began a vicious assault on her bare ass cheeks. Rick held the
  handle of the paddle tightly and swung the flat end with vigor as Dana began
  to kick and cry out loud.  
 &quot;Ooh! Rick, please! Ow! I promise I'll- Ouch! I'll never hit you again!&quot;  
 &quot;Damn straight!&quot; he replied with a volley of swats that quickly
  had Dana begging for mercy.  
 &quot;Owww! Okay! That's enough! Ouch! I'm sorry! I'm really sorry!&quot;  
 Rick ignored her pleas. Instead, he started to concentrate on the lower
  part of Dana's bottom, just above her thighs- an area that Rick liked to call &quot;the
  sweet spot&quot;. After landing swat after swat to that one location for a
  minute or so, Dana was ready to promise anything if he'd only stop. She was
  yelling something to him, but her pathetic blubbering made the words incoherent.
  It didn't really matter to Rick anyway. This little girl had thrown a rock
  at a hornet's nest and now she was going to get stung! He continued paddling
  Dana's bottom soundly as he scolded her for having such a wicked temper.  
 &quot;You get yourself all worked up over nothing!&quot; he said between
  swats. &quot;Then you come up here and explode all over me! Well, you should
  know by now that I don't react well to that kind of behavior! If a man talked
  that way to me, I'd punch his lights out!&quot; He punctuated each thought
  with a particularly hard swat. Her voice too spent to yell, Dana lowered her
  head and whimpered as Rick continued the spanking and the lecture. &quot;Luckily,
  I know how to handle a hot-headed little brat like you! You just need to have
  your pants pulled down and your bottom blistered now and then. I pity any man
  dealing with you who doesn't figure that out!&quot;  
 Rick kept spanking her bottom until it was as red as a radish and her body
  was as limp as a noodle. He then put the tear-jerker down on the desk and pushed
  Dana from his lap.  
 &quot;Now you hustle your hot little buns over to that corner or I'll paddle
  them again!&quot;  
 Dana was already scampering to the corner by the time she hit the floor.
  She tried to run but got tripped up by her panties which were sill bunched
  around her ankles and fell face-first onto the bearskin rug with a loud thud.
  She burst into tears once again and looked over her shoulder for sympathy only
  to see Rick coming at her with the paddle.  
 &quot;You get into that corner!&quot; he growled.  
 Dana kicked off those troublesome panties and scrambled to her feet but
  not before the tear-jerker caught her left cheek with a loud smack. This knocked
  her off balance and she fell forward onto the palms of her hands with her bottom
  high in the air. It was an irresistible target. Rick swung the paddle like
  a polo mallet bringing it across Dana's vulnerable bottom with a powerful smack
  that sent her lunging forward. She dashed for the corner, receiving two more
  stinging swats on the way. Dana then stood in her place and began rubbing her
  bottom with feverish intensity and hopping around the hardwood floor in a manner
  not unlike a Navajo rain dance.  
 Rick walked over and placed his hands on her shoulders.  
 &quot;Now keep that nosy little nose of yours in the corner until I get
  back!&quot; he commanded. Then he ran his hands down from her shoulders to
  her hips. He pressed his midsection against her burning ass. Dana gasped. She
  could feel his hardness pressing into the crack of her raw, aching bottom.
  His hands slid around to cup her breasts. Dana's eyes rolled back in her head
  as she quietly moaned as Rick whispered in her ear. &quot;I'll be gone half
  an hour- maybe a bit longer and if you've moved one step from that spot before
  I get back, you're going to take another trip on the old bare-bottom express,
  understand?&quot;  
 Dana nodded in agreement. Rick picked up his keys and hat, then decided
  to take the paddle along as well.  
 &quot;But if you're a good girl, I'll come back here, bend you over that
  desk and take you from behind the way you like. After that, I think I'll give
  you a hand spanking just as a reminder. Then I'll take you into town for a
  steak dinner. What do you say to that?&quot;  
 &quot;Sounds real good.&quot; Dana said over her shoulder. A big grin was
  coming over her tear-stained face. &quot;Can I rub myself while you're gone?&quot;  
 &quot;Only your backside, honey. I want the rest of you waiting for me.&quot;  
 &quot;Hurry back then.&quot; Dana purred as she ran her hands seductively
  over the reddened cheeks of her ass.  
 Rick's mouth had gone too dry to answer and so he simply headed out the
  door. As he left the ranger's station, something was troubling him- that smoke
  coming from the southwest, near the lake. He called the registration office
  on the radio.  
 &quot;Hey, Pete. Have any campers signed in this morning?&quot;  
 &quot;No, it's been pretty dead today.&quot; Pete replied. &quot;A couple
  of young gals in a jeep drove through this morning, but they didn't check in
  or anything.&quot;  
 &quot;Okay, thanks.&quot;  
 Rick drove to a secluded campsite at the southwest corner of the lake and
  sure enough, there was a campfire burning and a jeep parked nearby. He parked
  his truck near the campfire and looked around. There was a small tent and a
  couple of folding chairs near the picnic table. Apparently, the girls had set
  up camp without signing in. Rick sat down at the table to wait. A few minutes
  later, two attractive young women who appeared to be in their early twenties
  came wandering out of the woods. Neither of them seemed at all surprised to
  see him there. One had short red hair and the other was a brunette with pigtails.
  Rick recognized the brunette immediately.  
 &quot;Jill Windsor!&quot; he said as he stood to meet them.  
 &quot;Ranger Rick!&quot; Jill answered back.  
 She knew that Rick hated that title. Jill Windsor had been camping in Rick's
  neck of the woods for years and knew exactly how to piss him off.  
 &quot;Don't call me that.&quot; he said calmly. &quot;What have you been
  up to, Jill?&quot;  
 &quot;Well, my friend and I were just looking for berries, but we couldn't
  find any, could we?&quot;  
 The redhead nodded &quot;no&quot; with a flirtatious grin.  
 &quot;Oh, this is my friend, Denise. I told her all about you, Ranger Rick.
  I told her all about that time you caught me throwing cherry bombs into the
  lake to catch fish and how you bent me over a log and paddled my ass.&quot;  
 &quot;Yeah.&quot; Denise chimed in. &quot;I wish I could have seen that!&quot;  
 &quot;Uh-huh.&quot; Rick said. &quot;Look, why don't you just go to the
  registration office and sign in? You should have done that in the first place.&quot;  
 &quot;Well, you know how it is, Ranger Rick-&quot;  
 &quot;Stop saying that. You know I don't like it. The last time you called
  me `Ranger Rick', I took a switch to your backside.&quot; He looked to Denise. &quot;Did
  she tell you about that, too?&quot;  
 &quot;Oh, she's told me that one at least a dozen times.&quot; Denise said,
  glancing at her friend knowingly. &quot;And it gets better every time I hear
  it!&quot;  
 &quot;And what about this?&quot; Rick pointed at the fire.  
 The girls looked at each other, smirking.  
 &quot;Uh, what do you mean?&quot; Jill asked with mock innocence.  
 &quot;You know exactly what I'm talking about! You're never supposed to
  leave a fire unattended!&quot;  
 &quot;Oh, but Ranger Rick...&quot; Jill started.  
 &quot;That's it!&quot; Rick said, grabbing Jill by the wrist. She put up
  very little struggle as she was taken to a tree stump and even less as Rick
  yanked her jeans down and hauled her over his lap. Rick started spanking Jill
  with enthusiasm, but even as he swatted her with strokes that made his hand
  ache, she barely moved a muscle. Jill seemed unaffected by the spanking- almost
  bored.  
 &quot;Do me a favor.&quot; Rick said to Denise. &quot;Go get me my paddle
  out of the glove compartment of the truck. It's not locked.&quot; Denise smiled
  and hurried to do as she was told.  
 &quot;What's the matter, Ricky? Can't cut the mustard?&quot; Jill said over
  her shoulder.  
 &quot;Your butt must be a lot tougher than it was last summer!&quot; he
  replied.  
 &quot;It is! You know, you're not the only guy in the world who knows how
  to take a lady to the woodshed! With the right attitude, a brat like me can
  get her wagon painted anytime she pleases!&quot;  
 Denise returned with the paddle. She winked at Rick as she slowly slid it
  into his hand.  
 &quot;Well that may be, young lady.&quot; he told Jill as he yanked her
  panties down to her knees. &quot;But I'm going to give you a paint job you
  won't forget for a long, long time!&quot;  
 With that, Rick slapped her ass with the paddle so hard that even Denise
  jumped with alarm. Jill's mouth dropped open, but before she could cry out,
  several equally powerful swats exploded across her fanny. Jill tried to keep
  her composure in front of Denise, but the heat that Rick was delivering to
  her throbbing ass cheeks was too much to bear silently. With gaining speed,
  the paddle mercilessly struck her burning cheeks. Her hands clawed the dirt
  as she bucked wildly against Rick's lap. She began kicking in a circular motion,
  almost as if she was riding a bicycle and soon she was openly weeping. Denise
  stood by, staring intently as Rick and the tear-jerker swiftly transformed
  her smug, sarcastic friend into a sobbing, remorseful little girl.  
 Just as Jill began to make heartfelt apologies between cracks of the paddle,
  Denise decided to make an announcement.  
 &quot;Actually, I'm the one who was supposed to put out the fire.&quot; she
  said, stepping forward. &quot;So I'm really the one you should be punishing.&quot;  
 Rick looked up into Denise's gleaming green eyes, which looked far more
  hopeful than guilty.  
 &quot;Fine. You're next.&quot; he said.  
 Rick gave Jill's glowing bottom one more resounding swat, then placed the
  tear-jerker on the table and brought Jill to her feet.  
 &quot;There! I guess you got what you wanted! Now, pull your pants up!&quot;  
 Still out of breath and crying, Jill hiked up her jeans and buckled her
  belt. Rick lead her over to a nearby tree. He turned her around so that her
  bottom was pressed up against rough bark. &quot;Stand right here and don't
  budge.&quot; he told Jill, wiping a tear from her cheek with his thumb.  
 Rick then turned to Denise who seemed quite resigned to her fate.  
 &quot;I guess it's my turn now.&quot; Denise said, kicking off her boots
  and unbuttoning her jeans.  
 Slightly confused, Rick watched as the young woman wriggled out of her denims
  and then folded them neatly on the picnic table. She stood before the ranger
  in nothing but a plaid flannel shirt and white ankle socks. Noticing Rick's
  bewilderment, she looked at the jeans and then at him.  
 &quot;You were going to take them off anyway, right?&quot;  
 She then calmly padded up to Rick as he sat himself back down on the stump.  
 &quot;Now, will I be getting one of those cute little hand spankings or
  will you just go straight to the paddle?&quot;  
 Rick knew when he was being teased and it always seemed to cause a bad taste
  in his mouth.  
 He thought about the situation for a moment, then grabbed Denise around
  the legs, tossing her over his left shoulder. He stood as he did this and grabbed
  the paddle from the table. He then began swatting Denise's bottom vigorously.
  Her shirt had fallen down over her head leaving her backside no protection
  whatsoever. Again and again Rick whacked the young lady's naked ass as she
  kicked and twisted helplessly over his shoulder. He walked around slowly as
  he continued to soundly smacking her rump. Rick seemed to be marching to the
  beat of the paddle as he slapped it against one cheek and then the other. Then
  he stood still and performed a two minute drum solo on Denise's rosy cheeks.
  All the while, Denise's shouting and cries for help were muffled underneath
  that thick flannel shirt.  
 &quot;Is this as much fun as you thought it would be?&quot; Rick laughed
  as he relentlessly swatted the helpless girl's bright red bottom. After a while,
  Denise managed to pull up Rick's shirt tails and began to claw at his back
  with her nails. Seeing that this position had its drawbacks, Rick swiftly headed
  for the edge of the lake and dumped the scratching little wildcat into the
  shallows. He walked away, leaving Denise thrashing around in the water and
  yelling at the top of her lungs.  
 Rick walked up to Jill who was now laughing hysterically.  
 &quot;Do you  want to take a swim?!&quot; he said,
  pointing a threatening finger at her.  
 Jill quickly stopped giggling.  
 &quot;No, sir!&quot;  
 Rick went over to the picnic table, grabbed one of the two tin coffee mugs
  sitting there and handed it to her.  
 &quot;Then go fill this up in the lake and douse the fire until it's completely
  out.&quot;  
 &quot;With this?&quot; Jill complained. &quot;It'll take fifty trips!&quot;  
 &quot;So get your friend over there to help you!&quot; Rick said, handing
  her the other cup.  
 Jill took the two mugs to the edge of the lake. She gave one to Denise and
  explained what they were to do.  
 &quot;What?!&quot; Denise shouted as she marched out of the water and up
  to Rick. &quot;You know, you could have drowned me!&quot;  
 &quot;I dumped you in two feet of water, you little twerp! Now, go help
  your friend put out the fire, because I'm still pissed off and my arm isn't
  tired at all!&quot; Rick waved the paddle at her as he spoke.  
 It took the young women a dozen trips apiece to put out the fire, but they
  worked swiftly and without complaint.  
 &quot;Good job.&quot; Rick said when they were finished. &quot;Now if you
  ladies want to camp here, that's fine. Go sign up at the registration office
  and pay the ten dollars. If you don't want to do that, I suggest you haul your
  rosy little bottoms out of my park, because I'll be back tomorrow and if I
  find you're still here without signing up, I'm going to assume you both want
  more of the same. Okay?&quot;  
 Both women agreed to these terms. As Rick headed back to his truck, Denise
  grabbed the tear-jerker from the picnic table and brought it to him.  
 &quot;Don't forget this.&quot; she said and kissed Rick full on the mouth.  
 Their tongues met for an instant before Rick gently pushed her away.  
 &quot;That's enough of that.&quot; he said, smiling.  
 As he drove off, Rick could see Jill and Denise waving to him in the rear-view
  mirror. He thought momentarily about what he would do if he were a few years
  younger. But it was time to get back to the station. Someone very special was
  waiting for him there.
