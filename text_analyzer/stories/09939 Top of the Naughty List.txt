Top of the Naughty List: A Christmas Tale.
By Ninja5
Liz awoke a fraction before the dawn.&nbsp; The gentle glow light that was visible just before the sun rose stirred her.&nbsp; She laid naked on her coach the static of the TV indicating the movie she&#8217;d fallen asleep watching had ended.&nbsp; She was very hedonistic, being nude made her feel luxurious.&nbsp; A smirk came over her lips as the memories of last night came back to her.&nbsp; She remembered the carolers who came seeking donations for the handicap.&nbsp; She&#8217;d let them sing two songs before closing the door on them without a donation.&nbsp; She remembered Billy calling, begging her to take him back, and threatening to harm himself if she didn&#8217;t.&nbsp; �Silly Billy�, she whispered without giving any thought to his well being.&nbsp; For Liz Christmas was a day away from everything.&nbsp; A day to play with her favorite vibrator and enjoy some alone time.&nbsp; She rose to get some coffee and was startled by the red figure in front of her.
�Merry Christmas Liz.&nbsp; You&#8217;ve been a very naughty girl.&nbsp; In fact, you&#8217;ve topped the naughty list.�&nbsp; The fat man with a white beard, dressed as Santa Claus, let out a Jolly laugh.

Liz replied by screaming.&nbsp; Then, as if by magic her voice vanished.&nbsp; She inhaled deeply and tried again, but only a hiss of escaping air came.&nbsp; Panicked she starred at the intruder, her legs frozen in terror.

�Now Liz we can&#8217;t have you screaming, there are sleeping children next door.&nbsp; You know the ones whose snowman you pushed over when you came back from drinking last week.�&nbsp; The man winked at her and there was, without mistake, an actual twinkle from his eyes.&nbsp; �I&#8217;ll tell you what Liz, I&#8217;ll give you your voice back and let you ask a question.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t waste it though; it&#8217;s the only one you get.�

Liz felt coolness return to her throat, she took one more gasp of air and with a shaking voice pleated, �Who�� who are you?�

The man replied with more Jolly laughter.&nbsp; �That was a waste.&nbsp; Not interested in what going to happen to you?&nbsp; Why this is happening to you?&nbsp; Is there any way to get out of it?�&nbsp; The man shook his head.&nbsp; �The answer is quiet obvious Liz.&nbsp; I&#8217;m Santa Claus, and I&#8217;ll give you this for free, you&#8217;ve been a very naughty girl.&nbsp; The naughtiest in fact.&nbsp; Billy hanging himself last night with Christmas lights put you over the top, so now you have to come with me.�&nbsp; As he finished speaking the old, fat, man lunged forward with amazing dexterity and grabbed Liz by the throat.&nbsp; Liz choked for air and her eyes pleaded for mercy, her delicate fingers clutching at his strong wrist.&nbsp; With his free hand he clapped a pair of cuffs to one of her wrists.&nbsp; Santa pushed Liz away, spun her around and wrenched the handcuffed wrist behind her back.&nbsp; He grabbed her other arm and again latched her free wrist.&nbsp; 

Unable to protect herself Liz found herself being dragged to her chimney.&nbsp; Liz let her legs drop, trying to increase her weight, but it didn&#8217;t seem to faze the surprising strong man.&nbsp; As they reached the apex of the chimney Liz entire body jolt with acceleration; her ears popped, and the next thing she knew she was standing on her snow covered roof.&nbsp; A large red sled and eight Reindeer waited in contrast to all that was sane.&nbsp; Santa pushed Liz towards it and again let out a Jolly laugh.&nbsp; As they approached the closest Reindeer, Santa presented her to him.

�Look here Prancer.&nbsp; The naughtiest of the lot.�&nbsp; He shook Liz to attention.&nbsp; Liz felt the animal&#8217;s warm breath on her naked body as it sniffed her.&nbsp; The Reindeer shook its head in disgust and growled, exposing sharp predatory teeth not at home in an herbivore.&nbsp; Liz would have screamed, but her voice was gone again.&nbsp; Santa picked her up, like a groom carrying a bride across the threshold and carried her to the back of the sled.&nbsp; With a mighty heave he tossed Liz in back.&nbsp; She landed hard on some empty sacks.&nbsp; Santa mounted the sled and let out one final jolly laugh before shaking the reins.&nbsp; The sled glided of into the air with miraculous speed and escaped on the horizon, just as the first fraction of the sun appear on the horizon.



The sound of bells and hearty cries of �Mush.&nbsp; Mush.&nbsp; Onward my friends� were the only sounds to keep Liz company.&nbsp; Frantically she tugged on the handcuffs behind her back in a desperate attempt to get free.&nbsp; As they travelled on there ever shortening trip Liz&#8217;s mind baffled with what was happening to her.&nbsp; Was she really being taken to the North Pole by Santa?&nbsp; What was going to happen to her?&nbsp; As if in answer to her question Santa turned back to look at her in back and said.&nbsp; �You only had one question Liz.&nbsp; The rest is one big mystery that will soon be solved.�&nbsp; As Santa turned back he gave one final clap with his rein and the sled tilted down to the coldness below.

The descent shallowed and with a jolt the sled made a whooshing noise and it began gliding along snow.&nbsp; Liz was jolted around the back; the panic was growing stronger inside of her.&nbsp; Tears began flowing down the side of her face.&nbsp; The chill of the air bit into her skin.&nbsp; She was covered in Goosebumps.&nbsp; Santa let out a �Ho Ho Ho. Merry Christmas.�&nbsp; Though Liz could not see where they came from, high pitched cheering came from all around.&nbsp; The sled came to a halt.&nbsp; Liz heard tiny footsteps all around.&nbsp; Santa launched himself out of the sled.&nbsp; �My friends.&nbsp; My friends, everything went according to plan.&nbsp; Every good boy and every good girl is going to have a little piece of magic this morn.�

Liz could hear excited giggles and suddenly tiny heads appeared peering down at her as she lay freezing in the back of the sled.&nbsp; She stared in bewilderment and fully formed people the size of children watched her silently with mischief in their eyes.&nbsp; �Oh now, back.&nbsp; This is for Santa, his reward for another year&#8217;s good service.&nbsp; Back now.&nbsp; She may be naughty but there&#8217;s no reason scare the dear thing.&nbsp; She&#8217;ll be plenty scared soon.�&nbsp; As Santa leaned over and started lifting Liz out of the sled the elves scattered about.&nbsp; �Got to get this cute damsel to my wife.�&nbsp; Liz was forced to her feet.&nbsp; The cold snow on her soles burned.&nbsp; �Come now my dear; let&#8217;s get you some place warm.&nbsp; To Mrs. Claus and her kitchen.�&nbsp; 

Liz still didn&#8217;t have her voice.&nbsp; Tears ran down the side of her face as she walked completely exposed towards a log cabin with a smoking chimney.&nbsp; The Elves giggled and pranced around her.&nbsp; She felt the guiding hand of Santa gently pushing her towards the cabin.&nbsp; Liz was afraid of what was inside, but also needed to get out of the cold.&nbsp; One elf stopped dancing around, raced in and pinched her bare buttocks.&nbsp; Liz winced as she felt tiny sharp nails dig into her flesh.&nbsp; Santa just chuckled.&nbsp; She was pushed to the door which Santa promptly knocked on.&nbsp; Almost immediately the door opened and an astounding figure stood welcoming.&nbsp; The woman had the same twinkle in her eyes and was far from menacing.&nbsp; Only her complacence with Liz&#8217;s nude bondage made her scary.

�Another successful year Mr. Claus?�&nbsp; She woman spoke standing aside for Liz and Santa to enter.

�Another successful year.�&nbsp; Liz was gently nudged in through the door to the surrounding warmth.&nbsp; From the inside the lodge appeared to be a rustic cabin, equipped with a giant wood fuel oven which blazed creating warm.&nbsp; Liz was still afraid, but was no longer tortured by the cold.&nbsp; Mrs. Claus pulled out a wooden chair and signaled for Liz to sit.&nbsp; As she did so, she could feel the attention her stark form was getting intensify.

�So this is the naughtiest of the lot.�&nbsp; Mrs. Claus said as Liz hunched on the chair.

�That she is.�

�Why is it that they are always so pretty?�

�I&#8217;ve always believed that being desired for so little effort makes them cold to others feelings.�&nbsp; Santa said like a grandfather imparting wisdom.

�I suppose it makes no difference now.&nbsp; She&#8217;ll be in the oven soon enough.�&nbsp; Liz&#8217;s eyes bulged and she tried to object but her voice was still gone.&nbsp; She began to stand up, but Mrs. Claus grabbed her shoulders and pushed her back into the seat.&nbsp; She tugged at her binds and began to cry.&nbsp; Santa began to laugh his famous laugh and Liz&#8217;s turned from horror to pleading.&nbsp; �There, there, dear� Mrs. Claus stroked Liz&#8217;s hair as she panicked.&nbsp; �Every year the soul of the naughtiest one is given to Santa and I so that we may continue to live.&nbsp; It&#8217;s just unfortunate or you that the ritual involves eating you alive.�&nbsp; Mrs. Claus spoke calmly.

Liz struggled hard now, thrashing against the elderly woman.&nbsp; Santa twirled his finger in the air and Liz felt her tense muscles relax, paralyzed.&nbsp; She slumped helpless, still fully award and able to feel.&nbsp; Mrs. Claus leaned in a lifted Liz, much the way Santa had when he loaded her to the sled.&nbsp; She lifted Liz unto the table and caressed her breast.&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t think we&#8217;ll be needing the cuffs anymore dear.�&nbsp; Mrs. Claus commented to her husband, and as if by magic they dropped from Liz&#8217;s wrists.&nbsp; Mrs. Claus produced a giant roasting tray and laid it besides the weeping Liz.&nbsp; �Oh dear, don&#8217;t be like that.&nbsp; Think of all the magic that will happen next year for your sacrifice.&nbsp; Think of all those happy children.�&nbsp; Mrs. Claus&#8217; words did not comfort Liz.

As Santa sat in an armchair smoking a pipe Mrs. Claus began oiling Liz&#8217;s helpless form with herbed butter.&nbsp; When she was finished she produced a silver dish of stuffing.&nbsp; Liz panted as Mrs. Claus began packing it into Liz&#8217;s vagina.&nbsp; The entire time she was being prepared Mrs. Claus gazed down a Liz with loving, happy eyes as if she were a grandmother giving her a treat.&nbsp; Mrs. Claus lifted Liz onto the tray belly up.&nbsp; Her arms and legs were placed in a natural position and Mrs. Claus stepped back to admire her work.

�I think she&#8217;s ready for the oven Mr. Claus.�&nbsp; She said to her husband.

�Righto� Santa replied, putting his pipe down and getting up to help his wife.&nbsp; The pushed the large oven door open and Liz could see the flames over her glistening breasts.&nbsp; �Don&#8217;t worry Liz, its magic wood from here at the North Pole.&nbsp; You will be cooked, but not consumed by the heat.�&nbsp; Santa meant it reassuringly, but it only intensified the terror Liz now felt.&nbsp; One either side, they raised the tray and carried it to the oven.&nbsp; Liz could feel the radiant heat on her toes, then her claves.&nbsp; The tray rested on a rake.&nbsp; She opened her mouth and would have screamed had she a voice.&nbsp; It was intolerable, her feet exposed to so much heat and she was unable to move them out of the way.&nbsp; Unable to struggle and resist.&nbsp; Santa and his wife looked at each other loving and with a final heave, pushed the tray all the way into the oven.&nbsp; Liz&#8217;s mind screamed in silence.


�Smells good.�&nbsp; Santa mused as he read an article on the Elf Union in the Polar Gazette.&nbsp; Now that the busy season was over he could catch up on current affairs.

�She&#8217;s almost done.&nbsp; Just a few minutes more and we can pull her out.�&nbsp; Mrs. Claus was knitting another scarf for one of her house Elves.

�You know during the year, the planning gets to me, but every year on this night I&#8217;m reminded of exactly why I do this job.�&nbsp; Santa turned the page.

�All those smiling children and the joy you bring.�&nbsp; Mrs. Claus said without looking up from her knitting.
Santa frowned at his wives ineptitude from behind the paper.&nbsp; Best not to correct her he thought.


Inside the oven the heat thrashed against Liz&#8217;s body, raping her delicate skin.&nbsp; For hours she&#8217;d been in agony.&nbsp; The fire, true to the Claus&#8217; claim, had not burned her; but all the same she could feel herself cooking.&nbsp; Liz prayed to faint; for shock to numb her, but the intense heat surrounded her in a constant frenzy with no escape.


A timer bell sounded.&nbsp; �Well, that&#8217;s it them.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s get her out.&nbsp; The jolly pair rose and placed oven mitts on their hands.&nbsp; As a team they opened the door and began removing the tray with the helpless Liz.&nbsp; They placed her in the centre of the table.&nbsp; Steam drifted up from her golden brown body, carrying with it a delicious scent.

�We should let her cool for a few minutes.&nbsp; Why don&#8217;t you give her back her voice so she can say prays.�&nbsp; Mrs. Claus said, looking expectantly at her husband.

Santa stared hungrily at Liz&#8217;s beautiful flesh eager to start his feast.

�Husband.&nbsp; Her Voice.�&nbsp; Mrs. Claus said again.
Santa shook himself from his hunger and broke the spell.

�Please.&nbsp; Please, I&#8217;m sorry.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll be good.�&nbsp; Liz was crying as she lay cooling on the table.&nbsp; �I&#8217;ll be a good little girl from now on I promise.�

Santa clicked his fingers and Liz&#8217;s voice was gone again.&nbsp; �No, not interested in praying.�

�They never are.�&nbsp; Mrs. Claus said in a comforting voice.&nbsp; �But it&#8217;s important to give them the chance.�&nbsp; The pair sat down either side of Liz on the table.&nbsp;&nbsp; �Don&#8217;t forget to say grace.�&nbsp; She added.

�Dear Lord, we thank you for the task you have set before us; and for this gift of immortality.&nbsp; As we consume her tender flesh we welcome another year of blessings.�&nbsp; As Santa finished he looked at his wife.&nbsp; She stared back at him.

�Amen� she said.

�Right.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s eat.� Said Santa and leaned forward placing his teeth over Liz&#8217;s closest nipple.&nbsp; He bit down.&nbsp; �Hmmmmmm� he said tearing away.&nbsp; The flesh was tender it just gave way.&nbsp; �She is so succulent.�

Now Mrs. Claus leaned in over Liz&#8217;s toned belly, sinking her teeth in just right of her navel.&nbsp; �Ohhhhh.&nbsp; Delicsious.�

Liz lay helpless staring up at the ceiling.&nbsp; One tear after the other flowed from her still eyes.&nbsp; She could feel her flesh giving way to their teeth and hear the lustful consumption.&nbsp; It seemed to last for an eternity.
