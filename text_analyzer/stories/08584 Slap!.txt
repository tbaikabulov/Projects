Synopsis:     John gets slapped by his school crush Rachael. The slap awakens his masochistic side, but also raises doubts about Rachael's intentions.






Author Note: I had this idea the other day. I used to know this girl in High School. I remember she used to be really abrasive, and a couple of times, we&#8217;d be talking, and I&#8217;d say something bad about her, and she&#8217;d slap me &#8211; all of this good-naturedly. Looking back on it, I can&#8217;t help but wonder. So, I thought I&#8217;d explore the idea, and see where it took me. This is the result. 

And yeah, the animated comedy mentioned here is basically a combination of South Park and other such programs, with a superhero type theme. I think it&#8217;d be pretty funny, and I&#8217;m with Rachael. Captain Erecto all the way.&nbsp; 

Slap!

John and his friends hated Physical Education (P.E. for short). It was their final year in High School, and after suffering through four years of the hellish class, they would take any opportunity to ditch. Luckily for them, they had a great opportunity to skip that most dreaded lesson, because this year was their final exams, and they needed all of the time they could to pass one particular class.

That class was an advanced, college level course of Information Technology. Their school had granted them leave of P.E. (an exam they weren&#8217;t taking) in order for them to focus more on passing this advanced course of I.T. John and his friends couldn&#8217;t have been more eager to ditch &#8211; even though, technically, they didn&#8217;t need the extra study time. Instead, they spent the time they should have been in P.E. hanging out and relaxing in the I.T. room. It became sort of an unofficial lounge for them. 

I bet you&#8217;re thinking, �but surely they had a teacher there to monitor them�, but you would be wrong. Oh, their I.T. teacher did stop by every now and then to check on them, but she was a relaxed, easygoing person who pretty much left them to their own devices, even during regular I.T. lessons.

On one such afternoon, John and his friends stood at the back of the I.T. classroom, discussing the latest episode of their favourite animated comedy &#8211; Flash Power Super Brothers. 

&#8216;And did you see how Dynamite committed suicide this episode?&#8217; Andy said with a grin. &#8216;That was priceless. The best so far this series, no doubt.&#8217; Andy was a lanky kid with long, permanently dishevelled brown hair.

&#8216;Yeah,&#8217; Mike agreed, &#8216;but the best thing about last nights ep was when the Masked Thruster challenged Flash to a crotch thrusting contest.&#8217; He laughed at the memory, his chubby face crinkling in mirth.&nbsp; 

&#8216;You guys are forgetting the most important part,&#8217; John intervened. &#8216;The unquestionable star of the show &#8211; the Abusive Marshmellow. I don&#8217;t know how they do it, but his insults are hilarious.&#8217;

John himself was short &#8211; perhaps even the shortest in their year &#8211; but slim. He was one of those people that can stuff their faces with junk food and not put on a pound. He had short blond hair and was one of the few boys in school who didn&#8217;t apply liberal amounts of gel every day. His face still had that boyish look, round and babyish. 

&#8216;Always about the Marshmellow,&#8217; Mike and Andy complained at the same time, a habit they had seemingly picked up after years and years of friendship.

&#8216;You boys are all wrong,&#8217; a new voice said. Rachael Burton joined them, towering over even the lanky Andy. She was skinny, which only made her appear even taller, and had her red hair tied in a ponytail at the top of her head. &#8216;The highlight of the show was definitely Captain Erecto. How can you not love a guy who can leap tall buildings with a single erection?&#8217;

&#8216;Ugh,&#8217; her friend Jodi said in disgust. &#8216;How can you watch that show Rach? It&#8217;s just a bunch of fart and dick jokes.&#8217;

Jodi was what most would consider a Goddess. All the guys in the school loved her. She was blonde, perfectly proportioned, and had the kind of blue eyes that resembled the ocean, or a clear blue sky. 

Most in the school agreed, out of the two girls, Jodi was the hot one. Rachael was just her friend, a sexless annoyance if you ever wanted to date her. 

John disagreed. He could see how most would view Jodi as the prize of the two, but they didn&#8217;t really see. He did. Rachael was just as beautiful, and plus, she was cool. She watched silly shows like Flash Power Super Brothers and wasn&#8217;t afraid to talk about it in public. 

&#8216;Don&#8217;t take thing so seriously Jodi,&#8217; Rachael said. 

&#8216;There is no way Captain Erecto is the star of the show,&#8217; Andy argued. &#8216;He&#8217;s not even a regular.&#8217;

&#8216;So?&#8217; 

&#8216;So how can he be the star if he&#8217;s only in the show every other episode, if that?&#8217;

&#8216;Quality over quantity, that&#8217;s how.&#8217; 

&#8216;I&#8217;ll talk to you later Rach,&#8217; Jodi said, obviously not interested in the way this conversation was going.&nbsp; 

&#8216;Yeah, okay,&#8217; Rachael replied, before turning back to confront Andy. &#8216;You think anyone else has the staying power that Captain Erecto does? There&#8217;s a reason he&#8217;s still in the show, even though he was originally only slated for a three-episode arc. And I hear they&#8217;re making him a season regular next year. So what do you say to that?&#8217;

Andy shrugged. &#8216;I can see why you&#8217;d like him though.&#8217;

&#8216;What&#8217;s that supposed to mean?&#8217;

&#8216;You know,&#8217; Andy said teasingly, &#8216;Captain Erecto. A guy who can enlarge his penis to any size. Surely I don&#8217;t have to spell it out.&#8217;

&#8216;Are you calling me a slut?&#8217; Rachael demanded, her tone harsh, but her eyes playful. 

John sighed and exchanged a look with Mike. Andy and Rachael regularly got into bickering catfights. He was a little jealous of how easily they interacted. John struggled to speak to Rachael most of the time.

&#8216;Took you long enough to get it.&#8217;

Slap! Rachael struck Andy right across the face, not hard, but enough to make a loud noise. &#8216;Say it again, I dear you.&#8217; 

&#8216;Slut!&#8217; 

Slap! Man, she&#8217;s fast, John thought. Her hand moved so quickly Andy didn&#8217;t have time to block, even though he tried. 

&#8216;Alright,&#8217; John said, moving in to break things up. 

SLAP! He got slapped for his troubles. And for whatever reason, Rachael had decided to slap him a lot harder than she was slapping Andy. 

&#8216;Ow,&#8217; he complained, &#8216;what was that for?&#8217;

&#8216;Stay out of my way Johnny.&#8217; Rachael warned.

Andy was retreating now, practically running away from the tall angry woman. Rachael smiled like a predator as she stalked him. Mike laughed and followed, egging Rachael on as she chased Andy around the I.T. room. 

Left behind, John rubbed his stinging cheek, trying to make sense of the funny feeling in his stomach. What was that feeling? He wondered. It wasn&#8217;t. . . It couldn&#8217;t be. . . arousal? He was getting aroused from being slapped by Rachael? 

&#8216;Okay,&#8217; he said, glad no one was around to witness this embarrassing turn of events, &#8216;that&#8217;s pretty pathetic. Note to self - get a new crush.&#8217; 

* * *

That night, John turned over in his sleep, burying his head in his pillow. He was dreaming. In his dream, Rachael had him naked and lying on his bed. She slowly stripped as he lay there staring at her. He was very familiar with this dream. He&#8217;d had it several times before.

As she revealed more and more of her beautiful body to him, his erection stirred to life. He couldn&#8217;t take his eyes off her. Dream Rachael had massive tits and a sweet, shaved pussy &#8211; John&#8217;s ideal feminine figure. 

She approached him, swaying her hips, and smiling seductively. When she reached the bed, she crawled up his body, her eyes never leaving his face. Her gorgeous full breasts brushed against his erection. She settled herself above him, bare pussy poised, his large (bigger than it was in real life, certainly) penis in perfect position to impale her. She ran her hands up his chest, teasing his chest hair, until her hands cupped his face. Then she kissed him, shoving her tongue forcefully into his mouth. He replied in kind. 

Next she would descend onto his erection and ride him to completion. 

However, this time his dream was a little different. At the part where she usually fucked him senseless, she broke the kiss, smiled at him playfully, and then slapped the taste out of his mouth. She didn&#8217;t just slap him once. She continued to slap his face, forward and backhand, building a steady rhythm, a gorgeous smile of pleasure on her lips. 

In the dream, John did nothing to stop her.

Dream Rachael giggled as she slapped him, as hard as she could, stinging his cheeks and leaving them bright red. She began to moan as she slapped him, her body quivering as if in orgasm, her eyes closing and mouth opening in erotically charged pleasure. And yet, her hands continued their assault, first one side of his face, and then the other, back and forth without fail. 

Finally, with a scream of pure ecstasy, Dream Rachael exploded in orgasm, and collapsed atop him.

His eyes opened, and he realised he was awake. His body was covered in sweat. His sheets stuck to him uncomfortably. And. . . worse of all. . . his crotch felt sticky. He threw his covers aside and examined his boxers. True enough, a large wet patch decorated the front.

&#8216;Really, really need a new crush.&#8217;

He climbed out of bed, pulled the soiled underwear off and tossed them in the laundry basket, and then stumbled his way across the hall into the bathroom. A few swipes of tissue and he was relatively clean. He made his way back to bed, wondering what was wrong with him. Normal guys sex dreams didn&#8217;t usually involve their crushes slapping them silly until they orgasmed. 

&#8216;Face it Johnny, you&#8217;re a freak.&#8217;

And yet, he couldn&#8217;t deny what his body and mind were trying to tell him. His arousal earlier, his dream tonight, both pointed to the fact that he found being slapped by Rachael to be extremely erotic. Yes, it was weird, but he wasn&#8217;t the type to live in the state of denial.

&#8216;I love the thought of being slapped by Rachael,&#8217; he whispered quietly to himself. Saying it out loud helped a little. 

But now what? He wasn&#8217;t comfortable talking to her before, when he&#8217;d just been a normal guy with a crush. Now. . . he didn&#8217;t know what he was. It probably didn&#8217;t help his chances. Who would want to date a guy who liked getting slapped? 

&#8216;She slapped me harder than Andy,&#8217; he said, the thought suddenly occurring to him. Did that mean something? He laughed a little to himself. &#8216;Maybe she just doesn&#8217;t like me.&#8217; Or maybe she really does like you. After all, don&#8217;t they say girls are meaner to guys they like? He shook his head. Nah. That&#8217;s just playground kid stuff. We&#8217;re teenagers. We&#8217;re more mature than that. 

Aren&#8217;t we?

* * *

John still hadn&#8217;t managed to figure it out by the time morning rolled around. He&#8217;d spent most of the night considering it, and so he was a little sluggish in the morning. He pondered over cereal, not paying attention to what was going on around him.

Now that he thought of it, Rachael did seem to enjoy being mean to him. She often pushed him, not hard, but little shoves that sent him into doors or other people. Afterwards she would laugh and tease him about it. He never complained. Any attention he got from her was welcome in his eyes.

Did that mean she did like him? 

He couldn&#8217;t be sure.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

&#8216;You okay dude? You look a bit out of it.&#8217; Mike asked in English.

&#8216;I&#8217;m fine. Just thinking.&#8217;

&#8216;Okay.&#8217; Mike never pushed for information. He knew if John wanted to talk he would.

John glanced over at Rachael. She sat a few rows ahead and to the left. Her red hair was down today, hiding her face. She had such pretty hair. Shaking his head, he got back to work. Maths was only two hours away, and in maths, their asshole of a teacher used a seating chart. Normally, that would have annoyed John, who always liked to sit with friends, but not this time, because this time it meant he got to sit next to Rachael. 

Maybe he could find someway to figure out what was going on in her head. Or he could just ask her. . . 

When he got to maths, he was almost too eager to sit down. Rachael was already in her seat. He went to sit, but she casually nudged his chair with her foot. His butt missed the seat and he fell crashing to the floor. The people already in the class laughed, as did Rachael, as he climbed up, trying to hide his face in embarrassment. He sat down, staring at the desk, trying to ignore the throbbing in his ass. 

&#8216;Sorry,&#8217; Rachael whispered, &#8216;I couldn&#8217;t help myself.&#8217;

&#8216;Yeah,&#8217; was all he could think to say.

&#8216;You should be more careful when you sit down,&#8217; she teased. 

&#8216;I&#8217;ll try and remember that.&#8217;

&#8216;Are you mad at me?&#8217;

John looked at her, more of a peak really, out of the corner of his eyes. She was smiling softly, but he detected a faint hint of concern in her eyes. Or am I just deluding myself? He thought.&nbsp; 

&#8216;No,&#8217; he said. &#8216;I&#8217;m not mad.&#8217;

John definitely saw relief this time. &#8216;Good.&#8217; 

He swallowed, trying to shore up his courage. He had to know how she felt, and the only way was to ask. &#8216;Rachael?&#8217; His voice quivered &#8211; how embarrassing. 

&#8216;Yes John?&#8217;

&#8216;Why. . . why did you slap me, yesterday?&#8217;

&#8216;I told you,&#8217; she replied, &#8216;you got in my way.&#8217;

&#8216;But. . .&#8217;

&#8216;But what?&#8217; He glanced at her again and her eyes bore into his questioningly.

&#8216;But you hit me so much harder than Andy,&#8217; John finally managed to get out.

&#8216;Oh.&#8217; He saw her look away. Was she nervous as well? Why did she want to hide her face? &#8216;I suppose I did, didn&#8217;t I.&#8217; She was quiet for a while. He didn&#8217;t know what to say. &#8216;Did I hurt you?&#8217; Her voice finally broke the silence.

&#8216;No,&#8217; John said automatically, but then stopped, and clarified. &#8216;Yes. It hurt. It stung.&#8217;

Rachael turned her head back to face him and giggled. &#8216;Aww, did the mean girly hurt your poor wickle face?&#8217;

Her words and tone brought a fresh blush to his cheeks. He looked at his hands, tightly clenched before him. He was speechless as he attempted to make sense of her actions. One minute, she seemed genuinely sorry that she had hit him harder than Andy, and then the next she was mocking him for it.

&#8216;Don&#8217;t be a wimp,&#8217; she said. &#8216;It was just a little slap.&#8217;

&#8216;I know,&#8217; he replied. &#8216;That wasn&#8217;t my point.&#8217; He suddenly realised she hadn&#8217;t actually answered his question. Had she been trying to distract him? &#8216;Why did you hit me harder?&#8217; 

She pursed her lips and shrugged. &#8216;Why do you care?&#8217;

&#8216;I&#8217;m just trying to understand.&#8217;

She laughed lightly. &#8216;It was just a slap.&#8217; And yet her eyes darted to the left when she said that. She was uncomfortable with this conversation. She had been ever since he brought it up. Her attempt to embarrass him had been an attempt to bring an end to it. He recognised that now. But why would she be uncomfortable?

He took a deep breath to prepare himself. He wasn&#8217;t good at confrontations. &#8216;I don&#8217;t think it was.&#8217;

Her eyes narrowed. &#8216;Okay. What do you think it was then?&#8217;

&#8216;I don&#8217;t know. I just know you&#8217;re uncomfortable talking about this. Why don&#8217;t you tell me why?&#8217;

She thought for a moment. &#8216;I don&#8217;t want to talk about it here.&#8217; She glanced behind them, to where Joe and Sally sat, in hearing distance.

Odd, he thought, but okay. &#8216;Where then?&#8217;

&#8216;Meet me after school.&#8217;

&#8216;And you&#8217;ll tell me then?&#8217;

She just nodded her head slightly.

&#8216;Okay.&#8217; 

John found it was very hard to sit next to her for the rest of the lesson. He was desperate to know what was going on in her strange head. She obviously didn&#8217;t want anyone else to hear what she was going to tell him.

The end of school couldn&#8217;t come fast enough. He was so hyped up to hear what she had to say that he was waiting for her outside the school gates practically as soon as the bell rang. He tried to catch his breath as he waited. Andy asked me him if he was coming over to his house and he begged off. 

Everyone else had left when she finally came out alone. She walked up to him with a sour expression on her face. Had she been waiting for it to quiet down?

&#8216;Come on then,&#8217; she said.

John had to jog to keep up with her longer stride. She was so much taller than him. She led him to an out of the way park and sat down on the swings. He stood in front of her as she swung lightly.

&#8216;So?&#8217;

&#8216;So what?&#8217;

&#8216;Aren&#8217;t you going to answer my question?&#8217;

&#8216;What if I don&#8217;t want to?&#8217;

Okay. Maybe this would be more difficult than he thought. Why was she being so stubborn?

&#8216;You promised.&#8217;

&#8216;Actually, I didn&#8217;t,&#8217; she corrected smugly.

&#8216;Then why did you meet me outside?&#8217;

She looked away with a sigh. &#8216;You don&#8217;t want to know.&#8217;

&#8216;I do.&#8217;

&#8216;You don&#8217;t.&#8217;

&#8216;Do.&#8217;

&#8216;Don&#8217;t.&#8217; 

&#8216;Do.&#8217;

He saw her lips quirk, even as she was trying to hide her face. &#8216;Do you want another slap?&#8217; Her tone was harsher than her expression.

&#8216;Okay.&#8217; The word left his mouth before he could even think about what it was he was saying. He flushed a little at the slip, but didn&#8217;t back down as she met his eyes, her own showing confusion. 

&#8216;Did you just say okay?&#8217;

&#8216;If I did?&#8217; He tired very hard to keep his nerves out of his voice.

She stood up from the swing so she was standing right in front of him. &#8216;You want a slap?&#8217; Her eyes held a challenge.

Here goes, he thought. All or nothing. He dug deep, found the courage, and said, &#8216;sure.&#8217;

So she slapped him. This slap was even harder than the one before. It jerked his head to the side and stung mightily. He stared at the ground for a moment, and then met her eyes.

Rachael smirked. &#8216;Did you like that?&#8217;

&#8216;Yes.&#8217; 

Her smirk turned into a smile and she laughed. &#8216;Unbelievable.&#8217;

&#8216;What?&#8217;

&#8216;Nothing,&#8217; Rachael replied quickly. &#8216;Are you doing anything right now?&#8217;

&#8216;Standing here with you,&#8217; John said.

&#8216;Don&#8217;t be a smart ass,&#8217; she warned, but smilingly. She reached out, a little hesitant, and then took his hand. &#8216;Come on. I want to show you my house.&#8217;

John had to make quick steps to keep up with her as she pulled him along, out of the park, and west, heading towards her home.&nbsp;
