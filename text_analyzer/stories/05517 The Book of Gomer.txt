The Book of Gomer

&nbsp;

This is written in the style of the Old
Testament Prophets, and is based on the crimes for which they condemned both
Judah and Israel.�� The name Gomer is
taken from the wife of the prophet Hosea who was an adulteress, but should be
understood as being a different character entirely.�� Necessarily, much of this is embellished,
even invented, but the basic principles of ceremonial prostitution and human
sacrifice were denounced by the Prophets as having been practised in the reigns
of the worst Kings of Judah so I have used my imagination and some of the
gorier passages of the Bible, to concoct this pastiche.

&nbsp;

PC Disclaimer: Everything here is based
on genuine biblical texts, and I make no claims about
what the pagan worshippers of the ancient Middle East actually did in their
ceremonies!

&nbsp;

�1
The word of the LORD came to his prophet in Jerusalem: 

2 &quot;Your sister, the adulteress Gomer, wife of Jehom (who lived in
Lachish during the reign of King Manasseh), will come to you and seek your aid,
but your door shall be closed to her;

3 For I shall make her an example of the fate of
Jerusalem for her sins.&quot;

&nbsp;

4 Gomer lay with her husband's neighbour,
even with his manservant, and allowed them to use her 5 as though
she were a prostitute and not the honoured wife of a righteous man.�� 6 She thought that she could hide
her sin against her husband, but was found out as she cried her evil to the
heavens in her passion.

&nbsp;

7 Then Jehom took his wife and said to her,

&nbsp;

����������� 8 &quot;Though you have
sinned against me, yet I cannot bear for you to suffer the
fate that the LORD decrees; 9 but the priests do not follow the
detestable practices of the King, and will insist on it.�� 10I will send you away and you
may seek your own way.&quot;

&nbsp;

11 So Gomer fled from Lachish with nothing,
for Jehom would not suffer her the things he had given
her, not even the clothes she wore.�� So
she went to Jerusalem, where her brother was a prophet of the LORD.

&nbsp;

12 But the prophet did as God commanded him
and did not offer her shelter, or clothing, or food to eat but cast her out on
the streets.�� 

&nbsp;

13 &quot;Is this the love a brother shows his sister, even in her hour of
need?

14 Where should I turn now, if not to my own kin, when all others have
left me?&quot;

&nbsp;

15 And the word of the LORD came to the
prophet and he told Gomer,

����������� &quot;This is what the LORD says,

����������� 16 'When you married you
took a new kin,

����������� You took him as your own, to be your
lover and protector

����������� 17 Yet you turned away
from the one who loved you and went chasing his servants and his neighbours as
though they loved you more.

����������� 18 But where are they
now?�� They have used you and gone their
way.�� They will be found out and
destroyed just as you have been.

����������� 19 O adulterous woman, how like my people of Judah you have been, and how
like your fate will theirs be.'&quot;

&nbsp;

20 And Gomer trembled at these words, for
she did not know what they meant.

&nbsp;

21 The wickedness of King Manasseh, is it
not recorded in the annals of the kings of Judah?�� In every high place and under every
spreading tree the people of Judah committed their
lewdness and detestable practices.�� 22
So Gomer went to the temple to offer herself, for she did not know where else
to go.�� 23 And because she
was still young and beautiful, she was accepted.

&nbsp;

2
Gomer became a prostitute of Baal, and offered herself fully to the service of
the Baal-worshippers as commanded by Mannaseh himself.

&nbsp;

2 In the temple, the house of the LORD,
they committed their iniquities with her, 3 to test that she had
treasures to give that would serve well.��
And the high priest told her, &quot;kneel!&quot; and she knelt.�� 4 Then he commanded, &quot;open your mouth!&quot; and she opened her mouth.�� 5 Then he shed his priestly robes
and his manhood stood out before him.�� 6
When Gomer had seen the manhood of her lovers who had used her and abandoned
her, they had been nothing like this.

&nbsp;

7 In fear she leaned back, saying,
&quot;That is more than I can take, it will tear me apart!&quot; 8
but the high priest of Baal laughed and said that she would be cast into the
valley of Ben-Hinnom if she could not serve him well.�� 9 And he took her by the hair as
she knelt before him.�� 10 The
other priests took her arms and pressed them to her back, so that she could not
move or struggle, but must take what was dealt out to her.�� 11 And the high priest forced his
length into her mouth so that she must suck on it.�� 12 Truly, he did not stop at her
mouth, but reached her very throat so that she would choke each time he drew
back and entered her throat again.�� 13
Though her tears were many and her humiliation great, there was no mercy for
Gomer until the high priest was fully satisfied, 14 and she had to
swallow what was dealt to her.

&nbsp;

15 This is what the LORD says:

&nbsp;

&quot;Will I not give up my adulterous people to the
worshippers of Baal, even as Gomer was given up to the High Priest?�� 

16 My people have gone astray!�� 

They have offered themselves to all, like prostitutes
they have offered themselves!�� 

17 And, even as Gomer offered herself, will not the people to whom Judah
made her offer prove to have greater manliness, and take far more than was
offered?�� 

18 Everything that my people flaunted, as Gomer
flaunted everything, it will be taken, and so shall my people be punished for
their sin.&quot;

&nbsp;

19 When Gomer had proved her ability to
serve, by swallowing the High Priest's seed, she was taken by the priests to
the high places to serve in the worship of Baal.

&nbsp;

20 On the alter they laid her, and with
strong vines they bound her arms and her legs so that she could not cover
herself, 21 but her lewdness was on display to all who came
there.�� 22 Her thighs were
spread wide and all could see her pink flower.��
23 Her supple breasts were uncovered and open to all.�� 24 The other prostitutes were
laid all about, as the defiled people of Jerusalem gathered.

&nbsp;

25 All who gathered there lay in their
nakedness and used the prostitutes as their wives, but the priests only used
Gomer.�� 26 She cried out as
the High Priest entered her, and raped her with his manhood, but her protests
were as nothing because she had offered herself.�� 27 His size overwhelmed her and
she was stretched and bruised.�� 28
Her screams were the music of the worship, they were
the psalms that the sinful people of Jerusalem offered to their false
gods.�� 29 Each scream only
lifted the lustfulness of the priests and the men as they slaked their thirst
for iniquity in worshipping Baal with vile deeds.

&nbsp;

30 When the High Priest was finished with
Gomer, he withdrew his spent manhood, but the evil was not spent.�� 31 To consecrate her body to the
Baal, they brought out lashes of leather and staffs of supple wood.�� 32 Her tender breasts they
whipped; her vulnerable flower they punished, 33 her body was beaten
and lashed until every patch was covered 34 with the marks of the
priests' cruelty.�� And her cries were
like the psalms they offered to their false gods.

&nbsp;

35 Then they untied her and turned her over,
36 and now her beaten sore breasts were pressed against the altar
and her back was exposed, her thighs and arms stretched wide as before, 37
and then they continued until every patch of her back and her behind was as red
as her front.�� 38 And the
iniquitous men were driven to a frenzy and used their
prostitutes as never before.�� 39
And the screams were like the psalms that they offered to their false gods.

&nbsp;

40 Then each of the priests took Gomer and
used her as their prostitute 41 until she had taken each of them in
her body and in her mouth, and she was exhausted.�� 42 They left her overnight as a
symbol of their worship for the starry hosts.

&nbsp;

43 This is the depth of Gomer's
sinfulness!�� This is the evil that was
in her heart!�� 44 For she did
not wish for her freedom, but longed for the next time that she would be used
to worship Baal.�� 45 Did she
not learn from her rape?�� Had the
punishment no effect?�� 46 No!
for still she preferred her sinful ways!

&nbsp;

3.
So it came to pass that the king heard of the lustful prostitute of Baal and
came to partake of her himself.�� 2
Such was the corrupt nature of Gomer's heart, she had
swallowed so many men that she had no trouble pleasing Manasseh with her
mouth.�� 3 But he was not
satisfied.�� But Gomer was so corrupted
that she gladly spread her legs for him and he entered her and used her
again.�� 4 Then the king rose
and left her leaking his filth.

&nbsp;

5 The king declared, &quot;This woman will
be an offering to Baal at Ben-Hinnom, for she is too fine for men, she shall be
made an offering.&quot;

&nbsp;

6 The priests were dismayed by this, for
they were glad of Gomer's body and enjoyed using her, 7 but they
could not argue with the king.�� So they
offered her to him 8 that they might persuade him to choose a
different offering.

&nbsp;

9 The King took her back to his bedchamber
in chains, and there he did as he wished with her.�� 10 He whipped her breasts until
they bled: never had she been so whipped before!�� 11 He pressed the hot coals
against her skin, even to her soft flower, delighting in her screams.�� 12 He punished her most severely
until even with her wicked heart she wept for her pain.

&nbsp;

13 Then she knew that he would not stop
until he had taken her completely.�� 14
He used her not as a man uses a woman, but as a man uses another man.�� 15 Her darkest hole was not safe
from him but he pressed his manhood against it 16 until she gave way
and she screamed as she was raped from behind.��
17 Her scream was of pain, and of
humiliation 18 and was music to the king's ears.�� 19 Nothing could she keep from
her attacker, no place would be secret from him, nothing private.�� 20 All would be ransacked!�� 

&nbsp;

21 And the King left his seed in her bowels
as he had left it in her mouth and her flower.��


&nbsp;

22 Then he kept her in chains in a dungeon,
in bondage to him.

&nbsp;

23 This is what the LORD says: 

&nbsp;

&quot;Jerusalem is the prostitute of all prostitutes:

She has lain down in the high places with any who
come to her.

24 She has shown all her wares so she has nothing to hide and no shame!

She shall face the fate of Gomer.�� 

25 Everything shall be taken from her, she shall be given in exile and
everything shall be destroyed!�� 

Her humiliation will be complete, her devastation
absolute.

26 In that day, there shall be no mercy for the sinful people of Judah, 27
from Babylon will come the ravaging sword that will
invade every secret and tear her down.�� 28 For she has angered me and cast doubt upon my
name.&quot;

&nbsp;

4.
After seven years the King grew tired of Gomer.�� 2 But when she would have been
sacrificed to Baal, Jehom came from Lachish 3 and he came to the
home of the man of God and said, 4 &quot;where is my wife, your
sister?&quot; and the man of God told him all that had taken place.�� 5 And Jehom went to the King and
pleaded for his wife.�� 6 The
King was cruel but because he had no more use for Gomer, he released her to her
husband, 7 and she was taken back into Jehom's arms.

&nbsp;

Jehom said to
her, 8 &quot;You should have been put to death, but I thought to
spare you.�� 9 Yet I see now
that you could not escape punishment.&quot;��
10 And Gomer wept and tore her clothes and begged Jehom for
forgiveness.�� 11 Jehom took
his wife to him and said, 12 &quot;You are my wife, and you will be
my wife, and that is all there is.&quot;

&nbsp;

13 This is what the LORD says:

&nbsp;

&quot;After
seventy years I shall lift my people from their bondage in a foreign land, from
their exile I shall gather my remnant.�� 

14 O Judah, what is impossible for man, I
will do.�� 

15 You will be restored, my bride again with
a virgin flower.�� 16 Your
splendour shall be restored!�� 

17Never again
to be cast down, never again to be used and cast into darkness.

18 Yours shall be the everlasting light of
the LORD, in righteousness always, for you are my chosen.&quot;
