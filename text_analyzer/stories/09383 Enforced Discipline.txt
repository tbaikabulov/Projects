ENFORCED DISCIPLINE

CHAPTER 1.

Cynthia duly arrived at Edward Lassiter's school, a small but ultra-select establishment in a beautiful but lonely part of the Maritime Alps, which catered for awkward girls who required correction and training. As such, it had been chosen by Mrs. Partington, Cynthia's stepmother to receive her for a period. 

Though some twenty years of age, the girl had been a source of worry and trouble to her stepmother and this had culminated her activities in becoming involved in a divorce case, narrowly escaping being charged as co-respondent and only just avoiding a flood of unwholesome publicity. Mrs. Partington had furiously reacted to her stepdaughter&#8217;s foolishness - the more so because she was in high hopes of remarrying herself - and the startled Cynthia had been given a blunt ultimatum: either a stay of some months at her cousin's school, with it's reputation for strictness, or a similar or even longer spell us an inmate at one of the establishments run by a religious order, which had the reputation of being downright harsh. Though disinclined to either, the rattled girl was not averse to being absent for a while, and so she eventually chose to go to school with "Uncle" Edward, of whom she had some recollection from years back, rather than face the bleak harshness of the nuns. 
 
So it was that not many days later, she presented herself at the school. One large and several smaller buildings heavily walled around outwardly it appeared normal set in wooded country and without any sign of nearby habitation. It looked secluded enough secluded enough for anyone&#8217;s taste. She had been picked up at the airport by a car and the driver had handled her bags; so her journey to the school had been smooth and easy. 

Once inside an oldish, smart woman who introduced herself as Madame Jeunesse, the Matron, met her. This lady informed her that Edward Lassiter was absent and would return in a few days. In the meantime she would be shown to a room and would be required to change into the school uniform. A maid would attend her. Cynthia was shown to a small room. This was sparse and barely furnished, but adequate. She unpacked her cases and had begun to put her things away when, after a knock on the door, a young woman in maid's attire entered. 

"Good afternoon, Mam&#8217;selle," she said in excellent English. "I am Jeanette, your maid while you are here." 

Cynthia returned the greeting and summed her up. A few years older than herself, Jeanette was of typical French stock - though much smarter than most - of medium height and rather stockily built, pleasant enough but with no particular pretensions to good looks. She was very dark. 

Jeanette went on: "I am to be in complete charge of you, Mam&#8217;selle, as Madame has no doubt told you - so you will be required to obey any instructions that I give you." Cynthia nodded. 

Once Cynthia was settled in, Jeanette required her to change into school uniform and this was done. 

The tall girl contemplated herself in the mirror when she had effected the change and conceded that it had not been for the worse.&nbsp; The basis was a grey silk dress with a high military-type collar. The dress fitted her figure closely to the waist and then flared out to a not-over- long skirt. Sheer dark stockings and high-heeled shoes completed the attire. It showed a tall, well-formed girl to advantage, and such Cynthia was. 

For several days life was completely uneventful. Cynthia was not confined to her room but she did not venture beyond the enclosing walls, limiting her movements to the buildings and gardens. The place was seemingly near- deserted; only a few people were about and no girls at all.&nbsp; Jeanette, who accompanied her at times, explained that this was due to the fact that they had all departed for their homes for the long summer vacation only a few days before her arrival. Thus it would be many weeks before she saw anyone of her own age. She gathered from Jeanette that they were mostly two or three years younger than she. She looked like being lonely for a while

Then one evening, Jeanette said: M'sieur Le Patron has returned and will see you in the morning." 

The next day Jeanette led Cynthia to a room some distance from her own. It was empty as they entered. With interest the girl gazed around her. It was lofty and spacious, with a large roll-top desk in one corner, well-filled bookshelves along one wall and various other items of furniture in the shape of chairs and a table, The place seemed to be a combination of study and office, a fact, which Jeanette confirmed, saying that M&#8217;sieur Edward would be along in a few minutes, the maid left. 

It was in fact after only a minute or two that Edward Lassiter entered to greet his new' guest&#8217;.

Cynthia regarded him soberly. Though not unacquainted she had not seen him for some years.&nbsp; Tall, dark and in his middle thirties, quite good looking, she thought very lithe and virile.

He seated himself while the girl stood. They chatted for a, short while, and then Edward began to talk of her stay with him. Briefly he ran over some of the rules to be obeyed &#8216;the-basic restrictions' and so forth. 

"You are probably aware that there are no other girls here, just now,ï¿½ he said. "The long vacation has just begun, so you will not see any for weeks. So your treatment can proceed without any distraction." He went on: "I. don't want you to think that you are a complete prisoner here. I don't run a concentration camp, though it can be very hard at times. There will be a day off from time to time, and we can go into town or you can come down to the beach with me." 

"We will begin tomorrow morning. Jeanette will prepare you as necessary. I might as well explain to you that Jeanette will be much more than a maid to you while you are here. She will in effect be my deputy and you must regard any instructions or orders from her as emanating from me. Do you understand, Cynthia?" 

The girl nodded. "Yes, that is clear enough," she replied. 

Later that evening she dined with him and found him charming and courteous host. 

The next morning Cynthia went through a range of exercises including running and weight lifting under the direction of Jeanette.&nbsp; After which the Frenchwoman towelled and groomed Cynthia&#8217;s lithe body and limbs.

"I will dress you and then take you to M&#8217;sieur Lassiter," announced the maid as she tossed the towel aside. 

Taking a pair of sheer stockings she drew them on to Cynthia's legs and secured them with a pair of thin, black dress garters. Then she shod the girl's feet with a pair of black shoes with unusually high heels. Finally pair of mid-arm length black leather gloves was drawn on to her arms. Apart from these items, Cynthia was still quite naked. 

The young Frenchwoman stood back and regarded her handiwork with satisfaction. "Good," she smiled. Mam&#8217;selle presents a ravishing picture." 

The 'ravishing picture' was rather puzzled - she was also quite hungry, having had no breakfast - but the maid offered no explanation. 

Instead, Jeanette went to the door and held it open. Now come with me, Mam&#8217;selle," she ordered. 

"What!!! Like this? N-n-n-naked?" queried the startled girl. 

"Certainly, Mam&#8217;selle," replied the maid. "You have to obey me, you understand?" 

Cynthia hesitated for a brief moment and then shrugged her shoulders. Still wondering, however, just what this lot portended, she stepped through the opened door and then let the maid pass in front of her to lead wherever they were headed.

They did not go in the same direction as before. A somewhat more circuitous route was traversed along several passages until they came to a short flight of stairs, beyond and above which, in the facing wall, was a closed door. 

"Please stand here, Mam'selle, facing the wall," ordered the maid, after the pair had mounted the stairs and halted by the door.&nbsp; She indicated a place just to one side of the doorframe, so that anyone entering or coming out would have to pass right alongside her. "That's right, about a foot from the door-frame." 

"Stand fully erect, Mam&#8217;selle," she went on. "Legs together and quite straight, arms straight down the sides, head up, chest out - you call it 'at attention', yes?" 

Cynthia obeyed. There was nothing unusual in all this except her nakedness. Jeanette was satisfied with her stance. 

"In a few minutes M&#8217;sieur Lassiter will come up the stairs and pass through the door," said the maid. "You just stand absolutely still as he dues so, not speaking, either. He may speak to you before passing inside. After e has closed the door, count one hundred fairly slowly, ay a couple of minutes, and then knock on the door, open it without waiting for an invitation, go in and stand to attention before him. Is all that clear?" 

Cynthia was blushing at the thought of standing naked in front of Edward Lassiter, but she nodded. "Yes," she replied. 

"Good "smiled Jeanette "Then I will leave you."

Leaving the naked girl standing facing the wall, the maid turned and passed down the stairs, to vanish along the corridor

A few minutes later Cynthia heard footsteps approaching ~ the heavier, measured tread of a man. Still standing perfectly still as directed, she quivered at the thought of his eyes upon her bared body; her ripe bottom twitched in response. Without speaking, Edward came up the stairs passed. through the door, closing it behind him. 

The girl explicitly followed her instructions. She counted to one hundred and knocked on the door, opened it assed through into the room to stand before him, once at attention. 

She noticed that the room was light and airy - one side was wholly French windows, which were open, revealing a balcony outside and a small, well-enclosed garden. The room was almost bare save for a writing desk at which he sat.

For his part Edward regarded the naked girl before him with appreciative interest. Cynthia was tall and of extremely fine figure. Long legs tapered up into long, lithe full thighs. She was quite small waisted, but not too big of hip; the round of these and the firm flatness of belly -the latter well endowed with the fuzz of her prominent love-nest. - making a fine picture of young womanhood. Above the waist her torso was made prominent by a splendid pair of breasts. Large and full, they were erect and high to an unusual degree, their perfect roundness admirably surmounted and accentuated by the pink, flinty nipples. 

'Good morning, my dear," he smiled at last. "You look extremely smart and beautiful." He went on: "Now stand facing the wall.ï¿½ He indicated a place to one side of where he was sitting. ï¿½As you were standing when I passed you in the corridor. Silently, the girl obeyed.

Edward was thus enabled to gaze upon the charms of her presented rearward portions. Cynthia was quite broad- shouldered and thus, with a slim waist, her back made a beautiful triangle, with ï¿½firm flesh and muscle, straight and strong. Below it she presented to his appreciative survey a really fine bottom. Not over-large perhaps, but certainly not small, its flawless proportions displayed '- two rounded, firm, full buttocks with a deep cleft between.&nbsp; Edward&#8217;s delighted scrutiny lingered on this area with joyous concentration. 

Little did the naked girl, quivering with suppressed emotions to her sharp awareness of his burning gaze, realise just what his unconcealed interest in her splendid backside really portended in terms of possible pain to come 

For a good hour this scene was unchanged. Edward seemed busy with affairs of administration, to judge by the quantity of papers that he was dealing with, so he largely his task of writing, only occasionally pausing to Late the vision of flesh beside him. For her part Cynthia held her posture and position very well. She made no sound and hardly any movement during this long and boring spell. 

Eventually Jeanette reappeared, bringing with her a luncheon trolley bearing a selection of food. 

ï¿½Stand easy for a while," laughed Edward. "You are very hungry no doubt, so tuck in. At any rate we wont starve you here.ï¿½

Eagerly the hungry girl obeyed, and for a while she ate and relaxed.&nbsp; She was surprised to find that she was not particularly embarrassed by her nakedness while she did so, Then Jeanette removed the trolley and Edward ordered her back to her rigid position, but this time facing outwards from the wall.

Thus time passed and at mid-day the young Frenchwoman reappeared to take Cynthia to her room for an hour's rest. Towards two' o'clock she showered her young charge and &#8216;dressed&#8217; her as before, then led her back to the same room where she had partaken of her long stint at attention during the morning.
 
Edward was already there. The three then passed the open windows on to the balcony. This was only a few feet above the ground and was without a handrail. Very close to the balcony and set on the flagged pavement beneath it was an unfamiliar wooden erection, which attracted Cynthia&#8217;s attention. 

Edward smiled and indicated the device. "This is an adaptation of an old but long superseded military punishment he explained. "In Oliver Cromwell's day it was it was known as the wooden horse - not the continental wooden-horse, which was the rack - the idea is that the 'rider' sits astride the apex of the wooden triangle with a leg down each side and with a weight then attached to each ankle.&nbsp; In the old days the weights were heavy bundles of muskets and ruptures were common, which was one reason this penance was replaced by flogging in the reign of Charles the Second as the standard method of maintaining discipline. As such I find it useful now and again for the older and stronger girls, but we run no risk of inflicting injury.

In your case you can ride the wooden horse for an hour with five kilograms on each ankle and for the second hour the load will be doubled to ten kilogram&#8217;s.&nbsp; That will be quite enough for you, especially as an initiation.ï¿½

Cynthia listened to this ominous recital with palpable dismay.&nbsp;&nbsp; If this was to be her 'treatment' on the very first day, what would she have to endure in the weeks and months to come? She trembled at the thought. 

Jeanette now took charge. 

ï¿½Come with me, Mam&#8217;selle," she ordered, walking down steps from the balcony to the flagged garden below. Meekly, Cynthia followed and with the maid mounted steps to the platform alongside the wooden horse. 

ï¿½Sit astride, Mam&#8217;selle," commanded Jeanette and helped the naked girl to place herself on the angle of the boards with a leg down each sloping side. As the hard edge dug the softness of her ripe pussy under her not inconsiderable weight, Cynthia winced and gasped and braced herself with her hands to ease the strain - but obviously that was allowed! 

ï¿½Hands behind your back, myself," ordered Jeanette and reluctantly Cynthia obeyed; to have her gloved hands handcuffed behind her. In such plight there was now no chance of relieving herself. Her preparatory work now completed at the top of the steps, the maid descended to the ground. 
 
She had not yet finished, though. Jeanette now attached to each ankle a weight-carrier, which in itself made up the initial load of five kilogram&#8217;s on each leg. The nude girl distinctly felt the extra burden on her pubes. Jeanette finally mounted the steps to place upon the head of the helpless girl a coolie style hat, as she would be fully exposed to the rays of the strong sun.&nbsp; Descending to the flagstones again, she pulled away the steps so that the wooden horse and its voluptuous rider were standing apart.
 
Edward had meanwhile seated himself comfortably in a long, low chair with his feet up, in the shade only a few feet away from the naked Cynthia, and from where he could contemplate the spectacle before him as Jeanette departed. The lovely flesh was already moist with sweat; it gleamed as she moved and quivered. Little gasps came from Cynthia's lips; already her nest felt as though it was slowly splitting!!!
