Synopsis: Presenting a modern retelling of an old Scottish folktale. This would be one of the stories of Tam Lin the Fey trickster. You may find it a relatively mild story for this site but one of rape, mind control that raises the question of what is �What is the true nature of evil?�.

Scottish Popular Ballads.1882-1898

&nbsp;

O I forbid
you, maidens a�,

Tha� wear gowd on yer hair,

Ta com� or gae by Carterhaugh,

For young
Tam Lin is there.

������������� �

���� There�s no major motorway going direct from
Kilnineve to Stirling.
The A198 makes a major dogleg about Loch Lamont that adds at least two hours to
the trip. The meeting was to be at one, and there was little
doubt I�d be late, so I headed across on the backcountry
roads, hoping that would help make up some lost time. An hour
into my journey, the Fiat sputtered to a
standstill, done in by a clogged fuel filter. I
trudged through the drizzle back toward the tiny village I'd last passed
through.

The local mechanic said a new fuel filter would take
a day or two to fetch, but he could jury-rig a bypass if I�d
give him a few hours. I retired to the town�s
only pub to while away a bit of time.

�The publican was a
pleasant enough chap with a gap toothed grin. His
curving mustache flowed seamlessly into muttonchops and drew one's eye away
from his thinning top. He allowed me a call to the office in Stirling and I offered my regrets for missing
the meeting. 

I ordered a
pint of Boddingtons bitter and looked about. I saw but
one other soul in the establishment so with an expansive wave I ordered a round
for the house.

���� The old man in the corner nodded as he
accepted his fresh pint. He wore an old tweed jacket, the kind with leather
elbow patches; it had once been of good quality but was well
worn now. He�d a good head of thick gray hair and full beard; both were weeks
beyond a proper trim. In short, he looked the part of a gentleman, a bit past
his prime. 

When he started toward me, pint in
hand, he moved with the stiff gait of a man deep into his seventh decade. It
was his eyes, though; those slate grey eyes had the haunted look of a man
seeking a confessional. It was enough to make me
regret my impulsiveness.  I was too polite to move off so I nodded at the stool next
to me. The barman moved deliberately away, leaving me
ensnared in the trap I'd sprung upon myself. There was no doubt the old man
felt he had a tale that needed to be told and I'd be
hearing it.���� 

���� �I've lived all my years in this village of Chauterfield, at the head of this Gray
Thistle Glen.� 

His voice was clear, well used to public speech; perhaps he was
a retired solicitor, or maybe a local councilman. 

�Chauterfield lies just below yon bluff,� He gestured vaguely
toward the door. �that we locals call� �The Mound�. A spring issues forth midway
down the western slope, it slips and splashes its way beside a forested path
and out onto the floor of the glen. This would be the one what's called the �Burn
of Bliss�.

�From the eastern face of the bluff a waterfall drops straight
down nigh on eighty feet to the rocks below then follows its time worn path
down into the valley. It�s always been known as the �Burn
of Mourning�. A half-mile further along the vale the two burns meld into a
stream that runs a course toward our village. It's dammed up at the northern
edge of the green to form the old millpond.� 

He took a pull from his pint, wiped his lips on his jacket
sleeve, and continued. 

���� �The name �The Mound� isn't for the
bluff itself but rather for the strange circle raised atop the bluff. We're not
talking of a stone circle as you find in Castlerigg
and elsewhere about the countryside. Nay, we speak here of a perfectly
symmetrical mound. 

From the very
center of that mound juts a lone rock o�re a foot high,
most do claim it resembles a toadstool.��� 

���� �Chauterfield is mentioned in �Dunnfield�s Guide to Touring Scotland� as a quaint
hamlet well off the beaten path but a lovely spot for both the birding and
antique enthusiasts. The Mound is not mentioned in
that or any local guide. Still it attracts a steady stream of tourists who take
the meandering trek up to the top for the fine view of our glen.�

���� He paused, his thoughts wandering; he
seemed harmless.

��Memories run deep �ere,
and that mound has always played havoc round these parts. �Tis never a cheerful place; we
locals avoid it regularly, 'specially near the summer
solstice. 

�We're a close-knit group. Some might say we're a clannish lot,
as closed mouthed as we are closed fisted. Mayhap it's
true. In any event, none of them will tell ye
what I do tell ye now.� 

He took a sip. When he continued his voice was lower as if, at
last, he'd tell what secrets he felt needed telling.

�A castle stood on that bluff in the mid-eighteenth century. That �ould be the last stronghold of the Jacobites. It stood proud and defiant long after the
Bonnie Prince lost his men and nerve at Culloden. On the eve of the summer
solstice in 1747 the castle fell to an overwhelming
English force. There were 63 that manned those castle walls, but nary a one survived its capture. Bloody King George ordered
the castle torn down and stone-by-stone the rocks were scattered about our
glen. It took a company of Royal Engineers three months to finish that task.
Through it all not one of that cowardly lot laid his
bloody hand upon the mound.

��The defenders are buried
together up there, the grave unmarked. Ten years later a monument was erected in our local cemetery. It still lists the names
and the Clans of those 63 men. There be a 64th entry, an �Abigail o� the
Macgregor�s Clan�, but none now know the meaning of that.�

The old man�s eyes glistened and he drained the pint. I signaled for another round. As the publican set the pint
before him the old man�s stormy grey eyes swept over me
in cold calculation. Suspicion and mistrust struggled with some other deep need.


�If the local archaeologist be believed,� he spoke a bit louder
now.

��and why would ye not?� he asked, his tone defiant, and though
it was I he glared at, I sensed that his anger was
directed elsewhere.

��He's a local lad.� he said, in a slightly more conciliatory tone.

�I nodded, feeling an
interloper a bit defensive in the role I�d been cast. Still
it was his choice to tell the tale.

���T were
a Roman fort up there near two millennia ago. Must have been the furthest north
the Romans built, 40 miles above Hadrian's Wall.
Among the bits found was a keystone block. �T was inscribed in Latin, crudely
chiseled with a centurion�s name, Flavius Victrous,
of the 2nd� century,
Sixth Legion. If it all be a hoax, as some do claim,
it be a well planned and executed one. Indeed the Sixth Legion was stationed on
the northern frontier till sent to fight the Goths in
86 AD. 'T would make the fort at least fifty years older than Hadrian's
 Wall itself. Of the fort, naught of the structure's left.
The bits of glass, pottery, and metal from the Roman era all be charred an�
melted so it be likely the Jacobites weren't the
first to be sacrificed o'er the mound.�

He paused, sipped, and moved on. I'd
been taken in.

�More recent, there be the
suicide pact that took the lives of five young lads, up from University on
holiday. They were found dead at the base of the falls havin�
leapt one after t�other to their deaths. A lone bonny
lass was found wandering among the broken bodies, but
she were quite mad and never could tell what�d happened. That caused quite a
bit of a stir back in '53. Since then we've tried to clear the woodland during
early summer. Still almost every year a tourist or some local lass disappears for a spell.

�Present legend would have the mound be seeking only a virgin lass, but that surely be the local lads trying
to protect their sweethearts from a virgin's dire fate.�

He chuckled a moment, then his voice grew somber again.

��T was two elderly women; birders out early, who found the last
lass. She lay in the moss covered hollow twixt the two burns. She was naked,
bruised, battered, but alive. She weren't responsive �t all, like her mind had
fled to some better place.�

He eyed me sharply, his words coming
faster now. 

�We knew how best ta deal with such
situations. Those two biddies 'at found her called the county authorities. �T
was most unfortunate for they called still more outsiders; in the end a �Major
Crimes Unit� was sent up from Edinburgh
to investigate.

��She were
a blonde tourist from New
  Zealand, a schoolteacher I do believe. As
luck would have it, she�d won a vacation packet that be offered by the
tourist board in an internet charity raffle.

�She was nae help to the
investigators. True she'd been assaulted, but, other than some bruises
and scrapes, she were in fair shape. An
Inspector swore she'd murmured �Tram Line�, but there�s none in these
parts and she'd fallen silent since. She seemed completely disconnected from
reality. They found no semen, the investigator concluded her assailment had
used �protection� ta hinder the
investigation. The local constable rolled his eyes at such nonsense, but bit
his tongue and let the professionals proceed about their business. 

�She'd nearly torn off two fingernails in the struggle. The
scrapings yielded some dirt but no trace of human flesh. The investigators
puzzled over her lack of clothing until a local lad took pity, he led them up
the bluff to the mound itself. There they found bits of her pink cotton
nightgown and a white terry cloth robe, but that only deepened their
puzzlement.�

The old man sipped perfunctorily and then pressed on.

��What they found were
tiny fragments��twas impossible to tell what'd occurred, almost as if her
clothes had turned as brittle as fine porcelain, then
shattered into a million bits. Stranger yet, some of them strands o� cloth were found imbedded in trees and rocks up ta forty paces from the mound. If this were where she be
attacked one need wonder what in God�s name happened to her clothes and how did
she end up down betwixt the burns?�� 

�The special crimes team mucked about for a few weeks
complaining all the while about a shortage of local co-operation. The woman's
cuts and bruises were treated and she were sent off to
a psychiatric ward diagnosed with �hysterical amnesia�. 

�There be a whiff of scandal four weeks
later when an orderly of 23 years good standing were sacked. When the same
event reoccurred with the next rising of the new moon, the man be reinstated with back pay and a proper apology. On the
third month when the nearly catatonic patient were
fully restrained inside a locked room, the same shameful thing happened yet
again. 

�Our village council stepped forward and offered to place the
poor woman in a local nursing home. There she would be protected and cared for.

�Everyone breathed a sigh of relief and life returned to normal.
The woman remains nearly comatose but for those evenings when a new moon rises.
It be then that you find her on hands and knees
pressing back against an ethereal lover that only she can see. The following
morning will find her as unresponsive as ever; but with fresh bruises and abrasions.
The psychiatric professionals assure us these are only the product of her vivid
imagination.�

The old man straightened, appraising my
reaction. With a nod he continued. 

�It be going on for almost nine months
now. If everything goes the way it always do she�ll wake after the thirteenth
new moon. She'll �ave lost a year of her life, and
whatever maidenly virtue she�d arrived with. She ought
ta be grateful though. Not a single victim has died
for nigh on these sixty years. 

��Haps in these parts even spirits can mellow with age.�

It�s a joke, I thought hopefully, a clever
ploy to win a pint from a passing rube like me.

He saw my wavering doubt, addressed it
with an uncaring shrug. He was nearly done.�


�The villagers will take up a collection for the befuddled lass
when she awakens. We'll hand that small token over along with our best wishes
before we send her on her way.�

With that he drained his second pint. I thought him finished.

�But enough of that sad tale; the council's be sendin� out five new vacation packages this very noon. By chance the lucky winners all be winsome lasses, each single,
and every one with golden hair. I�ll wager one of them will tickle Tam Lin's
fancy.�

He rose stiffly to take his leave. My
doubts were in a tumble; I dared not ask his name. He paused at the door,
turned, and spoke these final words to me.

�And may God have mercy on our souls.�������
