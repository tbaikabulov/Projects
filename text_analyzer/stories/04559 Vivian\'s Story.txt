Synopsis: Shining Example\" mother recalls her training.






Please do not read if you are under 18 years of age.&nbsp; The first chapter of Vivian�s story is mostly plot and character build up.&nbsp; For some reason, I have been really taken with this character and I want to do her tale justice.&nbsp; As always, I would love to hear your feedback.





Ch. 1



My name is Vivian.&nbsp; I have been instructed by my son-in-law to record the events of my training.&nbsp; My late husband began teaching me on our honeymoon on how to service and please him.&nbsp; This is the story of our beginning and how he turned me into a cock worshipping slut.



I was raised to be a good girl.&nbsp; My mother was a traditional 50�s housewife that stayed at home and took care of the kids and baked cookies.&nbsp; My father worked and brought home the bread and made the decisions.&nbsp; Their roles in life were very clear and so I chose to follow that model when it was my turn to find a husband.&nbsp; I thought nothing would make me feel more secure than to be taken care of like that.&nbsp; Then along came the sexual revolution and women�s liberation and every ideal that I had held dear was turned completely upside down.&nbsp; Suddenly it was wrong for a woman to take care of the home and children, wrong to take care of her husband.&nbsp; Women were free to make their own decisions and be liberated about sex, or so I was told by every jerk on campus that only wanted to get into my pants.&nbsp; I knew that to be a virgin on a college campus in the early 70�s was crazy, but I was taught that my virginity was something sacred and a gift to my future husband.&nbsp; It wasn�t so much a religious thing, but a measure of respect for myself and my future husband.



Most of the guys that I met were only interested in getting me drunk and getting laid.&nbsp; After a while, word got around that I didn�t do that kind of thing, and the �date� offers dwindled.&nbsp; That was fine by me, I had not met one single man that I thought was worth my time anyway.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Until I met Paul.&nbsp; I was a junior working in the campus bookstore when he came in to get his books for the last term.&nbsp; He smiled and was polite, and I found myself smiling back in spite of my usual shyness.&nbsp; He came in the next day for a book that he had �forgotten� to buy and when he finished in the checkout line, Paul asked me if I would like to have lunch with him.&nbsp; I accepted.&nbsp; 



Upon getting to know him, I learned that he was raised in a similarly traditional household in the south.&nbsp; At the end of our first lunch, Paul walked me to my dorm, and thanked me for a nice afternoon.&nbsp; After he left, I thought to myself, well that is the end of that.&nbsp; He got the idea that I won�t put out, and I will never see him again.&nbsp; I wasn�t surprised that he didn�t try to kiss me, but I was a little saddened.&nbsp; I thought maybe this one might turn out to be different.&nbsp; 



As it turns out, he was different.&nbsp; He came again the next day at lunchtime and so it went for a week until he asked me out to dinner.&nbsp; He always seemed genuinely warm without pressuring me, so I accepted.&nbsp; That night, we talked openly about our expectations for our respective futures.&nbsp; I was open about my need to stay a virgin until marriage, and he nodded as I spoke.



�I knew that you were different when I first saw you,� he told me.&nbsp; �Do you know I watched you for half an hour before I asked you for your help?&nbsp; You were so gracious to people and trying to get what they needed.&nbsp; I am glad that you want to wait.&nbsp; It makes it so much more special, like symbolically giving yourself completely and totally to your husband .�



I blushed at his words, but I think that that was the moment that I fell in love.&nbsp; I knew and he knew that I was lost.&nbsp; He asked my father for permission to marry me six months later, and I eagerly accepted.&nbsp; We agreed that because we were both in our senior year in college, we would wait until graduation to get married.&nbsp; It really wasn�t that far away, but because we were officially engaged, we felt at liberty to play and tease with each other a little more than before.



I remember one night after dinner, he was walking me back to my dorm in the dark.&nbsp; He took my hand and slipped me into a dark alley in between two buildings.&nbsp; We were no strangers to kissing by this time, so I brought my arms up around his neck thinking he wanted to steal a private smooch before we got home.&nbsp; Instead, he stretched my hands up to where an old sign fixture was still sticking out of the wall.&nbsp; He whispered in my ear to grab on to it and hold.&nbsp; As I stood there with my arms over my head, he took a long look at my shape in the moonlight.&nbsp; He must have liked what he saw, because he grinned and walked slowly around me in a full circle.&nbsp; I was blushing profusely by the time he came to stand back in front of me, but I stayed as he wanted and returned his gaze.&nbsp; He brought his hands to my outer thighs and rubbed my skin through the thin cotton fabric of my skirt.&nbsp; Slowly, he rubbed in circles until his hands migrated to my rear where he pressed me into him and kissed me passionately as I hung onto the iron bar.



He broke the kiss and backed away and we both stood and breathed heavy for a few seconds before he gave me a funny look and motioned for me to let go of the bar and step back out onto the sidewalk with him.&nbsp; I took his hand and snuggled into his arm as we walked, glowing with love and desire.&nbsp; He kissed me lightly when we reached the doorstep and he said goodnight.&nbsp; 



Several times we pushed the boundaries of propriety, but instead of upsetting my moral code, I found myself virtually panting for more.&nbsp; He was an odd mixture of outrageous suitor and perfect gentleman.&nbsp; By the time our wedding day arrived, I was in a fit of longing, hardly daring to believe that our union would finally be consummated.



I won�t bore you with wedding details except to say that my hair and dress were suitably out of 1974 and our wedding pictures were something my daughter gets a good laugh out of today.&nbsp; It was an entirely enjoyable affair with much celebrating and good will.&nbsp; As we were packing to leave for our honeymoon, Paul offhandedly remarked that I should not bother to pack any underwear for our trip.&nbsp; In my overly horny state, I took his remark at face value and left them all in the undies drawer.&nbsp; He would not tell me where we were going on our honeymoon, only that it would be hot, and that we would have plenty of time to spend alone together.





I had packed a bikini, the first I had ever owned.&nbsp; I remember hoping that Paul liked what he saw and was not disgusted that I wanted to put my body on display.&nbsp; But I wanted to tan, and he had told me that we would be alone.&nbsp; I could never have pictured the tiny bungalow on a private beach on the back of a posh island resort.&nbsp; I know it is clich�, but the sandy white beaches and azure ocean water were an incredible sight to behold.&nbsp; Having been raised in the Midwest, I had never seen an ocean before.&nbsp; It was awe inspiring.



Paul smiled at my reaction and told me to unpack the suitcases while he ordered lunch.&nbsp; I was happy to be occupied, a little nervous but exceptionally excited about what was to transpire that evening.&nbsp; I heard him hang up the phone with room service and he joined me, in the bedroom, hanging up the last of the items in the wardrobe.&nbsp; We made small talk until our meal arrived.&nbsp; The conversation came easily, but the undercurrent of desire and anticipation was making me twitter in my seat.&nbsp; I was so keyed up, I could barely stand it.&nbsp; He must have noticed my anticipation, because he pulled me into his lap and kissed me deeply.&nbsp; When we broke apart, he looked a little stern.



�I want you to try to calm down and try to finish your lunch.&nbsp; We have the whole week ahead of us, and I have something to talk to you about after we finish here.�



�Okay, I responded, trying to make my breathing even.&nbsp; �I�m sorry, I am just so excited, to be here, and be with you, and start a new life, it is a lot to take in right now,� I said.



He grinned at me and motioned to finish my salad.&nbsp; �I am sure we can come up with an outlet for your exuberance very soon.&nbsp; And he winked.



I blushed to my core and finished eating with gusto.&nbsp; When we were done, we wandered out on the terrace with some wine.&nbsp; The afternoon was getting late, and the sun was just barely making pink streaks in the sky.&nbsp; We watched in silence for a minute and then he directed me to sit in one of the padded lounges on the deck.



�I told you that I wanted to talk to you this afternoon.&nbsp; What I have to say is fairly serious, so I wish you to remain silent until I have finished, at which time you can feel free to ask questions.&nbsp; I am sure will have many.�&nbsp; He paused and I nodded and looked on.&nbsp; �I know that you are a virgin, and you know that I am not.&nbsp; I have been with many women, and have had much experience with sex in all it�s forms.&nbsp; Except one.&nbsp; For several years now, I have been interested in Domination and Submission.&nbsp; This means that I will take the lead role in all aspects of our lives, and you will follow my direction, especially in the bedroom.&nbsp; You will be my submissive, but also my wife and partner.&nbsp; Know that I love and respect you and will always strive to see to your protection and happiness.�&nbsp; He looked at my face.&nbsp; I know that I must have registered some shock, but I was curious and more than a little aroused.&nbsp; I had always dreamed of a man taking charge, but I had never really formed a concrete idea of what all that would entail.&nbsp; I was about to find out as he continued.



�Remember in the alley?� he asked.&nbsp; I nodded.&nbsp; �You held on to the hook even after I broke away, and waited for me to tell you to let go.&nbsp; You wanted to please me.&nbsp; And you did.�&nbsp; I blushed again.&nbsp; �You received gratification and satisfaction from pleasing me.&nbsp; I could tell that you were the one.&nbsp; I have been looking for you for a long time.&nbsp; Someone who I can bond with and love and take care of even as she is there for me.&nbsp; I want to truly make love with my partner who trusts me to take her to incredible heights of desire.&nbsp; I can think of no other way to cement a relationship with such a complete bond of trust.�&nbsp; He paused and held my eyes again.&nbsp; I stayed silent, but inside I was squirming with questions.&nbsp; �You have followed my directions admirably so far.&nbsp; You will be rewarded for that.&nbsp; But as fair warning, I must tell you that deviation from my direction will earn you punishment as well.�&nbsp; He smiled as he finished, and his expression became more open and inviting.



�Punishment like what?� was the first question out of my mouth.



�Maybe a spanking, maybe some task to complete, it will depend on the circumstances,� he answered.&nbsp; �I have many evil tricks up my sleeve to correct unacceptable behavior,� he grinned at me.



�What is our life going to be like, are you going to decide everything, like what I wear and what is for dinner, things like that?�&nbsp; I asked.



�Well, the day to day things like that, no, but I do expect you to learn my preferences and take them into consideration in your daily decision making�I am not a complete control freak.&nbsp; I expect that we will work things out as we go along without too much trouble.�



�And what if I can�t deal with all of this?� I asked.&nbsp; �What if it is all too much for me to handle?&nbsp; I mean we are talking about life and a marriage together till death do us part!� I said breathlessly.



He paused a moment before he replied.&nbsp; �I have thought this through.&nbsp; I have a solution that I want to share with you, but not right this minute.&nbsp; This is our honeymoon, and I want us to enjoy it.&nbsp; You have enough to think about for the moment.&nbsp; Lets change and go for a swim.�&nbsp; He stood and pulled me to my feel and kissed me again.&nbsp; This time softly and gently as if trying to reassure me of this brave new world.



I went into the bedroom dresser for the bikini that I stashed earlier, screwing up my courage and changing as quickly as possible.&nbsp; I didn�t want to ponder too much.&nbsp; I liked what I was hearing, even though it was scary.&nbsp; He seemed to want to let the matter rest for now and have some fun, so I put myself into the spirit.&nbsp;&nbsp; He left me in privacy to change, and I had a hard time deciding weather I was disappointed or relieved.&nbsp; 



Since he was already wearing a pair of khaki shorts, he had no need to change and was waiting for me by on the terrace.&nbsp; He did a double take as I walked out, and put his hand out for me to halt in the middle of the entryway.&nbsp; I stopped and he just stood and stared.&nbsp; Then he whistled low and shook his head.&nbsp; �Lucky.&nbsp; I am a lucky man.�



We splashed around for a bit, but it was getting darker so we decided to go back to the bungalow.&nbsp; Again, he stopped me on the terrace, but this time we were bathed in the soft new moon light.&nbsp; I was shivering slightly as he told me to put my hands behind my neck.&nbsp; I did as he said and stood with my feet slightly apart.&nbsp; My pussy was all tingly and damp and I remember thinking, �Here we go.�



He reached up behind my head and untied the string that held up the top of my bikini.&nbsp; It fell to my waist revealing my well-built breasts to his gaze.&nbsp; Standing in the moonlight, by skin was&nbsp; still slightly damp from our swim and they immediately swelled and hardened as he gazed at me.&nbsp; My emotions were racing as well as my hormones and I almost wished he would throw me to the floor and be done with it.&nbsp; He only stood quietly, gazing at my body, watching my breathing quicken.&nbsp; 



�You are so incredibly beautiful,� he said to me.&nbsp; �I have waited forever for this night.&nbsp; Tonight, I will begin your training.&nbsp; I will teach you to love everything that we do together.�



I was breathless in anticipation as he untied the string on my bottoms and they fell to the floor in a puddle.&nbsp; I was completely naked now, still holding still under his gaze.&nbsp; My pussy was on fire and I was hungering for something just beyond my reach.&nbsp; I expected him to continue to seduce me, but instead, he pulled me to the chair on the terrace.&nbsp; I felt so exposed sitting naked in the open, but I sensed that I needed to trust him and go with this.



�I told you earlier that have a solution if you should want to end this union.&nbsp; This is very serious.&nbsp; I know that you would not give yourself to any but your rightful husband.&nbsp; If I turn out to be the kind of husband that you can�t live with, I want you to leave this union with your virginity intact.� 



I gasped at this.&nbsp; Was he not going to make love to me?&nbsp; 



�For a trial period of one year, we will be intimate as husband and wife.&nbsp; You will serve me in the capacity previously described.&nbsp; You will submit to me in every way or be punished.&nbsp; The exception being that I will not use your pussy.&nbsp; I will only use your mouth and anus to enter your body.�



I gasped again and gaped at him.&nbsp; Did people really do it like that?&nbsp; I�m not sure what I expected, but this wasn�t it.&nbsp; He pressed on.



�This will also ensure that there will be no children before we are ready.&nbsp; On our first anniversary, if you decide that you want to stay married to me, we will celebrate and I will take great pleasure in breaking through your final barrier.&nbsp; If you decide that this lifestyle is too overwhelming, you can choose to walk away.&nbsp; I will not stop you, and you will still be intact for another, perfectly vanilla marriage.�&nbsp; He paused.&nbsp; �Go and get ready for a nice hot bath.&nbsp; I will be in to help you complete preparations for our wedding night in just a minute.&nbsp; I have my own preparing to do while you are in the bath.�&nbsp; He kissed me gently, and rose to his feet.&nbsp; I followed suit and gathered my things into the bathroom.
