Masquerade
By Electric Badger
Chapter 1

The idea came to Eleanor while she watched Elise at the bar throwing back shots of tequila.&nbsp; The bitch was dressed like a complete slut in a blood red Victorian corset and latex mini skirt inspired by a fetishist&#8217;s wet dream, complete with four inch fuck-me heels &#8211; a tramp on the town for Halloween, although in this case the function was a company masquerade ball.&nbsp; Eleanor didn&#8217;t remember actually deciding to really carry her plan out; it matured as an erotic day dream, fed by Jack and Cokes, then suddenly she was in action.&nbsp; It all started with a single thought, that if Elise had worn something a bit less overtly slutty she and Eleanor might be indistinguishable behind their masks.&nbsp; Despite their obvious differences in class and their equally apparent contrast in coloring &#8211; Elise&#8217;s hair was raven black, her flawless skin pale as cream, while Eleanor was a freckled brunette with a hint of African blood &#8211; the two women were a similar size at a couple inches over five feet&nbsp; and under 120 pounds.&nbsp; On the heels of that notion came another realization: Eleanor knew her rival wouldn&#8217;t weather a drinking binge any better than she would herself.&nbsp; This coupled in her mind with the wicked thought of Kevin, who she had abandoned at work with a pile of month-end backlog, the sort of boring nonsense Eleanor would thrown herself at a few weeks ago just for the chance to spend a night in the dark office with the new CPA.&nbsp; He&#8217;d be late to the party; maybe in time for desert, but even that was doubtful.&nbsp; 
Then again, if things went to plan, Eleanor was going to give him a whole different sort of desert tonight.&nbsp; 
The office party was an upscale affair.&nbsp; Other companies would settle for paper hats and a quick trip to Display and Costume, but the partnership took pride in going to extremes for the annual ball, providing live music, catering, and an open bar.&nbsp; Fortunately for Eleanor, it was also downtown in the WAC penthouse, twenty three floors over the glittering Sound and the neon heart of the emerald city.&nbsp; There were rooms to be had in the hotel and Eleanor took the liberty of booking two of them under a false name; it cost a fortune, but she intended to make sure tonight would be worth the expense.&nbsp; The rest of what she needed was available within walking distance, most of it from a dim, windowless store seven blocks away.&nbsp; The pills were already in her car.&nbsp; 
They were prescribed for her insomnia and even half a dose normally did the trick.&nbsp; Her doctor insisted her main problem was just refusing to lie down; well, she intended to have her share of that tonight.&nbsp; She grinned wickedly at the thought as she crushed three of the blue tablets into a fine powder, sifting them into a little baggie.&nbsp; It wouldn&#8217;t kill Elise, even combined with the alcohol &#8211; Eleanor had done her homework when she first received the prescription, fearful of the things she&#8217;d heard on KIRO news &#8211; but it would be lights out for the night.&nbsp; There might even be hallucinations or sleep walking; that&#8217;s why she&#8217;d bought the rope.&nbsp; It was tempting to mix in a bit of cocaine &#8211; she&#8217;d noticed a couple managers doing lines in a dark corner - but she didn&#8217;t know how Elise would react to that and wasn&#8217;t cruel enough to find out.&nbsp; Quite.&nbsp; 
Once she&#8217;d stowed a few things in each room, Eleanor brushed off her costume and returned to the party.&nbsp; Unlike Elise, whose small breasts were at risk of being ejected from her corset while her black panties flashed beneath her short latex skirt, Eleanor was clothed conservatively in a long, flowing silk dress.&nbsp; It was sexy but sumptuous, and even included a cape and hood.&nbsp; Her mask, a gargoyle in jet black, covered her entire face.&nbsp; The disguise was intentional; she&#8217;d planned on being anonymous tonight.&nbsp; Ironically, it was because she originally didn&#8217;t want to be trapped in small talk with Kevin &#8211; or worse, the skank who&#8217;d stolen him away shortly after his first date with Eleanor but still taunted her with sycophantic friendship.&nbsp; Instead, tonight it allowed her to sit next to Elise and her several empty glasses, introduce herself as Helen, an associate from another firm out of town, and hasten the binge along.&nbsp; 
Fortunately Elise took to Helen immediately; within moments they were sharing lighthearted stories of the sort that would only make a fellow CPA laugh, toasting the night and complaining about the uncaring tardiness of men.&nbsp; Soon Eleanor was able to slip the powder into her victim&#8217;s drink entirely unnoticed.&nbsp; Elise even toasted the poisoned shot: �to new experiences.�&nbsp; Indeed.&nbsp; 
The results were predictable, if amusing.&nbsp; Within minutes Elise was nearly dropping from her stool, her green eyes fluttering in a drugged stupor.&nbsp; �Helen� stepped forward, playing the part of the caring friend, to scoop the inebriated girl up.&nbsp; Elise just mumbled against her breasts, her hands feebly pawing at her captor so weakly they were a caress.&nbsp; �Take�take me�.� 
�Of course I&#8217;ll find you a taxi, darling,� Eleanor announced in her best English accent &#8211; �Helen� was from London, after all &#8211; and the bartender actually thanked her for taking care of things and helped her carry Elise to the elevator.&nbsp; From the corner of her eye Eleanor saw his hand slip down the drugged girl&#8217;s back and under her skirt, stealing a feel of her naked ass, but the violation only made her grin.&nbsp; Bitch deserved it and a lot worse.&nbsp; 
The first of her booked hotel rooms was the simplest; just a bed, bathroom, and the usual furniture found in any hotel room.&nbsp; It was just more elegant than most, as befit such a prestigious hotel, with copious amounts of polished brass, travertine and satin.&nbsp; Eleanor went to work quickly, taking a wicked pleasure in the degradation of her rival.&nbsp; A blindfold &#8211; in case Elise woke, unlikely as that was &#8211; and a pink ball gag, comically bright and huge enough that it had to be forced past the girl&#8217;s perfect white teeth.&nbsp; She took her time peeling off Elise&#8217;s costume; as expected, the slut didn&#8217;t wear a bra for her tiny breasts, so there was just the red and black corset top, tight latex skirt and black lace underwear.&nbsp; In short order Elise was completely naked, her slim, mocha body spread across the bed and her shoulder length black hair fanned out in a halo.&nbsp; Eleanor laid the clothes carefully aside and began the lengthy process of tying her in place.&nbsp; 
She did it properly, just as she would one of her boy toys from the club, winding the soft cotton ropes into a body harness.&nbsp; As she stretched Elise across the bed spread eagle, naked and cinched tightly to the heavy postmodern bedposts, she felt herself flush with excitement.&nbsp; Looking over her work, admiring the taut curves of her smooth skinned rival, the sex forced open and gaping and the head lolled limply on the pillow, Eleanor chuckled with a sudden, evil notion, the sort of idea that would never have occurred to her sober mind.&nbsp; �What is it that men are always bragging about doing to their passed out friends?&nbsp; Teabagging?&nbsp; Well, I don&#8217;t have their equipment but let&#8217;s see if we can make do�.�
She giggled to herself as she quickly queued up an adult movie and stripped &#8211; there was still at least an hour before Kevin might arrive, so she felt no particular hurry.&nbsp; Soon she was sitting next to her unconscious rival with her legs splayed, nude and wet, propped against the headboard.&nbsp; The sleek silver vibrator from her purse went to work quickly and before long Eleanor moaned through her first orgasm, fueled by the excitement of her impending crime &#8211; her rape, if she were honest.&nbsp; After a quick rest, watching entranced as the star on screen serviced a man and woman simultaneously, she went to work on her clit again.&nbsp; This time, however, she stopped short of cumming and moved to kneel with a leg on either side of Elise&#8217;s head.&nbsp; She jerked the gag out &#8211; damn, it was a tight fit &#8211; and slowly, blushing with humiliation of her own, lowered herself to feel another woman&#8217;s lips on her cunt for the first time.&nbsp; 
It felt marvelous; not just the physical sensation, although Elise&#8217;s lips were surprisingly soft, but the dominance of her foe.&nbsp; She pulled out her phone to take a series of pictures and even a short video clip as she began to ride Elise&#8217;s mouth and nose harder, rubbing her slick sex and sensitive rosebud against the bright red lipstick.&nbsp; When she came she screamed with the pleasure of it, gushing into the open mouth beneath her.&nbsp; She briefly considered pissing into it as well and felt scandalized by her own thought, but she did soak the gag in her juices, rubbing herself with it thoroughly.&nbsp; �I&#8217;ll be back later, slut, and let you taste Kevin&#8217;s cum, too.�&nbsp; The gag was crammed back into place, the bonds checked, and then Eleanor dressed again &#8211; this time wearing Elise&#8217;s skimpy underwear instead of her own &#8211; and left the room.&nbsp; Her last thought was surprising: Elise actually looked quite beautiful, stretched nude across a rumpled bed, the flickering light of the porn gleaming on the wetness covering her face.&nbsp; Bitch.&nbsp; 

Eleanor returned to the party before Kevin.&nbsp; She was glad of it &#8211; it would be a lot easier to approach him on her own terms this way &#8211; but she felt a twinge of frustration at every extra minute that she could have spent exercising perversions on Elise.&nbsp; She rubbed her legs together beneath her long dress, feeling the gusset of Elise&#8217;s lace panties, a size too small, slip between her swollen lips.&nbsp; The lingerie was already damp &#8211; had that slut been getting off by displaying herself? &#8211; but soon they were drenched through as she watched couples drift out the door or into dark corners.&nbsp; The party was in full swing, the buffet despoiled and the band beginning to fade as she waited, sipping another glass of Jack and alternating her thoughts between the man she was going to trick into fucking her and the pleasure she&#8217;d taken &#8211; could still take &#8211; from the woman tied up down below.&nbsp; 
She was shocked to realize that she wasn&#8217;t entirely sure which one she wanted more; while she wasn&#8217;t repulsed at the idea of touching another woman, she&#8217;d never felt any strong Sapphic urges before.&nbsp; Already tonight she&#8217;d surprised herself; maybe she was hitting the booze a bit hard after all.&nbsp; How many shots was this?&nbsp; she wondered, staring at her half empty glass in confusion.&nbsp; It had been the first time a woman had ever been so close to her, in touch with her sexually.&nbsp; What had possessed her?&nbsp; And why had it felt so wonderful?&nbsp;

Chapter 2

The wait for Kevin seemed to last forever.&nbsp; Eleanor squirmed against the slick leather of the bar stool, feeling the tight lace of Elise&#8217;s underwear rubbing her clit raw as she thought of what tonight would bring.&nbsp; Shot after shot slid down her throat &#8211; more than booze would go down it later &#8211; to bolster her courage and peel away her inhibitions: that would be necessary for tonight, to lay aside every inhibition.&nbsp; It was the key to her plan.&nbsp; God, she was wet, it was dripping down her leg.&nbsp; 
Time dragged slowly and it wasn&#8217;t long before Eleanor considered finding someone else to help her pass the time &#8211; some random man to take her edge off, a quick fuck while she waited.&nbsp;&nbsp; She shivered at the image of coming to Kevin dirty and used.&nbsp; Such fast and furious hookups weren&#8217;t uncommon &#8211; it was a tradition to cross work boundaries during the masquerade.&nbsp; Last year Eleanor had spread her legs for one of the partners, a married man twice her age whose wife had been screaming someone else&#8217;s name in the next room, and even covered head to toe in disguise she&#8217;d seen several interested looks tonight.&nbsp; But she didn&#8217;t want to risk her prize.&nbsp; Instead of indulging in a stranger&#8217;s cock she slid a hand down the front of her dress and slipped a finger inside, blushing furiously as she caught a few knowing glances but refusing to stop.&nbsp; 
Finally, Kevin arrived &#8211; clearly straight from the office.&nbsp; He still wore his suit, a black double breasted number with subtle striping, slightly crumpled from his twelve hour work day.&nbsp; The partnership was demanding; such days weren&#8217;t uncommon for any of the CPAs it employed, which was one reason they were so close and their interactions so charged.&nbsp; Eleanor couldn&#8217;t imagine despising Elise so much, or needing Kevin so badly, if they didn&#8217;t spend so many tense hours with one another.&nbsp; It was the reason they had no families, no ties outside of the partnership to vent to.&nbsp; 
He wasn&#8217;t even in a mask, which annoyed Eleanor to no end, for some reason she couldn&#8217;t quite comprehend.&nbsp; In another lover she would have put it down to willful disobedience.&nbsp; She would have said it was inappropriate, but considering what she was about to do &#8211; what she had already done to the naked, violated woman tied up downstairs &#8211; appropriate hardly seemed to apply.&nbsp; Kevin had, however, already started to party; he held a bottle of goldschlager and took a deep drink of the hard stuff as Eleanor watched.&nbsp; 
Like a cat stalking prey, Eleanor slipped from her stool and walked towards Kevin.&nbsp; She swayed her hips, trailing a finger up her stomach to tease her own breast.&nbsp; She was the picture of lust and when she walked up to Kevin she grabbed his belt, pulled him against her body and swayed with the music, grinding herself against his crotch.&nbsp; It was overdone, of course, and he hardly knew how to respond &#8211;which was largely the point.&nbsp; �E�elise?� he finally stuttered.&nbsp; He sounded like a dimwitted buffoon, and in that moment she hated him for it, but Eleanor thought of the plan and grinned beneath her mask as she nodded.&nbsp; At least this part, the most dangerous for her, was working just as she&#8217;d hoped.&nbsp; She leaned closer to whisper in his ear, confident her hushed voice was indistinguishable from Elise&#8217;s.&nbsp; If whispers didn&#8217;t all sound the same, at least they were very different from voices.&nbsp; �I have a surprise for you, but not here.&nbsp; And you have to be a good boy &#8211; no questions tonight.&nbsp; Just enjoy yourself.�&nbsp; 
Kevin was a bit shy, despite his handsome appearance: he somehow found the time to work out, and his body showed it with athletic muscles, a tight ass and broad shoulders.&nbsp; He didn&#8217;t tan, though &#8211; not that anyone could naturally in the northwest, particularly in October &#8211; but it was the only flaw in his Californian Surfer look.&nbsp; He even had the bleached blond hair, which he insisted was natural.&nbsp; But his shyness let her take the lead, just as she&#8217;d done on their single date &#8211;she remembered the theatre with a flash, how she&#8217;d pushed his hand under her short satin dress, riding his fingers with short, hard motions as Mimi pole danced onstage during the 5th Avenue&#8217;s performance of Rent.&nbsp; She&#8217;d come, leaving his hand and the seat wet, screaming her orgasm as the theatre burst into applause.&nbsp; Eleanor didn&#8217;t return the favor, of course: it would have been messier, for one, but mostly she knew the frustrated lust would bring Kevin back.&nbsp; That misjudgement was another sting to her pride, as he&#8217;d spent the next weekend fucking that bitch Elise, claiming they were working together on a project.&nbsp; 
But now she used his submissive nature to her advantage, playing him like a puppet.&nbsp; A bit of shock to keep him off balance, unable to think clearly, and enough lust to pull him where she wanted to go would tip him nicely into her trap.&nbsp; He stumbled after her, taking the mask she grabbed from a table where it had been left, trying to keep his grip on that damned bottle of goldschlager as she dragged him towards the elevator.&nbsp; 
Once the doors closing with an electronic chime he moved to kiss her, but Eleanor would have none of it.&nbsp; She stepped away, giggling, and pushed a second ball gag into his hand.&nbsp; His expression turned to a hilarious display of shock.&nbsp; �Before the elevator stops,� her whisper was loud, husky, edged with passion and command.&nbsp; �The mask will hide it.&nbsp; Or�are you afraid?�&nbsp; The tease was juvenile, a playground taunt, but Kevin was so rattled with lust and confusion that it worked.&nbsp; He slipped the pink gag into place, setting the bottle down to buckle the straps as Eleanor tugged his mask down.&nbsp; A minute later Eleanor stumbled past disapproving middle aged glares as she dashed to the second of the rented rooms with boyfriend and booze in tow.&nbsp; 
They entered the room giggling &#8211;in his case, of course, they were so muffled all she heard were puffs of air from his nose &#8211; and tumbled towards the bed.&nbsp; Kevin flicked on the lights, showing the two immense beds and massive theatre system &#8211; but Eleanor snapped them off with a hidden grin, pulling him insistently onwards.&nbsp; 
Since she&#8217;d taken the precaution of closing the drapes earlier it was pitch black, leaving Eleanor with no hesitation to strip next to Kevin.&nbsp; She pulled off his clothes, driven by her own drunken passion.&nbsp; His chest was smooth and muscular, with a bare tuft of wiry curls, and she buried her face in it, inhaled his scent deeply, trying to take him all in at once.&nbsp; His fingers, in turn, struggled with her complex costume, fumbling at toggles and laces but working insistently towards her breasts.&nbsp; When he finally fumbled through the bindings, pulling her dress open, she lowered her tits into his hands and let him fondle her nipples, teasing them to firmness.&nbsp; He tried to nibble them but was frustrated by the gag, instead simply rubbing his lips against her smooth skin.&nbsp; Beneath her, he moaned two unintelligible syllables, and Eleanor continued to squirm against him, stroking his manhood through his slacks, eyes widening with surprise at his girth, until his meaning froze her stiff.&nbsp; Elise.&nbsp; He was moaning that bitch&#8217;s name while touching her!&nbsp; It was perfectly reasonable, of course &#8211; she&#8217;d taken extensive measures to make him think that was exactly who she was &#8211; but it still brought a cruel sneer to her lips.&nbsp; 
The sudden burst of anger made the next step easier.&nbsp; She reached under the pillow to grab the cold metal cuffs she&#8217;d placed there earlier, quickly snapping them around Kevin&#8217;s wrists.&nbsp; He recoiled with surprise and incomprehension.&nbsp; �Shhh�trust me,� she whispered as she slowly dragged her thigh along his groin, a sensuous sliding promise of pleasure to come.&nbsp; After a pause, long enough to let Eleanor know she was pushing his trust of Elise considerably, he nodded and relaxed beneath her body.&nbsp; She tugged his arms upwards, locking them into place around the headboard; it was cruder than the beautiful rope display she&#8217;d done on Elise, but this had to be fast.&nbsp; Although he didn&#8217;t realize it, Kevin had passed the point of no return; until now, he could have walked away.&nbsp; He was stronger, larger, and Eleanor would never have pushed things too far, lest she be found out.&nbsp; But now he was entirely in her power, and she grinned wickedly with the knowledge that he&#8217;d come to regret it.&nbsp; 
Eleanor slipped from the bed, finished undressing, and then moved to his feet.&nbsp; Two more pairs of cuffs were under the mattress and she quickly took hold of his ankles to lock them into place.&nbsp; Kevin muttered sounds of dismay and refusal but he hadn&#8217;t quite worked up the will to struggle yet, and Eleanor gave no mercy.&nbsp; When she was done he was secured tightly, spread eagle across the bed with a gag in place, thrashing a little in the dark and emitting sounds of frustration.&nbsp; Taking a moment to enjoy her handiwork, Eleanor slipped a hand between her legs, thrusting two fingers against her clit, moaning aloud with pleasure.&nbsp; After a few moments of masturbation she denied herself the orgasm &#8211; it would be so much better if she let it build &#8211; and reached into the nightstand to grab hold of a slim, sharp pocket knife.&nbsp; 
Kevin nearly screamed when he felt the ice cold blade against his skin and she smiled with the knowledge that he&#8217;d already been pushed beyond his limits.&nbsp; Not that he couldn&#8217;t have come to enjoy the feeling of a naked woman straddling his chest, sliding her moist folds across his skin as she slowly sliced away his pants and boxers.&nbsp; She&#8217;d planned to build him up to it when she first asked him to date.&nbsp; She could tell that beneath the surfer boy handsomeness and shy inexperience lurked a willing submissive, a pervert who would do anything to please his mistress.&nbsp; He would have been delicious to corrupt, a trophy to own, to play with and be pleasured by until she bored of him and tossed the scraps aside for her girlfriends &#8211; and boyfriends &#8211; to enjoy.&nbsp; He would have even enjoyed that, by the time she was finished.&nbsp; 
Instead, tonight was going to be about pushing things too hard, too fast.&nbsp; Instead of a slow seduction, she would force perversions upon him too fast for him to accept.&nbsp; By the time she was done taking her pleasures and showing him how sick his own were, he would be scared to death of Elise, the wanton slut he would think had done it all.&nbsp; He&#8217;d break up with the slut, awkward and distant, too afraid to continue.&nbsp; In would step Eleanor, the nice girl with just a tiny trace of the naughty, enough to understand his pain and soothe it.&nbsp; Eventually, she would help him accept it, enjoy it, and she&#8217;d relive it all with him if she chose.&nbsp; If she could have the patience to deal with all the issues he was about to have.&nbsp; Either way, she&#8217;d cheat that bitch out of her prize.&nbsp; 
Once Kevin&#8217;s pants were off Eleanor cut a piece of the black slacks into a long strip, chuckling as she considered her blindfold probably cost nearly a thousand dollars, and wrapped it around his eyes, tying it tightly.&nbsp; He continued to mumble beneath her, a pleading tone, no doubt whining to be let free.&nbsp; She ignored him and leaned down to press his face into her cleavage.&nbsp; She was larger than Elise and her breasts pressed against him, warm and smooth.&nbsp; He moaned and she whispered into his ear again.&nbsp; �Shh, relax.&nbsp; Enjoy.&nbsp; I&#8217;m going to blow your mind�.�

Chapter 3

Eleanor owned his ass, and she loved it.&nbsp; 
It had taken some work to accomplish.&nbsp; She&#8217;d had to prepare and she&#8217;d taken risks.&nbsp; Even as drunk as she was, Eleanor knew that things could have gone horribly wrong; the sort of wrong that landed a girl in prison for decades.&nbsp; But now the man who&#8217;d been stolen from her was tied to her bed, blindfolded and naked, struggling uselessly against professional grade metal cuffs and a solid steel bed frame.&nbsp; She could taste his panic, and it was delicious.&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;m going to make all your dreams come true, Kevin.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve been gentle with you so far�but I&#8217;m so drunk and fucking turned on right now�I know you&#8217;re a little boy slut, and I&#8217;m going to fuck your brains out.&nbsp; I&#8217;m going to do�everything�all the perversions you won&#8217;t admit to yourself.&nbsp; No more talking though, just trust your mistress Elise�.�&nbsp; She grinned as she whispered the lie in a husky, sultry voice sure to be unrecognizable.&nbsp; 
It only took a second to decide where to start.&nbsp; First things first, and she needed a cock inside of her, had needed it all night, ever since that bitch&#8217;s lips touched her cunt.&nbsp; She switched on a dim lamp and climbed on the bed to straddle him, grabbing his solid manhood and laughing because it was hard as steel despite his panic and protests: she&#8217;d read him right, the fucking little boy toy.&nbsp; Her nails dug into his member, breaking skin and making him whine.&nbsp; His back arched from the agony as she lowered onto him, penetrating herself deeply on his long dick.&nbsp; She moved on him with a slow moan of ecstasy, grinding her hips against his, digging her nails into his back and sides to force him to thrust deeply inside of her.&nbsp; It also kept him screaming, on the border between bliss and torture, where she was certain he wouldn&#8217;t come.&nbsp; She sat hard on his balls, crushing them on each stroke, delighting in his whimpers and sure he&#8217;d be sore for days.&nbsp; In less than one merciless minute she felt an orgasm shudder through her body and she bit her lip to keep from screaming with the pleasure.&nbsp; Once she was done she rolled to the side, giggling as his rigid cock slipped from her wet folds unsatisfied.&nbsp; Despite all she&#8217;d done to him, he moaned in protest.&nbsp; 
After a few minutes of softly stroking her own breasts and sliding a finger into her cunt &#8211; while Kevin sniveled through his gag, the bitch&#8217;s name and pleas for his own aborted orgasm &#8211; she settled on her next idea.&nbsp; It was probably something he&#8217;d enjoy, and that rankled her a bit, but her crop would make sure it wasn&#8217;t too easy for him; besides, she needed to prove to him that Elise was a complete, filthy slut, willing to do anything.&nbsp;&nbsp; She had to completely debase herself to humiliate her rival.&nbsp; So she pulled a tube of lubricant from her bag, squeezed a dab on her finger and moved it to her ass, easing it inside gently.&nbsp; It only hurt a little; it wasn&#8217;t the first time she&#8217;d be taken there, although it wasn&#8217;t a favorite activity of hers.&nbsp; Still moving her finger, adjusting to it, she squirmed up to Kevin&#8217;s ear.&nbsp; 
�Tell me, slut boy�have you ever done anal?�&nbsp; His brows rose comically and he moaned in desperation, shaking his head.&nbsp; �Never?&nbsp; Well, I&#8217;ll make you a deal.&nbsp; You put your tongue to work well enough, and I&#8217;ll let you fuck my ass.�&nbsp; He nodded violently, forgetting his trauma in a surge of lust &#8211; how typically male &#8211; and she grinned.&nbsp; Slipping the ball gag from his mouth, she straddled him, a finger still working slowly in and out of her rear.&nbsp; 
�Shit, Ellie�.� He stretched his jaw.&nbsp; �When you said you wanted to wait to fuck, I didn&#8217;t know you meant this.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not, you know, against it, but be a bit gentle�you&#8217;re stronger than you think!�&nbsp; I smirked; he thought it was a mistake!&nbsp; We&#8217;d clear that up soon enough.&nbsp; But Elise hadn&#8217;t fucked him yet?&nbsp; What the hell &#8211; they&#8217;d been on enough dates, shit, they&#8217;d even been locked inside her office enough times, the blinds closed and every secretary knowing perfectly well what they were up to.&nbsp; Except, apparently, that they hadn&#8217;t been.&nbsp; Oh well &#8211; time to use the asshole and return to the mystery later.&nbsp; She lowered herself slowly, squirming at the tickle of his beard against her shaved mons, and groaned as he went to work.&nbsp; 
He wasn&#8217;t particularly skilled.&nbsp; Either his shyness had overcome his good looks and he didn&#8217;t have as much experience with women as a muscular, successful and handsome man should, or he was one of those men who was squeamish about the taste &#8211; another reason to detest the fuck.&nbsp; Men were always eager enough to receive a little head, but ask them to return the favor and they whined endlessly.&nbsp; It also didn&#8217;t help that Eleanor was so drunk she could barely keep her position whenever he hit her clit &#8211; which he didn&#8217;t do nearly enough &#8211; but it served her purposes.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t want to come again before she took it in the ass anyways; it always hurt more if she wasn&#8217;t on edge.&nbsp; A bit more adjusting and her slim legs wrapped underneath his shoulders, her thighs tight against his ears.&nbsp; With a sadistic, delicious sneer she pressed herself down, using her legs to cement her pubic mound tightly to Kevin&#8217;s mouth, creating a seal.&nbsp; 
Then, with a push and a slight, brief cramping, she began to piss into his mouth.&nbsp; 
The initial look of confusion, even with his eyes still covered by the strip of cloth, was to die for.&nbsp; And when he realized what she was doing &#8211; what he was being forced to swallow &#8211; his look of betrayal was euphoria, a high like drugs, and it drove Eleanor into an animalistic frenzy.&nbsp; She rode his bucking face like a coin operated bronco, grabbing his hair with one hand and pinching his nose shut with the other.&nbsp; It was messy &#8211; he sputtered, and piss went everywhere, down her thighs and over his chin, into his hair and soaked the pillows &#8211; but finally he realized the only way to breathe was to suck the vile mess into his mouth with his gasps of air. Once he settled down she released his nose and he snorted while the last of her piss pooled in his mouth. �Swallow it,� she whispered into his ear, �or I&#8217;ll fucking choke you to death, you sissy little bitch.�&nbsp; There &#8211; that should clear up any misconceptions.&nbsp; His throat bobbed as he complied.&nbsp; When she slid off his mouth he tried to spit the taste out, but Eleanor picked the gag up &#8211; it had rolled next to his face, and was covered with piss as well, much to her delight &#8211; and shoved it in his mouth forcefully enough to take out teeth if he resisted.&nbsp; He shivered, and they both knew the rest of the night would be nothing but rape.&nbsp; 
He was still hard, though &#8211; too worked up from before to go limp so quickly and men had less control of their erections than they liked to think, anyways.&nbsp; Just like women, who could be wet even if they were forced, a man&#8217;s body reacted to hormones, not intellect.&nbsp; A few quick jerking motions and a firm grip on his balls was all it took to resuscitate the flagging staff.&nbsp; Eleanor coated it with a generous amount of lube and sat back onto him, doing her best to enjoy the feel of a cock inching its way deep into her ass.&nbsp; She flagged a little in her excitement &#8211; even with the preparation it still hurt a bit &#8211; until she imagined how he must think he was Elise&#8217;s ass, and that made Eleanor think of her other victim, still lying naked and used &#8211; and usable &#8211; on another bed in the hotel.&nbsp; Suddenly aflame with passion, she found herself eager, almost desperate for some form of satiation and she rode Kevin hard, grunting and swearing at him under her breath.&nbsp; From then on she took the anal like a champ, like she wanted Elise to take it, she felt stuffed full and pumped her fingers into her cunt until she screamed through an orgasm, wondering how many she&#8217;d had so far tonight.&nbsp; More than usual in a session with one of her slaves and she was still warming up.&nbsp; As she shivered through it she felt the dick twitch inside of her bowels and was shocked to realize Kevin&#8217;s prick was tentatively unloading his cum.&nbsp; 
�You fucking bitch!�&nbsp; She remembered just in time to make it a hoarse whisper.&nbsp; �You got your fucking cum in my ass!&nbsp; You&#8217;re gonna fucking pay for that, sissy.�&nbsp; She slapped his face, over and over until it was certain he&#8217;d have bruises &#8211; maybe even a black eye &#8211; while he was still inside her, spasming.&nbsp; She hated him for it, for taking any pleasure while she was savoring a vicious revenge; it like he was raping her instead and that made her hot all over again, made another tiny little orgasm ripple through her sweaty body.&nbsp; Fucking asshole.&nbsp; 
Without a word she stood up, his cock coming out with a disgusting slurp, and pulled another dress out of her bag &#8211; a grey suit and skirt she kept handy in case of an accident at work.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t anything special, but it was a lot easier to put on than the overdone costume dress.&nbsp; For this trip, Eleanor didn&#8217;t bother with the mask or any underwear.&nbsp; Decent again, she grabbed all the rest of his clothing and left the room, slamming the oak door as hard as she could so Kevin would know he&#8217;d been left helpless in a puddle of piss, spread naked and available to anyone who might come in &#8211; or who she might send back.&nbsp; Eleanor took the minor precaution of posting the Do Not Disturb card &#8211; there really wasn&#8217;t much chance anyone would stumble in late at night, though.&nbsp; Even so, she knew that Kevin would writhe in misery and uncertainty, that her absence would be a torture by itself; but hell, for all the damn she gave he could piss himself with fear.&nbsp; 
However, she thought, a girl&#8217;s gotta do what a girl&#8217;s gotta do.&nbsp; She pulled the prick&#8217;s wallet from the remains of his trousers, overjoyed to see the thick wad of cash and plastic, and threw the rest of his attire away.&nbsp; It was time to go shopping, starting with a good drink before the buzz wore off, and time to check in on Elise as well.&nbsp; Since she was destroying the little slut&#8217;s relationship, probably smearing her reputation at work and possibly even getting her into legal trouble, Eleanor figured the least she could do was make sure the whore was still breathing. 









Masquerade

Chapter 4

For the next two hours, Eleanor went on a shopping spree.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t too hard to find stores open late on Friday night, and clich� as it was she was a girl who never lacked enthusiasm for new things.&nbsp; Besides, this was the best sort of shopping possible: Kevin would pay for everything, and when he realized what she&#8217;d done &#8211; and she wondered how long that would take &#8211; he&#8217;d blame everything on Elise.&nbsp; He&#8217;d hate the bitch for it!&nbsp; You really can&#8217;t buy better revenge than that.&nbsp; Well, actually, that was exactly what she was doing�anyways.&nbsp; 
She got the hell away from the WAC first of all; she didn&#8217;t want to be seen at the hotel any more than necessary.&nbsp; Her plan was good, she thought &#8211; but that might just have been the effects of the booze.&nbsp; Speaking of which, first stop was the all night corner store.&nbsp; Being Washington, which was a pansy state when it came to selling alcohol, all they had was beer &#8211; which wouldn&#8217;t mix well &#8211; and wine coolers.&nbsp; It was good enough to keep the buzz, though, and she threw two back as soon as she paid for them.&nbsp; With a chuckle she realized she&#8217;d have to piss again soon.&nbsp; Not that she was planning to do that to Kevin again, as it really wasn&#8217;t her usual thing, but it had been a lot of fun to degrade him.&nbsp; 
The next stop was an ATM.&nbsp; Normally, a wad of filched credit cards wouldn&#8217;t hold much promise for her; sure, hardly anyone checked the damn things, but if someone did she was fucked, and probably on camera.&nbsp; Even if she ran, that could undo all her trickery.&nbsp; But the company had its own secure database, one that used a four digit PIN &#8211; &#8216;just like a bank card,&#8217; they&#8217;d said &#8211; for the CPAs to get access.&nbsp; A couple months ago, while she&#8217;d been warming up on Kevin, she&#8217;d lost her own access due to some indecipherable IT screw up.&nbsp; Kevin, gallant and horny hero that he was, had provided his own.&nbsp; It was reasonable to assume that he used the same code on multiple things, just for simplicity, and a few minutes with the ATM confirmed it.&nbsp; On every single one of his debit cards.&nbsp; Jesus, the pig almost deserved it after that.&nbsp; He had some major cash, too &#8211; holy crap, he had over fifty thousand in his checking accounts.&nbsp; The partnership paid well, but that was still nearly a year&#8217;s salary; who the hell kept that much money around?&nbsp; No wonder he&#8217;d never done a girl&#8217;s ass before, he must never get out to do anything.&nbsp; She took out a grand &#8211; his cards were capped, of course, but she was more than content.&nbsp; It sent a great message, that Elise would take anything from him she could, and it padded tonight&#8217;s expenses.&nbsp; 
Then it was back to the sex shop she&#8217;d visited earlier.&nbsp; The walk was more interesting this time; the night was colder, which sent a shock between her legs, an area still wet from her juices and Kevin&#8217;s mess.&nbsp; She also realized just how short her skirt was; at the office, with hose, it was risqu�.&nbsp; In the hilly stretches of down town, without a scrap underneath, it wasn&#8217;t much more than a display case.&nbsp; She loved it at first, but blushed red when two boys behind her on an escalator openly commented about her hairless cunt &#8211; she even heard the recorded clicking sound effect of a camera phone &#8211; but she only pressed her thighs together and refused to turn around.&nbsp; The last thing she wanted was her face on some internet up-skirt photograph.&nbsp; When she reached her destination she was humiliated and wet all over again, wondering how many people had caught a glimpse on the way.&nbsp; 
The first thing she did was survey the racks for underwear, and she wasn&#8217;t disappointed.&nbsp; It was trashy: the sort of stuff internet porn models wore, designed to display more than cover; just lace, mesh and translucent fabric.&nbsp; It would provide a bit more decency on the rest of the shopping trip, however, and that&#8217;s all she needed.&nbsp; A couple collars and leashes were next, and an anorexic, tattooed sales girl with purple hair named Rachel helped her to find some dildos.&nbsp; Since she&#8217;d never put out, Elise may have been more of a prude than Eleanor thought.&nbsp; If the two victims compared stories later she wanted them to match, so Elise&#8217;s ass was going to have to hurt in the morning.&nbsp; The thought sent its own thrill through her body, and again Eleanor was taken aback.&nbsp; Why all the excitement over a chick?&nbsp; Sure the girl was pretty &#8211; she was gorgeous, the slut &#8211; and she&#8217;d been so nice once, before all this started.&nbsp; Hell, she&#8217;d even displayed some of the submissive traits that had made Kevin so appealing once.&nbsp; For an uncomfortable month she&#8217;d even started to think the younger girl was hitting on her, until she stole Kevin and proved which team she batted for.&nbsp; 
Rachel dropped a hint about her own team, however, with a frank offer to help Eleanor test out her new purchases, and Eleanor followed up with delight.&nbsp; Maybe she could get this out of her system, and although it was Elise&#8217;s sensual, classy body that she was lusting for, her rival was unconscious &#8211; and unlikely to be appreciative when she woke up, either.&nbsp; So she and the clerk flirted and touched one another, groping and laughing over their own obscenity as they perused the toys and began to assemble a sizable pile of merchandise.&nbsp; After all, a lot of her haul would have to be left with Elise; when this little shopping extravaganza came to light, that skank would have to think the shopping trip was her own purchases just as much as Kevin would.&nbsp; They piled on straps, whips, more handcuffs and a couple of PVC suits in Elise&#8217;s size &#8211; the mental picture of her fellow CPA coming to the office dressed in one was just too hilarious to resist, as was the thought of the girl waking up in something really nasty.&nbsp; She bought condoms and two chastity belts &#8211; it felt so damn poetic &#8211; and pulled Rachel into the dressing room when she was trying on a harness.&nbsp; 
The girl was eager and willing, the classic Capitol Hill counter culture lesbian, a half dozen years younger than Eleanor &#8211; just out of the nest and rebelling against her parents.&nbsp; She&#8217;d settle down in a couple years, probably, become just another vapid suburban housewife with a dried up twat and memories of a phase, but for now she&#8217;d do anything.&nbsp; So Eleanor didn&#8217;t waste words.&nbsp; Once the strap on was cinched in place she just pushed the girl to her knees, taking a hard handful of the bright purple hair and plunging the rubber cock down the sales girl&#8217;s face.&nbsp; She gagged and sputtered, but grinned as she flashed her tormentor a challenging look.&nbsp; The next thrusts slipped into her throat without difficulty; obviously the little lezzie knew how to handle dick, too.&nbsp; 
Sexy as the view was, pleasuring a dildo didn&#8217;t do much for Eleanor.&nbsp; Lifting the black rubber penis she pushed Rachel lower, against her pussy, and made guttural sounds of pleasure as the clerk attended her.&nbsp; The little dyke knew what to do with another woman, or Eleanor&#8217;s first time with a woman &#8211; well, first time with a willing and conscious one, anyways &#8211; was too much.&nbsp; She grunted through an orgasm that made up for Kevin&#8217;s immature fumbling, cumming over and over while Rachel refused to stop.&nbsp; 
When her legs threatened to give out Eleanor took charge again.&nbsp; She still hadn&#8217;t bothered to ask permission for anything, even unspoken, and it was such a turn on that she kept with it.&nbsp; She pulled the girl up, tearing hairs out to pry her away from wet cunt.&nbsp; Eleanor bent the girl over without a word, pulling Rachel&#8217;s pink thong to the side and flipping the black skirt up onto her back.&nbsp; She dipped a finger into the girl&#8217;s pussy, grinning at the moisture and Rachel&#8217;s sharp gasp, then she leaned forward, lined up her rubber cock and drove into the girl.&nbsp; 
She pounded Rachel like she&#8217;d thrust against Kevin, hard and brutal.&nbsp; Usually she built her subs up to this point, long and slow, but tonight Eleanor just didn&#8217;t give a shit.&nbsp; She wasn&#8217;t a safe, sane and consensual loving dominatrix.&nbsp; She was a fucking bitch.&nbsp; She wasn&#8217;t even human, just lust and need and tits and pussy and ass.&nbsp; Rachel was too oblivious to care, though; she loved it. She moaned, and when she tried to muffle the sounds so other customers wouldn&#8217;t hear Eleanor spanked her pale cheeks and told her to scream.&nbsp; She did, and begged for more, so loud anyone shopping would hear it, and probably anyone passing by on the street, too.&nbsp; When Rachel came, Eleanor slipped from her pussy and drove into her ass with no more lubrication than her pussy juice.&nbsp; She gave a few hard pushes to end the passion in a burst of pain and lust.&nbsp; The purple haired girl cursed her for it, screaming at the violation and claiming to have been a virgin there, but Eleanor just left her squirming on the floor, hands holding her butt in agony.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Stepping from the curtained room, Eleanor saw a crowd standing in stunned, lust filled silence and a pimple faced geek rooted at the counter with eyes wider than his face.&nbsp; She glared at him, unbuckling the harness and changing into a pair of lace panties before flipping her skirt back into place, too worked up to care that a dozen people saw her flash of nudity.&nbsp; �Ring me up, or do I have to fuck your ass too?�&nbsp; The boy blanched and sped through the purchase.&nbsp; He didn&#8217;t even glance at the name on Kevin&#8217;s corporate purchasing card &#8211; that would be a fun one for her coworker to explain next month &#8211; and as soon as her bags were packed he sprinted towards the dressing rooms.&nbsp; Eleanor wondered if he was going to help Rachel recover or finish fucking her, and hoped he&#8217;d do the latter.&nbsp; 
On the way back to the hotel she stumbled past the brightly lit fa�ade of a tattoo parlor and it seemed to leap out from the line of cinder block buildings along the sidewalk to catch her attention.&nbsp; She stepped inside to flip through books of art and pictures, her mind roiling with ideas of how to get one of her captives tattooed.&nbsp; She&#8217;d had a sissy boy take her initials as a tattoo once, in her college days; a little EE right across his cock.&nbsp; The memory still turned her on even though everything else about that relationship had been a complete failure.&nbsp; She&#8217;d give anything to see &#8216;Slut&#8217; or &#8216;whore&#8217; inked across Elise&#8217;s ass when she awoke, and a tat would be just the thing to completely flip Kevin out.&nbsp; But even drunk off her ass none of the ideas she came up with seemed remotely viable, which probably meant they were self destructively stupid.&nbsp; Not that any of her plans tonight weren&#8217;t, but still: there was no way to get him down here and have him agree to what she wanted, especially without revealing her own identity, and if she brought in a passed out girl to have her labeled a whore the police would be involved.&nbsp; With a huff she gave up, and was turning to leave when her eyes alighted on the rings.&nbsp; Now those, they had some potential!
It only took a few minutes with her blackberry&#8217;s web browser to find out what needed and another minute to memorize the technical details.&nbsp; Stepping up to the counter, she caught the attention of an overweight man, shirtless, covered from head to fingertips with skulls and motorcycles.&nbsp; A name badge identified him as Joe &#8211; she winced as she realized the pin must be sticking through the skin of his chest.&nbsp; �Hey, Joe &#8211; I&#8217;m a piercer from KC, came to Seattle for a bachelorette party�well, long story short, my stuff is at home but the girls are guilting me into working all night &#8211; kind of a girl power thing, and a surprise for hubby.&nbsp; I need to buy some supplies; dozen 14 gauge needles, some goo�.� She blathered on with some more recently-learned lingo while Joe looked at her doubtfully.&nbsp; She couldn&#8217;t really blame him; she was obviously wasted, felt barely clothed, and after all the recent fucking she had to look like hell and smell like a whorehouse.&nbsp; She hoped that fit into her story, a bunch of wild girls on a bender, but in the end she felt pretty certain he was only convinced by the quantity of gear she wanted and the wad of Kevin&#8217;s cash.&nbsp; 
Beaming with a sadistic glee, Eleanor rushed through the rest of her shopping; normally she would have lingered over the racks, but it was late and she found herself more enticed by what awaited her than the items in display cases.&nbsp; Nevertheless, she managed to accumulate several dresses, a collection of jewelry and an armload of lingerie.&nbsp; If the sex didn&#8217;t traumatize Kevin into dumping the slut, finding himself out nearly five thousand dollars should do the trick.&nbsp; 










Masquerade
By Electric Badger
Chapter 5

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eleanor returned to the hotel room where she left Elise to find her coworker just the way she&#8217;d been left: unconscious &#8211; although alive and well &#8211; and completely naked except for a blindfold and the tightly woven rope harness spreading her across the bed.&nbsp; Eleanor was again taken aback by the woman&#8217;s beauty, her perfect pale breasts and the dark hair strewn in a wet, tangled mess across the pillows. At first all she could do was admire the woman&#8217;s smooth thighs and taut stomach, moaning softly while running a hand along the soft curves and inhaling the slut&#8217;s strawberry scent.&nbsp; After a few minutes of savoring her captive, she pulled her hand back reluctantly and set to work.&nbsp; Her rival was already in position, but the bit of fluff on her cunt, even nicely trimmed as it was, would get in the way.&nbsp; Out came a razor and shaving gel; Eleanor enjoyed the act of denuding Elise more than expected, pausing twice to lean forward and stretch out her tongue to tentatively sample the glistening folds in front of her.&nbsp; That first taste of another woman was surprisingly pleasant, nothing like the fish taste she&#8217;d been told to expect &#8211; fucking lying men &#8211; but the task was finished all too quickly.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Finished with shaving, she spread the rings and needles out on the bedside table and crushed another sleeping pill.&nbsp; She carefully sifted the small granules past Elise&#8217;s bruised lips.&nbsp; The girl swallowed unconsciously, responding no doubt to a sense of dry mouth.&nbsp; That done, and knowing the next few minutes would be brutal, Eleanor began to work herself up.&nbsp; She called to mind every slight the bitch stretched out before her had ever given.&nbsp; All the weekends spent with Kevin, knowing damn well that Eleanor was interested in him; the locked conferences in her private office, the knowing looks of the other accountants as they flashed her pity.&nbsp; Pity!&nbsp; As if she were some poor child having a tantrum, not a confident, intelligent professional.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She closed her eyes, remembering Kevin&#8217;s face and his fumbling, bumbling childishness as he told her he couldn&#8217;t go on another date; �Something&#8217;s come up, rather unexpectedly�but maybe, later�when this thing is over, we could�.�&nbsp; The bastard; as though she would wait for some pity fuck when he was done with Elise!&nbsp; Apparently he just expected that she would wait around like some desperate airhead.&nbsp; Her breath started to come in quick gasps and she yelled obscenities as she thrust the needle through the pale woman&#8217;s clit.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Elise came awake with a stifled scream, thrashing helplessly on the bed as the piercings continued inexorably down both her labia.&nbsp; Nine piercings in total, each imbedded with a bright silver ring, allowed a single heart shaped lock, when carefully threaded through the rings and snapped shut, to tightly secure the woman&#8217;s cunt closed and unpenetrable.&nbsp; While she worked, Eleanor spoke reassuring words in Helen&#8217;s accented voice, implying this was entirely Elise&#8217;s idea &#8211; telling the whore how she&#8217;d begged for it, desperate to be pierced and locked up for her mistress.&nbsp; Much of it was probably wasted; the raven haired beauty appeared to have passed out again before it was over.&nbsp; �Your whore cunt is all locked up now, skank.&nbsp; You won&#8217;t be able to fuck anyone else&#8217;s boyfriend for a while; should be a good change for you.�&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The modifications completed, Eleanor strapped on her dildo and squirmed into a harness still wet with her juices and Rachel&#8217;s.&nbsp; She pounded into the bound cunt&#8217;s ass, not bothering with lube &#8211; the point was to make her victim feel she&#8217;d been properly fucked in the morning, after all.&nbsp; In fact, she hoped to tear the bitch open, and she laughed when she saw a trickle of blood.&nbsp; Despite all her anger, however, the revenge fuck lost its appeal quickly; the freakishly unmoving body was simply disturbing, not writhing beneath her in pleasure as her past subs had.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The thought led to another: Elise beneath her, but willing, eager for the punishment, begging for more.&nbsp; A mental flash of her pale skin gleaming with oil and misted with sweat, reddened with whippings and lust, seething against her in the dark.&nbsp; The image was enough for Eleanor to achieve a weak, hesitant orgasm, followed by a rush of shame at her abuse.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She shook it off.&nbsp; I need more to drink, she thought to herself.&nbsp; A lot more.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The rest of her work with Elise was quickly completed.&nbsp;&nbsp; Eleanor just piled most of the night&#8217;s purchases in a corner, only keeping a few choice selections.&nbsp; The erotic purchases scattered across the floor and spilled out of bags &#8211; clear evidence of a drunken night of sexual hedonism for room service to find with the naked, bound woman the next day.&nbsp; As a last touch she threw a half dozen hundred dollar bills across the side table.&nbsp; What would the maid do?&nbsp; Giggle youthfully behind a shy hand and pull out a cell to take a quick, disbelieving recording for youtube?&nbsp; Run to fetch a manager, a parade of suited directors and lawyers filing through the room, nodding sagely, covering erections as they ascertained risk before tampering with their guest?&nbsp; Or perhaps the police would come with disapproving jaded looks, take photographs and compile public reports: &#8216;Miss Lemieux, apprehended on suspicion of prostitution and drug use, was found secured to a bed�&#8217;?&nbsp; 

Whoever came, whatever they did, no doubt their looks, laughs and efforts to release the girl the next morning would be horrifyingly humiliating, and Eleanor wished she could be around to watch it.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She closed the door with a sense of finality, smoothed down her crumpled, tiny dress and punched the elevator key down to the bar.&nbsp;&nbsp;
