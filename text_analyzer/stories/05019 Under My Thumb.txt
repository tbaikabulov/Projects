I joined the Navy fresh out of high
school. Good paying jobs were tough to find in Western
 New York; the steel mills were shutting down; heavy industry
locating down south. 

&nbsp;

�My tour of duty over, I took the civil service
test for Correction Officer; and passed.�
My permanent assignment was at a Class-A Max. Eventually, I got a tower
on days. This was the perfect assignment to get out of population and to pursue
my first love: reading.� 

&nbsp;

By the time I was 33 years old, I
was debt free, with modest savings and the start of a good portfolio of mutual
funds. My house was paid off in full.� I
started to go bald in my twenties; at 33 this was a foregone conclusion. I was
fairly good looking at the time: 200 lbs./ 6'
2&quot;.� I was also single...having yet
to find the right girl.

&nbsp;

People always told me that I was a
nice guy; they couldn't believe that I was a prison guard. The public perceives
us as uneducated brutes. This misconception is reinforced by the liberal news
media bias/pop culture components of our society. I explained to them there is
a time to be tough; when that time comes...&quot; you do what has to be
done&quot;.

&nbsp;

In 1985, I first saw my wife Lisa
at my cousin's wedding reception. I was 33 at the time. Lisa was 22.� She was wearing an emerald green strapless dress
that set- off her green eyes and complimented her shoulder length red
hair.� Lisa wore her hair layered in
those days with long bangs.�� When my
cousin introduced us, I shook her hand, but didn't let go, as was proper.
Instead: I escorted her to the dance floor.

&nbsp;

Bowing to her with a flourish I
exclaimed,&quot; Beautiful angel, from heaven, would you do me the
honor?&quot;...� I spent the
entire evening dancing with Lisa. I was infatuated with her. I couldn't keep my
eyes off of her.� I made up my mind that
whatever it took, I would win her over; we were married exactly one year to the
date.

&nbsp;

During our engagement, Lisa refused
to give me oral sex, although... she enjoyed receiving it.� That didn't change after we were married;
disappointed, I never pushed the issue. 

�

Lisa decided to grow her hair out
to all one length, being tired of the bangs and layers.� I supported and encouraged her in this. I
preferred this style of long hair on women, especially my woman. By 1997, Lisa
had beautiful thick, waist length red hair. Lisa's hairdresser Susan did a
marvelous job. It was well cared for hair, precisely cut and styled, to all one
length, cut blunt and straight across the bottom. It was as soft and smooth as
an angel's wings: my angels' wings.� 

&nbsp;

As we were financially well off,
Lisa quit her job as a receptionist to be a stay at home wife. Lisa was not the
greatest housekeeper, and could barley cook, however; she was great at spending
money. This meant that I was working plenty of overtime to keep up with her
bills.

�I didn't care; I wanted to make her happy.
Lisa was my wife.... my lover...my angel.� 

&nbsp;

Lisa talked me into buying and
expensive toupee.� I took to a lot of
good-natured teasing about my rug. I wore it to please my wife. 

&nbsp;

In the spring of 1997, Lisa decided
to attend the community college, the reason as she put it,� &quot;to broaden my
horizons&quot;. In the fall of 1998, an incident occurred that changed our
relationship in ways that neither of us could have foreseen.

&nbsp;

My car broke down on the way to
work. I called the facility on my cell phone, advised them of the situation,
and requested to use a PL. There was an open slot on the Personal Leave Board
and I was given the day off.� I was only
2 miles from home; after the tow truck left I decided to walk home and suprise
my wife.

(I had put on 50 pounds over the
years. I told myself because of my height, I was able to carry it well. My
doctor told me that even though the test results from my last physical were
good, I could stand to lose at least 20 or more pounds. I walked home knowing
it would do me good. 

&nbsp;

Lisa would not start college for
another week. Since I was walking, she wouldn't hear me pull up in my car. I
would quietly tip toe in and surprise her. We could spend the afternoon making
love and then go to see a movie followed by dinner in Lisa's favorite
restaurant.

&nbsp;

When I was in sight of my house, I
observed a black corvette convertible parked across the street from my house.
Suspicious, I checked it out. The top was down and the factory bucket seats,
covered with slip- on sheepskin seat covers. The college's staff parking
sticker was affixed to the windshield.

&nbsp;

My wife's English Professor owned
such a car. I met the man twice; both times when I attended college open house
with my wife. Lisa thought he was,&quot; brilliant;&quot; I found him
vain and condescending. 

&nbsp;

Professor Aquilo was a tall, slim
man in his early thirties.

I would say he was about:
6'3&quot;/ 170 lbs.� He was fastidious
about his appearance right down to his manicured nails, $ 100.00 haircuts,
expensive silk ties set off with a 1/2-carat diamond stickpin.�� He wore hand sewed monogrammed shirts with
cuff links and $1000.00 plus/ suits.�
Luke's dark hair was full and thick and he wore it on the long side. He
was clean-shaven with dark eyes and long eyelashes.� I had to admit, Luke was handsome... almost
to the point of being pretty.

�

When I got to the back porch, I
could hear soft music coming from my bedroom.�
I quietly entered my house, leaving the back door open; once inside, I
opened my bedroom door a crack and looked inside.� My wife's lover was lying naked in my bed; our
marriage bed, with his eyes closed, a lascivious
smile on his face.� My wife was naked,
performing fellatio on him, his foul hands buried in Lisa's beautiful tresses.

&nbsp;

Enraged beyond reason.... I kicked
the door, slamming it into the wall.... the explosive sound, freezing
them both into inaction and stunned confusion.

&nbsp;

I strode into the room...� pulling my wife away from him, sending her
sprawling, while backhanding her fop lover across his pretty face as he
attempted to sit up.

&nbsp;

Mastering my berserker's rage, I
threw a sheet at Lisa to cover her shame. Shouting at Luke,&quot; Get
dressed you son of a bitch, I'm going to give you a chance to defend
yourself.&quot; Then, I'm going to pound the shit out of your sorry ass
&quot;We will see who is the better man&quot;.
Turning my attention to my cowering wife, &quot;I'll deal with you
later.&quot; I hissed, through clenched teeth.

&nbsp;

With false bravado, the fop
professor, stood up and smirked, clapping his hands as he walked towards
me:&quot; That was quite the performance&quot; &quot;I must hand it to you,
I thought you lacked the imagination for such theatrics, such...comedy&quot;. &quot;Never the less, you buffoon.&quot; &quot;I'm obviously
the better man, I possess your wife, do I not?&quot;
&quot;� &quot;You have been cuckold, not
I&quot;&quot; I will not soil my hands and lower myself to engage in fisticuffs
with an unlettered, unwashed brute such as yourself&quot; &quot;Violence is the
opiate of the mindless drone.&quot; &quot; &quot;If
you lay a hand on me or her, I'll have you arrested and prosecuted to the
fullest extent of the law&quot;.

&nbsp;

Moving quickly, my anger cold and
calculating, I violently slapped him again; but this time with my with my open
palm, verbally mocking him, calling him a &quot;poltroon&quot; and &quot;fop&quot;;
my words stinging his ostentatious ego as my hand did his pretty face.� (Among inmates in prison, slapping a man in
the face is the ultimate expression of contempt and disrespect; it is referred
to, as a bitch slap. Failure to immediately retaliate would only lead to
more of the same. All would extort the punk.... and eventually... he would be: raped.)

&nbsp;

I continued slapping him,
alternating between the palm and back of my hand, jerking his head from side to
side; moving him about in a dance of emasculation and humiliation. 

&nbsp;

I left him cowering on the floor,
his knees drawn to his chest; and sobbing likes a woman. Turning my attention
to my adulterous wife and sneering, I said, &quot;Look at your stud now,
Lisa&quot; pointing at the wretch.� &quot; The epitome of manliness&quot; The living
incarnation of Mars: the God of War&quot;. &quot;The valiant,
&quot;brilliant&quot; professor&quot; &quot;Your lover and protector...� your champion; &quot;Such an inspiring sight
he makes.... weeping on the floor&quot;;&quot; Go to him Pandora&quot; &quot;....&quot;
Be his proud standard bearer.............Lisa
remained frozen on the spot.

&nbsp;

I wasn't through with the miserable
offal. I picked him up by the hair, and made him stand on his feet; threatening
him with physical castration.� &quot;I
believe we have established who is a man and who isn't. In your case, having a
functioning penis doesn't necessarily make you one&quot;. I calmly
espoused.

&nbsp;

&quot; We need to explore your
assessment of me; specifically, and I quote, your comment,&quot; unlettered,
unwashed brute&quot;. &quot;Unwashed brute, perhaps&quot;� &quot;However, you lecherous poltroon; I must
take exception to unlettered&quot; &quot;This notion needs to be dispelled,
shown the light of day, so to speak. 

&quot;Lets
go outside and discuss it ...bitch!&quot; I grabbed his
testicles, squeezing with my implied threat, and led him like a gelding
to his parked muscle car. Following close behind, and wrapped in the sheet,
Lisa stood in the driveway and watched, making no attempt to stop me.

&nbsp;

I threw her emasculated lover over
the hood of his muscle car and gave him a spanking on his bare buttocks with my
open hand. 

&nbsp;

While spanking him, I quoted John
Dryden, from Alexander's Feast (1697): &quot;None but the brave deserves
the fair.� I quoted from J.M.
Barrie in his Rhetorical Address at St. Andrews in May of 1922: &quot;Courage
is the thing. All goes if courage goes!' as I slapped his bottom. I
included Ernest Hemingway, in Men at War (1942),&quot; Cowardice as
distinguished from panic, is almost always simply a lack of ability to suspend
the functioning of the imagination&quot;.�� Before the police arrived, I finished with,
Charles Churchill's &quot;Night&quot; (1761) &quot;Keep up appearances;
there lies the test; the world will give you credit for the rest. Outward be
fair, however foul within; Sin if thou wilt, but then in secret sin&quot;.

&nbsp;

When the police arrived, I stepped
away from the car putting up my hands and displaying my palms to assure them
that I wasn't armed.

&nbsp;

The effete professor retreated to
the drivers side seat, covering himself with the sheepskin seat covers. Snot
and tears were running down his face, his eyes red and swollen from crying, and
his buttocks red and bruised, not to be undone by his sore testicles.

&nbsp;

One of my neighbors, Patty Green,
called the police, explaining the situation and telling them to take their
time. I found out afterwards that she took Lisa in the house and had a talk
with her; I don't know what was said. I can only guess. Her husband, Bill, a
retired city fireman and Town Justice of the Peace, captured the entire episode
with his camcorder; this actually saved me from going to jail or being sued.

&nbsp;

Fortunately, I knew both the
responding officers.

�While laughing, but trying to maintain their
composure, they took my statement and statements from the mentioned witnesses.
When they tried to interview the punk, for a statement, he refused to get out
of his car or give them one; surprisingly, my wife also refused to
cooperate.� 

&nbsp;

Although, I strongly objected, the
officers allowed the absent manhood professor to return to the house and get
dressed. I was very agitated at the thought of him in my bedroom again.� As a result, I started to have chest pains
and was rushed to the hospital by ambulance.

&nbsp;

After a two-day stay in the
hospital, and extensive testing, I was diagnosed with stable angina. This time,
John, my doctor, ordered me to loose 60 lbs or it could worsen and I would be
on medication for life. I left my toupee in the wastebasket of my hospital
room.

&nbsp;

My neighbors and connections kept
me from prosecution. I was given an appearance ticket for disorderly conduct. I
plead guilty and mailed it in; the fine was $50.00. 

&nbsp;

The copy of the tape prevented me
from being sued, why risk further public humiliation. I wasn't the only one
with connections.� I was brought up on
departmental charges for conduct unbecoming an officer. I could either resign
and retire at half-pay, or be fired; I resigned.

&nbsp;

One month later, I was served with
divorce papers. With the help of her lover, Lisa retained a high priced lawyer.
We settled out of court. 

&nbsp;

I agreed to give Lisa everything;
except for my book collection, (I have an extensive selection of Folio Society
and Easton Press Books) and the contents of my study: the barrister bookcases,
my reading lamps, and leather chair with matching ottoman, including my antique
oak, roll top desk and oak futon.� Lisa
agreed to waive her attorney fees, and sign off on my pension.

&nbsp;

My attorney thought I was crazy,
wanting to negotiate a more equitable settlement; I refused to listen.� (It wasn't about the money................it
was never about the money!� I could
always make more.�� I dominated and
humiliated my hated enemy.� I
forced him to crawl at my feet. 

The coward..............the hostage
of my conquest: was paraded on the streets.... a testament to my victory over
him.�� It was never about the
money.............it was about honor!

Luke would remain forever the
hostage...redemption denied! )

&nbsp;

I moved out and found a small
two-room apartment. Lisa put the house up for sale, including all the
appliances and remaining furniture.� When
all the assets from her divorce settlement were calculated, Lisa walked away
with over $ 400,000.00. 

She and her lover moved to
California where he found a position teaching.

&nbsp;

I always wanted to open up a
bookstore and be my own boss; I was tired of punching a clock and would set my
own hours; but first, I need to do something about my health.� 

I started walking; I walked
everywhere possible and in no time lost the sixty pounds.� 

&nbsp;

After two years, I had the down
payment saved for my bookstore.

I took out a loan, and bought a
large brick building for taxes. I remodeled it, and was soon in business for
myself. 

&nbsp;

I lived on the third floor; the
second floor was for storage and overflow from my store. My needs were simple;
I had my books, but.............I was lonely.

&nbsp;

I mentioned before that I was
self-conscious about my hair.

I bought top-of-the-line electric
hair clippers with all the attachments and guide combs.� I kept my hair clipped close to the scalp
with those clippers, minus the guard.

&nbsp;

Two years after my divorce, my
ex-wife walked into my bookstore..........�
I was putting some books away, and my back was to her. Lisa politely
asked if the owner was available. I recognized her voice right away; it was
obvious that she didn't recognize me, having lost sixty pounds, with a shaved
head; the toupee gone.� I 

&nbsp;

When I turned around, to face her,
the look on her face was priceless. I too was surprised; Lisa had put on some
weight, (when we were married, she was always dieting and spending hours at
her heath club exercising, trying to look like some of the near emaciated young
models found in fashion magazines) I liked her this way, a little plump. It
had softened her features and rounded her figure; especially her breasts and
hips; yes this was definitely an improvement. 

&nbsp;

What I didn't like was what she had
done to her hair. Instead of her beautiful shade of red auburn, and waist
length, it was jet black and styled in tight frizzy curls of different lengths,
shorter around her face and longer in the back. Even her bangs were curled. At
it's longest it just touched Lisa's shoulders; this had to be her fop lovers
doing. Either by preference or design, he had ruined her beautiful long hair.

&nbsp;

We stood there and looked at one
another for a time. Finally, I broke the silence and said, &quot; Is there
something I can do for you, Lisa?&quot; &quot;I came here to ask you something&quot;,
she replied 

I just looked at her not knowing
what to say next. Lisa continued,

&quot;Do you hate me Adam? I
can't blame you if you do, but I need to know.&quot; &quot;Do you still hate
me?'�� &quot;Did you come all the way
from California to ask me that, Lisa? I said, starting to get angry.

&nbsp;

&quot;You committed adultery,
Lisa,&quot; &quot;You filed for divorce and took damn near everything that I
ever worked for&quot;.� &quot;Do I hate
you?&quot; &quot;You want to know if I hate you?&quot; I replied,
almost shouting

&nbsp;

�Lisa started crying. &quot;Stop
that will you, just stops it&quot; I'll answer your question; no I don't hate
you Lisa, I'm over those feelings now&quot;. &quot;I have moved on with my
life&quot;. &quot; Is that what you wanted to hear? Then I'm glad I made you
feel better about yourself.&quot;&quot;You have your closure&quot;� &quot;Now you can go back to your lover, or
husband or whatever he is to you and live happily-ever-after&quot;; As I
turned back to my work.

&nbsp;

Then the floodgates really broke
loose, she started sobbing, uncontrollably, and that wasn't like her.� The only other time she acted like this was
when her father died; she was in bed for a week; this wasn't an act; something
was seriously wrong.� I did the only
thing I could do; I took her up to my apartment and let her lie down.� When she calmed down, I went downstairs to
the bookstore and telephoned her sister, Janice.

&nbsp;

Janice told me that Lisa allowed
Luke invest her money from the divorce settlement.� &quot;They bought a condominium in her
name, he said for tax purposes&quot;. She sighed&quot; Luke had her
convinced that her investments were making landmark dividends and she believed
him; we believed him.&quot;�� &quot;Lisa
likes to spend money, you know that.&quot;�
&quot;Luke encouraged her to spend money on them.&quot; They sent the
children lavish gifts.&quot; They got married, but that was a scam too&quot;.
The minister was defrocked with his wife as the witness. The marriage
certificate was a forgery. &quot; He moved the bulk of her money to an over
seas account in his name&quot;&quot; When she was deeply in debt, her money
gone and her credit ruined he left her; and it was all perfectly legal. Luke
covered his tracks well.&quot;&quot; We believe he is teaching in Canada
now&quot;.

&nbsp;

&quot; You loved Lisa,
Adam.&quot;� We know that, and she knows
that&quot;� &quot; It is now obvious that
Lisa was only a trophy to Luke&quot;. &quot;But that changed, too&quot; Luke
hates you Adam&quot;.� Janice
said,&quot;He never forgave her for the beating that you gave him&quot;. Adding
&quot;It's a shame you didn't kill the bastard.&quot;� 

&nbsp;

&quot;Ruining her was his way of
getting back at you&quot;.� &quot;I
always liked you Adam&quot;. &quot;Lisa did a terrible thing to you, there is
no doubt about that&quot;. &quot;But she is my sister, Adam&quot;.� My husband and I loaned her money to invest
for us&quot;. &quot;We thought she was doing well.&quot; &quot;We took a second
mortgage on our house.&quot; &quot;It's all gone; she can't pay us
back.&quot;� &quot;My husband won't have
anything to do with her now; I can't go against him, I have my children to
think about.&quot; &quot; I forgave my sister Adam&quot; &quot;I prayed to God
that someday you would too&quot;.

&nbsp;

I went back upstairs to my
apartment and found Lisa quietly waiting for me to return. I informed her that
Janice had told me everything.� I told
her that she could stay, if she was willing to work for room and board
only.� Lisa's face lit up at my offer.

She got up off the futon and hugged
me, saying that she would do anything if I would just give her a second chance.

&quot;Lisa&quot;, I said, I will
take you back and give you a second chance. I am all for a fresh chance for us,
but I will never remarry you.&quot; 

&quot; We can live together, but
never again will we be equals.&quot; &quot;You need to understand that right
now.&quot; Lisa started to speak and I stopped her by gently putting my
hand over her mouth and growling, &quot;Be silent woman. I'm not done
speaking.&quot; enjoying the look in her eyes.

&quot;

You will do as I say in all things,
without reservation or hesitation.&quot; &quot;You will have to prove your
complete and devoted commitment to me to be worthy of my attention and share
my bed &quot;&quot;Further, you will always tell me the truth&quot; Your
life will revolve around me and you will submit to me totally.&quot;� &quot;Those are my terms&quot;. &quot;I'm
going for a walk now, if I find you here when I return, I'll have my
answer.&quot; 

&nbsp;

When I returned 2 hours later, I
found Lisa standing naked, with her wrists crossed and her head down, waiting.
As she was standing there, I thought to myself: &quot; This just might work
out after all&quot; &quot;I have her exactly I want her now: under my thumb&quot;.

&nbsp;

Placing my hand on her shoulders,
and pushing, I forced her to kneel. Looking into her green eyes, I sternly
said,&quot; Are you afraid of me now, Lisa?&quot;

Looking down, Lisa whispered,&quot;
Yes&quot;.� Gently taking her chin
between my thumb and forefinger, I lifted her head to meet my eyes, and said,
&quot;Look at me Lisa, tell me the truth&quot;. &quot;If you are afraid of
me, why did you decide to stay?&quot; Swallowing, then licking her lips
Lisa said, &quot;You...you beat and ah.... humiliated Luke and had him crawling
on the floor... you were so angry, I didn't know what to think. He didn't fight
back and was crying................. &quot;What else, Lisa? &quot;Finish your
sentence.&quot; &quot;I was terrified, that you were going to kill him.,&quot;
she said, trembling and looking down. &quot;I never realized how
dangerous you were until then.&quot; &quot;You were always such a gentle man,
you hardly ever raised your voice to me.&quot; &quot;You were willing to fight
for me and I left you. I'm so ashamed, Adam.... I am so ashamed&quot;.&quot;
How can you even look at me now, and yet you took me back&quot;. �&quot;You were my angel Lisa, perhaps you
can be again,&quot; I offered. &quot;What happened to your clothes Lisa,
and where is your purse, I don't see them?&quot; 

&quot;Why were you naked when I got
back? I sternly inquired.

&nbsp;

&quot;I burned them,&quot;
she said lifting her head,&quot; I burned everything in your incinerator in
the basement&quot;.&quot; I thought you would be pleased, I am ready to submit
totally in every way&quot;. She promised.

&quot;I have nothing Adam, no
money, no credit, no possessions, nothing, Adam... only you... I only want you
to love me as you once did!&quot; &quot;I am drawn to your strength and
passion; it compliments your gentle ways.&quot; I am terrified of your subdued
rage, just under the surface and yet aroused by it at the same time.&quot;
&quot; Your ability to master your rage and totally dominate scares me, yet
makes me feel safe...it's hard to explain, but I know in my heart that there is
still a chance for you to love me again&quot; &quot;I will be happy to take
whatever you give me, whatever you decide,&quot;

&nbsp;

Lisa's confession was not
unexpected. I suspected that she would eventually submit when I placed my hand
over her mouth earlier and she meekly complied.�
Her confession confirmed and defined her position in my life; Lisa would
remain my chattel by mutual consent.

&nbsp;

I unzipped my fly and exposed my
manhood, grabbing Lisa's hair firmly at the back of her head, burying my
fingers in her dry over processed curls.�
Lisa began sucking and licking, looking up at me for my approval. &quot;You're
doing fine sweetheart&quot;, I assured her, as I removed a pair of barber
scissors, purchased during my walk.

&quot;Your present hairstyle
doesn't suit you; we will soon change that&quot;

Taking my time as she sucked, I
grasped each curl between my fingers, pulling it straight and cutting it free
from her head.� I dropped each of the
shorn curls to the floor, the pile growing with each snip.

&nbsp;

When I had finished taking my
pleasure with her mouth, her haircut was completed. Extending my hand to her, I
said,&quot; It's almost midnight, do you want to share my bed?&quot;�� Lisa said &quot;yes&quot;, kissing my hand,
waiting to be helped to her feet.� I
rubbed Lisa's head, the remaining hair about an inch long and somewhat softer.

&nbsp;

Pointing to the floor, I ordered
her to go down on her hands and knees, Lisa quickly complying.� &quot;Good girl, now lean forward and put
your head down, rest it on your hands&quot;................perfect, now lift
your ass higher, a little more...stop, hold that position and don't move until
I tell you otherwise&quot;� 

&nbsp;

I enjoyed the feeling of her plump
ass cheeks quiver as they met my palm; the sharp slapping sounds music to my
ears. Lisa's was soon sobbing, her tears soaking the carpet and begging me to
stop; but she held her position like a well-trained Irish Setter bitch, from
impeccable bloodlines.� 

&nbsp;

When her buttocks were beet red, it
was time to stop, I had no intentions of leaving bruises.� Warning her to hold point, I went into my
bedroom to get undressed and took a leisurely shower.

&nbsp;

I returned with a jar of cocoa
butter and gently rubbed it on her sore bottom and exposed pussy lips.� I probed her with my fingers, playing with
her flower until she was swollen and dripping.

I took her from behind, ramming
hard and deep, paying no mind to her freshly spanked ass. Lisa's cries of pain
were replaced with squeals of pleasure, followed by the loud moans of orgasm.

&nbsp;

In the morning Lisa was given the
task of cleaning the apartment from top to bottom; not that it needed to be
cleaned, Lisa needed to learn to clean a house properly, once and for all.

&nbsp;

Besides, it was a pleasure to watch
her clean in the nude. 

If I found the smallest thing
wrong, I made her do the job over.� I
made a mental note to retile the bathroom and kitchen in all white.

&nbsp;

That evening after supper, I had
Lisa kneel before me in the empty bathtub. Plugging in my clippers, with the
1/4&quot;(6mm) guide comb in place, I clipped Lisa's hair to 1/4&quot; all the
way around. 

&nbsp;

When I finished with her head. I
had her stand while I shaved her pussy with the clippers minus the guide.� I lathered and shaved her pussy twice, until
Lisa had the smooth hairless mound of a young girl; telling her that she was
expected to shave daily and keep it this way.

&nbsp;

I suggested that Lisa shower and
come to bed. Lisa cleaned the bathroom, leaving it spotless.� She came out of the bathroom with a towel
around her middle; she didn't need one for her hair.

&nbsp;

When Lisa got into bed, I gently
pushed my thumb into her mouth and she began sucking. I shook my head,
frowning, looking down.

Lisa immediately put her head
between my legs and began sucking hungrily, eager to please me, her beautiful
green eyes begging my approval.� I rubbed
her head to soothe and assure her that everything was fine. I told her that I
would keep her hair clipped to a 1/4&quot;(6mm) until her natural auburn color
grew out. In time, if she were a good girl, I would let her grow her hair out.

&nbsp;

I allowed her to cuddle next to me
and I held her, stroking her, talking to her softly in soothing tones.� I quietly told her some of my plans for her.
I promised her that I would talk to her sister's husband and seek a compromise
so that she could spend time with Janice.�
We fell asleep in each other's arms, both satisfied and looking to the
future...........................................................

&nbsp;

Lisa and I have been living
together now for these past five years.

She is attentive and obedient and
rarely leaves my side. Lisa's auburn hair is now long and thick again, reaching
to the middle of her back.� Lisa has
maintained her full voluptuous figure, remaining a little plump.� 

&nbsp;

We work side-by-side in the
bookstore, and she has become an asset to the business.� When things are slow, I will lock the door
and insert my thumb, fellatio on my terms, Lisa's duty and pleasure.

&nbsp;

After my divorce, I never purchased
another television; I don't own one now.�
We take long walks most evenings, weather permitting.

Then return to the apartment to
read or listen to music.� Some evening we
just sit on the couch and cuddle, not saying a thing.

Because of my influence and control
over her; Lisa has discovered

a love of poetry. She has read
every book of poetry I own, and now reads and writes poetry on-line; of course,
I strictly monitor her on-line use.� 

&nbsp;

Lisa has many websites saved in her
favorites under &quot;hair care&quot; Lisa loves wearing her hair long. She has
been taught that her long hair is a privilege, granted to her as proof that she
is worthy of my attention 

&nbsp;

One of her favorite hair websites,
features a woman who models her own hair in different upswept hairstyles:
Mostly buns and french twists.�� Lisa is
free to choose and bun style she pleases as long as she doesn't use hair spray.
I find it very erotic to remove the pins from her hair, letting it fall loose
and free.� My favorite bun is the plain
cinnamon bun, it being both elegant and simple.�
When Lisa's hair is waist length again, her cinnamon bun will be the
perfect size.� 

&nbsp;

As I am writing this down, Lisa is
upstairs making my lunch.� Lisa keeps the
apartment immaculate now, taking pride in the accomplishment, as she should.
Unfortunately she remains a mediocre cook.

&nbsp;

I guess you can't have
everything...but then again, I don't need everything..........� I have my &quot;&quot;angel&quot;
