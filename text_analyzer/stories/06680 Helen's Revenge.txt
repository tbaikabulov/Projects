Helen's Revenge
Provided By: BDSM Librarywww.bdsmlibrary.com
Synopsis: Helen finds her hsuband and the baby sitter having an affair. She plots her revenge, but it doesnt quite go to plan.






Helen looked at the sleeping form of Becca. At sixteen, Becca was Helen&#8217;s babysitter, and had been for well over a year. But a short while ago she had found out that Becca was more than a babysitter, she had enticed Helen&#8217;s husband into bed, though Helen actually thought both were a\t fault, Jim was safe. Becca, on the other hand, was anything but safe.

Helen had found out accidentally that Becca and Jim were screwing. It was a single sock, one of Becca&#8217;s, that had somehow got under Helen&#8217;s bed. There was no reason for it to be there, as Becca had no reason to be in that room, and certainly no reason to be leaving a sock.

Helen didn&#8217;t want to accuse Becca without proof, so had invested in a hidden camera. She obviously didn&#8217;t tell Jim it was there, but was still shocked when she looked at the recordings.

Jim was laying naked on his back, with Becca leaning over him, his cock in her mouth. Hewlen did have to admire the girl&#8217;s style, but not on her husband. On anyone else, it would have been fine, but not Jim. Jim was hers, and was not for sharing.

Jim had been away on business the night Helen had watched the film, watching horrified as Becca let Jim&#8217;s cock clip from her mouth, as she moved to sit astride him, guiding him towards, and into her young pussy. Helen looked on as she saw Jim&#8217;s cock slowly disappear inside her babysitter, only to emerge again as Becca lifted her hips, slowly riding him.

Jim&#8217;s hands moved to her hips, and used them to pull the girl down harder onto his cock. Although the film was silent, Helen could hear in her mind the familiar sound of Jim&#8217;s hips slamming against flesh, usually her own.

She watched his face for the tell tale signs that he was about to cum, hoping beyond hope that he would pull out before he did cum. But she saw the expression she knew so well, the frantic movements of his hips, the way he slammed her down harder onto him.

He didn&#8217;t pull out, shooting his cum deep inside Becca, who leaned forwards and kissed him hard on the lips, her own body shuddering, as she obviously came at the same time.

Three times Helen watched the film, each time, hoping Jim would pull out. But the films remained the same, and each time Jim&#8217;s and Becca;s hips were crushed together as she saw the look in his eyes, saying he had cum.

Twice more the camera had caught Jim and Becca in her bed, and each time Jim had stayed inside her as he came. Was he trying to get her pregnant? Was Becca trying to get pregnant?

But it was the fourth time that had really upset Helen.

Helen was staying at her mother&#8217;s for the weekend, and Jim was supposed to be away on business, leaving Becca and little Joe alone in the house.

But around ten thirty, Jim could clearly be seen laying on the bed, with Becca, wearing a bathrobe standing next to the bed. Jim reached up and pulled at the belt on the robe, smiling as it fell open, and off Becca&#8217;s shoulders, falling to the floor, revealing Helen&#8217;s own underwear. Underwear she had bought to excite Jim, but had not yet worn.

This was the last straw. Helen knew she couldn&#8217;t take anymore, but also knew she could not bring it out into the open. If she raised hell, Jim may just choose the younger girl, the sexier girl. 

No. she could not raise hell, but nor could she allow this to go on indefinitely. Helen felt she was left with little option, and began to hatch her plot of revenge.

Getting Becca to drink a drug would never prove to be a problem. She always drank copious amounts of Helen&#8217;s juice, with permission, so putting the drug into the juice was the easy part. It was what she was going to do afterwards that would take carefyl&nbsp; planning.

It had taken several month of covert work to get what Helen wanted, and to leave no trace to herself. Using Jim&#8217;s details she had bought a derelict barn several miles away, in a deserted area, and all of the tools she would need, many of them off an internet auction site. 

Jim would never know of the purchases, as he had never once, since she had known him, actually look at his bank statements. Most of them ended up in the bin un-opened. Only if Helen got to the mail first were they opened.

But he had noticed nothing, even though the barn was not cheap. He could afford it, and not miss the money.

Now, it was a matter of choosing the right time to exact her revenge on the unsuspecting Becca. This came a couple of months later, when Jim was genuinely away on business, out of the country. Helen chose that weekend to �stay at her parents�, meaning that Becca would be required to baby sit for her.

The drug was fast acting, but Helen sat in her car for an hour after leaving the house, making sure before she left that Becca had drunk one glass of the juice. If Becca managed to pour a second, it would be a minor miracle, but Helen wanted to play on the safe side.

When she eventually returned to the house, she found Becca asleep on the couch, the drug had worked. Now for her plan to come to fruition.

Working quickly, and using the scissors, Helen began to cut away Becca&#8217;s clothing, leaving her naked. She looked at the helpless girl and could see from the large rounded tits, the slim waist and the swelling hips what Jim could see in her. but that was the problem. Had he seen it in her, or had she taken advantage of Jim. She was pretty much convinced it was a mutual thing.

Helen had parked her car at the back of the house, and slowly dragged Becca in that direction, ignoring the fact that as she had pulled the sleeping girl from the sofa she had banged her head on the floor. That was going to be the least of Becca&#8217;s problems.

The drive to the barn was almost two hours, but Becca would sleep all the way there. Turning on the engine, Helen moved the car forwards. The radio was on low, keeping her company on the long journey. Becca was safely out of sight in the boot of the car, and as Helen didn&#8217;t want any unexpected stops, she made sure she drove carefully, and stayed within the speed limits.

After an hour, Helen turned off the motorway, and headed through back roads, some of them badly twisting, forcing her to drive slowly. The radio was doing a good job of keeping her awake, though the night made her eyes still feel a little heavy. Pulling into a small lay-by Helen took the flask from the seat next to her and poured herself a cup of coffee, as she ran through her plans in her mind.

Becca would regret fucking Helen&#8217;s husband for the rest of her life.

Feeling better after the coffee, Helen restarted the car and drove off. She was only half an hour away from the barn, and she knew that there would be no traffic on the road now. The barn was hidden in a small forest, served only by a narrow track road which twisted and turned as it wound its way to the large steel gate.

Helen had left the gate open the last time she had been to the barn, enabling her to drive straight through, stopping outside the barn, before going back to lock the gate again. The trees surrounding the barn blocked out the dim light from the low watt bulb hanging from the ceiling. 

Dragging Becca from the car and into the barn, Helen dropped the girl against one wall, ignoring the fact she was laying on her arms. Becca&#8217;s circulation was the least of her problems.

Helen left Becca against the wall and walked to the other end of the barn, where she had been working for the past few weeks, getting everything ready for tonight. The hole was a little over five feet deep, and around five feet square. She had used the digger she had bought, also in her husband&#8217;s name, to dig the hole, and she was now quite happy with it. 

Walking back to where Becca lay, still unconscious, Helen took a pair of cutters from a nearby table and began to cut Becca&#8217;s clothes away, until the young girl lay naked, and then dragged her by the feet to the other end of the barn, towards the hole.

It took Helen quite a bit of effort to get Becca into the hole, sitting with her back against one of the walls. Satisfied, Helen climbed out and stood looking down. It would be another hour or so before Becca woke up, but Helen wanted everything ready by that time.

Working quickly, Helen used a shovel to start refilling the hole with the dirt she had taken out from it with the digger. It took several minutes before Becca;s outstretched legs were finally covered. Helen was getting rather hot, and forced to remove her shirt, placing it on the digger, out of the way.

By the time the dirt came up to Becca&#8217;s waist, Helen needed a rest, but knew she could only allow herself a few minutes. She didn&#8217;t want Becca waking up too early. 

After a few minutes Helen went back to work. She had known it would not be easy to do this with the shovel. But it was a personal; thing, and the digger was too impersonal for this part of the job.

Three quarters of an hour later, the dirt now came up to Becca&#8217;s neck, which is where Helen wanted it to come to, leaving just her head above the dirt, yet still hidden deep in the hole. The sheer weight of the dirt would prevent Becca getting free.

Finally, Helen sat to one side of the hole and waited. It would be a while yet before Becca regained consciousness.

Moving to the car she returned with the rest of her flask of coffee, and poured herself a drink, the smell of the coffee reviving her. she hadn&#8217;t realised how much the work would take out of her. perhaps she should have dug the hole a little shallower, but that meant less weight on Becca, and a chance she could get free. Helen wondered if she should have tied Becca&#8217;s hands behind her back, but it was too late for that now. she had to rely on the weight to hold the young adulterer.

She was lost in her thoughts and didn&#8217;t hear the slight noise behind her, and by the time the shovel crashed into the back of her head, it was far too late. As she lost consciousness herself, she thought she caught a glimpse of Jim&#8217;s face, but darkness quickly washed all thought from her mind.

Jim stood looking down at his wife. A slight trickle of blood ran from the head wound, but quickly checking her pulse, and realising she was still yet alive, he was satisfied.

Using the same cutters Helen had used to cut through Becca&#8217;s clothing, Jim soon had his wife naked. Unlike Helen had done, Jim brought both of Helen&#8217;s arms behind her back, tying them together at the wrists and the elbows, making sure that she would not be able to use them to get free, before tying her legs together at both the ankles and the knees. The sight of his wife, naked and helpless, made him smile.

Leaving her on the ground, Jim started up the digger and began a new hole, less than three feet away from the hole Becca was still ensconced in. he had considered getting Becca out and using the same hole. But that would mean tying Becca up as well, and she was safe where she was. So a second hole it was.

It didn&#8217;t take long to dig the hole, and soon it was almost a mirror to the one Becca occupied.

Helen was still unconscious as Jim lowered her into it, and, unlike Helen, used the digger to start refilling the hole. He didn&#8217;t know how long she would be out cold, but tied as she was, it didn&#8217;t really matter. She couldn&#8217;t get free no matter how hard she tried.

It took Jim less than twenty minutes to have the hole filled up the same as Becca&#8217;s hole, up to Helen&#8217;s neck. Now, he could wait.

Helen woke up slowly, feeling the pain in her head long before she finished waking. She tried to move her hands to ease the pain, but nothing would move, not her hands, or her legs. it took a few seconds to realise what had happened, and then saw Jim&#8217;s face peering over the edge of the hole, a smile on his lips.

�What are you doing?� Helen screamed.

�Getting a divorce� Jim laughed. �I like what you did to Becca, nice touch, leaving her head free until she woke up, so she could see and feel you covering her over. She&#8217;s awake now, by the way, but gagged. She started screaming, and I hate that. I do hope you don&#8217;t give me a reason to gag you as well.�

�I thought you were away?� Helen dint know what to say, and she knew that what she had just said wasn&#8217;t what she wanted to say.

�It was a lie.� Said Jim, nonchalantly. �A little while ago the bank manager rang me about some big spending I had been doing recently. So I checked my account. You don&#8217;t do things by half, do you Helen? I was, to say the least, a little surprised to discover I had bought a barn. I didn&#8217;t actually recall doing so, nor a digger. So I had to check it out. And last week I followed you here, and waited until you left. I didn&#8217;t know why, at first, you had bought the barn, but then when I watched you over the past few days, digging that hole, I thought that perhaps you were going to kill me and bury me here. But then, something strange happened. I got a phone call offering me an upgrade on the security camera I had purchased. Imagine my surprise when the man came to upgrade it, and I found it trained on the bed in our bedroom. At first I thought maybe you were filming our sex together, so you could use it to masturbate to when I wasn&#8217;t here. But you were not in any of the films. Were you? They were of me and Becca. It wasn&#8217;t hard to put two and two together, and I knew, then, that the hole wasn&#8217;t for me.�

Helen screamed at him to let her go, but Jim just laughed.

�Actually, sweetheart, you have helped me. Becca was getting too, how do you say it? Clingy. She wanted me to divorce you, and let her move in with me, as your replacement. I sort of strung her along, saying I would consider it, but I was never going to do so. she&#8217;s a great shag, don&#8217;t get me wrong, but I couldn&#8217;t live with her. but now you have sorted that problem out for me as well. This way I can get rid of both of you, at the same time.�

Helen could hear muffled screams from nearby, and knew it was Becca, now awake, listening to what Jim had just said.

�Right ladies, I am going to leave you here for now. I shall be back in the morning. Becca cant talk, Helen, and I don&#8217;t think she wants to hear anything you have to say. After all. You did try to kill her, and if I had not come along, you would have done so. so I don&#8217;t think she wants to hear anything you have to say.� With that Jim leant into the hole holding bits and pieces of Helen&#8217;s clothes, and forced her mouth open, pressing the material deep into his wife&#8217;s mouth, before using a piece of thin rope to hold it in place.

�There� Jim laughed again. �Now neither of you has to listen to the other. I will see you in a few hours ladies. Don&#8217;t go anywhere�.

Helen could hear Jim still laughing as he walked away. Her head still hurt badly from where he had struck her, but there was nothing she could do to ease the pain. She tried in vain to get free, trying to force her body out of the dirt, but it was far too heavy for her to move it, especially with her hands tied behind her back.

Surely Jim wouldn&#8217;t do this. She was the mother of his child, little Joey.

But as she remembered the way he had crept up on her, and had hit her with the shovel, she figured he&nbsp; was capable of anything.

No matter how much she struggled, Helen was unable to move as much as half an inch of the dirt holding her down, and now she knew how Becca must be feeling. The plans for Becca would have worked admirably, if they were not now also working on her.

She tried in vain to scream for help, but the gag muffled the screams to almost nothing. Helen knew that no-one would hear her, she had chosen the barn for that purpose, but she knew she had to do something in an effort to get free before Jim returned.

Becca had been silent for some time when daylight slowly began to filter through the barn&#8217;s dirty and cracked windows. Whether she was still alive or not, Helen could not see, but she was able to feel how tight her own chest was with the pressure of the dirt. She was breathing mostly through her nose, as the gag would not let a lot of air in.

Helen, strangely enough considering it was she herself who had done the deed. Was worried for Becca, as Helen heard footsteps outside. She hadn&#8217;t heard the car arrive, but even before she saw his head peep over the top of the hole, she knew it ws Jim.

Only then did she hear Becca moan again, though it sounded a little weak. That could have been the gag or not, Helen could not see.

�Good morning ladies�. Jim&#8217;s voice was light and easy, as if he had not a care in the world. Certainly not as if he held the lives of two women in his hands.

�I have given some thought to your predicament� he continued. �I could, of course, just leave you here to die slowly from exhaustion or starvation, but that would be really cruel. Considering that you, Helen, have been a good wife and a great mother. No-one could argue that point. You have always done best for our son, Joey. And you Becca,&nbsp; always arrive punctually, never moaned if we got home late and detained you, and to be honest, a fantastic shag. You really made sex worth having. So no. leaving you like this is not really an option.�

Helen&#8217;s hopes were# suddenly raised that perhaps he was about to free them, but those hopes were soon dashed as Jim spoke on.

�I have decided to refurbish this little barn, as a sort of memorial to both of you. And you are both to become an integral part of it. Later today I shall be getting a concrete mixer, and will be renewing the floor, which means, unfortunately, the floor does need to be level first. I can hardly concrete over two big holes, can I? So no. you wont be starving to death ladies, and believe me, I shall always remember you, every time I come to the barn.�

Helen heard a shovel hit dirt, and waited with bated breath for Jim to start filling in the hole. Covering up her head, but instead she heard a moan from Becca&#8217;s hole. He was starting on hers first. how long it would take she could not guess, but with every shovel full of dirt that she could hear going into the hole. Brought her own impending doom that much closer.

Even as she was packed in dirt in her own hole, fear made her body act strangely, and she could feel herself urinating. There was no splash, just a simple release as the dirt soaked it up. At first she wasn&#8217;t even sure she had actually pissed, all feelings felt strange to her now. she wasn&#8217;t even able to move a single finger, and that inability to move at all, seemed to be like a living death. Though that would end soon, she told herself, as she heard Jim patting the shovel on the ground a few feet away. He had obviously filled Becca&#8217;s hole in, and would be starting on hers soon.

Jim stood above her hole looking down at her.

�Becca is dead, sweetheart. She didn&#8217;t fight it, not that she really could, but she seemed to have accepted her fate. Are you going to accept yours? Of course you aren&#8217;t� Jim laughed. �You still hope this is a dream, and you will wake up at home. On the bed. I meant what I said about you being a great mother and a good wife. But you really were too greedy, and by buying this place in my name? Clever touch, and one you would have got away with, but the bank manager didn&#8217;t understand and called me. And now, darling, its time to get the interest back on all the money of mine that you have spent. �

Jim disappeared from the top of the hole, and Helen heard the motor on the digger start up. Less than a minute later dirt began to cascade into her hole, and she began to scream louder than before, but still to no avail.

As the dirt slowly began to cover her face, Helen began to panic even more, her breath coming in sharp gasps, fighting for each one. She tried to shake the dirt off her face and head, but as the minutes past, her head began to slow down, until, finally, the dirt was holding her head in one place, as the level of the dirt rose above her nose, and her eyes. She had no recollection of anything after that point. The dirt taking away her breath. 

She would have been proud of what Jim had done with the barn. It was a veritable palace when he had completed the refurbishments. He often went there in summer months to relax.
