The Actually Big Event
WITH OVER 8 billion people on the planet, that means that at any given moment of any given day, around 5 million people are some way through the process of having sex; a solid � million of which are in the process of starting penetration, another � million are half-way through, and another � million are just finishing up.
So it is not surprising that at The Point in Time That Completely Changed Everything About the Course of Human History, we were just 2 people among the 5 million who were so pre-occupied fucking ourselves senseless. With penetration having been achieved, we missed the Big Event altogether. In fact, we still didn't know anything about it the next morning when we woke up and did it again. And again.
See, we were celebrating our six month anniversary; six months of clandestine dating, and we were just beginning to discover the interesting parts of each other. Like the idea that Priscilla was a hard core dyed-in-the-wool masochist, and the idea of a screaming orgasm for her involved actual screaming. Students are so much fun to fuck. So in some ways, the idea that we were left behind with the Curse was the best thing that could ever happen to us.
The world population was reduced in the twinkling of an eye to the levels of the world at the Birth of Christ. Kinda funny, huh. Because, as it turned out, the important thing wasn't WHAT you believed, but THAT you believed. The trumpets blared, the skies pealed open, and the Lord himself returned. At least, according to the Christian view. The Moslems saw Mohammed, the Buddhists saw Buddha, the Hindus saw Vishnu or Krishna or Ganesh or whoever, god knows what the Wiccans and the Taoists and the New Agers saw. He gathered the chosen, and left. No, really. But not before pronouncing The Curse on the Remainder. The god damn fucking Curse.
184,000,000 staunch atheists left on Earth, with a surprisingly high number of the Remaining being European. And Priscilla and I were just 2 of the 100,000 or so people who were too busy at the time with each other's orgasms to notice that the world ended. 4-million-9 others were also too busy, but then they were among the taken. Kinda like a bonus. Other people paid attention that day, but we didn't know about that yet.
The First Fall
WHEN WE tried to get back to our lives the next afternoon, the weirdness of our situation started to become apparent. There just wasn't anyone around. I mean, sure, the idea that there wasn't actually anybody we cared about in this podunk town anyway didn't change the eerie feeling when one discovers that the people you thought were just there were all just gone. No notes, no explanations, nothing on TV except fuzz. The phones went away that afternoon; the power went down in 2 days.
So we celebrated by banging each other blind. Another piece of The Curse we were victim of, but didn't understand and so just went with it. That was the first time I tied her up, and hit her with whatever I could find, my hands, my shoes, my belt, shower rod, kitchen utensils, and finally a wire hanger. She thanked me by getting her tongue in my ass, and when we screwed, I pinched her nipples with pliers. She swallowed mine and her own piss, and her ass became mine, too.
Being a small podunk town, the food ran out in 3 months, even raiding the local grocery store, the bar, the pantries in all 47 houses, the school, everywhere. When we accepted the idea that no one was coming to save us, we started to make plans to get out and move on with our lives. Kinda like an adventure. When we weren't too busy celebrating our astounding good luck by fucking, fucking, and more fucking.
When we made it to the next town to the west, it was deserted. Only a little bit larger than home, so we lasted maybe 5 months until the food ran out. Calendars quit having meaning; it was either nice out or it wasn't; we either had food or we didn't, which got us to move on. Occasionally we'd find a car or some gas and would get further, but we weren't in a hurry and seemed to have all the time in the world, which we used to fuck. And hurt Priscilla. And fuck some more.
ALL THIS changed when we got to a small city. No idea which one. But we'd hit the motherlode. There was food everywhere, even if, by this time, it was mostly canned stuff that was edible, and we could stay at the best places in town. We settled first in a high-rise hotel we had to break in to, and we ran all the way up to the top floor. We stayed in a different room every night.
One night I had tied Pricilla's feet to some heavy carts and bent her over the railing into the atrium, and started fucking her ass with abandon. This went on for a bit until I noticed the delightful tightness on my cock was suddenly gone and I wondered how I had slipped out of her. It was then that I discovered that I maybe shouldn't have quit Boy Scouts when I did. The knots I had tied her ankles with gave way, and Priscilla was falling over the edge, screaming all the way down until the thud stopped the noise. I was in shock, and I still don't know what kept me from following her. I crumpled to my knees and retched, and eventually got up and followed her down, but I took the stairs.
When I got to her body, I cried until I couldn't any more. I untied her, laid her out by the dead fountain, covered her with a sheet, and left the hotel, never to return. The last man and woman on earth had become the last man on earth. Or so I thought.
I WANDERED aimlessly around town for four days, and always seemed to be in sight of the hotel. I was masturbating in a yard for only the second time since she died when I had finally resolved to burn it down and started thinking about gathering the gas I needed when the impossible happened.
And the one became two.
Priscilla was running down the road shouting my name and waving and running and crying and laughing and running and suddenly she was in my arms and we were fucking and laughing and crying and fucking and fucking and fucking . . . I'd never been so happy in my life. After I had cum thrice and I had lost count of the number of times she had, we finally fell asleep.
The next morning was just like every other morning since The End of the World; we were covered with dew, we fucked, and I slapped her tits until they were red.
Later, when I finally felt I could ask her what had happened, she proceeded to tell me about falling and then it all went dark. She woke up under a sheet, and had been looking for me for a day, and where did I go? It was then we began to notice some things. She was the same, but she didn't seem to be the same age. She appeared to be older, and curvier, and really much more beautiful, but god, was she ever hornier. I was starving, not having eaten since she died, and had to beg off to find something to eat so I could keep giving her what she wanted. Ok, I wanted it too, but I was having trouble keeping up.
Discovering Eden
IT DIDN'T take but a few days of non-stop fucking and occasional eating for us to get bored with where we were, and fell into our old ways. Travel, sex, pain, sex, food, sex, pain, sex, sleep, sex. We wandered around towns and found new places to live. Mostly, we didn't actually care where we were as we found new things to do to her, and she couldn't get enough. And yes, we did burn that hotel down, along with a dozen other buildings on that block. Can you guess that arson is an aphrodisiac? Hell, what isn't?
Fisting her pussy became a regular routine. One time, as I was getting ready to fuck her ass, she had me wait a minute as she reached over and produced some lube she'd found in the nightstand. We usually didn't bother, she liked how it hurt, but this time she said she'd thought of a surprise. She then slicked my cock up, and then poured lots of lube onto her hand. She twisted around reaching behind herself, and guided my cock to her ass. The surprise was when she proceeded to get both my cock and her own hand into her asshole, effectively giving me a hand job while fucking her ass, from the inside. I didn't last very long.
Another time we found a pharmacy with a bonus: needles. We put every single one we could find in the store into her, and her eyes shown as she screamed. As we were taking them out of her, I found that if I pulled the needle out at a different angle than the one I put it in at, it hurt more coming out than going in. It took us three days to get through them all, with all the breaks for blowjobs and pussy licking and whatever. We left the pharmacy starving and had to settle for cold canned soup.
Then one night, we saw the light. On the top of the cliffs to the west of some town we'd found. Oh my god. We hadn't seen artificial light for maybe a couple years, so it was astounding and beautiful and amazing and worth celebrating with a fuck, like we needed an occasion.
The next morning, we started up the hill. That's where the apparently rich people of this little burg had lived. The houses were fantastic, or, rather, would have been if they had power and upkeep. It was obvious they really something back in the day, but now were lacking in something. Running water would have been nice. Didn't stop us from stopping at some for a relief shag in several.
It took us two days to find it on the other side of the hill, but once we did, it should have been obvious to us sooner. This wasn't just a house, it was a castle on a huge estate. Grounds that seemed to go on forever, an airstrip, a guest house that was about three times the size of the school I used to teach at, gardens that had strawberries that we ate, just like a fairy tale. We laughed as we ran around and I chased her and I fucked her at the fountain and the whole idea that someone was here and this was theirs and they were taking care of it all slipped right by us.
We found the castle was open, and started looking around. Truly magnificent. It was clean, and there was power. We scrounged through the kitchen and found food we hadn't seen since it all began: popcorn and cold beer. And the first room we found that was perfectly appropriate to the first real food find, we fell in love with. It was a home theatre that could have seated about fifty.
And the best bonus of all: porn. We laughed at the midget porn, got all hot and bothered with most of the other straight porn, I said 'no' to the gay porn, overrode Priscilla's 'no' to the lesbian porn, and we wished we had canes and whips and clamps when we found the rough stuff. All this only served to egg us on while we gorged and got drunk and screwed all though the rest of the day and the night.
The Glock we were looking down the barrel of the next morning shouldn't have surprised us, but it did. Of course it was a trap.
Let There Be Others
"MORNING, ASSHOLE. Sleep well?"
"Uohh." I'd forgotten what a hangover felt like.
"I'm wondering how you're gonna pay for all the food and booze you used up last night. Got any money? No? Who cares---money doesn't exist anymore. What will I do. Hmm."
"Wait a minute. What? Priscilla? Whe . . ."
"Ah. A name. Ruth, take Priscilla's tits down to the kitchens, put her to work. I'm gonna get hungry soon, and I don't want to miss the show in the greenhouse. Wake up Sarah, it's her turn. Asshole here and I have things to talk about. Guy stuff. Move it, whore."
FUCK. THE girl who was apparently Ruth grabbed Priscilla by her hair and drug her out of the room, and the guy with the gun sat down, a little too close.
"I'm Rueben, and you broke into my home, stole my stuff, ate my food, and didn't have the sense to not get caught. Now what am I gonna do with you?"
"I'm . . . I'm sorry, I didn't know. We're all alone; we didn't know anybody was left. We haven't seen anybody or anything for a really . . .�
"Wait a minute, what? You don't know?"
"Know what?"
Rueben's eyes go wide. "Oh my god. Virgins."
"Uh, no. Sorry, not virgins. We've been . . .�
"Yeah yeah yeah. Shut up. You really don't know, do you. It's been what, four years, and you don't know what happened?"
"I don't know what you're talking about."
"Did I not pronounce the words 'shut up' right? Shut. The. Fuck. Up." He glared at me, then started to smile. "Hmmph. You know, this might actually be fun."
Rueben then went on to explain about the Rapture. I tried to argue a bit because I didn't believe him, and he waved the Glock and laughed at my ignorance, a lot, until Ruth knocked on the door, and said everything was ready.
"C'mon, asshole, you can watch me eat."
WE MOVED to a dining room. It was bigger than my whole house back home was. The far end joined up to a greenhouse where two naked women were standing on either side of the table. Only one wasn't standing. She was hanging, dead.
Rueben said "Ah, good. It's about time. Meet the wife."
Just then, the woman who was hanging opened her eyes and started choking. Her hands were tied behind her back, and as she struggled, she started to jerk. Her eyes were panicked.
"Hi, Sweetheart. Sarah, come here. Blow me." The other naked woman was crying as she knelt down and opened Rueben's pants and put his cock in her mouth. "That's good, baby. If you're really good, I'll let you come before you go."
Sarah started whimpering as she performed a pornstar-worthy blowjob on Rueben. After only another minute, the woman on the end of the rope stopped jerking and twitched twice, and her eyes rolled up, and she stopped moving.
"God damn it all! Why is this over so soon?" Rueben threw Sarah to the floor off of him, pulled his gun, and shot her in the head, killing her instantly with a thud. "Ruth! Ruth! Get your boney ass in here! Now!"
Ruth came running in, and fell to his feet. "Why is the Bitch dead so soon? Sarah didn't even get to finish blowing me before she died this time!"
Ruth's head was drooped. "We didn't take her down, just like you said. It'll be harder next time. If we don't take her down and let her recover some, she'll die even faster."
"Fuck! Fuck!" Rueben waves the gun around, and slams it on the table, the rage over-boiling in him until he stops to breathe, obviously struggling for control.
"All right. Take Sarah here to the kitchen, let Priscilla help with fixing her up. Then get the Bitch down, and tie her up this time. I got some time to decide what to do to her next."
"About Priscilla."
"What?" Rueben snapped.
"I think she's a pain slut." Silence. Ruth nodded slowly, looking up without lifting her chin, looking smoky. More silence.
RUEBEN SLOWLY turned his head to me, with a sneer. "Your debt is paid, asshole. She'll do just fine. What, didn't you know that either?" Then to Ruth: "Go get her. Right god damn now." Ruth fled the room.
I couldn't stop staring at the dead women, and I know my mouth was hanging open.
"How old is Priscilla?" I couldn't talk; must've had a bit of shock. "I asked you a question, asshole," he shouted as he hit me.
"Uh, we started up when she was seventeen, you said four years, uh, twenty . . . one, I think?"
"She doesn't look it, does she. Has she died?"
My eyes and my head snapped to him; wide awake now.
"Yeah. She looks different than she did before, doesn't she." I nodded, slowly. "It's the Curse, man. You're looking all shocked here, because you are the dumbest fuck. This is so god damn funny."
Rueben's School for the Gifted opened again, as he then proceeded to explain the Curse. He was half way through explaining how that now, when we die, we come back after three days, when Ruth returned with Priscilla, who was hopping in. Her hands and feet and knees were tied together, and she was gagged. It was a game we'd played before, and my mouth went dry.
"Look at her. She doesn't look twenty, does she. Because she isn't. That's the Curse. We die and come back all fixed up at our sexual peak. For women, it's about thirty. For men, it's about eighteen. And we're all ravenously horny. And we're running out of food."
As I slowly grasped what he was saying, I looked at the other women in the room. They were all about thirty, and beautiful and radiant and all looked like they would fuck anyone and anything. Even the dead ones. Rueben looked like a kid, wild. About my students' age.
"Doesn't look like it's happened to you yet. Let me help." And with that, he raised the gun to my chest and just before he fired Priscilla was screaming through her gag. The pain was unbelievable. From the few minutes I had left, I only remember a couple things, both from that bastard Rueben. The first was him holding my head up by my hair and snarling "Just what do you think I eat around here, asshole?" The last thing I remember was after he dropped me, laughing, he said, "I'm already down one blowjob this morning, bitch. Entertain me," and that Priscilla was crying as my vision closed around me.
The Second Fall
I AWOKE to a roar. Priscilla didn't mention it being noisy when she came back. I had some rather severe pains where I'd been shot, and was incredibly stiff and sore; more details glossed over by Priscilla.
Did I mention that I get airsick? Wouldn't think that would be an issue any more, but it was unmistakable: I felt like barfing my lungs out the way that only an airplane could make me do. Imagine my surprise, when I clawed my eyes open, to find myself in a small cabin that could only be one shape. I was airborne. The gag in my mouth made me have to re-swallow what I threw up, which made me have to do it again, and so round and round it went through three or four cycles. I could make out some laughter over the roar of the plane. As I tried to reach up to get the gag out of my mouth, I found that I was tied rather solidly. To celebrate, I threw up again.
Suddenly, the roar got exponentially louder, as the door to the plane was opened. I was roughly dragged up to my feet. I think I saw Ruth piloting. I could make out that Rueben was shouting at me.
"We've been trying to get you two up to see us for a month! We'll take good care of Priscilla! Bon Voyage, asshole!"
And suddenly, my fear of flying in airplanes was replaced by my fear of falling from one. Despite how hard I was tumbling and spinning and barfing, I could discern that the ground was getting closer. It only stopped that nonsense when everything went black, just as the pain set in.
I AWOKE to: no roar this time. Remarkably quiet, in fact. The pains were all in different spots, from where I assumed I had shattered bones from the fall, even though they didn't seem to be now. Splitting headache, too. As those pains subsided, it started to sink in how staggeringly hot it was. I was still tied up, but as I struggled and twisted around, I found that Rueben and his crowd dropped out of Boy Scouts, too.
I managed to battle my way to my feet; I found I had no orientation as to where I was at all. No landmarks, except the sun in the sky. As things came into focus, the horror of where they dropped me became apparent. I was in the desert. Out here, I won't have time to die from hunger.
I started dying from thirst approximately daily, only to wake up, when I assumed was 3 days later, with a strangulating sore throat and a headache. Walk for another day or so, die from thirst again, with each time becoming more unpleasant knowing what was going to happen, and wake up three days later to start over again.
Of course, for all I know, I'm not actually moving in any real direction toward anything and am just wandering in a circle, getting sunburned. I miss air-conditioning, not to mention water. It is so bloody hot, and it doesn't get any cooler no matter how much I shout and shake my fist at the sky. When there's no shade anywhere as far as the eye can see, the wisdom of traveling at night in the desert becomes a bit of a joke that I wished I had someone to share with.
I miss sunscreen. And I miss sunglasses, too. Sometimes I'd forget to close my eyes, and I'd go blind staring at the sun. And yes, it's true, dying of thirst is more terrible than dying of hunger, but not by much. That's a story for another time.
I miss Priscilla. Visions of her fill me until I have to stop to whack off, several times while I would be alive each day. Can't help that, and maybe it just hastens my daily demise; I don't know. Sometimes, my dick would end up getting sunburned, and chafed, so when I'd come back, it would hurt, too. Doesn't stop me from masturbating, though.
Fucking Curse.
