The Writer's Secret
by Ann Michelle

Chapter 1:&nbsp; "Loren's New Genre"

Loren Candeze sat on his couch reading the book he'd purchased from the internet.&nbsp; He laughed.&nbsp; His wife Stephanie, who sat on the other end of the couch reading a magazine looked up.&nbsp; She brushed her platinum tresses back over her shoulder with a wave of her hand and ran her red fingernails through the layers of her hair.

"What's so funny, Loren?"

Loren held up his electronic reader.&nbsp; "This!"

"I guessed that much, dear," she said and smiled.

He chuckled.&nbsp; "Sorry.&nbsp; It's this story I'm reading.&nbsp; Cindy called me the other day--"

"Your agent?"

"The same.&nbsp; She said her firm had done a study of what types of books people were buying these days.&nbsp; It sounds like political thrillers are dying out, so she wants me to try another genre."

Stephanie raised an eyebrow.&nbsp; "And what genre is that?"

"That's the funny thing.&nbsp; You'll never guess what's selling right now?"

She closed her magazine, slid her feet out of her wedge-heeled slippers and pulled her legs up beneath her on the couch.&nbsp; "Romance?"

Loren smiled.&nbsp; "Sort of."

"Give me a hint."

"Ok, it has to do with what you're wearing."

Stephanie furrowed her brow.&nbsp; "You've lost me, I have no idea."

"Transvestite fiction."

Stephanie looked stunned.&nbsp; "As in guys in dresses?!"

"Yep."

"Let me see if I'm hearing you right.&nbsp; Your agent Cindy, a very nice respectable woman who owns a minivan, wants you to write stories about men who dress like women?"

"Weird, huh?"

"That doesn't begin to describe it."&nbsp; Stephanie folded her arms.&nbsp; "Are you considering this?"

"Sure, why not?&nbsp; I don't care what I write, I just want to make money."

Stephanie frowned.&nbsp; "I'm not sure this is a good idea."

"Why not?"

"For one thing, what are we going to tell people at parties?&nbsp; 'Here's my husband Loren, he writes stories about men who dress like women.'&nbsp; I would die of embarrassment!"

"We don't have to tell people."

"This could ruin your reputation if it gets out."

"It won't get out.&nbsp; I'll use a fake name."

They sat silently for some time as Loren watched his wife process this information.&nbsp; She seemed opposed.

"Is the money really that good?" she asked.

"Cindy's memo says it is.&nbsp; She also says she's got a publisher lined up who is waiting for all the stories I can write, so I'm guaranteed to get this published.&nbsp; Something I've never been with my thrillers."

Stephanie smiled slyly and scrunched her nose.&nbsp; "There's not something you're not telling me here, is there?"

"Like what?"

"Like you're going through my closet when I'm at work?"

Loren laughed.&nbsp; "No.&nbsp; I've never worn women's clothes, even at Halloween."

"And you're not going to suddenly start wearing my clothes, are you?" she asked cautiously.

"No, of course not."

"This is just about money?"

"Yep."

She seemed assured.&nbsp; "I guess it's up to you, but it still doesn't sound like a great idea if anyone finds out.&nbsp; Your reputation as a macho thriller writer will be finished."

He shrugged his shoulders.&nbsp; "Like I said, I'll write under a nom de plume.&nbsp; I'll be Jessica Chambers."

"No, you're not using my last name."

"Fine, I'll think of something."

She quietly shook her head and returned to her magazine.&nbsp; Then she set her magazine down again.&nbsp; "Wait a minute.&nbsp; You always tell me, 'only write about what you know.'&nbsp; If you've never worn women's clothes before, as you claim, then how can you write about it?"

"I've never skydived before or smuggled a gun into Albania either, but that's what I wrote about in my last Louis Rock novel."

"Was he wearing panties when he did it?" she asked with a wink.

"Ha ha.&nbsp; Seriously though, I don't need to be a crossdresser to write this stuff, I just have to do research.&nbsp; I'll read some of the books to see what others are writing and I'll fake it.&nbsp; And if I need to know something about women's clothes, I'll ask you, my expert."

"What makes you think I'll help?"

"Because you're my wife and you want me to succeed.&nbsp; Because when I get rich and famous. . . or at least rich, then we can spend all our time on luxury vacations."

She cooed.&nbsp; "I do like the sound of that."

"I knew you would."

A mischievous glint appeared in her eye.&nbsp; "I'll tell you what, I will help you out."

"I knew you would."

"Tell me about this story, the one that made you laugh."

He picked up his electronic reader.&nbsp; "This?"&nbsp; He laughed and shook his head.&nbsp; "It's total garbage."

"How so?"

"Well, for starters, the characters are ridiculous.&nbsp; Listen to this:


"I was the world's most macho man until my wife got through with me.&nbsp; Now I'm a simpering sissy.&nbsp; This is the story of the horror that happened to me.&nbsp; Five years ago, I was the world's most macho man.&nbsp; My name was Mr. Brandy Highheals."


"Can you believe that?&nbsp; The writing is awful.&nbsp; There's no subtlety.&nbsp; It's repetitive.&nbsp; It's contradictory.&nbsp; On the one hand, the writer's trying to tell you the guy is some macho archetype, but his name is actually 'Brandy Highheals,' spelled with an 'ea' instead of an 'ee'?&nbsp; What kind of garbage is that?"

Stephanie smirked.&nbsp; "Can I say something?"

"Of course."

"I'm not pointing this out to criticize or anything, but your first name 'Loren' is the same as the girl's name 'Lauren,' it's just spelled differently.&nbsp; And your last name, 'Candeze' often gets transcribed on shipping labels when I order something over the phone as 'Candies,' which are a sexy little form of women's shoe.&nbsp; So while you laugh at poor Mr. Brandy Highheals, you are similarly afflicted:&nbsp; your name is pretty darn close to Lauren Candies."

Loren scowled at his wife.&nbsp; "What's your point?"

"My point is this isn't as unrealistic as you make it out to be."

"Really?!&nbsp; Ok, listen to this.&nbsp; The author goes on to describe our super-macho hero Brandy.&nbsp; He describes him as 5' 2" tall and weighing all of 109 pounds.&nbsp; He also has size six feet and shoulder length hair."

Stephanie smirked again.&nbsp; "No, I agree.&nbsp; That's not a normal male and certainly not a macho one."

"I'm glad you recognize that."

"But let me point out that not all males are hulking, muscular giants.&nbsp; In fact, you and I are about the same size."

"I am not that small," he said defensively.

"Yes you are, dear.&nbsp; If you lost 20 pounds, we could easily share a wardrobe.

And I can prove it."

"How?"

"Easy.&nbsp; Let's go see if my clothes fit you?"

"No way!"

"Don't be such a little girl about it, Loren!&nbsp; If you want to write about men who wear women's clothes, the least you can do is try some on. . . who knows, you might even like it?"&nbsp; She fought to contain a smirk.

Loren folded his arms and shook his head.

Stephanie laughed.&nbsp; "Chicken?"&nbsp; Loren looked uncomfortable.&nbsp; Stephanie knew how to push Loren's buttons and calling him a coward was the biggest button in the whole set of button.&nbsp; "Come on, dear.&nbsp; No one will know."

"You'll know."

"I'm your wife, I'm allowed to know these things.&nbsp; Think of it as research."

They sat in silence for several seconds as Loren struggled with knowing that he should take her up on this offer and yet fearing being seeing in women's clothes.&nbsp; Then it hit him, he was already learning part of what he needed to know to write these stories.&nbsp; His fear of being seen was something he could use as a basis for writing his first story.

"Ok," he finally agreed.&nbsp; "I think this could be valuable research."

Stephanie set the magazine on the coffee table and slid her feet back into her slippers.&nbsp; "That'a girl, Laura!"

To his surprise, Loren felt a tingle rush down his spine and his penis swell when his wife called him by a feminine name.&nbsp; This was going to be an interesting experience.




Chapter 2:&nbsp; "Laura Is Born"

A couple minutes later, they were in their bedroom.&nbsp; Stephanie sat at her vanity table looking through her makeup as Loren sat on the bed.&nbsp; He was naked except for a white cotton robe he'd covered himself with after Stephanie told him to strip.

"Since this is only for one night. . . I presume," she said, winking at Loren.

"Yes, one night only," he confirmed.

". . . then I won't make you shave off your body hair.&nbsp; But normally, no self-respecting woman would ever slide on hose if her legs were hairy and she certainly wouldn't allow a hairy chest.&nbsp; Of course, your chest isn't that hairy, but still."&nbsp; She flipped through a jewelry box.&nbsp; "If this were longer term, I'd also make you get your ears pierced, but there's no reason to do that just for tonight."

"Thank God for small favors."

"Don't get smart with me, young lady!" she laughed as she pulled a pair of clip-on earrings from her jewelry box.&nbsp; She turned to Loren.&nbsp; "Ok, I'm ready."

"Can't wait," he said sarcastically.

"Now you're sure you've never dressed up before?"

"Never."

"Not even a pair of panties?"

Loren rolled his eyes.&nbsp; "Not even."

"Ok, then let's start with the basics."&nbsp; She handed him a pair of pink cotton panties.&nbsp; They weren't particularly ornate as they had no lace, no bows, and no ribbons.&nbsp; Indeed, they weren't designed to be anything but functional.&nbsp; But they were panties, and they were pink, and Loren felt extremely funny holding them.&nbsp; For a moment, he didn't know if he could slide them on or not.&nbsp; Part of him wanted to, but part of him felt sheer terror.

Loren took a deep breath, shifted uncomfortably, and then slowly raised his right leg to slide his foot into the panties. 

"'atta girl!" Stephanie said and patted her husband on the head.&nbsp; She pushed his arm away to get a clear view of his penis.&nbsp; "Yep, still there. . . and excited too!"

"I didn't think it was going to fall off," he said.

"You sure acted like you did," she countered.&nbsp; "Care to explain the excitement?"

Loren shot her an annoyed look but didn't speak.&nbsp; Instead, he stepped his left leg into the panties and pulled them us his legs.&nbsp; As he did, Stephanie went to her underwear drawer, where she retrieved a pair of tan pantyhose.&nbsp; Next, she grabbed a floral housedress from the closet.&nbsp; The dress was off-white in color with a red, black and green flower pattern, a square collar which exposed several inches of shoulder blade and a loose hem which stopped just below the knees.&nbsp; Stephanie laid the housedress on the bed next to Loren.

"You want me to wear that?" he asked apprehensively.

"Unless you want to walk around with your thingy sticking out," she said condescendingly and she returned to her vanity table.&nbsp; She picked up a pink lipstick.&nbsp; "Pucker up, dear."&nbsp; Loren did as she asked and she painted his lips.&nbsp; Next, she clipped the earrings onto his ears.&nbsp; They were one inch long silver drops.&nbsp; They felt very heavy to Loren as they tugged on his earlobes.

"None of this is permanent, right?"

"Sure it is, dear.&nbsp; It'll never come off.&nbsp; That's why women have to reapply it each day," she said sarcastically as she applied eye shadow to his eyes and blush to his cheeks.&nbsp; "Don't be such a baby."&nbsp; Next she grabbed a pink bra from the vanity.&nbsp; It matched the panties.&nbsp; "This is a big moment dear, your first bra!"&nbsp; She giggled as she attached it behind his back and showed him how to bring the straps up over his arms.&nbsp; She stood back and looked at her work.&nbsp; "Hmm.&nbsp; Something's missing."&nbsp; She snapped her fingers.&nbsp; "I know!"&nbsp; She walked over to her underwear drawer and grabbed a handful of panties.&nbsp; She folded these and padded the bra with them until Loren had small, budding breasts.

"Aren't these a little. . . uh, large?"

"No, not for a girl.&nbsp; They're barely an A-cup, if that."

"They look way bigger."

"Mine are C's, and you think those are too small."

"No I don't, honey!&nbsp; Your breasts are great!"&nbsp; He moved to kiss her, but she stopped him.

"Don't smear the lipstick, dear."

"Spoilsport," he said.

She grinned at him and handed him the pantyhose.&nbsp; "To put these on, roll them up until you can put your toe straight into the end.&nbsp; Then pull them up your leg to your knee.&nbsp; Slide in the other foot.&nbsp; Then pull the whole thing up to your waist."

As he pulled the pantyhose up his legs, Stephanie couldn't help but notice his erection, which had escaped the panties, bouncing up and down in his lap.&nbsp; He was excited, even if he refused to admit it.&nbsp; She was getting a real kick out of this herself, much more than she expected when she maneuvered Loren into agreeing to let her dress him up.

"So what happened next to Brandy?&nbsp; Tell me about the wife?"

Loren struggled to pull the pantyhose up over his erection.&nbsp; "Oh, she's a frustrated Amazon.&nbsp; She's five-nine--"

"Seven inches taller than her macho husband, huh?" Stephanie scoffed.&nbsp; She and Loren were the same height, but in her heels she was often a good deal taller than him, something she liked to rub in now and then because she knew it bothered him.

"Yeah.&nbsp; But she's got insane measurements.&nbsp; She's 105 pounds and has double 'D' breasts, which Brandy keeps wishing were bigger."

"Clearly, he knows nothing about breasts.&nbsp; What do we know about her?"&nbsp; She picked up the reader.&nbsp; "Oh, this is good."&nbsp; She read:


"Before she became my wife, Candi was my high school sweetheart.&nbsp; When I single-handedly won the state championship as quarterback and captain of our football team, she was the head cheerleader cheering me on.&nbsp; So were the other cheerleaders too, if you get my drift.&nbsp; She cheered me on too when I single-handedly scored 45 unanswered points to win the state basketball tournament.&nbsp; I was the captain of that team too."


Stephanie laughed.&nbsp; "That's pathetic."&nbsp; She kept skimming the story.&nbsp; "Looks like she's big on miniskirts and tight tops.&nbsp; Wow, she wears five-inch heels to lounge around the house!"

Loren smiled at his wife.&nbsp; "If I have to play Mr. Brandy tonight, then you should play Ms. Candi."

"Me?!"

"Yes, you."

"No can do, girly, I don't have any heels higher than four inches and I only wear those on special occasions."

"This is a special occasion, go strap 'em on!"

Stephanie rolled her eyes, but went to her closet.&nbsp; She was enjoying this too much to stop just yet.&nbsp; She removed her robe and slid a tight white mini-dress over her shoulders, smoothing it down her hips and thighs.&nbsp; Then she slipped her feet into her kidskin, four-inch high-heeled, open-toed, slingback pumps.&nbsp; The red polish on her toenails showed through the tan stocking she still wore from work.&nbsp; "I hope you appreciate this," she said as she returned to her vanity.&nbsp; She looked at Loren's intense erection beneath his pantyhose and giggled.&nbsp; "Yeah, you're appreciating this all right!"

Loren covered his erection with the housedress, which he now unzipped so he could slide it over his head.

"So how does poor Brandy end up getting all gussied up?" she asked.

"I have no idea, I hadn't gotten that far."&nbsp; He was having problems working the tiny zipper.

Stephanie picked up the reader and skimmed the story.&nbsp; "Hmm.&nbsp; He actually does it to himself."

"He was a crossdresser the whole time?"

"No, he claims this was the first time.&nbsp; He gets all upset at his wife, goes into a diatribe about how men are men and women are gross and that he's not a sissy.&nbsp; Then he storms off to the bedroom where he sees her panties.&nbsp; For reasons he can't explain, he slides those on.&nbsp; They feel so good he tries on a blouse and then a pair of her six-inch heels."&nbsp; She shook her head.&nbsp; "Six-inch heels?&nbsp; This is ridiculous!"

"I told you.&nbsp; Is that when she catches him?"

She kept reading.&nbsp; "Nope. . . oh goodie!"&nbsp; She looked at her husband and smiled.&nbsp; "Since we're re-enacting this book, I get to catch you jerking off with my panties!"

He furrowed his brow.&nbsp; "Uh, no."

"Come on dear, you're hard enough.&nbsp; In fact, you're so hard I'd be afraid your little guy might explode if you don't relieve the pressure.&nbsp; Why don't you give it a couple tugs?&nbsp; I won't tell anyone."&nbsp; She smiled mischievously and he didn't know if she was serious or not.

"I'll pass."

"Your loss.&nbsp; Why don't you finish getting dressed."

Loren slid the floral housedress over his head and stood up so Stephanie could zip him up.&nbsp; His penis stood at attention, even though it was beneath the pantyhose.&nbsp; This caused the dress to tent out.

In her heels, Stephanie stood four inches taller than her husband, so she looked down over his shoulder at his erection.&nbsp; She chuckled.&nbsp; Then she looked at their height difference and chuckled again.&nbsp; "We need to get you some shoes, shorty."

Loren felt his erection pulse.&nbsp; It always humiliated him whenever she reminded him how short he was because he felt it was unmanly to be smaller than his wife.&nbsp; Tonight, however, the humiliation came with a new sensation: excitement.&nbsp; In fact, the excitement was so strong that for a brief moment he wanted her to say it again.&nbsp; This shocked him.&nbsp; Why did he want his wife to humiliate him?&nbsp; Where had this come from?&nbsp; He wasn't sure.

Meanwhile, Stephanie walked over to her closet.&nbsp; In her four-inch slingbacks, her hips rolled sexily from side to side as she walked, which excited Loren tremendously.&nbsp; As she bent down and picked up a pair of shoes he wanted so badly to go over and rub her body.&nbsp; But he stayed put.

Stephanie rose and held the shoes up for Loren to see.&nbsp; They were tan, patent leather pumps with a small open toe.&nbsp; They had two-inch heels.&nbsp; "I think these are good starter heels for you.&nbsp; They're pumps, not sandals, so they give a lot of support.&nbsp; Also they have a real heel, so you can experience walking in heels, but they're low enough you should be able to master them pretty quickly."

"Heels, huh?"

"Yep.&nbsp; A girl's best friend.&nbsp; And best of all, you'll still be shorter than I am," she said happily.&nbsp; "I like my sissies short!"

There was the excitement again.&nbsp; As she said this, his penis pulsed in the panties.&nbsp; It felt like it could explode at any second.&nbsp; This confused him.&nbsp; Part of him wanted to tell his wife to stop making fun of him and to stop treating him like her own personal toy, but another part craved the electric shock her words gave him.&nbsp; It surprised him to realize he actually seemed to wanted her to humiliate him.&nbsp; He didn't know how to handle this.

Loren took the heels and sat down to slip them onto his feet as his wife stood next to him.&nbsp; "How hard can this be?" he asked rhetorically.&nbsp; He found out when he stood up.&nbsp; It took him a moment to gain his balance, though everything seemed ok.&nbsp; But then he took his first step and nearly fell down.

"Seeeexy!" said his wife and she whistled.

He looked away from her.&nbsp; "Do you mind, this is hard enough as it is."

She reached out and patted his penis through the floral dress.&nbsp; "So it is," she purred.

"Stop that!"&nbsp; He pushed her hand away and she giggled.

She folded her arms.&nbsp; "Look dear, it's simple."&nbsp; She put one hand on Loren's stomach.&nbsp; "Stomach in."&nbsp; Then she put the other hand on his back.&nbsp; "Chest out."&nbsp; She lifted his chin with her thumb.&nbsp; "Head up.&nbsp; Don't look down."

"How can I see where I'm going?"

"You can't, you have to plan ahead.&nbsp; Now, when you start off, you need to keep your feet together.&nbsp; Pretend you're walking on a tightrope.&nbsp; Take little sissy steps.&nbsp; And when you step, point your toe, but bring your heel down first.&nbsp; Let the sole of your shoe follow quickly and smoothly.&nbsp; Then make sure your foot is firmly planted before you lift your other foot.&nbsp; Balancing on a thin heel takes some practice."&nbsp; She demonstrated with her own heels.

Loren took a deep breath.&nbsp; "I can do this."&nbsp; His first step was graceful.&nbsp; His next two weren't.

"Whoa!" she said.&nbsp; "Do what you did with the first step, just do it slower.&nbsp; Now swing your arms as you walk, like this."&nbsp; She demonstrated how he should move his arms.

He tried and almost fell over.&nbsp; She caught him on the way down and supported him.&nbsp; "Come on Laura, teenage girls the world over master this.&nbsp; Are you telling me you can't do something every single teenage girl on the planet can do?"

Loren stood up straight again.&nbsp; He took several steps, but was too stiff.

"Roll with your hips, but keep your legs straight, close and parallel.&nbsp; Move from your hips."&nbsp; He did this and his gate improved.&nbsp; "Good girl!&nbsp; Now keep your arms moving with your body.&nbsp; Good.&nbsp; We'll make a girl out of you yet!"

Stephanie had him repeat this until she was sure he had the technique right.&nbsp; He was still slow, but he could pick up the pace with practice.&nbsp; He was on the right track, and interestingly, the whole time his erection stood at attention beneath the dress.&nbsp; Finally, Stephanie told him to stop.&nbsp; "I think she's got it!&nbsp; And since you don't want to let me catch you playing with yourself, why don't we go to the living room," she said.

Loren bit his lip.

"What's up dear?" she asked, though she suspected the answer.&nbsp; He was so horny at this point she could have made him ejaculate without even touching him.&nbsp; She suspected he wouldn't mind a little release.

"Nothing," he said sheepishly.

She laughed.&nbsp; "Are you sure it's nothing, dear?"

"It's nothing."

"Because I thought maybe my high-heeled husband wanted me to pretend to catch him jerking himself off.&nbsp; But we know you don't want that, because that would make you a sissy, right dear?" she said in an exaggerated way.

"It's nothing," he repeated.

"That's good because I'd hate to think my little husband was enjoying being a sissy," she said with a smirk.&nbsp; She saw his erection flinch.&nbsp; "Of course, if that's really what you want. . ."

"Personally, I don't see the point," he said.&nbsp; "Maybe as research or something like that, but I have no desire to do that."

"Good, then let's go to the kitchen," she said firmly.

He didn't move.&nbsp; He looked conflicted and his face turned red.

"Or did you want to play with yourself?" she asked bluntly.&nbsp; Loren looked conflicted and terrified, and that's when Stephanie truly realized how much of a kick she was getting out of this.&nbsp; "It's ok if you do.&nbsp; Do you want to?"&nbsp; A malicious smile crossed her face and it wasn't clear if she was making fun of him now or making a genuine offer.

Loren didn't speak but his face turned bright red.

"Come on, speak up.&nbsp; It's obvious you want to masturbate.&nbsp; Do you need me to pretend to catch you or would you rather I just sat here and watched?" she said with a laugh which made Loren suddenly feel very small.

"No!" Loren protested, though they both knew this wasn't true.

"Don't be shy dear, I'm having a great time learning about the real you!" she said slyly.

"Look--"

Stephanie raised her hand to cut him off and smiled condescendingly.&nbsp; "I'll tell you what.&nbsp; I'll go to the kitchen and pour myself a drink.&nbsp; You do whatever you want in here and don't mind me."&nbsp; She patted him on the back and walked out of the bedroom, closing the door.&nbsp; "It's none of my business if my husband wants to play with himself."

Loren listened carefully as Stephanie walked down the hallway.&nbsp; If he was fast enough, he could relieve himself before she could return and then he could deny having done it. . . although the idea of getting caught actually appealed to him, even though part of him screamed that this was a bad idea.

When he heard Stephanie's heels echo off the tile floor in the kitchen floor, he lost no time hiking up his dress and climbing onto the bed.&nbsp; He didn't even bother taking anything off, including the heels, which made maneuvering on the bed difficult and kept him from getting traction.&nbsp; Despite the restrictive clothing and lack of traction, he pushed himself toward the head of the bed, against the pillows, and worked his hand under the pantyhose and panties.&nbsp; He squeezed his engorged member.&nbsp; He hadn't been this hard in years.&nbsp; It had to be this whole experience, but why?&nbsp; He thought briefly about Stephanie and all the little humiliations she had visited on him tonight.&nbsp; This inexplicably thrilled him, but it also screamed "danger!"&nbsp; And despite his better judgment, part of him actually hoped Stephanie would burst into the room and add even more excitement to the night.&nbsp; Indeed, the very thought caused his penis to pulse all on its own.

He began stroking himself furiously, desperate to get some release.&nbsp; But after only three strokes, the door suddenly flew up.&nbsp; Stephanie had removed her heels and crept silently down the hallway back to the bedroom.&nbsp; In her hand was a video camera she sometimes used for work.&nbsp; She burst out laughing.

"Oh my God!&nbsp; Look at my sissy husband?&nbsp; Loren!&nbsp; You're wearing my clothes?!&nbsp; Oh my God!&nbsp; How long has this been going on?&nbsp; Oh my God!&nbsp; You're jerking off!"

Loren's heart stopped.&nbsp; He panicked.&nbsp; Even the part of him that hoped she would return had not expected this.&nbsp; He thought she would calmly walk in, act surprised in a seductive way, and they would make love.&nbsp; He never expected her to act so aggressively or to carry a video camera!

Stephanie rushed to his side of the bed and filmed him up and down as he scrambled to pull his hand from his panties and tried to grab something to cover himself.&nbsp; There was nothing.&nbsp; His heels slipped all over the bed, making him feel like a turtle unable to right itself.

"How long have you been wearing my clothes, Laura?!" she demanded.

"Stephanie!&nbsp; What are you doing?" he gasped as he struggled to get off the bed.

"Don't dodge the question, girly!"

He reached for the camera, but she backed away out of reach.&nbsp; "Put down that camera!"

"You were lying on our bed, wearing my dress and my high heels, masturbating!&nbsp; What is wrong with you, sissy?!"

Loren looked confused.&nbsp; Was she serious?&nbsp; "Please stop filming this?!"&nbsp; He rolled off the bed to the floor.&nbsp; She moved in closer.

"I'm going to show this to all our friends so they can see what kind of sissy I married!"

"Stop kidding around!" he bleated as he pulled the heels from his feet.

"I'm not kidding, Laura!"

"Seriously Steph, stop."

"Why Laura?!&nbsp; I'm the one with the power now.&nbsp; You're going to do whatever I say from now on, or I'll show this tape to everyone!"

"That's not funny," he said and he finally stood up.&nbsp; His clothes were a mess.&nbsp; His bra had twisted to one side, his pantyhose slid below his hips, and the skirt of his dress was folded up and caught in his panties, leaving his erection standing free.&nbsp; His makeup was smeared.

"It's not meant to be funny.&nbsp; If you want to be a sissy, then I'm taking over!"

"I don't want to be a sissy--"

"You could have fooled me."

Loren made a sour expression.&nbsp; "Oh, come on!"

"Did I or did I not find you dressed like a woman jerking yourself off?"&nbsp; She was still filming this.

"Yeah, but you know why I was doing that?"&nbsp; Suddenly, Loren saw a smile in the corner of Stephanie's mouth.&nbsp; He felt instant relief.&nbsp; "Ok, the jokes over."

She laughed.&nbsp; "I got you good.&nbsp; You should have seen your face!&nbsp; You looked so scared!"

Loren finally caught his breath.&nbsp; "You nearly gave me a heart attack."

"Well, you wanted to know what it would be like!&nbsp; Now you know."

Loren shook his head.

"Anyway, get dressed," she said, pointing at his penis, which flopped around outside the pantyhose, and the high-heeled shoe lying on the floor.

"Aren't we done for the night?" he asked.

"Hardly.&nbsp; We're only a few pages into the book."

"Oh, come on," he said.

She shook her head.&nbsp; "Don't talk back to me girlfriend.&nbsp; We're doing your nails next."

Loren rolled his eyes.

"And don't roll your eyes at me, missy!&nbsp; Now get dressed so we can go to the living room."

"But--"

"You can jerk off later, I'll even watch if that's what you need to get it up.&nbsp; But right now I want to do your nails. . . and with this tape," she tapped the camera, "I get what I want from now on."

Once again, Loren felt a mixture of humiliation and pleasure.&nbsp; He liked it.











The Writer's Secret (Chapters 3-4)

Chapter 3: "The Education of Laura"

As they settled on the couch, Stephanie slipped her feet out of her slingbacks and pulled her legs up underneath her.&nbsp; Loren sat uncomfortably on the other end of the couch with his legs spread wide apart.&nbsp; Stephanie corrected him and he held his legs together.&nbsp; She was shaking a vial of nail polish. . . bright red.

"So what happens next in the story?" he asked.

"Candi catches Brandy.&nbsp; Brandy is so emasculated at being caught by his wife that he immediately falls to pieces and agrees to be her total slave.&nbsp; He keeps saying, 'I would be ruined if she told everyone.'"

"Makes sense."

Stephanie rolled her eyes and chucked.&nbsp; "Men!"

"What?"

"You act like your dicks are going to fall off if you're seen doing the slightest feminine thing!"

"It's nothing personally, it's all about reputation."

She folded her arms.&nbsp; "Really?" she said doubtfully.

"Yeah.&nbsp; Personally, it doesn't bother me at all.&nbsp; But if everyone knew you dressed like a woman, then no one would respect you ever again."

"So all I have to do is tell people and you're ruined, is that it?"

"Yeah."

"Then sister, you better be good to me because I now have the power to ruin you!"&nbsp; She laughed.

"That only works if people believe you," he countered.

"I have video proof."

"What?!"

"You heard me.&nbsp; I filmed the whole thing, and if that's the way you boys think, then you better think twice before you upset me next time!"

Loren couldn't tell if she was joking or not, and that worried him.&nbsp; She could often tell a joke with a very straight face.&nbsp; "Are you serious?" he asked sheepishly, hoping she would hear the pleading in his voice and tell him this was a joke.

She smiled at him, but gave no hint whether she was joking or not.&nbsp; Instead, she tossed him the nail polish and ordered him to begin.&nbsp; This is when it really hit Loren what he'd done.&nbsp; Joking or not, he'd given his wife the perfect blackmail material.&nbsp; And while they did have a good relationship, she was the type to exploit an advantage when it suited her.&nbsp; He made a mental note to delete the footage before he went to bed.

As he opened the nail polish, Stephanie kept reading the story.&nbsp; She was becoming fascinated by it.&nbsp; "Interesting.&nbsp; She wants to put him under her control, but doesn't want people to know.&nbsp; So she makes him wear panties and stockings under his clothes and she makes him shave his body and paint his toenails."&nbsp; She looked at Loren and smiled.&nbsp; "We could do that!"

"What do you mean?"

"I mean, we're having the dinner party on Saturday.&nbsp; You could wear girly clothes underneath and no one would know except you and me!"

He looked up at his wife's smiling face.&nbsp; "No way!"

She folded her arms.&nbsp; "You just told me you don't have any problems with this personally, that all you worry about it your reputation.&nbsp; How is your reputation going to get hurt if only you and I know?"

Loren swallowed hard.&nbsp; "What if someone realizes?"

"Why would someone realize?&nbsp; When we go to Kathleen and Peter's house, do you check his toenails to make sure they aren't painted?"

"No."

"And he won't do that to you."

"But--"

"No, but.&nbsp; You're being a hypocrite.&nbsp; Either prove to me that you're a man and do exactly what I say and let me have some fun at this party, or admit that you're a scared little boy whose masculinity is so tenuous that you're afraid that wearing a few girly clothes will forever emasculate you."

"It seems too risky."

"Don't be a sissy, dear."

Loren's face burned.&nbsp; He hate it when his wife challenged his manhood, though perversely, her challenge this time was to abandon that same manhood.

"Honey, I could make you do this--"

"How?" he demanded, interrupting her.

"Need I remind you I have a tape of you jerking yourself off in my clothes?"

"That doesn't mean anything!" he said dismissively.

"Oh, then you won't mind if I show it to Kathleen and Peter?"

"You wouldn't!" he gasped.

"Loren, I'm going to do you a favor because that's the kind of wife I am.&nbsp; I think you want to do this.&nbsp; I think you're enjoying this too much to stop and you're getting a real kick out of the idea of pushing the envelop--"

"What makes you think that?"&nbsp; He folded his arms defiantly.

"Duh!"&nbsp; She waved her hand up and down his body, stopping at the erection which pushed his dress away from his body.&nbsp; "As I said, you're enjoying this, we both know that.&nbsp; And I'm getting a kick out of it to.&nbsp; So I'm going to make you play along at the party because I think you want to do it, but are afraid to ask."

Loren rubbed his tongue over his teeth and pulled his arms tighter.

Stephanie smiled.&nbsp; "Come on, dear.&nbsp; It'll be fun.&nbsp; Think of how great it will be for us to share this secret that no one else knows anything about.&nbsp; Think of how exciting it will be to do this right under their noses!&nbsp; Think of how hard that will make you?&nbsp; I'll even give you a reward after our guests leave."

Loren didn't know what to say.&nbsp; Deep down, he secretly thrilled to the idea.&nbsp; He envisioned Stephanie rubbing his penis under the table with her foot as he wore bright red toenail polish and panties, and no one around him having a clue.&nbsp; That excited him.&nbsp; But what if they caught him?&nbsp; The odds were low, but it could happen.&nbsp; That could ruin him.&nbsp; Also, he was starting to regret this whole affair as he feared Stephanie would not stop with just the dinner party.&nbsp; He knew her enough to know that she would keep pushing this well past the point he wanted to take it, and as long as she had that videotape, she could keep pushing him.&nbsp; So until he could destroy that videotape, he had no choice, right?&nbsp; Plus, he told himself, it might be fun.&nbsp; And what harm could there be in having a little fun playing along with her dinner party joke.&nbsp; Loren agreed.

"This is going to be so much fun!" Stephanie squealed.



Chapter 4: "Walk Before You Mince"

Loren emerged from the shower.&nbsp; He was hairless except for the hair on his head.&nbsp; He felt strange.&nbsp; His legs and arms looked smaller somehow.&nbsp; His chest looked flabbier.&nbsp; His penis looked. . . less significant.&nbsp; He almost couldn't bring himself to return to the bedroom, where Stephanie awaited him, especially with his continuing erection.&nbsp; There was just no denying that it turned him on to let Stephanie feminize him.&nbsp; He wrapped himself in the towel and stepped out of the bathroom.

Stephanie whistled.

He looked away from her.&nbsp; "Do you mind, this is hard enough already."

She rubbed his penis through the towel.&nbsp; "Very hard."

He pushed her hand away.

"Ok, scaredy," she said and made an exaggerated frown.&nbsp; She pointed to her vanity table.&nbsp; "Sit, girl."

He glared at her.&nbsp; "Can you please stop doing that?"

"Doing what?"

"Treating me like I'm a girl."

"But you are a girl, honey.&nbsp; Or at least, you are until the party, that was our agreement, and that means I get to treat you like a girl and you can't get upset by it."

That was their agreement.&nbsp; He would learn everything there was about being a girl for the next few days, then he would let her dress him up secretly as a girl beneath his male clothes for the party.&nbsp; She could have whatever fun she wanted, so long as it didn't lead to exposure, and he would do whatever she demanded.&nbsp; Indeed, he agreed to place himself entirely under her control.&nbsp; He agreed to that partly because Stephanie demanded total control, under threat of releasing the video, but it also made it easier on his ego to tell himself that none of this was his choice.&nbsp; Plus, if truth be told, he liked the idea of her teasing him for the next few days.&nbsp; Indeed, it turned him on something fierce to have her treat him like a girl.&nbsp; Every time she called him "girl" or "girlfriend" or "Laura," his penis throbbed and nearly exploded.

Loren grumbled under his breath, but "reluctantly" nodded his assent to being treated like a girl.

Stephanie tossed him a fresh pair of pink cotton panties with a delicate lace bow on the waistband.&nbsp; She sat on the bed and slowly shook her leg.&nbsp; Loren stretched the panties with his hands.&nbsp; His frowned and started toward the bathroom.

"And where do you think you're going, girlfriend?!"

"To put these on."

"Uh, no.&nbsp; You change right here in front of me like a good girl."

Loren swallowed hard.&nbsp; He didn't want his wife seeing his shrunken penis, even if it was so hard right now that it could crush stone.&nbsp; But, he told himself, he had no choice, so he took a deep breath and dropped his towel.

Stephanie whistled again.&nbsp; "Look at that, hard as a rock!&nbsp; Somebody likes being a girl, don't they!"&nbsp; Suddenly she cocked an eyebrow, walked over to Loren and bent partially over to look at his penis.&nbsp; "Huh, it looks smaller without hair."

Loren rolled his eyes.&nbsp; "Gee, thanks, honey."

She giggled.&nbsp; "I'm sorry, Loren, but it's true.&nbsp; It's kinda tiny without hair."

"Stephanie!"

She shook her head and laughed.&nbsp; "Men!&nbsp; Fine, it's the biggest thing I've ever seen.&nbsp; Now put on the panties and sit down."

He did as instructed.

Stephanie picked up tweezers from the vanity and began cleaning up his eyebrows.&nbsp; He initially complained about the pain, but she put a stop to that:&nbsp; "Girls go through this all the time, so stop complaining."&nbsp; Then she grabbed red nail polish and set to work on his nails.&nbsp; "You'll love doing your nails once you learn how, it's really relaxing."&nbsp; When she finished, she taught him how to hold his hands so his nails would dry.&nbsp; In the meantime, she set about applying makeup to his face again.&nbsp; She explained each item as she went along.

"Do I really need to know this?" Loren asked.

"Yes.&nbsp; You need to learn to do this yourself so you can do touchups throughout the day."

Loren shivered at the thought of applying makeup himself.

By the time Stephanie finished applying his makeup, his nails had dried.&nbsp; It was time to get dressed.&nbsp; To that end, Stephanie gave Loren the same floral housedress he had worn earlier and a pair of red high-heeled sandals.&nbsp; His feet were slightly larger than hers, but not by much so they could share shoes for now, though they would be uncomfortable.

"Hey, I can't wear these!&nbsp; Look at the heels on these things, I'll break my neck!"

"Don't be such a crybaby.&nbsp; These aren't even that high &#8211; they're not quite three inches.&nbsp; I wear higher than that all the time."

"That might not be high for you--"

"You'll get used to them.&nbsp; You just need practice."

"If you say so," he said skeptically.

She ignored him.&nbsp; "When you get comfortable with these, then we'll get you some higher heels."

"Higher?!"

"These days, a girl has to wear four-inch heels if she wants to look good around the office," she said as she rolled up the pantyhose in her hands.

"Why do I need to wear heels at all?"

"Heels are a girl's best friend.&nbsp; They make you taller and thinner.&nbsp; They bring out the feminine curves in your legs and your butt and they give you sexy posture."

"I don't want sexy posture."

She ignored him and showed him again how to put on the pantyhose.&nbsp; "When you slide on hose, roll up each leg like I just did.&nbsp; Then hold them out and stick your foot into the roll like this."&nbsp; She demonstrated with her own leg, having kicked off her shoe.

"I remember."

"Good, then get with it."

Loren pulled the hose up over his panties to his waist.&nbsp; They were tight and they pinned his penis tightly against his body, an uncomfortable feeling.&nbsp; He felt pre-cum dripping out its top.

"Now sit down and we'll strap you into the heels."&nbsp; She gave his penis a little squeeze through the pantyhose as she said this, causing him to moan.

--0--
A few moments later, they were in their living room.&nbsp; Loren wore the housedress, the three-inch red high-heeled sandals, and lots of makeup.&nbsp; Stephanie had changed into a plum-colored sheath dress and a pair of silver three-inch high-heeled sandals so she could demonstrate the art of walking in heels to her husband.

"Here we have an obstacle course," she said waving her hand around the room.&nbsp; "To the right, we have twenty or so feet of carpet.&nbsp; That's where we'll start teaching you to walk."

"I know how to walk," he said.

"Not in heels you don't, unless there's something you never told me?"&nbsp; She winked at him.

"You already showed me," he replied dryly.

"That was just the intro.&nbsp; And you weren't very good at it," she said, playing on his competitive nature.&nbsp; "This is the real deal.&nbsp; When you get comfortable on the carpet, then we'll move to the hardwood floors in the hallways.&nbsp; That's a very different experience in heels because the wood is much slicker.&nbsp; When you've mastered that, then we'll move to our third obstacle:&nbsp; the stairs.&nbsp; Stairs are a different world entirely.&nbsp; Think you're up to it?"

Loren smirked at his wife.&nbsp; "This'll be a breeze," he said confidently.

Stephanie raised an eyebrow.&nbsp; "You think so?"

"Yeah, no problem."

"Ok, girly.&nbsp; Then we can make a bet."

"What bet?"

"Since it's SO easy, you should be able to master the entire course within twenty minutes."

He folded his arms, almost losing his balance in the process.&nbsp; "What terms?"

"You need your own shoes because mine are just a little too small.&nbsp; If you succeed, then I'll buy you some low-heeled shoes and flats tomorrow and you can wear those.&nbsp; But if you fail, then you let me pick whatever shoes I want for you and you'll wear them without complaint."

"Twenty minutes?"

"Twenty minutes."

Loren thought about this for a second.&nbsp; Twenty minutes wasn't a lot of time.&nbsp; But then, he was only learning to walk in heels, how hard could it be?&nbsp; And winning would be a good thing because his limited experience in heels was already proving to be uncomfortable, so getting out of them would be a big help.&nbsp; "Deal."

"Great," she said with a sly smile.&nbsp; "I'll just sit down over here on the couch, while you show me how easy it is.&nbsp; Strut for me, girly."

Loren took his first step.&nbsp; It was less than graceful.&nbsp; Then he took his second, his third, and then his fourth.&nbsp; On his fourth, his ankle twisted and he nearly fell.&nbsp; A couple more awkward steps and he made it across the room.

She shook her head slowly.&nbsp; "You know how in films they always dress up some muscle man as a woman and he stumbles all over the place in this big exaggerated way to make the audience laugh?&nbsp; That was you, chicky."

Loren gritted his teeth and stormed across the room.&nbsp; "There!"

"Not bad. . . for a soldier marching in drag."

Loren folded his arms and glared at his wife.&nbsp; "Are you going to help me or just sit there complaining?"

Stephanie stood up and gracefully walked over to Loren.&nbsp; "See that?&nbsp; Do what I did:&nbsp; stomach in, chest out, chin up, keep your feet together like you're on a tightrope.&nbsp; And remember, small steps."

"How small?"

"Think about making an itsy bitsy small step and then make it smaller."&nbsp; She pushed his stomach in again and his shoulders out.&nbsp; "Maintain your posture.&nbsp; When you step, you can't march.&nbsp; Don't take these big rolling steps.&nbsp; Point your toe, but bring your heel down first then your toes follow quickly and smoothly.&nbsp; And make sure your foot is firmly planted before you lift your other foot."

Loren took a deep breath.&nbsp; "I can do this."

"Give it a shot."&nbsp; She kissed his cheek.

His first step was graceful.&nbsp; So was his second.&nbsp; His next two weren't, though they were better than before.

"Do what you did with the first step, just do it in slow motion."

He did.

"Good!&nbsp; Now swing your arms as you walk, like this."&nbsp; She demonstrated how he should move his arms.&nbsp; "Also, roll with your hips, but keep your legs straight, close and parallel."

He added that too.

"Good, now keep your arms moving with your body and walk a little faster."

He did, and like that, he learned to walk in a straight line little by little.&nbsp; And as he learned the technique, his pace picked up.&nbsp; Soon he was walking quite well.&nbsp; He would need practice at letting his natural balance take over before he walked in a truly feminine gate, but he showed promise.

Stephanie stopped him.&nbsp; "Ok, now we need to work on turning corners and turning around.&nbsp; Bring your feet together like this," she said, demonstrated with her own feet.&nbsp; "Stand on the balls of your feet and pivot."

Loren mimicked her.

"Excellent!&nbsp; Now walk to the end of the room, pivot, and come back to me."&nbsp; He did as instructed several times.&nbsp; He needed practice in this too, but he was getting there.&nbsp; "Let's move to the hallway."

The moment Loren set foot in the hallway, he felt a sudden shiver through his spine.&nbsp; His heel. . . yes, his high heel echoed off the hardwood floor.&nbsp; His penis began throbbing.&nbsp; He decided not to mention this.

Stephanie walked ahead of him in the hallway showing him how to walk.&nbsp; "The key with slick floors like hardwood or tile or marble is to use the balls of your feet.&nbsp; Don't bring your heel down first, bring your sole down first.&nbsp; Essentially, you'll tiptoe across slick surfaces.&nbsp; Give it a try."

Loren took several steps.&nbsp; They weren't pretty.&nbsp; He walked like he was lampooning a ballerina and the whole effect was very sissy-like.&nbsp; Stephanie folded her arms and tapped her foot against the floor.

"You look like a sissy.&nbsp; Don't leave your heels up in the air, bring those down.&nbsp; Just keep the weight on the front of your feet."

"This is harder than it looks."

Stephanie let out a laugh and rolled her eyes.&nbsp; "I thought this was going to be SO easy?!"

"I'll get there, it's just harder than it looks," he said with some annoyance.

"Keep trying," she told him.

After several minutes of practice, he showed significant improvement.&nbsp; Stephanie was at least sure he wouldn't fall and hurt himself.&nbsp; Grace would come with practice and she intended to make sure he had plenty of practice.&nbsp; Finally, it was time to move to the stairs.

"Stairs are tricky because you have to take your time.&nbsp; That can be a real problem when you're walking with someone."&nbsp; She placed her hands on each side of his waist and moved him to the base of the stairs.&nbsp; "Up is easy.&nbsp; Lift your foot onto the step, just make sure your entire foot lands on the stair at once.&nbsp; Don't let the heel hit first or the sole.&nbsp; When your foot is firmly planted, place your weight on that foot and lift yourself off the lower stair."

He did as he was told.

"There!&nbsp; That wasn't so difficult, was it?&nbsp; But next time, move your second leg up another stair rather than just bringing your feet level again."

He did this and was soon at the top of the stairs.&nbsp; "Easy!"

"Right, up is easy.&nbsp; Now when you come down, be very careful.&nbsp; I don't want to explain to the paramedics why my husband was coming downstairs wearing high heels and panties."

"Ha ha," he said.

"When you come down, first and foremost, hold onto the railing.&nbsp; Walk slowly.&nbsp; You'll be walking on the ball of your foot again, not the entire foot.&nbsp; Lower your first foot onto the step below.&nbsp; Rebalance your weight onto that foot.&nbsp; Then bring down your other foot and do the same thing on the next step."

He hung his foot out over the first step.&nbsp; "Hmm."

"Not so easy now is it?" she laughed.

"The step isn't wide enough."

"Yes it is, you just have to approach it differently.&nbsp; Normally, you never want to turn your foot sideways.&nbsp; You want to keep your toes pointed forward.&nbsp; But sometimes, the stairs aren't wide enough and you'll need to turn yourself somewhat sideways and bring your foot down at an angle.&nbsp; When you go to bring your second foot down, you'll actually have to cross over your leg."

He did this very awkwardly.&nbsp; "It's like I'm climbing a ladder."

"Yep," she said and watched her hilariously dressed husband make his way down the stairs in an exaggerated way like a Hollywood starlet from the 1930s doing her big staircase seduction scene.&nbsp; When he reached the bottom, she sent him back up and down several more times until he started to get more comfortable.&nbsp; "Good.&nbsp; You'll need to practice this a lot, but you're off to a good start."

"This'll be easier in flats," he said.

"Sure it would, but you lost the bet and I prefer you in heels," she said matter-of-factly.&nbsp; She started toward the living room and he chased after her.&nbsp; He was a good deal slower than she was in heels.

"How did I lose the bet?!"

She held up her wrist so he could see her watch.&nbsp; "It's almost been an hour."

"Oh crap!&nbsp; Two out of three?" he asked hopefully.

She shook her head.&nbsp; "I'll go shopping tomorrow over lunch and bring you back a variety of shoes.&nbsp; In the meantime, wear these heels around the house.

--0--

The next two days were days Loren wanted to forget.&nbsp; It never occurred to him that Stephanie would keep up this act for both days.&nbsp; He assumed things would return to normal until the party, but he was wrong.

For one thing, she made him dress femininely the entire time, but she chose his wardrobe selectively as she wanted to get a sense of how different looks worked on him.&nbsp; That meant experimenting.&nbsp; Thus, she would pair a white dress shirt with a red bra to see if the bra showed through.&nbsp; She would pair his dark gray dress slacks with a pink blouse to see if the blouse looked too feminine.&nbsp; She even made him wear one of his suits with a purple cami.&nbsp; For dinners, she always made him switch into a dress.&nbsp; Apart from this, however, he wore certain things the entire time.&nbsp; For example, he wore makeup and dangly earrings the entire time.&nbsp; He always wore a bra, panties and pantyhose, except when she made him try stockings.&nbsp; His nails were always painted, though the color changed from red to silver to white to pink to red.&nbsp; And no matter what else he wore, he always wore heels.&nbsp; Indeed, for two days, his heels came no closer to the ground than three and a half inches except when he showered.&nbsp; Even at night, she made him wear high-heeled mules along with a babydoll nightie.

Loren enjoyed much of this, but it bothered him that Stephanie kept suggesting she was getting him ready for his "public debut."&nbsp; Despite the thrill he was getting from this, something was warning him deep down that Stephanie was getting carried way.

One area in which Stephanie certainly got carried away was with the housework.&nbsp; In accordance with the book, Stephanie made Loren do all the housework.&nbsp; This bothered him because he didn't like feeling like a servant.&nbsp; Making this worse, she filmed him doing it.&nbsp; At first, this bothered Loren a lot because it was more blackmail material, but then he realized all she needed to effectively blackmail him was one photo, so it didn't matter if she had hours of him on film or seconds.&nbsp; Still, it made him nervous that she had amassed so much footage of him dressed as a women.

It also bothered him that Stephanie was starting to enjoy her power a little too much.&nbsp; She made repeated references too it, used it to win any argument that started, and even used it to wrestle the remote from him.&nbsp; She even seemed to start arguments just to use it.&nbsp; This made Loren feel weak, helpless and vulnerable, and that troubled him.&nbsp; Indeed, while Stephanie's mood remained jovial the entire time, he became increasingly pensive.&nbsp; It made him nervous to literally be at his wife's mercy, particularly as she could be unpredictable and moody.&nbsp; It wasn't that he didn't trust her, it was that he feared she didn't understand how horrible things would get for him if this got out.&nbsp; And he honestly wasn't sure she would give this up?

That said, however, he did secretly get a real kick out of the "forbidden fruit" aspect of this.&nbsp; And every time Stephanie called him "Laura," her new name for him, it sent an electric shock to his constant erection.&nbsp; This was proving to be quite a turn on for him.

There were other benefits too.&nbsp; He and Stephanie had never been closer, nor had they ever played a sex game so intense or that lasted so long.&nbsp; Plus, Stephanie continued to dress sexily the whole time, something which also thrilled Loren.&nbsp; At first, she only wore the four-inch heels and the mini-dress because she didn't want to give Loren any excuse to back out.&nbsp; But after a while, she began to enjoy the "dominatrix bimbo" role, as she referred to Candi.

The one negative was that Stephanie refused to let him jerk himself off and she refused to do it for him until after the party.&nbsp; She said, "girls don't do that."&nbsp; She even watched him in the shower to make sure he didn't sneak one.&nbsp; The unreleased pressure was killing him.











Synopsis: Loren had no idea what he was getting into when his agent suggested he write transvestite fiction. Nor did he realize how eagerly his wife Stephanie would embrace the idea of feminizing her husband. How far would they go? 

Chapter 5: Dinner Party Preparations
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The night before the dinner, Loren and Stephanie sat in the kitchen.&nbsp; They'd gathered the ingredients for the meal and had divided up the cooking and table setting responsibilities.&nbsp; Everything was ready for tomorrow, except they had yet to discuss the obvious, a topic Loren was incredibly anxious to discuss, but afraid to bring up:&nbsp; what would he wear?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie sat at the kitchen table with her arms folded and her legs crossed.&nbsp; A pink five-inch high-heeled, open-toed pump dangled from her toes.&nbsp; She'd gone out that morning to buy various items of clothing, including a couple pair of five-inch heels.&nbsp; She never would have considered shoes like this in the past, but since she was playing the role of Candi, she wanted to be faithful to the book.&nbsp; Plus, she thought it was kind of kinky.&nbsp; And now that she wore them regularly, she was surprised to find they weren't actually as uncomfortable as she imaged; though that was because they had a three-quarter-inch platform, so they really weren't much higher than her already high four-inch heels.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren sat across from Stephanie in his dark gray slacks, a white shirt and black open-toed pumps.&nbsp; His bright red bra showed clearly through his shirt, especially as Stephanie had padded it slightly to give him the appearance of having small breasts.&nbsp; His dark red toenail and fingernails stood out prominently as well.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You know, as busy as we've been, we haven't had a chance to read much further in Brandy's story," Stephanie said with a trace of disappointment.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know.&nbsp; I guess we'll have to wait until after the party to catch up with Brandy and Candi," he said, suggesting for the first time that he was willing to continue after the dinner.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie smiled, but didn't say anything directly.&nbsp; "I wonder how our author would handle a scene like our dinner party?" she asked.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It would probably turn into an orgy," he said as he finished sorting ingredients.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie laughed.&nbsp; "Probably.&nbsp; As you said, he lacks subtlety."&nbsp; An evil grin appeared on her lips, but she stifled it.&nbsp; She waited a few seconds.&nbsp; "So you tell me, Mr. Author. . . sorry, Madame Author, how would a decent writer handle a scene like our dinner party?&nbsp; What would you do to make the scene exciting?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren folded his arms beneath his new breasts and crossed his legs in the feminine manner Stephanie demanded.&nbsp; "To make a dinner party exciting, you need some sort of subtext.&nbsp; You need double meanings and little secrets going on, and you need to build suspense."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Like what?&nbsp; Give me an example," she said.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren failed to notice her intense interest.&nbsp; "Well, the shared secret that he's wearing women's underwear is a strong start.&nbsp; You can build all kinds of subtext from that.&nbsp; Then you need a ticking time bomb, something the audience knows is going to blow up on the main characters but which they can't see.&nbsp; Some sort of risk to up the stakes."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You mean, like the guy's fly is open and he keeps getting ready to stand up?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing that obvious, but that's the general idea.&nbsp; Something that keeps the danger of getting caught right up there in the front of the reader's mind."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What else?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I was writing it, I'd probably end it with a dramatic reveal where the couple gets caught."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What would happen then?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, in a real book, the people would storm out pretty upset at being brought into a perverted sex game.&nbsp; In porn, I supposed they would jump in and play along."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Give me some ideas for a ticking time bomb."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren shrugged his shoulders.&nbsp; "Nothing comes to mind. . . maybe the zipper thing, like you said.&nbsp; Or if I wanted to go over the top, I'd have the guy wear a skirt and have to find ways to keep from standing up.&nbsp; Then I'd have one of the characters drop a fork and keep meaning to pick it up, but getting caught up in the conversation."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie smiled.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, none of that would work in real life," Loren said, still oblivious to her keen interest.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, of course," she agreed, trying to hide her excitement.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So what am I wearing tomorrow?"&nbsp; He held up his fingernails.&nbsp; "I'm not wearing this."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, of course, not.&nbsp; The idea is to keep this our secret."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So what am I wearing?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That will be my little surprise."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --0--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was an hour before the guests were to arrive.&nbsp; Stephanie was excited.&nbsp; She had decided to stay in the Candi character, despite the party.&nbsp; Hence, she planned to wear more risqu� clothes than she normally would.&nbsp; Specifically, she decided to wear an ultra-tight pink mini-dress, which she'd always avoided because she thought it was too tight, with pink thong panties and no bra.&nbsp; To this, she added multiple earrings, something she rarely did, and the five-inch pink heels she bought the prior day.&nbsp; She painted her finger and toenails silver.&nbsp; She couldn't wait to see if anyone caught on to anything unusual about her. . . or Loren.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren was a nervous wreck.&nbsp; All day he'd been watching the clock tick down and with each passing second, his terror grew.&nbsp; When it finally came time to change, he almost couldn't go through with it.&nbsp; In fact, he nearly begged Stephanie to change her mind, but he knew she wouldn't.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren stripped off his makeup and the nail polish from his fingers and took a long hot shower to calm himself down.&nbsp; He left the bright red polish on his toes, as instructed.&nbsp; He also made sure to shave his entire body again so there was no stubble.&nbsp; When he finished, he toweled himself dry and stepped into the bedroom, where Stephanie had laid out his clothes.&nbsp; On the bed were pink panties, a pink bra, tan stockings, some black dress pants he hadn't seen before, and a pinkish-red sweater he hadn't seen before either.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where did the pants and sweater come from?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie sat as her vanity table checking her makeup.&nbsp; "I picked those up when I got my new five-inch heels."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why?" he asked as he picked up the knitted sweater and turned it uncomfortably in his hand.&nbsp; It had a subtle heart pattern, a mock-turtleneck and three-quarter sleeves.&nbsp; The sweater sat on that fine line where it was neither masculine nor feminine and how people perceived it would probably depend on who wore it.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought they would look nice on you."&nbsp; She paused.&nbsp; "You don't have to wear the sweater if you don't want to," Stephanie said innocently, "but the pink bra shows right through your dress shirt."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren shivered.&nbsp; "No, I'll wear it," he said before sliding on the panties and then attaching the bra.&nbsp; He pulled the pantyhose up his legs.&nbsp; Then he walked over to his sock drawer.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where do you think you're going?" she asked as she watched him in her mirror.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm getting some socks."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No way, Laura."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What?!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No socks.&nbsp; You wear what I give you or nothing."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But everyone will see I'm wearing pantyhose!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be so paranoid.&nbsp; They won't be looking at your ankles.&nbsp; Besides, the pants I got you are longer than your normal pants and will cover you better."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren scowled.&nbsp; "How can I wear longer pants?&nbsp; I'll be stepping on them all night and my wingtips will rip right through them," he said sharply.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't get nasty with me Laura.&nbsp; And if you want to wear shorter pants and show everyone your pantyhose, that's fine by me.&nbsp; Personally, if I were as concerned about getting caught as you claim to be, then I would choose the longer pants, but it's up to you."&nbsp; She paused to watch Loren's expression as he picked up the pants.&nbsp; They were black but with a nearly invisible reddish plaid pattern.&nbsp; They had a hidden side zipper, which was distinctly not masculine, and they were wider at the bottom than they were in the leg.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh no," Loren groaned.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh yes," she said.&nbsp; "And as for tripping over them, you won't be tripping over them in your wingtips because you aren't wearing your wingtips."&nbsp; She rose and walked over to the side of the bed, where sitting unnoticed by Loren, were a pair of Stephanie's black loafers.&nbsp; These looked exactly like Loren's normal loafers except they had a one and a half-inch block heel as compared to the half-inch heel his male loafers had.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can and you will!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren stared at his wife.&nbsp; "Everyone will know!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Only if you go around telling them.&nbsp; Seriously, are you planning to put your feet up on the table?&nbsp; They look just like male loafers and with the extra length in the pants, no one will notice a thing about your shoes."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But--"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No 'but,' dear.&nbsp; Get dressed."&nbsp; She patted him on the rear before returning to the vanity and the lipstick pencil in her hand.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren took a deep breath and got dressed.&nbsp; When he finished, he examined himself in the mirror.&nbsp; He wasn't obviously feminine, but he wasn't as masculine as usual either.&nbsp; The sweater wasn't overtly feminine, but it was tight, which allowed hints of the bra straps to show through at the back, though he didn't realize that.&nbsp; Plus, Stephanie insisted on padding the bra ever so slightly, which gave him the appearance of very small breasts.&nbsp; The pants looked masculine enough that no one would question them, unless they noticed the missing zipper.&nbsp; The loafers gave just a hint of something being off, especially when he walked.&nbsp; Fortunately for Loren, it was only a hint and it wasn't enough to scream "women's shoes."&nbsp; Where the problem really began, however, was his face.&nbsp; Stephanie miscalculated a bit on his eyebrows the prior day and they had crossed over into "oddly feminine."&nbsp; Also, the way she had curled his collar-length hair to give it a frizzy look made his hair seem effeminate.&nbsp; The clear polish on his fingernails didn't help either, as it gave his hands a soft, sparkly appearance.&nbsp; Would anyone who didn't know what to look for notice?&nbsp; Loren didn't know, and that worried him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie didn't know either.&nbsp; But unlike Loren, it excited her to find out.&nbsp; And what excited her even more were the surprises she had planned for poor Laura!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Chapter 6: Feminine Roulette
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren wanted to wait at the table as the guests arrived so they never got a chance to see his pants and shoes.&nbsp; Stephanie wouldn't hear of it.&nbsp; She made Loren open the door as she stood behind him so she could watch their faces.&nbsp; If they made him, she wanted to witness the moment.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; First to arrive were Kathleen and Peter.&nbsp; Kathleen was Stephanie's friend since college and actually lived a few houses down.&nbsp; She wore a dark blue, figure-hugging, calf-length dress with a thin black belt and basic mid-heeled black pumps.&nbsp; She kissed Loren on the cheek before hugging Stephanie.&nbsp; She didn't seem to notice anything.&nbsp; Her husband Peter wore khaki pants and a blue blazer.&nbsp; He shook Loren's hand and also noticed nothing.&nbsp; Stephanie was almost disappointed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Moments later, Jane and Greg arrived.&nbsp; Jane was Stephanie's friend from work.&nbsp; She wore black pants, a copper turtle-neck sweater, and reddish-brown boots with a minor heel.&nbsp; Greg wore brown corduroy pants, black loafers and a tweed jacket.&nbsp; They didn't notice anything either.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When they were all seated, Stephanie asked what everyone wanted to drink.&nbsp; She then fetched the drinks as the two couples and Loren started the conversation.&nbsp; She returned just in time for the evening's first hiccup.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Loren, I have to ask.&nbsp; Are you wearing perfume?" Kathleen asked bluntly as she took the wine glass from Stephanie.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The color left Loren's face.&nbsp; "Uh. . . no, I'm not wearing it. . . uh, well, actually yes, I am 'wearing' it, but I didn't put it on if that's what you mean," said Loren, who sat between Kathleen and Jane and directly across from Stephanie.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kathleen cocked her head and looked confused, while Jane sniffed at Loren.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What I mean is, I was walking past Stephanie when she was putting on her perfume and I inadvertently walked through a cloud of it," he explained.&nbsp; In truth, Stephanie shot him with a blast of her perfume as he pulled on the sweater.&nbsp; When he asked how he would explain this, Stephanie responded that she was sure he would think of something.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kathleen laughed.&nbsp; "That's ok, sweetie, you smell pretty," she said and she patted his hand.&nbsp; But the moment she did, she raised an eyebrow and looked down at his hand.&nbsp; "Did you also happen to be walking past when Stephie was doing her nails?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Terror struck Loren and he froze, though his erection returned with a vengeance.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kathleen held up his hand.&nbsp; "Unless I'm mistaken, someone got a manicure!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Leave the poor fellow alone," said Peter.&nbsp; "I'm sorry Loren, my wife recently went to a drag show and she's been talking about it non-stop.&nbsp; You'd think she was obsessed."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ignore him," she said drolly.&nbsp; "Where do you get your manicures, sweetie?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren's face turned bright red.&nbsp; "I, uh, don't.&nbsp; I mean, this was the first time.&nbsp; I, uh, won a raffle and the prize was a manicure and I figured it couldn't hurt to look good."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did you get your toes done too?" she asked.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No," he said cautiously.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't sound so sure, maybe we should check?" she said as she pretended to look under the table.&nbsp; Fortunately, she only pretended.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren instinctively shifted his feet away from Kathleen.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kathleen turned to face Stephanie.&nbsp; "I don't know, Stephanie.&nbsp; Perfume. . . nail polish.&nbsp; It sounds like your husband's becoming a regular sissy," she said with a laugh.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie laughed.&nbsp; "Don't I know it!&nbsp; You should have seen how hard I had to fight to keep him from asking for cherry-red nail polish!&nbsp; And you wouldn't believe the lengths I have to go to protect my closet!&nbsp; Who knew being married to a sissy would be so much work!"&nbsp; She winked at Loren as all three women burst out giggling.&nbsp; The husbands looked uncomfortable.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren scowled.&nbsp; "Give me a break!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you call her when she's dressed?" Jane asked, joining the joke.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She calls herself 'Laura'!" Stephanie said.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How precious!" squealed Kathleen.&nbsp; "I'm trying to imagine Laura cooking you dinner in her best little housewife dress."&nbsp; She turned to Loren.&nbsp; "Tell me Laura, do you prefer skirts or dresses?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Laura's more of a pants girl," Stephanie said.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren suddenly felt a rush of terror.&nbsp; Was she about to expose him?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kathleen threw her hand out in an exaggerated way and let her wrist drop limp.&nbsp; "Pshaw!&nbsp; Sissy's don't like pants, they all wants skirts.&nbsp; Nothing says 'feminine' more than a skirt."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Personally, I think heels are more feminine," Stephanie said.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Or panties!" Jane said.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, that's true," Kathleen said.&nbsp; "So Laura, what have you found to be the most feminine article of your new wardrobe?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren gave her a sour look.&nbsp; Before he could speak, however, Peter spoke up:&nbsp; "Leave the poor guy alone."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh Peter," Kathleen said.&nbsp; "Don't be such a spoilsport.&nbsp; We were just teasing Loren and he was being a great sport about it.&nbsp; Then you had to go and be a jerk about it."&nbsp; She took a sip of her wine.&nbsp; "Sometimes I don't know how I married such a close-minded man!&nbsp; Besides, it doesn't matter what he wears.&nbsp; If he really was wearing Stephanie's clothes, then I say good for having such an evolved relationship."&nbsp; She patted Loren on the wrist as she said this.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie raised an eyebrow.&nbsp; "You don't think it would be a little weird for a wife to let her husband wear her clothes?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I don't."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So it wouldn't bother you if Peter came home in a skirt?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She laughed.&nbsp; "I didn't say that!&nbsp; He definitely doesn't have the legs to carry off a skirt."&nbsp; She rubbed her chin.&nbsp; "But no, it wouldn't bother me one bit.&nbsp; I think the world would be a better place if more men were in touch with their feminine sides."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'll drink to that," Jane said and raised her glass.&nbsp; The other women followed.&nbsp; The men didn't.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After that, the conversation turned to other issues for some time.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --0--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later, as Loren listened to Greg describe a work of art his museum had restored, he felt Stephanie's feet wrap around his ankles beneath the table.&nbsp; She rubbed her foot up and down his leg beneath his pants.&nbsp; He couldn't wait for her feet to keep moving higher.&nbsp; She winked at him.&nbsp; He smiled back.&nbsp; Suddenly her feet slid down on each side of his left foot and yanked.&nbsp; Somehow, she managed to pull his shoe off his foot.&nbsp; His heart skipped a beat.&nbsp; What was she doing!&nbsp; If anyone looked under the table right now, they could see his nylon encased foot and his red painted toenails!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then he felt her feet surround his other foot.&nbsp; Pulling his foot away would do no good because her feet were already in place, plus he couldn't risk angering her because he needed the other shoe back.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren imperceptibly shook his head at her, pleading with her not to do this.&nbsp; She smiled and slowly nodded back.&nbsp; He shook his head again.&nbsp; A sinister smile settled on her lips.&nbsp; She nodded again and he knew it would happen.&nbsp; He bit his lip and let her slide the other loafer off his foot and take it away.&nbsp; He now wore no shoes, and if anyone dropped a fork or napkin, or for any reason looked under the table, he would be caught.&nbsp; His heart raced as he waited to see what happened next.&nbsp; He felt his underarms begin to sweat.&nbsp; But Stephanie seemed in no hurry to do anything.&nbsp; Instead, she turned her attention to the conversation and exchanged several thoughts with Greg.&nbsp; Loren waited pensively, not knowing what to expect, terrified that someone would notice.&nbsp; Minute after minute he waited to be caught.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After what seemed like an eternity, he felt her foot again.&nbsp; She dropped his shoes, one at a time on top of his feet.&nbsp; He breathed a huge sigh of relief and maneuvered the shoes so he could slide his feet into them.&nbsp; But when he slid his foot into the first shoe, he immediately realized these weren't the loafers.&nbsp; These were Stephanie's pink, five-inch heels!
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren shook his head as vigorously as possible without anyone noticing.&nbsp; The sinister grin returned to Stephanie's lips.&nbsp; She nodded.&nbsp; Loren put his finger together as if he was praying.&nbsp; She shook her head.&nbsp; Loren pleaded with his eyes.&nbsp; Stephanie squinted at him and appeared momentarily like she would growl.&nbsp; She tapped her fingernail once against her wine glass.&nbsp; Fortunately, the others were wrapped up in a debate about the meaning of the painting Greg had described, so they didn't notice this exchange.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren swallowed hard.&nbsp; He had no idea where this was headed, but there was only one way out, and that was to move forward and to hope that Stephanie would quickly return his shoes before anyone noticed.&nbsp; He slipped his feet into the heels, knowing that if anyone looked under the table now, he would be ruined.&nbsp; He nodded to Stephanie.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A moment later, Stephanie rose from her seat.&nbsp; "I need to check the stove and then I'll be back with the soup."&nbsp; She walked far enough away from the table that Loren could see she wore his loafers.&nbsp; Then she stopped.&nbsp; "Loren, can you come help me with the soup?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren froze.&nbsp; What was Stephanie thinking?&nbsp; If he stood up now, there was no way he wouldn't be caught.&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, are you coming?" she repeated.&nbsp; He could see her smiling mischievously.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I. . . uh--"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh wait," she said looking at her watch, "the soup won't be done for another five minutes.&nbsp; I don't need help yet, dear."&nbsp; With that, she disappeared into the kitchen.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the others began discussing prior vacations, Loren sat there terrified.&nbsp; All it would take was for one of them to knock something off the table or to get up to use the bathroom or visit Stephanie in the kitchen and he would be exposed.&nbsp; It would be impossible to miss the bright pink high-heeled shoes on his feet.&nbsp; He wasn't even sure if the table cloth was long enough to keep Kathleen or Jane from seeing his shoes if they just leaned back, or if Peter or Greg could see them if he stuck his feet too far out the other side to hide them from Kathleen and Jane?&nbsp; Where exactly did he need to keep his feet to keep them hidden?&nbsp; His mouth went dry.&nbsp; Sweat dripped down his armpits.&nbsp; Yet, he was intensely erect.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie returned from the kitchen momentarily with a bottle of wine.&nbsp; She gave it to Peter to open as he held the opener.&nbsp; Then she asked Kathleen about a broach she wore.&nbsp; As she and Kathleen chatted about the broach, Loren felt Stephanie's feet touch his feet again.&nbsp; She wanted her shoes back and he wasted no time in helping her.&nbsp; He felt relieved to be rid of the incriminating pink heels and even more relieved to feel her slide the loafers back over to him. . . only, it wasn't the loafers.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At some point in the kitchen, Stephanie swapped out the loafers for some other pair of shoes.&nbsp; Loren couldn't see them, but he could feel they had a higher heel than the loafers, though nowhere near as high as the pink heels.&nbsp; They also felt like they had a much narrower heel than the loafers.&nbsp; He couldn't tell for sure, but these seemed smooth and had a closed toe.&nbsp; He slid them on, but he was terrified what they looked like.&nbsp; For all he knew, they were bright red!&nbsp; And he couldn't look because he feared looking would draw Kathleen or Jane's eyes to his feet.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie rose again.&nbsp; "This time I really could use your help, dear."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren felt the sweat running down the sides of his chest.&nbsp; He desperately hoped she would change her mind and tell him to stay seated.&nbsp; She didn't.&nbsp; Slowly, reluctantly, Loren rose to his feet.&nbsp; He realized immediately, these shoes had a very thin heel because he had to balance.&nbsp; Based on the added height, he estimated they had a two-inch heel, maybe two and a half.&nbsp; He prayed they were black, dull and unnoticeable.&nbsp; Like a condemned man, he stepped away from the table.&nbsp; He took his first step, unable to look down without drawing attention to himself.&nbsp; Then another, then another.&nbsp; Soon he was in the kitchen, out of sight.&nbsp; He wanted to scream at Stephanie, but she grabbed him first and kissed him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is sooo exciting!" she whispered and jumped up and down.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's terrifying!&nbsp; How could you?!" he demanded, also in a whisper.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be such a sissy!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He started to protest, but she told him to stop.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She continued:&nbsp; "We need to serve food.&nbsp; Just be a good girl tonight and follow my lead and you'll come through this with your masculinity intact.&nbsp; But mess up and Jane and Kathleen will be all over you.&nbsp; You'll be the new project and they'll never let you become a man again!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren gritted his teeth.&nbsp; He had to trust her, he had no choice, but he was starting to hate this game.&nbsp; He enjoyed Stephanie teasing him, but this was too much.&nbsp; He took a deep breath.&nbsp; Only then did he look down at his feet.&nbsp; He saw a pair of basic black pumps with a narrow two-inch heel.&nbsp; Fortunately, his long pants almost entirely covered them.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Where are my loafers?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, I didn't like those."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want them back?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She smirked.&nbsp; "Don't push me, dear," she sang, "unless you want to wear mine again?&nbsp; I'll happily make you wear them for the rest of the dinner."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He shuddered.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She handed him the pot to take to the table.&nbsp; "And if you want my advice, don't draw any attention to your feet.&nbsp; When you walk, the pantyhose do show.&nbsp; Also, you better be more careful walking on the tiles in here because your heels make an awful racket."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren returned to the table quite nervous.&nbsp; He had to admit though, it was indeed thrilling.&nbsp; But it was also sickening.&nbsp; Twice more, Stephanie called upon him to help her bring food from the kitchen.&nbsp; Each time, he was terrified someone would spot him and yell out:&nbsp; "he's wearing heels!"&nbsp; But they didn't.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --0--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When they finished eating, it was time to clean up the dishes.&nbsp; Loren volunteered to stay behind as the others moved to the living room so he could clear the table and clean the kitchen, but Stephanie made a big show of having none of it.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'll clean up the table, dear.&nbsp; You do so much around here already.&nbsp; Why don't all of you go to the living room where Loren can serve you a little Brandy and tell you about his latest book."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Her threat was clear, so he agreed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren managed to serve the drinks without anyone noticing his shoes, mainly by keeping his knees slightly bent so his pants hung all the way to the carpet.&nbsp; It also helped that the others were already slightly intoxicated from the wine, and thus weren't particularly observant at the moment.&nbsp; When everyone had a drink, Loren quickly sat down on the couch where the coffee table could hide his feet.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So Loren, what are you writing now?" Greg asked.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just then Stephanie came from the kitchen.&nbsp; "You're not going to believe this, Greg!&nbsp; Tell him what your agent told you, dear!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hold on!&nbsp; I'm not writing anything yet," Loren said defensively.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now I'm intrigued," Kathleen said.&nbsp; "Why so defensive, Loren?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren's face turned red.&nbsp; He realized he just made a much bigger deal of the issue.&nbsp; "I just want to be clear.&nbsp; I'm a political thriller writer.&nbsp; What Stephanie is talking about is something my agent suggested, but I'm not doing that."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And what would that be?" Jane asked.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go on, dear," Stephanie prodded him as she sat down next to him and put her hand on his knee.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren saw everyone in the room staring at him.&nbsp; "She said porno is what sells now," he said uncomfortably.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Porno?!" said several of the surprised guests.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not just 'porno'," said Stephanie with a laugh.&nbsp; She was tipsy as well and Loren realized this could mean danger because alcohol tended to make her very talkative.&nbsp; "Tell them what kind of porno."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren's face turned even redder.&nbsp; It wouldn't have bothered him to say this a week ago, but the fact he was wearing panties, women's shoes and a bra suddenly gave him a great deal of shame on this topic.&nbsp; "Transvestite fiction."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You mean like men in drag?!" Kathleen hooted.&nbsp; Again, the husbands looked uncomfortable.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's what she said sells right now," Loren added quickly.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, you go girl!" Kathleen added.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren expected more, but it never came.&nbsp; Instead, they moved on to other topics.&nbsp; And about forty minutes later, they decided to call it a night.&nbsp; By this point, Loren figured he was safe as no one had mentioned anything.&nbsp; So when he and Stephanie saw the two couples to the door, he thought nothing of it.&nbsp; He wasn't even all that careful about hiding his feet.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then it happened.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Jane and Greg already gone and Peter sliding on his coat, Kathleen, who was still a little tipsy, dropped her purse.&nbsp; She crouched down to pick it up.&nbsp; Loren looked down at her and suddenly realized she had a clear view of his feet. . . less than an arms length away.&nbsp; He felt his stomach drop.&nbsp; Had she noticed?&nbsp; She must have noticed?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kathleen stood up again, holding her purse, and gave Stephanie a huge hug and peck on the cheek.&nbsp; "Good night, dear.&nbsp; Thanks for having us!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Anytime," Stephanie said and kissed her back.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Peter stepped through the door.&nbsp; Then Kathleen hugged Loren and kissed him on the cheek as well.&nbsp; "Good night and no hard feelings, Laura," she said quietly in his ear and giggled.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They were gone.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh my God!&nbsp; What a rush!" Stephanie squealed after she closed the door.&nbsp; "We've got to do that again!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No way!&nbsp; It was terrifying!" Loren responded.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't give me that, you were hard as a rock all night.&nbsp; You loved it!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hated it!&nbsp; And Kathleen knew!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She doesn't know."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, she does!&nbsp; She bent down and saw these damn shoes you made me wear and then whispered 'Laura' in my ear!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You're overreacting.&nbsp; She was just having one last joke with you about the teasing she gave you earlier."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No.&nbsp; She knows!&nbsp; I'm ruined."&nbsp; He stormed off toward the kitchen with his heels echoing each step along the way off the hardwood floor in their hallway.&nbsp; Stephanie followed him.&nbsp; "And you told them!&nbsp; Why did you tell them?!" he demanded when they reached the kitchen.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I never said anything."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A tear actually formed at the edge of Loren's eye.&nbsp; "What were you thinking making me swap shoes with you?&nbsp; If one of them had dropped a fork or something I was finished!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Aw, was the wittle girl scared?" Stephanie mocked him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And pumps?&nbsp; It's bad enough you made me wear women's loafers, but switching to pumps?!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie smiled.&nbsp; She walked over to him and placed her hand on his rock hard penis through his slacks.&nbsp; "I know what would help you forget the night?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm not in the mood," he said, though he realized he was very much in the mood.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not in the mood?&nbsp; Not in the mood for a little reward for how well you did tonight?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She began to unzip his pants.&nbsp; He had wanted to ejaculate for three days now, but she wouldn't let him.&nbsp; The thought that he would finally get his wish wiped everything else from his mind.&nbsp; He exhaled.&nbsp; "You mean it?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, I mean it.&nbsp; But there are two conditions."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He furrowed his brow.&nbsp; "What conditions?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First, I'm on top.&nbsp; You're too fast when you're on top."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And the second?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I choose the lingerie."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He looked confused.&nbsp; "I never get to choose your lingerie?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I mean yours."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 











The Writer's Secret
by Ann Michelle
(http://annemichellesworld.blogspot.com/)

Synopsis: Loren had no idea what he was getting into when his agent suggested he write transvestite fiction. Nor did he realize how eagerly his wife Stephanie would embrace the idea of feminizing her husband. How far would they go? 


Chapter 7: Laura Buys Shoes. . . Lots of Shoes
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren rolled out of bed the following morning.&nbsp; He yawned.&nbsp; Despite having sex with his wife three time the prior night, he felt like he could immediately go again.&nbsp; He still wore the pink teddy she'd made him wear and the stockings.&nbsp; He'd worn her pink heels too, but they fell off his feet somewhere during the night.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I really can't believe we did that last night," he said.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It was great," she purred.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I mean the party."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That was great too.&nbsp; We should do it again.&nbsp; I'm getting all kinds of ideas for things we could try next time."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren shook his head.&nbsp; "No way, I'm out of the crossdresser business as of this morning."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She chuckled.&nbsp; "I doubt it."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I'm serious."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She sat up.&nbsp; "We've barely cracked the book!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Doesn't matter."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh yes it does, I say when this ends and until we finish the book, I'm not giving up my tape."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Now Loren laughed.&nbsp; "Ha!&nbsp; I've been thinking about this and that tape doesn't matter.&nbsp; I'll just tell people I was doing an experiment for a new book about a crossdresser serial killer, like in Dressed to Kill."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You think so?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know so," he said sitting on the bed as he pulled his stockings off his legs.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How are you going to explain the party?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about it?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She rose to her knees behind him and wrapped her arms around his back.&nbsp; "How are you going to explain wearing women's underwear and women's heels at a party where we invited two other married couples to join us?&nbsp; No one will buy that as research.&nbsp; They'll see it for what it was, you getting a kick out of trying to pull this off beneath their noses."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Who's going to tell them?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I would!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You wouldn't?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Uh, hello?!&nbsp; I'm already blackmailing you with a video, why do you think I wouldn't throw that in?" she said.&nbsp; Her tone was somewhat playful but with enough seriousness that Loren knew she meant to get her way.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They won't believe you."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I wouldn't be so sure.&nbsp; I saw the way Jane and Kathleen looked at you.&nbsp; You yourself said Kathleen saw your heels.&nbsp; And we know she saw your nails and smelled your perfume.&nbsp; I think I saw both notice your bra straps--"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Bra straps?!&nbsp; But the sweater--"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ". . . was too tight.&nbsp; I saw your bra straps whenever you bent forward."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren's jaw dropped and he covered his mouth with his hands.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course, I could be wrong.&nbsp; But since I won't be protecting you and trying to convince them they didn't see what they think they saw and instead I'll be the one pointing these things out, I suspect they'll believe me."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren stared at his red toenails for some time.&nbsp; "You rotten blackmailer."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She smiled.&nbsp; Then she hugged him tighter.&nbsp; "Oh, come on.&nbsp; Don't even try to tell me you didn't love it?!&nbsp; And don't tell me you don't want to keep going?&nbsp; There is so much fun we can have with this."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren looked down at the teddy he wore.&nbsp; He looked at his pounding erection.&nbsp; He felt his horny wife holding him tightly.&nbsp; Maybe, he thought, maybe just a little while longer.&nbsp; "All right, but this needs to end soon."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She kissed his ear and slipped her hand down around his penis.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you want me to do?" he asked.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --0--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie pulled up outside the shoe store and turned off the engine.&nbsp; She had picked a store in an aging strip mall off the beaten path for Loren's first trip outside the house in women's clothes.&nbsp; That way they were unlikely to run into anyone they knew and the store wouldn't be very busy, especially on a Monday morning.&nbsp; Fewer people was better to get Loren's confidence up.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know about this," Loren said as he shifted uncomfortably in the passenger seat.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You'll do fine.&nbsp; No one will ever suspect."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren looked himself up and down.&nbsp; He wasn't so sure.&nbsp; He wore the same reddish-pink sweater he wore the night before, only Stephanie had padded his breasts to give him somewhere between an A and a B cup.&nbsp; His fingernails and toenails were now soft pink.&nbsp; He wore lipstick, blush, eye shadow and foundation, but all done very lightly.&nbsp; "Garish is a dead giveaway," Stephanie had warned him.&nbsp; She had also further plucked his eyebrows and added more obvious curl to his frizzy hair.&nbsp; He also wore the black pants Stephanie had bought for him and nude pantyhose.&nbsp; When he asked why he wasn't wearing a skirt, she replied, "For one thing, women don't always run around in skirts, and no one is going to think a crossdresser would wear pants.&nbsp; For another, we can't hide your constant erections in skirts.&nbsp; Also, we need to see how the shoes fit with the pants.&nbsp; Fitting skirts is easy, fitting heels to pants is a lot harder if you aren't wearing the pants."&nbsp; Finally, on his feet, he wore the same basic black pumps Stephanie slipped him under the table at the party.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why do I need to buy women's shoes again?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because I said so," she said as she dug through her purse.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I mean, why can't I just wear yours?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie could hear the nervousness in his voice.&nbsp; "Because your feet are just a bit too big for my shoes.&nbsp; It's bad for your feet and it's bad for my shoes."&nbsp; She closed her purse.&nbsp; "Come on, sissy."&nbsp; She exited the car.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren's hand shook as he reach for the door handle.&nbsp; He didn't want to leave the car, but she had given him no choice.&nbsp; He also knew that if he didn't act calmly, he would be discovered.&nbsp; It was time to summon every ounce of courage he had.&nbsp; Laura was going public.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie moved ahead of Loren toward the store.&nbsp; Loren was slowed by the sensations.&nbsp; He felt naked in the thin clothing.&nbsp; He felt exposed in the sunlight and the outside air.&nbsp; He heard the unfamiliar sound of his own heels tapping against the asphalt.&nbsp; And he felt the now familiar combination of terror and excitement at the prospect of being discovered.&nbsp; He tried to blank out everything except Stephanie and he followed her though the door.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren looked around.&nbsp; He'd been in many shoe stores, but never quite like this.&nbsp; For the first time, he consciously contemplated being in a women's shoe store with the intent of buying shoes.&nbsp; He saw rows of shoes and could smell the leather.&nbsp; He noticed purses and knickknacks and hats and other things he never noticed before in shoe stores.&nbsp; He also noticed no one had spotted him yet.&nbsp; Over his shoulder, two girls stood behind the counter chatting with each other.&nbsp; They barely noticed him.&nbsp; There were no other customers.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie marched Loren to the dress shoes and gave him the grand tour.&nbsp; She explained to him the difference between wedge heels, sandals, pumps, slingbacks, mules and slides and all their pros and cons.&nbsp; She kept choosing two shoes at random and asking him, "which do you like better?" and then quizzing him why he chose what he did.&nbsp; As they worked their way through the shelves, the blond girl from the counter came over to them.&nbsp; She wore a simple, red A-line dress and matching open-toed pumps with a three-inch wedge heel.&nbsp; She moved gracefully on the heels.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can I help you find something?" the girl asked.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, we're looking for some heels," said Stephanie.&nbsp; "I need a variety of four-inch hee--"&nbsp; She stopped mid-sentence, then she leaned in closer to the girl and whispered:&nbsp; "My new boss loves really high heels and I want to make a good impression, so I need something in the four and four-plus inch range.&nbsp; You know how men are?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The girl nodded.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie continued.&nbsp; "And my sister here needs a whole closet of shoes!&nbsp; She just had a flood and lost everything."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I've got just the thing for your boss," the girl said holding up a finger to tell Stephanie to wait a moment.&nbsp; She sauntered off to the back before returning with several boxes.&nbsp; The girl opened the first box.&nbsp; These contained basic black pumps with four-inch heels.&nbsp; The next were slingbacks with a wide open toe and then slingbacks with a peep toe.&nbsp; There were also basic black pumps with a five-inch heel.&nbsp; "I've got each of these in various colors too.&nbsp; Why don't you try them on while I get your sister started."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren breathed a sigh of relief.&nbsp; The girl didn't seem to notice he was a man.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did you have anything in mind?" she asked Loren.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not really," Loren said softly.&nbsp; Stephanie had warned him that trying to sound like a woman would come across as suspicious, so she told him just to speak softly.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Flats?&nbsp; Pumps?&nbsp; Sandals?&nbsp; Sneakers?" the girl asked.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why don't you look at some sandals for the party, Laura," Stephanie said.&nbsp; "Maybe something in silver.&nbsp; Then a variety of pumps in black."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The girl looked curiously at Stephanie and then at Loren and then shrugged her shoulders.&nbsp; She walked backwards to another section, indicating Loren should follow her.&nbsp; "What size?" she asked.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren shook his head.&nbsp; "It's been a long time since I measured."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The girl stopped to measure his foot.&nbsp; "Are you and your sister close?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh yes, we've always been close."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's nice.&nbsp; I have a sister, but we're not close."&nbsp; She set the measuring device aside and indicated Loren could slide his foot back into his shoe and follow her.&nbsp; He did, and she led him to a selection of sandals.&nbsp; "We have these in a variety of heel heights, but I take it your sister wants you wearing really high heels?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren sensed a hint of haughtiness in the question, but it could have been his imagination.&nbsp; He nodded.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The girl picked up the first pair.&nbsp; "These have a straight five-inch heel.&nbsp; I also have these with a one-inch platform or some with a two-inch platform, which makes the heels six inches."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren bit his lip.&nbsp; This wasn't going to be as easy as he thought owing to the number of choices.&nbsp; "I'd like to avoid anything five inches.&nbsp; Do you have anything in the three to four-inch range?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure."&nbsp; The girl stepped a few feet to the left.&nbsp; "Here are some similar shoes in the three to four-inch range.&nbsp; Some have platforms, some don't.&nbsp; Why don't you look around and I'll go help your sister."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren watched the girl walk over toward the counter, where he couldn't help but notice she and the other girl started giggling and the blond girl held her wrist limp.&nbsp; Had she read him?&nbsp; Loren felt sick.&nbsp; It was one thing to be spotted, it would be quite another to be spotted by this girl, who seemed cruel.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As he pondered this, Stephanie came over wearing black slingbacks.&nbsp; "I like these!&nbsp; Who knew Candi could have good taste.&nbsp; What do you think, dear?"&nbsp; She turned her foot for him to see.&nbsp; They had a four-and-three-quarter-inch heel, but a half-inch of that was platform.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think the blond knows," he said.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie looked over her shoulder at the giggling girl.&nbsp; "Doubt it."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren shivered.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But she will get suspicious if you don't start trying on shoes."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren looked at the rack.&nbsp; "What should I get?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie looked at the shoes.&nbsp; "Try these," she said picking up a pair of open-toed black pumps and a pair of black slingbacks.&nbsp; "Make sure they all have at least four-inch heels.&nbsp; You're welcome to go higher, but I wouldn't advise it.&nbsp; Also, get some neutral pumps, maybe some oxfords, and some pink and white wedges."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's a lot of shoes?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yep, but a girl needs her shoes.&nbsp; Also, after you get all that, surprise me.&nbsp; Get something a little sexy or edgy."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Surprise you?!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah, and make sure it's a good surprise, or I'll drag you back here to get something better. . . only, you'll be dressed like Loren when we come," she said with a wink.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's not funny!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She shrugged her shoulders.&nbsp; "Who's joking?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Again, Loren couldn't tell if she was serious or not.&nbsp; This seemed to be her new way of threatening him without really threatening.&nbsp; "Four-inch heels on everything?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "At least four-inch, that's the deal."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And you don't want to tell me what I should buy?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie put one hand on her hip and waved the other around.&nbsp; "I think you're a big girl now, Laura.&nbsp; It's time to make your own decisions.&nbsp; Just make sure I like what you choose."&nbsp; She walked back over to where she had been trying on the shoes.&nbsp; As she did, the blond girl returned.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You like those?" she asked Loren.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Uh. . . yeah."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The girl smiled.&nbsp; "You should probably walk around in them."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What?&nbsp; Oh, yes."&nbsp; Loren began walking toward a mirror so he could see the black open-toed pumps he wore.&nbsp; They fit, and the sight in the mirror of his painted toenails sticking out the front of the shoes made him hard.&nbsp; "These are nice."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ok, keep looking," said the girl and she went to Stephanie.&nbsp; As the girl drifted toward Stephanie, Loren added a pair of black slingbacks, a pair of white slingbacks, a pair of open-toed beige slingbacks, and a pair of pink and white sandals with a wedge heel made of cork.&nbsp; He tried on each pair and they all fit.&nbsp; He began looking for a pair of black loafers.&nbsp; By the time the girl returned, he had amassed a large collection of boxes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Finding anything?" she asked.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I think I'll take these."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The girl flipped through the collection and smiled.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I need one more thing," Loren said.&nbsp; "I need something really special."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For what occasion?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren tried to think of what a girl would consider a special occasion.&nbsp; "Uh. . . my husband is coming home from a long trip."&nbsp; It sounded very awkward.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The girl smirked.&nbsp; "Uh huh."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, really," he said defensively.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The girl raised an eyebrow.&nbsp; Whatever she thought was really going on, Loren was now giving her more reason to suspect it.&nbsp; She smiled strangely.&nbsp; "Ok, I know what you need."&nbsp; She walked him over to a different section where he saw what Stephanie called "hooker shoes."&nbsp; She stopped and picked up a pair of cherry-red mules with a wide open toe and a five-inch heel with no platform.&nbsp; "These will work," she said flatly.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His face turned red.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You should try them on," she said coldly.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's ok."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, try them on," she said firmly and handed them to Loren.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren's heart raced.&nbsp; Why was she suddenly so demanding?&nbsp; Did she know or was he being overly sensitive?&nbsp; He wasn't sure, but she scared him and he didn't want to cross her.&nbsp; He set the mules down and slid his feet out of the heels he already wore.&nbsp; He stepped into the mules.&nbsp; He immediately noticed they weren't very comfortable and balancing was difficult.&nbsp; Indeed, he almost fell at first, but the girl grabbed his arm and steadied him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You should go one size smaller in these," she said.&nbsp; "They'll look better."&nbsp; Loren wasn't going to argue, but she didn't wait for his approval in any event.&nbsp; She handed him the smaller size and he slid into them.&nbsp; "Now walk over to the mirror and back so I can see."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren did as he was told.&nbsp; This was the first time he wore mules and it took some adjustment as the shoes didn't move with his feet when he walked.&nbsp; Instead, he had to force them against his soles with his toes as he walked to make them leave the ground.&nbsp; But he was a quick learner and he was able to pass the blond girl's inspection.&nbsp; He went to slide his foot out of the shoes, but the girl stopped him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, you should wear them to get used to them."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's ok."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The girl ignored him.&nbsp; "Go walk to the front of the store and then come back to me," she said coldly.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren looked at her.&nbsp; This was clearly a demand, and there was something about the condescension in her eyes which spoke of cruelty, so he knew instinctively she was not someone he should cross.&nbsp; Indeed, he had begun to fear her, though he didn't quite know why.&nbsp; He looked over the girl's shoulder, hoping Stephanie would rescue him, but she was across the store.&nbsp; With no choice left, he did as she instructed and walked to the front of the store, right by the other girl behind the counter.&nbsp; She smiled at him.&nbsp; Then he turned and went back to the blond.&nbsp; She sat down on one of the benches just before he returned.&nbsp; She crossed her legs and let her shoe dangle.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ok," he said, hoping to finish the sentence with, "that's all I need."&nbsp; But the girl interrupted him.&nbsp; She pointed toward two pair of Mary Janes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You need those too."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren looked where she pointed.&nbsp; Both were Mary Janes with four-inch heels.&nbsp; One pair had the classic t-strap and the other just had a single strap across the arch.&nbsp; Both were a sort of dark burgundy-red, with the t-strap shoes being more red and the single-strap shoes being more brown.&nbsp; "I think--"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Try them on," she insisted.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren took a deep breath.&nbsp; He looked for help from Stephanie, but she was still across the store.&nbsp; It was just him versus this girl and she intimidated him.&nbsp; He sat down on the opposite bench and strapped on the first pair.&nbsp; As Loren modeled both pair for her, the girl grabbed two more pair of shoes and added those to the set of boxes without permission.&nbsp; Loren wasn't even sure what was in them, but he wasn't going to say anything.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, Stephanie came over with three boxes.&nbsp; She saw the collection Loren had built up and laughed.&nbsp; "When I said surprise me, Laura, I didn't think you'd buy the whole store!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren looked helplessly at the two women as they laughed at him.&nbsp; The blond girl's laugh seemed malicious.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie grabbed her own boxes and they made their way to the counter.&nbsp; Once there, Stephanie paid for the shoes with her credit card.&nbsp; It was expensive and she joked it would come out of Loren's pay � she told the two girls "Laura" worked as a maid � but she never suggested returning anything.&nbsp; She even picked up a purse for Loren, a simple black leather purse about the size a phonebook with a short double strap.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Stephanie paid, Loren found it hard to meet the blond girl's gaze.&nbsp; He was sure she knew, though she never said anything specific.&nbsp; But he could hear it in her accusing tone and in the way her attitude changed from helpful to commanding.&nbsp; Also, as he slid into the passenger seat of the car, he could swear he saw the two girls double over with laughter inside the store.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He wanted to go home and cry.&nbsp; But they weren't done shopping.


Chapter 8: The Uniform Shop
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren moped as Stephanie drove them to another part of town.&nbsp; "The blond girl spotted me," he said tersely.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good for her, I hope it made her day," Stephanie responded indifferently.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What?!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, come on dear, you had your fun, let the girl have hers."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That was not fun!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course it was, and you enjoyed it."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I did not," he insisted.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She reached over and squeezed his erection through his pants.&nbsp; "Apparently, you did."&nbsp; She let go of his erection.&nbsp; "Let's be honest, Loren.&nbsp; You got to do a little shopping and you got to flirt with a sexy young blond girl in the process.&nbsp; You loved it, and you've got the raging hard-on to prove it.&nbsp; And in exchange for your fun, she gets to go home and tell her boyfriend all about the sissy she served today.&nbsp; That's a fair trade."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's not funny."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie laughed.&nbsp; "Sure it is, you just have to step back a bit to see the humor in it.&nbsp; You might even have planted an idea in her head. . . opened her eyes."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What idea?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Think about it.&nbsp; When she goes home tonight, she may decide her boyfriend would look better in heels, just like you do."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What?!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh come on, dear!&nbsp; We're both thinking it.&nbsp; You're a sexier sissy than you were a man."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren scowled.&nbsp; "I am most definitely not thinking that!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, you should," she said and patted his erection condescendingly.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You better be teasing," he growled.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She changed the topic.&nbsp; "I can't help but notice, by the way, that you went way overboard on shoes.&nbsp; I guess you're a shoe-girl.&nbsp; Is that it?&nbsp; Have you got a thing for shoes?" she asked dryly.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren rolled his eyes.&nbsp; "She made me buy these because she knew I was a man.&nbsp; It was blackmail."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie raised an eyebrow.&nbsp; "Was it really?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And what exactly did she threaten?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you mean?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did she say, 'hey sissy, I'm going to go tell your wife right over there that you're wearing her clothes if you don't buy more shoes?'&nbsp; Was that it?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren frowned.&nbsp; "No."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe she threatened to tell your boss?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course not, I don't have a boss."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So she didn't threaten to tell your wife or your boss.&nbsp; What exactly did she threaten?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It wasn't specific," he said quietly.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did she even make a single threat?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren folded his arms beneath the fake breasts and didn't answer.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Uh, huh," she said.&nbsp; "So she blackmailed you by saying nothing?"&nbsp; Stephanie laughed.&nbsp; "Face it dear, you made the decision to buy more shoes all by yourself, and you're just using her as an excuse.&nbsp; Frankly, I'm dying to see what you bought.&nbsp; We'll need to do a little fashion show when we get home."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren bit his lip.&nbsp; Was this all going too far?&nbsp; The store scared him more than excited him.&nbsp; Had the girl really spotted him or was that just his imagination?&nbsp; And if she had spotted him, how had she spotted him?&nbsp; Was he not as convincing as he believed?&nbsp; One thing was for sure, he didn't like the feeling of being helpless before someone who was much more malicious than Stephanie.&nbsp; It was one thing to be teased, it was another to be bullied and he felt the girl was a bully.&nbsp; It bothered him that Stephanie didn't care and he began to worry how far she intended to take this?&nbsp; It's not that he didn't enjoy it, but he enjoyed this as a game, not a lifestyle.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie stopped the car before a costume and uniform shop.&nbsp; They were at another strip mall several miles from their home.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why are we here?" Loren asked.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We need some stuff?" Stephanie responded.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What kind of stuff?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Stuff stuff."&nbsp; She handed Loren the black purse she'd bought at the shoe store.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's this?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's a purse."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't want a purse."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Every woman has a purse."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I'm not a woman."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie laughed.&nbsp; "You sure look like one."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do I put in it?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Makeup, your wallet, other useful items."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't have any of that with me."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know, I just want you to get used to carrying it.&nbsp; We'll get you stuff to put in it later."&nbsp; She reached behind the seat and pulled one of the shoe boxes from the bags they'd placed in the backseat.&nbsp; "Change into these."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because I said so."&nbsp; She stepped out of the car.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren took a deep breath and opened the box.&nbsp; These were the four-inch black open-toed pumps.&nbsp; He groaned.&nbsp; These were two inches higher than what he wore, plus they had the open toe.&nbsp; These were attention-grabbers.&nbsp; That bothered him because so far their entire strategy to help him pass had been to make sure he wasn't too noticeable.&nbsp; Hence, the subtle makeup, the bland mid-heeled shoes, and the non-descript pants.&nbsp; These shoes threw that out the window.&nbsp; But again, Stephanie left him no choice and she was already walking toward the store, so he slid these on and stepped out of the car.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --0--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Unlike the shoe store, the costume/uniform shop wasn't carpeted.&nbsp; Thus, Loren's heels echoed loudly throughout the store.&nbsp; When he walked in, a middle-aged Hispanic woman greeted him.&nbsp; A younger Hispanic woman, possibly her daughter, worked at the back of the store sewing custom orders.&nbsp; The older woman seemed nice, though Loren noticed she watched them suspiciously.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie moved along the wall as Loren followed.&nbsp; The shop was about forty feet wide and more than a hundred deep.&nbsp; The center of the store was filled with work uniforms of all sorts on circular racks and the walls were lined with costumes and more decorative uniforms hanging from individual racks which stuck straight out from the walls.&nbsp; Stephanie held out a large princess dress from a wall rack.&nbsp; "How would you like to be a fairy princess?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren rolled his eyes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She laughed.&nbsp; "All girls want to be princesses at some point, dear.&nbsp; I'm just offering you the chance.&nbsp; All we'd have to do is find you a nice ball."&nbsp; She moved on.&nbsp; "Look, cheerleader uniforms!&nbsp; You'd make a sexy cheerleader!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Just then, the Hispanic woman appeared behind them.&nbsp; She wore a ruffled purple blouse, a white pleated skirt that stopped just below her knees, and white slides with a minor wedge heel.&nbsp; "Can I help you?" she asked with a heavy accent.&nbsp; English clearly had not been her first language.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie smiled.&nbsp; "Yes.&nbsp; My husband needs some uniforms," she said flatly, nodding at Loren.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A quizzical look appeared on the woman's face, which slowly grew into a sneaky smile as she realized Stephanie meant Loren.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It took Loren about the same amount of time to realize his wife had just told the woman he was her husband.&nbsp; "Stephanie!" he squealed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She placed her hand on Loren's shoulder.&nbsp; "Oh, calm down, honey."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He pushed her hand away.&nbsp; "How could you?!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie ignored him and looked at the woman.&nbsp; "I'm sorry.&nbsp; My husband is a little nervous.&nbsp; He doesn't like people knowing."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman laughed.&nbsp; She looked Loren up and down several times.&nbsp; "I can understand why."&nbsp; Then she called out something in a foreign language to her daughter, who walked to the end of the aisle and looked toward Loren and Stephanie.&nbsp; She snickered.&nbsp; The woman looked Loren in the face, which was turning bright red.&nbsp; "It's ok, I've dealt with sissies before.&nbsp; You look good for a sissy though.&nbsp; Most don't."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Be polite dear and thank the nice lady," Stephanie said.&nbsp; She was thoroughly enjoying Loren's humiliation.&nbsp; In fact, it was turning her on something fierce.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren's jaw dropped.&nbsp; "I. . . uh. . . what?"&nbsp; Loren remained stunned.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why is he dressed like a woman?" the woman asked.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You'd have to ask him," Stephanie said with a slight whisper, implying this was a secret.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman nodded.&nbsp; "Do you like being a woman?" she asked Loren directly.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He glared at Stephanie.&nbsp; "No.&nbsp; I lost a bet."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You made a bet with your wife?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, I made a bet with my wife."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And you told her she could turn you into a woman if you lost?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Something like that.&nbsp; It was her idea," he said somewhat annoyed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, is that what it is now?" Stephanie said and rolled her eyes causing the woman to laugh.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No man would make that kind of bet unless he wanted to lose," the woman said dismissively.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I didn't plan to lose.&nbsp; I don't want to dress like this."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She laughed.&nbsp; "If my husband didn't want to wear a dress, then he wouldn't.&nbsp; You claim you don't want to, but you are.&nbsp; So you do."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I really don't.&nbsp; My wife just tricked me."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't sound very bright.&nbsp; You should know women are always smarter than men.&nbsp; And once a woman has you, you're trapped.&nbsp; She owns you now.&nbsp; You're her slave."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's funny you should say that," Stephanie said.&nbsp; "My husband needs several maid uniforms."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman scoffed at Loren.&nbsp; "See.&nbsp; I told you.&nbsp; You might as well forget ever being a man again. . . you're just a sissy toy now for your wife."&nbsp; She turned and walked toward an entire aisle of maid uniforms, everything from very basic hotel staff to highly elaborate costume uniforms.&nbsp; "What size is your husband?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie looked at Loren.&nbsp; "I'm not sure."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman looked him up and down and then called out to the young woman.&nbsp; The young woman grabbed a notepad and the woman went to get a tape measure.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you doing?!" Loren demanded when the woman stepped away.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh behave, dear.&nbsp; The worst that can happen is your ego gets bruised.&nbsp; Just be a good little girl and suck it up."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That is not the worst that can happen!&nbsp; She could tell everyone!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tell who exactly?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren looked around.&nbsp; He had no answer.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie continued.&nbsp; "Besides, did you really think you could fool her?&nbsp; She'll need to take your measurements.&nbsp; What do you think would have happened the moment she sees your erection?"&nbsp; Both looked down at the obvious lump straining at his pants despite their best efforts to wrap it tightly.&nbsp; "If you'd come in here pretending to be a girl, she probably would have called the cops on the pervert.&nbsp; Instead, now she's just going to tease the sissy."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren bit his lips.&nbsp; "I hadn't thought about that."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, you didn't, because your male ego is so damn fragile."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman found the tape measure and started back toward Loren and Stephanie with her daughter at her side.&nbsp; Stephanie moved in closer and aggressively whispered:&nbsp; "And another thing, Laura.&nbsp; For a man who claims to hate this and want no part of it, your dick has been hard as a rock for a week.&nbsp; So don't tell me you aren't enjoying this, and don't you dare throw another tantrum or I'll tell everyone about my sissy husband and his massive erections."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please don't!" he begged.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then you better get with the program.&nbsp; It's time you started playing the shamed, submissive sissy. . . got it?!&nbsp; Key word is submissive."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He bit his lip and nodded.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ok, we need some measurements," the woman said.&nbsp; She started to bend down but stopped.&nbsp; "Why don't we do this in the fitting room?"&nbsp; This sounded good to Loren as he assumed "the fitting room" would be an isolated, hidden room somewhere.&nbsp; It wasn't.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As they walked toward the back of the store, the woman and her daughter giggled.&nbsp; Each giggle caused Loren's penis to throb.&nbsp; Stephanie likewise couldn't have been more excited, and seeing her husband humiliated by these two women was proving to be an incredible turn on.&nbsp; She honestly never expected this level of excitement.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You walk really gracefully in heels," the daughter said without an accent.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren remained silent.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank the young lady, dear."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren cringed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't make me get upset, dear," Stephanie said.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren shivered.&nbsp; He stopped and turned to face the young girl who was about his size.&nbsp; She was in her early twenties and wore blue jeans, black flats and a bright yellow blouse.&nbsp; "Thank you."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Most of the girls at school aren't as graceful and you're wearing some serious heels there."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They're four inches," Stephanie said.&nbsp; "Laura wanted higher heels, but I refused.&nbsp; I want her to prove she can handle four inches all day before I let her go to five."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The woman and her daughter both burst out laughing.&nbsp; The older woman pointed her finger at Loren.&nbsp; "Your wife has your balls in her purse and you aren't getting them back."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They continued toward the back, where they came to an area where a raised platform stood.&nbsp; It was surrounded on three sides by mirrors.&nbsp; Loren was told to step onto the platform, which he did.&nbsp; To his horror, he could see the entire store clearly from the platform, and that meant that if anyone came into the store now, they would see him and his infinite reflections.&nbsp; He wanted to scream.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Remove your pants," the woman said.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you kidding?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do as you're told," Stephanie ordered.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You better listen to your wife," the woman said with a chuckle.&nbsp; "She might toss her purse away and get a new one, and then your balls are gone forever."&nbsp; She was clearly enjoying picking on Loren.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren reluctantly did as he was told.&nbsp; He unzipped the slacks and let them fall to the floor.&nbsp; As he stepped out of them, the daughter whisked his pants away.&nbsp; The woman immediately burst into laughter at the sight of his erect penis beneath the panties.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's not very ladylike!" the woman said.&nbsp; "One thing is for sure though, you like this a lot, don't you sissy?"&nbsp; She said something to the daughter, who smiled and then responded.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie shook her head.&nbsp; "He keeps telling me he hates this, but. . .," she reached out, grabbed the head of his erection and jiggled it back and forth, ". . . but apparently he likes it."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I do not!" Loren finally said.&nbsp; The strain of playing along was overcoming him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be so rude," the daughter said.&nbsp; "We could have called the cops on you, you perv, but we didn't."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The color instantly left Loren's face at the mention of the police.&nbsp; "I'm sorry!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You need to learn not to talk back to your wife," the woman said.&nbsp; She looked at Stephanie.&nbsp; "You should spank him."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He's a little old for that."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He's your maid.&nbsp; You can do what you want to him."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie smiled at the idea of Loren over her knee.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For the next few minutes, they took his measurements.&nbsp; Then, with Loren remaining on the platform, keeping one terrified eye on the front door, the two women went with Stephanie to get a variety of maid uniforms.&nbsp; The first was a relatively conservative black uniform with a knee-length skirt and a white cap.&nbsp; The effect was servile, if not erotic, though the high heels made him much sexier than the uniform otherwise would have been.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's hard to tell how it will fit," said the woman.&nbsp; "His thing is standing up and making it hard to see how the skirt will look."&nbsp; She pointed at Loren's erection.&nbsp; At this, the daughter said something in Spanish and the mother nodded her head.&nbsp; "We're going to fix that for you."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The daughter went to another part of the store and returned with both a corset and a matching pantygirdle.&nbsp; "These are shape makers.&nbsp; They hold everything in place.&nbsp; The two together should give your husband a very feminine shape."&nbsp; She handed them to Loren, who looked to step off the platform.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, no, just change right here," Stephanie said.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren's face turned even redder.&nbsp; Soon he stood on the platform, naked except for a padded bra and high heels.&nbsp; His erection stood out ram-rod straight for all the world to see.&nbsp; Stephanie didn't recall ever seeing it so large.&nbsp; But its moment in the sun ended soon enough as Loren yanked the ultra-tight pantygirdle up his legs.&nbsp; He stuffed his penis into the girdle and it effectively vanished.&nbsp; It was highly uncomfortable.&nbsp; Then the daughter tied the corset around his waist and yanked that in considerably.&nbsp; This was even more uncomfortable, but the effect was amazing.&nbsp; He actually had feminine curves and a smooth front.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wonderful!&nbsp; Now he can wear skirts in public!" Stephanie exclaimed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You should keep him in skirts all the time," the woman said.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm thinking about it!" Stephanie responded happily.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When they added the uniform, the change was dramatic.&nbsp; And after several more uniforms, Stephanie settled on three.&nbsp; She openly debated making him wear one of them home, but relented after sufficient pleading.&nbsp; But she wasn't finished.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to thank you and your daughter for your patience, and I'm very embarrassed Laura has been so rude to you, and especially your daughter.&nbsp; We're going to a costume party in about a week and Laura will need a costume."&nbsp; She looked at the daughter.&nbsp; "Since Laura has been so rotten to you, why don't I let you pick out the most humiliating costume you have.&nbsp; That way she can think about how she treated you during the party as everyone laughs at her."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The girl giggled.&nbsp; "Anything?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Anything."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The girl left to search the aisles.&nbsp; She eventually came back with three choices: a cheerleading outfit, a sexy policewoman's uniform, and a school girl uniform with a plaid skirt.&nbsp; Each was worse than the last, but the school girl uniform was the worst, especially with the heels.&nbsp; "This is the one for Laura," said the daughter.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good choice!" Stephanie said.&nbsp; "Thank the young lady, dear."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thanks," he said.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sincerely."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thank you," he said in a more sincere tone, though still not sufficiently submissive for Stephanie's taste.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "One more try, dear.&nbsp; And if you aren't sufficiently grateful, you're going to wear this plaid skirt as I march you from one end of the mall to the other."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren swallowed hard.&nbsp; He looked the girl in the eyes and almost cried.&nbsp; "Thank you for picking out this costume.&nbsp; I assure you, it is incredibly humiliating and I will regret how I treated you whenever I wear it.&nbsp; Thank you."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was silence.&nbsp; Then all three women burst out in laughter.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ok, sissy, put your pants back on and let's go."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --0--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren was so thoroughly humiliated by the time they got to the car that he didn't speak to Stephanie for ten full minutes.&nbsp; She kept chuckling.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You put on one hell of a show for those women!" she finally said.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm glad you're amused," he said angrily and folded his arms.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, don't pout."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You got into that too much."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie had to admit, she did get carried away.&nbsp; She just found his humiliation erotically intoxicating.&nbsp; But he was right, she had pushed things further than she should have.&nbsp; "I'm sorry, dear."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You do realize that they know now, right?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie shrugged her shoulders.&nbsp; "So what?&nbsp; Have you ever seen them before?&nbsp; Will you ever see them again?&nbsp; It's no big deal."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For you maybe."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She placed her hand on Loren's penis which was now trapped beneath the pantygirdle.&nbsp; With nothing to grab, she pulled her hand away.&nbsp; "I guess it did finally fall off, didn't it?" she said with a laugh.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ha ha, very funny."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both of their moods brightened again.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think, by the way, that from now on, you should wear the corset and the pantygirdle at all times," Stephanie said.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For one thing, because that's what I want.&nbsp; For another, the pantygirdle will prevent anyone from seeing your erection.&nbsp; It's a lot easier to pass as a woman when you aren't sporting wood beneath your skirt or slacks.&nbsp; Also, you have no choice because the clothes we just bought will only fit if you wear the corset and the pantygirdle."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren groaned.&nbsp; He didn't like the pantygirdle because it felt like it crushed his penis, but he realized he really had no choice for the reasons Stephanie had given.&nbsp; He changed the topic.&nbsp; "Speaking of the clothes, why did you buy all those uniforms?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I would have thought that was obvious."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, it's not."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's what happens next in the book.&nbsp; Candi makes 'Brandi' into her sexy maid and he prances around the house for weeks."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Weeks?!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Weeks," she said slyly.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm going to be sick."

Chapter 9: Laura's Mall Odyssey
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren was sweating bullets by the time Stephanie finally parked the car.&nbsp; He expected they would go home.&nbsp; They hadn't.&nbsp; Instead, they were parked outside Raycine's, a department store at one end of the Valleyview Mall.&nbsp; The mall was only five miles from their house and they shopped here occasionally.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't go in there."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You don't have any choice," she said with a smile.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I won't.&nbsp; I can't go in there."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Laura, no one is going to spot you."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why don't you buy what we need and I'll wait in the car?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because I need you to try things on," she said firmly, before adding with a mischievous smile, "Plus, how can I humiliate my sissy husband if she sits in the car?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren glared at his wife.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She patted him on the thigh.&nbsp; "Come on sissy, you're going in."&nbsp; She got out of the car and started walking toward the door.&nbsp; Loren took several deep breaths and got out of the car as well.&nbsp; Despite having been in two stores now, this wasn't getting any easier.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren had to jog a bit to catch up to Stephanie, which was a strange experience in the heels.&nbsp; Making this even more difficult, his pants kept falling down because they no longer fit because of the corset � the corset reduced his waist by at least three inches � so he needed to hold up his pants as he jogged to catch up to her.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When they reached the front door, Stephanie immediately turned right and made her way to the suits and dresses.&nbsp; Loren followed a few steps behind as she pulled dress after dress from the racks.&nbsp; Some she looked at and returned, a couple she held up to Loren and returned, and three or four she held up to Loren and then set aside.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There are certain dresses every girl needs.&nbsp; You've never really fit into my stuff and with your new shape, you definitely won't fit.&nbsp; So we need to get you some basics."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren nodded.&nbsp; It wasn't that he agreed, he just wanted to get this over with and get out of here before he was spotted.&nbsp; He didn't want to attract the attention of any of the salesgirls, nor did he want to prolong this by arguing.&nbsp; Also, his feet were getting sore from spending the day in the higher heels and his penis was getting sore as the girdle uncomfortably squeezed his erection and his testicles very tightly against his body.&nbsp; He wanted to get home and take this off.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ok, let's try 'em on!" Stephanie said.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What?&nbsp; Why?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You didn't think we were just going to buy these without seeing if they fit, did you?&nbsp; You need to try them on before we leave the store."&nbsp; Stephanie marched him over to the fitting rooms where a woman with short black curly hair was busy tagging clothes.&nbsp; She didn't even look up as they approached.&nbsp; Stephanie handed all of the clothes to Loren.&nbsp; "Try them on one at a time and then come out here and let me see them."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can't you come in with me?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can, sure, but I won't.&nbsp; I want you to come out here."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because it's fun watching you risk getting caught," she whispered.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren marched into the back and stripped down to his underwear.&nbsp; He hoped he wasn't on video camera.&nbsp; The first dress was a simple housedress like the one he had been wearing around the house.&nbsp; This one was forest green with a floral pattern with dozens of colors.&nbsp; When he slid the dress on, it felt tight to him and he wasn't sure it fit.&nbsp; Stephanie thought otherwise.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, it looks great."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But it's tight on my hips and my chest."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's because the girdle is padded to give you bigger hips and I made your breast bigger today.&nbsp; I got sick of having a husband with small breasts."&nbsp; She moved her fingers around his body, pulling the dress in various locations.&nbsp; "No, it fits well."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But--"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But you're more conscious of it, I know.&nbsp; The dress you were wearing fit you like a sack, this hugs your curves, now that you have them.&nbsp; That's how it's supposed to fit and that's how it's going to be from now on.&nbsp; Now go try the next one."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren removed the dress and grabbed the next one.&nbsp; This was more of a suit than a dress.&nbsp; It was a light-tan pencil skirt and short tan jacket.&nbsp; Stephanie had included a white blouse with the suit.&nbsp; He found it difficult to walk in the tight skirt, but again Stephanie said this fit correctly.&nbsp; Finally, came "the little black dress."&nbsp; The dress had a square neck and three-quarter length sleeves.&nbsp; It zipped up the back.&nbsp; Its hem fell just below Loren's knees and it had a kick pleat.&nbsp; The overall effect was elegant and sexy, especially with the heels and his new shape.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wow!" Stephanie said when he walked through the curtain.&nbsp; Even the woman at the computer looked up and smiled.&nbsp; Stephanie helped him zip up the dress.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I hate it!" he whispered.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You look great!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's tight across my chest and at my hips--"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I told you, you'll have to get use to that."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's so thin I feel like I'm practically naked."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's how guys like women to dress."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And it just makes me want to cry!" he said to both their surprises.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She patted him on the back.&nbsp; "That's ok, dear, girls can cry.&nbsp; So if you want to cry, go ahead and do it.&nbsp; I won't think any less of my sissy."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this comment, Loren felt his penis explode.&nbsp; Suddenly it was pumping semen into his panties and the girdle.&nbsp; Loren froze.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's wrong?" Stephanie asked, noting the scared look on his face.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think we need to stop."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Something just happened and everything got wet."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie raised an eyebrow.&nbsp; "You didn't!" she laughed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can we please leave?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie put her hands on her hips and exhaled.&nbsp; "You better not be lying to me!"&nbsp; He shook his head.&nbsp; She stared at him for a few seconds. "Fine."&nbsp; She walked over to the woman at the register.&nbsp; "My friend wants to wear this dress while we go for lunch, can she wear it out of the store if we buy it now?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem, I'll just have to remove the tag first."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The women used an electronic device to remove the tag as Stephanie placed more clothes on the counter.&nbsp; "He'll take these too."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren turned white as a sheet.&nbsp; Stephanie had referred to him as "he."&nbsp; His eyes shot up at the black-haired woman.&nbsp; She didn't seem to notice.&nbsp; He took a deep breath as the woman finished processing the purchase and placed everything in two bags, including the black-plaid pants and the pinkish-red sweater he wore into the store.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As they moved away from the counter, Stephanie whispered to Loren:&nbsp; "That slipped, I'm sorry.&nbsp; At least she didn't notice, so no harm no foul."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Except the heart attack you gave me!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't be so melodramatic."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With both Loren and Stephanie carrying bags, Loren turned toward the door to leave, but Stephanie started in the other direction � toward the mall.&nbsp; Loren caught up to her and put his hand on her arm once they were out of hearing range of the clerk.&nbsp; "You said we were leaving after I tried them on!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I said we would 'leave the store,' I didn't say we were going home."&nbsp; She started toward the mall again, but he again grabbed her arm.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't do this," he whisper-yelled at her.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course you can."&nbsp; She put her hands on her hips and spoke in a normal voice which made Loren fear others could hear her.&nbsp; "You've been in three stores now and no one spotted you unless you told them."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That girl in the shoe store knew!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe she did.&nbsp; But nothing came of it?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She blackmailed me!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie raised her voice.&nbsp; "No one blackmailed you.&nbsp; You bought all those extra shoes because you wanted them."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren looked around nervously.&nbsp; "Keep your voice down!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Shoes, shoes, shoes!&nbsp; My husband bought high-heeled shoes because he loves them!" she said even louder.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His face twisted.&nbsp; "Please, stop!" he begged.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie exhaled loudly.&nbsp; "You need to be taught a lesson, Laura.&nbsp; You need to be taught that I'm in charge now, whether you like it or not, and I want to play this game to the end.&nbsp; Now, I know you do as well, even if you won't admit it, so stop fighting me and let's just have some fun with this."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren looked around nervously.&nbsp; He wasn't sure if people could hear them or not and it made him nervous that people might have overheard what Stephanie just said.&nbsp; He decided it was best to just let Stephanie have her way on this.&nbsp; He nodded his head.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, don't just nod at me.&nbsp; You need to get this through your head.&nbsp; I'm in charge.&nbsp; Me boss, you not.&nbsp; You do anything I tell you.&nbsp; Understand."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He nodded again.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Say it."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, dear, I learned my lesson."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, say it.&nbsp; Tell me you understand our new relationship.&nbsp; Tell me you are ready to be my submissive little sissy or we can end this right now."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fine, yes," he said nervously, still looking around to see if people were listening.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She put her hands on her hips.&nbsp; "High heels!&nbsp; My husband loves high heels!" she said loudly.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm sorry!&nbsp; I'm sorry," he said.&nbsp; "You're the boss.&nbsp; You're in charge.&nbsp; You make all the decisions."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And I will do anything you say."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Say it."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He bit his tongue.&nbsp; "I'll be your submissive little sissy."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She squinted her eyes at him.&nbsp; "Prove it!&nbsp; Call me, 'Miss Stephanie.'"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You heard me."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I. . . uh--"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She pursed her lips.&nbsp; "This is only going to keep getting worse until you finally surrender to me.&nbsp; If you push me, I'll take away your pantygirdle and make you walk up and down this mall, buying something from every single store while you try to hide your stiffy."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren cringed.&nbsp; "I'm sorry.&nbsp; I'll do whatever you ask, Miss Stephanie."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie laughed.&nbsp; "Good girl."&nbsp; She patted him on the rear.&nbsp; "Was that really so difficult?" she asked rhetorically.&nbsp; "Now come with me," she said, leading him toward the mall again.&nbsp; "You realize that you're making this all so much harder than it needs to be, right?&nbsp; We both know you want this and if you would just stop fighting it at every turn. . . kick back, enjoy it, then we could have so much more fun!&nbsp; Live a little.&nbsp; Don't be so afraid.&nbsp; Enjoy the thrills."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren didn't speak.&nbsp; She was probably right, but she was also enjoying her power too much in Loren's opinion.&nbsp; As he told himself earlier, he enjoyed this as a game, he didn't want it to become a lifestyle, and he certainly didn't want to be bossed around by Stephanie. . . or did he?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie marched Loren to the other end of the mall where the food court was.&nbsp; By the time they reached that part of the mall, Stephanie's feet were a little sore as she didn't often wear four-inch heels and she never wore them when she walked this much.&nbsp; Loren's feet and calves, by comparison, were screaming in pain.&nbsp; High heels were new to him and wearing them for a ten minute walk through a mall was murder on his feet.&nbsp; He needed a lot more practice before he could do this regularly.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie intended that they would go to the food court and enjoy a small lunch.&nbsp; Then she wanted to take Loren shopping at a couple lingerie stores.&nbsp; But as they neared the food court she caught a glimpse of Loren in a mirror and saw a young store clerk give Loren a double-take.&nbsp; She suddenly realized that despite his new curves, Loren looked less passable in the black dress than he had in the pants.&nbsp; This was because, in the pants, he was less conspicuous.&nbsp; No one would question a slightly mannish woman in pants, a sweater and plain shoes.&nbsp; But in the black dress, he was very conspicuous, and his short albeit effeminate hair looked out of place.&nbsp; Moreover, the light makeup he wore, which fit the pants and sweater perfectly, seemed a little too understated for the dress and again called into question whether something was "off" with the image.&nbsp; Fortunately for Loren, the mall was relatively empty, being only eleven in the morning on a Monday.&nbsp; Nevertheless, Stephanie realized they needed to eat and run before the lunch crowd arrived.&nbsp; And if she did take him out in this dress again, he would need a wig. . . or his hair would need to grow out first.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren sat down in the small metal chair.&nbsp; He wasn't hungry.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie sat across from him, watching her effeminate husband with his arms tightly folded beneath his chest and his legs crossed as she had taught him � even more so in fact because the girdle kept his penis out of the way � swinging his leg nervously.&nbsp; If his shoe had been dangling, she would have laughed at the image of femininity.&nbsp; He was close to passing, very close.&nbsp; But if she was truly going to be able to take him out in public, then he would need more, and some of it would be permanent.&nbsp; Could she do that to her husband?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She bit her lip.&nbsp; "All right dear, I'm putting you on the spot."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren raised an eyebrow.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You've been whining and complaining all morning, but I think you're enjoying this.&nbsp; And I don't like feeling like the bad guy having to push you along when I know you want to go there.&nbsp; So it's time to make a decision.&nbsp; I want a one word answer right now."&nbsp; She tapped the table with her red nail.&nbsp; "Do we continue on my terms or do I take all the girl stuff away and we pretend this never happened."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren looked like he'd been slapped.&nbsp; Part of him desperately wanted to continue.&nbsp; He was thrilled at everything that had happened to him, as evidenced by his constant erections � in fact, he was already erect again despite ejaculating only a few minutes before.&nbsp; But he disliked the fear and he didn't want something to happen which would ruin his reputation forever even after this game stopped, because the game had to stop at some point, right?&nbsp; Also, he told himself, he disliked the humiliation and feeling powerless. . . or did he?&nbsp; The moment he told himself that, he actually began to doubt that was true.&nbsp; In fact, if he was being honest with himself, everything about this was turning him on and he was really beginning to like the idea of being submissive to Stephanie.&nbsp; He just wasn't sure he could admit that to himself yet.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He bit his lip and shrugged his shoulders.&nbsp; "It's like this--"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie shook her head.&nbsp; "No, there's no explaining.&nbsp; Either yes or no."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He gritted his teeth.&nbsp; How could he tell his wife he wanted to keep playing this game?&nbsp; What did that make him?&nbsp; What kind of man wants his wife to feminize him?&nbsp; What kind of man gets thrills by being humiliated?&nbsp; What kind of man was he really?&nbsp; He just didn't know.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie tapped the table.&nbsp; "Yes or no, five seconds."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He swallowed hard.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Five. . . four. . . three. . . two--"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie smiled.&nbsp; "I thought so."&nbsp; She felt a warm, tingly moment of triumph wash over her.&nbsp; She was enjoying this as much as Loren and, like him, was in a constant state of arousal.&nbsp; But he'd put up a lot of resistance earlier and she didn't want to continue if he really did want to stop.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But--" he started.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, no 'but'.&nbsp; I told you my terms and that's that.&nbsp; Now let's go."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I thought we were getting something to eat?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, we need to get Cinderella home before the lunch crowd shows up and recognizes she's just a pumpkin."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren looked confused.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm saying, we need to leave before people start showing up and they spot you.&nbsp; You aren't as convincing as before."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The walk back through the mall was torture.&nbsp; Not only did Loren's feet hurt and his calves burn, but his fear of discovery was through the roof.&nbsp; Up to now, Stephanie's assurance that he could pass gave him comfort.&nbsp; He felt out of place and awkward and vulnerable, but she assured him no one could tell.&nbsp; And that seemed to be true as no one confronted him openly.&nbsp; Plus, despite wearing feminine clothes, he really hadn't left his comfort zone because he basically wore pants and a sweater.&nbsp; Sure, the heels and the makeup stood out, but somehow he still felt "normal."&nbsp; Not to mention that Stephanie had been right in that people just didn't notice a woman with a butch haircut wearing pants and a basic sweater.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But the skimpy black dress was well outside his comfort zone and people were noticing.&nbsp; For one thing, this material barely covered parts of his body which were normally well hidden.&nbsp; Also, his padded breasts and hips jiggled with the shock of his heels striking the floor because the dress gave him no support.&nbsp; And of course, the heels were unusual for him too, especially wearing heels this high and being out in public.&nbsp; The heels also called to people.&nbsp; Click click click.&nbsp; And when they heard him approach they looked up.&nbsp; In fact, every head turned as he approached, and they didn't just look up and move on, they drank in his image.&nbsp; The dress, the heels, they drew in the eyes.&nbsp; Each time it was the same, they started with his heels, and then their eyes drifted up to the gorgeous, tight, short dress.&nbsp; Then their eyes continued upward to the mannish shoulders, the short, bland hair, and the limited makeup.&nbsp; That's when the puzzled looks started to appear.&nbsp; And Loren knew, because Stephanie had told him, that every one of those puzzled looks was recognition.&nbsp; He was gripped by fear. . . step by terrifying step.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren almost cried when he slid into the safety of the passenger seat of the car.&nbsp; Stephanie hugged him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Chapter 10: Private Fashion Show
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie pulled into the garage.&nbsp; She considered stopping in the driveway, but she wasn't ready to answer the neighbors' questions just yet.&nbsp; Once they were safely inside and all the bags brought to the living room, Stephanie insisted on a fashion show.&nbsp; Item by item, she made Loren put on everything they had bought and made him describe each item to her as he modeled them.&nbsp; She wanted him to get accustomed to speaking about feminine clothing as well as wearing it.&nbsp; She also used the opportunity to correct his masculine movements.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She insisted Loren begin with the first maid's dress.&nbsp; This was a short black dress with puffy sleeves and a full skirt with white crinoline underneath.&nbsp; The dress itself barely reached the middle of his thighs.&nbsp; In addition to the black dress, a white lace choker went around his neck, a white lace cap on his head, and a short, white apron was tied over the skirt, ending in a bow just above his rear.&nbsp; Black stockings were held up by a black garter belt.&nbsp; On his feet, Loren wore the black open-toed pumps he wore in the mall.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie hooted and whistled.&nbsp; She also made him spin around slowly and then curtsey.&nbsp; He didn't know how to curtsey at first, so she had to show him and then made him repeated it several times until she was satisfied.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next came a beautiful checked pink and white gingham maid uniform with a satin Peter Pan collar, puffy short sleeves hemmed in satin, a mid-thigh skirt trimmed with lace, and again with crinoline.&nbsp; A short white pinafore apron went over the dress.&nbsp; This time Loren wore nude stockings and a pink garter belt which matched the dress.&nbsp; On his feet, he wore the pink and white wedge sandals Stephanie told him to buy.&nbsp; These had a beige stacked wedge heel a little over four inches high, with a half-inch platform.&nbsp; Loren found them surprisingly comfortable.&nbsp; Again, Stephanie required a curtsey.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The third dress was a less decorative red version of the first maid dress.&nbsp; Loren wore the tan stockings and the black slingbacks.&nbsp; Next came the forest green housedress, again with the black slingbacks.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Whoa!&nbsp; Hold it!" Stephanie said when he stepped into the living room in the green dress.&nbsp; "You already wore those shoes.&nbsp; I want to see something new, girl.&nbsp; Think of all the shoes you bought today!"&nbsp; Then she pointed at his crotch.&nbsp; "Also, your little guy is ruining the effect of the dress.&nbsp; What happened to the pantygirdle?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It was really uncomfortable, so I took it off," he said.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie shook her head.&nbsp; "Oh no you don't!&nbsp; If you want to take that off, you ask permission."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you serious?!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course I'm serious.&nbsp; From now on, you wear exactly what I tell you and nothing else."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But it's really uncomfortable."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Discomfort is the price of fashion."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But it's crushing my balls."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's ok, you don't need them anymore," she said with a smirk.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But--"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't test me, sissy," she said firmly, "or you'll be mowing the lawn in the pink uniform tonight."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren cringed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now go change like I told you."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He returned to the bedroom to change.&nbsp; Fortunately, they had bought several of the pantygirdles so he didn't need to wear the dirty one.&nbsp; He slid the girdle up his legs and again trapped his sore penis.&nbsp; It felt like his testicles were being crushed.&nbsp; He tried to shift his penis around to see if he could find a more comfortable way to wear the girdle, but it didn't work.&nbsp; He just had to grin and bear it.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, he pulled the pantyhose back up his legs and sat down to choose a new pair of shoes.&nbsp; The dress was forest green and had a lot of color in the floral pattern, but none of the shoes he bought seemed to match.&nbsp; He finally decided on the beige slingbacks with the peep toe.&nbsp; They didn't match, but they were neutral and they worked.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie wasn't thrilled with the choice, but accepted it, promising to take Loren shoe shopping again to fill in his wardrobe.&nbsp; "I guess we need to get you more shoes already?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next came the tan skirt suit.&nbsp; Since he'd already worn the beige slingbacks, this suit now posed a problem.&nbsp; He considered the white slingbacks, but they didn't seem right.&nbsp; Then he remembered the two boxes he never opened.&nbsp; He had no idea what these shoes were as the girl simply added them to his pile without ever showing him.&nbsp; Perhaps they contained something that would match the skirt?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He grabbed both boxes.&nbsp; The first pair would never work.&nbsp; They were five-inch, open-toed clogs with a two-inch platform.&nbsp; The shoe itself had a bright flowery pattern while the heel was made of a dark wood.&nbsp; He wasn't sure what they would match?&nbsp; The other pair, however, were perfect.&nbsp; They were taupe sandals with delicate leather straps that crossed the whole way up the foot except in the middle of the foot where they fed into an infinite symbol.&nbsp; These were beautiful shoes, but the heels were for all practical purposes almost an inch taller than anything he normally wore, being five and a half-inch heels with a half-inch platform.&nbsp; They were high enough, in fact, to be intimidating.&nbsp; But they did match the suit, so he slid his feet into them.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With the first step, Loren immediately noticed the pressure on his toes and calves was dramatically increased.&nbsp; It was amazing what one little extra inch could do.&nbsp; He did not want to wear these shoes often, if at all.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren took a few moments to practice before walking out to Stephanie.&nbsp; She was ecstatic when he saw the shoes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh my God, those are sexy!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He smiled, even as he struggled to walk in the shoes, because the happier she was, the more pleasant this whole experience was.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie raised her eyebrow.&nbsp; "The only thing is I'm surprised you bought anything that high.&nbsp; You already struggle with four-inch heels and few women even wear anything that high, so I'm surprised.&nbsp; I guess you were inspired?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren bit his lip but didn't speak.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie noticed.&nbsp; "Go ahead, spit it out."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "This is what I was talking about with the girl at the store.&nbsp; This was her blackmailing me."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie rolled her eyes.&nbsp; "This again?&nbsp; Just admit it, Laura, you like being a girl."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm serious."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh stop."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren folded his arms.&nbsp; He debated what he should say or not.&nbsp; Stephanie saw this and rolled her hand toward him as if to say, "go on."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look, Stephanie.&nbsp; She knew what I was.&nbsp; I could see it in her eyes.&nbsp; And that's why she was able to push all these shoes on me.&nbsp; I didn't pick anything, she told me what to buy."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A condescending frown crossed Stephanie's face.&nbsp; "Really?&nbsp; And what exactly did she tell you?&nbsp; Buy these shoes or I'm going to tell your wife?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No," he admitted.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did she ever tell you, 'you must buy these' or else?&nbsp; Was there ever a threat of any kind?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So how exactly did she force you do to anything?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You want the truth?!&nbsp; She scared me!&nbsp; I felt weak and I felt vulnerable and I felt exposed.&nbsp; And when she starting handing me shoes and telling me to buy them, I couldn't stand up to her.&nbsp; And these shoes," he said, pointing at his feet, "she added these to the pile without ever showing me what they were.&nbsp; And you know what?&nbsp; I was too intimidated to tell her no."&nbsp; Loren suddenly felt a complete release of his anxiety regarding the trip to the shoe store.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie was stunned.&nbsp; "Wow."&nbsp; She walked over and hugged him.&nbsp; "Loren, one of the things I've been trying to prove to you all day is that you have nothing to fear.&nbsp; The world won't end just because someone sees you in a dress.&nbsp; I love you and I will keep loving you no matter what."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren bit his lip.&nbsp; "You know, now that I've said that out loud. . . it does sound kind of stupid in hindsight."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie laughed.&nbsp; "Glad to hear it."&nbsp; She turned her attention to his new shoes.&nbsp; She circled around Loren, admiring them.&nbsp; "They are incredibly sexy, but I'm not sure how practical they will be for day-to-day use."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can barely stand in them, that's for sure."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can see that.&nbsp; I guess we'll have to see if you get used to them.&nbsp; In the meantime, I suggest you stick with the brown loafers or the beige pumps for this suit.&nbsp; Go change."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Will do," Loren said gladly � his toes felt positively crushed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before he could leave, however, Stephanie stopped him.&nbsp; "But now we have a problem, don't we?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you mean?" Loren asked.&nbsp; He stopped and turned to face her.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie sat down on the couch and folded her arms.&nbsp; "By my count, you've only got the little black dress left, but apparently you got really excited and bought four more pairs of shoes I haven't seen yet.&nbsp; So what are we going to do?&nbsp; How are we going to finish this fashion show?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I could bring them out and you could choose?" he said hopefully.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have a better idea," she said with a wicked grin.&nbsp; "Why don't you wear them out, one at a time, in the order you think I'll find them to be sexist, from least to most sexy.&nbsp; Consider this a test to see how well you know your wife!&nbsp; I'll be the judge and if you wear them in the right order, then you'll get a reward.&nbsp; If not, then you'll get punished."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren frowned.&nbsp; "I have to get all four in the right order of how sexy you think they are?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yep.&nbsp; And I'm going to punish you too for each one in the wrong order, so you better be right each time."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What kind of punishment?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's up to me, now go change."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren returned to the bedroom and stripped off the tan suit.&nbsp; He slid on the black dress which had caused him so much terror walking through the mall.&nbsp; He placed the four remaining shoe boxes on the bed next to him and shuffled them around until he thought he got them in the right order.&nbsp; He slipped into the first pair.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie cheered the moment he entered the living room.&nbsp; "Those are sexy!&nbsp; I don't know girlfriend, I think you made a mistake picking those first!"&nbsp; She laughed.&nbsp; She leaned forward on the couch and hugged her knees.&nbsp; "So tell me about those shoes!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren knew this was coming, so he read the box before leaving the bedroom.&nbsp; "They're patent leather, burgundy-red Mary Janes with a four-inch stacked black heel with a slight platform.&nbsp; They have a double strap across the instep."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie whistled again.&nbsp; "Those are seriously going to be hard to beat."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few moments later, Loren was back.&nbsp; This time he wore black t-strap sandals with crisscross straps over the vamp.&nbsp; They had a one-inch platform and a four-inch heel.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh my God!&nbsp; Those are fantastic!&nbsp; We need to get you a boyfriend so you can wear those on a date!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren blushed.&nbsp; "Uh. . . no."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie laughed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Next, Loren appeared in the flower clogs.&nbsp; "Wow, let me see those."&nbsp; Stephanie made him slide out of one and show it to her.&nbsp; She slid her own foot into the shoe.&nbsp; "I am so borrowing these. . . but I have to give you a demerit.&nbsp; These aren't as sexy as the prior two.&nbsp; So remind me later that I need to punish you."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How are you going to punish me?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie laughed.&nbsp; "As if I would tell you now when I can make you worry about it.&nbsp; Just rest assured, it will be really embarrassing and it will happen at the worst possible time.&nbsp; Now go get the last ones, I want to make some lunch. . . or actually, I want my new maid to make me lunch."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren returned to the bedroom and grabbed the final shoes.&nbsp; He truly hated these.&nbsp; These were the cherry-red mules with a five-inch thin stiletto heel with no platform.&nbsp; They had no straps and no support and an open toe.&nbsp; Walking in these was murder in the store and they made him feel like a cheap hooker.&nbsp; He expect no different now.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie's jaw dropped and she covered her mouth with her hands.&nbsp; Then she started giggling.&nbsp; "Oh my God!&nbsp; If you ever disobey me, I swear I will make you march from one end of the mall to the other in those!"&nbsp; She rose.&nbsp; "Let me try those!"&nbsp; Loren gladly slid out of the shoes and Stephanie slipped into them.&nbsp; "Wow!&nbsp; These are hooker shoes!"&nbsp; She smiled broadly.&nbsp; "You better do everything I tell you from now on because I just got the perfect torture device!"&nbsp; Stephanie kicked off the shoes and insisted Loren put them back on his feet.&nbsp; Suddenly she snapped her fingers.&nbsp; "We forgot one!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "One what?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The school girl costume!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren cringed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No excuses.&nbsp; Go put that on and wear these shoes."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do I have to?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's my punishment, unless you'd rather have me spank you like the woman at the costume shop suggested."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren folded his arms.&nbsp; "You're not seriously thinking about spanking me, are you?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie giggled.&nbsp; The thought of Loren bent over her lap was a hilarious image in her mind, but she didn't particularly like the idea of striking her husband, even in jest.&nbsp; "Out of character for a moment, dear. . . if you want me to, I will, because I'm willing to do whatever excites you.&nbsp; But I don't personally want to do that."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren smiled.&nbsp; "I and my rear end thank you.&nbsp; I'll go put on the school girl costume, Miss Stephanie!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few minutes later, Loren was back in the living room as Stephanie circled him giggling uncontrollably.&nbsp; Loren couldn't believe how ridiculous he felt in that short plaid skirt, the overly tight short white dress shirt which exposed his bellybutton, the knee socks and the red slides.&nbsp; Even the maid's costumes weren't this sissy-ish.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie finally stopped giggling.&nbsp; "Let's get some lunch, sissy girl.&nbsp; Then I'll show you how to be a proper servant."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --0--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After lunch, Loren found himself standing before his wife in the pink and white checked gingham maid uniform.&nbsp; He was relieved to be out of the school girl costume.&nbsp; Also, he wore the pink and white wedge-heeled sandals, for which he was grateful as they were surprisingly comfortable, especially compared to the mules.&nbsp; And after his walk through the mall, it was a relief to wear more comfortable and easier-to-walk-in shoes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have a list of duties you need to perform every day until I say otherwise."&nbsp; She handed Loren a paper on which she'd written a variety of duties, including everything from vacuuming to sweeping the kitchen to dusting the house to cooking dinner.&nbsp; It was a lot of work.&nbsp; "And at night, you can paint my nails."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't do all this?&nbsp; When am I going to get a chance to write?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Write what?&nbsp; You don't even know what you're going to write about yet."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I was going to write another thriller?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie raised an eyebrow, put her hands on her hips, and balanced her right foot on the heel of her shoe.&nbsp; She looked him up and down.&nbsp; "Somehow, I don't think the thriller boys are going to want you in their club unless you're serving them drinks."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ha ha."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Trust me dear, your macho audiences aren't going to react well to a man in panties.&nbsp; And in any event, at the moment, your only focus should be on my wishes, and my wishes are that you get started on your chores.&nbsp; I'm going to sit here and watch you dust.&nbsp; Make sure you shake your sexy little tush the whole time."&nbsp; She sat down on the couch and smiled.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren picked up the duster and made his way around the room, wiping everything clean.&nbsp; Even in the heels, he needed to stand on tiptoe to reach the upper shelves.&nbsp; This caused Stephanie to giggle.&nbsp; At other times, he needed to crouch down, which again caused her to giggle at his exposed panties.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A girl could get use to this!" she said as she watched him strain to reach a high shelf.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren's face turned red.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie shook her head.&nbsp; "When I speak to my maid, I expect a nice, servile response, Laura."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren turned toward his wife.&nbsp; "Sorry."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not good enough, try again and this time add a curtsey."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren took a deep breath.&nbsp; Despite agreeing to continue, his humiliation at being under his wife's thumb hadn't lessened one bit and he wasn't sure if he really enjoyed that or not.&nbsp; To the extent this was just a game and he could take off the clothes and go back to being Loren, he enjoyed it.&nbsp; To the extent, Stephanie really was seizing this power on a permanent basis, he felt uneasy.&nbsp; Could he deal with that?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now!" Stephanie ordered.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren curtseyed as she had shown him earlier and said, "Thank you, Miss Stephanie."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't worry, dear, I only expect that when you're dressed as my maid."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren rolled his eyes, but his erection sent a different message.&nbsp; He returned to his work.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few minutes later, Stephanie snapped her fingers.&nbsp; "You know what's missing?&nbsp; I can't tell if you're excite enough or not.&nbsp; Take off the pantygirdle."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren was thankful for this as the girdle had been crushing his penis, so he happily unhooked the garterbelt he wore with this uniform and lowered the girdle.&nbsp; His penis immediately sprung to attention beneath the crinoline, which rested on top of his erection.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie smiled.&nbsp; She rose from her seat, walked over to Loren and squeezed his penis.&nbsp; "Good girl.&nbsp; You have no idea how happy it makes me to know your weakness."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What weakness?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That you're such a sissy.&nbsp; I had no idea before, but now that I do, things are going to change around here in ways that both you and I will enjoy."&nbsp; She kissed him on the cheek.&nbsp; Then, without letting go of Loren's erection, she picked up the phone and hit the speed dial for Kathleen.&nbsp; When Kathleen answered, Stephanie gave Loren a hard squeeze and let go, before motioning him to keep dusting.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Stephie, we had a great time at the party," Kathleen said.&nbsp; "I hope I didn't make Loren too uncomfortable?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, he's a good sport," Stephanie said.&nbsp; "Besides, it's always good to teach men their proper place."&nbsp; She laughed and snapped her finger at Loren to get his attention.&nbsp; When he turned, she motion him to raise his skirt so she could see his penis.&nbsp; She covered the phone.&nbsp; "Just stand there looking pretty while I talk to Kathleen."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So true," Kathleen said with a laugh.&nbsp; "But I know some men can get pretty touchy about those things. . . especially when, you know."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie raised an eyebrow.&nbsp; "No?&nbsp; What?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When it hits a little close to home," she said cautiously.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there something I should know about Peter?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kathleen laughed.&nbsp; "God no!&nbsp; He's a Neanderthal.&nbsp; I'm talking about Loren."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Loren?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was a pause as Kathleen clearly felt she had stepped over the line.&nbsp; "I'm sorry," she said even more cautiously.&nbsp; "I don't mean that Loren does or anything.&nbsp; I'm not saying he's a sissy, I'm just saying I didn't want to offend him if he does."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie laughed.&nbsp; "Could you imagine Loren dressing up in women's clothes?"&nbsp; She winked at Loren, whose face turned red and his knees began to shake.&nbsp; He only heard half the conversation and he had no idea what was going on, but he didn't like the sound of it.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'll bet he'd be lovely," Kathleen said.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "He might at that," Stephanie agreed.&nbsp; "He's got some very feminine features for a man.&nbsp; What do you see him wearing?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you mean?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I mean, assume he does like women's clothes, what could you picture him wearing?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have a dirty mind, Stephie!" Kathleen giggled.&nbsp; "But since you asked. . . I could totally see him in a black sequin strapless dress with a long train and a side slit.&nbsp; I'll bet he has beautiful legs, especially if he wore some really high-heeled sandals."&nbsp; She paused.&nbsp; "No, actually, he'd probably look better in a tight leather mini with a low-cut white blouse.&nbsp; What about you?&nbsp; How would you dress him?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie smirked.&nbsp; "I've always wanted to see him in one of those French maid outfits.&nbsp; He could flutter around the house and serve me drinks as I play Queen of the House."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both women giggled and Loren felt his erection pounding.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So tell me, Stephie.&nbsp; IS there something I should know?" Kathleen asked.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie paused.&nbsp; "Oops, Loren just stepped through the door, I need to go."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's he wearing?" Kathleen asked coyly.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'll tell you tomorrow," she said with a laugh.&nbsp; "Are we still on for lunch."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Absolutely!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Stephanie hung up the phone, she looked at Loren who still stood before her holding up his skirt to expose his throbbing erection.&nbsp; "How do you feel about Kathleen coming over for lunch?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now?!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, not today, but in a couple days."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Will I be there?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Of course!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How will I be dressed?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie rose.&nbsp; She pecked him on the cheek.&nbsp; "Lower your skirt and get back to work, sissy."











The Writer's Secret

Chapter 11: Pierced
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Over the next two days, Loren got used to life as a sexy maid to a woman of whim.&nbsp; Stephanie got used to having a servant.&nbsp; In fact, she was enjoying this more than ever.&nbsp; Anything she wanted, Loren did without question.&nbsp; Any time she wanted to feel powerful, she gave him orders she knew he wouldn't want to do or she made him risk being exposed to the neighbors.&nbsp; It felt incredible having that much power over her husband.&nbsp; And best of all, he seemed to love it as much as she did.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; On the third day, she decided it was time for the next step in his feminization.&nbsp; At first, she wasn't sure she wanted to take this step.&nbsp; It seemed a little permanent.&nbsp; And even though Loren had technically given her the power to do whatever she wanted to him, she still wasn't sure how far she should push things.&nbsp; But then, she was also too excited to stop.&nbsp; Indeed, the thrill of further feminizing Loren was just too much to resist and she actually found herself fingering herself as she considered it.&nbsp; So it was time to take Loren back to the mall.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie walked into the kitchen where Loren was putting away the dishes.&nbsp; She wore gray slacks, black flats, and a creamy-white sweater.&nbsp; She twirled the car keys in her hand.&nbsp; Loren wore the black maid's uniform with the red mules.&nbsp; These didn't normally go with the uniform, but he hadn't been properly "servile" at breakfast, so she made him wear the mules as punishment because she knew they were incredibly uncomfortable for him.&nbsp; Plus, she loved the way he tottered around on them.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He curtseyed when she entered the room.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go to the bedroom and change your clothes.&nbsp; I've laid everything out for you.&nbsp; Then meet me in the living room."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren made his way to the bedroom.&nbsp; On the bed, Loren found the tan suit and jacket, the white blouse, tan pantyhose, and a pair of Stephanie's taupe pumps with a one inch, square heel.&nbsp; He changed into the outfit and went to meet her.&nbsp; Overall, the effect was surprisingly feminine, especially as Stephanie had continued to "clean up" his eyebrows into a delicate arch and had curled his hair even more.&nbsp; All in all, he looked like a woman, except for one glaring defect.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You might want to put on some panties," Stephanie said.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There weren't any on the bed."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie started to reprimand him for not thinking, but then it struck her this was a sign of her growing power.&nbsp; She had forgotten to include panties, so he went without.&nbsp; He didn't try to add any and he didn't question her, he just went without.&nbsp; She smiled.&nbsp; "Go put on your girdle."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren winced.&nbsp; He hated wearing the girdle because it crushed his testicles and squeezed his penis uncomfortably against his body.&nbsp; "Do I have to?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie laughed.&nbsp; "You tell me, Loren?"&nbsp; She rubbed his erection, which made his skirt stand straight out.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He looked down at the bulge in his skirt.&nbsp; "Yeah, I guess so."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Loren got into the car, he had no idea they were headed back to the mall, but he soon realized that was their destination.&nbsp; After his terrifying and humiliating walk back through the mall after Stephanie told him that people could spot him because he looked like a man, he had no desire to ever go back.&nbsp; But Stephanie gave him no choice, and she did assure him he could pass this time because he looked "ordinary."&nbsp; In other words, in the conservative tan suit and the low-heeled beige pumps, few people would give him a second look and what they would see with the first impression would be feminine enough not to arouse suspicions.&nbsp; Hence, his fears were allayed.&nbsp; And as they walked through the mall and people seemed to pass them by without incident, he even began to gain confidence that no one would spot him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As before, they needed to walk through almost the entire mall to reach their destination.&nbsp; Stephanie did this intentionally because she wanted Loren to spend as much time as possible in public to get used to it.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There it is," Stephanie said, pointing toward a small booth where a teenage girl was selling earrings.&nbsp; The booth was about twenty feet away and Loren almost collapsed when he realized what Stephanie had in mind.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't do this!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure you can!&nbsp; Teenage girls do it all the time, honey.&nbsp; Even boys do it now."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No!&nbsp; I won't do it.&nbsp; I don't want anything permanent.&nbsp; Getting my ears pierced is permanent."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I gave you my conditions and you agreed.&nbsp; Are you trying to back out now?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I might!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She raised an eyebrow and smirked at him.&nbsp; "Really?!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, really," he said.&nbsp; Traces of panic could be heard in his voice.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You're ready to give up all this fun?&nbsp; Ready to give up the heels and the skirts?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren nodded his head.&nbsp; He was breathing hard.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie scowled.&nbsp; "So you're fine being a sissy, just so long as we don't pierce your ears, is that it?" she said loudly enough that the girl at the booth looked their way.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please keep your voice down!" he whispered.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie placed her hands on her hips.&nbsp; "Why?&nbsp; You don't want me telling the world my husband is a sissy?!" she said even louder.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Stop it!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't you tell me what to do!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't do this, please."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Loren, you've spent the past week prancing around the house like a fairy princess in women's clothes and women's shoes, acting like a total sissy.&nbsp; You could have stopped at any time, but you didn't because you love it.&nbsp; In fact, you've all but begged me to feminize you, to control you, and to humiliate you.&nbsp; Well this is the price of that, sister.&nbsp; If you want that to continue, then it's going to continue on my terms--"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I don't want my ears pierced!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm not going to play this game, Loren, where you act like I'm in charge until I try to make a decision.&nbsp; If you want this to continue, then you better learn right now to submit to me."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fine," he said quickly and nervously.&nbsp; He glanced around to see if anyone heard her.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie shook her head and kicked her heel against the floor.&nbsp; "No.&nbsp; You're not going to humor me and then later pretend this didn't happen.&nbsp; It's time you made a decision."&nbsp; She folded her arms.&nbsp; "It's your choice.&nbsp; You can go back to being Loren, an average man whose wife knows his little secret, a secret he's afraid of, or you can step out into the light and be my Laura.&nbsp; But this is the last time I ask.&nbsp; It's all or nothing from hereon out."&nbsp; She looked at her watch.&nbsp; "I'm going to get a new pair of earrings.&nbsp; I'll give you a minute to decide."&nbsp; She walked over to the booth.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren stared at his wife.&nbsp; He honestly didn't know what to say.&nbsp; On the one hand, he was enjoying this incredibly despite himself and he didn't want it to end.&nbsp; Also, the idea that he would never again get to wear heels or skirts or makeup strangely bothered him a lot.&nbsp; On the other hand, he didn't know if he could truly bring himself to submit to his wife.&nbsp; His masculine ego kept fighting him every time he tried.&nbsp; It also worried him that he didn't know what she was thinking.&nbsp; If she was willing to pierce his ears, what else would she do to him which could never be undone?&nbsp; How far would she push this?&nbsp; Would she expose him to their friends?&nbsp; The prospect terrified him. . . yet, it excited him too.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren suddenly realized he'd been standing there for a long time, though he didn't know how long � he had no watch.&nbsp; If he was going to say yes, then he needed to do it now, otherwise Stephanie would take his answer as a no and his walk back to the car would be the last steps he'd ever take in a skirt.&nbsp; But did he want to say yes?&nbsp; What would he do?&nbsp; He walked over to Stephanie who was chatting with the girl behind the booth.&nbsp; He still didn't know what he would say.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I. . . can I speak to you," he asked his wife.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go ahead."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I mean alone."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie shook her head.&nbsp; "No, if you have something to say, Jennifer can hear it too."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren shuddered.&nbsp; He took a deep breath.&nbsp; "I want to continue."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie threw her arms around Loren, kissing him on the lips.&nbsp; "You won't regret this, Laura!"&nbsp; She turned to Jennifer who looked stunned by Stephanie's embrace of the other woman.&nbsp; "Jennifer, meet my husband Loren.&nbsp; He wants his ears pierced."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Chapter 12: Laura Gets Caught
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie had left for work a few minutes before.&nbsp; Her week-long vacation was over.&nbsp; Loren finished cleaning the kitchen and went to put away some dishes in the china cabinet in the living room.&nbsp; Loren still wore the red maid's dress Stephanie told him to wear today.&nbsp; He considered changing out of the maid's dress before he started the housework, because it was impractical and not all that comfortable, but he hadn't.&nbsp; If he was being truthful with himself, he was coming to like feeling "dominated" by Stephanie.&nbsp; Indeed, feeling submissive was giving him an unexpected thrill.&nbsp; And wearing the ridiculous maid's dress even when no one was watching made him feel very submissive.&nbsp; He did, however, change out of the four-inch heels Stephanie wanted him to wear with the dress and into a pair of basic low-heeled black pumps.&nbsp; The heels were just a little too uncomfortable to wear all day and, he told himself, he could feel just as "dominated" in low-heeled pumps.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After Loren finished replacing the dishes, he planned to go upstairs and jerk himself off.&nbsp; He needed it.&nbsp; Except for the one night and the incident at the store, Stephanie had denied him release all week and the pressure was killing him.&nbsp; In fact, he was so ready to explode he constantly leaked pre-cum all week.&nbsp; And with Stephanie having no way to watch him or know if he did it, he intended to get some of the release he craved.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, he heard the doorbell.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren froze.&nbsp; He hadn't thought about what he would do if someone came to the door.&nbsp; With Stephanie home, he could have hidden while she took care of whoever it was.&nbsp; But being alone, he couldn't do that.&nbsp; If he had been dressed more "ordinary," as Stephanie called it when he was dressed as a normal woman rather than a maid or school girl fantasy, then he could have chanced it, assuming it was just a deliveryman and not a neighbor.&nbsp; But seeing as how he was wearing the maid costume, there was no way he could open the door.&nbsp; He couldn't quietly slip away either.&nbsp; Any attempt to leave the living room would expose him through their front window unless he went through the front hallway.&nbsp; But the front door had a glass frame about chest high.&nbsp; There was a lace curtain over the glass, but whoever it was would easily be able to make out that someone was on the other side wearing something red and feminine.&nbsp; Plus, with the front hallway having wooden floors, Loren was concerned about the sound his heels would make � it didn't occur to him to take them off.&nbsp; His best option was just to stay put and wait it out.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The doorbell rang again and whoever it was knocked as well.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, Loren's curiosity got the better of him and he peeked out the front window from behind the curtain.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; It was Kathleen!&nbsp; He ducked and prayed she didn't see him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She knocked again.&nbsp; Then she yelled, "Loren, let me in."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He ignored her, but she didn't go away.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few seconds later, his phone rang.&nbsp; He crept across the room to look at the caller identification.&nbsp; It was Kathleen.&nbsp; She was calling from the front door using her cell phone.&nbsp; Her voice came over the answering machine.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Loren, open up."&nbsp; She paused.&nbsp; "I know you're in there."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The machine disconnected.&nbsp; Twenty seconds passed.&nbsp; Loren stared at the machine, waiting to see if she would call again.&nbsp; If she didn't call within a minute, he would creep back to the window and see if she was gone.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The phone rang again.&nbsp; It was Kathleen again.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let me in, Loren.&nbsp; I can see you, sweetie.&nbsp; Open up and let's discuss this."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren's jaw dropped.&nbsp; What did she mean?&nbsp; Discuss what?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She continued.&nbsp; "Open up, or I'll tell everyone."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren panicked.&nbsp; He grabbed the phone.&nbsp; "Kathleen, hi!&nbsp; I didn't hear the phone, I was in the shower."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Uh huh."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What. . . what were you saying?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I said to let me in."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I can't, I'm dripping wet and I'm not decent."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Naked?&nbsp; Really?&nbsp; You wouldn't lie to me, would you Loren?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, of course not."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because you don't look naked from here."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren froze.&nbsp; "From where?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Turn around, sweetie."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren spun around.&nbsp; There was Kathleen standing on a large landscaping rock, which made her just tall enough that her smiling face could peer into the window.&nbsp; She waved and then held up her phone and snapped Loren's picture.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren opened the door and reluctantly stepped back to let Kathleen enter.&nbsp; She stood there, with her hands on her hips, her feet spread as wide apart as her pencil skirt and kitten-heeled mules would let her, and an overwhelming smile on her face.&nbsp; She slowly looked Loren up and down.&nbsp; Then she laughed.&nbsp; She reached out and flipped up the crinoline under his skirt, exposing his erection � he wore no panties with this uniform as Stephanie instructed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh bravo!" she proclaimed.&nbsp; She pinched the end of his penis.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren's face went from pink to red to flaming red.&nbsp; He opened his mouth, but nothing came out.&nbsp; "I. . . uh. . ."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kathleen smiled evilly at him.&nbsp; "You what?&nbsp; You can explain?"&nbsp; She laughed again, still holding onto the end of his penis.&nbsp; "I can't wait to hear this.&nbsp; Go on, sweetie, explain."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Stephanie and I have a costume party--"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh please!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's true," he protested.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then why were you wearing heels at the dinner party."&nbsp; She pointed at his feet with her free hand, the other remained firmly attached to his penis.&nbsp; "I saw you, Loren!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Kathleen, I don't think I want to discuss this.&nbsp; Please leave," he said firmly.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Please get out of my house."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Loren, sweetie, I don't think you understand your position here.&nbsp; Not only do I know something you don't want anyone else knowing, but I have a photo to prove it."&nbsp; She pulled out her cell phone and took another photo for good measure.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He snatched the phone from her hands, causing her to squeeze his penis so tightly he winced.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She smirked at him.&nbsp; "That won't help you, but I love the fact you tried.&nbsp; When I took the photo, it automatically loaded to my account.&nbsp; You could destroy the phone and I'd still have the photo."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you want, Kathleen?!" he asked angrily.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right now, I just want to chat."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have nothing to say."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Fine!" she declared and she finally let go of his penis.&nbsp; "I'll just leave until you're in a more cooperative mood."&nbsp; She held out her hand.&nbsp; "I'd like my phone back."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren hesitated.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Seriously, the photos aren't on the phone anymore, they're in my account."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren grudgingly returned the phone to her hand.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She started toward the door.&nbsp; "I hope you're ready for everyone to know about this."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why should I?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are you planning?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She turned and smirked at Loren.&nbsp; "Me?&nbsp; I'm not planning anything, but since I'm being deprived of my fun, I figure I'll spend the day at the spa and then, when Stephie gets home, I'll tell her what her husband's been doing."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren raised an eyebrow.&nbsp; Clearly, Kathleen was trying to blackmail him by threatening to tell Stephanie.&nbsp; Little did she know Stephanie was behind this.&nbsp; He suddenly felt braver.&nbsp; "You go right ahead, I'll bet Stephanie doesn't care in the slightest."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kathleen shrugged her shoulders.&nbsp; "We'll see.&nbsp; Oh, and I love the nails!"&nbsp; She snapped another picture of Loren and walked out the front door.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie sat in her office working on her latest project when her phone rang.&nbsp; It was Loren.&nbsp; He was upset.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Slow down.&nbsp; What happened?" she asked.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Kathleen came over and saw me in the maid costume!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She giggled to herself, imagining the scene as Kathleen stumbled upon poor Loren in his maid costume.&nbsp; She didn't want him exposed, but she knew Kathleen had better judgment than to start telling everyone.&nbsp; Also, she was beginning to think about the possibility of making this a full-time arrangement and that would mean their friends would eventually need to know.&nbsp; This could be a good test.&nbsp; "That was careless of you," she said indifferently.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren was temporarily stunned to hear his wife blame him for getting caught.&nbsp; "Wait a minute, I'm not the one who insisted that I wear this costume all day."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I took you to stores, to the mall and all over town and no one spotted you.&nbsp; You spend two hours alone and you've already gotten yourself discovered.&nbsp; Who's being careless?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are we going to do?" he asked, evading her question.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First, you're going to answer my question because when I speak to my little sissy, I expect an answer."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I was more careless," he said and his face burned as he said it.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now, tell me what happened."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She took my picture with her cell phone and then tried to blackmail me.&nbsp; She said she would tell you what I was doing while you were at work--"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie laughed.&nbsp; "That's ironic, isn't it?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I told her you wouldn't care.&nbsp; Then she left."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie closed her eyes and tried to picture the scene.&nbsp; Her leg shook back and forth furiously.&nbsp; Maybe there was a chance to have a little more fun here?&nbsp; "Here's what you're going to do.&nbsp; I want you to call her and ask her to come back over.&nbsp; Then I want you to beg her not to tell me.&nbsp; Let her blackmail you."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What?!&nbsp; Why?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You heard me.&nbsp; Let her blackmail you.&nbsp; This could be fun.&nbsp; Let's see what she comes up with.&nbsp; Maybe she's got something really creative in mind?&nbsp; Think of it as a learning experience."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But you're risking my future?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, you risked that when you let her catch you."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But this could just make it worse!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Those are the breaks."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But--"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No 'but', girlie.&nbsp; You agreed to be my submissive little husbandette, now it's time to submit to my will.&nbsp; And my will is that you let Kathleen do whatever she wants to you," she purred.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What if she wants to have sex with me?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Anything except that.&nbsp; Oh, and you can't tell her I know."&nbsp; She paused.&nbsp; "Now, do you think you can handle this?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, ma'am."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --0--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren picked up the phone.&nbsp; He'd never dreaded a phone call more than this.&nbsp; He dialed Kathleen's number.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Change your mind?" Kathleen asked when she picked up the phone.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren swallowed hard.&nbsp; "Please don't tell Stephanie."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why?&nbsp; What's in it for me?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He took a deep breath.&nbsp; "What do you want?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm not sure I want anything anymore, seeing as how rude you were to me."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm sorry, please forgive me," he said through gritted teeth.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I suppose we could work something out," she said with faked frustration.&nbsp; Her excitement was plain through the phone.&nbsp; Loren remained silent.&nbsp; "Have you changed yet?" she asked.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good.&nbsp; Then I'll come over and we can talk about this.&nbsp; Don't change anything you're wearing."&nbsp; She hung up.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The phone rang a moment after Loren set it down.&nbsp; It was his agent.&nbsp; "Cindy, hi, what's up?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want to see how my favorite writer is doing?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Nothing to report.&nbsp; I haven't started anything yet."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Writer's block?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren looked down at his erection popping out beneath the stiff maid's skirt.&nbsp; "Something like that."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is there anything I can do to help?&nbsp; I could come over and you could bounce ideas off me?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren bit his tongue.&nbsp; "No, that's ok."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ok, well, call me if you need anything."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kathleen stood before Loren with her arms folded.&nbsp; "So you're giving up, are you?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He nodded.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Afraid I'll tell Stephanie, is that it?" she smirked.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He nodded again.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You men are so predictable.&nbsp; You know what this means, right?" she asked.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I have a pretty good idea."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It means you have to do anything I say."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren nodded.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's how it should always be, don't you agree?&nbsp; Men should always submit to women."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren shrugged his shoulders.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kathleen furrowed her brow.&nbsp; "Come on, Loren.&nbsp; Tell me I'm right."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, men should always submit to women.&nbsp; Women are superior."&nbsp; He probably wouldn't have been this helpful a week ago, but he was beginning to find it quite natural to submit.&nbsp; Plus, he didn't want to anger Kathleen or Stephanie at this point, so he played along.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kathleen rocked back and forth on her heels.&nbsp; "Hmm."&nbsp; She laughed.&nbsp; "I don't even know what to do now."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren didn't volunteer any ideas.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Tell me how this started?&nbsp; Did your mother dress you up or something?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren thought about this for second.&nbsp; He needed a story that didn't implicate Stephanie.&nbsp; It was time to use his storytelling skills.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later that night, Loren sat on the couch with his skirt hiked up and his legs spread apart.&nbsp; He sat on his hands, as Stephanie had ordered.&nbsp; Stephanie sat on the other end of the couch, still in her almond-colored suit from work.&nbsp; Her brown pumps were on the floor and her feet rested in Loren's lap.&nbsp; Specifically, her left foot rested on his thigh and her right foot tipped over into his lap and slowly rubbed up and down his erection.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So what did you tell her?" Stephanie asked.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What could I tell her?&nbsp; I made up a story of a childhood incident."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Which was?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "When I was young, my sister dressed me up.&nbsp; My mother caught us and punished me by parading me around the neighborhood.&nbsp; I figured that might make Kathleen more sympathetic if she thought this was a deep-rooted issue and might keep her from doing anything stupid."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did she believe it?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She had no reason not to."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What did she say?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Awww," he mimicked.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then what did you tell her."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I told her I hadn't thought about it for years, but it started again after Halloween when we watched some movie about a guy who wears his wife's clothes behind her back.&nbsp; Something about the movie triggered this inside me again and the next thing I knew, there I was en femme."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Simple story."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The problem was, she kept insisting there was more to it, so I kept having to add to it to satisfy her," he said.&nbsp; He was breathing heavily now and his penis began throbbing.&nbsp; He tried to force his penis against her foot, which was difficult as he couldn't use his hands, but every time he pushed, she pulled away.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What did she say about your recent activities?"&nbsp; Stephanie wrapped her toes around the head of his penis, trapping it in the pantyhose between her toes, and she began to squeeze with her toes.&nbsp; Loren felt the pressure building.&nbsp; It would explode any second.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She teased me, said I was 'a bad boy' for stealing from your closet."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie suddenly stopped moving her foot.&nbsp; "Wait a minute!&nbsp; She thinks the maid costume is from my closet?!&nbsp; What kind of kinky weirdo does she think I am?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren felt the throbbing in his penis receding and frustration take its place.&nbsp; "No.&nbsp; She said I was a bad boy for stealing your shoes at the party and whatever other items I told her I stole.&nbsp; Then she asked if the uniform came from your closet and I told her I bought it."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What did she say?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She laughed at the idea of me going out and buying a maid uniform.&nbsp; Then she wanted to know where I bought it--"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What did you tell her?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The truth.&nbsp; That I got it from a costume shop across town."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What did she say about the party?"&nbsp; Stephanie still hadn't resumed moving her foot, and Loren was trying to rub his penis against her motionless sole without success.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She quizzed me over and over how you couldn't know.&nbsp; I told her I was very careful.&nbsp; I don't know if she bought that or not.&nbsp; Then she asked me to go put the same shoes back on.&nbsp; Apparently, all she realized at the party was that I was wearing those stupid pumps.&nbsp; She made me model those.&nbsp; Then she asked me why I did it.&nbsp; I told her I thought I could get away with it because no one would see my feet."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Did she believe you?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She seemed to."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then what?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then she didn't really know what to do.&nbsp; So she hung around for a bit and watched me clean the house.&nbsp; After a while she promised to buy me some clothes.&nbsp; Then she left."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie laughed.&nbsp; "Sounds like you made a friend!"&nbsp; Stephanie leaned back further against the couch and began moving her toes again.&nbsp; She squeeze his penis between her big toe and the next.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren suddenly became short of breath as his penis began pulsing like it would explode.&nbsp; He closed his eyes and thrust his penis against her toes.&nbsp; But Stephanie stopped the moment she realized what he was doing and she pulled her foot back.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is she coming back tomorrow?" Stephanie asked.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren took a deep breath.&nbsp; "I assume so."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I had an idea after your phone call.&nbsp; So I stopped off at the computer store on the way home."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What kind of idea?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I bought nanny-cams for each room of the house.&nbsp; I'm going to hook them up so I can keep an eye on you and Kathleen."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What?!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She shoved his penis with her toes.&nbsp; "Don't question me.&nbsp; I warned you.&nbsp; Submissive means submissive.&nbsp; That means you accept my will without question!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm sorry, Miss Stephanie," he said sarcastically.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie felt a shock course through her body.&nbsp; Yes, Loren had said this sarcastically, but the idea that her husband could become so submissive as to call her "Miss Stephanie" thrilled her.&nbsp; She decided it was time for a little display of power.&nbsp; Stephanie began rubbing his penis again with her toes.&nbsp; "You're going to put those cameras up this evening so I can watch you, and make sure you don't break my rules."&nbsp; She kept rubbing and squeezing his penis.&nbsp; "I will decide when you get to ejaculate, understood?&nbsp; You won't be making that decision on your own anymore.&nbsp; And I don't want you doing it when I'm not home.&nbsp; So I'll be watching."&nbsp; As she spoke, she felt his penis begin throbbing once again.&nbsp; His breathing became shallow and she saw his muscles tense.&nbsp; She smiled.&nbsp; "In fact, let's put them up now," she said and she pulled her foot away.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren visibly deflated.&nbsp; He pointed to his penis.&nbsp; "But?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie gave Loren's penis one last stroke with her toes.&nbsp; "You have to learn, dear, sissies don't always get what they want.&nbsp; Now pull up your panties and come with me."&nbsp; She rose from the couch and headed for the kitchen.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren bit his tongue.&nbsp; He felt intense frustration as his penis shrank again.&nbsp; What's worse, he knew the cameras really did mean he couldn't switch into the low-heeled pumps anymore during the days, nor would he be able to masturbate, as he desperately wanted to do.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next day, Kathleen returned.&nbsp; Stephanie watched them from work and was disappointed that Kathleen basically sat there watching Loren work.&nbsp; She had hoped for something more exciting.&nbsp; The next day was the same.&nbsp; By Friday, Stephanie was becoming annoyed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "All she does is sit there and read magazines or watch you work," Stephanie said as she sipped the drink Loren had prepared.&nbsp; Dinner was almost ready and she had made him change into the little black dress before they ate.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know," Loren said.&nbsp; He didn't see this as a bad thing.&nbsp; Kathleen was someone he desperately wished didn't know, so he was relieved that her demands were quite dull.&nbsp; In fact, the worst thing she had done was ask to paint his nails.&nbsp; He was fine with that.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We need to find a way to spice this up," Stephanie said.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'd rather not."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie waved her hand at Loren.&nbsp; "Uh, hello.&nbsp; Who's in charge here?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren grimaced.&nbsp; "You are."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And what I want matters most, right?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren nodded his head.&nbsp; "Yes."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Good, now let's think of something to spice up your time with Kathleen."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Despite Stephanie's best efforts, she couldn't come up with anything new for Loren to do.&nbsp; So the following day started just the like others.&nbsp; Kathleen sat in the kitchen or the living room and watched Loren work.&nbsp; Today, Loren wore the pink maid uniform, which caused Kathleen to gush about how feminine he looked.&nbsp; Kathleen wore bronze slacks, a silvery blouse, black flats and a lot of bracelets.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; When Loren finished dusting, Kathleen rose from her seat.&nbsp; "I have a surprise for you, sweetie."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is it?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I told you, then it wouldn't be a surprise!"&nbsp; Kathleen told him to wait where he was while she went to her car.&nbsp; She returned carrying several shopping bags.&nbsp; "I think these should fit," she said as she began unpacking the bags.&nbsp; In short order, she presented Loren with an angora sweater, a white wrap-around skirt, an elegant dark-gray, knitted dress with a lace hem, a flowery ankle-length pleated skirt, and a long, warm wool skirt for winter.&nbsp; "These are old clothes of mine that I don't wear anymore."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Uh--"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't get me wrong, I like your little maid costumes and all, but I figured you could use more clothes, especially if we ever go out for lunch or go shopping."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Out?!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's ok dear," she said calmly.&nbsp; "All girls do lunch."&nbsp; She blushed.&nbsp; "Plus, I like the idea of you wearing my clothes," she said quietly.&nbsp; Then she reached into her purse and pulled out a large white pill.&nbsp; "And speaking of girls, I have just what you need."&nbsp; She handed the pill to Loren.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is it?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know if I should tell you or not?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren scowled.&nbsp; "I'm not taking it unless you tell me what it is."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kathleen laughed.&nbsp; "You are so cute when you think you have a choice!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Seriously, what is it?" he asked.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hormones!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hormones?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yep.&nbsp; I'm going to turn you into the girl you always wanted to be.&nbsp; This will give you huge boobs and make you this little bitty girly thing.&nbsp; You'll like it, you'll see," she said in a playful tone.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you serious?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She smiled and winked.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren thought for a moment and decided she had to be joking.&nbsp; Why would she give him real hormones?&nbsp; But if she wanted to pretend to give him hormones, then so be it.&nbsp; He took the pill.&nbsp; Kathleen giggled.&nbsp; "Good girl!&nbsp; Now let's try on some of these clothes."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That night, Stephanie made Loren model all of his new clothes for her and repeat the events of the day.&nbsp; Loren left out the bit about the supposed hormone pill because he didn't want to give Stephanie any ideas.&nbsp; He believed Kathleen was just playing a game, but he feared Stephanie really would run with the idea.&nbsp; After all, she had already pierced his ears and exposed him to several strangers.&nbsp; And after the past few weeks, he had no idea how far Stephanie really would go to feminize his body, so he decided he didn't want to take any chances.










The Writer's Secret
by Ann Michelle
(http://annemichellesworld.blogspot.com/)

Synopsis:&nbsp; Loren had no idea what he was getting into when his agent suggested he write transvestite fiction. Nor did he realize how eagerly his wife Stephanie would embrace the idea of feminizing her husband. How far would they go?


Chapter 13: Laura Blossoms
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A routine developed.&nbsp; During the weekdays, Kathleen would come over to watch Loren work.&nbsp; They would read fashion magazines, watch her favorite soap, and she would gossip about their friends.&nbsp; They were becoming good friends.&nbsp; She would also occasionally bring him more clothes and would hint that they should go out somewhere public, but so far, she hadn't forced the issue.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kathleen also tried to encourage Loren to get back to work on his next book.&nbsp; Despite everything, he had decided to write another thriller, though this was proving difficult.&nbsp; Loren had laid out the plot, but he found he had little interest in it, at least until he came to the chapter where he introduces the woman his hero would eventually be saving.&nbsp; Loren spent two full pages describing her clothes before he realized what he had done.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Can you believe this?" Loren asked.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Apparently, you've got a thing for clothes," Kathleen said with a chuckle as she looked over the two pages he had written.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And the real problem is, I can't even think about what to take out.&nbsp; It all seems relevant!&nbsp; I read each word and I think, 'that needs to be in there so the audience can see her.'"&nbsp; He took the pages from Kathleen.&nbsp; "Listen to this," he said, as he crossed his legs and began wiggling his high-heeled Mary Jane beneath his tight maroon skirt.&nbsp; He read:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
She sat on the bed and tucked the secret plans inside her purse, an exquisite black-leather purse from Gusti decorated with embroidered black roses.&nbsp; It had two internal compartments, one for her wallet and one for the other things she kept.&nbsp; She set the purse down on the floor next to her feet and crossed her legs.&nbsp; Her sandal dangled from the ends of her golden toes.&nbsp; The lilac polish on her toenails peeked out through the open toe of the tan sandal as its four-inch heel swayed gently back and forth to the rhythm of her leg.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It goes on like that for two pages," he said.&nbsp; "And do you know the one thing I don't mention?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I never mention what the plans are. . . completely forgot!"&nbsp; Loren rolled his eyes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kathleen giggled.&nbsp; "Maybe they're designs for a new clothing line and your hero is a fashion designer spy!" 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren shook his head and tossed the papers into the garbage.&nbsp; "Do you know, I'm actually starting to look at women's clothes rather than their bodies?&nbsp; I'm serious.&nbsp; Stephanie and I have started going out for dinner lately and I--"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Started?" Kathleen asked with an odd expression on her face.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren suddenly remembered that Kathleen did not know that he remained dressed as Laura when he was with Stephanie.&nbsp; "Uh, yeah, started.&nbsp; We hadn't been going out for a while since Stephanie's vacation ended. . . and now we've started again."&nbsp; Kathleen seemed to accept this, so Loren continued.&nbsp; "And I swear to you, I'll see some really hot woman waiting to be seated and I don't think, 'wow, great boobs' or 'awesome butt.'&nbsp; No.&nbsp; I'll think, 'wow, those are fantastic shoes, I wonder where she got them?'&nbsp; Or I'll start thinking about how I would look in her dress or how much more I like her purse than mine."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kathleen smiled.&nbsp; "Loren, have you considered that maybe it's time to tell Stephanie?&nbsp; Maybe it's time to go full-time as a woman?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren shook his head.&nbsp; This thought had crossed his mind more and more lately, but he tried to suppress it every time it came up.&nbsp; He was a man and that's how it would have to be.&nbsp; Besides, while this had been fun, he couldn't imagine Stephanie really wanting to live with him as a woman for the rest of his life, could she?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, you're welcome to come shopping with me the next time you get the urge to buy whatever pretty clothes you see on another woman."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thanks, I'll keep that in mind," he said with some frustration.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, I almost forgot!" Kathleen said, and she reached into her purse.&nbsp; "It's pill time, sweetie."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren rolled his eyes.&nbsp; Each day Kathleen gave him another pill.&nbsp; She even found ways to get him the pills on weekends, by making excuses to drop by.&nbsp; Loren was sure this was a game, and that these were just vitamins, but it seemed to make her happy to pretend they were hormones, so he took them and never thought twice about it.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Soon days turned into weeks and Loren's hair grew.&nbsp; It now hung just past his shoulders and Stephanie dyed it blond and gave it wavy curls, which made it hard for Loren to look masculine on the occasions he needed to dress like "Loren" again, such as when Jane and Greg came over for lunch.&nbsp; But then, his hair wasn't the only problem.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; For one thing, his eyebrows were now completely feminine.&nbsp; They were highly arched and delicate.&nbsp; They were also dyed to match his hair.&nbsp; The holes in his ears were more obvious as well because the earrings Stephanie made him wear were heavy and stretched his lobes.&nbsp; His nails were long and oval, even without polish.&nbsp; Plus, his mannerisms were all wrong.&nbsp; He had become so used to wearing heels that he now walked like he wore them even when he didn't.&nbsp; He also moved his hands in a feminine manner, crossed his legs like a woman, walked with a swish, folded his arms beneath his breasts, and generally made delicate motions to avoid upsetting the intricate clothing and makeup he normally wore, even when he wasn't wearing it.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At the same time, he noticed that his skin felt softer too and his hair fuller.&nbsp; He put this down to using Stephanie's beauty products.&nbsp; But then he began to notice that his chest and hips were becoming flabby and he was losing muscle mass.&nbsp; This puzzled him.&nbsp; The breasts could be the result of the new bra Stephanie bought him, but he wasn't sure.&nbsp; This nearly-magical bra appeared to give him genuine cleavage, if you didn't look to carefully.&nbsp; And even though his body returned to its normal shape after he took the bra off, it seemed to take some time these days for that to happen, and even then, his chest was definitely flabby.&nbsp; The rest he simply couldn't explain.&nbsp; Was it possible Kathleen really was giving him hormones?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Even more worryingly, however, he was having a harder time getting an erection and it wasn't nearly as firm as it had been.&nbsp; This was the first change Stephanie noticed.&nbsp; One night, Stephanie had called Loren into the bedroom to give him his reward for being a "good girl" all weekend, but no matter what they did, he couldn't keep it stiff.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't get it, dear," she said as she tugged on his flaccid member.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren bit his lip.&nbsp; "I just don't know what to say?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Are you not finding this exciting anymore?" she asked as she push it back and forth and tried to blow on it.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Absolutely I am!&nbsp; It just won't get as hard for some reason.&nbsp; I can't explain it."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie grabbed it and squeezed.&nbsp; "Does my husband like being a little sissy whose wife tells him what to do?" she cooed at it.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; "Hmm.&nbsp; That always worked before."&nbsp; She tickled the underside of his shaft.&nbsp; Nothing.&nbsp; "Hmm."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't understand this," Loren said.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hold on, I've got it."&nbsp; She grabbed a pair of panties from the floor and wrapped them around his penis.&nbsp; She began rubbing him with the panties.&nbsp; "Does my little sissy need panties to get it up?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Suddenly, his penis stirred.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "'atta girl!&nbsp; Look at the poor little thing growing!" she cheered.&nbsp; The more she rubbed, the more it began to grow.&nbsp; "Keep going, girlfriend!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren blushed, but his penis did finally become erect, though it seemed smaller than normal and it was still soft enough that Stephanie could bend it easily.&nbsp; After a few seconds, it deflated.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie put her hands on her hips and announced:&nbsp; "Loren, I think you've taken this girl thing too far."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What are we going to do?" he asked nervously.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie giggled.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you mind, this is serious!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Loren, honey, this is not serious.&nbsp; Serious is a heart attack.&nbsp; Serious is can't pay your bills.&nbsp; This," she said, flipping his penis from one side to the other, "this is an inconvenience.&nbsp; I'll take you to see my doct--"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No way!&nbsp; There's no way I'm explaining this to a doctor!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie frowned.&nbsp; "Loren, you need to see my doctor."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No way," he insisted.&nbsp; "I would die of embarrassment if somebody else knew."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie shook her head.&nbsp; "Fine, I'll see my doctor and I'll see if she can help us without seeing you."&nbsp; She climbed on top of him.&nbsp; "But in the meantime, we need to teach you how girls do it."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; --0--
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thanks for this, Claire," Stephanie told her doctor.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No problem, Steph."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I tried to get Loren to come see you, but he's too embarrassed."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I understand.&nbsp; ED can be quite a humiliation for most men.&nbsp; He's probably ashamed to be seen in public right now, afraid that everyone will think he's no longer a man."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie laughed.&nbsp; "You don't know the half of it!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh trust me, Steph, I see this all the time.&nbsp; Loren's case is nothing unusual."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie bit her tongue and said to herself, "you have no idea how unusual!"&nbsp; She held up the pill container.&nbsp; "But these pills will fix him, right?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Claire smiled.&nbsp; "He'll be hard as a rock.&nbsp; But he really should come see me, it could be any number of things."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Like what?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lots of things.&nbsp; There are some creams and a few heart pills that mimic female hormones.&nbsp; Those can be a problem.&nbsp; He might have put on some weight.&nbsp; It could just be stress.&nbsp; Or there could be something that needs to be fixed."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'll see what I can do about making him come see you," Stephanie said.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That night, she gave Loren the first of these pills.&nbsp; He was hard as a rock all night and most of the following day.&nbsp; The thrill had returned.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Chapter 14: The Cross-tume Party
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren lay on the bed wearing only a pink babydoll nightie and stockings.&nbsp; His panties and his heels lay on the floor, where Stephanie had tossed them.&nbsp; His hands were tied to the headboard with a pair of Stephanie's stockings.&nbsp; Stephanie sat on top of him, with her knees on either side of him and her hands behind her, gripping the heels on her mules.&nbsp; She wore a matching babydoll nightie, though hers was blue � she said that made her "the boy."&nbsp; She also wore stockings and her mules.&nbsp; Her panties lay on the floor next to Loren's.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That'a girl, Laura," Stephanie purred, as she flexed her vaginal muscles and squeezed his erection.&nbsp; She was breathing heavily.&nbsp; "We should do this more often!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren pushed his hips upwards.&nbsp; He felt the pressure building inside his penis.&nbsp; "I'm always up for more. . . I've been waiting for this all day."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I know, I could tell at the restaurant already," she said between breaths.&nbsp; "I thought you were going to burst out of your girdle and scare the waiter."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's the burgers. . . burgers excite me."&nbsp; He too was breathing heavily.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie laughed.&nbsp; "Yeah, right.&nbsp; I think it was the blond seated across from us.&nbsp; The one in the red dress.&nbsp; I saw you looking her way all night."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I was admiring her shoes," he said with a wink.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie laughed again.&nbsp; "I'm sure."&nbsp; She squeezed even harder now and began to gyrate.&nbsp; "Of course. . . they were pretty."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "They were exquisite.&nbsp; I almost asked her where she got them," he said between puffs.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Imagine my husband approaching a strange woman to ask her where she bought her shoes!"&nbsp; She felt her muscles begin to contract, an orgasm was near.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah, I'll bet that doesn't happen too often in other families," he said as his penis began to throb.&nbsp; His climax was near as well.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Speaking of things we should do more often," she said as she ground herself even further down on his erection, "we're having another party."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren suddenly stopped.&nbsp; "What do you mean?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hey, did I say 'stop'?!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What kind of party?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie let go of her heels and leaned forward.&nbsp; She placed her hands on either side of his chest and kissed him on the lips.&nbsp; "A party party," she said.&nbsp; "I miss our friends and I want to see them again.&nbsp; Now get back to work."&nbsp; She jiggled her hips from side to side.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And how will I be dressed for this party party?" he asked coldly.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I haven't decided yet," she said.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's an important detail, don't you think?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie licked his earlobe, causing the hoops in his ears to jingle.&nbsp; "Don't you want to be surprised?" she asked with a pout.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No."&nbsp; His penis began to deflate.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Really?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No," he repeated.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie sat up straight again and slid her hands beneath his babydoll, slowly sliding them up his torso until her hands reached his breasts, then she suddenly furrowed her brow.&nbsp; "Hey!&nbsp; You're getting flabby, girlfriend!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't change the topic," he said.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm not changing the topic," she said and she squeezed the flabby mounds upon his chest.&nbsp; "But you're getting really flabby.&nbsp; Seriously, you're gonna need a bra for real at this rate.&nbsp; We need to put you on a diet or something.&nbsp; I should make you go to the gym."&nbsp; She giggled.&nbsp; "Could you imagine mincing into the locker room in your little skirt and high heels as they all watched you?&nbsp; Then you'd drop your panties and they would see your little dicky standing there all by its lonesome.&nbsp; Wouldn't that be exciting?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, it wouldn't.&nbsp; But seriously, what kind of party are you talking about?&nbsp; And what am I going to wear?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie laughed.&nbsp; "Now you do sound like a woman, 'I haven't got a thing to wear.'"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren glared at her.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, all right, fine," Stephanie said with some frustration.&nbsp; She climbed off Loren and sat on the edge of the bed.&nbsp; "I think it's time we laid some groundwork for your 'coming out.'"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you mean, my 'coming out'?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Honestly, Loren, did you think you could be Laura all the time without having to tell our friends?&nbsp; If you're going to be Laura, they will have to see you at some point."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So you want to have a party and show me off?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sort of, yes," she said with a sly smile.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "And you expect me to dress like a woman at this party?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, absolutely."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren took a deep breath.&nbsp; "And what exactly will I be wearing?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I haven't decided yet.&nbsp; I'm leaning toward the pink maid costume, but the naughty school girl look might be better.&nbsp; Unless you have a better idea?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this a joke?&nbsp; There is no way I'm letting you invite all our friends over and then parade me in front of them in a maid costume," he said sourly.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Loren," she kissed him on the lips, "honey," she kissed him again, "you have no say in the matter, remember?&nbsp; If that's what I want, then you'll do it."&nbsp; She kissed him one more time.&nbsp; "But you'll be happy to know, you won't be alone.&nbsp; I'm planning a costume party. . . or more specifically, a 'cross-tume' party."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What is a 'cross-tume party'?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie leaned back and draped one arm over his legs, resting the other within inches of his penis.&nbsp; "We're having a costume party, only I'm making all the men come as women."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A crossdressing costume party?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Right, that's why I called it a 'cross-tume party'."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why are we doing this?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She began pushing his penis back and forth with the deep-purple nail on her pointer finger.&nbsp; "Think about it, dear.&nbsp; If you're going to stay as Laura, which is something you and I both know you want, then Laura needs to come out of the closet at some point.&nbsp; You can't keep trying to be Loren when guests come over and Laura the rest of the time.&nbsp; You agree, right?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren shrugged his shoulders.&nbsp; She was right and he knew it, but he just didn't like the idea of their friends knowing his secret.&nbsp; It scared him.&nbsp; What would they think of him?&nbsp; "Go on."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So eventually, we need to tell them.&nbsp; We could just invite them over, in a group or one at a time, and tell them you've decided to become Laura.&nbsp; But that will be quite a shock for them, and we have no idea how they would react."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "True."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But if we have this party, then they'll get a chance to see you as a woman before we ever tell them.&nbsp; That can sink into their minds.&nbsp; Then, when we tell them about Laura in a couple weeks or whatever, they've already had a chance to get used to the idea of you as a woman.&nbsp; It won't shock them."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This made a certain amount of sense to Loren.&nbsp; Rather than hit their friends with this out of the blue, they would at least have a frame of reference within which they could accept the idea.&nbsp; That said, however, this was all unchartered territory and Loren really had no idea how their friends would react.&nbsp; This might ultimately achieve nothing.&nbsp; On the other hand, what could it hurt?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren looked at Stephanie.&nbsp; "Ok, I'll do it.&nbsp; But forget the maid costume.&nbsp; I want to look normal.&nbsp; I want to look like a real woman, not a pretend woman."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie smiled and kissed him on the lips.&nbsp; "Deal."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren chuckled.&nbsp; "You know, this has disaster written all over it, don't you?&nbsp; These guys are going to resist and I'll bet none of them show up in women's clothes.&nbsp; I'll be the only one standing there in a dress, feeling like an idiot."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I wouldn't be so sure, dear.&nbsp; We wives have ways of making our husbands do what we want," she said as she tickled his shaft.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You know, I'm starting to think you'd enjoy seeing the whole world feminized."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie laughed.&nbsp; She kissed him again and squeezed his growing erection.&nbsp; "Wouldn't you?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren chuckled.&nbsp; "No comment."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie climbed back on top of Loren.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "One last question.&nbsp; What will the women be wearing?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie adjusted herself.&nbsp; "Whatever they want."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kathleen came over the following morning.&nbsp; She was excited about the "cross-tume" party.&nbsp; She seemed to love the idea of feminizing men.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think it's going to be terrific fun," Kathleen said as she sipped her tea.&nbsp; She wore a yellow sundress and yellow pumps.&nbsp; "I take it this was your idea?&nbsp; Trying to get Stephie used to the idea, is that it?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Actually, it was Stephanie's idea," Loren said.&nbsp; He wore a white pleated skirt and the wooden clogs with the flowery pattern.&nbsp; His hair was tied back in a ponytail.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kathleen laughed.&nbsp; "Really?!&nbsp; Maybe she's trying to tell you something, sweetie?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren chuckled.&nbsp; "Could be.&nbsp; How is Peter taking the idea?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I haven't told him yet."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'll bet he puts up a fight."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If he does, he'll find out who wears the pants in our family, won't he?&nbsp; I hope Peter likes sequins."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren shook his head.&nbsp; He couldn't imagine Peter in a dress of any kind.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kathleen continued.&nbsp; "You know what I'm really excited about though?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kathleen leaned forward and began shaking her leg excitedly.&nbsp; "This party will be an excellent look into the lives of all our friends."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How so?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's like a Rorschach test.&nbsp; What the couples come dressed as and how they act could tell us a lot about them.&nbsp; Take Linda and Bill.&nbsp; Bill is so totally in control all the time and Linda is so mousy.&nbsp; Wouldn't it be telling if he showed up as a sexy maid and she showed up as a whip wielding dominatrix?"&nbsp; Kathleen laughed.&nbsp; "And what about Larry.&nbsp; He's a good six inches shorter than his wife.&nbsp; Do you think that bothers him?&nbsp; Do you think she likes it?&nbsp; We'll see when we see how high his heels are, won't we?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Didn't Freud say, 'sometimes high heels are just high heels'?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Freud probably shoved cigars up his rear," she said sarcastically.&nbsp; "Trust me, sweetie, we're going to find out a lot about these people."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren chuckled.&nbsp; "And what will we find out about you and Peter?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kathleen winked.&nbsp; "You tell me."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Poor Peter," Stephanie said with a laugh as she pulled off her shoes.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you mean, 'poor Peter'?" Loren asked as he pulled his dress over his head and sat down on their bed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If I read Kathleen correctly, things are about to change at their house.&nbsp; And I doubt Kathleen will be as a good a mistress as I've been to you."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Mistress?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, mistress.&nbsp; You can't deny that I'm the one wearing the pants around here, literally and figuratively."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren shrugged his shoulders.&nbsp; "Yeah, I guess."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "There's no guess about it.&nbsp; If I say heel, you say how high, and that's the way it should be.&nbsp; I like being in charge and you like being my submissive little toy," she said matter-of-factly.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren slid his stockings down his legs.&nbsp; "I wouldn't go that far."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I would.&nbsp; And don't forget, I've been very good to you.&nbsp; I'm letting you live your dream, when few other wives would."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren smiled to himself.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie continued.&nbsp; "But Kathleen is something else.&nbsp; She can go more than a little over the top and I suspect Peter is in for some hard nights.&nbsp; You just better hope she doesn't try to bring you two together."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; That wasn't something Loren wanted to think about and he cringed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie laughed.&nbsp; "Could you imagine?&nbsp; Think of the fun we could have if we brought you two 'girls' together.&nbsp; You could hold hands, kiss, maybe even experience a few of the pleasures sissies can give each other.&nbsp; I'll bet Peter gives great blowjobs," Stephanie said with an evil smile.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, thanks," Loren said firmly.&nbsp; He blushed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie turned to face him.&nbsp; "Are you sure?&nbsp; You two would look so cute together!"&nbsp; She was grinning from ear to ear, but Loren didn't respond.&nbsp; "What?&nbsp; No answer?&nbsp; You want time to think it over?" she asked with a giggle.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren frowned.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe I should make you put on your little maid's uniform and go offer her and Peter a hand?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren glared at her.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie jumped onto the bed and wrapped her arms around Loren.&nbsp; "I'm just kidding, dear.&nbsp; You may be a sissy, but you're my sissy and I don't want to share you with anyone. . . even another sissy."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren heard the doorbell and checked himself in the mirror one last time.&nbsp; That would be Kathleen and Peter.&nbsp; She'd promised to show up early as moral support before the other guests started to arrive.&nbsp; As Loren made his way to the door, he wondered what Peter would be wearing.&nbsp; Kathleen had refused to tell him, saying only that Peter would be dressed "appropriately."&nbsp; In retaliation, Loren refused to tell her how he would be dressed too.&nbsp; She assumed it would be the pink maid's uniform, which was her favorite, but Loren had other ideas.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren took a deep breath and opened the door.&nbsp; He was nervous.&nbsp; Even though this was ostensibly just a costume party, he felt like this was "the big moment" for him, where he finally "went public" to his friends.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh my God, Loren!" Kathleen gasped when she saw him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren smiled and turned so she could examine him.&nbsp; He wore a stunning white gown with long sleeves and a square collar.&nbsp; The dress had a diagonal cutout which displayed his cleavage, enhanced by a well-designed pushup bra, decorative pearl buttons on the sleeves, and a side-clasp.&nbsp; The dress hung to the floor, letting his red-painted toenails and silver sandals peek out only occasionally.&nbsp; His platinum-blond hair was done up in a sort of bun.&nbsp; His makeup was exquisite.&nbsp; His long silvery earrings, the several silver rings on his fingers, and the two silver toe-rings were all perfect accessories.&nbsp; The most amazing aspect, however, was his shape.&nbsp; Between the corset, the bra and the girdle, he had a nearly-perfect hourglass shape.&nbsp; He also had a completely smooth front and a curvy rear.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kathleen and Peter stared at Loren in silence for several seconds.&nbsp; Finally, Kathleen smiled.&nbsp; "Are you going to let us in, gorgeous?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren blushed.&nbsp; "Please come in."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This was the first moment Loren noticed their costumes, he had been too distracted by their responses before this.&nbsp; Kathleen wore a conservative, olive-colored men's suit, a white oxford dress shirt and a red and gold tie.&nbsp; Her hair was slicked back.&nbsp; She wore no earrings, but she did wear her normal makeup.&nbsp; She also had her nails painted to match the tie, and she wore what Loren recognized as kidskin pumps with three-inch heels.&nbsp; She looked sharp.&nbsp; Peter, on the other hand, looked incredibly uncomfortable.&nbsp; He wore a dress much like Alice in Disney's Alice in Wonderland.&nbsp; On his head, he wore a long blond wig.&nbsp; His legs and arms had been shaved.&nbsp; On his feet, he wore white stockings which stopped at his knees and black Mary Janes with two-inch heels.&nbsp; There was nothing passable about Peter.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Kathleen!&nbsp; Peter!" Stephanie called out from behind them.&nbsp; She had been in the kitchen setting out the chips and dips.&nbsp; She wore a Napoleon costume, complete with sword.&nbsp; She wore no makeup, but then she needed none.&nbsp; She hugged Kathleen and stepped back to admire her and Peter's costumes.&nbsp; "Very nice!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, they're nothing like Loren's!" Kathleen said.&nbsp; "He. . . excuse me, she is a total knockout.&nbsp; You seriously need to consider keeping her a woman full-time!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie laughed.&nbsp; "Don't think I haven't considered it."&nbsp; She patted Loren's rear.&nbsp; "What do you think, Laura, do you want to be a woman full-time?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren blushed.&nbsp; He wasn't sure how he was supposed to answer this, so he just smiled.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "A smile is not a denial," Kathleen said, waving her finger at Loren.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why don't you come in and make yourselves comfortable," Stephanie said.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; With Kathleen and Peter's help, the rest of the setup was completed in no time.&nbsp; Then the doorbell rang.&nbsp; It was Loren's job to greet the guests so he made his way to the hallway.&nbsp; He checked himself in the mirror again and took a deep breath.&nbsp; As he did, Kathleen came up behind him and placed her hands on his hips.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I would hug you, but I don't want to ruin that magnificent dress," she whispered into his ear.&nbsp; "You are drop dead gorgeous, Loren!&nbsp; I can't wait to compare you to the other husbands.&nbsp; There is no way any of them can hold a candle to you."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Indeed, they couldn't.&nbsp; One by one, the other couples arrived.&nbsp; There was a magician and her husband the magician's assistant.&nbsp; He had no balance in his black stilettos and abandoned them a few minutes after arrival.&nbsp; There was a pilot and her husband the stewardess.&nbsp; In real life he really was a pilot.&nbsp; There was a knight and her husband the damsel in distress.&nbsp; Then came Terri, the bullfighter, and her diminutive husband Larry, who dressed like Carmen Miranda, right down to the six-inch platform heels.&nbsp; Sadly for him, Terri made sure to wear slight heels, so she remained taller.&nbsp; There was also mousy Linda, the cop, and her macho husband Bill, the stripper.&nbsp; Finally, there came Jane and Greg.&nbsp; Loren noticed Kathleen eyeing them suspiciously throughout the evening.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After serving several rounds of drinks and mixing with each of the guests, Loren went to the empty end of the room and leaned against the couch.&nbsp; His feet were sore and he wanted to give them a break.&nbsp; Plus, he wanted a few moments to himself.&nbsp; As he sipped his martini, something he normally did not drink except he believed the dress called for it, Kathleen made her way over to him.&nbsp; She was smiling maliciously.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I've seen that look before.&nbsp; What are you up to, Kathleen?" Loren asked.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Just making a few observations about our friends, that's all."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Like what?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kathleen stood next to Loren and turned to face the crowd.&nbsp; She pointed at the man in the stewardess costume.&nbsp; "The stewardess has done this before."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How can you tell?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look how he handles the heels.&nbsp; He's almost as natural as you are.&nbsp; Look at his hand motions too.&nbsp; His nails aren't giving him any trouble.&nbsp; He's done this before."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What else?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Linda.&nbsp; Those handcuffs on her belt are real, those aren't costume handcuffs.&nbsp; Want to bet her macho husband, the stripper has been to her jail a time or two?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren chuckled.&nbsp; "Could be."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No 'could be' about it.&nbsp; Plus, look at how exuberant he is as a stripper.&nbsp; He's having a grand time playing the sissy in public. . . out and about as it were."&nbsp; She took a sip of her gin.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe he's just getting into the costume?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, that's for sure.&nbsp; You know what gives it away?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What?" Loren asked as he took a sip of his drink.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "His boner," Kathleen said matter-of-factly.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren spit out his drink, trying not to choke as he laughed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kathleen giggled and touched his forearm.&nbsp; "Forgive me, sweetie, I'm crude, I know, it's a bad habit.&nbsp; But I have been counting boners all night and he's had more than his fair share.&nbsp; He particular gets excited whenever he touches his wife's uniform."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren squinted and could indeed see a bulge in the skirt.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Boners never lie," Kathleen said.&nbsp; "They're like a male lie detector."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At this point, Stephanie came over.&nbsp; "What are you two girls chatting about all secretively over here?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Boners," Kathleen said, again causing Loren to choke on his drink.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie smiled.&nbsp; "Anyone's in particular?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Bill's mainly."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie looked at Loren and smirked.&nbsp; "I had no idea Laura was into 'boners,' I guess you learn something new every day."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren blushed.&nbsp; "I am not interested in. . . well, that."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie laughed.&nbsp; "There's one I know you're interested in," she said and she slid her hand across his crotch.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You two should get a room," Kathleen said.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They laughed.&nbsp; "In any event," Loren said, "I think you have an overactive imagination, Kathleen."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sweetie, I know my men," she retorted.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie smiled into her drink.&nbsp; "Ok, if you know your men, tell me about Loren."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you want to know?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie waved her hand up and down his body.&nbsp; "What do you make of this?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kathleen raised an eyebrow.&nbsp; "You want my honest assessment?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Absolutely."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's ok, Kathleen.&nbsp; Nothing to see here," Loren said nervously.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kathleen put her hand on his arm to quiet him.&nbsp; "Loren is a truly sweet man.&nbsp; He's also a beautiful woman, both on the inside and the outside, and you have found the perfect man for a husband.&nbsp; I envy you both so much and I wish you both the best, if that means Loren is Loren or Loren is Laura."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie and Loren stared at Kathleen with their jaws open.&nbsp; A tear appeared at the edge of Loren's eye.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kathleen finished her drink and smiled.&nbsp; "Of course, I'd keep the boy in a skirt for the rest of his life, but that's just me."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren and Stephanie burst out laughing.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Skirts for the rest of my life, that I could handle," Loren said.&nbsp; "But these heels are something else.&nbsp; They're killing me!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Welcome to womanhood, dear," Stephanie said and she kissed him on the cheek.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren was about to respond, but Kathleen cut him off.&nbsp; "A tigress approaches."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie and Loren looked up just as Jane appeared next to them.&nbsp; Jane looked nothing like a tigress.&nbsp; To the contrary, she wore tan slacks, which were obviously her own, a masculine white blouse, and a tweed jacket which was probably her own as well.&nbsp; A brown plaid tie hung from her neck.&nbsp; Her short hair was combed with a side-part and she wore no makeup of any sort.&nbsp; On her feet were wingtips.&nbsp; The overall effect was either a lesbian librarian caricature or a slightly effeminate male professor.&nbsp; This "costume" was actually what everyone expected as Jane was known for being quite staid.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Great party as always," Jane said.&nbsp; "Greg and I have really enjoyed it."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Thanks, Jane."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I came over because I wanted to get a close-up look at Loren.&nbsp; Everyone is talking about him and that dress."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It is a beautiful dress," Stephanie said.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No doubt, but I think people are more interested in how Loren looks so feminine in it."&nbsp; Jane looked Loren up and down several times.&nbsp; She seemed to focus particularly on the missing bulge between his legs.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Some girls are just lucky," Stephanie said with a laugh.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I couldn't imagine Greg would ever look so believable," she said, motioning toward her husband.&nbsp; He wore the tweed skirt which matched the jacket she wore, a white blouse, lipstick, clip-on earrings, tan hose and closed-toe brown pumps with a one-inch tan wedge heel.&nbsp; "You really have achieved something amazing, Loren."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We're thinking of keeping him this way," Kathleen interjected.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jane covered his mouth to hide her giggle.&nbsp; "That might not be a bad idea.&nbsp; Of course, your publisher might drop you, I suppose?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I doubt it.&nbsp; They don't care what I wear so long as I keep sending in books," Loren said.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Plus, if he loses his job, we can always put him in a frilly maid costume and rent him out," Kathleen said, causing Loren to blush.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jane imperceptibly blushed as well.&nbsp; "Well, I could certainly use a maid if you decide to go into that line of business.&nbsp; How about it, Loren?&nbsp; Want to come clean my house?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren smiled.&nbsp; "Yes, Miss Jane," he said sarcastically.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone laughed.&nbsp; As they did, the magician came over to see them.&nbsp; Then the knight.&nbsp; Soon, all the women and Loren were standing together.&nbsp; In the other corner were the men, who had begun to examine each other's costumes.&nbsp; Suddenly, the stripper and the stewardess both slipped out of their shoes and traded them.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The stripper's wife let out a laugh.&nbsp; "I knew it.&nbsp; It was only a matter of time."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The other women looked.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Give boys a new toy and they will play with it," said the knight.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Do you think we should break it up before they start stripping?" asked Jane.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hell no!&nbsp; If they do that, I'm whipping out my camera," said the cop.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Does anyone have a camera on them right now?&nbsp; I'd love to get a picture of this," asked the bullfighter.&nbsp; The boys were now busily trading various parts of their costumes and prancing about in an exaggerated manner.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You mean like this one," Kathleen asked and she held up her phone and took several pictures.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I want a copy of that," said the cop.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'll get you all copies."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What in the world are they doing now?" asked the bullfighter as two of the boys began comparing the size of their breasts.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Men!&nbsp; It's all about breasts, even when they're fake," said the pilot.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I think this deserves a round of applause, what do you say, ladies?" asked the cop.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A moment later, the women all broke into applause.&nbsp; A few even whistled.&nbsp; This caused the men to look highly embarrassed and they quickly traded back the various articles of clothing they had swapped.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Jane looked at each of the women and Loren.&nbsp; "I think I'm taking my husband home before he does something I'll regret.&nbsp; Stephanie, it's been fun.&nbsp; Thanks for inviting us.&nbsp; She moved around the semi-circle and kissed each of them on the cheek, including Loren.&nbsp; Then she headed toward the men.&nbsp; Soon the others followed.&nbsp; Every single one of them treated Loren as if he were just one of the women.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I guess I should collect Peter," Kathleen said, when she, Loren and Stephanie were the only ones left.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Before you go, Kathleen, I'm dying to know why you called Jane a 'tigress'?" Loren asked.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kathleen smiled.&nbsp; "Didn't you notice anything unusual about her?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Not really, no."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You didn't see the lines of her garterbelt?&nbsp; Or notice that her bra is leather?&nbsp; I saw the straps earlier."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren and Stephanie looked over their shoulders in Jane's direction.&nbsp; She was looking for her purse and her garterbelt straps were visible beneath her pants.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kathleen continued.&nbsp; "To the outside world, she's plain Jane, who looks so prim and proper you assume she can't say 'sex,' much less have it.&nbsp; But underneath, she's wearing exotic underwear.&nbsp; That tells me, she's a tigress ready to tear her man apart.&nbsp; And for the record, Greg's wearing a matching garterbelt and a matching leather bra, and he's very excited by it."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How do you know?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Like I said before, sweetie, the male lie detector.&nbsp; You boys are worse than dogs with their tails."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren laughed.&nbsp; "Does Peter know your theory on erections?&nbsp; He might be wise to learn to hide his."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kathleen smiled wickedly.&nbsp; "Oh, he hasn't had any tonight, I can assure you that.&nbsp; Not without this," she said, flipping her wrist over and showing them a key which hung from the bracelet on her wrist.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's that?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kathleen blushed, but simultaneously her smile widened.&nbsp; "The poor dear was terrified something might spring up, so to speak, so we bought a little something to prevent it.&nbsp; And without this key, he can't take it off."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You're a devious woman, Kathleen," Stephanie said with a hint of astonishment.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If you think I'm devious now, just wait till Peter finds out what he needs to do to get the key."&nbsp; She winked at Stephanie and Loren and walked off toward her husband.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie giggled.&nbsp; "I told you Peter was in trouble.&nbsp; I think her time with you has sparked something that Peter won't soon forget."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's hope he enjoys it."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It would be interesting to see, wouldn't it?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Steph, let's finish one adventure at a time.&nbsp; Always leave something for the sequel."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie laughed.&nbsp; "I thought the sequel was when I sold you off to some prince to join his harem?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wrong genre."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She hugged him.&nbsp; "Good, because I like having you around too much to give you up."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Everyone had finally left.&nbsp; Loren sat on the couch.&nbsp; The silver sandals lay on the floor before him.&nbsp; Stephanie was draped over his lap.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Let's clean up in the morning," she said.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren ran his fingers through her hair.&nbsp; "Deal."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So tell me, how was your first trip out before your friends?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren shrugged his shoulders.&nbsp; "They didn't know.&nbsp; They thought it was just a costume party, so it's hard to say this was my first trip out."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "True, but everyone treated you like a real woman.&nbsp; They treated the others more self-consciously.&nbsp; And the guys, they spent the night trying to put on an act.&nbsp; You were natural.&nbsp; Everyone noticed that, how natural you were."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah, that's true.&nbsp; I felt kind of natural, very comfortable. . . except for the heels."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The price of beauty, dear, the price of beauty.&nbsp; But all in all, I'd say we found out you can handle yourself well, and we found out our friends probably will accept you," Stephanie said with a smile.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You know what else we found out?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What?" Stephanie asked.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Kathleen's a sex fiend!&nbsp; She had sex on her mind from the moment she walked through the door and it never stopped.&nbsp; She interpreted everything through some strange sexual filter.&nbsp; Right now, I'd say she's got Peter tied to the bed and she's making him sign his soul away!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Kath's a trip.&nbsp; She definitely has her own take on the world."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You can say that again."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But she was right about you, that's for sure."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren shrugged his shoulder.&nbsp; Maybe she was?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Chapter 15: Lauren Chambers
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A few weeks later, Loren stood in front of the mirror.&nbsp; He wore only a pair of satin mules Kathleen had given him.&nbsp; Since that night when Stephanie suggested his chest was getting flabby, he had begun to pay close attention to his shape, and what he noticed concerned him.&nbsp; His hips had become so wide most of his clothes barely fit any longer.&nbsp; His arms and legs looked soft and small.&nbsp; His face looked softer as well.&nbsp; But the biggest change, the change he couldn't ignore, was the two small breasts hanging from his chest. . . yes, hanging.&nbsp; When he first noticed them, they were little mounds.&nbsp; Now they looked like little globes.&nbsp; Could Kathleen really be giving him hormones?&nbsp; He'd been wondering about this for weeks now.&nbsp; Could they really do this to him?&nbsp; And why hadn't he stopped her from giving him the pills yet?
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Loren poked and prodded himself, he heard Stephanie calling.&nbsp; She was in the kitchen getting ready to leave for work.&nbsp; He pulled on a short pink robe and made his way to the kitchen.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sit down, dear," she said.&nbsp; She wore a tan pantsuit she often wore to work.&nbsp; "I want you to get Kathleen to come over this morning.&nbsp; I think it's time we told her."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Told her what?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Told her about you."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She knows about me."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, she knows that you dress secretly.&nbsp; She does not know that you plan to become Laura."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren swallowed hard.&nbsp; He knew there would be no problem telling Kathleen, yet somehow this felt like a huge step.&nbsp; "Are you sure?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie laughed.&nbsp; "Loren, look at yourself.&nbsp; You're wearing only a robe and slippers and you still look entirely like a woman.&nbsp; We just can't hide you anymore, the time has come.&nbsp; And Kathleen will be the ally we need to make sure everyone else accepts this."&nbsp; She closed her briefcase.&nbsp; "Besides, I have a surprise for you and I need her here to see it."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What kind of surprise?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's a surprise, you'll have to wait."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What do you want me to do?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Just invite her over, as normal.&nbsp; I'll show up around eleven and take care of the rest."&nbsp; She kissed him on the cheek.&nbsp; "And wear something nice today."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren sat on the couch.&nbsp; He looked sedately feminine.&nbsp; He wore a champagne-colored pleated skirt with a silver floral pattern, a silvery blouse and nude pumps.&nbsp; His hair, makeup and everything else was perfect.&nbsp; No one would guess this was a man.&nbsp; Kathleen sat across from him.&nbsp; She wore black slacks and a red blouse.&nbsp; As they chatted about recent events, the front door suddenly opened.&nbsp; In walked Stephanie.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kathleen froze.&nbsp; "Loren, quick, hide!" she whispered as she shot out of her chair.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Kathleen, it's ok, stay calm," he assured her.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before she could move, however, Stephanie entered the living room.&nbsp; She walked over and kissed Kathleen on the cheek.&nbsp; "Kathleen!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Stephie!" she returned the greeting nervously.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You're probably wondering what's going on," Stephanie said.&nbsp; "I think Loren and I have been a little unfair to you, and I want to explain everything to you.&nbsp; I also want you to witness something."&nbsp; She pulled a set of documents out of her briefcase.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Witness what?" Kathleen asked cautiously.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Several months ago, Loren decided he wanted to become my little sissy."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I--" Kathleen began.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie held up her hand.&nbsp; "It's ok Kathleen.&nbsp; I've known all along."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have?!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes.&nbsp; What you didn't know was that Loren wasn't hiding anything from me."&nbsp; She waved her hand up and down Loren's body.&nbsp; "This is how Loren spends all his time now."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kathleen covered her mouth and laughed.&nbsp; She immediately put her hand on Loren's shoulder.&nbsp; "I'm sorry, sweetie.&nbsp; I'm not laughing at you, I'm laughing at myself.&nbsp; I should have known you couldn't hide the hair and the nails and the mannerisms from Stephie."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "We've decided that Loren is going to become Laura full-time now."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kathleen smiled at Loren.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie continued.&nbsp; "But there's more, and I want you to understand this because we need your help making sure Loren will be accepted by everyone."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Sure, I'd love to help."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie ran her tongue over her lips.&nbsp; "Here's the thing.&nbsp; Loren has really embraced the role of being submissive.&nbsp; In fact, it's gotten to the point that I can't honestly think of the last decision he made for us?"&nbsp; She looked at Loren, but he shrugged his shoulders.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Ok," Kathleen said.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In that regard, I have some papers here, which I want Loren to sign, and I need you to witness them."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What kind of papers?" Loren asked suspiciously.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie handed him several documents from the briefcase.&nbsp; "If you'd read to the end of the book, Loren, you would know that Candi makes Brandi sign over all their assets and then take her name--"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What book?" Kathleen asked.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'll explain later," Loren said.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That gave me an idea," Stephanie continued.&nbsp; "I don't want to 'own' you, and I'm not even sure that's legal, but I like the symbolism of Brandi being forced to take his wife's name.&nbsp; So I've asked an attorney to draw up documents that will change your name."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren gasped.&nbsp; "To what?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Lauren Chambers."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's your last name!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, it is."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But you took my name when we married?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, and now that you're my sissy, we're both taking my name.&nbsp; Consider it my gift to you because I know how much it turns you on to feel submissive, and what could be more submissive than a husband letting his wife rename him with a girl's first name and her own last name?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren felt his erection throb.&nbsp; The idea absolutely turned him on.&nbsp; It also wasn't lost on him that he was the only person in the room wearing a skirt and the only one wearing high heels, which turned him on even further.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie continued:&nbsp; "Think about the thrill, dear.&nbsp; From now on, every time someone asks you your name, you will be reminded of your new status as my little husbandette."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Is this blackmail?" Kathleen asked.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie laughed.&nbsp; "Hardly.&nbsp; Loren is free to say no at any time, but he won't.&nbsp; He like this too much."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So he can just get up and throw these documents away with no consequences?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie smiled.&nbsp; "Absolutely, and I'll still love him just as much."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren felt a tear run down his cheek.&nbsp; This was overwhelming.&nbsp; Kathleen saw this and started to object, but Loren stopped her.&nbsp; He wiped away the tear and signed the document.&nbsp; He handed it to Kathleen along with the pen so she could sign as witness.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kathleen looked at Loren.&nbsp; "Are you sure you want to do this?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He looked at her and smiled.&nbsp; Then he patted her hand.&nbsp; "Yes."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kathleen shrugged her shoulders.&nbsp; She'd seen it with her own eyes that Loren seemed happier this way.&nbsp; In fact, Kathleen told herself, she'd never seen the two of them more in love than they had been in the past few weeks, and Loren seemed to love being Laura.&nbsp; She took the pen and signed.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Loren watched as Stephanie pulled his drivers license from the briefcase.&nbsp; "Lastly, I'm sending this back because it won't be valid as 'Loren Candeze' anymore, and because I don't want you driving anymore.&nbsp; I don't think sissies should drive."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What about my car?" he asked.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm selling it.&nbsp; I've already posted the ad."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You could have consulted me," he said.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Laura, I could have. . . but I don't have to.&nbsp; See how that works, dear?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kathleen started to speak, but again Loren stopped her.&nbsp; She looked at him.&nbsp; "You really want this?&nbsp; You can still back out."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He smiled.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie looked at Kathleen.&nbsp; "I hope you understand now?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kathleen exhaled.&nbsp; "I think I do.&nbsp; It's just a lot to take in.&nbsp; I guess I knew in the back of my mind there was no way Loren was becoming so effeminate without you noticing.&nbsp; And he does seem to love it."&nbsp; She looked up.&nbsp; "And you don't mind that I've been. . .?" she left the rest unsaid.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie shook her head.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What happens now?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Now we introduce Laura to everyone, and let me start with you.&nbsp; Kathleen, meet my husband Laura," Stephanie said proudly.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Without saying another word, they all hugged each other.&nbsp; Loren, now officially Laura, felt his penis explode in his panties.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The following morning was Saturday, and Stephanie had invited Kathleen over for breakfast.&nbsp; The idea was that Loren would serve them both for the first time in his maid costume.&nbsp; Then they would take him shopping for clothes as a reward for his decision.&nbsp; As they sat in the kitchen chatting, Loren suddenly appeared at the door.&nbsp; He was naked except for a pair of white slingbacks.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look at me!" Loren whined.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Both women looked at his huge, erect penis.&nbsp; "Nice," they said in unison.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "That's not what I mean."&nbsp; He grabbed his breasts and held them up.&nbsp; "I've got tits!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie raised an eyebrow and giggled.&nbsp; "Boobs, dear.&nbsp; Women don't call them 'tits'."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You've been giving me real hormones, haven't you?!" he barked at Kathleen.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kathleen blushed.&nbsp; "I. . ."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren stamped his foot.&nbsp; "Those were real hormones, weren't they?&nbsp; And now I have boobs!"&nbsp; He sounded unhappy.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Laura, I have not been giving you hormones," Kathleen protested.&nbsp; "It was only a game.&nbsp; It was something I read on the internet.&nbsp; I thought you were enjoying it?&nbsp; I thought you knew?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Then what were they?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Just sugar pills."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Why would you give me sugar pills?" he demanded.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie rose from her chair.&nbsp; "Hold on!&nbsp; Somebody explain this to me from the beginning."&nbsp; She pointed at Loren.&nbsp; "What pills?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren took a deep breath.&nbsp; "A couple months back, Kathleen started making me take these pills.&nbsp; She said they were hormone pills."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But they weren't," Kathleen interjected.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Wait a minute," Stephanie said.&nbsp; "You took what you thought were hormone pills and you never told me about this?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren was temporarily stunned.&nbsp; "Uh. . . yeah," he said cautiously.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie folded her arms.&nbsp; "Go on."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "She made me take a pill each day."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You took a pill each day without telling me?&nbsp; For months?&nbsp; Even when you knew you had no right to keep secrets from me?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You keep secrets from me?" he protested.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm allowed, Laura.&nbsp; That's what being in charge is all about.&nbsp; I get to make decisions.&nbsp; I am extremely upset that you never told me about this.&nbsp; You had no idea what those pills could have done to you."&nbsp; She took a deep breath and shook her head.&nbsp; "I really am angry about this, Laura."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren bit his tongue and stared at the ground.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Go on, finish your story."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I. . . I guess, I noticed some changes a couple weeks ago, when you said I was growing breasts and said I might need a bra.&nbsp; So I've been paying attention and I swear my boobs are growing."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie walked over to Loren and grabbed his left breast.&nbsp; It was indeed flabby, maybe even enough to form little globes.&nbsp; She poked it and squeezed it, let it fall, and then poked it again.&nbsp; "Laura, I know exactly what this is."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You do?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She reached down and pinched his hip and then his rear.&nbsp; "Yes, I do."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If it's not hormones, what is it?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It's fat, dear.&nbsp; You've stopped exercising and you've been eating too much rich food now that you've learned to cook," she said calmly.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But I look like a girl?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You look more like a girl because you've added fat to your chest, to your butt and your hips.&nbsp; It makes you look soft.&nbsp; Add in the constant wearing of the corset and the bras and the hose and the girdles and you have been squeezed into a more feminine shape.&nbsp; But make no mistake dear, you are not shaped like a woman, you only fake it."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren looked down at his chest.&nbsp; "But my breasts are huge?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Maybe for a man, but they hardly rate for a woman."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't know what to say," he said softly.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "For one thing, I think you owe Kathleen an apology."&nbsp; She paused.&nbsp; "And for another, I think you owe me an explanation."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What kind of explanation?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I take it, you still haven't stopped taking these pills?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How did you know that?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Because this is clearly the first time you've had this conversation with Kathleen, which means you're still taking the pills right up through today."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren nodded his head.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "So for weeks now, you claim you suspected these were real hormones and that they were making you grow breasts, am I correct?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yet, you kept taking the hormones.&nbsp; Why?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren bit his lip.&nbsp; He shook his head and cast his eyes toward the floor.&nbsp; "I don't know."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I do, Laura.&nbsp; It's because you want breasts, isn't it?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren shrugged his shoulders.&nbsp; "I don't know."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "As in, 'I don't know' why I kept taking them, or 'I don't know' if I want breasts?" Stephanie demanded.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They waited in silence for some time before Loren spoke.&nbsp; "I guess, I don't know.&nbsp; I don't know if I want breasts.&nbsp; Part of me says it sounds great.&nbsp; But I don't want. . ."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Don't want what?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I don't want to do anything which makes you decide you don't love me anymore."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie's frown immediately fade.&nbsp; "Laura, honey, that could never happen.&nbsp; If you want boobs, I'm fine with that.&nbsp; It's not your body I love, it's you."&nbsp; She hugged him.&nbsp; "I'll tell you what.&nbsp; I'm going to call my friend the doctor and make an appointment.&nbsp; We can sit with her and she can explain exactly what getting boobs would mean.&nbsp; And if you want to do it, then we'll do it."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren smiled.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "But there's one catch," Stephanie said.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "If my husband is going to get boobs, I'm going to decide how big they're going to be.&nbsp; Understand?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yes, Miss Stephanie," Loren said with a smile.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie kissed him.&nbsp; "Now why don't you go finish getting dressed."&nbsp; She patted him on the rear, and he left.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm sorry, Steph," Kathleen said when he had gone.&nbsp; "It was only a game.&nbsp; I thought he knew that.&nbsp; I thought it might wake him up to the idea that he was better off as a woman.&nbsp; I didn't want to cause any problems."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie shook her head.&nbsp; "Don't worry about it.&nbsp; No harm, no foul."&nbsp; Suddenly, a glint appeared in her eye.&nbsp; "Besides, you may have done me a favor."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What favor?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Stephanie squeezed her chest.&nbsp; "Boobs."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Kathleen laughed.&nbsp; "You really like the idea?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Kath, I love the idea!&nbsp; How many women in the world have husbands with boobs?&nbsp; I can't wait to get my hands on them. . . to watch him slide on a bra because he can't go without. . . to see him jiggle when he walks.&nbsp; That would be incredible!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Meanwhile, the phone rang.&nbsp; Loren picked it up in the bedroom.&nbsp; It was Cindy, his agent.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Hi Cindy, how are you?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Great, Loren.&nbsp; How are you?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Same as always," he said in the softer tone Stephanie required.&nbsp; It had become second nature to him.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "You sound strange, do you have a cold?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "No, I'm fine."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How goes the new book?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren looked down at his erection and his heels.&nbsp; "I'm still doing research."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Forget the research, just jump right in!&nbsp; That's the best thing for writer's block!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'll keep that in mind."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "In any event, it's good you haven't started anything.&nbsp; Do you remember that thing I faxed you which listed the types of books that make the most money?"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Well, I'm embarrassed.&nbsp; Someone in the office was having a little fun at everyone's expense and they apparently created a fake draft, which then got faxed out."&nbsp; She paused.&nbsp; "Long story short, what you got is entirely wrong.&nbsp; The top five should be young adult, romance, speculative fiction, crime, and then thrillers.&nbsp; They most definitely are not whatever you were sent."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren's jaw dropped.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I'm just glad you didn't start anything before we caught this little joke.&nbsp; Another one of my clients actually took the list seriously and you wouldn't believe what he just sent me.&nbsp; He even spent a week dressing in women's clothes to research the book.&nbsp; Can you believe that?&nbsp; His wife is furious with him and probably me."&nbsp; She laughed.&nbsp; "Fortunately, you didn't fall for this stupid joke.&nbsp; Well, it won't happen again.&nbsp; We fired the intern who did it."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Loren smirked.&nbsp; All of this had been a mistake.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Anyway, I need to run.&nbsp; Get to work, Loren.&nbsp; I can't wait to read your next Louis Rock novel."&nbsp; She paused.&nbsp; "You know what might be interesting, now that I think about it?&nbsp; Why don't you try writing one with a female lead?&nbsp; That might make for an interesting change of pace."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "I just might do that.&nbsp; Thanks, Cindy."
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There it was.&nbsp; It frightened him to think how much his whole life had changed because of a mistake made by an intern.&nbsp; Yet, it excited him too, there was no denying that.&nbsp; And what excited him even more was what lay ahead.&nbsp; Only the first part of his story had been written so far.&nbsp; It was time to see what the future held.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To be continued. . .


Thanks to everyone for their comments and the vast number of e-mails.&nbsp; This is as far as the story originally went.&nbsp; I have, however, promised a sequel.&nbsp; Because of the clear split in the audience, I am currently planning to write two alternate sequels.&nbsp; One will be more sentimental.&nbsp; The other will delve further into the humiliation/dominance aspects of the story.&nbsp; It will probably be a couple months before I get those done, but hopefully you'll all enjoy them.

Love,
Ann
