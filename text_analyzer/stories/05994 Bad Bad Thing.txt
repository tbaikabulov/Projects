Synopsis: A lesson is learned the hard way.


Jayden arrived home before Carrie for the first time in two weeks. She parked her car outside and studied the house for a few minutes before she collected her book bag and went inside. As she set down her bag, she saw the sling that Carrie was supposed to be wearing casually tossed on the couch.

She shook her head at the sight. Jayden heard a car pulling into the driveway. Waiting by the door, she watched Carrie walk into the house with her left arm cradled against her body. She could see the pain that Carrie was in by the way she moved.

Jayden knew that body almost better than she knew her own. It physically hurt her to see her lover in pain. Shaking her head in disappointment, Jayden did not greet her lover with a word or gesture. She simply turned and walked to their bedroom to put her stuff away and change her clothes. When she came back downstairs, Carrie was wearing her sling again.

&#8220;That&#8217;s too little too late.&#8221; 

Carrie jumped at the flat statement. She watched warily as Jayden walked over to her.

Jayden dangled before Carrie the set of handcuffs that she had brought downstairs from their special toy box. Taking Carrie&#8217;s right wrist, Jayden gently secured the cuff and double locked it when it was snug but not too tight. She took the other end and connected it to the first belt loop on the left side of the button fly.

&#8220;I know that you are tired of being hurt but, by not wearing your sling as the doctor ordered, you&#8217;ve re-injured yourself.&#8221; Jayden put her fingers under Carrie&#8217;s chin and raised it so that brown eyes met green.

&#8220;Your primary job is to take care of me and to do that you need to care of yourself. Since you can&#8217;t be trusted to do that, I&#8217;m taking away the use of your other arm.&#8221;

&#8220;For how long?&#8221;

Jayden made her voice cold. &#8220;For as long as I feel is necessary. You hurt yourself, which means you hurt my property. You have to be punished for that, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;

Sighing, Carrie nodded.

&#8220;That&#8217;s not good enough.&#8221;

&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, ma&#8217;am.&#8221; Carrie wanted to explain or at least beg to be let go but she knew very well that Jayden&#8217;s mind was set. There was no way to change her plan until she decided the lesson was learned. She wondered just how hard could it be and then blushed when her stomach growled.

Jayden laughed and patted Carrie&#8217;s belly. She hid an evil grin as she thought of a way to make the lesson stick. 

&#8220;Well, since you can&#8217;t cook for me tonight, I&#8217;ll guess we will be forced to go out.&#8221;

Carrie&#8217;s jaw dropped in shock. &#8220;What?&#8221; she cried.

&#8220;Yes and while we&#8217;re out, I need to go shopping, too.&#8221;

&#8220;But&#8230;&#8221; Carrie rattled the short chain that locked her arm to her side.

&#8220;No buts about it. We&#8217;re going out and you are going to wear that cuff just the way it is.&#8221;

&#8220;But&#8230;&#8221;

&#8220;I could move the cuff so that it is no longer hidden under the sling. In that case, everyone we would pass would know exactly how bad you have been.&#8221;

Carrie was stuttering but Jayden traced her lips with her index finger. It was a clear sign that Jayden would hear no more about that or anything else. Carrie was not allowed to speak unless asked a direct question until Jayden released her.

Without further discussion, Jayden led the way to her car. She could not help humming at the way their evening was going.

Carrie was blushing hotly as she stood before the passenger side door. She prayed that none of their neighbors walked by or looked out their windows and saw her like this. She was helpless, so much so that Jayden had to assist her in sitting down in the car.

Considerately, Jayden protected the back of Carrie&#8217;s head as she eased her down into the seat. She deliberately rubbed across Carrie&#8217;s breasts as she secured the seatbelt and then locked and closed the door.

The drive to the Mall was completed far too soon for Carrie&#8217;s comfort. She trailed along behind Jayden. She kept her head down, as she was sure that she felt the weight of all the stares from the other shoppers. Her examination of the floor was interrupted by Jayden&#8217;s voice.

&#8220;You know, I really like being able to hold your hand when we go places.&#8221;

The disappointment was plain to hear and Carrie was filled with remorse. She also enjoyed being able to walk with her beautiful young lover on her arm and their enforced separation because of her stupidity was galling.

Jayden window-shopped for a while but she had a destination in mind. She loved shopping for panties and bras and generally enjoyed showing off her potential purchases for her lover. Jayden got a kick out of the way Carrie&#8217;s eyes would light up and her pulse would race as she watched Jayden model the skimpy underwear. Those trips usually ended with Carrie rushing her home and ravishing her.

This trip was going to be different, Jayden vowed silently. She was torn, though. Should she go to Victoria&#8217;s Secret where no one would blink at what she had planned or should she go up to Nordstrom&#8217;s instead? She thought the idea of a personal shopper would be the right touch to increase Carrie&#8217;s suffering.

She led the way into the large department store and made her way directly to the lingerie department. Casually, she patted her leg when Carrie lagged too far behind. 

Carrie saw the motion and gritted her teeth. She knew darn well what that sign meant, although it was generally her using it on Jayden. Glancing furtively around, she hurried to catch up. 

&#8220;May I help you?&#8221;

Turning, Jayden looked at the saleswoman. The personal shopper was middle aged with her hair slightly graying. She would be perfect for the plan. She was a woman but not too sexy, so Carrie would not have a coronary when the shopper touched her.&nbsp; &#8220;Yes, thank you. I need to be fitted for a bra.&#8221;

&#8220;Of course. Come right over here to the dressing room and take off your shirt and current bra.&#8221;

Jayden followed the shopper. She only had to raise her eyebrow at Carrie to have her moving along with them. 

With a smile, Jayden said, &#8220;Here, honey, hold my purse.&#8221; She held her purse out. &#8220;Oh, I forgot. You poor thing. Not being able to use your arms. Well, why don&#8217;t you just open your mouth and I&#8217;ll let you hold it that way.&#8221;

Carrie and the saleswoman looked at her in shock. Shaking off her stupor first, Carrie opened her mouth and took the straps between her teeth.

&#8220;Now, don&#8217;t mark the leather. You don&#8217;t want to have to pay for replacing it, do you?&#8221;

Carrie shook her head and stood there, feeling her panties dampen even further at the humiliation. This was one shopping trip that she was going to remember for a long time.

Without another word, Jayden stripped off her blouse and the lovely, yellow satin bra she was wearing.&nbsp; Standing there, proudly, in all her radiant beauty, she grinned at the women in front of her.

The saleswoman looked back and forth between the two of them. Finally, she remembered her commission and she sprang into action. With the long tape, she made sure to get enough accurate measurements.

When she finished, she handed Jayden a paper top. &#8220;Put this on and we can go out and find the style and color that you like.&#8221;

Jayden put on the flimsy covering and prepared to follow the saleslady out. Another evil thought came to her. She raised her hand in the stay position and was gratified to see Carrie obey immediately.

&#8220;You&#8217;re staying here. I want you to go stand in that corner until I&#8217;m ready.&#8221; Wagging a finger, she admonished, &#8220;No peeking!&#8221;

Carrie silently walked to the corner. She faced the scuffed wall and swallowed a mouth of salvia. Holding Jayden&#8217;s purse in her mouth was making her drool but she knew better than to let the bag fall. 

Alone in the dressing room, she squeezed her legs together and thought about some of the beautiful bras and panties that they had passed on their way through. She wondered what Jayden might find this time and nearly groaned when she heard her lover and the saleswoman return.

Fighting the urge to turn, she listened as Jayden put on the bra and then had her breasts poked and prodded and generally manhandled until the saleslady and she were satisfied by the fit, the style and color. Carrie was sweating over in her corner as she heard the two of them talk and giggle.

&#8220;Excellent. Thank you for your help,&#8221; Jayden finally said. &#8220;Would you mind going and ringing these up? I&#8217;d appreciate it if you could put them in a bag as quickly as you can.&#8221;

&#8220;Of course, ma&#8217;am. Will there be anything else?&#8221;

&#8220;Oh, no I think we&#8217;re done. We&#8217;ll meet you at the register.&#8221;

Jayden waited until the woman left and then she walked to Carrie. Roughly pulling the purse from her lover&#8217;s mouth, she grabbed the back of her neck and pulled Carrie down for a hard kiss. She forced her tongue past Carrie&#8217;s lips and only released her lover after she felt Carrie surrender to her plundering.

Wiping her lips daintily, Jayden turned and patted her leg. &#8220;Come on, girl. We must be going.&#8221;

Carrie swayed for a moment, her head spinning from the sudden kiss and feeling bereft when it ended. Her body was burning with need. She had no idea where Jayden was taking her next but Carrie knew that she would follow her anywhere.

Paying for the purchases, Jayden took the card that the saleswoman handed her. &#8220;Thank you. I&#8217;ll be sure to give you a call next time I&#8217;m in need.&#8221; Laughing at Carrie&#8217;s blush, Jayden took the bag and led the way back to the parking lot.

Jayden drove them to a nearby fast food restaurant. She looked over at her lover and the disapproving look Carrie was not able to hide.

&#8220;Had you done what you were supposed to, we would be home eating a nutritious meal. You know I don&#8217;t cook. It is your fault we&#8217;re ending up here.&#8221; Jayden drummed her fingers on the wheel. &#8220;Now, should we eat in or get it to go?&#8221;

Carrie opened her mouth but a quick look from Jayden had her closing it again.

&#8220;That wasn&#8217;t a question for you to answer. It is my choice and I choose the drive thru.&#8221; Jayden pulled around and placed the order. She knew exactly what to order for Carrie and she had to admit that she was finally starting to see what her lover got from ordering for the both of them when they went out to eat. It gave her a wonderful tingle between her legs to have such control.

The drive home was uneventful. Once there, though, Jayden quickly dispelled any hopes Carrie might have had about getting free. She placed the bag with their meal on the table and assisted Carrie to her knees beside the chair at the head of the table.&nbsp; 

Going into the kitchen, Jayden pulled a plate and a knife down from the cabinet and sat down. Carefully, she cut Carrie&#8217;s sandwich into several small pieces. Pouring out the ketchup, she dipped a fry and extended it out to her kneeling lover.

Carrie looked at the offering for a moment before leaning forward and taking it into her mouth. She chewed and looked at the hand Jayden still had out. 

&#8220;Lick my fingers clean after each bite.&#8221;

Obedience was becoming second nature to her and she lowered her head and stuck out her tongue.&nbsp; When they were clean, she watched as Jayden picked up a piece of sandwich and held it down for her to take.

After she had finished that bite, she had to watch while Jayden ate a couple of bites of her meal. Slowly, Carrie was fed her entire meal. Strangely, she didn&#8217;t feel slighted having to eat like this. She knew by the dreamy way Jayden was playing with her hair that her partner loved the feel of Carrie's mouth as she cleaned her fingers. 

Occasionally, Jayden would take a sip of water and lean over. Carrie had to dip her head back and open her mouth to receive the drink from her lover&#8217;s mouth. There was a little spluttering on the first mouthful but by the end of the meal, she was becoming an expert at this new way of consuming liquids.

When the meal was over, Jayden left Carrie on her knees while she quickly cleaned up the wrappers and empty ketchup packets. After wiping the table down, she tossed the sponge into the sink and grinned at her lover.

&#8220;Shall we go upstairs?&#8221;

Carrie nodded eagerly. &#8220;Yes, ma&#8217;am. Please.&#8221;

Helping her up, Jayden kept her hand on her lover&#8217;s ass as they ascended the stairs. When they arrived, she schooled her expression and looked sternly at Carrie.

&#8220;You know that I&#8217;m disappointed by your discourteous decision to hurt yourself again. That being said, I see no reason for you to slack off on tending to me.&#8221; Jayden put her hands on her hips. &#8220;Undress me.&#8221;

Carrie licked suddenly dry lips. She doubted her ability to take off all of her lover&#8217;s clothes with just her mouth. Looking into the green eyes and seeing that Jayden was not joking, Carrie dipped her head in a slight bow.

It was hard work. Opening buttons with her tongue and lips was difficult enough but unbuckling Jayden&#8217;s belt and taking off her socks was almost impossible. Carrie was sweating as she bent and bowed and kneeled in her efforts. 

Jayden made no effort to make her task easier. She even resisted raising her foot until Carrie had nuzzled her nose under it and tickled her. It was hard to stay so stern but she wanted Carrie to learn her lesson.

Frustrated and feeling like an awkward child, Carrie regretted more than ever that she couldn&#8217;t use her arms and hands. 

&#8220;Come on. I was planning on playing but we won&#8217;t be able to if this takes all night.&#8221;

Carrie tried to speed up but froze when Jayden spoke again.

&#8220;Don&#8217;t you dare tear anything or bite me.&#8221;

Carrie kissed the knee before her in answer and lifted her chin to take the band of Jayden&#8217;s panties in her lip-covered teeth. She had to work her way around Jayden&#8217;s body and was surrounded by the scents of her lover. As the panties made their slow descent to the floor, Carrie was pleased to note their soaked state. She must be doing something right for her lover to juice up like that.

When Jayden was finally naked, she stretched languidly. &#8220;Thank you.&#8221; She was finding it almost impossible to stay mad at her lover. Having Carrie serve as a body servant was just about the sexiest thing she had ever experienced.

Moving gently and carefully, Jayden slowly stripped her lover. She only unlocked the cuff from her lover&#8217;s belt loop. She kept the other cuff in place around Carrie&#8217;s wrist. Once Carrie was naked, Jayden put the sling back on her and led her to the bed.

Placing her lover on her back, Jayden took the empty cuff and latched it to the bed frame. She straddled Carrie and teased her with kisses all over her naked body. She enjoyed the feel of the soft skin under her lips and Jayden made sure to cover every inch.

Carrie was writhing on the bed. She tugged futilely at the cuff on her wrist as every molecule of her being wanted to be touching Jayden. She whined at being denied and tried to thrust her pelvis up to make contact.

As if that was a signal, Jayden slithered off to lie on Carrie&#8217;s right side. 

When Carrie looked at her angrily and opened her mouth to say something, Jayden shook her head.

&#8220;Close your legs.&#8221;

Carrie moaned but obeyed. She eyes were avid as she watched Jayden heft her luscious breasts in her palms before twisting the nipples slightly.

&#8220;Oh, it is so nice to have two working arms. Can&#8217;t you just see what you&#8217;re missing?&#8221;

&#8220;Please,&#8221; Carrie whispered.

&#8220;What do you want, pet?&#8221;

&#8220;Let me touch you.&#8221;

&#8220;How? You&#8217;ve hurt your arm and the doctor said you weren&#8217;t to use it for at least a month.&#8221;

&#8220;The other arm is fine!&#8221;

&#8220;Really? And how fine is it going to be if you&#8217;ve permanently hurt yourself?&#8221;

&#8220;I didn&#8217;t!&#8221;

&#8220;How do you know? You don&#8217;t know and you don&#8217;t get to touch me until I think you&#8217;ve really learned your lesson.&#8221;

&#8220;I&#8217;ve learned,&#8221; Carrie whined.

&#8220;No, you&#8217;re still trying to justify it. There are no excuses and there will be no playing until I say so.&#8221;

Jayden lifted her leg to rest it across Carrie&#8217;s body and stroked herself. She smiled evilly when Carrie pulled again at the restraints. She teased herself to the edge several times and even let Carrie lick her fingers clean once.

Suddenly, Carrie saw a gleam come into Jayden&#8217;s eyes. She watched fearfully as her lover jumped out of bed and went digging in the toy box.

&#8220;Ah, ha,&#8221; Jayden chortled as she held aloft Carrie&#8217;s strap-on. She swung it around her head and ignored the growl from her lover who did not like anyone else handling her girlcock.

&#8220;Don&#8217;t&#8230;&#8221; Carrie started to say.

&#8220;Not acceptable,&#8221; Jayden stated. She grinned at the stunned look on Carrie&#8217;s face. &#8220;I&#8217;m in charge now. Since you did not see fit to take care of yourself, you&#8217;ll just have to watch while I take care of myself.&#8221;

Jayden came back to bed. Instead of putting the harness around her own hips or around Carrie&#8217;s, she used the Velcro and buckles to secure it to Carrie&#8217;s thigh. She tugged it experimentally a few times before climbing onto the bed.

She opened her legs and held herself open with one hand. Very, very slowly, she lowered herself onto the silicone dildo. 

The sight of her lover taking the entire purple length into herself stunned Carrie. The ease with which she did so spoke of how aroused Jayden was. She watched Jayden&#8217;s eyes flutter closed and her hands glide up her torso to her breasts.&nbsp; When she tugged on her nipples, Carrie instinctively lifted her leg. 

Jayden&#8217;s eyes opened and glared down at her. &#8220;You stay still or I&#8217;m going to make things even harder for you.&#8221;

Stuttering, Carrie said, &#8220;I&#8230;I&#8217;m so&#8230;sorry. Please.&#8221; She swallowed and for the first time in their relationship said, &#8220;Mistress, please don&#8217;t punish me more.&#8221;

Jayden kissed the tips of her fingers and placed them on Carrie&#8217;s lips in acknowledgement of more than just the request. &#8220;Don&#8217;t move an inch and I won&#8217;t have to.&#8221;

Carrie nodded her head. She was about to explode and she used all her remaining control to lock her muscles into place.

Closing her eyes to center herself, Jayden started to ride the dildo. She lifted and lowered herself, adding a small twist at the bottom to hit her g-spot just right.&nbsp; Jayden could feel the heat of Carrie&#8217;s cunt on her knee. It was only millimeters from Carrie&#8217;s swollen clit. Jayden felt a surge of power, knowing how hard Carrie was having to fight to keep from rubbing against her.

Carrie groaned in awe at the sight. The light of the room reflected on the sweat that was starting to glisten on her lover&#8217;s body. Her breasts bounced as Jayden began moving faster. Up and down with the muscles of her thighs and tummy bunching and releasing. Jayden was just so beautiful that Carrie wanted to cry.

Unable to do anything but lie there while her lover took her pleasure, Carrie struggled with herself. She was at her Mistress&#8217;s mercy and she was powerless against the younger woman. For one of the few times in her life she welcomed the loss of control. It was only right after her actions that day.

Jayden got closer to her orgasm. She leaned forward placed her palms next to Carrie&#8217;s head. She kept thrusting the dildo into herself. Her body slid against Carries. The softness of Carrie&#8217;s skin and the feeling of their nipples as they brushed back and forth was almost more than she could stand.

Carrie was astounded at the sensation of her lover sleekly moving over her. She was panting in unison with Jayden and she opened her mouth, desperate for a kiss.

&#8220;Oh, oh. I&#8217;m so close. Oh, god.&#8221; Unable to form words anymore, Jayden moaned and shuddered in release. Under her, she could feel Carrie orgasm with her.

Shocked, Carrie looked up into Jayden&#8217;s eyes. She was afraid to see anger there but, instead, Jayden was laughing in genuine pleasure.

Jayden hugged her and whispered into her ear, &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry. That won&#8217;t be the last time I make you climax without touching you.&#8221;

Overwhelmed by the promise, Carrie shuddered again. She had no idea how her lover managed it but she loved her for being able to do so.

Jayden dismounted the phallus and curled up on Carrie&#8217;s right side. The orgasm took the last of her energy with it and she fell asleep with Carrie still locked up beside her.

It was hours later when she woke up. Jayden shivered. With no blankets covering their naked skin, they were both freezing. With a devilish smile, Jayden patted Carrie&#8217;s cheek to wake her up and got off the bed.

Confused that they were still playing, Carrie waited quietly while Jayden did her business in the bathroom.&nbsp; She stared at the ceiling and thought about her evening. She could not help but rub her legs together. As she did so, she started to feel her dominance rise with her arousal.

Carrie did not know that Jayden was peeking out at her. Once her lover started to wiggle, Jayden came back to the bed.

&#8220;Are you ready to be released, sweetie?&#8221;

Nodding, Carrie waited with barely suppressed impatience while Jayden took the strap-on off her leg.

&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not ready,&#8221; Jayden said as she started to roughly massage Carrie&#8217;s exposed skin. She was not gentle when she squeezed Carrie&#8217;s breasts and tugged on her nipples.

&#8220;Enough,&#8221; Carrie growled.

&#8220;Are you really in any position to make demands?&#8221;

&#8220;Let me go, Jayden.&#8221;

&#8220;Nope. Not yet.&#8221; Jayden wormed her way down the bed and began to tickle Carrie&#8217;s feet. She grinned when Carrie twisted her legs to protect the soles of her feet from attack.

Jayden loved the uneven wrestling match. Years of soccer had made Carrie&#8217;s legs very strong. Luckily, Carrie&#8217;s upper body was restrained. Otherwise, Jayden would not have been able to control the flailing limbs.

&#8220;Stop it,&#8221; Carrie laughed angrily. &#8220;I mean it, girl!&#8221;

Glancing up, Jayden saw that she had gone too far. Carrie was fully in dominant mode. She was also still tied up and Jayden enjoyed the frisson of fear that danced down her spine and made her juice.

Thrilled and frightened, Jayden weighed her options. She could let Carrie go and be play punished, which was not actually a punishment. Or, she could keep Carrie tied up until she got even angrier and perhaps then the punishment would not be so enjoyable.

Carrie wanted badly to be let up so she could ravish her pet. She could see by the stubborn set of Jayden&#8217;s jaw that she was going to refuse to release her.

Impudently, Jayden said, &#8220;Make me.&#8221;

&#8220;Pet, you better release me now or you will not be able to come or sit down for a week or longer.&#8221;

At Carrie&#8217;s secret name for her, Jayden started to sweat. She realized that the game was over and she climbed back up the bed and then released the cuff. 

Carrie gripped Jayden&#8217;s wrist tightly in her hand and pulled her close. She whispered, &#8220;You made the right move, pet, but too slowly. Now, you&#8217;re going to pay.&#8221;

Trying to escape, Jayden twisted in Carrie&#8217;s grip and ended up face down on the bed. She tried to get her legs up but had no chance of breaking the wrestling hold.

As a final act of defiance, Jayden wiggled her ass against Carrie. The jolt to her sensitive mound made Carrie laugh. Jayden knew then that Carrie was not really mad at her.

Carrie leaned over and nibbled on the back of Jayden&#8217;s neck, making Jayden tremble with desire. 

&#8220;Who has conquered whom?&#8221; Carrie mused. &#8220;I think I now get to have my wicked way with you.&#8221;

&#8220;I was just playing, Mistress,&#8221; Jayden pled. &#8220;I didn&#8217;t mean to be so hard.&#8221;

&#8220;I know that. However, you played just a little too long and took advantage of my handicap and my good mood.&#8221;

&#8220;Mistress, please don&#8217;t spank me. I&#8217;m still so sore from the other day.&#8221;

&#8220;You should have thought of that before.&#8221; Carrie knew that she did not want to whip her girl. She burned to fuck her and to fuck her hard. 

Picking up the strap-on, Carrie ordered, &#8220;Help me put this on.&#8221;

Jayden obeyed and had it secured onto Carrie&#8217;s hips faster than her lover thought possible. Looking at her lover standing with the large dildo in place, Jayden felt herself cream.

&#8220;Get on your hands and knees.&#8221;

The command made Jayden moan uncontrollably. She loved to be taken from behind. She quickly got into position on the center of the bed.

&#8220;You belong on your hands and knees awaiting my big dick, don&#8217;t you, pet?&#8221;

&#8220;Oh, yes, Mistress. Please use it on me. I want it so bad.&#8221; Jayden wiggled her ass invitingly.

Taking the invitation, Carrie slowly slid the dildo into Jayden&#8217;s wet and welcoming hole. 

Sheathed to the hilt, Carrie asked, &#8220;That feels good, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;

&#8220;Yes, Mistress.&#8221;

Carrie slowly withdrew until only the tip remained in Jayden&#8217;s pussy. She shoved back in and began to thrust. 

&#8220;You are my pet. My little slut. Aren&#8217;t you?&#8221; As Carrie spoke, she slapped Jayden&#8217;s ass.

&#8220;Yes. Yes.&#8221; Jayden&#8217;s head dropped down as Carrie sped up. She could hardly believe how quickly the tables had turned. &#8220;I&#8217;m yours,&#8221; she nearly shouted after a particularly hard slap.

&#8220;You need me to satisfy you, don&#8217;t you?&#8221; Carrie asked. Not waiting for a response, she laughed. &#8220;Don&#8217;t worry, pet. I&#8217;m going to give it to you good.&#8221; She could not keep her hands off Jayden&#8217;s beautiful ass and the continuous smacks made Jayden jerk in counterpoint to the thrusts.

Carrie could almost feel Jayden&#8217;s internal muscles tightening on her girlcock. There was enough natural lubricant for Carrie to continue to slide in an out with ease. By the quivering of her muscles, Carrie knew that Jayden was getting close.

As Jayden heated up, a bead of sweat trickled between her shoulder blades. Carrie eagerly leaned forward to lick it up. The feel of the soft skin and tense muscles under her tongue reminded her of what she had not been able to touch in far too long.

Carrie now knew better than to try and use her injured arm for what she wanted to do next. &#8220;Brace yourself,&#8221; she ordered.

Jayden locked her elbows and panted. She felt her orgasm approaching but she needed more. She moaned when she felt Carrie&#8217;s weight settle onto her back.

Deep inside her lover, Carrie made short thrusts. She knew that each one was stimulating Jayden&#8217;s g-spot. Reaching around, she used her good arm to play with Jayden&#8217;s hanging nipples.

She quickly moved her hand back and forth, ensuring that both nipples were erect and aching.

Jayden moaned and lifted her head for a moment. &#8220;Oh, God. Carrie, please.&#8221;

Smiling at the surrender, Carrie caressed her hand down Jayden&#8217;s body and through the short curly hairs on her mound. Her fingers slid along side Jayden&#8217;s labia and Carrie could not help but smile at the breathy response. 

&#8220;We&#8217;re almost there, sweetheart.&#8221;

Teasing Jayden with gentle tugs of her lower lips, Carrie finally walked her finger up just a bit until she could grip Jayden&#8217;s clit between her finger and thumb. Carefully, Carrie squeezed and released. 

&#8220;Don&#8217;t stop. If you love me, you won&#8217;t stop,&#8221; Jayden begged.

Her nod unseen by her lover, Carrie kept thrusting and squeezing Jayden&#8217;s clit. Suddenly, Jayden squealed in pleasure.

Carrie stayed in place as Jayden&#8217;s inner muscles milked her girlcock. She changed her motion on Jayden&#8217;s clit to a gentle stroking. After a few seconds, she bit down on the back of Jayden&#8217;s neck. 

Like the good pet she was, Jayden shuddered and came again and again. Her orgasm rolled through her like a mighty wave.

Jayden&#8217;s arms buckled and they both fell down onto the bed. 

Laughing, Carrie asked, &#8220;Can I stop now?&#8221;

Jayden could not talk yet but she nodded vigorously. 

Carrie eased out and tumbled onto her back. Like a kitten, Jayden curled up under her arm and purred when Carrie hugged her tight. 

They were both nearly asleep when Jayden&#8217;s hand suddenly trailed down Carrie&#8217;s body. She wiggled her fingers under the leather and between the base of the dildo and Carrie&#8217;s soaking wet mound.

In just a few strokes, Jayden&#8217;s marvelous fingers brought a shout to Carrie&#8217;s lips and a climax to her body. Jayden unbuckled the straps and pulled up the blanket to cover them both without ever opening her eyes.

She mumbled, &#8220;This teaching stuff is hard work.&#8221;

Carrie laughed placed a final kiss on Jayden&#8217;s forehead. &#8220;Rest assured, my girl. The lesson was learned.&#8221;

&#8220;Does that mean I can&#8217;t do this again?&#8221;

&#8220;We will have to see about that.&#8221;
