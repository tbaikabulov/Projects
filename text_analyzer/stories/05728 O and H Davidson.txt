o and H. Davidson

&nbsp;

The front gate buzzer rang and, as usual, it startled me. i went to the intercom, �Hello?�

&nbsp;

�Hi, o, it�s Steph and Scott. Can
we come in?� i could tell by her voice that Stephanie was
excited.

&nbsp;

�Sure.� i pushed the button opening the driveway gate, and
opened the front door. Stephanie came running up the driveway and we hugged on
the front porch. Scott was further back riding a motorcycle toward the garage
door.

&nbsp;

�What�s with the motorcycle?� i asked.

&nbsp;

�That�s why we came by. Scott bought it this morning.� Steph enthused. 

&nbsp;

Scott put the stand down and came over and gave me a hug.
�What do you think, o, isn�t it beautiful?� He was obviously very excited.

&nbsp;

�i guess it is, but you know, i�m not really much of an expert on motorcycles, but��

&nbsp;

Scott cut me short, �Do you want to go for a ride, o?�

&nbsp;

�Scott, you know i can�t get dressed, and if��

&nbsp;

He interrupted again, �You wouldn�t have to. Look, if you
sit close no one would even know you are nude, and we wouldn�t, like, go
through town, or anything. Come on, o, please.� Scott seemed almost to be
pleading.

&nbsp;

�But i�ve never even ridden on a
motorcycle��

&nbsp;

�It�s easy, isn�t it Steph, just
hang onto me and lean when I lean. Come on o, you�ll
love it.� Yep, now he was definitely pleading.

&nbsp;

�Well, okay, but not too far, okay?�

&nbsp;

�Sure, o. But you will have to wear the helmet; it�s the
law.� Scott was really excited now.

&nbsp;

�Okay, i guess Master wouldn�t want me to break the law, and
I�m sure you wouldn�t want to be stopped by a cop having a naked slave on the
back of your bike.� i put on Stephanie�s helmet. i was
definitely not as enthused as Scott, but it seemed like it could be fun.

&nbsp;

Scott started the bike, and i got on the back. Stephanie
told me to sit right up tight behind Scott, wrap slave�s arms around him and
just lean with him.

&nbsp;

We went slowly toward the gate to give it time to open and
then out onto the street. Scott started slowly, to let me get used to it, and
then gradually got faster and faster. i must admit
that it was pretty exciting with the wind blowing over slave�s naked body.
Scott was as good as his word; he stayed on back streets for about ten miles. i know it was ten miles, because that�s how far it is from
Master�s house to the college, and that is where we ended up. At the guard�s kiosk,
Scott turned around, and headed back to Master�s house.

&nbsp;

We passed a lot of people. i don�t
know if they thought i was wearing a thong bikini, or� didn�t look, or just didn�t care, but we
attracted a surprising lack of attention. A couple of cars came up behind us,
and then passed us, (Scott was careful to go the speed limit), people did yell
things, but i couldn�t make out what.

&nbsp;

When we got back to Master�s house, Stephanie stepped in
front of the electric eye to open the gate. i could
see on her face that something was wrong. Then i saw Master�s car in the
garage. Scott stopped the bike and i got off, took off Steph�s
helmet, and handed it to her.

&nbsp;

�o, go in the house.� It was
Master�s voice. He was on the porch, but i hadn�t seen Him.

&nbsp;

�Yes, Master. May i speak?� i tried to sound pathetic, but
Master wasn�t buying it.

&nbsp;

�No, go inside and wait for me in the playroom.� Master�s
voice suggested that there was to be no debate.

&nbsp;

Master didn�t say a word while i walked to and through the
front door. Later i learned, from Steph, that He told
them that He did not want to embarrass them by reproaching them in front of me.

&nbsp;

Steph confessed that she was so
upset she�s not sure exactly what He said, but it was something about what a
dumb stunt that was. He admitted He didn�t know Scott that well, but He
expected more common sense from Stephanie. Scott interjected that i hadn�t worn
anything except the helmet which was required by law.

&nbsp;

Master told him that that was the point, exactly. What if
Scott had tipped over the motorcycle; what good was a display slave with scars
all over her body? He told Stephanie that she was going to see the consequences
of her thoughtlessness, and she could include Scott if she wished. He told her
to be at The Roundup at 9:00
that evening; no excuses.

&nbsp;

He left them and came into the house where His very
frightened slave was waiting. i haven�t been
disciplined in quite awhile, but i was sure that i would be today. Master sat
in His easy chair and instructed me to kneel in front of Him.

&nbsp;

�What were you thinking, o?� He demanded.

&nbsp;

�i guess i really wasn�t thinking,
Master. Scott was so excited about his new motorcycle and he said i didn�t have
to break any rules, like getting dressed, except for the helmet, and that�s the
law, so i thought you would be okay with that, and we were only gone about a
half hour and�� i was rambling and i knew it.

&nbsp;

�o, stop it. This is not about
breaking rules. What if Scott had dumped the bike; besides possibly getting
badly hurt, do you know what you would look like?� He was sounding very serious
and scary.

&nbsp;

�i guess that wasn�t very bright,
was it Master?� i tried to sound like the little girl scolded, but He wasn�t
buying that either.

&nbsp;

�No, o, it wasn�t, and I am going to impress upon you, and
Stephanie, just how stupid that little adventure was. Go into your room and
wait.� i knew that couldn�t be a good thing. slave�s
room is used for exercise, training, and discipline, and i had a pretty good
idea which it was going to be this afternoon.

&nbsp;

i stood in slave�s room for what
seemed like hours. i have no idea how long it really
was because the only time pieces in there are timers; no clocks. Finally,
Master came in.

He took slave�s wrists and fastened the cuffs to a chain
hanging from a beam in the ceiling. When He removed slave�s three-inch soled
mules, i was on tip toes, and stretched about as much as i could stretch.

&nbsp;

Master went to the cabinet and picked a bamboo cane. He
walked around me and stopped in front of me. �o, do
you understand why I am so upset and disappointed in you?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Master, because i might have disfigured Your display slave.� my voice cracked with emotion, and
fright. i knew this cane well.

&nbsp;

�Yes, that is certainly part of it, but you could have been
seriously hurt and the more so because you were naked, if you had��

&nbsp;

�But, Master, Scott was very careful, and�� that was a
mistake, and i knew it instantly. A slave does not interrupt slave�s Master,
especially when He is already pretty pissed off. 

&nbsp;

�Be quiet, o.� His voice was very controlled but i could
tell that He was seriously upset with me.



�I haven�t had to discipline you in some time, so just as a
reminder, you count the strokes to yourself, and thank me at every fifth
stroke. Do you remember o?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Master, i remember very well, Master.� i also
remembered that if i was to receive just a few strokes, He would have
instructed me to thank Him every stroke, every fifth stroke was for a more
intense discipline. It might be a long afternoon.

&nbsp;

Master began slowly, and, i can�t really say lightly, but it
did get worse; a lot worse. He started so slowly that i almost wanted to
scream, �Come on let�s get on with it and get it over with.� But, of course, i didn�t. He took me from stinging like a swat with a fly
swatter, just enough to wake the endorphins and let them know i would be needing them soon, to gasping pain, into the
zone that i sometimes get into, and finally to fainting. 

&nbsp;

The session must have lasted for almost two hours. i know this because Scott mentioned, as we were about home,
that it was almost 5:30,
and when Master finished with me, it was past seven thirty (i sneaked a peek at Master�s watch). There
were pauses, of course, but none long enough for me to really get slave�s
mental equilibrium. 

&nbsp;

When it was over, slave�s body looked like a zebra or a
tiger, but instead of black stripes like a zebra, slave�s were red or purple.
Between slave�s arm pits and knees, i was covered with stripes the width of
Master�s cane. If i had had the presence of mind, i could have counted the strokes
pretty quickly. Master uses the cane to make tally marks on slave�s skin; you know, four welts one direction and then one diagonally
across the first four. That fifth one always hurts a little (okay, quite a bit)
more because it crosses the other four, and makes it easier to remember to
thank Master on that stroke.

&nbsp;

i was in Master�s arms, when i
recovered, but reclining on the floor. He helped me to slave�s feet, and took
me to the mirror. i could hardly walk. i hurt all over, not just where the cane had struck, but
everywhere, from slave�s head to slave�s toes, inside and out.

&nbsp;

Master stood next to me in the reflection of the mirror, and
asked, �Is this adequate to impress upon you not to go on motorcycle rides
without sufficient protection, o?�

&nbsp;

slave�s voice crackled with emotion
as i answered, �Yes, Master, i am so very sorry that i disappointed you. i hope to never do it again.� And believe me, i meant every
word.

&nbsp;

Master instructed me to assume the standing position facing
the mirror, and left me there for, i would guess, fifteen to twenty days, okay,
minutes. Upon returning, Master gave me the mini dress that has a strip of
stretch lace at the top that fits under slave�s arms, and holds the dress up.
He instructed me to put it on. The stretch lace felt like a band of barbed wire
around me over the marks of the cane. The hem is about three inches below
slave�s sex so some welts were clearly visible below the dress and a few just
above the lace strip. Of course, the dress is so sheer that all the welts were
visible to anyone looking closely.

&nbsp;

i was instructed to wait on the
porch. The cool air felt like fire on slave�s fresh welts. Master brought out
the car and instructed me to get in. It was all i could do to walk to the car. i couldn�t imagine how i was going
to sit down.

&nbsp;

It was worse than i thought. i
lifted the skirt so that slave�s bare ass would be on the leather, and when i
sat, i screamed so loud that i�m sure the neighbors
could hear. i tried to settle in, but there was no
comfortable position. The eight mile ride to The Roundup was total torture.
There was absolutely no way for me to sit comfortably, so, with Master�s
permission, i rode part of the way supporting slave with slave�s arms so that
slave�s butt didn�t rest on the seat. 

&nbsp;

i guess i should explain that The
Roundup is a bar that caters to motorcyclers and
students from the local college, and does so with a limited amount of
confrontation. 

&nbsp;

When Master parked the car in the lot, He came around,
opened the door and helped me out. Even walking was painful, and the fifty or
sixty feet to the door of the bar was agony.

&nbsp;

As W/we walked in, i spotted Stephanie at a table with
Scott. Master led me to where they were seated, placed a 9x12inch envelope on
the table, and sat down. i was so focused on slave�s
pain that i hadn�t noticed the envelope before. Master addressed Steph, �Thank you for meeting U/us, Stephanie.� And then
me, �It is probably too painful for you to sit, o, so why don�t you go into the
lady�s room and wait for instructions.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Master.� i�m not sure just
how i got to the restroom between the pain of walking and the fear of what was
coming. But i walked into the restroom and waited.
After a few minutes Stephanie came in with the envelope. In an emotion drenched
voice she apologized, �I am sooooo sorry, o. I had no
idea that a quick bike ride would end like this.�

&nbsp;

i tried to reassure her, �That�s
okay, Mistress Stephanie, you couldn�t know.�

&nbsp;

Steph half whispered, �Steven told
me to tell you to take off your dress and put it in this envelope, and you are
to wear the sign that�s in it, and hand one of the informational sheets to each
person who comes in here.� She opened the envelope and took out a light weight,� 81/2x51/2 piece of
white cardboard on which was printed, �What can happen when you ride a
motorcycle naked!� Master had apparently printed it on His computer. The sign
had a little string attached to the top corners. Steph
stepped behind me, positioned the sign just below slave�s collar and tied the
string at the back of slave�s neck.

&nbsp;

The sheets of paper in the envelope had �safety tips� for
motorcyclists apparently printed from an internet site.

&nbsp;

i removed slave�s dress, folded it
and put it in the envelope. i could see a look of,
almost, terror on Steph�s face as she saw, clearly
now, the extent of slave�s caning. �Oh, dear god, o. i know you say that your
whippings are usually almost as erotic as they are painful but��

&nbsp;

�Yup, this one moved fairly quickly to and through the
erotic stage and settled in on the painful. i actually
passed out this time.� i realized how scary that might sound to Steph, so i quickly added, �But Master was there, taking
care of me, when i recovered. i�ll
be just fine, but i may not sit down for a few days� or months.�

&nbsp;

Steph took the envelope and
whispered, �I�m so sorry, o; I�ll be right back.� She turned and walked out the
door.

&nbsp;

While she was gone, i quickly counted the number of sheets.
There were twenty-five or thirty. i didn�t get an
accurate count because i still wasn�t functioning at one hundred per cent.

&nbsp;

Steph came back without the
envelope. �Mistress Stephanie, did Master say i had to give away all of the
sheets? There are, like, thirty sheets here. i don�t
think there were thirty people out there, much less thirty women.�

&nbsp;

i could hear how difficult this was
for her, by Stephanie�s voice, �I�m sorry, o. He said you had to give them all
away. Only one per person and if you ran out of women, you could go to the
men�s room. I�m so sorry, o. I can�t tell you��

&nbsp;

i interrupted her, �Would you cut
it out, this is not your fault. There was no way�� i stopped at the sound of
the door opening. Two women, walked in. From their attire, i guessed they were
bikers. i watched the lips of one move as she read the
sign around slaves neck, while the second just stared. The first said, �Shit
girl that doesn�t look like road rash to me. How the hell did you do that?�

&nbsp;

slave�s voice sort of squeaked, �It
isn�t road rash, Mistress. This is what Master did to me because i rode naked
on a motorcycle. i guess that is what the sign means.�

&nbsp;

The second woman asked, �What do you mean, you �guess that�s
what the sign means?��

&nbsp;

�Master just��

&nbsp;

Steph interrupted, �Her Master
caned her, and then had me put that sign around her
neck. She is supposed to give everyone who comes in here one of those.� She
nodded her head toward the paper sheets in slave�s hands.�

&nbsp;

i offered a sheet to each woman.
�Please, don�t throw it away until you are in the bar so that Master can see
that i have given it to you� please.�

&nbsp;

The second women stepped closer and ran her hand over the
welts on slave�s hips. i winced at the pain of her
touch. She gasped, �Hay suce, those are some mean frickin� welts. I guess that collar, and rings,
and stuff, is serious shit with you, uh?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Mistress, it is very serious.�

&nbsp;

�Well, better you than me, babe.� The two women did what
they came in for, and left holding their informative sheets.

&nbsp;

Almost immediately two more women came in, and did not seem
surprised to see me. i guessed that the first two
women told these two to go see the show in the bathroom.

&nbsp;

These two were obviously bikers. They wore leather from neck
to toes. �Holy crap, girl, that�s why you wear this shit.� One admonished,
indicating her leathers, �But you didn�t get that fallin�
off no bike.�

&nbsp;

i could
feel the emotion building up inside me. slave�s eyes
began to tear, but i was determined not to actually
cry, or bawl, which is what i really felt like doing.

&nbsp;

�No, Mistress, i got these because i rode naked on a
motorcycle, but the marks, themselves, were made by a cane in the hand of
slave�s Master.� i just wanted to cry and this was only sheets three and four.
�Please, take one of these, and take it back to your table with you so that
Master can see that i gave it to you.�

&nbsp;

�Sure, Doll, we�ll play your kinky little game.� These two
left without actually using the facilities; apparently they came in just for
the entertainment.

&nbsp;

�How are you doing, o, you wanna
sit down? Oh, god, that was stupid, of course you don�t want to sit down. I�m
sorry, o� Steph�s face was tomato red.

&nbsp;

�Mistress Stephanie, if you say you�re sorry, one more time,
i�ll scream. i�m
doing just fine considering that i am a walking cane welt, on display, naked,
in a bar�s bathroom. How many more women do you suppose are out there?� 

&nbsp;

�I don�t know; I�ll look.� As Steph
went out, three young college girls came in.

&nbsp;

They had obviously not been warned. The
first one to see me all but screamed, �Holy crap. Are you okay? What the
fuck happened?� Then she started to read, �What can happen when�you didn�t do
that in a bike accident?�

&nbsp;

�No, Mistress, i went for a motorcycle ride naked, and this
is Master�s way of showing His displeasure. Would you each, please, take one of
these sheets back to your table so that Master can see that i gave it to you,
please.� i pleaded.

&nbsp;

One of the other two women spoke, but not
to me, �Oh� my�god! You know who this is?! Have you guys heard the
rumors about a �slave girl� who goes around naked or practically, and lives
around here. Everybody in school has heard about her, but I never believed it.
I thought it was like the Loch Ness monster or somethin��
Now she addressed me, �You�re her, aren�t you? You�re the naked slave girl.�

&nbsp;

��Yes, Mistress, i
guess i am, although i suppose there could be another one��

&nbsp;

The three women laughed, �Oh sure, right! Wait �til I tell
Brett. I told him he should come tonight.�

&nbsp;

Two of the girls did what they came in for; the third walked
around me and asked, �What does it feel like to be beaten like that?�

&nbsp;

i paused for a moment and then
offered, �Mistress, it can be pretty erotic if it is done right, and Master
knows how to do it right. But it can be pretty god awful, if that is His
intention, and this evening that was His objective.�

&nbsp;

�And,� so� you� like� just stood
there� and, like, let him do this to you?� she seemed incredulous.

&nbsp;

i tried to explain, but knew it
wasn�t really possible. �It is not possible to take this evening out of context
and understand it. As your friend determined, i am a slave and He is slave�s
Master. So i didn�t �just stand there and let Him do it�. i
gave Him permission years ago by accepting Him as slave�s Master. Master almost
never whips me just for the hell of it. Predominantly, like today, when He
disciplines me, it is with cause.� 

&nbsp;

�There isn�t enough �cause� in the frickin�
world that would persuade me to let anyone do that to me!� the tone of her
voice provided the exclamation mark.

&nbsp;

The other two women finished their business; each took an
info sheet and started for the door. The one who didn�t need to use the
bathroom turned back, asking, �Do you have to give them all away? How many are
there?�

&nbsp;

�About thirty.� Slave�s voice did
not exude confidence.

&nbsp;

�There aren�t anywhere near thirty women out there; what if
you��

&nbsp;

Knowing where that was going, i
interrupted, �Master said that i would have to go to the men�s room if i failed
to give them all away here.�

&nbsp;

�Oh, my god� the three chorused as they left the bathroom
giggling.

&nbsp;

Steph returned and broke the bad
news that there weren�t even a dozen women in the bar, including the bartender.
We waited in the ladies� room for what i�m sure was
shorter than the days it seemed to me to be. Finally, slave�s curiosity
triumphed over slave�s patience. �Steph, how many
women do you think are out there now, and aren�t they drinkin�
any beer?�

&nbsp;

�I don�t know, o, I�ll go look.� She went out and came back
almost instantly. �Oh my gawd, o.
The place is packed with college guys. I bet those bitches called every guy
within miles. I�m so sor��

&nbsp;

At that moment there was a knock on the door. Steph opened it. �Steven.�

&nbsp;

�Are you two alone in there?�

&nbsp;

�Yes... We were just��

&nbsp;

Master stepped around Stephanie and came to me. He clipped
one end of a leash to the ring in slave�s collar. �o,
W/we are going home, but before W/we get to the front door I expect you to have
given all of those sheets away. Do you understand?�

&nbsp;

�Oh, yes, Master. Thank you, Master.�

&nbsp;

Master led me past Steph and out
the restroom door and down the short hall. When W/we entered the bar itself, i could see that it was packed with college guys and the
three women, two still on their cell phones, probably calling up
reinforcements.

&nbsp;

Suddenly someone yelled, �pussy�
and then the bar broke into a chant of �pus-sy, pus-sy, pus-sy.� slave�s knees
buckled, but i caught Master�s arm and held slave up.
Now i remembered the info sheets. i handed one to the
guy nearest me, then another. The chanting died down, and i
could hear men yelling things, but it would be later in the evening, at
Master�s home, before i would know what most of them
were. Master and Scott and Stephanie would have to remind me, because i was in one of those erotic fogs i get into.

&nbsp;

Master led me along the bar which was two-deep with college
guys. i handed each guy a
sheet. Some took it very politely, some with a word or two, generally about
slave�s �nice tits� or �smooth pussy� etc. One guy gave slave�s butt a little
slap that would have been nothing on an un-caned behind, but it elicited a
screech tonight. He just laughed.

&nbsp;

One guy took the sheet and said, �You do this for money,
right? How much?�

&nbsp;

I said, �i
beg your pardon, Sir, but i do it for love.� The man
was probably five or six years slave�s junior but the rules are i call all men Sir. He just shook his head.

&nbsp;

One guy that looked like the typical computer geek, or an
accounting major, took the sheet and in a very weak voice asked, �Can I feel
your cunt?�

&nbsp;

That kind of caught me off guard. i hate that word but i
looked at Master and He nodded, so i said, �Yes, Sir,
please do,� and spread slave�s legs a little further apart. He reached down and
wiped his hand over slave�s sex. i
squirmed a little more than a little as his hand crossed the marks of Master�s
cane. The geek took his hand and wiped slave�s juice on the face of the guy
next to him, saying �See, I told you she�s getting� off on this. Pay up Dude� 

&nbsp;

One guy took the flyer with one hand and squeezed slave�s
breast with the other. He squeezed so hard that slave�s knees buckled and
Master had to grab me to keep me from falling onto the floor.

&nbsp;

One of the women started to reach between slave�s legs, but
Master wagged His finger at her and she relented.

&nbsp;

Before W/we reached the end of the bar, by the door to the
outside, i had given out all of the information
sheets. Master asked Cari, the bartender, what He
owed her and she replied, �These guys will more than make up for your tab;
we�ll call it even. And, hey, any time you, and
she, want to stop by, you are more than welcome; ANY TIME.� Master thanked her, left a twenty on the bar and
led me to the door.

&nbsp;

i didn�t realize how hot and
flushed i had gotten until W/we went out the door. It felt as if W/we walked
into a meat freezer and it just isn�t that cold this time of year. As W/we
walked toward the car, Master asked Scott and Steph
to stop by His house for a drink on their way home.

&nbsp;

Steph answered for both, �Oh, we
would love to, thank you, Steven.�

&nbsp;

Master warned that they might beat U/us home because He was
going to take the long way just to be sure that no one got the idea of finding
out where the, now confirmed to be real, slave girl lived. i
looked over slave�s shoulder and saw about a dozen guys and three girls
watching us walk to Master�s car.

&nbsp;

He opened the door and i got in. With all that had gone on,
i had, incredibly, sort of forgotten about the welts until slave�s ass hit the
leather and i screamed again. Master allowed me to support slave�s weight with
slave�s arms. 

&nbsp;

Master started His car and, sure enough, two sets of guys
went to their cars. But i guess they just needed to get back to school, and
their homework, or something, because after a couple of blocks they turned
toward the college.

&nbsp;

At home Master swiped His card and Scott and Stephanie, who
had, in fact, arrived first, followed U/us through the gate. i
got out of Master�s car and assumed slave�s position in the spotlight, at the
front door, joined by Scott and Steph. Momentarily
Master opened the door and invited us in. W/we went into the playroom. i took drink requests, and
prepared the drinks and some salmon and cheese and crackers.

&nbsp;

When i entered the playroom, Master was quizzing Scott and
Stephanie, �So, after sharing o�s discipline, may I
assume that you will be a little more sensitive to what is, and is not,
expected of her?�

&nbsp;

i set the tray of food on the table and presented the tray
with Master�s sparkling wine which He took, then Scott�s beer and Steph�s wine and then i took slave�s sparkling wine. 

&nbsp;

Master allowed that i could kneel by Him in any position
that was comfortable. i suggested that comfortable was
probably not an option tonight, but thanked Him and kneeled on slave�s legs
without resting slave�s butt on slave�s heels, which would have been normal.

&nbsp;

Steph sounded very sincere, �Oh,
yes, Steven. I can�t tell you how sorry we are. We just didn�t think. Was it
just horrible, o? I don�t know how you could stand the whipping and then the
humiliation at The Roundup��

&nbsp;

�Well, technically speaking, i guess i really didn�t �stand�
the caning since, actually, i fainted, but��

&nbsp;

Steph cut me short, �How many strokes
did you get, o?�

&nbsp;

�i don�t know. When i get excited some things escape me��

&nbsp;

�Stand up o.� Master instructed. �You can count them
Stephanie, as you can see they are in groups of five.�

&nbsp;

Steph began to count, Five, ten,
fifteen, twenty�� Master had me turn as necessary. ��sixty-two. Oh, my god, o,
how could you do it?� i couldn�t quite tell if it was horror or awe, or both,
in Steph�s voice.

&nbsp;

�Master is very good at pacing me. And, actually, your count
doesn�t include the early strokes that didn�t leave marks. Those strokes just
sort of establish the mood and help me build up to the serious ones.�

&nbsp;

Steph was full of questions
tonight, �What were you thinking in The Roundup? You were so brave. Didn�t you
just want to die when they started chanting �pussy�?�

&nbsp;

�That�s another case where slave�s selective memory comes in
handy. i hardly remember it. i remember someone shouting �pussy� and then a
kind of rhythmic chant, but not so much what they were chanting.�

&nbsp;

�Did you hear the guys saying how gorgeous you were? And
what a fantastic body you have? And how much they wanted to fuck you? And one
guy who said Steven must be the richest and/or luckiest guy in the world,
because if you would do what you did tonight, there can�t be anything you
wouldn�t do.�

&nbsp;

i couldn�t keep from giggling a little. �Well, i�m pretty sure Master isn�t the richest man in the world, i hope He feels like the luckiest, but that guy was right
about one thing; i can�t think of anything Master
could demand of me that i wouldn�t do, or try to do.

&nbsp;

Master cupped slave�s chin in His hand and turned slave�s
face to His and kissed me lovingly.

&nbsp;

��You know, I have to
admit that sometimes I envy you, o.� Steph looked at
Scott and quickly added, �Don�t get any ideas Scott. But tonight, I just can�t
imagine how you got through it. When you walked through that bar, there must
have been twenty or thirty guys who all wanted to put their hands on your tits
and ass. And when that one girl tried to stick her finger inside you, I wanted to die, and I was just
watching.�

&nbsp;

i didn�t burst Stephanie�s bubble by explaining that i
didn�t remember half of what she was describing, and that was just fine with
me.

&nbsp;

�If that had been me, I would have probably gone insane
right there in the middle of the bar. That has got to be an experience that has
been scorched into your mind for life.�

&nbsp;

�i think that is what Master had in mind, Mistress
Stephanie; Something that would leave a lasting impression, on all of us. It
worked for me, and from what you have said, i guess
it worked for you, too. i confess tonight was as difficult as anything Master
has required of me. There were a couple of times when i thought i was just
going to collapse into a fetal position and cry for a week or two. i know this
sounds sophomoric, and i�ve told you before, but in
situations like that i just keep telling slave, �Master is going to be so proud
of me when i get through this�, and, so far, that has worked to get me through
everything He has required of me.�

&nbsp;

�Isn�t it degrading to be walked on a leash like that?�
Scott asked in a tone that suggested that he knew the answer.

&nbsp;

�As a matter of fact, i dislike being walked on the leash
always, but more when i am dressed, and on the street or at a party or
function, than in a situation like tonight. In circumstances like tonight, i
love the reassurance that Master is only the length of the leash away.� As i
was answering Scott, i realized that i hadn�t really thought of it quite that
way before, but it is absolutely true. i will try to transfer that feeling to
the less challenging times that i am leashed, which
are still quite difficult for me.

&nbsp;

After some time, having finished O/our drinks, and Scott and
Steph apparently out of questions, they excused
themselves and left. 

&nbsp;

i couldn�t believe i had the energy to suck Master�s wonderful cock, but as
soon as i felt it in slave�s mouth i knew i wanted to suck it for
hours and i did for well over an hour. After feasting
on Master�s delicious cum, i oiled and powdered His
beautiful cock and finally wrote in slave�s journal. 

&nbsp;

As i wrote, ii realized what great
pride i was taking in having endured what, just a few
years ago, i wouldn�t have even been able to imagine could happen to anyone,
and certainly not me.

&nbsp;

A half dozen times, i looked at slave�s reflection in the
mirror over the dresser and saw a warm and wonderful smile on slave�s lips. It
had been a very trying evening but i still love being
Master�s slave and would not trade places with anyone.
