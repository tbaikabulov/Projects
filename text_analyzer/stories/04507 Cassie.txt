Cassie

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Once upon a time Cassandra Williams� life
had been completely normal.� She lived in
a nice house, in a nice neighbourhood with her nice mum and dad.� She was a nice girl, with nice friends.� She attended a nice school, with nice
teachers.

&nbsp;

But then everything changed.� For ever.

&nbsp;

Cassie was twelve when her parents split
up. It had come as a total shock to her when her mother had sat on the edge of
her bed one evening and told her that her father had fallen in love with
another woman, and that he would be leaving them to go and live in Spain with
his new lady friend.� Cassie had been
distraught.� How could her lovely daddy
do this? And why was he going to live in Spain?�
So far away.� She�d never see him
again.� She had buried her head in her
pillow and wept as bitterly as a twelve-year-old can that night.

&nbsp;

When she woke the next morning she had a
headache from all the crying.� And her
daddy had gone.� Her lovely, darling
daddy, who always made her laugh, who was always teasing her and telling her
jokes.� He had left without saying
�goodbye�.

&nbsp;

In the months that followed her mother had
become increasingly depressed, losing interest in life.� She didn�t go out, discouraged visitors and
she had started to drink.� It had been
the odd glass of wine at first.� Then a
full bottle every night.� Then she had started
on gin and whisky.

&nbsp;

By the time Cassie reached the age of
fourteen her mother was a hopeless drunk.�
She lost her job.� Then the house
had to be sold because she couldn�t repay the mortgage.� They had moved into rented housing on a rough
estate.� Cassie hadn�t fitted in with the
local youths.� They had teased her,
called her names, made remarks about her mother being an alcoholic.� When she could take no more and stood up to
them they had surrounded her and beat her.

&nbsp;

Her face, such a pretty face her daddy had
always said, had been bruised and marked by the vicious assault of the gang.
Her nose had been hit so hard it had bled profusely.� Cassie had been sure it was broken.� She had fallen to the floor and curled into a
ball, hopeful that they�d leave her alone, would go and savour their victory.� For a few brief moments she had dared to hope
that it had worked.� And then she heard
footsteps approach, and a harsh laugh had rung out.� Then the hand of a stranger had reached out
and began to roughly manhandle her body.�
She had thought perhaps the owner was looking for cash or other
valuables, but then she had been horrified to feel the hand grope her
breasts.� An unfamiliar male voice had
announced �Nice tits.� Come and have a
feel.�� And then several more hands had
joined the assault, mauling her tender young breasts.� She had tried to fight them off, but then
someone had taken hold of her hair, pulling it hard, jerking her head back with
such ferocity she thought her neck would break.

&nbsp;

She had instinctively reached behind her
head to try to release the grip on her auburn locks, only for hands to grasp
her sweat shirt, pulling it up, exposing her simple white bra.� The sweat shirt had then been pulled up over
her face completely, blocking out any further view she might have had of her
assailants.� More hands had started to
pull at the waist band of her jeans.� She
felt them start to descend over her hips.�
She had curled up tightly, trying to fend off her attackers, desperate
to prevent them from removing her jeans.�
Her ankles had been grabbed and her legs pulled straight.� She felt her jeans slip over her hips at the same
moment that she felt her bra being pulled roughly up to expose her
breasts.� There were cheers from the
crowd which now surrounded her.� She knew
that her breasts were exposed for all to see.�
Hands grabbed and mauled them, pinching her nipples painfully.� Then more pulling and a tearing sound as her
knickers were ripped away.� She felt cool
air between her legs, and the cold of the concrete floor on her bottom.

&nbsp;

She screamed in panic, twisting and
turning, desperate to escape.� A hand had
been thrust between her legs, rubbing at the tender lips of her secret
spot.� Her knees had been grabbed and
forced apart, exposing her completely.�
Then a finger had been pushed into her.�
She had screamed again, begging them to stop.� Her sobbing had become hysterical.� And then suddenly, they stopped.� The hands which had been restraining and
assaulting her simply let go.� As she lay
terrorised on the floor, she was aware of the sound of footsteps retreating,
and the sound of a number of boys laughing. 

&nbsp;

She had gathered herself together as
quickly as she could.� Pulling her sweat
shirt down to cover her breasts, she could see that her jeans had been forced
down below her knees.� There had been no
sign of her knickers, which she realised had been taken as a souvenir.� She had quickly covered herself up and ran
home as fast as she could.� When she had
arrived home her mother had been too drunk even to notice.� Locking herself in the bathroom, she had
showered, washing her young body repeatedly.�
When she had looked at herself in the mirror, she had wept bitter tears,
not only with the pain of her injuries, but also with the feeling of utter
humiliation.� Her breasts had been
bruised by all the hands which had grabbed and pinched them.� They had been sore for days afterwards.� Every time she thought of those fingers
violating her most secret places she would feel the panic rise again.� She had cried herself to sleep so many times.� Cassie stayed in after that, not daring to
leave the house except for school and shopping trips.

&nbsp;

Finally, the local social services
department had become involved.� A woman
had visited them one afternoon and had been appalled by what she had
found.� The house was dirty, despite
Cassie�s efforts to clean it.� Dirty
clothes lay in piles around the house.�
Her mother had been unconscious with drink at four o�clock in the
afternoon.� An ambulance had been called,
and her mother had been taken to hospital.�
Cassie had been placed with foster parents for three days.� When the visitor came to see her, it was to
tell her that her mother was seriously ill.�
Her liver was close to collapse, and she would need treatment for
several months.� It was unthinkable that
she would be able to cope with bringing up a daughter until her health improved
significantly.� Arrangements had been
made for Cassie to go to live with her uncle and his family until such time as
her mother�s health had improved.

&nbsp;

Cassie had received this news with growing
alarm.� She had only met her uncle once
before.� He had come to visit soon after
her dad had left and Cassie had felt decidedly uncomfortable at the way he
looked at her.� He�d made comments about
her body, how she was �starting to blossom�, noticing her developing breasts
and hips.� He�d insisted that she give
him a kiss when he arrived and when he left.�
When she�d reluctantly done so, he had grabbed her and pulled her into a
bear hug.� As he�d been leaving he had
dropped his hands and given her bottom a squeeze.� Cassie had been too shocked to complain.� She had never forgotten though, how he�d made
her feel awkward and uncomfortable.

&nbsp;

Now she was to be packed off to another
part of the country, hundreds of miles away, to live with an uncle she had seen
once, and his family, who she had never met.�
The Social Services woman had suggested that she see her mother before
she left and Cassie had agreed at once, hoping that she could change her
mother�s mind.

&nbsp;

The meeting had been a nightmare.� Her mother had been sedated and looked truly
awful.� She was painfully thin, her skin
had an unhealthy, yellow tinge. She looked a good twenty years older than she
really was.� Cassie had been crying from
the moment she entered the room at the hospital.

&nbsp;

It had taken her mother some moments to
recognise her.� When she finally had, she
too had begun to cry.� �Cassie, I�m so
sorry my darling.� Please forgive
me.� I know you don�t want to leave me,
but it really is for the best you know.�
Andrew is a nice man, and his family will look after you better than I
could, I promise.� It won�t be for long love,
just until I can get myself better.�
You�ll do this for me, won�t you my darling?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Mum.�
Of course I will.� I want you to
get better, Mum.� I want that more than
anything else in the world.�

&nbsp;

�I want that too, darling.� I know you�ll be looked after well, but you
must promise to try to fit in there.�
Remember that it�s their home.�
Please try to get on with them.�
Uncle Andrew is in charge of you now.�
You must do as he says.� You will
do that for me, won�t you darling?�

&nbsp;

�Yes Mum.�
I will.� I promise.�

&nbsp;

Andrew Walker was not in a good mood.� A couple of days ago he had received a phone
call from Social Services telling him that his idiotic half-sister Amy had been
taken into hospital, almost at death�s door.�
She had drunk herself almost to death, and all over that pathetic waste
of time she had insisted on marrying all those years ago.� He�d told her at the time, of course.� He�d seen him for what he really was, a chancer.� 

&nbsp;

Andrew and Amy�s parents had died in a car
crash when Amy was nineteen.� When the
estate had been finalised Amy had insisted on moving two hundred miles away to
be with her new-found love.� They�d kept
in touch at first, and Andrew had found the man she had chosen to be with
shallow and annoying.� He was obsessed
with money.� He knew the price of
everything and the value of nothing.�
Andrew could see at once what the attraction in Amy was; her money.� It had surprised him how long the sponging
bastard had stayed around.� He�d fully
expected him to disappear once the money had been spent.� Instead they had settled down in middle class
suburbia, and Amy, who had always had ideas of grandeur, had revelled in the
role of pillar of the community.� Andrew had
despised it all.� Despised the ease of
their life, the casualness of their spending, the lah-de-dah friends and
lifestyle.� He had laughed out loud when
she had phoned him to tell him of the arrival of their daughter, laughed at the
pretentiousness of the name they chose; Cassandra.

&nbsp;

In Andrew�s world there was no
pretence.� He was a down-to-earth bloke,
living in the real world.� No high flying
for him.� He worked hard, bloody
hard.� It had taken him years to build up
his haulage business to the point where it was a success which gave him a
comfortable, but not lavish, life.� His
wife Susan and two children, Michael and Peter, knew the meaning of the word
'work�.� Not like that precocious little
bitch his sister had spawned.� Nothing
had been too good for her.� The finest of
everything for �darling Cassandra�.�
Private education, riding lessons, violin and piano, elocution, foreign
languages, the works.� It had irritated
Andrew beyond belief when his �airs and graces� sister had phoned to tell him
how well she was doing with her studies.

&nbsp;

And then wonder-boy had left!� She�d phoned one night, in tears, telling him
that he�d been having an affair.� He was
leaving her for some bit of fanny who was probably as shallow as he was.� Poor little Amy was on her own again, just as
he�d said she would be.� Only now, she
had a daughter to bring up.� He�d
visited, just to show he cared, and had been intrigued by the vivacious
twelve-year-old who had greeted him at the front door.� Her slim young body had aroused him in spite
of himself.� Her budding breasts, her
slim hips, her shock of auburn hair.�
Yes, she was going to be a right little prick teaser when she was older,
he knew it.

&nbsp;

Now he was driving south to collect the
little madam.� Her mother in hospital for
God knew how long, it was down to him and his family to raise her stupid
sister�s kid until she dried out enough to do it herself.� The thought of the daughter caught in his
mind.� She was twelve when he�d last seen
her.� He worked it out quickly in his
mind; she would be fourteen now.� The
same age as his eldest.� She had been a
pretty girl.� He wondered to himself how
she would look after a couple of years living with an alcoholic and looking
after herself.� 

&nbsp;

He pulled into the car park of the
hospital, made his way to the ward where his sister was being treated. 

&nbsp;

He was genuinely shocked at her
appearance.� She seemed to have aged
dramatically.� Looking at her, he thought
it unlikely she�d last another week.� The
doctors had told him otherwise, assured him that with proper care and treatment
she could make a complete recovery.� He
became aware of the daughter, sitting in the corner of the room.� Cassie had blossomed since he�d last seen
her.� At about five foot three tall, a
pretty face, with pale skin typical of red heads.� A liberal smattering of freckles.� Her auburn hair was cut in a �bob�
style.� She was dressed simply in a pair
of jeans and a sweat shirt.� Even beneath
her casual clothes, Andrew could see her slim body had developed over the last
two years.� Her breasts looked round and
firm, quite large for a girl of her age.�
Andrew guessed she was a �B� cup.�
As she moved to stand at her mother�s bedside Andrew immediately noticed
how graceful her movements were.� He also
noticed the shape and curve of her small young arse.� He felt his cock twitch.

&nbsp;

They talked for a few minutes.� Amy making him promise that he would look
after Cassie.� Making Cassie promise that
she would behave, and would do as she was told.�
Then a nurse had entered the room and explained that they would have to
leave, Amy was becoming tired out.

&nbsp;

Cassie and Amy had said their tearful
farewells, Andrew watching, unable to feel anything for his half-sister besides
contempt, and unwilling to recognise the growing lust he was feeling for his
fourteen-year-old niece.

&nbsp;

They had left the hospital and driven back
to the house, Cassie said nothing apart from giving directions through the
traffic.�� 

&nbsp;

Andrew was truly appalled by the state of
the house, and by the area in which it stood.�
�Jesus Christ, how could she live like this?�� He asked himself.� He sent Cassie off to get her things
together, and she reappeared ten minutes later with two bags.

&nbsp;

He threw the bags into the back of the car,
anxious to be away from the depressing area, wanting to get home.� Throughout the long drive Cassie said
virtually nothing.� �Good�, Andrew
thought.� �The last thing I need is a
mouthy kid.� She�d better not try any of
those airs and graces with me, not unless she wants her backside punished.�� The thought of spanking that tight little
bottom appealed to him greatly.� He�d
never been one to shy away from punishing his own children.� Both boys knew that incurring Dad�s anger
often meant being unable to sit comfortably for a few days.� He had used his belt on their behinds on a
few occasions.� Now they knew better than
to argue with him.� It would be better
for Cassie if she learnt quickly that she must do as she was told.� Andrew didn�t expect any problems in that
department, Amy had made the little brat promise in front of him to behave.

&nbsp;

They had arrived at her new home late in
the evening.� It was a large, rambling
sort of place, which looked as though it might have been a farm house at some
stage.� She had been introduced to her
Aunt Susan, who looked at her with barely concealed contempt, and then her two
cousins, Michael and Peter had come into the room.

&nbsp;

Michael was about the same age as Cassie,
but much taller.� Already at fourteen he
was almost as tall as his father, with the same broad shoulders and powerful
build.� He barely acknowledged Cassie�s
existence.� Peter was pretty much the
same.� Although only twelve, he too was
tall, a good four inches taller than Cassie, who began to feel very small and
insignificant. 

&nbsp;

Her uncle turned to the two boys, �Get
Cassie�s bags out of the car and take them, and her, up to her room.�

&nbsp;

�Her
room?� �Michael had echoed.

&nbsp;

�Yes, her room. And don�t you speak back to
me unless you want me to get my belt.�

&nbsp;

Cassie was frightened by them both.� Her cousin�s indifference, bordering on
hostility, and her Uncle�s aggressive tone.

&nbsp;

The two boys disappeared to fetch her bags,
her uncle left the room, leaving her alone with her aunt.� She was a wiry, stern looking woman, with
dark brown hair drawn tightly into a bun.�
Her face looked as though it had never learned to smile, and her pale
blue eyes narrowed as she looked at Cassie.

&nbsp;

�Listen to me, young lady.� You are a guest in my house, and you will
behave accordingly.� We have no
passengers here.� You will pull your weight,
like everyone else.� And you will do as
you are told.� Is that clear?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Aunt Susan.�

&nbsp;

�None of your airs and graces here, my
girl. You might think you are better than us because of your fancy school, but
if I catch you trying any nonsense here, I will make your life a misery. Got
that?�

&nbsp;

�Yes Aunt Susan.�

&nbsp;

�Right.�
There�s some supper on the table for you.� Unpack your things, eat up and off to bed
with you.�

&nbsp;

Cassie glanced at the clock; it was
seven-thirty.

&nbsp;

�But, Aunt Susan, it�s only half past
seven.� I don�t go to bed until much ��

&nbsp;

Before she could finish her sentence her aunt
had slapped her harshly across the face.�
Cassie gasped in shock.

&nbsp;

�I don�t care what you do at home.� You�re in my home now.� You will do as you are told, remember. Your
mother may be a useless alcoholic who lets you come and go as you please, but I
do things differently.� Unpack your
things, eat your supper and get off to bed.�
Right?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Aunt Susan.�

&nbsp;

Michael appeared at the door.� �This way Cassarndrar.� He said in mocking
tones, imitating her accent.� �I�ll show
you to your room.�

&nbsp;

Still shocked from the encounter with her
aunt, Cassie followed blindly.� She
followed Michael and Peter silently as they struggled up the stairs with her
bags.� Half way up Michael turned to her,
�Don�t expect this all the time.� I�m not
here to fetch and carry for you, y� know.�
In future, you can carry your own fuckin� bags.�

&nbsp;

�I know.�
I�m sorry.�

&nbsp;

They reached a small bedroom, and her bags
were thrown onto the small bed.� She
could feel their hostility.

&nbsp;

�We don�t want you here, y� know.� Thanks to you, I�ve got to move out of my
room and sleep in his.�� Michael said
aggressively.

&nbsp;

�Yeah, that�s right.�, Peter chimed in, �We
both lose out �cos of you.� We don�t care
about your drunk mum.� Just remember,
this is our house, and you�re not welcome in it.� 

&nbsp;

After they had left her alone, Cassie sat
on her bed.� Tears began to flow.� She was thinking of her mother, so ill. So
far away.� How was she going to cope with
living with relatives she didn�t know, and who already hated her?

&nbsp;

Her thoughts were interrupted by her aunt
calling up the stairs.� �Get down here
and eat your supper; unless you want to go to bed hungry.�

&nbsp;

She descended the stairs wearily.� She found her way into the kitchen, where al
four of then watched her suspiciously as she ate some bread and drank some
milk.� When she had finished, she was
ordered to bed.� As she climbed the
stairs, she could hear them talking, clearly discussing her and her mother.

&nbsp;

She unpacked her few clothes and
belongings, then undressed and climbed into bed.� She hadn�t remembered to pack a night-dress,
so she slept in her 

T-shirt and knickers.� Despite her misery, she soon fell into a deep
sleep.

&nbsp;

She was awoken abruptly.� Her aunt was standing over her bed and
yelling at her.� �What do you think this
is, a holiday camp?� Get yourself out of
bed, at once and get downstairs and help with the breakfast.�� The covers of her bed had been pulled off,
leaving her shivering in the sudden chill.�
She had got out of bed as quickly as she could and reached for her
jeans.

&nbsp;

�No time for that, get down stairs now.�

&nbsp;

�But, I can�t go down like this, I�m not
dressed.�

&nbsp;

Another slap across the face.� �Do as you are told.�� Her aunt yelled.

&nbsp;

She hurried down the stairs, acutely aware
of her state of undress. As she entered the kitchen she could see her uncle and
cousins waiting for her.� She blushed
with embarrassment as they looked at her.�
Dressed only in a T-shirt and knickers, she felt so vulnerable.

&nbsp;

�Right, now you�ve decided to join us, make
yourself useful. First thing, make some tea.�
Then get busy making some toast. After that, you can clear the breakfast
things away.� Come on, get a move on.�

&nbsp;

She jumped at the barked orders, then tried
her best to follow them.� She hurried
around the kitchen trying to prepare the breakfast as they sat and watched her.

&nbsp;

Andrew was enjoying himself.� The little bitch was scurrying around trying
to please, her tight little arse covered only by the thin white cotton of her
knickers.� At times he thought he could
make out her auburn pubes through the fabric.�
Her tits jiggled appealingly as she busied herself. He looked at his
boys.� They were enjoying the
spectacle.� Good for them!� It was good that they learned young that
these little bitches were to be kept in their place!� Susan looked like she was enjoying herself
too. A sly smile crept across her face every time the little red-head made a
mistake.� She was brutal in her
criticism, making fun of every error, every spill.

&nbsp;

By the time she had finished making
breakfast, Cassie was near to tears.�
Nothing she had done was right.�
Her uncle kept barking orders, her aunt was scathing about everything
she did, and her cousins were laughing at her openly.� She had felt uncomfortable about not being
dressed of course, but that had only been the start.� They had yelled at her, criticised everything
she had done, called her stupid and useless.�
She had noticed how her uncle had looked at her.� She had seen him staring at her knickers.� She felt like her skin was crawling.

&nbsp;

She had been denied breakfast herself, her
aunt had been very firm about that.� �If
you want breakfast, get up earlier.� It�s
your job to get things ready for the rest of us.� We come first.� If you can�t get things ready for us, you
don�t deserve to eat.�

&nbsp;

She had been made to clear the breakfast things
away, still hungry.� Finally she had
summoned up the courage to ask a question.

&nbsp;

�Can I have a shower please, Aunt Susan?�

&nbsp;

�Well, I suppose you�d better.� You smell awful. Why did you sleep in your
clothes?� Is that the sort of dirty habit
encouraged in your family?�

&nbsp;

Cassie ignored the insult.� �I packed in a hurry.� I forgot to put in my pyjamas.� I�m sorry.��
Already, she was beginning to apologise for just about everything she
did.� She felt so miserable, nothing was
good enough, it seemed.

&nbsp;

�Right, well, I�ll find one of your uncles
T-shirts for you to use until we can get you something better.� Now get off to the bathroom and clean
up.� And when you come down I want you
dressed properly.� I don�t hold with
girls wearing trousers.� You�ll wear a skirt.�

&nbsp;

�But you wear trousers.� Why can�t I?�

&nbsp;

This time her aunt backhanded her across
the face.� �I�ve had just about enough of
your cheek, you stuck up bitch.� Do as
you are told.� I won�t tell you
again.� Is that clear?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Aunt Susan.� But I don�t have any skirts.� They let us wear trousers at school, and so I
never have to wear anything else.� I�m
really sorry, Aunt Susan.�

&nbsp;

�You brought your things for school, didn�t
you?�

&nbsp;

�Yes.�

&nbsp;

�Well, don�t you have a games skirt?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, but it�s for games. I mean, it�s
really short. It�s only supposed to be used for games, it�s not really a skirt
for every day wear.�

&nbsp;

�It will do for now.� When you get dressed, put it on.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Aunt Susan.�

&nbsp;

Cassie went up to the bathroom and closed
the door.� She carefully locked it behind
her.� She hadn�t lived in a house with so
many males in it before, and she was nervous.�
She ran the shower until it was warm.�
The water wasn�t going to get hot, she could tell.� She pulled off her T-shirt, pushed her
knickers over her hips until they fell to the floor, and stepped into the
stream of luke warm water.� 

&nbsp;

She lost herself in the pleasures of
washing, rubbing the soap into a lather and enjoying the cleansing feeling as
she washed her young body.� She rubbed
shampoo into her auburn hair, relishing the time alone.

&nbsp;

Andrew heard the bathroom door close and
the shower begin to run.� He knew it was
the pretty fourteen-year-old in the bathroom.�
His wife and sons had both washed already, as had he. Now the little
bitch was cleaning herself.� He waited
until he could hear her under the stream of water. She was humming to herself
as she showered.� He walked to the
bathroom door, then silently opened it.�
He had fixed the lock many years ago so that it was inoperative.� This had given him the opportunity to
�accidentally� walk in on a number of visiting female guests.� Of course he had always apologised profusely,
seemed to be more embarrassed than the victim of his intrusion.

&nbsp;

Now he stepped inside the bathroom and
closed the door behind him.� The little
bitch was standing under the jet of water with her back to him.� He took in the view of her juvenile arse, so
tight, so small.� He wanted to molest it
there and then. Her body was slim, her skin smooth.� She was so close to him, he could just reach
out and touch her.

&nbsp;

And then she turned around.� Her eyes were closed to protect them against
the shampoo foam which ran down her face. He caught his breath.� Her tits were round and firm, high on her
chest, capped by puffy, pink nipples.� Her
pussy lips were just visible under the downy auburn hair between her legs. She
was unbelievably fuckable!� He wanted to
take her, wanted to abuse that sweet body.�
He imagined her face as he raped her, imagined the look of sheer
horror.� He smiled to himself.� No need to rush.� She�d be his in days.� Why not have some fun with her first.

&nbsp;

�Are you going to stay in there all bloody
day, or what?�, he yelled.

&nbsp;

At the sound of his voice her eyes opened
wide.� She was shocked beyond belief to
see him standing there.� Her arms
immediately flew to cover what he had already seen. One arm covered her ample
tits, the other clutched at her downy covered clam.� She screeched in alarm at the sudden
intrusion.

&nbsp;

She crouched down, trying to hide her
nakedness from him, blinded by the shampoo suds.� 

&nbsp;

�I, er, I�ll be done soon.� I�m nearly finished.� I won�t be long, I promise.� I�m sorry, I thought I�d locked the door.� Could you excuse me please Uncle Andrew.� I�ll be right out.�

&nbsp;

�Well, I need to shave.� You just carry on and finish.� We don�t have any secrets in this house,
Cassandra.� No locked doors here.� Now get on and finish up quickly, you�re using
up all the hot water.�� He ordered.

&nbsp;

He stood looking at her, arms folded.� It was clear he wasn�t going to move. 

&nbsp;

She felt humiliated beyond belief as she
was forced to finish her shower with her uncle watching her.� She finished as quickly as she could, of
course, but it was still long enough for him to have seen every inch of her.� She stepped out of the shower, wrapped
herself in a tiny towel which hardly covered her modesty, and ran to her
bedroom in tears.

&nbsp;

Andrew grinned to himself.� She was so vulnerable she could be
manipulated into doing anything.�
Yesterday, she had hardly known him.�
Today, she was showering in front of him.� She didn�t like it, but what did that
matter?� His boys would learn a great
deal practising on her. 

&nbsp;

Cassie collapsed on her bed,
distraught.� She had been forced to carry
on showering in full view of her uncle.�
With the exception of the assault some moths ago, she hadn�t been seen
naked by a man since she was a small child.�
Now she had been seen by a virtual stranger, who had run his hungry eyes
over her entire body.� The panic she had
felt whilst being violated had returned in full measure. She felt humiliated
and ashamed.

&nbsp;

She lay on her bed, sobbing her little
heart out, for several minutes.� Then she
was brought out of her misery by a voice.�


&nbsp;

�You better get yourself downstairs
quick.� Mum wants you to clean the
stairs. She told me to come and get you�

&nbsp;

She shrieked in alarm as the realisation
hit her that she was stark naked.� As she
grasped for the towel she turned and realised that Peter, her twelve-year-old
cousin had been watching her for God knew how long.� He had a mischievous smile on his face as he
watched his older cousin desperately try to protect her modesty, clutching the
towel to her as if it was her life support machine!� He had already seen enough of her to know
that he would enjoy having her around.�
Her naked pink little arse had stirred his juvenile cock into a raging
erection.� Now he enjoyed her misery as
she tried to cover up her nakedness.

&nbsp;

�I�ll be right down.� She stammered.� �Tell Aunt Susan I�ll be right down.�

&nbsp;

�Maybe I should wait.� Make sure you�re not messing around?�

&nbsp;

�No!�
I�ll be there in just a minute.�
Please go and tell her. I won�t be a minute.� Please Peter.�

&nbsp;

�No.�
I�m going to wait.� She told me to
come and get you.� You�d better get a
move on, or she�ll be angry with you.�

&nbsp;

He stared at Cassie defiantly.� He was determined that he wasn�t going to go
away. Her was looking forward to the show!

&nbsp;

�Look, Peter.� I�m just going to get dressed, then I�ll be
right down.� You can tell Aunt Susan I�ll
be there in a minute.� Please Peter.�

&nbsp;

�No.�
She said to go and get you.� I�d
get ready real quick if I were you.� She
doesn�t like being kept waiting.�

&nbsp;

With a half sob, Cassie got up from the bed
and started to get her clothes ready.�
She found a pair of knickers, a T-shirt and her games skirt.� Then she turned to her cousin, who was still
smiling at her.

&nbsp;

�Would you excuse me please, while I get
dressed?�

&nbsp;

He looked at her with an arrogance beyond
his years.

&nbsp;

�I�m not going anywhere.� If I were you, I�d hurry up. She�ll be
waiting.�

&nbsp;

Cassie swallowed another huge sob, and
admitted defeat.� She tried to keep the
towel wrapped around her as she started to dress.� As she stepped into her knickers, the top
part slipped, exposing one breast.� She
blushed, and covered up as best she could.�
She managed to pull on her knickers with one hand, wriggling her hips as
they rode up her thighs. Peter was still enjoying himself, smiling broadly.

&nbsp;

�Why are you so up-tight about this?� We�re all family, just get your kit on and
come down.�

&nbsp;

Cassie ignored him.� She wasn�t about to dress, or undress, in
front of a younger cousin. She finally managed to get her knickers on, not
without giving him several glimpses of her breasts as the small towel failed to
cover her modesty.� She turned her back
on the boy for a second and looked around for her bra.� She was confused for a moment.� It had been there a moment ago.

&nbsp;

�Looking for this?�� Her tormentor asked.

&nbsp;

She turned to face him and saw him dangling
the garment in front of her.

&nbsp;

�Give that to me.�

&nbsp;

�No.�
I want to have a look at them first.�

&nbsp;

She gasped with shock and outrage.� She held the towel tight to her body.

&nbsp;

�Peter, give it to me.� Please�

&nbsp;

�Let me see them first.� Then you can have it.� Mum�s going to be really angry with you for
taking so long.� I don�t think you want
to take much longer.�

&nbsp;

The thought of incurring her aunt�s
displeasure was a frightening prospect. Her head dropped in shame.� She was defenceless, unable to defy any of
them. They had beaten her before the fight had begun.� Totally demoralised, she let the towel fall
to the floor, exposing her breasts to the lecherous twelve-year-old.

&nbsp;

Peter couldn�t believe his luck.� He had been sent by his mother to tell Cassie
that she was to clean the stairs.� He had
opened the bedroom door to find his cousin naked on the bed.� She had been lying face down, sobbing
quietly.� He had taken his chance to have
a good look at her arse before he�d delivered the message, then he�d just
enjoyed watching her trying to cover her nakedness.

&nbsp;

He�d been lying when he�d told her he�d
been sent to get her.� He�d only been
told to give her the message, but she�d believed it so readily. He�d found it
amusing the way she had tried to get him to leave the room.� If she�d just told him to go, he would have
done.� But she was so scared of them all,
she didn�t dare.� Instead, he was able to
frighten her into getting dressed right in front of him.� It had been fun watching her trying to pull
on her knickers with one hand, the other clinging to the small towel.� His small cock had twitched when her nipple
had peeped out of the top of the towel, and he had smiled at her
embarrassment.� Then he had taken his
chance.� Whilst she had been looking away
he had grabbed hold of her bra.� He
hadn�t expected her to give in so easily, but when he had threatened her with
his mother�s anger, he had seen how easy it would be to dominate her.� His cock throbbed in his trousers as she had
dropped her towel.� They were the first
pair of tits he had seen, and he had almost climaxed on the spot as he stood
staring at them. 

&nbsp;

�Cool!�
You have to promise to let me see then whenever I want.� Otherwise, I�ll keep you here for ages, and
she�ll kill you. Deal?�

&nbsp;

She nodded her head, unable to speak.� Misery consumed her.

&nbsp;

Peter threw her bra to her and left the
room snickering to himself.� 

&nbsp;

She had taken a few moments to compose
herself.� It had amazed her how much this
family scared her. She had been with them for less than twenty-four hours, but
already she was terrified of both her aunt and uncle.� He was so strong, so in control.� She was so hard.� So brutal.�
She had hit her three times already.�
Cassie had never been struck before, and the experience had shaken her
to the core.� She felt as though she had
lost herself somewhere.� She was no
longer in control.� She had nothing.� She had promised her mother she would do as
they said, but surely, her mother hadn�t meant for her to accept this kind of
abuse?� She resolved to fight.� She wouldn�t let them defeat her.� Then she heard her aunt yelling up to her.

&nbsp;

�Get down here, you lazy bitch.� There�s work to be done.�

&nbsp;

Her resolve had evaporated at once.� She quickly put on her bra, followed by a
T-shirt and her games skirt, and ran down the stairs, anxious to avoid further
reprimand.

&nbsp;

She had been given her orders.� She was to clean the stairs by hand, using
dust pan and brush.� She had set to at
once.� Her uncle and cousins came by from
time to time to watch her.� They stood at
the foot of the stairs, criticising. She knew that they could see up her short
skirt.� Knew that was why they were
watching her.� She couldn�t do anything
about it.� As she bent over, sweeping,
she could feel their eyes as they took in the sight of her thin white knickers
under her grey skirt.� She felt dirty,
but was powerless to do anything about it.

&nbsp;

�When you�ve done that, you can clean the
boys room.� Get a move on.�� Her aunt was proving a hard task master.

&nbsp;

As she reached the top of the stairs, Peter
approached her.� The others were
downstairs, she could hear them talking.

&nbsp;

�Let�s see them then.�

&nbsp;

�No, Peter, please.� Please don�t do this.�

&nbsp;

�You promised.� If you don�t keep your promise, I�ll get
you.� Believe it.� I�ll find some way of getting you back.� You�ll be sorry.�

&nbsp;

Instinctively, she believed him.� There was something about this family that
frightened her to the core, all of them.�
She wanted to run away, but she had promised her mother.� She was trapped.� Now this horrible boy was taunting and
tormenting her. She was scared of what he might do if she defied him.

&nbsp;

�Please, Peter.� I can�t.�
Please.� Don�t make me do this.�

&nbsp;

�I want to see them.�

&nbsp;

A tear escaped from the corner of her eye,
rolling down her cheek.

&nbsp;

�Do it now.�� He shouted.

&nbsp;

�OK.�
OK.� Please keep your voice
down.�� She said anxiously.� She hated to think what her aunt and uncle
would do if they became involved.

&nbsp;

�Well?�

&nbsp;

She took a deep breath, then reached for
the hem of her T-shirt.� Grasping it with
both hands she quickly lifted it, exposing her bra to the amused boy.

&nbsp;

�Carry on.��
He ordered.

&nbsp;

She felt for the cups of her bra, then
lifted them to expose her breasts once again to his fascinated gaze.� She looked at his face as he stood back to
admire the view.� She closed her eyes in
misery and shame.

&nbsp;

�I want to feel them.�

&nbsp;

�No!�
No, Peter.� You can�t.� I�ve kept my promise.� That�s enough isn�t it?�� She quickly pulled her bra back into place
and dropped her T-shirt.

&nbsp;

�No.�
It�s not enough.� I want to feel
them.� If you don�t let me, I�ll tell mum
you flashed your tits to me to get me to do your cleaning work..� She�ll believe me as well.� She hates you.� Well; what�s it going to be, then?� 

&nbsp;

Cassie suffered a life time�s agony in the
space of a few moments.� She was truly
frightened of what her aunt would do to her.�
She didn�t doubt what Peter had said was true.� Her aunt did hate her, and would believe
anything Peter said against her.� She
felt her lower lip tremble as she bowed her head.

&nbsp;

�Get them out then.�

&nbsp;

She began to cry as she lifted her T-shirt
once more, then she pulled her bra up over her breasts and let her hands hang
limply by her sides.� She closed her eyes
as her younger cousin stepped closer.�
Then his hands were squeezing her breasts.� It reminded her of the assault.� Then it had been total strangers, now it was
a member of her own family, someone she knew, would have to face time and time
again.� It was infinitely worse.� She felt panic and shame rising in her.� Then he started to pinch her nipples.

&nbsp;

�Owwww! Stop Peter, you�re hurting me. Oh!
please stop.�

&nbsp;

She looked into his face, a malicious smile
had spread across his young face.� She
could see that he was not only enjoying feeling her breasts, he was enjoying
humiliating and hurting her too.

&nbsp;

After what seemed like hours, but was in
fact only a minute or two, he stopped.�
By now her face was tear stained and her nipples were throbbing
painfully.� �OK, you can put them away
now.� But next time, get them out right
away when I tell you.� Got that?�

&nbsp;

When she didn�t answer at once he grabbed
her nipple and twisted it causing hot pain to shoot through her breast.� She gasped with the pain and almost cried
out.

&nbsp;

�Ahhhh.�
Yes, Peter, yes.� I�ll do what you
say.� Please stop.� Please let me go.�

&nbsp;

He pulled at her nipple, then let go
suddenly.� She put her hand over it
protectively, biting her lip in pain and anguish.� Then she heard footsteps on the stairs below
them and she quickly pulled her bra and T-shirt back into place.� She wiped her eyes on the back of her hand,
and tried to look busy.� Peter grinned at
her, winked, and said �See you later.��
Then ran downstairs.

&nbsp;

The footsteps she had heard belonged to her
uncle.� As he drew level with her he
looked at her with contempt.� Noticing
her red eyes and tear stained face he barked �What�s the matter with you then?�

&nbsp;

�Nnnnothing.�� She stammered.� �I�m just finishing here.�

&nbsp;

�Good.�
When you�ve done that, you can clean the boy�s room.� Get a move on then.�� And he gave her a crisp smack to her bottom.� She squealed in alarm, dropping the dust pan
and it�s contents on the floor.

&nbsp;

�You clumsy bitch.� Clean it up. Now.�

&nbsp;

she immediately dropped to her hands and
knees and began to sweep the dust back into the pan.� As she did so, he was rewarded with a clear
view of her small white knickers as her short skirt rode up over her tight little
arse.� He stood and watched her for
several minutes, enjoying the view, and smiling to himself at her evident fear
of him.

&nbsp;

�Get your jobs done quickly, or I�ll give
your backside something to think about.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Uncle Andrew.� I�m sorry.� She sniffed.� She kept her head down, working as hard as
she could to clean up the mess, hoping he would leave her alone.

&nbsp;

Eventually, she had finished clearing up,
and he had left her alone at the top of the stairs.� Her heart was racing.� Everything was terrifying and intimidating to
her.� She wondered what they would do to
her next.� 

&nbsp;

Her aunt gave her a vacuum cleaner and told
her to clean Michael and Peter�s room next.�
She struggled up the stairs with the heavy device, and went into the
room.

&nbsp;

�Hey!�
Fucking knock before you come in here bitch.�� Michael was lying on his bed, wearing just
his underpants and a T-shirt.� 

&nbsp;

�Sorry.�
I thought you were downstairs.�
Shall I come back later?�

&nbsp;

�No.�
Get on with what you�ve got to do, just be quick about it.�

&nbsp;

She started to clean the carpet, aware of
his malicious eyes on her at all times.�
She was trying to get the job done quickly but his scrutiny made her
nervous and clumsy.� She knocked over a
small table, spilling a selection of magazines onto the floor. Without being
told she immediately dropped to her knees and began to pick them up.� When she saw the subject matter of some of
them she blushed with shock.� Her
cousin�s collection of porno mags were the first of their kind she had ever
seen.� She stared at them in surprise,
unaware that her skirt had ridden up again, and her cousin was enjoying the
same view as his father a few minutes before. 

&nbsp;

Michael felt his cock twitch as Cassie bent
over to pick up his magazines, inadvertently displaying the crotch of her
knickers to him.� Absent mindedly he
began to rub his cock, imagining what her pussy would look like, how it would
feel, what it would be like to fuck her.

&nbsp;

At that moment both Cassie and Michael were
startled out of their private thoughts when Peter burst into the room.� Peter stopped for a moment and took in the
scene.� Cassie was on her hands and knees
staring at some magazines on the floor, Michael was being treated to a view up
her skirt.� He grinned to himself.

&nbsp;

�What the fuck do you want?�� Michael demanded.

&nbsp;

�Nothing.�
Mum and Dad have gone off to the shops.�
They said they�ll be back in about an hour.� Hey! Wanna see something really good?�

&nbsp;

�What?�

&nbsp;

�OK Cassie, get them out.�

&nbsp;

Cassie instinctively folded her arms across
her breasts, got quickly to her feet and tried to make for the door.� As she approached Peter he swung his hand,
catching her across the face.� She gasped
in shock and pain and staggered back.

&nbsp;

�You don�t fuckin� listen, do you.� I said, get them out.�

&nbsp;

�What the fuck are you doin�, idiot?�� His brother snapped.

&nbsp;

�Just watch.� Get on with it then.� He barked at Cassie.

&nbsp;

She slowly got to her feet, scared.� She wanted to cry, but she knew it would do
her no good.� Instead, she pleaded,
begged, whined.� Peter wouldn�t relent.

&nbsp;

�Do you want me to knock you about some
more?�

&nbsp;

�No!�
No, please Peter.� I�ll do
it.� Don�t hit me again.�

&nbsp;

�Do what?�
What�s she going to do Pete?�

&nbsp;

�Show Mikey.�

&nbsp;

Cassie�s lower lip was trembling.� Her heart was beating fast.� She stood, rooted to the spot and very slowly
took hold of the hem of her T-shirt.� She
began to lift it, higher and higher.� As
her bra was exposed, Michael let out a hiss of tension.� �Fuckin� hell.�

&nbsp;

She paused as she bunched the T-shirt up
round her neck.

&nbsp;

�Get on with it.� Peter shouted.

&nbsp;

She closed her eyes, bit her lip and lifted
her bra up and over her breasts in one movement.

&nbsp;

Michael sat completely still on his bed,
stunned and fascinated.� He stared at
Cassie�s� tits, round and firm, with
puffy pink nipples.� He was amazed when
his kid brother calmly walked over to her, stood behind her, then reached round
and began to cup and fondle the pink globes.

&nbsp;

�Good eh?��
Peter asked.

&nbsp;

�How the fuck did you get her to do that? 

&nbsp;

�Easy.�
She�s just a little slut really.�
Likes getting them out and showing them off.� Right, Cassie?�

&nbsp;

His fingers had closed on her nipples. She
remembered how he had pinched and twisted them so painfully earlier.� She knew if she didn�t humour him, he would
do the same again.� She nodded, silently.

&nbsp;

�Well, I think I�ll have a go as well.�

&nbsp;

Michael walked over and began to grope her
tender breasts.� He teased and tickled
her nipples, and she felt them getting hard.

&nbsp;

�She�ll get them out whenever you like.�
Peter said, happily.

&nbsp;

�Cool.�
What else does she do?�

&nbsp;

Cassies eyes opened in fear.� Michael was looking at her lecherously.

&nbsp;

�Dunno.�

&nbsp;

�Well, why don�t we find out?� Right, bitch.�
Come over here and give me a hand job.�
I think you owe it to me for getting me so horny.�

&nbsp;

Cassie looked confused.� �I don�t know what that is.�� She confessed.

&nbsp;

�Come over here and I�ll show you.� Michael
grinned.

&nbsp;

She didn�t feel as though she had a choice,
so she followed him over to his bed.� He
lay down on it and motioned for her to lay beside him.� She shook her head vehemently, her jaw
clamped shut in fear.

&nbsp;

�I wont tell you again.�� He growled.

&nbsp;

With her breasts still exposed, she
reluctantly lay down next to him.� He
took hold of her hand and pushed it down the front of his underpants.� She tried to pull her hand away.� He quickly caught hold of her round the
throat, his face close to hers.

&nbsp;

�Listen bitch.� Do this, or I�ll hurt you real bad.�

&nbsp;

She let him push her hand into his
underwear again.� He made her wrap her
fingers around his cock, which was now hard and throbbing. She had never even
seen a cock before, let alone touch one.�
She felt sick.� The shaft felt hot
to her touch. Then he began to pump her hand up and down.

&nbsp;

�Keep doing that until I come.� He
instructed.

&nbsp;

She kept on wanking his hard cock, tears
falling from her eyes. He began to stroke her breasts again, then groaned with
pleasure.� She was suddenly aware of a
hot sticky fluid spurting from his cock.�
She knew about sperm from her biology lessons, and she had heard other
girls talking about it, but she was still unprepared for the sensation of the
cock in her hand pulsing and spurting over her skin.

&nbsp;

After a few moments, he put his hand over
hers, making her stop.� She let go of the
now shrinking organ and pulled her hand away.�
She looked at her hand.� A
pearly-white liquid was sticking to her skin.�
She shuddered with revulsion.

&nbsp;

�Fuckin� great!� Do me, do me!�� Peter was shouting as he unfastened his
trousers and went over to his own bed.�
Cassie reluctantly got up and walked over to him.� She lay next to him, and without further
urging she put her hand into his underwear and found his stiffening cock.� She started to wank him, squirming as he
began to play with her breasts.� After
just a few moments, he too climaxed, shooting more of the sticky liquid onto
her hand.

&nbsp;

As his breathing slowed, a smug grin spread
over his face.� �I think I�m getting to
like having you here.� You do have some
uses then!�

&nbsp;

She was too miserable to reply.

&nbsp;

�Well, you know what to do next time I want
a hand job, don�t you bitch?�

&nbsp;

She nodded.�
She felt defiled.� She couldn�t
believe she had been made to do that.�
She knew she was too scared to refuse them in future.� There was no telling what they would do to
her if she did.� 

&nbsp;

�Can I go now, please?�

&nbsp;

Michael considered her request.� 

&nbsp;

�Yes; but lift up your skirt and show us
your knickers first.�

&nbsp;

She felt numb.� She was too stunned by the events of the
afternoon to argue.� As if in a dream she
stood up and raised her skirt, exposing her small white knickers to the two boys.� Her face flushed with embarrassment.� She was ordered to turn around slowly so that
they could have a good look. As she did so she caught a glimpse of herself in
the mirror.� Her breasts were still
exposed, her face bright red and she was holding her skirt up high for the
amusement of her tormentors.� She started
to sob, then ran from the room with their laughter ringing in her ears.� She threw herself on her bed and sobbed
bitterly. 

&nbsp;

Some time later she heard her aunt and
uncle returning.� Her aunt called out for
her at once.

&nbsp;

�Coming Aunt Susan.�� She called as she ran down the stairs.

&nbsp;

�Get out to the car and bring in that
shopping.� Her aunt snapped.

&nbsp;

She went out to the car and began to unpack
the shopping bags.� Her uncle stood
nearby, talking to another man.� Cassie
had to bend and lean forward to reach the shopping bags, and she felt the cool
breeze catch at her skirt and lift it.�
Unable to do anything about her shame, she turned with hands full of
shopping and was dismayed to feel the wind lift her skirt again.� She knew that both her uncle and the other
man were watching, and enjoying her embarrassment.

&nbsp;

She made several journeys to and from the
car, and knew that almost every time her white knickers had been displayed to
the all male audience.� She almost didn�t
care any more. After the ordeal her cousins had put her through, accidentally
showing he knickers briefly to two adult men was no big deal, but she felt her
face blush, and hurried to get inside as quickly as she could.� As she lifted the last bags from the car she
heard her uncle call to her,� �When
you�ve taken those in, come back out here to me.�

&nbsp;

�Yes Uncle.�

&nbsp;

She deposited the bags and returned to
stand in front of her uncle and his companion.

&nbsp;

�Like showing off you knickers, do you?�

&nbsp;

She blushed again.� �I�m sorry Uncle, the wind caught my
skirt.� It was an accident.�

&nbsp;

�I can�t feel any wind, can you Phil?�

&nbsp;

The other man grinned at her mischievously.

&nbsp;

�Not a breath of wind all day, Andy.�

&nbsp;

�No, I agree.� This is the one I�ve been telling you
about.� All airs and graces. Thinks she�s
better than the likes of us.� Does
nothing around the house unless you call making a mess being useful.� Struts around with that tiny little skirt on,
showing off what she�s got to anyone. Came down to breakfast this morning
without even that on.� Flouncing around
in her knickers, brazen as you like.�

&nbsp;

�That�s not true!� Aunt Susan made me come down like that.� She wouldn�t let me get dressed. And then she
made me wear this skirt.� It�s the only
one I�ve got, and I know it�s too short, but it�s a games skirt, it�s meant to
be short.�

&nbsp;

Her uncle�s face darkened at her outburst.

&nbsp;

�So it�s all your Aunt�s fault is it?� You ungrateful little bitch.� She�s never even thought to say thank you to
us for taking her in, you know.� Not a
word of thanks, after I drove hundreds of miles to bring her here.� And you should have seen the squalor she was
living in, Phil.� Jesus Christ, I
wouldn�t keep a dog in those conditions.�
And when she gets here all she does is swan around the house doing
bugger all.� Then it�s all Susan�s
fault.� I�ve a good mind to teach you a
lesson you won�t forget.� Come here.� 

&nbsp;

And with that he grabbed hold of her arm in
a painful grip and began dragging her towards the house.

&nbsp;

�All my sister�s fault, this Phil.� She was always a bit posh. Always thought
herself better than the rest. Time we taught her a lesson then.��� 

&nbsp;

�Want to see the stuck up bitch taken down
a peg or two Phil?� Follow me.�

&nbsp;

Phil followed eagerly.� Cassie tried to resist.� She tried pleading.� She tried apologising.� All to no avail.� Her uncle dragged her into the house, with
Phil following close behind.

&nbsp;

The noise of all the shouting brought
Michael and Peter running down the stairs.�
Cassie was dragged into the kitchen, where her uncle sat in a high
backed wooden chair and pulled her across his lap.

&nbsp;

�I�ll teach you to be more grateful, you
little tart.�� He growled.

&nbsp;

Cassie�s hands were held together high on
her back, forcing her head down towards the floor.� Then she felt her skirt being lifted.� She suddenly realised what was about to
happen and began to wail miserably.

&nbsp;

�No, please Uncle Andrew.� I�m sorry.�
It won�t happen again.� I�m sorry
I was rude to you, I really am, please Uncle.�
Let me go, oh!, please don�t hurt me uncle.�

&nbsp;

Her words caught in her throat as she felt
her knickers being pulled down. Her bare bottom was thrust up as her head was
pushed down.� She started to kick with
her legs, writhing around desperate for escape.

&nbsp;

�Michael, get hold of her legs and keep
them still.�� Her uncle ordered.� She felt strong hands grab her ankles,
forcing her legs straight.� And then the
blows started.

&nbsp;

The first one made her scream loudly.� It stung her little bottom.� Then she was being smacked repeatedly.� She felt her skin start to burn. The pain and
humiliation was almost unbearable.� She
lost count of the number of smacks she received.� After a while she was too ashamed and
exhausted to scream.� She whimpered after
each blow, sobbing quietly to herself the rest of the time.

&nbsp;

At last, he had finished.� The hands holding her legs and her arms
released their grip, and she fell to the floor, still sobbing.� Instinctively, she reached down and began to
rub the cheeks of her sore bottom.

&nbsp;

�None of that.� Get in the corner, hands on your head, and
stay there until I tell you you can move.�

&nbsp;

She climbed wearily to her feet and
shuffled over to the corner.� As she did
so, she reached down and started to pull her knickers back up.

&nbsp;

�Oh no you don�t young lady.�� Her aunt barked.� �I�ll show you what happens if you don�t
behave in my house.�� And with that, her
skirt was lifted again, and tucked into her waist band.� Then her knickers were pulled down to her
knees.

&nbsp;

�Right.�
Stay there.�� Her aunt snapped.

&nbsp;

She could feel the heat from the spanking
on her bottom.� She could also feel the
burning of shame and humiliation on her face.�
Tears ran freely down her cheeks.

&nbsp;

They all stayed in the kitchen, carrying on
as if nothing were unusual or out of place.�
Her uncle and Phil enjoyed a beer, the two boys drank one between them.� After about ten minutes her uncle said, �Have
you learned your lesson then?�

&nbsp;

�Yes Uncle.�� She said in a quiet voice.� 

&nbsp;

�Come here.�

&nbsp;

She shuffled forward and stood before her
uncle.

&nbsp;

�I think you owe an apology, don�t you?� 

&nbsp;

�Yes, Uncle.� I�m really sorry I was rude.� It won�t happen again, I promise.�

&nbsp;

�I think you owe Mr. Jones here an apology
too, don�t you?�

&nbsp;

She moved to stand in front of her uncle�s
companion, head bowed, and said �I�m sorry, sir.� I won�t behave like that again.�

&nbsp;

�I should think so too.� You should be a lot more respectful to your
aunt and uncle, after they�ve done so much for you.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, sir.�
I will be.

&nbsp;

�I think you should make her stay like this
for the rest of the day, Andy.� Just so
she remembers in future.�

&nbsp;

�Good idea, Phil.� You can stay like that, with your punished
arse on show, for the rest of the day.�
Is that clear?�

&nbsp;

�Yes Uncle.�� She felt tears spring to her eyes again.� She sniffed them back, determined not to
provoke him further.

&nbsp;

�Well, you can�t wander around with your
knickers round your knees all day, can you?��
Mr. Jones said with a chuckle.�
�You�d best give them to me.�

&nbsp;

The rest of the family laughed at her as
she let her knickers drop to her ankles, then bent and picked them up before
handing them to the lecherous Mr. Jones.�
He calmly folded them in half and put them into his jacket pocket.

&nbsp;

�Well, I must be going.� Thanks for the laugh Andy.�

&nbsp;

�Any time, Phil.�

&nbsp;

And with that, he left, still with her
knickers in his pocket.� She wanted to
object, but knew better.� Instead, she
started to clear away the glasses which lay on the table.

&nbsp;

Her aunt and uncle left the kitchen, as did
Peter.� Before Michael left her to her
tasks, he leaned in close to her, reached out and grabbed both breasts before
saying, �I saw your pussy.�

&nbsp;

�What?�

&nbsp;

�I saw your pussy.� When Dad was smacking your arse, I held your
legs, and I could see right up between them.�
Nice ginger pussy.� Cute.� Mum and Dad are going out tonight.� I�m going to have another look at it
then.� Just so you know.�

&nbsp;

Alone in the kitchen, she was over come
with misery.� The abuse she had suffered
showed no signs of relenting.� Quite the
opposite, her cousin had just declared the intention of violating her
further.� She knew there was no
escape.� There was nothing she could
do.� As if in a dream, she carried on
clearing away and started to prepare the evening meal.

&nbsp;

At meal time, she was made to serve the
food, still with her skirt tucked up , exposing her bottom, which was still red
from the earlier punishment.� As she
served her uncle�s meal, he reached up and stroked her bottom, saying �Still
sore, I see?�

&nbsp;

She flinched but resisted the urge to move
away,� �Yes, Uncle, a bit.�� She said in a small voice.

&nbsp;

�Teach you to remember then won�t it.�

&nbsp;

No one spoke to her throughout the rest of
the meal.� After they had finished
eating, they all left Cassie to clear away and wash up.� As she was washing the dishes Michael
approached her again.� This time her ran
his fingers over her sensitive bottom.�
She didn�t move, all resistance was ebbing from her with each passing
assault.

&nbsp;

�They�re going out soon.� Once they�ve gone, I�m going to have another
look at your little ginger pussy.� You�re
going to have to show it to me, you know.�
You�ll see.�� 

&nbsp;

She screwed her face up in misery and began
to cry, quietly to herself.

&nbsp;

Some minutes later Cassie and her cousins
were summoned to the living room, where her uncle spoke to the three of them.

&nbsp;

�Right.�
We�re off out for the night.� You
lot had better behave yourselves, or you�ll be sorry.� Michael, you�re in charge.� Anything goes wrong, you�re to blame.� And you two.��
He spoke to Cassie and Peter, �Any nonsense out of either of you and you
won�t sit down for a month.� Is that
clear?�

&nbsp;

�Yes Dad.�

&nbsp;

�Yes Uncle.�

&nbsp;

�Michael is in charge.� If he tells you to do something, you�d better
get on with it, or I�ll make you pay, right?�

&nbsp;

They both nodded.

&nbsp;

�We won�t be back until late, so I�ve asked
Mr. Jones to look in on you later on.�
Make sure you don�t give him any cause for complaint, or else.�

&nbsp;

Michael and Peter watched from the door as
their parents drove away.� Cassie waited
silently in the living room.� She knew
that the next few hours would be a torment.�
The thought of what her two cousins would do to her was enough to make
her shudder with fear.� She heard the
front door close, and their footsteps approaching.� They both entered the living room, looking at
her like she was a prize for them both to play with.

&nbsp;

�You heard what Dad said, right?� I�m in charge.� You both have to do what I say, or you�ll get
it from Dad tomorrow. Understand?�

&nbsp;

�Cut the crap Mickey, let�s have some
fun!�� Peter yelled.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

$$

&nbsp;

Michael grinned.� �Right then, bitch.� Get them out.�
Only this time, take your top off completely.� I want to have a good look.�

&nbsp;

Feeling like a cornered animal she started
to remove her T-shirt.� She knew that if
she didn�t comply with all their instructions, they would make up some
appalling story to tell her aunt and uncle, which would see her humiliated
further.� She dropped her T-shirt on the
floor, then reached behind her to unclip her bra.� She let it fall also, then stood in front of
them, head bowed, arms hanging limply at her side.

&nbsp;

�Fair play, cousin, you�ve got a lovely
pair of tits.� Now, I said I was going to
have another look at your ginger pussy, so get rid of the skirt and let�s have
a look at you.�

&nbsp;

�Please Michael.� Please don�t make me do this.�

&nbsp;

�Can you imagine what Dad will do if I
phone him on his mobile and tell him you�re playing up already?� He�ll have the skin of your arse!� Do you really want me to do that, bitch?�

&nbsp;

�No Michael.� Please don�t.�

&nbsp;

�Then get rid of the skirt.�� He said calmly.

&nbsp;

Tears started to run down her face again as
she slowly unfastened the clasp of her skirt and let it fall to join the rest
of her clothing on the floor.� She held
her hands in front of her, trying to protect what little modesty she had left.

&nbsp;

�Hands down, and come over to me.�� Michael ordered.

&nbsp;

She dropped her hands and slowly walked the
three or four feet over to him.� Standing
directly in front of him she could see him staring at her pubic hair.� She felt sick.� Her heart was racing.

&nbsp;

�Very nice.�
Very pretty.� Go and show Pete
then.�

&nbsp;

She turned and walked over to her younger
cousin, who was grinning openly.

&nbsp;

They both took it in turns to examine her
most secret place.� Then Michael made her
lay across his lap, face up, and began to explore her virgin pussy.� She closed her eyes in dismay as she felt his
fingers squirming between her thighs.� He
made her open her legs wide so her could �See the lot.�� 

&nbsp;

Then he pulled her lips apart and put his
head between her thighs, examining her inner pussy closely.� Her ran his fingers up and down her dry slit,
trying to push a finger into her cunt, giving up when he found it too dry and
tight.� Then he noticed her clit.

&nbsp;

�Hey, what�s this?�� He said aloud, and began to tease and tweek
the sensitive organ.� She groaned in
misery.� 

&nbsp;

�What do you call your pussy?�

&nbsp;

�I don�t have a word for it.�

&nbsp;

�Yes you do.� I bet you do.�
All girlies have a word for it.�
Come on, tell me what you call it.�

&nbsp;

�My foo.�

&nbsp;

They both shouted with laughter.� ��Foo?��
What the fuck is a �foo�?�

&nbsp;

She tried to blot out what was happening to
her.� Unfortunately, Michael�s attention
to her clit was starting to get to her.�
She had played with herself on a few occasions, and knew how sensitive
it could be.� Now strange feelings began
to radiate from her clit. 

&nbsp;

�And what do you call this?�

&nbsp;

�My button.�

&nbsp;

�What is it?�� Peter asked, eagerly. He was watching what
his brother was doing with fascination.

&nbsp;

�Tell him.��
Michael ordered.

&nbsp;

�My clitoris.�� She said.�
She felt so dirty, as though it was her fault.

&nbsp;

�What�s it for?�

&nbsp;

�Watch this.�� Michael began to rub it slowly, pushing back
the hood and concentrating on the super-sensitive head.� Cassie whimpered.� She put her hands over her face to hide her
shame.

&nbsp;

�Fuckin� hell!� She likes it!�
Let me have a play with it.��
Peter eagerly took his brother�s place, rubbing her sensitive bud.� His actions were fast and hard.� She heard a moan escape from her mouth, felt
her breathing quicken.� She blushed
deeply.� Michael began to stroke her
breasts, paying attention to her nipples, which began to stiffen.� She couldn�t believe the feelings coursing
through her body.

&nbsp;

They changed places again.� Peter started to stroke her breasts,
occasionally pinching her nipples.�
Strangely, she didn�t find this as painful as before.� Michael ran his fingers over her clit in
small circles.� Then he ran his fingers
down the entire length of her slit.� Her
slipped a finger into her hot hole.

&nbsp;

�Fuck me!�
She�s soaking wet.�

&nbsp;

She felt shame burning her face.� Peter wanted to feel too.� Her pushed a finger deep into her, making her
squirm around on Michael�s lap. Michael continued to torment her clit whilst
Peter buried a finger deep into her.� And
then she felt waves of pleasure crash onto her as she experienced the first
orgasm of her life.� Both boys let go of
her and watched, Michael with fascination, Peter with fear as at first he thought
she was having some sort of seizure! 

&nbsp;

�What the fuck was that?� What�s wrong with her?�

&nbsp;

�Nothing�s wrong with her, dummy.� She just got off, that�s all.�

&nbsp;

Cassie had curled up into a ball, consumed
with shame and humiliation.� She�d
thought it couldn�t get any worse when they�d made her undress in front of
them.� Then she�d been spread-eagled on
Michael�s lap while he amused himself by playing with her most secret place and
made her name it out loud.� But then her
body had betrayed her, had allowed her to be tormented until she had suffered
the ultimate shame.� She wanted to die.

&nbsp;

�What a hot little bitch you are, aren�t
you?� You really got off on that, didn�t
you?� Didn�t you?�

&nbsp;

Cassie sobbed some more.� Michael grabbed hold of her hair and yanked her
head back cruelly.� �I asked you a
question.�

&nbsp;

�Yes.� She sobbed.� �Yes I got off on it.� You made me do that.� Are you happy now?� Will you leave me alone now?�

&nbsp;

�Not a chance.� I haven�t had mine yet, and I may want to
have another play with your pussy.� Get
up and come over here.�

&nbsp;

She lifted herself off the floor where she
had fallen after her climax and walked over to Michael.� He had already opened his trousers, and his
stiff cock was standing proudly.� He sat
on a sofa, smiled at Cassie and said, �You know what to do.�

&nbsp;

She sat beside him, reached out and took
his cock in her hand.� The feel of it
wasn�t such a shock as before.� She
noticed how smooth it was, how warm and rigid.�
She was fascinated by the way the foreskin slid so easily up and down.� She noticed how she could affect him by
changing the speed or the depth of each stroke of her hand.� She noticed a small drop of clear fluid seep
from the opening.� On an impulse, she ran
a finger through it, then smeared it over the head of his cock. �Michael groaned with pleasure.� She held his shaft tightly, wanking his cock
with long firm strokes, increasing the speed.�
Suddenly, he gasped and shot stream after stream of sticky semen onto
her hand.� She was suddenly aware of how
hot it felt on her skin.� She began to
squeeze his cock in time to the spurts.�
He groaned again.� Finally, he
subsided, and fell back onto the sofa, gasping for breath.

&nbsp;

�Fuckin� hell, that was good.�

&nbsp;

She surprised herself by smiling at him. He
smiled back, and suddenly, they were both laughing.

&nbsp;

�What�s so fuckin� funny?� Peter
demanded.� This seemed to amuse them even
more, and they both fell together, laughing hysterically.

&nbsp;

�Hey, what about me.� I want mine now.�� Peter insisted.� Without complaint Cassie calmly seated herself
next to Peter and began to wank him.� He
lay back and closed his eyes, but Cassie kept hers on Michael.� He watched her constantly while she wanked
Peter.� Suddenly, Peter groaned, and then
he too shot streams of cum onto her hand.�
When he had finished, she stood up.

&nbsp;

�Where are you going?�� Michael asked.

&nbsp;

�To wash my hands.�� She said.�
They both burst out laughing again.

&nbsp;

When she returned to the living room, they
had both dressed and were sitting watching TV as though everything was
normal.� She sat next to Michael, and was
thrilled when he put his arm around her.�
She was still naked, but felt no need to ask to be allowed to put her
clothes back on.� She felt close to someone
for the first time in ages, and for the first time since she had arrived at her
aunt and uncles, she didn�t feel frightened.

&nbsp;

After watching TV for an hour or so,
Michael said that it was time she went to bed.�
She looked at the clock; nine-thirty, better than her bitch of an aunt
allowed.� She smiled again at Michael,
picked up the clothes she had dropped earlier and went to her room.

&nbsp;

She lay there for some time, trying to make
sense of her feelings for Michael.� She
couldn�t explain, even to herself, how she could feel anything but hate for the
boy who had done such awful things to her.�
The only thing she could think of in his favour, was that he hadn�t hit
her or done her any physical harm.�
Everyone else in the place seemed to take a delight in causing her pain
and anguish.� Her pussy was still wet,
she could feel it.� She started to slip
her hand down under the covers, when she heard someone coming up the
stairs.� She found herself hoping that it
would be Michael.

&nbsp;

She lay still as the footsteps approached
her bedroom door.� The door opened
slowly, she could just make out a head peering round the door, looking into the
darkened room.

&nbsp;

�Hello?� she whispered.

&nbsp;

The light was switched on and she blinked
in the sudden light.� When her eyes
became accustomed to the light she saw that it was not Michael, or even Peter,
but Mr. Jones.

&nbsp;

�Andrew asked me to look in on you all,
make sure you were alright.�

&nbsp;

�I�m fine, thank you, Mr. Jones.�

&nbsp;

�That was quite a spanking you received
today.� How�s your backside now?�� His tone was one of concern, but there was
something else in his voice which frightened her.

&nbsp;

�It�s fine.�
I�m fine, really.� Thank you Mr.
Jones.�

&nbsp;

�Maybe, I should take a look at it?� Make sure no harm was done.�

&nbsp;

�No!, Really.� Really, I�m fine, er I mean it�s fine, no,
I�m fine, thank you Mr. Jones.� I�m
OK.�� She stammered anxiously.

&nbsp;

�All the same, I still think I should take
a look.� Can�t be too careful.�

&nbsp;

He was advancing on her.� She started to panic.� Where was Michael, why didn�t he come and
stop this.

&nbsp;

�Where�s Michael and Peter?�

&nbsp;

�Don�t worry about them.� They�re downstairs watching football.� I told them not to disturb us.� They won�t come up here.� They wouldn�t dare.� Now, let�s have a look at you, shall we?�

&nbsp;

�No, please Mr. Jones.� Really. I�m fine, honestly.�

&nbsp;

�Are you arguing with me?� Do you want your uncle to punish you again?�

&nbsp;

�No Mr. Jones.�

&nbsp;

�Then roll over on your front, and let me
have a look at you.� See, I�ve brought
some ointment to rub on you.� Takes away
the sting, stops bruises.�

&nbsp;

He held up a small jar of pale coloured
cream.� She was frightened again.� There was nothing she could do to stop this
strange man from assaulting her.� He
moved to the side of her bed and pulled back the covers.� He grabbed her shoulder and forced her onto
her front.� She pleaded one last
time.� �Please don�t, Mr. Jones.�

&nbsp;

�Now be quiet, or you really will be in
trouble.�� His tone of voice had changed,
it was now unmistakably menacing.� She
felt him lifting the T-shirt she had been given to wear as a night dress.� He pushed it up until it was bunched in the
small of her back.� She had put on a new
pair of knickers before getting into bed, now she felt his fingers slip under
the elastic and start to lower them.� She
felt them slip over her bottom, then down her thighs, and finally down to her
ankles.� He pulled them off her
completely and dropped them to the floor.

&nbsp;

�There.�
That�s not so bad, is it.� I�m
just going to examine you.�� He sounded
like a doctor would, but his hands, when he touched her made her cringe.

&nbsp;

He ran his fat, fleshy hands over both
cheeks of her bottom.� Rubbing and
kneading the flesh.� He put his hands on
her thighs, gently easing them apart.�
She cried into her pillow.

&nbsp;

�Hush now, or I�ll give you something to
cry about.�

&nbsp;

He smeared something onto her skin.� It felt slippery.� Then he was rubbing it into her bare
bottom.� He pushed a finger between the
cheeks and found her tight little hole.�
She cried out again as she felt his finger pushing painfully against her
sphincter.� And then he had his finger
inside her bottom. She gasped and moaned with pain at the intrusion.� She could feel his finger moving around
inside her, it was the most uncomfortable thing she had ever experienced.

&nbsp;

After what seemed like an age, he withdrew
his finger.� She sighed with relief, but
could still feel the pain and discomfort from his violation.

&nbsp;

Then he forced her legs still wider
apart.� He began to rub ointment into the
skin of her inner thighs, getting higher and higher.� Then he put his hand on her pussy.� She cried out �No!�, and tried to get up from
the bed, but he put his hand into the small of her back and forced her
down.� She cried out again and again as
his fingers found her slit and began to fondle it.� Then he slipped a finger between her lips and
pushed it into her cunt.

&nbsp;

�Well, what do we have here?� Proper hot little bitch, aren�t you.�

&nbsp;

�Please don�t.� Please leave me alone. I won�t tell anyone,
please Mr. Jones, don�t do this to me.�
Please.�

&nbsp;

�I don�t care if you tell the world about
it.� Do you think anyone would listen to
a silly little girl like you?� Don�t be
ridiculous!�

&nbsp;

His finger had pushed deep into her pussy
now.� He was delighted to feel how warm
and wet it was.� He wondered what had
made her get so wet.� He knew it wasn�t
him.� He�d done this to many young girls
when he�d been head master of a special school for young tearaways many years
ago. Always the same, get them on their own, then break �em in.� They were always dry the first time, then
they�d get used to it.� This one though
was wet already.� So much the better.

&nbsp;

He opened his trousers and freed his
throbbing cock. He hadn�t had one this young in many years.� He was going to enjoy this!� He pushed his trousers down to his knees and
climbed between her spread thighs.� By
the time Cassie realised what was about to happen, it was too late.� She screamed, but he put a hand on the back
of her head and forced her face into the pillow.

&nbsp;

She was fighting to breathe, but she was
still aware of something pushing against the entrance to her pussy, something
thick and blunt.� She felt her lips
stretch to admit it, and then it was forcing its� way into her.� She whimpered as she felt her tunnel being
stretched and filled by the intruder.� He
had released his grip on her head and she could breathe again.� She felt the weight of his hips on her pelvis,
and then felt him start to pump into her.�
He forced his hands beneath her and began to grope for her breasts.

&nbsp;

He put his face close to her neck and
whispered, �That�s better, isn�t it.� Now
we�re all friendly.� Nice tits you�ve
got.� Nice and firm.� I like �em firm.� Big for a girl of your age too.� Nice juicy tits.� Your cunt�s nice and wet.� What you been thinkin� about to get it so wet
then eh?� Hot little bitch.� You enjoyin� this, are you?�

&nbsp;

�No.��
She sobbed.� �Please stop.� Please Mr. Jones, stop.�

&nbsp;

�What?�
Just when we�re getting friendly?�
I don�t think you want me to stop at all really. Just playing hard to
get, are you?� Well too late!� You�ve been well and truly got!� I want you to thank me for doing this,
bitch.� I want to hear you say �thank you
uncle Phil�.� Say it.�

&nbsp;

She felt his hand around her throat.� Terrified out of her mind she began to chant,
�Thank you Uncle Phil. Thank you Uncle Phil.�
Thank you Uncle Phil.�

&nbsp;

�And now say �fuck my tight little pussy
Uncle Phil��

&nbsp;

�Fuck my tight little pussy Uncle
Phil.� Fuck my tight little pussy Uncle
Phil.�

&nbsp;

Suddenly, he pulled out of her.� He rolled her onto her back and forced
himself between her legs again.� He
positioned his cock at her entrance and drove in again.� He pushed up her T-shirt, exposing her mauled
breasts.� He put his mouth over one
nipple and began to suck on it.

&nbsp;

�Now say �thank you for fucking me Uncle
Phil��

&nbsp;

�Thank you for fucking me Uncle Phil.� Thank you for fucking me Uncle Phil.�

&nbsp;

�Oh yes!�

&nbsp;

He groaned and she felt a warmth spreading
inside her.� He groaned again, and again,
then collapsed on top of her, gasping for breath.

&nbsp;

All she was aware of was his laboured
breathing and her sobs.� He lay on top of
her for minutes afterwards.� Finally, he
lifted himself off her and got to his feet.�
She started to straighten her T-shirt to cover her nakedness, but he
wouldn't allow it.

&nbsp;

�No.�
Keep it up.� I want to have a good
look at you.�

&nbsp;

He then amused himself by running his hands
over her young body.� He squeezed her
breasts, pinched her nipples.� Her made
her spread her legs as wide as she could so that he could examine her most
intimate place.� He ran his finger along
her slit, then pushed a finger inside.�
He showed it to her, still slick with their combined juices.

&nbsp;

�Lick it clean.�� He ordered.

&nbsp;

She tried to resist, but he gripped her jaw
painfully, forcing it open. Then he pushed his finger inside, rubbing it over
her tongue.� Her released her jaw and
made her suck the finger until it was clean.�
She almost gagged at the taste of his semen mingled with her own
juices.� Finally, he stood up and
fastened his trousers.

&nbsp;

�That was very nice, bitch.� I�m already looking forward to next
time.� Sleep well now.�� And he chuckled to himself as he left the
room.

&nbsp;

Cassie cried herself to sleep.
