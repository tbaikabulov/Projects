Danny was the first love of my life. I was nineteen at the time, Danny was younger but that was all right, he made up for our age difference by his unlimited enthusiasm and his devotion to me.
I lived on a farm. Danny came to live with us. He was an orphan, his father unknown, his mother killed in an auto accident. Danny was bereft, he cried constantly. I comforted him and we became inseparable.
We took long walks in the woods surrounding our farm. We had oak trees, many conifers, huckleberry patches and a stream that flowed languidly through the pasture. Our favorite retreat was a small clearing covered with pine needles in the midst of a small copse of evergreens. There in this peaceful, fragrant bower we would lounge. I would caress and stroke him -- he loved my attention.
We walked along the stream, occasionally catching an unwary crayfish then returning it to the water. Danny was very good at catching them -- he clearly enjoyed it.
One day as we relaxed in our private retreat, I had a slight discharge and took my panties off, pulling my skirt up to my waist. Danny took this as an invitation since my privates were exposed and had an attractive odor. Danny came to me and started to lick my labia.
I spread my legs, giving him better access. It was a new experience for me, the electric feeling surged through me, I breathed deeply, thrust my groin at him, urging him to lick me deeper. He eagerly lapped away while I had my first orgasms with him. I was so excited. I saw that he was becoming erect and he moved closer to my privates, clearly desiring entry. I lay back, encouraging him -- he entered me -- completely. I was his first and he was so strong, so vigorous. He thrust again and yet again, finally exploding with an orgasm. We lay quietly together as he spurted and spurted finally ending and withdrawing. We lay together on the pine needle blanket, gazing at each other, love in our eyes. Danny revived, his erection returning -- he nudged me&nbsp; -- I rolled over onto my knees, pulled my knees up under me, my behind raised high and eager. I reached around behind myself, pulled my cheeks apart to aid entry anew. Danny entered me again and seemingly without flagging he rummaged and thrust and thrust, finally having another orgasm. We remained together while he continued to spurt into me. I felt his prick -- I felt the sperm entering my vagina. Oh, my God!! The sensations to me -- a virgin -- were unworldly. I had never experienced such joy, such pleasure. Oh Danny, Danny I love you so -- I want you in me again.
After that, Danny and I were almost inseparable. We took so many walks in the woods. I took a basket with snacks and a blanket. I also learned that Danny was somewhat submissive and liked to wear a collar that I would put on him when no one else could see us. He knew that when I put the collar on him that sex was coming. I might even lead him with a leash as we strolled along the stream -- it was private -- no one would see Danny in his collar. It was something between us -- only us. I would spread the blanket on the pine needles, thrust my behind upward and Danny would enter me, screwing me most royally. I might spread the blanket on a log, lie down on my back, spread my legs well apart, inviting Danny to enter me again. Winter naturally demanded that we use the barn for our
passionate couplings. After father was finished with milking the cows, Danny and I would creep into the barn, find a soft place in the straw, spread the blanket and make love.
All good things come to an end. I had to think of a career or marriage or both. Danny was out of the question so I dated and finally found a mate. From time to time I returned to the farm and Danny and I would take a long walk, reprising our lost love and our passion.
I would think of him often, even now, years later with two children and my loving husband. I would lie in bed with John and reflect on Danny and our good times together.
Danny the Irish Wolfhound -- my first love!
