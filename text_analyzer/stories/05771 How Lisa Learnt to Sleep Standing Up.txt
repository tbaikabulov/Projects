Story Codes:� Mff/f nc blkml bd pony

&nbsp;

At twelve years old Jenny looked very cute
as she sat astride her dappled horse Bingo.�
She had been riding, or at least sitting on a horse while it was led in
walk and trot around the arena, since she was two.

&nbsp;

At fifteen hands two, Bingo was quite tall
for a young girls mount.� She also had a
mean streak a mile wide.� Jenny did not,
however, know this.� She had only owned
the horse for two weeks.� The only times
that she had been on her before, the previous owner had always ridden her for
an hour before Jenny arrived and so the horse was a lot more tired than the
beast that she now found herself on.

&nbsp;

Bingo was not behaving.� Although content to walk around the ring and
do simple manoeuvres, it was obvious that she did not want to be away from her
nice warm stables.� The other problem
that Jenny was having was that Bingo had been very well schooled and Jenny was
not asking the mare in the exact manner that she had come to expect from her
proficient previous owner.� Bingo, while
not being openly naughty, was performing the human equivalent of working to
rule.� She would only do what she was
asked and only when asked in the right manner.�
Jenny was outclassed and unfortunately Bingo knew it.

&nbsp;

Jenny was a proficient rider.� But then Bingo was a thoroughbred, hormonal
female.� The H brand on her rear left
flank testified to the quality of her German breed.� The twenty three thousand pound price tag
testified to the level of training and fitness of this twelve year old.

&nbsp;

Bingo was not the only horse that Jenny
owned.� Jenny was fortunate that her
parents owned a reasonably large farm and had an equestrian interest.� As well as the Hanoverian she now sat on,
there was also a twelve hand one chestnut gelding called Barney, who she had
ridden for two years and a midget pony called Broderick who was her
favourite.� While Bingo had been
purchased to help Jenny up her game in the dressage arena, Broderick was
trained to pull a small cart.� When she
was not practicing in the arena, Jenny could be found driving around the
country roads and bridal paths in her small cart and the two were regular
features at the local horse shows.

&nbsp;

�Why don�t we see how she behaves on the
lunge for half an hour?� her mother called from the corner of the arena.�

&nbsp;

�Sounds good to me.� It should calm her down a little and
hopefully tire her out enough to do something with,� Jenny responded as her
mother walked towards her carrying a lung reign.

&nbsp;

�Kelly, why don�t I video this and we can
have a look later, perhaps see if the problem is anything that Jenny is doing,
or if Bingo is just being stubborn?� her father shouted from outside the arena.

&nbsp;

�O.K.�
That would be good,� her mother called before continuing towards Jenny.

&nbsp;

Bingo was not having a good day.� She could not understand what the stupid
human on top of her wanted.� Was she
being asked, rather roughly, to slow down, or was she being asked for something
else?� Was the humans balance not as
good, or was the occasional pull on the reign a request to turn?� Bingo did not know but she was irritated and
now something else was coming towards her.�
It had front facing eyes, which meant that this was a predator.� It was also walking directly towards her,
square on.� A million years of evolution
screamed at Bingo that it was not happy about this thing coming towards her
with a long red thing in its had.

&nbsp;

Jenny was not happy.� She had asked for halt by squeezing her legs
around the mares chest and sitting �Lumpy� in the saddle while tensing the
stomach.� All of the right things to slow
the horse, including pulling gently on the reigns.� Nothing.�
Swearing she tried to turn her horse towards the side, presenting a nice
big obstacle for the horse to consider, but Bingo was having none of it and so
Jenny did the thing that had worked on every horse she had ridden.� She pulled the reigns hard to the left, gave
the animal a hefty boot in the ribs and brought her riding crop down hard on
the flank.

&nbsp;

Robert Bullman shed silent tears as he
watched the scene unfolding before him.�
He had watched this a thousand times and the result was always the
same.� Frozen in fascinated horror, Bob
watched the riding crop descend, almost in slow motion, watched as the horse
bucked and his daughter tried to pull the head back as Bingo put all of her
energy into a series of rodeo bucks that would see his daughter in a coma for
six weeks, recovering from a head injury that would leave her forever with the
mental age of a twelve year old and his wife crushed to death between the
horses one tone weight and the arena side fence.� The video image recorded all of this as Bob
had continued filming, too shocked to do anything else, until his stunned brain
had caught up with events and the camera had been discarded as the desperate
father and husband rushed to salvage his family.

&nbsp;

Bob leant forward and turned the video
off.� It had been ten years to the day
since the accident and it still hurt.�
But life goes on and he still had two daughters and a son to provide
for.� Medical bills had, initially forced
him to sell off portions of his land while, as his daughters health had
required time away from the farm, he had been forced to rent off land to tenant
farmers and invest the money in the city stock markets.� Although this had initially meant that he
could spend more time with his daughter, it was now forcing him to spend time
away from the farm as his investments had grown and he now owned several
companies.� He had become the thing that
he had once despised.� A gentleman
farmer.� However, it still allowed him to
spend quality time with his family, even if he was called away on the
occasional business trip.

&nbsp;

Lisa Holden had been working as a carer at
the Bullman farm for around six months.�
Every other weekend, Mr Bullman would have to go to the city and so Lisa
would have to baby-sit.� This suited her
down to the ground.� Before going to
university she had spent three years working in a care home and had an NVQ
level II in elderly care, as well as a few health and safety certificates, to
state that she was competent to look after special people.� Lucy was the youngest at eighteen, closely
followed by Richard who was five minutes older than her.� The oldest was, in fact the same age as
Lisa.� However, she had the mind of a
child, following an accident of some sort.�


&nbsp;

The fates had not been kind to the females
of the Bullman household.� Lucy had had
some complications during her birth.� Her
mother had opted for a home delivery.�
Unfortunately, Lucy�s umbilical chord had wrapped itself around her neck
during delivery.� Although the midwife
called for an ambulance as soon as she realised that there was a problem, it
still took an agonising nine minutes to deliver and resuscitate the child.� Nine minutes is an eternity to be without air
and as a consequence, although the mid wife was able to offer immediate
resuscitation and care, the girl had suffered irreparable brain damage and
would have to take a strong cocktail of medication to control the fits that
regularly occurred.� This combined with
an accident that had killed their mother and seriously injured their other
daughter was a crushing responsibility for the lone parent.

&nbsp;

At the moment Mr Bullman was in the city
and the children were playing horsy with Jenny. �They had clubbed their pocket money together
to buy a daddy saddle which� Richard had
strapped around his waste while Jenny squealed with laughter as she rode around
the living room.� It was obvious that
Jenny enjoyed horse riding and her two sibling tried to ensure that she could
continue to ride.� It was something of a
puzzle to Lisa.� There were stables
attached to the farm.� She had been inside
and found a tack room, complete with old bridles and saddles.� Although the tack room was proof against the
elements, it was obvious from the state of the leather that they had not been
cared for, in Lisas� opinion, for some time.�
Given Jennys� obvious interest, Lisa could not help but wonder why her
doting father would not buy her a horse.�
When Lisa asked the children about this they were evasive and Lisa
concluded that this was a sore topic and so left the mystery alone.

&nbsp;

Lisa was bought out of her musings by a cry
from Richard, who toppled over with a cry of pain.

&nbsp;

�Are you all right?� Lisa asked as the boy
lay on his side clutching the back of his leg.

&nbsp;

�Yes,� he replied through gritted teeth,
�It�s just a cramp.�� 

&nbsp;

Turning to Jenny he apologised for dropping
her on her rear.� Standing up he tried to
flex his leg, but it was quite a sever spasm and he had to limp around the room
in order to relax the muscle.

&nbsp;

�Sorry Jenny, but that will have to do for
the night.� I think that if this horse
gives you any more rides he will end up in the glue factory,� he said with an
apologetic smile.

&nbsp;

Jenny did not take this well.� She had been looking forward to her riding
session and the fact that the horse could not be ridden did not enter into her
plans.� Lisa had seen this behaviour
before.� Unless she diverted Jenny, she
would wind herself up into a scene that would match any two year old toddlers.

&nbsp;

�But you promised Richard.� You said that we would play horsy this when
Dad was away,� the young girl shouted as she folded her arms and stomped her
foot down in protest.

&nbsp;

�I can�t just now Jenny.� I have a bad cramp.� I will see how I feel in half an hour or so,�
Richard pleaded as he began to un strap the parent saddle, that was originally
designed for a four to eight year old child, but that had been slightly widened
by Richard who had learnt to work leather a few years ago and now made a nice
amount of summer pocket money by selling book marks, belts and other small
items to the tourists who came to the area.

&nbsp;

This was, of course, unacceptable.� She was just about to draw breath and tell
Richard how unacceptable, when Lisa intervened.

&nbsp;

�I will do it.� I don�t mind being horsy for a while,� Lisa
offered.

&nbsp;

Lisa felt slightly uncomfortable as the
girls gaze switched from her brothers to the proffered gift horse, or at least
that is how she felt as Jenny appraised her potential mount.� 

&nbsp;

Lisa felt that she would make a good horse,
given her size and stature.� She was
naturally long limbed; standing five foot eleven tall she was definitely tall,
although Lisa would have called herself lanky.�
However, Lisa was comfortable within herself.� It was not, after all, every girl her age who
still kept her hair long, platting it in several styles including pig
tails.� But then she felt that her long,
dark hair suited her tall body shape and self image perfectly.� Overall, she felt that she looked trim and
that her body shape actually suited her 36D breasts.� A fine mount indeed.

&nbsp;

This was also Jennys� conclusion and five
minutes later Richard had fitted the daddy saddle around Lisas� waste, over her
T. shirt.� 

&nbsp;

�Thank god,� Lisa thought, �that she had
worn jeans.�� There was no way that she
could crawl around on her hands and knees in a long skirt, or feel comfortable
in a skirt short enough to allow her movement.

&nbsp;

�Sorry, but Jenny likes to use reigns.� I have been using this,� Richard said holding
up a length of red chord, tied into a loop.�
�You just put it into your mouth and bite down.� That way Jenny can pull on the reigns and she
gets to keep contact as well as control the head.�

&nbsp;

Lisa had no idea what Richard was on about,
but had figured out that Richard wanted her to place the rope into her mouth
and bite down in order to keep it there.�
A few moments later, after a little bit of discussion, Jenny sat onto
her new horse, gripping Lisas� flanks as best she could and holding the reigns.

&nbsp;

Lisa felt the other girl squeeze with both
of her legs and thrust her hips forward as she flipped the reigns, making a
clicking sound with her tongue.� Lisa was
not sure what most of this meant, but she had seen enough films to know what
twitching the reigns and making a noise meant and so she started to walk
forward, as the other girl had directed, encouraged by Lucys calls and the look
of obvious relief on Richards face, now that someone else had taken on some of
the burden.

&nbsp;

Lisa spent the next half an hour being
directed around the downstairs of the farm house, until her knees and back
could not take any more and Richard was ready to play horsy again.� She must have done something right, since
although she tolerated her brothers efforts, it was obvious who she wanted to
ride.� 

&nbsp;

This carried on for some months throughout
the winter and into spring.� Over that
time Lisa would spend a good portion of her evening being ridden by the other
girl.� Richard put his leather working
skills to good use, making knee and hand pads so that they could both be
comfortable when playing horse.� Richard
even made a harness, Lisa suspected from some of the old horse tack in the old
stable.� Fortunately these did not sport
a metal bit, but used a wooden rod encased in leather instead.� The harness fit snugly around the head, with
straps running around the head and under the jaw, as well as a strap that
encircled the forehead, another strap ran and around the back of the head,
attaching each end of the bit.� All of
these straps were adjusted and tightened by buckles.� The old rope had now been replaced by a set
of leather reigns, which looked like they had once been used for a horse, but
had been shortened, probably by Richard.�
He had even fitted stirrups to the daddy saddle.� Lisa felt slightly humiliated in this get up,
but had to admit that it was more comfortable than trying to keep her jaw
clenched for long periods of time and the saddle was now a lot easier on her
back.� 

&nbsp;

As well as Jenny, Lucy would also ride on
whoever was saddled.� This, more and more
became Lisa.� However, this paid
dividends as Lisa became a part of the family, at least on weekends and the
children took her into their confidence and she learnt why the stables were
deserted.� Apparently after the accident,
which Lisa now knew, their father had asked a vet to put the animals down and
had sworn that his children would never ride again.� This explained why, she now knew, their
father had never brought a horse for his daughter, who he doted on in every other
way.� It also explained why the children
had, on the first night with the daddy saddle, asked Lisa not to tell their
father about the riding sessions.

&nbsp;

Spring arrived and with it came Jennys�
birthday.� This had fallen on a day that
Robert would have been away for the weekend.�
However, he had re-arranged his business trip for the following week so
that he could spend his daughters� birthday with his family.� It was for this reason that the children did
not show their unofficial present to Jenny until the following weekend.� 

&nbsp;

Lucy asked Jenny to come outside where
Richard had something to show her.�
Intrigued, Lisa followed to find Richard standing between the shafts of
a two wheeled horse carriage.� She
recognised it as the one she had seen in the back of the barn next to the
stable block.� However, the last time she
had seen it, the body had been a mass of peeling paint and rust.� The carriage now sported new paint and polished
metal.� It looked quite splendid in
yellow and black.� Unlike other horse carriages
she had seen, this had obviously been designed for a small horse and so looked
quite light in comparison to others that she had seen at the recent spring
fair.� This carriage, she concluded, was
made for a very small horse.

&nbsp;

Richard, she noticed, wore a thick leather
belt with chains on either side that attached to the shafts, which he also held
in his hands.� Somehow this arrangement
was still slightly taller than the arrangement for the obviously tiny horse
that would pull the cart, as the height of the shafts caused the carriage to
lean back slightly.

&nbsp;

All of this was beside the point as Jenny
squealed with delight and ran to the carriage and took up the long reigns which
were attached to Richards bridal.� A
quick flick of the reigns as she made a clicking noise was enough to get
Richard to walk and then increase his speed.�
Despite the bizarre site, Lisa could appreciate that he actually looked
good pulling this strange rickshaw and she imagined his bare chest sweating as
his young muscles worked to propel the car forward.

&nbsp;

Lisa came pulled away from those thoughts
quite quickly.� Richard may be relatively
handsome and quite muscular, but he was still four years her junior and one
thing Lisa did not do fantasise about boys that young.

&nbsp;

Jenny, while initially please, had decided
that horses did not walk on two legs and so Lisa had fetched the hand pads from
the tack room as Richard went down on all fours.� Although this made progress slower, Jenny was
obviously happier that her horse was in the proper position.

&nbsp;

Despite Richards best efforts though, he
was not Jennys� favourite horse.� That
honour had fallen, long ago, to Lisa, who soon found herself bent over on all
fours.� Unlike the horsy play in the
house, she could not get onto her hands and knees and still be tall enough for
the poles to hold the carriage level and so, like Richard, she had to adopt a
straight legged stance.

&nbsp;

Perhaps it was the fact that this was more
uncomfortable, or it might have been the way that her ass was thrust lewdly up,
but Lisa did not like this, she did not like this at all.� It was one thing to play horsy in the living
room, but this was becoming far too unhealthy.�
In fact, it had become a fixation.�
As well as this, because of her posture, it was very uncomfortable to
raise her head and so could not see where she was going.� In short, she soon became tired,
uncomfortable and had reached the point where enough is enough.� Unbuckling herself from the belt she stood up
and made her feelings known.� Despite the
bond that she had forged with the children, Lisa told how uncomfortable she was
and that she felt that it might be better if they did not play this game again.

&nbsp;

The children, especially Jenny, were
heartbroken.� Although Richard buckled
himself back between the shafts, it was not the same and reluctantly the
carriage was wheeled back into the barn.

&nbsp;

Several weeks passed without incident and
Lisa began to suspect that the childrens� unhealthy obsession had cooled.� Although Richard still acted as horse
occasionally, they time that the children dedicated to this game began to
diminish.

&nbsp;

One Saturday, Lisa relaxed on the porch
reading her text books.� Since she no
longer had to worry about being a horse and given the summer warmth, she could
now start to wear skirts again and had chosen to wear a short white skirt and
halter top to relax in.� It was another
hour before she would need to worry about cooking the meal and she could keep
an eye on the children as they played in the yard.� This was fine, but the children were not
playing, Jenny seemed to be getting worked up about something.� Lisa put down her book and got up from the
comfort of the sun lounger to investigate.�
She did, however, catch some snippets of the exchange.

&nbsp;

�Look we can�t not in front of Lisa,� Richard
protested.� �You know how she feels about
it.�

&nbsp;

�But I can�t play in front of Lisa, or dad
and I want to go out and now I can�t,� Jennys child like wine protested.� �It�s not fair.�

&nbsp;

Tears began to fall down the girl/woman�s
cheeks as Jenny was again denied.� Lisa
knew what this was about and, despite her reservations, could not help but feel
guilty.� Jenny would, because of her head
injuries, never understand why she could not continue to play her favourite
game.

&nbsp;

After some questioning, Lisa discovered
that while she had refused to play, Richard had been getting up at dawn, every
weekend when she had been baby sitting, in order to take Jenny for a run in her
carriage.� She was not surprised to learn
that Richard had been busy overcoming the initial problems with the set up of
the carriage and the horses equipment.�
Perhaps it was the guilt, or the fact that Jenny would never stop
crying, that Lisa found herself trying out the new equipment for herself.

&nbsp;

Firstly she placed a thick leather belt
around her waste.� This had a pair of
chains, at either side to connect to the shafts.� Another�
chain hung down from this next to the shaft chains and fed below her
ass, forming a cradle as it looped up to attach to the other side of the
belt.� Another chain ran over, what would
be the top of her rear flank, joining the other chain so that, when she was
bent forward, this would help to hold the cradle chain in position as it fed
around her rear.� This chain extended so
that two length would hang, one on either side to enable the shafts to be
attached at a second point.� Two
additional chains formed loops next to the belt buckle.� Richard explained that these were to guide a
second set of reigns.

&nbsp;

The next item Lisa could only describe as a
boob harness.� It was like a bra without
the cups.� It was made from a series of
leather straps that encircled her boobs and fed behind her back and over her
shoulders, so that the six straps were buckled together at a junction between
her shoulder blades.� Lucy helped with
the fitting, as Richard dutifully turned his back so that Lisa could feed the
strange garment under her halter, which she needed to undo to fit the strange
bra, before pulling back up over her exposed breasts and re-tying behind her
head.� More chains dangled from this, the
lower set attached to the belt, like some perverse suspender belt.� 

&nbsp;

Richards next alteration was to two sets of
boots that he had found.� The first pair
were a set of riding boots that he had cut apart and re-stitched and the second
pair he had found at the back of the tack room.�
These boots had never been intended for any purpose other than
fashion.� Although Richard did not know
it, they were his mothers.� She had
bought them as a prop to a vicars and tarts party, as well as for the obvious lustful
looks that they inspired from her husband.�
Originally they had been a pair of six inch, thigh length, stiletto
boots, but Richard had adapted them in a similar fashion to the riding boots.� 

&nbsp;

Richard had removed the Stiletto heal from
the thigh length boots.� He had fashioned
a metal plate for the front part of the boots inside.� He had welded bolts to the underside of the
plate, which fed through four holes cut in the soles of the boot.� These allowed Richard to attach the boot to
what Lisa thought were actual hooves, but which, as Richard explained, were in
fact moulded resin with four vertical holes drilled in them to accommodate the
bolts from the boot.� The bolts were
finally attached to a real horse shoe.�
Richard had used a hammer to pound the bolts until their heads were
flush with the shoe, acting as rivets that would hold the entire assembly
together.

&nbsp;

Lisa had to admit that the workmanship was
excellent.� Although she knew, because
Richard explained how they were made, one would not be able to tell that these
had been anything other than these strange hoof boots.� Additional buckles had been added to the side
of the boot to offer support.� One side
effect of this, given the thickness of the leather used, was that it was
impossible to bend the leg at the knee, once the buckles were fastened.� Lisa commented on this and watched with
growing concern as the next item was fitted and explained with what she
considered an unhealthy obsessive ness.�
However, she had agreed to this and it might damage her relationship
with the children if she went back on her word now.

&nbsp;

The riding boots that Richard had found had
received similar treatment.� In addition
to a set of hooves and buckles, most of the lower boot had been unpicked and
was now joined on to a wooden extension to the boot.� This extension had been attached to the
leather of the boot so that, when worn, it would effectively lengthen the
leg.� Leather had been glued to the
wooden extension so that it looked like the leather on the rest of the boot.� This was not, however meant to be worn on the
feet, but the arms.� A metal bar had been
attached inside the boot so that the wearer could grip the bar with their hand.� The original zipper had been replaced by
laces so that the strange hoof gloves could be tightly secured to the arms of
the wearer.� These were designed so that
they covered most of the arm, like a full length opera glove.� 

&nbsp;

Lisa listened intently, standing in her
strange leather and chain belt and hoof boots, as Richard fitted the strange
hoof gloves to her arm.� She dutifully
grabbed the bar at the bottom of the boot, so that her hand formed a fist.� Richard then laced her into the glove before
tightly buckling the straps over the top of the laces.� This was not that comfortable and Lisa found
that they were quite tight, so that she could not simply pull her balled fist
out of its tight leather embrace.

&nbsp;

The next item to come out of the tack room
almost made her balk.� But she had agreed
and would keep to her word.� It was a
leather yoke.� A large leather hoop which
Richard lifted over her head.� The upper
set of chains of the strange leather bra, two at the front and two at the back,
now clipped onto the leather yoke 

&nbsp;

�Richard, are you sure that I need all of
this stuff?� I mean, I am sure that it is
very realistic, but it seems a bit obsessive to me,� Lisa questioned as he
lifted the final item, head harness, towards her.

&nbsp;

�Trust me.�
I have tried this myself and it does make a difference.� Now open wide,� Richard asked as he brought
the bit towards the mouth.

&nbsp;

Lisa somehow doubted that he had worn the
bra but, despite her reservations, opened her mouth as the bit was presented.

&nbsp;

Richard buckled the bit in place fed the
reigns so that they hung, like a train behind her.

&nbsp;

�How�s that?� Is it comfortable?�

&nbsp;

Lisa worked her jaw in the familiar devise
before answering.

&nbsp;

�Ich ot oo add.� I ill ee all ight,� Lisa responded.

&nbsp;

�Good,� Richard smiled before helping Lisa
onto all fours and fetching the cart.� 

&nbsp;

Once Lisa was aligned between the shafts,
Richard attached the chains on the yoke, belt and rear flank, so that each pole
was attached to three chains.� Once he
had adjusted the chains so that the poles were close to horizontal, he went to
fetch his sister.

&nbsp;

Jenny was dressed in a fine, Victorian
style, riding outfit, complete with veiled top hat and ankle length skirt.� This had been her mothers.� She had worn it when driving carriages at the
local shows.� She also carried a long
riding whip.� Lisas� unease grew.

&nbsp;

Once Jenny had taken up the driving
position she twitched the reigns and flicked the reigns in the manner that Lisa
now knew meant she was to walk on.� Lisa
obliged and this strange procession of Lisa the carthorse and Jenny,
accompanied by Richard and Lucy walking either side, set off.

&nbsp;

An hour and a half later they had gone
perhaps three miles down the country lane and Lisa had had enough.� The extra equipment had made it easier, but
her back was starting to hurt, her joints were stiff and she felt very
uncomfortable and exposed.� She stopped
and started making grunting noises, despite Jennys� best efforts with the
reigns and the riding whip, which was nothing more than a pole with a long
length of string attached to one end and designed to spook the horse with a
fast movement.

&nbsp;

Richard undid the bridle so that she could
tell them what was wrong.� 

&nbsp;

�Sorry Richard, but I have had enough.� This is starting to hurt and I am not happy
about this.� Get me out of this now.�

&nbsp;

�O.K. we will turn back,� Richard replied.

&nbsp;

�No.�
This is painful, undignified and frankly unhealthy.� Get this stuff off of me.� It has gone beyond a joke,� Lisa fumed.

&nbsp;

�O.K.� Richard replied as he gave Lucy a
meaningful look.

&nbsp;

Lucy reached under the seat and pulled out
another leather harness, which she passed to her brother, out of site of
Lisa.� Richard removed the bridle with
the soft leather bit, while Lucy reached under Lisa to get to the belt.� They had planned for just such an eventuality.� Jenny had been very upset for some time and
her protective siblings had devised a way to force Lisa to resume her pony
play.

&nbsp;

Lucy clipped another set of chains to the
underside of the belt, the other end being attached to D Rings at the knees of
the thigh length boots.� While they would
not interfere with Lisas� walk, they were just short enough to make it
impossible for her to stand up.� Another
short chain was attached to the ankle of each boot, forming a hobble.

&nbsp;

Unaware of this, Lisa stood quietly as
Richard removed the bridle, which he had already unbuckled to remove the bit.

&nbsp;

�Look I am sorry Richard, but this has
become an obsession.� I think it would be
bett Unghh.� Oww.� Ichard.�
Ott arrr oo ooin?� Lisa protested as Richard brought the other bit to
her mouth and forcefully shoved it into place, quickly buckling the new, metal
bit into place.

&nbsp;

Lisa struggled and tried to get away, which
was when she noticed the chains attached to her boots.� The hobble prevented her from moving from the
spot, while she found that another chain stopped her from standing up, not that
she could have managed to given that fact that she was attached to the cart
anyway.� With her weight so far forward
and the fact that she could not bend her legs, or arms, she was effectively
imprisoned.� He struggles amounted to
little more than a pitiful shuffling and head twitching, which she soon stopped
when she realised how little she could actually accomplish.

&nbsp;

The new bit was made of metal and formed an
inverted V in her mouth from an articulated joint.� She could feel a large metal ring on each
cheek and also felt that there was a straight metal extension joined to this,
which went down past her jaw.

&nbsp;

Richard secured the head harness tightly
about her head before moving on to the rest of Lisas conversion.� The new harness sported another
addition.� Two flaps of leather were
attached either side of Lisa�s eyes forming an effective blinker.� Undoing the halter top, which was tied in
place by simple bows, Richard was pleased by the site of Lisas breasts as they
swung ponderously free of their material prison.� Richard then took a length of leather
attached to the back of the bridle and fed it through a buckle at the back of
the bra, pulling Lisas� head up sharply.�
Next he adjusted the straps that encircled her breasts so that they were
tightly clamped by the leather.

&nbsp;

While Richard was preparing Lisa at the
front, Lucy had been busy at the rear.�
She had unbuttoned Lisas� skirt and removed it.� Next the young girl pulled down Lisas�
knickers, which she lowered by unclipping the chains, one at a time, that were
attached to the knees, and then, once the knickers were pulled clear of these,
re-attaching the chain and repeating the process for the hobble.

&nbsp;

Lisa was mortified and struggled violently
at this unwarranted assault.� 

&nbsp;

The children had discussed long hours how
to ensure that Lisa cooperated.� One
method that would ensure that Lisa remained as Jennys horse was
humiliation.� That is why her clothes had
been removed and why the children had brought their parents digital video
camera.� Stills and video would be saved,
edited and used to blackmail Lisa into remaining in equine form while she baby
sat.� It was the prospect of causing
embarrassment that had prompted Richard to make the strange item that Lucy
retrieved from under the seat.

&nbsp;

Lisa was still protesting when something
hard was placed at the entrance to her anus and, after a little force, shoved
deeply into her ass.� Richard had made a
wooden but plug, with long horsehair attached to one end.� Lucy had just played pin the tail on Lisa in
a way that Lucy swore made the captured care worker whinny.

&nbsp;

The final item in Lisas� new attire was a
new set of reigns that addressed the second method of motivation and was
another reason for Lisas nudity.� Richard
fed a new reign through eye holes in the sides of the leather yoke and
attaching these to the lower holes in the metal bit, so that they formed an X
as they crossed over themselves.�
Adjusting, using buckles, Richard corrected the reigns so that he had
the desired length and that two evil looking clips attached to the leather
would clamp themselves onto Lisas� nipples.�
Richard did not know much about girls, but had read enough to know that
a girls nipples would grow when stimulated, or cold.� It was not cold and so Richard set about
playing with Lisas delicate buds until they were quite firm.� 

&nbsp;

Lisa screamed loudly into her bit as the
clips were painfully attached to her nipples.�
She had wondered at Richards intent, worried that he intended to rape
her.� But she had not expected this.

&nbsp;

When she had calmed down, Lucy adjusted the
length of the reign again and, with Richard help, fed the reigns through the
guide chains and attached two new clips, one to each pussy lip.� It took Lisa longer to settle down this time,
but eventually she stood still as the children passed the reign up to the cap
and pulled another reign over her back and attached the free ends to the upper
holes in the bit.

&nbsp;

Lucy undid the hobblechains, while Richard
videoed their captive.� Jenny reached
under the seat and brought out a real whip, of plated leather.� Grabbing the reigns with on hand, Jenny
flicked the reigns as she wielded the whip, which landed on Lisas exposed rump,
causing her to flinch as she set off, crying loudly into the bit at the sudden
pain in her ass, nipples and pussy.

&nbsp;

Two hours later they returned to the
farm.� Unhooking her from the cart they
attached the knee chains and led her to the stables.� She was led into a stall with fresh straw.�� The yoke and head harness were removed and a
new, bit less head harness was placed on her head.� The chains that had attached the yoke to the
bra were removed, along with the rear chains that had sat on the girls
rump.� Lisa had screamed as the clamps
were removed from her delicate areas and fresh blood rushed into her tortured
flesh.� Lisa just did as she was
commanded as the Jenny got her ready for the night.� She was scrubbed with a hose and sponge and
her tail removed.� Richard continued to
video her until she was ready for bed, a cut down horse blanket covering her
flanks and a bowl of home made trail mix secured to the wall at head height.

&nbsp;

�You are now Jennys horse Lisa.� I am sorry that it has had to come to this,
but you left us no choice.� If you behave
we might remove the clamps next time.�
But if you do not show up next week, or if you tell anybody, we will
start letting people know about this interesting web page that you have
made.� Good night Lisa, or should I call
you Lucky.� Get some rest as you have a
busy day tomorrow.� 

&nbsp;

Lisa was in pain, from the marks that the
whip had made and by those awful clamps.�
She could not lie down because of the boots.� If she got down, she doubted if she could get
up and as for peeing, she did not relish the idea of finding a corner.� She eyed the trail mix with disdain.� Funnily enough she had lost her appetite.

&nbsp;

Lisa paced around her stable until
eventually, exhausted, she found out how to sleep standing up.

&nbsp;

The End.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Little did the siblings know that when their mother died that they, both father and Mother had a great love of bondage and would tie each other up as the kids slept though out the estate. He knew the kids picked up on this and this and would enjoy the lifestyle but he had hoped that the kids would figure things out or seek guidance&nbsp; for themselves but he after several observations of their bondage play and their never ending need to allow jenny to play them for fools he called me into play as the new baby sitter to end this.&nbsp;&nbsp; My name is "Lisa" and the siblings will soon learn that I happen to be their Elder Sister who's here to help out her Father.&nbsp; This is my story about bringing rules to their games as Father came across some videos the siblings made as he reviewed some of the better times he had with his wife, which further got his goat which he never approved of which Lisa agreed with and knew how to set right for the family as Father smiled.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A day prior before the latest and the last attempted blackmail attempt of both meet in the war room of which they only new of, and chatted about there fears and their need to teach the siblings a lesson and her enjoyment of seeing the kids make fools of themselves. They had agreed something was in the air and that Lisa would end their play as soon as possible; as stuff was well hidden in the barn area along with some needed food stuff if things go dicey.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Father felt the plan would be going into action as the kids returned from schooling as he viewed them heading toward Lisa who was near the barn area, she was seen agreeing to be Jenny s pony for a while; but little did the kids know they had felled into fathers plan as he viewed and overheard the upcoming scenes in a flow of never ending horror; as the kids tried to catch it all on film and video with hopes to use as additional blackmail but he was Reassured seeing a thumb up from Lisa, and Rescue was not needed. He knew she had the trio right where she wanted them clearly hanging, themselves showing no remorse or feelings.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They left her painfully harnessed as the kids left and wondered back to the main house which left a pain full hurt feeling in father which eased as he saw Lisa had freed herself after seeing some weakness in the trios restraints and eating and stretching. They chatted as she fearlessly left the barn and trotted about which loosen her up as they figured out how to deal with jenny the brat. It continued into the evening as they chatted on and wept together deciding there was no other choice.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Father noticed a blinking light from the war room and then alerted Lisa to play dumb some more back at the stall where she was left by some nasty siblings as they approached .

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lisa who was 22 and a genius with a younger body to die for had more then enough time to get to get back to the barn stall and re attached herself and go into her dumb expression mode well before they came back into sight with gleeful smiles. Then unhooked her from the carriage and all the while Richard was taping as father was screamed in anger watching them release her and then hose her down and scrub her open sores and re attaching a new bit less the head harness and then some pain filled knee chains which they had hoped would cause her to learn to Sleep Standing up and then placing her to bed down in a fresh stall.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucy was then overheard by father hearing her tell Lisa that she was to be Jenny s horse and if you don t show up as we planned or tell anyone we would start showing what we have on you over a web site you have which really got, fathers goat as the siblings trotted away thinking they had her, but little did the kids realize they did not. . 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Father kept a sharp eye on the trio as they trotted back to the cozy homestead as he alerted a trusted servant Miss Kim to - " take off the kid Gloves " and she happily agreed as the siblings approached. And the other eye was locked on Lisa as she did not await an all clear he smiles broadly as he watched her retrieve several tools and painfully freed herself from all restraints and then stretched out on the hay to relax and blissfully played with herself in the hay. He then connects with some inter net friends and watches several minutes later as a certain web site is seen closing up for good.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He then went into living room as the kids were squabbling over which seat on the comfy couch was best for watching TV they went for position as Miss Kim viewed the tug of war as pop lay ed down over their feet and head on a fluffy pillow resting as Miss Kim worked her magic.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Pay attention you three" said Miss Kim as she waved a stiff cane if front of them "What did you get on this weeks test " she addressed to all three kids "85" jenny squeaked 82 " was heard from Lucy and "78" from rich " That will be four for each of you ," now remove your tops and hands behind your back as she continues and then uses handcuffs to secure them as she moves to the front and proceeds to add four clothes pins to three sets of perky nipples before her as the kids bare up to it she then goes on to set a timer to 20 minutes as the kids fearfully peer that way then she retires back to the kitchen area to tidy up. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elsewhere Lisa had come in the back way and relaxed on fathers bed . The kids held up during this session as father freed them as the timer went off, and they chatted awhile as he looked them over as they watched TV. They seemed happy as they thought of pony fun the next day if only they new; as father spotted his camera bag which he picked up as the kids chatted over what to watch next without alerting them as he slipped out as Miss Kim has them say goodnight and behave now please in a voice that gets respect.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Father enters the bedroom and proceeds to join his loving daughter in bed as she jumps to hug him and thank him for rescuing her as the kids are spotted getting in bed for the nite. Before the kids arise she returns to her homestead and some needed rest after being with Pop.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next morning father hears the lawn mowers working in the distance as he eats breakfast as usual with Miss Kim. As a rumble is heard and the kids are seen racing out the door skipping breakfast chatting away as father smiles at Miss Kim he as he then uses a special remote to view a live feed from the barn area over the kitchen TV as the kids approach an the stall and freeze in their tracks as they view the area before them with shock as Lisa is not there only a pile of cut up restraints is seen as they examine the straw closer. As they notice in the corner a pile of bended metal and wheels, which is all that is left of the cart. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As Lucy and Jenny fell to their knee s Richard went for a trot trying to figure out what happen as father came to the stall area "Hey you lazy bones there s nothing in they are come now and help the old man" and continue as he saw them in a panic state whispering he asked "Are you, kids OK you seem sick - out of it" he said as they perked and answered OK hear as they helped dad out with his work as Richard continues to search for Lisa for several hours and later returns empty handed to help out father until the early afternoon and then some get lunch as the kids come together and chat over some important matter.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Father then chats with the kids "Hey you, kids I've got to show you a our new investment and its land so lets hit the road for a short trip" he smiles broadly as they head for the car and some miles later they come up to extended driveway capped by a dark green Mansion surrounded by vast green fields as they come drive up to the main house as he warned to behave them when they inside.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The kids are giddy as they ran about the rolling grounds opening every door in sight and getting into everything as Pop went in the Mansion as his Lisa awaited him with a hug. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The kids finished their adventures and they knocked on the door and waited for someone to answer; a pretty female answered and introduced herself As Miss Angel a friend of the owner and addressed the children " Well you must be Rich, Jenny and Lucy; I've heard a lot of you from your father come in and join us" upon hearing that they sit next to Father who's in a glamorous large living room as Miss Angel called up to the owner " They are here and a reply was heard Thank you coming down " The Owner can hardy wait your father talks a lot about you. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the kids can blink footsteps are heard coming closer as a figure to die for comes into view and as a voice addresses the trio " Hi guys I think I got yah " Lisa States as the kids seem to be leaking on the couch as they see her before them " well guys it was not nice what you did to me" as she nods to Pop so what is going shes asks the three sum as she proceeds to cozy up with Pop as the kids start to freak out and cannot find their voices as they watch the antics before them as Father has one other twist to add to their discomfort " Kids while your here I your old enough to here this" he turns to Lisa.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "My full name is Lisa Holden Bullman "which makes me your elder sister she pulls out her drivers license for the kids to read and your New Mistress and I think I own your tushyies for what you did to me; I could have stopped it but needed to see how far you had go as a video comes on as father nods as the kids see them self's as some foul language comes from them as they realize they are busted as faces turn to purple is heard which gets a stern warning from Lisa " Do not ever let me here that again you three do you understand me Yes the reply" Yes! what ! do you three call me here and in public" Mistress and Miss" yes she that is right and don t forget as Father nods and turns to speak; I was married before I met your mom and we had Lisa and then she died from a sudden stroke and then I met Patty we hit it off and we enjoyed our bondage games safely I gave my kid a life since she was all I had at the time; Lisa then went to give father a back rub. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As the as the kids continued to moan quietly and recovered as Lucy was heard to squeak " We did not that you were our sister she cried out and jenny would not get off our backs for a pony as jenny punched her for telling as Lisa warned jenny to behave or else which calmed her down as rich added that he was sure no one would care or tell as father felt ashamed at what he heard.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; As another car quietly comes up to the rear entrance as a four sum enters the house out of sight of the trio as Lisa answers her phone " Kim here lets do it" and nodded.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OK you kid as Lisa shakes her head which brings a new wave of fear over them as she states the web site that you threaten me with is closed thanks to some friends. You kid upstairs and clean yourselves up you've pee d on yourselves seeing their red eyes and tears and smell as Angel awaits " You will obey Angel so get " You three up here now and get undressed right now, I am taking all your clothes strip everything off now as they slowly fearfully remove all their clothes and they are handed over as Angel directs them and not a word is uttered among them as Angel continues; jenny you in there and use the bath tub and you two in there for the showers. As a car is heard driving off.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After you are done come downstairs and wash every crevice please. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After a while the trio appeared squeaky clean downstairs all wrapped in towels as Lisa and Angel address them "Off with the towels you three and backs to us bend over and grab your ankles" as they approach pulling some rubber groves on and slowly, painfully feeling them up as Angel keeps them down as they find this enjoyable seeing young butts shaking " Your Father left in tears after seeing your shameful behavior " as she goes second butt; and then continues to the last moist butt and fingers her extra ruff. " Stand up and turn around Lisa commands as she removes her gloves you are all clean and virgins keep it that way, you three name your best friend right now ' Judy-Beth-Toni' is heard in a whisper from the trio.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OK you three come here in front of a marble staircase and do not move as Lisa goes up several steps and calls out " Now Miss Kim as shes comes to the top of the stairs, " Judy come here now, Beth here and Toni here and don t move" as the trio at the foot of the stairs can t believe the nude gagged beauties at the top of the stairs and free ashamed for what did to Father and their sister Lisa; Judy come down here, Beth here and Toni here now please as they line up behind their partners, OK you three open wide; wider now please as the gags are shoved in the mouths and make sure those gags are tight and locked on your bondage partners as Lisa walks by in front and pushes in the ball as it pulled from the rear as she gives directions until nice tight fits are seen. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "OK Listen up as Lisa wields a wicked looking cane" and taps Judy, Beth and Toni to move up next their partners as she continues " You three are here because your parents love you to death and are concerned about yourself bondage play and the fact that you've all been caught at it, yes they nod and smile also these three rich, Lucy and jenny have named you their best friends as heads nod in agreement OK you six you will always call us Mistress in house or Miss in Public, you will obey without question in house or in public and lastly you will never have bondage games without one of us being there, you hookup with one of these friends no one else ever then call us got me! They are seen agreeing.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh one last thing in case you don t know I happen to be Lisa Bullman their elder sister and these three are my siblings and this is my house as moans are heard as they sense what shes been though the fire in her eyes and not to be crossed; she continues my dad needs help with the kids and Pop was right after being their sitter for a period of time he was right so here I am as the kids know their place and realize someone cares. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You three girls upstairs now Miss Kim commands as they go up the steps and knowingly stop at the as Kim joins them at the top beaming and Lisa has her three face the stairs as Kim tell has her girls turn around and tells them " You did the right thing by stopping here without being told " , you know what we expect from you - like get there and stop but never stop out sight. I hope that makes sense yes they nod so don t ever play us for fools you've all tired that with your parents but never again we can chat later about this but for now watch quietly you might be next. Little do they realize that father is there watching.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; OK for you three I have diapers you have a choice as they cringe you can put them on yourself or we can call down the girls and they will happily lube you up and snap you in as Lisa holds three tight fitting diapers before them which they take having no choice as Miss Kim goes up to her three and calls them to her, " I shall remove your gags" but you will be civil to one another and keep the chat low, one of you vacuum the rug here and they other two clean the bath tub and shower everything is in that closet. Any Questions or comments nows the time you three as she sits on a sofa and listens in.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lisa watches as brother and sisters slowly pull the diapers on and tighten them up for a snug fit as she has them walk out to the larger barn and has them go in. As they size up the place Lisa goes over to unlock an electrical box and pushes a yellow button which lowers large church bell to the ground from up in the barn steeple as it comes to a rest, Lisa eyes the bell and then directs them onto the extended lip of the bell facing outs backs up tight against as they are taking this all in and carefully repositions them along the bell lip for balance. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Angel then comes out with a huge roll of shrink wrap as they proceed to wrap several layers around the bell securing the kids tightly to the bell casing after which some grey trap is used as a final measure to lock the kids in place as Angel pushes the green button which pulls the bell back up some 40 feet back into the tower as Lisa climbed up some flights of stairs to the bell landing to address a frighten kids as she eyed them for several minutes and stared at her watch "OK you three brace yourselves" as gears are heard starting up as the and I a slowly heard to clang in ten PM with its riders " Yes you are on a working clock here and yes you will have a fun nite here, as bulging eyes are seen after the ride, She goes on You will never know how much you've hurt us but after to nite we should feel better, if I ever hear of you three plotting against me again or anyone playing games without supervision I will bury the three of you alive got me, if you behave I will free you at 5am and use your diapers that is why you have them on she giggles as the kids seem to accept this hard love I will check on you in a while bye and then returns down the stairs to see angel watch the tower video as she then returns to the house to catch up with father and get some sleep.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The time is slowly heard passing from the clock tower as Angel keeps a watchful eye on them seeing that they aren't harmed as Lisa comes back out having a sisterly concern to check them and relieves Angel who returns to the house and sleep; just after the clock strikes 5am the bell is lowered by Lisa as it slowly comes to a rest the siblings are unwrapped and smile broadly as Lisa addresses them " I am removing your gags" it's OK to chat but keep in civil and low, as they surprise her by stepping up and kissing her on the cheeks as shes smiles back at them knowing they are in need of discipline as they head back to the house to get some sleep keep it down people are sleeping here, Lisa directs them to the beds tells them to wash up then bed please as she collapses into one to enjoy show before sleep. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The morning comes as Lisa and Kim are in the kitchen cooking up some eggs and pancakes as the smell awakens the others as Kim goes to see whats up as she tip toes up to peek.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hello you kids, you are to help one another make the beds as she then feels up some wet diapers, you three take them off and wash up then get dressed from the clothes we have in the closet for you I will help and then you will present move it they shower and goes on to check on the girls seeing a pillow fight going on she watches from a safe distance then goes in as pillows fly which she catches stopping the action " enough for now you three, wash yourselves up get dressed from clothes in the closet I will help in a bit then present" as they nod in agreement as Kim smiles as she pops back and forth making sure the skin tight rubber suits fits in all the right places.


&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Some minutes pass by before clean rubber clad corsetted bodies are seen at the top of the stairs, as Kim looks them over she nods and sends them down for breakfast as Lisa greets them " Hi hope you all slept well and you kid enjoyed hanging out last nite," we have some work on the grounds to do beaming an overwhelming feeling of love our way. You all look so great in your outfits as she sees them wiggling; sit down spread out relax we have breakfast for you as Kim serves eggs and pancakes juices and she comes around to snug uptight some loose areas she noticed in the outfits they have on as she chatted to Jenny quietly "You've hurt Pop and then me" badly as she tightens a strap up so I came out of the back round moving on to Lucy to watch over you as Lucy feels her cosset tightens up as jenny is heard to squeak we did not know, and what jenny as they continue she sternly reminds them Lucy answers "Mistress" as they chat and eat as Lisa goes on as for you three your here because your parents love you need I say any more, nodding in agreement and smile they seem to get it.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Sometime later they head out to the barn where a new lawn has been planted just as Lisa and jenny head inside as Miss Kim comes up handing out gloves and utility knives several minutes later a tractor loaded with bales of hay as it seen slowly criss crossing as jenny pushes bales off and jokes with her sister she understands that father needs and loves umn dearly " do not you ever play stupid with us, guess what needs to be done Kim asks" as jenny is heard shouting, get your selves out here and spread this out she giggles as Lisa smiles as the rest get it and slowly pitch it as the tractor drops bales off till empty than stops as jenny jumps off and engages the group in a hay war as Lisa joins with Kim to toil on as do the kids, some time later angel brings out some snacks and drinks to the work gang for break as the job gets done several hours later as Lisa shouts " Well done all " the seeds are protected as they collapse and roll in the hay feeling wanted. Lisa then drives the tractor back into the barn and parks as father leaves after seeing how things went goes home as Lisa and Kim trot in. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; After several minutes more of play the kids worn out flop down back at the house from the work but with a certain glow as Lisa gets off the phone. Some minutes later horns are heard in the drive way, Girls Lisa says your parents are hear to take you home as this catches the girls off balance, Yes Mistress is heard realizing this no game, as Lisa adds before they depart, you will obey your parents wishes or else umn should I say that the outfits can become your schools clothes, need I say more girls as they badly shaken feeling different, needed like never before as she walks them to the cars adding see you as they drive off and later the parents sense a profound change and hope.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Later Kim takes the siblings for back home for dinner as pops is cooking up a storm with some steaks and fries as the kids help want to help out and chat so much to say. The chat never ends as it comes time for bed and then off to school as all is back to normal for now.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The next couple of days go well for the siblings but on the third morning Lisa answers the phone it's from Mother a Mrs Rose who's girl Patty is at Lucy s school she pals around with saying how upset she is about Lucy trying to involve her patty in some pony games with handcuffs since and then mentioning Lisa so I called her father which lead me to call you now, Yes I understand Mrs Rose; I will see to it right away as they chat then hang up. Lisa giggles, smiles happy they did not fix this sooner.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lisa hits the road and several miles later shes at Jennies s school giggling up to the main doors she pauses reading school name giggling some more as she walks bye classes in session to find the main office hoping that the Bullman name is enough to get her in without placing a call. She strolls into the main office and sees someone a lady, nice looking who raises from her desk to ask Lisa "Yes may I help you " yes I am here to see my sister jenny, I am Lisa Bullman and I need to find her, which class, yes Miss Bullman, happy that she knows us, she types jenny into a PC and finds her as she tells her third door down on the right as she heads out finding it knocks on the door as a teacher responds letting her in as jenny sees someone of the family shes raises as shes been taught and waits as the teacher asks how may I help you as she admires a respectful class " Yes I am Lisa Bullman I am jenny s elder sister as jenny is seen nodding in agreement as the teacher agrees and has her get, she follows her sister out into the hallway as they chatted I am so proud of you and Father she quietly says, yes we care deeply so much for you all and is it OK if we go out tomorrow Lisa asks just us two for some girly things you need a haircut and then your choice lets have some fun as they hug shes suggests " bowling", yes Lisa replies that would be fun as the smiles as warmth overtakes her. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I need to ask you something about your brother and sister Lisa says have you ever heard them mention " Patty" in their plans to hurt me and I think you pushed your brother and sister into the pony plan, so I have diapers here we don t need it for now, she squeaks dodging a bullet, she pulls her sister over, they think I am dumb and talk down at me so I make a fuss OK I understand but no more fussing or playing without us being around I and father can fix giving a shaky nod, this we do enjoy some play but first what to you know about patty Lisa quizzes her, yes over the cell about having fun with you and a cart, OK Lisa says this must stop you and your sis and brother must never tell what we do it must never be talked about outside of the family me and Father would not like this she smiles and fuss s over her hair adding it's not your fault, yes miss I think it is but I, I never thought it go as far as it did jenny moans, I just feel left out to often, it's OK kid now back to class and not a word to any one, you must trust me you will not be left out any more shes smiles back with trust then returns to her class.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lisa then exits the school and cross s the street to have a chat with the two high schoolers as she nears the high school entrance she chuckles reading a plaque thanking someone called Bullman for a land donation as she smiles and continues to the main office and gets recognized, is then told where Lucy and Richards class rooms are as she heads to Richard's class she knocks on the door as a female teacher answer "come in " Lisa does with smiles admiring the calmness in the history class " hi rose remember me " Lisa bids her as she glances back seeing the fire in her eyes, as Richard stands up showing as he's been told to do if he knows that party showing respect " Yes its Lisa right nice to see as they hug, chat for a bit, yes still a teacher rose, says and you Lisa, studying law part time and here to help my father, turning to Richard telling him to go get his cell phone and wait outside the door " he is heard saying " Yes Miss.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "she smiles back as he leaves with a warm feeling, as they chat on as class continues until a light tapping is heard and waits shes exits and hugs rich as they walk and chat about school, girlfriends as they go down the hall and up to a class room door she knocks hears a voice asking her to enter she as Richard waits just outside " Hello Annie got Ya teach" she draws her gaze to see who would use her first name in class as Lucy is seen to arise and waits as Annie replies " hi miss Bullman " they chat on as Lisa tells,teach she needs to borrow her sister yes nods OK as Lisa turning to address her Sister " Lucy go get your cell phone then wait for me in the hall " going out she becomes even more concerned seeing her brother in the hall looking puzzled at one another they chat for a moment as she then goes to retrieve her cell phone and returns and calls into Lisa saying shes back. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Saying bye to Annie she leaves going out to the hall telling her Sister and brother they must read something just outside the main doors, as they read this plaque they realize that Father gave the town the land the school is built on giggling she says Pop is famous Lucy says as they realize in their hearts Lisa did not lie and does care.

Ok you two back inside and sit, wait while I will check something in nurses office as they see a hall bench and sit chatting away. 

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lucy returns and sits between them " Give me your phones need to see the logs she commands " reviewing the record rich is clear then Lucy's logs have a problem as she tugs on Lucy asking " what can you tell me about patty, a moaning is heard echoing in the hall as Lisa goes on, her Mom called me something about a cart, handcuffs and gray tape to someone as rich is heard groaning that happens to be me she turns saying yes Richard as she leans back you two explain now please, well Richard starts we did not know who you are and figured , hang on it should not matter as she cannot believe what she hears as Lucy says we meant to give patty a spin when you came back on Saturday she moans getting busted.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "First no more cell phones for now you two, you are never to speak of our games outside the family or speak to patty again she is very upset and if you betray our family again, well come here into the nurses office something to show you, " Hi you two a familiar voice is heard guys as Angel to their horror address s them this is my sister her name is Jeanie , take off your shoes pants and undies as fearfully come off Lisa exits and she works here everyday as Angel drops some packs of diapers before them, a friendly warning next time we will be changing them here, need we say more, " No Mistress is heard " OK now get dressed Lisa is waiting " Thank You " they both say for not forcing us, Lucy whispers and trying to trust us as they exit into the waiting Lisa.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Well do you two get my drift, if you fail the family again you will find yourselves in diapers in school, I will not allow Father to be hurt Lisa states. Also please do not leave your sister jenny out in the cold anymore shes very lonely and needs us all, and don t play dumb with me you can include her more, please!&nbsp; Any questions if not back to class as they come forward giving her a peck on the cheek as a " Yes Miss" is heard from the both of them as the both go back to class realizing the other foot had been dropped ,they are busted and still loved or else Lisa would not be here.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lisa with a spring in her step finds her car and looks forward to a calming soak in the tub after getting home and a deeper trust amongst the kids and understanding of the family, looking ahead to a new sun rise.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; End of Part two -
