Master's Hand
Provided By: BDSM Librarywww.bdsmlibrary.com
Synopsis: A poem, relating a scene where innocent back scratching becomes a bit more like an endurance test...and to escape the pinching pain, the sub must come closer into her Dom's embrace. An ironic and erotic twist.
Master's Hand

Encased in tight arms,
Cuddled, caressed, 
I release into soothing warmth,
As Master's Hand
Scratches my back,
Explores my hair, 
A moan escapes as fingers entwine.
Lost in the blind comfort
of a gentle night.
Chameleon prey:
Realizing too late as the pain invades...
Unceasing...
Fed by resistance, 
A prison of unyielding will, 
As Master's nails take their due.
Short reprieves beguile trust 
As a voyage continues downward,
Each part gently caressed,
Prepared...
Before its fall,
Once craving, now fear,
Senses betrayed
By refuge turned lesson of
Anticipation's sharper edge.
A wild, imploring glance
Meets blue steel,
Welding squelched pleas into comprehension,
Acceptance,
And then sweet tokens of thanks...
for Master's pleasure,
Master's prison,
Master's Hand.
