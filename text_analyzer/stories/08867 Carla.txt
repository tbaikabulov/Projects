Synopsis:      A suspicious and obnoxious girlfriend gets what's coming to her...






Carla

This story is fictional (much as it pains me to say) and, if it does in any way resemble anything close to reality, it is entirely coincidental. The first chapter is slow, but any following chapters will be very graphic.

She sat at a desk, leg nervously thrumming away as the meaning of what she read crashed through her. Taking a deep breath, Carla leaned back in her chair, wincing against the sharp sound of creaking wood. She was taking a stupid risk as it was &#8211; spending any longer in the office than necessary was asking for trouble, and their relationships was strained at the best of times. But she needed a moment to recover from what she had learned. He was going to propose. That was the big secret, the mystery &#8211; the cause of all her anxiety. A smile crept across her lips as she eased out of the chair and across the room, carefully turning the brass handle, slipping out into the hall, and locking the door behind her. 

For over two weeks he had been lying to her. His evasiveness, the distance, the late nights; it could have been anything - or anyone. Carla scowled, her mind replaying the &#8216;party&#8217; she had been invited to that had showcased the women Kyle worked with. One in particular &#8211; her name began with an H�Hannah or Harriet &#8211; she in particular had fawned over her soon-to-be-fianc�.&nbsp; Well &#8211; she&#8217;ll soon be put in her place. Padding across the bedroom floor, lowering herself into bed, she congratulated herself. Kyle was still gently snoring, his breath coming slow and easy. No harm done. A quick glance at his planner &#8211; the visits to fancy bridal and jewellery shops (that she didn&#8217;t recognise the names could only mean they were rather exclusive indeed), the evening meetings with his closest friends &#8211; it was obvious he had something special in mind. She carefully placed the office key back by his bedside and settled down under the covers. Carla drifted to sleep wondering happily what the coming weekend might bring�


Kyle was already gone when she woke up the next morning. Stretching lazily, she rolled out of bed and into the shower. He was probably making breakfast, the lovely man. Every other thought he had was geared towards her happiness. Rubbing her hair with a towel, she sauntered downstairs in a bathrobe and glanced into the kitchen. No sign of him. Odd�but in the living room there was a note; �Will be back this afternoon�. Carla felt a pang of annoyance. If that man thinks he can come and go without even a word to me...she stormed up to the office and, finding it locked, stormed to the bedroom. Of course he&#8217;d taken the key, and her only way of getting to his diary. Well, if he expects me to marry him, he&#8217;d better get used to an open door policy, she thought angrily. Sighing, she went back downstairs to prepare some breakfast. The morning passed slowly. Carla tried reading a novel Kyle had left in the living room, but it was some sci-fi nonsense. The TV was even worse &#8211; three chat shows, a property programme and some blathering old man droning on about the weather. As if anyone cared. At 2pm, she decided enough was enough. She grabbed her purse and left. If he wanted her in the house this afternoon, he should have given her a good reason. Her mind wandered briefly to the proposal and she felt a moment of guilt, before remembering Kyle was being a dick acting the way he was. Carla hopped off the bus as it approached the main shopping arcade and set about finding the most upmarket places she could. The man might not trust her with his office, but he always left a neat wad of cash in the jar under the kitchen sink. She&#8217;d helped herself to its contents before leaving and, two hours later, was adorned with a new pendant and earrings set. Having decided she&#8217;d earned it, Carla stalked into the first available bar and ordered a screaming orgasm. A grin from the bartender, a few more cocktails, and half an hour later she was well on the way to needing an escort home. As the bar had filled, two young men had taken a seat at the bar next to her. One of them looked like he&#8217;d be happy to take her home, or anywhere for that matter.
�So you&#8217;re new to town, huh?� he asked. He was handsome, with a shade of stubble and piercing green eyes. �I&#8217;m Ste. I can help you out if you&#8217;d like a tour, y&#8217;know.�

�Well, as it happens I would. My stupid, no good boyfriend moved us here 2 months ago and I still have no idea where anything is. He got a fancy new job, new office, and new work colleagues.� She paused to grimace. �At least they&#8217;re all very pleased with him.� 
They talked for a while longer, sharing a few more drinks and flirting outrageously. All the while, his fried sat quietly, his gaze low, eyes dark and distant.
�Well y&#8217;know, me and Joe here� he nodded to the other man, who remained silent, �we&#8217;re both very, very familiar with the locale. In fact, we know a place you&#8217;d love. I mean - from how smart you dress, and how pretty you are &#8211; there&#8217;s only one place good enough if you ask me.�
At this point Carla was too drunk to notice the faint sneer in his voice, the undertone of violence. All she saw was two gorgeous men happy to show her a good time. Well, even if it did lead to anything more than a few drinks, Kyle could shove it. They&#8217;d always had a sort of on and off relationship anyway. He&#8217;d understand. 

Stumbling out of the bar, she caught a glimpse of the bartender looking back at her &#8211; a look in his eyes that momentarily sent her cold. A word of encouragement from Ste quickly distracted her from the feeling, and then they were outside. It had started raining while she was inside the bar, and she hadn&#8217;t brought a coat. Bastard weatherman.
�Don&#8217;t worry Carla, it&#8217;s not far.� Ste mumbled into her ear as he walked her over towards a poorly lit car park. The realisation that something wasn&#8217;t right briefly pierced her hazy thoughts. When had she told them her name? There were a few blanks in the conversation. Had she really had that much to drink? Before she could say a word, she was in the back of a van with Joe, and she heard the door lock. 
�W�What&#8217;s going on Joe? I thought it wasn&#8217;t far to the next place?� She fumbled for the right words, pretending to herself that maybe, just maybe, things were still on the level. Joe rose and loomed over her as the van began moving. He swayed slightly to the left, then delivered her an enormous blow to the cheek. Carla&#8217;s head smacked into the metal of the door and her vision went briefly dark. Shit. Gazing blearily about, she saw his hand come in again, and then nothing.


Chapter 2

�Wake up.�
Carla did so, more because of the sudden stinging in her nipple than the quiet words.
�Open your eyes�
She did, but it was darkness. She felt cloth against her eyelashes. Her mouth was dry, and packed with a soft plastic ball. Her face ached where she had been hit, and her head was screaming agony. What�What had happened to her?
�I&#8217;m afraid you were dropped on the way in. Joe can be clumsy at times. Are you comfortable? You haven&#8217;t been in position for long but, I assure you, you&#8217;ll find it quite difficult to maintain soon.�
The voice sounded oddly familiar, but she couldn&#8217;t think why. It was no-one she&#8217;d heard before. His words drew her attention to the tightness across her shoulders and chest and she realised her arms were tied stiffly off to each side. Odd that she hadn&#8217;t noticed earlier. Her legs were parted, toes on the floor, body leaning forwards. She tried to move her feet together, but something strong was secured between them preventing her from closing her legs. It was at that point she realised she was naked. A rush of adrenaline, of terror chased away the lingering drowsiness. Oh, God�Oh God, what had she done�
�I see you&#8217;re becoming more acquainted with your situation. I&#8217;m sorry for the drugs, but we do like to do these things properly. It shouldn&#8217;t be more than an hour before you&#8217;re properly lucid�properly engaged with what&#8217;s going on around you.�
A hand, warm and soft, trailed down her cheekbone, and Carla thrust her chin away from it. Whatever the bastards wanted, she wasn&#8217;t going to give in easily. The hand withdrew and came back at her in a lazy slap. Once, twice, three times she was hit. The ache in her cheek amplified, she spat out a curse under her gag and tried head-butting the man away. Obviously missing entirely, she managed only to increase the strain across her shoulders.
�Feisty. Lovely.� Carla tensed as the silence lengthened. After a few minutes had passed she wondered if he had left, and let out a small breath she didn&#8217;t realised she&#8217;d been holding. A foot crashed into her cunt, the flat of its top connecting smartly along the delicate flesh. Carla rose slightly off the ground, her arms pulling at the movement.
�MMmmmphn!!� Her eyes scrunched up under the blindfold, tears seeping from their corners. A few moments passed, and the foot came again.
�MMMmmmmmpphn!!� This time she started begging, making a high keening noise over and over and shaking her head. Her blindfold dampened and drool spilled from her gag. The foot came again, this time at a different angle. The ball of his foot landed directly on her sensitive clit, and he pushed through the kick, lifting her even higher and mashing the bottom of his foot into her burning flesh.
�MMMMaaaapphhhnnngh!!� Even through the gag, her agony was evident. Shaking, she began nodding instead, trying anything to win his approval. She had no idea pain like this could exist; a white hot blaze emanating from her core, winding her, bringing unwanted tears to her eyes. She didn&#8217;t want to cry. Not yet.
�I&#8217;ll be back in a moment. I have a few minutes before we get down to business, and I want to fully enjoy them.� She heard him leave this time, and let out a shaky breath of relief. Why didn&#8217;t I just fucking wait at home? I could be engaged by now. Tears threatened, and she blinked them away.
The man returned and, with no preamble, knelt between her legs. His breath was warm, and the hands returned to play across her splayed thighs, massaging the flesh, creeping upwards. His tongue darted across her abused flesh, and began licking, devouring in earnest. The hands moved to her hips, and convulsed in time with moans she didn&#8217;t realise she was making. His teeth nipped at her clitoris, sucking in the flesh and tugging lightly, the tongue lapping out from hole to tip. He suddenly pushed under her legs and dipped his tongue lower, dancing over her anus, then thrusting against it. Her moans grew louder, hands flexing against her bonds. She felt her climax approaching, and gyrated against him as his tongue rushed back up to send her clit on its way &#8211; close, so close. 
Then nothing. She was left with only cool air between her legs, sliding deliciously over her fevered flesh. She called him a bastard, a freak, a fuckfail and every other name she could think, though none of it was comprehensible under the gag.
�You always did have a problem with manners, Carla.�
She froze. Kyle&#8217;s voice this time.
�You should be thanking the man for his attempts at pleasing you &#8211; I only just arrived in time to stop him making a huge mistake. See, Carla, you&#8217;re not going to feel pleasure tonight. In fact, you&#8217;ll be lucky to feel anything beyond tonight.� He walked closer, and crouched, face inches from hers.
�After tonight you&#8217;ll be mine, or you won&#8217;t be. Considering that if you aren&#8217;t, you&#8217;ll be dead, it&#8217;s quite an important choice to make. I know making good decisions isn&#8217;t your strong suit, but we&#8217;ll have to wait and see on this one.�
He sighed and pushed away using her body as leverage, increasing the burn in her calves. Carla was too stunned to appreciate the pain. Kyle�but�
�Ste was good enough to bring something useful to the table, however. Let me show you.�
Mind still reeling from shock, she felt Kyle grasp her left nipple, rolling it between his fingers. Something cold slid over it, and he released his grip. An odd pain, a sharp ache, emanated from first her left, then right nipple as he repeated the process.
�Clamps, sweetheart.  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There&#8217;s another one to go.�
With mounting apprehension she felt him kneel to inspect her cunt. She could feel his gaze, his hungry eyes even now. She could feel her lips were parted and swollen from the�from Ste? Before she had a chance to fully reconcile the two accents, Kyle had grasped the throbbing bud of her exposed clit. Again, cold metal slid over her flesh, and he moved away. As the clamp tightened over her the pain she felt earlier blazed up again, and she gave a protracted moan of horror. He had to take it off. Instead, he flicked a nail idly against the clamp, and her agony escalated.
�NNNmmmpphh!� She gave a desperate wail, a plea to his senses &#8211; to his feelings for her &#8211; anything�
She heard Kyle&#8217;s breath escape in one shuddering motion, and he stood�
�Finally.�
And walked away�
