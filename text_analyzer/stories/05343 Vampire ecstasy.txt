His insides twisted.

&nbsp;

As she lay sprawled out on the bed, she groaned, finally
awaking from some terrible 

dream, but only to wake up in
another setting of a nightmare.

&nbsp;

His insides twisted like a snake.

&nbsp;

Her legs had been tied down to the railings of the bed along
with her hands. As much as she might struggle, she did it in vein. 

&nbsp;

He crawled over her trembling body and began biting at her
skin fiercely until blood would seep out and run down her legs, creating a
large pool of blood on the bent of the bed.

He turned his eyes up at her face. Her face looked soft,
young, pure and very white; even with all the dirty red lighting that lit up
the room.

&nbsp;

She was crying.

He was smiling.

He ran his thick tongue across his filed bloody teeth.

He wanted more.

The ecstasy. 

Like a guilty pleasure. 

though he was not at all guilty.

With so much passion, a furnace lit up inside him and was
blazing like a white hot fume that could feed a fire for all eternity.

No other could ever replace this taste for his hunger.

&nbsp;

Others pain was the sex.

Others pain fulfilled his needs.

Others pain meant true love.

Others pain stayed forever.

����������� It meant
forever. 

He was forever.

He needed it so badly.

����������� ����������� so much
blood.

����������������������������������� to survive this world. 

&nbsp;

He only wished she could stay longer, but he knew that
before dawn he would of used her so much she would be very much dead.

&nbsp;

He played with her.

Twirling his tongue around her nipples, then have his teeth
ripe through, making it look like he was shredding paper.

�

Blood pumped down her chest and her whole torso. The hot
blood covered most of her body, and he was swimming in it. 

&nbsp;

He put tight pressure, tightly griping, holding on to her
ass as he pounded forward, digging, then burring himself completely inside her.


&nbsp;

Deep inside.

&nbsp;

He stayed.

&nbsp;

And could stay forever.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

She screamed.

He hushed her.

&nbsp;

�no one can hear you�.� He pushed
his face into hers, 

pushed his lips into hers,

�then
lapped up all her tears that ran down her face.

�no one will hear you.� 

&nbsp;

He withdrew from her about 4 inches before he thrust back
into her. She whimpered in pain, but maybe because mostly of what he said, and
that she knew she was going to die.

&nbsp;

Thrust after thrust the pain subsided, and almost a sinful
pleasure sparked through her entire body, consuming her every nerve until they
danced with frivolity.

&nbsp;

Something turned.

She felt what he felt.

She stopped her running tears.

She gazed at him.

&nbsp;

She had gotten her hands lose from the ropes; her hands were
red, bruised and swollen.

&nbsp;

He was back at her breasts, but had looked up. There was no
pain in her. She wasn�t in pain. He could feel it. She wasn�t screaming. His
pleasure was leaving. Faster and faster, till he felt
nothing, even when he was almost all the way inside her.

&nbsp;

He beat her. Hit her face. But she just slowly turned, her
long mangled white golden hair with the stain of blood covered her face, almost
breathless for a minute, then she breathed out heavy, the sound of pleasure
came deep from inside her and came out with a gentle touch to herself and she
reached down between her legs and moved slowly up to her hard tummy and just
paced her fingers along the same path over and over again.

&nbsp;

He looked at her face then at her hands and did this a
numerous amount of times before he finally grabbed her hands,
he remained silent, unable to say anything, unable to think.

She moved her knees up to embrace his waist as much as her
legs could, since they were tied down. She touched his stomach that hovered
over her bloody physical form and traced his lines of muscles that led up to
his neck. She put her fingers on his jawbone and traced to his lips. She had a
sudden desire to kiss but he threw his arms out at her slamming her back into
the bloody mattress. 

&nbsp;

Her lips were so full and beautiful. He himself had the
desire to kiss her as well.

&nbsp;

Just as he threw her back he brought her forth again, he had
to taste her lips, he forgot how beautiful they were.

&nbsp;

That was what caught his eyes.

&nbsp;

Her full lips.

&nbsp;

On the other side of the street she walked. The opposite way. 

He turned for a second look. She was perfect. The images
flooded his head. He had to have her. He might never see her again. He walked
right towards her, forgetting that there was such a thing as traffic.

She glanced, noticing a figure approaching from the side. 

She looked strait at him.

Her eyes met his. 

He stopped, just so he could stare back.

But her face started to turn worried; she looked as if she
wanted to reach for him,

But this gazing trance slowed his reflexes.

But just for one or two seconds.

He turned to meet a blue truck that could tower over two
cars put together. The truck was on him at full speed.

He leaped, doing a backwards summersault in midair, then landed on his feet.

The car zoomed by, following the smell of exhaustion with
the rolling of fall leaves.

Her hand was covering the full lips, and her eyes had filled
with a fear pumping the adrenaline through her veins like water.

&nbsp;

Seeing that he was perfectly all right, she smiled and
looked towards the cement sidewalk. She looked back at him, now up close to her
and smiling along with her.

&nbsp;

No matter how much it seemed strange, she gazed back into
his eyes, not saying one word, he gazed back.

&nbsp;

He took her hand, his eyes not leaving hers, placed a gentle
kiss on the naked skin of her hand. 

She felt as if she had known him, and loved him. It felt as
if they had been lovers for awhile. 

&nbsp;

He kept her eyes on his, fully UN aware where he was taking
her.

&nbsp;

He was leading her into a dark alley way, a black hotel.

&nbsp;

Black hotel.

&nbsp;

Dead to eyes that winked past.

Dead to ones who couldn�t see how much alive the black hotel
was inside. 

����������� Not on the
outside.

No.

The inside was infested with desire,

Lust.

Orgies.

Indulge

����������� in promiscuous sexual fantasies of most.

����������� 

����������� just another night in one�s duties for others.

&nbsp;

He moved her upstairs through black painted hallways. The
windows had been covered in black, the carpet she stepped on, black.

The lighting was dimmed to a red tone.

She was so relaxed.

His eyes were so soothing.

She was now in a room.

Suddenly, fully unaware, she crept into an unconscious
sleep. 

&nbsp;

She pulled her lips away from his and wanted to say
something but he�s lips just grabbed at her again and pulled, then slipped his
tongue into her throat making her gag just a little. She felt so soft and warm
inside.

&nbsp;

She embraced this darkness.

She never wanted to leave.

She wanted to stay.

He let her.

Stay forever.

Be forever.

����������� She became
forever.

&nbsp;

����������������������� Forever.
