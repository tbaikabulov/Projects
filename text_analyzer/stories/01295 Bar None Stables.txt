Chapter 1

	The sun settled toward the horizon, an orange ball of fire in the midst
of an ocean of smog that illuminated the landscape with a fluorescent haze. For
a few minutes the hustle and bustle of Metro City slowed as it passed from day
to night. The pace would increase when the
	One place where the activity never ceased, was the Central Library at
Metro University. The lights were on around the clock so there was no
transition. The college students brought their holograph tubes there to study
and to use the library's vast resources.
	In a study room on the 11th floor, thoughts turned away from study and
to the ever popular topic of boys.
	"I swear, these boys can be such�such�boys!"
	Molly Molloy looked across the table at Penny and tried unsuccessfully
to suppress a giggle. Of the three roommates, only Linda Lawrence studied
seriously. Blonde Molly and redheaded Penny Posy studied only enough to keep
themselves from flunking out.
	"What is so funny?"
	"Oh, come on, Linda. The guy was cute. I mean he was real cute. And you
treated him like he was�"
	She looked to Penny for assistance.
	"One of your term papers?"
	The blonde responded by sticking out her tongue. She then turned her
attention back to Linda.
	"I mean, the guy was cute and he seemed nice and I don't know why you
wouldn't go out with him."
	"We are here in college to get an education. We are not here to
socialize."
	"Some of us do both."
	Linda glared at Penny who gave her an innocent look in exchange.
	"All these guys want to do is get in your panties."
	"What is wrong with that? Sex is a great stress reliever. You could have
guys swarming all over you if you wanted. You have the body of a ponygirl."
	The body of a ponygirl could be either a compliment or an insult,
depending on the contest. Linda decided Molly meant it as a compliment.
	"How do you relax with some guy on top you sweating and grunting?"
	"I usually go: Oh!  Oh!  Ohohoh!! Oh that feels so good. Oh! Don't stop!
Don't stop!"
	Linda leaned across the table to whack her friend on top her head with a
holographic tube.
	"Earth to Penny! Earth to Penny! I think fake orgasms are prohibited in
the library."
	When the redhead looked around, she realized everyone in the room was
looking at her. Slowly she hunched down in the chair trying to hide.
	"Come on, Linda," Molly said leaning forward. "Having a little fun won't
kill you!"
	"I think she is a virgin!" Penny said in a whisper.
	Linda pretended not to hear as Molly's eyes opened wide.
	"You are a virgin! How did you make it through your freshman year of
college and still me a virgin!"
	"That's because they don't allow sex in the library."
	The two laughed a little louder than they should have. Again, people
turned to look at them. Someone was liable to call the librarian if they kept it
up. For someone who was as conscious a student as Linda Lawrence was, that would
be a fate worse than death.
	"I'm not a virgin," the brunette said through clenched teethed as she
tried to read her philosophy notes.
	Linda had turned down many offers to go out when she came to college.
She knew she was beautiful but she preferred to be admired for her brains. She
wore her long dark hair pulled back behind her head, secured in a languid
ponytail that hung down to mid-back. She wore a loose polyester top to hide her
curves. She did not want to go through the school day having guys stare at her
chest. In her nineteen and a half years she had learned to hide her physical
assets.
	"Details, we want details."
	Her two friends leaned forward.
	The coed ignored them as she pretended to read the light flickering in
her face from the holographic text told them she was scanning the words, not
reading them.
	"We are not going to leave you alone until we hear the details."
	"What details are there? I was on my back with my knees against my chest
and my feet up toward the ceiling. He was on top me grunting. End of story."
	"How many times?"
	"It only happened once and it won't�"
	"No! How many times did you come your first time. I came twice."
	Linda continued to ignore them. Her deflowering was an episode she would
just as soon put out of her mind. She was an eighteen year old coed. He was her
sociology professor. She admired his knowledge and learning. He admired her
tits. She knew she would have enjoyed it more if she had not noticed the
holographs of his wife and children on the desk next to her head.
	"Twice," she answered in a whisper, hoping in vain it would shut them
up. She heard the little sounds they made as they leaned forward. "I was about
to have a third when he came."
	She glanced up. They sat back satisfied. She hoped that telling a small
part of the truth would cause them to lose interest in her meager love life.
	The professor had propositioned her after class one day. She would get a
guaranteed "A" if she kept him satisfied.  She had an "A" average so she turned
him down. During final exams she had three tests on the same day. She called him
and earned her "A" without having to take the exam.
	"You know you could be pretty if you tried."
	Slowly Linda looked up at Molly. She knew she was pretty. Some people
said she could be beautiful if she tried. She chose not to try.
	It had been a humiliating experience her senior year in high school. The
chess club had nominated her for Homecoming Queen. She went to the principal to
get her name removed from the list of candidates, but he told her it was too
late.
	She suspected they wanted someone with half a brain to be up there with
all those bimbos. She had to pay her cousin to escort her to the dance. She wore
a gown that showed more cleavage than she wanted to but still she lost to a
blonde cheerleader who probably slept with half the guys in the class.
	She did not want anyone to think she was pretty. She was a serious
student. Serious. No matter how cute the guy was, she was going to spend
Saturday night curled up with some novel she had to read for English class.
	"The library will be closing in thirty minutes," the amorphic voice
intoned through the building."
	"Let's go. I hear the Oldies Channel is going to play some music
videos?"
	Linda crinkled up her nose as she asked, "What are those?"
	"I dunno. Let's go find out."
	She wanted to stay until the library closed but did not want to be there
alone. They had already disappeared into the elevator tubes by the time she
turned toward the exit. Halfway there she paused in mid-stride.
	He was there. Ken was his name. He was cute and she was getting bored
studying all the time.
	Her left hand moved toward her hair.
	"Would it be too obvious if I removed the band and let my hair hang
free?"
	Molly and Penny and already disappeared from sight in elevator tubes
beyond the receptionist's desk. They would never know what she did without her
telling them.
	She took two steps before pivoting suddenly. She moved quickly before
she lost her nerve. He looked up and her and smiled. The smile was warm and
friendly.
	"I changed my mind. I am free tomorrow."

	Chapter 2

	Molly and Penny insisted on helping their friend dress for her big date.
Linda emerged from her bedroom in the dorm wearing black slacks and a matching
knit top. Halfway to the two of them she slowly rotated with her arms extended.
	"Well? What do you think?"
	"I think you are perfectly dressed � for scrubbing floors."
	"Don't you have anything shorter and tighter?"
	Molly disappeared in her own room, reappearing seconds later her arms
full of dresses and skirts. She held the first up against Linda's front. She
looked to Penny for her opinion. The redhead shook her head at each one.
	"That one!"
	"I have a white blouse that will go with it."
	Linda stepped over in front of the sofa where the university had a
standard-issue mirror riveted to the wall. Slowly she slid the waist down her
front until she had the waistline at her hips. The hem of the short skirt was
much closer to her crotch than it was her knee.
	"I look like a slut in this."
	"Perfect!" her roommates shouted in unison.	
	"Now we need heels," Penny said as she disappeared into her room.
	"No!" Linda said firmly. "Flats." She bit her lower lip as she
reconsidered her statement. "Maybe a little heel."
	"Not these?"
	Penny held sandals up for her to see. Besides the straps and five inch
stiletto heels, there was little to them. The coed held both shoes by one
finger.
	"No!" the beautiful brunette said, more forcibly than before.
	Molly looked at Penny who held the shoes up in front of her face.
	"Do you have any idea how uncomfortable it is wearing heels like that?"
	"Yes. Have you ever worn these?"
	Linda's silence answered the question.
	Penny pointed toward the empty chair next to Molly.  "Sit down."
	By the time Ken came to the door to get her, they had her dressed in the
frilliest of lingerie, that short skirt, the impossibly high heels, and an
almost transparent white silk blouse. Linda felt as though she was a piece of
cheese cake on display in the cafeteria. Molly and Penny signaled her that they
thought Ken liked the way they had dressed her.
	They rode the tram across down to the Atlantis Diner, an organic food
restaurant that specialized in seven course meals created from bio-engineered
sea weed. The maitre d' led them to a table in a dark corner. At first Linda had
trouble seeing as the only light in the restaurant came from the undulating
blue-green patterns radiating from the walls' interior lighting system. The
entire setting was exceptionally romantic which was why it was so popular among
the college crowd.
	Linda smiled at Ken, and for a few seconds forgot her feet hurt.
	During the third course, Linda discovered there was more to Ken than
simply being a jock. While he was captain of the men's precision swim team, he
was also a member of the student senate and a socio-political economics major.
His eyes were blue, and much to Linda's surprise, he did not bleach his hair
blonde, the sun and chlorine did that.
	"Would you like to go for a ride?" he asked as they emerged from the
front door. The sun was now a red ball hidden by the city's towering spires.
	"A ride?"
	She knew he did not own a jetcar as he was a struggling college student.
	"Come along. I'll show you."
	He took her down toward the ocean. From the vantage of the heights, a
person could see several miles out to sea. The sun had all but disappeared over
the horizon.
	They had already turned on the outdoor lighting as they approached the
rental booth. Linda's blue eyes opened in amazement. She had never seen so many
ponygirls in one place before. Gradually it dawned on her that he meant for them
to go for a ride in a sulky drawn by a ponygirl.
	She had never done that before. She felt her heart pounding in
anticipation of the event.
	Linda stood behind Ken, watching in silence as he rented the ponygirl
and cart.
	"Do you have any preferences?"
	Ken chuckled nervously, then glanced back at Linda.
	"No. This is only the second time I've been here."
	Linda permitted herself a partial smile. He was not a regular customer.
He did not pick up girls and take them out here.
	"I'll get you a good one. One of more popular ponygirls is in the
stable. She has had a chance to cool down from her last rental so you can take
her out."
	The Convention of �69 allowed women to become ponygirls. The ostensible
reason was as a form of population control. Take nubile women out of circulation
and you have fewer babies.
	Linda knew a little about ponygirls. She had stumbled across an article
about them and felt compelled to finish it. She learned several reasons for the
popularity of pony girls. One entire school of philosophy believed that a naked
woman in harness was the extreme work of art. Lisa had heard stories of women,
beautiful women, beautiful sensuous women, who had become ponygirls merely to
raise themselves to a higher level of aesthetic beauty. The expression "the body
of a ponygirl" meant virtually no body fat, precisely toned muscles, and
perfectly sculptured breasts.
	There were many reasons a woman would become as a ponygirl. Some needed
the money and signed on for a few years of servitude. The tabloid news shows
reported that one ranking senator earned money for law school by being a
ponygirl for several years. Others used it to avoid being sent to the lunar
penal colony. It was better to spend a few years on earth as a ponygirl than
being on the moon making widgets.
	They waited for a couple of minutes while they brought the ponygirl and
cart around in front for him. Linda permitted herself a little smile when Ken
put his arm around her waist. She responded by putting her head on his shoulder.
At every opportunity she let her tits rub against him. She wished he would move
his hand up to take her right tit but was too shy to suggest it.
	The ponygirl brought forth for them had long, dark blonde hair. Linda
could see the woman was beautiful (but then again weren't all ponygirls
beautiful?) with blue eyes. A series of black leather straps encircled her head,
holding the steel bit in her mouth. Blinders kept her from seeing to either
side.
	About her waist she wore a green satin corset. The edges had black lace
ruffles. She wore a garment that hid nothing.
	"Have you ever ridden in a ponygirl sulky before?"
	"No."
	Ken raised his right hand to the ponygirl's exposed tits. He turned his
hand to rub the nipples with the back of his hand.
	"What are you doing?"
	"It's like petting a dog or horse."
	"Can I do it?"
	"Sure. You use the back of your hand like this. You reward the ponygirl
for being good without copping a feel."
	Beneath her knuckles, Linda felt the hard nipples of the ponygirl. Linda
stared into her eyes. The ponygirl had a wild look of excitement on her face.
The brunette could tell that this woman enjoyed having her nipples rubbed.
	Linda bit her lower lip. She would not mind a bit if Ken got frisky with
her. Another woman? That was a different story. She could not imagine that under
any circumstances she would enjoy being fondled as much as this ponygirl did.
	"Come on, let's ride."
	As Linda stepped back toward the seat of the sulky, she noticed the
brand on the ponygirl's left thigh � the null sign, a small circle with a
diagonal line through it, and a horizontal line over the top.
	She let him take the reins. With a flick of the reins he started the
ponygirl down the path. The brunette had never ridden in a ponygirl cart before
so she did not know what to do. She snuggled up against Ken when he flicked the
reins to get the ponygirl started. She clung tightly to his right arm as the
ponygirl pulled the sulky forward.
	After only a few steps, just enough to get the sulky moving forward, the
ponygirl broke into a trot. Linda watched the blonde ponytail protruding from
the ponygirl's fanny swing from side to side with each step.
	They followed the trail along the ridge for a couple of miles. Ken knew
a turn off where they could be alone. Using the reins he guided the ponygirl off
behind some trees so no one could see them from the path. He jumped down, then
ran around the cart to help her down. She enjoyed being in his arms. Maybe Molly
and Penny were right. There were others things to college besides studying.
	"Oh, I almost forgot," he said. Pulling the reins forward, he tied them
to a tree trunk with a simple hitch. Linda knew she could undo it easily, but
doubted the ponygirl could, not with her hands and arms secured behind her back
with leather and chain restraints.
	"We don't want her to wander off and get hurt," Ken apologized as he put
his arm around Linda.
	He led her to a secluded spot on a cliff overlooking the ocean. Though
they could see for miles up and down the shore, several thick pine trees hid
them from the trail where they had left the ponygirl and sulky.
	After several minutes observing the fading sun and inane conversation,
he pulled her head toward his and kissed her. This kiss was only the first of
many. Each one became longer the one before it. With lips parted, they explored
each other's mouths with their tongues.
	Ken's left hand began at Linda's lower back just above her bottom.
Slowly he slid it up the brunette's body until he could cup her right tit.
	Linda did not object. She was glad Molly and Penny had insisted she wear
this little lacy bra. Twisting her body slightly, she rubbed the nipple back and
forth across his fingers. She could tell that he knew what she did.
	With a slight roll to the side, Linda was on her back on the ground with
Ken diagonally across her. As they kissed, he drew his left hand down from her
breast toward the hem of the short skirt. His fingers touched her thigh. Slowly
and ever so gently, he moved them toward her crotch.
	"Damn kids! Always fornicating in public places."
	Ken rolled back off Linda. The brunette grabbed her skirt to pull the
hem down as far as it would go.
	"Why don't you go rent a motel room like we did when I was young?"
	A figure emerged from the trees beyond them. Somewhat bent over, it
needed a cane for support as it scurried forward.
	"Get a room! Do it in private! Get out of the public parks!"
	With a swing of the cane he whacked Ken in the side. He came to his feet
as another blow landed on his bottom. Grabbing Linda by the arm, he pulled her
to her feet and behind him so she would not be struck. A third blow caught him
on the knee.
	"Run!"
	As they made their way around the trees toward the road, they had a
voice yell, "Get a room next time!"
	By the time they reached the sulky, both were laughing so hard tears
streamed down their faces.
	The shadows were quite long when they started back toward the cart. He
had his right arm around her, holding her tight. There was no need to as she
clung to him as well.
	"Can I see you tomorrow for lunch?"
	Linda's eyes were on the ponygirl as a groom unhitched her from the
sulky. She trotted along behind him toward the stable behind the rental booth.
	"I have a meeting tomorrow with Bar None Enterprises. I am up for a
grant from them for graduate school. It's funny. I don't remember applying for a
grant with them. I've never heard of them"
	"Yes, you have. That's the big ponygirl conglomerate."
	Linda realized that was the brand she had seen on their ponygirl, the
null sign with the bar over it.
	"Oh, yeah."
	Before she could say anything else, he moved his face close to hers. She
closed her eyes and leaned forward until their lips touched.

Chapter 3

	Though she needed help preparing for her date, Linda knew how to dress
for the interview. She needed something conservative, but still feminine. The
beautiful brunette chose a conservative suit, something which show her calves
without making her look as though she was a slut on the make. She decided dark
blue was a nice color that would show she was serious. Beneath the matching blue
jacket she wore a long-sleeved white blouse. A clasp at the back of her neck
kept her long hair bunched together at the back of her neck so it would hang
down to the middle of her back.
	As she finished dressing, she kept one eye on the clock. She did not
want to be late. This meeting was too important to screw up because of some
stupid oversight. While she did not remember applying for the grant, she
discovered Bar None Enterprises gave substantial amounts to students wishing to
further their education. This could put her on easy street. With the right
amount of a grant, she could concentrate on her studies without worrying about
money. A slight grin appeared on her face as she realized she might even have
more time for dates.
	Giving herself time to spare, she rushed from her dorm room. At the end
of the corridor she took the elevator to the ground floor. Walking quickly to
maintain a ladylike decorum, she hurried across the crowded lobby. As she
stepped through the doorway, she expected to see a coach awaiting her but none
was there.
	Bar None had, of course, offered to send a coach to pick her up. Since
their tower was near the campus she could have walked, but the secretary who
called insisted that she arrive in style.
	"It's part of the corporate image," she confided over the telephone.
	The beautiful brunette thought about walking, thinking they had
forgotten about her. The secretary had been so insistent. One glance at the
clock on the student union told her she was two minutes early.
	As she contemplated finding a seat on the crowded benches outside the
dorm, the carriage came around the corner. With majestic splendor, the carriage
moved down the block toward the front of the building.
	While ponygirls were fairly common by this day, everyone turned to
watch. The carriage was lightweight, made of the newest aerospace plastics and
composites. Still, with the driver and passenger, it required some work to pull
it. What approached the dorm was what was called a "coach and four."
	Four naked ponygirls pranced merrily down the street, drawing the
carriage behind them. The four were as perfectly matched as could be. All were
the same height, the same shade of dark hair, and the same huge bosom.
	The mid-sections of their bodies, from the hips to the breasts, were
covered by a red-and-black satin corset. Red and black were the colors of the
Bar None Stables. The horseshoe sandals they wore were a mixture of red and
black patent leather. The harnesses were black, while the plume that arose from
the harness on top the head of each ponygirl was red.
	With each step, both ponytails swayed majestically left and right. The
hair of the brunettes was formed into ponytails and held in place by the
harnesses. Another tail protruded from the bottoms of these domesticated
animals.
	Linda looked around to see if everyone watched. She waited until the
carriage came to a stop and the driver stepped down before coming down the steps
to the street. She moved slowly to give everyone plenty of time to feel jealous.
	The driver opened the door for her as she came within a few steps. He
wore the red livery of a carriage driver. He doffed his black top hat
	The Bar None Enterprises Tower was only a few blocks away but it took
almost ten minutes to reach it because the street was blocked with other
carriages drawn by ponygirls. Linda was content to sit back enjoying the ride at
first. After several minutes she wished there was some open space so the driver
could get the pony girls to trot. She leaned to the left to see around him so
she could see the rear ponygirl on that side. Both ponytails swayed with each
step.
	The carriage ascended the slight grade to the front door of the Tower. A
pair of costumed footmen hurried forward to help her down from the carriage. The
beautiful brunette felt as though she was royalty the way everyone treated her.
	The doorman directed her to the elevator tubes to the left. In seconds
she emerged onto the penthouse officers. The secretary smiled when she
introduced herself. She knew she was expected.
	"Ms. Hawkins will see you in a few minutes. Please fill out this
personal data questionnaire while you wait."
	It took the beautiful brunette only a few minutes to complete the
questionnaire. She could not understand why they wanted the names of her
friends. Once she had it done, she returned it to the secretary.
	"Ms. Hawkins will see you now."
	As she gestured to her right, the door opened. Linda smiled down at her
and moved in that direction.
	"Sit down, Miss Lawrence. Can I get you some herbal tea?"
	They discovered her grades, her courses, and her goals in life. She
sensed she was making a good impression. She felt that they would sponsor her
education as long as she remained in school.
	The video box on the desk held all the information about Linda. The
older woman accessed each file merely touching the screen.
	"Oh, my!"
	"What is it?
	"There is only one thing."
	"What?" Linda's academic record was perfect. She saw nothing wrong
anywhere.
	"Purely standard procedure, but we ran your name through the
University's computers and came up with this.
	Ms. Hawkins touched a pressure pad on her desk. The holographic pictures
on the wall to her left disappeared. As the images faded from view, Linda
realized the whole wall was one massive video display screen. An image appeared,
fuzzy at first, then more clear as the computers corrected the image. Linda
recognized that fanny before she even saw the face. It was Linda, on her back,
as she had  described it only a day before, with her knees against her chest and
her feet pointed toward the ceiling.
	"They identified you from this security video. For some reason they
failed to bring it to the attention of the administration. I'm truly sorry, but
I think we have to notify the dean of women about this episode."
	Linda shot forward on her chair seat.
	"Does this mean I don't get the grant?"
	"Grant? My Dear, this tape will likely get you expelled."
	"You can't do that!"
	"My Dear, you don't expect me to cover this up, do you?"
	"Please, I'll do anything to keep this a secret."
	Ms. Hawkins returned to a condescending smile.
	"I'm certain we can work out some arrangement that will keep the tape
from being made public."

Chapter 4

	The pneumatic "whish" followed by the rush of fresh air told Linda
someone had opened the trunk to the jet car. She wanted to stretch out, but the
various straps they had used held her in position. She could only wait until
they removed them. They had assured her as they made her helpless that the
bondage was for her own protection. They did not want her to hurt herself.
	Not only could the beautiful brunette not move, she could not see either
as they had pulled a satin bag over her head. The opening was elastic so it
closed tightly about her neck, encasing her entire head in a double thickness of
black and red striped satin. The bag cut off all light from getting through to
her eyes.
	"Pull her legs out first. Let's get the shoes on her before she stands."
	Linda felt them freeing the straps that held her feet against her
bottom, her thighs against her chest, her knees tucked under her chin. Strong
hands then pulled her legs out before her and held them there.
	More straps encircled her ankles and lower thighs just above the knees
so she could not move her legs at all. Hands held her legs in the air while
other hands removed the straps. The beautiful coed felt one pair of hands on
each ankle, pulling her legs apart and her feet in the air.
	"Mmmmmfffffttttt!!"
	Linda's protest was feeble but there was nothing else she could do. She
wore no clothing at all so now anyone could see her pussy.
	She tried to draw her legs together, but the hands had been replaced by
leather straps. Her feet swung a few inches right and left as she struggled, but
it did no good. These men knew how to handle a naked captive. She could do
nothing to resist.
	As it was, she remained in this degrading position less than a minute.
It took only a minute for them to put the shoes on her. Once they had them
securely strapped to her feet, the removed the straps so Linda could lower her
legs. In seconds she stood at the rear of the jetcar.
	The next step was to remove the satin bag. Linda blinked several times
while her eyes became adjusted to the dim light of the jetcarport. She still
could not see clearly as the groom held the electrodegenerator before her mouth.	
	They had gagged her using electrotape. Though it had the appearance of
old-fashioned duct tape, it was superior. The adhesive on the tape rather
effectively sealed her mouth so she could say nothing during the trip. Before
blinding her with the satin hood, they had run the electrogenerator across the
tape. This caused the tape to bond to the brunette's skin. Nothing she did would
cause that tape to come loose.
	Once the rays from the electrodegenerator had loosened the bond between
the tape and her flesh, the groom grabbed the tape by a corner to pull it off.
	Linda opened her mouth to yell in pain. As she did, another groom shoved
a training bit in her mouth.
	"Head down."
	She stared at the ground at her feet. For the first time she noticed
that these were not regular high heels they had strapped to her feet. Protruding
about the balls of her feet were the outer edges of the ponygirl shoe.
	She had no time to dwell upon that as they pulled her hair free so it
hung down as far as her pubic area. To each end of the training bit there was a
leather strap. A groom brought the ends together behind Linda's head to buckle
them together. A hand against her forehead brought her head upright again.
	The training bit was a special steel bit used on new ponygirls. A
quarter-inch layer of soft rubber encircled a quarter-inch steel rod. A half
inch of foam rubber covered the rubber with leather wrapped around the entire
device.
	This training bit also served as a gag. A ponygirl with this device in
her mouth could say nothing anyone would want to listen to. The layers of rubber
enable her to breathe through her mouth. This was especially important when the
new ponygirl was a pampered princess unused to physical exertion.
	Rings protruded from each end of the steel rod. The groom attached reins
to these rings. The strap of leather attached with a simple snap so it took only
seconds.
	"Come along. Be careful how you step."
	Linda took one step in those high heeled sandals and almost fell on her
face. The stiletto heel was fully six inches long. The pony shoe and the sole
were each a quarter-inch thick. What complicated the process was the weight of
the shoe from the ponygirl shoe attached to the bottom of each shoe beneath the
ball and toes.
	"Don't step on the heel. Step on the balls of your feet."
	Linda quickly discovered that when she raised her knees in the air and
planted her foot on the ground so ponygirl shoe and heel touched at the same
time, she could maintain her balance. When she landed on the narrow heel, she
wanted to fall over.
	She had to walk only a few feet to a cart. Once main sat at the wheel.
There was room for another person to sit next to him.
	The only thing was, Linda was no longer a person.
	"Get in."
	Mounted on the back of the cart was a cage with solid steel bars. The
top lifted up and the front came forward so she had no trouble climbing inside.
	"Sit facing me."
	She knelt sideways on the floor of the cage. As she lowered her bare
bottom to the floor, she twisted about so she faced backwards with her knees
against her chin and her feet against her bottom.			
	The groom raised the front of the cage. Holding it in place with his
left hip, he lowered the top. Pins at the corners held the cage together. As
added security he added a large padlock.
	The ponygirl was ready for travel.
	Linda's position on the back of the cart permitted her to see where they
had been, but not where they were taking her. She would learn that soon enough.
	The cart ran in a circle about the jetport to exit. Following the
circular tunnels, they descended 150 feet to ground level. Two roads led from
the exit. The lefthand road led to the back of the main house where deliveries
were made. (Guests used elevator tubes that led to the entry hall in the front.)
The right-hand road led toward the stables in back.
	The driver turned right as soon as they left the tunnel.
	Within minutes, Linda found herself on her feet being led across an open
area before the main stable. The beautiful brunette looked about her, her blue
eyes wide in amazement. She had never seen so many ponygirls in one place
before. Some stood patiently tethered to rails while grooms and trainers led
others about.
	The driver tethered Linda to a post next to an assortment of benches and
desks. She turned to watch him walk away. She wanted to cry out for him to stay.
She was naked, bound and gagged. She needed someone to protect her.
	She turned her attention to the reins that ran from the bit to the post.
He had tied the end of the reins there with a simple knot. The buxom brunette
knew she would have no trouble getting that knot loose if she could reach it. It
was several inches higher than the top of her head, and her hands were cuffed
behind her.
	She could not reach it. The man had known that when he left her there.
	Linda looked around at the benches. She was certain they were the reason
she had been left there in that one particular place. She wondered what it
meant.
	She did not have long to wait as a man with a scraggy beard and pink
tinted glasses approached. He said nothing to her but removed the ear tag. They
had removed her clip-on, dangling earrings and had pierced both ears. In her
left lobe they place a silver hoop. In the right they place a tag that
identified her by name ("Linda," nothing more) and her registration number. The
tag was proof that legally she was a ponygirl.
	The man took the tag to the computer to check the numbers on it against
those posted. Once he knew she was the one he expected, he went to work on her.
	He maneuvered the brunette so she had to stretch out over the padded
bench. Grabbing her by the upper arms, he adjusted her position a little to make
her bottom the highest part of her body. Her head and upper body draped over one
side, her legs on the other. A leather strap over her upper thighs and one
around her waist insured that she could not move her fanny.
	Before proceeding, he pulled another satin hood over her head. Once
again she could see nothing. She could squirm around a little, but do nothing
else.
	She felt something stinging on her right hip. She tried to jerk her body
around but it did not good. The stinging continued in much the same place.
Bringing her cuffed arms over, she tried to reach that spot but could not.
	The stinging continued for almost half an hour. She felt him move away,
but he did not free her from this position. She continued to lie on her front
until someone came to free her.
	By the time he returned to her, the stinging on her hip had stopped.
Linda looked down when he pulled the satin hood off. In half-inch high letters
on her right hip was the tattoo:
	"Ponygirl
	Linda"
	She now wore the brand of a ponygirl. Fortunately it was a tattoo and
not a real brand. There were many tattoo shops and clinics that could remove a
tattoo, but the words "Ponygirl" established her legal status. No one would
remove that tattoo unless she proved the legal papers that showed she was no
longer a ponygirl. She would remain a ponygirl until she had completed the terms
and conditions of the contract she had signed.
	Her travail was far from over. Reattaching the reins to the bit, he led
her to another device. This one appeared to be something of a pillory. The
captive knelt with her throat against a groove cut in the wood. The man brought
the second piece around behind her neck to secure her in place.
	A board immediately in front of Linda's face blocked her from seeing
anything in front of her. In fact, about all that could be seen of her face from
the other side was her mouth.
	Before moving around to the other side, the man secured the beautiful
brunette's head in position so she could not move it at all.  When she heard him
moving around to the other side of the pillory so he faced her, Linda tried to
move her head. Straps across the back of her head kept her from moving it
backwards while more straps kept her from moving it forward. Other straps
prohibited movement to the left or right. A block under her jaw kept her from
moving it downwards.
	She felt uncomfortable pressure on the right side of her lower lip as
something pulled it away from her teeth and held it there. The same thing
occurred to the left.
	When the stinging occurred inside her lower lip, she tried to pull her
head back but could not.
	"Mmmmmfffffttttt!!"
	"Easy, Girl, easy."
	The stinging continued for almost ten minutes as he added another tattoo
to the inside of her lip. He was tattooing her registration number on her lower
lip so they could identify her easily.
	"Good, Girl, good, Girl."
	Linda felt the back of his nipples run across her left nipple until it
was hard and pointed. She found herself enjoying it. As suddenly as he started,
he stopped.
	Linda found herself wishing he would continue. There had been only a few
times when she had allowed boys to fondle her breasts. She had always determined
when and how long. She had been in complete control before, but now she was a
dumb animal, she was nothing more than a ponygirl.
	After her freed her from the kneeling pillory, he led her toward the
stable. They paused as a team of four brunette ponygirls paraded in front of
them, led by a groom holding their leashes in one hand.
	Linda watched as they walked away. She saw one brand � Ponygirl Deirdre
� on the ponygirl nearest her. None of them paid her any attention.
	She wondered if that was to be her fate, to be part of a team of
ponygirls.
	"You have her branded?"
	Linda did not hear an answer. The man merely nodded as he handed the ear
tag to the newest man. He held the tag up in front of Linda's face as he pulled
down her lower lip. He compared the registration number on the ear tag with the
one tattooed on her lower lip. A nod to the man who had tattooed her told him
she was ready to advance to the next step of her training.

Chapter 5

	Using the reins attached to the ends of her bit gag, a groom led her
inside the stable. The beautiful brunette glanced to her right where there
appeared to be an endless series of stalls on both sides of the corridor. The
floors were concrete so her footsteps echoed down the corridor with a loud
"Clop! Clop! ." She had only a second to look as the man led her into the tack
room on the left.
	The man led the lovely captive to a low platform in the middle of the
room. As Linda stepped up on it, two men approached, one before her and the
other behind.
	Linda's nudity kept her from realizing the bondage items were there.
Hanging down from the ceiling were long chains with leather cuffs at the ends.
The length of the chains was not adjustable, but that did not matter. Another
matching pair lay on the floor next to the platform. One end of each had a
leather cuff while the other end was attached to a ring on the side of the
platform.
	They freed the captive from her bondage but that freedom was short
lived. Her wrists went into the leather cuffs so she had to hold her arms over
her head. They had no need to lock the cuffs on her as there was no way she
could get free.
	The men next pulled her legs apart so they could fasten the other set of
cuffs about her ankles. When they finished, the luscious captive stood
spreadeagle without any chance of protecting her body.
	The two began by fastening the leather cuirass about her slender waist.
The man in back held it in place while the man in front fastened the four
smaller straps that kept it about her waist. When he finished, the man stepped
across the room to get a pair of short, broad straps. He buckled one end to the
cuirass at her left arm. He ran it diagonally across her chest before tossing it
over her right shoulder. While he repeated that operation with the second strap
on the other side, the man behind her pulled the strap down to secure it to the
top of the cuirass. As he fastened the other strap, the man standing before
Linda crossed the room for another pair of straps.
       	These straps were shorter and only half an inch wide. He squatted in
front of the naked captive to attached one end of the first to the bottom of the
cuirass. He passed it between the brunette's spread legs. The second man
attached it to the bottom of the cuirass in back.
	When they finished, they had the leather training device secured to the
captive's body. They did not have it on very tightly, but even as loose as it
was, it could not come off with two or more straps being undone first.
	Linda thought they intended to free her at this point as the man before
her examined the leather cuff holding her right arm in the air. He did not
remove it though. He merely examined it to insure the cuff would not be in the
way for the next step. After examining her left bond, he selected a pair of
leather arm sheaths.
	These leather sheaths were auxiliary bondage devices that ran from the
wearer's wrist to her upper arm. A gap in the leather made it possible for her
to bend her arm.
	When he finished with the first arm, the  man behind her removed the
leather cuff from about that wrist. He pulled Linda's arm behind her back so her
hands were near her fanny. A small padlock fastened between a ring at her wrist
and another on the cuirass at her waist in back secured that arm in place.
Another padlock ran between another ring on the top of the sheath and a ring
somewhat to the outside of the cuirass. When fastened, she could move her arm a
little, but it was not enough to protect her body or to free herself.
	In seconds they had both arms locked behind her back. The small padlocks
kept her helpless. She could struggle some if she wished but could not get free.
	They then began the long and arduous task of getting the proper shoes on
her. Once the chains were removed from her ankles, they led her in front of the
x-ray scanner that analyzed how her feet fit in those ponygirl shoes. The x-ray
data was digitized and fed into a computer that analyzed the fit. In a few
nanoseconds, a recommended shoe size appeared on the screen. They replaced the
shoes she wore with the new ones. Back in front of the scanner, the computer
recommended changes to the fit.
	The computer suggested changes, major alterations to the straps at
first, then gradually smaller ones. The trainers knew the fit of the shoes was
important. Linda would be no good to them if she developed foot problems as the
result of the high heels. At the end of an hour, they hand the perfect sandals
on their ponygirl, adjusted they fit perfectly.
	They then turned their attention to the cuirass. The X-ray scanner they
used was similar to the one they used on her feet only the area it scanned was
larger. The shape and contour of the brunette's spine were digitized and fed
into the computer.
	First they scanned her standing still. The computer suggested changes to
the various straps. When the computer was done, they led her past it at a walk
so the computer could scan her in motion. They made more adjustments suggested
by the computer.
	The leather cuirass was an important tool of training a new slave girl.
A woman walking around on those high heels could develop back problems if her
posture was not perfect. The cuirass insured she held her body in the proper
position. When they removed it, she would maintain that position by habit.
	The only remaining items were the ponygirl bridle and her ponytail.
Linda already wore a training bit so they only had to encase her head in the
leather straps of the bridle. One man bunched her long hair into a ponytail that
they held in position with a pair of rubber bands. Using a metal hook, he pulled
her bunched hair through a ring on the bridle harness. When he had enough hair
through, he pulled the hook out so he could grab Linda's lovely tresses and pull
her hair through.
	The leather harness fit snugly about Linda's head. One strap encircled
her head at her eyebrows. A protruding black plastic strip prohibited her from
straight ahead. She could only look down at the ground before her. Another strap
encircled her head from under her chin to the top of her head. They attached
blinders to this strap so she could not see to either side.
	Linda knew what they were doing. They were fixing her harness so she
could only see to perform. They confirmed this by attaching check chains between
the harness and the cuirass in front, and again in back. These chains prohibited
her from moving her head more than an inch in any direction. With the chains and
straps, she could only see the floor before her.
	One man attached reins to the ends on the bit on each side of her mouth
and used them to lead her about so the others could inspect her. Linda felt too
humiliated by the whole experience to care that they stared at her naked body.
She pranced where he led. After three circuits of the room he led her to another
low platform.
	"You feet go in those stirrups so you will have to spread your legs far
apart. That's good. Now move your right foot outwards a little. A little more. A
little more. That's it."
	The man guided one foot in one stirrup, then the other foot in another.
By stepping on a pressure plate in the floor, he caused the leather stirrup to
tighten so she could not withdraw her feet. She had no choice but to stand with
her legs spread.
	At the press of a button, a chain descended from an overhead pulley. He
attached the end to the base of the cuirass at her waist. With a nod, he
signaled the operator to shorten the chain. When the man stopped the chain, the
taut chain prohibited Linda from lowering her fanny.
	The trainer stepped in front of the beautiful brunette where her reins
dangled down to the platform. By pulling on them he forced her to bend over and
then looped them over a hook on the platform so the captive beauty could not
raise her head and upper part of her body.
	The man disappeared behind her where Linda could not see him. She tried
to look over her left shoulder but the check chains prohibited movement of more
than a couple of inches. She tried the right side with the same lack of success.
"Maybe�" she thought as she tried to lower her head to see between her legs.
	"Whhhaaaaawwww!!  Whhhaaaawwww!!"
	Linda bucked, twisted, and turned, but nothing she did could stop the
man from inserting the plug into her ass. The well-lubricated shaft slid in
despite the captive's frantic efforts to stop him.
	The three-inch shaft was rubber tubing over a short steel rod. When the
trainer had the shaft all the way in, he attached an oversized handle to the
exposed end. As he turned the shaft to the right, threads turned through the
ring on the outside of Linda's ass. The rubber tubing expanded into a
donut-shaped plug that pressed against her sphincter muscle from the inside.
When unscrewed all the way, the plug would not come out.
	To the protruding steel shaft he attached a long, ponytail, the color
matching Linda's own hue.
	Linda was ready for training as a ponygirl.

Chapter 6	

	"I swear! These ponygirls are getting dumber every day!  Where did they
get this one?"
	The back of each thigh ached from the periodic slaps from a switch.
Linda sobbed, large tears running down her cheeks as she tried to do as the
trainer demanded.
	Whack!
	"Toe! Heel!  Toe! Heel! Do it right so you don't turn an ankle!"			
	One man took the reins attached to Linda's bitgag. Using them, he led
her from the tack room to a smaller training area behind the stable. In this
special training area, they gave new ponygirls their first lessons on behavior.
The beginning lessons for every new ponygirl were boring but very important.
	With the stiletto heel of her shoes, Linda could quite easily turn an
ankle and permanently injure herself. She would be no use to them hurt. The
first lesson was simple � they taught her to raise each knee in the air so her
descending foot would land toe first, the ponygirl shoe before the narrow heel.
	The trainer led her to an arm of the automatic walker. The man
positioned the lovely ponygirl to allow him to pull the end of the rotating arm
over before her. A pair of clips attached it to the bit. When the arm rotated
about the central post, the beautiful ponygirl had no choice but to follow it.
The trainer walked along on the outside, half a step behind her, his eyes
trained on her feet. When she did not plant her foot properly, he flicked the
switch across the back of the offending leg. The intention was not to inflect
pain, but to teach the lovely animal the proper way to move.
	With her head held in one position by the various straps and check
chains, Linda had no idea how many times she circled that post. The pace was
slow and sometimes the trainer had to warn her to slow. The only thing they
wanted Linda to learn was how to walk in ponygirl shoes.
	And she did want to learn.
	The terms of the contract with Bar None Enterprises was quite complex.
She tried to read through the pages of fine print but with her mind numb in
shock, none of it registered. The basis of the contract was that they would pay
her 50,000 at the end of the term. The 50,000 was a loan that she borrowed at 10
per cent annual interest. She had to pay off the costs of training her as a
ponygirl, plus rental costs for the equipment she wore. On top all this there
was a 20 percent markup.
	"We have to make a profit on this," Ms. Hawkins explained to her with a
smile.
	Repayment of these expenses would not begin until Linda was thoroughly
trained. As she signed the contract, she recognized the psychology of the terms.
The sooner she was trained, the sooner she would earn the company money so she
could pay off the debt. And the way to become trained quickly, was to work
harder at it.
	Linda knew the only way to stop being a ponygirl was to work hard to be
the best ponygirl possible.
	"Good Girl!  Good Girl! Keep those knees in the air."
	After fifty minutes of training, she was allowed to rest. By pressing a
button on a remote control device, he stopped the arm from moving. She was not
permitted to sit, ponygirls never sat, but she could rest by standing still.
	Linda's eyes opened wide when she saw him approach her with a plastic
bottle. He wedged the protruding straw between the bit and her upper lip.
Squeezing the bottle, he squirted water into her mouth.
	He was well versing in taking good care of ponygirls.	
	At the end of ten minutes, he turned the walker back on. The rotating
arm moved away from Linda around the central post. The beautiful ponygirl had no
choice but to follow.
	They followed this routine for several hours. A woman replaced her
original trainer but the routine remained the same.  Around and around, toe,
heel, toe, heel. Once in a while the brunette would step down the wrong way, but
she was learning.
	Late in the evening, they gave Linda a potty break. One man held her
reins while another removed the buttplug. Once it was out, the man pulled the
luscious ponygirl forward so she had to straddle a pair of plastic panels. These
panels moved apart to reveal the pit below.
	"Go and get it over with. We don't have all day."
	As soon as Linda was done, they cleaned her off she jets of high
pressure water. The panels moved back together so she could walk forward.
	"Spread your legs apart and bend over."
	Linda knew the futility of resisting the buttplug. The man inserted a
fresh one in her ass. In seconds he had it locked in place.
	"Come along."
	Linda trotted back to the automatic walker where they had her prance
around in a circle for another six hours. A trainer no longer followed her
around. Once in a while she placed her foot down wrong, but she knew she had to
do it correctly to keep from hurting herself.
	Long after midnight, the trainer brought the automatic walker to a halt.
	"Good Girl, Good Girl," the trainer repeated as he patted her on the
bare fanny. "Here is a treat for being such a good girl." She felt him pushing
something in between the bitgag and her lower lip. With her tongue she tried to
push it back out but could not. She felt it melting in her mouth. When her
tongue probed it, she tasted the sweetness.
	He had given her a sugar cube!
	While she wondered whether she should be pleased or insulted, he freed
her from the protruding arm of the walker. Using the reins, he led her across
the yard.
	The restraining chains still allowed her only to see the illuminated
ground in front of her so she had no idea where he took her. She stared at the
ground before her. Toe, heel, toe, heel.
	After another potty break, the man led the new ponygirl into a stall in
the barn. Most of the other ponygirls were already asleep. Their contented
snoring echoed throughout the barn.
	Linda had never seen inside a stall so she did not know what they
intended to do to her. Two other trainers were present, one male and one female.
The female fastened a leather blindfold over the captive ponygirl's eyes so she
could see nothing.
	Linda felt them fasten a leather belt about her waist. Hands pushed her
forward so her weight rested on that belt. She could not see them attach chains
to rings on the sides of the belt. They attached the other ends to the sides of
the stall. Pushing her head down, they attached the back of the leather harness
to a chain dangling down from the ceiling. Another strap and pair of chains
under her lower thighs held her feet off the floor.
	She thought, "What am I supposed to zzzzzzzzzzzz . . . "
	Exhausted from the physical training she had undergone during the past
few hours, Linda fell asleep.
	"On your feet, ponygirl."
	They had lowered the beautiful ponygirl's legs while she was still
sleeping. She struggled with her bondage while she wondered what had happened to
her.
	"Come on, it's a new day, and day for new adventures as a ponygirl."
	It took a while for the previous day's events to register. While she
tried to remember why she could not move her arms, she moved forward.
	They removed the bitgag and shoved her face forward. Some type of oval
tube slid deep into her mouth. She tried to pull her head back but a restraining
chain kept her from doing that. She could do nothing but stand in darkness until
they finished with her.
	While they had the bitgag out of her mouth, they removed the remainder
of her head harness. Unseen hands shampooed and conditioned her long, dark hair.
Once they had it dry, they subjected it to one thousand strokes with a brush.
Her long hair glistened when they were done.
	"What food does this one get?"
	Linda's mind had cleared. She remembered the mess she had gotten into.
	"The mammary mix, maximum dosage."
	"Ggaahhhh!"
	Linda's protest sounded like the neighing of a pony so they ignored it.
The mixture flowed through the tube and into her mouth. Linda tried not to
swallow but discovered she had no choice.
	She realized she was to have the body of a ponygirl. The constant
exercise they subjected her to would remove any excess fat she might have. Her
body would become sleek and lean.
	Except for her chest. Silicone was out, artificial hormones were in. Her
body would react to the hormones, making her breasts as large as they wanted.
She had no choice in the matter. The contract specified they were to train her
and she knew having the body of a ponygirl was part of the training process.
	When they finished feeding her, they put the harness back on. She did
not resist as leather straps encircled her head.
	The back of a man's hand caressed one nipple, then the other. Though she
did not want to enjoy it, her nipples reacted by becoming hard and pointed.
	"Come on, Ponygirl."
	Linda had no choice but to trot after him. Her second day as a ponygirl
was beginning.

Chapter 7

	Linda's routine remained the same for her first three days as a
ponygirl. On the fourth day they considered her sufficiently trained so she did
not need constant attention as she walked around the track. That morning, the
trainer took her to a walker where she joined three other new ponygirls. Except
that she did not have the undivided attention of the trainer, nothing had
changed in her routine.
	The sixth day began as the previous two had. In midmorning, when the
luscious ponygirls were allowed to stop and rest, Linda could tell something was
going on to her left. She tried to turn in that direction, but the harness and
blinders combined to prohibit her from seeing anything. A couple hours later, at
another break, she knew something occurred again but still could not tell what
it was.
	In early afternoon, a man disconnected her from the radiating pole of
the automatic walker. Attaching reins to the ends of her bit, he led her across
the training area.
	Linda had no idea where he took her, and certainly could not see
anything but the ground before her.
	When he stopped, he tied the ends of the reins to ring on a fence. Linda
could only stand there helplessly until someone came for her.
	Her wait was not long. Another man freed the ends of the reins so he
could lead her forward through a gate into the corral. Four trainers, not busy
at the time, sat atop the fence to watch. Watching a ponygirl in motion was
aesthetically pleasing to all.
	"Okay, Ponygirl, now it's time for you to start learning how to earn
your keep."
	From the movement about her, Linda sensed there were more than three
people there. From the sounds of their footsteps, she knew one was a woman.
	A man pulled her forward by the reins and had her turn a little to the
left.
	"Back up.  Back up. A little more. A little more. There!  Stop!"
	As soon as the beautiful ponygirl stopped, she saw something descend
before her. Hands pushed her forward so her waist touched something. She felt a
leather strap press against her lower back, forcing her belly against something
cold, something hard.
	She felt them do something to the harness on top her head. When the
hands withdrew, she still felt something there. She wiggled her head back and
forth a little, feeling the weight of the thing on her head. After a few second
she realized they had attached a tall plumb to the top of her harness.
	"Now, Ponygirl, we are going to teach you how to pull a sulky. You will
not find it difficult. All you have to do is walk and the sulky will follow
you."
	They all laughed at this joke, but Linda did not find it amusing. What
concerned her was this device behind her, secured to her body.
	She felt the pressure of the object before her change. It was some sort
of metal tube. Someone had climbed into the seat of the sulky, causing the
weight to shift. She felt that change reflected in the metal tube across her
belly.
	"You just go forward," said a male voice from behind. That came from the
man seated on the sulky. "When I want you to turn to the left, I will do this."
He pulled on one of the reins that caused the harness to pull her head around to
the left. "The harder I pull, the sharper the turn. If I want you to go to the
right, I do this." Tension on the right rein pulled her head about to the right.
	"Left." He pulled on the reins, pulling her head in that direction.
"Right." He forced her head in that direction.
	"Now, Giddy up."
	Linda started forward. To her amazement, the sulky was not hard to pull.
Sure, she had to work harder at stepping forward, but pulling the sulky was not
difficult.
	What the beautiful young ponygirl did not know was that the designers
had created the sulky to make it easy for a woman wearing high heeled shoes to
pull it without hurting herself.
	The wheels were slightly forward of the seat so the rider's weight was
directly over the axle. The Ponygirl did not have to lift the rider, only pull
him forward. The actual task of pulling the sulky was made easy by the
countervailing ball bearing disks on the end of the axles.
	Linda took a tentative step forward. The weight of the sulky brought her
to a halt. Discovering she had to �ean forward a few degrees, she started the
wheeled carriage moving forward. Once in motion, the sulky became easier to
pull.
	The beautiful ponygirl's first route was straight forward. She trotted
from one end of the enclosure to the other, stopping when the driver pulled back
on the reins while yelling "whoa! ." With some difficulty, Linda managed to get
the sulky turned around. With a flick of the reins and the word "Giddy-up" she
was told to start forward again.
	Where Linda started and where she ended up being many feet apart. As she
pulled the sulky forward, she had drifted to the right. On the return trip she
drifted across the axis of her original route.
	The driver said nothing other than the usual commands to get Linda to
turn around. Drifting from one side or the other was common with new ponygirls.
Even experienced ones had trouble maintaining a straight route without being
able to see some point ahead of them to aim at. The intent now was to get Linda
used to pulling the sulky.
	After an hour of practice, they returned the dark-haired beauty to the
automatic walker where she spent the remainder of the day walking in an endless
circle.
	The next day they took Linda back to the corral for another session with
the sulky. Midway through the training the driver changed the procedure. Instead
of having Linda stop so she could turn around, he pulled the reins to have her
turn to the left or to the right. Late in the session he began applying tension
to the reins to correct the drift.
	That evening, just before halting the walker so the ponygirls could take
a break, the trainers increased the speed appreciably. The sexy animals made
three circuits around the ring at a trot before being allowed to rest.
	After another day of training with the sulky, the trainer decided to
advance Linda's training to the next level. Though she could not see them when
she arrived in the corral, a line of barrels stretched across the enclosure.
	"This is going to be more difficult, Ponygirl. Ahead of you are eight
barrels. I want you to weave back and forth between them. You don't have to see
them, just follow the directions given by the reins."
	Linda started forward. After several feet, she felt tension on the left
reins. She turned in that direction. After several steps, the tension changed
from one rein to the other. She continued forward a few steps until the tension
changed over to the left again.
	That was how Linda spent half her day in training. The remainder she
spent in the automatic walker. Each session she spent less time walking, and
more trotting. When the trainer led her from the barn to the walker, from the
walker to the corral and back, he across ran, forcing Linda to trot along next
to him, toe, heel, toe, heel.
	Since Linda was more intelligent than most ponygirls, they decided to
accelerate her training. Thus far she had learned the basic functions of a
ponygirl. To the inexperienced eye, she knew how to perform as a ponygirl. Bar
None Stables had the reputation as the greatest trainer of ponygirls. The
products of their training set the industry standards.
	Linda's training had only begun.
	When she arrived in the corral the following day, they removed the
blinders to replace them with a set of leather blindfolds. A black leather pad
covered each eye so she could see nothing.
	"Being a ponygirl is a matter of trust. You have to trust the driver
that he or she will not do anything to hurt you. From now on, they will give you
no orders verbally. The only orders they give will be through the reins."
	A flick of the reins, the barely noticeable jerk on each side of the
bit, was the signal for her to start forward. Pressure on the right rein,
pulling the end of the bit back, caused her to turn to the right. The tension
eased so she moved forward. A little tension on the left end of the bit. She
turned a little in that direction. More tension. She turned in that direction.
	When they paused to give her the chance to rest, the trainer slipped a
sugar cube in her mouth.
	"Good Girl," he said as he rubbed the back of his fingers across her
nipples.

Chapter 8
	
	Linda had gotten used to the continuous circles in the training area.
She was only one of sixteen ponygirls hitched to the wagon. She did not know
that she was only one of two new ponygirls. True, the others had little more
experience than she did, but they had advanced in their training to such a point
that the trainers had no doubt they would do exactly as directed by the reins.
	Linda trotted forward without realizing the route had changed. The
sudden blast of bright light told her they had left the basement training area
and were out on a street. Someone might see her! She tried to stop, but the
momentum of the others carried her forward.
	The next step in the beautiful ponygirls training had begun. They would
teach her to be proud of parading about naked in public.
	It had taken Linda six weeks to reach this point from the time they
first hitched her up to a training sulky. Once she knew the mechanics of pulling
the device and obeying commands from the reins, they altered her harness.
Leather pads covered her eyes. Not that she could see much before, but now she
saw only a faint yellow glow from about the edges of the blindfold.
	The ponygirl now had no distractions. She learned to obey every command
from the reins. In a matter of days, they had her weaving back and forth among
the barrels. Once she had demonstrated to them that she would following the
orders given her by the reins, they removed the blindfold. They changed her
harness and bit to a regulation ponygirl harness and bit, complete with
blinders. She could see only the ground before her where she was to put her
foot. The check chains and harness prohibited her from raising her head or
moving it to either side. The blinders prohibited her from seeing what was to
either side.
	This is only part of her training though. She spent long hours in the
automatic walker only now they had changed the routine. Each day they decreased
the amount of time walking while increasing the amount of time trotting. Within
a couple of weeks, Linda spent all her time trotting around in a circle. Her
stamina increased. What little body fat she began with had when she first came
there was burnt away by the strenuous exercise.
	That was not the only change to her body.
	"She certainly is developing quite a pair."
	The hands lifting her boobs and allowing them to drop told her what they
talked about. The change to her bosom had been gradual so she had forgotten
about the hormones in her ponygirl feed.
	This forced them to take her back into the tack room periodically to
scan her body. The large boobs changed the distribution of her body weight. (The
larger boobs made her top heavy.) Changes to the cuirass compensated for these
changes. This leather device forced her to hold her body in the proper position
so she would not hurt her back.
	Every time Linda performed well, they would reward her with a sugar
cube. If they forgot, she found herself snorting and stamping a hoof on the
ground to remind them.
	Linda's training progressed quickly. Though she was unaware of it, she
moved ahead of other ponygirls who had arrived before her.
	They placed her with three other ponygirls who were nearing the end of
their training. These three knew what to do. Their job was to teach Linda by
example.
	The trainers wrapped a leather strap about each leg just above the
ankle. Attached to each were a dozen circular bells. The straps were marked
"left" and "right" (though Linda was quite unaware of this). The bells on the
different straps were different diameters so they gave a different pitch when
they jingled.
	"Keep in time! Keep in time!"
	They used the switch freely on the luscious ponygirl's upper thighs.
Quickly she learned to move her legs in time with the others. Not only did the
four ponygirls trot around in the circle at a rapid pace, they moved their legs
in unison, up, down, up, down, around and around.
	The next step was to teach Linda to work as part of a coach-and-four. As
the new ponygirl to the team, her position was on the left in the rear row.
About all she could see were the lower back and bottom of the ponygirl before
her, a blonde ponytail protruding from the ass of the ponygirl.
	As she waited for them to finish getting the team harness to the coach,
Linda thought about her own ponytail. She had worn it for several weeks now. She
was so used to having it stuck in her that she felt strange when they pulled it
out so she could relieve herself.
	When they slid it back in, her nipples became hard and pointed. The
trainers had commented upon this. She had come to enjoy having that plug stuck
up her ass.
	As she stood there thinking about it, they became hard and pointed
again. Linda wondered if she was blushing. She had become quite proud of that
ponytail dangling down from her bare fanny. She could feel it swinging from
side-to-side as she trotted along. From the comments the trainers made, she knew
she made a beautiful sight.
	Linda's training thus far had been in the stable compound. For this
advanced training on with the coach and four, they took her on a trail outside.
They were not the only team to go out so they had to wait in line. Five minutes
after the team ahead of them left, the driver shook the reins.
	"Giddy-up."
	The four started forward, pulling the coach and the driver behind them.
By then Linda knew how to maintain the same rhythm as the other three. The bells
on their ankles jingled together.
	The route they took was a mile long, a gentle loop that brought them
back to the stable. Hooves pounded as the soft track as they sped along at a
trot. In ten minutes they were back at the stable.
	After a brief rest, they started out again on the same track. The pace
was about the same as before, though they did knock a few seconds off the time.
The driver knew they were not in a race against the clock. They were learning to
be good little ponygirls.
	The next break was longer. They then took a different track. It too was
about a mile long, but had more twists and turns to it. The four ponygirls made
the various turns while maintaining the same rhythm to their pace.
	After four days of this type of training, the lead ponygirl, the one in
the front row on the right, was removed. Linda moved to the right while another
ponygirl was added to the team in her former position.
	After the first day, Linda noticed a change to the ponygirl before her.
Her leather training cuirass was gone, replaced by a black corset.
	In days, Linda moved to the front row, first on the left, and then on
the right. Almost immediately, they removed her training cuirass. She wore a
black corset now.
	The change did not occur without testing. The trainers attached sensors
to it and to her harness. The position of her body was scanned as she trotted
along. The computer analyzed her movements and issued its judgment: Linda
trotted along as a ponygirl with the cuirass to keep her in body in the proper
position. Her training was almost complete.
	One morning Linda was taken loaded into the back of a jettruck with
three other ponygirls. Linda felt them attach one strap after another to various
parts of her body. When they finished, it was quite impossible for Linda to fall
over, bang against the sides, or slam into another ponygirl.
	The trip was uneventful and less than an hour long. When they emerged,
they were in the basement of the Bar-None Enterprises building though none of
the ponygirls knew that. All they could tell was that they were inside some
building. Most noticed the sweet smell of the country air was gone.
	For two days, Linda trotted around in the basement training area. She
wore a black and red corset, the colors of the Bar None Stables. There were
sixteen ponygirls in the team and they no longer had the belled straps, but
other than this, nothing had changed from her previous training.
	Then she was out in public where people could see her. (Because of the
blinders though, she could not see anyone.) She imagined everyone was staring at
her naked body, pointing and laughing.
	As had been her training back at the stable, Linda worked her way
forward through the team until she was in the front row where everyone could see
her body. After the first day the team was kept outside. They returned to the
basement only for sessions on the automatic walker.
	"Look, Mommy! They're beautiful!" a little girl squealed as they trotted
past one day.
	Linda had to think about it for only a few seconds because she concluded
that girl was correct. She had the body of a ponygirl, oversized boobs and long,
lean legs. She began to take pride in herself as a ponygirl belonging to the
most prestigious stable in the country.
	Once they felt Linda was accustomed to being in public as a ponygirl,
the trainers moved her to a coach and four. These were the executive coaches. If
a VP needed to go somewhere, he would summon a coach and four. Occasionally,
they would go out to pick up young women, just as Linda had.
	Though Linda had been a ponygirl was almost four months, she still had
not earned any money for the company. During that time she had run up training
and feed bills. As new ponygirls moved into the basement, it was time for her to
move out where she could earn her keep.
	One day Linda found herself in a most unusual position. Instead of being
in front of the coach, she was hitched behind it with five other ponygirls, two
columns of three ponygirls secured front to back. The team of four was hitched
to the front.
	The coach, the driver, and the ten ponygirls moved across town. There,
in that park where Linda had gone on a date, she found her new home.
	That was where she met Him. Because of the blinders and the harness, she
could not see above His waist.
	He rubbed the back of His hand across her nipples.
	"Boy! You are a real beauty."
	He slipped her a sugar cube though she had done nothing.
	Using a curry comb, He brushed the ponytail dangling down from the back
of her head.
	"I don't think I've ever seen a ponygirl as beautiful as you," He said
as He slipped her another sugar cube.
	He led her to her stall so she could rest. In the morning she would
start earning her keep.

Chapter 9

	The communications department took up the entire third floor of the Bar
None Enterprises Tower. The vice president in charge of communications, of
course, had his office on the fiftieth floor but the minions who did the actual
work had their desks and terminals on the third floor.
	The center area, immediately in front of the tubes, was the section in
charge of electronic communication. Their duty was to ensure that every computer
had at least one message each day advising the reader of the latest news
regarding Bar None ponygirls. Thus, times, locations, and rental prices were
well known to everyone.
	Toward the back of the floor another section dealt solely with marketing
new ponygirls. Generally, there was a burst of financial activity when a new
ponygirl appeared. Their job was to ensure that the greatest return could be
generated over the shortest period of time.
	About noon, the CX403 report was generated. The various workers reviewed
their lists. Any abnormalities were highlighted.
	One worker (his name was Jim Stevens) sent item 55337 to review. The
training period fell inside the normal parameters. Item 55337's training period
was so short he wanted them to check to ensure that she had been released for
rental. He certainly did not want to direct people to a new ponygirl who did not
exist (or at least was not public yet).
	The review section checked item 55337 against the various records input.
The training time was unusually short but that unit had completed her training,
gone through corporate orientation, and had been placed in public service.
Approval to market item 55337 was sent back to Stevens.
	He waited until five o'clock before making his first call. It was an
accepted fact that there was a greater likelihood of someone being home during
dinner. The A27 report gave the names and numbers. The prospective ponygirls, in
their initial screening, had completed a list of their friends and
acquaintances. This list became the A27 report. When he touched the screen
opposite the first name, the computer dialed the number for him.
	"Is this Penny Posy?"
	"Yeah."
	"Ms. Posy, my name is Jim Stevens. How are you today?"
	"Okay."
	"I'm calling from Bar None Enterprises. Do you know Linda Lawrence?"
	Linda's first day in public service had started at dawn that morning. It
took a while before she realized she was no back at the stable. Before most
people were up, she had already trotted ten miles around the automatic walker.
	When the first customers arrived, the grooms took her out for viewing.
She trotted along behind the man, listening for His voice but did not hear it.
	They put the ponygirls in a display corral. The corral had heavy wooden
fences about it as though they were there to keep the ponygirls from escaping.
They created the Western ambience. Six ponygirls were tethered a each viewing
pole in the corral. This gave prospective renters plenty of room to inspect the
ponygirls before renting them.
	At that early hour there were few renters. Linda paced about the pole as
far as the reins would allow. She wished He would come around to comfort her.
She felt nervous about this.
	After an hour on display, they returned her to the walker for another
session of trotting around in a circle. (They could not afford to let her lose
the tone her body had acquired through her physical training.) Back on display
after that, she found herself rented out for the first time before noon.
	When she returned to the stable, she found Him waiting for her. She
sensed His presence even before he spoke.
	"There you are. Good Girl. Good Girl."
	The back of his left hands brushed across her nipples. Linda thoroughly
enjoyed his touch.
	"Good Girl. Good Girl."
	He brushed out her ponytail before giving her a sugar cube.
	She practically leaped with pride as He led her back to the display
corral.
	Four more times that day somebody rented her for a scenic ride through
the park. By the third time the luscious ponygirl thought nothing of trotting
down that path, hauling one or two people in the sulky. She sensed that she was
more popular than the other ponygirls.
	That evening He brushed her hair out.
	"You know, not only are you the most beautiful ponygirl here, you are
about the most popular. You move with a grace and style the others can't match."
	He slipped her a sugar cube.
	"Neigggghhhh," Linda uttered her thanks.
	Her second full day as a ponygirl began as had her first. She exercised
and soon found herself out in the display corral. That was when things began to
change.
	"There! That's her! That's the one!"
	There always were so many squeals and comments when people saw the
ponygirls that Linda paid no attention. It was no until a handler (not Him) led
her from the corral that she recognized the voices.
	"It is her!"
	Linda froze. That was Penny's voice!
	"Well, we always said she had the body of a ponygirl."
	That was Molly's voice!
	"Can we rent her? Can we rent her?"
	"Sure. Make arrangements at the rental booth while I get her in a
sulky."
	He led Linda around to the side where they had the sulkies. They had
trained her so well that it took them only a couple minutes to fasten her in the
traces. Even so, when the groom brought the sulky around in front, Penny and
Molly were already waiting.
	Linda felt the weight of the sulky shift as the handler got off.
	"What do we do?"
	"We've never had a ponygirl before."
	Linda stood patiently as the handler gave them instructions on how to
handle her.
	In a matter of minutes, she trotted down the path with Penny holding the
reins. At the end, she brought the sulky to a halt by pulling back on the reins.
	"Whoaaaa!"
	She heard both coeds laughing as she came to a stop, the bit digging
into the corners of her mouth. There had been no need for Penny to pull back so
hard on the reins. She needed to take a few lessons from Him on the proper
treatment of a ponygirl.
	"Good, Girl. Good, Girl," Penny repeated as she stroked the brunette's
nipples with the back of her hand.
	As she did that, Molly scooted over to the driver's side of the sulky.
Linda felt the sulky move as her friend slid into position.
	Linda maintained the same pace returning to the rental booth. She wanted
to get this over with as quickly as possible.
	A groom came up to take the reins.
	"Wait a minute!  Wait a minute!" she heard Molly yelled as she moved
away from the sulky. Linda wondered if they were going to pay for another trip.
Trotting down the path with a friend holding the reins certainly was more fun
than exercising in the automatic walker.
	"Damn! I don't have quarter. Give me a quarter!"
	"Here. I got two."
	Linda heard the clicking of a handle being turned.
	"I got it."
	"Wait for me."
	"One at a time."
	She felt fingers on her lips as Molly slipped the sugar cube into her
mouth.
	"Good, Girl. Good, Girl," she repeated in a low monotone as she stroked
the brunette ponygirl's nipples with the back of her hand.
	"Excuse me!" she heard Penny yell directly in front of her. That friend
appeared on her left. Quickly she shoved another sugar cube in her mouth.
	"Good Girl. Good Girl."
	As the handler led her toward the display corral, she heard Molly say to
Penny, "I'd kill to have a body like that!"
	"Me, too."
	Linda pranced along behind the handler, proud of the fact that her
friends were jealous of her.

Chapter 10

	Three paved trails led away from the stable. Within a few days, Linda
knew every twist and turn of each of the three. She could anticipate the pull on
the reins to guide her around turns.
	During her first three days in public use, Linda broke all income
records for new ponygirls. During her first ten days, every friend, every
acquaintance came to try her out. Everyone whose name she put on the list came
to see her those first few days. They talked to others who were in classes with
her and they came to try her out. Guys who had admired her at a distance came.
Some people came back second and third times, deciding it was more fun to rent a
ponygirl you knew.
	"You know, we should make this a weekly outing."
	During those first three days, He did not have to put Linda in the
automatic walker once. She got plenty of exercise trotting down the path. (In
fact, she got more exercise than the other ponygirls who were placed in the
walker.) When a handler brought her back to the stable at the end of the day, He
brushed her hair and gave her a sugar cube.
	After two weeks, the number of people renting her dropped off. New
ponygirls were brought in, and they garnered most of the attention. Still, Linda
was one of the most beautiful ponygirls they had (and by far the most obedient),
so she was still popular. Maybe once or twice a day He put her in the automatic
walker. He always was the one to take her back to the corral so she knew He
remained there to watch her.
	It seemed to Linda that since she had come to that park, everyone passed
through. It was inevitable that Ken appear with a new girl friend.
	"Have you ever ridden in a ponygirl sulky before?" she heard him ask.
She instantly recognized his voice.
	"No."
	The girl did not seem that bright.
	Ken raised his right hand to her exposed tits. He rubbed the nipples
with the back of his hand.
	"What are you doing?" she heard the bimbo ask.
	"It's like petting a dog or horse."
	"Can I do it?"
	"Sure. You use the back of your hand like this. You reward the ponygirl
for being good without copping a feel."
	The girl was a blonde. Linda saw that when she got in her face as she
stroked her nipples. Ken's actions had already made her nipples hard and
pointed. She wished she could make them soft quickly, but she did enjoy it quite
a lot. She was sorry when the blonde quit.
	"Come on, let's ride."
	She wondered if she took the two of them where she and Ken had gone on
their date. Her knowledge of the park was limited to the paths only. She had no
idea what was only a few inches beyond the edge.
	"Whoa!"
	He pulled back on the reins to get her to stop. She quickly decided he
had pulled two hard. He needed some lessons on the proper way to handle a
ponygirl and sulky.
	She felt the sulky shift as the two got off. Maybe it was her
imagination, but it seemed that the blonde weighed as much as Ken did.
	She felt him extended the reins so he could tie them to something. Linda
knew she would not run off. Once off the path she would be completely lost. If
on her own, the best she could do was follow the path back to the rental booth.
	There was nothing for Linda to do besides stare at the path before her.
She flexed her arms, feeling the constraint of each strap and chain. She was no
uncomfortable in that position, she just could not move much.
	"Oh, yes! Yes! Yes!" the blonde's cries came from the bushes. The cries
of ecstasy were a little melodramatic.
	"I wonder if he knows she's faking it," the beautiful ponygirl thought
as the cries became louder. The final cry was a long, drawn out moan.
	Ten or fifteen minutes later the two returned silently to the sulky.
After Ken said, "Giddy up," neither said a word until they returned to the booth
where a handler took over.
	"A quickie, and then it's all over between them," Linda thought on her
way to the corral.
	Renters chose her three more times that day. She did not have to go in
the automatic walker at all.
	Late in the afternoon, the clouds blew in from the oceans. With the
forecast of heavy rain, the grooms took the ponygirls into the stable for
safety, six to a stall. For an hour, heavy rain pelted the city. The ponygirls
listened nervously to the wind blowing from the safety of the stable. The rain
did not start again that day, but the skies remained threatening. They kept the
ponygirls inside so they would not have to prance through the mud in the corral.
	Some other groom had led Linda into the stall. He came to her some
minutes after the rain stopped. He slipped her a sugar cube first thing. Using
the reins, he led her outside.
	"The path's dried off so it's okay to use. They're going to close
earlier. Rather than being in that walker, I thought you might like to take
another circuit about the park."
	Linda bobbed her head as she snorted through the bit.
	In minutes he had her secured to a sulky. She felt the sulky shift as he
sat on it.
	"Giddy up."
	She trotted out of the barn area and down the path, her hooved high
heels pounding on the path. Her movements were graceful. Every step showed off
her body.
	He held her reins, and she was a contented, happy ponygirl.

The End
