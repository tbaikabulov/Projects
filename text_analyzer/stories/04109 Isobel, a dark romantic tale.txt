----- Chapter 1
-----

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Isobel was staring at him intensely; she couldn�t help
it. He was so handsome and so different from everybody else on campus. He was
quite tall, with shoulder-length black hair and a small black piercing ring on
his left eyebrow. He was wearing black jeans, black shirt, black doc martins
and on top of everything black leather coat that reached his ankles. He was
standing under a big oak tree reading a book while everyone else around him was
going crazy, playing football on the grass, yelling and doing all sort of
things that included noise. But he was completely calm. They didn�t annoy him.
It was like he didn�t exist in the same universe with them. At some point, he
closed his book, put it in his bag and walked back inside one of the buildings.
The strangest thing happened when he was walking by other people; they would
stop what they were doing, go completely silent and when he had passed they
would start whispering. She had to find out who he was. After one year in
university she had made many acquaintances but only one friend. She didn�t fit
in. She was strange in their eyes too and she knew that maybe they would talk
behind her back also, but she wasn�t going to change herself just to be friends
to a bunch of airheads. 

&nbsp;

She was there to study photography. She had always
been quite shy and didn�t like big crowds. She preferred to observe than to
participate. She was always dressed in black, had black hair; she didn�t use
much make up though she did dye her nails black, loved piercing and tattoos.
She was happy to find someone who seemed like someone she could talk to. So she
decided to go to Kelly to find out about him. Kelly Preston was one of the most
popular girls, she was a senior and a typical blonde bombshell that was always surrounded
by dozens of guys, always partying and most important knew something about
everyone. She didn�t like her and she knew the feelings were mutual but she was
the one to help her. She saw Kelly, sitting on a bench with the usual twenty
people around her and went over there. 

&nbsp;

�Good morning Kelly� said Isobel, putting on her
nicest smile.

&nbsp;

��Oh hello, how
are you doing?� she couldn�t be pretending more, thought Isobel, but she
decided to go through with it. 

&nbsp;

�I wanted to ask you about someone since you seem to
know everyone here� she knew that this line always worked on her. She was
giving her an opportunity to start talking about someone and she wasn�t wrong,
she saw a glance in Kelly�s eyes. 

�That�s true I guess,� said Kelly smiling. �Who�s the
one you want to know about?� 

&nbsp;

�Well I don�t know his name, I haven�t seen him
before. A couple of minutes ago he was standing at that oak over there, reading
a book, he was �� she hadn�t finished her sentence when Kelly started laughing.

&nbsp;

��Well, you do
know how to pick them! That was Byron, Byron Ruthven. I can tell you three
things about him; he is bad, mad and dangerous to know. Good luck with him, you
are going to need it!� As she turned and left she could still hear her laugh,
but she couldn�t understand why. And then it hit her. 

&nbsp;

�Shit, Byron Ruthven!� finally she remembered. 

&nbsp;

She had heard rumors about a guy who was always
dressed in black, had been there for three years and was never seen in frat
parties or anywhere else except classes. They said he lived alone, in a creepy
old house, no one had ever been inside it, and he didn�t even used to talk
much.� Between classes he always used to
read some book under the same tree, the one she had seen him today. He had taken
strange courses like medieval literature, poetry, philosophy, Latin, ancient
Greek, they said he was extremely intelligent and could speak many languages.
He was a mystery even for the professors who liked him though. These were the
facts, although there was a big list of rumors about Byron but she didn�t
believe most of them. They said that he was into witchcraft, he liked to drink
blood, some were even saying that he was a vampire because his canines were
bigger than normal and he always carried a sword under his leather coat. He
liked �strange� music and old movies. The only place he was seen in public
actually was at a local cinema that sometimes showed the movies he liked. 

&nbsp;

All the �cool� guys had a problem with Byron. It
seemed like they were unable to get to him. Whatever they did, whatever they
said it didn�t work. They weren�t there for him and that always pissed them
off. They had tried everything, even throwing things at him in class and at
breaks but for some strange reason they could never hit him. The incident that
made everybody start spreading rumors about him took place when Byron was still
a freshman. Some guys from a frat house went over to that particular cinema
after they had a couple of beers more than they should have and made quite a
scene. They thought it was their turn. They had seen him go inside the cinema
and it seemed to them like the perfect opportunity. The movie was �Nosferatu�
but in the state they were they thought it would be really funny to start
yelling and throwing things. At some point Byron got up, walked over there and
turned to someone by the name John White, who seemed like the leader of the
pack, leaned on him; said something in his ear and the guy went numb. He stood
there starring at him and he didn�t say a word. He was petrified and the other
guys seeing him change colors like that got really scared too and didn�t open
their mouths even when the movie had ended. They were asking him what he had
told him but he wouldn�t say. He was under sock and he couldn�t snap out of it.
On their way out of the cinema they bumped into Byron and John went numb again.
All the other guys were starting to feel nervous about the whole situation and
headed back to the frat house to start drinking again. After a lot of beers he
found the courage to tell them what happened and most important what he said.

&nbsp;

�Come on John, what did he say you?�

&nbsp;

�If you don�t shut the fuck up I am going to drink all
of your blood and on the next full moon I�ll burn your heart on a wooden stick�
saying this John went silent again.

&nbsp;

�And you believed such bull shit? Damn, you are either
stupid or a chicken,� said one of the oldest members of the fraternity. �There
is always some clown like him who thinks he is the meanest guy around.�

&nbsp;

�That�s what I thought too but when I looked in his
eyes�Oh shit those eyes�He has these dead eyes�and he was starring at me with
those dead eyes�and I thought my eyes were burning�and my brain went numb�and I
couldn�t move, speak or even think anything. And I saw a sword inside his
leather coat too. I am not a coward but something is wrong with this guy.� 

&nbsp;

The events of that night and most important Byron�s
words dominated every discussion for the next two weeks. He was the next big
thing on and off campus. But nobody could predict what would happen in the next
days. 

&nbsp;

Byron had a bike, a big street black YAMAHA that he
used to come and go to university. Some people that wanted to find out more
things about him had tried to follow him but it was in vain. He was driving
like the wind and they would lose him in seconds. Byron liked his bike and
everybody knew that. It was always well taken care off, well-oiled even shined
everyday. One day returning to the parking lot to get his bike he found it
lying to the ground. Someone had hit it with a car and had left it there. He
didn�t say a word to anyone, lifted it up and left. The next afternoon he found
his bike painted pink. Someone had spilled a whole bucket of pink paint all
over his bike. Again he did nothing; he cleaned the seat as much as he could,
got on his bike and left. Byron didn�t show up the next day until noon when he entered university on his bike with its
original shiny black color. Obviously that pissed off certain people and
decided to do something more drastic. Byron returned on the afternoon to get
his bike and he found out that someone had keyed his bike and had written the
word �FREAK� on it. 

&nbsp;

When he saw his bike the parking lot was full of
people. They all felt sorry for him because it was a shame what they were doing
to his bike but their hearts filled with terror the minute they saw his eyes.
Byron has a pair of very light blue eyes, but that moment they had turned to
black. They knew someone was going to pay hard for that and everybody knew who
was responsible. They all suspected John and his friends from the frat house
but after that night they were nowhere to be found. It took the police five
days but they finally found them, actually a hunter found them in a near by
forest. All four of them were hanged up side down, they had two little holes on
their necks, their blood was drained and their hearts had been removed. The
coroner said that they were dead for five days. Five days after the full moon.
Members from the frat house made many anonymous calls to the police accusing
Byron but they couldn�t prove anything so the charges were dropt. One thing was
sure though. Nobody messed with Byron or his bike again. They even stopped
parking their bikes beside his and there were five empty seats on each side of
Byron�s bike.

&nbsp;

�I guess the joke was on them,� said Isobel when a
voice from behind her brought her back to reality.

&nbsp;

�Hey Isobel,
where were you lost? Who made a joke?� 

&nbsp;

�What? Oh hey Leah. Nothing important, I was just
thinking some stuff,� told her back. Leah Stewart was on her photography class
and her roommate. She liked her, she thought she was a nice person and liked
hanging around together. They weren�t best friends or anything, she was her
safety board when she was feeling depressed with her life on campus. She would
drag her out of their room and they would go to a party or to cinema. 

&nbsp;

�Yeah right, like I am going to believe that� told her
back with a smile. �You were lost for the last fifteen minutes. What was on
your mind?�

&nbsp;

�Well, did you see that guy that was standing under
that tree?�

&nbsp;

�You are not helping me much dear. Which tree? What
was he wearing?�

&nbsp;

�That big oak tree over there��

&nbsp;

�Was he cute?�

&nbsp;

�For me he was anyway. He was dressed in black, with
shoulder-length black hair and a long leather coat, he was reading a book and
just got inside that building a couple of minutes ago. His name is Byron�� she
didn�t have the time to finish her sentence when a very frightened Leah cut her
off

&nbsp;

�Shit, don�t tell me Byron Ruthven?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, you know him?� she was very anxious all of a
sudden. She thought that Mary knew more than Kelly Preston and she would tell
her.

&nbsp;

�I don�t know him, I know of him,� said Leah putting
her hand on Isobel�s shoulder. �Don�t do this to yourself, please just forget
him.�

&nbsp;

�Why? Do you know any secrets about him?� Isobel was
very intrigued now and she wouldn�t let Leah go unless she had told her
everything she knew.

&nbsp;

�Well I know he is bad news. I�ve heard he is into
occult and witchcraft. He carries a sword and has killed many people. Some say
he is a vampire!� that last remark made Isobel laugh.

&nbsp;

�A vampire? Are you
serious? This is incredible. I never thought you were so na�ve Leah.� She was
laughing frantically now but seeing Leah completely serious stopped after a
little while. �You are serious, aren�t you? You think Byron is some kind of
crazy guy who wanders around killing people with a sword and drinks their
blood?�

&nbsp;

�I don�t know Isobel but I�ll tell you what I know. He
is not a very social person. He rarely talks to anyone, nobody knows where he
lives and nobody knows anything about him. Maybe he is the reincarnation of St.
Michael I don�t know but for all I care he gives me the creeps! I beg you
Isobel, please, forget him. I know you don�t know many people here, but that is
not an excuse to hit on Byron Ruthven. Please, just do it for me, please?�
Isobel saw in Leah�s eyes that she was quite serious with her plead and she
thought it would be better to agree with her for now.

&nbsp;

�All right Leah, maybe you are right. I don�t really
know him and maybe this is a bad idea.� Suddenly Leah�s smile reappeared on her
face.

&nbsp;

�Thank you. Now come on, if you are so hungry for a
guy I have a list of people anxious to meet you� she told Isobel and they both
laughed.

�

�I�ll forget him, for now,� thought Isobel and headed
back to class. But she couldn�t concentrate. Byron was stuck in her mind and
she couldn�t forget him. The rest of the week passed uneventful with her trying
to learn more things about him from everyone she could think of. She even tried
the headmaster�s office pretending she had something to give him and she had to
send it to his house. But of course something like couldn�t be bought. There
had been many occasions of other students that wanted to know about him and he
had turned them down too. She was getting really desperate because days were
passing by and she had done no progress. When she was falling to sleep he would
dominate her dreams too. Since she saw Byron for the first time she was
dreaming about him. Her dreams became more intense each day and sometimes she
would wake up in the middle of the night. But in the morning she couldn�t
remember what the dreams were about except that he was in them. She was getting
obsessed with him.� She was following him
around campus, she was starring at him when he was reading his book under the
same tree and she had become his shadow to say the least. One day she was
carrying her camera with her and decided to take his picture. She waited until
he reached his tree to start reading his book. Then she got her camera out and
focused on him. Just before she pressed the button he raised his head and
looked at her. His face was absolute calm but his eyes had the most intense
look she had ever seen on a man. She was startled by the fact he had understood
what she was about to do but she was frightened by his look. 

�

She stood still like a deer caught by headlights. She
saw him closing his book and putting it inside his bag. She saw him walking
towards her. Still she could nothing. Her eyes were fixed on his and she was
standing like a statue. He was walking with fast but steady and decisive steps.
In a few seconds the subject of her lust was standing inches from her face. Of
course everybody on campus were watching this strange
scene and they were waiting to see what Byron�s reaction was going to be. Susan
Johnson saw what was going to happen and run to get Leah. 

&nbsp;

�Leah, come on, I think your roommate has done it this
time. Byron Ruthven is walking towards her!�

&nbsp;

�Oh shit, I told her to stay away from him. What did
she do?� she asked while running to the place where her roommate was.

&nbsp;

�She tried to photograph him.�

&nbsp;

�God damn her and�� she didn�t finish her sentence
when they reached a spot where she could see them.

&nbsp;

It was a strange scene though. She was the first one
who had ever attracted his attention in campus. If Isobel knew that maybe she
would feel really proud of herself but no one thought that she was feeling
proud at that particular moment. About two hundred people were watching Byron
walking at Isobel and then they saw them starring at each other without anyone
saying or doing anything. Nobody made a sound, which caused many professors to
come out to see what brought the sudden silence. But Isobel and Byron were not
aware of what was going on around them. They were lost in their own dimension.
Finally Isobel found the courage to break the silence. 

&nbsp;

�Ah, hi, I am Isobel�I�m in photography class�that�s
why I� you know�I mean I didn�t think you�d mind if I�I guess you do mind�I�m
sorry�� Isobel was really scared now and suddenly all the nasty rumors and
frightening stories about Byron returned to her mind again even if she didn�t
believe them. At some point she noticed that his look softened a little. The
light blue color of his eyes was coming back slowly.

�

�I don�t like to be photographed.� Said Byron with the
deepest, most erotic voice Isobel had ever heard. 

&nbsp;

�I didn�t take any pictures of you. I was about to
take your picture though but you seemed to caught me� she said with a smile
trying maybe to make him smile too. She saw the beginning of a smile forming in
his mouth and her face lit an effect that didn�t go unnoticed by Byron. 

&nbsp;

�I guess you are the one that�s been following me
around campus for the past fifteen days?�

&nbsp;

�Oh I��he had caught her off guard. She thought he
hadn�t noticed her. �Well I�m sorry about that one too�I didn�t think you
understood that��

&nbsp;

�What do you find so interesting about me Isobel?�

&nbsp;

�Omne ignotum pro magnifico���� (1)

&nbsp;

�Well does Isobel know Latin? That�s Tacitus� said
Byron suddenly intrigued by her.

&nbsp;

�Actually it�s Mina Harker from Bram Stoker�s Dracula�
she said hopping her answer wouldn�t disappoint him. Not only Byron wasn�t
disappointed but she made him laugh too. 

&nbsp;

�Well that is also true I guess! You are different
lady Isobel and that is most interesting. I am Byron something probably known
to you anyway. I guess I�ll see you around. Farewell my lady,� he said taking a
couple of steps back while bowing his head smiling. 

&nbsp;

Everybody was stunned by the effect she had on him.
They didn�t say anything for at least five more minutes and neither did Isobel.
She couldn�t believe what had happened. Then she saw Leah running towards her. 

&nbsp;

�What did you do Isobel? I thought we had an agreement
to stay away from him�

&nbsp;

�Well we are beyond this point now Leah!� she answered
with a big smile in her face.

&nbsp;

�So, what happened? What did he say to you? What�s he
like? Come on tell me!� before they knew it thirty people wondering the same
things with Leah surrounded them.

&nbsp;

�I was
following him for the past two weeks and he told me that he knew it. I tried to
take his picture and his understood that too and walked over me and he told me
that he doesn�t like to get his pictures taken and we talked a little more. He
is so great! He is so handsome, his eyes have the most beautiful light blue
color and they go right though you�and his voice�he has the deepest and most
erotic voice that I�ve ever heard�

&nbsp;

�You need to get out more! You describe that freak
like he is some kind of god. He is a freak can�t you see that?� she heard Kelly
Preston from behind her

&nbsp;

�Well maybe he is for you, but for me he is perfect!� 

&nbsp;

�Isobel, don�t tell me you are in love with this guy?
You don�t even know him,� Leah was getting very concerned again. Ever since she
met Isobel she saw her like her little sister and always tried to protect her. 

&nbsp;

�I don�t know if I am in love with him�I surely hope
so�he is so great�and he did seem to enjoy my company you know.� Isobel was
lost in a universe where only happiness existed and nothing could bring her
back from there, so Leah and everybody else decided to drop the subject and
they all returned to what they were doing. Isobel though got quite a reputation
from that day. More people would come and talk to her as the days passed by and
she was always invited to parties. She would go to some of them hopping to find
Byron there but she never did. After four days of their first encounter she
found the courage to talk to him again. She had everything planned and decided
to wait him under his tree. After ten minutes she saw him walking towards her.
She acted like she hadn�t seen him though, picked a book from her bag and
pretended she was reading. Her heart was beating really fast and she thought it
took him ages to come to her. When she saw a big shadow covering the sunlight
she raised her head and acted all surprised.

&nbsp;

�Oh hello Byron, how are you? I haven�t seen you for a
while�

&nbsp;

�Hello Isobel, good to see you again. Do you mind if I
seat by you?�

&nbsp;

�Not at all, there is a lot of space here,� she said
while her heart was beating faster and faster.

&nbsp;

�Thanks, what are you reading?�

&nbsp;

�I got it from the library, its Milton�s �Paradise
Lost�, you know it?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, I�ve read it actually. What do you think so
far?�

&nbsp;

�It�s great, although at some points it gets really
difficult�

&nbsp;

�I know what you mean but maybe it would be easier if
you didn�t tried to read it up side down!� saying that he smiled and Isobel was
stunned. She looked at her hands and she saw that the book was indeed up side
down. She had never felt so embarrassed in her life, her face was turned to a
bright red color and after a while she managed to open her mouth.

&nbsp;

�I am sorry�I feel so stupid�I�ll better be going��
she said very disappointed of her stupid plan and stood up.

&nbsp;

�You don�t have to go Isobel. I know you came here to
talk to me, so since you got to so much trouble at least sit down and see how
it goes,� he said to Isobel and she got her spirit up again. At first she was
feeling really awkward but as the time flew by she was getting more comfortable
and before she knew it two hours had passed. At some point she saw Leah coming
to them with an angry look in her face. 

&nbsp;

�Oh shit what time it is?� Asked
Isobel.

&nbsp;

�I don�t know I never carry a watch. Why?�

&nbsp;

�I obviously forgot that I was supposed to meet with
my roommate to go for shopping.�

&nbsp;

�And how did you remember it?�

&nbsp;

�I didn�t, I see her coming to us�and she is not
wearing her happy face either,� she said nodding to Byron to turn and look
which he did. When Leah realized to whom Isobel was talking to was startled and
stayed still. Byron returned to Isobel with a question in his face. 

&nbsp;

�Should I take a wild guess and assume that your
roommate is not quite fond of me?�

&nbsp;

�Well that�s only because she doesn�t know you!� 

&nbsp;

�A compliment well received my lady,� said Byron with
a smile. �I guess I�d better let you leave since you do have an appointment. It
was nice talking to you. I�ll be watching �London after Midnight� tonight at the near by cinema. If you want you can
come to watch it together and maybe go out after the movie. It�s your call.� He
got near, raised his left hand and touched her chin bringing her close to him
and gave her a light kiss in her lips. They stayed like this for a few seconds
and then Byron broke the kiss. �Farewell lady Isobel� making a little bow he
left without letting her say a single word. After he had left, Isobel run to
Leah almost knocking her down. 

&nbsp;

�Oh I�m sorry about being late Leah, I am so sorry,
but Byron and I were talking and the time flew by and��

&nbsp;

�Well since the stores are closed by now, maybe you
could tell me what were you talking about that made you forget our
appointment?�

&nbsp;

�We talked about many things but mostly about me, he
wanted to know everything about me. Isn�t it great?�

&nbsp;

�I guess so, what did you learn about him?�

&nbsp;

�Ah nothing. I tried to ask
him but every time he managed to twist the question around and he got back to
me again. But the important thing is that he invited me to go out tonight!�

&nbsp;

�Oh really,
where is he planning to take you? And what time will he come and pick you up?�

&nbsp;

�Well actually it�s not like that. He said that
tonight he would be at the local cinema and that if I wanted I should go there
and see the movie and go out later.�

&nbsp;

�That�s not very different I guess. Are you really
sure you want to do this Isobel? You don�t know him. Maybe you�re becoming
friends and all but the fact remains that for all we know he is someone with
worse reputation than Charles Manson!� 

&nbsp;

�I knew you�d said that, but it�s alright because you
don�t know him and maybe I don�t either, but he is the most interesting man I
have ever met and I want to get to know him better.� She told Leah and she
understood that there was nothing she could say to change her mind. 

&nbsp;

�Well then the only thing we can do is go home and
decide on what you are going to wear tonight!� hearing that Isobel hugged her
and headed for their room. 

&nbsp;

They got back at four o�clock and since the
movie started at nine they had a whole five hours ahead of them. First she took
a long hot bath; actually she was soaking for almost an hour and a half. She
was lying in the bathtub fantasizing about Byron and she lost track of the
time. Leah had to get in the bathroom and bring her back to reality. She got
out with her bathrobe on and they started to discuss on what to wear. First she
pulled out her box with the piercing rings. She got a small one for her left
eyebrow, three spikes for her left ear and two for the right, a black ring for
each nipple and the same for her navel. She gave the spikes to Mary to put them
on and opened her bathrobe to change the ones she was wearing and put the new
rings on her nipples and navel herself. Leah was shocked at first since she was
naked underneath, but quickly recovered and started admiring Isobel�s body. She
had only seen glimpses of her body before and she knew she had a great body but
now it was in front her, in its full glory. She had the most perfect breasts
she had ever seen, big, round and full that defied gravity, an ass that could
only be described as glorious and a beautiful pussy, which by the way was
completely shaved. She had a tribal tattoo on her waist painted in black color
that went from one side to the other and a small one that seemed like an eye
high on her back, right below the neck. Isobel saw the surprised expression on
Leah�s face and thought that maybe she should cover herself up but when she
tried to put the bathrobe back on Leah stopped her. 

&nbsp;

�No, don�t put it on. It�s ok; I was just a little
surprised because I thought you were dressed. You know, you have a gorgeous
body. I bet dozens of guys would be all over you if you were just showing a
little bit of it�

&nbsp;

�Oh yes, exactly what I want. A whole bunch of stupid
guys that all they want is to fuck me and brag to their friends about it. Who
wants that?� 

&nbsp;

�I wouldn�t mind!� said Leah and they both started
laughing. When they were done with the piercing rings she went to the closet to
search for clothes. They were talking and laughing and pulling out clothes and
Isobel would put them in front of her and parade a little bit. Leah couldn�t
help but notice how beautiful her breasts were going up and down and how
gorgeous her ass was when she walking. She was enjoying seeing Isobel naked
although she wouldn�t admit it to herself when those thoughts came to her mind.
The time was already seven thirty and Isobel was
still naked in her room.

&nbsp;

�Ok let�s get serious. In one hour and a half I must
be at the cinema and I am still naked!�

&nbsp;

�Well don�t rush on my account� said Leah with an evil
grin in her face that made Isobel laugh. �But you�re right, let�s get started.�
She picked a nice black thong and showed it to Isobel. She agreed and Leah
nodded her to come to her side to help her go inside it. Isobel came closer and
lifted her left leg to put it in the thong. Leah was so close in her pussy
right now; she got lost for a little bit. �You smell great, you know that?� she
told her while she was putting her right leg in and when she had put her foot
to the ground Leah lifted the thong all the way up, passing her hands lightly
over Isobel�s well shaved legs and fine ass. �It looks great; turn around a
little bit, will you?� she said and Isobel complied with her request. �Yes,
this is it,� she pretended to fix the thong but all she did was touching her
butt. �Your skin is so smooth� she was starting to feel horny and a thought of
kissing Isobel�s ass came to her mind, but she managed to resist. �Let�s
continue shall we? What�s next? Oh yes a bra,�

&nbsp;

�Nope, no bra tonight� said Isobel with a smile that
caught Leah off guard. 

&nbsp;

�Well, we are quite serious, aren�t we?� said Leah and
laughed. �Then we should focus on the main question, trousers or a dress? I
suggest a dress�

&nbsp;

�No, I know what I am going to wear. I was thinking
about it in the bathroom. Saying this she turned and pulled out of the closet a
pair of leather trousers and showed them to Leah.

&nbsp;

�Oh please, no. Why don�t you wear a skirt?�

&nbsp;

�Don�t be so quick to judge Leah� and she put it on.
It was very tight and showed off ideally her gorgeous ass and legs. �Well? What
do you think now?� asked Isobel.

&nbsp;

�I think I should have put my foot in my mouth! Your
ass looks great in that!� that last comment by Leah made both of them laugh and
Isobel paraded a little with small and slow steps. �Yes, you should definitely
wear that, but what are you planning to wear next? Although I don�t think it
would be a bad idea to go out like that!� 

&nbsp;

�People would look at me alright! But for next I am
thinking this one,� and Isobel grabbed a black leather top. �What do you
think?� 

&nbsp;

�Shit, I never thought you liked leather that much!
It�s great. When did you buy it? I don�t remember it being here.�

&nbsp;

�I bought it a couple of days ago, when I was planning
the whole approach on Byron. �Give me a little hand with the zipper will you?�
she put it on and turned her back to Leah to zip it up. When it was zipped she
tried to fix it a little bit pushing her breasts up but wasn�t happy with the
result. Leah got up and putting her hand on her waist led her to the
full-length mirror. She stood very close to Isobel, her crotch in full contact
with Isobel�s ass and then put her hands on Isobel�s breasts. For a few seconds
she was just grabbing her breasts not doing anything but then she started
pushing up wards giving the desired effect. Isobel was looking at her breasts
and a few times in Leah�s eyes through the mirror and started breathing a
little quicker which gave an extra effect on her breasts. Leah let her hands
fall from Isobel�s breasts to her navel, never leaving her skin though, and
then to her sides and finally to her ass giving her a little slap to the right
and then she returned to bed. She couldn�t understand what was happening. They
had been fooling around before but that was only fun, now it seemed more
serious. She was feeling very horny and wished Isobel wouldn�t have to leave,
but maybe it would be for the best. �What else are you planning to wear?� she
asked.

&nbsp;

�Well I am going to wear my boots naturally, and the
leather coat I bought last month. But I was thinking to wear something on my
neck too,� and searched for her accessories box. 

&nbsp;

�What about this?� said Leah holding a black leather
collar about an inch wide and half an inch thick.

&nbsp;

�Not a bad choice but I was thinking this one� she
told her back showing her a similar collar, only it was two inches wide but
same thickness. 

&nbsp;

�Don�t you think is a little big?�

&nbsp;

�If he is going to bite me I wouldn�t like the marks
to be visible!� and they both laughed. She put on her black leather boots, Leah
helped her with the strap on her neck and then Isobel put on her coat. It was a
coat very much alike to one Byron had. When she got ready she looked herself at
the mirror. �What do you think I should do about my hair?� she asked Leah.

&nbsp;

�I�d say let them fall back out of the coat. You look
great like that� and went behind her again to fix her hair the way she told her
and Isobel agreed with her, she did look good like that. Isobel took her coat
off since she had forty minutes still to spend and sat on a chair to dye her
nails, black of course. When she was done with her nails she put on black
lipstick and matching eyeliner. Leah had gone to the kitchen and came back with
a glass of red wine for both of them. They had some time left to spend so they
sat on the bed and started talking and drinking. 

&nbsp;

�So, what are you going to do tonight?� asked Isobel

&nbsp;

�I don�t know there is a party tonight and I was
thinking to go over there. I�m not staying in tonight so don�t worry about me!�
said Leah and they laughed. The cinema was about ten minutes by foot so at
about eight thirty she put on her coat and stood in front of the mirror for one
last time. Leah got behind her admiring her on the mirror. �I think we did a
fine job with you tonight. If Byron doesn�t fall for you tonight then he really
is a weirdo!� said Leah and gave her a little hug. Isobel grabbed Leah�s hands
and turned around still holding her hands that were now behind her back. 

&nbsp;

�Thanks for helping me tonight Leah,� she said and
gave her a little kiss on her left cheek, a bit close to her lips. Leah was
feeling horny again and thoughts kept rushing in her head but the fact that
Isobel was leaving made her snap out of it pretty fast. 

&nbsp;

�Sure thing, what are friends for?� she said almost
disappointed she hadn�t kissed her on her mouth. �Get out of here. You don�t
want to be late on your date with the mystery man,� and saying that she broke
the hug and led her to the door. �Have fun tonight but please be careful,� no
matter what had happened she was still not very comfortable with the idea of
Byron. 

&nbsp;

�I�ll be careful mom, don�t worry,� said Isobel and
left laughing.

&nbsp;

Leah closed the door with a mixture of sorrow and
relief. She was happy that Isobel had left because she was starting to feel
really nervous around her but she was also sad because she had left and she
couldn�t gaze at her beautiful body anymore. �I need a cold shower. What the
hell happened tonight? Where did that came from?� she was wandering as she was
getting out of her clothes and headed to the bathroom. She got under the shower
and turned the water to full cold. She couldn�t understand why she had acted
that way. She wasn�t a lesbian or anything. She did think it about some times
and they fooled around with Isobel before but never like that. That didn�t make
her a lesbian though, did it? She was fighting to forget about her and tried to
think something else. The cold water and the thought of all the guys that she
was going to meet at the party gave her enough help to forget the whole
incident. After about ten minutes she got out of the bathtub and toweled off.
She walked to her closet catching a glimpse of her naked body in the mirror.
She stopped and turned. She was really pretty too. She was tall, thin, with
natural blond hair that went a couple of inches above the middle of her back,
with full breasts and a very beautiful ass. Her years of bicycling training had
given her a pair of great legs that she always showed off. She used to shave
them everyday because �you never know what can happen� as she often said to Isobel
but she never tried to shave her pubic hair. She didn�t let them grow wild or
anything, she trimmed them but never shave them all the way. It wouldn�t make
much of a difference anyhow since she had blond hair and pretty much white
skin. �Ok, let�s get dressed and go out to party. I need to get out of here,�
she thought and went to her closet. She was still feeling horny though and
picked her �hunting� outfit, which consisted of sexy black thong and push-up
bra, a very tight red leather mini skirt that barely covered her ass and black
leather top that didn�t leave much to imagination. She picked her high-heeled
black boots, put on a little make up, got her jacket and got out. 

&nbsp;

----- Chapter 2
-----

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Isobel ran to the cinema, not because she didn�t want
to be late, but because she was anxious to meet him again. She arrived fifteen
minutes early. She stopped and tried to catch her breath. She looked for Byron
but he wasn�t there yet and started walking up and down. The cinema is next to
the frat houses and she could hear the loud music and all the shouting that was
going on there. A lot of people that were going there were also passing in
front of the cinema, so she had the chance to see many already drank students
come and go. Some of them seeing her started yelling, whistling and making
vulgar remarks. She was alone so all she could was ignore them and turn around.
Some of the most seriously drank got very courageous and were coming on to her.
But as it seemed alcohol was not a very good consultant so they were turned
down, not that if they were sober they would have a better luck. There was a
particular group of five guys who were very persistent and really annoying.
They had surrounded her and were trying to grab her. Isobel had passed from the
annoyed state to somehow afraid, since they were really drank and quite big to
handle them herself or for someone else to help her. 

&nbsp;

�Is everything alright Isobel?� came a very serious
voice from a few steps back. They stopped, turned and saw Byron in his usual outfit
starring at them as calm as always. He was standing in a dark corner so they
couldn�t see his face but it was obviously who he was. They didn�t say a word;
they were frozen by their fear. They knew who he was but most important they
knew all the rumors about him. He made a few steps forward and came to the
light. All five of them were starring at his eyes. They all thought they were
spitting fires. Finally one of them tried to speak.

&nbsp;

�I�we�we didn�t know she was�that you were�that
you�we�re sorry�we didn�t mean to�we are a little drank and�please man�we
weren�t going to harm her�� he was babbling and he wasn�t feeling much of his
legs; a feeling he was sure all the other had too.

&nbsp;

�If you gentlemen were planning to spoil my night I
must congratulate you because you are succeeding so far� that was a remark
nobody wanted to hear.

&nbsp;

�We are sorry�we didn�t mean to�you will never see us
again�and we won�t get near your friend too�please man�we�ll just go, ok?� the
same guy answered but he was much more frightened and was almost pleading
Byron.

&nbsp;

�Why don�t you do yourselves a favor and disappear
from my sight before I do Isobel a favor and relieve her from your presence for
good.� They immediately felt wings on their feet and turned to run but Byron�s
voice immobilized them again. 

&nbsp;

�Don�t forget your oaths gentlemen. There is a full
moon in two days� his last words were like gunshots in their hearts. They were
overcome by indescribable terror and they ran towards the frat house, literally
for their lives. �Assholes� he said and turned to Isobel. �Are you ok?� Did
they do anything to you?� he asked with a face of real concern.

&nbsp;

�No, I am fine really. They were just drunk and didn�t
know what they were doing or saying. Thanks for asking and by the way you are late!�
she said acting all serious.

&nbsp;

�I am not late. I got here before nine, didn�t I? It�s
not my fault you came sooner. At least there were people to keep you company!
Although I can not blame them entirely, you look great Isobel� and saying that
he leaned and gave her a kiss full on her mouth sending her to heaven. After a
few seconds he broke the kiss and put his hand on her waist leading her to the
entrance of the cinema. Byron went to pay for the tickets but the guy told him
that from that day and on neither Byron nor Isobel would pay for a ticket
because of what he did. Byron smiled, thanked him and walked inside with
Isobel. They sat in the last row about half a minute before the movie had
started. 

&nbsp;

Throughout the movie Isobel couldn�t concentrate. She
was looking Byron with the corner of her right eye while she kept bringing back
in her mind what had happened out of the cinema. She was feeling safe beside
him; he had protected her against five very big and totally drank guys just by
being there. He stood three or four meters away from them and they were shaking
in their shoes. They couldn�t even make a coherent sentence for god�s sake! But
what made them so afraid? When Byron appeared she thought that they were going
to fight. But they ran away! It couldn�t be just because of the rumors,
couldn�t it? And what was �there is a full moon in two days� was all about? Was
it true then? Had he murdered John White and his friends? She started to feel
nervous all of a sudden. But then again he was always so good and kind with
her. She looked at him. �This is not a face of a murderer, is it?� she thought.
�This is nonsense; he is just using what happened to get out of messy
situations like that one. And as it appears, it works pretty well too!� she
eased her mind and brought her attention back to the movie. After about half an
hour the movie ended and they got up to leave. She was anxious about the rest
of the night. When they got out of the cinema they saw that a very big crowd
had gathered as if they waited for something. Byron didn�t seem to mind so he
kept on walking. Then he heard a voice from the crowd.

&nbsp;

�Hey freak!� but he received no answer from Byron and
he shouted again.

&nbsp;

�Hey FREAK! I am talking to you. Are you deaf or
stupid?� That particular last word made Byron stop and turn around without
taking his hand from Isobel�s waist.

&nbsp;

�We have had enough with your attitude� saying that
ten people came forward holding knives and iron bars. Isobel grabbed his hand
to find safety.� She was really afraid
for Byron�s life and her own since among the crowd she saw the five guys that
had attacked her. 

&nbsp;

�I�m scared Byron. There are too many and they have
knives and iron bars. I don�t think they are going to leave this time.�

&nbsp;

�They are certainly not going to leave in one peace if
they touch you! Fear not fair lady� when he said this he smiled and their eyes
met and she wasn�t afraid any more. It was so strange. There were ten people
about to attack him and beat him to death and he was totally calm. 

&nbsp;

�You pretend to be the meanest man around and scare
everybody. It�s pay back time. For you and your little slut!� the last one was
intended to get his attention and he succeeded. Byron turned his head with a
sudden move and stared at him with the most intense look. His eyes were
changing colors again to black, a sign of great anger, and he made a step
forward taking his hand from Isobel�s waist. 

&nbsp;

�I must request to ask yourselves. Why are you doing
this? Have I done anything to offend you? Have I ever done anything to offend
anybody?� he let his words rest in the minds of his soon to be attackers and to
the crowd�s that was getting bigger as the time passed. 

&nbsp;

�Let me assure you gentlemen that if you begin this
there is no turning back. Do you value your life so low as to risk it over the
words of five drank men?� and he turned to the crowd where those five were
standing. �Or should I say five drank cowards? It seems that you don�t even
have the courage to stand in front of them? I warned you!� and he starred at
them so intensely that they walked backwards and felt terror sink into their
hearts and mind again. 

&nbsp;

�No freak. I warned you!� said the leader of the ten
and a huge blond guy moved forward holding a big knife. Everybody from the
crowd made a few steps back. They didn�t believe them when they said they were
going to attack Byron, even when Paul Thomas, their leader, began shouting at
Byron. Nobody knew how it was going to end and they just held their breaths.

&nbsp;

�Be that as it may� said Byron and nodded to Isobel to
move back. 

&nbsp;

The blond
guy ran towards Byron holding firmly the knife and when he was close enough he
tried to cut him in the face but Byron quickly fell to one knee and punched him
in the stomach. He didn�t expect that and moved back holding his stomach trying
to get his breath back. He stood up and attacked him again aiming for his chest
this time only now Byron moving even quicker dropped to the ground and swept
his left knee with his right foot, bringing him down. For the second time the
blond guy stood up and tried to concentrate. He tried to look as mean as he
could to scare Byron but he didn�t achieve much. 

&nbsp;

�You fucking asshole, I am going to cut you open!� and
he attacked aiming for the stomach. Byron jumped and with a round kick hit him
in the jaw. A horrible �CRACK� was heard from his neck and he fell down for the
third and last time. Four more guys with knives had the same fate as the first
one and after a few minutes they were lying on the ground without anyone
knowing how badly they were heart. Furthermore, Byron had taken the knife from
the last one, so now he was armed. Isobel couldn�t believe how easily he had
knocked them down and neither could anybody else from the crowd. The last five
of the attackers were angrier now or at least that was what they wanted to look
like and they were wielding their iron bars shouting and cursing Byron and
Isobel. But he remained still. They had done nothing to him; even his hair had
remained the same. 

&nbsp;

The new plan was to attack Byron two at the same time.
The two guys went on each side of Byron and waited for his move, but he did
none. He was waiting for them. �Get him,� shouted Paul and they both attacked
him aiming for his head. Suddenly Byron turned to his left and nailed the knife
to the ground, through the guy�s foot making him scream from the pain and
escaped them by rolling on the ground to his right. The guy that was still
standing turned to attack Byron but he received a kick in the face that brought
him to the ground unconscious. Byron then turned to the guy that was still
shouting from the pain and with an elbow hit threw him to the ground senseless
too. He turned to the remaining three. 

&nbsp;

�I don�t think stupidity is a crime you should pay
with your life so I�ll let all of you live this time. I take it that you are
the leaders. Take care of your friends. There is no shame in leaving a battle
you cannot win. And this gentlemen�is a battle you CANNOT win!� said Byron
sounding as decisive as ever. He saw fear in their eyes and knew that the
battle had ended. Then he turned to the five guys that had started the whole
thing. �You took an oath that you wouldn�t appear yourselves in this place
again and more important that you wouldn�t do anything to harm Isobel. You
broke your oath. But I always keep mine!� They turned and start running. The
crowd was speechless. Byron turned his back and went over to Isobel. She was
starring at him with a look of total amazement. He raised his hand and nodded
for her to come closer to him and so she did. He put his left hand behind her
neck and brought her head close to his. He gave her a passionate kiss that
lasted for a few seconds. When he broke the kiss she had her eyes still closed.
�Come, fair Isobel. Let us leave this dreadful scene at once� and she complied
without a second thought. As they were leaving they heard a lot of whispering
from the crowd and moaning from the seven people that were lying on the ground.

&nbsp;

�Fools! They never learn!� he said as they were
walking away. 

&nbsp;

�Byron you were amazing! You fought against seven
armed people and won without a scratch! I have never seen anything like that
before.� She had her right hand around his waist and was holding him firmly.
His presence made her feel totally safe. 

&nbsp;

�I didn�t want this to happen Isobel. I don�t like it
when I lose my temper. Bad things happen when I lose my temper� he replied
looking at the sky. 

&nbsp;

�It wasn�t your fault Byron. Don�t blame your self.
You saved me twice today my prince. I can�t thank thee enough!� she said
smiling and stopped walking causing Byron to stop walking too. 

&nbsp;

�I only did my duty lady Isobel,� he answered with a
smile. 

&nbsp;

�Kiss me prince Charming� and so he did. He kissed her
full on the mouth. He kissed her like she hadn�t kissed her before. Like she
had never been kissed before. She was lost again. It was incredible how good he
could make her feel by simply kissing her. He broke the kiss after a minute and
started walking again. �Where shall you take me my prince?� she asked him.

&nbsp;

�First let�s get to the bike and then you�ll see� he said
smiling and she nodded for agreement. After half a minute of a leisurely
walking they reached his bike. They got on and left with great speed. At first
they were wandering around through various neighborhoods talking and laughing.
�Would you like to go for a drink?� he asked and she said yes. After a few
minutes they were somewhere she had never been. The whole area was completely
unknown to her but looked great. 

&nbsp;

�This is great. Do you live here?� she asked him.

&nbsp;

�Not very far from here� he said. �Let�s go there for
a drink� pointing at a building with a big wooden door. They parked the bike
outside and got off. 

&nbsp;

�Aren�t you afraid someone will steal the bike?� she
asked him concerned seeing him opening the door while leaving the bike
unlocked. He didn�t answer her, the guy behind the door did. He was a really
big Goth type.� When he saw Byron he
smiled and addressed him.

&nbsp;

�Good evening Byron. Don�t worry about the bike. I�ll
keep an eye on it.�

&nbsp;

�Thank you my friend. Let me introduce you. Isobel
meet Frank.� Frank took her hand and kissed it with a big smile in his face. It
was like he was actually glad Byron had introduced them. �I met Isobel at the
university, can you believe that?� said Byron acting all surprised and so did
Frank. �Frank works here for the past two years. He is a friend� saying that he
put his hand on Frank�s shoulder and smiled and so did Frank. After the
introductions they walked inside and went up about twenty stairs where Byron
opened another wooden door and they entered the bar. 

&nbsp;

The first thing that Isobel noticed was of course that
it was heavily under lit. There was a small corridor and they turned right. It
was a small bar, eight tables with three chairs in the middle and six big
tables with couches at the walls. The bar was at their left and so was the DJ.
The walls were decorated with paintings, pictures and three large mirrors with
big wooden frames. There was a candle on every table and four on each side of
the wall. The only place that had more light was the bar. It was certainly a
Goth bar and all the people in it sure did fit that description. All the
customers were typical Goths, with the black clothes, the piercing and the make
up. The waitresses were dressed in a more fetish manner with a lot more
leather. She loved the place immediately. The music was loud but not so loud so
you couldn�t discuss. They decided to stand by the bar. The bartender seeing
Byron almost ran to his side to greet him and then turned to Isobel to greet
her too with a smile once he learned her name. Before she had even thought what
she was having the bartender brought them two pints of beer. �On the house� he
said smiling and then left to attend the other customers. 

&nbsp;

�This place is great and the people here seem great
too. They are so nice. Do you come here often?� 

&nbsp;

�Well, I come here every night before I do anything
else or just for a drink. I love this place.� The moment he had finished his
sentence Isobel noticed the most beautiful woman she had ever seen coming
behind him. She had black hair, caught in a ponytail high in the back of her
head. She was wearing leather boots; a short tight leather skirt and leather
push up bra under a fish net blouse. On top of everything she had a leather
coat identical to Byron�s. She was wearing a black leather collar with silver
spikes on it; she had a small piercing ring in each eyebrow, many more on the
ears and a small diamond in her navel. She put her hands in Byron�s waist, got
close to him and gave him a kiss on his neck. She noticed she had the same teeth
with Byron. �Hello Clio� he said without even turning. 

&nbsp;

�How can you do this every time, is still beyond me!�
she said and came in front of him smiling. �I heard you got into some trouble
tonight, is this true?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, I am afraid so. But I fought to protect the fair
lady Isobel!� he said laughing and pointed at Isobel.

&nbsp;

�Oh I am sure you did Byron� and turned to Isobel.
�Hello Isobel, I am Clio� she said and shook Isobel�s hand. �Happy to meet you�


&nbsp;

�Me too. Do you work here?� she asked her.

&nbsp;

�No, I am here for a drink and then off to somewhere
else. But who knows where?� she said smiling. �But probably at ODD. You know
it?� asked Isobel.

&nbsp;

�No I don�t, I�ve never been in this area before.�

&nbsp;

�A new comer then? No matter, Byron knows it. Well
I�ll let you talk, I am sure you have a lot to talk about.� She gave Byron a
light kiss on his cheek and turned to Isobel. She put her hand on her waist
bringing her close and gave her a small passionate kiss on the lips. Before she
understood it Clio broke the kiss leaving her in a wonder whether she liked
what had happened or not. �It was nice meeting you Isobel� she was still very
close to her face and was looking right in her eyes with a look full of lust.
She brought her right hand very slowly to her left buttock and rested there for
a while. �I hope I�ll see you later� she said with a low, slow and very erotic
voice and kissed her again. �Farewell� she said and left. Isobel was lost for a
little while.

&nbsp;

�I hope she didn�t offend you, did she?� said Byron
bringing her back to reality.

&nbsp;

�What? No, I�m fine.� She shook her head a little and
continued. �It was unexpected that�s all. Is she always like this?�

&nbsp;

�Well, that�s Clio. She gets what she wants most of
the times.�

&nbsp;

�What�s that place she is going? Is it a club?�

&nbsp;

�Yes it is but I don�t know if I want to go there
tonight.�

&nbsp;

�Really? Why? Is it too far from here? Don�t you like
it?� she sounded kind of disappointed by Byron�s answer.

&nbsp;

�It seems to me that you liked Clio a little too
much!�� He said smiling and Isobel
blushed a little.

&nbsp;

�I am just curious that�s all. I�ve never been in
these parts before and I want to know every place. But don�t you worry prince
Charming. Nothing will take me away from thee tonight� as she said that she
fell to his arms and kissed him. As they were kissing Byron unbuttoned her coat
and rested his hands on her thighs feeling her body a little. After a while he
put his hands on her waist, lifted her without breaking the kiss and made her
sit on a stool. He got between her legs and Isobel put her legs behind Byron�s
knees thus blocking him there. She felt his hands descend from her waist and
she lifted her body a little helping him put them on her ass. They explored
each other mouths with their tongues for a couple more minutes while his hands
remained on her ass and hers locked behind Byron�s neck. She broke the kiss
gasping for air. She had never been so horny in her life and was breathing very
fast giving her breasts a very nice effect. He was still between her legs when
she saw a beautiful girl wearing a short and very tight leather dress coming
close to them. She didn�t do anything though; she remained there as if she was
waiting for something. Isobel nodded to Byron and he turned. 

&nbsp;

�Oh, good evening Sharon. I�m sorry I
quite forgot. I�ll have a glass of red wine� he turned to Isobel and she nodded
implying that she was having the same. Sharon smiled at them
and left. In less than thirty seconds she returned with their order. She smiled
again and left. Isobel took a small sip from the wine, put her glass on the bar
and looked around. Everybody seemed to have a very good time. The music was
great, there were people drinking and talking and some were dancing. As the
night moved on and the bar was getting even crowded more people would come and
talk to Byron. It seemed that the news about Byron�s fight had traveled fast
and everybody knew about it. Byron introduced Isobel to everybody. The men
would smile take her hand and kiss it in a very courtly manner but the women
would get close to her and kiss her on her cheek or the neck and on two
occasions on her lips. 

&nbsp;

She was feeling strange about the whole situation but
she couldn�t say that she didn�t enjoy it. The strange thing was that everybody
was treating her so nice, they would smile immediately at her and she felt like
they were welcoming her. It was so different from her life in the day at the
university. At one o�clock fifteen people
surrounded them and they were all discussing about her. She was in a great mood
and looking at Byron she saw that so was he. Her glass was never empty. When
she would take the last sip from her glass of wine Sharon would be in
front of her with a new glass. The night flew by and before she knew it, it was
four o�clock and she was rather drank. Byron
understood that and asked her to tell him where she lived to take her back. She
turned him down and tried to make a strong argument but she didn�t succeed
much. She was talking but not much sense came out of her words. 

&nbsp;

�Come Isobel, it�s time to go� he said and put his
hand to the waist. Isobel tried to protest.

&nbsp;

�No, I�m fine. Come on, please. I�m having a great
time. Why can�t we stay a little more?� she was trying to persuade him by
throwing her hands around his neck and kissing him. Byron broke the kiss much
to Isobel�s disappointment.� 

&nbsp;

�If you drink a little more you�ll be crawling.�

&nbsp;

�If it is going to be at your feet, let it be so.� She
said and everybody laughed, including Byron. 

&nbsp;

�Yes but you wouldn�t be aware of what was happening,
would you? There is no fun in that!� he said with an evil smile that made some
of the women chuckle. 

&nbsp;

�Oh well, it seems I cannot win this one. You�re no
fun.� Said Isobel making a sad puppy face. 

&nbsp;

�It�s not my fault you got drank tonight, is it? Come
on, say goodbye and let�s go.� She waved goodbye to all of them and leaning on
Byron they headed for the exit. They stepped down, greeted Frank and got out of
the bar. They got on the bike and left. The fresh air cleared her mind a little
so she was able to direct Byron properly. When they arrived at the building
where her apartment was she got off the bike. 

&nbsp;

�I am sorry for messing this night twice Byron.�

&nbsp;

�You didn�t mess my night Isobel. And why did you say
twice?� she asked her puzzled.

&nbsp;

�Well, I was the reason you got in a fight tonight
remember? Plus I ruined the night by getting drunk. It was so stupid of me��
she didn�t finish her sentence when Byron put his right index finger on her
lips.

&nbsp;

�It wasn�t your fault those assholes attacked you.
Don�t blame yourself for that one. As for getting drunk you do have an excuse.
You always had a full glass.�

&nbsp;

�Really, how did that happen? I wasn�t ordering and
neither did you.�

&nbsp;

�No, but as you can remember we weren�t alone.
Everybody was buying you a drink.�

&nbsp;

�Why?� she was surprised by his response. 

&nbsp;

�Because they liked you. And who can blame them?� he
said smiling.

&nbsp;

�I liked them too. They were all so nice. And the
place was nice too. It was a nice change from what I go through every day.
Thank you for a wonderful night.� She said and kissed him. 

&nbsp;

�Thou art most welcome my lady� he said and leaned to
kiss her back when he heard a moaning and turned his head to see what was going
on. He saw someone laying a couple of feet from the entrance of the building.
He could tell that it was a woman, blonde and she was naked. �Isn�t that Leah,
your roommate?� he asked Isobel making her turn her head.

&nbsp;

�Where is she?� the moment she saw her, the smile was
whipped from her face and all the alcohol that was circulating in her veins
vanished in a second. They run towards her and Isobel fell to her knees
grabbing Leah�s head. �Oh my god, it is her!� she was socked by the sight of
her roommate. Her lips and nose were bleeding, bruised eyes, two earrings were
ripped from her ears, she had bruises and cuts on her body and the only think
she had on were her boots. She was holding a piece of her leather skirt in her
left hand and her head was a few inches from a small lake of vomit. They could
tell she was still alive by the shaking of her body since it was a cold night
and she was lying naked on the grass. �Oh my god, what happened to you? Talk to
me, please.� She was almost weeping by now and had forgotten about Byron when
he heard him cursing and turned towards him.

&nbsp;

�Bastards. Cowards. I shouldn�t have let them live.�
His eyes had lost the light blue colors and had turned black again. �They raped
her!� he told Isobel and pointed at her pussy. Isobel turned her gaze and the
sight of that certain part of her anatomy made her cry. It was bruised and
there were cuts around it. 

&nbsp;

�We need to take her to a hospital. Call the police.
We must do something!� she was talking almost pleading Byron but was looking at
Leah still stroking her hair and face trying to bring her back to her senses.
Before Byron had the time to speak they heard Leah trying to talk.

&nbsp;

�No�no�police�please�just�take�take me�take me
upstairs�� she was shaking uncontrollably now from the cold and the pain. Byron
took her in his arms while Isobel took off her coat and dropped it on her to
protect her from the cold. They got inside the elevator and they reached the
sixth floor where their apartment was. They walked to their door and saw that
it was open. They got inside and saw the room in a mess. They were obviously
searching for Isobel but seeing that she wasn�t there they had trashed the
place. They had opened the closets and destroyed most of the clothes; they had
broken a couple of lamps and the full-length mirror. Byron put Leah on her bed,
took her boots off and pulled a blanket over her. Isobel sat on the headboard
and was talking to her in a low voice trying to sooth her and kept stroking her
hair. Byron in his turn was trying to calm down Isobel while looking around.
They had written a lot of things on the walls and Byron began to read them.
Most of them were words like �Slut� and �Freak� but then they had moved to
threats like �You are next�, �We won�t let you live�, �We�ll kill you and your
freak boyfriend� and stuff like that. Isobel had noticed them too but was
trying to be strong for Leah�s shake. Byron then turned to the broken
full-length mirror. 

&nbsp;

�They broke the mirror. That�s seven years of bad
luck. They won�t have that much time.� Saying that he turned to Isobel and
looked her deep in her eyes. �I promise� he said and leaned to kiss her. �Take
care of your roommate. I�ve got things to attend to.� And he headed for the
door. 

&nbsp;

�Byron wait! Don�t leave. I don�t want to be alone.
Please stay here tonight.� She asked him in a way he was unable to refuse her.
He turned to her side again and put his left hand through her hair stroking
them a little. 

&nbsp;

�Alright� he said and tried to smile. �Have you
decided what are you going to do with Leah?�

&nbsp;

�I am calling at the hospital; we have to take her
there. She may have broken bones or damages in her organs�� Leah�s shaking
voice cut Isobel�s sentence in the middle.

&nbsp;

�No�please no�I� just want�to take a bath�to wash
them�off me�� she said and began to cry.

&nbsp;

�Alright, but we have to tell someone. Why not the
police? You need to tell them who did it so they can catch them and pay for
what they did to you.�

&nbsp;

�No�no�no one will�find out�no one will know�I am too
ashamed�I just want to�take a bath��she said and tried to raise her body but
she couldn�t. 

&nbsp;

�Lay there for a few minutes more and then I�ll take
you take a bath,� said Byron causing Leah to startle and open her eyes.

&nbsp;

�Oh god�I thought�we were alone� in her state of pain
she couldn�t understand what was going on around her and only now she saw that
another one knew what had happened to her.

&nbsp;

�Don�t worry Leah, no human will hear it from me� he
said smiling and their eyes met. His face was calm again and the light blue
color of his eyes was a soothing sight for Leah, which stopped crying while her
body was shaking no more. Isobel was still stroking Leah�s hair and was
wondering how he was doing that. He could transfer his calmness into someone
else by looking at his eyes. She was certain now. She loved him and she gave
him a look that could only say that. Byron gave her a warm smile telling her by
that he understood what she meant. �Come on now Leah. It�s time for your bath.�
He picked her up like a feather, walked to the bathroom and let her gently in
the bathtub. �Take your time. We�ll be outside� he said and left. 

&nbsp;

�Please�don�t leave me�I don�t want�to be alone.� She
was still very scared.

&nbsp;

�We are not leaving, we�ll be outside. But if you want
I can tell Isobel to come and sit with you.�

&nbsp;

�I want�both of you to be here�it will make me feel
safer�please?� 

&nbsp;

�Well if it
makes you feel better�� he said and walked over to the door. �Isobel come here
please.�

&nbsp;

�What�s the matter? Is she ok?� she thought something
had happened and almost ran in the bathroom. 

&nbsp;

�Yes, nothing is wrong, don�t worry. She just wants
you here to rub her back�� he said smiling and so did Leah, although laughing
brought her pain. Isobel did help her get cleaned while Byron was covering his
eyes with his hand pretending that he wasn�t going to look. Seeing that Leah
laughed again but now the pain was not so severe. She had a problem standing up
though since she was too weak and the trembling had returned. So, she was
either leaning against Isobel or against the walls. When they were done, Isobel
covered Leah with a big towel and Byron picked her up and transferred her to
her bed. She was lying on her bed for a few seconds when she started crying
again. Byron and Isobel turned and went beside her. 

&nbsp;

�It was my fault. I shouldn�t have gone there and�� 

&nbsp;

�Don�t say that. It�s not your fault. You didn�t do
anything wrong. They did and I can�t understand why you don�t want to turn them
to the police. Who are they?� Isobel was all over her now and she wasn�t going
to let them get away with it. 

&nbsp;

�Leah, look at me,� said Byron and she did. �Try to
relax and tell us what happen.� He was having the same effect on her again and
after a while she was calm.

&nbsp;

�I was at the party and we were having a great time,
we were drinking and dancing and there were a lot of cute guys all over me.
About nine o�clock five guys came running in the
frat house and headed for the bar. They started drinking big amounts of alcohol
and they were shaking. They were mumbling something but nobody could understand
what they were saying. After about an hour they said that they were hitting on
some black dressed girl and then Byron showed up and said he was going to kill
them if they didn�t leave her alone. Some of the older members of the frat
house said that it was unacceptable, that they had had enough of Byron�s
attitude and a whole more stuff. Some of them went upstairs and came down
holding knives and iron bars. I was scared because I realized that they were
talking about you. Then Kelly Preston said that she knew who that girl was. She
looked at me and said her name was Isobel and that I was her roommate. One guy
jumped at me and grabbed me. Then Paul came and slapped me hard in the face. I
couldn�t believe it. The worst thing was nobody did anything to stop him. They
stuffed a piece of cloth in my mouth and tied me to a chair. They left Kelly
watch over me and told her if she would let me go she was going to take my
place. Then they all got out and headed for the cinema. I pleaded Kelly to let
me go but she didn�t listen. Instead she would slap me in the face whenever I
made a sound. She pulled my hair and pinched my breasts and was calling me
names. She kept saying that they were going to beat Byron to death and were
going to bring Isobel back and rape us together. And then they would damp us at
some place no one could ever found us. I think that bitch really loved her role
too. As the time passed she was getting more vicious and she would hit me
harder.�

&nbsp;

�What a bitch!� said Isobel. �What did you ever do to
her?�

&nbsp;

�I don�t know. Maybe she was scared too to let me go
but nobody had told her to hit me. When they got back and we found out what had
happened Paul screamed at everybody to leave the frat house except from the
members. And that if someone would speak about what they had seen they were
going to pay hard. I was really scared because I saw Paul�s look. There were
ten people there and they were all heading towards me. Paul came close to me
and slapped me in the face almost knocking me down. Kelly untied me and one guy
came behind me and grabbed me. Paul used his knife and cut all my clothes and
then he slapped me again. He dragged me to a bed and then they started raping
me. First it was Paul and then I don�t know because Kelly had sat on my face.
That bitch! She was shouting at me to lick her pussy or else she would cut off
my breasts. I didn�t do it at first and she was slapping my breasts and the guy
that was fucking me was thrusting really hard and I was really feeling a lot of
pain and I was screaming but nobody was listening because they had the music so
loud. Then Kelly put the knife under my left breast and put pressure on it and
I got scared and I put my tongue at her pussy but I couldn�t do it. But after a
while she was moving her crotch up and down my face and her pubic hair were in
my nose and my mouth and I was feeling really sick but she kept on shouting to
lick her pussy. But I still couldn�t do it. Then she took the knife and start
cutting me. It was horrible, the pain I was feeling in my skin from the knife
and the pain I was feeling because there were ten people raping me. Then she told
me that if I didn�t lick her pussy they would start fucking my ass. I was
terrified. If they didn�t care about what they were doing to my pussy then what
would they do to my ass? So I did it. I started licking her and she was
shouting. She was calling me �slut�, �fucking dyke� and �pussy licker� and she
was slapping my breasts. Then she grabbed my ankles and lifted them up. I
couldn�t understand why she was doing that until I felt the first guy sticking
his dick in my asshole. 

&nbsp;

She had tricked me. They were going to rape my ass
anyway. She kept screaming at me not to stop what I was doing because then it
would be worse and so I didn�t. After a while she came and while her orgasm
lasted she was pinching and pulling my nipples. I thought she would rip them off.
When she let them my breasts were completely numb. She raised her body and
backed a little from me and she looked at me with an angry look I couldn�t
understand. She grabbed my hair and pulled them hard. She slapped me with both
hands and then she spit on my face calling me �slut� again. After that she left
and some guy I had never seen in my life took her place and put his dick on my
lips ordering me to open them but I wouldn�t do it. Then he slapped me and
pinched my nipples but still I didn�t do it. Then he pinched my nose with his
right hand and started laughing and so did everybody else. I was struggling to
resist him but I couldn�t last long. I was feeling my lungs burning and after
few seconds I opened my mouth and he put his dick inside. He pulled my whole
body at the edge of the bed and now my head was out of the bed and he was
thrusting his dick straight in my mouth. Meanwhile all the other guys were
still raping my pussy and ass and punching my stomach, slapping my breasts,
pinching my nipples and the inner parts of my thighs and cutting me with the
knife. But the worst was what that guy was doing in my mouth. He was thrusting
really hard and my neck was feeling very sore, I was gagging and wanted to
throw up but was afraid to do it because it would piss them off worse. After a
while that guy came in my mouth and ordered me to swallow it all but I couldn�t
so some of it run out of my mouth. 

&nbsp;

He got really angry and slapped my face so hard I
thought he had broken my jaw. He started shouting at me and spit in my open
mouth. That was when I turned my head and threw up. And I was right; it did
piss them off worse. Paul came round and grabbed my hair and dragged me across
the room throwing me on a wall. He then threw a bottle of beer that landed close
to me and broke in pieces cutting my legs. Then he took a belt and came closer.
I was so afraid and was pleading him to stop. I was trying to tell him that I
wasn�t going to the police if only they would stop hurting me and let me go.
Then I heard Kelly shout, �Tough luck bitch, hit her Paul� and so he did. And
he hit me again and again and again until I lost count and then my senses. When
I came round I was at the shower and Kelly was throwing cold water at me. When
she saw I was conscious again she turned off the water and grabbed my hair.
�Hello bitch, you didn�t think we were through with you, did you?� she said and
slapped my face while she called for Paul. He came in the bathroom and told
Kelly to let my hair. He didn�t do anything and I was trying to stand on my
feet. At some point I managed to do it but kept my head down, I didn�t want to
look at them, I was too afraid. �Look at me� he said and slowly I raised my
head. He looked at me with real hatred in his eyes and so did Kelly and then he
slapped me again throwing me to the floor. He came over me, grabbed my hair and
pulled me back to the room. When we got in the room he stopped and pulled me in
front of him. He raised my head and ordered me to open my eyes and look at
everybody. I did and I saw that they were all naked and already hard. He
dragged me for a few feet more and threw me to the floor. Then they started
rapping me again but now it was worse. They were rapping me two at a time. One
was fucking my pussy or my ass and the other one was thrusting his dick in my
mouth. When they were about to cum they would get in front of my face and cum
in my mouth telling me that if I didn�t swallow they would hit me with the
leather belt again. When I managed to swallow some guy�s load they would call
me �cock-sucking slut� and �cum-eater� and when I couldn�t do it Kelly would
hit my back and ass with the belt and if I was lying on my back she would aim
for my breasts and my pussy. I lost track of how many times I swallowed and how
many times she had hit me with the belt but all I know is at a certain point I
passed out again and woke up where you found me.� 

&nbsp;

When she finished talking Isobel was still stroking
Leah hair and tears had formed in her eyes. Leah looked up and smiled at
Isobel. �I�m happy that you are alright. I was so afraid of what they were
going to do to you if they had found you here.� Saying that Isobel began to
cry. After about fifteen minutes of intense crying they stopped and searched
for Byron. They saw him standing by the window looking outside. They didn�t say
anything and they were just looking at him. At first they thought that he
hadn�t paid any attention to what Leah was saying until he turned his face. His
eyes had lost their light blue color and where black, a sign of anger as Isobel
had already found out and they could see his tension by the veins in his neck
and face. He walked towards the bed and Isobel stood up. Byron sat beside her
and kissed her forehead. He smiled at her and Leah returned the smile. He
stroked her hair a little, then her right cheek and after that he kissed her
lips. It was a small sweet kiss, a kiss that told her to keep her spirits up,
to have courage that everything is going to be all right. He broke the kiss and
saw that he had achieved the desired effect. She smiled at him saying thank you
with her eyes.

&nbsp;

Byron stood up, went over Isobel, gave her a hug and
kissed her neck. �In a couple of hours a new day will start. Try to look things
in a new perspective. Be thankful that Leah is alive.� He said to Isobel and
then turned to Leah. �You are one of the most courageous people I know Leah. I
am proud to have met you. Don�t worry about a thing from now on. Come to the
university today. Don�t give them the satisfaction. And don�t tell anyone about
this either. I�ll deal with this. I�ll see you in a couple of hours my ladies�
he said, smiled, made a little bow and left the room. After a while Isobel
stood up and went to the window. She saw Byron walking in his usual fast and
decisive steps and get on his bike. The twilight didn�t help her much but she
could tell that he was looking at her because she saw his eyes sparkle in the
dark. He started the engine and lost him in the dark. She turned to the door
and put large furniture behind it, just to be a little more extra careful since
the door was broken. Then she took off her boots and the collar, her leather
trousers and the leather top and put on a black t-shirt she used to wear when
it was cold and went over to Leah. She got under the blanket and told Leah to come
closer to her, which she did. Leah rested her head on Isobel�s neck and threw
her right hand and leg over Isobel. Being naked in bed with an almost naked
Isobel, hugging and having her stroking her hair and her back was something she
couldn�t believe possible a few hours earlier. She let out a sigh, kissed
Isobel�s neck and closed her eyes. She had to be strong because in a few hours
she was going to face her tormentors, but now she wasn�t afraid. She had Byron
to protect her and Isobel in her arms. �Things can only get better� she thought
and let herself in the hands of Morpheus. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

----- Chapter 3
-----

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Isobel heard
the alarm clock and turned it off not to disturb Leah. She didn�t need it
thought to wake up. She hadn�t slept a bit. How could she? She kept bringing in
her mind the events of the last day. Her date with Byron, his fight, the bar
and all the nice people she met there, then seeing Leah and hearing all the
awful things that had happened to her. She was angry with all of them, she
hated them and she wished Leah would turn them to the police. But then she had
bathed and all the evidence was lost and furthermore it was the word of eleven
people against one. But Byron had told them not to speak to anyone and pretend
that nothing had happened. He even told them to go to the university. He had to
have a plan in his mind and although she brushed the thought of her mind; she
wished all the rumors about Byron were true. She wanted him to kill them and
take their hearts out and drink all of their blood. That was the only way they
could pay for what they had done to sweet Leah.�


&nbsp;

She felt her
moving and saw her open her eyes looking at her. �Good morning princess� said
Isobel smiling. Leah smiled back but soon after that pain reflected her face.
�What�s the matter?� she asked Leah.

&nbsp;

�My whole
body is in pain Isobel. I don�t think I can pull through today. I just want to
stay inside.� At that point she realized that her right hand was on top of
Isobel�s right breast and she raised it as fast as she could. �Oh I�m sorry�
she said embarrassed. Isobel took her hand, put it back on and kissed her on
her lips. 

&nbsp;

�I don�t
mind� she said and smiled. Leah�s face was suddenly lit and she got her spirits
up. Maybe it would be a better day after all she thought.

&nbsp;

�Tell me,
how was your date with Byron?� she asked Isobel and put her head on her neck
giving it a little kiss. 

&nbsp;

�It was
great. After the cinema we were riding randomly on his bike and then we went
for a drink in the best bar I�ve ever seen. Byron introduced me to everybody
and they seemed so happy to meet me. Everybody was so nice to me and they were
even buying me drinks.� At that point Leah raised her head and looked at her
puzzled. �Yes they did. All nightlong! As you can imagine I got quite drank.�
She said and Leah laughed. �I met some very interesting people too,� she said
and a smile of embarrassment appeared on her face. Leah was intrigued now. She
knew Isobel�s character had changed since she first saw Byron; she was more
open sexually now. She was almost naked lying in the same bed with her; she had
kissed her in her mouth and had even told her told her to grab her breast for
Christ sake! So her last words told her that something juicy was about to come.

&nbsp;

�Could you
define interesting?� said Leah smiling.

&nbsp;

�Well, first
I met Clio. She is the most beautiful woman I�ve ever seen and was dressed
really sexy too. She came to greet Byron and he introduced me to her. She put
her hand at my waist and kissed me at the lips and I didn�t know if liked it or
not. Then she put her hand on my ass and kissed me again and I definitely like
it. And she also has a very sexy voice too. And then I met a lot more other
people and men would kiss my hand making a bow like I was some kind of queen
and the women would kiss me in my cheek or neck and two of them kissed me in
the mouth and I felt great again.� While she was talking Leah was fondling
Isobel�s breast and was rubbing her nipple with her thumb. She had moved her
right leg between Isobel�s and was breathing on Isobel�s neck. �But then I kind
of messed the night because I was really drank and Byron told me that he would
bring me back. I can�t wait to go back there.� Leah laughed a little and Isobel
blushed. �I didn�t mean at that bar.� Leah gave her a look of disbelief. �I
meant that I couldn�t wait to go that particular area. I had never been there
before and it looked great.� Leah kept on looking at her in the same way only
now she was smiling. �Next time we�ll take you there and you�ll see for
yourself.� Finishing her sentence Isobel put her hands on Leah�s waist and
brought her body on top of her own with her legs between Leah�s. She stroked
Leah�s hair very tenderly and kissed her lips. �Things will be better from now.
I promise.� She told her and Leah smiled resting her head on Isobel�s left
shoulder. 

&nbsp;

Isobel put
her hands on Leah�s back and held her for a few minutes. Leah�s mind was racing
and a thousand thoughts came to it. She was naked on top of an almost naked
Isobel. She wasn�t feeling much pain now or somehow Isobel and Byron had
managed to make her forget about pain. �So nothing happened between you and
Byron?� she asked Isobel. �You know�nothing?�

&nbsp;

�No, we
didn�t have sex if that�s what you mean. But I don�t mind because we had a
great time and I am sure that we are going to at some point.� She said while
stroking Leah�s waist and ass making her move her body up and down in a slow
motion. 

&nbsp;

�You know,
you are really lucky to have found him,� said Leah enjoying Isobel�s caresses. 

&nbsp;

�Yes I know.
But don�t you worry, I think we can find someone for you too� she said and they
both laughed. Isobel was still paying attention on Leah�s ass when she began
kissing her neck and then her lips. She put her left hand behind Isobel�s neck
and her right back on her left breast. They were kissing full on the mouth
using their tongues as best as they could. At some point Leah put her hands
under Isobel�s back, broke the kiss, brought her head on her left shoulder and
started crying. 

&nbsp;

�Thank you�
she said and Isobel�s heart was broken. She kept on stroking her ass.

&nbsp;

�We�ll get
them for what they did to you Leah. I promise and remember Byron did too.�� Leah raised her head and kissed Isobel on her
lips again.

&nbsp;

�Ah yes, the
dark couple will protect me.� She said smiling and kissed her again. �As much
I�d prefer to stay here with you, we�ll better get up. We have a big day ahead
of us.� Saying that she kissed Isobel�s left breast over her t-shirt and got
up. Isobel was happy they had managed to bring the smile on her face again and
from now on she would be the big sister for her. Seeing Leah�s body in the
daylight brought tears in her eyes again. It was heavily bruised; it had more
cuts than she wanted to count and there were a lot of angry welts on her.
�Kelly will pay dearly� she thought and got up too. Leah went to take a shower
and after a while she called Isobel. 

&nbsp;

�Can you
help me please?� she said looking as innocent as a child but with a small grin
on her face that didn�t pass unnoticed by Isobel. She took her clothes off and
got in the shower. After all she wanted to take a shower too. They fooled
around a little, kissing and fondling, but she mostly did the washing job since
she wouldn�t let Leah bend her back or lift her legs. She was afraid that she
wasn�t strong enough yet and that was certainly the case even though Leah
didn�t want to admit it. After a while they got off the bathtub and she helped
Leah to towel off. She paid extra attention at the most bruised parts of her
body and especially at her crotch. When she was doing that part she was
kneeling and saw from a very close distance how much damage they had done to
it. After it was dry she blew it for a while and Leah felt great. It was a
small gentle blow like a mother does to the injured knee of her kid. Leah spread
her legs a little and told Isobel to do it again. And she did. Leah�s legs were
slightly trembling; she leaned against the wall and closed her eyes. She was
feeling great and wanted to savor the moment. Isobel kept blowing in the same
way for a couple more minutes. When she stopped she looked up and saw Leah�s
closed eyes and her erect nipples between her thumbs and index fingers. When
Leah realized that Isobel had stopped opened her eyes and looked down almost
pleading. Isobel smiled and put her hands on Leah�s legs spreading them more. 

&nbsp;

Then she
recommenced the blowing. But now it was different. She had her face closer to
Leah�s pussy, not even two inches from it and the effect of the blows were much
bigger on Leah. Isobel moved her hands very slowly up and down Leah thighs and
then put them behind her, grabbing her beautiful ass. She kept blowing,
stroking her ass while Leah was focusing on her breasts and nipples. After
about a minute Leah�s juices were starting to run and that was when Isobel
moved her face forward. She gave a big kiss on Leah�s pussy and used her hands
to spread her legs more. Leah was lost in a world of pleasure and the orgasm
was not far from that place. Leah put her hands on Isobel�s head and stroked
her hair. Isobel put her tongue on Leah�s pussy and began the exploration. It
was the first time she was doing that and she liked it and furthermore so did
Leah. Two minutes after Isobel�s tongue found Leah�s clit she came. She came
hard. Isobel didn�t move her face from her pussy but kept stroking her clit
with her tongue. The emotions were so great that Leah started crying again.
Maybe it was from the pain too. Isobel stood up and kissed Leah full on her
mouth using her hands to feel Leah�s breasts and ass. Isobel broke the kiss and
looked at Leah. �Now you have to take a shower again!� she said and they both
laughed. Leah did take another shower but alone that time. After a while she
got out of the bathroom and saw Isobel trying to clean up the place while she
was still naked. �She is so pretty� she thought and made her way further in the
room.

&nbsp;

�You are so
beautiful when you bend over� she said to Isobel and they both laughed. Isobel
was happy Leah was feeling better or it seemed that way. She stood up and Leah
let out a sigh of disappointment. Isobel turned to her and smiled. 

&nbsp;

�Enough
fooling around. Let�s get ready� she said and tried to pick clothes for Leah.
Meanwhile Leah had already put on some underwear and tried to apply a lotion on
her cuts and bruises. Isobel saw her and took the lotion from her hand and
applied it on Leah�s legs and back. She helped her put on a pair blue jeans and
a long sleeve shirt. She found a pair of boots and put them on her. They were a
beautiful sight too; Isobel on knees naked helping Leah to put her clothes on.
After that Isobel also got dressed. She wore exactly what she had worn the
night before. She put on the black thong but no bra, leather trousers and
leather top, the boots and the coat. She put on the same make up, the leather
collar and piercing rings. They used make up to cover the bruises on Leah�s
face and pretty much they were successful. The only spot that couldn�t be
covered was the cut on her lower lip. She wore a pair of dark glasses for extra
cover, picked up her jacket and left their room. 

&nbsp;

Isobel was
walking slowly so Leah wouldn�t have a problem keeping up with her. She was
constantly asking her how she was doing and if she felt any pain. Leah tried to
calm her saying that she was fine, that she felt pain but it wasn�t anything
she couldn�t handle. Every time she got that response from Leah Isobel was
feeling even happier. After a while she stopped asking her.

&nbsp;

�Isobel,
tell me more about the place you went yesterday� asked Leah.

&nbsp;

�The whole
area was unfamiliar to me. It was great though. It even had a different
architecture from all the other neighborhoods. The houses were bigger, much
older and made in a classical way. But every single one was very well
maintained. The streets were filled with people and there were even street lamps
with oil!� saying that Leah turned and looked at her totally amazed. �Yes there
were. I am telling you the whole area is totally picturesque! But most of all
is that the people that I met were so kind to me. And everybody seemed to know
Byron and I don�t think that�s because he goes there every night. They seemed
to respect Byron, there was a huge smile on the doorman when he told me that he
considered him his friend and the bartender gave us free drinks the minute he
saw him. And why those men were kissing my hand and bowing their heads like I
was the queen of England? Nevertheless, I suddenly felt
important. It sounds crazy but that was what I felt.� 

&nbsp;

�I cannot
believe how happy you are.� She said and hugged her. With all the talking they
hadn�t realized that they were close to campus and before they knew it they
were among hundreds of people. Suddenly Isobel felt Leah�s grip become stronger
and she understood that something was wrong so she stopped. 

&nbsp;

�What�s the
matter Leah? Did you see someone?� she was really concerned because Leah was
almost trembling. Leah was looking at a bench not far from where they were
standing. She saw Paul and six more guys and she knew that they were some of
her rappers. She took her head in her hands and made Leah face her. �Forget
about them. They cannot harm you now. You are beyond them. They will pay
remember? Byron said so.� Leah�s face was getting calm again and a hint of
smile appeared in her mouth. Isobel smiled her back, kissed her lips and hugged
her. As they were hugging they heard a familiar voice from behind them and they
turned.

&nbsp;

�Well, look
at that!� It was Kelly with her snob friends. She was standing two feet away
from her, laughing and so did her friends. Isobel released Leah from her hug
and turned to Kelly. She came close to her without saying anything. She was
just looking at her with eyes full of anger and hatred. Kelly�s friends backed
off a couple of steps and one of them run to Paul to get them. Kelly was
looking at Isobel�s eyes with her usual �I�m better than you all� look and
there was an evil grin on her face.

&nbsp;

�What are
you looking at, freak? She said and laughed. But that was it for Isobel. She
grabbed her by the neck and pushed her to a tree. Her friends didn�t do
anything and neither did anybody else. Isobel was just too pissed off to get in
her way. Kelly started swearing and cursing and tried to release herself from
Isobel�s grip but she couldn�t.

&nbsp;

�I know what
happened,� she said with a stern voice.

&nbsp;

�About
what?� said Kelly trying not to give herself away to the crowd that had
gathered.

&nbsp;

�I said I
know what happened. I know what you did. I know what everybody did.� Isobel was
really applying pressure on Kelly�s neck and her face had turned red.

&nbsp;

�I don�t
know what you are talking about bitch. Let me go.� She was moving her hands
trying to hit Isobel but she couldn�t succeed much. She had never been in a
situation like this before and she was taken by surprise. Isobel got close to
her and whispered in her ear.

&nbsp;

�I tried to
convince Leah to go to the police but she didn�t want to. I am going to make
sure you pay for what you did to her.�

&nbsp;

�You can�t
prove anything freak.� She had her snob look back on and that made Isobel even
angrier. 

&nbsp;

�I have all
the proofs I want. I am going to find a way to make you pay. To make all of you
pay.� She made a step back and released her neck leaving a bright red handprint
on her neck. 

&nbsp;

�You?� she
said and started laughing. �What do you think you can do?� 

&nbsp;

Her laugh
made Isobel go over the top and hit her with the back of the right hand right
in the face throwing her to the ground. Kelly stood up and attacked Isobel but
the only thing she succeeded in was getting to the ground again by another back
hand hit. Her lower lip was already bleeding and was swearing and cursing
Isobel, but she got up. She was too embarrassed from her defeat so far so she
attacked her again. Isobel moving too fast she grabbed her by the neck and
pushed her to the tree again. �Who said I am alone in this? Byron knows. He
told us not to tell anyone.� Saying that he starred at Kelly�s eyes and saw
terror appearing in her face. �He�ll deal with this.� She took a step back
still starring. She knew that if they were alone she would be in her knees
pleading. Isobel was still holding her neck so for one last touch of that day�s
revenge she moved her head forward with great speed hitting her on the nose and
threw her to the ground with another part of her face bleeding. Isobel turned
and saw Kelly�s friends making steps backwards and so did the rest of the
crowd. She felt so good about herself and because she saw on Leah�s face a huge
smile of gratitude. They hugged and tried to walk through the crowd. 

&nbsp;

�You were
amazing! How did you do all those things?� asked Leah with a very surprised
look.

&nbsp;

�I really
don�t know. It was like I could always do them. It was very natural for me to
move so fast and hit her with so much power. I loved it!� she said and smiled. 

&nbsp;

They made a
couple of steps more and saw Paul and his friends coming towards them almost
running. They frowned. Surely Isobel could deal with Kelly but against seven
guys she didn�t think she had much luck. They made some steps back and turned
to run to the opposite way but three more Paul�s friends cut them off. After a
few seconds they were surrounded. Just when Paul started to make his way
towards Isobel they heard a very serious voice coming a few feet from them.

&nbsp;

�Think
really well what you are about to do.� Everybody turned and saw Byron standing
with his back at a tree looking down. He raised his head slowly and they saw
his eyes. They had lost their light blue color again and were black. Now it was
their time to remain still as statues. Byron was looking directly at Paul. He
raised his left hand calling Isobel and Leah to come to him, which they did
without second thought. He gave Leah a light kiss on her lips and asked her if
she was all right.

&nbsp;

�Yes, thanks
to Isobel.� She said and looked at her. 

&nbsp;

�I know. I saw. You were great Isobel.� He said and
gave her a very passionate kiss. �I knew you were the one.� He said and smiled
leaving Isobel floating in the skies from what she had heard. He turned to Paul
and walked towards him. He was almost trembling. �You were about to make a
horrible mistake. But I forgive you. I forgive all of you for what you were
about to do now.� As he said that he spoke loud and turned to look at all of
them. Then he turned back to Paul and whispered in his ear. �For what you did
last night to Leah I cannot forgive you. I shall not forgive you.� Paul was
shocked. He wasn�t aware that he had found out so soon. He was hoping that he
wouldn�t find out or that he would be frightened when he did. But Byron was
right in his face and he didn�t seem very afraid. �Last night I made a mistake.
I let all of you live. I am going to correct my mistake.� He made a small step
back and looked at Paul. �It has already begun.� He said and saw the terror in
Paul�s eyes. �There is a full moon tomorrow.� He said, turned and walked to
Isobel and Leah leaving Paul stunned. He put his hands on each girl�s waist and
headed to the university.

�

The rest of the day was uneventful, for them at least.
At breaks they would meet under Byron�s tree and would talk and have fun. They
were also planning their night. Byron told them that he would come with someone
to pick them up at nine o�clock and take them
out. Isobel was very happy for many reasons. She would go out with Byron again,
he had arranged someone for Leah so she wouldn�t be left alone and she knew it
would have to be someone good plus they would probably go at the place they had
been the last day. Leah tried to protest a little saying that she didn�t feel
like going out and partying but neither Isobel nor Byron would have any of
that. 

&nbsp;

�It is settled. At nine o�clock you�ll be
ready.� 

&nbsp;

�What should I wear? It�s not like we have the same
dress habits!� said Leah and smiled.

&nbsp;

�Don�t worry. Wear whatever makes you comfortable. You
will look beautiful whatever you choose!� he said and smiled and so did Leah
blushing a little.

&nbsp;

Back at the frat house everybody was quite nervous.
Paul told them what Byron had said to him. He couldn�t understand though why
Byron said �it had begun�. All ten of them were at the frat house and so was
Kelly with her friends. He couldn�t possible be talking about Isobel�s fight
with Kelly. And then it hit him. What about those five guys that started the
whole thing? They hadn�t seen any of them and send two frat members to find
out. After an hour they appeared saying that they hadn�t been to classes and no
one had seen them today. �So it has begun.� Said Paul and started walking up
and down the room. He was afraid. He was scared more than he had never been in
his life. There was nothing he could do either. He couldn�t tell the head
master or the police because then he would have to tell them what had happened.
They had attacked Byron and he had let them go. Then they attacked, beaten and
gang raped his girlfriend�s roommate and Isobel would have the same fate if
they had found her plus they had broken into their room and had destroyed most
of it. And then that morning they tried to attack Isobel again. There wasn�t
anything to justify their actions. So it had to be dealt by them. But how would
they succeed? They had already tried and he had defended himself against seven people
with knives and iron bars. They needed a plan. The whole situation brought him
a headache. He went to the fridge and grabbed a six-pack. He went back to the
room and sat on a big chair. He started drinking without talking to anyone. 

&nbsp;

A second and then a third followed the first six-pack.
After about three hours he was pretty much drank and couldn�t think anymore. He
looked around for Kelly but she wasn�t around. He stood up and searched the
place. He found her outside talking with her friends. He called all of them
inside and they did. They walked back to the room where everybody else were
leaving the girls with his drank buddies and almost dragged Kelly to a room
upstairs. She didn�t like what has happening but she couldn�t resist him. Paul
opened a door and got inside. They walked inside and told her to undress. She
did, although because she was afraid it took her some time and that made Paul
rip her underwear from her. She tried to cover herself and pleaded Paul not to
do it because he was drank. He laughed.

&nbsp;

�I didn�t see you complain last night.� He said and
grabbing her by the hair threw her to the floor. He unbuttoned his blue jeans
and took his dick out. �Suck� he said but Kelly stood motionless. �I said suck
my dick or else�� saying that he showed her the leather belt that was laying a
few steps from her. She panicked and took his dick in her left hand. She
brought it in her mouth and gave it a little kiss. �I said suck it not kiss
it!� he said in a very angry tone and she put his dick in her mouth. He was
already erect so when she put it in her mouth she grabbed her hair and shoved
his dick all the way in. She gagged and tried to release her head from his grip
but he was just too strong. He was thrusting hard swearing and calling her
names. After a while he pulled his dick out of her mouth and released his grip
he had on her head. She fell to the floor gasping for air and almost in tears. 

&nbsp;

�Please Paul, no more! I can�t breath.� Her pleadings
didn�t have an affect on Paul who grabbed her hair again and threw her on the
bed. He got between her legs and shoved his dick in her pussy in one motion.
She screamed from the pain but after a while she was screaming from the
pleasure. Paul knew that she loved pain and humiliation. Her orgasms were
bigger when pain was involved. Receiving or inflicting, it didn�t really matter
to her. She loved pain. After about ten minutes his thrusts became stronger. He
was more aggressive and he would fuck her with all his length. She put her legs
behind his and her arms behind his back. She was screaming really loud by now
and so was he. When he was about to cum he took his dick out and put in front
of her face. 

&nbsp;

�Open your mouth Kelly. I want to cum in your mouth.
And you are going to swallow it all.� He saw that she wouldn�t comply
immediately with his commands and pinched her left nipple hard. She opened her
mouth to scream and that was enough for Paul to stick his dick in her mouth.
She was surprised by that but couldn�t do anything. �Suck bitch!� he ordered
and Kelly started moving her head back and forth. Paul wasn�t satisfied by the
result so he grabbed her head and made her swallow his entire dick. She was
gagging again but this time she was enjoying it. She used her right hand to
massage his balls and put her left middle finger in his asshole. He knew she
loved pain and she knew he wanted something in his ass. After about two minutes
of violent thrusts he came. He didn�t release her head until she had swallowed
all of his sperm. She was gagging, crying moving her hands frantically but he
didn�t let her go. After a few seconds Paul had finished and took his dick out
of Kelly�s mouth. �Clean my dick with your tongue.� He said and she complied.
When she was done his dick was clean from his sperm, her pussy juices and was
glistened with her saliva. He got off, cleaned his dick with her shirt and
fixed his clothes. �That�s what I like about you Kelly. You always swallow. You
are the best slut on campus.� He said and went back downstairs laughing while
Kelly was swearing at him. When he got back downstairs he gathered whoever
wasn�t fucking with one of Kelly�s friends and began discussing on how to get
back on Byron, Isobel and Leah. After a while someone came in the frat house
saying he had important information. Paul asked about what and when he answered
him that it was about Byron everybody went silent. �I overheard them talking
and he said that he would come over their apartment and pick them at nine.�
Paul was very satisfied by his contribution to their cause and led him to the
fridge offering him its interior. 

&nbsp;

Meanwhile Isobel and Leah had finished their classes
and accompanied by Byron headed back to their room. It was five o�clock when they arrived at the entrance. He opened his
coat, took out a small bottle that seemed very old and gave it to Leah. 

&nbsp;

�Thanks it�s beautiful.� She said and kissed Byron in
his right cheek. 

&nbsp;

�I didn�t give you a present Leah.� He said and she
blushed from embarrassment. �You are supposed to drink it. It�s a very old
medicine. It will help you heal faster.�

&nbsp;

�Oh and how do I�?�

&nbsp;

�Take a shower, drink it right from the bottle and
take a nap. You�ll wake up much better.�

&nbsp;

�Don�t you have anything for me?� asked Isobel with a
smile in her face. 

&nbsp;

�I do have something for you my lady but you are not
going to get it now.�

&nbsp;

�Can�t you give me something in advance?� Byron
smiled, put his right hand in her waist, pulled her close to him and kissed her
in her mouth. They were both lost for quite a while when Leah pretended to
cough. They broke the kiss laughing.

&nbsp;

�You are not alone lovebirds. Plus you are making me
feel jealous because I�m alone!� said Leah laughing.

&nbsp;

�Not for long� said Byron and got their attention.

&nbsp;

�Tell me Byron who is this mysterious someone? Do I
know him?� asked Isobel.

&nbsp;

�Now it wouldn�t be a surprise if I told you, would
it?� answered Byron and made a few steps back to leave. �Remember ladies, nine o�clock.� He smiled, bowed his head a little and left.

&nbsp;

They waved good-bye, turned and went upstairs. They
got in their room and tried to clean up the mess. Isobel told Leah to take a
shower and drink Byron�s medicine. It would be better if she wouldn�t try to
help her. She tried to argue but she didn�t have a chance against Isobel. She
undressed and went to the bathroom. She was feeling better since morning and
she was able to bathe on her own. It did take her a while though and Isobel
asked a couple of times if she �needed a hand�, an offer that made Leah laugh.
After about half an hour Leah got out of the bathroom holding a small jar with
ointment and saw the room in perfect condition. 

&nbsp;

�Great job! How did you clean so fast?� she was so
surprised. 

&nbsp;

�Maybe because I am not like you.� She answered and
laughed. �I am going to take a shower now. Don�t forget to drink the medicine. �

&nbsp;

�Yes mom� she replied and smiled. 

&nbsp;

�By the way, you look better shaved,� said Isobel
looking at Leah�s pussy making her blush a little. She saw Isobel undress and
walk to the bathroom naked.

&nbsp;

��God she is
pretty,� she thought to herself. 

&nbsp;

She spent a couple of minutes trying to decide which
part of her preferred more, her ass, her breasts or her pussy. But she couldn�t
come up to a conclusion. She brushed that thought of her mind and wished Byron
would hook up with her someone as handsome as he was. She put the ointment on
her legs, breasts and pussy to help with the cuts and those welts that still
had on her. �Damn you Kelly. I hope I�ll get you for this.� She wanted Byron to
make all of them pay but maybe she would ask him to let her have a small part
in Kelly�s punishment. The ointment didn�t do much on her about the scars but
at least she wouldn�t get infected. The bad thing was that when she put it on
her breasts and especially her pussy she was getting numb and feel her skin
burn. When she had finished her front Isobel came out of the bathroom. Leah
raised her head and saw her walking in front of her drying her hair with a
towel. �She is so pretty and her skin is smooth. I found it. The best thing
about her is her touch.� She remembered how she felt when she was son top of
her and Isobel had her hands on her back and her ass. 

&nbsp;

�Will you put some of this ointment on my back?� said
Leah while extending her hand with the ointment. Isobel took it and told her to
roll over to her stomach. She put some of the ointment in her hands and applied
to her legs first. Now she was certain. Isobel�s touch was wonderful. Isobel
was moving her hands slowly up and down as light as a summer breeze. After a
while she moved upwards and focused on Leah�s thighs. She spread her legs a
little enjoying the feeling and Isobel saw Leah�s right hand disappear under
her body. She smiled and gave it a little slap. Leah let out a moan of
disappointment but she did comply with Isobel�s order. Leah felt ointment on
her back and then Isobel hands going up and down and she was in heaven again.
She would move her hands all the way to her neck and go down to her waist. She
put the ointment in every inch of her back bringing a small trembling in Leah�s
body. Isobel climbed on top of the bed and sat on Leah�s legs. At that point it
seemed like she was lightly massaging Leah�s back and not as much as applying
ointment. She leaned on her and kissed her along her spine, which made her
tremble more.

�

Then she put some ointment on her left ass cheek and
went to the right ass cheek without stopping. Leah heard Isobel closing the
jar, a sound that could only mean she had put it on the table and then she felt
her hands on her ass. She had moved lower on her legs and was sitting almost on
her heels. Leah was moaning now and tried to move her right hand back to her
pussy again but Isobel slapped it again telling her �no�. Isobel was focusing
on her left ass cheek first with both her hands, rubbing, caressing it and then
moved to the right one following the same procedure. When she was done she
raised her body and told Leah to spread her legs, something she did
immediately. She placed herself between Leah�s legs, kneeled and put her mouth
on Leah�s left thigh. She planted many small kisses all the way to her left ass
cheek, continued to the right and descended on the right thigh. Leah was
moaning and her heart began to beat faster. Leah tried to move both of her
hands to her pussy but Isobel saw it and pinned her hands to the mattress with
her own. She made small circles with her tongue on the left ass cheek and then
moved her tongue to her right without breaking the contact with Leah�s skin.
She made the same thing on her right cheek and then gave it a small bite, which
made Leah�s moan louder. Isobel moved her tongue to the middle of Leah�s ass
and pressed her face deeper. Leah didn�t expect that and bit her lip to avoid
screaming. Isobel moved her tongue higher and focused in her tailbone for a
little, sending Leah to heaven. She moved her tongue slowly all the way along
her spine while laying her body on Leah�s and after a while she was kissing her
neck while being on top of her. She pushed Leah�s hands over her head and went
for her breasts. She found them and caressed them and played with the nipples a
little. Isobel was moving her body back and forth and she intensified her pace
even more when she put her right hand on Leah�s pussy. 

&nbsp;

�Are you all right?� asked Isobel. �Do I hurt you?�
she was afraid but Leah�s moaning told her that she should go on and she did.
After a while she found her clit and fondled with it using her thumb and index
finger. Leah�s body was moving up and down pressing her ass on Isobel�s pussy
all the while giving her right hand more space to move. Leah was lost. With
Isobel�s left hand on the breasts, her right hand on her clit, her breasts on
her back and her lips kissing her neck she was very close. And she did come.
After ten minutes from the time Isobel�s first encounter with Leah�s clit she
came and it felt great. It felt even better than the orgasm she had that
morning. When she finished they remained still without moving for a couple of
minutes more. Then Isobel raised her body and told her to lie on her back and
Leah did. She looked at Leah�s happy face and smiled. She leaned and kissed
Leah�s lips and then her right nipple. �You need to take a shower again� she
said and got of the bed. Leah got up too and walked over to the bathroom to
wash the sweat off her body. Isobel saw the bottle Byron had given to Leah at
the table beside her bed and grabbed it to check it out better. The bottle
seemed to be very old, it was made of black and very thick glass and its
content couldn�t be more than 10ml. She raised it and saw an inscription on the
bottom of it but it was written in a language she couldn�t understand plus the
bottle wasn�t empty something that pissed her off a little. At that point Leah
got out off the bathroom.

&nbsp;

�Leah, didn�t you drink it?�

&nbsp;

�What? Oh the medicine. No I didn�t drink it.�

&nbsp;

�You are such a child!� she said and nodded to come to
her. Leah went close to the bed, kneeled in front of her and put her hands
behind her back thrusting her breasts forward. Isobel turned to her side and
put her between her legs. �Open your mouth� and Leah complied while she leaned front
almost resting her mouth on Isobel�s thighs. Isobel smiled, opened the bottle
and purred a very dark red liquid in her mouth slowly. �Now be a good girl and
drink it� and Leah did. When Isobel saw she had swallowed took her head in her
hands and kissed her lips very passionately. After a few seconds she broke the
kiss and looked at Leah. 

&nbsp;

�It tasted like blood!� said Leah almost shocked. 

&nbsp;

�It did. But Byron said it would make you fell
better.� She stroked her hair a little and then she fell back to get a nap.
Leah followed her and after a few minutes she was sleeping holding Isobel naked
in her arms again. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

----- Chapter 4
-----

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

After a full two-hour sleep Leah woke up feeling
better. Isobel had her back turned to her but that just gave her an opportunity
to look at her wonderful ass. She moved her hand and touched it. It was so
perfect and her skin was so smooth. She felt it for a little longer and then
she moved for the front. She came as close as she could to Isobel and fondle
her breasts with her right hand. She played with her nipple a little and kissed
her neck. She always smelled so good too. She sensed Isobel move a little but
she was still sleeping. Leah moved her hand downwards slowly. She played with
her navel ring a little and then headed for her pussy. Her shaven pussy felt
incredible and she just rested her hand on her pussy for a while. She was
caressing her pussy when Isobel subconsciously spread her legs. �I�m sure I
don�t have to think hard what she is dreaming� she thought and continued. She
put her hand between Isobel�s thighs and pressed her body forward bringing
herself on top of her. Isobel started to moan and not long after that she woke
finding herself under Leah�s body and with her right hand on her pussy. 

&nbsp;

�Hey what�s going?� she said.

&nbsp;

�Nothing much, don�t worry, lay back and enjoy!�
answered Leah and kissed her neck. Isobel spread her legs wider and followed
her roommate�s advice. Leah put her left hand on Isobel�s pussy too bringing
her faster closer to the edge. Isobel was sweating and was moving her body in a
quicker pace minute by minute. She put her hands on Leah�s keeping them there
and giving an extra pressure and speed in their own. Leah put a hand on her
left nipple and played with it a little sending Isobel over the top. Isobel
resisted for two more minutes and then she gave her self up to the wonderful
sensations of a powerful orgasm. When Isobel caught her breath back, she turned
her body so she could lie on her back. When Isobel turned and saw Leah�s body
she opened her mouth in awe, something that caused Leah to look at her puzzled.

&nbsp;

�What�s the matter?�

&nbsp;

�Your body is healed. There are no cuts, no bruises
and no welts. This is incredible. I didn�t think you would heal so fast!� Leah
hadn�t noticed and she looked at her body in disbelief. She did feel better
when she woke up but she didn�t expect something like that. She stood up and
started walking to check for pain. 

&nbsp;

�Your back is fully healed too!� said Isobel almost
screaming.

&nbsp;

Leah was running up and down, she was jumping, she was
touching the parts of her body that were more severely injured but she felt
nothing. She was healed and there were no signs of abuse in any part of her
body. And furthermore she felt more vivid, more courageous and thirstier for life
itself.� Isobel had to run and catch her
on the door preventing her from going out to the corridors to continue her
screaming and dancing. She hugged Isobel, raised her and kissed her in her
lips. Isobel for some strange reason felt Byron�s presence inside her. Leah was
so happy and so was Isobel although a little puzzled by that feeling. After
some more running in the room Leah looked at the clock. 

&nbsp;

�Shit its 7, 30! Byron with his friend will come at
nine. We should get ready.� Saying that she run to the bathroom to get a
shower. �Are you coming?� she asked Isobel but she turned her down.

&nbsp;

�I don�t think so. With your mood right now, we won�t
be ready not even at midnight!� and they
both laughed.

&nbsp;

Isobel started thinking what had happened. Byron�s medicine
was pure magic. Two hours after Leah had drunk it she was completely healed.
Cuts, bruises, welts were all gone, from her legs, her back, her ass, her pussy
even her face. But it did taste like blood although it wasn�t bad it was rather
good. And why did she feel his presence when Leah hugged her and kissed her?
Leah�s singing brought her back to the real world. After about fifteen minutes
she got out with the biggest smile she could wear in her face. Nothing could
conceal her happiness. She walked towards Isobel, put her right leg between
hers, her left hand behind her neck and her right on her left ass cheek and
kissed her passionately. Isobel felt it again. She could sense something of
Byron in Leah. She raised Isobel and threw her on the bed lying on top of her
and kissed her again. 

&nbsp;

�I feel so good Isobel. I have never felt so strong in
my life. I think I can do anything. And the strangest thing is that I feel so
horny right now.� saying that she looked right in Isobel�s eyes with a look of
total lust. �I cannot thank Byron now, but I can thank you�� an evil grin
appeared on her face and she kissed her again. She used her legs to spread
Isobel�s and put her right hand on her left breast giving it a little squeeze
and sucked her nipple. Isobel was lost in a world of confusion and pleasure. It
was like Byron was kissing her through Leah�s lips. She tried to understand
what was going on but her train of thought was interrupted when she felt Leah�s
tongue descending slowly to her navel and then her pussy. Leah was on her
knees, her hands were spreading her pussy lips and her tongue was attacking her
clit. Leah�s tongue brought trembling to Isobel and she put her hands on Leah�s
head to encourage her to keep doing�what she was doing. Leah used her tongue to
explore Isobel�s pussy and her hands to fondle her breasts. Isobel didn�t last
long. She was about to cum and told that to Leah but she remained there. The
only thing Isobel could do was surrender to Leah�s tongue and after about half
a minute she came. When Leah tasted Isobel�s juices for the first time she
continued with a more intense rhythm. She put her hands on her pussy spreading
the lips and sucked and licked her dry. It was eight
 o�clock when Isobel�s heart beat came back to normal. 

&nbsp;

�Did I please you my lady?� asked Leah with her head
still between Isobel�s thighs. She was still kneeling on the floor. But Isobel
thought she had made a joke and smiled at her. She raised her body, took Leah�s
head in her hands and kissed her lips tasting her own juices. 

&nbsp;

�Yes you did.� she said giving her a warm smile. �But
we are running out of time. I need to take a shower.� She stood up and walked
to the bathroom. They had less than an hour to get ready. She took a quick
shower and after ten minutes she was out talking with Leah about what to wear. 

&nbsp;

Leah thought that they would look great if they wore
the same clothes and Isobel agreed. They wore black thongs, tight leather
trousers and black leather boots. They put on the same make up, black lipstick,
matching eyeliner and black nails. Isobel let her hair fall back and didn�t
change the piercing rings either. They wore black push up bras; Isobel wore a
black silk shirt leaving the two top buttons open while Leah put a sleeveless
shirt on that she tied in a knot a couple of inches above her navel showing a
lot of cleavage. Isobel put her leather coat on and so did Leah. Isobel let her
hair fall back but had a very good idea about Leah�s hair. She picked up a
black velvet band and fixed her hair in a ponytail high in her head. Leah
looked herself in the mirror.

&nbsp;

�It looks great. I wouldn�t have thought of it.� She
turned towards Isobel smiling and kissed her lips. She put her hands inside
Isobel�s coat, grabbed her ass bringing closer to her body. There was it again.
She felt Byron in her lips. It was totally strange but made her feel great
since she was feeling Leah in the same time. They kissed for a few more seconds
and then Leah broke the kiss. 

&nbsp;

�Shall we go my lady?� she said and opened her door.

&nbsp;

�Indeed we shall.� Answered Isobel and walked through
the door. She was beginning to like being treated like that. 

&nbsp;

They took the elevator and about ten minutes before
nine they were standing at the entrance waiting for Byron and his mysterious
friend. It was another beautiful October night, not too cold but they were glad
they took their coats. Leah was more anxious and kept asking Isobel to describe
every single one of Byron�s friends she had met. While they talked Isobel heard
a whisper and the sound of steps on dead leaves that kept becoming stronger.
After a couple of seconds Leah did too and turned to see where it did came
from. They saw many figures coming towards them with a quick pace and Leah
backed off a little and took Isobel�s left hand in her own. Isobel tried to
remain calm as much as she could for Leah�s shake. They saw the figures run and
in a few seconds they were standing a few feet from them. It was Paul with all
the guys that had rapped Leah and they were holding chains this time. Isobel
could see Kelly a few steps behind them trying to hide behind a tree. Leah got
behind Isobel and hugged her. 

&nbsp;

�Hey look, it�s the dyke twins! So bitches remember
us?� said Paul looking at Leah.

&nbsp;

�I don�t. But I am sure we can fix that.� Everybody
turned to find out where that female voice came from. 

&nbsp;

�Clio!� she was one of the last people Isobel thought
she would see at that moment. 

&nbsp;

Everybody remained still. She was the most beautiful
woman they had ever seen. She was wearing a leather coat that reached her
ankles, a pair of leather trousers and because the coat was not buttoned they
could see that she was wearing a very short leather top that showed off
perfectly her gorgeous breasts. She had her spiked leather collar on her neck
and her hair fell freely on her shoulders. She had the same fast and decisive
walk of Byron and in a few seconds she was standing in front of the girls.

�

�Are you all right Isobel?� she asked with a smile in
her face while she stroked Isobel�s cheek with her fingers. 

&nbsp;

�Yeah, now that you are here too. But I would feel
even better if Byron�s was here. Where is he?� 

&nbsp;

�Don�t worry my lady. Your prince is watching,� she
whispered in her ear. She kissed her neck and then turned to Leah. �And you are
Leah?� She said and received a nod of agreement. �I am very happy to meet you.�
Clio smiled, made a small step forward and kissed Leah in her lips. 

&nbsp;

�What is this? Dyke convention?� said Paul and all of
them laughed. 

&nbsp;

Clio broke the kiss and turned to face Paul. �I am
going to take a wild guess and assume that you are the leader of this mob and
that blond chicken that�s hiding behind a tree is your bitch?� She was looking
straight in Paul�s eyes with a calmness that made him uncomfortable. He looked
around trying to find the only man his was afraid of. �He is here but if it
will make you feel more comfortable he is not going to intervene.� Clio�s words
made Paul smile but Isobel got scared and grabbed Clio�s hand pulling her
towards her. 

&nbsp;

�What did you say? He is going to stay out of this?�
she couldn�t believe that he was going to let them deal with all those guys
that above all things had chains in their hands and she was sure they were
going to use them. 

&nbsp;

�Fear not my lady. I am not going to let them touch
you��she said and turned her gaze to Leah. ��or beautiful Leah.� She said and
smiled; a smile that made Leah blush. Clio had made quite an impression to Leah
and not because she was the most beautiful creature she had ever seen. She had
the same aura of mystery that Byron had the same confidence and the same
calmness without forgetting that she was sexy as hell. 

&nbsp;

�Hey bitch! This doesn�t concern you so if you want
what is best for you take your dyke ass and get the hell out of here before you
get what they are about to get.� Paul�s words brought cheering and shouting
from his friends. Clio turned to him remaining as calm as ever.

&nbsp;

�First of all ape creature, my name is Clio. Second,
you wouldn�t believe how much this situation concerns me. And third�if any of
you try to touch Isobel or Leah�he is going to pay.� Finishing her sentence she
remained still and nodded to the girls to come behind her that they gladly did.


&nbsp;

�Well if that�s what you want, that�s what you are
going to get. Tim she�s all yours.� Said Paul and a big guy walked forward wielding
his chain with his right hand. He made a few steps taking an angry face trying
to scare Clio but he didn�t succeed. Clio looked around to see if there were
any more spectators but seeing that they were alone, put her right hand in her
coat and pulled out a big shining sword. Everybody froze including Isobel and
Leah. Tim made a couple of steps back but Clio remained still with her sword in
her right hand. She looked in Tim�s eyes and made a few steps forward. 

&nbsp;

�Were you among the people that attacked Byron last
night?� she asked and Tim nodded that he was. �Were you among the people that
rapped Leah last night?� again he nodded that he was. She turned her gaze from
Tim and looked at everybody. �Byron let you live last night because there were
a lot of people around. Tonight we are alone� saying that she walked towards
Paul and starred at him. �Byron forgave those five little assholes that tried
to attack Isobel and told them to stay away from her. They didn�t listen to him
and they paid the price.� Her tone of voice could only mean one thing about the
fate of those five guys. 

&nbsp;

�For what you did to Leah there is no forgiveness and
you are going to pay but not today. Tomorrow is Saturday. Byron invites you
all, including Miss Preston, to the old castle at midnight. There we
shall settle this once and for all.� She turned her back to them and walked to
Isobel and Leah. �Shall we depart my lady? Your prince is waiting.� She asked
Isobel receiving an affirmative nod. Clio turned to look Paul again. �Don�t even
try and think to avoid coming tomorrow. There�s no place you can hide in day or
night�� She turned, put her hand in Leah�s waist and walked away. Both Isobel
and Leah were shocked from what had happened and heard. 

&nbsp;

�Did you really mean what you told them?� asked
Isobel.

&nbsp;

�Why would I lie Isobel?� answered Clio puzzled from
Isobel�s question.

&nbsp;

�Well to scare them for start. And you did a pretty
good job too. They were speechless.�

&nbsp;

�It wasn�t a game Isobel. Tomorrow night at the old
castle we shall fight them. They have to pay for what they did to Leah.� She
was talking with a very serious tone in her voice and she felt Leah stopping
causing her to stop too. 

&nbsp;

�Are you serious then? Tomorrow night you and Byron
will fight against ten people to revenge what they did to me?� She was looking
directly at Clio�s eyes and when she answered �yes� she hugged her. Clio hugged
her back and they stayed like that for a few seconds. 

&nbsp;

�You are worth it Leah.� Answered Clio and kissed her
lips.

&nbsp;

�Let�s not forget about Miss Preston.� They heard
Byron�s voice and Isobel turned and ran to his arms. She put her hands around
him and kissed his lips and his neck and then she broke the kiss and started
hitting him in his chest.

&nbsp;

�I can�t believe you didn�t do anything. What would
happen if they had attacked her?�

&nbsp;

�Then we would deal with less people tomorrow!� he
said and smiled. �But let�s not ruin our night with tomorrow�s events. We have
a whole day and most important a whole night ahead of us.� He put his hand in
Isobel�s waist and kissed her. 

&nbsp;

�What are you going to do to Kelly?� asked Leah.

&nbsp;

�It�s up to you. But enough talk about that. We�ll
deal with it tomorrow night. Tonight we are going to have fun.� The moment
Byron finished his sentence they reached his bike. He got on and Isobel sat
behind him while Clio got on an identical bike that was parked a couple of feet
further and Leah sat behind her. They turned on the engines and left. 

&nbsp;

After a little wandering around they arrived at the
bar Isobel had been the last night. They parked their bikes outside and headed
for the door. Byron opened it and Frank greeted him. When he saw Isobel he
bowed his head and kissed her hand smiling.

&nbsp;

�Good evening lady Isobel. It�s good to see you
again.� He said and Isobel smiled him back. She couldn�t understand why they
were treating her like this but she sure did enjoy it. 

&nbsp;

�Good evening Frank. It�s good to see you too.� She
told him back and walked forward. Clio was welcomed in the same manner as
Isobel.

&nbsp;

�Good evening Frank. Meet Leah. She is Isobel�s friend
and her roommate.� When she mentioned the fact that she was her roommate
Frank�s face hardened just for a second and then his warm smile returned to his
face. 

&nbsp;

�Good evening Leah. I am glad to meet you.� He said
and kissed both her hands. Leah blushed, smiled and greeted him. After that
they walked up the stairs and got in the bar.

&nbsp;

Leah is not a Goth type but she immediately loved the
place. She was as surprised as Isobel was when everybody went to them just to
say hello. They seemed to be very nice and really happy to meet them. She saw
how they treated Isobel and understood what she was telling her about that
morning. But their attitude towards her wasn�t much different. It was strange
but it seemed to her that Byron and Clio were two very important people in that
particular community and their guests should be treated accordingly. As Isobel
had told the bartender gave them a free round of beers and then there was a big
crowd around them that were buying them drinks. She was having a great time. 

&nbsp;

She saw Byron and Isobel hugging and kissing and
remembered how stupid she was at the beginning when she was pressuring her to
forget him. He was so handsome and kind and he seemed to really like her. Of
course she couldn�t forget how much he helped that last night when they had
found her and the medicine he gave her. And above all he was going to fight for
against ten people! But he wouldn�t be alone, Clio would be with him. But where
was she? She turned her head to look for her and she saw her talking to the
bartender. She walked towards her and hugged her. 

&nbsp;

�I was looking all over for you.� She said and kissed
her neck. Clio took Leah�s hands and put them on her stomach enjoying the
feeling of her lips on her neck. Leah got more courageous and began moving her
hands up and down. She passed her hands on top Clio�s leather top, grabbing
just for a little bit her breasts and then brought them down, on top of her
crotch pressuring inwards a little. After a while the bartender came with a bottle
of red wine and gave it to Clio. She thanked him, turned, put her left on
Leah�s waist and led her to a corner. There they continued their kissing and
fondling but now they were drinking in the same time. Isobel looked at them and
smiled. 

&nbsp;

�They look good together. How did you choose her?� she
asked Byron.

&nbsp;

�I knew they would like each other. Clio is a nice
person, I like her and I think she can help Leah get over what happened to
her.� 

&nbsp;

�Your medicine has done it already. I don�t know what
it was in it but when she woke up her body was completely healed and she was
feeling great too. She wasn�t in any kind of pain and felt very vivid and
happy. You did a great job again my prince!� she said and kissed him. �How did
you meet Clio?�

&nbsp;

�Well�she is my sister!� he said and laughed. Isobel
was stunned for a few seconds and after a while she started laughing too. 

&nbsp;

Meanwhile Clio and Leah were really getting along
together. They had already drunk the bottle of wine and Leah had cornered Clio
kissing her passionately. She was between her legs and had her hands in Clio�s
ass. Clio had one hand one Leah�s neck and the other one on her left breast.
Both of them were feeling very horny and wanted to get more of each other but
Clio knew that it wasn�t possible in the bar. So she broke the kiss and looked
in Leah�s eyes.

&nbsp;

�Do you want to go somewhere else?� Leah didn�t answer
her in words; she kissed her again with even more passion this time. �Let�s
go.� She said and took her by her hand. They went over to Byron and Isobel. 

&nbsp;

�We are leaving Byron. Do you want to come?�

&nbsp;

�Where are you going?� he asked.

&nbsp;

�ODD� 

&nbsp;

�We�ll come!� answered Isobel suddenly which made
Byron and Clio laugh.� 

&nbsp;

�Then ODD it is!� said Byron and they left the bar.
They said goodbye to Frank and headed for the bikes.

&nbsp;

�Is it far from here?� asked Isobel.

&nbsp;

�No it�s not actually.� Replies Clio.

&nbsp;

�Then why can�t we walk there? It�s a beautiful night
and I just love this place!� she asked again. 

&nbsp;

�We�ll park the bikes outside of ODD and then we�ll go
for a walk if you want Isobel but I am not leaving them here. I don�t want to
keep Frank.� Answered Byron and Clio agreed with him. Isobel saw the point in
Byron�s words and agreed too. So they got on their bikes and after a minute of
riding they reached ODD club. The queue was really big and Leah was
disappointed because it would take at least half an hour to get inside. They
passed the crowd and stopped their bikes in front of the door. Isobel and Leah
got off the bikes and so did Byron and Clio leaving them unlocked. 

&nbsp;

�Aren�t you going to put a lock or a chain on them?�
asked Leah.

&nbsp;

�No one will touch them,� answered Clio without
noticing that Byron had turned his head and was looking at her.

&nbsp;

�Really? Why is that? Asked Leah again.

&nbsp;

�Because they belong to us!� answered Clio again but
now she was aware that Byron was starring at her. She knew that Byron didn�t
like her answer and tried to fix it. �And because Damian will look after them�
saying that she pointed at the doorman and Leah turned to see who that man was.


&nbsp;

Damian was much like Frank but not so big. He had long
black hair, a spiked collar on his neck, piercing rings on his eyebrows, spikes
on his ears and was dressed pretty much like a typical Goth. When he heard his
name he turned and looked at Clio, smiling and making a nod of agreement.� Clio turned and looked at Byron again.

&nbsp;

�We are going in. Will you go for a walk after all?�
she asked but Byron didn�t have the time to answer because Isobel did before
him.

&nbsp;

�I would really love to go for walk. We�ll catch up
with you later inside.� When she finished her sentence she looked at Byron
smiling wanting him to agree with her. He did and she kissed him saying thank
you. 

&nbsp;

�All right then, see you inside and behave!� said Clio
and took Leah�s hand to go inside. Isobel smiled, blushed a little, put her
hand on Byron�s waist and walked away from the club heading on the other
direction. 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

----- Chapter 5
-----

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Leah didn�t like the fact that she had to wait so long
to get inside and mentioned it to Clio.

&nbsp;

�Who said we are going to wait?� answered Clio and
Leah looked at her puzzled. She took her by her hand and walked to the door but
as they walked to the door they heard a female voice shouting at them.

&nbsp;

�Hey you, wait in line!� she was standing kind of far
and since and there were a lot of people in front of her, so she couldn�t
really tell who were those two women, but when Clio turned to see who had said
that she lost her speech. Clio walked towards her and everybody made a few
steps back to make her way. The girl that made that comment was shocked when
she realized to whom she had spoken in such a manner. She stood like a statue
and her face had a look of utter shame and remorse.� She took Clio�s hand in her own, kneeled and
bowed her head in the same time.

&nbsp;

�Forgive me
my lady.� Clio remained still but after a few seconds touched the girl�s head
with her other hand. The girl raised her head smiling and Clio turned to Leah
again who was quite puzzled by the whole scene. 

&nbsp;

What was going on? Who were these people? Why did that
girl treat her like that? Then she remembered how they treated Isobel and her
too. So she was true then. Byron and Clio were too very important people in
this part of town and their guests had to be treated the same way. They were
showing respect. Clio broke her train of thought when she kissed her in her
lips and took her hand to head for the door, which was opened before they had
asked it by Damian. They entered a small room that had very discrete lights and
were greeted by a petite and very beautiful girl not more than twenty years
old. She was wearing a black sleeveless dress that reached her ankles but also
had a very low cut in the front showing off a pair of wonderful breasts. On her
neck she was wearing a small leather collar with a silver ring in front and she
had her hair made in a ponytail high in the back of her head. She had a small
silver spike in each eyebrow and three in either ear. When she saw Clio she
bowed her head and lifted her dress a little while bending her knees, just how
Leah had seen women greeted royalties in medieval Europe in movies.

&nbsp;

�Good evening my lady. Can I take your coats please?�
she said as she raised her head. Clio took off her coat and so did Leah and
they hand them to her. She took them and hanged them in a closet. She turned,
smiled at them and opened a big door in front of them. As they walked through
it Clio gave her a small kiss on her lips and they entered the main area. 

&nbsp;

Leah had been in many clubs but that was something she
had never seen in her life. There was a big stage where people were dancing,
there were three bars and along the walls there were big couches. She noticed a
second floor but she couldn�t tell what was going on up there because she was
standing too low. She saw a lot of cages on the floor with naked women on their
hands and knees inside them that were in some kind of torment. There were
people spilling wax on them or spanking them with crops.� On the couches there were people kissing and
fondling and some of them were even fucking. There were a lot of half or full
naked people around and there was a TV wall opposite of them that had S-M
sessions on some of them pretty hardcore too. There were men and women tied
with chains or ropes to the walls and were getting whipped. Some others were
paddled on the couches or at the dance floor. At various occasions there were
queues behind the one that was being spanked. She felt Clio�s hand on her waist
and then her lips on her neck. When she felt her hand on her left breast she
turned and kissed her in the mouth. Leah put her left hand behind Clio�s neck
and her right one on her ass bringing her close. They didn�t break the kiss for
at least a minute and when they did, they were both trying to catch their
breaths. 

&nbsp;

�I am going to get a drink, what do you want?� asked
Clio.

&nbsp;

�Whatever you are having� she said smiling while
looking around the place. 

&nbsp;

�I�ll be back in no time!� said Clio, kissed Leah�s
lips once more, gave her a small slap on her ass and left.

&nbsp;

While she waited for Clio to come back with their
drinks she began to notice the other people that were already in the club. She
saw people dressed in a very fetish manner with chains and handcuffs on them,
she saw people holding small whips and riding crops, but there were also a lot
of Goth types and people dressed with clothes of past centuries. The important
thing though was that everybody seemed to have a lot of fun. As this thought
came in her mind she looked at a girl on her knees with her hands tied behind
her back that was getting fucked from behind by another woman with a strap-on
dildo while she was spanking her ass with a small paddle. After few seconds a
guy came in front of her, grabbed her hair and put his dick in her mouth.
�Yeah, definitely good time!� she said and felt a pair of familiar lips kissing
her neck. She turned and saw Clio smiling at her and holding a bottle of wine. 

&nbsp;

�I missed you.� She said smiling and kissed her full
in her lips while putting her hands on her beautiful ass. 

&nbsp;

Clio put her arms around Leah�s neck and they kept
kissing for a few more minutes. Leah had rested her hands inside Clio�s back
pockets and had moved her leg inside Clio�s. After a while she broke the kiss
gasping for air. Clio was smiling and took a big sip of the bottle of wine she
had taken from the bar. She gave the bottle to Leah who took it with her right
hand leaving her right inside Clio�s pocket. Leah was drinking when she felt
Clio�s right hand on her breasts and her lips on her neck, giving her a little
bite. Leah didn�t expect that and some of the wine came out of her mouth. Clio
broke the connection with her neck and licked the wine from Leah�s face and
when she had done that she kissed her again.�


&nbsp;

As they were kissing Clio took her hand from Leah�s
breasts and put it on top of her crotch. She felt her for a little while and
then she returned her lips to Leah�s neck. She was kissing, licking and sucking
her neck offering Leah wonderful sensations. Leah took another big sip from her
bottle and when her mouth was full she took her right hand from Clio�s ass and
grabbing her hair she pulled her head just a little. Then she put her lips in
Clio�s and kissed her. She managed to get some of the wine inside Clio�s mouth
but not all. The rest had fallen out of her lips and was running on her neck.
Seeing that Clio lowered her head and licked the wine off Leah�s neck. Her
tongue made Leah tremble and especially when she was feeling Clio�s mouth on
her neck. 

&nbsp;

As she was getting her neck licked she saw an empty
seat on a couch and taking Clio by her hand she almost dragged her there. She
made her sit down and then she sat on top of her throwing one leg on each
Clio�s side. She put a hand on her forehead and pushed her head back. She made
Clio open her mouth and poured wine in it. She kept drinking but at some point
she could take any more and closed her mouth causing some of it to run on her
chin and neck. Leah made the same thing for Clio, licking the wine from her
face and neck while Clio had her hands on Leah�s ass. When she finished licking
her she purred some more wine in Clio�s mouth and she drank some. After a while
they had finished the bottle and Leah had her left hand on Clio�s ponytail
holding her head back so it was easier for her to kiss her lips and her neck. She
was getting very horny and the fact that Clio was fondling with her breasts
made it even better. At some point Clio put her hands back on Leah�s ass but
this time she grabbed her and turned her body to the right bringing her on top
now. She put her right hand on Leah�s breasts and grabbed them applying some
strength in her grip but it wasn�t something Leah didn�t like. She had always
fantasized being controlled and not just that. The people that were also
sitting on the couch, left giving Clio and Leah more space to move so after a
while Clio put her hand on Leah�s waist, lifted her body a little and threw
flat on the couch. Leah smiled and spread her legs for Clio to come between
them, which of course she did. After about ten minutes of very intense kissing
and fondling Clio broke the kiss and looked Leah in her eyes.

&nbsp;

�Do you want to go upstairs?� asked Clio and Leah
agreed. 

&nbsp;

�Just give me a second to get something for us to
drink� saying that she kissed her again and left. 

&nbsp;

Leah walked among the crowd that had gotten quite
bigger since they headed for the couch and the club was really crowded by that
time. She moved around observing the various couples and the people that were
in ODD at that time and the sight made her even hornier that she already was.
At some point she thought she heard someone calling her and turned her head to
see who was that. She saw Isobel walking towards her with a huge smile in her
face. As she was moving towards her she saw many people moving aside to make a
path for her while bowing their heads and smiling. �I could really get used to
such treatment� she thought and smiled. After a while Isobel had reached her
spot and was hugging her. 

&nbsp;

�Hey Isobel, why did you come so early?� 

&nbsp;

�What? Do you know how long it�s been since we left?�
she said with a question in her face but then she noticed Clio�s messed
clothes, red cheeks and little marks on her neck. �But I can see that you�ve
been busy so you couldn�t have noticed it!� saying that she laughed causing
Leah to blush even more. 

&nbsp;

�Well it�s true, I didn�t stay empty handed,� she told
her back and now they both laughed. �So how was your walk?�

&nbsp;

�It was great. I am telling you this place it�s
fantastic. You have to see it.� 

&nbsp;

�Maybe tomorrow, but where is Byron?�

&nbsp;

�Oh yes, we saw Clio and she told us that she going to
get your drinks and he went with her. He told me to find you. I had the feeling
that he wanted to discuss with Clio about something so I let them alone.�

&nbsp;

�Such discretion my lady!� she said and bowing her
head laughed. They looked around for a while longer talking about the club and
what was going inside it. Neither of them had ever been in such a club although
they both had often toyed with the idea of BDSM. As they were looking around
Leah�s eyes fell on a man who was walking with a chain in his hand. After a
while she saw a girl following him walking on her hands and knees. She was very
beautiful and completely naked. The guy went over to a couch and when he sat
down he spread his legs and the girl came between them. He unbuttoned his
trousers, taking his dick out and she immediately leaned her head forward on
his crotch. Isobel had seen them too and now she was also looking at that
scene. Both girls were looking at them and their hands without even realizing
it had traveled to their breasts and pussies. After a while they felt a hand on
their asses in the same time and they turned. They saw a really big guy,
dressed in leather and looking at them with a grin in his eyes. 

&nbsp;

�Hey girls, do you want to have as much fun as they
are having?� he was looking at them in a very strange and annoying way. It was
easy to tell that he was drank but that was not an excuse to grab their asses. 

&nbsp;

�Keep your hands close you, you creep!� said Isobel
with a very angry face.

&nbsp;

�Oh really? Or else what will you do?� he said looking
at her in a very demeaning way.

&nbsp;

�Or else I am going to rip them of your body.� she was
quite angry with him. But his answer was not what she expected although she
didn�t know what to expect. He just laughed very loud causing many people to
turn to their direction. He kept on laughing for a few more seconds until
Isobel threw him a bottle of beer she grabbed from a guy beside her. It landed
on his head and he made a few steps back shaking his head a little. Isobel was
just trying to earn some more time until Byron�s return. But as it seemed she
wouldn�t have that much time. He moved forward and seemed furious.

&nbsp;

�You little slut! You are going to pay for this!� As
he said that he made a step forward and slapped her face hard throwing her to
the floor. Leah tried to hit him but received a slap in her face too. She fell
to the floor too but she quickly got up again something Isobel didn�t do. Leah
turned her face to Isobel and saw that she was still on the floor and seemed
unconscious. She then saw a stool that was beside her and realized that she had
hit her head. She run towards her took her head in her hands and she felt
something liquid on her hands. She knew it was blood before she even looked at
it. She turned her head towards him with as much hatred as she felt for her
rapists. He made a couple of steps towards her with an even stranger look that
frightened Leah. 

&nbsp;

Just when she was about to start screaming at him the
music stopped and a big spotlight fell on them. He looked around to see what
was going on. Everybody had stopped whatever they were doing and made a lot of
steps back leaving them in the middle of the club. 

&nbsp;

�You bastard; you are going to pay for this!� she
screamed at him while trying to bring Isobel back to her senses. 

&nbsp;

At that point she saw the crowd behind them opening up
and Byron with Clio walking towards them. She had never seen Byron�s eyes when
he was angry and the sight scared even her. He hadn�t noticed anything, at
least not until Byron was just a step behind him. He turned and looked at
Byron. 

&nbsp;

�Leah how is Isobel?� asked Byron with a very serious
voice. 

&nbsp;

�She is bleeding. She hit her head on the stool. She
is unconscious. I don�t know what to do.� She was happy the cavalry had arrived
but seeing Isobel still unconscious made her fear for the worst. She could
sense that she was breathing although very lightly but the bleeding hadn�t
stopped. �Come on Isobel, wake up. Please wake up. Don�t do this to me. Byron
is here. Do you hear me? Come on, wake up!� She was holding her head and
stroking her hair and her cheeks. She was weeping by now. She raised her head
and saw Byron nodding to Clio to go to her. When she reached the spot where
Isobel and Leah were, she kneeled and took Isobel�s head in her hands. She
leaned to Leah whispering in her ear that everything would be all right and
kissed her lips. Byron was still starring at him with eyes filled with anger.
Leah had never seen someone so angry in her life and she had no idea how this
would end. Her thoughts were interrupted by Isobel�s moans. She turned her head
immediately to Isobel. 

&nbsp;

�Are you all right? Can you talk? Do you know where
you are?�

&nbsp;

�My head! What happened?� she opened her eyes and
looked at Clio and Leah starring at her with a smile in their faces but also a
lot of concern. She turned her head towards her left and saw Byron with him.

&nbsp;

�Isobel, how are you feeling?� she heard Byron asking
her without taking his eyes of him.

&nbsp;

�Yeah, I am just great.� She tried to stand up but she
couldn�t and rested her head for a little while longer on Clio�s hands. �Ah you
bastard!� She said and brought her left hand to her forehead. 

&nbsp;

�Listen Byron�I don�t know why are you acting like
this�I didn�t try to�they are just a couple of mortals�� Byron didn�t let him
end his sentence; he grabbed him by the neck, lifted him up with just one hand
and threw him a few meters away. It was unbelievable! Leah had never seen
anything like that. That guy was really big and Byron threw him like a feather.
The guy stood up and moved towards Byron. 

&nbsp;

�I am getting tired of all your rules Byron.� 

&nbsp;

�If you don�t like them you are free to leave Ryan.
But if you want to remain here you will live by my rules or you won�t live at
all!� Byron sounded as decisive as ever and seeing him like that Ryan bowed his
head and left the club. Byron turned and headed to the girls.

&nbsp;

�How are you feeling Isobel?� he asked her. 

&nbsp;

�Better now that you are here.� She said smiling. �My
head aches terribly though.�

&nbsp;

�Well I think I can fix that.� Saying that he lowered
his head and kissed her lips. When he broke the kiss she saw Isobel smiling. 

&nbsp;

�Yeah, I am definitely better! Help me get up will
you?� she told and he did. 

&nbsp;

The second she was standing in her feet, the spotlight
was turned off and music filled the club again. Byron made her sit at a stool
for a few minutes while he stroked her hair. Byron turned his gaze at Leah to
ask her if she was all right too but seeing Clio all over her, he knew she was
in good hands and didn�t say anything. After a while Isobel stood up and tried
to walk a little. She did and after a few steps she pretended to faint and fell
in Byron�s arms smiling. Clio told Byron to go upstairs and he agreed. He
lifted her like a child and they walked to the opposite wall towards a red
velvet curtain in front of which was a really big guy. When he saw them he
smiled, bowed his head a little and made a step to the right allowing them to
go through the curtain. There was a long staircase with red carpet and after a while
they were on the second floor. The first thing Leah noticed was that there were
considerably less people in it. All the waitresses were very beautiful but
completely naked except from collars on their necks just like the one that girl
at the front door was wearing. They were serving drinks to the men and women
that were sitting on the couches and were pleasing them with their tongues.
There were other girls that were kneeling on the floor waiting to be called
upon. Leah saw naked girls walking on all fours while men and women were
holding them by a chain that was attached in the ring of their collars and got
into rooms. She did feel rather horny with all that she was seeing. Maybe all
the alcohol she had drunk had something to do with that even though she did
always fantasize about it. She would often dream herself being tied in bed or
in a wall and someone spanking her and then making her come and when she first
saw Clio she knew she wanted her to be that person. As they were walking
everybody would stop what they were doing and bowed their heads and the naked
girls would smile as much as they could and touch the floor with their
foreheads, obviously as a sign of respect. They walked to a black door with a
big silver C on it. It was obviously her private room or maybe her playroom,
thought Leah. Clio opened it and they walked inside.

&nbsp;

It was a very big room with a king size bed, a rather
large closet and a fireplace. There were many small lamps on the walls that
provided enough light to the place giving it a nice atmosphere. Leah walked in
the room for a little bit, Clio went over to the fireplace to start a fire
while Byron went over to the bed and let Isobel on it. She smiled at him and he
kissed her. After a few seconds there was a beautiful fire that provided heat
and more light to the room. Leah went over to Isobel and sat at her side
stroking her hair. She was glad it all had ended without anyone getting hurt
but there were some things that kept spinning in her head. Clio saw that there
was something bothering her and asked her about it.

&nbsp;

�You know�I thought people here were different.� She
said with a sigh. 

&nbsp;

�They are quite different Leah.� Said Byron �but you
see, there is a pig in every forest.� As he was talking he never took his eyes
of the fire.

&nbsp;

�He was really scary. And I know he was drunk but he
said some things that were very strange.� 

&nbsp;

When she said that both Byron and Clio turned their
faces and looked at her, waiting for her next question. 

&nbsp;

�What do you mean?� asked Clio.

&nbsp;

�Well, when he saw Isobel�s blood in my hand I swear
there was a glimpse in his eyes. And then he said to you Byron that we were a
couple of mortals! And what did he mean about your rules? And then you said
that if he didn�t like them he could leave or else he wouldn�t live.� There
were some seconds of unbearable silence until Leah talked again. �I understood
from the beginning that this place is different and you have some kind of
authority over these people here, but I would really like to know what is going
on.� When Leah said that Isobel moved her body upwards and sat with her back on
her headboard making a nod that she wanted to find out too. Byron looked at
Clio and they walked towards the other side of the room. 

&nbsp;

�It�s not how I had planned it, but I guess it is time
to tell you about us.� Said Byron and he continued.

&nbsp;

�Do you remember about the little bottle I gave you
Leah?� asked Byron and she nodded that she remembered. �What did you think of
its taste?�

&nbsp;

�Well�I thought it tasted like blood actually.�
Answered Leah.

&nbsp;

�And you Isobel?� Byron caught her off guard. It
seemed to her that somehow he knew what had happened to their room and it was
hopeless to lie to him so he gave him the same answer. 

&nbsp;

�And what did you think about it? Did you feel
disgusted, sick, repelled�or did you like it?� he was looking right in their
eyes now and so was Clio. Leah and Isobel looked at each other for just a
second and a guilty smile appeared in their faces.

&nbsp;

�Please don�t think that we are a couple of weird
people but�we liked it.� Saying that Isobel blushed and so did Leah. What they
didn�t see though was the relief on Byron and Clio.

&nbsp;

�Don�t feel bad that you liked it Isobel. After all
that�s what it was!� When Byron said that both girls raised their heads and
looked at him, then at each other and they both laughed. They thought he was
making a joke at them but after a while when they saw that neither Byron nor
Clio were laughing they stopped and turned very serious. 

&nbsp;

�You are not joking, are you Byron?� asked Leah and
she received a nod from Clio saying that he wasn�t.� �Oh my god! You gave me blood? And I drank
it!� she couldn�t believe it and neither could Isobel. But for some strange
reason she wasn�t angry with him. She stood up from the bed and walked a little
without saying anything. 

&nbsp;

�The idea of drinking blood should make me feel sick
but it doesn�t. And it would be really stupid of me to start yelling about it
since I told you a couple of minutes ago that I liked it.� Saying that Leah
stopped talking for a few seconds trying to pick her next words very careful.
�I don�t know if it is important or not, but where did that blood come from?�
she surely didn�t want to be a rat�s blood or something like that. 

&nbsp;

�Half Byron�s and half mine.� Answered Clio making
both girls more confused.

&nbsp;

�What? Your blood?� This was really getting
unbelievable thought Leah. �Although it sounds very noble and romantic to give
me your blood, but how did you know that it would help me?� Leah thought that
she was handling it very calmly considering the things she was hearing.

&nbsp;

�We are very special creatures Leah.� Answered Byron.

&nbsp;

�I am beginning to understand that now, but what is so
different about you?� asked Leah. Byron hesitated for a little but then he
spoke.

&nbsp;

�We are vampires.� When Leah heard that she felt a
knot in her stomach and she could bet Isobel was feeling the same too. Isobel
hadn�t moved from where she was sitting but she was still as a statue. 

&nbsp;

�So now we are vampires too?� asked Leah.

&nbsp;

�No, you are not my love� said Clio and tried to make
a step forward but seeing Leah�s eyes widen she stopped and made a step
backwards instead. �Only if a vampire bites you, will you become one. Just like
in the movies� when she said that she smiled; trying to lighten the atmosphere
a bit but the only thing she gained was a hint of a smile in Isobel�s face.
After all she had tasted but a few drops when she kissed Leah. Leah was a lot
more concerned about the whole thing. 

&nbsp;

�So what are the side effects of this?� asked Isobel.

&nbsp;

�There are no side effects.� Answered Byron. �Her body
was healed and so was her spirit. It was a medicine for both her body and her
soul.� About half a minute of deafening silence took place but then a small
laugh came out of Isobel�s mouth. It was like they were making a joke and she
had understood it. 

&nbsp;

�Nice acting from both of you, I give you that.� Byron
and Clio looked at her puzzled. �If you are vampires as you say you are�then
how can you face the light?� She knew she had them with that one. She didn�t
know about Clio but Byron was attending the university and the courses were
taking place in daylight. Byron smiled at her satisfied with her question; it
was like he was proud of her. 

&nbsp;

�Well my little Isobel�It is true that vampires can�t
face the light. But I am not a common vampire. I am a vampire of pure blood
-both my parents were vampires- but I was born before I reached nine months. My
father was a doctor and had to perform a Caesarian section to take me out. When
I was four years old I got out of the house by accident in the daylight and it
didn�t kill me. Neither my parents nor the Council of the Elders could
understand it.� (2)

&nbsp;

Isobel was looking right in his eyes as he was talking
and could see that he wasn�t lying. He had never lied to her before. Somehow it
made sense. She turned her head and looked at Leah. She was leaning against the
wall remaining absolutely still. Her eyes were moving like they had a mind of
their own though. It was easier for Isobel to accept something like this; she
had always been intrigued and fond of stories about strange things and myths
like elves and dwarfs, goblins and haunted forests, fairies and vampires. She
often wished about living in dreamy places with such creatures, among witches
and animals that could talk. But Leah was quite different. She didn�t know how
she would take this. So she decided to start asking as many questions about
them as she could, so Leah would be a little more relaxed if she knew more
about them. 

&nbsp;

�So Byron, you can face the light, but what about
Clio? You are his sister, can you face the light?�

&nbsp;

�No, I cannot� answered Clio. �I am not Byron�s true sister;
his parents found me the night I was bitten. They felt sorry for me, they took
care of me and finally they adopted me. I owe them my life. I would have died
if it wasn�t for them.�

&nbsp;

�So how long
it�s been since you faced the sun for the last time?� asked Leah making
everybody happy she was participating again.

&nbsp;

�The last time I saw the light I was 22 years old, 208
years ago in Berlin.� When she said that, both Isobel and Leah looked at her,
totally surprised. �Don�t look at me like that� said Clio. �Didn�t you know
that vampires are immortals?� 

&nbsp;

�Yes I know� said Isobel �but still it is incredible
to be with someone who is 230 years old. Her remark made Clio laugh and Byron
smile but she couldn�t understand where the joke was. �Why are you laughing?�
Byron turned his gaze to the fire again and Clio made a nod to Isobel to ask
Byron�s age.

&nbsp;

�Byron?� she said and he turned. �How old are you?� 

&nbsp;

�I was born in Edinburgh�in 1486.� His answer left
Isobel and Leah with open mouths. After the shock had passed, they laughed. It
was not because they had found it funny; it was more like a nervous laugh. All
the tension of the situation had turned into laughter and they kept laughing
for a few minutes. 

&nbsp;

�Oh my god� said Isobel trying to stop laughing. �I�ve
been making out with someone that�s over five centuries old!� Her words brought
another series of laughter. 

&nbsp;

With all the laughing that was going on, it seemed to
Clio a good idea to try and move closer to them but Leah got scared again and
tried to make an escape to the door. Clio was disappointed and stopped. She
turned her back and went to the opposite corner of the room and sat on a chair.
She had a look of sadness on her face. She was feeling abandoned by Leah and
Isobel could sense that. She turned to Leah and looked at her but her eyes told
her that she was afraid, she didn�t mean to offend anyone, most of all Clio,
but she was just too afraid. She wasn�t used to this. Vampires were never in
her dreams. The whole thing was way out of her field. Isobel tried to open a
subject that would make her focus on something else. 

&nbsp;

�Are you the only vampires here?� she asked.

&nbsp;

�No� said Byron. �From the people you�ve met, Frank
and Damian are also vampires but there are other too.�

&nbsp;

�Is Ryan a vampire?� Byron nodded for agreement.

&nbsp;

�He said that he was tired of living by your rules. It
wasn�t difficult to understand that everybody is treating you and Clio �and us
too- like some kind of leaders. What is this all about? Did they elect you as a
leader?�

&nbsp;

�We didn�t have to elect him as a leader� said Clio
before Byron had the time to answer. �Byron is the oldest, strongest and wisest
vampire here. He is the most respected vampire after the Council of the Elders.
We all love and respect Byron and we live by his rules.�

&nbsp;

�Obviously not everyone is happy about Byron�s rules�
said Isobel.

&nbsp;

�Ryan is a fool who�s gone too far. Byron didn�t try
to make anyone stay against his will. They are free to come and go as they
please. But every vampire that comes here knows the rules�and the penalty.� 

&nbsp;

�We�ll get to that, but first what�s the Council of
the Elders? Obviously is something like the highest chain of command, but when
you say Elders, what are we talking about exactly?� asked Isobel.

&nbsp;

�To enter the Council one must be of pure blood and
over a thousand years old.� Said Byron.

&nbsp;

�What? Oh boy� said Isobel smiling. �What are your
rules and what�s the penalty?� when she made her question Clio spoke again.

&nbsp;

�We do not draw attention in our community and our
kind. A lot of vampires have died because they were careless. We live in peace
with each other and with mortals. The penalty for abusing mortals or vampires
is exile. No one will ever bite a human against his will. The penalty for that
is death.�

&nbsp;

�I thought it was in your nature to kill� said Leah in
a bitter way that even made Isobel feel bad. Byron turned his face and looked
at her. 

&nbsp;

�Is that what you think Leah?� she didn�t answer and
Byron didn�t take his eyes of her while Clio�s disappointment was getting
bigger. 

&nbsp;

�She didn�t mean it like that�� tried to say Isobel to
cover her friend�s insult to Byron and Clio.

&nbsp;

�Then what the hell did she mean?� said Clio and then
turned to Leah. �Have you forgotten already how many times Byron saved your
life? Did you forget tomorrow�s fight for you?� She was talking in an angry
tone now that was not at all pleasant, but maybe she had every right to be
angry, thought Isobel. �I cannot believe this.� She said and stood up. There
were a few moments of silence. �We even gave you our blood!� Byron nodded her
to calm down and she tried to obey him. Leah was sitting on the floor with
tears in her eyes by now.

&nbsp;

She had offended them and she knew it. She was feeling
awful but couldn�t help it. She was just a simple person. She wasn�t like
Isobel. She wasn�t into these things. She was scared although she shouldn�t be.
Clio and mostly Byron had protected and defended her. She had seen the sorrow
in his eyes when they were in their room. He would take revenge for her. Clio�s
last words were racing in her head. �We even gave you our blood� she didn�t
know much about vampires but she was certain that blood was something
important. 

&nbsp;

�I am sorry�� she managed to say in a low voice
between tears. �I didn�t mean to hurt you� she felt Isobel kneeling next to her
and stroking her hair. She turned and dropped her head in Isobel�s arms. She
was crying openly now begging them to forgive her. She couldn�t see Isobel�s
eyes or her face pleading them to forgive her. She felt Isobel stroking her
hair for a little while longer and then she felt another hand on her head. She
raised her head and saw Byron. He brushed the tears from her cheeks offering
his smile to soothe her. 

&nbsp;

�It is not easy to fight your own nature, especially
for someone like me. It was the only way I knew to survive; as for Clio�she was
never given a choice. She was attacked and left for dead.� When she heard Byron
saying that Leah turned her head and looked at Clio. She had her back on her
and was leaning against a wall. �I understand that you are scared Leah. But be
assured that neither of you will be harmed here.� 

&nbsp;

Clio had still her back at them and wasn�t talking.
Leah felt forgiven by Byron but she had to be forgiven by her too. After all,
Clio was the one she wanted. She stood up and walked over to her. She stayed
behind her, motionless, without talking, waiting for her to turn. Byron took
Isobel�s hand in his own and kissed her passionately. He was happy she
understood and she wasn�t afraid of him. He was right about her and the choice
he made about telling her. Leah on the other hand was an entirely different
situation but he could sense the change in her attitude towards them. He
whispered something in Isobel�s ear and she nodded yes. He smiled, kissed her
and opened the door to leave. 

&nbsp;

�We are going to leave now. We have a lot to talk
about�and so do you� he said and left the room. 

&nbsp;

Leah was still standing behind Clio without speaking
or moving. Some more minutes passed in such manner until Clio turned and their
eyes met. She gave her a cold look. She was still angry with her and Leah felt
her knees betraying her. Clio walked away from her and sat on the bed. Leah
stayed leaning against the wall for a couple of minutes more and then she
turned. She looked directly at Clio�s eyes and tried to walk over there but
when she saw that she turned her gaze to the fireplace she stopped. 

&nbsp;

�I am sorry Clio�I shouldn�t have said that�I am sorry
but�� she tried to say.

&nbsp;

�I didn�t expect that from you Leah. I thought you
were special�like Isobel.� Her words felt like razorblades in her heart. �I
know it�s been a big shock to you, but to consider us your enemies was really
something terrible to think of.� Clio continued. 

&nbsp;

�Please let�s just forget it�let�s continue from where
we left downstairs. Remember? We were having a good time, didn�t we?� she said
smiling while making small steps towards Clio. 

&nbsp;

�Yes, we were� she said smiling back. �I am sorry
Leah, maybe I overreacted. Since Byron didn�t seem to mind much, why should I?�
She gave her a look of invitation, which she accepted. She moved to the bed
with fast steps. They stayed like that without doing anything. Then they raised
their heads.

&nbsp;

Their eyes met and both of them had a look of total
lust. Clio spread her legs and Leah walked to her side. When she was between
Clio�s legs she stopped. She was still looking in her eyes. She took of her
shirt and threw it behind her. Clio helped her take off her boots. Then she
unbuttoned her trousers leaving them on though. Clio put her hand on Leah�s ass
and moved her face forward. She kissed her navel softly and then kissed her a
little lower. Leah�s heart was beginning to beat faster. Clio put her hands
inside Leah�s trousers and pulled them down slowly enjoying Leah�s soft skin as
she passed her hands on her legs. Leah raised her feet and after a few seconds
she was standing in her underwear in front of Clio that had her hands on Leah�s
ass now. Leah took off her bra too while Clio helped her get out of her thong.
She was planting small kisses on Leah�s thighs and then she went up and kissed
her navel and then returned to her pussy. Leah took Clio�s head in her hands
and kissed her and she pushed her to lie on the bed. She took her boots off and
then she went for her trousers. She unbuttoned it and then lay on top of her.
She kissed her again but now she was also touching her breasts while Clio was
feeling her ass. Leah broke the kiss and put her hands inside Clio�s trousers
and on her ass feeling her a little and after that she began to lower her hands
taking her trousers off. When Leah had Clio�s trousers in her hands she was
kneeling but after she had tossed it behind she remained there. Clio raised her
body and looked at her. She was on her knees, between her legs and wasn�t
moving. 

&nbsp;

Clio took of her leather top and saw Leah�s eyes
filling with lust when she saw her breasts. Clio stood up and went to a closet
leaving Leah still kneeling on the floor. She took something out and told Leah
to go to her. Leah did but without standing up, she went over there on her hand
and knees. Clio was holding a three-inch wide leather collar with a big silver
ring in front and the letter C on each side. She buckled it around Leah�s neck.
Then Clio took the band from Leah�s hair letting them fall on her shoulders. 

&nbsp;

�This band, which bound thy yellow hair,

Is mine, sweet girl! Thy pledge of love;

It claims my warmest, dearest care,

Like relics left of saints above. 

&nbsp;

Oh! I will wear it next my heart;

It will bind my soul to thee;

From me again it will never depart,

But mingle in the grave with me.������ (3)

&nbsp;

She tied the band around her neck and kissed Leah.

&nbsp;

��I�ll always
wear this.� While she said that she extended her hands ordering Leah to take
them, which she did. She put them on her ass and left them there for a few
seconds and then spread her legs. After that she put her hands on the hem of
her thong and with one swift motion she ripped it off her body. Leah didn�t
take her hands of Clio�s ass and when she saw that she leaned forward and
kissed her pussy. Clio put her hands on Leah�s head and began stroking her hair
enjoying the feeling of her tongue on her pussy. Leah was exploring Clio�s
pussy while she was feeling her wonderful ass. She wasn�t moving; she was still
on her knees and wasn�t going to move until she was ordered to but kept licking
Clio�s pussy and fondling her ass but with a more intense rhythm. Clio was
stroking Leah�s hair but was also keeping her head in the same place. The fact
that Leah�s zeal on what she was doing kept getting bigger and bigger brought
Clio after a while close to an orgasm which she reached in a few seconds when
Leah focused on her clit for a minute. Leah didn�t take her mouth of Clio�s
pussy until she told her so. Holding her by her hair she raised her to her feet
and kissed her lips. Then she let her rest on her knees again. 

&nbsp;

Clio opened the closet and took out a pair of black
leather gloves that Leah put on. They were long enough to cover her elbows and
had very small rings on them. Leah saw Clio taking a black cord and walking
behind her. She felt Clio passing the cord through the upper rings on her
elbows and then crossing them on each ring she reached the last ones where she
tied a knot. Now her hands were tied behind her back but since her elbows were
so close together it made her thrust her breasts forward. Clio leaned backwards
against the closet and nodded Leah to come closer, which she did still on her
knees. Clio put her hands through her hair and grabbing two fistfuls brought
Leah�s head to her pussy, almost shoving her mouth on it. Leah went for it
again but now she aimed directly for Clio�s clit. With her hands tied behind
her back it was a little awkward for her but it also made her hornier too. Clio
was getting more dominative while Leah was getting more submissive. After a
while Clio put her left hand on her breast trying to give more pleasure to
herself. She was still grabbing Leah�s hair with her right hand though and with
that kept giving her the rhythm she wanted. When she was on the verge of coming
again she used the grip she had on Leah�s hair to push her off her pussy. Leah
looked at her puzzled. Clio kept her head just a few inches from her pussy
feeling Leah�s hot breath on it. 

&nbsp;

Clio took a step forward bringing her pussy over
Leah�s head, which she raised while throwing it backwards and put her tongue on
Clio�s pussy. The position and the angle of her head were really painful for
what she was doing but she didn�t complain. She kept sucking and licking Clio�s
clit. After a while Clio couldn�t hold back again and came for the second time.
Again Leah remained in contact with the pussy until she was told otherwise. For
the second time she had tasted Clio�s juices and she was feeling better each
time. Clio moved her body off Leah and made a step back looking directly at
Leah�s eyes. She saw submission, lust and�love? She
smiled and putting her right index finger in the ring of her collar she raised
her to her feet. She kissed her full on the lips while she felt her ass. She
put her right leg inside Leah�s legs spreading them a little and her left hand
behind her neck while her right hand remained on her ass. She kept kissing her
as passionately as she could and she spread her legs even more. Her hands never
left their grip on her ass and her neck and she started moving forward without
breaking her kiss. After a few steps they fell on the bed. 

&nbsp;

Clio was taking control now and she was moving her
pussy back and forth on Leah�s. Clio had also gone more courageous; she had put
her middle finger in her ass pressing it deep and bringing her closer to her.
Leah�s heartbeat was going really fast now and she was certain her moans could
be heard outside of the room. The friction of the two pussies accompanied by
Clio�s finger in her ass and her passionate kiss that was still going on were
bringing her close to an orgasm. She was moving her own body faster and had
moved her legs behind Clio�s body locking her there. At some point Clio moved her
finger from her ass, which brought a moan of disappointment from Leah, but
after a couple of seconds she inserted it in her pussy. Leah was getting closer
and closer. Clio had inserted the index finger inside her pussy too and was
fucking her with them while she used her thumb on her clit. Leah tried to hold
back as much as she could but Clio�s pace was getting faster. She was seconds
from an orgasm when suddenly Clio stopped. Leah was shocked. She couldn�t leave
her like this. She was pleading her with her eyes. Clio raised her body and
looked at her but she did nothing. Leah tried to move her to get some pleasure
from the friction but she couldn�t succeed anything. When she saw Clio lifting
her body and getting of the bed she was rally disappointed. Why was she doing
this? She went close to the fireplace. Leah saw the sweat on her body; she was
enjoying it like she was. Then she walked to the door, opened it and after a
while two more girls came inside. 

&nbsp;

They were two very beautiful girls that she had seen
kneeling on the floor when were walking to get into the room. They came to her
and helped her get up. She had no idea what was going on. When Leah saw Clio
again she had put her boots on and was wearing a thong and a black silk robe.
One girl disappeared behind her while the other one was standing in front of
her. She felt her hands being untied and set loose and the girl in front her
unbuckled the collar from her neck. She was shocked! Had she done something
wrong? Had she disappointed her? She wasn�t worth it? When the gloves were off
her hands the girls walked over to Clio and kneeled behind her, one on each
side. Leah was standing a few steps from them, naked and puzzled. She didn�t
know what she should do. She kept staring at Clio waiting for her order, but
she received none. She waited for a few minutes and then she saw Clio taking
the band from her neck and giving it to the girl on her left. That was the last
thing she could handle, she fell to her knees and started crying. 

&nbsp;

�Why are you doing this to me? I tried as best as I
could. Please don�t send me away, I�ll try harder, I know I can learn how to
please you. Please I want to stay with you.� 

&nbsp;

She was pleading and crying by now and didn�t see the
girl with the band on her hands coming behind her and using it as a blindfold
on her. She was surprised but she didn�t do anything. She felt another pair of
hands on her that helped her stand up. She heard a sound like a chain passing
through a ring that came above her head but again she didn�t do anything. She
didn�t want to upset Clio. She felt her hands being tied to leather handcuffs
and getting raised high above her head. She was standing on her toes now. After
that she felt the same thing on her ankles. Then she felt her legs being spread
and lifted at least half a meter above the floor. She was left like that for
about half a minute although it seemed like a century to her. Then she heard
the closet opening and then closing again. She felt a feather touching her
breasts. The sensation was electrifying! She didn�t know who was doing that but
it felt great whatsoever. The feather traveled from one breast to another and
then to the nipples and that lasted for five minutes. While she had the feather
on her breasts someone else started blowing on her back. She started from her
neck and descended along her spine with very small moves. When the blows
reached her tailbone it came up again. Then she felt the feather traveling down
and after it had passed her navel it moved to her pussy. Whoever was holding it
really knew what she was doing. Leah was ready to explode. The fact that she
was feeling blows on her ass helped too. She felt the feather traveling to the
inner parts of her thighs and by now she was beginning to tremble. The feather
came back to her pussy and stayed there for a minute, so did the blowing in her
ass. Then she felt nothing, they had stopped, leaving her alone again. She had
to feel them again but another five minutes had gone without feeling or hearing
anything.

&nbsp;

Then she heard light steps on the carpet and two
tongues touching her nipples. Her heart began to beat faster again. They were
lightly licking her nipples for a minute or two until she heard a sound that
could only be a whip on bare flesh. She heard a light moan and then the two girls
start biting her nipples. The bites were getting stronger as the time passed
but it wasn�t something unbearable, it was very erotic. Clio whipped again one
of the girls and they stopped biting. Now they were just French-kissing her
nipples. That lasted for two more minutes and Leah was having the time of her
life. Another whipping sound was heard and they stopped kissing her. They moved
back and left her for a minute. 

&nbsp;

Then she heard someone walk behind her. She felt
someone passing a leather glove over her back and ass and the same thing over
her breasts and pussy. They continued the caressing with the gloves for a few
more minutes and then at exactly the same time they spanked her breasts and her
ass with them.� They were gentle the
first time but as they kept spanking her the hits became stronger and stronger.
The girl behind her spanked her left cheek then her right moving in every
possible direction while the same was happening at her pussy too. The pain was
becoming stronger but so was the pleasure. After about twenty strokes she felt
tongues licking the part she had been spanked at causing her to tremble again.
When the girls were licking her Clio was whipping her breasts. Again she was
receiving pain and pleasure together. 

&nbsp;

When Clio stopped whipping her, the two girls went
back on spanking her with the gloves. After a while they ceased the spanking
and fell on their knees to lick and kiss the spots they had been spanking and
that was the time when Clio was coming back with her whip. This sequence happened
for once more. Leah�s heartbeat was going wild by now and Clio let her relax
for a little. Leah heard the closet (or maybe the door?) opening and closing
again. She was left alone for a few more seconds and then she felt two hands
spreading her ass cheeks and a tongue licking her asshole. She felt two more
hands spreading her pussy lips and a tongue trying to explore her pussy. She
was in heaven again but she was also expecting to experience some kind of pain,
but she didn�t. Instead she felt a tongue licking her left nipple and then
another aiming for her right one. She got a little uncomfortable, just for a
second by the fact that she was tied and naked in front of at least five people
but then she lost herself again to the pleasure she was receiving. The tongues
kept working on her body and she was just a few seconds from the point of no
return when suddenly she was left alone again. She couldn�t stand that anymore.
Just when she was about to cum Clio would stop everything and she was left
there hanging. 

&nbsp;

After a few seconds she felt being spanked again.
Every girl spanked the spot she had licked before with a pace and strength that
was getting more intense by each stroke. After five minute the girls were
spanking her in such a manner she thought she was sitting on an electric chair.
She couldn�t hold back anymore and started screaming. Pain and pleasure hit her
again but now it was more pain than pleasure. The girls kept spanking Leah for
a few more minutes and then suddenly they stopped leaving her alone. She heard
Clio ordering her to open her mouth, which she did. She felt something being
inserted in her mouth that seemed like a rubber ball and then being fastened
behind her head. Maybe she shouldn�t have screamed she thought and did the only
thing she could do, wait. She didn�t have to wait for long though. Soon enough
she felt the same four tongues paying attention on the same spots as they did
before but now it didn�t last as long. It had been only a minute of licking
when they took their tongues off her body and went back on spanking her. But
they began with the strength they had finished the last session and they kept
going harder and harder. After a while the girl that was spanking her ass
grabbed her hair too and pulled them backwards offering more pain. The pleasure
was long gone. Now it was simple pain. She had dreamed about this too.
Sometimes she had dreamt of being totally helpless and tortured by a lot of
people but it had to be with her own will, like now. She was brought back to reality
when the girl that was kneeling in front of her focused on hitting her clit.
The girls that were spanking her breasts pinched and twisted for a little her
nipples and then they all began spanking her as hard as they could. Leah
couldn�t hold back anymore and started screaming even though her voice couldn�t
be heard because of the gag, but it seemed that Clio realized it and ordered
the girls to stop and leave her alone.

&nbsp;

The next thing that happened was that they removed her
blindfold and the ball gag. She looked around and saw Clio still wearing her
boots, her thong and her robe and holding the whip. She saw the girls coming
towards her and two of them kneeled and freed her legs. She moved them a little
to help the blood circulate better and then the other two girls took off her
handcuffs. She did the same with her hands. Leah remained still, waiting for
Clio�s order. Her face was red and so her body from all the spanking. She
needed an orgasm fast but she didn�t say anything. 

&nbsp;

�Undress me Leah� she heard Clio in a tone that
sounded like an order. Leah fell on her hands and knees and went to her. When
she reached her feet she took her left foot and lifted it resting it on her
thighs. She leaned front and kissed her boot and then took it off. She kissed her
bare foot and put it back on the floor. She did the same with her right foot.
Then she saw Clio�s right hand giving her the whip. She raised her head and
took it with her mouth. Then she untied the knot in Clio�s robe and going
behind her pulled it off her body. She folded it as nicely as she could and put
it on a chair. Then she came back in front of Clio. When she tried to rise her
hands to pull her thong down she felt Clio slapping them hard. Leah was
shocked. What had she done wrong? Clio looked at her with an angry look and
Leah�s eyes could only say that they were sorry. But as it seemed that wasn�t
enough. Clio took the whip from Leah�s mouth and made two steps back looking at
her with despise. Leah�s heart was broken. She had done something wrong and she
had ruined it again. Her eyes filled with tears and leaned forward and fell on
the floor in front of Clio�s feet. She was holding and kissing them. 

&nbsp;

�Please don�t leave me, I am sorry.� Leah was crying
too.

&nbsp;

�You disappointed me.� Clio�s voice was very serious.

&nbsp;

�I�ll try again. Just give one more chance.�� 

&nbsp;

�I already gave you a second chance, remember?� 

&nbsp;

�Yes I know, I am a fool but I know I can do better
than that. I just didn�t know what you expected me to do and�� she was talking
and kissing Clio�s feet in the same time trying to make her forgive whatever
mistake she had made. But before she had time to finish her last sentence Clio
lifted her feet and walked away from Leah. 

&nbsp;

�Then it seemed that I made a mistake listening to
Byron. He told me that he had found the one for him and for me. I can see now
that only Isobel is worth it.� She stopped for a few seconds and Leah kept on
crying. �I was looking for a girl who would know what I wanted and she wouldn�t
need for me to tell her. I was looking for a girl to have her beside me and to
present her to my world as my other half. As it seems you are not what I am
looking for.� Clio�s words sounded as cold and cruel as they could be. Leah
crawled to Clio�s feet again and kissed them again. 

&nbsp;

�I know I can be that girl, if you let me. Let�s do it
all over again, I don�t mind. Tie me to the wall, spank me with the gloves whip
my breasts and my pussy and my ass. I don�t mind. All I want is to please you
and to be with you. Please give one more chance!� she was crying and kissing
Clio�s feet and was holding them so firmly that she couldn�t get away. 

&nbsp;

Leah felt Clio�s whip landing on her left ass cheek
and although it surprised her she didn�t make a sound. She was holding Clio�s
left foot and was kissing it. Then the whip hit her right cheek and then the
left again and then the right again and that lasted for about five minutes.
During that Leah didn�t make a single sound but kept kissing Clio�s foot. Clio
didn�t do anything for about a minute but Leah kept on kissing her foot. She
heard light footsteps and felt her body being drowned from the object of her
lust. She tried to hold on but the thought of her throwing her down, made her
let Clio�s feet. The girls kept pulling her body by her feet on the carpet and
that made her nipples feel quite sore after they had stopped. Right now she was
at the middle of that big room and still hadn�t lifted herself from the floor.
She wasn�t going to move unless Clio had told her so. They put a blindfold to
her again and a small collar but not the one Clio had given to her at the
beginning. She heard a �click� and after a while she understood that they had
attached a chain on the ring. She made her raise her body and now she was
standing on her hand and knees. Someone picked the chain and started walking
around making Leah follow her. For all she knew that was her last chance and
she wasn�t going to do whatever she was told to. She was made to move a little
further probably just for a proof of her obedience. The one that was holding
the chain pulled it up just enough to make her body stand straight. When she
was standing on her feet again they put the ball gag on and a girl told her to
remain still. If she was going to move just a little they would drop the whole
thing, put her in a car and send her back to the dorm house. 

&nbsp;

She was told to spread her legs and she did as much as
she could. The four girls spanked her with the gloves as they had done before.
They started with slow and light strokes but with each stroke the pace and the
strength were getting more intense. They kept spanking her for almost ten
minutes but she didn�t move a muscle. After that, they let her relax a little
and then they took off the ball gag. This time the rule was she wasn�t aloud to
speak too. But the game had changed. Her pussy was spanked with a glove, her
breasts with riding crops and on her ass they used a paddle. She had no
experience with paddles before and not much with the riding crop but she
managed to pull through. When they were done Leah was fighting to hide her
trembling as much as she could and she wished that they hadn�t noticed it. They
let her relax again for a little while and then she felt her collar going off.
The blindfold came off again and she was left wandering what had happened. One
of the girls came in front her and looked at her.

&nbsp;

�Don�t think we didn�t see you tremble� she stopped
talking wanting to see Leah�s reaction and was happy to see the disappointment
in her eyes. �But lady Clio is too generous and forgave you.� Leah�s face was
lit. �You have one last chance.� She said while two girls put the gloves back
on Leah�s hands and tied them tight with the cord. The girl in front of her
made her kneel again and then backed off. 

&nbsp;

Leah on her knees, walked over to Clio that was
wearing her thong and was holding her whip in her hand. When Leah was five
steps away, Clio nodded her to stop and she did. She raised her whip and hit
her left breast and then lifted her hand back in the air and hit her right
breast. She kept whipping her breasts for two minutes. Meanwhile Leah remained
still and most of all silent. Her eyes were filled with tears though from the
pain but she knew she had to hold on. When Clio stopped she made a nod at Leah
to proceed. Leah walked on her knees for the rest of the distance and when she
reached Clio�s feet she dropped her head forward and kissed her right foot for
a whole minute and then did the same to her left one. But she wasn�t just
kissing or licking Clio�s feet. She was worshiping her. She was trying to make
Clio forgive whatever mistake she had made. After all she was some kind of
leader in these parts and she saw how everybody else treated her. And of course
she couldn�t forget the fact that she had saved her life that night. She kept
worshiping Clio when she felt the whip landing on her ass again and again and
again for at least five more minutes. Leah was one step before screaming when
the whipping stopped. Clio ordered one girl to untie Leah�s hands and after a
few seconds Leah was still on her hands and knees in front of Clio.

&nbsp;

�Undress me� she heard the same order again and
thought of what she should do. 

&nbsp;

She raised her body and put her mouth on Clio�s pussy
giving it a small kiss. Then she bit the hem of the thong and pulled it all the
way down. But with her mouth alone she couldn�t get the thong off Clio so when
her chin touched the floor she left it there and decided to use her hands. She
kissed Clio�s left foot, took it her hands, lifted it and placed it a few
inches further kissing it again when she took her hands of it. She did the same
thing with her right foot and in a few seconds the thong was lying on the floor
between her legs. Clio handed the whip at one of the girls and told all of them
to get out. Whey they did she told Leah to stand up and she did. When she saw
Clio smiling at her, Leah felt wings in her heart. Clio brushed Leah�s tears
away and kissed her lips. When she broke the kiss she told Leah to lie on the
bed and she did. Clio went beside her and sat on her face. Leah didn�t have to
be told what to do, so the moment Clio�s pussy touched her face, she stuck her
tongue out and started licking her. Leah was very tired but she put her heart
and soul in what she was doing and pretty soon her efforts were successful.
Clio was close in another orgasm but this time she wouldn�t leave Leah
unsatisfied. She leaned forward and began licking her pussy too. Leah was in
heaven. After a few minutes both of them were working their tongues in a
frantic rhythm and they came in the same time. It was the best orgasm for both
of them and they kept licking and licking for a little more time after they had
finished. It seemed like they wanted to savor each other juices and swallow
everything. When she was long done, Clio raised her body off Leah and laid
beside her taking her in her arms

&nbsp;

�I am sorry if�� said Clio but Leah�s answer was a
passionate kiss in her mouth. 

&nbsp;

�I had to be sure� said Clio again trying to
apologize.

&nbsp;

�You don�t have to feel bad about it my lady.� She
said smiling and she kissed her again.

&nbsp;

�It was very important to see what you are capable to
do and how far could you get�and how much you want to be with me.� Saying that
she smiled and kissed Leah again while caressing her breasts and ass with her
hands in the same time. Leah was enjoying Clio�s touch and was feeling very
good about her. She had managed to pull through what seemed like a test for
Clio plus she had lived her most intense fantasy. But it looked like it would
only be the beginning. Clio broke the kiss and looked in her eyes. �Are you
alright?� she was still a little concerned, after all she did give her a very
tough first lesson in BDSM. Leah kissed her lips and rested her head on Clio�s
breasts enjoying the feeling and trying to regain her powers.

&nbsp;

While all
these were taking place in Clio�s room, Byron had taken Isobel to his own that
was on the exact opposite side of the building. The door was made of black wood
and had the letter B on it written in red liquid. The thought that liquid was
blood occurred in Isobel�s mind but she didn�t say anything. Byron opened the
door and they got in. It had pretty much the same decoration, a big double
sized bed made of black wood and black leather sheets. It had a fireplace too
and many small torches on the walls, there was a big chair and a closet. Isobel
walked for a little in the room trying to get used to it. The fire that was
already burning gave a nice effect but the best part had to be the leather
sheets. She had never seen leather sheets and when she brushed her hand over
them it felt just great. She couldn�t wait to get under them! 

&nbsp;

�Do you want
anything to drink?� asked Byron.

&nbsp;

�Not really
but I guess you do!� said Isobel with an evil smile in her face while she bend
her head to her left revealing her neck. Byron�s reaction was laughter. 

&nbsp;

�I am so
glad you are taking this so good Isobel. I was afraid of your reaction,
although I was more afraid about Leah.� 

&nbsp;

�I hope she
gets over it soon.� Said Isobel.

&nbsp;

�Well if I know something about my sister, it is that
she has her way around people. I think that from the minute she got over the
shock she will be alright.� 

&nbsp;

----- Chapter 6
-----

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Isobel sat on the bed staring at Byron.
Her mind was racing to a thousand different directions. Her life would never be
the same again. She tried to recollect the events that led to that day. The
first time she saw him under his tree. The two weeks of the intense dreams she
had. Her desperate attempts to find something, anything for him. Then she tried
to take his picture, his walk towards her, his eyes. He was looking at her with
those beautiful eyes that pierced right through her, she felt like he was
looking into her soul, into her brain. She felt that she couldn�t hold anything
back, even if she wanted to. Then she heard his voice, the deepest, most erotic
voice she had ever heard. Then she made him laugh, she saw him again. He kissed
her and that was the end of the story. She belonged to him after that kiss. She
wanted nothing else than to be around him. She would do anything to be with
him. He had protected her. He had protected her friend. He had saved their
lives. He would revenge her friend�s attackers. She felt so protected with him.
She never took her eyes away from him. He was standing just a few feet away
from her, right in front of the fireplace. He was just looking at the fire. His
shadow was trembling on the opposite wall. His eyes were glowing in the dark.
He was calm as always. She couldn�t see a single muscle moving. He was standing
with his legs slightly apart and his hands behind his back, clasped together.
She never thought it possible, but she was falling more in love with him as
time passed. She wanted him more with every glance at him. She needed him more
with every thought of him. She wanted to be with him forever. But could she?
Did he want that? She had to find out. She would ask him.

&nbsp;

�Think before you do that� he said
catching her off guard. He had read her mind. �He can read my mind too?� she
thought to herself.

&nbsp;

�Yes� he replied.

&nbsp;

�I want to be with you Byron, you are
the man of my dreams. You are the one I�ve been hoping to find all my life. You
are more than I�ve ever expected to find in someone. I can not bear the thought
of losing you someday. I know I�m not like you. But�� she didn�t finish her
sentence. She stood up and walked towards him. He turned to face her. 

&nbsp;

�I want to be like you.� She meant every
word she said. She had never wanted anything more than this. Byron knew that.
He could see that in her eyes. He brushed her right cheek with his hand. His
eyes softened and a sad smile appeared in his face. 

&nbsp;

�You are not like me. You cannot be
like me.�

&nbsp;

�But what if you bite me? Clio said
it�s like in the movies, right? So, if you bite my neck I�ll become a vampire
too.� She wanted that. She wanted Byron to bite her and make her one of his
kind. 

&nbsp;

�It�s not the same. We are not going to
be the same.� He saw a question forming in her mind and stopped her before it
reached her lips. �If this happens, you�ll turn into a vampire like Clio, like
the rest. I am not like the rest.� 

&nbsp;

Then it hit her. He was different. He
could see the light, Clio couldn�t do that. He was free to do whatever he
wanted, whenever he wanted, Clio couldn�t do that. None of the rest could do
that. They would only be together behind closed doors. They would only walk
together in the night. He would turn her into a creature of the night. But he
would still be a creature without limitations, just like she was now. So he
really didn�t have to bite her to be together. 

&nbsp;

�But how long will this last Byron?�
She felt a knot forming in her stomach. �I don�t have as much time as you have
in life. I am just a mortal.� It had never occurred to her what a powerful word
that was. Being a mortal is never a problem when you�re surrounded by other
mortals. It�s only when you meet an immortal that you understand your time on
this earth is limited. It�s only when you find the one you want to spent an
eternity with that you fully understand the significance of time. 

&nbsp;

�Don�t you want us to be together?� she
asked him while tears were forming in her eyes. 

&nbsp;

�I�ve walked this earth for a long time
Isobel. I�ve seen a lot of things. I�ve met a lot of people. I�ve seen a lot of
suffering and death. I�ve caused a lot of both.�� 

&nbsp;

�Life is filled with pain and death. I
am sure you had your reasons for doing whatever you have done. But you�ve also
seen joy. I want to be with you for as long as I can. Why don�t you want me to?
Why do you want to take this away from me?� A tear run down her face and Byron
wiped it with his thumb. 

&nbsp;

�You cannot understand the immense
changes that will happen to you now. Your life as you know it will end. You
will never see the daylight again, without getting killed by it. You will never
see your family or friends again. You will literally disappear from the face of
this earth.� He stopped talking for a few seconds, letting his words sink into
her.

&nbsp;

�Do you see my point?� He asked her
after a while. 

&nbsp;

�But we shall be together. That�s all I
ever wanted since the day I met you.� She answered. �We shall be together for
an eternity.�

&nbsp;

�Eternity is a nice thought until you
realise you�ll spend it alone.� He said with a five centuries old wisdom and
sadness. �You�ll see all that you love fade and die while you�re left behind to
count your wounds.�

&nbsp;

�You�re the one I love. You�re the one
I cherish the most in my life. I don�t care about the sun. I don�t have a family;
I was brought by an aunt that I never cared for neither did she. The only
friend I had before I met you is sitting in the next room with Clio and I�m not
going to lose her�.

&nbsp;

Byron didn�t say anything to that. He
knew she was telling him the truth. This wasn�t an innocent teenage crush over
an actor. This was genuine love and he was actually happy she was experiencing
it. He was happy he was seeing another person being some much in love with
someone else. It was always the only thing that kept him going all that time.
It was the only thing that kept him protecting the innocent from as much harm
as he could. It was why he was making all this talk to Isobel. He tried to
remember the times he had fallen in love. He remembered their faces, their
smiles, their laughter, their happiness when they were living together. He
remembered then the disappointment when they realised he couldn�t give them a
child, the looks and whispers of everyone when they saw that he wasn�t getting
older, the terror in their eyes every time he decided to tell them the truth.
Most of the times he would end up chased with torches and wooden sticks. 

&nbsp;

�Talk to me Byron� she almost pleaded
him. �What are you thinking? I wish I could read your mind too.� She said with
a sad voice.

&nbsp;

�People will always be the same. People
will never understand you. People will always be afraid of you. That�s what my
parents and the elders kept teaching me. That�s what I faced in my life.� He
paused just for a few seconds and gave her his warmest smile. He brushed her
cheeks and kissed her. 

&nbsp;

�But you are different. Maybe this
wasn�t just a dream. Maybe you really are the one.� Just as he said that, he
took her in his arms and kissed her again. 

&nbsp;

When they broke the kiss, some minutes
later, Isobel was literally floating in the air. She couldn�t remember if she
had ever been that happy in her life. �I love you� she thought knowing he could
read her mind. �That means more to me that you will ever understand� she heard
a voice in her mind. She looked at him with questioningly. �I don�t have to
open my lips for you to hear my voice� he said again. The thought of the inability
to keep something from him crossed her mind. 

�This is not something I do on purpose
Isobel. You have the right to think whatever you want. But sometimes it�s
better for me to know something before it�s been said. It protects me. It�s my
defence against people. You don�t have to worry about that. I don�t have to
fear anything from you. Your mind is yours.� 

&nbsp;

�No Byron, my mind�s yours. Everything
I have and everything I am are yours to have and to hold.� She kissed him and
took a step back. She took his right hand in hers and fell to one knee. She
kissed it and lowered her head. �I am yours my Lord. I wish to become one of you.
I want to be considered your kin. I place myself at your mercy and your
disposal to do as you wish.� Byron smiled slightly amused. 

&nbsp;

�You have seen too many movies Isobel.
I do not wish you to become my slave. I want you to be at my side.� He touched her
chin and raised her head. He smiled at her and her face lit. 

&nbsp;

�So you�re going to bite me?� she asked
him. 

&nbsp;

�Yes I will. When I find the right time
to do so.� He answered making her feel like a child waiting to open its
present. 

&nbsp;

�So there is nothing more to do for me
than sit back and wait, is there?� she said looking at him with a way that
sounded more like an invitation than a question. 

&nbsp;

�I do have one or two ideas if you
interested� he answered with a grin much like hers. 

&nbsp;

Isobel took a few steps back and sat on
the bed. She brushed her hands again on the leather sheets enjoying the
feeling. She took her eyes from him, just for a couple of seconds and looked
around. She turned to him again smiling. �Well, I am waiting� she said. Byron
moved forward with slow steps. He stood in front of her and put his right index
finger under her chin raising her head. He leaned towards her and brought his
lips very close to hers. She got lost in his scent, in his eyes, in his aura
and tried to kiss him. Just before their lips touched he moved back. She had
her eyes closed still, waiting to be kissed. 

&nbsp;

�Be careful what you wish for, you
might get it.� He said and moved to the cupboard. She opened her eyes and
watched him. He took a bottle, two glasses and went back to her. His eyes never
left hers. He was looking straight in her soul and she let him. She had nothing
to hide. She didn�t want anything to hide from him. He poured a dark red liquid
in the glasses and handed her one. She looked at the bottle. Its shape seemed
familiar. She took a sip and she remembered. �

&nbsp;

�Sandman� she said smiling and took the
bottle from his hand. �Didn�t expect anything else than a bottle with a cloaked
man on the label�. He smiled and kissed her. She tasted the sweet taste of the
Port on his lips. �I like it so much I could drink the whole bottle� she said. 

&nbsp;

�Then by all means do so� he said and
emptied his glass with one motion. �I have to go downstairs for a while to sort
some things out and I�ll be right back.� She smiled at him making an
understanding notion and poured some more wine in her glass. He kissed her, put
his glass on the fireplace and then left the room. 

&nbsp;

She drank the second glass, then the
third and then the fourth. She couldn�t figure out if Byron was taking too long
or she was drinking really fast. She was so nervous that each glass didn�t last
two minutes, without needing refill. After some time she realised she had
emptied half of the bottle. She wasn�t drunk yet but she definitely had a buzz
in her head. She emptied her glass for the last time and decided to stop. She
didn�t want to get drunk and ruin what was probably going to be a great night.
So, she put her glass on the floor and leaned backwards, resting her body on
her elbows. She closed her eyes, let her head fall back and enjoyed the sweet
taste of the Port that was dominating her mouth. �At least until I taste
something else� she thought and smiled to herself. She wanted to surprise him.
She had to do something to make him want her more. She knew she wanted to make
love to her; he was just playing with her. And he was doing a good job too
because she couldn�t hold on anymore. 

&nbsp;

She opened her eyes and looked around.
She stood up and walked to the closet. Isobel was not sure if she should open
it. The thought of it being full of private things did occur to her, but her
curiosity won. She opened it and laughed at her decision. Apart from a few
bottles and glasses, the closet was pretty much empty. Just when she was ready
to close it again, she noticed a drawer at the bottom of it. She tried to find
out its content but it was locked. At that point she heard the door open and turned
to see who it was. Two very beautiful girls entered the room with small but
decisive steps. The fact that they were naked didn�t strike to Isobel as much
as it could in another place and another time but she looked in awe at their
faces. They couldn�t be more than 16 years old. Their faces were so exotic and
fairy-like that she couldn�t stop starring. The fact that they were smiling
made them even more beautiful. They were Asian and as they drew closer she
noticed their eyes. Those almond shaped eyes that�s so typical for their race.
They couldn�t be less beautiful than the rest of their body but when she looked
into them she realised that the two girls had seen a lot. She was starting to
understand the difference between a mortal and a vampire. She knew she was
right when the girl on the left opened her little mouth to speak.

&nbsp;

�Good evening my Lady� she said and
both bowed their heads just a little bit. �We came to help you prepare� she
said and moved towards her. 

&nbsp;

�Ah, wait a minute there. You came to
prepare me for what? Who send you?� The girls looked at her with a smile and a
little giggle escaped their lips. 

&nbsp;

�Come my lady, don�t waste your time
with questions you already know the answers� replied the other girl. 

&nbsp;

The darkness of the room kept the two
girls from seeing the blush in Isobel cheeks when she understood what she had
asked them. They reached her and dropped to the floor to take her boots off.
Then one girl went behind her and unzipped the leather top while the girl in
front of her did the same thing to the leather trousers. Now she was standing
in front of them with only her thong. The girl behind her took the collar off
while the other one removed her last garment. Now she was just as naked as the
two girls. 

&nbsp;

�You have a very beautiful body my
Lady. Its going to be a pleasurable process� said the girl in front of Isobel
while she planted a small kiss below her navel. She stood up and taking a hand
each led her to back of the room, slightly confusing her. 

&nbsp;

�Where are you taking me? She asked a
few seconds before the girl on her right pulled a curtain Isobel had never
realised it was there all along. She saw a bathtub big enough for five people
made of black marble. The walls had torches already burning, just like the
rest, towels on a shelf, many small bottles and a small closed box on the left.
The girl on her right turned the taps on and steaming water started filling the
tub. The girls took some of the bottles and poured their contents in too. When
it was half full she took Isobel�s hand and led her inside. The water was hot
but not a bit unpleasant. A girl sat behind Isobel and the other one to the far
end. 

&nbsp;

�Relax my Lady and let us take care of
you� she heard the girl behind her say while she was massaging her shoulders.
Isobel closed her eyes and let herself to their very capable hands. She enjoyed
the shoulder massage while the girl in front of her did the same to her legs.
The scented oils had reached her nose making her more relaxed. After a few
minutes the girl behind her stopped the massage and put shampoo in Isobel�s
hair. Various aromas hit her nose and she was certain she could smell cream,
coconut and maybe honey. She loved the combination, but she liked even more
what was happening under water. The girl in front of her was shaving her legs.
It was like she could see under all the water and the soap and it felt great.
After a couple of minutes she had finished and she started massaging her legs
again.

&nbsp;

The girl behind her didn�t just wash
her hair; she was also massaging her head. Isobel could nothing else but short
humming noises. The scents, the hot water, their expert hands were making her feel
unbelievable. She was lost in a trance that had no intention of getting out.
Even more so, when she was feeling hands coming up her legs and down her chest.
She let her head fell backwards. Isobel opened her legs more and the girl in
front of her moved closer. Two pairs of very delicate and experienced hands
were playing with her body. Her moans were getting louder by now. The girls
were focused in her pussy and the nipples. Isobel didn�t stand a chance against
them and after a few minutes the first orgasm made her body shiver. But the
girls didn�t stop there. They kissed, bit, licked and used their fingers in the
same rhythm as before bringing a helpless Isobel to another orgasm. 

&nbsp;

When after a while she opened her eyes
again, she was still in a slight trance. She smiled at them and closed her eyes
purring like a cat after a good meal. The girls smiled at each other, content
for their success, but they hadn�t finished and they told her so. 

&nbsp;

�Please my Lady, don�t fall asleep� she
said the girl behind her. �You are not ready yet.� saying that the girl in
front of her pulled the plug for the bath tub to get empty. Then, the girl
behind her stood up helping Isobel to do the same, while the other girl
remained in a kneeling position. Isobel felt water coming from above her. The
girl standing behind her washed the shampoo away from her hair while the other
one did the same thing for her body and her legs. When they were finished they
grabbed towels and wiped her body. When that was done too, they helped her get
out of the bathtub. 

&nbsp;

The girl behind her opened the box on
the wall and took out a neatly folded piece of cloth. The girls took it in their
hands and unfolded it, revealing a gorgeous black silk cloak. They helped her
wear it and then both of them got in front of her to do the three buttons. They
put the hood over her head and it covered her head in such a degree that she
could only see her feet. The last thing about the cloak was a cord in the neck
that was tied in a small knot. The girls put a hand on each side and led Isobel
back to the fireplace. They kissed Isobel on the lips and then kneeled to kiss
her hands. 

&nbsp;

�Farewell my Lady� they said in one
voice and they left her standing in the room dazed and confused. 

&nbsp;

She was still trying to understand what
had happened before when she felt a hand on her back. It startled her and began
to move her head but she regret it and remained still instead. The hand kept
going up and down her back, making a small pass above her ass. Isobel�s heart
was racing again. The fabric didn�t do much to cover her up and she was sure
her erect nipples were quite visible. The cloak was so fine and thin that it
was like she didn�t had it on at all. She felt two hands now on her shoulders,
massaging a little bit, then playing with the cord of the cloak and finally
undoing the knot. He got close to her body and she was filling him now, his
chest touching her back, his penis touching her ass. The hands moved to her
chess, caressing and fondling her breasts. Her nipples were an easy target and
after a while they were having their share in caressing, even pinching,
something that made Isobel hold her breath whenever it happened. 

&nbsp;

After a couple of minutes she felt the
hands unbuttoning the cloak. The hands got inside it and touched her skin. She
knew. She knew that touch. She craved for that touch for so long. His left hand
went to her neck and his right between her legs. She gasped at the feeling of
his fingers entering her for the first time. He kissed her neck and shivers run
through her spine. His fingers found her clit and she started moaning. He
pushed her body backwards to feel his penis. She moved her body in the same
rhythm as his fingers. Byron kept increasing his speed and she tried to keep up
with him. She was getting close to another orgasm and it hit her the minute he pinched
her left nipple. She moaned and moaned and her body trembled for a few more
minutes but she didn�t move. He was holding close to him. When she had relaxed,
he brought his hands to her shoulders and took the cloak off. She turned around
and looked straight in his eyes. She kissed him with all the passion she had.
He touched her hair, her back, he caressed her gorgeous ass. She threw her arms
around his neck and when after a minute she broke the kiss she took half a step
back. She looked at him once more with eyes full of lust. She took his hands in
hers and kissed them gently. 

&nbsp;

�May I my Lord?� she asked him and he
smiled.

&nbsp;

�You may do as you please my lady� he
said and she knelt in front of him. 

&nbsp;

On her way down, she kissed his pierced
nipples, his stomach and then his thighs. She spread her legs for stability and
clasped her hands behind her back. She kissed him lightly on the base oh his
dick and then moved slowly to the tip and went back again. She moved her head lower
and kissed him again. She stuck her tongue out and tapped him. She was playing
with him and they were both enjoying it. She licked his balls and then sucked
them too. He was getting erect so she knew she was doing a good job. But she
wanted to feel him inside her so she opened her mouth and pushed forward. She
remained still and played with her tongue. She licked him inside her mouth. She
took her tongue out and licked him like that even though it was more difficult
with him inside her. She was feeling him getting erect in her mouth and she
loved it. She moved her head back and forth slowly at first and then she picked
up the pace. He was too big for her and she couldn�t deepthroat him all the way
as she wanted, but she kept trying. Her gag reflexes didn�t take a long time to
appear and after a minute she pulled her head away from him, trying to catch
her breath while coughing. His hands caressed her cheeks and that brought her
comfort immediately. She put him in her mouth again and she used her tongue,
teasing him on the tip of his dick. He kept stroking her hair but after a while
he was the one that took the initiative. He grabbed her head and pushed forward
surprising her. She tried not to resist him at first so he managed to get half
his length inside her mouth. She was getting used to it by now and she wasn�t
gagging anymore. He began moving faster and going deeper and she tried to keep
up with him. After a while she unclasped her hands and placed them on his
ankles, caressing his feet. When she started gagging again she pinched his legs
and he withdrew himself, letting her catch her breath. 

&nbsp;

�Stand up Isobel� he said and she did.
He looked at her and kissed her. He put her arms around his neck and lifted her
body as easily as he could lift a baby. She put her legs around his waist and
he let her body descent slowly. The moment his dick touched her pussy lips, she
let a moan slip through her lips. He let her body on his dick and she clanged
to him tighter. His erect member was stretching her pussy and all she could do was
tremble at the sensations and moan. After about a minute he was inside her
completely and he walked towards a wall. The moment her back touched the wall
he began moving up and down. She was moaning a lot louder now and she was sure
that someone could hear her from outside the room but she didn�t care one bit.
She was making love to the man she loved more than anything in the world. And
she was feeling great too. 

&nbsp;

�Take me to bed� she said to him with
an almost pleading voice and he did. He let her body touch slowly the sheets
and then continued from where he had stopped. Isobel was sweating and breathing
fast. She had a lot of trouble trying to keep with his pace, even though she
was just lying on bed. At some point Byron stopped and took his dick out of
her. She opened her eyes and looked at him pleadingly. He smiled and got back
inside. He kept kissing her while she kept stroking his hair and scratching his
back with her nails. They were both moaning and their rhythm had increased. Isobel
was getting closer to yet another orgasm but so was Byron. 

&nbsp;

�Isobel look at me� he said and she
obliged. �Do you really want me to..?� she didn�t let him finish his sentence
and stopped him with a kiss. She looked at him and smiled.

&nbsp;

�Dark
as night, 
Red as blood, 
Sweet as flowers on a grave.
To me this is your hair, 
your lips, your scent.
My prince of darkness, 
Ruler of night, I worship thee.
I don't want to live in day, 
I've seen no light and I'm here to stay
with you I rule hand by hand, side by side.
In the darkness we lurk, in the night we wither.
So ashes to ashes and dust to dust, 
if it shall be the night is a must� (4)

&nbsp;

She finished the poem and then kissed
him again. He smiled in such a way she knew she had just made him happy. She
kissed him again. 

&nbsp;

�Take me any way you want for I am
yours my Lord� she said and closed her eyes. 

&nbsp;

Byron withdrew himself from Isobel and
putting his hands on her waist made her face down. He slipped a pillow under
her stomach and entered her again. She moved her hands upwards and spread her
legs more. Byron kept pounding while he was fondling her breasts. She was
moaning and almost crying from pleasure. He put his teeth on her neck and just
stayed there. He felt her body tremble uncontrollably. He raised his body
slowly leaving trails on her back with his nails. He grabbed her waist and kept
thrusting harder. Isobel couldn�t hold on anymore and came for yet another
time, only this time she screamed throughout her orgasm. Byron took his dick
out of her pussy and placed it on the entrance of her anus. That caught her off
guard but she did nothing to stop him. He tried to enter her but her body
reacted by instinct and pulled away from him. He put some force on her waist
pinning her down and he tried again. This time she had no chance against him.
She had lubricated him enough so he didn�t have to try hard to put the tip
inside her. When she relaxed her body, he took his time moving inch by inch
deeper and before she could even realise it, Byron was all the way in. She
didn�t feel so much discomfort. It was the opposite. She was feeling pain but
also pleasure. Especially when he started moving in and out of her she really
loved it. She was feeling every inch of him, every vain on his dick was
stretching her body making her feel even more pleasure. Byron was really
pounding and she was sure he was about to come too. And he did. Only it wasn�t
quite how she had imagined it. 

&nbsp;

He put his right hand on her pussy
fingering her clit while using his left hand on her nipples. He kissed her neck
and then opened his mouth. His pace was so fast that Isobel could not keep up with
him and she just stayed there letting her body be rocked back and fourth by
him. She felt his teeth on her neck again and the same shivers run through her
body. Byron was about to come and she knew that. Her hands grabbed the sheets
as his final thrusts were even stronger. Her moans got louder only this time
they were not the only ones. Byron came inside her ass at the moment she felt
his sperm touching her bowels she came again. Both their bodies trembled and
after they had finished they remained still. Byron saw tears running down
Isobel�s cheeks and kissed them. He lied beside her and brought her on top of
him. He could see the face of total happiness and he knew that this couldn�t be
wrong. He put his left hand through her hair and kissed her for a minute. Then
he moved her head slightly up and to the left so that her neck was right in
front of him. 

&nbsp;

Isobel was still in a trance. But this
was a different trance and he knew that. He saw the veins in her neck and his
heart started pounding harder. It had been so long since the last time he had
done that. He could feel the veins pulsing. He could see the blood running. He
opened his mouth and rested his teeth on her neck. Isobel was still in the
trance, she was a creature paralyzed by a superior species. Byron knew that and
took his time. He pressed his teeth and bit through her skin, through her flesh
and tasted blood again.

----- Chapter 7
-----

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Byron kept Isobel in his arms until
dawn. He could feel her heart beating slower with every minute. Her breath
became fainter. Her colour was a few shades whiter now. He kept starring at her
mouth. He had never turned another person before, so he tried to follow what
they had told him as a child. He had drunk a lot of her blood. He had slit his
arm and let a few drops of his own blood in her mouth. They should keep her in
life long enough for her teeth to grow. Then he would give her his flesh and
the newly gained instincts would take control. She would bite him without
knowing it actually. She would taste his blood to regain her powers. He would
be her first �victim�. She would be the first to drink from his blood. After a
couple more agonizing minutes he parted her lips again to check her teeth. At
last! Her canines had fully grown. He put his right wrist inside her mouth and
pressed inwards. Nothing happened in the first seconds but then he saw her
muscles move. Her lips closed and her jaws tightened. He felt her teeth bit
into his arm. He felt a shiver in his spine like a cold breeze on a bare back.
She kept biting for a whole minute. He could feel that she was regaining her
powers because the biting was getting stronger. After a while he took his arm
from her mouth causing some blood to run from her chin to his chest. She
immediately licked it up. He put his hand on her forehead and gathered her hair
on the left to see her face. 

&nbsp;

�Isobel, can you hear me?� he asked. He
received a light humming, just like she would have done if she was sleeping,
which in sense she was. 

&nbsp;

Byron let her fall onto his chest. He
felt her heart beating faster and after a while she had gained the (just a
little slower than human) heart beat that would follow her for the rest of her
life. Her skin had acquired the typical albino colour and her body had become
even firmer, if that was possible. He kept stroking her hair with his right
hand and her back with his left. Isobel kept purring like a cat. After a while
he felt her legs moving. He felt her whole body moving. She woke up a minute
later. She looked at him and smiled. She pushed her body upwards and kissed his
lips. She rested her head then on the pillow next to his. 

&nbsp;

�How do you feel Isobel?� he asked
still a little concerned. 

&nbsp;

�I feel wonderful. Last night was
incredible Byron� saying that she rubbed her body against his. 

&nbsp;

�Yes it was. Do you have anything else
to tell me?� he asked again.

&nbsp;

�Well, I have this strange taste in my
mouth and my neck feels a little sore but other than that I am fine.�

&nbsp;

Byron didn�t say anything. He waited
for her to realise the changes in her body. The seconds of silence that
followed were only interrupted by the fire burning the logs in the fireplace.
Byron sensed questions forming in her mind. She was beginning to observe
things. He could hear her lips and tongue moving in her mouth in a desperate
attempt to remember what that taste was. Then she moved her right hand to her
neck to rub it a little. She located the two small holes. She raised her body
and looked Byron in his eyes. Byron said nothing to her. This was very
important now. She put her finger in her mouth and touched her teeth. Her eyes
widened. This was it, the moment of truth. Isobel�s face went blank. She was
putting the pieces together and when she did she gave him the biggest smile and
attacked his lips screaming from joy. Byron�s mind relaxed at last. 

&nbsp;

�Thank you so much. I cannot believe
you did it so soon. I don�t remember it but it doesn�t matter now. Nothing
matters now except that we shall be together forever.� She kept kissing him and
smiling and laughing. After that she jumped from the bed and started running
around testing her new body. She turned to look at Byron who was giving her his
best smile. 

&nbsp;

�So what do I do now, or what don�t I
do now?� she asked him.

&nbsp;

�What do you mean? What do you want to
do?� he said.

&nbsp;

�So I am a vampire now, right?� she
asked him receiving a nod of agreement. 

&nbsp;

�So I stay away from the sun light,
stakes and crosses?� she asked him again. Byron laughed and lied on his back
again. Isobel ran towards him and kneeled on the floor putting her head on his
chest. 

&nbsp;

�The sun will burn your skin and your
eyes and eventually will kill you. You can only be killed by decapitation or if
an object �not just a wooden stake- pierce through your heart but other than
that your body will heal itself rapidly depending of course on the seriousness
of the injury. Although, believe me, crosses, chants and holy water were
medieval myths for the peasants. They have as much affect on us as a cat�s flap
in an elephant�s house!� he answered almost laughing. 

&nbsp;

�Byron I am so happy right now. I want to tell the
whole world that I am yours.� She couldn�t remember the last time she had ever
been this happy, but then again maybe this was the first time. 

&nbsp;

�You don�t have to tell anyone. They will all know
from the minute they see you.� He answered and Isobel looked at him
questioningly.

&nbsp;

�You look different and you don�t have to be a vampire
to see that. But there are some things you should know about your new status.�

&nbsp;

�What are you talking about?� she asked him and
planted a small kiss on his stomach.

&nbsp;

�You are no longer a guest in this community Isobel.
You are now a part of this city. You will live by same rules with the rest of
the vampires here. Do you understand that?� he asked and she nodded.

&nbsp;

�Furthermore, you now hold a place higher than most of
the others. You are placed beside me. You must act likewise.� Isobel started to
realize certain things.

&nbsp;

�So this is why everyone has been treating me like a
royalty? Is this how it will always be? I am their queen?� she asked.

&nbsp;

�Well, you are not the queen in the same sense that I
am not the king. We are all equal here, but you will be treated in a different
manner. It�s a very strange feeling when everyone greets you in a courtly
manner, although it�s mainly up to you if you are going to inspire them to do
so.� He stopped just for a few seconds and kissed her. �But I�m sure you�ll do
fine.�

&nbsp;

�But how will everyone know that I am�I mean I don�t
know everyone. How will they know if we aren�t walking side by side, that I am
�?� Byron nodded that he understood her question. 

&nbsp;

�Everyone will know who you are because I�ll give you
something to wear.� Her eyes widened from anticipation. 

&nbsp;

�What are you going to give me? Come on, don�t do this
again, please tell me!� she asked him.� 

&nbsp;

�When the time comes you�ll get it.� He smiled and
closed his eyes. 

&nbsp;

�I don�t believe how annoying you can be!� she told
him and bit his stomach. Byron laughed at her remark and put his hand on her
head. She kissed his hand and enjoyed the caresses on her cheeks. She put her
hand on his left foot and kissed his thigh. She kept on doing this for a minute
or two and then she bit him again. �Are you going to tell or not?� She asked
him but Byron just said �no�. 

&nbsp;

�I bet I can make you tell me� she said with a grin in
her face and Byron just laughed. 

&nbsp;

�I have to be fair, so before you try anything I must
tell you a few more things. Vampires can sense each other. You could say that
we are connected in ways a mortal can not understand. Remember how I could read
your thoughts and how you could listen to my voice in your head?� Isobel nodded
in agreement. Most vampires cannot do that to other mortals because they are
not strong enough. Some can not read the thoughts of another vampire. But they
all talk to each other. Now imagine what I can do to our head or your body with
my mind without even saying the words.� He could see that Isobel could not
follow him. So he decided to show her. 

&nbsp;

Isobel felt a little tingle in the back of her head.
She leaned forward and kissed the tip of Byron�s dick. She kissed him again,
then opened her mouth and took him inside her. She moved her head up and down
for a few times and then she looked at him. He used his fingers to put aside
the hair and smiled. She kept sucking with her eyes fixed on his. �You
understand now?� he said in a manner that didn�t sound as much as a question.
Isobel stayed still for a few seconds, then her eyes widened and she bit him.
Byron laughed at her reaction. 

&nbsp;

�I can�t believe you did that. You are such a typical
man!� she told him and hit him in the chest a few times. �Nice way to make a
point Byron� she said acting all offended. 

&nbsp;

�Well it was the best way to make you understand what
I was talking about.� He said still laughing. �So, do you still want to make
that bet?�

&nbsp;

�No, it�s no fun when you already know you�re going to
lose.� She answered him but stayed there. She rested her head on his thigh and
starred at him while caressing his stomach with her right hand. �Tell me more
Byron, tell me everything!�

&nbsp;

�What do you want to know beautiful?� he told her
smiling. 

&nbsp;

�Tell be about me�my new condition. What should I
expect?�

&nbsp;

�Well I guess I could tell you a lot of things.� Maybe I should even warn you about others,
but I won�t do it. It is important that you learn by yourself certain aspects
of your new life. The small things concern your body. The changes will be huge.
Apart from the faster healing thing, you are going to have extremely sharp
senses from now, which is good, as you�ll probably found out.� Saying that, an
evil grin formed in his face bringing a blush in her face, but immediately he
got all serious. 

&nbsp;

�Isobel listen to me now for this is quite serious.
Sooner or later, your body will need something. You will feel physical and
mental pain. You are a new vampire so you�ll not be able to control this. Try
and suppress and it will become unbearable for you. Sooner or later, your body
will have the need to be fed. You will need to drink blood. This is not like
any kind of hunger or thirst you�ve experienced as a mortal. If you don�t drink
blood you�ll get weak and eventually die. But you must never bite a mortal
without permission. Your need to quench your thirst will be so strong that
you�ll probably kill the one you bite. It would be better for you if you find
another vampire to drink from his blood, so this way he or she could control
the amount you drink. We have very strict laws about this here, laws that bound
every single one of us.� He was looking straight in her eyes and so was she. 

&nbsp;

�Don�t worry Byron. I remember your rules and I
promise I won�t break them. But who will help with this? Do I walk in the
streets asking people or vampires to drink their blood?� She asked and Byron
smiled. 

&nbsp;

�I�ll help you in this. You already know some people
here. I am sure all of them will be more than eager to help you. The first
steps of a vampire are very important, so no one will turn you down.�

&nbsp;

�So, how long will it be until I have the need to��
she tried to ask but didn�t finish her sentence. She couldn�t say it and she
thought it was strange since she really wanted to be a vampire. 

&nbsp;

�Drink blood? Well I don�t know, it�s not the same for
everyone. We�ll have to wait for this but don�t worry. Most of the times it
takes a couple of days before the symptoms appear.�

&nbsp;

�So until then I�ll just heave to find something to
keep me occupied, shouldn�t I?� she said smiling. 

&nbsp;

Isobel planted a couple more kisses on his stomach and
then went for his thighs. She climbed on the bed and positioned herself between
his legs. He went back to kissing his chest while caressing him. He kissed his
neck, his nipples pulling playfully his piercing rings with her teeth. She
rested her head on his chest. He put his hands on her shoulders and gave her a
light massage. Then she realized what he meant about sharper senses. She felt
goose bumps in every inch of her body. He concentrated on her neck and every
hair on her body stood up! A light humming noise came out of her. She raised
her head and kissed him again before she made her way to the lower parts of his
body. 

&nbsp;

Her tongue never left his body leaving a wet trace on
his chest and stomach. She kissed his dick from above, then the sides then
under it. She kissed his balls and then his dick again. She opened her mouth
and took him inside. She wasn�t in any kind of hurry. She took her time
enjoying what she was doing wanting Byron to feel as good as she was. After a
couple of minutes her efforts brought results as she felt him getting bigger in
her mouth. But she never let him out. She was using her tongue in the same time
giving him more pleasure. She used her fingers on his dick and balls, just for
an extra effect. His hand was on her head, touching her hair, but never giving
her �orders�. This was her show. After a while Isobel realized that she was doing
a text-book deepthroat without gagging, not for a second. �Add this to the new
abilities� she thought and smiled to herself. Byron was now fully erect and
still in her mouth. She could feel him deep down her throat, she could feel him
in her neck but she didn�t gag. She could even breathe without much problem. She
had her left hand around Byron right leg, thus keeping herself in the
appropriate position while in the same time her right hand was between her own
legs rubbing her clit. She loved what was happening and she was pretty sure so
did he! 

&nbsp;

She was focused on what she was doing that she didn�t
pay any attention when the door opened. After all she wasn�t ashamed of what
she was doing, so why would she stop? Byron�s dick was all the way down in
Isobel�s throat and he was feeling her tongue massaging his balls. He grabbed a
fistful of hair and he dragged her with him as he sat on the bed�s headboard.
Isobel never let an inch of him exit her mouth. Nothing would distract her
effort to pleasure the man she loved, the man she would probably spent the rest
of her immortal life with. She didn�t stop when she sensed other people in the
room. She didn�t stop when she felt hands touching her legs, leather touching
her ankles. She didn�t raise her head when she felt her legs spreading and
getting tied. But she made complaining sounds when her right hand was removed
from her pussy and her left hand from Byron legs. She stopped complaining when
she felt a tongue behind each knee. She began trembling when the tongues made
their way up and met on her ass. She got lost when the tongue was replaced by
teeth and the kissing by biting. Two pairs of hands were caressing her legs,
two mouths were biting her ass cheeks and her lover�s dick was pumping her
throat. Isobel�s senses were working overtime and she felt her brain ready to
explode. 

&nbsp;

She felt hands traveling to her pussy and recommencing
what she was doing to herself only much better. She felt hands groping her
breasts and pinching her nipples. She felt two pussies rubbing again her legs.
She felt Byron�s grip on her hair getting stronger and his moves faster. She
felt his dick stretching the walls of her neck but she didn�t complain. She
couldn�t complain. She was enjoying every minute of it. Having him inside her
body was the first thing she wanted since she had met him and her senses told
her that she was close too taste his sperm too. Meanwhile her clit was on fire
from all the attention and she was pretty close to an orgasm too. Then all of a
sudden everything stopped! Then Byron raised her head of him and the two bodies
got of her too. Isobel opened her eyes and looked at him with huge question
marks in her eyes and a why in her mind. �Not yet beautiful� she heard his
voice inside her. He leaned forward and kissed her lips which gave her some
comfort but didn�t erase the disappointment for the sudden pause. 

&nbsp;

�I have an idea that will you give knowledge and
understanding of your new body, among others. What do you say?� Byron asked her
with a devilish smile and Isobel simply nodded yes. She was really close to an
orgasm and she would pretty much say yes to anything at that time. 

&nbsp;

�I understand that you�re interested in BDSM, which is
fine because I am too. Do you have any experience in it?� 

&nbsp;

�I always liked it but I never had the chance to do
anything about it. I never met someone I trusted enough, so I�m pretty much
self-taught.� She answered him. 

&nbsp;

�I got this idea that I wanted to try it on you. Do
you trust me Isobel?�

&nbsp;

�Yes I do Byron. What do you want me do?� she answered
him and kissed the tip of his still erect dick. 

&nbsp;

�Oh, I don�t want you to do anything. The only I want
from you is to open your mind and let our senses guide you to another world.�
Saying that Isobel felt her body pulled by two pair of hands. She tried to look
who they were but a blindfold was pressed against her eyes before she had the
chance. She would say though, from the softness of their skin and their scent,
that they were women and probably the same two women that had bathed her the
night before. 

&nbsp;

Isobel was made to stand up and led a few steps
further. The two women were holding her hands while her enhanced hearing told
her that Byron was walking around her. After about a minute she felt him behind
her. She felt his dick pressing, touching her ass. She felt his hands touching
her breasts and she leaned backwards to feel him more. Byron brought his right
hand between her legs and focused on her clit. Then he put his teeth on her
neck and pressed her skin without cutting her flesh. Isobel let a sigh. Then a
strange smell caught her attention. She smelled roses all of a sudden. 

&nbsp;

��Can you tell
what this is Isobel?� he whispered in her ear.

&nbsp;

�It smells like roses.� She told him almost in a
trance. 

&nbsp;

�Do you like the smell?� he asked her and she nodded
yes. 

&nbsp;

�Do you like this?� he whispered again. Isobel felt
petals touching her skin lightly. 

&nbsp;

�Yes I do, it�s like silk.� She answered in the same
trance-like voice. The petals were traveling around her breasts, touching the
nipples, then down to her ribs, her stomach, in and around her navel, then
lower. Byron took his time, tormenting Isobel with the roses. He touched her
inner thighs and saw her legs began to tremble. Then he brushed the lips, he
used his free hand to spread them after a while and then focused on her clit.
Her body went numb. The sensations were overwhelming and the orgasm very near.
It didn�t take more than two minutes for Isobel to cum. The girls were holding
her by the hands; Byron let her lean on him throughout the orgasm that lasted
for a couple more minutes. When she had relaxed he asked how she felt and she
tried to say something but all that came out where�well nothing actually. She
couldn�t� make a coherent word and certainly not a sentence. Byron kissed her
neck and made a few steps back. He came in front of her. He played with her
nipples for a little while, pulling them and making Isobel gasp. Then he kissed
her lips and grabbed her ass. She felt his dick too rubbing against her pussy
and her juices starting flowing again. �So this is what he was talking about�
she told herself smiling and thinking the endless possibilities of her new
body. 

&nbsp;

The next thing she felt was shiver
along her spine. The smell of the roses hadn�t left but she wasn�t feeling
anything as soft as the petals. Byron was using something hard and sharp on
her. It didn�t take much time of course to realize it was the thorns. He used
the flowers expertly, taking his time with her, not rushing things. He was
scratching her lightly, on her breasts, making full circles around them,
playing special attention to the nipples that were standing rock hard and erect
by now. She could even hear the faint sound of the thorn on her skin. Byron
guided the thorns lower on her stomach and her inner things. She was trembling
and moaning. The sensations were unbelievable! Then she felt thorns on her lips
and she gasped once more. She thought she couldn�t convince her body to start
breathing again. Byron kept scratching her pussy with the thorns for a few more
minutes. The emotions were so intense that tears formed in her eyes. Byron
kissed them and then her lips. 

&nbsp;

�This is�the first time�I�ve ever felt�like
this� she managed to say and it was true. The thorns reminded her of razors and
the time she used to play with them as a teenager. She always thought herself
of a razor person rather than a knife person. Razors always brought this shiver
in her spine, an extra effect that knives never provided. The memories of
adolescence were interrupted with the thorns now travelling on her ass. It was
the same thing, the same thrill, the same shiver, her body getting numb all
over again. Then the thorns were gone. She didn�t feel anything apart from the
female hands holding her own and that what about change after a few seconds. 

&nbsp;

The girls let her hands but she didn�t
open her eyes. �She felt a female pressed
against her own from the front. She felt breasts touching her own. She felt the
softness of a pussy pressed against hers. She felt a pair of legs intertwined
with her own. She felt sweet lips touching her own and kissing her light. She
felt a tongue opening her mouth and exploring inside. She felt in heaven! She
also felt a soft material, much like silk, around her wrists. She felt her
hands pulled upwards. She tried to move them a little but she couldn�t lower
them. She wasn�t painfully stretched, she was way far from it, it was just a
simple a move to check her state. She felt hands touching her ass and a couple
of playful slaps were delivered. She never the girl�s lips leaving her own. She
never felt the girl�s tongue taken from her mouth. 

&nbsp;

Then she felt the thorns again. They
travelled from her neck, to the shoulders, to the waist, her ass, between her
cheeks, between her legs all the way down to her ankles. The girl�s hands
touched her face while without breaking the kiss. Isobel could sense that
something was going to happen. They were preparing her for something and the
agony was killing her. Suddenly she felt a sharp pain on her right ass cheek.
She cried through the girl�s mouth. It wasn�t that painful, but she hadn�t
expected that. Another hit on her left cheek. Byron was whipping her with the
roses. Another hit on the right cheek that was followed by a similar one on the
left again. She could that he was using a pattern, they weren�t random hits. He
never hit the same spot twice. Byron went on whipping her ass for a couple of minutes
and she was pretty sure she was quite red by now and just from the welts. 

&nbsp;

Then the whipping moved upwards and he
was aiming for her back. Since the flesh is much less there, the pain was
rather sharper. The hits were crossing one another. They were strong but not
sadistic. He was trying to whip her flesh of her. He was doing what he had
promised her. He was teaching her, he was showing her what her new potentials
were. And he was so right! Each blow felt like electroshock. She was certain
that in her mortal state she would feel pain but it wouldn�t be the same. She
was experiencing much more intense feelings now. The pain was transferred
through her nerve system to every corner of her body. She felt shivers running
up and down her spine the whole time. She was trembling but not just from the
pain. She was feeling pleasure as well. Each and every blow drove her nearer to
another orgasm. Meanwhile the girl had never left her spot. Her legs were still
in the same, her pussy was still in the same position, their breasts were still
touching, and her lips were still sealed with Isobel�s. The only difference was
that she had moved her hands upwards and their fingers were clasped together.
Every blow that Byron delivered to Isobel�s body was transferred to the girl,
through Isobel�s jerks, sweat and shout. Isobel was lost in another world. A
world of pain and pleasure, a world she had always wanted to find, a world she
had always wanted to explore, a world she had found the perfect guide, the
perfect man to be with. 

&nbsp;

After a while the blows stopped. Isobel
was trembling by now and Byron let her relax. The girl didn�t leave for a
couple more minutes. But when she did, Isobel�s head fell forward from
exhaustion as much surprise. Byron got in front of Isobel and raised her head
again. She kissed her lips tenderly. 

&nbsp;

�How are you feeling my lady?� he
asked.

&nbsp;

�It was�great!� she said shouting the
last word. Byron smiled widely. �I have never felt like this. It was painful
but also so erotic. And she was kissing me and our bodies were touching one
another and it completely mind-blowing.� Byron kissed her again. �The idea was
great Byron but I�m only half done!� Well he didn�t expect that and the girls
standing behind Isobel giggled which made her follow them too. 

&nbsp;

�Are you sure about this?� he asked her
and she nodded yes. �The female body is much more sensitive in front.� Isobel
jerked her head left and right implying that she didn�t want to hear anymore.
Sweat and blood were running down Isobel�s body and she was about to have a lot
more of both. 

&nbsp;

�Byron do I have blood running on my
body?� she asked him and he answered with a simple yes. �While you whip me I
want them to lick my blood. It�s a shame to be wasted.� Byron kissed her lips
touching her breasts and ass. He was so happy for her. To be honest he didn�t
expect that from her and he made a notion to the girls to follow her wish which
of course they were more than happy to do so. Byron brought a finger covered
with her blood to her face. When she smelled it her face nerves tightened and
immediately opened her mouth to taste it. Byron gave her his finger which she
liked clean. 

&nbsp;

�You will notice than blood tastes
slightly different now. That�s because your sense of taste is also much sharper
now and of course vampire blood taste somehow different too. Feeling better
now?� he asked and she nodded in agreement. She was surprised when she felt how
so little amount of blood made her feel better. But then again, her thoughts
were interrupted by two tongues attacking her body and licking every spot in
it.� 

&nbsp;

The sound of rose stalks cutting
thought the air caught her attention suddenly. The feeling of her stomach
getting whipped with thorns made her jerk backwards. She got another one
crossing her first one and then six more. Byron was holding a rose in each hand
and he went with an alternative strategy. He used both in the same time,
something that really made Isobel cry out after a while. Meanwhile the girls
had finished cleaning her and they were sure she would pretty be surprised to
see that her body had already healed. But she other things in her mind now,
such as getting her breasts whipped with thorns. The other girl stood up and
pressed her body against Isobel�s. Her pussy touching her ass, her soft breasts
against her back, she let Isobel�s head lean backwards on her left shoulder
while she raised her hands and clasped their fingers. From time to time she
kissed her lips and neck. Isobel was trembling.�
Byron had warned her about the difference in the whipping, he had warned
her that the pain would be much worse but he had said nothing about the amount
of pleasure she would be getting; and there was lot of it!

&nbsp;

After a couple of minutes of intense
breast whipping, he focused on her thighs. The girl used her own feet to spread
Isobel�s feet a little more so Byron could have a better view. She felt her
inner thighs burning and there a little spot in the back of her mind where she
hid the fear getting her pussy whipped by those thorns. She wanted to feel how
that would feel but she was also a bit afraid. Byron saw that and decided to go
easy on her; after she had gotten through a lot. So after whipping her thighs
he went for her pussy but not with much power. Somewhere between the immense
pain and pleasure Isobel understood that. She understood that Byron had sensed
her fear and got angry for feeling like that. 

&nbsp;

�Byron what is this? Are you tired?� she
asked him and opened her eyes to look straight at him, without even a glimpse
at her body. She saw him standing in front of her, naked, with stalks dripping
blood but without a single drop of sweat on him. �Or am I boring you?� he
smiled at her braveness and kissed her lips. 

&nbsp;

�You already are a bloody mess Isobel;
I don�t need to go further. I have proven what I wanted. Whipping you harder
will offer nothing, believe me.� He said and kissed her
again. He switch placed with the girls which were kneeling in front of Isobel.
She lowered her head and looked at them. 

&nbsp;

�Go on, I know you want to.� She told
them and girls dived again on her body. 

&nbsp;

Byron kissed her neck from behind and
Isobel gasped. She tried to move her body backwards to feel him more but being
tied didn�t offer much help. The girls licked her feet first then moved upwards
were they split up. One girl went for the thighs the other for the breasts.
They worked their way to the same target though; her pussy. Isobel felt Byron
getting hard and her feet trembling from the pair of tongues that were
competing on who will lick her clit. Byron tapped lightly at the girls� heads
ordering them to stand up, much to Isobel�s disappointment. Byron got in front
of Isobel and felt her body for a little. Then he rubbed his dick on her thighs
and put the tip on her pussy. Isobel gasped and tried to bring her body forward.
The girls started licking her body, biting her ass and her neck. 

&nbsp;

Byron entered Isobel�s pussy with slow
moves and Isobel let out a sigh of relief. She raised her legs and put them
around his waist while the girls untied her hands. The girls led her arms
around his neck and after kissing her neck again; they bowed their heads and
left the room. Isobel heard that and smiled. She wasn�t ashamed of them, after
all it was too late to feel like that, but she wanted to be alone with Byron.
He carried her to the bed where she let her fall gently, like a baby. He kissed
her lips and began moving in and out again. Isobel�s grip got stronger and she
had joined his rhythm. After a while she unhooked her legs from his waist and
put with his. She took her hands of his neck and put them on his face. Byron
stopped for a few seconds and looked in her eyes. She had tears in her eyes. 

&nbsp;

�I�ve never been this happy Byron, my
vampire, my Lord.� She said bringing the same smile in his face. He lowered his
lips and kissed hers, then her eyes tasting the tears, then her lips again. Her
smile brought such happiness in his heart, he never thought possible to
experience. 

&nbsp;

�Make love to me my Prince of Darkness�
she told him pulling him closer and burying her face in his neck. 

&nbsp;

Byron started moving again, slow in the
beginning then faster and faster. He put his hand under her back and rolling
his body to the right brought her on top of him. Her face was still buried in
his neck. Her hands were still behind his back. After a while her hands left
his back and went for his chest. She moved her body back and forth on his dick.
He put his hands on her shoulders and raised her body. He felt her perfect
breasts while she caressing his stomach. But they never lost their rhythm. It
was getting faster by the minute and they were both close to a much wanted
orgasm. Byron had focused on her nipples and Isobel was almost jumping up and
down on him. It didn�t take long for them to get their wanted. A couple more
minutes and Byron came inside Isobel; his sperm triggering her own orgasm that
made her collapse on his chest. They both trembled and stayed there for a
little longer. When they had both finally relaxed, Isobel raised her head and
with blissful eyes kissed his lips. 

&nbsp;

�Get some rest my Lady� he told her and
returned her kiss. Isobel put her head on his neck and her hands on his chest.
Byron used his left hand to slightly massage her neck and rested his right hand
on her left foot. Isobel sigh and lack of movement told him of her surrender to
Morpheus. He tried to do the same not wanting to think of that night�s upcoming
events. He only hoped it would be the last of his fights.
