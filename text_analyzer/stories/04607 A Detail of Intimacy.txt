A Detail of Intimacy �
Part 1

&nbsp;

&quot;I've only got the
weekend,� Marie told him. &quot;I'm willing and I want to have this...I need to
find out about you before it's too late.&quot;

&nbsp;

Tom held her to him, his
words a quiet whisper. &quot;You know how it will be. I won't be kind. You will
know that you are mine.&quot;

&nbsp;

She pulled back, staring
into his eyes - counting the lines at the corners, watching his eyes glint in
the moonlight. &quot;I know how it will be. But I know you won't hurt me - not
really&quot; she whispered to him.

&nbsp;

They entered his home hand
in hand, locking the door behind them. He tossed his keys on the coffee table
in the living room and directed her to climb the stairway and wait in his
bedroom.

&nbsp;

She obeyed his command,
their hands parting slowly as if lovers being parted for the last time. He
watched her ascend the stairs, admiring how she carried herself and wondering
if this were the right thing to do.

&nbsp;

They had known each other
since childhood. For long and long they'd had a silent romance, never actually
speaking of it, let alone acting on it. And now, she was leaving for Europe.
Chances were that they were not likely to see each other again. 

&nbsp;

Certainly they would speak
to each other on occasion. But, as it is with most friends separated by long
distances, time and life would come between them. Sure, they would probably see
each other a time or two in the ensuing years. In time, however, they would
have nothing to talk about but old times and old feelings never acted upon.

&nbsp;

And so it was that she
came to him before she departed, exposing herself and her feelings as she had
not before. And he, feeling the fool for never exposing his own feelings,
exposed himself. Sadly, it was too late for them to find more than mutual
feelings and a brief weekend of lovemaking.

&nbsp;

Truth be told, she was
frightened. Over the years they had shared their intimate secrets with each
other. He had told her what few knew and she had done likewise. The contrast was
that, while her intimacies were of a more standard variety, his were just the
opposite. And that was what had kept her from exposing her feelings before. 

&nbsp;

She heard his steps, heavy
and slow, as he ascended the staircase. He appeared in the doorway of the
bedroom carrying a large canvas duffel bag. Inside she suspected were the
&quot;toys&quot; that he had told her about. It was at this moment that she
wondered if she could take a night with him, let alone a weekend.

&nbsp;

Slowly, he walked to the
bed and bent over, placing the bag on the floor. Then he removed his gloves
slowly, placing them on the bag. He sat next to her on the bed and ran his hand
through her sandy curls, his lips brushing her cheek.

&nbsp;

She shivered, goose bumps
covering her skin. She turned, embracing him and kissing him hard on the lips.
Soon they were prone on the bed, embraced as they had imagined so many times
before.

&nbsp;

He rolled over the top of
her and pulled back. &quot;Are you sure?&quot; he asked, hoping she would say
&quot;Yes&quot; and fearing, for her, the consequences.

&nbsp;

&quot;Yes&quot; she
whispered, &quot;I'm sure.&quot;

&nbsp;

As if they were animals,
they began removing each other�s clothing. And soon, they were naked, sweating
and panting, emitting guttural noises. 

&nbsp;

Her hands felt between his
legs, grasping for his member. She gripped his hardness and fought to push it
inside of her, failing as he pulled back. She screamed in frustration, knowing
full well that he was not going to be malleable as her other lovers had been.

&nbsp;

He pulled back from her,
sitting up on his knees between her legs. Leaning forward, he placed his hands
on her breasts, cupping them. Then he ran his hands slowly down her body. She
stiffened as his hands gently brushed her sex and began their descent down her
legs.

&nbsp;

She felt his strength as
his hands stopped at her ankles, grasping them. Too soon, he released her
ankles and stepped off of the bed, kneeling down. She heard the zipper of the
bag as he opened it. Then she got her first glimpse of the rest of her weekend.

&nbsp;

Gently, he cupped the heel
of her left foot and lifted her leg. He slid up underneath her leg, supporting
it with his shoulder. Then he brought a leather cuff to bear, wrapping it
around her ankle. When it was locked on he kissed her foot and gently slid from
under her leg, cupping her heel again, as he lowered it to the bed.

&nbsp;

Her fears of how he would
treat her were almost gone. She knew that she would suffer still, but his
sensual treatment had assured her that she would not be disappointed or
regretful.

&nbsp;

As before, he cupped her
other heel in his hand and lifted her leg up, sliding underneath it to support
it with his thick shoulder. But this time, when her ankle was cuffed he did not
slide from underneath. Instead, he lifted both legs to his shoulder and slid
forward, pushing her legs up and against her body, making her support his
weight.

&nbsp;

&quot;Bring your hands
over your head&quot; he told her, &quot;I've something for your wrists
too.&quot;

&nbsp;

She shivered as he took
her left wrist into his strong hand, her eyes watching his every movement. Then
the leather cuffs he brought to bear were being wrapped around her wrists. 

&nbsp;

His member, hard and
anticipating, lay across her sex and he felt her growing wetness as he locked
the cuffs onto her wrists. Finally, the cuffs secured, he slid his hardness
between her sex, almost entering, only to withdraw and leave her wanting.

&nbsp;

Slowly, he put his full
weight on her, pushing her legs down and against her so that she was doubled
over. Her legs strained at the tightness this caused. Still, she said nothing,
knowing it would do little good. 

&nbsp;

She looked up over her
legs, at his outstretched hands. From the head of his bed he had pulled a short
chain and was attaching it to the cuffs at her wrists. With a light snap, she
knew that her hands were bound up over her. Another moment brought another
snap, and with it the knowledge that her legs had been secured as well.

&nbsp;

She eased into a less
strenuous position as he lifted his weight from her body and returned to the
bag. A moment later found him returning his weight upon her, stretching her yet
again. A leather collar was then placed around her neck. Then he fed a long
leather strap through a ring at the back of her collar and wrapped the end
around her right calf. A quick movement of his hand produced a circular ring,
which fit through the holes of the strap, keeping it snug around her calf. All
too soon, her other calf was similarly imprisoned. When he finally eased off of
her, she was doubled, her legs pressing against her torso.

&nbsp;

He smiled at her and the
obvious strain that she was under. And then, positioning himself at her bottom,
her ran his hands over her stretched legs, admiring the shape of her well-toned
body. 

&nbsp;

After several admiring
moments he leaned down over her and kissed her. She moaned as their tongues
met, his weight adding to her strain. His member, hard and damp, rubbed over
her sex. She wanted him to enter her and told him so. Still, he refrained, his
intentions being to prolong her want and to bring her ecstatic agony.

&nbsp;

Slowly, he ran his lips
down her chin and to her neck, licking and tickling her with his tongue. He
labored there only briefly, moving on to her breasts, pushed together between
her legs. He teased and threatened to tongue and suck her nipples, never once
touching them. And then his lips and tongue brushed the backs of her knees,
first one and then the other. She moaned, needing and wanting more.

&nbsp;

Soon, he was teasing her
inner thighs as he continued down to her sex. Again he teased her, not her
nipples this time but a more sensitive area. Her eyes closed, she screamed out,
begging him to lick her in her most sensitive region. Still, he only teased,
never once licking or touching her most sensitive nub.

&nbsp;

Without warning, he
stopped and she no longer felt his touch. She opened her eyes but could not see
him. She tried to raise her head but found that she was unable to rise up
enough to look around. Frustrated, she called to him and received only a
command to &quot;hush&quot;. Obediently, she quieted and waited.

&nbsp;

She felt his weight before
she saw him, having closed her eyes, frustrated in her excitement. When she
opened her eyes he was settling over her. She stared up at his hard cock as it
came down to settle on her face. She opened her mouth and reached out with her
tongue to lick it but was rebuffed. Immediately she closed her mouth.

&nbsp;

Staring down at her, he
began rubbing his cock across her face, spreading his sticky anticipation
across her. Never experiencing such, she grew red and hot with embarrassed
excitement. Finally, she received his command. Opening her mouth, she took him
into her, sucking him and running her tongue over his hard shaft.� 

&nbsp;

Before long he was
moaning, pushing in and out of her mouth with fast and deep strokes. Her few
moments of distress were of little matter to him. He merely commanded she learn
to take him as he wanted. And so, without choice, she took him as he expected
she would. 

&nbsp;

As she suffered under his
attack, she became amazed at the power of his command. Never before had she
managed to take a man into her throat as she was doing now. That he could will
her to do so was beyond her comprehension. Too, it filled her with a strange
and wonderful excitement.

&nbsp;

He leaned forward,
abruptly, withdrawing his cock from her mouth. She lifted her head, reaching
for him as best she could, mouth open and wanting. He ignored her attempts,
grasping his cock and stroking it with his right hand. Then, as she felt she
might take him back into her mouth, he grasped the hair on top of her head and
held her firmly. In moments, her face was covered with hot and sticky
ejaculate. Spent, he rubbed the viscous stuff across her face, pushing his cock
back into her mouth when he was satisfied with the results. 

&nbsp;

He looked down at her. She
was covered in sweat and semen and her lips were still wrapped around his
softening member, milking him of his last few drops of cum. &quot;Good
girl&quot;, he said to her, filling her with surprisingly pleasant sense of happiness.

&nbsp;

Part 2

&nbsp;

Marie expected that she
would be released from her current position. She was wrong. He had more in
store for her. Furthermore, since he was not one who thought that the goal of
sex or sex play was the ever-important orgasm, he had plans to begin his
torments anew. 

&nbsp;

She watched him as he left
the room, wondering what was in store for her now. Water ran and the toilet
flushed. He began humming some tune that she had heard before but could not
identify. His absence gave her time to think about what had already happened.
While she was uncomfortable, and his cum was still drying on her face, she had
to admit it had so far been an amazing night.�
After a seemingly interminable moment, he returned to the bedroom and
disappeared from her sight.

&nbsp;

She wondered just what it
was that he was doing, rummaging so loudly though his bag of toys. Slowly,
things thumped to the floor, and pinged against each other. The intended
reaction, trepidation, was well met. For, despite her knowing he would never
truly injure her, she had a vivid imagination. Finally, her imagination finding
need of relief, she broke her silence, complaining of the drying cum that
coated her face.

&nbsp;

�I�m sorry, dear�, he told her,
amusement in his voice, �you did tell me that you were
mine for the weekend, if I recall correctly. I don�t think I am quite ready to
remove it.�

&nbsp;

His answer given, she
quieted again, though she did still did not like the feeling of the drying cum
on her face. She also was not yet used to the control
he had over her, though she did not complain again, acknowledging the fact that
she had agreed to his for the weekend. 

&nbsp;

She listened intently to the
sounds emanating from the bag and was startled when the sounds halted. Even
more startling was his sudden weight upon the bed. She raised her head, hoping
to gain sight of his intentions. Then, all of a sudden, she felt a damp
tickling on her inner thigh, so close to her needy sex. She dropped her head
back to the comfort of the mattress, praying for release as his tongue, cool
and threatening, teased her carnal needs. 

&nbsp;

There was an abrupt clicking
and the sound of something vibrating, startling her from her prayers of
release. Then she felt it vibrating and probing lightly over her ass. Each pass
threatened insertion, making her cringe at what he planned. Never before, in
all her years, had she allowed such a thing. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Please, not
there.&quot; Her voice was soft and breathless, her fear of the unknown making
her shake in her restraints. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Have no fear. You will
have to beg for it before you are given such a pleasure.&quot; he whispered
back.

Relieved, she allowed
herself to enjoy the pleasures of his tongue, knowing she would never ask, let
alone beg to be penetrated � not there. 

&nbsp;

Moans escaped her lips as
his tongue continued its torturous journey on her delicate and sensitive skin,
ever finding her most needy areas. She fought to push the sensitive nub of her
sex into his mouth, finding it impossible bound as she was. Soon, she was
filled with a nearly impossible and agonizing need for release. 

&nbsp;

�Please, please�� she cried.
�Please let me cum.�

&nbsp;

&quot;I'm afraid that I
cannot do that. At least, not until you beg for the penetration.&quot; he
whispered.

�Never!� she screamed out,
her fear and disgust still overriding her need to cum. 

&nbsp;

For long and long, he
continued his pleasure filled torture of the girl. Her moans, loud and long,
soon turned to screams and then demands for release. Tom did feel a pang of
guilt as he listened to her screams, but it did not deter him. He continued his
efforts, enjoying every stage of her suffering. 

&nbsp;

After a time, tears began a
steady stream from her eyes. Her moans were less audible, as were her tortured
screams. Her demands were now pleas, begging him to let her cum, promising him
anything. 

&nbsp;

Then there came a voice. It
was her voice and yet it was not. She listened, afraid of what it was saying
even as she knew what it would say - what it was about to say.

&nbsp;

&quot;Not good enough&quot;
she heard him reply. &quot;I want you to ask in a way where there can be no
mistaking what you are begging for. I want no excuses or confusion
later.&quot;� It was then that she knew
she could no longer fight him. 

&nbsp;

She heard the voice again.
It was low and shaky, defeated. &quot;Please push the vibrator in my ass.&quot;

&nbsp;

Slowly, she felt the
vibrator pushing into her ass. She cringed at the feeling - at the idea and the
degradation. Then, as she so wanted, his tongue found the depths of her sex,
probing into her and wriggling its way about. She hardly noticed the tightness
of her posterior as the vibrator was fully seated inside of her. For, as he
pushed the vibrator in, his mouth made its way to the sensitive nub that would
release her from her anguish and leave her helpless in the throws of an intense
orgasm. She screamed out.

&nbsp;

Her first orgasm subsiding,
he began thrusting the vibrator in and out of her ass. He tugged at her nub,
sucking it into his mouth in alternate rhythm to the vibrator. She screamed
again, another orgasm coursing through her body. Unsatisfied with bringing her
to two orgasms, he continued his work, sucking her nub and fucking her ass with
the vibrating phallus. 

&nbsp;

Over and over she came, her
climaxes increasing in strength until she feared her own demise. Then, as
suddenly as her first orgasm had arrived, it was over. She hardly noticed as he
reached up over her body to release her from her strict bondage. She only knew
that the strain had been lifted and that she was exhausted. 

&nbsp;

Once her breath had returned
to her, he pulled her against him, �spooning� her. He smiled at her as she
turned her head to stare into his eyes. A kiss, a whisper of comfort and a hug
was all they mustered before falling into a deep and happy sleep.

A Detail Of Intimacy -- part
3.� By Aussiegirl and H Dean

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

They slept together for a
while. She was braced against him, being &quot;spooned&quot; while his arms
were wrapped around her. And when finally she woke and turned her head, she saw
him sleeping contentedly, a smile on his face. And she, too, smiled despite the
odd sensation that she noted in her posterior.

&nbsp;

She tried to turn over to
expel the invader that remained inside of her from their earlier lovemaking,
waking him. He simply told her &quot;No.&quot; Still, she tried to force it
out, prompting him to raise his hand and smack her rear end. His slap, though
not hard, was enough to remind her where she was and her promise to be his for
the weekend. She lay still , memories of what they had done filling her
mind.� 

&nbsp;

After a short time, he
allowed her to roll over and face him. This was when he explained to her that
she was not to attempt to expel the object and that if it came out, due to its
shape, it would be obvious that she had forced or pulled it out. She nodded, a
feeling she could not identify filling her.�
However, she was too tired to try and work out what it was, and soon
they were both asleep again.

&nbsp;

It was late in the evening
when next they woke. Both of them were famished and in need of a hot shower.
Without so much as a word he took her by the hand and guided her to the
bathroom. As the room began to fill with steam, he kissed her, pulling her to
him. His hand slid down her backside to the vibrator that was imbedded in her
ass as far as its base, which was shaped to prevent further entrance. He pushed
it gently and received a welcome moan and a few complaints from her.

&nbsp;

&quot;Remember, you wear
this for me&quot; he whispered before taking her into the shower.� She hated to admit it, even to herself, but
there was something she liked about wearing the plug.� When he had told her that she wore it for
him, she had felt that same feeling she had felt noticed earlier. It gave her a
warm glow, despite the humiliation she still felt. 

&nbsp;

The warm water on her body
brought her back to the present and she looked up to see Tom smiling at her. He
gently pulled her to him again, kissing her deeply as his hands began to rub a
beautifully scented soap into her.� She
felt herself relax into him, his kiss and his hands becoming her whole
existence.� When his fingers reached down
to rub her moist pussy, she moaned into his mouth.� 

&nbsp;

Tom broke off their kiss,
seeing the far away look in her eyes.� He
took her hands in his own, and squeezed some of the liquid soap into her
hands.� It didn�t take her long to start
to rub her hands over his body, enjoying the feel of his muscles flexing under
her hands.� Having done his upper body,
she lowered herself to her knees,�
soaping up his legs.� All the
while she smiled as his cock� flinched,
and she looked up at him to see if she would be allowed to give him some
relief.� 

&nbsp;

He smiled down at her,
taking her hand in his and placing it on his cock.� He leant back against the wall of the shower,
closing his eyes as her hand worked up and down.� Marie resisted the urge to take him into her
mouth, instead enjoying the� temporary
control she had over him.� It didn�t take
long until his cum was spurting onto her breasts, the water then washing it
away.� 

&nbsp;

She felt his hand in her
hair, pulling her up to her feet, as he again kissed her.� Her legs felt weak as his tongue played with
hers.� When he broke of the kiss, he
turned off the water and opened the door to retrieve two towels. And then, as
they had washed each other, they dried each other, both seeming to not want to
loose the sensual feeling of the shower just yet.

&nbsp;

Returning to the bedroom,
they began to get dressed to go out and eat. He insisted she wear a short black
skirt and her black high-heeled shoes with no hose, despite the chill in the
air outside. She was also assigned to wearing a tight white blouse with no bra.
Despite her hesitancy, she was excited at his orders, knowing that this was the
weekend for living out some of her fantasies too. 

&nbsp;

As soon as they had readied
themselves for a night out he presented her with a tiny item that he insisted
she wear. She eyed the small device, wondering exactly what it was and what it
was for. Understanding her confusion he told her to pull down her� panties and he would apply the tiny device.
As she complied, he explained the device to her.

&nbsp;

&quot;These three tiny
clamps&quot; he explained, &quot;attach to you. One attaches to your clitoris
and the other two to your labia. As you can see, &quot; he continued,
&quot;This short end slides partially inside you.&quot;

&nbsp;

She cringed, wondering how
painful it would be. Still, she thought, she had agreed to be his for the
entire weekend and to obey him. And, so far as she could see, there was little
to regret or that she had not enjoyed, other than the minor discomfort she felt
and was still feeling in her ass.

&nbsp;

The sensation of the clamps
was a bit startling at first. It pinched slightly but did not cause her more
than a tiny moment of pain. �Good girl, you are doing very well Marie.�� She felt a sense of achievement� at his words and loved to see the pride in
his eyes. It somehow made her feel determined to do her very best to please
him.� 

&nbsp;

As she pulled up her panties
again, she was surprised to find she could hardly feel the clamps and she was
able to forget about them.� In fact, as
she gave her appearance a final glance in the mirror, she could see a twinkle
in her eye, knowing what she was secretly wearing.�� 

&nbsp;

They gathered their coats and
headed out into the cold night air. The restaurant that he was taking her to
was within walking distance, he explained. So, arm in arm, they strolled to his
favorite eatery, quietly chattering about the night. She had worried that she
might be a disappointment to him, and wondered if their lovemaking had been
truly satisfying. He assured her that it was satisfying and that he was far
from disappointed. And, he related, he hoped that she was receiving as much
gratification as he was. She assured him that she was.

&nbsp;

A few blocks down the street
he pulled her into a darkened alley and pushed her to her knees, commanding she
pleasure him.

&nbsp;

&quot;Here?&quot; she asked,
startled and looking around nervously. &quot;This is a public alley, someone
will see us!&quot; she said, her warm breath fogging the air.

&nbsp;

&quot;Here.&quot; he stated.
&quot;The faster you do this the less chance of being seen. So, get to
work.&quot;

&nbsp;

Moments later, after looking
around nervously, she unzipped his fly and pulled out his member, already hard
with anticipation. She had been more than a bit shocked at his request, but by
the tone of his voice she knew he meant business.� Drawing in a breath, she closed her eyes and
pushed her mouth down over him, sucking him.

&nbsp;

He watched her head bob back
and forth, enjoying the vision of her lips sliding over his cock. He was
pleased by her skill, noticing how she used her tongue to flick over the tip of
his cock as she pulled back and then how she pressed it up against him as she
pushed forward.

&nbsp;

His hands slipped to her
head, pushing her down onto him and his cock to the back of her throat. Already
primed for his roughness, she endured, fighting off her gag reflex and taking
him into her throat with each downward thrust of her head.

&nbsp;

His orgasm built quickly.
Then, at the final moment, he pulled her from his cock, grabbing her hair and
holding her head upturned and steady in front of his cock. His free hand
grasped his cock and stroked through his orgasm, spewing semen across her face
and into her opened mouth.

&nbsp;

She closed her eyes, helpless
in the moment, feeling the warmth of his cum splatter on her face and into her
mouth. When he was done, she opened her eyes to see him standing over her. She
moved not an inch as he began rubbing his cock across her face, spreading his
semen.

&nbsp;

Again, he pressed his cock
into her mouth, pushing her down on him. He held her steady and hard against
him. Her lips pressed against his body as he grew steadily softer, slowly and
mercifully withdrawing from her throat.

&nbsp;

He pulled her up and spun
them around, pushing her up against the alley wall. His body leaned against
hers as he pushed his cock back into his pants, zipping them. Then, grasping
her hair again, he pulled her head back and whispered in her ear, &quot;You
have my mark for the evening, do not clean it off.&quot; 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;














Marie was thankful that the restaurant was dark

A Detail of Intimacy� - Part Four

&nbsp;

By Aussiegirl and H Dean

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Marie was thankful that the restaurant was dark. She was
very aware of the &quot;mark&quot; that Tom had left on her and was certain
that everyone else was quite aware of it, as well. She felt embarrassed enough
at not fighting him cumming on her face but the thought of everyone seeing and
knowing, was almost too much for her to take!�


&nbsp;

They were led to a table in the corner and she sat for
a moment without speaking, quietly embarrassed at her facial covering. Her head
was filled with all of the things she should have done, but more so at her
anger at him for doing this to her.� She
watched him calmly give the waiter their order, not even worrying that he was
ordering for her.� The less the waiter
looked her way the better.� Inside her
head she thought of what she wanted to say to him, her anger growing as he
chatted and laughed with the waiter, seeming to want to keep him at the table.� 

&nbsp;

Finally, after the waiter had gone, she spoke.
&quot;How the hell can you do this to me? Do you have any idea how embarrassing
this is?&quot;� Her voice was shaking,
her hands clenched under the table. 

&nbsp;

He smiled at her. &quot;It may be embarrassing, but
you are doing it...and you are enjoying it no matter what you say.&quot;

&nbsp;

Inflamed, she stood up. &quot;That's enough, I'm going
to the bathroom and I am going to wash this shit off of my face!&quot; she
exclaimed in a whispered yell.� She saw
his eyes change from smiling to serious, and felt a flutter in her
stomach.� 

&nbsp;

He shot out a hand, grabbing her wrist. &quot;Be very
aware&quot; he started, &quot;I will not stop you. But I will stop all of this.
You agreed to this weekend and you agreed to being
mine. If you do this, nothing more will happen.&quot;

&nbsp;

She looked away, briefly, the thought of not
continuing the weekend overriding her shame. Then, exhaling, she sat down
again. &quot;Damn you.&quot; she whispered.�
She couldn�t look at him, her emotions a jumble and tears just
threatening to flow.� She played with her
skirt, pretending to smooth it down, but really she just needed to try to stop
her hands from shaking. 

&nbsp;

She had always hated confrontations, but she
especially hated to fight with Tom.�
Despite their changed status, he was still the Tom she had known and
loved all her life, and she knew they both deserved to
see where the weekend might take them.

&nbsp;

Tom watched her face, seeing her struggling to come to
terms with her decision.� He knew he was
pushing her, but he knew too that for her to be able to get through the rest of
weekend, she needed to accept his control over her.� He also knew she needed a distraction right
now. 

&nbsp;

Smiling, he reached into his jacket pocket and
withdrew a small item and sat it on the table�s edge in front of him. She made
only a minor note of it thinking it his remote for his car alarm. Then, picking
it up, he pressed one of the small black buttons. Immediately, she felt a
vibration between her legs.

&nbsp;

Her eyes wide, she looked at him. &quot;You son of a
bitch!&quot; she grinned. Despite her previous misgivings, she began to enjoy
the feelings the vibrations were causing.�
She saw him smile at her, his fingers hovering over the small device,
and she wondered what he had in mind for her next.� 

&nbsp;

Then he pressed another of the buttons and the
vibrations became more intense. She lowered her head, looking out across the
restaurant and whispered for him to stop. He pressed a third button and the
vibrations became a more staccato intermittent buzz.

&nbsp;

Her hands slid down between her legs and pressed to
her crotch, hoping to dull the effects. Instead, it increased the sensation and
she quickly pulled her hands back away. Very soon she could feel herself become
wet and she begged him to stop again.

&nbsp;

The vibrator was still buzzing away when the waiter
came with their food. Feeling sure that the waiter would notice, she begged Tom
silently to stop, her eyes wide as the food was placed in front of them.
Immediately after the food was served, he stopped the buzzing. She grinned at
him as the waiter walked away, chastising him for torturing her that way.

&nbsp;

For the remainder of their time at the restaurant she
was forced to endure the excitement of the buzzing whenever a waiter or bus boy
came to the table. And, though she was uncomfortable and embarrassed, certain
that everyone near her knew her plight, she never once got upset or failed to
see the humor in his actions.� It was
like she had remembered it was meant to be fun and just allowed herself to
relax and enjoy the feelings he was giving her.�
Before long, they were walking back to his home, laughing and joking. 

&nbsp;

Again they came upon the alley, her heart thumping in
her chest as she saw it.� Again he pushed
her into it. This time, instead of making her perform on him, he pushed her
against the wall. Then tearing open her coat and
shirt, he mauled her naked breasts, sucking and squeezing them with intense and
hurried passion, the vibrator humming away. She was sure she was going to cum,
but instead of being shocked that she could easily cum in the middle of a dirty
alley, she was worried he would not let her cum!

&nbsp;

As her orgasm was upon her, he stopped the buzzing.
She heard a moan of frustration, realizing with some surprise it had come from
her.� He kissed her fiercely, closing her
shirt and coat, pulling her from the alley way and making her walk back to his
home, unfulfilled and frustrated. They said not a word as they walked onward,
towards his home, her mind spinning with what else he might have in store for
her.�

A Detail of Intimacy -�� By Aussiegirl and H Dean� -�
Part 5

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Finally they arrived at his door. As Tom reached into
his pocket to retrieve his keys, he pushed the button that started the humming
between her legs. This time, however, the humming came from the nearly
forgotten vibrator that resided in her ass. 

&nbsp;

Maria�s legs turned to jelly and she collapsed into
him, his arms coming up to hold her. Her head lolled back and he stared into
her eyes, smiling a mischievous smile. Then, he righted her and opened the
door, one arm still around her.

&nbsp;

Once across the threshold he pushed her against the
vestibule wall. He kissed her and then withdrew his lips from hers. Wrapping
his right arm around her again, he guided her to the sofa in his front room.

&nbsp;

Slowly, he lifted her right foot to his shoulders,
kissing her ankle as he removed the black heel from her tiny foot. Gently, he
sat her naked foot on the cold wood floor and taking up her other foo, he repeated his every action, letting her shoe drop on
the hard floor, to echo through the room.

&nbsp;

She was breathless. The vibrator in her ass was,
accompanied by the vibrations of the other &quot;toy&quot;, bringing her close
to orgasm.� Again, she neared climax only
to have the vibrations cut short, her breathing ragged as they both stopped,
leaving he feeling like she wanted to beg him for more.

&nbsp;

He began to move his hands up both of her legs in
simultaneous caresses. Before long his hands were pushing up her skirt and
reaching between her legs, massaging the soft flesh of her inner thigh. His
fingers brushed the small device that clamped to her sex. She groaned and
arched her back at the tiny sensation.

&nbsp;

He sat up, pulling his hands away and commanded she
sit up and remove the coat that she had been wearing. She tried to cover herself,
embarrassed at having her breasts fall out of the torn blouse, only to receive
a gentle slap on her hands. And then, even more embarrassed, she relented,
allowing her breast to fall from the torn garment as she removed her coat.

&nbsp;

He leaned in to her and kissed her, open mouthed. His
hands clasped hers, holding her arms out wide as he forced her back against the
couch, still kissing. And when they parted, she remained, arms outstretched,
her breasts and stomach exposed.

&nbsp;

Her eyes fluttered and then shut as the vibrations
began again between her legs and in her ass. Again, he slipped his hands
between her legs, massaging the softest flesh of her thighs and flicking his
thumb against the vibrator that had control of her sex.

&nbsp;

As the vibrators shut off her eyes flickered open and
she cried out, frustrated that he would not allow her satisfaction. He was grinning, her panties in his hand, displaying that he had
removed them without her notice. Smiling up at him, she crossed her arms in
mock anger.

&nbsp;

&quot;How the hell did you do that?&quot; she laughed.

&nbsp;

Dropping her panties to the floor he displayed his
fingers, grinning.

&nbsp;

&quot;Magic&quot; he shot back at her grinning even
wider.

&nbsp;

She shot off of the couch to embrace him, sitting on
his knees. He threw her back to the couch after a brief kiss. Then, leaning
himself down onto her, he took her breasts in hand, sucking and kissing them.
His tongue flicked here and there. He bit and sucked her nipples eliciting
groans of pleasure mixed with minor pain.

&nbsp;

He leaned back and flipped her over, tugging roughly
at her skirt, pulling down her body, not allowing her feet or knees solid
purchase. She screamed as the skirt hooked the device on her sex. Still, he did
not relent until she was free of her skirt.

&nbsp;

Flipping her over as if she were a paper-weight, he
pulled her to him, kissing her fiercely. He stood up, taking her entire weight
onto him and lifting her from her feet, his tongue warring with hers. And then
he sat her on her feet only to whisk her from them and trod up the stairs to his
bedroom, once again.

&nbsp;

She buried her face in his neck as they traversed the
staircase. She was crying and did not want him to see her and think that
something was wrong. She was happy and excited and frustrated and crying was
her only outlet since he would not let her cum.

&nbsp;

And then, they were in his room. It was dark and she
could only see the ominous shadows of light that peaked into the room from the
light outside. 

&nbsp;

He sat her on something hard - not too hard, but
harder than the bed. His lips met hers again and he told her not to move as he
pulled from her. She tried to see what it was that he was doing but could only
see brief glimpses, her eyes still not adjusted to the darkness.

&nbsp;

Then, he was in front of her, taking her hand in his.
He led her only steps from where she had been and commanded she fall to her
knees. Then, he lay her over something. It was soft -
padded - but firm. She rested her weight on the small seat-like support as he
pushed her forward. As her body became perpendicular he reached under her chin
and raised it, sitting it in something that was obviously made for a persons
chin.

&nbsp;

He pulled her right hand from the floor and attached a
carribeaner to the cuff at her wrist and then repeated the same action with the
other hand. Soon, her ankles were both pulled out wide, just as her hands had
been. Now, her only contact with the floor was the very tip of her toes.

&nbsp;

Then, he lit up a candle and began to explain her
current situation.

&nbsp;

&quot;As you may have noticed, your weight is resting
entirely on your pelvis and chin.&quot; he said. &quot;Your
arms and legs have been outstretched and attached to the metal &quot;legs&quot;
on my little &quot;spider bench. The idea is minimal bondage and maximum
exposure. I hope you enjoy what is about to happen.&quot;

&nbsp;

She was frustrated that, though she could see now, she
could not look around to witness the device or his actions. She tried to speak
but found more frustration in the fact that she could hardly move her jaw.

&nbsp;

He watched as she tensed,
panic welling up in her, never having been bound before their previous
lovemaking. So, kneeling down in front of her and in a soothing voice, he said
&quot;I know that this must be a bit scary for you. Just remember, I won't hurt
you. I would never hurt you.&quot; Then he stood and left her sight.

&nbsp;

His words were like a soothing salve on burned skin,
instantly relieving but not completely healing. She knew that he had a sadistic
streak and that she was likely to feel some pain. She had expected that he
would tie her to the bed and maybe even a chair or something. This was not,
however, anything that she had thought of.

&nbsp;

The cold gel hit her back making her jump and squeal.
Moments later his hands were upon her, rubbing away the cold and relaxing her.
Soon, her body was covered in the thick gel, his hands massaging it into her
skin. When he was finished she was nearly asleep, glowing dully in the
candlelight.

&nbsp;

Her eyes were closed and she felt as if she could
sleep, even bound as she was, when she felt a tickling on her back. She moaned
at the sensation, enjoying it, never imagining that she was nearing her first
experience with the pain a deerskin cat-o-nine whip can bring.

&nbsp;

The whip struck her bottom bringing her back from her
dreamlike state. He did not strike her hard, merely enough to sting slightly.
He followed the soft strike with more of the sensual tickling of her back only
to strike again, moments later, making her jerk.

&nbsp;

She was fully aware now, wondering what he had
planned. Another strike stung her posterior followed by more tickling of her
back. The strikes became more frequent and then constant with no soft moments
in between. She moaned with the pain she was receiving, unsure of her situation
and wondering if and how she should react.

&nbsp;

Behind her, he stood, striking her with soft and
measured strokes, never letting up and gradually striking her with more force.
He watched as her ass began changing to a rosy hue under his expert strokes. By
now there was little time between strokes as he alternated from cheek to rosy
cheek.

&nbsp;

A moan escaped her lips as he began striking her
thighs, first one and then the other. He was not striking her hard, only enough
to redden her skin and sting slightly. Still, she was unsure of what she should
do. And then he stopped. 

&nbsp;

Her eyes were shut when she felt his breath on her
face. When she opened her eyes his face was directly in front of hers and he
was whispering to her to let go. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Stop worrying&quot; he told her, &quot;you've no
choice in this matter...so let it go.&quot;

&nbsp;

And then, as he resumed his work, something in her
clicked and she stopped worrying about how to react or what to do. At that
moment she heard nothing - saw nothing. She could feel only the distant sting
of the whip as it struck her thighs and ass. 

&nbsp;

Goose bumps lept to her skin, despite the heat of the
room and the sweat on her body. She began to shiver, her mind wandering to
pastures green and vivid. She felt a wave of warmth come over her and she
drifted further. She could see him somehow, in her mind�s eye as he welded the
whip across her body.

&nbsp;

Somewhere in her haze, she felt her legs being
released from their bondage. They were under her, even as her arms remained
stretched outward. Her ass felt suddenly empty and she realized that he must
have pulled the vibrator out. Then again, she felt something larger push into
her ass.

&nbsp;

She wanted to scream, but could not. Her voice had
left her and would not have obeyed anyway. Hands grasped her tiny waist and the
invader pulled back from her ass only to return an instant later. Her ass felt
full and tight, never having had anything pushed into her before the vibrator.

&nbsp;

She snapped to full consciousness, fully aware of her
situation. It was him inside of her, stroking his cock back and forth in her
ass. She was not suffering pain but only a minor discomfort. Too, she enjoyed
the feeling of his strong hands wrapped around her waist. A part of her wanted
him to stop, to withdraw from her and stop this uncomfortable and unnatural
assault. Still, a part of her wanted him to fill her ass with his semen.

&nbsp;

For him, he was living out a fantasy that he had never
thought to see in reality. He had fantasized about taking her, binding her and
beating her for many years, never hoping to make his wish come true. Yet,
somehow, he was here with her, the one girl he never hoped to have. And she was
his, to do with as he wanted.

&nbsp;

His strokes became more powerful and he began slamming
into her with each forward stroke. She moaned at his hard use of her. Still,
she wanted him to stop, not knowing why. And still, she wanted him to continue,
to finish inside of her.

&nbsp;

He leaned down over her, his cock still imbedded in
her ass, and began fondling her large breasts. He squeezed them and pinched her
nipples, making her wince and moan. 

&nbsp;

A�
sudden warmth washed over her again and she felt a pressure
building inside of her. She could not allow herself to cum this way, she
thought. She was sure that his wrongful treatment of her ass could not bring
her to climax. It was not possible. Still, she could not deny the feeling it
was bringing her.

&nbsp;

She climaxed, clamping herself around his pounding
member, causing her to suffer the pain that she knew she should feel. It did
not dampen the pleasure, instead making it grow to an
intensity that she had not felt before. Several times she climaxed, each
time more intense and painful than before.

&nbsp;

Then, just as she thought she could take no more, he
moaned loudly and plunged into her. She cried out with the pain as his own
orgasm sent his body into spasmodic jerking. And as the final spasms of his
pleasure died down and his juices flowed into her, she found herself in the
throws of another orgasm.

&nbsp;

He lay down on top of her sweat-covered body, his cock
growing soft inside of her. His gentle kisses on her back made her shiver
raising goose bumps yet again. And when his cock finally slid from her ass, she
felt a strange and sad emptiness and she wished that he could remain inside of
her for forever.

&nbsp;

He stood up, tired and spent. Then he released her
arms from their bondage and helped her up to sit on the bed. She was sore and
tired and in need of a shower, however, she was far too tired, both emotionally
and physically. Together they shimmied up the bed where they fell asleep in
each other�s arms.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

A Detail of Intimacy - Part 6� by Aussiegirl
and H Dean 

&nbsp;

Morning came all too soon. The light of the day crept
in on the sparsely decorated bedroom. Marie looked up to see the heavy and
large headboard and then over at Tom, still asleep. Carefully, she slipped from
his grasp and headed to the shower.

&nbsp;

Just as she stepped off of the bed, she realized that
she would go nowhere soon. The collar around her neck, she found, was chained
to the headboard. He must have chained her when she was asleep, she thought.
Still, she needed a shower and her bladder was demanding relief.

&nbsp;

He woke to her kisses, returning them groggily.
&quot;Will you unchain me so I can use the bathroom and take a shower?&quot;
she asked the sleepy man.

&nbsp;

He shook his head &quot;No&quot; and threw the covers
from him revealing a cock that seemed impossibly hard. She grinned and slid
down his body to take his cock into her mouth. 

&nbsp;

He watched as her head bobbed up and down on his
shaft, enjoying the sight. Slowly, she stroked his
cock with her hand even as her lips travelled the full length of his engorged
member. He marvelled at her abilities, wondering how a girl as prude as she
was, could be so adapt at cock sucking. 

&nbsp;

Quickly, his orgasm built until he could wait no
longer. Grasping her hair in both hands, he pushed her down onto him and filled
her mouth with his hot semen. Finally, spent and satisfied,
he loosened his grip and let her slide from his shaft. As he had hoped, she had
swallowed every drop of his semen.

&nbsp;

She ran into the bathroom, barely able to make it
without having an accident. She hollered at him for making her wait so long.
Still, his command of her and how he made her feel filled her with a warmth that no man had managed to fill her with before.
And when she climbed into the shower, washing the
dried sweat from her, she wondered why it was that she must leave for Europe
and why she could not stay with him.

&nbsp;

The shower door opening ripped her from her daydream.
He stepped into the steamy shower, kissing her as he closed the door. Almost
immediately they were holding each other, their lips pressed hard together.

&nbsp;

After towelling dry, they dressed. This time, he did
not allow her to wear one of her own garments. Instead, he pulled a thin chain
from a box in his closet and wrapped it around her waist, fastening it with a
lock. Then, he pulled what appeared to her to be two sheer silk scarves from
the box and draped them over the chain, one in front and one in back. 

&nbsp;

He provided her with some sort of silky slippers, as
well, insisting she wear them. And, when she looked at herself in the mirror
she noted that she had taken on the appearance of a slave girl of some long
forgotten culture.

&nbsp;

It was he that noted that the sheer silk, which hung
from the chains hid very little. So, handing her a razor and some shaving cream
he suggested she shave the dark hair between her legs. Blushing, she took the
razor and headed into the bathroom, wondering that she could be so easily
persuaded to this action. Removing the sheer material from the front of her
pussy, she applied a layer of cream and began the job he had set her.� Her pussy lips were a bit tender from the
night before, the memory of it making her wet, as well as causing her to blush.
.� 

&nbsp;

How was it possible that she had reacted the way she
had?� She had always loved him but she
never thought she would be here, removing something she had taken such pride
in.� Even when other lovers had asked
her, she had never let them convince her to shave her pussy. Now all he had to
do was ask once and here she was!� 

&nbsp;

The razor slid over her pussy, the feel of the air on
her now bare skin strangely enticing. When all the hair was gone, she looked in
the mirror, shocked by how different she looked.� She ran her hand over the smooth skin, amazed
at how it felt. Suddenly she understood what all the fuss was about. 

&nbsp;

He stood in the doorway, watching her run her hand
over her bare pussy.� He was still amazed
that not only was she still here but that she had done as he had asked with no
qualms.� Suddenly she noticed him and he
smiled as the blush covered her cheeks. He ran his hand over her pussy, pleased
that she had done such a good job.� He
could hear her breathing getting short as he continued to rub and as he pulled
his hand away, she squealed in what he knew was frustration.� 

&nbsp;

�Oh no, my dear, it will be a while before you get to
have that pleasure today.�� She pouted as
he pulled his hand away, handing her the material to return to the chain around
her waist.� He thought about what he had
planned for that day, knowing that some of it would be a challenge. When she
had the sheer silk back in place, he took her by the arm and led her into a
room she hadn�t seen before.� 

&nbsp;

She looked at the room, surprised by what she saw. She
had expected ropes or chains but not this.�
The room was decorated in red and gold, giant cushions covering half the
floor.� As he led her further into the
room, she felt like she was some slave being led into the King�s harem. She was
startled as he reached out to touch her breast, her mind having drifted off to
the many stories she had read about such things. He took hold of her nipple and
squeezed, gently at first but then more firmly until she had to yell out. 

&nbsp;

He looked into her eyes as he squeezed her other
nipple, seeing a tear form as he twisted the nipple even harder.� Letting go, he saw her start to bring her
hands up but one look from him made her return them to her sides.� He smiled at how quickly she was learning and
brought the clamp up to her nipple, eager to see her reaction.� He held the clamp over her nipple, seeing her
eyes widen in surprise and curiosity.� It
was not till he started to close the clamp did he see her start to register
what he was doing.

&nbsp;

Looking down, she could see the clamp hanging from her
breast.� She flinched as he pulled her
other nipple out before applying the other clamp. They didn�t really hurt too
much and she thought she could handle them for a while.� However, when he pulled out what looked to be
a weight with a hook on the end, she started to wonder just how much pain he
would expect her to take.� 

&nbsp;

The way the nipple was pulled down by the weight made
her scream, the other nipple suffering the same fate.� He flicked them with his finger, causing more
pain and moved her to look at her reflection in the mirror on the wall. What
she saw managed to take her mind of the pain for a moment, as she saw herself
like never before.� 

&nbsp;

Gone were the designer clothes, the fancy hairstyles,
instead she felt like she was looking into her own soul.� She knew that whatever else she did in her
life, she would always remember this moment.�
Music started to play from somewhere in the room, lilting and romantic;
like the music a slave might have danced to. 

&nbsp;

�Dance for me.� His voice whispered in her ear and she
turned away from the mirror to face him.�
He had already moved to lean back on a pile of cushions as she closed
her eyes to let the music flow through her.�
She had spent countless hours as a young girl in all forms of dance
classes but never had she felt so free.

&nbsp;

He watched as she moved gracefully in front of him,
her hips swaying.� She seemed lost in the
music, her body moving in time to the rhythm.�
He felt his cock swell as he watched her, his own harem slave.� Finally he could stand it no longer and
taking her hand, pulled her down to the cushion beside him. Gripping her hair
firmly, he pulled her onto his cock, hearing her gag as she attempted to
accommodate him.� He didn�t let up,
working her head up and down, faster and faster, until he exploded into her
throat.� 

&nbsp;

She had been stunned by his sudden action, her throat
aching as he pulled her head off his cock and sat her up.� She felt a pull on her nipples and looked to
see that he had added another round weight to both of the clamps. Fighting the
urge to pull them off, she couldn�t stop the tears that rolled down her
cheeks.� He brushed them away and stood
her up again, the movement only causing her more pain.� 

&nbsp;

�Please Tom, it hurts.� He simply smiled and turned
the music up louder, till she somehow knew she would have to dance some more
before he would take them off.� She tried
to get back the feelings from before, but this time the pain radiating through
her breasts was too great.� Though her
body still moved in time to the music, the joy she had felt earlier was no
longer there.� Finally he turned the
music off and came to stand before her.�
Hope that he would now remove the clamps faded as he pulled out a length
of silk rope and turned her around, tying her wrists together.� 

&nbsp;

He could see that she wanted the weights off but he
was not ready to do so yet.� He had so
many thoughts of what he could do and knew that this might be the only chance
he got to live out his dreams.� He bent
her over so that her upper body was perpendicular to the floor, the weights
pulling her nipples down towards the ground.�
He fixed her feet in place to rings he had in the floor and went to
lower the hook he had in the ceiling.�
She looked up at the sound of the hook being lowered, her eyes wide and
wet with tears.� Pulling her arms up, he
tied the end of the rope to the hook, forcing her to bend over even further. 

&nbsp;

His final touch was to pull a ball gag out of his
pocket. At first she shook her head, but after a few flicks on the weights, she
opened her mouth to let him slip the gag in.�
He didn�t pull it as tight as he could have, but still she whimpered as
he lifted her head to look at her. He checked the fit of the gag, making sure
she couldn�t push it out.� Her eyes were
begging him to release her but he wanted to see how long she could take it
for.� Pulling a camera out of his pocket,
he walked around her beautiful, bound body, taking photos of her from different
angles.� He figured if he couldn�t have
her, at least he could have some reminders of the weekend. 

&nbsp;

She didn�t know what the sound was at first but hoped
it wasn�t something else that would hurt her.�
Her nipples were feeling like they were going to be pulled off and she
could see the way they hung down with the weights. She heard the sound again,
this time to her side and was able to see the small digital camera in his
hands.� He moved and took more photos
while she felt the blush rise to cover her cheeks. 

&nbsp;

It was one thing to let him see her
this way but what if he showed someone else. She tired to let him know
she wasn�t happy about the photos, but like most things so far this weekend,
she had no say in what he did. He put the camera back in his pocket and ran his
hand over her back.� She pulled away from
him; her actions making the weights swing again.� Why had she let him do this? She made up her
mind to tell him the weekend was over, when she was able to, no matter how he
reacted.� 

&nbsp;

His hand rubbed along her pussy, his fingers teasing
as they threatened to delve into her. She heard another new sound and wondered
what horrors he had planned for her now.�
Bracing herself for more pain, she moaned as she felt something being
held to her pussy.� She looked through
the sheer fabric hanging down from her waist, to see him holding what looked to
be a vibrator of some sort. The vibrations caused her whole body to shake and
she was surprised to find that though her nipples still hurt,
the blinding pain she had been feeling was gone.� He pulled the vibrator away, making her groan
in frustration.

&nbsp;

He heard her moan and knew he had helped her to last a
little bit longer in her current position.�
Over the next few minutes he repeated holding the vibrator to her pussy,
not to make her cum but to aid her to deal with her pain.� He loved the way her drool dribbled out
around the gag and down her chin before dripping onto the floor. He pulled out
the camera and took a particularly good shot of her showing her eyes looking
desperately at him over her gag, more drool just dripping off her chin. 

&nbsp;

He moved to lower the winch, her arms lowering till
they were resting on her back. She moaned, but tried not to move so that the
weights didn�t swing too much.� He
returned to her side, taking her chin in his hand and looking her directly in
her eyes. �Come on baby, stand up for me.��
She cried as she stood, the weights swinging. He knew he could have
taken them off first but he wanted to see hear her suffer just a little
more.� 

&nbsp;

�Good girl, you know seeing you suffer turns me on so
much.�� She looked at him, her body
aching as she wondered at the kind of person he was.� He moved his hand to her breasts before
finally removing the dangling weights. The removal of the weights was a great
relief and she sighed, thinking her ordeal was almost over.� She wondered at the gleam in his eyes as he
held his hand over the clamp.� He slowly
pressed down on the clamp and removed it, watching her intently as she felt the
pain radiate through her body.� It was
worse than all of the pain she had suffered so far, her body shaking as she
screamed out behind the gag.

&nbsp;

He rubbed her red nipple, feeling her body shaking as
he moved to the other clamp. She looked down at his hand, her head shaking as
he smiled at her.� He pondered whether to
do it slow or to save her some pain and take it off fast.� She had calmed down somewhat and looked at
him with such fear in her eyes that he decided to take pity on her and took the
other one off quickly. Still, she screamed and tears flowed down her face as
the pain worked its way through her body yet again.� As she sobbed, he released her feet and her
hands.� Immediately her hands came up to
rub her nipples, her sobs slowly decreasing.�


&nbsp;

The only thing he had not yet removed was the gag and
she noticed that now her other pains were gone; she could feel her jaw really
starting to ache.� He ran his hands over
her face, brushing away her tears and pushing back her hair.�� She looked into his eyes, remembering all
the times she had secretly wished to be so close to him.� He moved his hands behind her head, as if he
was going to remove her gag, but instead just let them rest there.� 

&nbsp;

�Marie, when I take the gag off, I don�t want you to
speak until I say so.� Nod if you
understand me?�� She nodded, wondering if
she dared to tell him of her decision to end the weekend. Not knowing what her
punishment for speaking would be, she didn�t think she wanted to risk it.� She felt the straps of the gag being released
and pushed the ball out with her tongue, eager to have it out of her mouth. He
pushed it back in again, his eyes showing her that he was not happy with her
actions

&nbsp;

Her heart pounded as he glared at her and she feared
what he would do. He held the ball in her mouth for a few moments before
letting it come out. She didn�t know how she felt and couldn�t look at him as
the ball came out.� Part
of her felt like she had let him down in some strange way.� He lifted her head up and brought his lips
down to hers in a fierce kiss.� All
thoughts vanished as she melted in his arms and when he ended the kiss and led
her down the hallway, she had again changed her mind about the weekend.

�A Detail of
Intimacy -� Part
7 by Aussiegirl and H Dean

&nbsp;

An hour later, she was sitting in his car, nervously
fiddling with her hands.� After they had
left the room, she had been made to sit in silence while he watched TV. It had
been hard to not speak but it had given her time to reflect on the weekend so
far.� She felt a bit neglected as the
time went by and wondered if she had done something to displease him.� More than once, Marie almost broke her
enforced silence to ask him what she had done wrong.� 

&nbsp;

Tom knew that Marie was beginning to grow annoyed at
his lack of attention, her eyes burning into the back of his head.� Standing up, he saw her tear filled eyes and
felt a stab of remorse for upsetting her.��
Lifting her head, he brushed back her hair, looking into her eyes. 

&nbsp;

�Marie, you have done very well and I am proud of
you.�� I will be back soon and we will
continue with our day.�� Her smile was
all he needed to see, as he went upstairs to prepare for the next part of the
day.� 

&nbsp;

While he was away, Marie once again wondered at the
way just a few words of praise could make her feel so much better again.� She looked up as he re-entered the room,
taking her by the hand and leading her back up the stairs.� Once there, he had surprised her by
announcing they were going out for a picnic and that he had laid out the
clothes he wanted her to wear.� 

&nbsp;

That was how she came to be sitting in the car wearing
a short skirt and halter neck top.� Her
feet were fitted in a pair of sandals that showed off her long, tanned legs to
perfection. The day had the feel of summer, despite the cold of the night
before.� 

&nbsp;

He loved the way she looked and couldn�t wait to show
her off at his favourite park.� Sitting
in the car, he saw her look at him and then look away,
her eyes reflecting her nervousness.� He
was pleased that she had managed to not speak for the past hour even though he
could see she had something on her mind.�
When they got to the park, he would let her talk.� Until then, he had other ideas to get her
mind off her thoughts.

&nbsp;

�I want you to raise your skirt and sit with your
bottom resting on the seat, legs spread.��
He watched as she hesitated and then slowly moved to do as he had asked.
He saw the top of her thighs being slowly exposed as
the short skirt skimmed up her legs. When she was done, he reached down and ran
his hand up and down her damp slit, pushing up her skirt even more.

&nbsp;

The soft leather felt cool on her bottom as his hands
warmed her pussy.� He removed his
fingers, leaving her frustrated. � I want you to put
your hands behind your back and not move them until I say so.�� She brought her hands behind her back,
already sensing that it would not be easy to keep them there.� He started up the car and pulled out onto the
road, while she started to get curious about where they were going.� She tried to forget that she had her newly
shaved pussy on show and just enjoy the scenery. It was a beautiful day, the
sky blue with only a few white clouds on the horizon.� 

&nbsp;

The journey was uneventful until a large truck pulled
into the lane beside the car at a set of traffic lights.� The next thing she knew the sound of the
truck�s horn was blaring in her ears. She looked up to see that the driver was
staring right down at her spread pussy. She went to cover herself, shame
overriding any concerns she had about keeping her hands behind her back.� However, before she even had the chance to
move her hands, she found Tom�s hand on her pussy.� She pulled her hands out and tried
unsuccessfully to drag his hand away.� 

&nbsp;

�Stop it, you are embarrassing me!�� He took no notice of her outburst and in fact
pushed one finger deep into her, causing the driver to honk his horn one more
time before the light changed.�� She
could feel her face flaming red in shame and when he finally pulled his finger
out and turned the corner, she pulled down her skirt
and stared out the window.� She didn�t
care that she was breaking his rules, she just felt so angry at what he had
done.� 

&nbsp;

When he parked the car near a large park, she didn�t
move. Even when he came around and opened the door for her, she didn�t
move.� After waiting a few minutes, he
squatted down beside the car, trying to look her in the face.� She turned away from him only to find his
hand on her knee. 

&nbsp;

�Love, I�m sorry if I took things too far. You just
looked so beautiful and I wanted to show off.�
Forgive me?�� She looked up at him
through the veil of her hair, not sure if he deserved to be forgiven so easily.� However, it did feel good to hear him say
sorry and she didn�t want to waste too much of the day.� 

&nbsp;

�Tom, I need you to say that you won�t do that
again.� I mean, what we do in private is
different but that was just too public.��
She looked up and into his eyes, wanting to see what he was really
thinking.� As she looked at him, her
feelings for him filled her again and she knew she could not stay mad at him
for long.� 

&nbsp;

�I promise not to embarrass you in public again, but
what we do in private, well���
she had to laugh as he helped her out of the car.� They had always been able to get over any
disagreements in the past and she was glad that despite the change in their
relationship, this still seemed to be the case.�
He led her over to a spot that had a view of the park.� She could hear kids playing in the playground
and see the families enjoying the sunny morning but they were in a fairly
private spot. 

&nbsp;

He pulled out the blanket from the picnic basket and
laid it on the ground, thinking how lucky he was that she had not decided to
pull the plug on the whole weekend.� When
she had refused to get out of the car, he had wondered if he had gone too
far.� He had to admit, though, that it
had sent a thrill through him to play with her while the driver looked on and
that if he had more time with her, it was something he would have insisted she
let him do more often. 

&nbsp;

He watched her watching him as he laid out the food
for the picnic.� She raised her eyebrows
as he pulled out a bottle of champagne and two crystal glasses. He popped the
cork and poured her a glass, hoping that a drink would relax them both and help
her to forget what had happened in the car. He passed her the glass and for a
while they both sat in silence, taking in the surrounds.� After a while, she began to dish out the food
he had brought, seeming to be pleased with his choices.� 

&nbsp;

She was impressed that he had remembered her favourite
foods and found herself relaxing as the sun warmed
her. They ate in silence until he turned to her, his face serious. �Marie, we
have come a long way since last night and I would be interested in hearing how
you are feeling.� You may not get the
chance to talk to me about this later, so say what you need to say now.�

&nbsp;

She took a few minutes debating what to say to him,
finally downing the last of her drink and looking him directly in the eye.� � Tom, I have to be
honest and say that there have been times when I have hated what you were
doing.� However, I promised you a weekend
and despite the doubts I have had at times, you will get your weekend.� 

&nbsp;

He was pleased with her honesty, though they had
always been honest with each other in the past.�
�Marie, that is good to hear.� You
need to know that things will only get tougher as the weekend progresses, so if
you have second thoughts, now is the time to say them.� We can still enjoy our time together, but of
course I would be very disappointed if you want to stop.�� He hadn�t meant to manipulate her that way
but now he had said it; he knew it to be true.

&nbsp;

She took more time digesting what he had said and he
feared that having given her an out, she would take it.� �No, I�ll stick by my promise, though I would
be lying if I didn�t say that I�m scared by what you have planned for me.� He
let out the breath of air he hadn�t even realized he was holding and reached
out to take her hand.� 

&nbsp;

�So long as you are fearful only of what I might do
and not of me, then our weekend can continue. Now, if there is nothing else you
wish to say, how about we pack this up and then go for a walk around the
park.�� She nodded and immediately they
started to pack up the picnic remains. He returned the basket to the car and
they strolled arm in arm around the park. He again
thought about how wonderful it would be to be with her all the time, just like
this, but knew he would never be satisfied with what she would want out of a
relationship.

&nbsp;

The park was more beautiful then she had realized, the gardens and the lawn well kept. She snuggled into
Tom�s body, feeling safe with him. She still thought it strange that there
could be this Tom, the one who was happy to walk around the park with her, and
the other Tom who wanted, no needed, to see her suffer. She shivered despite
the warm day and noticed him giving her a strange look. It would have been so
easy to have taken his offer to end the weekend, but she was determined to
finish what she had started, though as she had told him, she was scared of what
that might entail.

&nbsp;

Her thoughts were interrupted as he pulled her into
what looked to be an old theatre, with a stage out the front and changing rooms
out the back. There were cobwebs everywhere and graffiti covered the
walls.� She guessed it hadn�t been used
for a long time.� He pushed her into the
corner of the room where they could not be easily seen by anyone passing
by.� She gasped as he pushed her up
against the wall and pulled on the tie holding up her top.� 

&nbsp;

As her breasts came free, he gripped them in his
hands, loving their firm feeling. He took each nipple in his fingers and
pinched, watching her expression as she tried not to call out.� He let go, hearing her sigh softly and
lowered one hand down to reach up under her skirt. Her eyes widened as he
pushed one, then two fingers into her, her small gasps telling him she liked
it. As he continued to pump, her eyes closed and he knew if he kept going she
would cum. 

&nbsp;

She could feel her orgasm building and bit her lip,
trying not to let anyone walking by know they were there. When he pulled out,
leaving her breathing hard, she couldn�t help the frustrated moan that escaped
her lips. �Please let me cum.�� She could
not believe she was begging him, but the throbbing in her pussy was just too
much to take.� 

&nbsp;

He smiled at her and shook his head.� �Not yet darling, though I do like the sound
of you begging. However, I need you to help me make sure I am not arrested for
public indecency.� She looked down to see his erection tenting out the front of
his pants. She felt him push her down onto her knees, and opened her mouth
ready for him.� In a moment, he pushed
his cock directly into her throat and stayed there. She tried to pull her head
back but found his hand firmly in her hair.�


&nbsp;

The feeling of her throat contracting around his cock
almost made him cum on the spot, but he wasn�t ready to cum yet.� He counted in his head, getting to six before
he pulled back to let her get some air. She gasped a few times and then he
pushed back into her warm throat.� This
time he pinched her nose between his fingers, loving the look of her big,
desperate eyes looking up at him.� When
he let go and pulled out again, she shook her head at him as if to say no more.

&nbsp;

Ignoring her silent pleas, he gripped each side of her
head and worked his cock forcefully in and out of her mouth, hearing her gag
each time it went down her throat.� He
knew his orgasm was close and pushed into her throat fully and again blocked
off her nose.� 

&nbsp;

Her chest grew tight as he blocked off her air and she
feared if he stayed there much longer, she would pass out.� He began to cum and she felt it slide down
into her stomach as she began to feel dizzy. Finally he pulled out, the last of
his cum landing on her tongue.� �Don�t
swallow that.� She struggled to not swallow as she tried to fill her lungs with
much needed air. She could feel the slimy load sitting on her tongue and hoped
he wouldn�t make her hold it there for too long.

&nbsp;

He did up his pants and looked at her, still on her
knees. Her hair was all messed up around her face and she was trying so hard to
do what he had asked. Squatting down in front of her, he brushed her hair back
and stroked her cheek. He pulled up her top, tying it back in place and held
out a hand to help her to stand.� 

&nbsp;

�I want you to keep my cum in
your mouth until we get back home.�� He
could see her look of disbelief and honestly thought she might spit it out,
maybe even all over him.� However, she again
surprised him by lowing her head and nodding. He felt
such a rush of pride in all she had achieved, that he pulled her to him.� 

&nbsp;

Hugging him, she immediately felt how much he did love
and care for her.� It helped her to stay
firm to her decision to see the weekend through.� He let go and took her hand in his as they
walked back out to the sunshine of the park.�
At first she was sure everyone would know what she had in her mouth, but
when no one even gave them a second glance, she knew that her secret was
safe.� 

&nbsp;

They were almost back to the car when he reached his
hand around her waist and started to lightly tickle her.� She had always been ticklish and tried hard
not to laugh as he tickled her even more firmly.� They got to the car and she thought she had
done a good job of not laughing, when he pushed her against her door of the car
and used both hands to tickle her.

&nbsp;

He could see her straining not to laugh as he used
both hands on her. He knew it was mean of him, knowing how she hated to be
tickled, but it was a sight to see.� He
saw her swallow and her eyes grew wide. He smiled, knowing that he now had an
excuse to punish her on the ride back home.

&nbsp;

�On no, you didn�t swallow, did you?� Her eyes told
him yes before she even had a chance to answer. �She looked at him, her uncertainty of what he
would do now shown all over her face. As she nodded, he could see her blushing
again, her cheeks bright red and rosy.�
He knew he would never tire of seeing her blush for him and pushed the
thought that the weekend would end tomorrow to the back of his mind.� 

&nbsp;

He leaned in close so he could whisper in her ear.
�Well, that means you have to be punished for disobeying me.�� She shivered at his words and he ran a hand
down her arm before opening the door and sitting her in her seat. By the time
he had the engine running, she had raised her skirt and put her hands behind
her back, just like he had asked her to sit on the way to the park.

&nbsp;

She decided to try to please him by sitting as he had
asked earlier, hoping that would make him go easy on her.� Her mind was spinning with his mention of the
word punishment.� It seemed to take him
forever to get settled and pull out onto the highway.� She wondered if he was planning to punish her
when they got back home, until he looked at her and smiled.� Beside her she could hear the sounds of a
truck and knew what her punishment was going to be.

&nbsp;

She kept wishing for the truck to turn or for the
lights to stay green, but luck was not on her side as both the truck and his
car had to stop side by side. Tom blared the horn, the driver of the truck
looking like he was ready for a fight before he saw her open, bare pussy on
display.� She tried to look straight
ahead and ignore the feeling of Tom�s fingers that were now in her pussy. 

&nbsp;

�Look up at him baby and give him a smile.�� Hesitating only slightly, she tried to bury
her shame and gave the truck driver one of her biggest smiles. He leered back
and wiggled his tongue at her.� She
fought back her disgust and willed the lights to change.� Tom added another finger to her moist pussy
and she was forced to stifle a moan.�
Suddenly the lights changed and with a blare of his horn, the truck was
left behind as Tom removed both fingers and took off before him. 

&nbsp;

He saw her squirming in her seat and knew that despite
her embarrassment she would have cum if he had kept fingering her for
longer.� He began to think of what he had
planned for later in the afternoon, his cock hardening at the vision he had of
her in his mind. Pulling into the driveway, he turned to her before he got out
of the car.

&nbsp;

�You did very well back there.� I am proud of you.�� She sat up straight, his praise making her
feel like she had achieved something great. She watched as he got out of the
car and walked around to her door, offering his hand as he helped her
stand.� She went to pull her skirt down
but he stopped her by taking both of her hands in his.� He watched as she looked around her and then
sighed, walking into the house with her bottom enticingly displayed.














Once they were in the house, Tom kissed her gently and pulled her skirt
back down for her

A Detail of intimacy � by Aussiegirl and H Dean� 

&nbsp;

Chapter 8

&nbsp;

Once they were in the house, Tom kissed her gently and
pulled her skirt back down for her.� For
the next few hours, they relaxed in front of an old favourite movie, his arm
wrapped around her.� They laughed and
talked of old times, until the credits began to roll and he sat her up to look
at him.

&nbsp;

�I need you to be ready, naked, in my room in five
minutes.�� Marie understood that her
break was over and that the new Tom she was getting to know was back. Walking
up the stairs, she felt a shiver run through her, though she wasn�t sure if it
was from fear or excitement. It took her no time at all to undress, so she used
the extra time to check her appearance and use the bathroom.� She had just returned to the room when he
entered.

&nbsp;

He saw her standing; waiting for him with what he
thought was a mixture of fear and excitement in her eyes.� He watched her expression change as he laid
the items he intended to use on the bed. He had already put down his coils of
rope, the clamps, the weights and a riding crop. He saved the harness gag for
last, knowing that just the look of it was enough to intimidate many of the
women he had used it on in the past. 

&nbsp;

He was not wrong, as her eyes grew wide as he held it
up for her to see. When she went to speak, he placed his finger over her mouth.
He spent the next few minutes putting the gag on her, the ball held firmly in
place by the array of straps covering her face.�
He checked the tightness of the gag before
buckling the strap under her chin.� 

&nbsp;

Marie could feel the firmness of the gag and had to
take a few deep breaths not to panic.�
She found she could not even open her mouth a little bit and she wasn�t
sure how long she would be able to cope with it. He rubbed his hand along her
cheek and she felt a bit calmer, though the gag still bothered her.

&nbsp;

�Dear, I can tell you are struggling with the
gag.� Just breathe slowly.� She did as he
suggested and to her amazement, it did seem to make a difference.� He smiled and disappeared behind her. She
felt him pull her arms behind her as he slid his arm under her elbows. He
squeezed her breasts and she gasped as he pinched her nipples. Her breasts were
released as he started to tie her elbows together with rope.� 

&nbsp;

She could feel the pull on her shoulders as he worked
the rope tighter and moved down to tie her wrists together. By the time he was
done, she could not get her arms free no matter how hard she tried.� He returned his hands to her breasts, pushing
his body up close to hers.� She could
feel how aroused he was as he moved her hands to rub his cock under the
material of his pants. 

&nbsp;

He sighed and moved away from her, not wanting to get
too sidetracked from his main task. Coming back to face her, he used another
coil of rope to bind her breasts until they stood like little balloons on her
chest. He squeezed each breast in his hands, loving the way the ropes made them
so smooth and firm.� 

&nbsp;

Placing his hands on her shoulders, he helped her to
kneel on the carpet and then moved her so she was lying on her bound
breasts.� He could hear her whimpering as
he tied her feet together before pulling them up to tie them to her bound
hands. Lifting up her upper body off the ground, he pulled the
hogtie even tighter, so that when he let go, she had an arch in her
back.� 

&nbsp;

She could feel the ropes pulling on her body as he
lifted her up.� When he let go, she found
that no longer were her breasts pressing down on the floor. This was about the
only good thing she could feel about the position he had her in.� A familiar sound came to her ears as he took
more photos of her, moving all around her bound body. 

&nbsp;

�He put down the
camera and ran his hands over her body. He could feel her shaking and as she
looked at him with desperation in her eyes, he felt that feeling of control he
so loved. He picked up the crop and walked around her, striking her bare skin.
At first the strikes were fairly soft but as he continued they got a little
harder until she jumped each time it connected with her skin.

&nbsp;

She felt him take one of her bound feet in his hand,
the crop just lying on the soul of her foot.�
Bracing herself for the pain of the crop, she jumped not from the pain,
but from his voice. 

&nbsp;

�Honey, you are doing very well.� I am going to strike each foot once only, but
I don�t want to hear a sound out of you!�
Understand?�� Marie didn�t know
how she was going to not make a sound, but being determined to try, she nodded
her head.� He seemed to take forever,
holding her foot and just rubbing the crop over it, until suddenly her body was
filled with the most awful pain.� Her
scream filled her head and she felt her body shaking as she struggled to not
let it out.� 

&nbsp;

Tom could see the effort she was making and again a
feeling of pride filled him.� He had not
really expected her to be able to keep quiet, but he was impressed with her
attempt to do so.� 

&nbsp;

�Well done baby.�
Only one more to go.�� He took her other foot in his hand and
knowing she would expect him to again take his time, he struck it without any
hesitation.� This time, not only did she
shake all over, he heard her scream, loud even behind the gag.� He was not surprised, as he knew she had to
be still feeling the pain of the first strike. He dropped the crop, and moved
around to squat down in front of her.� 

&nbsp;

Marie barely noticed Tom in front of her, until she
felt his hand on her cheek. Opening her eyes, she felt a shimmer of fear as she
realized she had made a sound with his last strike.� However, instead of disappointment in his
eyes, she saw a look of pleasure.�
Without a word, he bent down and kissed her cheek, before standing up
and moving behind her.� 

&nbsp;

Moving to lower the hook from the ceiling, he saw her
head jerk up at the sound.� He busied
himself with connecting ropes from the hook to different points on her body, to
ensure that she would have support when he lifted her up off the ground. He
could see her worried expression as he walked back over to the switch that
would lift her up.

&nbsp;

She felt her body rising off the ground, feeling the
ropes pull on different parts of her body. It felt frightening to be held up by
only ropes and she couldn�t help the tears that came to her eyes.� Tom came back to stand near her head and
lifted her chin so he could look in her eyes.�
She moaned as he held up the clamps she had worn that morning and
fastened them to her nipples. To her horror, he then added the weights, making
her scream out in agony.

&nbsp;

�Baby, I want to fuck you while you are
suspended.�� As he suspected, she didn�t
like the idea and shook her nod no. He had hoped she would do that, as now he
had some bargaining power.� He flicked
the weights, making her scream again. He knew he could just do what he wanted
but he loved to make his women feel they had some control over the situations
he put them in.

&nbsp;

�Ok, I�ll give you a choice. The
clamps or the fuck.� She hated both choices.� While the clamps were agony on her bound
breasts, she didn�t know if she could take the pain of him using her in her
suspended position.� He flicked the
weights again and she knew that she had to get them off her nipples.

&nbsp;

�Clamps.�� She didn�t know if he could understand her
with the gag in but she figured he had when he removed them. Now that the
clamps were off, he moved around behind her and spread her knees wide.� He didn�t give her time to think too much as
he quickly lowered his pants.� He then
rolled a condom on and pushed his cock into her waiting pussy.� It was strange that she had dreamed of him
making love to her for years but never in her wildest dreams had she pictured
it like this.� 

&nbsp;

He used her bound breasts for leverage as he worked
his cock in and out of her pussy.� He had
imagined this moment ever since she had arranged to stay for the weekend.� Her moans were music to his ears as he pumped
her even harder.� Running his hand down
to rub her clit, her moans changed to one of pleasure as he urged her closer to
her own orgasm.� 

&nbsp;

His hand on her clit was driving her crazy and she
hoped that this time he would let her cum. She tried to block out the pain and
concentrate on the feelings he was giving her till her orgasm finally washed
over her. He came not long after and as he pulled out of her, she again started
to feel the strain of the ropes on her hanging body.� He gave her a push and the room spun as she
rotated.� She could see him taking more
pictures and then to her great relief he lowered her back down to the
ground.� 

&nbsp;

He would have loved to leave her hanging for longer
but knew that being new to bondage, she would not be
able to take much more. In fact, he had been amazed that she had coped so well
with the suspension.� Once she was back
on the ground, he squatted down in front of her and took off the gag.� She worked her jaw as he slowly moved around
her and released her from the ties.� When
she was finally free of all of the ropes, her body bearing the marks they had
left behind, he pulled her to him and held her tight.� 

&nbsp;

She held him close, her mind a mess as she tried to
work out how she was feeling. Suddenly she felt the emotions of the day bubble
up inside of her, the fear, the love, the pain, all coming out in a rush of
tears.�� Once she started she couldn�t
stop until she was crying uncontrollably in his arms.

&nbsp;

He held her close as she cried, her tears wetting his
shoulder. He couldn�t help feeling a bit guilty at causing her tears and hoped
he hadn�t done any major damage to their relationship. Finally her sobs began
to ease and he pulled her back to look at him. He saw that her face was all red
and blotchy from her tears. He went into the bathroom, returning with a wet
washer and glass of water. She took both with a small smile and he waited
patiently while she first downed half of the glass of water and then used the
washer.

&nbsp;

She didn�t know what she was going to say to Tom,
feeling like such a fool. She didn�t even know what had happened, one minute
she had been so relieved to be free of the restraints and the next she was
crying like a baby in his arms.� He
brushed the hair back from her face and looked at her with such concern in his
eyes that she felt even closer to him.

&nbsp;

�Love, can you tell me what that was about?�� He saw her look away and then glance back at
him. He knew she was trying to work out what had happened. �You know, you are
not the only woman I have reduced to a blubbering mess.� He was relieved to
hear her give a little laugh as she picked up the glass again.� She took another drink and placed the glass
down on the floor.

&nbsp;

�Tom, I don�t know what to say, I guess I just needed
a good cry. It has been a pretty emotional day, I suppose.�� She moved to sit down on the bed, watching as
he came to sit beside her. He took her hand in his and she felt comforted by
his presence. That was what she was so confused about; how she could love him
and yet know that she could never give him what he needed in a relationship.

�

He saw the tear as it trickled down her face and as he
wiped it away, she gave him a watery smile.�
�Tom, you know I do love you but � � He held
his finger to her lips, not wanting to hear what he knew she was going to
say.� He knew it was selfish, but he
didn�t want to think about her leaving just yet.

&nbsp;

�No love, let�s save our sad goodbyes till
tomorrow.�� She looked at him and when he
removed his finger, leaned over and kissed him gently.� She felt him respond and before she knew it
they were lying back on the bed, his hands roaming her body.� Unlike their first kiss on this same bed,
there was no sense of urgency and he seemed for the moment content to just
kiss.� 

&nbsp;

The ringing of the phone entered into his head and he
slowly pulled away from her.� He looked
at her lying on the bed, her eyes closed and her face soft and relaxed.� He didn�t want to leave her but it was
probably just as well, as he didn�t want to confuse his feelings for her
anymore then they already were. 

&nbsp;

She was aware of him leaving to answer his phone, his
voice getting softer as he walked out into the hall. Lying on the bed, she
could still feel his kiss on her lips.�
She sat up, pulling her knees up to her body as he entered the room
again.� He looked distracted by something
and hoped he hadn�t received some bad news. 

&nbsp;

�Tom, everything ok?� He sat down on the bed, running
his hands through his hair.� He didn�t
look upset, but he seemed bothered by something. �Talk to me Tom.� You know you can tell me anything.� It felt
good to be back on familiar ground, with her being the sounding board for his
problems.

&nbsp;

�Sorry, that was my boss and he tells me I have to
have a report ready first thing Monday.�
I couldn�t say no, but I hate the idea of work invading our weekend.�� He stood and started to pace the floor, his
hand running through his hair like he did when he was thinking.� 

&nbsp;

�Well, can I help?�
Just tell me what to do and I�m sure we can get it done in half the
time.�� He stopped and looked at her,
seeming to be thinking about what she had said before he nodded.� He reached out and helped her off the bed,
then handed her a bathrobe to put on.�
She dressed and followed him into his study.

&nbsp;

For the next few hours, they both worked together,
Marie only noticing how long they had been working when her stomach began to
rumble. She left him working and went into the kitchen to make them both a
simple meal of steak and salad.� Bringing
the tray of food back into the study, she stopped for a moment, imagining what
it would be like to help him like this all the time. She shook her head as he
looked up and she pushed the idea out of her mind. 

&nbsp;

It was a few hours later when Tom stood and stretched,
the report finally done. He had just sent Marie up to have a bath before he got
her ready for bed. Now that his work was done, he started to again think of how
he wanted her restrained for the night.�
He had initially thought of having her sleep on the floor beside him,
but after the last few hours he was exhausted and knew she would be too. 

&nbsp;

He stood in the doorway of the bathroom, smiling as
she hummed softly to herself.� He almost
hated to intrude but coughed to let her know he was there.� She looked up, her beautiful smile lighting
up her face. As she went to wait on the bed, he quickly brushed his teeth and
went back into the room. She was lying on the bed, her eyes half closed.

&nbsp;

�Honey, it is almost time to
sleep, just one more thing before you can close your eyes.� She was almost too
exhausted to contemplate what that one thing might be. She felt him fasten
something around her neck. She realised it was the collar she�d had on that
morning.� She was too tired to even open
her eyes and she felt her mind fogging up as she heard a click that told her he
had again fastened her to the bed.

&nbsp;

He saw that she was almost asleep and lay down beside
her, his own body ready for sleep. Gently rolling her over onto her side, he
held her close as he too drifted off to sleep.

A Detail of Intimacy � Aussiegirl and H Dean 

&nbsp;

Chapter 9

&nbsp;

Tom woke first and lay looking at her beautiful face,
soft with sleep.� He ran his hands over
her face, seeing her nose twitch as his finger trailed over her cheek.� He did it again and this time she lifted her
hand to brush away whatever was on her cheek. He smiled as she slowly opened
her eyes, his stomach flipping as she smiled back up at him.� 

&nbsp;

She opened her eyes to see Tom smiling down at
her.� It seemed like the most natural
thing in the world and for what felt like the hundredth time she wished things
could be different.� He moved so that he
was straddling her body and without him having to say a word, she spread her
legs wide for him.� He kissed her gently,
his tongue playing with hers and then sat up as he rolled a condom on. 

&nbsp;

When she felt his cock enter her, it was so different
from yesterday when she had been bound and suspended. This time he took his
time, treating her more like a lover and she simply melted in his arms.� She could feel the muscles in his back as he
gently rocked his body into hers and she closed her eyes as her feelings became
more intense.� 

&nbsp;

He could feel her warm body under his, her breasts
soft and firm.� Kissing her again, he
felt himself becoming lost in the feel of her mouth on his.�� Breaking off his kiss, he moved his mouth
down to her nipple and sucked it into his mouth. He could hear her little mews
of pleasure as he rolled her nipple in his mouth.� 

&nbsp;

Moving to the other nipple, he again took it into his
mouth, this time biting gently.� She
moaned and ran her hands through his hair, the feel of her fingers making him
shiver.� As he continued to move in her,
his hands ran down her body to her hips and then back up again.� 

&nbsp;

She felt his mouth on her nipples, her body on fire as
he nibbled and sucked them. She was aware of nothing else but the feel of him,
her body responding to his as if he had been her lover for years.� She knew she was close to cumming but just
wanted the wonderful feeling to never stop. 

&nbsp;

His orgasm approaching, he sped up, seeing her clutch
at the sheets in response. He yelled out as his cum shot out of him, his body
shaking as he saw her cum also.� He
continued to pump his cock into her a few more times before he collapsed onto
her.� 

&nbsp;

She was still cumming when she felt his body cover
hers. In spite of the weight of his body, she loved the way it felt.� She was still breathing hard when he rolled
off her. Looking over at him, she could see he was also trying to catch his
breath.� After a few moments, he sat up,
his eyes reflecting the wonder of the moment.��


&nbsp;

Without a word, he removed the collar from around her
neck and helped her to stand. She still felt a bit shaky but as he led her into
the shower, she felt some of her strength returning.� The warm water felt wonderful and she found
herself thinking about what had just happened. She could hear Tom entering the
shower and turned to face him. In silence, they washed each other and when the
shower was done, both headed down stairs to have some breakfast. 

&nbsp;

It was not until halfway through his bowl of cereal
that Tom started to think about the day ahead.�
He had been so rocked by what had happened that he had all but forgotten
his plans but now he started to get excited.�
He wasn�t sure how she would react, but it was yet another thing he had
always dreamed of doing with Marie.� He
knew she would be hesitant and maybe even refuse to do some of what he had in
mind, but that wasn�t going to stop him from at least trying.� 

&nbsp;

Marie could see his eyes sparkling and wondered what
he was thinking.� She was tingling all
over from his lovemaking and wondered yet again why it couldn�t always be like
that.� She finished her cereal, placing
the bowl in the sink as he walked up behind her.� 

&nbsp;

�Well, if only every day could start that way, but now
there are some more things I want you to do for
me.�� She felt the familiar jolt as she
thought about what tortures he might want to put her through today.� He spun her around to look at him, his face
now all serious, which made her feel even more nervous.

&nbsp;

He could see that she was anxious as he took her hand
and led her into his playroom. He had not shown it to her before, not wanting
to scare her, but now he was eager to see her reaction. He had spent many years
getting it just the way he wanted it.� He
felt her stop and he turned to see her standing in the doorway, her mouth open.

&nbsp;

He pulled her into the room and let her look around a
bit.� Like he had suspected, she looked
shocked at the contents of the room, though he could also see some curiosity in
her eyes.� He watched as she walked
around the room, touching some things while avoiding others. When he thought
she�d had enough time to have a look, he moved to stand beside her.

&nbsp;

�Love, I know this is all a bit scary but I needed you
to see this.� Today we are going to
explore some more of the things I like and I just need you to trust me. Can you
do that for me?�� She felt the now
familiar shiver run through her body but looking into this eyes, knew she could
trust him.� The only thing she was
worried about was could she live up to his expectations.� 

&nbsp;

�Tom, of course I trust you but�.�� he didn�t let her finish, placing a
finger on her lips.�� She fell silent and
he led her over to a chair at the side of the room.� �It
looked just like a normal wooden chair except that it had an electric vibrator
taped down to it.� 

&nbsp;

�Yesterday, all you wanted to do was cum, so today you
are going to get what you wanted.� She shivered as he removed her bathrobe and
sat her down on the chair.� He spread her
legs wide and proceeded to tie her down securely to the chair. By the time he
was done, she could not move away from the vibrator that was sitting right
against her clit. 

&nbsp;

He brushed the hair out of her eyes and then used a
piece of rope to tie it back and secure her head to the top of the chair.� Now not only could she not move her body, she
was unable to move her head as well.� Out
of the corner of her eye, she saw him hold up a gag and took in a deep breath
as he pushed it into her mouth.

&nbsp;

He looked at the beautiful sight before him, her body
held tight by the ropes and her eyes wide over the red ball in her mouth.� He watched her eyes as he flicked the
vibrator onto low. As he suspected, they grew wider and then closed as it began
to do it�s job.

&nbsp;

At first she quite enjoyed the feel of the vibrations
on her clit, allowing herself to let her orgasm build. When the orgasm hit her,
she rocked in the chair, the ropes pulling tight against her body. It was not
until her orgasm eased that she began to understand the real nature of her
situation. 

&nbsp;

With each minute that passed and each orgasm that was
ripped out of her, her clit became more and more sensitive until it was pure
torture. She begged behind her gag for him to turn it off, but all he did was
smile at her.

&nbsp;

He knew she was reaching the stage where she would do
anything to get off the vibrator.� He had
no intention of easing her suffering yet though, in fact this was the part he
loved the best. Watching her shake with yet another orgasm, he ran his hands
over her breasts, feeling her body quiver.�


&nbsp;

When she had stopped shaking, he brought his hand down
to her pussy, pushing her down even firmer onto the vibrator.� He could hear her whimpering as he pinched
her hard nipples with his other hand.�
Wanting to hear her begging, he removed the gag and moved his hand down
to the switch on the vibrator.

&nbsp;

�Baby, do you know there is a higher level?� She
looked at him in shock and tried to shake her head, the pain making her wince.
He smiled at her and hovered over the switch. 

&nbsp;

�Oh God no, please turn it off. I�ll do anything else
you say. �� She
saw his smile get bigger and realised she had said just what he wanted to
hear.� However she didn�t care, just
wanted to get away from the incessant buzzing.�


&nbsp;

�Ready, three, two.. � He
flicked the switch before he got to one, her eyes glaring at him for a second
before they registered the increased speed.�
He stood and watched as she bucked in the ropes, her body straining to
get off the chair.� 

&nbsp;

�Marie, look at me, I don�t want you to close your
eyes. If you can keep them open until after your next orgasm, I will turn it
off.� If you close your eyes, I will just
have to punish you.�� He again suffered a
mild glare before she had to use all of her strength to keep her beautiful eyes
open.� 

&nbsp;

She hated him at that moment, her body aching with the
strain of the ropes and her clit painfully aroused.� Keeping her eyes open proved to be an almost
impossible task but one she managed until the next orgasm hit her. She was not
even aware of what she had done until she heard his voice in her ear. 

&nbsp;

�Oh dear, you closed your eyes.� She felt something
land on her chest and looked down to see him hitting her breasts with
something.� She felt another orgasm build
as the pain in her breasts increased.� 

&nbsp;

�Stop, please stop.�� Suddenly he stopped and took her chin in his
hand as she struggled to keep her eyes open.��
She was surprised, but guessed he was not finished with her yet.

&nbsp;

�I am willing to give you a choice, you can stay here
on the chair for another five minutes or I can flog you until you achieve one
more orgasm.� She could barely focus on what he was saying, but knew she had to
get off the chair.

&nbsp;

�Flog me!�� He
smiled and aimed the small flogger at her breasts. He watched as she gasped
with each strike, her breasts starting to turn a nice shade of red.� When she orgasmed yet again, he kept his
promise and stopped both his flogging and the vibrator.

&nbsp;

Marie was barely aware when everything stopped, her
clit still throbbing and her breasts sore.�
Even when the ropes came off, she didn�t move, in fact she wasn�t even
sure if she could move. She felt him lift her up to stand and she all but fell
into his arms.� 

&nbsp;

He held her close to him, feeling her heart beating
wildly in her chest.� Brushing back her
now damp hair, he lifted her head up to look at him. Her eyes where still
unfocused and he knew he had to give her a break before he moved onto what he
had next planned. 

&nbsp;

Sitting her down on a low bench, he went to get a
bottle of water out of his small bar fridge. First he only let her have small
sips. As she appeared to become more aware of her surroundings, he allowed her
to drink as much as she needed to. 

&nbsp;

The water was wonderful and soon she was beginning to
feel better. Her legs were still shaking and her pussy still tingled, but she
seemed to be more alert.� She looked up
as Tom came to sit beside her, his hand going down to rub her clit.

&nbsp;

She almost spat the water in her mouth back out at
him, his light touch just about making her jump off the bench.� Never had her clit felt the way it did right
now, but she feared he would not leave it alone. 

&nbsp;

He noticed her reaction to his touch and knew she
would be sensitive for a while yet.� She
was still looking a bit dazed as he moved to the cupboard to get out the things
he needed. By the time he had things ready, she was looking much better.� 

&nbsp;

He stood her up and led her to stand in the middle of
the room.� He noticed she was looking a
bit wary, her eyes wide as she took in the items he had placed on the
floor.� 

&nbsp;

Her legs were still feeling weak and she wasn�t too
sure about some of the items she could see in front of her.� She saw him pick up what looked to be a red
leather bag with white cord to lace it up.�
Wondering what he was going to do with it, he spun her around and began
to place her arms inside of it.

&nbsp;

�This is another way I like to keep a girl�s arms
still.�� She felt her arms being pulled
tighter until her elbows were almost touching, her shoulders aching at the
pressure he was putting them under. He tightened the straps up over her
shoulders, before he placed what felt like mittens over her hands and then her
fingers were forced to bend until they were in a fist shape.

&nbsp;

He then held up what looked to be an old fashioned
corset and began to place it under her breasts.�
At first it didn�t feel too bad but as he pulled the cords tighter and
tighter, she found it harder to breath.�
She was relieved when he stepped back, though she wished she could take
it off.� 

&nbsp;

He looked at her, the corset making her already small
waist even tinier. He ran his hands over her breasts, rising up beautifully
over the top of the red corset.� He had
plans for them too, but that would come later.

&nbsp;

Taking her hair in his hands, he tied it into a
ponytail and looped a piece of rope into it.�
The rope he tied to a ring hanging from the ceiling.�� She now had no choice but to stay where he
had placed her.

&nbsp;

Picking up the thigh high red boots, he saw her eyes
watching him as he lifted up one leg and placed it in the boot. They had a very
high heel and she almost lost her balance as he placed her foot back on the
ground.� He held her still as he slid on
the other boot. 

&nbsp;

She wobbled on the boots, the rope in her hair the
only thing holding her up.� She tried to
move back though as he approached her with what looked to be a wide belt in his
hand. Expecting him to put it around her already tightened waist, she was
surprised when he lifted it up to her neck. 

&nbsp;

Once he had fastened it around her neck, she found she
could no longer look down.� The thought
made her panic, thinking she would not be able to see anything he did to
her.� She saw him smile at her, that same
smile he had given her earlier when she had asked him to flog her.� 

&nbsp;

He saw her panicked expression and ran his hand over
her cheek.� This simple act seemed to be
enough to calm her down a bit, though he could feel her shaking under his
fingers.� Moving his hand down under the
collar, he watched her eyes as he pinched both her nipples.

&nbsp;

His fingers pressed down on her nipples, the pressure
building slowing until she had to scream.�
He didn�t let go, the pain building and her cries growing louder.� When she thought she could stand it no more,
he finally let go.� However the pain stayed,
her nipples aching.� At first she thought
it was from the pain of his pinch, but when the pain didn�t lessen, she worked
out he must have placed something onto them.

&nbsp;

She didn�t have much time to dwell on this new pain as
he used his hands to spread her booted legs. She heard two clicking sounds and
when she tried to bring her legs back together, found them held in place.� His hands ran along her inner thighs until
they reached her pussy, pushing in with what felt like two then three
fingers.� 

&nbsp;

He was surprised by how wet she was, especially as he
knew he was really pushing her pain levels.�
Part of him hoped she would find she really liked this after all, but he
knew it was more likely to be a reaction to her session on the chair.� He picked up the tube of lubrication from the
table and removing his fingers from her pussy, added some to his already moist
fingers.

&nbsp;

He braced himself for her possible reaction and was
not surprised when she tried to jerk away from his fingers as he pushed into
her ass.� He ignored her moans and even
her begging as he pushed the lube into her. He could feel his cock straining in
his jeans as he worked his fingers in and out of her hole, but he knew he had
to wait a while.

&nbsp;

She hated the feel of his fingers in her ass, memories
of the other night when he had used her there still fresh in her mind.� When he finally removed them, she sighed but
then she felt him pushing something into her. At first she thought it was only
going into her pussy, but then felt something moving into her ass as well.�� 

&nbsp;

�Tom, please, it�s too much.� She knew begging
wouldn�t help but she just couldn�t stop herself. He was stretching her more
than she thought possible, her tears wetting her face as the pain increased,� �God, Tom, take it
out.��� It didn�t stop him and soon she
felt so full she thought she would burst.�


&nbsp;

Tom could see she didn�t like the double penetration
but wasn�t ready to ease up on her yet. He knew that if she really started to
panic he would release her, but until then he wanted to see just how far he
could push her.� Fastening the end of the
strap holding the dildos in place to the bottom of her corset, he felt them
move just a little more into her.� Her
cries told him she didn�t like it, but still he continued, securing the end of
the binder on her arms to a ring in the floor.

&nbsp;

She saw him hold up what looked to be a hood and began
to shake her head no.� She was still
trying to adjust to the pain of the two fake cocks and whatever he had put on
her nipples.� The rope in her hair
limited her movement, but she knew he understand what she meant.� Again he ran his hand down her cheek, but
this time it did little to calm her.

&nbsp;

�I know this looks horrid, but I just want you to try
it for a while. If you really can�t cope with it, I promise I will take it
off.�� She nodded, knowing she had
promised to do all he asked of her.� It
didn�t ease her fears any though as first he put the gag into her mouth and
then proceeded to fasten on the rest of the hood.� By the time she could no longer feel his
hands, panic began to fill her.

&nbsp;

Her breathing, already limited by the corset, grew
even shorter.� She could feel the sweat
on her face as she started to grow dizzy.�
Her moans sounded loud in her ears, but she had no idea if he could even
hear them.

&nbsp;

He could see her body shaking and hear her muffled
moans and knew she was starting to panic. As beautiful as she looked in the
hood, he realized he had to take it off.�
As he lifted it off her, he saw her pale face and was surprised by the
rush of emotions he felt. As her friend he wanted to protect her, but the other
part of him just wanted to satisfy his need to see her suffer.

&nbsp;

�Shush love, it�s ok. Not
everyone can handle a hood.� His words made her feel a bit better, though it
did little to ease her other pains. He placed the ball gag she had worn earlier
in her mouth and then covered her eyes with a blindfold. Again she was in the
dark, but this time she didn�t feel the smothering panic she had felt with the
hood.

&nbsp;

Now that the hood was gone, she began to feel anew
what he had done to her body.� She gasped
as she felt a buzzing in her pussy and ass, the fake cocks rubbing against each
other. With her eyes covered, it seemed like she was even more aware of her
body, the buzzing starting to have an effect.�


&nbsp;

Tom watched as she began to react to the low
vibrations, intrigued by the way she was trying to move.�� He moved around her, his hand running over
her bare ass.� He could hear her moans as
her body shook, his hand slapping her bottom firmly a few times before he moved
back to stand in front of her.

&nbsp;

He pressed the remote again, not to change the speed
of the dildos but to activate the pad resting over her clit.� He only put it on low at first, but the way
she had screamed, anyone would have thought he had shocked her.� Moving in front of her again, he placed one
hand over her clit while the other played with the clamps on her breasts.

&nbsp;

She felt like everything was getting tighter as her
clit throbbed and threatened to send her over the edge yet again.�� She couldn�t even bend her knees or elbows
and it just seemed harder and harder to breath. Her
clit was on fire as she felt the dildos moving inside of her.� Suddenly she was rocked by the strongest
orgasm she�d had all day, her body trying to shake in her binds.

&nbsp;

Seeing the way she was straining, he knew she would
hate it even more when he upped the speed on the remote.� Pressing the button to increase the speed of
both the dildos and the clit pad, he heard her high pitched squeal. 

&nbsp;

She didn�t think she could take much more as she felt
yet another orgasm building. She felt totally helpless and just wanted to
scream at him to stop her torment. As it was, all she could do was try to make
some sense behind the gag.� 

&nbsp;

Watching her orgasm yet again, he decided to give her
a break.� Turning everything off, he
removed her blindfold, seeing her eyes closed as her orgasm continued.� He removed the gag too, wanting to talk to
her before going on.� 

&nbsp;

Slowly she opened her eyes, aware that something was
different but not sure what yet.� It took
her a moment to realize the blindfold and gag were gone, and even longer for
her addled brain to work out the vibrations had stopped.� Flinching as Tom�s hand ran down her
tear-streaked face, she closed her eyes, not wanting to look at him.

&nbsp;

�Marie, look at me.��
She could hear him speaking to her, but still kept her eyes closed.� �Look at me!� His voice was firmer than she
had heard it before and she found herself not able to keep her eyes shut any
longer.

&nbsp;

He saw her open her eyes, relieved that she had
responded to him.� Taking her chin gently
in his hand, he could see her mistrust of him in her eyes. �Baby, you have done
really well and you are almost finished.�
Do you think you can go on for just a bit more for me?�� 

&nbsp;

She took a while before she could answer him, her mind
in a whirl and her body starting to feel very stiff and sore. �I don�t know, it feels too tight.� She could see
disappointment in his face and despite her discomfort felt like she was letting
him down. �Maybe I could go on for a little bit longer.�

&nbsp;

His smile was wide as he came down to kiss her, his
lips soft on hers.� She melted into him,
almost forgetting the pain she was feeling.�
When he drew away from her, he stroked her cheek, looking deep into her
eyes.

&nbsp;

�Thank you. I am so proud of you and for your bravery
I am willing to remove one item right now.��
She felt a rush of pride at his words and thought about what item she
wanted rid off the most.� Out of all the
things, the one she just didn�t think she could take any more of was whatever
he had in her ass and pussy.� 

&nbsp;

�Could you take those things out of me.�� She hoped he wouldn�t make her say it more
explicitly.� Relief washed over her when
he nodded and bent to gently remove the offending cocks.� Once they were out, she still hurt but at
least she wouldn�t have to suffer another orgasm like the last few.� 

&nbsp;

He had been almost certain this would be the item she
would choose and didn�t tell her it fitted in with his plans nicely.� However, he had meant it when he had said he
was proud of her, and didn�t want to push her limits too much. After all, he
did love her and didn�t want to risk loosing her forever if things went badly. 

&nbsp;

He went behind her, bending down to release the rope
holding the arm binder in place.� He then
undid the rope around her hair and pulled her arms up until her upper body was
forced forward. When she was in the position he wanted, he tied the binder off
to the ring above her.� The effect was
that she in the perfect position for him to use anyway he wanted to.� 

&nbsp;

She knew that he would want to use her body again and
wished it could be like it had been that morning.� She just hoped he would be fast, the new
position making it even harder to breath.� He came around in front of her and she was in
no way surprised to see his cock in his hand. It was buried in her throat
before she knew it and after only a few quick, deep thrusts, he had moved
around behind her.� 

&nbsp;

She tried to move away from his probing fingers as
they pushed into her ass.� She still
wasn�t fully comfortable with him using her there, but it didn�t seem he was
going to give her much choice in the matter.�
His fingers left her ass, returning with some more lube before she felt
his cock take their place. 

&nbsp;

The other night she had only become aware of his cock
once it was already in her, but now it was like she could feel every vein and
ridge.� He was taking it slow but still
it hurt.� Crying out, she felt him rub
his hands up her back, but it didn�t ease her pain any.

&nbsp;

He didn�t want to hurt her but despite going slowly,
she still seemed to be in pain.� �Relax
baby and push out, it will make it easier.� He could feel her trying to do what
he said and he found his cock slipping in a bit easier.� Her moans were still loud though and he
stopped moving for a while to try to let her get used to the feel of his cock. 

&nbsp;

With his cock sitting still within her ass, she tried
to catch her breath. Her ass felt so full and she knew it was only going to get
worse.� It all seemed too much and she
started to cry.� First her sobs were soft
but as her emotions took over the sobs increased in strength.� 

&nbsp;

Hearing her soft cries turn louder he debated what to
do.� Usually he would just continue, but
since this morning he found his feelings clouded.� Never before had he so loved any of the women
he had played with.� He found himself
feeling guilty for pushing her to do something she didn�t want to do and pulled
out of her ass.� 

&nbsp;

Over the next few minutes, he released her from all of
her restraints, her sobs not ceasing despite his actions. He picked her up in
his arms and carried her through the house to his bathroom. Turning on his spa,
he placed her gently in the water, while he undressed fully and stepped in to
join her.� 

&nbsp;

Marie became aware that she was in water, but didn�t
know how she got there. The last thing she remembered was his cock filling her
ass. She mentally checked her body and only felt his hands gently surrounding
her.� Opening her eyes, she saw they were
in a different room and she was in a spa of some kind.� 

&nbsp;

She closed her eyes again, letting the bubbles soothe
her tired body.� His hands rubbed softly
over her breasts, but they did not worry her, so long as he remained
gentle.� Her mind began to clear a bit
more and she started to think back more to what must have happened.

&nbsp;

�Suddenly she
sat up and turned to look at him, understanding now what he had done for her.
�Tom, I don�t understand. I said I would do one more thing for you and yet you
stopped.�� He sighed as he looked at her
surprised face. 

&nbsp;

�I may love my bondage sweetheart but I do love you
more.� I just couldn�t continue with you
being so upset.� I know; it surprised me
too!�� He pulled her to him and hugged
her close, feeling her snuggle into him.�
They remained that way for a few moments before she pulled away from
him.

&nbsp;

�Tom, I want you to finish what you started.� I promised you I would give you a weekend and
you didn�t get to finish.� She took in a deep breath and said the words she
didn�t think she would ever say to him. �You can even put me back in all those
things if you want to.�� 

&nbsp;

He was so amazed that she had asked him to continue to
even know how to answer her.� Stroking
her hair, he could feel her shake and knew she would only be doing it for
him.�� He again felt a burst of pride at
her courage but hesitated in giving her an answer.� He didn�t want to cause her so much distress
again, but he would love to finish what he had started.� 

&nbsp;

�Love, are you sure?��
She looked down first and then nodded. It was all he needed to make up
his mind.� Taking her face in his hands,
he kissed her gently before moving her face up to look at him again. �I think
if you are willing to continue we can but I think we can keep things simple
this time.� 

&nbsp;

Not sure what he meant, she waited for him to
explain.� However, all he did was pull
her around so she had her back to him again. She felt his fingers gently
probing her ass and unlike before, didn�t try to pull away. In fact, she realized
that in her more relaxed state his fingers didn�t hurt as much. 

&nbsp;

She felt him replace his fingers with the head of his
cock, but unlike earlier, he didn�t just thrust in.� She pushed down a bit, feeling the head of
his cock enter into her ass. It still stretched her but without the force of
him pushing, she felt so much more in control.�
After a few minutes of pushing down on him, she was surprised that he
was fully in her ass.� 

&nbsp;

He smiled as she started to move slowly on him.� As much as he wanted to take control, he knew
by letting her set the pace, the more comfortable she would be.� Then he would be able to take over in
time.� He held her waist lightly, as she
rose and fell above him. 

&nbsp;

Moving his hand to tickle her clit, he was rewarded by
her moans.� He slowly moved her till her
body was lying face down in the water, her chin resting on the side of the spa.
Taking a firmer grip on her waist, he began to thrust powerfully into her.

&nbsp;

She was surprised that though she felt full, she did
not feel the pain she had felt earlier.�
His hand returned to her clit and she knew she would come again soon. He
felt his cock swelling and soon he was cumming in her warm hole.� He continued to pump her hard as he came, his
grunts mixing in with her moans.��
Finally he was done and pulled out of her, her body still lying where he
had moved her.� 

&nbsp;

She lay, sublime, pleased that she had been able to
take him in her ass.� Her orgasm had not
been as strong as the others she�d had that day, but she wasn�t surprised.� She realized he was no longer gripping her waist
and rolled over to look up at him.

&nbsp;

He was smiling at her and she just couldn�t help
smiling back.� Suddenly he was her old
friend again and she moved to hug him.�
She couldn�t deny that the weekend had been a challenge, but now it was
over she was glad she had at least given it a go.

&nbsp;

�Well, you made it.�
I am very proud of you, though I can tell you
now I was worried you wouldn�t speak to me again, especially after today.�� She snuggled into his chest, just wanting to
feel him holding her.

&nbsp;

�Yes, I wasn�t so sure either.� But I just want you to hold me for now.� She
heard him sigh as he held her close.� She
didn�t know how long they stayed that way, but after a while she felt him
move.� She looked up, his smile sweet as
he brushed her hair back.� He held out
his hand and they both stepped out of the spa together. 

&nbsp;

He watched as she dried her body, seeing some faint
marks still on her body but nothing that would give away all she had been
through over the weekend.� He handed her
a robe to put on and then led her to her room so she could get dressed. 

&nbsp;

Half an hour later, they were both eating a light
lunch before he had to take her to the train station.� They had not spoken since he had left her to
get dressed and he knew he had to find out her thoughts on the weekend.� 

&nbsp;

�Marie, now that the weekend is almost over, I have to
ask what you thought. Please, I need you to be honest,
I won�t be upset if you hated it all.� He smiled as she considered his
question. He was surprised at how nervous he was at hearing her reaction, if
only because he didn�t want anything that had happened to come between them.

&nbsp;

She thought about what he had asked and despite having
thought of nothing else for the whole weekend, found it hard to put her
feelings into words.� She knew that at
different times over the weekend, her thoughts had gone from pure hate of what
he was doing to pure bliss.� 

&nbsp;

�Tom, I know you would love me to say it was all
wonderful, but I you know that would be a lie.�
You were right when you said it would be hard and at times I hated you
for causing me so much pain.�� He looked
a bit shaken at her response, but she continued on.� �However, if I am honest, there were also
times when I also felt so wonderful.� He seemed a bit more pleased, and reached
out to take her hand in his.

&nbsp;

�Marie, I did push you very hard but I needed you to
really know what I liked. If I had been less than honest about what I like,
that wouldn�t have been fair to both of us.� She nodded and he thought she
looked a bit upset.� Standing, she went
to get a drink and when she returned, she seemed to be calm again.� 

&nbsp;

She sipped her water, not sure why his statement had
upset her. She figured part of it was hearing him being so honest, but then she
also knew what he said was true. She had wanted to find out about what he liked
and now that it was over, she knew that it was not for her.� 


�Oh Tom, you certainly did push me but I am not sorry I asked you. You know,
despite my body aching in places I never knew I even had, I feel closer to you than
I ever have.� She lifted her face to his as he came around to hug her. Looking
up at the clock, she could see it was time for her to get her bag packed.

&nbsp;

Moving away from him, she headed up to finish getting
packed, the reality of leaving his home starting to sink in. She sat down on
the edge of the bed, wishing there was a way she could stay with him.�� Sighing, she knew though she loved him
dearly and would do almost anything to stay with him, there was no way she
could satisfy his needs.� Even if she
tried, she knew she would end up hating him or at least his treatment of her.

&nbsp;

Finally, she roused herself and packed her bags,
heading back down to find Tom sitting on the couch. He seemed in a pensive mood
and she guessed he was having similar thoughts to the ones she�d had
upstairs.� Sitting her bags on the floor,
she went to sit beside him.

&nbsp;

He looked up as she sat down, her bags sitting on the
ground behind her.� �All packed
then?�� He knew he sounded more cheerful
then he felt. When she nodded he picked up her bags and headed out to the
car.� Placing her bags in the car, he
moved around to hold the door open for her only to see the tears on her face. 

&nbsp;

�Oh baby, please don�t cry. I know saying goodbye will
be hard, but we�ll see each other again.��
He didn�t want to think of what could have been,
the thought just too painful.� She smiled
at him, wiping away her tears.� 

&nbsp;

�I�m sorry Tom, I told myself I wouldn�t cry, at least
not until I was on the train.�� She
turned to get into the car, needing to get control of herself.� Once she was seated, he shut her door and
headed to the driver�s seat. She didn�t look at him as he drove, her mind
drifting between the last time she had been in his car and the thought of getting
on the train.� 

&nbsp;

It hardly seemed to take any time to get to the
station and before she knew it she was standing on the platform, her bags
already loaded onto the train.� There was
so much she wanted to say and yet she couldn�t think how to say any of it.� They both knew there was no hope for the kind
of relationship they wanted.

&nbsp;

Tom turned to her and she only had to look into his
eyes to see he was hurting as much as she was.�
Again her tears threatened to fall, but she managed to hold them
back.� Without a word he kissed her, a
long, slow kiss that made her knees go weak.�


&nbsp;

He had to make himself pull away from her, his mind
telling him he had to let her go. The message over the speaker warned them they
only had a few minutes until the train departed.� He brushed back her hair and hugged her one
last time.

&nbsp;

�I have left a little surprise in your handbag, but
don�t look until you are on the train.��
He pulled back and walked with her to the door of the carriage.� 

&nbsp;

�Bye Tom, I�ll ring you when I get home.� He nodded,
already thinking how much he was going to miss her.� He watched as she entered the carriage and
took her seat, her beautiful face looking sad as she tried to hold back her
tears.� 

&nbsp;

She so wanted to see what he had left her but knew she
should wait like he had asked her to do.�
He waved to her through the window and she again wished things could be
different, or at least that she could be different.� Finally the train began to move and after a
few minutes he was gone.� 

&nbsp;

Looking around her, she was pleased to see that she
was alone in her part of the carriage. She didn�t know what he had left her but
didn�t want to risk prying eyes seeing something they shouldn�t.� At first she couldn�t find anything, but then
remembered the outside zip. 

&nbsp;

Pulling out the small parcel, she saw there was a note and a piece of soft rope. Smiling she placed the
rope in her lap and opened up the note.�
�My beautiful Marie,� she read, � You are a
wonderful woman and I need you to know that I would love to spend my life with
you, but we both know why that will never happen.� So instead, know that you are loved and that
anytime you want a bit of kinky fun, you know whom to call.� Love Tom.�� 

&nbsp;

She didn�t know whether to laugh or cry, but what she
did know was that it had been worth the risk to spend the weekend with
him.� Whatever happened in Europe,
she knew she had made the right choice.�
She carefully put his note and the rope back into her bag and closed her
eyes, as the train took her to a future made all the better by knowing Tom
loved her.

&nbsp;

The end
