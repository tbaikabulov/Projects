Synopsis: White male drinks the cum of 20 Black men in a ritual ceremony.A full moon hung heavy in the summer night sky. It was like a scene from a movie
  but the reality of it was brought home to Graham by his heightened sense of
  arousal and the majesty of the individuals before him. He had been selected
  from a long list of applicants to witness a special ceremony like none other.
  The Southern Regional Obeah Society was having a rites of passage ceremony
  for one of its most exalted members. To the outside world, the organization
  was nothing more than a Black BDSM group that promoted Black Supremacy. In
  actuality, it was nothing of the sort. It was a group formed to restore true
  Afrocentric principles and governing regulations to those that chose to acknowledge
  Africa as their spiritual and cultural homeland. Hoards of submissive whites
  flocked to the S.R.O.S. members because they were so comfortable with their
  sexuality and power and it served as a natural aphrodisiac for those wishing
  to relinquish some white guilt. On this weekend, the Divine Mother Mistress
  Olutuunde was being given the title of Goddess. It was a sacred ceremony with
  traditions and practices taken from several West African religions and adapted
  to contemporary African American sensibilities. Meaning, no goats were sacrificed,
  no genitals were mutilated, but there was an amazing feast of food and libations
  and traditional dress, dance and ritual. 
Graham had been escorted blindfolded to a remote compound outside of Atlanta
  . His sense of direction was fine for a while, they started out on I-20 and
  made their way south on I-75. His chauffeurs obviously didn't want him to know
  their exact destination so there were some twists and turns en route that were
  intended to throw him off. They arrived at what seemed to be a four hour journey
  at a remote 30 acre piece of land that surely had been the property of a genteel
  slave master in days gone by. Graham was the only white person there and his
  own insecurities made him more self-conscious than the actual treatment he
  received. Everyone treated him with casual deference. He was insignificant
  to the weekend's festivities and he knew his place was to watch and to observe
  and to await his time to serve. 
Friday night, he witnessed all the weary travelers arrive and find their accommodations.
  There were about 35 to 40 guests in all; the majority of which were Black males.
  There were a handful of women that were also high ranking priestesses in the
  order, but this weekend they were acting as maidens to Divine Mother Olutuunde.
  They were to cater to her every need. Graham noticed that the Divine Mother
  treated them all with respect. He imagined that a white woman would not be
  as gracious with a similar amount of power, and wondered silently why there
  seemed to be no signs of jealousy among the women. His sensitivities to the
  differences in behavior were heightened by the fact that the he was the lone
  Caucasian in the group and he had no choice but to remark on the differing
  patterns. The rest of the women in attendance had risen to the ranks of Goddess
  already and were going to be officiating the ceremony. They remained out of
  sight mostly, preparing themselves with prayer and meditation in the solitude
  of nature. They were drawing on all of the spiritual energies and ancestors
  needed to raise Mistress Olu's vibrational pattern to that of a Deity. 
Saturday morning began a day of preparation and festivities. The Divine Mother
  was not to have her feet touch the ground so she was carried upon the shoulders
  of four men wherever she needed to be taken. She actually had no such need;
  anything and everything she desired would be brought to her with the snap of
  her fingers. The four men stood by her like sentinels guarding the throne.
  The women groomed the Divine mother all day, lavishing luxury and pleasure
  on her. Graham watched from the periphery, constantly aroused and amazed by
  the beautiful brown bodies before him. 
The hand maidens took great pleasure in attending to the honoree. Graham watched
  in amazement while they washed the long, beautiful dreadlocs of the Divine
  Mother, at how they used a liquid black soap to create volumes of suds and
  massaged them gently from root to tip. They gently and repeatedly poured purified
  spring water from a pitcher through her hair until no signs of lather remained.
  The maidens then created a hairstyle that looked like a crown with her locks,
  and momentarily, Graham was ashamed that his fine, limp hair could not duplicate
  any such style. 
He watched in awe as they bathed her body. From head to toe, they caressed
  her smooth brown skin. Each maiden knew that one day she would be in the same
  position and she lavished all the pampering and care she would want on herself,
  creating a space in the universe for her actions to be returned in kind when
  it was her time to ascend. Intricate henna tattoos of ancient Adinkra symbols
  were skillfully applied to Olutuunde's spine, a spiritual road map of sorts
  for her energy to be raised up through her chakras. Melted shea butter was
  poured all over her and all ten hands of her lady servants massaged it in to
  every pore. Her skin glistened and glowed with rich deep tones and smooth,
  velvety perfection. 
Graham swallowed hard as the women prepared to shave the beautiful cunt of
  Mistress Olu. She lay back on the down filled mattress and spread her legs.
  The male attendants stood erect in more ways than one, in their color sarongs
  and bare chests, as they watched. Graham was light headed, awed by all the
  beautiful Ebony bodies before him. He wished he could just disappear into the
  surroundings but there was little need for his nervousness; his presence there
  was more like that of a pet than a participant. 
They lathered her gorgeous mons and sharpened the straight-edged razor with
  precision and skill. Slowly . . . methodically . . . and with exacting movements,
  every hair was removed to reveal the silky, soft folds of black femininity.
  They repeated the procedure again, leaving her naked in a way that seemed more
  tangible than just having no clothes on. Her pussy lips were like that of a
  flower, delicately opening to reveal her inner most treasure. 
Each maiden, one by one, knelt at Olu's core and made tribute with her mouth.
  Each woman kissed, licked, and sucked that sweet pussy while the Divine Mother
  lay writhing in sensual ecstasy. Mother Olutuunde shuddered through a string
  of never-ending orgasms. Graham, knowing he could not relieve himself during
  the weekend's activities, stood in tortured agony awaiting his turn. His chance
  to drink from the beautiful Mistress was not to come any time soon. His opportunity
  to feast at the divine core was to come at a much later, more crucial stage
  in the weekend. 
He made his way around the rest of the compound, pausing to take note of the
  strength and beauty of all of the people that surrounded him. He wondered inwardly
  how their ancestors could ever have been confused for being inferior. He marveled
  at their bodies, their skin, and their presence. Everything about them reeked
  of royalty and magnificence. 
Graham casually strolled to the barn on the property where no less than 20
  black men were in various states of undress; all of whom were eating, drinking,
  dancing, drumming and working out. They were preparing for the night's main
  event. They were bonding; each man hand selected by a private council to participate
  in the initiation. Ascending to the position of Deity in the secret order is
  the second highest honor of the resurrected African tradition. The highest
  honor and privilege went to the men who were selected to impregnate the initiate.
  As Goddess Mother, she was to give birth to a Prince or Princess that would
  one day reign supreme. No one man could be selected to father such a child
  lest his ego become distorted with delusions of grandeur. Twenty men were selected,
  each for their special talents, abilities, and skills, to provide love, nurturing,
  support, guidance and the genetic materials to assist in the creation of the
  wonder child. No one would ever know who the biological father of the child
  was and it was of no importance. Yes, for a mother, the child would have the
  mother of all mothers and he or she would have twenty fathers that would love
  and protect him or her for life. The child would be the collective of the most
  superior genetic stuff possible. Graham watched as the men prepared and secretly
  hoped that their sperm would be the one to impregnate the Divine Mother Goddess. 
Night fell and electricity grew in the air. It was a wild frenzy of celebration
  and circumstance. A huge bonfire burned and spat glowing embers to the cleared
  holy grounds, the land that held the bones of ancient survivors of chains of
  slavery and tyranny. Graham was a part of the processional, led in on a leash
  attached to his cock and balls. His pink erection looked almost laughable in
  comparison to the columns of Ebony flesh sported by Black priests of the secret
  Obeah society. He made himself comfortable on one of the hammocks and prepared
  for a long night. 
Incantations were recited in strange tongues and prayers were sent up to the
  heavens. Twenty men were to make love to this woman, which could conceivably
  take twenty hours or more if left to their own devices. Each man was limited
  to 15 minutes to not only deposit his load into the Divine Mother, but to give
  her pleasure. They had refrained from any sexual contact for six weeks and
  eaten a strictly vegan diet to prepare for their responsibility. Olu had prepared
  as well. In addition to her fasting and meditation, she had been trained in
  ancient Kemetic sexual practices from other women who had ascended to the rank
  of Goddess. They taught her magical techniques that the Western mind would
  find inconceivable. She was prepared to give all the men the most memorable
  night of their lives in more ways than one. 
The Divine Mother Mistress Olutuunde was carried in on the shoulders of her
  four body guards on their shoulders and placed on an altar. It was designed
  to have her comfortably recline in a position where her pelvis was at the same
  level of her lovers and allow the sperm to collect in her womb. She was radiant
  and joyful, almost too peaceful for someone about to be given the title of
  living God. 
Each man that had been selected to contribute his load to the mix stood in
  anticipation. They stroked themselves to arousal in a huge circle jerk of masculine
  showmanship. The maidens licked and kissed Olu in a grand display of lesbian
  foreplay. That alone was enough to get ancestral spirits aroused but that was
  not to be the grand finale as it were. A cloth bag with a mudcloth pattern
  was circulated between the men. Each man drew a smooth stone with a symbol
  carved into it. That was to be the order in which they were to �perform�. A
  high priestess would send up a prayer and reach in another bag and pull out
  a stone. The individual with the matching symbol would be the next in line
  to perform. 
Graham was in agony; his balls were aching and he was desperate for some relief.
  The numb ache he felt was a turn on, he liked being deprived of satisfaction,
  it was his fetish. He knew that when the time came for him to release it would
  be explosive. 
The crowd was in a frenzy, desperate to know who would be the first. They
  were chanting and dancing and drumming and praying. Naked black bodies gyrated
  and moved in trancelike fashion. 
The first symbol was pulled. The lucky frontrunner was an artist and musician
  named Heru from the Philadelphia area. He was honey vanilla in complexion and
  had locs that cascaded down his back. His 6'even frame was sinewy yet muscular
  and his stomach looked like a rippled washboard. The muscles in his lean, athletic
  thighs flexed as he approached the altar. He looked down on Olu with love and
  affection and they tenderly touched fingertips in an act of intimacy. For the
  first five minutes of their exchange, they kissed. They kissed the kiss of
  eternal lovers reunited after a lifetime of separation. Silence fell over the
  crowd out of reverence and respect. Their kisses grew more passionate and more
  compelling, to a feverish pitch. Olutuunde's body arched up to receive Heru
  and they joined together for the first time. Everyone took a deep breath at
  that very moment except for Heru and Olu. They cried out into the night in
  sensual bliss. 
Tears formed in Heru's eyes as he experienced a sensation like he'd never
  felt before. He was confined in a prison of pure heaven and it was blissful
  torture. Olutuunde experienced pleasure of her own; Heru's dick was reaching
  her spot and stimulating her to fits of orgasmic bliss. She fucked him back,
  giving him pussy like he'd never dreamt possible. 
Graham watched, a lump in his throat, as the two lovers put on a performance
  that rivaled the best adult film he had ever seen. Never in his life had he
  witnessed two such beautiful black specimens in such a passionate exchange.
  Heru was glistening with sweat, Olu was moaning out into the night like an
  animal. Their body movements were like a dance. He fucked her harder and she
  responded in kind. The muscles in his ass flexed as he pumped and pumped some
  more. His steely erection was coated in her juices and he dug his fingers into
  her hips as he stood motionless and emptied himself physically and emotionally
  into the Goddess. 
One by one, symbols were called and Ebony suitors stepped up to the task.
  Graham watched as men the color of the sweetest molasses to rusty brown to
  golden tan and every color in between drove their hard cocks between the sweet
  thighs of the Mother Earth. Each man brought his own technique yet the all
  seemed to melt under the auspices of the task at hand. None seemed prepared
  to encounter the velvety walls of a true Goddess and many needed to be carried
  away in exhaustion and defeat. Graham watched as each ebony cock was withdrawn
  from Olu, glistening with the previous loads of cum that had been deposited
  and his mouth watered with envy. After a few hours, he moved closer to the
  scene, no one seeming to care if he got a closer look. 
As the night wore on, the men who had already gone began to get aroused again
  and pair off with the maidens. Not restricted to a time limit, they began to
  fuck like wild animal in the summer night air. Those that had yet to get their
  turn began to stroke each other. It was an African spiritual orgy, sex the
  way it was intended to be: open and free and without inhibition. Graham was
  high from the scent of sex and sweat and incense. He moved closer still, close
  enough to be but a few feet away from the vessel of Olutuunde. White frothy
  cum seeped from her lips and he openly wept and stroked his little erection
  furiously. Hard black cocks, attached to gorgeous Black men, fucking a Goddess
  right before his eyes was more than he could stand. 
In the wee hours of the morning when the last man approached, everyone gathered
  around closely. The Most High Priestess stood at Olutuunde's head and proclaimed
  to the night sky that her energy had raised to that of a Goddess. She spoke
  of her new powers and everyone stood in reverence to the birth of divinity
  before them. The last participant stood at the entrance to her soul. He took
  aim and penetrated her deeply. Olu reached yet another orgasm and a strange
  light appeared to emanate from somewhere within her. Graham blinked, thinking
  perhaps it was delirium and orgasm denial that had him seeing such things.
  He was in a dream state. 
The last man fell to his knees and sobbed. He was carried away while everyone
  else seemed to still be at a feverish high. The High Priestess officiating
  called Graham's name and said something in Yoruba that he could not understand.
  He knew his duty. He knelt between the legs of the Goddess. In true African
  tradition, the seed of the men that had collectively impregnated her could
  not be spilled. The other maidens could not be expected to perform such a duty,
  it was understood that only a white cum slut like Graham could perform such
  a task. 
Graham swallowed hard again. Olutuunde's cunt was raw and swollen and dripping
  with cum. Her inner pink flesh was crimson in color. Her sweat smelled sweet
  and the aroma from her pussy was a cum lover's perfume. Graham was desperate
  to lick her, to clean her well fucked pussy. Her swollen clit looked like a
  tiny dick, hard and erect and needing attention. The blood rushed to his face.
  All at once, the reality that he was going to taste the cunt of a Goddess hit
  him and tried to run out of fear. He wasn't worthy of such a task. The men
  assigned to guard the Goddess Mother held him by his arms, not allowing him
  to flee. The Most High Priestess grabbed him by the hair and moved his face
  closer and closer, his tongue just millimeters from the treasure. Graham was
  torn with emotion. He wanted to drink the cum from the Goddess Mother more
  than anything, he wanted to run, he was aroused at being controlled by the
  sexy men that towered above him and he wanted to stroke his cock with a desperation
  of a man that needed it to live. 
His heartbeat was pounding louder than the drums and he heard sounds come
  from him that he didn't recognize. He blacked out for a minute, only to be
  brought back to consciousness with his mouth lapping up the sweet cream of
  twenty black men. Through it all, he could taste the sweet cream of the Divine
  Mother Goddess. The silky smooth lips of her pussy were like velvet. She sat
  up for the first time for the evening and cum poured from her like a fountain
  and he tried to swallow it all. His lips formed a seal around her hole and
  he drank steadily. He swallowed mouthful after mouthful of what seemed to be
  an endless supply of Black cum. Assured that he wouldn't run, the guards released
  Graham's arms. Instinctively, he began stroking his hard cock. He drove his
  tongue deep inside the Goddess Mother and tried with all his might to lick
  her sweet inner walls. He was drunk with fantasies of sucking black cocks and
  eating shaved pussies and drinking the cum of superior men. 
Graham reached up and spread the full, brown asscheeks of the Divine Goddess
  Mother and dove his tongue in to taste what cum had collected there. He tasted
  her musky flavors and stroked his own cock that much harder. Inspired by the
  attention to her asshole that had largely been neglected all night in lieu
  of her mission to conceive, Olutuunde began to relish the stimulation to her
  sensitive back hole. Alive with sexual energy, she began to hump her glorious,
  sexy asshole on Graham's tongue. Graham, inspired by the thought that he could
  give pleasure to the Goddess-elect, began to zero in on her clit with the hopes
  of causing her to reach her final orgasm of the night. 
He glanced momentarily at the others in an act of asking permission. No one
  made an effort to stop him. He held her lips open and embraced her sensitive
  spot with his lips. Olutuunde began moaning loudly. He used his tongue to lap
  at it gently, circling it, caressing it softly. He could feel her thighs tighten
  up around his head. He began a relentless assault with his tongue and lips
  on her clit and held on for dear life. He could feel the tremors in her legs
  start and her panting was out of control. He licked more. His cock was ready
  to explode. He sucked her clit and sent both Olu and himself over the edge
  of pleasure, crashing to a climactic ending. 
That Sunday morning, everyone lounged casually and ate to recuperate. Graham
  wanted to recount the previous events with others, to talk about how he had
  made the Queen Goddess cum with his mouth, but no one had a reason to converse
  with him. He watched as everyone packed to return home and continue to go about
  their lives in an every day fashion. He rode home, blindfolded and painfully
  erect, only to be able to know that he still had the cum of 21 of the most
  superior and beautiful black people in his belly.
