 Liam's Mistake

Synopsis:     Accepting a stranger's ride in the middle of the night was the last mistake Liam would ever make...






The night was stormy, and the lonely country road was empty. The downpour was fierce, and though only a few hours before it had been a warm summer evening, the rain was now coming in hard and fast, slanting through the night, splattering across the windshield of my car as I drove slowly, the brights of my headlights on.

I almost didn't see the dark figure trudging along the side of the road. He walked slowly and forlornly, his head bowed to the weather, his thin black shirt and jeans clinging to his wet skin.
I pulled over and stopped the car. Rolling down my window, I saw that he was only a boy, maybe 15, of asian descent.

�Hey kid, you want a ride?�
He took a step back and looked quizzically at me.
�I don&#8217;t see how it matters much. I&#8217;m not really going anywhere.�&nbsp; He tried to hold himself up proudly, but I could see him shivering.
�C&#8217;mon, you&#8217;re going die of hypothermia if you stay out here any longer.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll drop you off anywhere.�
�Thanks, but no thanks mister, I&#8217;ve nowhere to go.�
�Look, kid.&nbsp; You can spend the night at my house.&nbsp; It&#8217;s warm there and at least you&#8217;ll get out of the rain.�
He thought for a moment, looked at me, looked down the road both directions, then looked at me again.
�Fuck it, I&#8217;ll come. Thank you.�
He hopped into the car and sat on the passengers seat.&nbsp; I thumbed the heated seat button and turned on the heat vents, blasting him with hot air, and he sighed appreciatively as he warmed up.

Once he got comfortable, I stuck out my hand.
�I&#8217;m Jack,� I said �nice to meet you.�
He gripped my hand and shook, �Liam, nice to meet you as well. Thanks for picking me up.�
�Not at all, I don&#8217;t live far from here, and my parents aren&#8217;t at home for the weekend. I could use the company.�
�You still live with my parents?�
�I&#8217;m 17, of course I do.�
�Oh� you look older, and you&#8217;ve got a nice car.�
�Well, thanks.&nbsp; But yeah��
�yeah��
The awkward silence filled the car for a little bit.
�I&#8217;m 15, just so you know. I don&#8217;t have a car� Liam said.
I chuckled a little bit that.&nbsp; �Well, that seemed pretty obvious.&nbsp; You&#8217;re lucky Asians never seem to age as fast.�
The warm air in the car was getting to him, and he yawned loudly as I drove on through the night.&nbsp; I let him nap in his seat as we drove for the next few miles until we reached the old country house my family owned.
Driving into the circular drive, the gravel crunching under the tires jolted him awake, and he looked up in surprise at the large house looming over him.
�You live here!?� he whispered.
�No, only on the weekends� I said, as we pulled around to the back of the house and entered the garage.
We got out of the car and I opened the back door, heading through the back hall into the kitchen.
Pointing to the other kitchen door, I said, �You can head into the bathroom across the hall and peel off your wet clothes, there are towels hanging on the rack�
�Thanks,� he said as he headed through the door.
�Whipped cream or marshmallows on your hot chocolate?� I called after him as he headed into the bathroom.
�Surprise me� he replied, not hearing as I muttered under my breath, �oh, I will.�

He looked delicious sitting on the couch in the living room. Two towels were wrapped around his smooth naked body.&nbsp; One clung tightly to his hips while the other flowed over his shoulders, the difference between the soft white of the towels and his soft copper skin contrasting nicely.&nbsp; His face was buried in his hot chocolate mug, drinking the last few drops of that warm chocolate liquid, a small dab of whipped cream clinging to his nose.

�You got something here� I said, tapping on my own nose as I sat on the couch across from him.
He smiled and wiped it away before setting the hot chocolate mug on a side table.
�So, Liam, how are you feeling now?� I ask pleasantly.
�Good, thank you� he smiled back at me.
�You seem to be enjoying my hospitality very much, but I would like to be repaid�
He frowned, �I&#8217;m sorry, but I don&#8217;t have any money.�
�That&#8217;s too bad.� I said �But I&#8217;m sure we could come to some� arrangement.&nbsp; Tell me, Liam, have you ever had sex with another boy before?�
He trembled and looked away from me, �N-n-no, sir�
�Well then, Liam, you&#8217;re in for a treat tonight.&nbsp; Stand up for me and drop those towels.�
He looked pleadingly at me as he stood up slowly and dropped the towel that he had been wearing on his shoulders on the couch.&nbsp; His beautiful copper skin looked so invitingly smooth and his pink nipples grew erect at being exposed so to the cold air.
�Good, good. Now drop that last towel, and spin around slowly for me� I said, enjoying the site before me.
�Jack, please, you&#8217;ve been very kind to me, but I don&#8217;t want to do this� he said, with all the courage he could muster showing in his voice.

I frowned.&nbsp; �I said, boy, drop that towel for me.&nbsp; You&#8217;re going to do it, one way or another.� I slowly stood up, letting him see I towered over him.

He gulped, he looked at me, he looked at the door to the hall, and he sprinted.
Or, at least sprinted as best he could with a towel wrapped around his legs.&nbsp; I tackled him as he ran past me and wrestled him onto the ottoman.&nbsp; He screamed for help as I pinned him face down, my legs straddling his back just above the hips, his legs futilely kicking behind me.&nbsp; I pulled his arms behind his back and cinched them together with my belt, taking care to make it good and tight.
�Help! HELP!� he screamed, struggling to pull his arms free as I picked up the towel that had been around his waist, rolled it a couple of times and gagged him with it, tying the ends behind his head.

Beneath he squirmed, writhing back and forth, kicking constantly and screaming as best he could through the gag at the top of his lungs as only a muffled mumbling came through.&nbsp; Feeling the hot Asian struggling naked between my legs made me feel so hard.&nbsp; Exhausted, Liam went limp beneath me, either unable or unwilling to continue the useless struggle.

�Good,� I leaned down to whisper into his ear, �just so you know, Liam, there&#8217;s no one around for miles, no one can hear you scream.�&nbsp; My mouth widened into an evil grin as I saw his eyes go wide.

Picking him up, in fireman&#8217;s carry, I carried my captive boy-slave up the stairs to the landing, through the guest room door, through the door-that-looks-like-a-wall into the old servants&#8217; quarters and up the stairs to a spare bedroom.&nbsp; Tossing him on the bed, I bent down near a wall, as I explained, �This used to be the servants&#8217; quarters way back in the day when people still had servants.&nbsp; We fixed it up into a spare bedroom, but I also use it,� and at this point I had pulled out the false wall and dragged out a trunk, �for my bondage fetish stuff.�


Rummaging through my trunk, I pulled out some necessary materials and lined them up outside, one by one.&nbsp; A black leather collar.&nbsp; Two leather cuffs.&nbsp; A length of chain about 2 feet long.&nbsp; A pair of nipple clamps. A bottle of KY. A ball gag. A few padlocks

I turned around and smile at him, letting him see the tools of his torture and imagining his own punishment.&nbsp; His eyes spread wide and fear, and he struggled on the bed, writhing away from me as best he could.&nbsp; I just smiled and picked up the collar.&nbsp; I chained it around his neck, securing it with a padlock.

I took the two cuffs and wrapped them around his wrists, before locking them to the length of chain.&nbsp; I then pulled the chain up his back and locked it to the back of his collar.&nbsp; His hands secured, I uncinched the belt that I had used to secure him before and took off the towel gag.

Liam remained silent as I tokk a seat on the other side of the room, facing him as he struggled upright and sat on the edge of the bed.&nbsp; Despite his arms pulled up behind his back and chained to the collar he wears around his neck, he still maintained a spirit of rebellion.&nbsp; He shared it with me, expressing it in his posture, his head leaning forward, his shoulders drooping, his mouth formed into a pout.

We stared at each other for a few moments, his eyes filled with defiance, mine with contempt.

�You want this, you know.� I said to him.
�Really.� he sarcastically replied.
�Yes,� I continued smoothly, �You want to feel bound and helpless as my hands slowly caress my skin.&nbsp; You want to me gently run my tongue around your precious nipples, tingling and teasing you as you struggle to push away, but can&#8217;t.&nbsp; You want to feel my hand on your cock, running softly up and down your shaft, slowly, oh so slowly, teasing, tantalizing, torturing you with pressure.�
�You&#8217;re a sick freak.� He said as he turned his head away.&nbsp; The copper tone of his skin made his blush difficult to see, but his hardened cock gave away his lie.
�Maybe I am.&nbsp; But you enjoy it, whether you know it or not, your body does.�
�I don&#8217;t know what you mean,� Liam said, continuing to avert my gaze.
�Of course you do, look at you.&nbsp; Your cock is throbbing, your nipples are hand, you&#8217;re even beginning to pant a little bit. You want it.�
Liam didn&#8217;t reply, he sat there, embarrassed, but clearly aroused.
�Come over here� I said calmly.&nbsp; He did nothing.
�I said get over here now.�

He stood up slowly, his cock standing straight out as he did, and walked slowly over to where I sat, stopping and standing still a few feet from me.

�There, that wasn&#8217;t so I hard,� I said as I reached out and grabbed his balls, making him flinch slightly.&nbsp; Tugging lightly on his sack, I forced him to come even closer, until he straddled my legs.&nbsp; I placed my hands on his hips and ran them slowly, gently over his body, feeling his soft, smooth flesh beneath my fingers, the planes of his back, the smooth orbs of his ass.&nbsp; He shuddered and leaned in involuntarily as my fingers dug into the soft flesh of his butt.&nbsp; I leaned my head in, and my tongue darted out, making slow lazy circles around one of his nipples, then the other.&nbsp; Liam moaned softly in pleasure, feeling his hard nipples teased by my tongue, his body explored by my hands, his own hands chained behind him, powerless to stop me, even if he wanted to.

My head moved lower, and I circled my tongue along the head of his penis, then run it along his slit, delighting in hearing his gasps of pleasure.&nbsp; My lips slid gently over the head as my mouth slowly engulfed his cock, and I felt him thrust forward trying to grind into my face.&nbsp; I took my mouth away, and he sighed in disappointment.&nbsp; I picked up the bottle of KY and squeezed some out into my hand.&nbsp; I then reached between his legs and ran the lube in his crack, between his cheeks, he blushed, and whispered �Please�please don&#8217;t�� but my hand continued, and I slowly circled his anus with my well-lubricated fingers, feeling the puckered hole clench involuntarily beneath my fingers.

My mouth returned to his cock, and as I gently ran my tongue along his head again, I slowly pushed my finger against his hole, feeling, with satisfaction, his body tremble as it slipped in and hearing his sudden gasp.&nbsp; My lips slipped over the head of his cock once more as I slowly moved my finger in and out of the sweating, panting Asian boy straddling my legs.&nbsp; Another fingers joined the first, then another, stretching and widening him as my mouth moved slowly up and his cock.&nbsp; He started moving, slowly at first, then faster as the tension in his body built, desperate to be released.&nbsp; He&#8217;s so close, so close� and then the mouth left and the fingers slid out, leaving an open hole behind.

Liam thrusted into the air, once, twice, three times, desperate to go over the edge.&nbsp; �Please, Jack, Please, I need to cum!� he begged.
�Really? You need to?� I asked, �What will you do for that?�
�Anything! Oh god, Anything!� Liam begged, his cock throbbing wildly, his eyes closed.
�Really?� I said as my arms wrap around him, and my hands caressed his back as I brought him closer to me.&nbsp; I started kissing his stomach, one kiss after another, a trail up his smooth abs. I picked up the ball gag.
�Will you wear this?� I asked, lifting it up for him to see.&nbsp; �Yes� he said, panting heavily.&nbsp; I shove the ball into his mouth and buckled it behind his head.&nbsp; 
�And these?� I asked, holding up the nipple clamps as I sucked gently on one of his nipples, cause him to moan through the gag as his nub grew more erect.&nbsp; He nodded, desperately, emphatically.
I started sucking on his other nipple as I attached the clamp to the previous one.&nbsp; The pain caused him to gasp sharply, and his entire body trembled.&nbsp; A single tear formed in the corner of his eye, but his cock remained hard and throbbing and he blinked it away.
I pulled my mouth away from his second nipple and attached the other clamp.&nbsp; Again he gasps sharply, again his body trembles, and again a tear forms, but his cock throbbed even harder.
�And will you take my hard cock into your ass?� I asked.
Liam paused, and he struggled a little bit for a moment, trying to cum through sheer force of will alone, the chain hanging from his nipple clamps jangling as he did.
Defeated, he nodded, and I unzipped my pants, letting my rock hard cock spring free.
My hands gripped his sides as I guided him over me, until the blunt tip of my member rested against the gaping hole of his ass.
I lowered him slowly onto my cock, feeling his lubricated hole slide tightly down my shaft. So tight, so warm, so good.&nbsp; I softly massaged his cock with my lubricated hand as my other hand wraps around the chain attached to his nipple clamps.&nbsp; Slowly, he started to ride me, lifting up slowly, then plunging down on my cock again.

Sweat poured from his body as he rode up and down, his cock pulsating in my hand as I ran it up and down his hard cock gently, feeling him thrust into it seeking satisfaction.&nbsp; I guided him with every thrust, tugging at his nipples, stroking his cock, mixing pain and pleasure in a symphony of sex.&nbsp; We both came to the brink many times, only for me to tug sharply and slow us down, and with the rise and fall of our copulation, we both panted more heavily, the sweat dripping from us sticking to my clothes, running down our sides.&nbsp; As the hour wore on, his legs trembled with fatigue and exhaustion. Sensing his weakening stamina, I plowed into him with a couple final thrusts, felt the sense of climax rip through my body as I came, spewed my cum inside him as he collapsed on my lap, exhausted, beaten, in pain, and still horny, still hard, and still unable to come.&nbsp; We rest there for a few minutes, him impaled upon my lap, leaning against my shoulder, both of us shuddering and breathing heavily, his hard cock pressed against my stomach.

I lifted him up and helped him get on his feet, before standing up myself.&nbsp; I guide him to the bed and lay him down on his side, then placed my semi-hard cock pack in my pants.

Returning to the trunk, I pulled out a few more things.&nbsp; A couple more leather cuffs and padlocks. Another length of chain.&nbsp; A couple small bells.&nbsp; A special stool with a dildo affixed on top.&nbsp; And a strange device that Liam didn&#8217;t recognize.&nbsp; I slowly set up the equipment in the middle of the room.&nbsp; I attached the cuffs to either side of the stool and the padlock the chain to the back of the stool.&nbsp; The bells I set aside.&nbsp; The strange device I plugged into the wall and attached the stool.

I turned to Liam on the bed.&nbsp; He had recovered, somewhat.&nbsp; He looked exhausted, and his cock wasn&#8217;t as throbbingly hard as it was before.&nbsp; His heart rate and breathing levels had returned to normal.&nbsp; I attached the bells to his collar and his nipple clamps, hanging a padlock from the chain to constantly tug on him.&nbsp; I guided him over to the stool where I cuffed his ankles to the side of the stool, then slowly lowered him onto the dildo, the smooth plastic sliding up his hole, still leaking my cum until he&#8217;s seated on the stool.&nbsp; I then took the chain locked to the back of the stool and locked it to the cuffs around his wrists. Finally, I took the device and slid it over his cock.&nbsp; The head of his cock was now encased in metal, and a small chain dangled from it, where it rested on the metal top of the stool attached to the rest of the device.

He looked at me in fear and confusion.&nbsp; I smiled back at him.&nbsp; �You&#8217;re in for an interesting night.� I told him.

With that, I flipped the switch.&nbsp; The shock hit his cock, and he screamed through the gag as he tries to jump off the stool.&nbsp; The chain left the metal stool, and the connection broke, but the chain attached to his wrists hindered his movement, and he was left, poised over the stool, the head of the dildo in his rear, a small chain hanging from his twitching member as he crouched over the stool, his legs bent.&nbsp; His body trembled, and the bells gently rang, the padlock attached to his nipples swinging back and forth.&nbsp; His legs grow tired, and he slowly lowered himself back onto the dildo.&nbsp; As he moved down, the chain attached to his cock brushes the stool, and the shock went through him again, once again launching him upwards.&nbsp; In realization, he stared at me in fear, begging through his gag to be freed.

The endless cycle of pain he is sentenced to was apparent.&nbsp; If he lowered himself down, not only did it drive a cock up his ass, but his cock was electrocuted.&nbsp; If he kept himself up, his legs grew more and more tired, unable to support him long in a bent position.&nbsp; His legs, as they grow weaker, trembled, causing the bells attached to him to ring and the padlock attached to his nipples to swing back and forth tugging on his clamps.

�Well,� I said, �Good night, I&#8217;m going to bed, I&#8217;ll see you in the morning.� With that, I left the room, hearing his muffled screams and the gentle ringing of the bells.










�� � � � � � �I rub my legs between the sheets as I wake up, feeling the soft cotton run across my skin.� So soft.� Ahhh�.� I open my eyes slowly, blinking as the sun pours through the window, basking the entire room in its glow, and getting in my eyes.� I clamber out of bed with my arm over my eyes and head to the old wardrobe, with its dark, heavy wood, clawed lion&#8217;s feet, faux-Greco carvings across the whole thing.� It&#8217;s a huge wooden monstrosity, but years of familiarity have made it oddly comforting, besides, its an �heirloom� which means that 150 years ago one of my ancestors had it made, and no one&#8217;s wanted to throw it out since.� I open its doors and pull out my bathrobe.� My mother had it made for me and it is amazing soft, made out of god knows what materials, probably silk and cotton, and fashioned in the style of the Scottish tartan of my mother&#8217;s clan.� It doesn&#8217;t really matter that my mother&#8217;s Scottish forbears came to America nearly 300 years ago, dirt poor, and on the run from the British for rebelling� again.� What matters is that there are Standards to be Maintained, and Maintaining Standards means not forgetting Where We Come From.� Quite frankly, I don&#8217;t bother disagreeing with her when she pronounces capital letters, because that is impressive and frightening, and not worth battling.� Besides, she isn&#8217;t here right now, nor is my father, which is why I am wandering through this old house wearing only my bathrobe and slippers and walking up to the (former) servants&#8217; quarters, where last light night I left a certain adorable asian twink in a rather interesting predicament. 
� 
I walk into the room and gasp at the sight, my bathrobe tenting up as I stand behind Liam, seeing his hands uselessly clenching, his feet balling, his exhausted legs twitching as he struggled to lift himself up off the cock shoved in his ass and to give his poor, throbbing cock a break from the constant shock running through it.� He lifts up an inch, only for his fatigued legs to give out, and, with a gentle ringing of the bells affixed to his collar and nipple clamps, he collapses once again, the cock plunging into his ass.� A new spring of tears form in his eyes, the droplets run down the already salty paths across his face, and another quiet muffled scream parts from his mouth. 
� 
I pull the cord electrical cord and watch as he stiffens in surprise and relief.� Apparently, he didn&#8217;t hear me come in.� His hands relax and color returns to his knuckles as the constant, torturing shock has ceased to run through his cock.� I sit on the edge of the stool behind him and press my body to his, wrapping my arms around his trembling torso and feeling him shudder at the touch.� �Just sit still,� I whisper, �this will hurt a little.�� And with that, I gently unclip his nipple clamps, letting them fall to the floor with a thud and a slight ringing.� He twitches in pain as the blood returns to his nipples and screams into the gag again, although all I can hear is a muffled and sexy moan.� My rock hard cock presses against his back, and I gently rub his nipples, bringing back feeling into his abused chest, and in contentment and his exhaustion, he leans back against me, sobbing in ragged breaths of pain and relief.� His cock is still hard, and throbs insistently with every heartbeat.� For hours it has been teased and tortured with no relief, and I gently wrap my hand around it, stroking it softly and slowly. 

�Do you still want to cum?� I whisper into his ear, his eyes closed and his jaw slack, in exhaustion, in pleasure, I don&#8217;t know.� He gives a small, insistent nod, and I slowly move my hand giving one, two, three more strokes before taking my hand away. 
� 
He rolls his head over to my face and gives me a look with his half-lidded eyes, the dark circles under them belying his absolute exhaustion, as if to say, �You can&#8217;t be serious, just stop teasing me.�� I smile back, and pull myself off the stool.� Working quickly, I unlock his ankles and the chain holding his wrists to the stool.� He continues to sit there, his head bowed forward, too tired to push himself up.� I lift him up and slowly ease him off the cock that had been buried in him for the last ten hours.� His body is covered in dry sweat and tears, and his legs tremble beneath him, unable to carry his weight.� He leans against me.� I unbuckle his gag and toss it aside.� I&#8217;ll clean this stuff up later. 
� 
I pick up his exhausted body in my arms and carry him into the bathroom down the hall.� I lay him in the bathtub, his smooth copper toned body on the smooth white porcelain. Too tired to resist me, I unchain his wrists and his collar before tossing them aside and turning on the water.� As the hot water slowly fills the tub, he falls asleep, his head resting on the edge of the tub, gently snoring as the light pouring through the clear water forms webs of gold across his skin.� I take the bar of soap in hand and gently work my hands over his body, exploring every crevice and every smooth length of skin he has, lathering and rinsing, washing away his exhaustion and sweat, leaving behind clean, sweet smelling skin as the tub slowly drains. 
� 
He wakes up as I stand him up, but dozes against my shoulder as I towel him off.� I pick him up and carry him into his room, I think of it as his room now, and lay him down in the bed, tucking the blankets around him and watching him drift off into never never land. 
� 
It&#8217;s several hours later when he stumbles into the kitchen with a blanket wrapped around him. I&#8217;m sitting in the adjacent breakfast room, reading the news on my laptop while staring at the window at the birds on the feeder.� A male cardinal is pecking at the seeds, his red feathers glowing in the sun.� I turn to Liam. 
�Did you sleep well?� 
He stares at me, �You raped me last night.�� It is not a question or an accusation, just a simple confirmation of fact. 
I nodded, �You enjoyed it.� I added. 
He nodded thoughtfully,� �How much of it was a dream? � I mean� I can&#8217;t find any of the things I remember.� 
I nodded.� An awful lot of nodding going on this morning� afternoon, I correct myself, looking at the clock.� �After you fell asleep, I cleaned everything up and locked it in the trunk.�� He stood there thinking for a couple seconds. 
� 
�You hungry?� I ask.� He smiles, �Pancakes are good.� 
� 
I take the hint, and fifteen minutes later we sit across the table from each other with a mountain of steaming strawberry pancakes between us, maple syrup (the good stuff from Vermont, not the synthetic crap everyone uses these days) running in amber streams on top with a small fluff of whipped cream on top, the aerosol can it came in beside the plate. 
� 
Liam lets the blanket drop from his shoulders as he shovels the steaming flapjacks dripping with gold onto his plate.� The blanket reclines across the chair and wraps around his legs, leaving his torso bare and his delicious skin open for my eyes to feast upon.� I stab a couple pancakes with my fork and place them carefully on my plate before switching the fork to my left hand to pin them down and carefully carve morsels with the knife in my right hand. Across the table, Liam was nearly bends over the table, shoveling the pancakes into his mouth, devouring them like an exhausted, starving boy who hasn&#8217;t eaten for at least a day.� The towering mountain is gone in minutes, and we both lean back in our chairs, sated and relaxed. 
� 
Liam stretches his arms above his head, his skin a dull copper in the glow of the light bulb (Compact Fluorescent, gotta be eco-friendly).� He had wiped the syrup from his mouth, but a dab of whipped cream still sticks to the front of his nose.� I chuckle at the sight. 
� 
�What are you laughing about?� he asks quizzically, leaning forward again.� I lean forward and wipe the cream away, then lick it slowly, sensually off my finger. He smiles, and I can&#8217;t help but notice the blanket around his waist has tented. 
�Got something for me?� I tease. He blushes, and turns his head aside.� I stand up from the table, grabbing the whipped cream as I do, and walk over to his chair.� He grabs the front of my bathrobe, though whether to hold me back or bring me closer, I don&#8217;t know.� I suspect he is unsure as well. I wrap my arms around him, and kiss him, burying my tongue in his mouth. 
� 
His other hand grabs my bathrobe and I half-drag, half-carry him from his chair, his blanket falling away, and through the breakfast room, dining room, across the main hallway, and into the living room before sitting down on an ottoman.� He leans against me, his body draped over mind, our lips still locked together.� I pull our mouths apart.� He opens his mouth to protest, and I fill it with whipped cream, before setting down the can I had carried with me from the breakfast room.� As he closes his mouth to swallow, I tear the bathrobe belt from my waist and throw it over his neck, it&#8217;s two ends falling evenly down his chest like an untied tie.� �Shh�� I whisper as I get off the ottoman and pin him chest down onto it below me. I pull my bathrobe belt underneath his arms and tie the ends together behind his back, straddling his waist with my naked thighs.� I grab his arms and pull them behind his back, cinching them tightly to the bathrobe belt, leaving his arms pinned behind him. 
� 
I toss him back onto his back, shaking the whipped can as I do, straddling him with my unfastened bathrobe flowing open, our hard cocks pressed together. He grinds against me lightly and I moan beneath my breath.� Damn, he makes me hot.� I squirt the whipped cream onto his nipples, already hard in the cool air of the room, making tiny dollops stand on top them. 
� 
I lean over him, my hands buried in the ottoman on either side, supporting my weight as my body hovers over him like a bird of prey about to devour a defenseless meal.� I lick the cream from his nipples, tasting its sweet sugar and sucking them gently.� He moans and twists against his bonds, inadvertently grinding his cock against mine again, and the sweet tingle of sex warms my body.� I slide my body down his torso, caressing his soft copper skin beneath my fingers, feeling his heart beat faster against his rib cage, and his panting breath. As my mouth creeps closer and closer to his raging hard on, I twist onto the ottoman, my legs on either side of his torso, my hard member throbbing above his lips.� My own mouth hovers over his cock, and the soft bathrobe flows over both of us, hiding the lewd sight from the rows of disappointing eyes painted on the portraits around the room, every face vaguely resembling my own, twisted with the serious frowns of people bored at the amount of time it takes to paint their likeness on canvas to last for centuries and stare down on their progeny congregating formally in this room, and, in this case, having hot, sweaty sex with an asian boy.� Fuck you, ancestors. 
� 
The soft tartan bathrobe flutters around us as our bodies move together. I lick his hard cock, tasting it, feeling it pulse in my mouth as my tongue swirls around it.� I cup his balls in my hand and ran my other hand around the base of his shaft as I push his cock as far back in my mouth as I could.� I slide it slowly out and then plunge it in again, hearing him moan and holding his pelvis down as he thrusts into my face. My own cock throbs insistently and I push it against his lips.� He opens, obediently, and my cock slides in.� We thrust against each other, each tasting each other&#8217;s cocks, feeling the other move inside us.� His mouth is skillful, he teases me and brings me to the edge, but no matter how I thrust against him, I cannot get the stimulation to push me over the brink.� His body tenses beneath me, and I swallow his cock, tasting his cream as he shoots it into my mouth, his body shuddering as he does.� I swallow it all, and stand up, pulling my cock out of his mouth.� Standing over him, I stroke my cock hard, and come, my cream shooting over his face and chest. 
� 
I kneel down, and kiss him gently on his forehead. 
�Had fun?� I ask. 
�Lots. Now can you untie me please?� 
�Awww, but you look so cute all trussed up on your back like that�� 
�Yes, but my arms are falling asleep.� 
Liam sits up, and tugs at the belt holding his wrists to the middle of his back. 
I sit behind him and chuckle as I untie the knot.� He rubs my cum off his face as I wrap my arms around him and kiss him gently on the shoulder. 
�We need to do the dishes.� I whisper to him. 
�Or more specifically, you need to do the dishes. I cooked.� I tie my bathrobe up again and walk into the kitchen, not bothering to see him get up and follow me.� Sitting at the table, I open my laptop again as he enters the room, his beautiful body completely naked.� I toss him an apron. 
�Put it on and get to work.� 
�Yes, master� he smiles, and I chuckle when he turns to wiggle his ass at me teasingly as he gathers the dishes. 
It&#8217;s been a good day. 









"Yes, yes, of course, I understand, mother." �She keeps blathering on, annoying old shrew.
I pull into the driveway and brake suddenly, skidding across the gravel.
"Well, I hope you enjoy your trip, mother, it sounds like it will be fun." I unbuckle my seat belt and climb out of the car, slamming the door behind me.
"Now, now, father isn't all bad, mother, I'm sure he means well." �I hold the phone a couple feet from my head as I go to the back of the car and open the trunk, pulling out the bag of clothes. �I carry the bags to the front door as my mother's shouting rant continues, blasting tinnily over the speaker of the phone.
I open the door and cut her off with a "Right, right. I'll be in the townhouse. �Love you, goodbye" before terminating the phone call. �If only every time she bothered me with her mundane problems I could silence her so easily.

"Liam? Liam!" �the front hall is empty, and a cursory glance shows the living room and dining room to also be vacated. �I run up the circular stairs, "LIAM!" I shout as I sprint. �I charge through the door of my room and stop dead. �In front of me, my widescreen tv is on, and an invisible Master Chief is running across the screen, smashing into the side of a moving warthog with�a gravity hammer before sticking it with a grenade. �The warthog tumbles along the ground before the grenade explodes, killing both occupants. "DOUBLE KILL" flashes across the corner of the screen.
"Well done," I say softly, swallowing at the sight in front of me.
Liam turns to smile at me. �He is lying on his stomach on my king size four poster bed, his arms stretched in front of him, holding the controller, his chest propped up on a pillow so he can see the screen without cricking his neck. �My soft, white sheets are tangled around his naked body, leaving his back and ass bare to the caress of my eyes.
My cock presses tightly against my pants. �I want to take him here so badly, to lie alongside him, my naked body pressed tightly against him. �I want to feel his body tense against mine, feel him shudder as I plunge into him, hear him moan as I take him again and again.
"Can I help you with that?" Those soft brown eyes glance towards my pants.
He looks at me with those wide puppy eyes, and runs his tongue softly over his lips. �I shudder with lust, and softly shake my head.�
"H..." I choke, "Here." I toss him the bags.
"Get dressed, we'll be leaving soon."
I grab my backpack and turn to the door.
"Going!" he shouts, "Going where?"
"To my home."
"Isn't this your home?"
"This is my country house, we're going back to the city."
"I thought you said that your parents were there...?"
"They had a fight. Both of my parents stormed out. �My father went on a business trip. �My mother went on a vacation with friends."

I head down the stairs and go around the house, checking the doors and window, securing the locks and turning off the lights. �

As I open the front door, Liam comes stumbling down the stairs, pulling the shirt over his head while juggling the bags of clothes in his hands.

I chuckle at the sight as I hop into the car and open the passenger's door for him. �"It's going to be a long drive," I say as he jumps in, "maybe a couple hours, get some rest while I drive."

He nods and yawns as he lowers his seat down. �He must have been playing xbox for the past 7 hours straight. �Figures.

I pull out of the drive and accelerate down the empty road as Liam drifts off beside me. �I sigh, blowing out the air through my lips. �I didn't want to have to return so early. �I can't be idle forever.

--------------

The afternoon sun poured through the window, leaving a square of light on the carpeted floor. �Two young boys lay on a bed together, holding their naked bodies together, cradling each other gently with their arms. They faced each other, mouths inches apart, breathing together, sharing the air between them, letting it flow, it's tendrils wrapping around them and tying them to each other, tighter with each breath, time slowing and eventually standing still, the moment of pure peace between them extending and becoming endless, crystalizing and becoming tangible. �It was a moment that could be touched and felt and never lost or ruined.

And then it shattered in an instant. �The door exploded inwards, there was the shouting, the screaming, the crying, a boy running, grabbing his clothes from the floor. �"In MY house!" "Sinful! Disgusting!" "Never! Never see him again!" The shouts echoed through the halls as Liam ran, the tears running down his cheeks as he stumbled through the door.

The tires of the bike skidded as he pulled up to his house. �Maybe, just maybe if he was lucky it would be... No, the shouting, the slurred words muttered from the weakened mouth of a drunken man made it clear he was too late. �Liam entered the darkened house, the setting sun making his shadow nightmarishly long. �His mother weeping in the corner, hiding her face beneath her arms, his drunken brute of a father slapping her, beating her. �His father turned, and Liam stood still, not out of courage, but out of paralyzing fear.

His father slowly regarded him through bloodshot, bleary eyes, and begin stalking forward. �Somewhere in the shouting, the accusations, the confessions, the recriminations, Liam found himself stumbling outside into the night with the rain pouring down, the water dripping down his face over salty tracks. �No home, no food, and nowhere to go.

---------------


I park the car, and turn to Liam. �His sleep seems deep and peaceful. �Good. �Earlier, he was whimpering, but I didn't dare disturb his dreams. �I step out of the car, and turned my head upwards. �Four stories of brick and stone filled the sky before me, the old house unshakable, firm, solid. �It stood like a fortress atop the hill, hidden from the bright city below behind oak trees that had stood for over 150 years. As I carry the bags up the stone steps of the terraced garden, the sweet sent of flowers surrounds me. �Roses, tulips, snapdragons, and many whose names I do not grow in ordered rows, lined in soil held back by rough hewn stones walls, tall and thick, black with age. �Invincible, timeless.
Everything in its place, every plant arranged for the pleasure of their gardener.
Wild chaos tamed through strict discipline.
Beauty in order.

I return to the car to pick up my own asian flower, and carry him gently into the house. He sleepily opens his eyes as I set him down on one of the leather couches in the den. �I sit beside him, and slip my hand underneath his shirt. �The tips of my fingers faintly brush over his skin, and he shivers as I feel myself warm inside. �Is it not pleasurable to see such a strong response provoked by the lightest touches?

My other hand slips under his shirt as well, and I run both of them along his sides, feeling the soft contours of his body. �His head lolls back, his eyes closed and his tongue flitting softly out of his mouth, caressing his lips as I bury my own mouth into his neck, kissing him, tasting him.

I pull the shirt off over his head and toss it aside. �I lay back on the couch, and he climbs onto my supine body, his beautiful chest hovering above my face. �He hips swayed slowly, sensually, as he grinds his cock against mine through our pants, as I suck softly on his nipples, taking first from one, then the other.

"ah! ohhhhhhhh..."
His body shudders, the incoherent moans pouring from his trembling lips, ephemeral rivulets of pure sex, their intangible tendrils twisting and wrapping around us, pulling us together.

He collapses onto my chest, burying his head in my shoulder, panting, as he lifts his smooth, sweet butt into the air, tugging at his jeans. �I slide my hands along his sides, feeling his shuddering body beneath my fingers. �My hand drifts lower, caressing his inner thigh through jeans as our mouths meet, my tongue slipping inside his mouth, his teeth tugging on my tongue. �I fumble with the button on the front of his jeans, before pulling the waistband of his jeans down to his knees. �Liam scrambles off me and slips the rest of his pants off, tossing them in the corner.


Seeing him standing there, clad only in his briefs, his smooth copper skin, his black spiky hair, those cute pouting lips beneath those tilted, seductive eyes, woke within me a raging fire of lust. �I jumped from the couch driven by a burning energy I didn't know I had. �He paused, unsure of what to do, and the initiative was mine. �Three blurred steps later, I had his wrists pinned above his head against the soft cushion of the arm chair, our breaths coming in short, shallow drafts, as my mouth found his neck. �I kissed him, drinking in his smoky skin. My lips and tongue ran down his body, leaving their marks, marking him as mine. One kiss after another, down his chest, his stomach, drifting dangerously low as he mewled in pleasure.

My teeth gripped his waistband and pulled, letting his stiff member spring free as let my arms drift down, fingers barely brushing his skin. �His body shivered, in anticipation, in pleasure, in the sheer intensity of physical stimulation. He was mine, mine and mine alone, and I rejoiced in the knowledge. �His body that responded so quickly to my touches was mine, mine to use, mine to hold, mine to love and treasure. �


I pulled the briefs off his feet, and fumbled with my own pants, pulling out my aching cock as he lay panting on the sofa, propped up against the arm rest, his legs spread wide, his member pulsing, his body begging me to take him.

From beneath the couch, I grab a bottle of lube. As I lift it up, Liam stirs. �"Let me take that..." he purrs, his brown eyes flashing seductively as he clambers across the couch, placing his hand softly on mine. �I acquiesce, and he squirts some of the bottles contents into his hands, and rubs his palms together, making the already soft hands slick and slippery. �

His hands close gently over my cock, moving slowly, too slowly as they slowly slide up and down, lubricating my thick, pulsing cock. �I gasp in pleasure, and grab him by his sides, pulling him onto my body, his tight ass hovering above my thundering, demanding hammer. �He nods, and lowers himself slowly, his tight hole giving way to my blunt head. �Inch by inch, he lowers drops, slowly taking all eight inches within him, his head thrown back in pleasure, his gaping mouth screaming in silent ecstasy, his closed eyes, and his hand running through his hair. �Everything about him giving off the static of pure sex. �I am caught in the blaze, and forged from it, and I pound into him as he rides my cock, my eyes flashing, my clothes sticking to my sweaty body, invisible strings of lighting setting the world afire. �I am Thor, and he shall feel the full power of my Mj�llnir. �My body tenses, and I cum, filling him with my essence, and I lean back with him on top of me. �He is still not sated, and I feel his hard-on poking my shirt. Good.

Let him know who owns him, I will not let him cum tonight. �My cock remains inside his ass as I pull him into a kiss. �Our tongues meeting, wrapping around each other, as I slowly drift off to sleep, his body my only blanket.









The stillness of the house was disturbed by the soft swishing of my robe as my custom slipper padded footsteps echoed quietly through the long and silent halls. �Sunlight filtered softly through the thin cotton curtains, filling each room with wispy shadows as I passed through them. �I stood still and inhaled sharply, breathing in the silence. �With no parents, my house seemed almost peaceful. So much I could do without interference. �I could organize and catalogue my books, I could finally clear some of those extra basements rooms of the mountains of crap that had accumulated over the years, I could drag cute boys, whimpering and begging for mercy home without at any risk of being caught... �Ah, there was a thought.

*DONG* 
The ancient grandfather clock began its hourly chime. 
*DONG* 
Why did they have to make its bell ring one time for each... 
*DONG* 
...hour of the day? If somebody really cared about... 
*DONG* 
... the time, they could just walk into the same room as the... 
*DONG* 
... damn clock and take a glance. And to think I had been... 
*DONG* 
... enjoying the silence, too. �Can't a man rest in his own... 
*DONG* 
... house and fantasize in peace, without a goddamn bell... 
*DONG* 

... shattering the peaceful quiet every goddamn hour?

*DONG* 
The question was, where had my cute little boy toy disappeared, too? ... Hmmm, no more ringing. �Well, at least I know it's 9 o'clock in the morning. �I could use some early morning fun. 
A cursory glance revealed that my wing of the upstairs was empty, and I hadn't woken up with him in bed with me. �It's unlikely that he's ventured into any of the other upstairs wings. 
Wandering through the formal dining room, the parlor, the library, and the kitchen all turn up empty. �A quick turn from the kitchen into what my mom euphemistically referred to as "the family room" also revealed nothing, except...� I walk over to the large windows and glance out. 10 feet below me, in the 12 person hot tub on the stone patio, wreathed in steam, floated the object of my desire. �I kicked off my slippers and slipped out the back door, tiptoeing over to the hot tub. 

He looks so peaceful, floating there on his back with his eyes closed. His copper body mostly submerged slightly below the water, the steam rising up around him catching the sun's rays, causing a small rainbow to form and fade briefly above him as I drink in the sight. �I dip my toe in the water. �Good and hot, a 100, maybe 101 or 102 degrees. �He doesn't notice me hovering above him as I slowly undo my robe and toss it aside. �Standing naked there in the open air, with perspiration and steam just beginning to condense on my soft white skin, the muscles of my chest, stomach, shoulders, and biceps in clear relief. �I'm not a beefcake by any means, but between years of sports and my attention to working out, I'm not anything to sneeze at either. �Damn, I look good right now. �And he's not looking at me.

I tiptoe across the control panel with a grace that only years of doing this same activity perfects. �I lower my foot and tap a single button with my big toe. 
Six massive jets in the wall behind Liam let loose a torrent of water, knocking him over and pulling him under into the steaming, heated depths of the hot tub. I sit down on the edge of the tub, chuckling as my feet dangle in the water and Liam pulls himself up onto the side, gasping for breath. 
"Not... cool..." he manages to gasp out as he glares at me, his dark black hair plastered over his head. 

"I should hope not. We paid good money on a high quality hot tub, it'd be a disappointment if the water was cool."

"You know what I mean. I was relaxing. What gives?"

"Pfff... some slave you are, playing my video games, eating my food, using my hot tub..." 
"The kind that gives you hot, smexy asian fucking... besides, whoever said I was your slave?" 
He leers at me with a cheeky grin. �I slip into the hot tub, and wade towards him, doing my best to put on a grim and serious face. Apparently, � I succeed, for his grin fades and his eyes slowly widen with fear. 
"You're my slave, because I own you, Liam. �I feed you, I clothe you, I pamper you. �But I also rape you, I use you, I abuse you as befits my desire." I grab his black hair with both my hands and shove him under the water, holding him down as bubbles come floating, some from the jets, most from him. �He thrashed beneath me, but as I felt him weakening, I dragged him back up. �He coughed up water and gasped for air. I continued: "This is not a fair exchange. As Rousseau said, a man cannot exchange liberty for slavery, for to do so is to give up everything for nothing. Instead, I am taking what I want. �Look around you, everything here exists solely for my pleasure, and you are just another thing I own. Are we clear?" 
He nods, desperately, fearfully. I turn him around and shove him against the side of the hot tub, pinning him with my body. �My cock grows hard as I feel his smooth back and perfect rounded ass pressed against my chest and loins, the hot water swirling around us both. My fingertips trail down his back until my hand cups his ass. 
"I don't think you do understand." I tell him as I slip three fingers into his hole, loosened from our previous adventures. "You're too loose. Do you know why this is a problem?" 
"N-no, sir. I don't" 
"Clench for me, as tight as you can." �I feel him tighten around my fingers. Still loose enough for me to twist my fingers. He squirms as I do. Too loose. 
"I want this hole tighter. I want it tighter because I want you to feel every inch of me when I plow you. If you're too loose, the experience isn't the same. �I own you, I control, I will make it tighter." 
He looked back over his shoulder at me, his expression part fear, part confusion. It was so delicious, I leaned in and kissed him gently on the lips. 
"Don't worry" I gently whispered into him, "It will be very painful." 
With that, I slipped my fingers out of his hole, climbed out of the hot tub, and started walking across the yard to the shed, feeling the cool breeze brush the hot water and steam off of me. �I looked back once to give a quick jerk of my head, indicating for him to follow me. He got the hint and clambered out of the hot tub, jogging after me. 

The shed was a small building, only about 8 ft by 10 ft, with a wooden floor. �Inside, the walls were lined with shelves covered in old gardening equipment, sets for yard games like badminton and croquet, and old sporting equipment from golf, tennis, even some riding crops from my brief horseback riding period. I hated riding horses. No matter how hard I beat them, they never ran as fast or as hard or as long as I wanted. �I fingered the riding crop briefly, remembering, before grabbing a four ft pipe and a length of rope.

"Stand in the middle, face the door, spread your legs, hands behind your head." 
He obeyed my curt orders immediately, and I knelt by his feet, tying a noose around his left ankle. �I looked up briefly and noticed he was getting a semi. �Good. �If my use of him excited him, it made him easier to control. �I fed the rope through the pipe, and tapped his thigh, encouraging him to spread farther. �I took the end of the rope pulled through the pipe and tied it around his ankle, making the pipe an improvised spreader bar. 
Grabbing another length of clothesline rope off the shelf, I pulled his left arm behind his back and wrapped the rope around his wrist three times, then repeated the action with his right wrist before finishing it off with a tight knot, leaving a long strand of rope hanging from his bound wrists.

I seized the length of rope and threw it over one of the shed's 2x4 wooden rafters, pulling it taut.� Liam hissed through his teeth as his arms were pulled up behind him, forcing him to bend over.� Droplets of steamy water from the hot tub continued to trickle down his skin, now mixing with his sweat.� It was late spring, and the midday sun was beginning to heat the shed. I tied off the rope, keeping him bent at the waist, and leaned to down to gently kiss him.� As I did, I ran my fingers gently across his cheek, then traced them down his smooth copper chest, only to sharply tweak his nipple. He gasped in surprise, and to my delight, I saw his cock start to harden.

"Horny little bitch, aren't you? Enjoying this with my hardly doing anything."
"Yes, master" he whispered, and I reveled in his submission.
"Well, get comfortable" I said as I walked past him and sharply slapped his ass. "You'll be here for awhile."

Walking over to the shelves, I grabbed one of the boxes with my name clearly marked on it.� A bit OCD when it comes to organization? Perhaps.� But order, pure and clear form, is aesthetically pleasing to me.� Shaping the world to my command brings me the greatest joy. Just as I intended to shape my slave to my desires.

The box contained an estim power box, and a small estim butt plug.� It had been a devil to get when I was 14, but I got it, and I spent many happy hours silently screaming into my pillow in the dead of night before I grew bored of it.

Not even bothering to lube it, I shove the small butt plug into my slave's waiting hole. He grunted a bit, more out of surprise than pain I think. I grabbed another coil of clothesline rope, and looped it around his waist, tied a quick knot in the center of his back, then put another knot it in right where it would pull against his asshole, before pulling it through his crack.

"Ouch" he muttered as the plug was pushed deeper insider him.
"Quiet, bitch." I said, driving my point home with a quick spank.

I tied the two ends of the rope off where the rope looped around his stomach, and then paused to admire my handiwork.

Here was my beautiful slave, his dusky skin shining wet, bent over at the waist with his legs spread, his arms tied behind his back and pulled painfully up, a plug up his loose hole held in by tight rope.

I knelt down and ran my hands up his smooth legs, tickling the inside of his leg as I did, before moving my hands up to weigh his hanging balls.� A drop of precum formed at the head of his hard cock, pointing about 45 degrees down, and I stared, fascinated, as the precum dropped.� I don't precum, and its existence still amazes me. Standing up behind him, I leaned over him, my hard cock pushing up against his from behind.� I wrapped my arms around his torso and ran my hands up and down his chest and abs, paying special attention to his nipples as I did.

"What do you think I should do with these?" I asked as I tweaked his nipples, feeling him shudder.
"Maybe I should get them pierced.� What do you think about two little black rings through these nips of yours? Or maybe silver would suit you better?"
"S-silver, master, I would prefer. But I-I hear it hurts."
"Probably.� I've never gotten anything pierced.� I have too much respect for my body to do anything like that to it.� You, however, are a different story. But first things first, let's tighten you up."
"Sir?"
"Don't you remember why we're here? Silly bitch. Don't worry, you'll remember soon enough."

With that, I pulled my body away and attached the electrodes to the estim box before plugging it in.� Briefly, I considered warning him before flipping the switch, but where's the fun in that?

His body stiffened against his bonds as the current ran into his ass, his hole clenching, tightly involuntarily against the plug as hard as it could. He screamed, probably more in surprise and fear than in actual pain.� I flipped it back off, and he gasped for air, hanging limply from the ropes. Then I flipped the switch again. He didn't scream this time, just hissing through his teeth instead.

Flipping the switch off again, I set the timer for an on/off rotation.� Two minutes on, half a minute off, repeat.� I stood and watched as the box tortured him without my help for a little, seeming his body squirm and contort, then relax, then begin again.� Satisfied at first, I quickly became bored. I turned back to my racks of random junk, and spotted one of my old riding crops.� I picked up, wrapping my hand around the handle, fingering the end of it.� I hadn't been riding in years, thankfully.� The day that old cow of a horse stomped on my foot, I winced at first, but quickly drowned my pain in anger.� I had gently finished washing the horse, groomed her, saddled her, adjusting the blanket, the saddle, the tack ever so carefully as I did. I gently mounted her, and began the ride slowly, only to bring her up to a trot, then a canter, then a gallop. And I kept galloping.� Urging her on, first gently with my heels, then harder with my crop, forcing her to keep going after the foam poured from her mouth, urging her to run harder, faster.� I was trying to hurt her; I was trying to kill her.� And I did.� I remember her still, collapsed body in the dirt, miles from the barn, the blood flecked foam around her nostrils and mouth, flowing over the bit. Her coat matted with sweat and dust.

My father had been furious. Not at the loss of the horse, but at my loss of self-control. Restraint. It was a lesson he beat into me. Order and restraint.� I never rode again.

I gave the crop an experimental swing with the flip of my wrist, rejoicing as the crop swished through the air, before turning to stare at my quivering slave.

Having been behind Liam, he had not seen me drift off into my daydream, nor had he noticed the crop in my hand. But even if I stood in front of him, I doubt he would have noticed, he was too lost in his own world.� His legs were trembling now even when the current wasn't on, the wide stance was difficult to maintain.� I gently placed the end of the crop on his soft left buttock, and chuckled as he tensed, then traced it over his back and around his shoulder, before coming back the other way and dragging it across his chest and stomach.� I pulled it down the outside of his leg, and then finally up inside his thigh, tickling him with it.� His hard cock throbbed as I did, and I gently lifted his balls with the crop before letting them swing free again.

Throughout the entire process, he had remained fearfully tense, expecting me to snap back and whip him at any moment, and he remained tense for a few seconds after I brought the crop away, before letting down his guard and relaxing again.� His mistake. Noticing his slack body, I flicked my wrist, whipping his ass with the crop.� He jumped as much as he could, held down by the ropes.� A small red square print began to form on his ass from the crop.

I walked around him to his front, and stared at his body, once again shuddering from the current clenching his hole tight, his head staring straight down, grimacing, but his cock still throbbing.� Whether it was the pain, the fear, or the estim that was turning him on, I couldn't be sure, but it pleased me.� My quaking little slave boy was pure sex and my cock throbbed painfully at the sight.� I placed the crop beneath his chin and lifted his head with it, so that he could stare up at me standing above him, his large brown eyes wide.� My own eyes, jagged blue and green with flecks of yellow flashed with lightning as I smiled down at him.� I slapped his cheek with my hard, thick cock before thrusting the blunt tip right to the edge of his lips.� His little pink tongue flashed and teased the under side of my cock's head, and I groaned with pleasure and leaned forward, pushing the tip of my cock into his mouth. He swirled his tongue around the head of my cock and teased my piss slit before sucking me in deeper.� The boy is a natural cocksucker, and I loved to see his lips spread around my girth as I filled his mouth. 

I ran my left hand through his dark hair as I fucked his face, feeling his body tremble and tense with the shocks, his gasping for breath when I pulled back, and his shudder as I plunged back in while whipping his ass with my crop. His soft, velvet tongue teased my cock and the back of his throat massaged my head.� I fucked his face and whipped his ass until it glowed bright red, occasionally pulling my cock out of his mouth to slap his face with it before shoving it back in.� Finally, when I felt myself close, I pulled out and stroked my cock, coming on his face in long, white spurts, coating him with my cream.� He was shuddering again from the shocks in his ass when I ran my fingers through his dark hair.� I walked past him to place the crop back on the shelf, slapping his ass as I did.

"OWWW!" he screamed, but I noticed his cock leaping beneath him as well.� The boy got off on pain, interesting to note.

As I headed to the door, I heard Liam call after me: "Wait! Master! What about me?"
"Don't worry, I'll fetch you in a bit. Just relax and enjoy yourself." Chuckling, I� locked the shed behind me and headed back to the house. 









After leaving Liam in the shed, I headed up to my room and pulled on some shorts. I walked back down to the basement and looked around.&nbsp; Boxes stacked taller than I was were piled everywhere. A dozen years ago, these rooms hadn&#8217;t been like this.&nbsp; I vaguely remembered how they were before Grandfather died.&nbsp; Mother and Father didn&#8217;t fight then, and Father would often come to the library down here.&nbsp; He would walk slowly, hardly limping despite my clinging to his pants leg and riding on his shoe. His hand would brush over the leather bound books, massive tomes on chemical engineering, thermodynamics, metallurgy, caressing them until he found the right one. Then he would pull it out and the bookshelf, as if by magic, would swing open slowly, revealing the study behind.

He would sit there happily for a few hours every day, reading and sketching diagrams on graphing paper, humming old songs under his breath.&nbsp; Then Grandfather died, and Father spent less and less time in the study.&nbsp; The books grew dusty and boxes began building up.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t think I had seen the bookshelf swing open since I was 10.

But I had not forgotten that room, and it wasn&#8217;t that hard to get to. Just a lot of clutter in the way.
One by one I picked up the boxes and carried them out the basement door before setting them down on the driveway.&nbsp; Stacks of old magazines, ancient first editions of old books, the occasional antique chair or portrait, I piled them high outside. The sweat began running down my naked torso, causing the dust caked on everything to stick to my body.

After setting yet another box down, I bent over and coughed, catching my breath.&nbsp; I heard a car pull into the driveway and looked up.

Geoffrey got out of the car and bounded up cheerfully to me.
�Hiya Jack! Thanks for letting me know you were back in town.�
�I didn&#8217;t.� I said as I turned back to go inside. �I didn&#8217;t tell anyone, how did you know?�
He followed me into the basement. �I got home yesterday to find my mom leaving for a sudden vacation. Which means that your mother had a fight again with your father, and that she needed girl support.&nbsp; Which means your parents weren&#8217;t at home. Which...�
�... means I was.� I hadn&#8217;t thought about that. Damn, I should have known I couldn&#8217;t come back unnoticed.
�So, anyways, I&#8217;m here to invite you to Eric&#8217;s party.�
�I know about that already, I have facebook�
�I would have never known from how often you use it.�
�Right, make yourself useful and carry this box.�

We carried another two boxes outside.
�You&#8217;re coming, right?� Geoffrey pressed on.
�Wasn&#8217;t planning on it.�
�You never go to parties! You have to go to this one.�
�I went to the party last week.&nbsp; And no I don&#8217;t.�
�Jack, last week&#8217;s party was your birthday. And yes you do. It&#8217;s the summer meeting.�

I stopped and set the box down, turning to face Geoffrey. I needed to make sure I heard that correctly.

�Eric is holding the Summer Meeting of the Evocati Cabal at his house during a party?�
�Yes, and that&#8217;s why you need to be there.�
�That&#8217;s retarded�
�You&#8217;re an officer! You need to be there!�
�No, I mean holding an important meeting for a secret society during one of Eric&#8217;s parties.&nbsp; Have you seen his parties? How long is the guest list for this&nbsp; one? Roughly 200? Give or take?�
�More give than take. It&#8217;ll actually be around 350.&nbsp; But Eric made a very reasonable argument. No one will notice a dozen people missing during a party that big.�
�Eric&#8217;s the host. Everyone will notice him missing.�

Geoffrey paused and stared at me.&nbsp; It took me a second to realize the obvious mistake I had made.

�Of course. Everyone will assume he&#8217;s just fucking some girl in a side room, like he does at every party. Fine, I&#8217;ll be there.�
�No guests for you as usual?�
I glanced towards the shed.
�Actually... there may be one.�
Geoffrey raised his eyebrows at me, but didn&#8217;t press the issue.&nbsp; He helped me move a few more boxes before driving off.&nbsp; Over the next six hours or so, I managed to clear out the entire basement, refurbish the hidden bookcase rooms how I wanted to, and even make my self a sandwich for lunch.&nbsp; I can be remarkably productive when I put my mind to it, I thought as I hit the shower.


I stepped out of the shower and toweled myself off before glancing out the window.&nbsp; The late spring sun was low in the sky, but still a couple hours off from setting. I slipped on some fresh clothes, just a pair of long athletic shorts, a t-shirt, and some flip-flops.&nbsp; No sense in wearing boxers this late in the day. After walking down a few flights of stairs, I pad my way through the basement, admiring my handiwork.&nbsp; Just seven or eight hours ago, these halls and rooms were filled with old boxes, books, and piles of crap that had accumulated over the past dozen years. Walking out the door into the fresh air, I passed the giant pile I had made on the driveway.&nbsp; In a few days, the garbage men would come by and clear it away, and another worthless impediment inadvertently set up by parents would be removed forever.

Heading across the yard, I approached the shed.&nbsp; In the late afternoon, set discreetly behind the trees, it looked peaceful, another ordered part of the garden.&nbsp; I smiled at the thought as I undid the lock and pulled the doors, feasting my eyes on the site before me.

The shed was hot.&nbsp; A full day under the blazing sun with no ventilation will heat up any small structure, and the shed was probably pushing 80 or 90 degrees. I would have hated being stuck in here all day.&nbsp; Thankfully, I didn&#8217;t have to. Nor would I ever have to.&nbsp; My pretty little slave, Liam, on the other hand...&nbsp; Liam looked up at me as I entered the shed.&nbsp; He squinted his eyes, having not yet adjusted to the sunlight streaming in behind me.&nbsp; From his point of view, I must have been near invisible, just a dark shadow set against the blazing sun.

�M-master...� he begged, �Please...�&nbsp; He didn&#8217;t need to say anything else.&nbsp; I was the one who eight or nine hours before had spread his legs wide and tied hist ankles to the pipe, forcing him to stand with legs spread.&nbsp; I had tied his wrists together behind his back, and then tied the rope over one of the the ceiling beams, forcing him to painfully keep his arms up in the air and to stand bent at the waist.&nbsp; I had shoved the butt plug up his ass, tied it there, set it on repeating shock to clench his asshole tight, and then beat his ass with a riding crop as I fucked his mouth before blasting my load over his pretty face.&nbsp; And then I had left him in there, in the hot shed, the estim plug still in his ass, his red beaten ass pointing in the air, sweating away.

He wasn&#8217;t dehydrated at this point, but he must have been very thirsty and completely exhausted.

�Shhh, shhh� I whispered comfortingly to him as I squatted down and cupped his cheek in my hand.&nbsp; �It&#8217;s alright, it&#8217;s over. You did well.�&nbsp; I kissed him gently on the lips before standing up and unplugging the estim.

I gently ran my hands over his bruised and sore ass. He moaned as I did, and I slowly untied the ropes that kept the butt plug shoved inside him.&nbsp; I pulled the plug out with gentle plop, and his tight hole closed up immediately.

�Hmmmm, how tight would you say you are, Liam?�
�I... I don&#8217;t know, master.� 

I placed the blunt tip of my pinky finger on his hole and pushed it in. His hole gripped tightly around.
�Clench.� I ordered.

He did, and I could barely turn the finger around inside him. Perfect. I pulled out and continued to untie him.&nbsp; I undid the ropes tied to the rafter that pulled against his arms. He slowly stood up, and leaned his back heavily against me.&nbsp; His legs were shaking from his ordeal.&nbsp; I untied rope that bound his wrists, freeing his hands. He held onto me for support as I kneeled and undid the ropes around his ankles, before tossing the rope and pipe off to the side.

Liam clung to me as I stood up, throwing his arms around my shoulders and burying his face in my chest.&nbsp; We stood there for a few moments until his legs stopped shaking. I ran my hands down his back and felt him wince and hiss as they ran over his bruised ass.

Knitting my fingers beneath his thighs, I hoisted him up. He wrapped his legs around my waist and buried his head into my shoulder as I walked back to the house.

Heading through the now cleaned and polished basement, I walked through the library, past the old tomes still on their shelves, now freshly dusted.&nbsp; There before us, the bookshelf stood open, as I had left it, and I carried Liam inside.

The old study room was almost completely bare.&nbsp; Not much had been left after my father had taken away his desk, books, and drawings years ago.&nbsp; Turning to the left, I entered the side room. The old single bed had been left there, and it wasn&#8217;t hard to find an old but clean bedspread for it.&nbsp; I gently lay Liam down on the bed, and he squirmed as his sore ass hit the covers before rolling over on to his front.&nbsp; I let him lay there for a few minutes as I busied myself around the rooms.

The room Liam was resting in was his new bedroom, and contained solely his bed. The room itself was tiny, about 8ft by 6ft.&nbsp; I had seen closets that were bigger than it.&nbsp; Attached to it was a small bathroom. Sink, shower, toilet.&nbsp; The only door to the bathroom led to the bedroom, and the only other door in the bedroom led into the small former study.&nbsp; The door from the study to the bedroom locked, from the outside.&nbsp; The only piece of furniture in the study was an old bureau I had found in the basement and moved in.&nbsp; In it, I had placed all of Liam&#8217;s clothes and most of my toys and bondage implements.&nbsp; The system I had set up was simple.&nbsp; Liam, on nights when he didn&#8217;t sleep with me, would be confined to his bedroom.&nbsp; When he was not in the bedroom, he was under my control.&nbsp; I could decide what clothes he could wear, what he would do, what he would eat, when he would sleep.&nbsp; Complete and total control through order and restraint.&nbsp; What had once been my father&#8217;s study suite was now to be my dungeon and Liam&#8217;s prison.

I opened and closed the drawers one by one, checking again to make sure each one had its proper contents organized correctly.&nbsp; I felt a pair of arms wrap around me, and I looked over my shoulder to find Liam behind me, still butt naked, holding onto me, his face buried in the back of my shirt.&nbsp; He breathed in deeply and smiled. �You smell nice� he muttered. 
�Oh?�
�Mm-hmm�
�Aren&#8217;t you tired?�
�Yesh... very sleepy, but still horny.� I could feel his growing cock pushing against me.&nbsp; The little bastard had been teased all day but I hadn&#8217;t let him get off. Of course he would be horny.

I turned around in his arms and kissed him. I pushed my tongue past his lips and into his mouth. He slipped his hands beneath my shirt and ran them over my chest and stomach. I stripped off my shirt and let it hit the floor.&nbsp; Standing there only wearing athletic shorts and flip flops with naked asian boy pressed up against me, I felt my cock harden and push against him. He giggled and grinded his naked loins on my erection. I pushed him backwards as we kissed, through his bedroom and into his bathroom, kicking off my flip flops as I did.&nbsp; I shoved him into the shower and turned on the water. He yelped as the initially cold water hit him, and I chuckled as I slipped out of my shorts, my hard cock springing free.&nbsp; The water warmed and I followed him into the shower, pushing up against the wall, pinning his arms above his head as I kissed him again.

I grabbed the bottle of shampoo and squeezed out a dollop before rubbing it into his hair. Leaving him to rinse it out, I grabbed the bar of soap and lathered up his body, letting my hands explore every inch of his smooth, dusky skin. I ran them over his pert nipples and smooth stomach before stroking his hard cock with my soapy hands.&nbsp; He groaned, leaned his head back, rinsing the shampoo from his hair as his tongue darted out of his half closed lips, the water splashing on his face before beading and running down his body in streams of light mixed with the white foam of shampoo and soap lather.

I turned him around and lathered his back, tickling his underarms as I did.&nbsp; He planted his hands on the shower wall and invitingly stuck his ass out as I soaped it, cupping his perfectly formed cheeks in my hands.&nbsp; There didn&#8217;t seem to be too much bruising from the earlier day&#8217;s ministrations, and what there was would fade in the next day or so. Perfect.&nbsp; I wanted to take him right there, fuck his tight hole hard with my massive throbbing cock. Feel his wet, slippery body buck against mine as I plunge into him again and again, the water pouring down around us.&nbsp; He would moan and beg for me to fuck him harder as I would grunt and wrap my arms around him, grabbing his shoulders, clutching him tightly, pounding him into the wall.

�You&#8217;ve been soaping my ass for the past five minutes� his voice breaks my day dream. I look up to see him staring down at me with those wide brown eyes, smiling. His smiles are so cute and heartwarming. I smile back and stand up, turning his body into the shower spray.

I pulled his body against mine, my cock pressing against the small of his back.&nbsp; I absentmindedly thumbed his nipples while my right hand started slowly pumping his cock.

�You&#8217;ve been a good little slave, Liam.�
�Thank you, master�&nbsp; His voice was steady, but beneath it, I heard a building moan of pleasure.
�I think I&#8217;ll keep you around. Would you like that?�
�Y-yes master� he stuttered this time, and his eyes were closed as my hand worked his cock, bringing him closer to the edge.
�Even if at times it means pain and submission?�
�oh god, yes, master...�&nbsp; I could hear him getting closer.
�Do you want to come, slave?�
�Oh please, let me come, master, let me come...�&nbsp; His head was lolled back on my shoulder at this point, and he was thrusting wildly into my hand, trying desperately to get off.&nbsp; I loosened my grip and slowed my movements, extending his time on the edge.
�Oh? And what will you do for me if I let you?�
�I-I don&#8217;t know, master. Anything!�
�Anything strikes me as a pretty good deal...� I mused as I pumped him harder, feeling his body quiver against mine.
�I&#8217;m coming!� he gasped as his body spasmed, and a long, thick stream of cum arched out of his cock, splashing against the wall. And then another stream, followed by another, each one slightly less than the one before it.&nbsp; He collapsed against me and I held up him as the water poured down around us.

After a few minutes, I turned off the water and grabbed a towel, drying us both off with it.&nbsp; He was sleepy, though I still felt wide awake.&nbsp; I carried him into his bedroom and lay him down on the bed before heading over to the bureau.&nbsp; By the time I got back with his clothes, he was fast asleep.&nbsp; I set them down beside him and let him nap as I gathered up my own clothes and left.









The tires hum along the asphalt as we speed along the road, the engine pounding and thundering, filling my ears with the sweet music that only a mustang can play. �My hands on the wheel feel the horses bucking, trying to break free, wild stallions who feel the empty night road before them and want to fill it with their might and speed. �I drop into gear 5 and let them run free, watching the speedometer spin upwards 80... 90... 100. �Glancing up into the sky as I drive, I notice that the stars which were so clear only a few days ago in the country were so much dimmer as I race west along the interstate into the city. �The gleaming glass and steel towers of downtown stand above the road, silent sentinels, watching the red mustang below flash past. �Over the bridge and through the tunnel, and I'm shooting out of the city again, headed south this time.

Liam stirs in the passengers seat and blinks the sleep from his eyes. 
"Where are we?" he asks groggily. 
"we are heading south to a friend's house," I reply, "he's holding a party, of sorts." 
"A sexy party?" Liam teases. 
"Our dialogue is truly scintillating, we've all the depth of a poorly made porno. �So yes, a sexy party. �There'll be some nice people there, you'll enjoy it." 
We saw the cars at the same time as we saw the house. Stretching almost half a mile from the front door, car after car was parked along the absurdly long driveway. We arrived at the house, parking in the circular drive behind two yellow mustangs. �My friends like mustangs. �They're good cars. �There were other cars as well, maybe a half dozen parked between us and the house.� House was the wrong word. �The edifice of columns of marble and vast expansive wings before us set on a golf course was not a house. �It was a mansion. �Entering through the double mahogany doors, we walked into the vast two story front hall. �I chuckled, remembering the time another friend of mine had asked upon entering, "what kind of house needs a lobby?" �The answer? �The kind of house that has a massive circular staircase descending from the lobby into a basement with a dance floor, bar, and pool table, with the usually tastefully arranged couches and tables pushed to the side. � 
Despite the blaring techno music (which I despise), the flashing lights (which I abhor), and the crowd of people(whom I... actually, looking around, I like this group of people, they're a good bunch), the host finds us immediately. 
"Hey-ay! Wassup?" he shouts at us, a drink in his hand and wearing sunglasses despite it being 11 at night. 
"Cut the crap, Eric. It's good to see you." �I said, our hands meeting in an unnecessarily complex handshake. 
"I'm glad you're here, Jack. �Who'd you bring with you?" 
"This is Liam, cute little guy, isn't he?" 
At this Eric laughs uproariously. �He would have laughed no matter what I said. �He breathed and sweated charisma and good feelings. �Just being in the vicinity of Eric gives people the need to party. �Well, most people. I hate parties. 
"See you guys on the dance floor, nice meeting you, Liam," Eric shouts as he heads off to another group of people. �Lost in my internal commentary, i had not noticed Eric and Liam talking. �I look down at Liam, and he gives me a mischevious grin. �"C'mon, it'll be fun," he says as he tugs me into the crowd.

The writhing mass of sweaty, grinding people pressed against me as Liam pulled me into their midst.� The strobe lights flashed in time with the loud techno music, turning the world into a slowed down series of freeze frames with everyone jumping from one moment to the next. Time's usual flow seemed interrupted, slowed down somehow, despite the frenetic pace of the music and the dancing.� I had always found dancing confusing.� I was never entirely sure of what I was supposed to do, or how to stay in time with the music.� Tonight, it didn't matter.� Pressed tightly into the crowd, with Liam grinding close to me, I had no choice but to move in time with the music as green lasers flashed overhead. I admit, despite my dislike for conformity, and crowds, and dancing in general, I began to enjoy myself.� The key to dancing is to make a complete fool of yourself, and just not care.� That's always been the problem for me, my tendency to over think and analyze even the most mundane things crippled me in social situations.� Like Geoffrey said, I rarely attend parties, and when I do, I usually try to sneak out. Hell, my first time with Kevin was because I was avoiding a party.

It was one of those annoying formal affairs. My father was hosting some sort of important gathering at the club near our country estate.� It's a beautiful old rambling building, set atop a hill, surrounded by trees.� I was wearing a coat and tie, my light blue Hermes tie, come to think of it.� Milling around the crowd of people who averaged 20 years older than me, sipping their Old Fashioneds and Grand Cru Burgundy and champagne, and I was drinking sprite. My father had caught me earlier in the evening with a mimosa and had dumped it in a nearby plant. "A 15 year old boy has no need to be drinking."

I caught a glimpse of him through the crowd.� He had just walked through the door.� Dark hair, dark flashing eyes.� 6'2" and from what I could tell, he looked well muscled.� He looked to be my age, maybe a little older, and was dashing in his black coat and black pants with a neatly pressed white cotton shirt and a fashionable slim black tie.� I politely excused myself from whatever pointless conversation I was muddled in with Mrs. what's-her-name-who's-husband-had-some-sort-of-business-or-political-relationship-with-my-father, and made my way across the room.� I slipped my left hand into my pocket, and found my good luck totem, giving it a quick squeeze to give me confidence.

"Hello Stranger" I greeted him.
He smiled at me and I pressed my luck.
"Come with me and we'll have a real party."

Cheesy, wasn't it? But at the time, it was the only thing I could think of, and I'll be damned if shy away from a situation just because I have no idea what I'm doing.� We left through the french doors and made our way across the stone porch.� We sneaked into the trees just out of the light, and once we passed the tree line, I pressed him against a tree.� I gently kissed him on the lips as I undid the knot of his tie, and he closed his eyes and kissed me back. It was my first kiss with a boy, and I felt my heart thundering in chest as the little voice inside me screamed "what the hell do you think your doing?"� I crushed that voice, curbstomped the little man inside me.� That's what my father referred to it as, "the little man inside each of us, who tells us that we aren't strong enough, who tells us we're too tired, who tells us we can't carryon .� Jack, whenever you hear that little man, I want you to beat him down. You're better than him, you're stronger than him. Be strong, be tough."� So, I pushed my tongue past his lips an unbuttoned his collar.� I pulled my lips from his mouth and kissed his neck as I continued unbuttoning his shirt, one button at a time, exposing his smooth, muscular chest to the night air.

I untucked his shirt from his pants and let his shirt and coat flutter around his body, his chest and hard stomach fully exposed.� I ran my hands along his sides as my trail of kisses crept lower.� My mouth reached his nipple, hard and smooth in the cold night, like a small brown pebble.� I kissed it, and then sucked it gently, licking it as I brought it into my mouth. He grabbed hold of the tree behind him for support and gasped with pleasure as I gently nibbled it, before letting go and turning to his other nipple, swirling my tongue around it as I moved my hands down his body.� I felt the crotch of his pants, felt his hard cock pressing against the fabric, and I rubbed it gently with my hand, feeling him squirm beneath my touch.

My mouth left his nipple, and I kissed his chest, then started kissing down his stomach.� My hand fumbled with his belt buckle and the button of his trousers, before finally getting his pants to fall to his ankles.� His hard cock tented his boxers as my mouth approached, kissing below his navel now.� I grabbed the waist band of his boxers with my teeth and pulled them down, letting his hard cock spring free.
"Your clothes are still on. Not fair..." he muttered.

I kissed the head of his cock and looked up at him.� "Well, I haven't exactly had the chance to take my clothes off yet, have I?"
I kissed the head of his cock again and the licked the underside of the tip lightly. His entire body shivered. I slipped my lips over his cock and sucked it into my mouth, swirling my tongue around it as I pulled off.� As I sucked his cock, I quickly undid my tie and threw it and my coat off and on to the ground beside me.� I unbuttoned my shirt with one hand as the other cupped his ass, feeling his finely toned and taught muscles, pulling his cock deeper into my mouth.

I pulled my mouth off his cock, leaving a thin trail of saliva clinging to it as I did, and I pulled off his shoes, tossing them aside. Then I slipped his pants and boxers off his ankles, before rising to my feet and kissing him once more on the lips.� I wrapped my left arm around his torso and pulled him in close to me. My right hand slipped under his left thigh and lifted his leg, exposing his tight hole as he wrapped his arms around me for support.� Our chests were pressed against each other, skin on skin, our hearts beating so loud I could feel his heart beat against my chest. I'm sure he felt the same. His hard cock, slippery with my saliva, was pressed between our stomachs, and it rubbed between the two of us as I ground him into the tree.� I slipped my left hand to my pants, slipping the belt and button undone and pulling my pants and boxers down to mid-thigh length.� My hard cock pressed insistingly against him, pushing right behind his balls, looking for his hole.� I slipped my hand into my pocket and pulled out a condom.� I had found it earlier that week, in it's wrapper, still not expired, and had carried it around with me as a good luck totem. Would I have had the confidence to approach him if I didn't have it? Probably not, but then again, maybe. Would I have gone as far as I did without it? Definitely not.

He broke off his kiss and whispered into my ear, "Can I be top?"� I paused.� I wanted to shout no, shove him against the tree and leave. This wasn't part of the plan, I had hunted him down, I had dragged him to the trees, I was going to fuck him.� But... he was hot, and god, I was horny.� I had played with my ass before, and loved the sensation.� Maybe I should bottom for my first time.� Surprised, I nodded, and dropped his leg down so I could tear the wrapper open with both hands.� I slipped the condom over his hard on, and turned us around so my back was against the tree. I slipped off my pants and shoes and then� I wrapped my arms around his shoulder and he cupped my ass in his hands. He lifted me up, pinning me against the tree, and I wrapped my legs tightly around his waist.� I found myself supported by the tree and his strong muscular torso.� My back hurt from being pressed against the tree and I whimpered as his hands spread my cheeks apart. A whimper that turned into a moan as the blunt tip of his hard cock pushed against my hole.� I shuddered as he pressed me against the tree, forcing the head of his cock through my hole.� My hands scratched his back and he kissed me, pressing his lips against mine to comfort me as he pushed his cock deeper inside me.� I hung limply in his arms, my face flushed and cock twitching as he plowed me.

He plunged into me again and again, thrusting his tongue between my lips, feeling and hearing me moan as he fuck me harder.� A few more hard pushes, and he paused, catching his breath. I took advantage of the pause to regain control and pushed him to the ground, straddling his waist, riding him.� Lying on top of him, with our faces only a few inches apart, I rode him hard as I felt the smooth planes of his chest beneath my palms, thumbing his nipples and trailing my fingers along his pecs. I sit up to take off my shirt and throw it aside, leaving me completely naked, impaled on his cock before I lift myself up and drop down again.� He sat up as I rode him, licking my torso from navel to chest as I bounced up and down on his hard cock. I shuddered as I felt his tongue on my skin, and he humped his hips, thrusting into me from below, matching my motions with his body.� I looked intently, deeply into his eyes, pushing him back to the ground and cuffing both his wrists pass his head with my hands, riding him harder and faster. I felt his cock deep inside me, stretching my tight hole, rubbing against my prostate, and every time it tweaked that spot, I trembled.

I leaned down with my hands pinning his wrists down to the ground, my forehead pressed against his shoulder, humping myself against his cock over and over again, feeling it twitch inside me.� I paused with him still fully inside me and whispered in his ear "Fuck me on my back."� We rolled over, my legs thrown over his shoulders, my back against the mossy ground.� He shrugged off his coat and shirt, which had somehow managed to cling to him throughout the night.� He leaned over me, thrusting deep inside me, and pinned my wrists to the ground. I looked up at his muscular torso, dappled by the moon shadows of the trees, the sweat glistening on his forehead, his eyes half-lidded and his jaw slack in pleasure as he thrust into me.

I pulled my left hand from his grip and spat into it, before forming a loose ring around my cock and jacking off in time with his thrusts.� My body trembled and all my muscles tensed. A long, thick strand of cum flew from my cock and splashed onto my face, followed by another, then another, until it finally dribbled out and pooled on my stomach. I lay there sated, my hole clenching around his cock as I came, and his body tensed. With a loud moan he plunged deep inside me and erupted, before collapsing on top of me, his cock still buried deep inside me. Our two naked bodies lay atop one another on the mossy ground between the trees and I reached up and grabbed the back of his head, pulling him in for a long deep kiss.

Eventually, when the cum drunk stupor of sex wore off, he pulled out of me, and I winced as he did. We gathered our clothes and redressed, properly introducing ourselves to each other for the first time.� He was Kevin, and he lived on the West Coast. The reason he was here in the Northeast was our fathers were working out some absurdly complex and most likely underhanded deal that needed to be concluded in person.� As a result, his father was invited to the party, and he tagged along. He was 16 then, a year older than me.� He had dated a boy back at home, secretly, without his father's knowledge, but that had been the extent of his experience.� I refrained from sharing with him my own previous virginity.� Once we were again properly attired, we snuck back into the party, which at this point was winding down.� At the end, we went our separate ways.� I don't know how the deal between his father and mine worked out, but I have not seen him since.

I snapped my attention back to the party currently at hand. I had no idea how long we had been dancing for, or what song was playing.� Techno has always sounded the same to me.� I dragged myself out of the crowd and away from Liam to make to the bar.� An old school chum of mine was behind the bar, and I shouted my drink at him.
"A Flaming Dr. Pepper? Great choice! I'll whip one up."
"Goddamnit Owen, no.� Just a Dr. Pepper. Why doesn't anyone here besides me like soda?"
"It's a party, Jack. Loosen up."
"Just give me a Dr. Pepper."
"alright, alright. Good to see your still alive."
"same to you, Owen.� Give your mother my regards. I miss crashing her bed."
"Fuck you, Jack" he chuckled, and I flipped him the bird, laughing to myself as I did, as I left the bar.� It was good to see old friend every now and then.

I caught sight of Geoffrey across the room, and he flicked his head, giving me the sign.� Working my way from the party, I reascended the staircase and headed down the maze of halls to Eric's father office.� The summer meeting of the Evocati Cabal was about to begin.
