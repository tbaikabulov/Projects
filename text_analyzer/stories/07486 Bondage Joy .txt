Bondage Joy

By Janet Baker



He held me down -- I struggled against him, I tried to kick but he avoided my flailing legs.&nbsp; He held my wrists above my head -- it hurt -- he held me so tightly.



�You�re hurting me!&nbsp; Not so tight!�



�Relax!&nbsp; I�m not going to hurt you, I am your husband! Just take it easy.&nbsp; If you struggle you may be hurt.�



He shifted himself, held my wrists with one hand, slid himself between my legs so I couldn�t hurt him and snapped a cuff onto one wrist then the other, slipping the chain around a headboard post. 



Satisfied that I was secured, he sat up between my legs and played with my breasts and pinched my nipples.&nbsp; I squealed and pleaded with him to stop.



�Jay! Why are you doing this? I don�t like it�



�Relax, I�m not finished and I�m not going to hurt you -- I told you so.�



He had prepared for this -- whatever -- by tying ropes around the bed rails and used them to pull my legs apart.&nbsp; I couldn�t move -- only squirm a little, he had me so well restrained.



�Why Jay? Why? Why are you doing this to me?�



�I�ll tell you why Rosalie.&nbsp; We have not had sex for almost five years.&nbsp; You have been evading, avoiding, putting me off for five fucking years and I am fucking fed up.&nbsp; I want answers!&nbsp; You are a healthy, fit pretty woman of only fifty-five years and there is no reason why we should not have sex together.&nbsp; 

I don�t want to rape you -- but -- I want to know why&nbsp; you�ve emasculated me -- why we have no sex any more and haven�t had it for five goddamn years.&nbsp; I am just as fit and trim as I was five - ten - fifteen years ago when we were having a good sex life.&nbsp; My erections are solid.&nbsp; You have no excuse that I can see for not making love with me.&nbsp; Have I been unfaithful?&nbsp; No! And you know it!&nbsp; Have you been unfaithful?&nbsp; Is that why you avoid me?&nbsp; Avoid my approaches?&nbsp; You won�t even let me caress you!&nbsp; Do you want a divorce?&nbsp; Is that the problem?�



�Chill out Jay, I love you, dammit, always have, always will.&nbsp; I can�t explain&nbsp; it but I just don�t have the urge, the desire to make love with you -- or anyone.&nbsp; I just� don�t� feel� like it.&nbsp; I just don�t develop the urges I had a decade or so ago.&nbsp; I used to get hot just thinking about you, but now� I just don�t� care� about sex.&nbsp; Maybe it�s age.&nbsp; Maybe it�s because I just went through menopause.&nbsp; I don�t know.&nbsp; But I do know that I love you.&nbsp; Isn�t that enough?&nbsp; Isn�t it enough that we have had twenty five years of happy marriage?�



�I understand what you are saying, not that I understand what is happening to us -- to you.� I don�t think I have changed physically at all�. well, I have started to crossdress�� but my erections are still as good as ever.�

�Right!� You have not changed physically.� I have!� I just went through menopause.� Maybe that�s the problem!� Also Jay, I really don�t get any pleasure from your swishing around the house.� How you can wear heels higher than mine puzzles me and those D-cup boobies you sport are not flattering.�

�OK Jan, before this problem escalates to a separation, let�s go visit your OBGYN, have an exam, have a discussion, learn what we can, see if there is a solution, and not forget that there may really be a condition of some sort that we�re not aware of.� Anyway Rosie, you know that our sex problem predates my crossdressing.�

�Yes! Let�s! Let me loose please Jay.�



�First however Rosalie -- since as you can see, I have a really nice appealing erection, I am going to have a little bit of sex.&nbsp; I�ll be gentle.&nbsp; I�m going to lube your vagina and my penis and I�m going to very gently insert it into your vagina.&nbsp; I will be gentle but we will screw.&nbsp; Five, perhaps six years ago I stretched you out on the bed just as you are now and screwed you and you loved every second of it.�



�Jay! Please! Don�t! I really don�t want you to��



Then Janet he took some jell of some sort, coated his fingers and inserted them in my vagina.&nbsp; The lube let them slide in without any real resistance.&nbsp; I could feel them as he moved them around in me.&nbsp; He scrunched down toward my crotch and tickled my clitoris with his tongue, keeping his fingers in my pussy, constantly moving them, thrusting them gently in and out.&nbsp; He licked my labia, my clitoris, the sensation starting to grow as the old feelings returned.&nbsp; I resisted but the sexual sensations were revived and I felt young again -- I felt the urge again -- as I thrust my groin towards his fingers.&nbsp; He moved away from my pussy, kissed my breasts then suckled my nipples one by one, keeping his fingers in my vagina, the sensations kept coming.&nbsp; He pulled out his fingers while kissing me. I couldn�t see, my eyes were closed during the kiss -- I felt him moving around, doing something while holding my head with his kiss,&nbsp; our tongues mingling erotically.&nbsp; 



�I have a vibrator in my hand Rosalie, I don�t want you to be surprised.&nbsp; I�m lubricating it&nbsp; Rosie and I�ll thrust it into your vagina now, Rosie.&nbsp; I&nbsp; love you darling.�



I closed my eyes -- I couldn�t see much anyway.&nbsp; He kissed me again and I could feel the vibrator enter my vagina.&nbsp; It was thick and long -- it kept coming until it bottomed in me.&nbsp; He turned on the vibrating and rotating functions.&nbsp; The tongue buzzed against my clitoris and the rod squirmed in me and I cried out and thrust against the intruder as it pleasured me.&nbsp; 



�Oh!&nbsp; Jay! My God Jay, what have I� we been missing?&nbsp; My God Jay, these sensations are incredible! What a screwing!&nbsp; More Jay! Please!&nbsp; Pull it out Jay!&nbsp; Get on top of me and screw me Jay, really screw me!&nbsp; Make me your wife again!�



Hours later we showered together.&nbsp; 



He said, �Rosie, I hope you�ll forgive me for restraining you but I love you so��



�I think so Jay, I think so�. I do forgive you darling.&nbsp; I didn�t expect ever to feel that way again. I didn�t want you to do it but it was so good.&nbsp; Jay!&nbsp; I will talk with my OBGYN and I want you to be there with me.&nbsp; I want to be a wife again.&nbsp; I want to repeat that�� I laughed. �I want to be a wife a� again but I want to understand the problem.&nbsp; I don�t want to be hurt� I don�t want to do anything that might injure me.&nbsp; Do you understand?&nbsp; Do you agree?�



He agreed and we saw the doctor the following week.&nbsp; The doctor examined me, pronounced me normal -- for a fifty-five year old woman -- and explained that the body provides less to no internal natural lubrication as one ages. The doctor also told me that for desire a woman needs trace amounts of testosterone her body may not be producing.&nbsp; This can be resolved medically.

So long as we used lubrication, the KY jelly was satisfactory, we should be able to enjoy sex to the fullest being sure to stop before the vagina became sore through excessive friction. 

�Doctor�, my husband asked, with tongue in cheek I�m sure, �May she also do anal and oral?�



The doctor inhaled sharply, replied, �Wellll� yessss but remember!&nbsp; Lube! lubricate generously -- the anus, that is.�



We returned home and my husband hugged me as we entered the house, suggesting that we make love later that evening.&nbsp; I was still reluctant.&nbsp; I felt that I should have an urge, desire to make love not just go ahead and do it for the sake of doing it.



That evening we bandied words, chatted about nothing -- we both felt the tension,&nbsp; waiting for the other to make the first move.&nbsp; I didn�t want to initiate sex, I really didn�t have an urge but the conversation tended toward sex and our recent experience.&nbsp; He asked me if there was anything I found particularly offensive.&nbsp; 



�Darling, was there anything we did that really upset you the other night?�



�Well, forcing me was an unpleasant surprise but I recovered from the shock and enjoyed the rest of the night.&nbsp; It reminded me of our limited attempts at bondage when we experimented ages ago.�



�It was fun, wasn�t it?&nbsp; It was at least a dozen years ago and I used your stockings to tie you to the bed.&nbsp; I recall how you squirmed and thrust your groin upward to meet me.&nbsp; You clearly loved that game.&nbsp; The sex was great!�



�Oh yes, it was�, I replied, eyes closed, remembering� �Is that why you bought handcuffs?�



�Yes, I needed something I could apply quickly and securely.&nbsp; I couldn�t expect you to allow me to slowly tie your wrists with stockings or ropes so I settled on real handcuffs.&nbsp; They are very erotic aren�t they?�

�I liked them, but only because I had confidence in you.&nbsp; I knew that what you were doing was not proper -- forcing me -- but I knew you would not hurt me.&nbsp; You told me you would not hurt me and I believed you.�

�Would you like more of the same Sweetie?�



�I think so� probably� I still don�t feel the desire� the compelling urges that one feels in one�s genital area� that I felt years ago.�



�But may I try to bring you a point of desire� may I use that little toy again?�



�What did you call that thing?�



�It�s called a rabbit and as you recall it can be very exciting, sexually.�



�Oh yes, I do remember�, I replied shivering and squeezing&nbsp; my&nbsp; legs together.



�Let�s go to bed Rosie, I�ll cuff you and tie you down and entertain you with the rabbit and then when you�re ready we�ll do it� again.�



�No Jay, cuff me here, put me on the floor and I�ll do something else you like�, she said with a wicked grin. �And Jay, get something to tie my ankles, I don�t want to be able to get up without your help.�



So Janet, he got a tie and tied my ankles together and I got really hot.&nbsp; I sucked on his penis, he got really hard, picked me up, draped me over the sofa back and entered me from behind.&nbsp; No, not my anus, my vagina.&nbsp; Oh Janet, the anus came later.&nbsp; It hurt a little but he was gentle.&nbsp; What really got me going was when he put the little rabbit in my vagina, held it there while he entered my anus.&nbsp; That was so damned exciting! I writhed and writhed and got so exhausted I couldn�t move, and then last night and this morning he did it to me again.&nbsp; God, I could hardly get out of bed after he left the house to go to work.&nbsp; But I finally did, Janet.&nbsp; I had to come over here and tell you.&nbsp; Our last five years together with just that dildo of yours have been marvelous, but I want you to get a rabbit too so you can do that to me too, and your brother Steve should expect to use it too whenever he comes over -- I�m not sure I�ll prefer his prick to my husband�s any more, not without that rabbit somewhere inside me.



And you know what else, Janet? I want to use it on him, too.&nbsp; I�d like him to feel what I�ve been feeling.&nbsp; The only problem is, how can you use both a rabbit and a dildo on a man?&nbsp; And how can I trick him into letting me tie him up the way he tied me?&nbsp; Do you think you could call Steve over and let me practice on him?&nbsp; I want it to be flawless when I do it to Jay, no mistakes!



That should punish him for ignoring me for five years, ever since I took up with you and your boy friend, and then your brother, and found you and they were so much better than Jay I lost all interest in him.
