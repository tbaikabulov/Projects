Chapter 1 -
The Meeting

Patricia

The restaurant's low mood music
played quietly, floating at the edge of Patricia's consciousness. She anxiously
rubbed her fingertips on the linen tablecloth and picked up her glass. She took
a sip of water. The condensate on the glass dampened her fingertips. She dabbed
them restlessly on her unused napkin. Perhaps she had made an error, maybe there was still time to back out. Patricia
checked her watch to ensure there was no chance of running into her blind date
as she exited the restaurant. No good, it was too late, he could walk in at any
second and he had seen her picture on her web page so there would be little
hope of his not recognizing her. 

Patricia berated herself for
letting her loneliness propel her into this meeting. She checked her watch once
more and looked towards the entrance. She couldn't believe she was doing this
as the end result of responding to an Internet personals site. The ad had been
intriguing, offering to find the perfect man for her for free. She had signed
up, figuring she had nothing to lose. She looked apprehensively toward the door
as she brushed her short black hair back from her
face. She had no clue as to what the man looked like except for what he had
told her on the phone. He had said he would be dressed in black. Great, here
she was waiting for a would-be Johnny Cash.

&nbsp;

Patricia was divorced from her
childhood sweetheart and the marriage and divorce had both been painful. She
had loved Glen but could no longer bear his drug abuse and the increasing
violence that accompanied his burgeoning habit.�
She hadn't dated for a year after the split but loneliness and a fellow
she met over a cup of coffee at Barnie's had put an end to her moratorium on
men. However, her past year of dating had soured her on meeting the right man
by chance. She kept comparing them to Glen in his better days and they all fell
short.� She needed to do something, so
here she was, meeting a man she had been paired with
by someone she did not know.

Patricia had sent the Internet site
the best photo she had of herself for them to use. They had created a web page
for her, using her photo along with her text submission. Funny thing about that
page, she could not change the photo or move it from its prominent placement at
the head of the page. Plus, there was an e-mail link to someplace called BBO
and the graphic was of a cute little shop labeled &quot;Pet Store&quot;. She
had clicked on the link and got an HTTP Error 403 - Forbidden Access notice.
She figured the link must have been invalid because her web page host had
inserted it there and surely she would have had access if it were a working
link.

While apprehensively waiting for
her blind date, she recalled the intense questionnaire that had accompanied the
application for the service. It was very in depth with its detailed queries.
She had dutifully filled it out entirely, even the part about sexual likes and
dislikes, after noting that the service would not be rendered without the form
fully completed.� 

Patricia had blushed and been
tempted not to answer the sexually related questions but had justified doing so
by reasoning that her expected match should be a totally compatible match. She
related her disenchantment with sex but had honestly stated she had enjoyed it
once, a long time ago. Before she could change her mind she had clicked the
&quot;Send&quot; button. Afterwards she had felt so shamed and guilty she had
wanted to forget the whole thing but by then it was too late.

Patricia had received a few e-mails
due to the site but something about them made her uncomfortable. The writers
seemed preoccupied with her measurements and her availability for travel. But
one fellow was local and his e-mails had seemed nice. He seemed interested in
her and not her measurements. She had corresponded with him for a couple of
weeks before accepting this date, the first one that had resulted from her web
page. 

Patricia wondered about the kind of
guy who would be interested in a woman like herself. She was reasonably
attractive but approaching her middle 30's. Her black hair was cut short for
convenience. Some small lines on her face were the result of too much sun in
her youth and she had gained weight lately. She was heavier than the picture
she had used for the web page though it wasn't too noticeable when she was
clothed. 

Still, Patricia knew she was good
looking, she had been told so all of her life. Her divorce had been rough and
she was lonely. She liked being part of a couple and she missed it terribly. It
was so hard to be responsible for everything. She lived from payday to payday,
hoping she wouldn't get sick because she couldn't afford insurance.� Not that being poor was so bad but it would
certainly be easier with a partner. 

Patricia looked around at the
restaurant decor and clientele. Her date had arranged to meet her here and the
establishment was way out of her price range. She had been afraid to look at a
menu and had declined when the tuxedoed waiter had approached, offering to
fetch her a drink from the bar. Shamefaced she had
asked for water instead. Feeling very out of place she tried to keep her hopes
up for this date but she was dubious. The man was obviously pretty well off if
this was his choice for a meeting. Or maybe he just wanted to impress her? She
sighed nervously at the very idea and resigned herself to the hope that he
would turn out to be decent and she would have a pleasant evening. That would
be a wonderful.

As Patricia watched the restaurant
foyer a balding man about her height came in. The man wore an odd black leather
vest over a black shirt and black leather trousers and boots. The vest was
split cowhide and almost knee length. In spite of his peculiar apparel, and the
looks it drew, he seemed unconcerned, even haughty, his aura of self-confidence
apparent, as he stood perusing the room. He looked her way and made eye contact
with her. She smiled tentatively and he nodded and directed the ma�tre d' to
lead him to her table. She carefully stopped herself from obviously showing her
dismay with his appearance and the fact that his brown hair was almost
nonexistent on top. 

&quot;Not my type at all,&quot; she
thought unhappily as he came closer. Though she did not consider herself a
prize she still had a preference for obviously good-looking men. She took in
his dark blue eyes and rugged face, liking them but still being put off by his
thinning hair and odd manner of dress. She knew that it was shallow of her to
be that way and she tried to find things about him that piqued her interest. He
was in great physical shape as far as she could tell and she couldn't stop
herself from being attracted to that. Ruefully, she felt inferior due to her
recent weight gain and vowed to tone up. 

He approached the table and smiled
down at her in a confident friendly way. She smiled back at him in answer while
reminding herself that it was only for dinner and did not have to go any
farther and probably wouldn't.

He continued to coolly look down at
her for a moment, obviously evaluating her appearance, and nodded approvingly.
He then introduced himself as Gray Winton. As Patricia introduced herself, she
felt mildly irritated by his blatant appraisal but also found she was flattered
by his apparent endorsement. 

Gray seated himself and asked if
she had been attended to yet. She replied she hadn't and he waved the waiter
over and asked for menus. He looked at her frankly as she perused the menu,
making her nervous because every time she looked up to steal a glance at him he
was looking at her. Her nervousness made her shy and she focused on the menu.

&quot;Do you see anything you
like?&quot; he asked solicitously.

&quot; Well,
I've never eaten here and I am not sure what's good, &quot; she answered. 

&quot;I'll order for you then and,
by the way, I see something I like very much,&quot; he said, with easy
self-assurance.

She felt herself blush slightly as
she looked across the table at him. He smiled again and she felt more at ease.

Gray placed their order, the
foreign names for the food easily rolling off his tongue. He knowledgeably
perused the wine list and selected a vintage that obviously impressed even the
waiter. Once finished with the dinner order, Gray turned to Patricia.

Gray began to tell Patricia about
himself, easily taking charge of the conversation. He was a retired Navy
officer and had settled here because of the mild winters and pleasant
atmosphere. He spoke briefly of his childhood and his progression into
adulthood, described his schooling at a well-known university, mentioning he
was graduated with honors. He related how he had lived all over the world during
his Navy career. His background and the far off places he had been dazzled her.
She felt abashed when she told him of her own limited travels and experiences.

Gray told her where he lived and
she was impressed with his address. It was in a prestigious part of town, a
part she had only heard of, one that boasted large custom homes and deep
private lots. She felt very outclassed thinking of her
little apartment complex where she held a yearly lease. 

&quot;You must have been of some
rank to be able to afford that area,&quot; she ventured.

&quot;Well, yes, I was but I also
made good investments.&quot;

&quot;Have you ever been
married?&quot; she asked.

&quot;No.&quot;

She was sort of surprised by his
terse one word answer.� He had been so
loquacious about everything else. Wanting to set the mood right again she made
a joke about how she'd been married very young because she had not learned to
&quot;Just say no.&quot; She figured if he didn't like that fact about her past
he might as well know it now, but he chuckled and said he understood.

&quot;There are some bonds greater
than anything the government or religion can put upon you, you know. No need
for marriage if the partnership is right. I have had several relationships of
longevity myself. I have never had any problem with real women.&quot;

Patricia's brow furrowed slightly
at Gray's emphasis on &quot;real women&quot; but she quickly incorporated it
into her deduction that he had a very high opinion of himself. One of those she
thought, while smiling at the balding fellow across the table, thinks he's a
God's gift to women. Her tenuous newfound footing about his 'type' and his easy
friendliness enabled her to shyly flirt with him, knowing he expected it. Gray
responded to her flirtations in an expertly indirect way that caused her to
flirt even more.� 

In spite of her initial unflattering
conclusion about Gray, Patricia found herself being curiously attracted to him
and hoping he found her attractive. He was sure of himself and that was
appealing to her. Glen, her ex-husband, had also had that air of confidence.
Then there was the fact that Gray was well off and that was different from the
men she had previously dated.� Most of
them had either lived in apartments like herself or
been paying on a trailer. Gray was definitely a class or twelve above the men
she had been seeing. She felt she was not really the type of woman he would be
interested in. Still, if he asked her, maybe she would go out with him again
and see what happened.

As the evening wore on Gray coaxed
her into sharing a split of champagne with him. She felt more relaxed as their
conversation went on. Gray did and said nothing to that indicated he felt she
was beneath his station. As the champagne dwindled she admitted to herself that
she found him very amusing and appealing. When it came time to leave he
insisted on pouring one last toast before he escorted her out to her car.

Gray

Gray hoped this would work out. He
was tired of getting his hopes up only to have them dashed again. At least this
time he did not have to go out of town to meet the woman.

The e-mail from the BBO site had
come three weeks ago, supplying a photo, the name, age, and method of
contacting the woman they had to offer. This was accompanied by the usual
cursory information on the offering. After reviewing the data, Gray determined
that woman the BBO offered him for capture and training was a very close fit
for the criteria he specified concerning age, general physique, and
intelligence. 

Gray had not been offered a female
in his hometown before and he looked forward to the meeting for that reason
alone. He had been searching for permanent slave for a long time. If this
worked out then his investment in the BBO service would be money well spent
because not only would he have his slave, he would not have the cost of moving
her belongings across country. 

Gray had entered into an e-mail
correspondence with the woman. Her name was Patricia. They had written back and
forth for a couple of weeks. The missives had been polite and full of questions
about each other�s likes, dislikes and so on. He had been easily able to
determine Patricia was intelligent and witty and that was appealing. No mention
of Gray�s true desire had been made. 

During the course of their writing
he had mostly made a cursory determination about her willingness to defer to
him. It was a start. When Gray found the e-mail communication no longer
beneficial, he had called her. She had seemed very willing to accept his offer
of dinner. He decided to be tentatively pleased at her easy assent to meeting
at the restaurant of his choice.

As Gray drove to the restaurant his
hand slid down to his inner jacket pocket. Yes, the vial of liquid GHB was
there, he grinned in anticipation as he pulled into the parking lot. He
absolutely refused to invest his time in a woman without sampling the
merchandise first, regardless of how he procured the sample, whether the BBO
approved or not.

Gray spotted her right away when he
came in. He saw that she was attractive, though his experienced eyes saw past
her skillful arrangement of clothing and noted the extra weight not present in
the web page photo. He thought her a bit heavy but not too far-gone. Vaguely
voluptuous was an apt description.

Gray sat down and began to pitch
himself, marking the interest in her eyes when he told her the name of the area
he resided in. Though she tried to be nonchalant he could see that she was awed
as he described his lifestyle. He knew from the initial BBO background scan
that her earnings were at the lower end of the scale and that his economic
status would impress her. However, Gray correctly felt that it was more than
that that impressed the Patricia.

Gray believed deeply that nature
had made men superior to females, stronger and smarter. Gray felt that females
should acknowledge this fact and treat men with submissive obedience. The
current concept of equality of men and women was difficult to deal with. Gray
believed that nature would not be denied and that once a woman was properly
enlightened she would be willingly subservient as she should be. Gray was
looking for the right woman to teach.

However, in light of the current
status quo, Gray was not blind to the fact the he was middle aged and balding
even though he kept his body in top condition. Gray� knew his investments and the resulting
payoffs were good fodder for getting a woman interested in him initially. Even
so, he knew he would have to work to sell himself to Patricia, because as with
most women, he had seen her momentary look of dismay when he entered the
eatery. He was accustomed to that, most females seemed to want a man with a
full head of hair and movie star looks. That was okay, soon she would not mind
that he was bald, in fact, if things went as Gray planned, she would be
entertainingly desperate for one bald head of his. But first he must determine
of she was a possible candidate for his needs. 

Gray's years as a high ranking
officer in the service had accustomed him to being in charge. From the
beginning he had found it easy and natural, having people obey his orders. He
also found it extremely gratifying. Later he found it vastly erotic in personal
relationships. He eventually found that women who deferred to his wishes and
conceded that men were their superiors were especially pleasing. If they were
also willing to do as he commanded, sexually or otherwise it gave him immense
pleasure. To Gray such women validated his concept of natural male superiority.
However, the women he had encountered thus far had not been willing to consider
that kind of role as any more than sex play. He wanted a woman who willingly
acknowledged herself as his inferior in all things and was willing to commit to
a long-term relationship with him with herself in that role. Could it be this
one?

They ate and talked. Patricia did
several things that pleased Gray. She offered him the bread first, insisted he
be served first, and waited until he began to eat before she did so herself.
Her tendency to defer to him was promising, he could
see she did so instinctively, without making it a point to do so. In fact, her
deference to him was so pronounced he had to keep reminding himself she had
little or no D/s training.

Gray was pleased that she had been
married young and that it had been a long relationship. He deduced that to mean
she was capable of loyalty. Her looks and way of presenting herself gave Gray
great hope that she would be good in bed. He wondered why she had not remained
married and he asked her.

&quot;Well, I married quite young
and I loved my husband dearly but he began using drugs. He was a wonderful man
but as the drugs got worse he became physically abusive.&quot; Patricia blushed
deeply at this point but continued, &quot; He almost
killed me on two occasions and I had to leave, I had no choice. I kept hoping
he would come to his senses and get some help but it never happened.&quot; 

&quot;Oh, you left due to his not
receiving treatment?&quot;

&quot; Yes,
I felt I had no choice. I can't explain but, gosh, this must sound odd, but I
felt so scared, so alone. We lost touch. You see, Glen was a strong man. He
made all the decisions and took care of everything until the drugs, and then
gradually he began putting everything on me. I didn't know what to do or when.
I mean I have managed in my little apartment but it's been hard. I keep finding
myself at loose ends. At least I don't have to repair anything. I call the
landlord. Anyway after the drug use began Glen wasn't there for me, do you know
what I mean?&quot; 

Gray nodded encouragingly.

&quot;On top of that, it got to the
point that Glen would become violent when he got frustrated with me for not
handling things like he wanted. Sometimes he would hit me when he couldn't find
drugs to buy or over some other little thing that was really
inconsequential.� I was stupid, I guess.
I stayed with him. I loved him but still...eventually he didn't seem to care
about me at all.� I was so alone and
hurt. We had been so close.&quot;

Gray heard in her remarks something
that intrigued him. She needed closeness and someone one to be a mentor. He
began to quiz her on what she perceived as closeness.

&quot;How do you mean close?&quot;

&quot; Before
the drugs, Glen always kept me with him, even when he went hunting or fishing.
We were hardly ever apart. I loved just being with him, cooking for him and
doing things for him. He always decided what we would do and I was never bored.
I never knew what he would come up with next. He was definitely not liberated
and maybe I am old fashioned but I loved being his wife and doing as he
pleased,&quot; Patricia's eyes softened at the fond memory of those times.

She shook her head as if to dispel
the memories and said, &quot; Then he started doing
drugs. I tried them once because he asked me to but they made me sick so he
didn't make me do anymore. It got worse and, well, in the end he would come in
at night with the drug boys, and either spend his time watching television or
doing dope, &quot; Patricia blushed and continued,
&quot; Really, I wasn't included in any way. They didn't want me around. It
almost killed me to see Glen give himself up to the drugs.&quot; 

&quot;Yes, chemicals can wreck
lives and not only the lives of the users.&quot;

Patricia looked at Gray and nodded
sadly.

Gray took stock of the woman in
front of him. She was intelligent and he found her desire to be with her mate
in a relatively subordinate role very encouraging. She would also be a fine
physical specimen with a bit of toning. Her current aura of diffident
self-confidence and independence seemed to be the result of being alone as well
as being a type of self-defense.� It
could prove to be profitable and pleasurable if she could retain that aura
after their relationship progressed. That would be a challenge to him. 

Gray asked if she had children and
she told him that she had a wanted a child badly and she and Glen had tried but
nothing came of that. &quot;He said I was real breeding material and needed to
be kept knocked up,&quot; Patricia chuckled and then turned beet red when she
realized what she had said. 

She was abashed that she had
mentioned it. Though she had discussed the violence in her and Glen's
relationship this was more candid about than she had intended to be. She cursed
herself and hoped Gray did not read too closely between the lines. She had a
quick mental glimpse of Glen above her, holding her down by her wrists as he
made love to her, panting as he grunted, &quot; I'm gonna breed you good this
time. I'm gonna plant you good and watch you swell up with my seed. Give it to
me...&quot; A twinge of regret and loss surged through her. Though Glen's
efforts had never resulted in a pregnancy she still sometimes found herself
imagining being pregnant and happily carrying a man's child. The idea of pregnancy
was natural and appealing.

&quot;I think it's natural for a
woman to want to have babies,&quot; she said, smiling trying to hide her
embarrassment and distract Gray from her unintentional slip. 

Gray astutely noted her mixed
emotions and deftly caught her reference to her husband's attempts to breed
her. He decided she had experienced the male of the species natural dominance
in her life before and he smiled. He mentally saluted Glen, where ever he may
have been.

Gray was very pleased indeed. He
ordered the champagne with delight; so far she seemed to fit his needs
perfectly!

Patricia had begun to shyly flirt
with him during dinner and her flirting increased as they drank. He smiled as
she leaned forward, unaware of how the neckline of her blouse gaped as a
result, exposing the tops of her breasts. He unobtrusively perused her bosom as
she did this. He was pleased to see her breasts were obviously C cups, nestled
in a lacy bra, held up and pushed together creating cleavage. Definitely a C cup. She had blushed and smiled coyly at him
when he looked up to her face. Apparently she was a bit of a tease as well.

They had drunk the bottle of
champagne and he made up his mind to take a chance. He liked her and her
easygoing way. Her body seemed promising also.

It was easy enough for him to
skillfully slip a carefully measured amount of the liquid GHB into her parting
drink. He had then walked her to the parking lot and stood chatting with her
while he waited for the drug to take effect as she sat in her car.

Chapter 2 -
First Step to Acquisition 

Patricia got to the car feeling
pleasantly high as she listened to Gray chat about the sky and constellations.
She thought he seemed interested and she found him very intriguing even if he
did seem to think he was a Casanova. He was actually intelligent, too bad he
was not that physically attractive.

As she suspected he would, he
maneuvered her to brush up against him and he used that as the initiation of a
kiss. She instinctively did what she knew he expected, moving into his embrace
easily, surprised that she found herself relishing the feel of his arms around
her. She kissed him, pressing into him as she let him rub her back. His mouth
skillfully covered hers and she felt his kiss send shivers over her entire
body, even down to her toes.

As the kiss lengthened she felt her
body become very warm. She broke away and hurriedly
got into her car. She began to suddenly feel extremely tired and when she tried
to raise her hand to brush an errant lock of hair from her eyes it was too
heavy. Gray leaned over and peered into her face. She felt her body relax and
she tried to sit up and shake off the lethargy but she just couldn't find the
strength.

&quot;Ohhhhh...&quot;she moaned as
Gray looked at her with curiosity. &quot;Oh, I am so
dizzy and tired suddenly,&quot; she mumbled. He opened her car door and lifted
her out and began helping her toward a van parked a few rows over from her car.
Gray slid the door back on the van's passenger side and helped her into the van
saying, &quot;Here let me take you home. You do not need to be driving in this
shape.&quot; She managed to smile and nod as he fastened the seatbelt around
her.

She dozed heavily as he drove
through the night. She felt herself being moved but was too groggy and tired to
care. She was laid on a soft cot, her arms dangling over the sides as she lay
on her back. She vaguely felt her dress and under things being removed but did
not care nor was she able to make any move to deter the act if she had.

Gray stood over the unconscious
woman and evaluated her naked body. He looked at her furred pubic mound and
noted the protruding outer vaginal lips that peeked proudly from the coarse
hair between her legs. He spread her thighs and bent to get a closer look. He
tugged gently at the long lips and smiled as her pussy popped open, giving him
a whiff of clean cunt. He gazed down at Patricia's exposed vaginal opening.

Yes, Patricia's cunt lips were long
and pronounced, very nice, a definite plus that made her pussy look inviting.
The attribute would also make future necessary procedures easy and the
resulting d�cor more evident. 

Now Gray turned his attention to
Patricia's breasts because their appearance was a significant requirement for
his potential slave.� He critically
evaluated the mammary glands on the woman lying before him. He felt his face
crinkle in an unsolicited smile as he took in the fact that, though Patricia's
breasts were easily a C cup size, they were not over large and they were spaced
well apart. He reached down and cradled a large orange sized breast in each hand,
hefting them and assessing their texture and weight. 

His smile widened. A major point of
attraction for Gray was that Patricia's breasts were capped with large
aureoles, each covering almost a quarter of each breast. Lovely.
He sighed involuntarily as his eyes roamed over the big aureoles and saw that
in the center of each nestled a soft pinky tip sized teat. He squeezed
Patricia's breasts slightly and thumbed her nipples, smiling as the soft flesh
quickly stiffened and rose invitingly. They were quite long when aroused, at
least an inch in length! Extremely pleased with that, he lay Patricia back down
and left the room to prepare himself.

&quot;Wake up, Patricia. Wake
up.&quot;

Her eyes came slowly open and, as
if from a great distance, she saw Gray standing there with his large erect cock
jutting out of the front of his leather vest. She tried to focus and dimly saw
he had removed the shirt and had exchanged his leather pants for leather chaps
leaving his exceptionally big cock and heavy balls hanging free. Her eyes
widened at the size of his penis and testicles and due to the drug's effect she
did not hide the fact she was woozily staring at the sight of Gray's large cock
and balls. They bobbed as he advanced toward her and she found herself dreamily
wondering about the weight and warmth of his dangling testicles. He leaned
forward with his hands outstretched to take her naked breasts but she could not
move to get away as he neared her body.

What was wrong with her? She was
too tired to move. Reality faded in and out. Gray became Glen in her mind.

&quot;Mmmmmmm, let's see here, what
have we got? Oh, yes, nice big nippled tits, perfect.&quot;

Gray�s hands clasped around her
breasts and kneaded them gently. He bunched up an aureole and nipple and dipped
his head to it, flicking the nipple with his stiff tongue, looking slyly up at
her face before sucking her nipple in. She heard herself moan weakly as she
helplessly watched his tongue flick back and forth across her sensitive nipple.
She dazedly watched him mouth her, his lips working her nipple rhythmically,
pulling on it with insistent suction. His eyes moved up to rest on her face
while he suckled her, watching her expectantly as he brazenly tasted her
nipple. She wanted to get away from Gray's insistent mouth on her sensitive
breast and his knowing eyes on her face but her body would not respond to her
mind's wishes. She could not move.

&quot;You like that. I knew you
would,&quot; he said smugly as he released her nipple, &quot;Your nipples say
you do.&quot;

He let go of her and leaned back to
survey his stimulation's results on her spit glistening nipples. They had
tightened and hardened immediately, poking up most invitingly as she lay on her
back with her breasts pulled tight by their weight. He pinched them in his
fingers, rolling them back and forth. Distantly she heard herself moan again as
she felt her cunt start to get warm and wet. 

&quot;Good, excellent, it excites
you to have your nipples toyed with and you like to have them suckled, that's a
perfectly natural female response,&quot; Gray said as he continued to minister
to her nipples. He glanced down and nodded as he saw her cunt lips swelling and
spreading, showing her gaping wet hole. 

&quot;Hmmm, good, nipple teasing
gets your little cunt wet too, very good. I like
that.&quot;

He looked at her face and stepped
forwards to straddle the cot as his hands continued to pull and tweak her
nipples. He let go, reaching out and pulling her jaw down leaving her mouth
agape. He then reached down to take her teats again and tease them as he rubbed
his stiff cock over her face. She felt the hot smooth cockhead prodding her
skin and finally he rested his cock on her lips. Gray wanted to test just how
far he could take her sexually using nipple play to stimulate her to obey.

&quot;Suck my cock,&quot; Gray
muttered, looking down at his engorged penis resting on her ripe mouth.

As Gray hoped for, the stimulation
of her nipples was a weak point for Patricia. She had always become helplessly
lustful when her breasts were fondled, particularly her nipples, but she was
very good at hiding the fact. She had avoided letting anyone touch her breasts
professing a dislike for the activity. Her few partners had been so focused on
getting their satisfaction from copulating with her they had not especially
noticed that she avoided having her breasts handled during foreplay. Gray would
be different.

Glen, Patricia's ex, had known of
it and taken advantage of it. If Glen had wanted sex and Patricia was not
receptive or the act was not straight missionary style sex, he would tease
Patricia's nipples mercilessly until she agreed to do what he wanted. She
always ended up conceding and Glen had enjoyed his power over her. Afterwards
Patricia would be ashamed at her exhibition of lust and Glen took advantage of
that too by deriding her for being sluttish.

Here, Gray had the advantage of
Patricia not being able to avoid breast play. He saw immediately that her
response to nipple stimulation was intense. Gray did not know that her ex had
used this method of control on Patricia but he felt that it could become a way
of controlling her. He did not know how effective it would prove to be. 

Gray's fingers on her nipples and
his order for her to suck his cock gave Patricia unbidden excitement. She felt
herself let go, her inhibitions freed by the effects of the drug and the
champagne. She dreamily saw, not Gray but Glen, straddling her and proffering
his cock, demanding to be sucked. Her mouth opened wider and she helplessly
took Glen's big cockhead in. Gray watched, enjoying her easy surrender, not
knowing that what he saw was a wife willing to suck her husband's penis to
please him. 

Due to the nipple play and her drug
induced vision of Glen, Patricia found herself wanting to suck Gray's cock
badly. In her altered state of mind she was thrilled at Glen's obvious pleasure
and approval though she feared what would come afterwards. She remembered that
afterwards Glen always became angry with her for being a &quot;sex crazed
slut&quot;, saying that no decent wife would suck a cock so well or willingly.

The drug had rendered Patricia
semi-conscious and she was able to let her fear slide past her desire to suck
Glen's cock and please him. Her present condition left her unable to be very
competent at sucking so Patricia began to mouth awkwardly at Gray / Glen's cock
as well as she could, momentarily freed by the drug induced abandon.

Gray carefully slid his thick cock
in and out of Patricia's slack mouth, watching her try to suck him. He smiled
with pleasure as he felt her wet warm mouth surround his cock. Her weak
attempts at suckling him were promising because he knew the drug had for the
most part disabled her and she was performing solely on base instinct. So far
Patricia had met his exacting criteria and she seemed to be an excellent
candidate for a pleasure slave, despite her current demeanor of independence.
He would not know for certain until the drug wore off and he saw how she would
respond to uninfluenced training.

Gray allowed her weakly suckle and
mouth his penis until he was at the point of ejaculation, then he carefully
withdrew his cock and milked himself into a jar. He
saw his captive's drug-bleared eyes dreamily watch him jack his big cock and
pump his thick semen into the jar. He was delighted with the way her eyes
glistened at the sight of his ropy sperm spurting and oozing from his cockhead.
Before covering the jar he scooped a glob of hot cum out on his finger and held
it above Patricia's mouth while he squeezed her left breast. Patricia moaned.

Gray smiled and traced his
captive's lips with the sperm from his finger and watched her lick it off. He
turned and capped the jar of cum and left the room to place it in the
refrigerator. Patricia drifted into total unconsciousness. Gray returned and
looked down at her. Smiling, he picked her up and carried her downstairs.

Gray's house had a feature few
homes in the area offered, a full basement. As they entered the room deep in
the house Gray placed her, on her back again, on a gently sloping leather
chaise and quickly fastened soft leather cuffs on her wrists and ankles. He
fastened her hands to the top of the chaise, stretching her arms over her head,
immobilizing her and causing her breasts to jut out saucily. He fastened the
ankle cuffs to each leg at the foot of the chaise, making her spread her legs
to accommodate the width and length of the piece of furniture. He shoved a
small pillow under her ass. This left her with her cunt exposed cruelly, spread
open and thrust up. He stood and admired the captive female, delighting in the
vision of her helplessness.

Gray began to pull her nipples,
eager to see her semi-conscious again. He smiled when she began to slowly pump
her hips as he stimulated her. His insistent fingers tweaking
and pulling on her teats soon caused Patricia stir and to quiver with sexual
arousal. 

In Patricia's drug induced dream
world Glen teased her nipples. She moaned some more. Gray laughed softly at her
helpless motions and continued teasing her nipples, watching her pump her hips,
causing her cunt to open and close and make soft sounds, as it became wetter
with her juices.

He bent and began to suckle her
breasts again, using his mouth to skillfully tease the buds of her nipples to
throbbing points. As he suckled one nipple he manipulated the other with his
fingers, while with his free hand he began to plumb the depths of her cunt as
she writhed helplessly beneath him. He tweaked her stiffened clitoris causing
her to buck lustily.

Soon her squirming and
powerlessness brought his cock to erection again and he sheathed himself in a
condom before he climbed atop her captured body and covered her, thrusting himself deep inside her upthrust vagina. Patricia whimpered,
&quot; Yes, please breed me, breed me good,
Glen.&quot; 

Gray smiled as he covered her lips
with his, digging for her tongue with his own. Her body responded intuitively
to his thrusts, arching upwards, catching his rhythm, and taking his big cock
deep. He reached down and pulled on her nipples. She responded by shoving herself hard onto his cock and he felt her begin to spasm
with orgasm. Gray groaned as he felt her cunt contract repeatedly on his
pumping cock.

My God, he thought to himself,
she's got a milking machine in her cunt! Over and over her cunt contracted and
pulled insistently on his cock, urging him to cum and to his surprise his balls
twitched and responded with another load of sperm for her. As Gray ground out
his orgasm he felt ecstasy and wonder. He hadn't come twice in an hour for
years! He grunted loudly as he pumped Patricia's cunt full of his seed, his
mind racing, he had to have this one. He wanted to keep her.

Afterwards he peeled the sodden
rubber from his manhood and carefully douched Patricia's used cunt clean and
redressed her, taking care to replace her clothing exactly as he had found it
before he moved her upstairs. Tomorrow morning he would begin to arrange her
breaking and training.

&nbsp;

Chapter 3 - Second Step to Acquisition

Patricia woke up the next morning,
sore and disoriented. Her arms and thighs ached slightly and when she moved to
relieve them she found them a vaguely stiff and sore. She vaguely recalled
dreaming of sex with Glen and quickly shoved the fragile memory from her mind.
She looked about and found herself in a tastefully furnished bedroom with an
adjoining bath. French doors opened onto a balcony overlooking the bay. Her
purse was on the night table next to a white telephone. A gold windup clock
ticked companionably on the table on the far side of the bed. She was covered
with a beautifully made quilt. She threw the quilt back and was appalled at the
wrinkles in her dress.

Patricia gingerly raised herself on
the bed and tried to determine where she was. She recalled clearly being at the
restaurant but that was all.� She hoped
she had not blathered on and said too much while she was drunk. She got to her
feet and found her shoes placed neatly together next to the bed. She slipped
them on and went to the door. She opened it a crack and looked down the hallway
that lay outside. No one in sight. This had to be
Gray's house but where was he? How did she get here? She cleared her throat and
wished for some water.

Stepping back into the room she
went into the bathroom and poured herself a drink of water in a crystal tumbler
she found next to the sink. A new toothbrush and tube of toothpaste had been
thoughtfully laid out for her use. She looked around and became aware that this
was a guest room and bath, unused and unoccupied.� As she gratefully brushed her teeth she
walked out into the bedroom, stopping at the French doors to the balcony.

The balcony overlooked the
sun-brightened bay. A small table and chairs offered a place to sit and enjoy
the view. She walked out to the front of the balcony and looked down at the
circular driveway that arched in front of the house and disappeared into the
stand of woods that entirely shielded the house from the road. She could hear
cars passing in the distance, the sound muffled by the trees and underbrush.
She turned and went back to the bath to rinse her mouth.

As she came out of the bathroom the
phone by the bed startled her as it began� ringing. After it rang several times
she picked it up, answering tentatively, &quot;Hello?&quot; Gray's voice
greeted her.

&quot;Good morning, dear Patricia.
How are you feeling? I will have to remember not to let you have so much
champagne in the future.&quot; 

&quot;What happened? How did I get
here?&quot; Patricia questioned cautiously, fearful she had drunkenly told all
her woes to Gray. That would surely cause him to lose interest in her if he had
any to begin with.

&quot;I took the liberty of
bringing you. You were in no condition to drive and I couldn't leave you in the
parking lot. I had no idea where to send you in a cab so the logical thing was
to bring you home with me.&quot;

&quot;Um, thanks, I guess. Could
you take me back to get my car? I am sorry to have been such a bother,&quot;
she said with obvious shame and nervousness.

&quot;No bother. I enjoyed your
company thoroughly, though I must admit you were a bit quiet after we left the
restaurant,&quot; Gray answered, trying to calm her.

&quot;Where are you?&quot; Patricia
asked.

&quot;I am downstairs. I have
multiple phone lines to accommodate my business affairs. I simply called you
up. I did not want to barge in and make you uncomfortable. I imagine you must
be feeling pretty hung over and I certainly didn't want to embarrass you by
presenting myself at your bedroom door, after all we only met last night.&quot;

&quot;That's very sweet of you. So,
how do I get to where you are from here?&quot;

&quot;Take the hallway to the right
until you see the stairs. Follow them down and I will meet you in the foyer.
See you shortly.&quot;

Patricia managed to make her way
downstairs where Gray was expecting her.

&quot;Hi. Can we go?&quot; Patricia
asked apprehensively upon seeing him.

&quot;Let's have breakfast first. Relax, it may help you feel better.&quot;

With a friendly smile he took her
arm and led her into a sunny kitchen where he had a lovely breakfast prepared
and waiting.

&quot;It�s lovely but I'm not very
hungry,&quot; she said.

&quot;Well, I am and I plan on
eating before I leave. You can watch if you aren't hungry. Perhaps you would
like some coffee?&quot;

Gray motioned for her to get some
and she poured a cup. He turned to his own needs and helped his plate. Patricia
felt her mouth water in spite of herself.

&quot;Look, I don't know what
happened, that has never happened to me before. I am so ashamed. I hope I did
not burden you with drunken sob stories. I am sorry but I want to go
home,&quot; Patricia said.

&quot;Patricia, nothing happened.
You drank too much and said almost nothing.�
I looked after you. I was the perfect gentleman and you the perfect
woman.&quot; 

Gray smiled at her and his command
of the situation plus the fact that he did not berate her or try to embarrass
her for passing out gave her a feeling of relief. He was so different from
Glen!� The night's dream resurfaced.
Patricia nebulously recalled Glen having her suck his cock. She blushed with
embarrassment at the idea. She had to take Gray's word for her actions. She had
to rely on her memory and it didn't challenge anything Gray said and she could
not deny that she was fully dressed and had obviously slept alone. She felt a
bit better so she picked up a plate and served herself to some cantaloupe. 

They ate and Patricia found herself
beginning to be more disconcerted by this man who was so cool and tactful about
her passing out the night before. She made small talk and found they liked
several of the same movies and books. All too soon the food was gone and it was
time for Gray to return Patricia to her car.

As they went into the garage
Patricia smiled again as Gray courteously held open the door and then opened
the passenger door of his van and helped her in. What a gentleman, she thought.

The drive back to the restaurant
was made in relative silence, each thinking about the
previous night and the possibility of a future with the other, though neither
had the same future in mind. As Gray opened the door to the van and helped
Patricia out she felt she had to say something.

&quot;Thank you so much. Again, I
apologize for last night, I really don't know what to say,&quot; Patricia said
as Gray opened her car door for her.

&quot;Oh, these things happen from
time to time. Not to worry. I'll call you later and check on you,&quot; Gray
said.

Patricia answered that she would
like that and again erroneously berated herself for
her behavior the previous night. Gray wasn't making another date and she knew
her conduct last night must have put him off. A female who drinks too much and
passes out on the first date charmed not many gentlemen like Gray, but still he
had said he would call her.

She drove home, her mind racing,
surprised to find herself hoping Gray would call soon.

That evening just when Patricia had
given up hope the phone rang.

&quot;Patricia, are you all right?
Thought I would call and check. It's not too late is it?&quot;

&quot;Oh, Gray, no, it's not too
late,&quot; she mentally steeled herself and boldly went on,� &quot; I was wondering if you were
going to call or if you had just said that to be polite.&quot;

&quot;I'm sorry if I disappointed
you but I was bit busy earlier. How are you feeling, dear? Are you okay?&quot;

&quot;Yes, thank you. I am. I was
pretty tired so I napped all afternoon.&quot;

&quot;Good, I hope to hear you have
recovered fully.&quot;

&quot;I have. I am really am sorry
about last night. I still don't know what happened or what to say.&quot;

&quot;Say you'll go out with me
again then.&quot;

Patricia gladly agreed and Gray set
the date for a week from the following Friday. Patricia couldn't help but
wonder why he set it so far in the future but she was pleased that Gray had
asked her out again. 

As the first week
went by and Patricia found herself thinking of Gray often. She hoped he
would call her to chat but the week dragged on and the phone didn't ring. She
became afraid that he had made the date on the spur of the moment in response
to her remark about his not calling earlier and that &quot;something would come
up&quot; and he would cancel on her.

Gray, meanwhile, bided his time and
conscientiously did not call Patricia. For all of his enthrallment of her and
her excellent suitability for his needs he knew he must be careful to make
himself not too eager or available. Though he knew his physical appearance was
not one of a &quot;hunk&quot;, he could make himself desirable to such a woman
as Patricia with the proper tools and words. At the end of the first week he
sent her a half dozen red roses from the best florist
in town, knowing that she would be very charmed and flattered and she was.

Gray wrote the proper report to the
BBO and included his tentative acceptance of the woman they offered. He
authorized the payment of the finder's fee for dispersal. He knew that in
return the BBO would supply him with further information on Patricia. Gray e-mailed
his report to BBO and expressed his pleasure with the service's offering. As
was his privilege, he reserved final acceptance of the offering until two more
encounters had been made. 

BBO prided themselves
on making sure their customers were entirely satisfied before levying their
substantial final fees for providing a slave. They depended on repeat business
and customer referrals for future revenue. Their prompt reply to Gray stated
that his choice of further investigation of the woman was agreeable and
expected. They also provided the more in depth information on Patricia that
Gray was looking for.

Gray was pleased to see, from the
psychological profile, that Patricia had the precise personality type he
required in a female. She had almost exclusively chosen phallic symbols and
designs when completing the complicated and carefully veiled shape/authority
association section. The tool was excellent for identifying a person's
suitability for a specific submissive role. Patricia definitely felt males superior
according to the results and indicated she was a follower, not a leader. Her
profile indicated she was a psychological dependent and good candidate to be a
true submissive. The indications were that with some work Gray could make
Patricia completely dependent on him and totally compliant to his wishes and
that was what he was looking for. 

Patricia's background indicated
that though she definitely had the potential to be a submissive Gray would have
to be careful in guiding her gently into the sexual aspect of his plan. He saw
that the probes revealed that Patricia had deep seated inhibitions about sex,
considering it shameful and indecent, though a necessary part of an intimate
relationship. 

The reports from covert interviews
with friends of the couple verified this, stating that Patricia had made this
clear by her overwrought embarrassment in front of them when her ex-husband
made remarks and jokes about sex. Apparently he had enjoyed publicly making her
blush and stammer with discomfiture as he related to his friends how prudish
she acted in bed. That would present a pleasing challenge, to coax her to enjoy
and want sex and, eventually, be openly eager for sex with Gray, even in
public. If he could do that he could train her to be the submissive he envisioned
himself finding when he contracted with the BBO. Thinking of his future plans
for Patricia, Gray began to contemplate his method of ensnaring her
emotionally. That was the first thing to do.

Yes, Gray mused, emotional
dependence was definitely to come first. Gray would manipulate Patricia into
falling in love with him and he knew he would fall in love with her if she
responded to his attention appropriately. She had never been in a true D/s
relationship but had unconsciously dabbled in, a natural way, the genre with
her husband as he suspected.� 

Apparently, according to the
report, during a drug party the husband had initiated their engaging in
&quot;swinging&quot; one time and Patricia had participated in accordance to
his wants.� That reduced the challenge
somewhat, knowing she had the capability to love a man and would do as he asked
though she had not wanted to. 

The BBO report repeatedly validated
Gray's deduction that Patricia had the potential to be conditioned to submit to
abuse and respond to any acceptance and kindness by making herself even more
available for further humiliation and ill use just to receive the ensuing
kindness. He knew how to take advantage of this and intended to fully exploit
it. Patricia had the exact psychological profile that he wanted. But first he
had to snare her.

During his lifetime Gray had
learned that one sure way to initially attract Patricia's type was to show
interest but to remain distant and indifferent but firmly prominent in her
mind. That would intrigue her, keep her interested, and make her work to get
his attention and keep it. Once he had her snared his tactics would change. He
knew, from past study, that her type felt they had to please at all costs
because they were somehow unworthy.

Gray knew that, because of this
feeling of unworthiness, Patricia would accept some rejection, abuse, or
ridicule as her due. This was evidenced by her staying with her abusive husband
and by her participating in the 'swinging' session at his direction though she
did not want to be part of that lifestyle. From past studies Gray correctly
deduced that Patricia expected her husband's abuse afterwards for her
&quot;badness&quot; and when he was again kind to her she over-responded, even
to the point of doing it for him again if he asked. Gray smiled over the papers
in his hand. This one definitely looked promising.

Gray called Patricia on Sunday
night and was satisfied to hear the happiness and relief in her voice when she
found it was he. He heard his first victory when she gushed about the flowers
and again apologized for her behavior at their previous meeting. She told him
she had been thinking of him quite a bit and he smiled broadly at the sincerity
in her voice. He told her he had been thinking of their coming date and was
looking forward to it. He mentioned he had made reservations at one of the
better restaurants in town and had a surprise for her.

She expressed much enthusiasm and
then chatted gaily, her pleasure in hearing from him undeniable. He echoed her
pleasure and then made plans to meet with her for coffee at a local bistro on
Monday.

Monday he dressed in Armani and
carried a butter leather briefcase, knowing that his appearance of wealth and
purpose would impress her even more and perhaps put her in a bit of awe of him,
as he believed she should be. She seemed to react as he planned, doing a slight
double take when he came into the cafe and then appearing to preen and glow in
his presence. Her behavior showed his manipulation's influence already as she
obviously deferred to him. He was pleased by the fact that more than once he
caught her smugly looking at some women at a nearby table as if to say,
&quot;I'm with him!&quot;

He held her hand on the tabletop
and smiled as she began to try to please him with amusing stories. After they had chatted a while, he gave her a pair of small gold
hoop earrings in a well-known jeweler's box. &quot;What gorgeous
earrings!&quot; Patricia exclaimed after opening the gift. 

He saw her surprise at the evident
value of the jewelry and saw his desirability rise greatly in her mind. Good,
just as planned, though she could not know of what he had in mind for future
use of the jewelry. 

Patricia's mute but obvious
appraisal of the trinkets was in poor taste but in Gray's eyes advantageous. He
wanted her to be impressed with his wealth. He wanted her to have no doubt that
he was financially secure. He knew from examining her financial background from
the BBO's report that he must seem immensely well off to her.� This would be used as leverage in his future
plans.

When they parted Gray gave Patricia
a chaste kiss and again was pleased to find she moved into him and tried to
make the contact more familiar. This was one of the things he was looking for,
a response to his generosity, his kindness, to be exact, this type of response,
a physical one. He smoothly evaded her small bid for intimacy, firmly but
without causing her any embarrassment, strengthening her interest in him.

He did not call her that night
though she had asked him to and he had no further contact with her until the
day of their date. If she continued to succumb to his manipulations and
presence in this fashion he knew she would be ripe for his harvest by Friday.

Chapter 4 -� Third Step to
Acquisition

Friday came and Patricia was very
nervous. She paced the hallway of her apartment and touched the new earrings in
her earlobes. Why hadn't Gray called? She had not heard a word from him since
they had coffee on Monday. She hoped she had not done something to cause him to
change his mind.

He was so nice! So
strong and refined. She searched her mind and came up with a descriptive
word for him, she smiled as she thought of it for it
was so out of character for her to give anyone this kind of designation. Gray
was sophisticated, yes, sophisticated. Glen had been strong but not the
slightest bit cultured, not that she had minded. Still, Gray and Glen shared
the common trait of assured self-confidence and she found herself liking Gray
even more due to his worldliness and manners. She thrilled in the anticipation
of seeing him again.

Patricia had dated several fellows
the past year but had not been impressed with any of them; they had all seemed
so helpless and boyish in one way or another. None of them had any money to
speak of and none of them had measured up to her memories of her husband in the
early days of their marriage. They had all deferred to her and had wanted her
to make all decisions about where they went and what they did as a couple. Gray
was so unlike any of them that she was smitten in spite of his baldness and mediocre
looks. 

Gray was the first real man she had
met since she met Glen at age 15. He was wealthy (by her standards anyway),
well traveled, and intelligent. His self-assurance and confident handling of
himself rivaled her ex-husband's and really impressed her. He didn't fawn over
her nor did he seem to be obsessed with getting her to go to bed with him and
this puzzled her. 

Patricia knew she was not of the
caliber of woman Gray could have and she intuitively deduced that some of his
interest in her was sexual. She was surprised at his failure to vindicate this
idea during their first date, particularly after she had passed out and ended
up at his home overnight. She knew she would gladly go to bed with him though,
all he had to do was ask. He was a type of man she would not refuse. In her
heart she felt he would probably use her for a quick fling and dump her but she
would take that chance if there were a possibility he might make her a
permanent part of his life. He was charismatic and she found herself falling
under his spell. She hoped he could feel the same about her.

She checked the clock as she began
to pace again. The phone ringing startled her and she gave a yelp. Hurriedly
she ran to get it and almost sighed with relief when Gray identified himself.
He told her he would be round to pick her up in about twenty minutes. She got a
little angry when he said, &quot; Just be ready and
dressed suitably.&quot;� Patricia
retorted that she knew how to dress and Gray said with a placating chuckle that
he would be the judge of that.

Patricia rushed into her bedroom
and nervously rechecked her attire in the full-length mirror on the back of the
door. The black velvet halter topped dress looked good,
the halter tied with a big ornate bow, forming a backdrop for her long graceful
neck. It ought to; it had set her back the majority of her paycheck. The
strapless push up bra lifted her full breasts, filling out the halter-top
nicely.� She was pleased with her
high-heeled sandals, thinking that they enhanced her long legs.

The image in the mirror looked
sleek, cultured, the kind of woman Gray probably was used to. She worried that
she would have to go broke trying to dress for him and she giggled at the idea,
after all this was only their second date. The doorbell rang.

Gray's eyes roved over her,
evaluating her as she stood before him in her entrance hall. &quot;Good, the
dress is a very nice choice,&quot; he finally said and she found herself being
relieved she had pleased him. &quot;The shoes are not suitable though, too casual.
Do you have any black pumps with that high a heel?&quot; he asked, his face
taking on a look of distaste.

She was surprised to find herself
blushing and feeling vaguely ashamed for not making a selection that pleased
him. She hurried to her room and selected a pair of black pumps she had deemed
too plain earlier. She slipped them on and hurried back for his appraisal. He
rewarded her with a nod and a smile as he held out her wrap for her. She slid
into it, feeling surprisingly feminine and dainty.

�They went to the car and she was surprised to
see a limo. The chauffeur opened the door and Gray helped her into the
cavernous seating compartment. He sat beside her and quickly revealed his
surprise, tickets to the theater. She babbled her delight and he nodded to the
chauffeur and the car began to move into the night. She felt very exclusive and
elegant. The theater! She had never been. How thoughtful Gray was.

Gray had made also reservations for
dinner at the Driftwood, one of the most exclusive restaurants in town and
Patricia felt like Cinderella. They dined on roast pheasant accompanied by a
bottle of excellent wine. They ate, oblivious to others, as their conversation
drew them closer together, each finding much pleasure in the other's company.
Patricia confessed her feeling that she was not good enough for Gray but he
reassured her of her that she was perfect for him. She went on to cite several
things about her that made her unworthy of him and again he told her that her
financial status, her having been previously married, and her recent weight
gain were of no importance to him. He told her he enjoyed her intelligence and
her personality. 

&quot;Not to mention your
beauty.&quot;

Patricia ducked her head and smiled
demurely.

�To himself, Gray noted her feeling of
inferiority. He told her he cared for her as she was and Patricia was elated.
All too soon it was time to leave for the theater.

The theater was packed but Gray's
purchase of tickets for a private box gave them luxurious room and privacy to
enjoy the program, an opera about a kidnapped girl. The plot presented the girl
as independent and unwillingly falling in love with her authoritative captor.
As the story progressed she ended up realizing her emerging strong feelings for
her captor and her instinctive urge to be his mate. After working through the
kidnapping and her rescue, she chose to stay with her captor as his woman on
his terms, as his cherished, but subordinate, mate. 

By the time the final curtain had
fallen Patricia had found herself wanting to find love as the girl in play had.
Gray had taken her hand gently during the play and she had thrilled to his
touch. He had looked at her in feigned askance at his physical overture and she
had smiled and clasped his hand tightly to express her consent.

Afterwards in the car he had
produced another bottle of wine and busied himself pouring them each a flute.
Patricia did not see Gray carefully dose her drink with GHB. He used a slightly
greater amount than he used on their previous date.

&quot;Here, dear Patricia, a toast
to our splendid evening. I thoroughly enjoyed it. I hope you did too.&quot;

&quot;Oh yes! It was wonderful.
Like magic.&quot;

She took the glass of wine and
raised it to meet his. The small clink of the glasses punctuated the moment as
they gazed into each other's eyes. Patricia felt herself melt as she studied
Gray's dark blue eyes and she leaned forward to kiss him boldly. Their lips met
and their passion was unmistakable. Gray broke away and smiled at her. 

&quot;Drink up, darling. We have
all night.&quot;

After draining their flutes
Patricia and Gray embraced again and their kisses burned with the unequivocal
passion they felt. Gray moved his hand to cup Patricia's breast and she
instinctively made an attempt to brush it away. Gray looked into her eyes and
said, &quot;You are mine tonight, these are mine. I will touch them if I
wish.&quot; Patricia blushed and nodded demurely, vaguely pleased at having a
man who took control. Gary's hand
cradled her breast as he kissed her deeply. The car sped down the highway
towards Gray's home.

Patricia began to feel woozy as
Gray helped her from the limousine. The driver moved the car a short distance
away and stopped. Gray unlocked the front door and took Patricia�s hand and led
her into the house. She unsteadily followed him and struggled to maintain her
composure but the drowsiness quickly became overpowering and she said, &quot; Gray, I feel dizzy, I need to sit down.&quot;

She staggered and Gray immediately
guided her to a sofa and helped her to sit. She blearily looked at him and
said, &quot;I don't know what's wrong with me. Every time we go out I have a
wonderful time but then I seem to pass out. I am sorry. I don't want you to get
disgusted with me.&quot;

&quot;Don't worry, I don't think
ill of you at all. I like having a woman who needs me to tend to her. I will
take care of you, just let go and sleep.&quot;

Gray looked down at her expectantly
and Patricia smiled, thinking of the girl in the play, and let herself slip away. He gazed down, watching her smile
trustingly up at him as she passed out, feeling his heart tug as emotion
coursed through him. She was perfect for him. Once Gray saw that she was fully
unconscious he carefully checked her respiration and heartbeat. 

Satisfied, he pulled her forward
and unfastened her halter, exposing her bosom. He knelt in front of her and
unclasped her bra awkwardly, freeing her breasts. He massaged them and squeezed
them tenderly, closely examining the nipples and aureoles, again enjoying the
large size and the color of her paps and teats. He watched as his fingers
stroked and gently pulled the long nipples. They stiffened immediately and
rose. He lowered his head and suckled on each nipple, feeling them swell even
more in his mouth. Smiling at his success he rose and went to a nearby
sideboard where he rummaged in a drawer and retrieved a camera.

He smiled again as Patricia moaned
in her sleep. He snapped a picture of her tits that showed her face as well. He
then spread her legs, pushed her dress up, and removed her panties and took a
few shots of her cunt before and after inserting her own fingers into it. 

He flipped her dress up higher,
removed her fingers from her vagina and began to frig her pussy himself. He
watched his finger slide into her cunt. He slipped another finger in, then another, soon he had three of his fingers sliding in and out
of her now very wet cunt, his knuckles glistening with her juices. He carefully
snapped a shot of his fingers rammed deep into her cunt, making sure her face
was in the picture and plainly identifiable.

The feeling Gray was experiencing
was alien to him. He found he cared deeply for this woman, cared so much he was
concerned that he would not be able to keep her in the fashion he wanted. She
was so vulnerable and trusting and he could tell she could become intensely
devoted to him, more so than any woman he had encountered before. He actually
considered making their relationship an exclusive one. 

Gray imagined living out his life
with this willing female, her body and love solely
his. His private paradise with his well trained and willing
subject, one who would never know or service another. He thought deeply
for several minutes and made a decision. Gray put the camera aside and went to
the front door. He unlatched the lock and stuck his head out. Yes, there was
his chauffeur.� 

&quot;Larry, please step
inside.� I need a hand here.&quot;

Larry looked up. When he saw the
excitement on Mr. Winton's face his own eyes grew hot with anticipation. He
hurried to the door to enter, feeling his cock already begin to stiffen in his
slacks. He had given his boss &quot;a hand&quot; before and it had always
proven to be most pleasurable. 

Larry's ability to keep his mouth
shut about what he heard and saw made him a preferred driver for many of Gray's
circle of friends. His willingness to participate enhanced his desirability.
Larry's discretion and willingness to use his sexual skills often paved the way
for him in many scenes such as this one. Gray led his driver into the house and
presented the exposed and unconscious Patricia. 

&quot;I hope to make this one my
latest acquisition, Larry.&quot;

Larry took in the big nipples and
hairy pudenda. Nice looking hole, he thought. Grinning slyly, Larry bent and
pulled Patricia's cunt lips apart to make her pussy gape. His grin widened when
he saw how plainly wet Patricia's labia were. Smirking and nodding he glanced
over at Gray. 

�&quot;What do you think, Larry?&quot; Gray
said quietly, feeling himself fill with jealously for the first time in years. 

&quot; She
looks like she needs a good dicking, Mr. Winton. I mean, just look at that
hole, now that's pretty juicy. That cunt needs to be dicked in the worst way. Needs a cock bad. Want me to plow her for you?&quot;

&quot;Yes, please,&quot; Gray
forced himself to say. He went on, telling himself it
was for the best,&quot; Do you mind if I take some shots while you use
her?&quot;

&quot;Go ahead. I know you're discreet,&quot;
Larry said as he unzipped his slacks and jacked at his already hard cock in
anticipation of fucking the pussy before him.

Larry quickly slipped a condom over
his stiff dick and, unhesitating, positioned himself over the helpless woman.
He worked his cock into her cunt and began to slowly hump her. He looked over
at Gray and grinned as he flagrantly used Patricia's cunt to gain his orgasm.

&quot;Oh, yeah, she�s got some good
pussy, good pussy, look at her take my meat, &quot; he
said as he pumped his dick in and out more quickly.

Gray shot several pictures of
Larry's cock sliding in and out of his captive's cunt, making sure to get
Patricia's face and body in the pictures. He was relieved as the misgivings he
felt about seeing Patricia used by another man slowly fell away. They were
replaced by the familiar pleasing sense of superiority and power Gray always
experienced when he watched one of his females being fucked by another male. It
was immensely satisfying to him for other men to desire his women and use them
if he chose for them to. What power it implied! 

&quot;Yeah, take my meat, girl, get
it.&quot;

Larry continued to fuck the
slave-candidate, gradually thrusting harder as he got ready to orgasm. His
thick cock slid in and out of Patricia's vagina, his cods banging softly
against her supple ass. 

&quot;Uhhh�thanks, man,� Larry said
to Gray as he pumped his cock into Patricia, &quot;How'd you know I was wanting a hole to dump my load in?&quot;

Gray snapped another shot and said,
&quot; I didn't, Larry, but I have never known you to
turn pussy down.&quot;

&quot;Unnnn...true,&quot; Larry
groaned and thrust deeply as he began to orgasm. He pushed himself powerfully
into the unconscious woman, burying his cock up to his cods. He grimaced as he
began shooting his cum, quickly filling the tip of the
rubber he wore. He finished and smiled, reaching down to stroke one of
Patricia�s breasts.� Sighing he pulled
his spent cock out of her cunt. He began stripping the used rubber off but
before he could discard it Gray said, &quot;Say, Larry, try pouring your cum on
her face and into her mouth. Be careful feeding it to her though. She's pretty
far under.&quot;

&quot;Sure.&quot;

After zipping his slacks, Larry
began easing the sperm from the condom into Patricia's mouth. The unconscious
woman instinctively swallowed as cum dribbled slowly into her mouth. Larry
laughed, &quot;Gonna make a cum eater out of this
one?&quot;

&quot;Oh yes. A
cum eater and much more.&quot;

&quot;What do you have in mind, Mr.
Winton?&quot;

&quot;You'll see eventually.&quot;

&quot;Yes, sir.
Whatever you say, but I would like to get into that again sometime, &quot; Larry answered, nodding towards Patricia's cunt. 

&quot;You may get your
chance,&quot; said Gray.

Larry thanked Gray again for the
pussy and headed back outside to await further orders.

Gray leaned over and began to
finger Patricia's used cunt. She was still juicy. He sighed with satisfaction
and released his large cock with his free hand and after taking his other hand
from her cunt he began to smear his cockhead with the juice accumulated from
her cunt. He slid a thin latex sheath onto his cock then began to rub his
cockhead along her pussy lips, teasing himself. When he could take it no more
he jammed his thick meat into her and began to pump his hips.� 

He was amused to see that she began
to weakly shove herself onto his cock even though she had just be fucked mightily
by his driver.� He kept thrusting into
her as he began to pull her nipples. It did not take long before she began to
orgasm, once again thrilling him with her cunt spasming on his surging cock,
making him dump his full balls into her ready cunt. He fell onto her and
allowed his cock to deflate within her. 

After his cock slipped from her
vagina he stood and stretched, feeling excellent from fucking the unconscious
but responsive woman. He pulled the rubber free and emptied his spunk onto the
unconscious woman's vaginal opening. He snapped a shot of her with his sperm
apparently leaking from her gaping cunt and then he bent, picked her up and
carried her down stairs to his basement.

&nbsp;

Chapter 5-
Step Four in Acquisition

Patricia woke slowly and tried to
roll over. When she found she could not she snapped
her eyes open. Futilely she tried to move her arms and legs from the awkward
positions they were in but had no luck. She realized she was tied to a chaise
lounge, her arms pulled up over her head and her feet bound to the chaise legs
at the foot. She was dressed but her bodice had been pulled down and her
breasts exposed. Her skirt had also been pulled up, her hose and panties gone,
and her vagina was made public to anyone who came in. Horrified, she struggled
vainly against the silken ropes holding her captive. She knew immediately that
Gray had done this and she looked around for him.

Gray was nowhere to be seen but
then he could have been in the dark recesses of the room where no light fell.
The only light was focused on three large pictures, each of a different woman
on her hands and knees in obvious submission, her eyes down cast as she licked
at the head of a huge cock hanging in front of her. She felt a flicker of
recognition looking at the man�s penis for some reason. None of the pictures
had been made in the same setting though the long thick cock and plump balls in
each one appeared to be the same. Two of the pictures were taken out of doors
and the other was apparently taken in someone's living room.

Each print was illuminated by track
lighting and all of the women were nude, wearing nothing but collars and
leashes like animals. In each picture the leash was obviously held by the man
whose penis they licked so humbly. She could not see the man's face in any of
the prints. Still, she could see his strength and power reflected in the stance
he held, hips thrust forward, legs locked, his free hand resting casually on
his hip as he accepted the homage from the woman at the end of the leash. 

She found herself being strangely
excited by the pictures and her eyes widened as she studied them. Instinctively
she knew the man in the prints was Gray. What did he have in mind for her?
Would he have her do the same? Repulsion, shame, and embarrassment coursed through
her, alternating with the tiniest shivers of excitement.

Patricia struggled uselessly
against her bonds. She tried vainly to recall the previous night but could not
recall all of it. She remembered the dinner, the theater, and kissing Gray
passionately during the drive afterwards but from that point she was vague.
They had reached Gray's house but her memory was completely fogged over from
that point. She knew she'd been very careful not to drink much,
she did not want to anger Gray by passing out again. She had become so
attracted to him, feeling herself begin to fall in love with him

The sound of footsteps approaching
erased all thoughts of the past night out of her mind. She struggled on the
chaise again, blushing furiously, knowing that it had to be Gray. She was dizzy
with shame and embarrassment; strongly wishing her dress' disarray was not so
brazenly exposing her breasts and pussy even though she knew that Gray had to
have positioned her thus.

Gray entered the room wearing the
same black vest he had on during their first dinner date. He came to the couch
and looked down at Patricia and smiled. &quot;How are you this morning my
love?&quot;

Patricia was caught in a battle of
emotions; anger, embarrassment, and shame, as she watched Gray looking down on
her and seeing his glance occasionally move to her exposed pussy.

&quot;Why have you done this?
Please let me go. Let me go!&quot; Patricia said and Gray bent and placed his
hand over her mouth firmly.

&quot;Easy,
darling. Be quiet or I will have to gag you immediately.&quot;

Her eyes looked up at him hurt and
wide.

&quot;Patricia, listen to me. It's
a kink of mine; I like to have women completely under my control, physically
and sexually. You didn't pass out from drinking the first night we went out, I
drugged you and had my way with you then and last night. I have been so turned
on by you I had to have you in the manner I pleased and I did not want to deal
with you refusing or fighting me. You responded beautifully both times. Very well, in fact. You are very responsive, even
drugged.&quot;

Gray produced the pictures that he
had snapped the evening before, holding them in front of her face, making sure
she saw the extent to which he had used her. Her eyes closed in shame after
seeing the photographs of herself having sex with a man she assumed was Gray.

&quot;Now Patricia, nothing to be
ashamed of, it is what you are made for. I am enchanted with you and I just had
to see if sex with you was good and I did. By the way, you are amazing. I've
never stuck my cock into a cunt like yours. You were made for sex. Why, even
drugged beyond comprehension you fucked me silly.&quot; 

Patricia looked up at him, feeling
his hand across her mouth, cringing from the blatant sexual language, hurt and
scared but finding also herself some how pleased with Gray's adulation of her
ability in bed. She moaned, distraught with her inner turmoil and the
situation.

&quot;Ah, Patricia, don't be
disappointed. Sex is not the only reason I have done this. I care for you
greatly. I find myself wildly enamored of you, falling in love with you and
unable to control myself. I am sure you've heard about your sexual talent
before, if not you should have, but I have other plans for you too. Now I am
going to let your mouth go, don't scream, it will do
no good. This room is completely soundproofed.&quot;

Gray removed his hand. Patricia
gasped and blurted, &quot;Let me go, I'll do whatever you want. I would have
gone to bed with you anyway. You didn't have to drug me.&quot; As she said it
Patricia was shocked to realize that she really did mean it. She was also surprised
that in spite of her discomfort she was experiencing a shiver of excitement at
the idea of being forced to have sex.

&quot;Good girl. That is the first
step towards your freedom.&quot;

She looked at him, surprised,
freedom?

&quot;You intend to set me free?

&quot;I will set you free, have no
fear. You do not have to stay here if you do not wish to. But if you do wish to
stay here with me I want to play some more. Do you understand? I want to take
some time with you and your lovely body, while you are awake, to see how you
like being with me, to see you truly respond, to see if you enjoy me as much as
I do you. Also I want to have you aware that I am using you and of what I like.
Relax, it won't be so bad, I am not a cruel man, I don't believe in harsh
physical pain, in fact you will find some pain pleasurable if you just follow
your body's cues.&quot;

&quot;Can't you untie me? I really
do want to be with you,&quot; she answered gazing at him with a foreign sexual
desire tentatively growing in spite of the fact he had drugged and raped her.
Her helplessness and Gray's calm control had really excited her. She found
herself feeling oddly safe even though Gray had done this to her via drugs and
trickery.

�&quot;No, dearest, I rather like you under my
control. I am sure you've seen the prints on the walls?&quot;

Patricia glanced at the women
orally paying devotion to the man's cock and felt a twinge of jealousy as now
she knew for certain the cock was Gray's. She felt another stirring of desire
to show him she could make him happier than the nameless women of the
past.� Shyly, she looked back at up at
Gray and asked, &quot;That's you? Those are your women?&quot;

&quot;Yes, that is me and those
were little playmates I've had in the past. But, Patricia, I dearly want you to
be more than that, not a mere playmate. However, take heed,
that is how I like my women. Completely in my control.
Suitably submissive, adoring, and in their appropriate place as women,
appropriate to me anyway, as my property.&quot;

Patricia gazed up at him, nodding,
and her mind a whirl. He wanted her for more than a playmate! A vision of her
at Gray's side on a cruise ship came into her mind. The idea of collars and
leases were superseded by this thought. Her eyes remained fastened on Gray.
Gray's eyes were kind as he returned her gaze. &quot;All right,&quot; he said,
&quot;Shall we begin?&quot; Patricia nodded again, tentatively.

&quot;Good.&quot;

Gray leaned over and caressed her
breasts. &quot;MMMM...very pretty tits. I like
that.&quot; Patricia closed her eyes and bit the inside of hr cheek to keep
from whimpering from the shame that washed over her. Gray pulled her bra down
and arranged it so that each breast was supported but left uncovered. She
turned her head, eyes still shut, and flushed pink with embarrassment while he
arranged her breasts and openly discussed them. Helplessly she moaned,
&quot;Please, no. Please don't. I hate it!&quot;

&quot;No, dear.
You shouldn�t hate it. You have lovely nipples�They seem to love being toyed
with. They stick out and plead to be pulled. Like this.&quot;

Gray took each nubbin of sensitive
flesh in his fingers and began to pull and roll it while looking down at
Patricia, noting the red flush of her embarrassment. Gray watched her grimace
as her breath escaped in a big rush when she felt Gray's fingers manipulating
her nipples. They quickly began to swell in his fingers. 

&quot;You do like that don't you
Patricia? Like me pulling your pretty nipples?&quot; he asked, smiling benignly
down at the spectacle of Patricia fighting her inhibitions and her body's
obvious positive reaction as his fingers pinched and rolled her teats.

&quot;Stop, please, stop,&quot; she
whispered from between clenched teeth.

Gray continued to tease her teats,
knowing from the prior sessions what his ministrations would do to her. Every
thirty seconds or so he would ask, &quot;Do you like that, Patricia?&quot; He
knew he was making progress when Patricia finally muttered helplessly,
&quot;Yes, oh, yes, yes!&quot; He slowed his play and began to rub her breasts
leaving her nipples swollen and poking up stiffly. 

&quot;Look at these teats! They
need to be licked, hmm?&quot; 

As he bent and licked the tips Patricia,
now quite excited, arched her back to get her nipples into his mouth. Score one
for me, Gray thought, tasting the stiff nipples. &quot;Ummm, so you want to be
suckled do you? Is that what you are trying to get me to do? Suckle your hard
nipples?&quot;

Patricia was silent with shame as
she deliberately strained to get her stiff nipples into Gray's mouth. She
couldn't say it out loud but that was exactly what she wanted. Gray teased her
nipples with his tongue, his goal to hear her ask him to suckle her. &quot;You
must tell me what you want, dear,&quot; Gray instructed as he continued to lick
at her stiff nipples.

�Patricia cringed inwardly, she had always had
a hard time voicing sexual wants, ever, even Glen had
been hard put to get her to ask to be sucked or fucked. Gray was not Glen
though, he was much more skilled and authoritative, and under his hands it did
not take long. Within minutes a tiny whispered plea reached Gray's ear,
&quot;Please...yes, please.&quot;

&quot;Good girl, now I'll suck them
for you.&quot;

Gray obliged, taking each of
Patricia's rigid nipples into his mouth and sucking hard as a reward for her
answer while she moaned with relief. He soon stopped and said against her
flesh, &quot;Now you must do something for me.&quot; 

&quot;Uh, please, please,&quot;
Patricia moaned wanting desperately to feel his mouth pulling at her breasts
again. He leaned back and readjusted her bra to better display her tits. He
then stood and unzipped his fly and extracted the large cock that was evidenced
in the framed prints. &quot;Open your eyes. Look at my cock. Look at it,&quot;
he ordered, hanging its length over her face and mouth. 

Gray�s stimulation of Patricia�s
nipples had the same effect on Patricia it had when Glen had done it. She was
willing to do as Gray asked. Patricia opened her eyes and gazed at his erect penis.

�Lick it,� Gray commanded.

As if dreaming she felt her tongue
pass over her lips and, almost paralyzed with shame, she began to lick the
underside, tasting the warm musky flesh of his cock. He reached down and lifted
her head by placing his hand under her neck, giving her support as she
obediently bathed his cock with her tongue. 

&quot;Good girl, lick it well.
Still want me to suckle your breasts? Tell me what you want me to do.&quot;

She did not answer, attentively
licking his dick, her face red with embarrassment, until he reached down for
her breasts with his free hand. He began gently pinching and pulling her
nipples, first one then the other. Triggered by his manipulations, Patricia
felt lust fill her and she mouthed his cock, now laving it avidly with her
tongue. 

&quot;Umm, good
girl...good girl. But I asked you a question. You should answer me
now.&quot;

She struggled with herself to get
the words out. It was so hard to say what she wanted in a sexual situation but
Gray's relentless tugging and tweaking of her nipples forced a response out of
her. She moaned, &quot;Please, yes, please do it.&quot;

&quot;Do what, my love? What is it
you want me to do?&quot;

&quot;Oh, please�&quot; Her face
flushed even redder.

&quot;What? You must say it.&quot;

Gray tickled the tips of her
nipples, enjoying her dismay.

Patricia's eyes screwed shut again
and she forced out the words in a whisper,������� &quot; Suck
them.&quot;

He pulled away from her mouth and
lay her head down, then he straddled the chaise. 

&quot;You must suck my cock first
to earn your desire. Open you eyes and look at it, &quot;
Gray ordered gently, now using both hands to renew his tugging at her
nipples. &quot;I am going to keep teasing your nipples while I allow you to
suck me. I�m going to let you suck my cock until I am ready to cum and if
you�ve sucked me off nicely, I will allow you to eat sperm from my dick. Will
you eat all the sperm I feed you?&quot;

Hearing Gray say this so calmly and
confidently caused Patricia to quiver with an unexpected thrill. She opened her
eyes and gazed at his stiff cock. His fingers busied themselves teasing her
nipples getting her more excited and she found herself eagerly wanting to do as
he described but how could she? It was nasty, only whores and sluts did that.
She had been well taught in that respect by Glen. 

&quot;What do you say
Patricia?&quot; 

&quot;No�no, I can�t. Please!&quot;


He waved his cock above her face
enticingly, watching her eyes follow its every move. 

&quot;Now, my dear, you must. Look
at it. Look at my dick, Patricia. Look at that big cock,
look at the head of it. It needs to be suckled. Just open your mouth and suck
it for me. You want it, don't you? You know you do. Just think of its thickness
and strength in your mouth and being able to suck on it.&quot; 

He twisted her nipples gently and
her answer came breathily, &quot;Oh, I just can�t do that. It�s wrong.&quot; 

Gray could almost feel the heat
from her gaze as her eyes followed his cock waving in front of her.

&quot;What do you want to do,
Patricia? Do you want me to free you and send you home?&quot; 

�No, please. I want to be with
you.�

�Then suck me.�

She raised her head and her hot
breath fell on his member. He suppressed a groan of pleasure.

�Take it. Put it in your mouth and
suck it.�

Her tongue touched him. She began
to gingerly lick his cockhead.

He allowed her to do so while
pulling and pinching her nipples gently, urging her on.

She began to pant and finally
closed her mouth on his cock and awkwardly suckled him. When she began to
suckle him with a bit more gusto and evenness he pulled his dick free and
asked, �What do you want to do, love? You must tell me.�

She closed her eyes and whimpered,
&quot;Ohhhhhh...put you in my mouth.&quot; 

Gray took pleasure in the shame he
knew she felt as she struggled to say the words. He watched gleefully as she
lifted her head higher, trying to get her mouth on his cock. He pulled it back
further, just out of her reach.

&quot;Why do you want to suck my
cock? Tell me, dear. Look at it when you tell me.&quot; Gray was enjoying
watching the spectacle of Patricia straining and arching her neck upward in an
attempt to get his big dick into her mouth.

&quot;Ohhhh, I-I can't help it. I
have to. I need it in my mouth...please,&quot; the words came rushing out of
Patricia's mouth, her hot breath flowing over his penis, warming it anew. 

&quot; Yes,
you want to love it, of course. Good. Now, do you just like my cock, Patricia?
Or would you suck any cock?&quot;

&quot;Oh, yours, just yours,&quot;
Patricia moaned truthfully. Gray smiled, that would do for now.

Patricia's eyes remained locked on
his cock and he maneuvered his hips to finally feed his turgid penis into her
now eager mouth. Her mouth fastened onto his dick and she began suckling him
avidly. Her eyes closed as she tried to hide her shame for her helpless desire
to fellate him and earn his approval. 

He looked down at his
blood-darkened cockshaft sliding in and out of her red lips and saw her
attempts to hide herself behind her lowered eyelids as her passion took
control. He smiled, pleased with the fact that she now suckled his cock without
the influence of the drug.

&quot;Open your eyes, Patricia,
look at my cock while you suck it,&quot; Gray ordered. Her eyes fluttered open
and she self-consciously stared at the thick shaft of his cock as it slid in
and out of her mouth. &quot;Show me what a good cocksucker you are.&quot;

Gray continued to tweak her nipples
using varying pressure and duration. He was rewarded by the intensity of her
sucking responding to the amount of stimulation he applied. Carefully he
changed his technique from tweaks and pinches to a practiced milking motion and
she began to suck him steadily, moaning while sliding her head awkwardly back
and forth. He mused as she sucked him, feeling her wet mouth slither along his
saliva slickened rod.

Gray knew from this experience that
with kindness and encouragement he would soon have an established Ds
relationship with Patricia. Then, in her training he could probably coax
Patricia into any act of sex he pleased just by teasing her nipples. He
intended to do just that. His goal was to have her become his willing slave, in
love with him and eager for attention of any sort. He wanted her be a zealous
participant in any activity he devised just for the honor of him using her in
some fashion, to be, literally, in the end, a sex slave to him, to his cock, at
his whim and command, for his amusement. He needed lots of sexual amusement, as
he seemed to always be sexually stimulated.�


Gray wanted to have such a woman,
emotionally bonded to him, but consensually kept like a pet, collared, leashed,
and down on all fours most of the time. It would entail an extreme amount of
devotion and self discipline from the woman. She would have to be extremely
loyal, compliant, and eager for the slightest attention from him, just as a dog
would. It excited him. Gray recalled the exquisite feeling of having a woman
crawling after him on a leash, though those that had done so had seen his
desire as a part of sex play. 

Gray wanted a woman who would
remain in a submissive role though she would be the mistress of his home. He
wanted a woman who eagerly would suck his cock or allow him to rut her at his
whim, and be appropriately grateful for his attention. If possible he intended
for Patricia to be that woman, a permanent fixture in his life. His new pet.

Gray knew from past experiences
that Patricia would feel a growing attachment to him as he took her through
each new submissive act with overt acceptance of her participation. She would
become focused on attaining his praise and approval. She would become more
willing to try the sexual things he asked, learning to enjoy them. By
encouraging her with stimulation and kindness, he knew he could teach her to
accept her natural role as a submissive female sexual creature. He knew he
would have to ignore her at times to keep her interest and cause her to become
more willing to respond as he desired. 

Gray planned,
as Patricia became less inhibited and more attached to him he would begin to
sexually withhold himself from her. With training, the ultimate compensation
for Patricia's willingly obedient submission would be nothing more than Gray's
allowing her to service his penis. She would be willing to do anything to be
allowed to do so. This, Gray felt, was the true and natural order of things in
a heterosexual couple. The woman should be eagerly willing to do the man�s
bidding in order to be granted the privilege of worshipping his penis with her
mouth and body. He enjoyed the idea of having that type of control over a woman
and relished the idea of having a female who would eagerly perform for him
merely for access to his manhood as a reward.�
He could accomplish this with Patricia if she gave him the chance to. He
could do it if he could coax her to stay with him for a while and expose her
only to his training and commands. 

Gray would begin by encouraging and
allowing her to let go sexually with only rewards of orgasm, praise, and
kindness.� Consequently she would
eventually desire his attention and approval above all else, even when his
attention inevitably took the form of humiliation and ridicule. In fact, in
time, he would be able to make her crave such treatment if she knew she might
be rewarded with his kindness/cock as favor afterward. 

But Gray's long term plan was to
have Patricia eagerly willing to service any male's cock for him. Gray wished
to condition her to the point that her supreme reward was his praise and his
allowing access to his own cock, the ultimate prize for suitably obedient
behavior. Gray�s self-control, years of practice, and knowledge would be a key
to achieving this in private but Gray knew Patricia's willing cooperation would
be necessary for him to fulfill his social goals with his Domination group.

Regardless of his master plan, Gray
found himself falling in love with Patricia and he was thrilled. From her
vulnerability, her past loyalty to her ex-husband, and her apparent
psychological makeup, it was apparent that she was possibly a true submissive.
He saw evidence of this in her obvious sense of inferiority, her eagerness to
please, her easy submission to his sex scene. All of these traits would enable
him in accomplishing his goal. He loved her and these features in her. This was
perfect. He could not keep a pet he did not love.

Gray knew not to let himself get carried away with Patricia's initial willingness
to perform. She was now in the throws of sexual abandon due to his initially
releasing her from her previous inhibitions and the novelty of the scenario. He
wanted her to be willing and eager due to the mere possibility he would use her
under any circumstances. He had to be careful, to tenderly and kindly teach her
to love sex with him as he wished it. He was counting on building her trust in
him and then her intense loyalty to help achieve this. Then he could move
forward and teach her to love sex in any form, at any time, and with whomever
he designated for her to have sex with..

Gray's other plans for Patricia
hinged on her devotion, loyalty, and willingness to obey him. She would truly
become a willing sexual slave for him. A personal pet, a woman kept in a
sexually submissive role, a woman he had complete control over. A woman he
could use to show his circle of selected friends his prowess as a Master
Dominant, not that they doubted his abilities. Patricia would be his permanent
sex slave and companion.

&quot;Do you want to eat my cum, Patricia?&quot; Gray asked casually as she slurped
at his cock. &quot;Mmmmm-hmmmm,&quot; she mumbled around his dick, finding
herself sucking harder in anticipation. He began to tweak her nipples
mercilessly, urging her to suck frantically at his thick cock as his hips
jerked it in and out of her greedy mouth.

&quot;Okay, dearest, do a good job
of sucking my dick and I will let you have a mouth full of my
cum,&quot; Gray muttered as his cock itself began to jerk and throb with
the expectancy of filling Patricia's mouth with semen.� &quot; There you
are, my baby, I�m� coming. Now don't lose
any of it, show me you know it�s an honor to suck me off. Look up at me while
you eat my cum, show me the gratitude in your eyes
while you swallow it.&quot;

Patricia felt the cock in her mouth
twitch and pulse and felt the hot spunk begin to shoot, filling her oral cavity
with bitter, tart fluid. She squirmed with shame as she heard what Gray was
saying but she did not allow his cock to slip from her mouth. Her head bobbed
and she gulped rapidly to accommodate the big load of semen that began pumping
steadily from Gray's cock. She looked up at him self-consciously and saw him
lovingly gazing down at her, watching her swill down his hot cum as he moaned.
It seemed endless and she continuously gulped to swallow it all as she looked
up to his eyes. Gray's eyes were glowing with love and acceptance. She heard
his moans of pleasure and felt strangely rewarded. 

Patricia did not know that Gray's
moans were largely attributed to watching her eat his cum so obediently, his
cock deep in her mouth. Seeing her shame filled eyes looking up at him as she
suckled his ejaculating cock heightened the sensation of orgasm he was
experiencing. Score another, thought Gray as he watched Patricia obediently eat
the sperm from his dick. 

&quot;Clean it with your
tongue,&quot; Gray ordered and Patricia began to lick his cock, as asked,
cleaning it scrupulously with her mouth and tongue. As his cock slowly deflated
Gray lessened his manipulation of Patricia's nipples. &quot;That was wonderful,
darling. You are a good little cocksucker. I am so pleased with you! Now let�s
get to your breasts, shall we?&quot;

Patricia blushed, her eyes dilated
with both excitement and embarrassment. Gray moved back off the chaise and
knelt and began to suckle her breasts in earnest, wanting to reward her for her
performance as a cocksucker. He could feel her hips move with desire beneath
him as his mouth drove her along. He stopped sucking and murmured against her
aureole, &quot;Do you like to be eaten out, Patricia?&quot; &quot;No, please
don't stop...&quot; Patricia groaned as Gray paused, her inhibitions lessening
with Gray's new control of her libido. 

&quot;Like a hard cock in your
vagina?&quot; 

&quot;MMM, yes, but please don't
stop what you're doing.&quot;

Gray began pulling and teasing
Patricia's nipples again as he spoke. &quot;I'll suckle you as you wish dear
but I am afraid my poor cock is spent. Would you mind if I used a dildo for
your satisfaction?&quot; 

&quot;Please! Whatever you want, &quot; Patricia muttered, cringing as she heard the
desperation her voice.

Gray smiled, &quot;Oh yes, dearest,
I will suck your little nipples well, just let me get something for your little
cunny...&quot; as he reached under the chaise and brought out a realistic dildo
fastened to the inner side of a pelvic harness.

&quot;All right darling let me
strap you into this and you can get your satisfaction while I nurse your beautiful
breasts. I can't wait to get your nipples into my mouth to suck, but I wanted
to tell you first how very good you were, you took my manhood so well into your
sweet mouth. Did you like eating my cum dear?&quot;

&quot;Ummm, yes, oh yes... I loved
it,&quot; Patricia answered truthfully, her nipples aching sweetly under Gray's
teasing fingers and the promise of his suckling her. Patricia looked up at him,
her sexual excitement, along with his praise and kindness, thrilling her.

She found herself blurting
out,&quot; Thank you for letting me.&quot; Gray smiled broadly at her extra
unsolicited response to his question.

Amazed, Patricia felt herself relax
in the freedom Gray's control of her body gave her. She was surprised at her
new sense of freedom and security, in spite of the bonds that held her down on
the chaise and the man who had just 'forced' her to suck his cock. She quickly
realized that it was the bonds that set her free. 

Gray said, �Darling, you were so
welcome and so wonderful. I wish I had found you long ago. I�d love to be able
to feed you my sperm everyday. You�re the woman I�ve always dreamed about!�
Gray took her into his arms and kissed her. Patricia kissed him back ardently.
She was thrilled at his words!

Gray enjoyed kissing Patricia. He
felt her response and instinctively knew he was getting past her initial
barriers of fear and inhibition. As his tongue slid around hers, he stroked her
cheek and cradled her head to share with her his tenderness and intimacy. He
smiled inwardly, knowing that things were going much better than he had
imagined. Patricia was so repressed and his simple freeing her of her
unrealistic moral responsibility and shame over her instinctual urges was going
to be a big factor in her voluntarily becoming his willing property.

Initially Patricia had been afraid
the reason Gray had tied her was to physically abuse her. Not that his secret
drugging and usage of her body was not abuse but this morning was more like
love play than actual abuse. Gray kissed her again on the mouth, deeply and intimately
and Patricia responded with ardor. She found herself wishing she could put her
arms around him and hold him close but the bonds held her down. 

Though Gray's idea of sexual fun
was very foreign to Patricia it was surprisingly arousing. He was neither
unkind nor cruel, and his control over her helped diminish her distaste for and
shame about sex. His assured demeanor and confident command of her body also
excited her. She felt free because he physically controlled her and she was
helpless and, therefore, blameless in doing his bidding. Though he compelled
her to have sex with him, he offered encouragement and praise for her
participation. In fact, his acceptance had motivated her to continue willingly.
His physical control of her body, his praise and favorable reception of her
responses had helped Patricia to relax and do as he asked though she found it
hard to say the words he wanted her to say.

Deep within Patricia�s subconscious
mind references to more instinctive desires surfaced. Gray had an exceptionally
large cock her primal brain equated with reproductive ability. Other
complicated psychological processes within her mind subconsciously equated the
massive size of Gray's penis with power, strength, and authority. As a result,
she had felt naturally inferior and subservient, therefore, instinctively
obliged and even grateful to be allowed to put Gray�s penis into her mouth and
suck it as he ordered.

As the session continued, Patricia
realized just how much Gray's 'play' had stimulated her and she felt a deep
gratitude at being able to respond to him and not be 'responsible' for her
actions. 

Patricia recalled that every time
she had been the slightest bit sexually forward with her former husband, Glen,
accusations had been made and her womanhood and fidelity had been questioned.
Whenever she expressed sexual need of her own Glen had accused her of being a
&quot;filthy cheap whore&quot; and &quot;an indecent slut&quot; and worse. This
led Patricia to feel guilty about her sexual desires. She had learned to be
demurely responsive but never openly sexual, keeping her longings well hidden.
Glen's abuse had made it safer to pretend not to like it at all and she was
afraid of losing control and being chastised for her desires. Years of stifling
her libido had taken their toll and she had become prudish and unwilling to
admit any sexual interest in men. Through his physical control of her body,
Gray had freed her to enjoy herself sexually and had been willing to meet her
needs after demanding she fulfill his. She saw nothing wrong with this quid pro quo but it still was not easy
for her to convey her desires.

After a while Gray broke the kiss
off and lifted the skirt of Patricia's dress. He pinched the upper part of her
inner thighs to signal her to spread her legs and give him access to her cunt.
�Spread your legs,� he commanded. Patricia blushed, but obediently spread her
legs, causing her cunt to gape open even more as it was offered for Gray's use.

Gray smiled approvingly and said,
�Good girl.� He tugged on the swollen cunt lips, pulling them wide apart and
exposing the heart of the slave candidate's cunt. He prodded at her vaginal
opening with the head of the dildo, gently pushing it inside of her. He slowly
fitted the 8&quot; rod snugly in her open cunt, rocking it back and forth to
get it as far within her as possible. Then he strapped the attached harness
meticulously about her hips, giving her the full effect of a cock lodged inside
her deeply.

&quot;There, darling, I will untie
your feet but I will leave your hands bound on the long leads. I�ll bind you
about the waist to the foot of the chaise. See, I want you to sit on my lap
facing me so I may suck and play with your gorgeous teats while you ride this
little toy to satisfaction for me. I want to see you cum for me. Can you do this?&quot;
He tweaked and pulled her nipples as he spoke to insure she would comply and he
was not disappointed. 

&quot;Ummm, yes, please, please,
Gray.&quot; 

&quot;Ahhh, darling, yes, you will
be suckled� but you must call me Sir or Master, it will heighten the atmosphere
and it's what I deserve, eh?&quot; 

&quot;Yes, Master,&quot; she
replied timidly.

Gray loosened the wrist cuffs from
the chaise and fastened them together behind her back, making her breasts jut
out. He then pinched her nipples, using them as leads, and guided her to her
feet. 

&quot;And what do you want your Master to do, love?&quot; 

&quot;Please, Master, please,&quot;


Patricia was already wriggling in
the dildo harness, amazed at the excitement she was experiencing just from
referring to Gray as &quot;Master.&quot;�
Too embarrassed to speak, she arched her back, trying to make her
nipples even more inviting. Gray smiled gently. His smile was the result of her
unspoken response and her initial verbal acceptance of her role. Not wanting to
push her too far he decided to praise her actions and finish this scene.

&quot;Good girl, good, keep showing
your Master those nipples. Yes...show your pretty tits to your master, make me
want to suck them while you have that cock deep inside of you.&quot; 

Gray positioned Patricia kneeling
on the foot of the chaise facing the head of it. He then used the ankle tethers
to form a band about Patricia�s waist that he secured to the foot of the divan.
He also retied the wrist leads to the foot of the chaise. This pulled her hands
out behind her, causing her breasts to balloon out even more prominently. He
pulled her dress up again and then slid himself between her legs. This placed
him in a sitting position with her straddling his lap facing him. This resulted
in her stiff nipples being level with his mouth. He disliked the fact that her
head was above him but this was the first session for her and he needed her to
be pleasured beyond compare to entice her to do his bidding in future sessions
in hopes of receiving the same pleasure again.

Gray's tongue snaked out and began
to quickly twitch back and forth over each stiffened teat as his hand squeezed
each breast, bunching them up to offer the nipples for tongue-lashing. Patricia
moaned and thrust her hips furiously, riding the dildo, slipping over to
straddle one of Gray's thighs. 

&quot;Please, Master,&quot; she
moaned and Gray began to nurse at the reddened tips of Patricia's heaving
breasts. He nibbled and pulled alternately at each one, enjoying the stiff
rubbery nubs of flesh on his tongue and lips. His eyes looked upward to see
Patricia's head thrown back and her eyes closed in ecstasy as her hips pumped,
riding the dildo. Gray continued to suck her teats for a few minutes and then
abruptly stopped. He began tweaking and pulling the now elongated nipples with
his fingers. He wanted to prolong and enhance her ecstasy/pain of desire. He
wanted her to truly experience his Mastery of her body. 

&quot;Look here, Patricia. Watch me
play with your breasts. Now!&quot; Gray ordered. He
waited until Patricia looked down; her eyes wide and dilated with excitement. He
continued as he held her breasts up for her to view.� 

&quot; Look
at your beautiful breasts and your long nipples. See how they stick out?
Pleading to be pulled and sucked? You should never hide your nipples, love. You
should display them always. Yes, I think you should keep them bared and exposed
so they can be touched and pulled at anytime. Yes, kept bare so I may touch and
suck them whenever I wish. 

'They are really gorgeous. They
just plead to be suckled. In only one way could they be better. Yes, my love,
your breasts could be full of milk. You would be so beautiful with milk swollen
breasts and your nipples sticking out, plump and needing relief. I would love
to pull and suck on your nipples then, and I would milk you too, dear. Yes,
Patricia, I would milk you often, like this...watch, Patricia, watch me milk
your breasts.&quot;

As he spoke, Gray reached up and
gently took Patricia's chin and guided her head down farther to see his use of
her breasts. He took her left breast in his right hand and held it out, looking up to make sure she was watching. He gave a
light squeeze to the breast causing the nipple and pap to bulge out even
further. Gray delicately took the bulging nipple in the thumb and forefinger of
his other hand and began milking the aureole and teat.� He glanced at Patricia's face and saw her
eyes dilate with both shame and abandon at the intense pleasure she felt as she
watched him 'milk' her.

&quot;Oh, yes, dear, you would be
milked like this regularly, several times a day, then sucked absolutely dry,&quot;
he said continued as his fingers busily milked her nipple. &quot;Would you like
to be kept in milk, darling? Would you beg your Master to pull your nipples and
milk you out? Beg to have your Master suckle you dry everyday?&quot;
&quot;Unnnnn...yes,yes,yes!&quot; Immediately she
began to groan and thrust helplessly against his thigh, riding the dildo rammed
deeply within her vagina. She squirmed deliciously with her heated eyes
fastened on her Master's hands 'milking' her breast. Then a blazing release
filled her, blooming up from her vulva, racing through her entire body.

Her orgasm was the most extreme one
she had ever experienced. At that moment Patricia was completely Gray's. He
could do anything he wished. Gray had an inkling of her carefully hidden
wantonness but he had no idea of how much control he could exert over her
through breast play. Patricia was mortified to find herself being so
electrified by seeing herself 'milked' by a man who saw himself as her
'Master'.� Even so, she never wanted to
leave him, she wanted to do everything he suggested, keeping her nipples
exposed constantly for him to tease, suck and play with. His suggestions roared
in her head, &quot;Yes, yes, Master!&quot; she began to scream as she came.

Patricia collapsed against him and
her eyes closed as the throes of her orgasm threatened to sweep her past
consciousness. Gray tenderly released her breasts and kissed the blooms at the
heart of her aureoles. He began to stoke her back and face as she lay panting
in his arms. He turned her slightly and smiled at the sight of her bound hands.

&quot;Oh, darling, you are so good,
so good. We will have so much fun together. You will see but let me send you
home now.&quot; 

&quot;Send me home? Why? I want to
hold you and love you. Don't you want to play some more, Gray?&quot; she asked
plaintively as Gray unbuckled the harness and gently removed the pussy soaked
dildo from her heaving cunt. Silently he carefully placed it aside and untied
her hands and waist, releasing her. 

&quot;Gray, have I done something
wrong? Please, I want to stay with you.&quot;

&quot;Gray? Excuse me, Patricia, I thought we had settled my name and role as far
as you are concerned?&quot;

&quot;Oh, sorry� Master... Why are
you sending me home? I would love to play some more.&quot;

&quot;You need time to think about
what's happened, about what I have done to you, both today and prior to this.
You should think hard about how you have responded and how it's made you feel.
I care for you a great deal but you should know that I am extremely sex
oriented and that I only enjoy sex in this fashion. This has not been play. You
may not want that. You may decide to turn me in to the police.&quot; 

&quot;No, I wouldn't! I love you,
Gray. I want to be with you anyway you want,&quot; Patricia fervently
exclaimed, desperate not to be turned out by this man. Gray silently rejoiced, this was what he wanted to hear.

&quot;I love you too, Patricia,
however, now you must be quiet and listen. You may decide to continue seeing me
but if you do it will be on MY terms, not yours. Your wishes will come after
mine always and you will always be compelled to do as I wish in order for us to
remain together.� I know that is a lot to
ask but it is the only way we can continue. I want you to make that decision
with no immediate influence from me. Whatever you choose, your decision is
yours to make. I will accept your choice what ever it may be.&quot;

&quot;I know what I want, I want to be with you. You have done something for me
that is wonderful. I actually enjoyed doing this with
you. I have never been able to do this without feeling guilty and scared. I
want you to do all the things you said. I love you,&quot; Patricia cried in
desperation.

&quot;Ah, darling, you have just
been freed for the first time. Take some time to think about what you want. Do
you truly think you would want to be at my beck and call always?� I don't want you to take such a step without
much thought first. I was earnest about my wishes; my desires for you were not
voiced without seriousness. We will wait one week and then talk, okay?&quot;

Patricia unwillingly agreed. Gray
controlled the situation. Reluctantly Patricia dressed as Gray watched. She
looked at him beseechingly but he merely smiled and gazed at her as she
fastened her dress and prepared to leave. After she had gotten fully redressed
he stood and took her arm and guided her up the stairs to the house proper. He
walked her to the front door and in the foyer he turned and kissed her deeply.

&quot;I love you, Master,&quot; she
said shyly, hoping he would change his mind.

He looked at her and said calmly,
&quot;I am glad to hear that for I love you, my pet. Now be a good girl and
think about what has happened and what you want and what I want. I will call
you in about a week.&quot;

With that Gray opened the door and
she saw the limo waiting. Gray handed her into the car and waved at the driver
who pulled away immediately. The drive home was long and she tenderly
stretched, now recognizing her body's softly aching response to the
unaccustomed use she had received in the past 24 hours.

Chapter Six - Step Five of Acquisition

That week Patricia's emotions and
logic battled. She was appalled at the idea of having been drugged and raped by
Gray.� Rape was the only word for what he
had done, it could not be dressed up and presented as
anything else.� As antithesis to this
train of thought Patricia felt she had been freed of much of the guilt and
shame she had experienced due to sex. With Gray, Patricia had the first good
sex in her life. There had been no repercussions for her participation, none,
in fact she had been rewarded for her appetite and interest. 

She questioned her feelings for
Gray. She had not known him that long and here she was professing love for him
despite the fact he had raped her. Still, he had confessed his rape though he
could have gotten away with it. She had not known. She considered the fact that
he had not known her that long and he was suggesting she move into his home on
a permanent basis. 

She recalled their e-mails, their
chats the morning after their first date and during the dinner before the
theater. There had been a contact there that she could not deny, regardless of
his rape of her. They had very similar interests and they enjoyed each other's
company. It was easy to imagine being with him as his woman, subordinate to
him, safe in his care, only having to be worried with pleasing him. She was
sure she could please him. 

Patricia looked around her small
apartment and knew that she would not miss the place if Gray asked her to live
in his huge home. She imagined waiting for Gray to come home after work. She
saw herself demurely awaiting his request for a drink or snack before dinner
and the look of pleasure he would give her when she happily granted his
request. Suddenly, in her fantasy, Gray slipped his hand into her blouse and
gave one of her nipples a pull, murmuring, &quot;Time for your milking, dear.&quot;

Patricia flushed and squirmed in
her chair, flooding with shame as sudden heat flooded her vulva. She slid her
hand between her legs and began to slowly masturbate thinking of how Gray had
brought her to orgasm before sending her home. She came quickly and the rush of
guilt she felt afterward was a factor in her decision. In fact the guilty
feeling was what finalized her decision. She had not felt guilt after sex with
Gray.

The week went by slowly. Patricia
found herself masturbating furiously each day, something she had never done
before. She kept thinking of Gray, replaying the scenes from the weekend and
the basement in her mind. She kept recalling him looking down at her while she
was tied and helpless to cover herself and she felt an
unfamiliar stirring in her loins. She kept imagining his fingers
&quot;milking&quot; her.

By Wednesday she found herself
fantasizing being one of the women in the photographs she had seen in Gray's
basement. She wondered how it felt to wear a collar and cut one of her belts
short and fashioned a makeshift tether to try on. Afterwards, she felt foolish
and ashamed and threw the belt away. Still, later the same night she knelt and
imagined herself sucking Gray's cock. She imagined gazing up at him and seeing
him smiling down at her with pleasure and love as he pumped his penis in and
out of her mouth.

Emotionally Patricia was a basket
case.� She knew that Gray had taken
advantage of her and used her in a most base way. She analyzed his profession
of love for her and could not determine if he wanted her as a wife or a
girlfriend. He would want plain old-fashioned companionship and surely he could
not be sex driven all of the time? This worried her but the tantalizing lure of
companionship and sex without guilt was great. She really did enjoy being with
Gray and appreciated the security he offered. She anxiously waited the week
out. 

Friday she called in to work and
said she was sick. It was a good thing because she found herself in sexual and
emotional agony, lying in bed masturbating or just sitting and staring, lost in
daydreams about a life with Gray. She cried as she thought of Gray, wanting to
be with him, imagining feeling his insistent lips at her nipples, his teasing
fingers driving her to new heights of lust. She went in AOL chat rooms on line
and anonymously told of her exploits with Gray in D/s chat rooms and listened
to other females share about their relationships with their
&quot;Masters&quot;. The chat rooms did nothing but heighten her excitement and
anxiety.

On Friday night at 9pm the phone rang and Patricia almost screamed
with fright and relief. Her emotional and sexual tension had her on edge and
her sexual preoccupation had completely removed her from reality. The intrusion
of the phone stunned her until she realized it must be Gray, her Master! 

&quot;Hello?&quot; 

&quot;Yes... Patricia?&quot; 

&quot;Oh Master! Yes, yes, it's
Patricia.&quot;

Gray asked for her if she would
come see him and she agreed readily. He promised to send a car for her and she
waited anxiously. The limo came within minutes and the driver silently helped
her into the back. The night fled by as the car sped towards Gray's home.

Gray met Patricia at the door and
led her into the foyer. He opened a set of double sliding doors on the right
and ushered her into his elegant living room. The room was open and spacious.
There were tasteful prints on the light gray walls and a large mirror above the
marble fireplace. The furniture consisted of traditional divans and chairs
covered in soft brown leather, accented by lush pillows and throws. The seating
was serviced by gleaming wooden end-tables and, along the walls, sideboards.
Gleaming brass lamps lay warmth across the lustrous wood floors, the grain of
the wood enhanced by the skillful placement of rich oriental rugs. Minimalist
flower arrangements gave a splash of complementary color to the paintings and
carpets. A black leather slave collar and leash were very conspicuous lying
alone on the coffee table between the two divans. Gray crossed the room and
Patricia followed him.

Gray seated himself comfortably on
one of the divans. When Patricia went to sit next to him he gently pushed her
off the couch and guided her to the floor to sit at his feet, saying firmly,
&quot;Darling, when we are alone in my home this is your proper place. Always, unless I direct you otherwise.&quot; She sank down
and sat on the heavy carpet. He leaned over and kissed her deeply then sat up
and looked down at her. &quot; I have missed you. Have
you made your decision?&quot; he asked, gazing down at her face. 

&quot;I want to be with you. I want
to please you. I have been lonely for you all week. I kept remembering what
happened Saturday morning in the basement and it doesn't matter. I just want to
be with you,&quot; she answered with trembling desire in her voice.

&quot;Patricia, really do be
forewarned. I am talking about you living here with me, not a dating affair. I
love you and this will be no fling, no part time play. If you choose to stay,
your stay will begin immediately. I shall require you to be with me, 24 hours a
day, seven days a week, at my disposal. In return I will take care of all of
your financial and medical needs indefinitely. Is that understood?&quot;

Patricia considered what Gray had
said. Live with him? Take care of all of her financial and medical needs? She
looked deep into his eyes trying to fathom if he was being truthful. The
sincerity she saw there was real. She felt herself melt and answered breathily,
&quot; Yes, M-M-M-Master...I...I...I think I am in love with you.&quot; Gray
kissed her again and tweaked her nipples through her blouse as he sat looking
down at her. She quivered joyously at his touch.

&quot; Good
girl, that is as it should be. You need to realize you must dispose of your
belongings such as furniture, your car, your pets, anything that will take your
attention away from me. You may make arrangements to store those things or sell
them. I will pay off your debts and invest what money you have and what is due
to you from work in the event that we part ways. I would never let you leave my
home empty-handed.&quot;

&quot;Don�t say that. I don�t want
to leave, Master, I want to be with you always!&quot;

&quot;Time shall be the judge of
that, Patricia. Now let me continue. You will not be allowed to work so you
will have to quit your job. But, Patricia...hear the rest of what I require and
see if you are still willing before we make plans for you to do any of those
things,&quot; Gray said seriously as Patricia began to rub her head on his leg
fondly.

&quot;Oh yes, Master. I know I will
be,&quot; Patricia said as she looked up at him with adoring eyes.

Gray's voice was kind but took on a
note of unbending authority as he began, &quot;Then I will tell you what I
want. I want a full time companion, a woman and slave. I want you, to love and
to do whatever I ask. You will not be a maid or a housekeeper. I intend to keep
you like a pet, a pet for me to use any way I please. Someone who will make no
demands on me, someone who will always be ready to suck my cock, be fingered,
or fucked, or with you in mind specifically, Patricia dear...� Gray winked at her , �eventually made to give milk so I will have to pull
your nipples regularly.&quot; Patricia blushed and felt her nipples tighten
beneath her clothing and her labia become damp. 

Gray continued, &quot;If you accept
I will tolerate no arguments or refusals from you in the future. I require that
you be obedient and willing to try and do as I ask. You will be loved dearly
and, Darling, you already are. Even so, you should know that I have strict
rules that you will learn and obey at all times. Eventually I will expose your
naked body to others and that I will allow others to use you sexually if it
pleases me. You will not have the option of refusing.�

Gray looked at her gazing up at
him, seemingly stunned. 

With his resolve strong but his
hope limited, he went on, �These things are necessary
for my pleasure and your obedience and willingness to meet my demands will
maintain my interest in you. I will rightly consider myself to be in complete
ownership of you.� You will be a
possession of mine and as such you will make no decisions about what happens to
you. You must trust me implicitly, precisely obey my commands, and accept what
I deem right for you. As I said, you will be my pet, my dearly loved woman, but
my pet all the same. On some occasions and outings you will be clothed, but in
my home you will almost always be nude and you will always wear this
collar,&quot; he nodded towards the table. &quot;Your life is to be
orchestrated as I wish, just as a pet's would, in every aspect. Do you think
you can be that for me, Patricia love? Is that what you want?&quot;

Patricia stared at him and he
waited for her answer. He had never been so blatantly overt about his
requirements. He had to take the chance this time. It felt so right. Would she
say yes or would she flee his home and make him start the search all over
again? Patricia quivered and, blushing ever deeper, slowly began to remove her
clothes. Gray watched in triumphant rapture, his heart pumping, his head
ringing as each article of clothing came off, and she willingly bared her
thighs, arms, vulva, and big nippled breasts. 

Once Patricia was naked she reached
for the collar and placed it about her neck. Turning she bent her head and
offered the back of her neck to Gray saying, &quot;Would you fasten my collar
for me please, Master?&quot; Victorious, Gray smiled and said, &quot;Good girl. &quot; Quickly Gray hooked the collar and then fastened
the buckles over the eyehooks. He snapped on the leash and rose from the couch.

&quot;Good girl, now don't
move&quot; he said again. He unzipped his slacks and extracted his cock and
bounced its stiff length in his palm before her. He caressed her face with his
other hand as he saw her eyes gravitate on it.

&quot; See
this?&quot;

Patricia nodded and Gray continued,

&quot; A
man's cock is a physical symbol of his superiority over women. It is evidence
of the power nature has given all males over females. We are stronger, we
bestow the seed, and we choose the vessel for our seed. In accordance with this
natural law, as my female, you are to love and worship me and my cock at all
times. If you are obedient and you please me I will allow you access to my
penis at my discretion and in the manner I choose. Your decision to accept your
natural role has pleased me very much so I am going to show my pleasure with
you by permitting you to suck me,&quot; he said, offering his thick organ to
his new slave. Patricia felt something deep within her stir in relieved
response to Gray's words as she knelt up and eagerly took him into her mouth.

Patricia looked up at Gray as she
began to suck his cock. He smiled, pleased with her making eye contact with him
on her own as she suckled him.� He gazed
down lovingly into her eyes and allowed her to suck his penis for a few minutes
before pulling free. Her gasp of disappointment was music to his ears. 

He began to walk away, his cock
swaying in front of him. When Patricia went to rise and follow him he turned
and forced her back down to the floor. Gray said firmly, &quot;Darling, you are
my woman, my female, and in my home the proper place for my female is on her
hands and knees in her proper submissive position unless I give you permission
to do otherwise. You are my woman and must behave as I wish to please me. Do
you understand?&quot; 

&quot;Yes, Master.&quot;

Gray tucked his cock back inside
his slacks and went to the foyer, Patricia trailing him on all fours as he
ordered. He turned to Patricia and said firmly, �Now remember, your being able
to stay here with me depends on your ability to follow my orders to the letter
and do exactly as I wish.�

He opened the front door and
Patricia balked, feeling the fresh air hit her naked flesh. Gray gave the leash
a jerk and when the collar bit into the soft skin of her neck Patricia had no
choice but to crawl out after her new Master onto the front porch. The porch
was well lit, anyone in the yard to see her clearly. She heard a chuckle and
pulled up. Her eyes widened as she realized the limo was still in front of the
doorway and that the driver was standing next to it.

Patricia saw the chauffeur smiling
and openly ogling her as she appeared, naked and leashed, on all fours at her
Master's side. She ducked her head in shame, her face flaming, only to have her
Master pull her head up with the leash and move her body around, taking pains
to make sure her legs were spread enough to expose her vagina and anus. He
positioned her with her hind end towards the car so the driver could easily see
her. 

&quot;Let�s show the gentleman your
cunt, pet,&quot; Gray said and she cringed and tried to swing her nether region
away from the man's greedy eyes.

Gray jerked the leash sharply and
repositioned her.

&quot;No! Bad girl, &quot; he admonished as he pulled up on the leash holding
her in place.

Gray bent and tugged her labia out
so her long cuntlips framed the wet hole between her legs. Patricia whimpered
and Gray said softly but firmly, &quot;Do as I say. No harm will come to you.
Remember my terms and adhere to them if you want to stay, love.&quot; Patricia
nodded against the taut leash as best she could, her heart pounding. She was
frightened but Gray's ultimatum and the leash held her still.

Gray stood and said to the limo
driver,&quot; She has a nice cunt hole doesn't she?&quot; Patricia heard the
driver respectfully reply, &quot;She certainly does, sir.&quot;

Once the driver had gotten a good
look at Patricia's nether parts Gray turned her and pulled her upright by her
wrists to a kneeling position so that her breasts could be easily viewed. To
Patricia's chagrin, Master bent and firmly tweaked her teats for the benefit of
the smiling chauffeur. He spoke quietly to her while the driver watched. As
Gray talked he fingered her sensitive nipples, &quot;This is your first test.
Stay silent and do as I wish.&quot; 

&nbsp;

Gray raised his head and spoke to
the driver again. 

&quot;Great set of tits, huh? Yes,
indeed. I�d like for you to come pull on her teats for me, if you would,&quot;
Gray said as he encouraged the man by squeezing Patricia's breasts, causing her
nipples to jut out. The chauffeur nodded vigorously and his smile became a
smirk as he said, &quot;Sure, whatever you say, sir!&quot;

&quot;Well, step over and just pull
on her nipples for me. I want to see how she does, if her cunny gets wet. She's
new to this so be gentle,&quot; Gray instructed. 

The driver quickly stepped forward.
He bent over and grabbed a breast in each hand, squeezing them. Then he took
Patricia's nipples with his thumbs and forefingers and began pinching and
pulling them as she turned her head aside in deep shame. 

Larry leaned over and spoke into in
her ear, &quot;I fucked you good for the Boss last night and now I'm gonna pull
your nips for him too.&quot; Patricia winced and realized that it was not Gray
with her in the photos he�d shown her. She looked up at Gray the shame and
shock on her face. Gray smiled gently and nodded. &quot;It was necessary,
darling. You will understand better as time goes on,&quot; he said. 

Tears began to slowly roll down
Patricia's face as the driver snorted and kept teasing her nipples. As he
continued, Patricia heard herself begin to pant lightly as she unwillingly
became aroused. Being exposed like this on the porch in the open, having a
strange man playing with her nipples, it was so humiliating. She felt herself
becoming even more ashamed and oddly excited. Her cunt began to dampen and she
shuddered. Deep inside she felt horrid and was reminded of when Glen would
tease her nipples to make her horny when she had no interest in sex. 

The driver spoke into her ear
again,&quot; Yeah, you like that, cunny, I can tell. Look how your nips are
sticking out for me, makes it easy to play with them like you want, huh? That's
a good girl, put �em out there and I�ll pull �em good for ya�.&quot; His voice
touched a place she did not know existed within her and she felt herself even
more stimulated by his words. She arched her back slightly, giving the driver
better access to her swollen nipples. The driver and Gray both nodded with
satisfaction at seeing the helpless woman sexually excited against her will. 

The driver leered down at her as
her nipples began to swell in his insistent fingers. Patricia licked her lips
and moaned with embarrassment as she felt her body react. She hated the man
fondling her breasts and hated the way he made her feel but she could not help
getting aroused.

�Yeah, baby, show your master how
you like having your nipples pulled. Makes you hot, huh? Makes you want to suck
and fuck doesn�t it cunny?�

Patricia whimpered softly,
overwhelmed by the battling emotions and feelings that raged back and forth
within her. Gray bent and placed an exploratory finger into Patricia�s wet hole
and she mewled with humiliation, feeling her hips thrust as if to catch her
mater�s finger in her vagina.

&quot;She certainly likes having
her nipples pulled doesn't she?&quot; Gray commented as he stood and wiped her
cunt juice on his slacks.

�&quot;Yes sir, she sure does. It's getting her
hot, too. That's a big plus on a cunt with nipples like these, &quot; the driver answered as he tugged and pinched the
sensitive flesh. Patricia felt wave after wave of heat and shame rush over her,
listening to the men talk about her. 

Larry continued, &quot;You know
most big nippled cunts don't get nice and hot like this, boss, not just from
nipple pulling. It�s cool the way her nips stick out. They�re just begging to
be touched or sucked. Say, sir, do you mind if I suck them?&quot; 

�Well, Larry, her nipples were made
to be sucked and you may suckle her if you wish. Go ahead, but I don�t want her
to come.�

Larry leaned down and lifted
Patricia�s left breast to his lips. She winced as he popped the plump nipple
into his mouth and began to suck on it. Then her own mouth opened in an �O� as
she felt the delicious sensation of having a hot wet mouth at her tortured
breast. She gasped and he chuckled against her flesh. She began to pant
hoarsely as his mouth worked her tender nipple. Too soon he left that breast
and lifted the other up and began to suckle it. Patricia began to work her hips
helplessly as Larry�s hot mouth drove her. Her moans became continuos.

Gray said, �She loves that, Larry.�

Patricia looked up at Gray, her
eyes wide and anxious. Her mouth was slightly open and he could hear her heavy
breathing.

�Ohhhh�� she moaned.

Larry sucked without abandon at her
breasts for another minute or so and her body began to undulate in a rhythmic
motion. Gray recognized the signs of impending loss of control and said, � Better stop now, Larry, before she cums.�

The driver let the stiff nipple
slide from his mouth and resumed pulling both Patricia's saliva slick nipples
for a few moments. They had swollen greatly. They jutted out and were very warm
in his fingers. Her groaning lost its intensity but continued.

�Wow, sir, she�s hot! Jeez, look at
them nipples stick out now!�

Gray said, &quot;You're right, Larry,
they do that don�t they? Don't worry they'll be
getting plenty of action. I was lucky to find a slave like this one. Well,
that's enough for now.&quot; 

The chauffeur stopped. &quot;Thank
you, Mr. Winton,&quot; he said, releasing her breasts and stepping back to enjoy
the sight of Patricia, the new slave, now panting with her wet nipples red and
stiff, poking out invitingly. He leaned down and tweaked each teat pertly and
returned his post at the car.

&quot;So, Larry, what do you think
of my new pet?&quot;�������� 

&quot; Mr.Winton,
I think she'll do great. She's got a good cunt and she's a good fuck too, yeah,
my meat was lovin' it! Those long nipples are just
made for pulling and it�s amazing how hot the bitch gets when you play with
them. &quot; the chauffeur answered and smirked again
at the naked woman on the leash. It was very plain his playing with her breasts
had aroused Patricia. Her face was flushed and though she was crying her eyes
were dark and sultry. 

Gray said, &quot;Yes, I think so
too. That's one reason I've got big plans for this one. Tell you what, come back in a few weeks as my guest and I'll be glad
to put her through her paces for you. She'll be well enough trained by
then.&quot; 

&quot;Sure thing, Mr. Winton,
thanks!&quot;

Gray led Patricia back inside and
closed the door. He knelt and kissed her tears away. The he kissed her mouth
deeply, holding her head in his hands tenderly. He knew she was both very
ashamed and excited. He wanted to reward her for her obedience and encourage
her to continue in that fashion.

&quot;You did very well, darling,
wonderfully and I love you. I expected you to stall but you recovered well. You
were very obedient and that's extremely important to me. Good girl. I can't
tell you how much you have pleased me,&quot; He held her against him and rubbed
her back comfortingly. With Gray's praise and caresses, Patricia felt her shame
at having been displayed and mauled by a stranger begin to melt away.

Gray rose and led Patricia
downstairs to the basement where a digital camera was set up on a tripod. He
carefully posed her as the other women in the three prints had been posed, on
all fours before him. Then he said, &quot;Now, love, since you performed well I
am going to allow you to lick my cock for this picture.
&quot; He unzipped his slacks and pulled his semi-erect dick out.

His hand closed around the shaft
and he began to jack his cock in front of her, making her squirm with
embarrassment as she watched his strong hand jerk at the full 9 1/2&quot; cock
jutting out from between his legs. He looked down at her and said,
&quot;Patricia, I want you to pull on your nipples for me. Make them stick out
for me. Do well and I�ll allow you to lick and suck my cock.&quot;

�As he masturbated she obediently
complied.� She couldn't help herself, she
was wild with desire. Everything that had happened coupled with Gray's calm
mastery had her fingers eagerly tugging at her own nipples. Her
self-manipulation and seeing Gray jack himself began to drive her mad with
need. His swollen penis became red and darkened as he stroked it.� In an attempt to further please her new
Master she began pulling at the tender rubbery nubs till they were even more
red and swollen than before. Gray nodded in approval and she moved to come
close to him but he snapped the leash and jerked her back sharply.

&quot;You may not do that without
my command. You must remember that you will be only be
allowed to lick or suck my penis with my consent,&quot; he said firmly. She
felt her eyes fill with tears again at his reprimand. He reached out and
stroked her head to soothe her, &quot; I love you,
Patricia, just do as I say.&quot; She looked up at him wonderingly. He smiled
and said, &quot; Rub your vulva for me, love.&quot;

Gray watched Patricia begin to play
with herself and he returned to lovingly masturbating his thick cock. Her eyes
could not leave his big cockhead and the tiny slit in its center. By now she
had lost her sense of shame and was eagerly fingering her clitoris, squirming
with desire for the heavy rigid cock Gray jacked a few inches away from her
face. Gray was delighted when she began to pant,

&quot;Please, I want you. Please
let me. Please.&quot;

Gray easily read the abashment on
Patricia's face as she stammered out the words. His pleasure increased. By now
his dick had become massively swollen, the cockhead bulging and oozing pre-cum.
He enjoyed waving it teasingly in his new slave's face and listening to her
voice trembling with shame and desire as she pled for it.

&quot;Are you about to cum,
love?&quot; he asked.

&quot;Oh, yes.&quot;

&quot;Than stop and rub your
breasts and don't touch your nipples. I don't want you to cum yet.&quot;

Patricia obediently began to
massage her breasts, her eyes on Gray masturbating.

Just as Gray felt his balls begin
to tingle with his impending ejaculation he said, &quot;Now...&quot; and
stepped closer to Patricia, forcefully pulling her head up and forward with her
leash. This made Patricia lose her balance. She caught herself on her hands,
taking an all-fours position. Gray locked his legs, and thrust his hips
slightly forward. This left his cock jutting out, thick and swollen, the
cockhead purple and oozing at the tip. Now Gray's manhood was looming
powerfully over Patricia, demanding to be suckled so he could empty his cum
laden balls in her mouth. Gray rested his free hand on his hip and looked down
at her.

&quot;No sucking, just lick your
Master's cock now,&quot; he ordered and Patricia eagerly lifted her mouth to
lick her Master's powerful member. Her eyes were hot and fastened only on
Gray's stiff dick. Her eagerness showed and she unconsciously lifted a hand
toward Gray's huge penis in a small gesture of restrained desire. Patricia's tongue
licked avidly at Gray's swollen glans as it hung over her, cleaning it of
pre-cum, leaving it wet and glistening. He smiled down at her, enjoying her
willing servitude to him. He rubbed the leather leash that symbolized her slave
status back and forth between his fingers. The camera flash went off. Patricia
knew she must look exactly like the other women in the basement prints but she
did not care, all she wanted was to pay homage to her Master's penis with her
mouth and have him praise her. 

Patricia was wrong about her
picture. Her photograph ended up being startlingly different from the others.
Her all encompassing fixation on the phallus she worshipped was unmistakable
and intriguingly blatant to those who saw the final photograph. In the photo Patricia�s
eyes were half open and dreamy with obvious reverence and desire for the
aroused penis she was being allowed to service with her mouth. Her lifted hand
was poised as if too awed to touch such a hallowed object. Her delicate pink
tongue arched toward Gray's manhood, somehow conveying complete adoration,
desperate need, and tentative awe. There was nothing in the ensuing picture
that proclaimed anything other than a woman eager, relieved, and grateful to be
allowed to put her mouth on her master's penis. That was the quality Gray was
looking for, one he had not encountered in any other woman, a true cock
worshiper, a female truly obsessed with and in awe of his cock.

&quot;You may suck me
now and masturbate until you cum for me.&quot; 

Patricia eagerly took
Gray's cock and began to suckle him. He hunched himself repeatedly into her
sucking mouth and knowing he would feed his new slave for the first time.
Patricia groped at her crotch and rubbed her clitoris eagerly as she suckled
her master.� His hot cock filled her
mouth and she pulled and licked at it as her clit itched and burned under her
busy fingers. 

Her clit felt as if it
would explode and she pulled on it rhythmically. Suddenly she began to cum. The
heat washed over her and she sucked even harder at the big dick in her mouth.
Gray grunted and felt himself begin to dump a precious
load of semen into his slave�s hungry mouth.

Gray�s balls twitched as
he pumped his ejaculate down his new slave's throat. He made himself move
slowly, allowing Patricia the opportunity to savor the sperm he was bestowing
on her. He could hear her alternately choking and gulping his cum down. The
choking sounds told him of her inexperience but the fact that she still managed
to swallow it told him of her desire to please him.

He reached down and stroked her
head and used the leash to draw her off of his penis. 

&quot;Darling, again you were
wonderful. I love you, sweet. So good, so pretty.&quot;


She lifted her head to his penis
again. He restrained her. She whimpered but he tapped her crown lightly with
the end of the lead. 

&quot;No whining. I will allow you
my cock when I see fit.� Now, thank me
for allowing you to suck my cock and eat my sperm. Thank me for allowing you to
cum.&quot; 

&quot;Uh, thank you, Master.&quot; 

&quot;Is that all you have to say?
I am disappointed in you. I thought you loved me? Loved my cock?&quot; Patricia
cringed under Gray's rebuke.

&quot;I'm sorry Master. Thank you,
thank you. It's an honor to be allowed to do that for you. I love you.&quot;

&quot;Yes?&quot;

&quot;You are so kind to let me do that. I am really honored you let me take you in my
mouth.&quot;

&quot;That will do.&quot;

Gray knew that he had a long way to
go with his chosen slave. In time she would learn to be appropriately grateful
and express her gratitude properly when he allowed her access to his cock. He
stroked her cheek and she brightened at his touch.

With that Gray turned and walked to
a tiled area that had been hidden in a corner behind a screen. Gray had
installed a bathing area in his basement haven, with taps, a long faucet, and a
shower massage nozzle on a flexible hose. There was no tub or shower, merely a
deep depression in the floor of a 10' X 10' tiled square in a corner. In the
center of the depression was a flat silver grating to allow drainage. He guided
his pet into the tiled hollow and turned the water on and began to bathe her as
one would a dog or horse. She shivered as she felt her new master's strong
hands soaping her body and then the warm water sluice the lather away. Gray's
fingers gently probed her pussy and anus, applying soap and rinsing the
orifices thoroughly. He led her out and toweled her down vigorously, leaving
her skin burnished pink. He then applied a gently scented lotion expertly over
her entire body leaving her feeling pleasantly exhausted, her stomach warm with
Gray's semen and her body clean and refreshed.

�Come, girl.�

Gray tugged her leash and led her
up the basement stairs and to the kitchen. &quot;On your knees and then sit
back,&quot; Gray commanded. Patricia lowered herself and sat back onto her
heels. Gray stood before her and pushed his boot between her thighs, spreading
them effectively, about a foot and a half apart. He then bent and tugged her
cuntlips apart, ensuring that her vagina was open. He straightened up.

&quot;Good. Now turn your head
slightly down and to the left. That is how you will position yourself when I
say 'Sit'. Tits out and pussy spread, hands on your thighs, and eyes on the
floor. Do you understand?&quot;

Patricia nodded and flushed as
Gray's eyes roamed over her exposed body. &quot;Now clasp your hands behind
your back, right above the crack of your ass.&quot;

Patricia did as ordered, the new
pose causing her breasts to be thrust up and out.

&quot;That is what I want when I
say 'Sit up.'&quot;

Patricia nodded her understanding,
feeling very exposed.

&quot;Good. Now thrust your hips
forward. I want you to show me your cunt, offer it up to me. Cup your breasts
and hold them out, offer your nipples to me.&quot;

Patricia did so, her face flaming.

&quot;Excellent. When I say
'Present&quot; that is what you do. Got it?&quot;

Red faced, Patricia nodded again.

&quot;Sit!&quot; Patricia resumed
the initial position.

Gray went to a cabinet and
retrieved a place mat and a bowl. He laid the place mat on the floor next to
the door leading to the hallway. After filling the bowl with something from the
refrigerator he placed the piece of crockery on the mat. Then he went to a
cabinet and pulled out a large crockery water jug. Patricia saw that the
dispensing tap had been replaced with a full sized lifelike rubber cock. A
ball-bearing inside the tip kept the water from dripping, like a hamster water
feeder.

Gray filled the jug with water and
set it on a footstool next to the dish of food. The rubber cock jutted out and
was easily accessible to a person on their hands and knees like Patricia. He
explained,&quot; As you can see in this setting you will have to eat and drink
on your hands and knees. This is your water supply. You may access it anytime
you wish. You can see what you will need to do to get your water.&quot;

Patricia blushed and nodded. Gray
went on. 

&quot;This is where you will be fed
on occasion and when eating here you may not use your hands to feed yourself.
We will usually dine at table unless I choose to feed you by hand or watch you
eat here. &quot;

Patricia watched as Gray motioned
to the bit of pudding in the bowl. He took her leash and pulled gently, guiding
her to her feeding place. 

&quot;I want you to eat,&quot; he
said.

Patricia bent her head down and
began to lick and suck the pudding from the bowl. It was lemony and tart.

&quot;How is it?&quot;
asked Gray.

&quot;Delicious,
Master.&quot;

&quot;Good. I'm glad you like it, I
made it myself. The pudding is made with eggs, sugar, lemon, milk, and, of
course, a healthy serving of my sperm.&quot;

Patricia raised her head and looked
up at the man who she had agreed to serve as a sex slave for.

&quot;Yes, love, all of your meals
will be prepared with some semen in them. I want you to learn to recognize and
love the taste. That will help you become more eager to suck my cock.&quot;

Patricia blushed and bent back to
the pudding and ate the remainder. Gray smiled and drew her upright and into
his arms for a kiss and she felt herself grow warm with his praise and new
excitement.

&quot;I love you,
Patricia.&quot;

She almost melted at his
feet.

Gray then took her lead and headed
for the back door. Patricia moved to resume her all fours position but Gray
stopped her. He gently tugged the leash and continued out the back door.
Patricia followed wondering what he had in store for her next. She soon found
out.

Gray opened the door leading into
his large back yard. He strode out and obviously expected her to follow.

She faltered,
the memory of the driver was raw in her mind. Gray noticed and stroked her
cheek. &quot;Pet, there is no one there. The fence is 12 foot all the way
around and solid. No one can see you.&quot; Timidly she walked out after him
into the night. She quivered but then relaxed as she saw that the 12' privacy
fence completely enclosed the yard. He led her across the tended grass to a
small stand of trees at the back of the yard.

He halted and looked back at her.

&quot;Patricia, this is where you
will relieve yourself. You may void yourself now or wait until I walk you
before bed.&quot;

&quot;Oh, no, I couldn't do that.
Not here in the open.&quot;

&quot;Yes, you can and you will.
You are my pet and I will not have my pet pissing and shitting inside my home.
You will get used to it.&quot;

&quot;Please, don't make me do
this.&quot;

Gray sighed and took the end of the
leash and slapped it across Patricia's rump. The mark it left was immediately
apparent. Patricia yelped and jumped away. Gray moved quickly, showing a cat
like agility, and gave her another lick.

&quot;Now, I do not like doing this
but you must follow my rules here. I suggest you void yourself or suffer the
consequences.&quot;

Gray flicked the end of the leash
again, striping her stomach. Patricia hurriedly squatted and tried to force
herself to urinate. Gray stood patiently and was eventually rewarded with the
faint sound of his pet's urine hitting the ground. Patricia hung her head,
crying in shame as Gray watched her pee. The scent of her urine rose to her
nostrils and she almost leapt to clear the area.

Gray again drew her close and
cradled her head in his hands, gazing into her eyes with love and pleasure. 

&quot;Good girl, I know that was
difficult but you came through for me. Again, I can't tell you how much you are
pleasing me.&quot;

Patricia quivered but felt slightly
calmed by the obvious acceptance of even her most base needs by her lover.
Still she wept, with shame and embarrassment.

&quot;Can we go back inside now,
please, Master?&quot; she sobbed.

&quot;My baby.
Yes, we can&quot; Gray took the lead and started back towards the house,
Patricia in tears trailing after him at the end of the leash.

Gray stopped her on the porch and
retrieved a soft towel. He dried her tears and kissed her, telling her again
what a wonderful woman she was and how happy he was with her initial performance
as his pet. She smiled crookedly up at him and he kissed her again. Then he got
some waterless disinfectant and meticulously cleaned her vaginal area before
opening the door and taking her in. She was his.

&nbsp;

Chapter Seven - Gray
takes Ownership and Patricia Learns About BBO

&nbsp;

Gray led his new acquisition back inside and ordered her
back onto all fours. He relished the sound of her hands and knees against the
hardwood flooring as she crawled across the kitchen.

He led her back to the basement and
down into his sanctum. Patricia looked around expectantly as Gray snubbed her
leash to a stout pole that went from floor to ceiling. She watched him pull a
stainless steel table from a closet and set it up in the center of the room,
locking the wheels. He went to a control panel and adjusted the track lighting
away from the pictures and set it to illuminate the table.

He turned to his new pet and untied
the leash and led her to the table. Effortlessly he picked her up, flipped her
over and placed her on the table's shiny surface. &quot;What are you
doing?&quot; she asked as the cold metal chilled her back, causing her skin to
tighten.

&quot;I don't mind explaining but
remember what I do with you is my choice and my business. You are my property
now. Get those legs spread, show me your cunt.&quot;

�Patricia obediently spread her thighs,
exposing her pussy; her face reddened as Gray looked down at her most intimate
spot without reserve. Gray bent and peered closely at it, tugging the lips
outwards as he did so. Patricia felt her cunt gape open for her Master and
sighed with shame not feeling even a tiny inkling of pleasure.

Gray took a blue felt marker from a
drawer under the table and, after careful consideration, made a mark on each of
Patricia's outer labia. Patricia arched her neck up to watch as her new owner
stood looking at her gaping vagina and smiling. Gray stepped up to Patricia's
head and began to remove the gold hoop earrings he had given her from her ears.

&quot;What are you doing?&quot;
Patricia cried as Gray deftly slipped the small golden hoops out.

&quot;Patricia, do not question
what I am doing. It is for my pleasure and your safety.&quot;

Gray tweaked one of Patricia's
nipples sharply to make his point.

Once he had the earrings removed,
Gray stepped back to the foot of the table. From the drawer he brought out a
pliers-like tool, shiny in the bright light. Patricia recognized it at once. It
was a piercing tool, like the one the attendant had used at the mall when she
had her ears pierced. She saw immediately what he intended to do but before she
could react Gray quickly bent, sighted his mark and closed the clasps, expertly
piercing one of the labia of Patricia's cunt.

Patricia shrieked. Gray slapped his
hand across her lips as he manipulated the mouth of the piercer around her
other labial lip. &quot;Patricia, don't make me restrain you. This is necessary
for my pleasure and as I said earlier, your safety.&quot;

Patricia panted through her nose as
Gray removed his hand.

&quot;It hurts, Master,&quot; she
panted.

&quot;Does it?&quot; Gray asked
pointedly.

Patricia allowed herself to truly
feel the new wound and was surprised that she felt only focused warmth in the
area.

Gray smiled at her look of surprise
and said,&quot; Patricia, you see, only the initial
piercing is painful. In most cases the biggest pain is the pain we convince
ourselves is there. If we examine that pain we often find it is bearable or
nonexistent. That is also true with fear. We design a fear of what we don't
know and often find that if we face that unknown that our fear was unfounded.
Now relax and let me finish my work.&quot;

Patricia lay back and raised her
hand to her mouth as Gray realigned the piercer with the second mark. Her mind
raced, Gray was right, she had convinced herself that the piercing would be
drawn out and painful and it wasn't. She trembled as she considered the fear
she had concerning Gray's intentions for her as his slave. She would face those
fears when her training progressed she was sure. Perhaps Gray's philosophy
applied to shame too. She would find out. 

Gray watched her face as he closed
the handles, effectively piercing the other labia. Patricia gasped again but
did not scream. Gray quickly inserted a hoop in each labia,
taking time to fiddle with one a moment or two longer than the other did. He
then began slathering the new wounds with both Betadine and Neosporin.
Afterwards he draped her vulva with a heavy cloth and took a small soldering
gun and braised the rings closed. Patricia blanched as the heat of the
soldering iron warmed her inner thighs and labia but made no move to escape.

Gray patted his pet's head and held
a hand mirror so that she could see her new adornments. Patricia's eyes grew
wide as she focused on the twin gold rings, perfectly aligned across from each
other; one dangling from each of her cunt's swollen lips. From
one ring hung a small golden tag. It was too small to read but she could
see printing engraved on the tag.

&quot;What does it say?&quot; she
asked.

&quot;It has my owner number on
it,&quot; answered Gray. &quot;You are registered with BBO as my property.
Anyone who has you in the circles I travel in will know you are owned and
registered. They need only verify the number via BBO and BBO will contact me if
I am not present, just to make sure you are legal.&quot;

&quot;What do you mean, legal? And what is BBO?&quot;

&quot;Remember I mentioned safety?
There are those who would steal a slave, particularly one as comely and easy to
break as you. BBO is the service that introduced us. The website we met
through? The company is Break, Buy, and Own, BBO for short. You were matched to
my criteria and I yours. They find the 'man or woman of your dreams'?&quot;

&quot;Oh, &quot;
said Patricia with new understanding. &quot;They didn�t tell me it was for
something like this!�

�No, that is not their procedure.
That is why they are so successful. When you signed up for a perfect man you answered
several questions. BBO�s questionnaire accurately detects possible submissives
for people like me to become owners of. If you had answered unsatisfactorily
you would have been sent on a one time date with a man who had applied and
answered like you had.&quot;

� For
people like you? Are there others doing this?�

�Yes, BBO is widely used by
domination Masters and Mistresses all across the country. All over the
world,&quot; Gray answered.

&quot;There are that many women who
are slaves for men?&quot;

&quot;Not only women, Patricia,
there are men who are slaves for women or men and there are women who are
slaves for other women. But for the most part it is women like you who are
slaves to male Masters like myself. That is more
natural. Women should be subservient to men.&quot;

Patricia's eyes widened.

&quot;Will I see any of
them?&quot;

&quot;Yes, in time. I must train
you first. In these circles it is most important that a slave be truly obedient
and willing, even eager to perform for their master and his guests.&quot;

&quot;Oh.&quot;

&quot;I belong to BBO Dominants� organization.
It has regular meetings and events where a dominant�s slave training skills are
tested and methods are shared and documented. We have two annual conventions
each year, the next in about six months. I had just returned from the last when
I found you.&quot;

&quot;Conventions?
What do they do there?' Patricia asked, her mind amazed at the existence of an
organization like her Master was describing.

&quot;At BBO conventions new slaves
are displayed, tested, and rated. Their masters are graded on how well they
have initially trained the new slave and how evident their dominance of the
slave is. Old slaves are put through tests and evaluated as to their continued
training and obedience. New ratings for their masters are bestowed.&quot;

&quot;What if a slave fails the
tests?&quot;

&quot;Well, Patricia, BBO is very
strict. If a Master or Mistress cannot control their slave, meaning the slave
is not sufficiently obedient or submissive, the owner is put on probation and
their training results are re-tested at a later date. If they fail then, the
slave is taken from the owner, the owner compensated and the slave sold at
auction, hopefully to a new owner who can train the slave properly. Many attend
the conventions merely for the auctions, to obtain new slaves.&quot;

�&quot;Sold!?! Could I be taken from you and
sold?&quot; Patricia cried out in fear.

&quot;I am afraid so, pet. That is
why it is important you focus on obeying me.&quot;

&quot;Where do they sell
people?&quot; she asked, her voice trembling.

&quot;There are auction houses in
the US, Canada,
Europe, Asia, all across the world.
Most are BBO sanctioned but there are some black market auction houses. Those
are not sanctioned and dangerous. Stolen slaves are generally sold in them.
That is one reason I have tagged you.&quot;

&quot;What if they cut the tag
off?&quot; Patricia asked, now frightened at the idea of being stolen away from
Gray by a stranger.

&quot;I am glad you asked. I want
to do something but this I can only properly do with your consent.&quot;

&quot;What?&quot;

&quot;I want to place a tattoo on
your body that identifies you as my property, nothing large or visible but
something small and hidden. No one will know it is there but the two of us. It
will give me the ability to identify and claim you regardless of the
circumstances.&quot;

&quot;Where?&quot;
Patricia asked, willing to do it to preserve her status as Gray's property. The
idea of being stolen and used by some else terrified her.

&quot;On the back
of your neck.&quot;

&quot;Please do it, Master. I want
to be yours forever.&quot;

Gray lifted his shirt and showed
Patricia a small tattoo on the front of his left shoulder. The dark ink stood
out, tracing the figure of two small interlocked Chinese symbols. 

&quot;This is what you will be
marked with. This is my sign as Master, and yours, in the lowercase form of
slave, will be the answer to this one. No one will be able to refute it.&quot;

&quot;Yes, &quot;
Patricia breathed.

Gray removed a pair of shears from
the table drawer and sat his slave up. He bent her head forward and shaved away
a small area in the thick black hair at the base of her long neck. He extracted
a tattoo gun and prepared it with a fine double needle. Using black ink he
carefully tattooed his slave with the mark, using no stencil or guide. He knew
his mark and its counterpart well, the counterpart he now etched into his
property's skin.

Patricia felt the sting of the
tattoo needle but bravely held still, knowing she would be permanently and
safely linked to Gray's strength and power by this mark. She shivered as she
realized the finality of the act. She was no longer Patricia Radswell; she was
now just Patricia, Gray's pet and property, forever.

Gray finished the work and coated
the new mark of ownership with Neosporin and a band-aid. He fluffed Patricia's
hair back down over it and she looked up at him. Gray smiled down at the
bewildered and bewitched woman. Her eyes searched his, full of awe, reverence,
and asking for his guidance.

He stroked her cheek and gazed down at her as he pulled his
cock free of his slacks. Her eyes were immediately drawn to its massive
proportions. He smiled at her response to his baring his organ. He jacked it gently
and asked her &quot;Are you hungry, my love?&quot; She nodded, moaning softly.
He held his cock to her lips and said, &quot; Come, I will feed you.&quot;
