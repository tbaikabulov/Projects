CHAPTER ONE 
I like sunsets, but perhaps not in the traditional sense. If asked, I'll agree
  wholeheartedly that the oranges are spectacular, that the reds complement the
  pinks, that it is romantic. The beauty for me, however, lies to the East. I
  turn from the sunset to watch the night-rise. The way the last rays of the
  sun strike the high, craggy mountains of my homeland to give them a pale bloodiness.
  The clouds, bruising from purple to a smoky blue, stretching where they will.
  The smell of night, that after-a-rain clean musk of soil and breezes carrying
  sap on the wind. The sound of it; that first swell of frustration and struggle,
  the dead in the middle of the night, the quickening of the early morning. The
  cruel power I feel growing in me as the sky dies from blue to black. The stirring
  in my abdomen, the heat in my chest, the hunger speaking to me from my loins,
  the blood surging through my body � they tell me that now, now is the time
  to fulfill what I am. A sadist. 
I started early, though I wasn't exactly aware of it. I learned to read at
  a very early age, about three. I could read textbooks when I was five, and
  by chance I came across an anatomy and biology book. My mother, a biologist,
  always had lots of these lying around. Thus, I learned the hidden places of
  people and what the physical act of sex was. By the time I was about six, I
  realized that I found the girls in my class to be quite attractive, while I
  did not find the boys to be so. I had crushes, but of course that was as far
  as it went. I remember a crush I had on one particular girl for about five
  years. The usual story � like somebody for a long time, but never really seem
  to get around to telling them. The suspense of unrequited puppy-love is almost
  better that way, when you're so new to the world. Can you imagine what it would
  be like if a tiny Korean girl, so perfect in every way, came over to a shy
  blonde boy (such as myself), kissed him, and said �Hi, sweetie!�? Can you?
  I probably would have turned red and run away, never to rejoin the dating scene.
  So no, we were just very good friends, and she slugged me in the chest when
  I said that she looked pretty in the pink dress that her mother had shoved
  her into one day. So I learned to be around her, and hide what was inside my
  heart and in my thoughts. Which, as it turned out, proved to be very useful
  to me in another respect. When I turned seven, I began to have dreams. 
Many women, naked, are in rows on either side of me. What's that behind
    me? A very big man. He will do what I tell him. The ladies are in very weird
    wooden things, bent over at the waist like those high school girls who lean
    over counters and car hoods to talk to people. Their hands and heads are
    held by the heavy wooden stocks, and they cry a lot, but they can't get free.
    I won't let them free. 
One of the ladies doesn't cry. I stop in front of her, look her in the
    eye. Dad always says that when you meet someone, you should look them in
    the eye. She does not cry, she stares at me. 
�Why don't you cry?� She doesn't answer my question. She should not do
    that. If somebody asks a question, it's very rude not to answer. She ought
    to know that. I wave my hand at the big man. He walks to her breasts � they're
    kind of big. He grabs one at the tip, and starts to squeeze and twist. The
    lady still looks at me. She's starting to cry, one tear at a time. 
�Don't cry,� I say, wiping a tear away. Then I wave at the big man again,
    and he grabs her other breast, at the tip, and twists very hard. The lady
    starts to cry very hard. 
&nbsp;
�Why didn't you cry when I wanted you to? Don't cry.� I wave something
    different to the big man again, and he pulls out a big clippie thing. He
    moves behind the lady. There are big hand prints on her breasts, and I cup
    a little bit of one in my hand, very gently. The lady is still crying, but
    not so much now. 
�I hate you!� She yelled at me. That's not very nice. She shouldn't do
    that. I wave to the big man, and he spreads her legs apart. She tries to
    kick him, but he is very strong. She keeps bringing her legs together. 
�Stop that.� She doesn't listen to me. I grab her other breast with my
    other hand. 
�What are you doing?� She asks me. She sounds very afraid, but she should
    have listened to me. I pick my feet up off the floor, and hang from her breasts.
    She starts to scream, and throw her chest from side to side. She swings me
    back and forth, but that only makes it worse for her. If only she had listened
    from the start. Her screams get higher and higher. 
�Please, let go!� She asked me nicely, but I want her to do something
    for me first. �Spread your legs,� I order her. She does it very quickly,
    even though they shake. I let go. She's crying again. I wave to the big man,
    and he spreads her legs and high butt cheeks. �This is for earlier.� I wave
    to the big man, and he puts the clippie thing, as big as my hand and as strong
    as the big man's hand, somewhere between her legs, like he's clipping two
    things together. I hear it snap shut. The lady's eyes go very big and her
    face gets very red, but only for a second. Then she starts to scream very,
    very loud. The big man starts to hit her with his palm, hard, on the flesh
    around her hips and thighs, on her spread cheeks. I motion the big man to
    me, and we start to walk away. The lady is screaming and slamming back and
    forth in the stocks, her big breasts bouncing back and forth and side to
    side. The big man and I walk away, down a long line of women, all crying. 
Notice anything else about the dream? Anything jump out at you? Hopefully
  the fact that at the time, I was seven years old. I woke up from that dream
  without really knowing what it meant. I told my parents I had a bad dream,
  but that I didn't remember what it was about. For some reason, I thought that
  if I told them they would ask me a lot of questions, and talk to me a lot.
  Maybe even be angry. I didn't give it much thought, and just went to school
  like you're supposed to. 
Let me make something very clear. I was a normal child. I laughed a lot. I
  played with other kids. I had lots of friends. I spent the night at my friend's
  houses, and we would watch movies or play video games late at night, and then
  get up and go outside the next day. I had loving parents who were very proud
  of their only child's progress in school. I didn't think it was right to hit
  or fight girls. I read a lot, was shy around new people. Just an ordinary,
  though unusually quiet and intelligent, boy. I've had normal girlfriend/boyfriend
  relationships in my life. But when I was about ten, I began to realize that
  something was different about me. Something that absolutely must be kept secret.
  One day, I ran across the word �sadism� by accident in the city library. Sadism.
  That must have something to do with being sad, because �sad� is in it, right?
  I went and looked it up. The definition leered back at me, and I quickly turned
  the page to the beginning of the �G� section so people wouldn't know what I
  had been looking at. I felt a little sick. Was that what all those dreams meant?
  I started to feel really sick, but I also started to feel . . . something else.
  Something within me felt like it wanted to get out. 
When I was in kindergarten, our class had an incubator with chicken eggs in
  it. One day, during recess, I decided to stay in and read. I heard some cracking
  sounds in the incubator, and I rushed over in a panic. Jean, the teacher, was
  cleaning up some paints in the painting area. I hurried over to the little
  plastic dome of the incubator and stared. There was a little beak, coming through
  the shell. I went and got Jean, and she called everyone inside to see it. Other
  kids asked me whether because I had seen the first one �being born,� if that
  made me the mommy. Smarter ones corrected them; no, he's the daddy. I didn't
  tell them that I couldn't be the daddy, because I was a human. I did, however,
  proudly watch the little chicks start to hatch. I stayed the rest of the day,
  even into the afternoon group, to watch them. And they did, sure as anything
  else in the world. When I felt that unknown something within me start to hatch
  in the library, I waited with the same fascination. I went back to the dictionary,
  pulled it off the shelf, and took it to a quiet corner in the library. I wondered
  if there had been a picture next to the definition, flipping quickly to it.
  No picture. See also: pain, domination, dominatrix, fetish, leather, etc.,
  etc. . . . As I felt the dull hurt in my groin, I recognized the nature of
  the hatching egg: reptilian, not avian. 
And here I sit at twenty years of age in a charcoal-colored Jeep Grand Cherokee,
  waiting for the fulfillment of a dream, waiting for a doomed young woman to
  come back to her house. I'm 5'8�, a little below average height. Got some crap
  about that in high school, get more crap about it now that I'm in college.
  Still, it's good-natured, and I go along with it. What I lack in size, I make
  up for in capability. I weigh about 153 lbs, and it's all muscle. Hard, toned,
  defined, explosive, fluid, predatory. My body is a source of pride for me,
  my self-guided chrysalis transformation from a prison of rotundity to what
  I am today. My dirty-blonde hair, darkening now to my father's light brown
  and spreading across my chest, legs, and abdomen as well, has a permanent tousle
  to it. Years of martial arts and a recent year of boxing have made me more
  than confident in a physical situation. Years of reading about warrior cultures,
  ethos, tactics, and training, have focused me to a razor's edge. The Art of
  War , by Sun Tzu, has had a particular affect upon me. My eyes oscillate between
  green and blue, depending on . . . who knows what. Usually they're an off-gray,
  though. I have strong, quick hands, broad shoulders, a narrow waist, a well-muscled
  back. I'm trying to give straight facts. About my dick, there's nothing too
  special, though I grew a bit when I got to college. I'm about 7�, allowing
  a smidge on either side of that for good and bad days. I'm fairly thick, though
  I've never measured it. The girls I've been with can grasp the circumference
  with their hand not quite comfortably. I curve slightly to the left and I have
  a large head covered by a foreskin that I'm quite fond of. And I'm ready. 
Quelling my growing erection with a thought, I watch the driveway two blocks
  away. She's due back soon. My heart starts to pound in my chest. So long. So
  much planning. So much that could be. The girl I'm waiting for is curvaceous,
  her hips and ass flaring out and down from the muscles on either side of her
  spine. There are many similar young women out there, but they seem like cheap
  knock-offs when I compare them to this beauty. It's less a difference of note
  and more a difference of tonality. 
I check my watch. 1:34 am. She's not due for another eleven minutes, at least.
  Out of boredom, I glance through the dossier I have constructed on her. Glossy
  8x11 photographs, taken from rooftops, taken in malls, taken through windows,
  taken at her church with a fake press pass, taken with her legs parted in a
  simple and short-lived missionary to her idiotic Limp-Bizkit-Wannabe-Pot-Smoking-Prematurely-Ejaculating-And-In-A-Goddamn-Punk-Band-Buffoonish-Motherfucker-Fraternity-Jackass
  boyfriend. Okay, so I'm a little jealous. He probably voted for Bush, too.
  Asshole. 
She's 5'6�. I know a lot of guys out there go for the smaller women, because
  they're easier to dominate or it's just a thing for them, but I like to look
  somebody in the eye. She's not petite � she's sturdy, able to bear what I will
  inflict upon her. She is well-toned, though, with clean lines and muscles that
  can push back when you're fucking that hungry muscle between her legs. Though,
  to be fair, she doesn't know that yet. Her breasts court �C� cup range and
  move with the beauty that nature gave them when she runs down Harvard Boulevard
  at 8:10 am. Her tawny hair tumbles down the back of her head to rest between
  her shoulder blades. It wakes up at 7:25 am on weekdays as a tigress, and she
  tames it with straighteners and blow dryers that I want to scream at her not
  to use, that she's so beautiful without all the things that she thinks she
  needs. If she's going out for the night, she puts some bounce in with a curler,
  which isn't so bad. She went out tonight, to see her boyfriend and go to a
  club to dry-hump him. I get hard sometimes, thinking about her getting separated
  from him in the club and ending up in my dimly lit corner of the club, watching
  with a small camera in my �stylish� sunglasses. Zoom function, my friend's
  design. Well, he's not exactly a friend. Let's call him a supplier for now.
  Other girls come up to me in the club, and I sate myself for a time with substitutes. 
I don't have a problem attracting women. Woe be to them. I remember one girl,
  we met at the neon-lit bar of the club that my target and her boyfriend had
  gone to, fake ID's in our hands. She looked up at me with a quirk in her eyebrow.
  Christ, she looked fifteen. We went up to the cushioned room, the VIP room
  she paid for (gotta love those rich sluts), and she began to squeeze my cock
  through my jeans. I had watched her ass crease and sway as we walked up the
  stairs, and I was ready. A juicy ass is my biggest turn-on, followed by a pretty
  face and full head of hair. 
My black tee shirt slid off easily. She crouched on her knees at my side as
  I sat on the wide, circular couch. She brought me out and started her performance.
  I let it go on for about ten minutes, contenting myself and her to fondling
  her barely-B-cup breasts. She wasn't too bad, but she wasn't good enough to
  merit my sitting there and giving myself into her lack of a skilled tongue
  and mouth. I slid my hand to the inside of her thigh at the knee, slowly kneading
  the flesh there. Slowly kneading the flesh higher, higher. Running one light
  finger over her thin and wet thong, flowing my fingers under her thong to sit
  at the top of her little mound. My four fingers, side by side, glided over
  the shaved surface of her sex. She moaned as I passed over her lips, a little
  firmer, and tried to press into my hand, her tongue sliding along the indentation
  at the back of my flared head, then falling over me in wild drunken abandon.
  I kept my hand just outside of the range of pleasurable pressure. There are
  many ways to be a sadist, and denying pleasure is one of my favorites. My hand
  slowly worked it's way between her parted legs and raised ass, already quaking.
  When I reached the beginning of the crack of her ass, I paused. She stopped
  her squeaking on my cock, and raised off it to pout at me. 
�Hey, don't stop! I paid for this damn room you asshole, and you're going
  to �� 
She stopped in mid-bitch as her mouth opened wide and her breath left her
  when I sharply dragged my hand back the way it had come, burying two fingers
  in her. Her eyes rolled back in her head, and I knew that for a split-second
  she was completely off-guard. I grabbed the back of her head, twisting her
  enraging highlights in my left hand and throwing her involuntarily open mouth
  down upon me. Evenly and strongly pumping her with my right hand, her head
  with my left, I bit the dimple on the side of her hip. She started to gag,
  making little noises that couldn't make up their mind between pleasure and
  lack of oxygen. I pulled her up slowly, still working her pussy as she pushed
  it into me. She stopped panicking, waiting for her turn to get air. An inch
  from being off me, I forced her back down, over her untalented tongue, deep
  into her mouth, her throat, her tonsils quavering, her throat starting to shiver,
  her nose buried in my pubic hair. She began to retch. She fought against it
  for a second, slapping my thigh as she shoved herself still further onto my
  hand. I quickly pulled her up. 
�So, you like it rough, huh? I like it rough too,� she cooed stupidly. I stared
  at her for a second, right in the eye, before she fell over me again, using
  her hand to work my shaft. I slapped her hand away and pulled her up, bringing
  her around in front of me to kneel. I gave her my most unnerving quiet stare
  and she started to squirm under my gaze, while I was happily thinking about
  the camcorder running in the sunglasses I had set at a good angle to my left.
  I shoved her tank top and bra down to release her pert tits. 
�Hold them up to me.� Without waiting for an answer, I pulled off my jeans
  and moved to the edge of the couch. She knelt, giggling and lightly pinching
  her nipples. Time for a lesson in deepthroating. I pulled her into me, her
  breasts rubbing up beneath my balls. I told her to use her breasts, to play
  with them. As she did, I dug both hands into her hair and slowly began to tease
  her mouth up and down my cock. Even with me handling most of it, she still
  managed to be inelegant, simply opening her mouth wide and never bringing her
  lips into play, thin as they were. As I worked her up and down, I looked up
  at the TV screen showing the hallway outside of the room. Lo and behold, there
  was my little prey, standing with her goddamn boyfriend. The lack-wit. The
  ghetto-pretender. The backwards-hat cheesedick. The fucking Abercrombie billboard.
  An alarmed squeaking made me look down. Her mascara was cascading down her
  face from the anger that had been coursing through my hands and into her mouth.
  I immediately assumed one of my characters. 
�Don't cry,� I said softly. �We can stop if you want.� 
�No, that's okay,� she sniffled. �But just go a little easier, okay?� 
�Okay, baby.� I pulled her up and kissed her long and sensuously, lingeringly.
  Five minutes of throat-pumping and gagging later, I was nearing the end of
  it. I pulled her up, told her to get a deep breath. Then my hands crushed her
  into me again. She still hadn't gone all the way, but she would. Looking at
  the monitor, I watched my prey fidget nervously with her knee-length skirt
  and the purse on her elbow. I watched her as the moron left for a second, watched
  her alone, looking into the gray-green of my monitor, wondering who was in
  there. She's pretty in the scratchy green light, I thought as I plunged the
  girl's head down and my hips up, to the very root of my spasming cock. She
  began to choke, but I only allowed her an inch up and an inch down, fucking
  the frantic ropes of saliva coming forth. Later, I buttoned my jeans, took
  the girl by the arm, put on my shades-and-hat disguise, walked out past them,
  and proceeded to get the girl too drunk to remember. 
I look at the rest of the dossier, shaking off memories and anticipation.
  She lives alone in a duplex apartment. Alone � no roommates, no kids, no family,
  no boyfriend, no fucking Cujo to tear your calf off. That is to say, no dogs.
  I made damn sure of that last week. She's been going to school at the local
  college for a year now, no decided major yet. She's estranged from her parents,
  only a few friends to speak of, and of course the boyfriend. And there they
  are � Mungsucker and my target. 
He's trying to come in, drunkenly I might add, but she's shaking her head
  no. Guess she's worried about getting to work tomorrow. She shouldn't be. They
  start to shout � I can hear them from where I sit, two blocks away. Perfect,
  now she won't be missed for too long if she doesn't call. He storms off and
  peels out in his big masculine truck as she goes into the house and slams the
  door. Now. 
I quickly check myself over: small bag, a pair of ultra-baggy jeans, a belt,
  an Abercrombie long-sleeved shirt, and a Gap baseball cap, all courtesy of
  her boyfriend's closet-o-crap. If any fibers are going to be dropped in her
  room, I want them to lead somewhere else. I pull the car around, driving towards
  the nearby freeway and the overgrown dirt alley behind the little row of houses
  with a duplex on the end. I walk to her back door, patiently pretending to
  ring the doorbell for the benefit of any watchers. At last, I hear the rush
  of water in pipes as she steps into the shower like she does every night. I
  quietly pick the lock with a locksmith's gun � why the hell aren't these things
  regulated better? � and pad into the house. Speed and stealth are the two factors
  at play now. Reaching into the bag, I pull out my essentials and distribute
  them: black leather gloves, a soft black cloth, and a small black bottle of
  chloroform. 
I pad my way up the carpeted stairs, willing myself not to pay attention to
  the pictures of her friends on the wall. A soft gold light flows across the
  floor from the bathroom, the sound of rushing water behind it. I can feel sweat
  trickling down my back, creeping and slithering along like a coy tongue. Now
  I crouch in her room, noting the closed curtains � this is almost too easy.
  Now all I have to do is�I hear the shower stop with a squeak. Fuck. She dries
  off in her room. FUCK. My heart starts to pound and jump, choking me with glee.
  No, I can't panic. Think. Where does she dry off? In front of the vanity. Okay,
  where will she not immediately see me? No good, there's nothing in the room.
  Just the bed, the door, and the closet. The door will have to do. I quickly
  squirt some of the chloroform in the rag and clench it in my fist, flattening
  myself against the wall that will be covered by the door in a few seconds.
  Still not good: the sound of her feet is making me go blind with lust and anxiety,
  while my fears and uncertainties are making my hand shake. I force myself to
  go still, to become as cold and unfeeling as ice. I'm watching this. It's all
  a movie, a play, a grainy smuggled film, a story. I hear the hinges start to
  squeak, slowly spreading light onto the bed. She walks in, and it takes all
  my willpower not to breathe, to hold still for those crucial few seconds where
  she feels secure. She flicks on the light, still scrubbing at her hair. I must
  be still. She shuts the door. Not yet. She lowers the towel to her shoulders,
  standing naked and unreal with her back to me. Now. 
With a rush, I wrap my right arm around her chest and arms, pinning them to
  her sides. My left hand, chloroform-soaked rag lying upon the open palm, covers
  her mouth as she opens it to scream, muffling the destructive cry. My blitz
  carries us to the bed, crushing her mouth and nose into the rag. Her legs drum
  wildly, and she fights with a strength she didn't know she had, a strength
  she didn't know wouldn't be enough. Her struggles begin to slow, and soon she
  goes limp. Shaking, I climb off her, turning her head to the side so she won't
  suffocate. And there she is, prostrate on the bed. Helpless to me. Ripe for
  the taking. No older than me, still a �minor.� Her round and firmly meaty ass
  braced against the bed. Her breasts splaying out to the side. Her unblemished
  skin still glowing from the shower. Her hair in a damp tangle above her head.
  There she is. And suddenly, I cannot move. 
I could leave right now. I could leave, and go have a normal life. Go back
  to school, find a nice girlfriend. I could have normal relationships, I know
  it. I can let this girl have the life she has dreamed for herself, worked hard
  for. I could let her be fully human, not subordinate to another's desires.
  And such base desires at that. My plan is to keep her for the summer, make
  her anew. Then, when I go back to school in the fall, either sell her or lease
  her, as a sex slave. Selling would be safer. Somewhere overseas, far away from
  anyone less capable than me, who would sell me out in an instant if they were
  busted. She'll never be asked to play cards. She'll never be asked what she
  would like for dinner. She'll never be asked an intellectual question. She'll
  never have a shoulder to cry on that was not the source of her tears. I could
  leave this insane and evil plan behind. I could die without shame. We could
  each live a normal life, with only one night of trauma between us. I sigh.
  But we won't. 
I check my watch. 1:58. I must have been standing there for a long time. Losing
  time. The chloroform will wear off in a few hours, so I need to work quickly.
  I hurriedly stuff my chloroform kit into my bag, and check outside. Anyone
  watching from windows will simply see the girl's boyfriend carrying her to
  a car, his face blurry in the dark. I rummage around in her closet and dress
  her in a set of sweats after drying her off. 
Five minutes later, she's lying in the backseat of the jeep with the rest
  of my abduction equipment. I snug my cap down on my head and turn the key in
  the ignition. Something makes me look at her. She looks asleep, the middle
  seat belt resting against her hip. There's still time to end this. I could
  put her up in her room and leave. Not really conscious of it, my hand has worked
  its way to the shifter, chunking it from park into drive. I turn back to the
  gloom of the dirt alley, and slowly roll away into our oblivion. 
Twenty minutes later, I'm at the base of the hill where I've made my den.
  I live on the outskirts of a decently sized city of 300,000, possibly yours.
  The city lies on a broad plain, with ocean blocking expansion on three sides
  and high mountains blocking the remaining route. There are roads traveling
  the coast on either side of the mountain range, and it is off of one of these
  that I live. My closest neighbor is at least a half a mile away, and everyone
  out here is too rich to give a fuck what their neighbors are up to or think.
  Just like me. I suppose some explanation is in order. My parents, who were
  always distantly supportive, are what you might have called �old money.� And
  they were, right up until that fateful Concord flight over Belgium. For two
  years now, I've been on my own and for one year, psychologists have bored me. 
Up, always up. That's how you get to my house. Finally, I can see the gate
  to my compound. I key the pad sitting ten feet away from the gate, and watch
  as the heavy iron spikes glide away into the reinforced cinderblock. A double-bend
  later, and there it is. A large house, two visible floors, with a commanding
  view of the sea and the mountains across the arm of the ocean . . . and a massive
  basement with sound-proofed walls. I carry her down to her new home � a small
  heated cell, unlit, with a mattress, pillow, and blankets set against the wall.
  I undress her and bind her hands and feet with the shackles bolted to the floor.
  She is starting to come out of the chloroform fog: all it will take is a sharp
  noise or movement. I stash some hydrogen peroxide in a squirt bottle in the
  corner of the room and leave quietly. Afterwards, I go into the adjacent room
  to get dressed. She will have to be broken before she can be mine, and there's
  no sense in wasting time. Black sweatpants and a black tee shirt are my standard
  casual attire for such things. I glance around the walls and settle on a red-leather
  whip; not my style, really, but it is a symbol of force and power, a weapon
  of fear. With a crash, I kick open the door to her room, and she bolts awake. 
�What do you want?� Her voice cracks with desperation. To her, I am but a
  silhouette outlined in the corridor. I don't reply, simply letting the coils
  of my whip fall to the floor. Her eyes follow the threat with widening horror. �Oh
  God, please just let me go. I promise I won't tell anyone!� Again, I say nothing,
  simply tighten my grip on the leather handle with a menacing creak. She starts
  to back up and notices her chains for the first time. Her mouth drops open,
  and then I speak in what I have been told is my surprising baritone. Timing
  is everything. 
�I have chosen you to be mine. You will not be found. You are to become my
  slave. You no longer have a name. Your name is Slave, just as mine is Master.� She
  stares at me in disbelief. 
�But . . . but you can't DO that!� I slide the tip of the whip closer to me
  and gather it in my whip-hand. 
�Because you are in my power, you will obey my every command without question,
  or you will be punished. You may, however, talk or scream as you like, unless
  I instruct you otherwi�� 
�Let me go! You can't do this to a person!� She interrupted me. Bad mistake,
  Slave. With the tip and hilt of the whip in my hand, I lash out a back-cut
  against her thigh. Her short scream is part surprise, part pain. She will learn.
  I strike her on the other thigh, up by her hip. Now her cries are more pain
  than surprise, starting higher and living longer. 
�And you will never . . . never, disrespect or embarrass me. Or you will have
  far graver consequences than temporary pain.� As I speak, she shudders and
  cries as red welts appear on her, one on each side. No matter, I will continue. 
�I can see that to be of any use to me, you will have to be broken first.� At
  the word �broken�, she begins to wail and sob, cringing away from me. She doesn't
  have any idea, but she soon will. 
�Understand,� I say less harshly, �that once you are broken and have submitted
  to my will, your life will go easier. You will not be wantonly beaten or mutilated.
  Your medical needs will be met. You will not become pregnant � I have had a
  supply of your birth control pills delivered to me.� 
�Please,� she sobs, �just let me go, just let me go. I promise I � I'll never
  tell anyone, ever. Just let me go home.� 
�You will never go home. The rest of your life will be lived out in servitude
  to me,� I say gently. Then my face becomes hard, cruel. �Your old life is gone,
  dead. I decide what your life is, now. And you will call me Master when you
  address me.� She manages only a frantic �No!� before my whip cracks into her
  side. She doubles over and begins to cry. 
�Your breaking begins now.� I throw the whip and my shirt into a corner and
  move to stand at her feet. Though her body tries to claw away, her eyes cannot
  escape mine. I push my knees between hers, forcing them apart so that they
  knock against my hips. She tries to fend me off with her hands, but the chains
  only go so far. Her hands strain a few inches from my face, grasping only air.
  I stare at her twisted face, tears streaming down from her eyes, her lips contorted
  in terror. She throws her hips from side to side under me, flailing her legs
  as though she was trying to swim. I grab a wrist in each of my hands, and tighten
  my grip until she cries out. Slowly, inexorably, I force them down to the floor. 
Her sobbing stops and she begins to breathe raggedly as I bring my face to
  within inches of hers. Her eyes are wide, as though the eyelids had been cut
  away; her pupils dilate and contract sporadically. A single small, infinitely
  pitiful sound escapes her throat, and then I kiss her. She squirms wildly,
  trying to throw off her rapist, but to no avail. I bite her lip sharply, and
  a note of pain escapes from her. 
I move down to her neck, pulsing and red, trailing cruel kisses as I inhale
  her scent. There are so few words to describe smells, yet so many for our poor
  eyes. I envy the wolf, so more knowledgeable than we in so many ways. I pause
  at her breasts, heaving rapidly and bouncing from her frenzied gaspings. 
No amount of pleading could have pleased me more than her first heart-felt
  scream as I bite into her nipple. I fill my mouth with her breast, gnaw on
  the flesh, leaving deep purple marks and bruises as I work my way over every
  square inch of skin. Her screams reach a new level of realized horror when
  I work my hand down to her clit and begin to rub fiercely. 
After a short time, she cannot help her body's responses. I know they are
  not hers � I know that she does not secretly enjoy this. It is simply representative
  of a body's desire to experience less pain. Many of our ancestors were rapists,
  and it did not become a woman to go unlubricated. It begins to flow from her
  fear-tightened pussy, and I jab in two of my fingers. Her screams are beginning
  to annoy me, and I leave her breast to anchor my mouth to hers. One breast
  lies untouched, while the other is sprinkled with purple punctures that slowly
  ooze bright red. 
I stop fingering her to slide down the front of my pants, revealing my blood-engorged
  erection. I rest the head at the entrance to what is essentially her virginity.
  I suddenly stop my movements, and raise myself to look her in the eye, one
  hand holding her wrists while the other holds her hair close to her head. Realization
  spreads across her face, and the tears begin to flow silently, her mouth forming
  a pleading and silent �No.� 
�I am the Master, and you are the Slave.� 
When I shove in, a shuddering wail goes through her, shaking her body as though
  her soul were leaving through her pores. I begin to slowly piston back and
  forth, moving my mouth down to her other breast to mirror the marks of it's
  twin. 
Her moist heat clings to me and draws my eyes to look down at my own swollen
  length, slapping against her unshaven lips and drawing panicked undulations
  from the gentle oval valley of her belly. Her delicate navel quivers beneath
  my coarse and hairy one, her outlined hips struggle to escape from the driving
  V that leads down between my legs, her soft flesh recoils from my hirsute strength
  and carapace-like abdominal muscles. Her womb screams as its defenses come
  to nothing. 
My cock begins to stiffen from wood to rock, and I feel my hips pick up speed
  as I near my first orgasm with my first slave. Hours of denial and suspense
  lend strength to my hips, and I begin to slam in and out of her, to my full
  length. Her screams, having died to sobs fifteen minutes earlier, rise to new
  levels of defilement. My wild thrusting lifts her hips off the mattress, and
  I grip her breasts for handles of pleasure and pain. My cock spurts and jumps
  deep within her as my beastly breathing roars to life in triumph over the life
  I have taken. I can feel the heat, the slickness of her, my long slow final
  thrust to her very depths, yet all without the inner grip that the pleasures
  of lovemaking bring. I stay inside her for a few long moments, listening to
  her muted moaning and weeping. Then I stand and pull myself into my pants,
  not bothering to cinch the drawstring. Remembering my stashing from earlier,
  I snatch up the bottle of hydrogen peroxide and douse her breasts and crotch
  with it. I grab my things with a single swipe of my arm and look at her, stare
  down as she lies on her side to gaze at the wall and shiver while she weeps
  and hugs herself. I draw two blankets over her, raise her head over her pillow. 
�Rest. You're going to need it. Tomorrow you will address me as Master, or
  you will be punished mercilessly.� She turns her tear-bright green eyes upon
  me, holding back her next sob. 
�Why? Why are you doing this?� I stare at her for only a few moments, the
  months of planning, the capture, the rape, the escaped opportunity for our
  separate lives running through my head. 
�Someday, you will understand.� I leave and close the door behind me with
  a soft click, silence greeting me savagely in the hall, following me up the
  stairs to my bed. As I pull the sheets up to my shoulder and turn on my side,
  I can't help but think. Then, perhaps, you could tell me. Sleep comes
  slowly.

I Am The Thorn
King, The Lord Of Brambles

Chapter Two

&nbsp;

����������� This orphanage is so small, and there are so
many children . . . how do they keep them all?�
Where are their parents, anyhow?�
Shouldn�t they care for their children, teach them?� I have only one friend here, and the other
children don�t like it.

����������� �Playing with dollies, he�s playing
with his dolly!�� I look at who they
scream of: Her.� My only friend.� And yet the demons tell me, through my own
private channel to Hell, that I should cast her down.

����������� She cries as I turn from her, and
cries louder as the fading sun reveals �my true form.�
My multitudes of spines and spikes, briars and bristles, �peaks and planes cascade down from my temples
to cover my poor deceived body, quivering from the sound of� my voice that rumbles in the air like distant
thunder:

����������� �I Am The Thorn King, The Lord Of
Brambles.�

&nbsp;

����������� Consciousness
comes gaspingly fast as I lie in bed on this cryptic, rainy morning. �I slide on a pair of shorts and cross my
bedroom to stare at the mountain amphitheater stretching away outside my
windows.� I turn away from the view to
enter my exercise room.

����������� Two hours,
a shower, and a quick breakfast later, I�m ready to begin with Slave.� Down there, in the dungeon, my fantasy will
come to dark life.� Brick by brick, hour
by secretive hour, I have constructed my lair.�
Through the door behind the fake wall in the pantry.� Down a flight of stairs.� A second door, then a short corridor of solid
cinderblock and heavy iron-bound oak doors, lit only by a few intentionally
dingy hanging lamps.� A supply room,
bathroom, and Slave�s quarters are the conventional parts of the dungeon, while
the Training and Torture Rooms wait at the far end of the hall.� It�s time for Slave to wake up.� Along the way, I change into my usual
training clothes, taking time to swipe up a thin bamboo cane and two of her
prescription birth control pills.� 

� ��������� I put my ear up to the door, and hear
some slight rustling.� It is good that
she hasn�t slept � she makes my coming job easier.� As I open the door and walk inside, her bloodshot,
puffy eyes whip around to me and she whimpers as she frantically tries to
conceal her nakedness.

����������� �Good
morning, Slave.� Today marks the
beginning of your training.� You may
respond to me by saying �Good morning, Master.��

����������� �Good �
mmmorning.�� I wait for a second more,
but her confusion is plain.

����������� �Wrong.�� I step forward and land the cane across the
small of her back.� She cries out, reflexively
reversing her body to hide her back against the wall.

����������� �Good morning,
Slave.�

����������� �Master!�
She shrieks.� Like a foil, my cane drops
under her guard to flick her from the middle of her sex to the red crease at
the top of her ass.� Her hips pitch forward
and she howls.

����������� �Good
morning, Slave.�� She recoils as her eyes
come up to mine.� I know what she�s
thinking � he�s crazy, what does he want?

����������� �Good��.morning�..Master.�� Her whispered acknowledgement, however
ill-done, is enough for the moment.� She
cringes immediately, and when the blow does not land, she only continues to stare
at me.

����������� �Get up.�� She is a little slow to comply, so as she
turns I crack her across the bottom crease of her ass, sending minute ripples
across the cheeks.� She yips at that, and
straightens her legs with more urgency.

����������� �Good,
Slave.� I like to see a little enthusiasm
from people.� Makes me feel even more in
control.� You do know that I�m in
control, don�t you?�

����������� �Yes.�� Annoyed, I grab her head with my other hand, turning
her eyes into mine.

����������� �Not
promising, Slave.� What do you do when
you address me?�

����������� �Master!�� She squeals pleasingly, so I release her and
she drops to the ground, shaking and panting.

����������� �Next time
you will address me properly.�

����������� �Yes . . .
Master!�� To avoid any messy cleanups, I
walk her to the bathroom to use the toilet.�
A few minutes later, she�s back in her cell. �I toss the pills to the floor in front of her,
slamming the door behind me on my way out, leaving her so that the anticipation
can gnaw at her.� It is a full thirty-six
hours before I return to the basement.

����������� I study my Torture
Room.� Cabinets hold most of my tools,
while others hang within easy reach of my hands and her eyes, upon the walls,
or on benches.� Finally, just for
theatrics, some pokers sit in an iron brazier of coals next to a pillar, and an
open iron maiden leans in the corner.� Today
will go hard on her, though not so hard as that.

����������� I force
myself to move slowly and deliberately � anticipation is at work on me as
well.� Stop that, I admonish myself, the
hands of the Master do not shake.�
With a quick glance, I decide on a wide leather belt with heavy iron
rings, three pairs of handcuffs, and the cane I started with.

����������� When I open
the door to Slave�s quarters, I can�t help but notice how filmy her lips are
and how dull her eyes look.� I toss the
belt and handcuffs to the floor from the doorway, a cane tucked under my arm.

����������� �You are to
attach one set of cuffs to your ankles, locking them together.� The belt will go around your waist, not your
hips.� Next, you will attach the other
handcuffs, one to each wrist, and then attach the other end of those cuffs to
the rings that will be at the sides of your belt.� If you accomplish this by the time I get
back, I will you give you something to eat and drink.� If you do not, you will receive a beating
instead.�� Her eyes widen as she goes
still, staring at my retiring shadow.� 

����������� I want her
to be conscious, but not able to gain her strength back.� As well, I could do without having her puke
in large volumes, should she choose to.� Upstairs,
I scoop up a large handful of macadamia nuts, a birth control pill, and a glass
of water, and return.

����������� She�s managed
to do it.� I come over to her side and
kneel beside her.� She looks at me only
momentarily before studying the floor between her stretched-out legs.

����������� �Open your
mouth � I�m going to feed you.��
Tentatively at first, then greedily, she sucks down half the water
before I take it away.� Her mouth parts
slightly, matching the slackness in her eyes.�
I feed her the nuts, knowing that their dense fat calories will keep her
going for some time, if she can keep them down.�
I show her the pill, and she looks more than a little relieved.� I place it in her mouth and give her the rest
of the water.� After I haul her to the
bathroom and back, I leave her once again, with instructions to be waiting on
her feet when I return.� I require time
to collect myself, though I don�t tell her.

����������� Once in my
study, I spend some time reviewing ideas, memorizing diagrams.� I am only a Master in the making, and
relatively inexperienced.� However, I
also have practically all the time in the world.� Convenient, considering that if I don�t take
my time with this, I�ll botch the whole thing.�
I have to succeed, because this is my one chance.� I can�t risk another abduction. In my
opinion, Masters are tied to their Slaves, as attached to them as any normal
person can be to any other major investment. 

����������� However,
some aren�t really Masters, in my view.�
They are Ghouls, devouring their thralls with recklessness and
child-gone-wrong insouciance, wanton cruelty pushing them to subject their prey
to heinous tortures.� Even death doesn�t
stop the torment at times.� I know a
powerful few; people that I must tolerate within my circle of contacts because
they are critical to myself or the group, for now.� Frowning at the thought, I take time to go
over my Art of War, as well as my Machiavelli.��
�� 

����������� A short
time later, nightfall has come, and I go to check on Slave.� She bolts up to her feet from where she had
been dozing in a squat against the wall.

����������� �No,
please, you have to understand!�

����������� �It�s
alright, Slave.� You were technically on
your feet when I came in.�� At her look
of relief, I know that I am beginning to win � she seeks my praise, because she
knows that it staves off torment.

����������� �However,
you did not call me Master.�� 

����������� I walk over
to her, casually, a smile on my face.�
This is an unknown to her, and she recoils from me.� I slap her hard across the breasts once, watching
her cry out and collide with the floor.�
I haul her up by her hair, listening to the screeching and cursing begin
anew.� I drag her to where she was before
I slapped her, glaring at her.

����������� �If you
shrink from me again, you will be punished.�
You must be obedient to me, which means that you do nothing without my
command.� If I wish you to run from me so
that I may have the pleasure of chasing and raping you, then you shall do
so.� If I wish you to cower before me,
then you will cower.� My wish is your
command.� But never,� I say as I place my
forefinger and thumb on her nipple, �never think that your punishments,
tortures, or servitude will stop simply because you�ve had enough.� Kneel.��
I clamp down on her small, pink nipple and twist sharply, forcing her to
the ground.

����������� �Lean back
and hold on to your heels.� Thrust your
chest up.�� She rushes to it, albeit
awkwardly because of the handcuffs.

����������� �Now.....don�t
move.�� I draw my hand back and slap her
left breast, heaving it into her other mound with a rippling thwack.� My strike has opened one of my bite-marks
from our first night.� I backhand her
right breast straight down, the smack of my knuckles loud against the firm
softness.� She yelps at each.� After five slaps apiece, I stop.� She raises her head, her lips quivering and
her breath coming in snot-clogged sobs.� I
hoist her up by the belt, and shove her into the corridor.

����������� In the
flickering shafts of light in the corridor, I see how battered her body
is.� Her hair is a complete tangled,
frizzy mess.�� Her eyes are a ruinous
shade of red, crusted from her tears.�
Her breasts look mauled; bruises, indented teeth marks, encrusted blood,
nipples beaten to the shade of roses left for dead in a dry vase.� They must be killing her � I�ll have to
address that soon, but first she will be introduced to the Torture Room.

����������� �And now,
Slave, a limited tour of your new home.� On
one side you have the support rooms � supplies, necessities, and the like.� On the other, you have the Training Room,
which you will get to know quite well, I assure you.� It�s the largest one, by the way.� �She seems troubled, or is at least showing
something besides fear and confusion.

����������� �Permission
to speak granted, Slave.�

����������� �What....what
is that room, at the end, with that little iron-barred window?�

����������� �That,� I
reply, �is the Torture Room.�� Her scream
echoes and amplifies in the corridor too fast for me to think beyond the shock
and pain, forcing me to reflexively cover my ears.

����������� She lurches
from my grasp, stumbling away.� I reach
out to her, and narrowly dodge a knee meant for my groin.� She leaps for the door, but I�m faster and
flank her in the last few feet.� I hammer
her once in the stomach, crumpling her over my shoulder.� Like a sack, I carry her into the room.� I listen to the creak of the heavy iron
hinge-pins, the wail of my prize, the rushing blood in my ears, the whistling
slam of the door behind us, the bestial dark of the room we stand in, and as I
listen I feel myself harden beyond my control.

����������� I set her
on her feet, pinning her arms to her sides with my own. �I turn on the lights, and she takes it all in
within a few horrible seconds.� She
slumps forward, and it�s only my arm that prevents her from collapsing to the
floor.� Her head lolls to the side, and I
realize that she has fainted.� She�s made
of fear.� Perfect.

����������� I carry her
to one of my wooden stock variations and set her down.� It�s set close to a wall under one of the ubiquitous
multi-purpose bracket/pulleys set into the stone.� Quickly, I dig through the chest in the corner
and come up with some rope and various other restraints, dumping them to one
side.� I open the stocks and Slave�s
handcuffs, then shove her with my foot, bringing her around.

����������� �Get up and
put your head and hands into the gaps.��
She whimpers, but does as she�s told.�
I close and lock the stocks, then strap her feet together and tie the
strap to the frame of the stocks.� She
shifts her feet slightly, feeling the slight give in the binding.� I tie a rope to the loops in her belt, at the
sides and in the small of her back.� She
seems worried at this, but then becomes noticeably more agitated once I secure
the rope to the support system and begin to raise her exposed lower body higher
and higher.� Eventually, she stands on
the very pads of her feet, her toes close together and her ass high.� Her succulent breasts hang down, swinging
slightly.� I tie off the rope � no give
in this one.

����������� I can see
the reproachful look of her sex, the way the lips puff out; angry and purple in
their defiant pain from last night�s rape.�
I can also see the damage done to her breasts.� If I don�t do something soon, she might become
infected.

����������� �Slave.� Look at me,� I bark.� Slowly, hesitatingly, she looks up at me from
the corner of her eye.� I continue more
calmly.� 

����������� �Slave, I
must break you before you can be mine, seeking to please me unconditionally.� I must push you beyond your psychological
limits to the brink of your physical limits.�
However, as I said before, I will attend to your medical needs if I deem
it necessary.� Once you trust me with
this responsibility, I will never ask you again, for you will have given away your
ability to choose.� I should point out
that at the moment, your breasts and vaginal area are of particular concern.�

����������� �You�re
fucking batshit crazy!� That�s �
OW!�� I present the removed pubic hairs for
her inspection.� My quirked eyebrow seems
to speak to her.� She breathes deeply.

����������� �Master.� May I speak, Master?�

����������� �Yes.�

����������� �Master,
this is not fair!�

����������� �That
is none of our concern.� Now
choose.�� The seconds crawl by as she
bites her lip and a bare number of tears roll down her face.

����������� �Yes,
Master, please attend to my wounds, master.�

����������� �Very
well.�� I rummage in the supply room, and
in a short time I return to my prettily arranged beauty.

����������� �Remember,
you are mine.� Say it.�� I soak my rag.

����������� �I am
yours, Master,� comes the hoarse, shaky voice.

����������� �Good.�� With that, I rub the dripping rag all over
her breasts, drenching them in rubbing alcohol.�
Her gasping, choked screams and violently bouncing breasts send chills
down my spine � yet when I grind the rag high between her thighs, I nearly cum
from the thumping jerks of her ankles, the hysterical bucking of her ass.� By the end, she has torn some clumps of wispy
hair from the nape of her neck in her frantic efforts to escape.

����������� �Now you
are at no risk of infection,� I sigh.�
Her face remains flushed, her breathing shallow and fast.� I pluck a slim-handled leather whip from one
of the wall fixtures, the pommel flared yet with a smooth, unridged contour.� I place the base of the whip around her bound
ankles, and begin to draw my way along her body with it.� The whip swirls around her like a lustful
snake, each inch following the one in front of it, coldly tasting her
skin.� She shudders from the moment it
touches her.

����������� �This is a
whip, Slave.� Leather.� Do you know what I�m going to do with it?�� Silence.

����������� �No need to
answer, Slave; it was a rhetorical question.��
Her body whole body pulses red as she screams her frustration and fear:

����������� �Why!?� Why are you doing these things to me?� Why do you punish me even when I�ve done
everything you�ve asked?�� 

����������� �Why,
Slave?� Because I wish to, that�s why!� I get pleasure from it!� I need no other reasons.� Now, I was planning on giving you just a few
lashes.� However, you failed to address
me properly.� Several times.� That adds, Slave.� How much?�
I�m not sure.� But we�ll see.�� She�s trying to cry, but she�s all out of
fluid.� Christ, finally, I think.�
I�ve been trying to get her to do that for a while now.� Now she will go without fluid for a little
longer so that she may be further broken down.

����������� �Prepare to
receive your punishment, Slave.� If at
any time you wish it to stop after twelve lashes, just say the word.�� Taking her dumb silence for attention, I go
on.� �The phrase that will stop your
punishment after twelve lashes is �Master, please fuck me.�� As with your capitulation to my medical
ministrations, this phrase will forever take away your ability to choose.� The same rules apply, naturally.�� She seems to withdraw into herself in shock,
and I allow her the silence to contemplate this new change.� Suddenly, I am struck by the urge not to rush
the process: I have worked hard for just this sort of moment.� With a feeling of pride, I stare at my
captive.� My Slave.

����������� Her
well-defined muscles show the influence of years of volleyball, weight
training, aerobics, Pilates, and track stardom.�
Her feet are fine-boned, delicately arched, the way a painter�s foot
would look if feet were as talented as hands.�
Her ankles are graceful � separate pieces working in unison under one
skin.� Her smooth, inverted oval stomach
drains my eyes. �Her narrow waist and defined
ribcage make the size of her hips and ass even more dramatic and breathtaking.� Her breasts are larger than I first
suspected; a full C cup without any stretch of the mind, yearning for
attention.

����������� Her neck
isn�t one of those long, graceful ones, but neither is it fleshy or ugly.� Still, it does well to compliment the coy
beauty of her clavicle.� Her face and
back are almost totally clear, with some small traces of the scarring acne left
over from her teenage years so recently left behind.

����������� She won�t look me in the eyes now,
but I can see them just the same.� Green
like an unripe carrot, like the blush of spring.� Her hair is a wild mane in this light.� Layers rustle over layers, the look seeming
like a rich dark brown with undertones of strong red wine.� Her nose has a good strength to it, as well.� She looks vaguely Mediterranean with a touch
of Old Europe, or perhaps Arcadian, one of those women who bewitch with their
looks as much as their spells.� She is
the quintessential exotic, with just enough European mutt to bind the parts
together like a mortar of diversity.� A Gypsy.

����������� Her skin,
where it has not met my attention, is warm and soft, with a slight hazelnut or
almond hue, almond like the shape of her eyes.�
I reach out and touch it, not believing it to be real.� My hand glides to hold one cheek of her
ass.� Here my attention stays for a long
time, marveling at its lush and firm substance.�
The divine isthmus between her finely muscled back and full, swooping siren
hips and ass captivates me.� The dimples
on either side of her tailbone invite me to press my thumbs in, press while my
hands would grip the firm anchors of her hips in the sweet battle.� The meat of her ass, hips and thighs glow
with firm health, abundantly endowed beyond most men�s taste or mettle.� This is a haunch to be savored with
unrelenting ardor and vigor, in as many ways as are known.� The small of her back has a lovely way of
seeming to dip in, a gentle valley between the hills of her ass and the rounded
plain of her sweet back.� The whole
expanse, from the two ribbons of muscle coming down on either side of her
spine, to the flare and rounding of her hips, to the swell of her ass, all
remind me of a polished mandolin.� Pride
over my choice of captives fills me, and I have barely begun my survey of her
tapered yet heartily muscled legs when a sniffle from her breaks my reverie.

����������� �Are you
ready, Slave?�

����������� �Master,
please, don�t do this.�

����������� �One.�� Though I do not put my strength into the
blow, the damage done is most pleasing.�
A long, scrawling red welt appears across her lovely ass.� The crack of the whip still lingers in the
air like a match leaves a smell after it is struck.� She has gone silent, starting to put up some
of her mental defenses.� She�s set on not
crying out.

����������� �Two.�� I can see the whip wrap around her thighs and
lash her across the back of one of her knees; it buckles, such as it can.� 

����������� �Three.�� Part of my lash has landed where the first
stroke hit; blood wells up from the forming blister. �She jerks and flinches, but holds her ground.� 

����������� �Four.�� It lands, and she stifles a yelp.

����������� �Five.�� A sob.

����������� �Six.�� This one barely touches, but to much
affect.� It opens a four-inch long minor
cut across the upper divide between her ass cheeks.� Blood begins to ooze down her crack, soaked
up by her neatly trimmed bush.� I don�t
give her time to react, though.

����������� �Seven.�� She�s screaming at me to stop now, pleading,
begging.

����������� �Eight,�
and �Nine,� scrawl across her legs.

����������� �GOD,
PLEASE!�� She�s thrashing in her straps
now, sending her breasts and ass into chaos, her hair into medusan locks, her
neck bruising on the wood.

����������� �I am not
God.� I am Master.� Ten.�� This
one, a vertical slash, barely misses that so-vulnerable crease between her
thighs and cheeks.� Instead, it lances
across so many other welts, raising them higher or bursting them.

����������� �Eleven.�� The leather tongue seems to drag from cheek
to cheek.

����������� �Never.....NEVER!
FUCK YOU, ASSHOLE!�� I deliver two more,
this time across her back and shoulders, the X forming in less time than it
took me to conceive it.

����������� �And that
makes thirteen.� Now for fourteen.�

����������� �You said
it would stop after twelve!�

����������� �No, I
didn�t.� Think hard about what I said.� Fourteen.��
This time, I put my hip, arm, and wrist into it.� It lands with ripping force across her ass in
a diagonal line.� Her hips try to surge
forward and away, but the restraints do their job.� She sucks air for a long second, then
unleashes a shuddering wail that carries over into the next strike. ��������� 

����������� �Fifteen.�� More power, lashing the from her thigh up to
her hip.� Her hips, comes the voice from below my waist.� Her shoulders sag totally, throwing her ass
even higher.

����������� �Sixteen.�� A vicious explosion at the very tip of her
tailbone.� She�s in a state of shock now,
but for some reason I�m not allowing her the time to make the decision she must
make.� Though I do not will it, I say the
word: �Seventeen,� and see it scourge her on the plateau above her ass.� Somewhere inside me, something has gone wrong
� I�m getting out of control.� As my arm
goes back for the next, I hear her groan the tearful words I�ve been longing to
hear, but the beast doesn�t want to listen.�
This is the dangerous crossroads � will I allow this dark side of the
moon to take over, to turn me into a Ghoul?�
Time � I need to buy time for her.�
Time for myself.� 

����������� �Louder,
Slave.�

����������� �Master,
please fuck me.�

����������� �Louder!� Know what you say!�� I can feel the whip lowering, growing
heavier.

����������� �Master,
please . . . Fuck . . .�

����������� �Yes?������������ ���� 

����������� �ME!�

����������� Consciousness
returns, and with it, self-control.� 

����������� Yes, but now what?� I look at the marks on her, and know that
the time will come when I will have to mend her.� But for now, it�s all I can do to hold myself
back from wasting the moment.� Her skin
looks so pale against the welted highlights.

����������� �Very well,
Slave.� However, I want to move you.�� She has begun to realize her new role.� It�s there, in the set of her shoulder and
neck.� Rather, a lack thereof.� The new pliancy of surrender in her
muscles.� In the calm she now
exhibits.� A pain-filled calm, to be
sure, but a calm nonetheless.� Just then,
an idea occurs to me.� 

����������� �And,
Slave, I must do something with this whip while I untie you.�� I spread her quaking cheeks slightly (Oh, Christ, stay focused!) and lick the
handle of the whip liberally.� She perks
up at the sound and the touch, but I doubt she knows what�s coming.

����������� �Slave, I
want you to hold this until I tell you not to.�
If you do not, you will be punished again.�� As I speak, I stuff the handle of the whip
deep into her sex.� A shudder and hiss
escape her, and I see her ass quiver a little.

����������� �Remember.� Hold onto it until I tell you to.� If you manage to hold onto it, I will later
give you a pain medication and tend to your hurts after it has taken effect.�� I see her head move slightly at this despite
the strain and the pain, and I know that it is a powerful card to play.� I�m sure she also knows that she is being
trained.� Just as she knows that she is
powerless to stop it.

����������� In measured
steps, neither hurrying my pace to make her task easier nor slowing it to make
her stumble in her mission, I extract her from my arrangement.� Finally, she stands up.� Perhaps a little too quickly, though, and she
staggers into my arms immediately after.�
With my hands on her spine and sides, I can feel the muscle spasms
leaping frantically under her skin and see her legs cramp up completely.� She can�t help being here, I know.� She grimaces at my shoulder.� I stare at her hair.� She stares at the floor, and I stare at the way
she doesn�t clench her hands, now in the cuffs attached to her
waist-girdle.� When she shoots a
frightened but anxious look up at me, I remember that she�s still holding onto
the whip.

����������� Taking her
by the shoulder, I lead her over to a long table with built-in wrist and ankle straps.� The table is polished hardwood, devoid of any
possibility of splinters.� The cuffs and
segments can be angled or moved to any distance, either in tandem or
individually; one of my �supplier�s� better ideas.� Time to break it in.

����������� Slave
stands next to me, her legs crossed and her face showing a great effort.� The handle is more than halfway out, and
slipping gradually.� I can see the panic
creep into her mind, her chest heaving with frantic oxygen.

����������� �Thank you,
Slave, that�s enough,� I murmur and reach over to grasp the whip handle.� She sighs as the full weight of the handle
comes under my control.� Following a
hunch, I push it back up into her.� To my
genuine surprise, it slides in right up to my fingers with ease.� She blushes furiously while I contemplate
this new development.� 

����������� Ah, of course.� That
close, grinding, rolling walk from the wall to the table......that had to have
done something.� After tossing the
whip to the floor, I pick her up by the waist and hoist her onto the
table.� For a few seconds, she holds my
stare unwillingly, like a rabbit into a flashlight.� Then she glances down between her clenched
thighs, to the patch of dark hair peeking up.

����������� �Lie down
with your head off the edge of the table and looking up, Slave.�� She moves gingerly, trying not to bump her
smarting skin on anything. �I unlock one
of her wrists, only to bind it into the strap that I�ve set near her head.� The other side gets the same treatment.� Observing the way she lies, I adjust the
ankle straps and secure her legs open and with a slight bend to her knees.� I turn a crank that adjusts the tilt of the
whole table.� As I walk back to her head,
I can see her eyes follow me.� Now, her
body is very slightly declined in relation to her head.� Perfect height.� I open a drawer built into the table, and select
a pair of nipple clamps along with a handful of clothespins.

����������� I walk over
to her legs, chancing to look down the length of her body as she raises her
head to look at me.� She�s shaking.� I can feel myself smile as I clip first one,
then the other lip.� Her sounds are
delicious.� 

����������� I reflect
that it�s as good a time as any and disrobe, feeling myself, hot and swollen,
snap up to hit me in the stomach before settling down slightly.� I slide my pants the rest of the way off,
relishing her groans.

����������� �Take them
off!� she pleads loudly.� I laugh, though
I doubt that she would get or appreciate the joke she just inadvertently
made.� Still chuckling quietly, I go back
to my work on her, ignoring her and her jerking body.� Or at least, try to ignore the latter.� I can�t get her to be still enough to apply
any of the pins.� With a growl of annoyance
an disgust, I slap her now-open sex powerfully and listen to her howl.

����������� �Remember,
Slave, there can always be more pain, more discomfort, more everything.�� She keeps going, like a child throwing a
tantrum.� So I let her throw it, but not
without a little ongoing reprimand.� I
continue the pussy-spanking, letting her be as bratty as she wants.� She gets louder and louder for a minute, and
then I think she gets the point.� She
bites back her wild yelling and restricts herself to jolts when I slap her.

����������� I go back
to administering my clothespins, and she studies the wall, biting her lip and
flinching each time I apply a new one.�
When I run out, I take up my nipple clamps and walk around to her head
to apply them.

����������� �Anything
to say, Slave?�� As I allow the first
nipple clamp to snap shut, I can see her groan travel all the way from the
clothespins to the nipple clamps.

����������� �Master, I
thought you said you were going to fuck me!�
You didn�t say anything about more torture!�

����������� �In good
time, Slave.� Besides, I only said that I
wanted you to say �Master, please fuck me.��
Never said anything about what I�d actually do.� Don�t be so linear.�� She begins to cry again � single, salty
crocodile tears rolling down her forehead.�
Some of her clothespins have come loose, and I reapply them.� More whimpering.

����������� �Don�t make
a sound beyond breathing now, Slave.�
Otherwise, face the whip.�

����������� I stand up,
straddling her neck, curiously feeling the heartbeat on her neck through my
cock.� I kiss her areola wetly, making my
mouth an O, drawing my tongue across, painting the O in completely.� I feel the heat of her blush against my
thighs.� When I have all that I can in my
mouth, I suck slightly and slowly begin to pull away from her, lightly dragging
my teeth along and licking strongly, constantly.� At her areola I pucker my mouth, sucking her
wetly, teasing her hard nipple with the tip of my tongue.� I suck harder, then lighter at the last,
letting her nipple almost plop out of my mouth before plunging back down
tongue-first.� She gasps; she will tell
herself that it is because of the pain.�
I tell myself it is because of pleasure.�
Only her body really knows.� In
our moment of pain/ecstasy, I snap the jaws of the clamp closed.� She writhes in a vacuum of sound.

����������� �Excellent,
Slave.� You are released from your
imposed silence.�� She looks at me with
revulsion, fear, pain, and an undeniable subservience.

����������� �Master,
may I please have some water?�

����������� �Well,� I
reply, �since you asked so nicely.�� With
that, I ratchet the table to where her head is slightly above the rest of her
body, and leave the room to get some water.�
I stalk to the supply room, shivering as much from her continued mews of
pain as my nakedness in the chill of the dungeon.� I take one of the water squirt-bottles and bring
it to the sink.� Waiting for it to fill,
I absently glance around the room, and discover matches and some lighter fluid.

����������� What the hell, I think; we don�t have to
be cold for this.� Maybe she�ll
appreciate the warmth from the brazier.�
Besides, it�s difficult to have a good hard-on when it�s such a cold,
damp dungeon.� I put them in a bag and
head back to the room.

����������� I drop the
bag at the base of the charcoal-filled brazier, thinking proudly of the good
ventilation in the room from the vents overhead.� She�ll enjoy the heat, since it�s only some
seven feet away.� I come up to her �
she�s so fuckable, pleading silently with her mouth open.� I squirt a few ounces in, which she swallows
quickly, only to open her mouth for more.

����������� �Don�t
think so, Slave � you�ll have to earn more, just like you earned that bit.�� She stares at me incredulously for a moment,
then closes her eyes and tries not to cry.�
I turn back to the brazier and unzip the bag.� I douse the charcoal in some lighter fluid,
and flick a lit match in.� 

����������� Screeches
of unholy strength jolt me from behind so badly that I almost pitch into the
flames.� Wide-eyed, I turn.� 

����������� She�s
bucking on the table, bouncing the four-hundred-pound monstrosity like a damn
ball.� She looks like a crack addict,
screaming at levels I hadn�t managed to elicit from her with any of my cruelties.� She�s possessed and electrified at the same
time, thrashing in her bonds so hard that I can only pray none have broken yet.

����������� What the FUCK is going on?� In one moment, it hits me.� The fire . . .the pokers ��. . . she thinks I�m going to burn her.

����������� �Slave!� Stop!��
I leap on top of her chest to grab her head, still unsure of what to
do.� Now I have the tiger by the tail.� I slap her across the face, enough to knock
her down had she been standing.� Still
nothing.� Shit, that never works.� For
the moment, she has the strength of a berserker, and if she breaks loose,
she�ll overpower me.� 

����������� The fire, get to the fire, idiot!� I leap off her and snatch up the water
bottle, pulling the stop out with my teeth.�
In my desperation, it pulls out completely, and I look for all the world
like a stark naked Civil War rifleman.� Only
after the flames are out do I dare a look over my shoulder at Slave.� She immediately stops, and simply stares at
me for a moment in complete silence and stillness.� Then, like a breaking dam, she begins to cry
piteously, hopelessly.� She probably
thinks she�s going to be punished.� Even
if I were capable of it right now, I doubt I would anyway.� Obviously, what had happened had been beyond
her control.� 

����������� Catatonic,
I slump against the cool stone of the pillar next to me.� The steaming brazier.� The sobbing girl.� Myself.�
I look down.� On top of it all, my
erection is gone.� Still somewhat
stunned, I turn my head and spit the nipple of the water bottle away, hear it
clatter against the wall.� Fucking
perfect.� Still, she can�t see me like
this.� I rally and push myself off the
pillar.� Heart, head, and lungs pounding,
I trudge the few steps over to the table, newly relocated half a foot further
from the brazier.� I stop and stare at
her for a long while, simply breathing deeply until I�m back to normal.� However, I doubt I look normal at the
moment.� I probably look more like a
psychopath.

����������� �Slave.....What
in God�s name do you THINK you�re doing?�
And you had better damn well call me Master, or else I�m just going to
blow your head off, dump you in an incinerator, and be done with it.�� Her lip quivers as she looks at me.� It�s a long silence.

����������� �Master,
please, I�m sorry,� she whispers hoarsely.

����������� � . . . Go
on.�

����������� �Master � �

����������� �Slave.�

����������� �I thought
you were going to burn me with those pokers, Master.�

����������� �I�m not
going to, you know.� Ever.�� At this, she sobs anew.

����������� �Let me
explain, Slave.� But first, just shut the
fuck up for a bit.�

����������� �A-alright....Master.�� 

����������� �In
essence, I find such things as mutilation, branding, and the like, to be
particularly vile.�� I�m silent for a
little while, lost in thought as I stare at one of the stretch marks on the
flesh between her thigh and her ass.

����������� �Master,
may I ask you a question?�

����������� �Sure,
Slave.�� For some reason, the marks are
endearing.

����������� �Why?�

����������� �Why?� Because I�m not that damn sick.� Hypocritical, I know.� But there it is.�� 

����������� And I don�t have the stomach for it.

����������� �Anyway,� I
say as we both regain eye contact, �you have my absolute word that I will never
personally do such to you, nor will I allow anyone else to do so.�

����������� �Thank
you....Master.�

����������� �Now, if
you think you can keep relatively quiet for a bit, Slave, I�m going to get some
warmth in this place.�

����������� �Whatever
you wish, Master.�� . . . Interesting
response.

����������� I turn back
to the doused coals and dump them into the waste bin, then refill the brazier
with some more from a nearby concealed bag.�
Soon, the place begins to warm up from the fire.� Returning to Slave, I ratchet her back to
where her head is below her body, first removing the clothespins attached to
her nether lips.� The nipple clamps stay,
to her dismay.� Then, after digging
through yet another cupboard in the wall, I return with a five-inch vibrator/clit
stimulator and lube.

����������� �This is
for holding the whip,� I dryly comment as I squirt the lube all over her
sex.� Then, to groans of Whatever I begin
to massage her. It�s far easier to train humans than other animals, actually.� Practically, not ethically, I mean.� The adult human mind does not require instant
gratification, though that works best. �

����������� Slowly at
first, then noticeably, she relaxes under my hands.� Massage classes do help.� The release of tension becomes audible in the
room, heard above the crackling of the coals.�
I stop to turn the vibrator on.�
The hum of imitative life is loud.�
Then, using one hand to spread her, I shove the transparent, hard,
plastic dick into the hungry mouth. 

����������� I walk over
to her head and stare down into her eyes.�
After a few minutes, I hear her grunt and as I look to her hips, I can
see her attempting to adjust herself uncomfortably.� There�s a slightly congested look in her
eyes.� Then, finally, she gasps and I put
the tip of my cock in her mouth.

����������� �Suck,
because your life depends on it.�� She makes
a small noise, then slowly explores my uncut tip with her tongue.� She�s not terribly experienced; I can
tell.� However, I can also sense that she
has vast potential . . . vast. ��I
can feel my hardness return and move to the back of her throat.� I thrust slightly forward, but quickly remove
myself as she starts to thrash around.

����������� �Slave,
calm down.�

����������� �But
Master, I�ll choke!�

����������� �Only if
you panic.� I will not let you choke, but
you must not panic, no matter what happens.�
I will know when you�ve had enough. . . trust me.�� I slap her roughly across the face � �Open.�
� and start to pump her mouth with shallow strokes.� 

����������� �Suck on it
more, and don�t be shy about spit or noise.��
She obeys, and I can feel her bring me further into her mouth, her full
lips dragging and lingering along my shaft.�
Her slopping, burbling sounds only heighten my excitement, and I thrust
deeper.

����������� The
vibrator is doing its work � I can see her moving her hips into it, hear and
feel her petite groans wrapping around my cock.�
Gradually, I lengthen the time between her breaks for air.� Eventually, I thrust deep and stay
there.� For the first few seconds, she is
passive.� Soon, though, she starts to
struggle.� I pull out and listen to her
gasp. �She catches a few breaths before I
stroke back in, deeper still.

����������� �Don�t
move, Slave.� You won�t be hurt.� Just calm down and relax and you�ll be better
off.�� I fuck her throat smoothly for a
long time, and I can see she�s starting to suffer from her lack of oxygen.� Finally, she deep-throats me.� As she does, I pinch her nose shut.� She doesn�t move � only her throat spasms,
and I can see where my lump is through her skin.� Ten seconds, and I pull out a few inches and
release her nose, listening to her frantically suck air and fight back her gag
reflex.� Quickly but without shoving
hard, I stuff her again with my cock, pinching her nose when I�m deep.� 

����������� She�s
frantically humping air, fucking the vibrator.�
I pull out and release, listening to her gag before I thrust back in.� My hips start to heave back and forth.� I feel my balls slap her face, feel her throat
spasm as she tries to breathe.� I can see
her eyes lose focus, and with a few final balls-deep thrusts, I cum deep in her
throat.� She retches, but nothing except
what I just gave her comes up, so I push it back down.� At last, I pull out.� Panting, she grinds her hips up, hunting the
plastic cock.� Her scream crescendos,
then falls to grunting, the buzz of the vibrator in the background.� At last, her head thunks into the wood
underneath.� She gapes at the ceiling, frozen
in her shock, shame, and denial.� I
remove the device, kissing her deeply once I lick away her hot tears.

����������� �Very good,
Slave.� We�re done for today.�� Gently, I release her and help her sit up to
the edge of the rack, and give her a bottle of water.� She didn�t return my kiss.

����������� �Wait here,
and try to sip the water so you don�t get sick.�� She nods mutely and nurses at the water.� I walk over to a cabinet and rummage around
for the medical kit.� I place it beside
her and pull out the rubbing alcohol and a cotton swab.� She looks at me, her chin starting to quiver at
the sight of the rubbing alcohol.

����������� �It�s not
like that, Slave,� I softly reassure her.�
She only stops when I take hold of her wrist to swab a small part of her
forearm with a soaked piece of cotton.� I
reach back into the kit and pull out a green-glass syringe:

����������� �I promised
you a drug for the pain, didn�t I? �Now
give me your arm.� Soon, you won�t feel a
thing.�� She starts sobbing with huge
shudders of her shoulders, burying her face in her hands.

����������� �Goddamnit,
Slave, what is it now?�

����������� �You�re
going to kill me with that and dump me in an incinerator!�

����������� �Ugh.� This is morphine, Slave.� Morphine.�
Slave, have I lied to you yet?�
No.� I will never lie to you.� I may not say everything that I mean, but I
will never lie to you.� You shall always
have that dignity.�� She stares at me,
dumbfounded.� I squirt out the minute air-bubbles
and heft her arm.� Suddenly, she lays her
hand over mine.� I�m not prepared for
this, and I stare at her, at a loss.� Her
eyelashes are so long, so dark.

����������� �Promise,
Master?� she rasps, her voice nearly gone.

����������� �Yes, Slave
. . . I promise.�� I place her hand back in
her lap.� 

����������� �Master,
may I ask you a question?�� The
frightened look is back in her eyes.

����������� �Of
course.�� Christ, I picked up a talker . . . maybe that�s why I did, though.

����������� �How long
am I going to be here?�

����������� I feel my
eyes narrow, and I give her the shot.�
She begins to fade, exhaustion and comfort coursing through her
body.� She goes limp, collapsing off the
table into my arms.� Her eyelids flutter,
but her eyes still stare at me.� With a
sigh, I pick her up and start upstairs.�
In my arms, she whimpers and groans.

����������� �What was
that, Slave?�� Her answer is slow in
coming, slurred, and from an obviously unconscious person, but it comes
nonetheless. �Her first real step, all on
her own.� The beginning of the beginning.

����������� �What may I
do, Master?�

I Am The Thorn
King, The Lord Of Brambles

Chapter Three

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

����������� What am-are I-You?� I am the slave made of crag, yet I am the stone
and rock, yet I am the sculptor-David-masterPIECE-Michelangelo.� Two objects in the world of the mind and
Socrates and Pythagoras that runs perpendicular to the world of Yeats and
Beckett and Einstein, cannot have the same name.� So why do we have the same name?� Why is there even a �we?�� Go fuck yourself.� But what about me?� You�ll get your turn, supplied by the second
rule: though two objects cannot have the same name, it is certainly possible
that one object can two names.� Oh,
that�s nice, yes.....oh, yes, do that AGAIN.�
Ah, but there�s a third rule.�
What?� What are you talking
about?� Leave me alo-oohhhhhgoddontstopnothethird
RULE.� The third rule states that an
object can exist without a name.

&nbsp;

����������� It�s three in the morning, and
my dreams keep waking me up.� I roll out
of bed and stumble to the bathroom, plunking the toilet lid back and seating
myself.� I could see if I wanted to in
the black of the tiled room, but I keep my eyelids clenched, hoping to cram the
leaking sleepiness back behind them.

����������� And what the hell was all that about,
anyway?��������� 

����������� I shouldn�t talk to myself like that
� it just encourages them.� The dreams, I
mean.

����������� You talk to yourself� because you�re lonely.� You know that, don�t you?

����������� Damn.

����������� Slave�s
been asleep since she had dinner, around seven.�
That�s already eight hours, but she�s still somewhat in recovery.� She wasn�t in as bad a shape after those
first few days of her training as I thought, but that still meant that she
needed about a week to heal.� Fine � it
was time that was needed to touch her mind more deeply than her body.� One week in solitary confinement.� 

����������� The first
day, she was essentially unconscious.�
For the second, she was awake and mobile, so I slid in her meals and
replaced the chemical toilet while she slept.�
By the fifth day, she tried to stay awake to simply catch a glimpse of
me.� She awoke as I closed the door too
loudly on my way out. �I saw the crash of
her body against the door, heard her hoarsely try to shout to me.� She was being driven to the brink of her
sanity from isolation.� Yesterday, I came
into her cell to find her crying and rocking in the corner.� The moment she realized I was in the room,
she threw herself on my leg, silently refusing to let go.� I shucked her off my leg, gave her the meal,
and left.� Tenuous at best.� ��

����������� I crawl
back into bed, my mind made up.� I can�t
afford to actually have her go crazy, so it�s time. �Let the breaking end, and the training begin.� I roll over to catch up on sleep.

����������� 

����������� I stand in
front of Slave�s door in blue sweatpants and a green tee-shirt, my bare feet
cold against the stone.� It�s seven in
the morning.� I turn the key in the lock,
and walk in to see her bolt awake from her cot.�
Her lips part slightly, her eyes are wide and cautious.

����������� �It�s seven
A.M., Slave.� Good morning.� You may greet me by saying �Good morning,
Master.��

����������� �Good
morning, Master!�� She dissolves into
coughing, overcome by her abused vocal chords.

����������� �Excellent,
Slave.� You remembered.� Now, just to be fair, I�m going to review
rules with you.�� She hugs herself and
waits.

����������� �First, I
am your Master, and you are my Slave.�
You will comply with my every command immediately, and you will
ultimately obey only me.� Second, you
shall call me Master, and I will call you Slave.� Third, you may use your voice as you
wish.� Fourth, you will actively try to
please me, and never question the methods in which I gain my pleasure.� Fifth, if I am displeased with you for any
reason, it is my decision to mete out punishment as I see fit.� Sixth, my word is law.� Should anything I command you to do conflict
with these rules, obey the command.� You
must always obey my commands.�

����������� She looks
stunned, and small wonder.� To have the
rest of your life laid out in six rules.�
I slap the side of my leg, watch her as she flinches defensively.

����������� �Now,
Slave, I give you a choice.� Either come
here, kneel before me, and pledge yourself to me and my rules, or be left in
here to rot.�� I can feel the cold sweat
trickle down the back of my neck.� Doubt
and despair scrape up my spine, halting in the skin and jerking out, over and
over again.� Seconds howl by me.� I cannot give her a second chance � she would
see me as weak, and would force me to obliterate her by the punishment I would
have to give.� If I�ve miscalculated . .
.� she can�t withstand more of this.� It takes everything I have to maintain an
imperious, yet neutral facade.� If she
refuses, if she defies me, if she calls my non-bluff, I will have to dispose of
her; dispose of her and start anew and risk discovery again.� Slowly, stiffly, she crawls before me.

����������� �Master,
please,� she rasps, �I accept.� Please,
Master, please, don�t leave me.� Please.� Please.�
Please.�� She trails off into a
whispering sob, her head shaking back and forth.

����������� �Very � � I
strain through my humbled voice, then recover, �Very good, Slave.�� I cup her chin in my left hand, turning her
trembling eyes up to mine, newly steeled.

����������� �Let�s get you
cleaned up, Slave.� Been a while, hasn�t
it?�� She only continues to quiver.� I smile at her.

����������� �Hasn�t it?
. . .�� Nothing.

����������� �When in
doubt, Slave, just say �Yes, Master.��

����������� �Y-yes,
Master.�

����������� �Good.� Now go use the toilet.� We�ve got a busy day.�� She goes to the chemical toilet I placed in
the corner.� When she is done, she comes
to stand before me.

����������� I offer her
my hand, and she places her own cupped fingers in mine.� I lead her out into the corridor, heading
towards the bathroom area.� Somewhere in
the fifty feet between her cell and where I�m leading her, her smell, covering
her body for the last week, races straight from my nose to my loins, pulling as
much blood with it as it can.� 

����������� I can feel
the darkness begin to throb, to awake, to let loose its jaws.� I whirl to Slave, grabbing her throat,
forcing her to the wall with a deep growl.�
She�s panting in total fear, clenching my unyielding wrist with both
hands. �I roar, lust exploding from me as
terror implodes her.

����������� �On your knees!�
�She looses a sob as she hurries to the
floor, and then holds motionless as I hunch over her head to grab her hair,
bringing it to my face, inhaling the musk until I can do no more.� I hunger for the next breath, my exhale bestial,
my inhale slow and deep, to the bottom of my lungs.� I kneel next to her on the floor, smelling
her, learning her, understanding her.�
Smelling through the fear and despair, to the secret smell.� The smell that is Her.� She does not reek of fear anymore, her heart
not the life-fear-beat.� Now it is the
predator-is-near beat.� Barely slower.

����������� I smell her
as though I were reading a book, paragraphs and pages rippling in the draft of
my breath.� The acrid odor of her
armpits.� The shiny, salty smell of her
shoulder blades.� The taste of pain in
her mouth.� The cool and smooth scent of
downy-blonde hairs on the nape of her neck that mixes with her stale sweat.� The flesh heaven between her breasts.� The rivers of her hip bones that lead to the
sea between her legs � I am gone.

����������� �Stand up,
Slave,� I growl as I whip my clothes away from my body.� I barely wait for her to be on her feet
before I grab her leg under the knee and pull it up to my chest.� She gasps and automatically puts her hands on
my shoulders, her mouth wide.

����������� �Lower
yourself and pray that you�re ready.��
Without hesitation, she shoves two fingers in her mouth and places a gob
of spit and phlegm inside herself as she slides down the wall and slightly
forward, offering her ripe sex to me.�
She barely has the time to get her fingers out of the way before I rush
into her.

����������� Almost.� I get an inch or two inside before meeting
dry resistance.� Still six more to
go.� I pump and weave just inside her
lips, and soon feel them swell in defeat.�
The tears are streaming down her face, where I can see it through her
hair.� I stroke deeper.� Halfway now, and the going is smooth.� Soon after, I�m slamming in and out of her,
pummeling her hole.� She lets out cries
of pain with each thrust, tight as she is.�
With one hand on the wall, I can feel and see the veins slugging along
to my tempo.� I bury my face in her neck,
the place with the most distinct smell of all.�
Harder.� Deeper.� Stronger.�
Louder.� Faster.� 

����������� It doesn�t
take more than eight or ten minutes.� A last,
roaring frenzy.� Pumping, slurping,
sucking.� Her high-pitched sobs, the
slapping sound of her high, full, firm ass against the harshly cut stone.� I pull away, and watch the cum slip out of
her.� All I can hear is our ragged
breathing.� Easily fixed.� I grab one of her nipples and pull until
she�s squealing on her tiptoes.

����������� �Time for
that shower, slave.� I suggest you keep
up.�� She nods as fast as she can, still
squealing.� I stride quickly to the room,
keeping her tit in the air and nothing but her toes on the ground.� She struggles to keep up, but manages not to
fall.� 

����������� We have
arrived in the cavernous bathroom.� It
has a vague �L� shape to it, with the door leading into it at the top end.� The whole room is tiled a dark, polished red.� I had this room built first out of all of
them, as I didn�t want to take the time to lay all that tile and set up
plumbing.� Thus, I had to have it be the
first part of the dungeon built so as not to raise suspicions.� A toilet sits in the open against one wall, a
simple necessity.� Further down and
across from it is a set of three adjustable showerheads built into the
wall.� A long hose extension is coiled on
a hook beneath each, with controls for heat and flow farther along the
wall.� The shower system is greatly
enhanced by the rig of pulleys and stainless steel chains that I installed in
the ceiling, and a drain in the depressed center of the floor.� Around the corner is a small pool, empty for
the moment. ��

&nbsp;

����������� I pull even
higher and give her a sharp twist of my wrist and fingers, sending her
careening into a higher octave.� At last,
I let go and grab her head to face the tiled wall.

����������� �Stand with
your legs a little more than shoulder-width apart and your hands clasped behind
your back, palms out, Slave.� Head level,
eyes ahead.� This is �Stand.�� I may also cue this to you with a raised
upward palm.� Remember it.�� I walk to the far end of the room and wheel
back a workbench full of waterproof tools.�
I pick up a spreader bar with ankle cuffs, and a pair of handcuffs.� I crank down some of the chains hidden in the
ceiling recesses.� I cuff Slave�s hands
over her head, attaching them to the chain just over her head, and hobble her
with the spreader bar.� Now she�s ready
for her cleaning.� For me, preparation is
the best way to ensure success.

����������� I turn the
water on, and she shrieks at how cold it is, twisting as it hits her in the
face and breasts from three angles.� She
splutters, choking on the water until she has the sense to bow her head.� She tries to dance around, but the chains and
the bar limit her movement severely.�
Gradually, the water heats up to a pleasantly hot temperature.� With the door closed like it is, the room
will soon be filled with a warm steam � damp, dark, hot � we stand deep inside
her sticky, harshly fucked sex.� She
relaxes, and as I turn to check some adjustments to the chains, I can feel her
eyes upon me.� 

����������� This man of
average stature, of pale skin, of sharp words, of soft footfalls, of sure
balance, of dark heart.� He is your
Master.� Look well.� Know the dread muscles that shift under his
skin like dunes of sand blown by a dervish wind. �Know the coarse gunpowder hair upon his body.� Please the brute arbiter between his
legs.� Remember the vicious power that
courses through his body, his raging arms, his unrelenting torso, his swift and
sturdy legs, his barbaric shoulders, and his cruel hands.� Fear the mind that you yet know nothing of,
save that it has taken your life from you, and feeds on your pain.

����������� I look at
her, and she whips her gaze back to the wall.�
After rummaging around a bit, I pad over to her, a pair of sandals in
each hand.

����������� �I�ll be
bathing with you, Slave, as always.�
These are so we don�t slip and have something unfortunate happen.� Lift your foot.�� I put the gripping sandals on her feet,
though I have to help her a bit with the weight of the bar.� She�s still very weak.� I can feel the warm spatter from the shower
starting to drench me, trickling down my back and legs.� I stand in front of her, fully soaked, water
rolling off of me, carrying the tension of serious training with it.� I cup one of her breasts and slowly rub it,
appreciating the unique sensations of touch for each part of it.� I glance over her shoulder to the back of the
room, noting how it is beginning to fill with steam.� I let go, and help her stand more in the
center of the three streams, re-positioning them to hit every major part of her
body.� I pull up a bottle of shampoo,
keeping my place in front of her as my hands work behind her.

����������� I pour a
liberal amount into my hands and work it into a lather with my hands behind her
body to shield them from the spray.�
Then, slowly, I start to work it into the tips of her hair, rubbing
deep.� She remains silent, though we are
only inches apart.� I look at her
bloodshot eyes and see pliant beauty there.�
She stares ahead, over my shoulder.�
Such obedience . . . I can feel myself grow hard enough to rest in the V
of her legs.� My hands wander somewhat
from their purpose, grabbing a cheek of her ass now and then.� Her long hair takes some time, but the
tangles start to come out, and by the time I come to her scalp, it feels sleek.

����������� �Alright,
Slave, lean forward to rinse.�� I step
slightly to one side and watch her move to catch the water in her hair.� I help her as before, sweeping the shampoo
away and down her face to the floor, flowing back behind us to the drain in the
center.� The steam now fills the room like
so much gray, opaque light.

����������� Next comes
the conditioner, same as before, except this time I stand behind her to get a
better angle, for her and myself.

����������� �Stick your
ass out, Slave.�� She complies, and I
grin at the supreme view.� I can�t
resist, and stick the first inch or two into her, letting it sit there.� I can see her back shudder a little bit, and
her hips twitch slightly, finding a more comfortable way to hold herself.� Her hair gleams under my hands, and I end by
putting my hand on the back of her head, gently forcing it over and down.� The water cascades down, but her hair still
needs to be rubbed for the full effect.�
I push forward further, sinking into her, thinking about how much it
must disturb her to be wet enough inside for the little trick to work.� She must also be puzzled at how I decline to
actually fuck her, content with being inside her as I help her with her salon.� Her breath catches a little when I flex my
cock in a long, swelling kegel, stretching her.�
Once she feels rinsed, I pull on her hair to get her to stand up,
releasing myself of her sheath.

����������� Now for the
body.� I pull her out of the direct
stream and command her to stand up straight, and then walk over to the rack of hose
attachments, selecting a soft scrubber.�
I squeeze a liberal amount of body soap into the head, and turn the flow
to a trickle before beginning to cover her skin.� She inhales sharply as the head pushes
through the top of her muscular ass to vigorously scrub her from crack to
clit.� Finished with that, I rinse her
down, and select a new shower-head.�
Approximately eight inches in length and five or six inches around, it�s
a respectable cylinder.� The slightly
bulbous head, with fine, rounded ports coming down from the first three inches
of the tip spray water in every direction.�
I pour soap all over the cylinder, and put Slave�s head far down.� She must expect what is coming next, and she
bucks, evading my capturing hand.� Can�t
have any of that.

����������� �I told
you, Slave � you have to obey me immediately.�
Now pay for it.�� Her head whips
around as I grab a paddle from the tool cart.�
The whistle of air through the holes in the paddle alone could make me
smile.� But that crack as it strikes
flesh can only be described as gleeful satisfaction.� At the first one, she grunts, but hard on its
heels is a scream as my second, harder swing lands almost directly on top of
the first, right across her ass.� The force
of it pitches her forward into her chains, keeping her from falling to the
floor.� Now she�s really trying to evade
it, but it avails her nothing.� My swats
fall all over her legs and cheeks.� On
the seventh swing, she cries out.

����������� �Master,
please, I�m sorry!� Master, please
stop!�� I don�t bother to stop my swings,
but I still answer her over her yelping and crying.

����������� �Remember.� Because you are my Slave, you will obey my
every command immediately.�� I swat her a
little harder than before, and watch her cheeks start to really glow.� Droplets of water flee from the path of my
swing.

����������� �Remember.� Your punishments are mine to administer, both
start and stop.� You, your pain, your
pleasure, your body, your will �� I finish with a two-handed wallop and listen
to her jolted scream and sob � �All are mine to control and do with as I
please.� Now keep crying as long as you
need to.� The sound of it makes me hard,
knowing that I wanted it to happen.�� I
drop the paddle to the floor with a clunk and clatter, and pick up the
cylinder, first washing all but the faintest trace of slippery soap from
it.� Every time she sobs, my dick swells
and the head flares with a kind of hunger.

����������� �So.� The paddle was punishment for disobeying my
command.� I still have to punish you for
asking me to stop.� For that, you will
take this without lubrication.� Now bend
over, idiot.� I�m disappointed with you
right now, and that is not a good place for you to be.�� Not that I expected anything different from
her � but the verbal abuse helps to break her down further.� She will feel more accomplished when I treat
her well if I rough her up verbally first.�
However, I must not make my insults of the trashy, gutter variety:
�Bitch.�� �Whore.�� �Slut.��
No.� These must be personal
attacks on those aspects of herself which she has held dear in the past.� Just now, her intelligence has been called
into question, and the feigned disgust on my face reinforces it.� I can tell this is the case when she looks at
me, and stops crying about the pain.� Now,
tears well up because of her imposed stupidity.

����������� �Did I say
you could look at me?�� She hardly makes
a noise before I cut her off.

����������� �Shut
up!� You�ve lost talking privileges for
the day!� And stop looking at me with
that stupid, bovine look on your face.� I
promise you, Slave, if you don�t show some spark of aptitude soon, I�m going to
rid myself of you.� Now bend over like
the cow you seem to want to be!��
Unsurprisingly, she does, stifling sobs.�
She�s shaking, and as soon as I come around behind her, I�m shaking as
well.

����������� I push the
tip of the head of the showerhead in without any water on � it goes pretty
easily.� The rest of the shaft is another
story.� By only the second inch, she
tightens up and the shaft stops going in.�
She�s in for a real treat, if this is it.� I grab her shoulder with my left hand and
take a death-grip on the base of the dildo with my right, and begin an
inexorable, slow shove.� She screams �
oh, how she screams.� But every time she
gets truly too tight, I stop where I am and ream her with it until some kind of
lubrication shows up.� Halfway in.

����������� �Get used
to this, Slave.� You�ll be taking truly
massive dildos in time.�� My helpful
advice doesn�t seem to be appreciated, and she wails in dismay and pain � then
goes into a silent sort of crying when I work another inch and a half in.� Now we�re reaching the end of the usable part
of the dildo � only about two inches left to go in.� I screw it the rest of the way, twisting it
to the right over and over again.� Her
voice lilts, but not in a scream.� More
an operatic intake of breath.

����������� I turn the
faucet on with my free hand, keeping a hold on the shower-dildo.� The warm water starts to flow into her, and
she squeals and dances in place, water and cum and fluid and a little pinkish
liquid all flowing down her thighs.�
After a minute or so, she starts to shudder and breathe like a horse
after a race.� Deep, coughing pants that
start in her withers and go all the way up through her nose.� That�s when I start altering the temperature
quickly, but not over a very wide range.�
Hotter, colder, colder still, back to hot.� Her eyes roll and her knees go weak, short
screams bursting out every now and then.

����������� Gradually,
I turn the faucet off and watch her go limp.�
She sighs with exhaustion as the dildo comes out, and I take a good look
at the raw hole.� I stand, turn the
shower off, and hoist her to a standing position.� She won�t look me in the eye, and sniffles
beautifully.� I unlock her, throw her a
towel, and start to dry myself off.

����������� �Now, Slave
� you�re all clean.� The question is,
what could we possibly do that wouldn�t get you dirty, would please me, and
wouldn�t tax that little cow brain of yours, eh?�� She is silent, and stares away with a mix of
despair and hate.� Good, that comment got
to her.

����������� �Stand.�� She follows the command, and waits.

����������� �Think you
could handle the beginning of your training, Slave?�

����������� �Yes,
Master.�

����������� �Good.� First, you will Heel on the way to the
training room, understood?�

����������� �Yes,
Master.� Like a dog?�

����������� �Yes and
no, Slave.� You will crawl on the floor
on your hands and knees, and you will be one step behind me and to my
right.� But a dog?� No.� A
dog I would have respect for at this point.�
You aren�t worth that, yet.�� She
fights the tears, but they come anyway.

����������� �Heel, Slave.�

����������� She does,
and we start to make our way to the Training Room.� I stop before we enter the room, and turn to
her.

����������� �Rise to a
squat or kneeling position, Slave.� Show
me that you can suck me well.�� She looks
at my thighs and hanging member as she rises.�
Then, slowly, she takes my cock in hand and starts to jerk slowly,
lapping at my balls.

����������� I lean my
head back and take in the experience: a gorgeous woman, my gorgeous woman,
doing her best to suck me off simply because I ordered it.� Amazing.�
I can feel my erection grow, and her full lips and mouth slide and tease
their way over it.� I look at her again.

����������� �Look up,
Slave.�� Her eyes fix themselves onto
mine, her hand caresses me, her mouth adores me.� All faked, for now.� All mine, forever.

����������� �You do
have potential, Slave.� But you need to
let go of your past life to be treated well, to live.� I have faith in your potential and mine.� With time, you shall be great, and we shall
do great things together.�� Tears roll
down her cheeks, and she gags and chokes a little.

����������� �Be sure to
look up when you suck, Slave.�� She looks
up, and I stare straight down at her.

����������� �One day,
you will make me proud, and you will revel in it, and you will thank me.�� She sucks harder for a second, and then goes
back to being mediocre.� Slowly, surely,
I shall win.
