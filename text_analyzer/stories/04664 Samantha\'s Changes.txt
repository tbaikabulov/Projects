Synopsis: Samantha learns to respect authoruty






Sam walked into Mr. Davidson�s class expecting it to be just another day. Sam expected to go into class and tease her teacher relentlessly like she did every other day.   Sam was a pretty girl. She was 16 with a larger bust than most girls her age and a curvy ass. She also had a tiny waist and naturally golden blonde hair. All the guys, including her teachers, wished to be intimate with her. For them though all she would be was a trophy.  At one time Sam had been a very shy girl, but then she was raped and became very sexual. She wanted to tease all men by showing them her body but not giving it out. Mr. Davidson was a nice guy. He was younger than most teachers. He was only about 23 years old. He was also sexy with his dark hair, eyes the color of smoldering coals, and muscular body. Mr. Davidson had been sucked into Sam�s guy trap, but he didn�t intend on staying there. Sam acted the way she did to cover the fact that she was really afraid of men. Nobody at school had any idea what happened to her except the teachers. Sam felt vulnerable because of her beauty. She knew that she was eye candy for guys. She absolutely hated that fact. It wasn�t fair that people thought that they could take advantage of her simply because she was a beautiful woman. One of Sam�s downfalls was that she basked in the glory of her beauty. She loved to show off how beautiful her body was. She liked to wear short skirts and skimpy tops. She was just the kind of girl that guys knew they could take advantage of. 
Mr. Davidson did not blame Sam for wanting to get back at men because she was raped, but he also knew that she was one of those girls who were asking for it. He also knew that by messing with him she had made a horrible mistake. He was not going to be played like a fiddle by anyone. He may have slipped into her trap in a momentary lapse of judgment but he certainly did not intend to let her get by with trying to seduce him. He thought of her with no more respect than he would think of a common hooker with. To him she had no more class than a common hooker. In his opinion she needed to pay for her sins. Sam was a rich bitch that thought that she could get by with anything she wanted to just because of how much money her daddy had in his bank account, but she was going to soon find out that Mr. Davidson didn�t care how much money her daddy had. 
�Samantha could you please come here for a second?� called Mr. Davidson as soon as she entered the classroom. Sam looked at him in surprise because no one ever used her whole name it just wasn�t something that happened. She decided to ignore him because to her Samantha was not her name. Mr. Davidson was quickly losing his patience with her, but he wasn�t going to give her the satisfaction of angering him. He decided to ignore her insolence. He just greeted all of the other students as they walked in. Sam thought that she had won, but she was not expecting what he did when the ball rang. �Samantha you are failing my class. Please see me at the end of class to see what you can do to bring up your grade. Oh and that skirt is too short so I�m going to write you up for dressing like a SLUT,� announced Mr. Davidson after the bell had rang and he�d silenced the class in order to start class. Sam could not believe that he would announce that she was failing in front of the entire class. Her friends looked at her and couldn�t help but laugh. Even her friends knew that she was a bitch and thought that she had deserved what she got. Mr. Davidson knew that she was going to be stupid and not stay after class so he added, �If you choose not to stay after class Samantha I will be forced to report your insolence and your dressing issues to both the principal and your parents.� Sam knew that she had to stay after class because the principal hated her and her parents would ground her forever if he told them. She also knew that he wasn�t bluffing either. He had threatened to call her parents once before and he had done it. 
Mr. Davidson did not like being the mean teacher but he had to be to get through to Sam. She was hard headed, selfish, and extremely spoiled. He knew that her parents never disciplined her. He knew that she treated her parents like dirt. He also knew that her father�s company was not doing very well. Samantha sat through the entire class worried about what Mr. Davidson was going to do to her. She had no idea what he had in mind to help her pull her grade up, but she thought that she might have a slight idea. The thought was not a good one. When the bell rang and all the other students were running out to get to their next class or talk to their boy friends in the hall way Sam was sitting in her desk waiting for the classroom to empty out. When it finally had she walked up to Mr. Davidson�s desk. At first he acted as though he had forgotten all about her. He was reading a book and her pride would not allow her to announce her presence. Finally when the bell rang announcing that she was late for her Chemistry class he decided to notice her. �Ah Ms. LeGree I am glad to see that you decided to stay. I would have hated to have had to call your parents. I am afraid however that you will most likely still have to see the principal as I have inadvertently made you late for your next class. What do you have next?� said Mr. Davidson.
�Well not that it�s any of your fucking business, but I have Chemistry next you asshole!� screamed Sam. 
�Well, well, well. Maybe a call to your parents is still necessary as you seem to have a bit of a problem with controlling your mouth, but your foul language does not affect me in the least. I could care less if you screamed every cuss word in the books at the top of your lungs. However, you will be written up for calling me an asshole. You see hon you are putting your life at this school in my hands by acting the way you do. I don�t give a flying fuck about you. You could fall off the planet and I would be one of the happiest men alive. Who gives a damn if you were raped? It doesn�t make you any different than any other girl, but what does make you different is that you think you can get by with whatever you want just because your daddy has money. Well let me tell you something I don�t care about your daddy�s money honey I have plenty of my own so you can forget about paying me for my silence. So why do you think you are failing my class?� replied Mr. Davidson quietly. He was not the kind of man that liked to scream. He was actually a very quiet man by nature. Sam just seemed to bring out the worst in him. She was such a bitch that no matter how hard he tried he just could not like her. She was rude and inconsiderate. He figured with some discipline in her life she might be able to become a respectable young lady, and with that idea his plan was set in stone. 
�I think I�m failing your class because you don�t like me. You�re a cruel man who wishes to hold me back. I have dreams you know,� she sobbed miserably. Nobody had ever treated Sam this way. She was used to getting whatever she wanted on a silver platter. .
�Samantha you are an intelligent young woman. You have the ability to do well, but you are so wrapped up in your perfect little world that you don�t think it is necessary for you to put forth any effort. Your father will not always be there to support you. One day you will be out on your own and you will have to support yourself. I know that you are going to say that you have a trust fund. Well let me tell you something so do I.. I also have all of my father�s estate money because he died, but I also work for a living. One day you will grow up and realize that it is not your daddy�s job to support you any more. Samantha my sister sponged off my father until the day he died and he left his entire estate to me because he knew that it would be in good hands. My sister was furious when she found out because that meant that she would have to find some way to support herself. My sister had messed around in school and barely made it out of high school and never went to college because she assumed that she would always have my father�s money, but now she no longer has it. I help her out a little, but I also make her help herself. If I were to give her enough money so that she could live lavishly she would waste it and not support herself. Samantha you know why you are failing my class now I am going to ask you one more time: Why are you failing my class?� replied Mr. Davidson.
�Why do I give a fuck about your sister? You see unlike her I have no siblings with a stick up their ass to steal my father�s estate. It�s all mine when the old fucker finally passes away. I can�t wait until that day,� screams Sam. However, right in the middle of her monologue the principal and her parents came into the room. Her parents looked furious and the principal looked overly joyous.  
�Well Mr. Davidson I am glad to see that you are with the little skipper. Her Chemistry teacher buzzed me and said she wasn�t in class apparently she misses a lot of days in that class so I called her parents. A student informed us that you asked her to stay after class. We decided to see if she was with you,� said Ms. Stevens, the principal. 
�Why did you ask her to stay after class?� asked Mr. LeGree.
�Well you see Mr. LeGree your daughter is failing my class. I asked her to stay after class to see what I could do to help her pull up her grade. She said that she didn�t care about school because all of your estate money was going to her. Well I think an education is of the utmost importance so I told her about my sister who thought the same thing and didn�t get a dime out of my father�s estate,� replied Mr. Davidson calmly. 
�Well I�m sorry to break it to you this way Sam, but there will be no estate. I lost my job, and because of your excessive spending habits have no money saved up. We are going to have to sell the house and cars. You see my company has been going down hill so we had to mortgage the house and now we have lost everything. You are going to have to get a job,� replied Mr. LeGree.
�Samantha I think that it is time for you to come with me to my office, so that I can deal with your inappropriate dress and your mouth and you skipping Chemistry,� interjected Ms. Stevens. Once Ms. Stevens and Sam left the room Mrs. LeGree started crying. She was fed up with Samantha. She and her husband had just had her ordered incompetent. 
�Can you help us Mr. Davidson? She has become such a burden. We just can�t handle her any more. We have had her ordered incompetent, but we honestly don�t know what else to do,� cried Mrs. LeGree.
�I think that I can help you if you are willing to do it on my terms. Mr. LeGree I know that you are in a financial bind. I just happen to have happened upon a large sum of money lately. My father died and left me his estate. I could give you say $100,000 and in return you could have Samantha live with me until she gets an education equivalent to a doctorates degree. How does that sound?� replied Mr. Davidson. The LeGrees� had no idea what Mr. Davidson had said except that he would give them $100,000 and take Sam off their hands. 
�That sounds like a great idea. We will do whatever you like.  Sam is all yours once the check clears the bank,� replies Mr. LeGree.  
�Well it is not exactly that easy. We have to deal with some legal mumbo jumbo, but because you have had her ordered incompetent it will make it a hundred times easier. I will talk to my lawyer and have the legal papers drawn up tonight and we can meet later on tonight and you can read them. Then tomorrow you can sign them and I can give you your money, and I can have Samantha move in with me. Of course this action will include giving up your parental rights and handing them over to me. You will no longer have any say as to what happens to Samantha. Can you agree to that?� replies Mr. Davidson.
�Yes we are willing to agree to anything. We have been looking for a way to get rid of Samantha for a very long time. She is such a burden. She treats us like shit. We just didn�t know where to turn or what to do. We�re so glad you�re here to help us,� replied Mr. LeGree. Mr. Davidson knew that Mr. LeGree only cared about the money. He knew that at that moment in time Mr. LeGree was willing to do anything for money. Including sell his own daughter. Mr. LeGree was anxious to get any money that he could to keep him and his wife afloat. He loved his daughter deeply, but he was a strong believer in every man for himself. He knew that one day Sam would understand that he had to do this. 

2 Years Later

�Samantha will you please come here?� requested Mr. Davidson. Samantha walked over to Mr. Davidson slowly with her hands behind her back and her head lowered. 
�Yes, Mr. Davidson,� said Samantha quietly once she had arrived in front of him. She still did not raise her head nor did she remove her hands from their position behind her back. 
�I just got off the phone with your �parents� and they wish me to allow them to explain to you why they did what they did. Do you wish to hear why they did what they did?� said Mr. Davidson.
�No sir,� replied Samantha.
�Why, may I ask, do you not wish to hear the reason they did this to you my dear?� asked Mr. Davidson. He was quite surprised by her answer. At first she had asked repeatedly to know why her parents would do such a thing to her. Now when she had the opportunity to find out why she refuses.
�I do not wish to know sir because I now understand the situation I put upon them. I now understand what a burden I was to them. I put them in a desperate situation which caused them to take drastic measures. My father is a man who heavily believes in every man for himself,� replies Samantha.
�Are you saying that you forgive your parents for what they did?� asked Mr. Davidson. Samantha knew that this was a test. He had taught her that she must forgive all, especially those that took drastic measures because of her own actions, but she also knew that lying to Mr. Davidson was not an option. Either way she was most likely in trouble.
�No sir. I cannot forgive my parents for what they did to me. A parent�s love for their child is supposed to be unconditional, and they put conditions on their love of me. I know that the way I acted was wrong but their reaction to my actions is an unforgivable act. How could they sell their only daughter? I am their flesh and blood and they treated me like an old piece of furniture that they no longer wished to use,� replied Samantha scornfully. Mr. Davidson was infuriated by her response, and she could tell it from the look on his face. She was afraid of what was to come. Mr. Davidson was a kind man, but he was a disciplinarian. 
�Samantha, are you unhappy?� asked Mr. Davidson.
�No sir,� replied Samantha.
�Then why do you not forgive your parents? Also I am quite sure that I have told you over and over again that you are supposed to be forgiving especially to those who took drastic measures because of your atrocious behavior,� replied Mr. Davidson.
�Please sir I honestly try to be forgiving towards them, but I just can�t,� replied Samantha.
�Are you willing to accept a punishment over this act of defiance?� asked Mr. Davidson.
�Yes sir. If you find it necessary to punish me in order to try and correct this problem then yes by all means I accept, but I can tell you that it is not going to make me feel any differently about this,� replied Samantha. She was not trying to be defiant all she was trying to do was get Mr. Davidson to understand how she felt about this subject. She really did try to forgive her parents, but she simply could not bring herself to do it. In her heart and mind what they did to her was an unforgivable. She knew that she was infuriating Mr. Davidson by being defiant, but she was not willing to forgive her parents for anything.
�You really can�t forgive them, can you? Do you know one of the reasons my sister was so furious when she didn�t get a dime when our father died? It�s because he was not my real dad. My mom and dad had been separated for a while and my mom was of course dating other men and being intimate with them. Well one of those affairs was with my father. My father was a well- to- do man that caught my mother�s eye. She instantly fell for him. They started dating and having sex. He tried to get my mother to leave her husband for good, but she wasn�t willing to do it. Even though they weren�t getting along well she still loved him. Well my father became furious with her and broke up with her. She found out 2 weeks after they broke up that she was pregnant with me. She went crawling back to my �father� and he took her back. She never had the heart to tell my real father that he had a son. My �father� took me under his wing. Even if I was not his biological son he still loved me. Sometimes I think that he loved me more because I was not his biological son. My �father� was odd like that. Nobody ever understood him except for me, and I was shocked when he left everything to me,� replied Mr. Davidson. Half way through his monologue Samantha had broken into tears and sank to her knees. He had helped her forgive her parents without even knowing it. He had not been trying to change her mind, but he had succeeded in doing so. 
�I forgive them,� she said quietly. He looked at her with the utmost respect. He knew that it had taken all she had to forgive them, and he didn�t blame her. 
�Will you see them then?� asked Mr. Davidson. He was hoping that she would say yes.
�Do I have to?� asked Samantha. Her response actually surprised him. She saw his look soften. He motioned for her to come closer. Normally she might have been afraid or hesitated, but this time she just crawled forward until he motioned for her to stop which was when she was directly in front of his chair. Her head was lowered and her eyes glued to the ground. She didn�t dare look him in the face without permission. What he did next surprised her. He grabbed her chin and made her look him in the eyes. 
�Samantha, right now, I have more respect for you than I have had for anyone in my entire life. You have been very courageous in forgiving your parents. When my mother told me the truth about my father I was furious at her for lying to me for so long and I never forgave her. When she told me the truth she tore out part of my heart and I have never been able to regain that piece. When someone does or says something to you that eats at your very core it takes a while to heal and in some cases you may never heal completely. Your parents wronged you severely and yet you have found it in your heart to forgive them and for that you deserve my utmost respect. I am also glad that you were willing to risk a punishment for what you believe in. I don�t want you to be a doormat. You are a very intelligent young woman and I respect that. If you do not wish to see your parents I will not force you to do so, but I think it would be beneficial to you if you did see them and heard what they had to say,� Mr. Davidson said quietly. He did not want to force her into anything that she did not want to do. 
�Mr. Davidson I will see them, but I would like to ask you about something if I may?� replied Samantha. He still held her chin in his hand as he did not want her to look at the floor. 
�I am glad you have decided to see them. You may ask me anything you wish,� replied Mr. Davidson. He was wondering what she was going to ask him. She had just graduated high school and had just turned 18. 
�Well as you know sir I just turned 18, and like any other 18 year old girl I have an interest in sex. What am I to do about sex while I am with you? Will you be providing that as well?� asked Samantha. She hated that he still held her chin because she did not want to look him in the eye while she asked him that. Mr. Davidson was quite taken aback by her blunt question. He noticed how red she had turned and laughed out loud. He immediately regretted that because when he did tears sprung up in her eyes. 
�I�m sorry. It�s just I�ve never been asked so bluntly about sex before. Do you want me to have sex with you or do you just want sex?� replied Mr. Davidson. He expected that she only wanted sex.
�I want you to have sex with me sir. The only other time I�ve had sex was when I was raped. I trust you sir and hope that you would not hurt me the way he did. I know that you think of me as an immature teenage girl who is only looking for sex, but that�s not true. My entire life I�ve been a trophy. I don�t want to be a trophy anymore I want to be in a relationship where the other person actually cares for me. I guess that you feel about me that way. I�m not sure. When I first came to you I expected that you were going to rape me. I never expected you to turn out to be the man you turned out to be. I know that when I came to you I was a shallow, self- absorbed bitch, and I am sorry for that. I never realized just how badly I actually treated everyone. At that point in time I blamed everybody for what happened to me. Now I realize that I was asking for it. You don�t know what it�s like to be a pretty girl. Everyone wants a piece of you, but you don�t want a piece of everybody,� replied Samantha truthfully. 
�Samantha, you are wrong about me, I do not view you as an immature teenage girl. I know that you are way beyond that point in your life. I see you as a mature young lady. You are only 5 years younger than me. In the eyes of society our relationship is unnatural, but I think that they are wrong. I mean think of those 20 year old girls marrying those 60-80 year old men for their money. Samantha I have great respect for you. Now when I met you I had no more respect for you than I did for the common hooker. Back then  that was all you were in my eyes, but now with some discipline in your life you have turned out to be a decent young lady. Now, we must continue this conversation later as your parents are here. They came just in case you decided to see them. However, had you decided not to see them I would have sent them on their merry way,� said Mr. Davidson. �Now come along Samantha we are going to the living room,� ordered Mr. Davidson. Samantha got to her feet and followed Mr. Davidson to the living room without complaint. 
When Samantha saw her parents she felt no emotion for them. She felt as though she had just met them for the first time. Her mother noticed the emotionless stare she was getting from her daughter. Samantha looked stunning with her hair pulled back into a ponytail and wearing a beautiful sundress as it was midsummer. On her feet was a pair of beautiful heels that went great with her dress. Her make up was noticeable but not sluttish.  
�Hey Sam, How are you dearest?� asked Mr. LeGree. Samantha looked at him for a moment with a blank expression as if to say: who are you? 
�Hello father. It is nice to see you,� said Samantha in a voice totally devoid of emotion. Mr. Davidson looked at her but said nothing. He had expected her to react this way. 
�Ok, why don�t we get this thing started, shall we? Samantha will you please come over here and sit next to me?� stated Mr. Davidson. Samantha walked over and sat down next to Mr. Davidson without saying a word. Her parents looked at her. She had changed so much in the last 2 years. She was beautiful and had that look of maturity. She could pass for a woman of at least 21. This was very surprising as she was only 18.
�Sam, we had to sell you to Mr. Davidson. You had become such a burden on us and he offered us $100,000 and a way to get rid of you. Do you understand?� asked Mrs. LeGree. She was hoping that Samantha would say yes and at the same time hoping she would say no.
�Don�t answer that Samantha,� said Mr. Davidson. He had already seen her bite her tongue in order to keep herself in check. �You can explain but don�t ask questions of her. This is hard enough on her without having to answer stupid questions. It took everything she had in her to forgive you. If I were her I would not have been able to forgive you. You two are selfish uncaring individuals. I have to admit that I disliked your daughter, but when you two came in with those �my shit doesn�t stink� looks on your faces I knew that I had to save your daughter. I knew that you were useless parents and had never disciplined your daughter. You never even cared to realize that she did most of the things she did to get your attention. You see I gave your daughter what you couldn�t give her. I gave her the attention she craved and I gave her the discipline she needed and she has turned into a respectable young lady,� said Mr. Davidson.
�May I interject something please sir?� asked Samantha quietly.
�Yes Samantha of course you may,� replied Mr. Davidson. He knew that she had some things that she needed to get off of her chest.
�When I needed you all the most you weren�t there for me. When I was raped you weren�t there for me. You were never there for me. You were always out of town or at some stupid business meeting. I never cared about all the stuff I had. I spent all your money shopping to get back at you. I hated you. I considered running away or ending my life. You know if it wasn�t for Aunt Linda I would have killed myself after I was raped. You two were too busy with your own lives. Half of the time I wondered if you even remembered you had a daughter,� said Samantha. Mr. Davidson looked at her with admiration. 
�That was very well articulated Samantha. Mr. and Mrs. LeGree I think that it is time for you to leave,� said Mr. Davidson.
�But we didn�t get a chance to tell our side of the story,� whined Mrs. LeGree. Both Mr. Davidson and Samantha gave her a look that said �who gives a shit?� Both Mr. and Mrs. LeGree caught that look and got up to leave.  Mr. LeGree turned and looked deeply into his daughter�s eyes. He knew that everything she had just said was true. He had never seen what a bad parent he was. He thought that his daughter was happy because she enjoyed all the things she had. He never even thought for a second that she would feel the way she felt.
�Sam, I truly am sorry. I always thought that you were happy. You never gave us any indication that you weren�t,� said Mr. LeGree. Samantha looked at her father with utter disdain. The look was noticed by all present in the room. Mr. Davidson could tell that she really wanted to say something, and he was glad that she was restraining herself.
�Samantha, go to my study and close the door,� ordered Mr. Davidson. She was hurt that she was being sent away like a little child, but she went without complaint. Mr. Davidson was furious because the LeGrees� were bringing Samantha�s old feelings to the surface. She had worked so hard to forget about those feelings, and now they were resurfacing. �You two have a lot of nerve don�t you. Do you have any idea how hard Samantha worked to get rid of the feelings that are now resurfacing?� asked Mr. Davidson. 
�We only wanted our daughter to understand why we did what we did. We never meant any harm to anyone, and we wanted to know how our daughter was doing. We haven�t seen her in over 2 years, and obviously you have turned her against us,� snapped Mr. LeGree. 
�You turned your daughter against you. You gave up your parental rights and you gave up on Samantha. All she ever needed was a little discipline in her life. She craved it and you didn�t give it to her. Samantha harbors strong feelings of hatred towards you and it is caused by the fact that you hurt her. Emotionally you have scarred her,� replied Mr. Davidson.  
�We have done no such thing. We only did what was best for our daughter,� replied Mrs. LeGree. At that point she and her husband had become so infuriated that they stormed out.
Meanwhile, Samantha was nervously pacing around Mr. Davidson�s study. He was still angry with her parents so he stayed in the living room so he wasn�t likely to take it out on Samantha. Finally he calmed down enough to face Samantha without blowing up at her. He got up from the sofa and walked into his study. When Mr. Davidson entered his study Samantha immediately fell to her knees and bowed her head with her hands clasped behind her back. Mr. Davidson was proud of her for that. He stood in the doorway staring at her. This made her nervous and she shifted slightly under his laser like eyes. His eyes seemed to be boring a hole into her. Finally he started walking towards her. 
When he was directly in front of her he said, �Stand up dear, and look at me. I know that right now you are probably upset and angry with me. I realize now that I should not have sent you away. You are an adult and have the right to be treated like one. Can you forgive me?�
Samantha was searching his face for something. She wasn�t even sure what she was looking for. Finally she said, �Yes sir.� She said it without even realizing what she had done, but he also knew that she had been thinking out loud. 
18 months ago.
Samantha was on her knees in front of Mr. Davidson. She was being belligerent today. She wanted to go home and be with her parents. On the other hand she didn�t want to be with them either. They were the reason she was in this situation. 
Mr. Davidson was not impressed at all by the temper tantrum she had just thrown. �You can throw as many temper tantrums as you wish. I don�t care. Just remember that every action in life has a reaction. In this case you won�t like the reaction,� said Mr. Davidson quietly. She knew that this meant he was angry, but she didn�t give a fuck. 
�Thank you Einstein. You�re so fucking brilliant,� snapped Samantha. Mr. Davidson got up and headed out of his study.
At the door he turned and said, �It was Isaac Newton who came up with that theory. Albert Einstein is responsible for the theory of Relativity. I want you to look through some of my books on Newton and Einstein and write me a 10 page single spaced essay on both of them and their theories. You have 5 hours. You can use that computer over there in the corner. If you plagiarize you will be severely punished.� She stared at him in disbelief.
�You can�t be serious. That is ludicrous. It�s not possible to do 20 pages single spaced in 5 hours. You�re a fucking idiot,� she snapped.
�Ok now it�s 15 pages each and you have 3 hours. If I were you I would stop complaining and get started. By the way that computer is not able to access the internet so don�t try it. Oh and I�ve read every book in this library.� he snapped and left the room. 
She knew that he was not impressed by tears, and that she would be severely punished if she did not finish the task he had given her. 
&#9;2 Hours Later
Samantha could not figure out how Mr. Davidson had his books organized. The smart thing to do would be to ask him, but she was too proud for that. She was really angry with him. He had come back into his study an hour after he had assigned her the impossible task. He watched her struggle to find the books that she needed. He was trying to teach her a lesson so he wasn�t going to tell her that all the books on science were on the bookcase behind his desk. She was avoiding that one with all her might because he was sitting at his desk. She knew that he was enjoying watching her struggle. Finally she became so frustrated she broke into tears. He looked at her curiously, but she noticed that his eyes held no sympathy. Even though she was crying she could not force herself to ask him where the books were. She noticed that he had gone back to whatever he had been doing before she interrupted him by crying. Finally when she had only 20 minutes left she had convinced herself to ask him, but as she was gaining the courage to do so he got up and left the room without a word. 
20 minutes later.
�Times up,� said Mr. Davidson as he entered the room. �What do you have for me?� he asked. He of course knew that she most likely had nothing for him.
�Nothing,� she replied without looking at him.
�Well then it would appear that we have a problem. I don�t appreciate being defied,� he said angrily. 
�I couldn�t find any books on the subject,� she said coolly. She knew that he was not going to accept that as an excuse but she used it anyway. 
�I seem to remember that I sat in here for over an hour. You could have asked me and I would have told you that all the books pertaining to science are on the bookcase behind my desk,� he replied. 
�Well you could have told me that. You knew for a fact that I couldn�t locate the books. You are such an ass,� she screamed. 
�Well that is fine and dandy but you still did not finish the task I gave you in the time I allotted you. You see had you done even one page I wouldn�t have been as angry, but since you did nothing I am furious and you will be punished,� he said coldly. �Now strip and get on all fours. You have exactly one minute. If I were you I�d be jumping out of those clothes,� he added. She immediately began undressing, but she was not quick enough for him and ended up being hit by his belt several times. 
Present
�Sir, do you think that I reacted harshly towards my parents? I didn�t really give them much time to explain,� said Samantha.
�Samantha you gave them plenty of opportunity. They just didn�t take it. That�s not your fault. I don�t blame you for reacting the way you did, I on the other hand should have done a better job with keeping my temper in check,� replied Mr. Davidson. He could tell that she was still unsure. �Hon believe me if I were you I would have given them 100 times more hell than you did,� he said. 
�Still, I really think that I need to apologize to them. I should not have acted the way I did towards them. I was very disrespectful,� said Samantha quietly. He knew that she was not trying to be disobedient, but he felt that a little punishment may be effective. 
�Strip,� he ordered. She immediately took off her clothes and awaited further instruction. �Bend over the desk with your hands stretched out in front of you,� he ordered. She immediately complied. �Do you know why you are being punished Samantha?� asked Mr. Davidson.
�Yes Sir. I did not listen to what you said and in a way I defied you,� she replied. He was proud of her because she had figured it out on her own. 
�What implement of discipline do you think that this act of defiance should be corrected with?� he asked. 
�I believe that you should use the cane sir,� she replied. He knew that she hated the cane and had never before suggested its use when he asked her the same question. 
�How many strokes do you believe that you should receive?� he asked. He expected that the number would be relatively low. She would most likely say 10 or less. 
�25 Sir,� she replied quietly. 
�That could be quite painful. That is a lot of punishment to take at one time,� he said.
�I deserve it,� she said. 
18 Months Ago
Once she was on all fours he asked, �Do you think that you should be punished?�
�No sir. The assignment that you gave was impossible to complete in the time provided,� she snapped. �Also you knew that I was struggling to find any books on the subject and yet you offered me no help at all,� she complained. 
�I was in the room for over an hour. You could have asked me for help at any time. I would have even been willing to help you with the paper itself but you were stubborn and refused any help. This is not my fault and you need to learn that there will be times when the assignment may be impossible but that does not mean that you should put no effort towards completing it. What implement of discipline should I use to administer your punishment?� he replied. 
�Your hand Sir,� she said hopefully.
�I�ll make you a deal. I�ll use my hand and I get to choose how many or I use something else and you choose how many which one is it?� he replied.
�1 with your belt,� she replied.
�Of course the number has to be above 30 for the number of pages you didn�t complete,� he added.
�Fine then I want your hand and you can choose how many,� she said.
�If that is what you want then it will be 75 hits. Then you stand in the corner for an hour,� he said. He was good to his word. He hit her 75 times and then she had to stand with her nose in the corner for an hour. Of course he had to make it more difficult. He forbade her from touching herself at all whilst she was in the corner. 
Present
�I think that you are using this punishment as a way of punishing yourself for how you reacted towards your parents,� he said. 
�I know sir, but I can�t help it. I feel like the lowest of the low because of how I treated them. They are my parents and I should have treated them with more respect than I did. I mean what would you have done if I had treated you that way,� she replied. 
�Samantha this is all my fault. I put you in a bad situation I expected you to react exactly the way you did. I was in the wrong for putting you in that situation, but I wanted you to tell them how you felt. If you want to be mad at anyone make it me not yourself because this is entirely my fault. I will however give you 25 strokes with the cane if it will make you feel better,� Mr. Davidson replied. 
�Please sir it will make me feel much better if you administer 25 strokes with the cane,� she said quietly.
�Answer me one thing first. Why are you sacrificing yourself for them when they didn�t sacrifice themselves for you,� he said. 
�Honestly Sir I have no idea. It just feels like the right thing to do,� she said. The same question had been swirling around in Samantha�s own mind. They had given up on her they had just admitted it and yet she found herself sacrificing herself for them. 
�Fine if you wish to be a martyr then so be it,� he said. Then he administered the first stroke of the cane. She was quiet through the entire punishment. He knew that she felt the pain, but her body was not reacting to it in any way. 
Samantha was a million miles away as Mr. Davidson administered the punishment. She didn�t know why but her mind had wandered back to her rape.
****** Samantha was walking home from school when a man came up behind her. He grabbed her arm and whispered,� Don�t scream or I�ll cut your fucking throat bitch.�
She was frightened beyond belief but didn�t act like anything out of the ordinary was happening. The man led her to an apartment building and took her to what she assumed to be his apartment. When they got there he tore off her clothes and raped her. Even though the pain had been horrendous Samantha had not screamed. When her attacker was finished he simply pushed Samantha out of the apartment. The woman in the next apartment found the girl crying in the hallway about an hour later. She gave the girl some clothes and took her to the police station. The girl was in hysterics. She was crying uncontrollably. She kept saying that HE was going to kill her. The woman assumed that the girl was talking about whoever had done this to her.*****
�Samantha are you all right?� asked Mr. Davidson in a tone of voice that told her that he was seriously worried about her. He had noticed that she seemed to be a million miles away, and she kept muttering, �He�s going to kill me. Please take me home. Don�t take me to the cops. He�ll kill me!� 
Samantha started sobbing uncontrollably. She didn�t know why but the caning had helped her get over her rape. Before now she hadn�t even been able to think about the rape without thinking about killing herself. Mr. Davidson reached out and took Samantha into his arms and tried to comfort the sobbing girl. He knew that she had relived her rape in her mind.
Samantha finally regained control of herself. She had not realized that Mr. Davidson had been comforting her the whole time. 
�Samantha are you all right?� Mr. Davidson asked once again. He seemed very concerned about her.
�Yes sir. I�m all right,� she replied quietly. �Sir would it be all right if I were to take a nap?� Samantha requested.
Mr. Davidson looked at his watch and saw that it was lunch time so he said, �No. I am going to take you out to lunch, and you are going to tell me what just happened.�  
�But sir. Please I can�t tell you. That would be like living through it a third time. Please just let me sleep,� whined Samantha.  
�I think it would you feel more comfortable with me and our sexual experiences together if I understood exactly what happened to you when you were raped,� replied Mr. Davidson.
