My Place in Life

&nbsp;

01

The lift had broken, that was how
it all started again, many years ago, when I was just nineteen. My first job
had been with a builder�s merchant, shifting bags of cement, packs of bricks
and timber, nothing that could be purchased there was lightweight it seemed. At
nineteen I was a wimp, no doubt about it, skinny, almost to the point of
emaciation, by twenty-one I was almost a hunk. That though is two years further
on than I want to tell you about right now, so I will go back again, back to
the year I turned nineteen, the year that, with the help of a loan from my
father, I moved into my own place, a flat on the fifth floor of a block where
the lift kept breaking down!

&nbsp;

~*~

&nbsp;

It had been a hard day, a local
firm had ordered all the small red bricks to pave the driveways of their new,
exclusive, eighteen house estate from us and I had been one of the three men
moving them from our yard to their lorries. All I wanted to do now was collapse
into a nice hot bath and then watch TV or maybe videos for the rest of the
evening. I�d stopped at the fish and chip shop on the way home so I didn�t have
to cook.

&nbsp;

The sign hanging from the call
button on the front of the lift had been adorned with graffiti. Where the
official printing of �Out of Order� finished someone had added �Again� in a
flowing hand. I could only nod in exhausted agreement with their sentiment as I
placed one foot in front of the other and prepared to climb the ten flights to
my own front door.

&nbsp;

As I reached the third landing I
saw her. She was older than me, maybe thirty, thirty-five, slim, tall, easily
five-ten, or even five-eleven, her hair was what my sister, or one of them,
would have called mouse. Brown but nothing special, apparently, although I
thought it was wonderful. I thought she was wonderful also, we didn�t meet each
other very often but every time we did my heart would beat faster, my brain
would shut down and, although I was incredibly aroused, I never really knew
why. This time though she looked at me as I passed and, for the first time, to
my surprise, I managed to stutter out a �hi, flaming lift,� or something
similar. She just nodded but then smiled, her eyes softening, I saw her whole
face soften in fact, and then it was gone, and so was she, opening her own door
and disappearing inside.

&nbsp;

The other four flights of stairs
seemed to pose no problems and soon I too was inside my own flat, kicking my
dust covered shoes off in the front hall and heading straight for the bathroom
to put the equally dust encrusted clothes into the laundry basket. When I was
naked I stepped into the shower, too excited now for a bath and, as the hot
water pummelled my back, pumped my hard cock, bringing myself to the point of
orgasm and then denial three times before turning the dial back to off and
stepping out onto the blue foot shaped mat that lay in front of the shower
cubicle door.

&nbsp;

~*~

&nbsp;

Maybe, to understand why I was so
captivated by Susan, her name was Susan; I need to move back in time. I know my
past is important to my present and hopefully my future and so I should explain
a little about who, and what, I am before we get any deeper into this story. 

&nbsp;

My name is Martin, some people
call me Mart, even Tinny, but never, ever, Marty, I hate that. I�m in my mid
thirties now, but then, at nineteen, I was just starting to discover that what
I wanted and needed in my life was linked permanently to my formative years
between sixteen and eighteen. I am the youngest of five children, and the only
boy, I�m also a twin. My mother and father were, to say the least, a little
surprised when mum fell pregnant again, even though my dad is a doctor. My
sisters ranged in age between five and eight on the day of our birth and from
that April onwards I had four mothers and one, not very often at home, father.

&nbsp;

Over the years I was, I have to
admit, a spoilt rotten mamma�s boy. My mother, so I discovered later, had
always wanted a son, although at forty-six, when I was born, she had also long
given up the idea of having one and was waiting for grandchildren instead. My
sisters, on the other hand, suddenly found that dolls do come to life and, as
long as I did as I was told, my every day existence was very pleasant, disobey
though and things change, rapidly.

&nbsp;

I�m not sure of the exact age,
but I can remember, long before I headed off for nursery school, that if I
displeased any of my three elder sisters I would be put over their knee and
become the recipient of, from little girls at least, a sound thrashing. These
carried on well into my teens, as, for a long time, I was the smallest in the
family, even though I was a boy. They convinced me to keep my hair fairly long
as well, and I have to confess there was a lot of pleasure to be had just by
sitting still and letting them comb it, curl it, even plait it. 

&nbsp;

As I got older, my twin sister,
Martha and Fiona, the sister closest to us in age, began to become interested
in me in ways other than that of someone to tease, punish or pamper. Fiona, who
was very, very clever, top set everything she set her mind to, seemed to
realize, when I hit sixteen to her twenty-one, that I could be of use to her. I
heard her talking with the only other sister still at home, Martha, who was, as
she loved to tell anyone who would listen, five minutes older than me. She was
also, blossoming, just like I was, although obviously in different places.

&nbsp;

My mother and father had
announced, on our sixteenth birthdays to be exact, that Martha and I were now
old enough to be left on our own over the weekend, especially if Fiona was home
too. They joined a holiday club which gave discounts to some of the best hotels
in the country and most Friday evenings saw them loading up their red MG sports
car and heading out in one direction or another leaving me, to the delight of
my sisters, the only male in the house.

&nbsp;

The first weekend, a fortnight
after we turned sixteen, was a turning point in my life, not that I knew it at
the time. The three of us stood by the front door waving our parents off, a
slip of paper on the phone table behind us, should we need, in a dire emergency
only, to contact them. Looking back, fire, flood or, at a pinch, death would
have been the only emergencies to get them to return early, none of those
happened and so they never saw what went on behind their own closed doors.

&nbsp;

Fiona and Martha had been having
little conflabs all week, which would stop, or turn into fits of giggles, if I
happened along. Now I was about to find out what they had been talking about. 

&nbsp;

�So, Martin, Martha and I think
we need to discuss how these weekends are going to be run.� Fiona had her arms
folded, a stern look on her face, and for some reason my heart began to race.

&nbsp;

�O � ok,� I gulped the word out,
my head dropping into a submissive position without me even realizing it.

&nbsp;

�That�s �ok, Miss Fiona,� from
now on.� Her voice made her sound like a schoolteacher and without looking up I
spoke again.

&nbsp;

�Yes, Miss Fiona.�� I was used to being told what to do, I was
regularly ordered about but somehow this time it was different, more charged
than usual. I didn�t know why but although I felt about three inches tall,
which was also usual, I felt excited as well, my hands were clammy and I moved
them behind me so that my sisters wouldn�t realize.

&nbsp;

�We have decided that if you want
us to continue being nice to you, then you will have to be extra nice to us in
return. This means you do the cooking, the cleaning, all the things mum does,
and then we will make sure you don�t get lonely over the weekend. Do you
understand?�

&nbsp;

I didn�t, but had a feeling that
wasn�t a good answer. 

&nbsp;

�Yes, Miss Fiona. What do you
want me to do first?� 

&nbsp;

What they wanted me to do was
make the Friday tea. Mum had left all the ingredients for a spaghetti
bolognaise, not out of a jar as she would do these days, but individual bits
and pieces that, if put together correctly, should feed the three of us very
nicely indeed.

&nbsp;

Looking back, it�s a good thing I
was in charge of the tidying up as well as the cooking. No one would have
wanted to follow me into that kitchen. Gradually though, as the weekends went
on, I became much tidier and far more expert, even changing the suggested menu
and surprising my sisters.

&nbsp;

For about the first six months I
was just a lackey. I did everything I was told and in return I was cuddled, had
my hair played with, sometimes Miss Fiona would even rub my shoulders when I
was free from my chores. I didn�t mind any of the things that were happening,
in fact I looked forward to the moment when the little red car would disappear
from view and my sisters took over my care.

&nbsp;

When things began to get a little
more serious I didn�t question it, instead I realized there was no other way
for our arrangement to move on, and I was happy with that. The Friday Miss
Martha told me there would be a few changes was in September, it was pouring
with rain and we had just turned the heating on for the first time since the
late spring. 

&nbsp;

�Come here, boy.� She enjoyed
that name more than anything I think, it emphasized her elder sister status
every time she used it.

&nbsp;

�Yes, Miss Martha.� I had been heading
towards the kitchen to begin the dinner but now I turned and walked into the
living room behind my sisters instead.

&nbsp;

�Stand there, on the rug, we have
things to tell you.�

&nbsp;

I nodded at my twin, the
excitement for some reason rushing through my veins, even though I had no idea
what she was going to say.

&nbsp;

�First of all, we are delighted
at the way you have behaved over the summer, your food is wonderful, the house
is always tidy when mum and dad get home, in fact you have exceeded our
expectations for you.� 

&nbsp;

I just beamed, I wanted to cry,
my heart was pounding, I managed to keep still, but it was difficult. The
praise was more than I had ever expected, and I babbled my own response,
although now, all these years later, I have no recollection of what I actually
said. 

&nbsp;

�We are a little disappointed in
your appearance though.�

&nbsp;

The words brought me back to
earth with a bump, they weren�t happy, all the food, the tidying up, the being
there for them wasn�t enough, I had let them down.

&nbsp;

�I�m � I�m sorry, Miss Martha.
How can I change things so I please you in everything I do?�

&nbsp;

With hindsight I can see that
they were, very cleverly, whether they realized it or not, increasing their
hold and influence over me and I was more than ready to let them.

&nbsp;

�First of all, whenever mum and
dad are away you will no longer wear a top.� Miss Fiona got to her feet as she
spoke and moved towards me, causing me to back up towards the door double
quick.

&nbsp;

�What?� The one word was a squeak
and I subconsciously grabbed hold of the hem of my t-shirt, not wanting anyone
to touch it.

&nbsp;

�Let go!�

&nbsp;

I did, I had no power to refuse
her and from that moment on, until changes were made again, I was bare chested
the entire time our parents were on their little jaunts. 

&nbsp;

�Good grief, there�s more meat on
Ralph!� My older sister laughed as she spoke and I looked down, tears clouding
my eyes. Ralph was my father�s skeleton. A bone specialist at the local
hospital he sometimes worked in his study at home on papers for various medical
publications and Ralph was his constant, if silent, companion.

&nbsp;

�He�s quite sweet really, but I
have to say you�re right. Lift your arms.� Miss Martha moved a little closer to
me as well and I did as I was told. �At least he has hair underneath his arms.
He has hairy legs too, I see him playing football on a Thursday afternoon in
PE.� 

&nbsp;

I may as well have not been
there; they discussed my physical attributes for a good five minutes without
actually taking any notice of me at all. Then Miss Fiona looked at her watch, slapped
me lightly on the chest and sent me off to make the dinner.

&nbsp;

Again things went on like that
for quite a while but the two of them were clearly enjoying my discomfort and I
knew, before long, they would call me before them again. 

&nbsp;

It was the first anniversary of
our being home alone when the next major humiliation occurred and this time
they both began to realize I was enjoying myself as much as, if not more than,
they were. 

&nbsp;

My sisters were now seventeen and
twenty-two, Miss Fiona was, in my eyes a beautiful woman, and Miss Martha was
too. My twin and I were in the sixth form of our school and could wear our own
clothes rather than the school uniform we had suffered for the previous five
years. As I stood in my usual place on the circular rug I could see that Miss
Martha�s white shirt and her PE skirt were on the coffee table in front of
them.

&nbsp;

�As much as we�ve enjoyed looking
at your chest over the past few months we have begun to think that it might not
be awfully hygienic to have you cooking with your little nipples on show.� Miss
Fiona reached out and pinched both brown nubs as she spoke and I felt myself
blush and willed the stirring in my groin to go away.

&nbsp;

�No, Miss Fiona.� 

&nbsp;

�Instead, we have a set of
clothes for you to wear. You will need to make sure they are clean and ironed
every Friday so that you can slip into them as soon as mum and dad leave. If
they aren�t, well then, you know what will happen don�t you?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Miss Fiona.� I was still
being spanked if I was naughty, usually while I was positioned over the back of
one of the kitchen chairs holding tightly to the arms. I had sprung up like a
weed in the last year. No longer was I the smallest in the house, and both my
sisters liked the way my bum stuck out when I was punished in that way.

&nbsp;

�Take off your trousers then, we
don�t have all evening!� Miss Martha, who was definitely the more bossy of the
two, stood up and I hurried to do what I was told, only to stop dead in my
tracks when I realized I was getting a hard on in front of my sisters.

&nbsp;

�Oh, for goodness sake, let me do
it for you!� She marched forward, but then she too stopped, but whereas I had
been mortified she was delighted. �Fi, look, he has a dick after all!� 

&nbsp;

Her hands were suddenly on the
belt of my jeans, undoing first that and then the button and zipper. She pulled
them down off my slim hips, my pants following in very short order, until I was
naked before them, apart from my socks. 

&nbsp;

�For a wimp he�s quite a big boy
isn�t he?� Miss Fiona stood in front of me, then she poked me, just the once in
my ball sack, and my erection got even harder. I should have run away, shouted
at them, pulled my jeans back on, anything to put me in control, after all I
was the one who was being exposed, but I didn�t, instead I stood there, beet
red from my toes to my ears, and said and did nothing.

&nbsp;

�You know, I think we could have
two uniforms. This one for when he isn�t cooking, and the other one for when he
is.� Miss Martha, her eyes gleaming, spoke quietly but enthusiastically to my
other sister and I saw her nod in response. 

&nbsp;

�Put these on, but once dinner is
ready you will come back in here and strip off in front of us, is that
understood?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Miss Martha.� I reached out
for the white shirt and slipped it on. Once I had done that I began to button
it up but was stopped by a slap on my hand.

&nbsp;

�No, no, that�s not how you wear
it at all. I suppose I�ll have to show you.� She undid the two fastenings I had
managed to do and then began to bunch up the cotton until she was able to tie
the two sides together underneath my chest. No buttons were done up and my
stomach, with its line of hair leading from my belly button to my pubic fur,
was going to be visible whatever else I put on.

&nbsp;

�Let me do the skirt.� Miss Fiona picked up the tiny blue item
of female clothing and moved in front of my other sister. �And lose those
socks, you are never to wear them on the weekends again.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Miss Fiona.� I bent down
quickly and slipped them off, my cock, which I suppose at that time was about
six inches long, bobbed respectfully as I did so; I had never known it feel so
hard before.

&nbsp;

Once the skirt was on as well,
both my sisters inspected the tented shape I was making in the front of it and
laughed.

&nbsp;

�Off you go, make us our dinner
and then report back in here.� Miss Martha had finally sat down, and I
realized, rather belatedly, that she was as sexually excited as I was. �Oh, and
you aren�t allowed to touch yourself either. We�ll be checking.�

&nbsp;

It was as if it took my sisters
at least a few weeks each time to test the boundaries they had set for me. I
never received new instructions in concurrent weeks, or even months. Only when
I had begun to get used to my new humiliations did they change, either to
something worse or totally different.

&nbsp;

By the time I was ready to move
into my own place just after my nineteenth birthday I was their slave in
everything but name. I made sure their bedrooms were tidy even when mum and dad
were home. Every weekend I was expected to be with my sisters, my social life
began on a Monday and ended on a Thursday. The Friday, Saturday and Sunday I
only wore clothes when I was in the kitchen and I was expected to take all the
comments as well as the slaps, pinches and strokes of my cock without comment. 

&nbsp;

During the week I now prepared a
lot of the meals we all ate, and would have liked to have gone to catering
college but my father wouldn�t hear of it. It was bad enough that I had long
hair and no girlfriend, but to cook for a living as well, that was more than he
could allow.

&nbsp;

Miss Fiona had been the first one
to decide that, as I was now eighteen and still a virgin, things needed to be
taken, quite literally, in hand. As I remember I had cooked a particularly
delicious quiche, with a beautiful salad, jacket potatoes and a strawberry
meringue which, though I do say so myself, was to die for, and we were all
sitting in the front room, happily enjoying the summer sun as it shone in
through the French windows when she spoke.

&nbsp;

�Miss Martha tells me you�ve
never even seen a woman naked, is that right?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Miss Fiona.� It wasn�t
something I was proud of, but it was true, and I never could lie to my sisters.

&nbsp;

�Would you like to?�

&nbsp;

�Oh, yes, Miss Fiona, more than
anything.� I was, as usual, naked myself, as I had finished working in the kitchen,
and my penis, which was flaccid until they began speaking, was now at
half-mast.

&nbsp;

�There are conditions attached to
this.�

&nbsp;

I didn�t care; I was humiliated
by my lack of a girlfriend, and not in a pleasurable way. 

&nbsp;

�I�ll do whatever you want, Miss
Fiona, you know that.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, I do, don�t I.� It wasn�t a
question, and I knew better than to answer her.

&nbsp;

�Very well, I will explain to you
what is going to happen.� She paused for a moment, just for effect, and then
continued. �First of all, you will be spanked, soundly. I don�t want you to
think any of this is for your enjoyment. Once you have been punished then I
will remove my clothes and you will be able to look, but absolutely no
touching.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Miss Fiona, I understand.�

&nbsp;

�Did I say you should speak?�
Miss Fiona pointed towards the rug and I knew my place, in seconds I was on my
knees looking down. I wasn�t sure when I had first been told to do that, but it
was second nature now, to assume the position, so to speak, when I was in
trouble.

&nbsp;

�No, Miss, Fiona, please forgive
me.�

&nbsp;

�Once you have had a good look,�
Miss Fiona continued as if I had remained silent, like I should have done,
�then I may let you learn a little about what a woman wants to happen to her
when she is with a man. That depends on your behaviour up until that point
though.�

&nbsp;

�Stand up and come over here.� It
was Miss Martha who spoke now, and I did as I was told. Of the two sisters she
usually punished me. My sister was an enthusiastic tennis player and I felt the
rough end of her forehand at least once a week.

&nbsp;

�Lean forward so that you can
grasp the arms of the chair.� 

&nbsp;

The chair in question was very
comfortable, green in colour with wooden insets on the ends of the arms. I had
to stand, facing the chair, and hold onto them when my punishment took place in
the living room. I felt more pain when I was disciplined here; there was no
chair back to stop me moving forwards and by the end my shoulders would hurt
almost as much as my backside. 

&nbsp;

One sister, I�m not sure which,
then nudged my feet apart until she could see my testicles hanging down. Once
that was done they stood on either side of me and, again anonymously, lightly
ran a hand over my bum cheeks and then a long nail down my spine. A thumb and
forefinger grasped one of my nipples and pinched it hard, causing me to gasp
out loud, even though I knew it was coming.

&nbsp;

Through all of this my cock was
getting harder and harder, but as I was never allowed to cum, not while we were
in the living room, I knew I could do nothing about it. I had to wait until
certain conditions were met. One was that it had to be something I was so
desperate for I would kneel outside my sisters� bedrooms after lights out, with
only the glow from under their closed doors to work with, and beg for their permission
to wank myself off until my load shot across the hallway, so frantic was I for
release. If one of them said no, then I was forbidden to cum. The second
condition was that I had to be vocal; they wanted to hear me as I played with
myself, and then, once I had cum I was to remain on my knees on the wooden
floor and lick up all my spunk to their satisfaction.

&nbsp;

Sometimes I wasn�t allowed to
even beg, I had to go to bed with my erection so painful I had difficulty
sleeping. Other times I had to play with myself in front of them, but there was
no chance of me having to lick up my mess. I would work myself closer and
closer to a climax and then one or other sister would stop me. They would hold
my hands behind my back and wait, five, maybe ten minutes, all the time
discussing my, to them, small dick, and how pathetic it was, sometimes flicking
the tip or pinching at my balls, before I was instructed to start again. The
most I could do was five almost climaxes, then I would be in tears, begging
them, promising the earth to either sister if only they would let me keep
stroking myself until that delicious feeling could explode along with all the
semen their comments and humiliation had produced. I was never allowed to cum
though, not when they ordered me to give them a show, and I knew it. It didn�t
put me off; in fact it was so delicious, so exciting to me, that the denial was
a huge part of the pleasure.

&nbsp;

This time was different, I wanted
so much to see Miss Fiona naked, but I knew the moment I did I would probably
shoot my load and get into serious trouble. Before that though, I had the
spanking to endure, and trying to clear my mind of the things which were to
come, I lowered my head and closed my eyes. 

&nbsp;

SMACK!

&nbsp;

�Thank you, Miss Martha.� I had
shouted once a few years earlier, when they spanked me, and ever since I was
expected to thank them for each slap.

&nbsp;

SMACK!

&nbsp;

�Thank you, Miss Fiona.� They
were alternating the smacks and my heart sank. When that happened it meant I
would be punished for twice as long. And if I happened to get their name wrong,
then one of them would grasp my testicles hard and twist them each time I was
slapped for up to ten hits.

&nbsp;

Finally, when I was sobbing and
my bottom felt like it was hot enough to cook eggs on, it was over. I was told
to let go and then return to the rug. In many ways that was the worst part,
even though it was quite old and soft in places, I was expected to sit on the
very edge so there was always a hard piece underneath me somewhere. 

&nbsp;

�Put your hands behind you, then
open your legs wide with the soles of your feet together.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Miss Fiona.� I did as I was
told instantly, even though I knew I was on display even more than I usually
was. The clock on the mantle said it was just after nine. I had been spanked
for almost fifteen minutes, my longest punishment yet. Now though, I was to get
my treat, I would see a naked woman and I would have endured another twenty
punishments for that.

&nbsp;

�Woman like to have men look at
them, but only when they have given permission. Being leered at in the street
is degrading, and you will make sure you never do that. Now though I want you
to look, so what you are doing is fine.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Miss Fiona, I will remember
not to stare when I am out.� Remember, hell, I would have agreed to anything,
but however easily I had accepted her instructions ever since that day I feel
guilty if I let my eyes linger for too long on a beautiful woman. 

&nbsp;

Gradually my sister began to undo
the shirt she was wearing. Then she slid it off her arms, onto the floor, and I
could see her black lacy bra, making her skin look even whiter than it was.
Once that was done she reached behind her and undid the fastening on her skirt.
That too slid to the floor and I gasped out loud as I saw she was wearing
stockings and a suspender belt. Her fingers slipped into the sides of her
knickers and she slowly, oh so slowly, began to slide them down her black
stocking covered legs. I could see that she too had pubic hair, blonde, just
like mine, but it was only a thin line, which seemed to be made up of little
curls as if she had spent ages carefully styling it.

&nbsp;

�This is my pussy. In here are
all the secrets that one day you might be able to discover, if you are
dedicated to the pleasure of your partner that is.� Miss Fiona moved across
towards the chair where I had just been punished and put one of her feet on the
cushion. Immediately I could see she was shaved and glistening between her
legs. 

&nbsp;

As I watched, my cock getting
harder by the second, Miss Fiona ran her fingers along her folds of skin and
then, suddenly, two of them disappeared inside her. I know I groaned and my
hands were fighting to get a hold of my erection. Again slowly, she removed her
fingers with a slurping noise and held them under my nose; they smelt
wonderful.

&nbsp;

�Taste.�

&nbsp;

I shot my tongue out, licking at
the liquid that was pooled in the bends behind her knuckles and got my first
taste of the nectar I would become addicted to very soon.

&nbsp;

For a while Miss Fiona sat in the
chair, she had made herself comfortable once I had finished cleaning her hand
for her, and I became more and more agitated as nothing seemed to be happening.

&nbsp;

�Please, Miss Fiona, please, may
I see your tits?� I finally had to speak, even though I knew I would probably
be in trouble for it.

&nbsp;

�You want to see my what?� Miss
Fiona stood up, she was still excited, her thighs glistened, and I could see
that the top of her stockings were wet.

&nbsp;

�Your tits, Miss Fiona, please,
let me see your tits.�

&nbsp;

�I don�t think you want to, not
really.�

&nbsp;

�Oh, I do, I really do.� I was on
my knees now; I kissed her black patent leather shoes before looking up at her
and speaking again. �Please, Miss Fiona, you can spank me again, or twist my
balls, but please, I want so much to see your tits, I just know they will be beautiful.
I won�t touch, I promise, I won�t touch you or me, but please let me see you
take your bra off.� I would have prostrated myself on the floor, but knew if I
did I would have to rub my cock on the carpet, and so I stayed on my knees,
kissing her again as soon as I had finished speaking.

&nbsp;

�What do you think, Miss Martha?
Does he deserve to have me take my last piece of clothing off? Has he shown
that he really wants to see me naked?�

&nbsp;

Her words were bombarding me with
images, I moaned out loud and felt a sob lodge itself in my throat.

&nbsp;

�Oh, I don�t know. I think that
maybe he should be spanked again. Would you agree to that, Martin?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Miss Martha, anything, Miss
Fiona, please.�

&nbsp;

I was a worm, a pathetic worm,
but I had never felt so turned on in my whole life. All that mattered to me was
that to see Miss Fiona naked I had to beg, I had to prove to my sisters I would
do as they wanted. At that moment I realized I had arrived, I was theirs to
command, and from that day on I have, if at all possible, done everything they
have ever wanted me to.

&nbsp;

Miss Fiona came closer and knelt
in front of me so we were almost eye-to-eye, I was still taller than her, even
in this position, and then she slid the straps off her shoulders and unclasped
the front of the black lacy bra and let it fall. 

&nbsp;

Nothing could have prepared me
for the breathtaking sight in front of me. Her pussy had been wonderful,
something I knew I wanted to see again one day, but more than anything I had
wanted Miss Fiona to bare her tits for me. And now, finally, I could see them,
right there in front of me, even closer than I could have ever imagined. Her
breasts were quite large, they were firm, white, and the nipples, oh, the
nipples, brown, large and, at that moment, with the areola puckered, they sat
proudly waiting to be sucked, pinched and twisted.

&nbsp;

�Ohhhh.� The moan that left my
lips was one of pure joy and Miss Fiona smiled. 

&nbsp;

�That is the type of reaction a
woman likes. In fact, because of it you may kiss them, once each.�

&nbsp;

How I didn�t shoot my spunk all
over the floor at that moment I will never know. Maybe all those enforced
nights of torment had given me more willpower than I realized, but, instead of
letting my hormones get the better of me, I leant forward and took her left
breast into my mouth, sucking it for a second before placing a kiss on the tip.
I then did the same on the other and reluctantly resumed my contrite position
in front of her.

&nbsp;

�You have done very well. In
fact, you are coming along excellently. Tomorrow night, if you are very good,
we may even do this again.�

&nbsp;

With that both my sisters got to
their feet, one dressed and one totally naked. They both smiled down at me, I
was never allowed to leave a room before them, and then wished me a very good
night. 

&nbsp;

�You don�t touch yourself though,
not unless we give express permission.�

&nbsp;

I knew that I was being given
permission to do something, to beg, to plead outside their bedroom doors later
in the evening, and I knew, without a shadow of a doubt, I would be there,
debasing myself, promising them the earth, if only they would let me re-live my
evening and make myself cum at the same time.

It was another week before I saw
her again, this time it was a sunny Saturday and, having finished work at
midday as I always did at the weekend, I was only planning to pop home and
change before heading off to watch the footie. Once again there was no lift,
but this time it was because the painters were in! It was hardly likely to get
shabby; no one ever had a chance to use it!

&nbsp;

Miss, in my mind she was always
that now, was climbing the stairs, her hands full of stretched and straining
supermarket carrier bags and I rushed up, cleared my throat and, ignoring my
nervousness, spoke to her.

&nbsp;

�Hi, can I carry those for you?�

&nbsp;

Turning just slightly I was
rewarded first with a frown but then a smile. 

&nbsp;

�Oh, thank you, that would be
wonderful.�

&nbsp;

I took over, carefully making
sure that none of the handles were unsupported, and followed her, slowly, to
her front door.

&nbsp;

�Could you put them into the
kitchen for me?� She indicated with her hand and I was about to say I knew
where to go as all the flats were the same when I realized they weren�t, hers
was far more luxurious than mine.

&nbsp;

�Of course, it�s no problem,
Miss.� I don�t know why I added the term of respect out loud but it seemed so
natural to do so and I didn�t really think about it until it was too late and I
saw a momentary puzzled look on her face.

&nbsp;

�Would you like a cup of tea, or
a cold drink? You were a lifesaver, some of those bags are heavy, but I just
couldn�t face more than one journey up those dreadful stairs.�

&nbsp;

�Thank you, a cold drink would be
lovely.� I looked at her and smiled; what I really wanted was to get the
refreshments myself, have her sit and me fetch, but that wasn�t possible, at
least not yet.

&nbsp;

�My name is Susan, why don�t you
sit down in the lounge and I�ll get the drinks?� She turned as she spoke,
walking away from me, her legs tanned in white denim shorts and a pair of deck
shoes. Her top was red, quite tight; I could see the outline of the straps of
her bra through it and had to avert my eyes so that my arousal wouldn�t become
obvious.

&nbsp;

Her lounge was quite sumptuous,
although understated; a deep and welcoming coffee coloured velour sofa with a
pair of matching chairs commanded the outside wall. The floors were wooden,
parquet, just as we�d had at home, and there was a thick pile rug with a glass
occasional table on it to complete the seating area. I perched myself on the
corner of one of the chairs, glad I had worked in the office rather than the
yard all morning, and continued to look around, trying to concentrate on
anything but my hostess in the vain hope that when she returned my dick
wouldn�t make its presence felt once again.

&nbsp;

�Here we go, oh, silly, you
needn�t get up.� I had risen to my feet as soon as I saw her, and although she
told me not to, I could tell she was flattered.

&nbsp;

�Now, you didn�t tell me your
name, did you?�

&nbsp;

�No, no, I didn�t, it�s Martin,
Miss.�

&nbsp;

�Well hi, Martin, I�m pleased to
meet you properly at last.�

&nbsp;

�Thank you.� I looked down,
wanting to look her in the eye, at least for a moment, but unable to because of
all the training I had received. 

&nbsp;

�Martin.� The one word was of a
slightly different tone and this time I did look up.

&nbsp;

�Yes, Miss?�

&nbsp;

�Are you frightened of me?�

&nbsp;

�Oh, no, not at all.� Suddenly I was
afraid, not of her, but of myself, had I blown it? Was I now to be thrown out
because of my attitude?

&nbsp;

�I see, I just wondered. Why do
you call me miss then? Is it because I am so much older than you?�

&nbsp;

Now I wasn�t afraid, but
horrified, I had insulted her, when all I wanted to do was offer my respect.

&nbsp;

�No, I � I�d better go, I�m so
sorry, Miss, really, really sorry.� I wanted to cry and my voice was definitely
wavering as I tried to get to my feet.

&nbsp;

�Martin.� Again she said my name,
this time softer, with more concern, and then I felt her hand on my arm. �Stay
still.� 

&nbsp;

I did as I was told; there was
nothing else I could do. When a woman, especially a beautiful and sexy woman
like Miss Susan, gave me instructions I was powerless to refuse.

&nbsp;

�Why don�t you sit back and tell
me a little about yourself? Maybe you will relax while you are doing so and
then, when you are really ready to leave, I won�t stop you.�

&nbsp;

I nodded, words didn�t seem to be
making their way from my brain to my mouth and so, in mute obedience, I plonked
myself, a little further back than before, onto the big squishy chair and let
it eat me.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

~*~

&nbsp;

For the next half an hour or so I
did talk, not continually, Miss Susan asked the odd question, she even
volunteered a little information about her own life, and gradually I calmed
down, stopped sweating, I even relaxed enough to smile and unclasp my hands
from in my lap.

&nbsp;

�I � I think I should leave now,
I�m sorry if I�ve upset your plans for the afternoon.� 

&nbsp;

�It is me who should be
apologising, but I think that may bring back all your insecurities, so instead
I will say it has been a pleasure to meet you and I hope we can renew our
acquaintance again very soon.�

&nbsp;

I just nodded, amazed she was
even prepared to see me out, let alone talk with me again. When I got to the
door I turned back to her, and carried my amazement to new levels when I spoke.

&nbsp;

�I�m a pretty good cook, I could
prepare a meal for you one night if you would like.�

&nbsp;

Her face beamed, she nodded her
head and then placed her hand over mine. 

&nbsp;

�That sounds like a marvellous
idea, what day did you have in mind?�

&nbsp;

�Umm, tomorrow? Or Monday? I
don�t work Mondays.�

&nbsp;

�Tomorrow. Let�s do it tomorrow.
Why don�t you come here and cook? I have all sorts of gadgets and things that
never get used on anything more than individual meals, it would be fun to see
what you could do with them.�

&nbsp;

After arranging to meet again at
four the following afternoon for a meal at six I walked as calmly as I could
until I knew I was out of sight and then belted up the stairs, in through my
own front door and straight to the bedroom. I knelt by the bed and pushing down
my work trousers began to pull on my hard cock, taking myself so close to the
edge that I nearly exploded instead of holding back.

&nbsp;

Four times I took myself to the
limit and each time I begged Miss Susan to let me cum, and each time I heard
her refuse me. Finally, when the strain was too much, I kept pumping, moving my
hand with measured strokes, until my cum shot out of me and onto the covers,
not once or twice, but in five long white bolts. I lowered my forehead to the
bed, resting it in the closest pool of spunk and closed my eyes, whatever else
happened for now I was in heaven.

&nbsp;

~*~

&nbsp;

I pored over my cookery books
that night, wondering what I could make that wouldn�t look as if I were showing
off, but would give her an idea of my culinary skills. In the end, remembering
I had seen some curry powder and a chicken amongst her shopping, I decided to
do an Indian meal, with naan bread and make it a medium heat.

&nbsp;

I tossed and turned in bed all
night, my dreams were full of her either eating the meal and then showering me
with kisses or laughing in my face and ordering me out of her home. In the end,
at six on Sunday morning, I got up, had a shower and decided to go for a run to
try and clear my head. Jogging wasn�t quite as popular a pastime as it is now,
and at that time of day I was the only one in the local park apart from
energetic dog walkers. I pushed myself to the limit; doing short bursts of
speed, long more steadily paced work and then a set of demanding stretches to
finish with. My job at the builders� merchants had certainly begun to toughen
me up, already I could notice a difference, and whereas six months earlier I
had been pure wimp now I was just wimp. I determined that never again would I
be the type of man who had sand kicked in his face, but I had no intention of
doing the kicking either. 

&nbsp;

I went back to my flat, had
another shower and breakfast and then made my way into town to get a few
necessities. There weren�t as many shops open on a Sunday as there are now, but
I managed to find everything I wanted in the ones that were. It was only a
little after twelve when I returned home again and was at a loss for something
to do. In the end I called my sisters, Miss Fiona and Miss Martha had a flat together
on the opposite side of town, and chatted with them for a while, not going into
great detail about my plans for the rest of the day, but assuring them I was
behaving in a manner befitting my station.

&nbsp;

By the time it was almost four
o�clock I was so nervous I thought I might pass out. I had no idea why I was
this way, other than somewhere deep inside me I knew I would serve her in any
way she wanted. I also had a feeling she knew that too.

&nbsp;

Making my way down the stairs and
towards her flat a feeling of calm seemed to descend over me and when she
opened her door I was able to smile and accept her invitation to enter without
making a total gibbering fool of myself.

&nbsp;

�Martin, you are prompt, I like
that. Put your things in the kitchen and then we can talk for a little while
before you begin.� Miss Susan didn�t have to direct me this time and I
carefully put all my different bits and bobs down on one of the work surfaces
before returning to where she stood in the front hallway.

&nbsp;

�Now, I know I don�t like to be
disturbed while I am cooking so you won�t be either. If you need anything
though just give a yell.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Miss Su�� I paused, not
sure if I should use her name and in the end deciding I wouldn�t until given
permission to do so. �Yes, Miss, and thank you for giving me the opportunity to
do this for you.�

&nbsp;

�My sweet boy, it is my pleasure.
Now, go, I will be in the lounge reading if you need anything, oh, and could
you bring me in a glass of white wine?�

&nbsp;

�Of course, Miss, right away.� I
beamed; there was something I could do for her immediately. 

&nbsp;

Once I had made sure Miss Susan
was comfortable I returned to the kitchen and began my preparations. As I did
so my heart began to sink, just a little. There were all sorts of gadgets and
equipment, some of which I had lusted after in my mother�s catalogues at home,
and they had all obviously been used quite extensively. Miss Susan, it seemed,
was a dedicated cook, just as I was. I only hoped she wouldn�t be disappointed.

&nbsp;

I had just begun to make the
final adjustments before cooking started when there was a light tap on the door
and she was standing there.

&nbsp;

�I don�t like to intrude, but how
are you going?� She smiled at me, her blue eyes shining as she did so and I
felt a stirring deep within.

&nbsp;

�I�ll be about another half an
hour, if that is acceptable for you.�

&nbsp;

�That sounds just right, I will
go and have a bath and get myself ready, I have to say it all smells
wonderful.�

&nbsp;

�Would you like me to call you
five minutes before I am ready to dish up, Miss Su �, and can I get you another
glass of wine to take with you?� I caught myself again, not wanting to spoil
what had happened so far by my impertinence. 

&nbsp;

�Yes please to both questions,
this is turning into a lovely afternoon and evening, thank you, Martin.�

&nbsp;

I felt myself blush and hurried
to busy myself with refilling her glass, which I handed to her without a word,
not trusting my voice to come out strongly enough to hide my feelings.

&nbsp;

~*~

&nbsp;

The actual meal passed in a blur,
I remember dishing it up, I remember holding her chair for her as she sat down,
I remember hoping her meal didn�t taste like cardboard even though mine did,
but conversation, actions, how long it took, none of those have stuck in my
mind. The way Miss Susan looked has though, and even now, fifteen years later,
I can still recall the light blue dress with the softly folding neck line, the
way her hair was held back in clips but fell over her shoulders in soft waves,
the sandals, also blue, with high heels and bare toes showing just a hint of a
pink varnish on them. All of that I carry with me to this day, a memory so
special I know it will never fade, never leave me.

&nbsp;

~*~

&nbsp;

When I brought the coffee to the
table and had sat once again Miss Susan put a hand over mine. 

&nbsp;

�I think we need to talk, I hope
it won�t spoil a wonderful evening, but I think it may even enhance it.�

&nbsp;

I didn�t look up, not fully; I
just glanced at her through my lashes and nodded my head.

&nbsp;

�Yes, Miss Susan.�

&nbsp;

�I think you have wanted to call
me that all afternoon, haven�t you?�

&nbsp;

I nodded, it had slipped out but,
even if I never got to call her by that name again, the powerful feeling doing
it just the once gave me was an undeniable aphrodisiac and I felt myself
stirring beneath the table.

&nbsp;

�If I asked you to kneel at my
feet would you do it?� Her tone was still light but there was a seriousness
there that couldn�t be denied.

&nbsp;

�Oh yes, Miss Susan.� I saw her
indicate with her hand and in a second I was on the floor, my hands behind my
back, head bowed, waiting for her next command.

&nbsp;

�Sit up on the chair again, for
the moment I would rather look across at you than down.� Again I obeyed
instantly putting my hands in my lap, hoping to hide how affected I was by her
words.

&nbsp;

�Martin, are you a submissive?�

&nbsp;

�Pardon, Miss Susan, a what?�
Now, looking back, I realize how na�ve I was, but at the time her question
really did confuse me.

&nbsp;

�A submissive, my sweet boy,
someone who lives to do the bidding of others, whatever it may be, both
ordinarily and sexually.�

&nbsp;

�Then yes, Miss Susan, I think I
am. My � my sisters were always in charge at home, I did what they told me to �
I was �� my voice faded away, to say anything more would be to reveal a secret
I had kept all my life, but especially in the last three years.

&nbsp;

�You were what? If we are to have
this discussion I expect total honesty from you, is that understood?� Her
voice, I noticed, had changed a little. She was still polite, still gracious,
but there was a authority there that told me she expected me to do as I was
told.

&nbsp;

�Yes, Miss Susan, I understand.�

&nbsp;

�Then continue with what you were
going to say.�

&nbsp;

�If I disappointed my sisters, or
didn�t do as I was instructed, they punished me. Sometimes I was spanked, but
also they used to stop me from � from playing with myself. Or they would order
me to play and then forbid me from cumming, Miss Susan.� I wanted to die, I
felt so humiliated, but there was an excitement as well, my cock was moving in
my pants as it grew and my breathing was getting heavier. I ventured a glance
across the table and I could see that my words were affecting my hostess as
well.

&nbsp;

�Stand up, Martin, hands behind
your back.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Miss Susan.� I stood there,
my trousers now tented for her to see and I shifted a little to try and
accommodate my increasing size a bit more comfortably.

&nbsp;

�Touch yourself, run your hand up
and down your penis through your trousers, show me how you would do that.�

&nbsp;

Without a word my hand shot to my
dick, I grasped it through the material and began to pump my fingers up and
down until I had to use my free hand to hold on to the table so excited and so
close was I to cumming.

&nbsp;

�That is enough.� Immediately I
stopped although the disappointment I felt was the greatest I could remember
and I inadvertently let out a groan of misery.

&nbsp;

�That is enough, I want
you to take everything through to the kitchen, load up the dishwasher and make
sure the room is tidy. Once that is done you will find me in the lounge. I
expect you to come in silently and, if you wish this to continue, you will
remove your clothes and kneel before me. If, on the other hand, you want our
friendship to remain just that, you will stand before me, fully dressed and we
will resume our previous relationship, is that clear?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Miss Susan.� My voice was
husky with arousal and I longed to touch myself once more.

&nbsp;

�You will keep your hands above
your waist at all times, except to put dishes away, if you don�t then that too
will end this relationship.�

&nbsp;

There was no need to answer, I
had been dismissed and we went our separate ways, Miss Susan, picking up a
magazine as she did so, headed for the lounge, while I, with a coffee cup in
each hand, walked backwards through the kitchen door and began to tidy up.

&nbsp;

~*~

&nbsp;

Thankfully, I had become tidier
over the years and in no more than ten minutes I was back in the lounge
carefully removing my clothes and folding them neatly on the floor. I then
assumed the position Miss Susan had requested of me, my cock now sticking out
at full attention and desperate to be touched.

&nbsp;

�Very well, I see you wish to
continue with our discussion of earlier. I have to say I am very pleased and
not at all surprised. I have had a feeling ever since we first talked that you
needed this type of relationship and I find myself responding far better when I
can be the dominant partner.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Miss Susan, so we are
submissive and dominant, is that right?�

&nbsp;

�You are correct, my little one,
normally you would be punished for speaking out of turn, however, you are also
very new to this lifestyle and so, for a while at least, I will be lenient with
you.�

&nbsp;

She placed her finger under my
chin and raised my face so I could see into her eyes. Once she had done that
she moved her hand and the same finger was placed over my lips, telling me to
keep quiet.

&nbsp;

�You will tell me what turns you
on, gets you excited. If you are completely truthful about this then I will
gradually remove my own clothing, if I think you are either lying or being
economical with the truth I will stop.�

&nbsp;

Gradually I began to speak, I
told her how my sisters had bent me over a chair and spanked my bottom, how
they had sometimes twisted my balls until I was crying, and about the begging
outside their rooms in the dark, desperately promising them anything they
wanted if only I could cum.

&nbsp;

Miss Susan listened, for a while
she said nothing, encouraging me with a smile or a touch of the hand, and I
continued, moving on to when Miss Fiona had shown me her body, how I had begged
to see her breasts, and how, gradually, they had instructed me in how to make
love to a woman, but only through touch. I had never been allowed to enter
them; somehow all three of us thought that was a step too far.

&nbsp;

�So, you are still a virgin?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Miss Susan, that�s true.�
By now she was down to just her bra and knickers, both of them a slightly paler
blue than her dress and underskirt which she had folded and put on the sofa
next to her. I was captivated by the way her breasts were pushed together by
the lace, how her nipples darkened the material just enough for me to see where
they were and I felt my cock get even harder as I imagined my tongue reaching
out to lick her, my fingers to touch and embrace her and I heard another moan
leave my lips.

&nbsp;

�I want you to remove my knickers
for me and then you can show me what it was your sisters taught you. If you are
a good boy I will remove my bra, and I will let you play with my breasts.� Miss
Susan stood before me and, with shaking hands, I carefully pulled the pale and
lacy slip of material down her legs and onto the floor. The high sandals were
still on her feet and she stepped elegantly out of her panties and then sat
back on the sofa, her legs wide apart and her treasures glistening and waiting
for me.

&nbsp;

In the time I had spent under
instruction from Miss Fiona and Miss Martha I had learnt a lot about what a
woman likes to have done to her. Now though I was more nervous than I had ever
been and for a moment I know it showed. Tentatively I ran my tongue across her
labia, the taste was so different, but like honey, so wonderful that I wanted
more of it and again my tongue made its way across her soft flesh. I heard her
mumble something but as it didn�t seem to be disapproving I continued, gently
laying my hands on her thighs as my tongue, flattened out, gradually licked
every surface. 

&nbsp;

�Mmm, show me more, Martin, show
me how talented you are.�

&nbsp;

I rolled my tongue and began
teasing her; I could feel the smooth edges of her warm dark slit and the juices
flowing from it. I sucked on them, I used my tongue like a straw, and then I
began to fuck her with it, darting into her, feeling her body tighten around me
as her breathing became deeper, and her hands held my hair, almost pushing me
inside of her and I waited for her to relax a moment before taking my chance
and moving out and sucking her clitoris into my mouth, nipping it, licking it,
and then letting go.

&nbsp;

�Oh, God, don�t stop, do that
again.� Of course I did. It was firmer now, easier to bite, easier to tease
this way and then I began to lick her again, only this time I dipped deep
inside of her as I went in one direction and then sucked her into me on the
return journey. Her swollen lips were so soft it was almost perfection, she
began to moan more loudly, and her breathing became ragged.

&nbsp;

�Fuck me, Martin, fuck me with
your tongue, oh, God, now, now!� In and out I went, the juices coating my face,
sliding over my tongue as I moved her closer and closer to a climax and then,
suddenly I felt her move again.

&nbsp;

�I�m cumming, ohhhh, yes,
Ohhhhhh, now!� Her whole body arched up from the sofa, her hands tangled in my
hair, pulling on me, and as she cried out I felt her flood into my mouth, over
and over as her spasms pushed more cum out of her and into me before she
collapsed back down, letting go of everything and lying breathless before me.

&nbsp;

It was only when I raised my head
that I saw she had pulled her breasts free from her bra. The dark areolas were
tight and puckered and the nipples long and bruised looking from the treatment
she had given them. I knew now wasn�t the time to touch them, she would be
coming down from her high and so I sat back on my heels, wanting to do nothing
more than wank myself off, but instead waiting for whatever instruction came
next.

&nbsp;

~*~

&nbsp;

Finally, after about five
minutes, during which time I heard her breathing gradually calm and saw her
muscles relax, she looked up at me.

&nbsp;

�Thank you, my sweet boy, that
was wonderful. Now, I want you to show me how you play with yourself, I want to
see exactly what you do.�

&nbsp;

Nodding my head and feeling a
blush rise up my face I reached down and grabbed hold of my swollen and
pulsating member. It felt hot in my hand and I could see the pre-cum on the top
so I caught it with my fingers and used it as lubrication, enjoying the feeling
of the liquid as it eased my journey down to my balls and back up again.

&nbsp;

As I continued, feeling the
excitement my movements caused, Miss Susan told me to look at her and, without
missing a beat, I did as I was told. Her bra had disappeared and she was
sitting on the edge of the sofa. As I watched she pulled on her nipples, and
rubbed her pussy as I felt myself near the point of no return.

&nbsp;

�Please, Miss Susan, can I cum,
please?�

&nbsp;

�No, my sweet boy, you may not.
It has only been a minute or two, you aren�t allowed to cum for at least
another ten.�

&nbsp;

�Oh, please, Miss Susan, please,
I can�t wait that long, what you are doing, your tits, they are � ohhhh,
please.� My hand was getting faster; I was so close.

&nbsp;

�Put your hands behind your head
� now!� I had pumped one more time after her instruction and she sounded
furious. �Are you so selfish that you would disobey me for your own pleasure?�

&nbsp;

�No, Miss Susan, please forgive
me.�

&nbsp;

This was all moving so fast, I
had started out by cooking her a meal, then she had discovered my secret,
instructed me on how things were to proceed, and now I was cringing at her tone
as she forbade me to cum.

&nbsp;

�Put your hand around your
testicles and then squeeze them, as your sisters used to do.�

&nbsp;

Again, immediately, I complied,
my hand causing me pain I knew I wouldn�t be able to minimize just because it
was self-inflicted.

&nbsp;

�They don�t look red enough to
me, squeeze harder.� Miss Susan had got off the sofa and was now kneeling right
in front of me, her breasts so close I could see them raise up and down as she
breathed, so near that if she had leant just a centimetre closer they would
have touched me, and that raised the torture level even higher as I gripped
tighter, feeling the blood flow being constricted as they began to throb.

&nbsp;

�Do you wish to continue?� Miss
Susan touched my cheek with her hand, a look of concern mingled with the
excitement I could see in her eyes.

&nbsp;

�Yes, Miss Susan, please, I don�t
want to stop.�

&nbsp;

�If you do, at any time, you must
say �rhubarb� otherwise I will ignore you. That will be our safe word.�

&nbsp;

I nodded, I had no idea what a
safe word was, all I knew was even through the pain I was so excited, so turned
on, I could, if instructed, shoot my load within seconds of touching my penis
again.

&nbsp;

Moving her hand forward she
grabbed my balls just behind where I was holding them, pulling them further
away from my body and increasing the pain into an agony. 

&nbsp;

�Play with yourself again, I
promise you, you won�t be able to cum.� 

&nbsp;

As I began once more Miss Susan
placed the thumb and forefinger of her other hand at the base of my penis, she
pressed tightly and I realized, with a rush of adrenalin, that until she
released me I was truly in her power.

&nbsp;

I speeded up, the knowledge of
what she was doing spurring me on until, even with her pressure on my shaft, I
knew I was very close. So did she apparently because again I was ordered to
stop.

&nbsp;

�No, please. Please, Miss Susan,
it�s too hard, I need to cum. I won�t touch myself all week, I�ll clean your
house, your car, please, Miss Susan, I�ll lick your pussy, I�ll make you cum
over and over, but please let me touch myself again, I need it so much.�

&nbsp;

�Stand up, put your hands
together behind your back and spread your legs apart.� The words were almost
barked and I was on my feet in no time.

&nbsp;

�Do you want to be able to visit
with me, to play with me? To see my body?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Miss Susan, more than
anything.�

&nbsp;

�More even than your need to
cum?�

&nbsp;

�I � I � no, Miss Susan.� I
almost sobbed out my answer and couldn�t look at her, so didn�t see her stand
and move towards me until she reached out and grabbed both my nipples, pulling
them and twisting them at the same time.

&nbsp;

�Arghhh, please, no, Miss Susan,
I won�t cum, I�ll play with you instead, please, I�m sorry I gave the wrong
answer.� 

&nbsp;

�Hold them, just as I am.� I did
as I was told, taking over my own torture once again, and then watched in
horror as Miss Susan left the room. I had tears in my eyes, not from the pain
but the solitude, even though it lasted but a minute. 

&nbsp;

In Miss Susan�s hands she was
holding something but I couldn�t see what. She took over the pinching and
pulling of my left nipple and then I screamed out with pain as a clothes peg
was clipped onto it. I had never felt anything like it, I wanted to drop to the
floor, to roll up in a ball, but I could do neither, and then the action was repeated,
both nipples now hurt, pulsed, burned, and I was amazed to find that instead of
my cock deflating it was, if anything, even harder than before.

&nbsp;

�Well, well, you do like the
pain, don�t you, my sweet boy?�

&nbsp;

�Yes � yes, I do, Miss Susan.
Arghhh.� She swiped her hand across the pegs, causing them to pull and pinch
even more than before and then, to my horror, she produced one more peg, which
she attached to my ball sack, and this time I couldn�t stop myself from
collapsing in agony.

&nbsp;

I wasn�t sure why, but as I lay
there I was sure the pain began to recede. I looked up; my vision blurred a
little by the tears, and wondered if I could cope with all of this. Although
nowadays I know the pain was mild, and I have suffered far more than this, it
worked because I was totally unused to it. At the time though I wondered how I
could gradually be in less pain, how I could still have an erection, whether I
would be permitted to remove them before I got dressed, but there, amongst all
those thoughts was the longing to cum, still pressing, still urgent, still my
most fervent desire.

&nbsp;

�You may stand back up now, you
have spent enough time lazing on the carpet.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Miss Susan.� I complied,
what else was I to do? What was happening was painful, but it was wonderful
too, and I didn�t want it to end, not just yet, so that meant getting to my
feet and starting over.

&nbsp;

�You may play with yourself
again, you are not allowed to cum, and you must rub your penis twenty-five
times.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Miss Susan.� I began, each
stroke pulled at the peg behind my cock, each arm movement reminded me of the
pain in my chest, and still I was excited, still I throbbed and needed release.

&nbsp;

�How many is that?�

&nbsp;

�Fifteen, Miss Susan.� I was
counting, the number didn�t seem to be getting any closer to twenty-five, but I
was still counting.

&nbsp;

�Hmm, move a little faster, a
little firmer now, if you please.�

&nbsp;

I knew it wasn�t my pleasure I
was aiming for but said nothing, instead I did increase the speed and then the
feeling inside began to increase as well and I was once again hurtling towards
my climax. 

&nbsp;

�Miss Susan.� I could say nothing
else, this would be the third denied climax, I couldn�t take more than four
without losing the plot, and it had been so long since I had been ordered by
someone to stop that I didn�t think I could stand three either.

&nbsp;

Miss Susan leant forward and
removed the two pegs from my nipples. She didn�t unclip them, but instead
pulled them off, for a second all was fine, but then the pain started and even
in my aroused state I had to lift my hands to hold them, to protect them from
the agony which coursed through my chest, and then she did the same with my
balls, the fire raced through me and I couldn�t help myself, my spunk shot out
of my cock, it pulsed out onto the floor, once, twice, three times, and each
time I cried out, in anguish and ecstasy, before I fell, twitching at her feet,
my bones reduced to jelly and my brain to mush.

&nbsp;

~*~

&nbsp;

I was so overcome by everything that had happened to me in
such a short while that I broke down at Miss Susan�s feet, sobbing helplessly,
and then she was there beside me, taking me into her arms, holding my heaving
body against her own as gradually, over a minute or two, I began to calm myself
once more.

&nbsp;

�There, my sweet boy, you did so
well for your first time. In fact I think I may reward you.�

&nbsp;

I looked up, my young, tear
stained face must have been a pathetic sight but she gave no indication of it.
Instead she caught a tear on her finger and then licked it off before moving a
little closer and placing her lips over my own for our first kiss.

&nbsp;

It was so sweet, but so
overwhelming that once again all I could do was lean against her as her tongue
gently toyed with my own, I felt her investigating, moving into my mouth and
then dancing around, so tenderly, so lightly that I groaned and responded in
kind.

&nbsp;

�Thank you, Miss Susan, that was
lovely.� I spoke as our kiss ended and for a moment she looked a little
nonplussed. �My reward, it was lovely, thank you.�

&nbsp;

Miss Susan laughed, it was a young,
free laugh, one that floated around me and lifted me.

&nbsp;

�Oh, my sweet but silly boy, that
wasn�t your reward, that was a kiss between lovers, a kiss to share and savour.
Your reward, if you still want it, is to stay, to sleep in my bed with me
tonight.�

&nbsp;

I was speechless, I had never
been offered such a treasure before and all I could do was nod, fervently, in
the hope that she would understand.

&nbsp;

�Very well, first though, I think
you need to crawl over and clean up my floor. I can�t have that mess left overnight.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Miss Susan.� I moved,
gingerly, towards the trail of cum I had spread over her floorboards and
lowered my head. I had always felt totally humiliated, licking up my own spunk,
and now was no different. It had grown cold and stringy, clinging to my tongue
and the floor like white glue, but gradually, with the remaining tremors from
my orgasm still occasionally pulsating through me, I managed to swallow my load
down before looking back towards the beautiful legs of Miss Susan.

&nbsp;

Carefully, with a smile of
approval for my actions, Miss Susan helped me to my feet, my legs still didn�t
have the strength to carry me on their own, and we walked, together, towards
her bedroom.

The sun, as it shone in through the bedroom window,
gradually woke me and for a moment I had no idea where I was. I felt Miss
Susan�s body next to mine and immediately remembered the exquisite torture she
had put me through the night before.

&nbsp;

With a smile I moved slightly so
I could lie on my back. I placed my hands behind my head and closed my eyes
once more. I didn�t want to fall asleep again, instead I thought through every
moment of the previous evening, every word, gesture and feeling, because it was
the only way I could convince myself they had all actually happened.

&nbsp;

I finished with the moment Miss
Susan had told me to lick my cum up off the floor. I was still feeling the
after shocks of my climax, it had been the strongest I had ever experienced and
all I really wanted was to lay in Miss Susan�s arms and do nothing. Instead,
once she knew I was able to take it, she made me crawl and humiliate myself in
front of her.� The results of that
humiliation though had surprised me. By the time Miss Susan helped me into her
bed my cock was hard again, not as hard as it had been, but definitely on the
way.

&nbsp;

�Ahhh, the exuberance of youth.
You are hoping for another round are you, my sweet boy?� Miss Susan was smiling
and she ran her fingers up my dick, making me gasp out, as I felt her warmth
against me.

&nbsp;

�For tonight it will be cuddles
only. You have done a lot today, all of it new, or in a new situation, I think
sleep will come very quickly once you are comfy.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Miss Susan.� I was
disappointed, but knew she was right. Now, twelve hours later, as I lay there,
my cock just stirring slightly in it�s beginning of the day hardness, I
wondered whether there would be anything more, or if I would be sent home, back
to my own little life where nothing this exciting had ever happened to me.

&nbsp;

Miss Susan hadn�t put any
nightclothes on before she got into bed and looking at her as she slept, her
body so graceful in repose, hair mussed up, her face totally relaxed and
without make-up, she was the most beautiful woman I had ever seen. I watched
her for a few more minutes before carefully climbing out of bed and heading for
the bathroom; when I re-entered the bedroom she was awake and smiling at me.

&nbsp;

�Good morning, my sweet boy, are
you going to get back in?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Miss Susan.� I did as I was
told and then watched while she took the same journey as me. It took her a
little longer though, and I was just wondering where she had gone when she
re-appeared with some soft looking material in her hands.

&nbsp;

�I don�t know about you, but I�m
not ready to get up yet. I suggest you lie back and let me take over.�

&nbsp;

I immediately did as I was
instructed, not needing to be told a second time. As I lay there, my heart
beating fast in my chest, she draped the material across my stomach and I
realised it was a selection of long scarves. 

&nbsp;

�Lift your arms above your head.�
There was no doubt about the strength in her tone and I followed her
instructions without delay. I felt her tie my wrists to the poles on either
side of the bed before doing the same with my ankles. She still had a couple of
the pieces of material across my body and she slowly lifted them so they
caressed my skin, making my muscles contract as she did so.

&nbsp;

�These, my sweet boy, may be used
later. This one, the darkest would go here.� She laid it across my eyes and
even in its unfastened state my vision became severely limited. �This one,
which is one of my favourites, could end up right here.� This time I felt the
silky sensation across my lips, �While this one, well, here seems as good a
place as any.� Miss Susan ran the scarf up my legs until it was under my balls
and then she began to move it from side to side. The sensations were wonderful
and my cock began to stand up, stirring slightly in time with Miss Susan�s
movements. 

&nbsp;

�Hmmm,� even in that one sound I
could tell that she had smiled at my reaction and then pulling the scarf
upwards until my sack popped back underneath it and she began to wind it
loosely around my hard dick before sliding it back off again.

&nbsp;

�Ohhh!� I shuddered at the
sensations I was experiencing. As much as I loved to feel my hand holding on
tight and the throbbing that firmness produced, this lightness, this
feather-like movement, was driving me towards a full erection just as quickly.

&nbsp;

�I think it looks so pretty on
your penis that I�m going to leave it there.� With that Miss Susan carefully
tied it so it was firmly secured around the base of my cock and I discovered
softness could also result in hard throbbing.

&nbsp;

�I forgot I had this, but it
could come in handy.� She pulled the scarf away from my eyes and I could see
the bow she had tied around my hard rod and also the other thing Miss Susan had
brought into the room, a Polaroid camera. Nowadays she would use a mobile
phone, but they had yet to arrive on the scene, and so this was the only
instant way to take pictures.

&nbsp;

Carefully Miss Susan lined up a
shot of me, smiling as she did so. 

&nbsp;

�I wonder if your sisters would
like a copy of this?� The idea, which horrified me, still went straight from my
brain to my cock and it got even harder. 

&nbsp;

�No, Miss Susan, please, please
don�t send it.�

&nbsp;

�Oh, why not? You look so cute,
your little penis in a fancy wrapping, your hands and feet tied tightly,
leaving your body open to me, your nipples just waiting to be pinched and
pulled. After all you�ve told me, I�m sure they would love to see you like
this.�

&nbsp;

�Please, no, please.� I began pulling on my bonds, I loved
my sisters, and they had shown me a side of myself I knew I couldn�t live
without, but if they saw this, well they might want me to tell them all about
it, might even want to tie me up in the same way, and I didn�t think I would be
able to cope with that. The two of them had taught me well, but Miss Susan was
so special to me, so wonderful, and I had begun to realise that there were
things I no longer wanted them to know.

&nbsp;

�Well, I will have to see how I
feel. Of course, you may well be able to persuade me, with your actions this
morning, that this is something we should keep between us, or between those
people I choose to tell about it, other than your sisters.�

&nbsp;

I wasn�t sure I had heard her
correctly; she was going to show photos of me to other people? Pictures of me
with a bow tied around my dick, my arms and legs secured with scarves. How
could she do that?

&nbsp;

�Now, before I take any more snaps there are a few things
we need to do. Let me see.� Miss Susan pulled open the drawer of her nightstand
and took out a shaver, not one like I usually used but a ladies pink coloured
one. As I watched in horror she began to remove all the hair from my armpits,
skating the shaver back and forth until she was satisfied that they were smooth
before moving on to my chest and removing what little hair I had there. I was
sure she was finished but then, after sliding a pillow beneath me, and with a
smile that could only be described as worrying, she moved further down, blew
across the head of my dick and then began putting some thick pink stuff on me
with a spatula! I cringed back from the cold, my cock retreating a little as well,
and then my eyes opened wide as she also slathered it on down across my anus
before finally putting everything on the nightstand and smiling.

&nbsp;

�Now what shall we do for the
time it takes to work?� Her smile was one of a cat that had found the cream,
and planned to enjoy it. She leant forward and flicked my nipples, before
gently running a long nail over my chest, down towards my dick, teasing me
successfully even though I knew she wouldn�t want to touch the glop I was
currently wearing.

&nbsp;

Finally she prodded about with
the spatula again before untying me and sending me off into the bathroom for a
shower. 

&nbsp;

�And I don�t want to see any hair
when you return, understand?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Miss Susan.�

&nbsp;

I�m not sure how I kept my cool.
All my hair was gone from around my ball sack as well as my cock and rear
passage, I knew this because when I returned to the bedroom Miss Susan made me
lie down again before she held up a mirror and then proceeded to move
everything around until I had seen it from all angles. 

&nbsp;

�I don�t usually buy this in
bulk, but I don�t want to run out. I�ll put it on my shopping list for next
week.�

&nbsp;

I didn�t want to know how often
it would be done. I had an awful feeling though that it would become a part of
a regular routine I�d rather not think about, so I just nodded and replied
meekly.

&nbsp;

�Yes, Miss Susan.�

&nbsp;

�Now, that�s done, we can have
some fun. How is your little penis feeling?� With that she flicked the top with
her finger, sending pain radiating down the shaft.

&nbsp;

�Arghhh,� I rose off the bed, but
Miss Susan just looked at me.

&nbsp;

�If I touch you, in any way on
your penis or your testicles you will show your appreciation. Is that
understood?� I nodded but soon realised that was not acceptable. �Answer my
question.� She flicked the top once more, harder this time, and I shook in
excitement and pain.

&nbsp;

�Ohhh � oh, thank you, Miss
Susan, it is feeling very full.�

&nbsp;

�Really? And these?� Again she
reached down, but this time took my balls into her hand before twisting them
around so that they were no longer facing the way they should.

&nbsp;

�Arghhh, please, Miss Susan � th
� thank you, Miss Susan.�

&nbsp;

�Please? Please what? Do you want
more?� Now she was pulling them away from my body, the pain getting more and
more intense, and then, at the same time, she suddenly took my cock into her
mouth, sucking on the tip as she continued to torture me until I couldn�t
process the feelings, the differing emotions, and I began to babble.

&nbsp;

�Ohhhh, that�s wonderful � hurts
so much � please, Miss Susan, don�t stop � no, no more, thank you, please�� My
words faded away and slowly, her eyes on my face, Miss Susan sucked up my shaft
until it popped out of her luscious mouth and stood proud. Now all I had left
was the agony in my balls, but thankfully, after one more, not so gentle, tug,
Miss Susan let them go too.

&nbsp;

�You are definitely a pain slut,
my sweet boy. Look at you, still all hard and ready for the next thing that is
going to happen to you, aren�t you?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Miss Susan, whatever you
want to do to me. I � I love it.� I blushed as I spoke; somehow agreeing with
what Miss Susan said was far harder than just going along with everything she
did.

&nbsp;

�I think so far you have had all
the fun. Now it is my turn. I am going to give you five minutes to make me
climax as many times as possible, think you are up to the task?�

&nbsp;

I didn�t know what to say, or
what was going to happen next. I had never been tied to a bed before, never
been shaved either and so, naively, I had no real idea of how I was going to do
as I had been told. I knew that my sisters could cum more than once, but I
didn�t know how many times it could happen in five minutes. How would I know if
I had been successful or not? What would happen if I disappointed her? My mind
was in turmoil and then, with far more grace than I know I would have had, Miss
Susan straddled my body and placed her fanny lips just out of reach of my own
lips and tongue. 

&nbsp;

�I am expecting great things,
Martin, after all, you did so well last night.� With that she lowered herself
onto my face and immediately I was surrounded by her wonderful aroma, by the
softness of her skin and I began to lick, backwards and forwards, lubricating
everything before I really got down to business.

&nbsp;

~*~

&nbsp;

Miss Fiona and Miss Martha had
introduced me to cunnilingus, taking me through each stage of the process over
and over again, sometimes for hours at a time. Now, as I began to suck her
labia into my mouth, I remembered and heard their voices.

&nbsp;

�Don�t nip, not until I tell you
to, ahhh, that�s it, mmm, suck me, ohhhh, yes, you are a natural.� Miss Fiona
had me on my knees, my hands behind my back and my head between her legs. Miss
Martha was sitting in a chair one hand playing with her own pussy, the other
teasing her sister�s nipples as she lay back on my bed.

&nbsp;

The softness of the skin was
always a turn on for me, I loved the feel of it, the way it moulded itself
around my tongue or parted for me as I ran the length from one end of her slit
to the other. I could feel her begin to shake and knew I was about to receive
my first reward, my mouth suddenly full of the most wonderfully tasting nectar,
it always made me speed up and her shaking became bucking.

&nbsp;

�My clit, now, as hard as you
like.� I teased my sister; my speed was gone, I licked at a normal pace,
keeping her going but not enough to take her over the edge. It was the only
time I was in that position, I was in charge, not that I�d ever admit it!
Finally I reached her little hard button and again I sucked, this time taking
it into my mouth before running my teeth over it.

&nbsp;

�Oh, God, Martin, don�t tease,
you will be sorry, if you tease ... Arghhh!� Her words were cut off by my teeth
finally taking hold of their target and this time I was flooded with juices as
her body reared up on the bed, became rigid and then collapsed back into a
flurry of tremulous movements.

&nbsp;

~*~

&nbsp;

Miss Susan tasted different, it
wasn�t unpleasant, far from it, and I revelled in the tang as slowly I built up
my speed, my intensity, just as I had been taught. I kissed along her wet,
shiny skin and, as I raised my eyes for a second, saw her hands grasping her
breasts, the nipples already tight and extended.

&nbsp;

�Don�t stop, Martin, don�t stop.�
I had no intention of doing so; in fact I was only just beginning. Last night
had been wonderful, but this morning, as the sun shone on me and I began to
suck on her petals I felt more at ease, this was my place and I intended to
keep it.

&nbsp;

I rolled my tongue as tight as I
could and firmly ran it along the surface of her lips until it disappeared
inside, sucking up juices like a small straw. My face was now close to her
skin; I�d shaved the previous afternoon, in an effort to pass the time, and my
stubble must have caused a pleasant friction because Miss Susan reached down
and pulled me even closer.

&nbsp;

�Rub me, not too much, but let me
feel it.� Her words, coming out in short gasps, only spurred me on and as I
fucked her with my tongue I let my chin move against her, my nose pressed up
against her clit and my hands held in tight fists.

&nbsp;

I don�t know how long I
continued, I felt Miss Susan move forwards a little and I stopped the rubbing,
but instead I traced my tongue up until it was nudging her clit, causing more
moans and another pull on my hair. 

&nbsp;

�Use you fingers, push them in
me, now!� Miss Susan moved off me as she spoke and I did as I was told, the
squelching noises the action caused only making me more excited and I used my
other hand on her clit, not hard, but firm enough to make her squeal out and I
increased the pace of my two fingers forcing their way in and out, over and
over, until her vagina began to tense up, to tighten, and then, after a moment
when all was quiet and still, apart from the noises I was making, a torrent was
unleashed, of words, actions and love juices.

&nbsp;

�Oh, oh � I�m � now, Martin,
don�t stop, cumming � cumming ARGHHHHH!� Miss Susan�s body arched up but I
refused to relinquish my grip on her, instead I continued fucking her and
playing with her, keeping her in suspended animation until she could take it no
more and collapsed back onto the bed where her eyes closed and her body, for a
minute at least, shut down.

&nbsp;

~*~

&nbsp;

I learnt during breakfast that
Miss Susan was an interior designer. She worked at home because by the time she
had driven into town all her ideas had evaporated into the smog and pollution.
Her ambition, she said, was to become respected enough to be able to move out
into the country, set up a studio there and not have to worry about the city at
all. 

&nbsp;

That dream came true when she was
chosen to work on one of the first reality DIY shows on TV, and now our home is
a beautiful Tudor mansion on the edge of the New Forest, the stable block has
been converted, she has a studio there and I have an office. I run a very
successful builders� merchants and specialist renovations company and have even
appeared on shows with Miss Susan explaining some of the work that needed to be
done before her finer details could be started.

&nbsp;

The third stable in the row is
kept locked during the day, or whenever we have business clients visiting us.
When it is open though my life takes on a decidedly different hue, I am no
longer the respected managing director, but a sissy slave who gets off on being
humiliated, punished and sometimes even ignored totally. 

&nbsp;

I am jumping ahead though, which I wanted to do, but not quite
so far. The day I have in mind began to get exciting and worrying as I finished
clearing away the breakfast dishes about three months after that first meal and
six weeks after I had moved in with Miss Susan. One of her friends, Miss Lucy,
who knew my status in life, was also there, having stayed overnight. I had
wondered what would happen, fantasizing a little about threesomes, extra
humiliation and denial, but it had been instead an evening which I had spent
alone, Miss Susan and Miss Lucy having gone into town to catch a show and a
meal, activities I wasn�t included in. I had been asleep in Miss Susan�s bed
when they returned, but I had set up the sofa in the lounge so that Miss Lucy
wouldn�t need to do anything but wash and go straight to sleep.

&nbsp;

�Well, my sweet boy, I�ve
finished re-decorating your bedroom. I know you have been anxious to get in
there, too anxious in fact. Before you are able to see it, there is the little
matter of punishment for your inability to adhere to my instructions.� Miss Susan
spoke to me as she ate her breakfast.

&nbsp;

�Yes, Miss Susan.� I was standing
beside my mistress�s chair, my duties over for the moment, and as my cock
stirred in my panties Miss Susan saw it.

&nbsp;

�Martin.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Miss Susan.�

&nbsp;

�Are your knickers getting too small
for you?� She reached out and grasped the head of my cock, squeezed it so I
could feel her nails, and then let go. I had been horrified when Miss Susan had
told me that I would only wear my panties to serve breakfast, just as I did
when we were alone. That had been bad, but now she was talking about them and
playing with me at the same time.

&nbsp;

�I � I don�t think so, Miss
Susan.� I had clenched my fists so I didn�t cry out, but I know the pain
sounded in my voice.

&nbsp;

�Oh, only they do look a little
snug, don�t you think, Lucy?� Her friend nodded in agreement, enjoyment obvious
in her eyes. �How long have you had those pretty things?�

&nbsp;

�A week, Miss Susan.�

&nbsp;

�And how long have you been
wearing knickers?�

&nbsp;

�Two months, Miss Susan, I
think.� I wasn�t totally certain, and so looked up anxiously.

&nbsp;

�Tell Miss Lucy why are you
wearing them?�

&nbsp;

I didn�t answer, my face flushed
as pink as my panties and I looked down to the ground. I saw Miss Susan stand
up and then felt the leather of her crop, which she always kept close by, as
she placed it under my chin and raised my eyes to hers.

&nbsp;

�I do believe I asked you a
question. What happens when you do not answer these questions? Especially in
front of visitors?�

&nbsp;

�You beat me, Miss Susan.�

&nbsp;

�Beat? Beat? That is such an ugly
word. Chastise, Martin, I chastise you. So, this is your final chance, why are
you wearing panties?�

&nbsp;

If Miss Lucy hadn�t been there,
hadn�t been smirking and enjoying my discomfort I think I would have been able
to reply, but as it was my lips wouldn�t work, my brain refused to send the
correct signals and I remained mute.

&nbsp;

�Assume the position.� 

&nbsp;

I couldn�t believe Miss Susan
would do this not in front of someone, and yet, as much as I would rather the
ground swallow me up, my heart rate increased and I felt the familiar buzz of
excitement that went with abject humiliation.

&nbsp;

�Yes, Miss Susan.� I had various
places where my punishments would take place. In the kitchen it was over the
island. This was one of the most painful as the front was solid and each stroke
of the hand, whip or cane smashed my dick against the wood, but painful or not
my erection could not be kept at bay.

&nbsp;

The dining area was sparsely but
beautifully furnished, there was an octagonal shaped table with a middle leg
that had base supports coming out from it. My position was to lie across the
top with my legs spread wide. I was then attached by my ankles to two of the
supports, leaving me vulnerable to whatever type of reprimand Miss Susan
decreed.

&nbsp;

The fact that the table was
wooden in the middle with a clear glass outer rim only showed my reactions all
the more clearly and, as I took up my position, Miss Lucy realised if she
remained in her seat she had an uninterrupted view of all the action. Miss
Susan walked round behind me and pulled my pink panties down to my knees, where
they were stretched out, a constant reminder of why I was in this position in
the first place.

&nbsp;

�For your refusal to follow
instructions this morning I will strike you ten times with the crop. You will
be given the chance after five to tell Miss Lucy why you are wearing panties.
Once they are done you will receive another ten.�

&nbsp;

�Why, Miss Susan?� The breakfast
things had been moved aside and I was now tied, my feet immovable and my hands,
which had no actual support to be tied to, were grasping the edges of the table
and I knew better than to move them so I was unable to look anywhere but
straight at Miss Lucy.

&nbsp;

�Are you questioning me?� Miss
Susan ran the crop across my buttocks as she spoke and I shivered.

&nbsp;

�No, Miss Susan.�

&nbsp;

�Good, now as I was saying,
before I was so rudely interrupted, you will receive another ten for peeking in
your new room before it was done. And don�t deny it, I know you have been in
there.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Miss Susan.� My voice came
out as a whisper, and I wished fervently that I hadn�t allowed myself to open
the door and look at all Miss Susan had done for me while she had been out the
previous evening. Now my shame at being caught was absolute and I knew I
deserved that part of my punishment unreservedly.

&nbsp;

�You will keep count.� With that
the crop descended, forcing my body against the table and my need for a deep
intake of breath.

&nbsp;

THWACK

&nbsp;

�One, thank you, Miss Susan, more
please.�

&nbsp;

THWACK

&nbsp;

�Two, thank you, Miss Susan, more
please.�

&nbsp;

THWACK

&nbsp;

Now they were really beginning to
hurt and, as I continued to count, my voice wavered.

&nbsp;

�Th � three � thank you � Miss �
Susan, more please.�

&nbsp;

THWACK

&nbsp;

�Arghhh � please � Miss Susan � f
� f � four � thank you.�

&nbsp;

THWACK

&nbsp;

The fifth one was the hardest so
far and my tears were now dripping onto the table, my knuckles were white and I
hurried my reply out so as not to annoy Miss Susan further.

&nbsp;

�Now, my sweet boy, would you
like to tell Miss Lucy why you wear panties?� Miss Susan ran her long nails
over my hot cheeks as she spoke and the pain increased.

&nbsp;

�Please � please, Miss Susan,
don�t make me.� 

&nbsp;

�Very well, you will have another
five, if you cannot tell then I will increase your punishment for this offence
by five more and so it will go on until you do as you are told.� Miss Susan�s
words hung in the air and I shuddered. My mistress was very strong, the force
of each stroke would knock me off my feet if I weren�t supported by the table
and I didn�t think I could cope with the extra strokes and then my bedroom punishment
on top of that. 

&nbsp;

�I will try to tell her, Miss
Susan.�

&nbsp;

�I�m glad to hear it, you may
begin. Oh, and as I expect you to play with yourself as you do so, I suggest
you stand up.� My feet were released and I stood before my Mistress and her
friend, my panties now around my ankles and my cock already throbbing in
anticipation of what was to come.

&nbsp;

My hand began to play with my
shaft, a blush rushing up my chest and onto my face as I began to talk,
explaining, maybe more than necessary, to Miss Lucy about what had happened.

&nbsp;

~*~

&nbsp;

The early stages of our
relationship had been wonderful. Miss Susan had indeed sent me home on that
first Monday, but only because she had an appointment to keep. As I worked for
the rest of the week and was usually tired by the time I arrived home we
arranged for me to once again spend the weekend with Miss Susan. Our weekend
though began on Saturday evening and ended on the Monday. 

&nbsp;

This I told Miss Lucy as my hand
moved gently along my shaft, which I now knew, thanks to Miss Susan�s tape
measure, was almost six and a half inches long when fully erect. Gradually,
over the first month I had been introduced to more and more things. The bulk of
them to humiliate or hurt me and pleasure Miss Susan.

&nbsp;

On the second Saturday evening I
had once again cooked the meal, Miss Susan telling me how she enjoyed working
in the kitchen, but was quite happy to hand the responsibility to me whenever I
was there. After our meal was eaten I had been shaved again, and Miss Susan had
told me to bend over the table for the first time.

&nbsp;

�This, my sweet boy, is one of my
favourite things. You will find out that it is one of yours too.� The words,
although not a command, seemed to me to be an instruction I would do well to
follow, although at that moment I wasn�t sure what she meant. Then I felt
something warm drip down my bottom and I tried to stand, to move away.

&nbsp;

�Oh no, you stay right there.�
Her hand slapped against me and I froze just in time to feel her begin to rub a
finger down between my cheeks until she stopped right on the tight little bud
that resided there.

&nbsp;

�Relax, my sweet boy, take a deep
breath and push backwards.� 

&nbsp;

My hand was moving faster on my
cock now and I tried to slow down. Miss Susan had been right, I did enjoy it,
but that day it had been painful, painful and humiliating, and I�d loved it
all. 

&nbsp;

�Ohhh, Miss Susan, no, not there,
it hurts too much.� The finger up my anus was probing, feeling its way and I
thought my legs would falter.

&nbsp;

�Shhh, this is nothing, it will
get easier and you will soon be able to take far more, and keep it in for as
long as I tell you.�

&nbsp;

�Arghhh.� Another finger had
joined the first and I banged my fist on the table, �Please, Mistress, no �
ohhhh!� I felt my cock lurch and saw, to my amazement, cum leak from its tip.

&nbsp;

�That, my sweet boy, is your
prostate! I can make you cum any time I like, and even with all your strength
of mind, you won�t be able to resist.� 

&nbsp;

Just to prove herself Miss Susan
massaged my prostate until I shot a load underneath the table, splattering it
against the upright where it promptly began running down to pool on the floor.

&nbsp;

~*~

&nbsp;

�Please, Miss Susan, Miss Lucy,
may I cum now?� I had never related my sexual escapades to anyone other than
Miss Susan before and couldn�t believe how horny it made me feel.

&nbsp;

�No, of course not. This is an
exercise in punishment not reward.�

&nbsp;

�I�m sorry, Miss Susan, Miss
Lucy, please forgive me.�

&nbsp;

�Continue and I will think about
it.� The riding crop came down on my backside and I took a step forward.

&nbsp;

�Thank you, Miss Susan, for
reminding me of my place.�

&nbsp;

~*~

&nbsp;

I had been made to lick up my cum
that day and from then on my anus was regularly violated. Miss Susan had been
right, it did get a little easier with practice, and I did enjoy it. Sometimes,
with clothes pegs on my nipples and my balls, my cock done up in a pretty bow,
she would fuck my arse until I was almost incoherent with lust. I would beg on
my knees to cum, licking her pussy, sucking on her wonderful tits, doing
whatever she wanted, but almost every time I was denied and she would leave me
alone without permission to touch myself and relieve the pressure.

&nbsp;

That pressure had built up
gradually, until six weeks ago she had tormented me for more than two hours.
The pegs had been taken off and replaced over and over, the blood rushing back
to cause pain, and then been restricted again, causing more pain. My cock,
encased in silk from base to tip had been stroked, licked, flicked and had the
scarf unwound countless times and in the end I had begged her to either let me
cum or to stop. I had never asked Miss Susan this before.

&nbsp;

She knew how much I loved her
tits and held them in front of me, just far enough away that the tip of my
tongue couldn�t reach them. I had been attached to the bedpost, sometimes
standing, sometimes kneeling, depending on my mistress�s whim, but now I was
leaning as far forward as I could.

&nbsp;

�I will stop, even though you
haven�t used your safe word, but not because you want to, but because I have
some work to complete. You will stay in here until I call you.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Miss Susan.� She untied my
wrists but left everything else attached to me, and made her way towards the
door.

&nbsp;

�You may not cum, my sweet boy,
remember that.�

&nbsp;

I wasn�t sure what to do; if I
lay down on the bed I knew I would rub myself against the covers, dislodging
the pegs and making myself cum all over the sheets. If I kept my hands in front
of me I knew my cock would be held in a split second and so I paced, first of
all around the bed, then back. I went into the bathroom, I even considered
tidying it, but my arousal was such that it was a futile thought.

&nbsp;

Finally, I returned to the
bedroom and sat on the bed. The top drawer of Miss Susan�s nightstand was
slightly open and I pulled it a little more until all her tiny, sexy knickers
were exposed to my view. Without thinking I pulled the top pair out, they were
pink, the lace was sheer and as I held them to my nose I inhaled the scent of
her washing powder as well as a lingering aroma of her perfume. 

&nbsp;

I heard myself groan and before I
knew it the silk scarf was on the floor, my cock was wrapped in the flimsy
material and I was rubbing myself frantically knowing I wouldn�t be able to
stop. The denial, along with the eroticism of Miss Susan�s underwear, sent me
over the edge and my spunk shot out into the lace in four strong spurts.

&nbsp;

For a moment I sat, trembling
with the exertion of such a powerful ejaculation, and then, closing my eyes as
I did so, I raised the panties to my lips and began to suck the cum from them.

&nbsp;

�Well, this is a pretty sight.�

&nbsp;

I turned quickly, losing my
balance and falling to the floor, the messy knickers in my hand and cum on my
lips as I tried to scramble to my knees and beg for forgiveness.

&nbsp;

�So, you like my panties do you?
So much, in fact that you disobey a direct instruction in order to play with
them. Did I tell you that you were not to cum?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Miss Susan.� I couldn�t
look up, but equally I couldn�t let go of my prize. 

&nbsp;

�And not only do I find that you
have disobeyed, but you have rummaged through my belongings. Crawl to me!�

&nbsp;

~*~

&nbsp;

My hand was pumping again, my
breath coming in gasps as I looked at my mistress and Miss Lucy.

&nbsp;

�Please, Miss Susan, I need to
cum, I � I can�t hold it.�

&nbsp;

�Very well, you know what you
must do, don�t you?�

&nbsp;

�Yes � Miss Susan.� I picked up
my knickers from the floor and wrapped them around my cock. Telling Miss Lucy
was one thing, actually performing for her was another, and for a moment my
excitement faded, but the feel of the material, the sensation as it slid up and
down my skin soon began to work and my cock extended out from the end of the
panties, hard, engorged and ready for release. 

&nbsp;

�Please �� I fell to my knees, my
whole being was concentrated in my cock and I knew without her permission I
would be in big trouble.

&nbsp;

�What do you think, Lucy, should
we allow him to ejaculate?�

&nbsp;

Miss Lucy leant down and took a
closer look at my dick. 

&nbsp;

�Oh yes, I think so, but only if
he eats it all, every last drop, from wherever it lands.�

&nbsp;

That was it, as I heard �yes� I
roared, and the first part of my load shot out and onto the floor almost two
feet in front of me. The rest of my cum followed, some of it also hitting the
floor, the rest running down to soak into my knickers. I carefully ran them up
my now shrinking dick and caught every last drop before raising the panties to
my mouth and sucking the creamy liquid in.

&nbsp;

�I used my cane on him, front and
back until I was sure that he had learnt his lesson.� Miss Susan took over the
story, knowing I wasn�t able to form a coherent sentence, let alone finish my
tale. �When I finished I realized he still had the knickers in his hand and
that was when I decided if he liked them so much, he would wear them instead of
me. I allowed him to wash and keep that pair, but not until he had worn them
for the rest of the day. I told him I wouldn�t want them back, and every now
and again I make him cum in them and then wear them, as he did that first
time.�

&nbsp;

�What, even to work?�

&nbsp;

�Martin?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Miss Lucy, I always wear
ladies panties underneath my overalls when I am working, I�m not allowed to
wear pants any longer.�

&nbsp;

Miss Lucy laughed. It was a
pretty, sweet noise, but still I blushed. No one had known my secret, but now I
had been forced to share. The excitement of that was making my heart continue
to race, even after I had come down from my sexual high, and I wondered eagerly
how long it would be before Miss Susan decided to tell someone else of our
secrets.

The noise from Miss Susan�s party
told me that everyone was having a good time. It was the second gathering she
had hosted inside three days but for her at least, this was the far more
enjoyable. The first get-together, a celebration of Miss Susan�s new job on
national television, had been for colleagues from work, business clients, and
her bank manager. Although Miss Susan worked at home she still had people she
saw maybe three or four times a month when she went into town to discuss her
plans and ideas. I had been present for the whole party, resplendent in a new
dark blue suit with a shirt in a paler shade and a dark tie. I had thoroughly
enjoyed myself, standing at her side, not quite an equal but obviously her
personal guest for the evening.

&nbsp;

Tonight though was entirely
different. Tonight I was dressed in new clothes once again; only this time the
colours were blue and pink with frills. I had on a pair of panties, which were
underneath a pair of tight jeans. Once I had finished the cooking I had changed,
there was no top laid out for me and I knew I would be on display. To my horror
I had seen that the jeans, although smart and tidy were worn very low on the
hips whereas my panties were much deeper and no matter how I tried I couldn�t
get the denim to hide the lace band at the top. I realized this was no error on
Miss Susan�s part and, swallowing hard, had left the room for my inspection
only to have the panties pulled up even higher, giving me a very uncomfortable
wedgie and the guests an uninterrupted view of my underwear. It also gave me a
very hard cock; I loved the feel of the silky material, and the knowledge that
everyone was in no doubt as to what I was wearing and why. I knew I would be in
a constant state of arousal until I was allowed release.

&nbsp;

We had been together for five
years, I was a boy no longer, my work had given me, so Miss Susan told me, a
body to be proud of, and she intended that I should show it off for her friends
who either practised a similar lifestyle to our own, or at least knew all about
it. I had done this on numerous occasions in the past but never to so many at
once. The whole thing was a bit daunting to say the least.

&nbsp;

For now though, I was not needed, there would be no place
for me at the dinner table, and I had finished all the tidying up. I slipped
out through the kitchen door, down the hallway and into my own room, closing
the door tightly behind me. The bed wasn�t used very often, I spent most nights
with Miss Susan, but it was there for when she was away or if I had been
punished by isolation. It was also used for teasing, torture and all the stages
in-between. The bed had four posts, one at each corner and there were holes at
different heights going up. Sometimes I was cuffed to them, or tied with
scarves. My ankles could also be attached higher than my wrists leaving me open
for all sorts of different activities!

&nbsp;

There were straps too, which came across from the sides
and held my legs if I was on all fours, or could be used with the ones at chest
height to hold me immobile but with my hands free to pleasure my Mistress.
These were hidden under the bed for the most part, but would set my pulse
racing even if I just saw them when I was cleaning.

&nbsp;

With the meal in full flow and the pet of one of Miss
Susan�s friends providing a waitress service I undid the snap on my jeans,
pulled them down a little and then lay on the satin sheets, which Miss Susan
insisted I use. My dick felt so wonderful encased in its silky sheath and for a
minute I ran my hand along its length, enjoying the sensations while knowing
that I would be in for a very long night. I had a ring around my cock which
also separated my balls and made it extremely difficult for me to cum, even
with permission, and I had no doubt that I would be expected to show everyone
what happened to me while I was wearing it before the evening was over. 

&nbsp;

I lay back and closed my eyes, but just knowing that the
conversations around the table in the other room would be centred on sex,
bondage and experiences that Miss Susan and her friends had shared made it
impossible for me to think of anything but my relationship with my mistress. I
would be expected to retell the details of some of our sessions when I was
called into the dining room. Ever since the day I had told Miss Lucy why I was
wearing panties Miss Susan had insisted that I spend some of each social
gathering being a storyteller. Tonight would be no different, except for the
size of the audience, and that thought excited me, causing me to get even
harder. There were three men here this evening, I had never told another man
what I did, or why. That too would change tonight.

&nbsp;

I must have dozed off; I remember hazy images from a dream
of Miss Susan and her guests, holding the type of lorgnette that a decorated
mask could be attached to, coming towards me, touching, sometimes kissing,
sometimes slapping, and laughing, always laughing. I knew I was on my knees,
crying tears of desperation whilst anxiously listening for Miss Susan�s command
to cum.

&nbsp;

�Martin, you need to wake up now.� Miss Susan�s voice and
her hand on my shoulder finally broke through my cobweb filled mind and I
opened my eyes.

&nbsp;

�I�m sorry, Miss Susan.� I leapt to my feet, pulling my
jeans over my now fairly soft erection and blushing profusely as I saw the door
was wide open and I could be seen by all of the guests who were in the hallway
looking in my direction.

&nbsp;

�Yes, well, your tardiness will have to be dealt with
later, but now you are needed in the lounge.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Miss Susan.� My heart sank, I hadn�t meant to fall
asleep but it had been a busy week and it had also been the first time I�d had
to myself for at least three days. Slowly I knelt down at Miss Susan�s feet; I
didn�t want to leave the room without her knowing how sorry I was.

&nbsp;

�Go, I said we will deal with this later. Do not annoy me
further.� 

&nbsp;

It was obvious that, for the time being at least, I could
do nothing right and so I once again got to my feet, but this time I did as I
had been told.

&nbsp;

~*~

&nbsp;

The lounge had only been re-decorated a month earlier, the
cream and fawns I had become so used to being replaced by more citrus-based
yellows, oranges and greens. I hadn�t liked the idea when Miss Susan first
mentioned it but none of the shades were bright and as she had applied her
magic touch a wonderfully calming oasis had risen before my eyes and now I
loved it.

&nbsp;

There were, just for a few days, the addition of
congratulatory greetings cards from Miss Susan�s friends and family, all of
them delighted she was to be a regular presenter on one of the most popular DIY
shows on television. Miss Susan was already looking in the newspapers and
specialist journals for a place in the country where we could live our lives in
a way that suited us far more than the restricted and cramped conditions of her
flat allowed. 

&nbsp;

The six guests were all seated comfortably, brandy
snifters in the hands of the men and white wine for the ladies. Miss Susan was
very conservative in many ways, rules were to be adhered to and I knew, once we
did move out of the town, she would expect the men and women to part company
and enjoy separate activities after dinner was finished.

&nbsp;

I noticed that the pet who had been waitressing was bent
over slightly as she leant against the wall next to the coffee table, her skirt
lifted up and tucked into its own waistband and I looked over at Miss Susan to
find out what was going on.

&nbsp;

�Before you take centre stage, my sweet boy, Jade is to
receive ten strokes with the crop for spilling coffee over the lap of Miss
Lucy.�

&nbsp;

I turned and saw Miss Susan�s best friend was now wearing
one of my mistresses evening gowns and I had an awful feeling I should have
been awake to help her change. As if reading my mind Miss Susan spoke to me
again, her voice loud enough for everyone to hear.

&nbsp;

�I expected you to be available to assist Miss Lucy, as it
was she had to deal with a sobbing Jade and a coffee soaked gown alone. For
that you too will receive ten strokes once the first punishment has been
carried out.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Miss Susan.� I averted my eyes, it was still unusual
for me to be punished in company, and I wanted to turn and run. No one would
know that I was dreading it however, for my cock pushed against the strong
material of my jeans, tenting them as much as it could and the thought of
everyone seeing me being reprimanded made me groan aloud.

&nbsp;

Jade was the pet of one of Miss Susan�s male friends and
he got to his feet, placed his cigar in a large crystal ashtray and then took
the crop into his left hand from its place on the coffee table next to the
shaking young girl. It always looked very long, thin and dangerous to me, but
in the hands of a six foot three, ex-rugby player it took on the appearance of
a tooth pick and I began to wonder whether it would survive long enough to be
used on me.

&nbsp;

�Do you know why you are being punished this way, wench?�
The voice, deep and Welsh, resonated around the room causing the tension to
increase by at least six notches. 

&nbsp;

�Yes, Sir. I � I was clumsy and I spilled coffee on Miss
Lucy. I apologise to her and you, Sir, it was an accident.�

&nbsp;

�I see, do you apologise to me for humiliating me in front
of my friends, for showing them what a useless piece of baggage I have to carry
around with me, or are you just doing it to save your arse?�

&nbsp;

�No, no, Sir, I know I deserve to be punished, I am
apologising because I have upset you and your friends. I wouldn�t do that for
the world, Sir, I love you and I�m truly sorry.�

&nbsp;

I don�t know what it was about hearing someone else beg
for forgiveness but I found myself very aroused and anxious to see the
punishment being carried out.

&nbsp;

The gentleman, who I knew was called Master Jack, raised
the crop and swung it through the air with a swish. Jade shook visibly but the
leather didn�t make contact with her lily-white skin.

&nbsp;

�You will count for me. Are you ready?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Master.�

&nbsp;

SWISH

&nbsp;

�One, Master.�

&nbsp;

SWISH

&nbsp;

�Two, Master.�

&nbsp;

The sound of the leather as it struck home was so loud
that there was no doubt it was also extremely painful. Everyone watched,
fascinated, and I knew when my turn came I too would be the focus of everyone�s
attention. I heard Jade call out ten through her tears and swallowed hard,
praying that I wouldn�t let Miss Susan down any further.

&nbsp;

�As you don�t have a little skirt on you will remove your
jeans for me.� Miss Susan�s voice had changed; it was now hard and cold. She
was in control and I knew that to consider doing anything other than obey her
would be futile.

&nbsp;

I carefully stepped out of my trousers, folded them in
half and placed them on the floor by the side of one of the armchairs. 

&nbsp;

�Such pretty panties, don�t you agree, Jack?� Miss Susan
spoke to the Master who had just finished his own punishment.

&nbsp;

�Very pretty, you spoil him, Susan. Come here, boy.� 

&nbsp;

I did as I was told, not wanting to infuriate this man,
who had the ability to render me a gibbering idiot should he choose.

&nbsp;

�He is rock hard, Susan, I thought this was supposed to be
a punishment.� His hand around my cock felt so different to that of my
Mistress. Where hers was soft and gentle, his was hard, calloused and more than
a little rough.

&nbsp;

�He gets off on the pain, but I make sure it hurts him
too. I have other punishments, but not ones that are suitable to complete
whilst you are here.�

&nbsp;

�Let me deal with him. I�ll make sure he remembers this
for a long while.� Master Jack smiled, earlier in the evening it made him look
younger, more handsome, but now it only succeeding in making him even more
scary than he had been just minutes before.

&nbsp;

�What a wonderful idea. Martin, thank Master Jack for
offering to punish you himself.�

&nbsp;

�Please, no, Miss Susan, please punish me. I am yours.� I
was panicking, babbling, as I usually did when things got too far out of
control for me, but Miss Susan laughed, the fury in her eyes reserved just for
me.

&nbsp;

�Get over to the wall, the punishment will now be fifteen
strokes and crawl.�

&nbsp;

I fell to my knees, I already had tears in my eyes, and I
made my way across the room to sniggers from the two men and three women who
were watching the scene unfold.

&nbsp;

�Stand, boy.� Master Jack took my hair in his hand and
helped me to my feet. I still wore it long and he was able to get a firm hold.
�Your mistress treats you very well and this is how you repay her, I have to
say I am appalled. You will assume the same position as my wench.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Sir.� I did as I was told immediately. At least
standing that way I wouldn�t be able to see my audience.

&nbsp;

�I don�t think I will remove these, they suit you far too
well.� Master Jack paused for a moment and I wondered what he would do. His own
pet had been naked under her skirt and so her panties hadn�t been a problem.
�Instead I think you should keep them like this.� He grabbed a hold of each
lacy leg and then forced them up into the crack of my arse until both cheeks
were exposed and the front portion was doing nothing more than moulding my cock
and balls to its own limited shape.

&nbsp;

�So, boy, do you have anything to say before we begin?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Sir.� I didn�t move from my position, knowing that
would only increase my punishment. I wasn�t used to being cropped in this way
and I felt very vulnerable. �I am sorry I fell asleep and was unable to attend
to my duties. It won�t happen again. I deserve all of my punishment and would
ask you to begin when you are ready, Sir.�

&nbsp;

�Very well. You too will count.�

&nbsp;

SWISH

&nbsp;

�One � Mi � Sir.� I hadn�t had the luxury of a slight
pause and the crop seemed to leave an indentation so deep that it should have
reached my bones.

&nbsp;

SWISH

&nbsp;

�Ow � two � Sir.�

&nbsp;

The second strike seemed to be in almost the exact same
spot as the first and when the third one landed there also I knew Master Jack
was placing his strokes exactly where he wanted them for most effect.

&nbsp;

SWISH

&nbsp;

�Three � Sir.� I could feel tears now and willed them
away. I could also feel my cock straining against my panties and I didn�t know
whether I wanted to protect or pump myself. Before I could think straight the
fourth strike made contact, harder than the previous three and I moved forward
a step as I was enveloped in pain.

&nbsp;

When the fifteenth strike had been completed I collapsed
to the floor, tears on my face and pre-cum staining my panties. I was breathing
so hard I could see bright lights in front of my eyes and I was a mass of pain.
I felt the crop as it was pushed against me, Master Jack was searching out my
hard on, and then he used a hand to press my back to the carpet and all the
guests could see my shame.

&nbsp;

�You can have a minute, then I will expect you to be on
your feet, understand?�

&nbsp;

�Yes � yes, Sir. Master Jack.�

&nbsp;

I know I had a little longer than that while the merits of
the punishment were discussed as if I wasn�t there. Jade had disappeared, I
didn�t see her again for the rest of the evening and no explanation was given
for her leaving. Finally I was made to kneel in the middle of the room after my
panties were removed and, with one hand on my rock hard cock, and the other
massaging my heavy balls, I began telling stories of my humiliations over the
years until I was begging to be allowed to cum in front of them all.

&nbsp;

Miss Susan, who seemed to have passed my ownership to
Master Jack for the evening looked in his direction when I had been refused
permission for the fourth time. She knew I wouldn�t be able to hold on very
much longer and I watched in apprehension as the tall man came over and, once
again, hauled me to my feet.

&nbsp;

�So, boy, you want to cum do you?�

&nbsp;

�Yes � please, Sir. I need to cum so badly. Please let me,
Sir, please.� I wanted to fall to my knees once again but Sir still held me by
my hair and then he reached out and placed his other hand around my throat.

&nbsp;

I looked round in panic but Miss Susan was sitting,
watching and obviously enjoying my predicament, as were her other guests. The
pressure on my throat increased and I felt myself gagging against Master Jack�s
hand until gradually I began to slip away and then I was gasping for air as he
let me loose.

&nbsp;

�Leave us. Do not touch yourself until Miss Susan gives
you permission and be thankful that you don�t live with me!� Master Jack
grasped my cock in his hand and then used my own lubrication to twist it around
as he took my balls in his other hand and twisted them in the opposite
direction. I cried out in agony, falling to my knees, which only made matters
worse. Once I was down he let go and then, as if I no longer existed, turned
and made his way back to his seat, leaving me rocking in agony, my own hands
now cradling my genitals as I tried to regain some composure.

&nbsp;

~*~

&nbsp;

The things that happened to me at the party caused me to
retreat inside myself and nothing Miss Susan did could change my mood or my
memories. I felt betrayed by her because she hadn�t stepped in to rescue me. I
also felt I had let myself down, not once arguing or walking away from a
situation I wasn�t happy with. I hadn�t even thought of using my safe word
until I was actually quite safe behind the closed and locked door of my own
bedroom huddled under the covers shaking and crying long after the guests had
left and Miss Susan had given up trying to get me to let her in to comfort me.

&nbsp;

I had sold my flat four years earlier and so had nowhere
to go to work through my confused thoughts and mixed up feelings. In the end,
after a brief telephone conversation with my boss, I decided to go home for a
long weekend to visit my parents and then do the tourist thing in London. None
of my sisters lived at home and it was strange arriving at an almost empty
house but, once I was settled back in my old room, in some ways I felt as if I
had never left.

&nbsp;

My mother was, I knew, itching to ask me what had happened
but she was a model of constraint, and she even kicked my father underneath the
dining table when he ventured to mention Miss Susan and our relationship. I
slept until gone ten on both the Saturday and Sunday I was there, and only got
up at nine on the Monday morning because I had a train to catch at eleven.
After all my years away it was nice to go back, there was no pressure, no
expectations to live up to, we just visited, chatted about old times and
relived memories which were pleasant and in some cases hilariously funny. By
the time I was sat in my seat on the train on the way to London I realised that
although I hadn�t solved any problems I had relaxed and that in itself made my
struggle less arduous and definitely less of a challenge to deal with.

&nbsp;

London was its busy self and for four days I wandered
around soaking up the ambience, the history and the crowds and again enjoyed
the relaxed atmosphere and this time the anonymity that went with it. I began
to find myself again, to understand what it was I wanted and didn�t want from
my life and lifestyle and when I climbed into a taxi at our local train station
a week after I had left I was more certain of what I had to do to get the
future I deserved.

&nbsp;

Miss Susan was out, it was a Friday and she would be in
town for her usual meetings and planning sessions. I retrieved my car from the
private car park and set off for the supermarket once I realized that there was
nothing at home to eat and I was, for the first time in a week, starving.

&nbsp;

I heard the key in the lock a little after seven and
walked out of the kitchen to see Miss Susan standing in the hallway looking
more vulnerable and unsure of herself than I could remember.

&nbsp;

I had changed out of my holiday gear and was wearing a
pair of older jeans; less restricting than the new ones I had worn the last
time I was home, and a t-shirt, which said �kiss the chef� on it. I had no idea
what to say and so instead I indicated with my hand and let practicalities take
over.

&nbsp;

�The meal will be ten minutes, so you have time to get
freshened up if you wish.�

&nbsp;

�Thank you, Martin. I�ll do that.� Miss Susan disappeared
into her room and I returned to the kitchen. My heart was beating so hard and
loud in my chest that I was sure it would stop at any moment. I continued with
what I was doing until I was aware of Miss Susan in the other room and then I
began to serve up the first course before returning to the dining room and
taking my seat at the table.

&nbsp;

We ate in almost total silence, Miss Susan asking a few
questions about my trip but I didn�t feel like talking and in the end she gave
up. The meal was delicious, I had spent a lot of time on it and I could tell it
was appreciated. Once we had finished Miss Susan retired to the lounge and I
went into the kitchen to fetch the coffee. When I went to join her she looked
at me and I saw a tear make its way down her cheek.

&nbsp;

I stood before her, naked, as I had the first day we dined
together, hoping that she would see this gesture for what it was, my clumsy way
of trying to move forward whilst at the same time turning the clock back to
redefine our relationship. I moved closer and fell to my knees, resting my
forehead against her legs as I waited for her to speak.

&nbsp;

�Martin, I need you to tell me what is going on. I am
truly sorry for what happened last week and I can promise you that Jack won�t
be invited to any further parties I host.�

&nbsp;

I looked up, my own tears not too far from the surface,
but I knew now wasn�t the time for me to break down or falter. 

&nbsp;

�I was wrong for falling asleep, but it was a genuine
mistake. I had put a lot of effort into your parties, when I had the chance to
finally relax I just drifted off.� Miss Susan nodded her head, but I didn�t
give her the chance to speak. �I know in the lifestyle we have chosen to live
together I deserved to be punished, but not by a stranger, and not in front of
other people unless I agreed to go along with it. Miss Lucy was one thing, but
five guests I didn�t know, that was too much. I felt more than humiliated, I
felt used, and I get no pleasure from that.�

&nbsp;

I moved back a little, I no longer needed to rest my head
on her legs; instead I needed to see her reactions clearly, not by peering up
at her.

&nbsp;

�I could have used my safe word, I don�t deny that, but I
was so terrified, so out of my depth, that it never occurred to me. I did all
that you asked of me, all that you needed, last week, Miss Susan, but you did
nothing that I needed from you. You promised, early on in our relationship,
that it would be fully consensual, we seem to have moved away from that.�

&nbsp;

I looked down, Miss Susan was crying openly now and I felt
awful but I knew I had to continue.

&nbsp;

�I should have said all of this last week, but I couldn�t.
I loved you then and I love you now, but I didn�t have it in me at the time to
even rationalize how I felt and what I wanted to do next, let alone explain it
to anyone else. Now I do and I have. The rest is up to you.�

&nbsp;

I stood up and put my hands behind me. I wanted Miss Susan
to see that I was still hers, but more than that, I wanted her to see that I
trusted her. We had both apologised, and now she had to make up her mind what
she wanted from our relationship; for all I knew Miss Susan had made life
altering decisions while I had been away too. She may no longer wish us to have
any type of commitment to each other.

&nbsp;

�Thank you, Martin, for coming back. I know you kept in
touch, told me where you were each day and what you had done, but until I saw
you this evening I had no idea if you would ever call this home again.� Miss
Susan paused and wiped her eyes. �I have learnt a great deal this week, about
you, about myself, about us. I don�t want to lose you, not even for a minute.
You mean more to me than the lifestyle, the dominance or submission, you are
the man I want to spend the rest of my life with. I promise you, with all of my
heart, that I will never, ever mistreat or let you be mistreated again and I am
truly sorry that it happened even once. Please forgive me.�

&nbsp;

I nodded, I had run out of words and then Miss Susan
patted the sofa and I was beside her, not beneath or behind but beside her and
we were kissing, kissing as lovers do, and I knew I was home.

&nbsp;

~*~

&nbsp;

The next year was a whirlwind. Miss Susan�s programme was
a huge hit not only in the UK but also in America and we travelled extensively
for almost nine months. Our relationship was back on track and we enjoyed
getting to know each other again, taking each step openly and honestly, and
enjoying every moment. 

&nbsp;

While we were away the builders were also very busy,
converting the stable block at our new home into two offices and one totally
bare but comfortable and functional room. Miss Susan had done all the interior
design work, but it was actually carried out by colleagues of hers that she
trusted well enough to make her house a home. We had wandered around, hand in
hand, from room to room once the travelling was over for a while, both of us
excited and almost speechless by what we had achieved.

&nbsp;

I had taken over the builders� merchants I had been
working for since I was nineteen and I was now branching out into specialist
areas that catered to the type of projects that were becoming more and more
popular due to all the DIY shows on television. I was getting work on cable
channels myself, and Miss Susan had decided that, if things continued the way
they were, we would be able to retire in ten years. 

&nbsp;

All of that though was far from my mind at I stood in our
new playroom, a room that Miss Susan had personally furnished, a room I hadn�t
been allowed to see until it was completed. I was naked, as I often seemed to
be these days, but I was more than confident in my relationship and my
appearance and didn�t mind at all. At twenty-seven I had very little in common
with the scrawny nineteen year old that Miss Susan had smiled at in the hallway
of our old building. I still knelt at her feet, still licked her pussy until
she screamed, and would do anything if only she would let me suck her tits, or
even better, fuck my cock through them until she would step back, leaving me
panting and desperate to shoot my load all over her nipples so that I could then
suck and lick it off.

&nbsp;

I had already been laid out on the rack, my arms pulled to
their limits, my legs also, and then, with my head raised a little so I missed
nothing, I had watched while first of all Miss Susan had pulled at her nipples,
licking them as she pushed them towards her beautiful ruby red lips. I longed
to reach out, to touch them as well, or to have them dipped into my mouth so
that I could suckle on them. That wasn�t to be though, today was a special day
and I had been told that good things would come to me only if I waited. Miss
Susan just hadn�t said how long that wait would be.

&nbsp;

Miss Susan had sat on me as I lay stretched out and
vulnerable and I had sucked and nibbled at her until she had come over and over
again, screaming out my name as she did so before leaning forward and taking my
dick into her warm mouth and sucking me off until she felt the familiar
sensations that meant I was close to cumming and then she had climbed off me
and the rack and, almost nonchalantly, placed a bag of crushed ice on my cock
and balls and laughed aloud as I shrank down to minimal proportions. That
delightful torture had been repeated over and over, the heat of Miss Susan�s
mouth followed by the agonizing cold of the ice, until I was crying and pleading
for release, any sort of release.

&nbsp;

I had then been freed but only so I could be bent over a
horse; a padded one like the gymnasts� use, and my hands had been cuffed at
each end, my ankles were secured to the legs and I knew I was in trouble. A cat
o nine tails had been used all over my back, the strands often finding their
way between my legs and around my balls. I cried out, begging to be released,
but Miss Susan had just smiled and struck me again. She had moved around so she
stood in front of me and then the smile had got wider as she produced a pair of
nipple clamps joined in the middle by a chain which she proceeded to attach to
me, tightening them until my tears fell and I was begging to be free.

&nbsp;

�My sweet boy, I have no intention of freeing you, in fact
I may keep you here all night, after all, no one can hear you, or even knows
the room is used for this purpose. I could leave now, draw the curtains and
lock the door. You would be stuck until I returned. Of course, the painters
will be here tomorrow, I could just ask them to open up for me.� Miss Susan
pulled on the chain as she finished speaking and I moaned. The picture she
painted, of the deprivation and the humiliation at being discovered, was
turning me on even more than I was already and I felt my cock throb as she
spoke. 

&nbsp;

�Please, Mistress, may I cum? Please.� I knew I would be
denied, but I loved the idea of being naked and helpless and Miss Susan knew
it.

&nbsp;

�What would you do? If I let you ejaculate that is?�

&nbsp;

�Anything, anything, Miss Susan. You could beat me, I
would suck your pussy every night for a week and not ask to cum at all. Please,
Miss Susan � plea �Arghhh.� I felt her hand wrap itself around me and then
slowly, so slowly she began to pump up and down.

&nbsp;

�You may not cum, I don�t think you need it enough yet.�

&nbsp;

�Ohhhh.� I couldn�t believe it. She was playing with me, I
could feel her other hand at my anus, first one finger, then two, then three
inside me, moving in rhythm with my cock and driving me mad. I tried to pump
back, tried to speed things up but Miss Susan just flicked my cock and forced
her fingers apart in my arse and then suddenly she was gone, no contact, hardly
any sound and tried to move, to see where she was, but couldn�t.

&nbsp;

�Beg me, my sweet boy, beg to suck my penis, beg for
that.�

&nbsp;

I jumped at the sound but nodded. I didn�t know what she
meant but I was so desperate now I would have agreed to just about anything. 

&nbsp;

�I�ll suck you, Miss Susan, if you had a cock I would suck
it, I would take it all the way down my throat like you do for me. Please, Miss
Susan, pretend you have a cock so I can suck it, then we can cum together.� I
was getting into this, my mouth was making the noises Miss Susan made when she
worked her way up and down my dick and she moved in front of me again and I
could see she had put on a sort of harness with a long flesh coloured dildo
attached to it.

&nbsp;

�Oh, God!� My words came out as a groan and I felt my
spunk boiling in my balls. �Please, Miss Susan, fuck my arse, let me suck you
and then fuck me.� Six years we had been together and Miss Susan had never
shown any inclination to use this type of thing. I had taken a dildo up the
arse, but usually they had been put in and then my panties had been pulled up
high and I would walk around all day on a Saturday with it in place. This was
different, exciting, scary, and wonderfully different.

&nbsp;

�I will release your arms, I want you to hold your little
cheeks open for me. I am going to make love to you, my sweet boy, and you will
cum when I tell you to.�

&nbsp;

There was no danger of me not following that instruction.
I was so hard, so excited, I was worried I would shoot as soon as Miss Susan
penetrated me, but then the ice appeared again and, as I was lubricated from
behind, the cold seemed to reach my core.

&nbsp;

Once I was ready Miss Susan moved around the front and
slid a large mirror underneath the horse. When that was done she carefully put
a pair of my panties about six inches from the end of the glass. 

&nbsp;

�If you can reach your little knickers I will let you wrap
my undies around your penis and make yourself cum for me.�

&nbsp;

�Thank you, Mistress.� My voice was more of a plaintive
cry than anything else. The thought of being given permission to do one of my
favourite things was almost too much for me, and I had to will myself to ignore
my own dick as I watched Miss Susan�s large cock in front of me and then I
tentatively stuck my tongue out and licked at the phallus.

&nbsp;

�Take it, take it all.� Miss Susan pushed into my mouth,
slowly at first, but then with firmer strokes until I was gagging and the head
was banging against my throat. I tried to remember things I had read or watched
and began swallowing. I wasn�t as good as my Mistress, but I did manage to get
almost two-thirds of it in my mouth before Miss Susan kindly removed it.

&nbsp;

�Are you ready?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Miss Susan.�

&nbsp;

She moved around behind me and I made sure that her path
was unhindered as I held myself apart for her. The first feeling was a shock
and I know I moved away from her. It seemed so big, so solid, but so was I. 

&nbsp;

�Push back.� I did as I was told and gradually, very
slowly I was impaled on my love�s cock. Nothing could have prepared me for the
feelings that flooded through me. I felt subservient, empowered, used and
controlling. Each time Miss Susan thrust into me I fucked her back until she
was so far in I could feel the heat from her body against my cheeks. 

&nbsp;

�You may let go now and I want you to pull on your nipple
clamps � harder.� I managed to keep the chain up so that Miss Susan could see
what I was doing. The pain was exquisite, mingling with those from my butt and
almost causing me to go into sensory overload.

&nbsp;

�Please, Miss Susan, may I touch my cock now, please?�

&nbsp;

�You may hold it, but no movement.�

&nbsp;

I did as I was told, but I so wanted to begin pumping, and
in the end, after no more than thirty seconds, I could hold back no longer.

&nbsp;

�Please, Mistress, please, I can�t � please let me move.�

&nbsp;

�Good boy, you have done so well. You may cum, play with
yourself and shoot your load as far as you can.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Miss Susan.� The words came out as a sob and I began
to pump away, my hand becoming a blur in the mirror beneath me. I was crying
out, the pressure building, my balls were churning, my cock, shiny, hot and so
hard suddenly jerked in my fingers and the spunk shot out, it flew over the
mirror, past my panties and landed on the floor just in front of them.

&nbsp;

�Arghhh! Ohhh, God!� I was being held up by the horse, my
legs no longer had any strength in them and then I felt Miss Susan speed up
again.

&nbsp;

�I�m � oh, Martin, I�m cumming, I am cumming and fucking
your arse. Ohhhhhh, Ohhh, yes, YES!�

&nbsp;

With her cock still deep in me Miss Susan collapsed across
my back. She reached round and pulled off the nipple clamps and I cried out
again, but far more weakly than usual. Then we just lay there, neither one of
us wanting or being able to move. 

&nbsp;

Gradually though the world came back into focus and we
both stirred. Miss Susan stood up, removed her harness and then crouched down
to release me. Once that was done she turned me around and held me close as we
kissed.

&nbsp;

�Well, my sweet boy, I think we just consummated our
marriage, what do you think?�

&nbsp;

�Oh, yes, Miss Susan, and it was wonderful, thank you.�

&nbsp;

�You are welcome, lets go in and run a nice hot bath and
just relax for a while.�

&nbsp;

I didn�t say anything, instead I nodded and took hold of
her hand, her wedding ring glinting in the late afternoon sun as we opened the
door and walked, naked, across our garden and into the beautiful lounge of our
new home. As we closed the patio doors Miss Susan pressed gently on my shoulder
and I dropped to my knees beside her. She placed a kiss on my head and I looked
up in adoration. It wasn�t for everyone, this lifestyle we had chosen, but now,
as the husband of the most wonderful woman in the world, I knew I had found my
place in life, and no one can ask for more than that.

&nbsp;

The End.
