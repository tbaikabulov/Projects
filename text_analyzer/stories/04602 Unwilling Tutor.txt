Chapter 1. Caught

&quot;Harder, harder!&quot; Kathy
McPherson yelled at the burly rugby player ramming his cock into her young
cunt. His wasn't the first cock that night to find its way into her body, nor
would it be the last. Lying naked on the bed, her mind in an alcohol and
cannabis induced haze, she had already serviced three of the team inside her
vagina and sucked two of them off. Three more of the team stood alongside the
bed, watching and waiting their turn and encouraging the others to give her
what she wanted. She was no stranger to gang-bangs but preferred to be the only
female in the room at the time. Then she was the centre of attention. Attention
she craved, but never received at home.

The morning after, and indeed the
following days, were always a bitch. Kathy could cope with the soreness in her
cunt but her throbbing head and the sick feeling in her stomach from the booze
and the drugs, often made her regret the night's enjoyment but by the next
weekend she would be ready and willing to do it all again. It was akin to an
addictive drug; the more she had, the more she needed. On numerous occasions
she'd sworn never to do it again but always there was an invitation to a party
that just couldn't be turned down, a party that was just another excuse for a
sex orgy. 

Only a week previously Kathy had lain on
her bed, jackhammer noises battering the inside of her skull and the smell of
vomit pervading the room where she had thrown up into the wastepaper basket and
hadn't the energy to empty it down the toilet. &quot;Why do I do this to
myself?&quot; she asked repeatedly. &quot;Why do I accept these invitations?
Why do I drink so much? Why do I toke those ciggies? Why do I allow so many
boys to fuck me? Why? Why? Why?&quot; She knew the answer. &quot;It gives me
friends. It gives me status. I feel wanted and liked. But is it for the right
reasons? Would I have friends if I didn't let the boys fuck me? I enjoy some of
the fucking. It gives me a buzz especially when I'm high on the smokes but
after the first one or two, it gets a bit routine. There's a sameness about it
all unless one of them actually tries something different, but that's not very
often. All I have is the soreness and the after effects.&quot; Once more she
resolved to give up going to the parties, a resolution she broke the following
weekend.

It all started when she was thirteen and
her woman's body was developing rapidly, her breasts had sprouted and she'd
begun to flirt with boys. And she had money to spend. Her father, whom she saw
sometimes at weekends and more rarely late in the evening, was extremely well
off and overly generous in her allowance but less so in the time he accorded her.
For some years since her mother died, she'd been looked after by a succession
of maids and babysitters but when she turned fifteen, she rebelled against
being watched over and more or less looked after herself. Her generous
allowance allowed her to almost buy friendships. Frequently she would pay for
everyone's drinks at McDonalds or whatever joint they decided to visit after
school, it bought her the attention she missed at home. 

&quot;We're going to watch one of my
dad's video's after school, you wanna come?&quot; Mary Flately asked.
&quot;Mum's out till late and dad's away again so I'm having a few boys and
Jeanie round too. The videos show real fucking, not like the sex education muck
they show us at school. You wanna see the real stuff?&quot; Mary was two years
older than Kathy and had already had a number of boyfriends. Kathy decided
she'd nothing better to do and she heard about sex videos but had never seen
one. &quot;We'll probably do more than watch,&quot; Mary laughed when Kathy
agreed to go.

They certainly did more than watch. In
the middle of a raunchy scene where a young girl was sucking at two cocks while
her cunt was being fucked by a third, Mary hit the pause button and announced,
&quot;Okay, time for some action here too. Everyone strip off. Let's see those
cocks boys.&quot; Kathy hesitated but when the others all started removing
their clothing, she decided she would have to as well if she wanted to be 'in'
with this older group. From the way they all undressed quickly, Kathy realised
they had done this before. None of them showed any embarrassment at showing
their bodies and the boys sported erections which they proudly displayed to the
girls.

As soon as she was naked one boy picked
her up and sat her on his lap and sucked her tits and fingered her cunt. It was
already wet from watching the video and it was becoming wetter now that the
film had been restarted. &quot;You're tight,&quot; the boy commented, &quot;You
done it before?&quot; Blushing, Kathy shook her head. &quot;Well you will have
by the time you go home,&quot; he grinned.

&quot;Make sure you use a condom
Pete,&quot; Mary ordered and tossed him a foil packet from a box by her side,
&quot;She won't be on the pill and we don't want her getting preggers and
causing us problems. Play with her and let her watch Jeanie and me for a
bit.&quot; Jeanie was already on her back on the rug being fucked by Ron. 

For a while Kathy's attention was shared
between the TV screen and what the other two girls were doing. Pete played with
her for a while longer and then put his hand on his hard prick. &quot;Suck it
like that girl.&quot; Pete nodded to the TV where the girl had the boy's cock
halfway down her throat, or so it seemed. By now she was well aroused and slid
to the floor and started to suck the hard prick. &quot;It's about time you put
this on I think Kathy,&quot; Pete suggested and handed her the condom. She
fumbled with the packet but eventually got the rubber on him and then lay down
on the settee. Pete opened her legs and slid his cock in a little way, pulled
back and then thrust home. &quot;Virgin no more!&quot; he laughed. 

Kathy felt the stab of pain but it wasn't
of much import and the full feeling and sensations coming from Pete's fucking
were far nicer than she had with her fingers. &quot;Ummm! That's nice,&quot;
she groaned. The others had stopped and watched as Pete took her maidenhead and
now praised her. Kathy was elated and started thrusting back at Pete like she
had seen the other two girls do. 

&quot;Suck this,&quot; the other boy,
whose name she didn't even know, offered his cock and she took that in her
mouth although she had a job keeping it there with Pete banging into her
vagina. 

Three of the four boys fucked her before
she went home later that evening and possibly her desire for multiple fucks
stemmed from that first time. Mary helped her get the contraceptive pill
without her father knowing and thereafter, her desire for sex seemed
insatiable.

&nbsp;

&quot;Oh shit!&quot; Kathy cried out in
alarm waking both of the boys alongside her. &quot;It's 6:30. Dad will probably
be up when I get home. Another fucking row I suppose. Oh shit, my head
hurts.&quot; Unsteadily she climbed out of the bed and quickly dressed, leaving
off the unessential items like her bra and underclothes. The remains of the
party were scattered everywhere. Bottles, crisp packets and full ashtrays
littered all the rooms and a few of the other partygoers were sleeping in
various states of undress. Kathy hurried past them and out into the cool of the
early morning. The cool air made her head spin as she tottered homewards.
&quot;Not much life on the street yet. Perhaps he won't be up. Shit! Why does
every passing car and lorry make so much noise? Fuck, my head thumps. I do hope
dad's not up yet. Can't face a lecture from him at the moment.&quot; She
tottered up the long drive to the house and went in through the back door.
Slipping off her shoes she crept through the kitchen and along the hallway.
Nobody about. &quot;Got to have a bit of luck sometimes,&quot; she muttered as
she eased the door to her bedroom open.

&quot;Good morning Kathleen&quot; On the
bed waiting for her, sat her father. Kathy knew she was in trouble when he called
her Kathleen.

&quot;Not now daddy, I don't feel up to a
lecture now.&quot; She went to move passed him but he blocked her path. 

&quot;No, I suppose you don't. First
though, go and have a shower. You smell like a sewer. I presume you have
something for your hangover in your bathroom.&quot;

Kathy, surprised that he hadn't launched
into a tirade of abuse at her behaviour, suspected he had something else up his
sleeve. Something she wouldn't like. She took her time over the shower but
eventually emerged from the bathroom wearing a thin robe. The Anadin's were
beginning to kick in and the Alka-Seltzer had eased her stomach a little but
she still felt extremely tired and very uneasy. &quot;Take your robe off and
stand in front of the mirror Kathleen,&quot; her father ordered.

&quot;What so you can see me naked? I
don't think so. You perverted or something?&quot;

&quot;No Kathleen, it is you I want to
look at your own naked body. Have a good look at it. Look at it closely. Look
at the colour of your skin now that it isn't covered with make-up. Is it the clear
fresh skin of a seventeen year old or that of a woman twice your age? Do those
love-bites enhance your appearance?&quot; Kathy didn't answer but burst into
tears. &quot;Okay, cover yourself up again and come and look at these
pictures.&quot;

Sullenly Kathy peered at the laptop her
father was firing up. On the screen came a picture of her at the party last
week. She was naked and being screwed by two boys. He father clicked to the
next picture and the next. Picture after picture of her having sex with various
boys at last week's party. He clicked again, &quot;I haven't had chance to
enhance these yet so they're still a bit on the dark side but you can see the
pictures clear enough for now,&quot; he informed her and on the screen appeared
pictures of her with the rugby boys last night.&quot; Kathy could hardly see
them through her tears. It was so humiliating. 

&quot;How? How did you�?&quot; she asked.

&quot;That doesn't matter and that is
only part of what we need to talk about. How well do you think you've done in
your exams so far?&quot;

&quot;Oh shit, no!&quot; Kathy quickly
realised the school had phoned her father. She knew she would fail everything.
She hadn't bothered to answer most of the questions and on the science paper,
she'd only managed to put her name on before she fell asleep at the desk.
&quot;Well they shouldn't have had it first thing on a Monday morning. I hadn't
recovered from the weekend.&quot; She wasn't worried; she didn't need to work.
Daddy would keep her. &quot;What are you going to do?&quot; she asked trying to
sound nonchalant.

For an answer he emptied the contents of
her purse on to the bed, picked out all the credit cards and put them in his
pocket. &quot;From today, you will not have any credit. From today, you will be
given �2 a day to get a lunch at school and no more. From today, you will be
confined to the house unless I take you out and on schooldays for the few weeks
left of this school term, you will come straight home. A driver will pick you
up. Over the summer holidays, you will make up for all the schoolwork you have
missed.&quot;

&quot;You can't! I won't! I can't believe
you are doing this to your own daughter. Your only daughter. You can't make me
do this!&quot;

&quot;I can and I will Kathy. I know much
of this is my fault. I should have kept a closer eye on you for years but I let
my work come first. Now you have got yourself into such a mess that it is going
to take drastic measures to get you out of it.&quot;

&quot;But all my friends will�&quot;

&quot;You haven't any real friends Kathy,
only people who want you for what you can give them, whether it is money or
your body. I know how difficult it is to distinguish between true friends and
those who are just scroungers. I know. Having money makes things difficult as
well as easy. It gets you material things but not true friends. I know, I
really know,&quot; he mused and after a pause went on, &quot;Now I suggest you
go to bed and sleep off some of the excesses of last night and think about what
I have said.&quot;

&nbsp;

Chapter 2. Appointed tutor

&quot;What can they want me for?&quot;
Puzzled David Miles looked at the letter again. The embossed heading stated
that it came from McPherson Associates, a big stockbroking and insurance firm
in town employing several hundred people. After a little preamble, the letter
said, &quot;I have a proposition I wish to put to you and would be pleased if
you could arrange an appointment�&quot; It was signed Graham McPherson,
Managing Director. David read it again, &quot;It says, 'I have a
proposition...' not we have a proposition so it seems to come from him
personally. He's signed it; it isn't a pp signature from his secretary. What
can he want? I have no interest in the brokering or even the insurance
business, none at all.&quot; 

&nbsp;

&quot;My word you are a bean-pole and no
mistake,&quot; the young receptionist remarked as David shambled to her desk in
the foyer of the plush office block of McPherson Associates, &quot;You must be
seven feet tall.&quot; Her smile nullified any offence the remark might have
caused. &quot;Another student looking for a summer job, I suppose,&quot; she
thought but said nothing.

&quot;Not quite. Six foot eleven.&quot;
David straightened himself to his full height.

&quot;Wow! I'm five ten but I have to
look up to you. And you're so slim with it.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, tell me about it,&quot;
laughed David, &quot;And I wear a larger size hat than most people, when I wear
a hat at all.&quot;

&quot;Sorry, I shouldn't have spoken to
you like that. I hope you're not offended,&quot; the girl apologised.
&quot;What can I do for you? Looking for a summer job?&quot; By his untidy,
shabby clothes, she'd correctly labelled him as a student but had wrongly
guessed his reasons for being there.

&quot;No miss, I came to see Mr.
McPherson.&quot;

&quot;You'll need an appointment to see
him. He's the boss and normally only the more important clients get to visit
him�&quot;

&quot;I have an appointment. He asked me
to see him and I phoned yesterday. Talked to his secretary, Tracy.&quot; David
cut into the spiel the girl had used many times. 

The receptionist looked up in surprise.
&quot;Perhaps he is more than a student. Perhaps if he really has an
appointment with the boss, he will report me and get me sacked. Better be nice
to him.&quot; Out loud she went on, &quot;I'm sorry sir, I shouldn't have
assumed�Your name sir, please.&quot; 

&quot;That's okay Lisa, I'm David
Miles,&quot; David read the name on her badge, &quot;And I don't know why I'm
here either. It's not the sort of place I would want to work in.&quot;

Lisa became a little more concerned when
she phoned through to Mr. McPherson's personal assistant and was told to escort
him to her immediately. &quot;This way please sir,&quot; she said after putting
the phone down. She again worried that she'd committed a faux pas. She was
never told to escort any but the most important clients. The boy seemed unaware
of the privilege and she gave a little smile when he automatically ducked on
entering the lift although the door was probably high enough even for him.
Moments later he was sitting in a plush chair in front of the boss's desk.

&quot;David,&quot; Graham McPherson
started after the usual introductions, &quot;I wish to offer you a special
position for your summer vacation�&quot;

&quot;I don't need a job, sir. I have
other work I wish to do. Father left me well provided for and I am continuing
some of the research he started and will use that for my Open University degree
thesis. I'm having to do that through the OU because I'm too young to go to a
main university.&quot;

&quot;I know about that David and you'll
largely be able to continue with you own work as well. They say you are going
to be another genius like your father. It was a sad loss when he was
drowned.&quot; Graham paused and then asked, &quot;Do you know my daughter,
Kathleen McPherson?&quot;

The question took David by surprise.
&quot;Yes sir, she's in my form but I don't see much of her. Normally I would
have similar classes to her but I did all the exam work they're doing two years
ago and now I spend most of my school time with the upper sixth or doing the OU
work.&quot;

&quot;You don't know her socially?&quot;

&quot;Sir, I don't know where this is
leading. I hardly know your daughter. I'm not into girls. My size makes that
awkward and girls shy away from me, and me from them for that matter. She is in
a different social class to me all together. We've hardly spoken since junior
school.&quot; David was more worried now. Was he being accused of having a
relationship with Kathy? If so what was the 'position' they wanted to offer
him?&quot;

*****

Kathy was still pissed off with her
father. It had been two weeks since his ultimatum and not once had she been
allowed out on her own. Each night a car collected her from school and brought
her home where an elderly woman supervised her and was under strict orders from
her father to ensure she behaved. Of course Kathy kicked against the regime
whenever she could and stubbornly refused to do any schoolwork and indeed for
the final two exams she didn't even put a name on her paper. Twice she'd
managed to escape but each time, the security firm Graham McPherson employed to
watch her, brought her home. Each time she'd been locked in a small, almost
bare guestroom without TV, radio or her music centre. Only her school books.
Now the exams were officially over she should have been free for the summer but
her father still refused to release her. She cajoled, she pleaded, and she
swore, all to no avail. Having no money of her own didn't help either. For the
first two days, she threw the �2 back at her father and went without lunch
except what she scrounged from her friends but after two weeks, these friends
had drifted away and her bad moods and temper, brought on by her frustration,
didn't encourage them to stay.

&quot;We have a guest for dinner tonight
Kathleen. Dress nicely but casually, its not a formal affair,&quot; her father
informed her. 

&quot;Sod off! Look after your own
fucking guests!&quot;

&quot;Do it or I will send the two J's to
bring you down, however you are dressed.&quot; 

The two J's were Jake and John the men
who watched over her. She knew they would do whatever they were told and her
efforts to seduce them had so far been unsuccessful. In protest she wore her
jeans with the knees worn through, a check shirt knotted around her waist and
her hair held in a ponytail with elastic bands. &quot;I'm not going to bother
with make-up either, then he can see just how badly I'm treated,&quot; she told
her reflection in the mirror. &quot;Sod him. Perhaps we'll have some wine
tonight and I can sneak an extra glass or two.&quot;

A knock at the bedroom door and the voice
of the maid announced, &quot;Dinner in ten minutes miss.&quot;

&quot;Maybe there'll be drinks before
hand, I'd better go down and see.&quot; She made her way downstairs and bounced
in an unladylike way into the dining room. She stopped in mid-step.
&quot;Streaky! What are you doing here? Daddy, you surely didn't expect me to
dress for this long length of piss? I don't believe it.&quot;

&quot;No Kathleen, I didn't expect you to
dress for any guest of mine and by the look of you, I was right. Now miss I
advise you to watch your words because David here is going to be in full charge
of you for the next few weeks. He's your summer school tutor.&quot;

&quot;You've got to be fucking
joking!&quot;

&quot;Sorry, I am perfectly serious and I
have given David clear instructions to use whatever methods he deems
appropriate to see that you get enough work done to pass your exams when they
come up again in November. I've also given him permission to punish you in the
good old fashioned way if you do not do as you are told.&quot;

&quot;So I'm going to be imprisoned in my
room for the whole summer while Mr. Bighead Brainbox tries to teach me things I
don't want to know and have no intention of learning. No way!&quot;

&quot;I'm sorry to hear that miss,&quot;
David butted in, &quot;But no, you won't be imprisoned here. I have studying to
do as well and I can only do that on the water so you will be living with me on
my old trawler moored on the River Sturt. We get to it from Brightwell Quay and
it's about a mile from there out towards the sea. It's got most of the usual
conveniences although some may seem a little primitive by the standards
here.&quot;

&quot;I'm not going! I'm not living with
you on a bloody pokey little boat.&quot;

&quot;You aren't being given a choice
dear,&quot; her father pointed out. &quot;You see, while the two J's had you
under surveillance, they also found evidence of your using drugs and noted who
the dealers were and we've photographic evidence of that as well as the sexual
things you did. You wouldn't be very popular with your erstwhile friends if
that evidence should fall into the hands of the police. In fact, their bosses
could get very nasty towards you.&quot;

&quot;You're blackmailing me?&quot;

&quot;Yes, if that's the way you see it.
Now shall we eat? I know David wants to get away quickly so he can get to the
boat before dark.&quot;

&quot;You bastard! As a father you're
crap!&quot; She turned to leave but Jake stood in the doorway. &quot;Fuck
you!&quot; she snarled at him and returned to the table. The meal was taken in
an uneasy silence. Kathy managed to get three glasses of wine before the bottle
was removed from her reach. David didn't touch it because he had to drive. He'd
only had his license a few months and had no wish to lose it.

&nbsp;

Chapter 3. Prison ship

Shivering in the cool late evening air,
Kathy clung to the safety ropes on the rubber dinghy as it bounced and bucked
through the slightly choppy water. David steered it deftly and speedily through
the moored boats causing them to rock shortly after they passed. &quot;You'd
best put on a jacket or warm sweater,&quot; David advised before they left but
she'd disregarded his advice.

&quot;Sod and bugger the fucking boy, why
does he have to be right. Hope it's not far to the boat thing he lives on. God,
how did I get myself into this mess? How am I going to get myself out of it?
Not much hope of escape unless I learn to drive this thing or we go ashore and
I'm not being spied on.&quot; On the journey to the quay she sat alongside him
in the car, never once speaking but her thoughts were all concentrated on why
she was in the mess and how could she get out of it. It was only a half-hour
drive and with the two J's following, there was little chance of escape there.
They'd helped her into the boat and loaded her suitcases and even waved as they
sped away. Knowing her father, they would be watching somewhere.

They turned a bend in the river and, with
the wind now more to one side, the spray started to fly over the boat and began
to soak Kathy. David slowed the outboard a little, removed his jacket and,
without a word, wrapped it around her. Kathy tried not to acknowledge his
kindness but found herself giving him a slight nod. It was all the thanks he
was likely to get. The light was fading fast as they arrived at the trawler and
David quietly brought the dinghy alongside. All Kathy really noticed was the
numbers painted on the bow BL143 and the fact that it didn't look all that big.
&quot;Sit still for a moment,&quot; David ordered. Kathy immediately tried to
stand, the boat wobbled and she fell back again. &quot;For once in your life,
do as you're told. I've no wish to search for you in the water in this
blackness or call out the lifeboat.&quot; His voice, though still quiet, was
full of menace. Her falling had prevented David from tying the dinghy to the
boat and it drifted astern in the strong current. He started the outboard again
and motored back. This time he successfully moored the dinghy and transferred
Kathy and her stuff to the deck and escorted her below. 

&quot;It stinks of bloody fish! You don't
expect me to live in this smell do you Streaky?&quot; Kathy complained as soon
as she entered the saloon but David took no notice. The fish smell was not
strong and he was used to it.

Half an hour later they sat opposite each
other in the saloon drinking mugs of chocolate. Kathy glared at him to try and
show her fury at her treatment but David just looked at her and wondered if he
would really get to fuck her. He'd given her a quick tour of the boat but still
she refused to speak to him except simple yes or no answers to straightforward
questions. She had to smile at the way he automatically ducked at every door
and the main beams that ran across the boat at intervals. It seemed so
incongruous that someone as tall as David should wish to live on a pokey little
boat with limited headroom.

She'd seen the small cabin with the extra
long but none too wide bunk bed. The mattress looked hard and she wondered what
it would be like to sleep with him. So far he had not make any sexual move.
&quot;I wonder what he will try and do to me tonight? Will he try some of the
old-fashioned discipline daddy mentioned? Will he tie me down? Make me recite
my times tables? Give me a lecture on Einstein's theory? Will he fuck me? Will
he make me walk the plank? I could use a beer or two. Bet he doesn�t even have
any on board this tub.&quot; Suddenly it all seemed too much for Kathy. Tears
sprang to her eyes. &quot;What are you really going to do with me you lanky
fucker? How much did daddy pay you to take me off his hands? This tutoring
stuff is all a scam isn't it? Are you going to beat me? Throw me overboard out
at sea?&quot; Kathy spat the words at him.

&quot;Kathleen,&quot; David spoke in his
usual quiet way, &quot;Firstly, your father did offer me a lot of money to
tutor you. He also showed me the pictures of you at the parties and said I
would be able to have sex with you without any problem. I refused the money and
refused the job but he can be very persuasive and upped the stakes a few times.
I said that if I took money it would be like paying for sex and you'd be a
prostitute and he would be a pimp. As you might guess he didn't like that
remark, but he went on to say that I would be in full charge of you and your
education. As he's already told you, I could use any of the old fashioned
methods of correction I wished and there would be no come back from him. When I
asked what exactly he meant by the term, he said I could spank you or use a
cane or whatever else I thought necessary. Still I refused but I thought it
over. I've never considered tutoring as a career and I still don't fancy that
but I've helped a few students with their work in the past but they always
asked for my help.&quot;

&quot;So why am I here with you now on
this prison ship?&quot;

&quot;Look at me Kathleen.&quot; David
stood up under the skylight where there was more headroom. &quot;Where am I
going to find a girl that's somewhere near suitable in size? One that has a
mind that can think? Or is at least a little intellectual? One that would go
out with me voluntarily?&quot; David sat down again and waited but Kathy never
answered. &quot;Kathleen, I've never had a girl except in my imagination. Your
father offered me you and while you don't fulfil any of the criteria I thought
important, at least you are a girl, and a very attractive one at that.&quot;

Kathy was a little flattered that he
thought he attractive even though he'd never seen her properly made up.
&quot;You just wanted me as a sex toy. A girl to fuck! A fucktoy!&quot;

&quot;That's all you were to those boys.
The rugby team. Did any of them love you or have anything except animal
feelings for you? But no, there is more to it than that. I asked the teachers
about you at school and their comments were pretty dismal. Yet I can remember
you as being quite a bright little girl in junior school. I decided it would be
a challenge to see if I could help to get you through the re-take exams in
November. Yes, I do want to fuck you and I guess you'll have to be my tutor in
that subject but I also do want to help you with your schoolwork.&quot;

&quot;I don't intend to teach you
anything fucking thing, nor learn anything either. It will be a huge bloody
challenge for you and one you'll fucking fail.&quot;

&quot;Then your arse will often be
sore.&quot; 

Kathy looked up in shock, &quot;You
wouldn't�not really�&quot; Before she could complete the sentence, David's long
arms wrapped themselves around her body and she found herself over his lap. Her
kicking, swearing and struggles were of little effect, David was far stronger
than he looked and his long arms and legs held her like ropes. 

Ignoring her verbal abuse, David
minimised her kicking by trapping her legs between his. Kathy knew she was
helpless and when he lowered her jeans and knickers, realised he was actually
going to hit her. Without pausing he laid heavy spanks on her unprotected arse.
After about twenty, her cheeks were well reddened and she was crying pitifully,
he let her get up. &quot;Bastard!&quot; she sobbed, &quot;Bloody sadistic
bastard!&quot; but he let that go and told her to get undressed and ready for
bed. Kathy's mind said to refuse but her bottom thought otherwise. She rightly
guessed he might give her another dose. David stood by the door watching as she
undressed in the dim light and for the first time in his life saw a girl naked
and close to him. She quickly got under the bedclothes and faced the bulkhead
furious but also curious to know if his prick was in proportion to the rest of
his body.

For a while David was content to hold her
spoon-like against his body and run his hands gently over her breasts and to
run his fingers through her pubic hair. Slowly her sobbing eased but her mind
still seethed with anger, not so much at the pain, more because of the
humiliation of having been chastised like a child by a boy only a few months
older than she was. Gradually his massaging changed her thoughts. &quot;When is
he going to fuck me? I can feel his prick hard against my bum. Feels quite
large. I'll just let him do it if he wants but I won't give him any help.&quot;
After a while David turned her over and cuddled her to his chest, his hard
prick tight against her stomach. &quot;I'm not teaching you any fucking
thing,&quot; she repeated her earlier words but with less venom. &quot;Not
after what you did to me.&quot; However, it felt strangely nice to be held with
her head against his chest.

&quot;Kathleen�&quot;

&quot;Kathy! If I'm to be your whore, at
least you can call me by a name I like. Kathleen is for when I'm in
trouble.&quot;

&quot;Okay Kathy, I can easily agree to
that. I just wanted to say, sorry. We seem to have got off to a bad start.
Perhaps we can try and do better in the morning. Goodnight, I hope the noises
don't keep you awake for too long. I know they are strange at first.&quot; He
continued to clasp her to him and he too lay awake for a long while. 

&quot;Damn the bloody boy. Damn you
Streaky. Why didn't you just fuck me? You work me up with all your fondling and
then do nothing. Bastard!&quot; She lay awake, at first fuming at what was
happening to her and then deriving a little comfort from his closeness. A
closeness she tried to ignore. 

&nbsp;

Chapter 4. A day at sea

Kathy woke. It was daylight and she was
now lying alongside David. Sometime in the night they must have separated.
&quot;It must be early, sun's not up. Wonder if it will make him mad if I
disturb him to piss? Bloody water always running makes me want to go. Seems a
bit chilly. Must go and try to work that stupid toilet.&quot; Her movements
woke David. &quot;Just going for a piss. Or do I need your permission for
that?&quot;

&quot;No of course not. Remember to turn
the seacock on first and turn if off when you've pumped out your stuff.&quot;

&quot;Yeah, yeah, I remember.&quot; She
intended to spend a little time away from him but the chill air soon raised
goosebumps on her skin causing her to shiver as she climbed over him and back
under the blanket. David cuddled her again and she could feel his early morning
hardness against her stomach. &quot;It feels big. I wonder if he'll put it in
me now? It's been a while since the last party. I'll protest but I really would
like him to do it to me. How can I arrange it without appearing willing?&quot;
She kept her body pressed closely to his even though he didn't hold her
tightly. 

David was silent for a long while,
wondering if he should make the first move. &quot;I know she expects to be my
fucktoy as she put it, but should I force her? I really don't want to but my
prick's so hard and the way she's pressing against me, perhaps I should make
the first move. I'd rather she wanted it but I've read that many girls want to
play hard to get. Well it was one of the reasons I agreed to take her on. I'll
start playing with her and see if she responds. Probably she'll swear at me,
but what's new?&quot; Pushing Kathy on to her back he pushed her thighs apart
and massaged her slit.

&quot;Don't think I am going to teach you
anything,&quot; Kathy snapped, &quot;I know I can't stop you fucking me but
I'll just lie still and let you do it. I shan't enjoy it.&quot;

&quot;Of course not Kathy. I did access
some sites on the net when I knew this was to happen and found out what I
should do but we'll have to see how that works out in practice.&quot; David's
photographic memory recalled every detail of one particular site that went
through the foreplay in great detail. Before long, Kathy unwillingly writhed
under his fingers and he could feel her wetness on his fingers. &quot;Time now
for you to take my virginity,&quot; he said as he pushed her legs further apart
and inserted his prick. It took a couple of attempts the find the right entry
point but then he inserted his prick to almost its full length.

&quot;Aaagh! Remember you thrashed me
last night and my arse is sore.&quot; Actually it was only a little tender now
but his prick was longer, if not thicker than any she'd had previously. It felt
nice but she wasn't about to admit it.

&quot;I only spanked you. I didn't use a
belt or a cane or whip you, like I could have done, so don't be such a fusspot
Kathy.&quot;

David started humping, enjoying the
sensations he'd never experienced. Kathy tried to keep still but it was a
strange experience for her too. Not only was his prick reaching places no other
had reached, her mouth, instead of being close to her partner's was almost
level with his nipples. &quot;Maybe I should nip them with my teeth. Perhaps
not. Don't need another spanking. His prick feels nice but I can't let him know
that.&quot; Despite not wanting to, her body responded and soon she was gently
thrusting back at him. &quot;Sod him. Why is he so good at everything?&quot;
After he'd climaxed inside her, he pulled her higher in the bed and cuddled and
then kissed her. However, she managed to resist the temptation to kiss him
back.

&quot;Time to get up, I want to be under
way at seven. You wash first and I'll start breakfast. Don't waste the water.
It won't be very warm because I haven't run the generator this morning. You'll
need to wear warm clothes to start with today.&quot; He bundled Kathy out of
bed and into the small washroom. The brass clock in the saloon chimed six.
Kathy wanted to know what he meant by 'being under way', but decided not to
bother asking.

&quot;What lessons are you going to try
and teach me today Professor Streaky?&quot; Kathy asked truculently as they ate
breakfast in the wheelhouse in the early morning sunshine. &quot;I want to know
what I'm not going to learn. Have you drawn up a timetable of lessons for me
not to follow?&quot;

&quot;Today is an induction day. No
lessons, just familiarisation with the environment.&quot;

&quot;Familiarise me with your prick more
like!&quot; David noticed a slight smile on her face.

&quot;That too,&quot; he grinned,
&quot;First today though we go to Brightwell Quay and fill up with fuel and
water and then we head out to sea for a bit of my research. Before that I have
to put this anklet tag on you.&quot; David showed her what looked like a
plastic band with a bulge at one point. Half expecting a comment or a refusal,
David grabbed her foot, pushed her jeans up a little way and wrapped the band
tightly around her ankle then, dipping his hands in water, he held them around
the plastic. A chemical reaction caused it to shrink slightly and harden.

Too late, Kathy cried out, &quot;What the
hell are you doing? Take it off. Now!&quot; She started kicking at him but he
just laughed.

&quot;Calm down Kathy. It is nothing that
is going to hurt you and I cannot now take it off. Maybe you've heard of the
tagging system that they use when they release some prisoners. This is a more
refined version. It sends a signal to a satellite and that signal can be
tracked on computer or mobile phone. If you try and run away, we can easily
find you. It needs a special diamond saw to cut it off.&quot;

&quot;You sodding bastard! They had more
chance of escaping from Colditz than from this 'Beryl May' boat or you.&quot;
Tears sprang to her eyes again.

David went towards her intent on giving
her a cuddle but she sprang to her feet and almost made it to the deck before
his arms encircled her and held her close. She tried to hit him but being held
the punches were ineffective and eventually she gave up. &quot;Kathy, the band
doesn't hurt and you'll hardly notice it is there, in fact I'm sure you'll
forget about it before the end of the day. Now there is one other item you must
wear whenever you go on deck and that is a lifejacket.&quot; He pulled one from
a locker. &quot;This really is for your safety. I daresay you can swim but the
water at sea is cold and without it you could succumb before we could find you.
It's not very bulky but it inflates in the water and it sends out a signal that
we can pick up on the radio. It really is foolhardy not to wear one at sea and
had he been wearing one, my father might still be alive. Failure to wear one
will be a definite caning offence. You might get away with refusing to do lessons
but you will not refuse to wear a lifejacket. Understood?&quot;

&quot;Okay Captain Streaky.&quot; She
stood and saluted and then put her fingers to her nose. 

They cleared the breakfast things away,
and with both of them wearing the bright red lifejackets he showed her how to
cast off from the buoy. By 8:30 they had refuelled and were heading back down
river. The water was calm and the early morning sun shone brightly, glinting
the waves in jewelled splendour; an ideal day for a boat trip. When they'd
cleared the moored boats, David opened the twin throttles to the two diesel
engines and the� 'Beryl May' surged
forward. &quot;See that green buoy, keep the boat headed to the right of it.
Let me know if any other boats appear. I'll make us some coffee.&quot; Somewhat
bewildered Kathy clutched the wheel half-afraid to do anything with it. He'd
left her in charge and she'd never been on a boat before last night.
Tentatively she moved the spokes first one way and then the other and saw how
the boat responded. Gradually she relaxed and felt a sense of power surging
through her body with the knowledge that she could control the large vessel
ploughing through the water just by turning the wheel a little.

&quot;You okay with it?&quot; David asked
when he brought the mugs to the wheelhouse. Kathy nodded. &quot;What about that
tiny sailing boat?&quot;

&quot;We have to keep clear of it. Steer
just astern of it and when we get close slow down so our wash doesn't swamp
them.&quot; Soon they were out of the river and on the open sea. There was a
slight swell but the 'Beryl May' pushed her way through it with hardly any
rocking. &quot;You might think that with all this water, we could go anywhere
but there are sandbanks and shoals all over the place so we need to keep to the
channels. There are a few buoys but with the sun bringing the mist up from the
water, we'll need to watch the compass course and keep and eye on the radar and
the echo sounder. We're heading to a narrow trench between the Cod and the
Purfleet sands that's about twenty miles out to sea but we can't go in a straight
line so it will take about two and a half hours.&quot; He showed her the
instruments and the place where they were heading on the chart although that
was meaningless to her, and then just kept more or less out of her way. Kathy
wouldn't admit it but she'd begun to enjoy the day.

Two hours later, David went below and
brought up a small wreath. Kathy looked puzzled when she saw it and then when
he throttled the engines back to a very slow speed, she guessed. David looked
downcast and bowed his head for a minute or so and then tossed the wreath on to
the water. When he returned to the wheelhouse, Kathy murmured, &quot;Your
father?&quot;

David nodded, &quot;Two years ago
yesterday. A line flipped him overboard and the sea was rough. Mother saw it
but by the time she'd got the dredge up and the boat turned round, there was no
sign of him. His body was washed up two weeks later. It was an awful
sight.&quot; Almost instinctively Kathy put her arm around his waist then, a
few minutes later, when she realised what she had done, she sharply removed it.

&quot;We're at our destination now. I'm
going to put out the small beam trawl and a little dredge. We'll be going very
slowly so we can get some lunch. The dredge will only be down for a short while
but the trawl will be down much longer,&quot; David informed her. For a while
there was a flurry of activity as David swung the derricks out and lowered the
nets into the water. Finally it calmed down and to Kathy they seemed not to be
moving at all but David pointed to the water flowing slowly passed them.
&quot;Do you think you can get the stove to work and the kettle on? I'll cut
some bread and we can have something to eat.&quot; 

Kathy felt ravenous. &quot;It must be the
sea air,&quot; she smiled to herself and David caught the look.

They sat eating in the wheelhouse.
&quot;What if a sailing boat comes?&quot; Kathy asked, &quot;We can't get out
of its way.&quot;

Surprised at her even thinking of it,
David answered, &quot;That�s why I pulled that old basket up the mast. It tells
everyone were fishing and to keep clear of us. Not much comes through this
channel anyway, which is why we're researching the life under it. I'm going to
haul the dredge now. Stay in here please, I don't want you caught up in the
warps.&quot; Kathy watched as the steel basket came to the surface and the
contents, which seemed mostly shells to her, was emptied into a large white
plastic tray that David filled with seawater and covered to keep the sun off.
&quot;We'll leave that for a while to settle and then we can look at what
creatures are in there. Time for a half-hour siesta - or a half-hour with my
fucktoy.&quot;

Kathy of course put up a token resistance
but in the end gave in to his mock threat of tying her to the mast and whipping
her with a thick rope. She knew from the way he said it, that it was a joke.
David removed her lower clothes and she did the same for him. For the first
time she saw his prick close to. It wasn't fully hard so without thinking she
put her lips around it a massaged the shaft. &quot;No wonder I could feel it
ramming my cervix or whatever is at the bottom of my vagina,&quot; she thought
as she studied its length. &quot;It's no fatter than normal, but it's certainly
longer than any other I've seen. How's he going to fuck me in here or does he
just want me to suck him off?&quot; 

Her thoughts were answered when he
cleared the chart table and sat her on the edge. He cunt was at just the right
height for him to enter. &quot;Hey, I thought I was supposed to be tutoring you
in this subject but I've never been fucked in this position before.&quot;

&quot;I hope it won't be the last time
though,&quot; David grinned. 

She climaxed well before he did and
almost reached a second orgasm when he withdrew. &quot;Put it back, I'm almost
there,&quot; she cried out but it had quickly softened. Seeing her predicament,
David knelt and tongued her slit and sucked her clit until she came again.
&quot;Thanks,&quot; she muttered as she slid off the table and found her
knickers.

David hauled the net a few minutes after
he'd dressed. This time they'd caught a small skate, some prawns and a load of
crabs. They frightened Kathy a little when they stood up on their legs facing
her with claws outstretched. David casually picked up each one and turned it
over. &quot;I'm looking for those that are parasitized,&quot; he told her.
While I sort this lot, can you take her back to where we started trawling and
we'll have a haul along the other side of the channel. Watch the echo sounder
and shout if it gets down to about two metres. You can see the channel now that
the sand banks are uncovered.&quot;

&quot;Is your mother still alive?&quot;
Kathy asked when the trawl was again in the water and they were making very
slow progress along the edge of the sand.

&quot;Yes. You'll probably meet her. She
has a cottage a couple of miles from Brightwell and I stay there when it's too
rough to get on the boat or I just want a night ashore and a proper cooked
meal. She won't come on the boat though. Brings back too many memories.&quot;

&quot;And how will you introduce me to
her? Mother, this is my new fucktoy?&quot;

&quot;Perhaps by then you'll actually be
a student!&quot;

It was late evening before they arrived
back at the mooring. Kathy controlled the boat most of the way and because of
the low water level, for part of the time, the course was more tortuous and the
speed had to be reduced until they came to the main shipping channel. He even
allowed her to coast the boat up to the mooring buoy, directing her with hand
signals. They picked up the mooring first time. &quot;Well done,&quot; he
praised her when he cut the engines and they made their way below. &quot;There
should be enough hot water for a shower if we share. The engines have been
running all day so the batteries will be fully charged.&quot; 

Kathy didn't even balk at sharing the
shower. She knew that day something had changed between them. She'd had a day
to remember. However when she dried her legs and saw her plastic anklet, she
recalled her status, she was a prisoner. But the day had been exhausting and
she was too tired to worry about it.

&nbsp;

Chapter 5. Escape

What am I really doing here?&quot; Kathy
asked herself as she lay awake. David was asleep alongside her. She'd been on
the boat for five days now and it was becoming increasingly irksome to be
confined to the same small space although he'd promised they would go ashore in
the morning and spend a day or two with his mother. &quot;What am I really
doing here? Why did daddy give me to him? I'm certainly not being tutored in my
schoolwork stuff. He made me get my books out this morning but didn't bother
overmuch when I left them and went to watch those creatures he brings up from
the sand. Weird things. Quite amusing really. Why hasn't daddy phoned me?
Doesn't he care? I suppose it's not too bad here, but it's not like I'm free to
come and go as I please. I suppose I've changed a bit too. The fucking's nice
and he seems to care for me and tries to make sure I come as well as he does.
Odd sensation to be fucked by a boy who looks over your head when he does it.
He's weird though. The way he just reels off the names of those things; the way
he just reads a book and knows it all. He must have a bigger brain inside that
big head of his. Don't know whether I want to spend the whole summer on this
boat. He knows I like it when we're 'under way', for fuck's sake I'm even using
his terms. I like the feeling of being in control especially yesterday when the
wind was quite strong and that squall came and the waves kept shooting all over
us. That was fun. But he controls me too. I have to obey his rules, like
wearing the lifejacket and the way we have to give way to some craft and not
others. He doesn't really demand sex now and I guess I want it as much as he
does but I would like to get away for a bit. Not much chance from here though.
Wonder if this tag thing on my ankle is real or a pretend thing. Probably real,
he's into all that sort of technology. Perhaps I'll get a chance to slip away when
we stay at his mother's. Wonder what she'll be like? A genius like him� An old
bitch?�&quot; Eventually she drifted into a disturbed to sleep.

Grace Miles, David's mother may not have
been a genius but she was sharp and perceptive. A tall woman too. At 5'
11&quot; she looked down on most women and many men but she gave Kathy a warm
hug and welcomed her in when David introduced her. &quot;Hi, mum, this is my
new girlfriend. She's staying on the boat with me for the summer. Kathy this is
Grace, Grace � Kathy.&quot;

&quot;Call me Gracie, everyone
does,&quot; the older woman smiled. &quot;I can see you've been in the fresh
air. Your cheeks have that nice rosy look to them.&quot; 

Kathy smiled to herself and wondered if
David had told his mother about her other cheeks being made rosy but she just
greeted the woman formally.

&quot;I didn't know he had a girlfriend
until he phoned this morning and it came as a bit of a shock but I hope you get
on well together. Make yourself at home. Dinner's in the oven and will be ready
in half an hour. I know David, he times it so he spends all day on that boat
and gets here just before the meal is ready. We'll have to gossip
afterwards.&quot; As it worked out, Janice, one of Gracie's friends called
round that evening so they didn't get much chance to gossip and David took her to
the local pub. She had a couple glasses of wine while he stuck with orange
juice even though they'd walked to the pub.

For the second night running Kathy
couldn't sleep. Gracie insisted on her having her own room. &quot;What you do
together on the boat is your business but in my house you'll sleep in separate
rooms and maybe you'll even enjoy having a bit of space to yourself after the
cramped conditions on the Beryl May,&quot; she'd told her firmly. Thinking that
perhaps it would be nice to have a bed to herself for once, Kathy didn't
protest. She'd slept for a while and now dawn was just breaking and her
thoughts were again questioning why she was with David and more prominently in
her mind, could she escape? Did she want too? &quot;Perhaps it would be a good
idea to test this ankle thing. If I walk out and hide somewhere locally, if
they find me I can just say I went for a walk. I won't get far anyway. I've no
money and I'd have to walk the two miles to Brightwell to get to the main road
and get a lift. Then where would I go? I daren't go home, daddy would send me
back or the two J's would bring me.&quot; She dressed quickly and carried her
shoes as she quietly went down the stairs.

&quot;Trying to escape?&quot; Gracie's
quiet voice startled her. The woman emerged from the kitchen carrying a mug of
coffee. Kathy broke down and sobbed. &quot;Come into my office and I'll get you
a coffee and you can tell me all about it. I had a feeling something was wrong
yesterday but with Janice coming round like that, I didn't get a chance to talk
to you.&quot; Eventually she wormed the whole story out of her. At the end of
it, Gracie commented, &quot;Kathy I think what your father has done to you is
appalling even if he had the soundest of reasons. I suspect you only told me
part of what you got up to before he sent you away so perhaps he had more
reasons than I know about. However, whatever you had done, there was no reason
for him to give you to David for sex in the guise of tutoring you. I'm pretty
sure though, that David likes you but I'm not so sure yet if it is for the
right reasons. I wasn't able to talk with him much yesterday either. Let's
actually go for that walk you were planning and perhaps we can come up with a
plan like I would for one of my novels.&quot; Kathy had already noticed a
couple of paperbacks on the desk with Gracie Miles on the covers.

&nbsp;

Kathy sat on the veranda of the block of
holiday homes that overlooked the sea at Long Stanton. It was hers until the
weekend. Five days to herself if Gracie's idea to disable the anklet actually
worked, if not the two J's or David would be here soon. The plan seemed to have
gone well. Grace gave her an old video and suggested she bind the magnetic tape
over the top of the anklet in the hope that it would nullify the signal. She
then drove her to Brightwell station and bought her a return ticket to Long
Stanton, gave her �100 to spend and passed her the key to Janice's holiday
home. Janice wouldn't need it until the weekend.

&quot;They'll definitely have missed me
by now. The train journey with the change of trains took two hours and it was
an hour ago I arrived. Wonder what they're up to.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;You seen Kathy mum?&quot; David
asked when he came down for breakfast a bit later than usual.

&quot;No,&quot; his mother lied,
&quot;Perhaps she went for a stroll while I was getting a paper.&quot;

David logged on to his laptop.
&quot;There's no signal! She can't have taken it off! It's either that or she's
underground somewhere.&quot;

&quot;Taken what off dear,&quot; Gracie
asked innocently.

&quot;The tag�&quot; David started.

&quot;You used one of your high tech
devices to keep your girlfriend. David I can't believe you did that. How could
you? I supposed you drugged her or something and got her on the boat and then
she was your prisoner.&quot;

&quot;Not quite mother. I have to find
her. She's got no money and no transport. I've got to find her. She could get
into serious trouble again.&quot; He ran to his car and drove to Brightwell
expecting she might have tried to walk there. Not seeing her on the road, he
went to the quay in case she had tried to get to the Beryl May but the rubber
dinghy was still where he'd left it and the store with the outboard was locked.
He phoned his mother to see if she'd returned and when she hadn't he'd an
unwelcome feeling that she had escaped. He couldn't figure out how but there
was no other alternative. &quot;I guess if I was in her place I would have
walked to Brightwell and then hitched a lift on the main road. Dangerous for a
young female but I guess she wouldn't mind opening her legs for a few truckers.
Is she that desperate to get away from me? I thought we were beginning to get
on. Damn mother for making us sleep in separate rooms. I'll have to phone her
father now. He won't be pleased. Maybe the two J's can pick up a signal from
where they are.&quot; 

Throughout the day he drove around the
local roads in the hope she'd been out walking and got lost but that didn't
explain why he didn't get a signal. &quot;She can't have taken the anklet off
not without help from someone who has specialist equipment,&quot; he reasoned,
&quot;Perhaps she managed to hit it and break something in it. Not likely as it
is all solid stated circuitry and she would break her ankle before she broke
it.&quot;

Graham McPherson was not pleased, not
pleased at all. Neither he nor the security men had been informed of her shore
visit and had thought she was imprisoned on the boat. The two J's couldn't get
a signal either so she could be anywhere in the country or even at a police
station complaining of her father's treatment. Still if she had done that, he'd
probably had a visit from them by now.

Towards the end of the afternoon, David
returned from another abortive search of the local area and was frantic with
worry. So much so that his mother almost told him the truth but she decided to
let him stew for a while longer and to give Kathy the time she promised to try
and sort things out in her mind. She knew her son was at least a little guilty
of holding the girl against her will, but it seemed that in the end she hadn't
resented it over much and even enjoyed her trips out on the boat. The real
culprit was her father. Maybe he did do it for the best motives but he was the
one who arranged it all. He was the one who paid for the security people. She
picked up the phone, &quot;Mr. McPherson's secretary please.&quot; When the
girl answered, Grace said, &quot;This is Mrs. Miles, David Miles' mother. Please
tell Mr. McPherson to stay in his office until I get there in about half an
hour. I wish to talk with him about his daughter.&quot; She hung up before the
girl could reply. 

Thirty-five minutes later she walked into
his office and locked the door behind her. &quot;Is the intercom turned
off?&quot; she asked, &quot;Your secretary doesn't need to hear what I am about
to say.&quot; He nodded. &quot;Good. Kathy is safe but out of harms way for the
moment. I had a long and frank talk with Kathy yesterday and managed to worm
out of her all that had happened in the past few weeks. She told me about her
sexual excesses and her refusal to do her schoolwork so that is no secret from
me. She admitted she did it partly to annoy you and partly to gain some
attention. Attention she never had at home. Graham, instead of giving her that
attention yourself, you decided to sell her to my son, not for money but for
sex. You made her his prisoner and told him to use her as he wished and to
punish her in any way he wanted. In return he was to educate her in order to
pass some exams later in the year. The motive behind the idea might seem to be
reasonable but the methods you employed are despicable.&quot;

&quot;You don't understand Mrs. Miles�&quot;

&quot;It's Gracie. I'm not standing on
ceremony with you. I'll use your first name and you can use mine.&quot;

&quot;I'm calling security...&quot;

&quot;Not if you wish this kept out of
the papers. Can't you see the splash headlines, 'Stockbroker boss sells his
daughter for slavery'. You know how they exaggerate things. Now stop
interrupting and listen. Fortunately my son seems to have restrained himself
over the punishment side of things. Your daughter has only had a couple of
spankings and she seems to have found some enjoyment on the boat and has
probably learned more than she has at school in the last few months although
little of it would help pass those exams you deem to be so precious. As I see
it, you wanted her punished in the old fashioned way for something I see the
root cause of as being your fault. Had you given her a little more of your time
in the past, this situation might never have come about.&quot;

&quot;I had to make enough money to keep�&quot;

&quot;I told you not to interrupt!&quot;
Gracie snapped. &quot;I can guess at your feeble excuses. If you wish to see
your daughter again and perhaps get to know her as a real father. You will do
exactly as I say. You wanted Kathy to be punished 'in the old fashioned way'
now you are to be punished in that way while she listens to it happening. She
is safely out of the way for the moment.&quot;

&quot;You want to spank me? You're
joking.&quot;

&quot;No, I'm very serious. The
punishment would be worse than a spanking. I would take your belt to your bare
bottom.&quot;

&quot;You must be joking!&quot;

&quot;I told you, I'm not. The choice is
up to you. You can stay here and do nothing and not see your daughter again.
She hates what you did to her so even if you do take the belt, she may not
decide to speak to you again. In a few months when she is eighteen, I
understand she gets some sort of legacy so won't be beholding to you for money
and I am prepared to support her until then. The second choice is to throw me
out and then it all goes to the press. I would be reluctant to take that step
as well because of my son's involvement but he need's to be taught a lesson
too. Thirdly, and again the choice is yours, you will pack up here and come
back to my house and when I can get Kathy on the phone, I will tie you down to
the bed and lay into your bum with your own belt. You choose. I'll wait five
minutes in the outer office while you make up your mind Graham.&quot;

He tried to argue but Gracie unlocked the
door and from the open doorway reiterated her ultimatum, &quot;Five minutes and
I'll be back. If you lock the door, I will take it that the second choice
applies.&quot; The secretary looked up in askance when she heard the words. &quot;I'm
to go back in, in five minutes unless he asks for me earlier. I shouldn't
bother him for the moment Tracy, because he has a big decision to make.&quot;

Tracy buzzed him anyway and was angrily
told to stop all calls and to leave him alone. Four minutes later, Graham came
out of his office. &quot;Let's go Gracie. I'm not available to anyone and the
mobile's turned off,&quot; he added to the surprised Tracy.

&nbsp;

Kathy returned from the local pub where
she'd had a meal and a couple of glasses of wine. She'd thought of trying to
pick up one or two of the men at the bar but her mind was full of what had
happened and the decisions she had to make about what she wanted to do. Besides
how would she explain the videotape around her ankle. &quot;I daren't remove it
otherwise they will be on to me in no time. It obviously works otherwise they
would be here already. I miss him though.&quot; Sitting on the bed, she felt
very alone and half regretted not picking up the men even with the risk of them
finding the tape but the other half of her wanted 'that long streak of piss'.
He was the first person for a long while that tried to help her. Had let her be
herself, even if it was for shortish periods of time. She tried to order things
in her mind. &quot;I didn't like the spanks; I did like his cock; I hated being
ordered around; I did like taking control of the boat; I didn't like being told
to do schoolwork even though I didn�t do it; I did like being cuddled�&quot;
The phone rang. &quot;Only Gracie and Janice know I'm here unless others have
found out.&quot; 

&quot;Good evening,&quot; Kathy growled,
trying to hide her voice.

&quot;It's okay Kathy, it's Gracie. Now
don't get worried when I tell you I have your father here. He has no idea where
you are and I'm not about to tell him. Say hello to Kathy, Graham.&quot; Kathy
was surprised to hear her use her father�s first name.

&quot;Hello Kathy,&quot; he groaned into
the phone, &quot;Sorry I can't talk properly, the bitch has me tied up.&quot;

&quot;Not only is he tied up on my bed
Kathy, he is naked and his bum is going to get nicely warm in a few
moments.&quot; She went on to explain the offer she'd made to Graham and what
was about to happen. &quot;I've sent David to the pub and told him not to
return until I call his mobile. He's been a total wreck all day. He's looked
everywhere for you and is completely at a loss. I told him an hour ago that you
were safe. I'm going to give him a similar treatment when he gets back, unless
you wish to do it. Yes, I think perhaps it would be better if you did, that's
if you decide to come back. You don't have to make up your mind now.&quot;

&quot;I think perhaps I would like to
have him helpless for a little while and give him a sore bum,&quot; Kathy
laughed. &quot;Are you really going to belt daddy?&quot;

&quot;Just you listen. I'm putting the
phone on the bedside table.&quot;

&quot;Swish SLAAPP!!&quot; &quot;Aaarhh!
Christ woman not so bloody hard.&quot;

&quot;Swish SLAAPP!!&quot; &quot;Aaarhh!
Oh my God. No more!&quot; Twelve strokes later and he was a sobbing, crying
wreck. No longer was he the boss of a corporation; Gracie had reduced him to a
howling child.

&quot;Hi Kathy. You hear that okay. I've
belted him fourteen times now.&quot;

&quot;Bloody hell, it sounded as if you
were murdering him. Good job your cottage is detached.&quot;

&quot;Do you think he's had enough Kathy?
He's lying on the bed wetting my sheets with his tears. His bottom is blotched
with most of the colours of a rainbow and it's a bit swollen. I'll give him a
few more if you wish. Perhaps I'll get him to say a few words to you. Here
Graham, talk to your daughter.&quot;

&quot;Kathy, please tell her to stop.
I'll get you released. I won't make you take the exams if you don't wish to.
I'll try and be a better father to you. I'll�&quot;

&quot;Stop whining daddy. Ask Gracie to
talk to me.&quot; Gracie took the phone. &quot;Give him a couple more. Make
sure he knows I ordered them. For once in my life I am in control of him. Look
after him afterwards please. Tell David to sleep on the boat tonight and I'll
phone him in the morning with my instructions.&quot;

Gracie smiled and the wording, 'with my
instructions'. They implied that she was thinking of returning. She turned to
Graham, &quot;Kathy says to give you two more specially for her and then I'm to
look after you.&quot;

&nbsp;

Chapter 6. Reunited

David had a restless night on the boat
wondering whether or not Kathy would phone. He wondered what his mother was up
to. She'd looked strangely excited when he spoke to her in the kitchen last
night and he'd heard moans from behind her bedroom door but all she said was,
&quot;I've just punished Kathy's father for his part in this affair. Now I have
to look after him for a bit. Kathy knows what I did to him but it doesn't
concern you at the moment. She said she is going to make up her mind tonight on
whether she wishes to return to your care and will phone you on the boat in the
morning with her instructions for you. I guess she would want to punish you for
what you did to her before agreeing to come back.&quot; Although he tried to
find out more, his mother refused to say.

So he tossed and turned in the bunk. He'd
slept alone in it many times but now it seemed so empty. She'd only been with
him a few days and yet it seemed forever. Looking back over what he'd done to
her, there was little he really regretted. &quot;Yes, I sort of imprisoned her
but we would never had met otherwise. I spanked her but it was only a spanking.
I virtually raped her the first few times but she seemed to like it, certainly
she did towards the end. I know she enjoyed the boat trips. Perhaps it was a
mistake to set her schoolwork. I didn't force her to do it and she didn't.

&nbsp;

&quot;Is that any easier Graham?&quot;
Gracie had bathed his arse with cool water and put some cold cream on. He'd had
a couple of painkillers but was still tied to the bed.

&quot;A little Grace. Still bloody
painful.&quot;

&quot;You don't swear is this house
Graham.&quot;

&quot;When are you going to untie me
please?&quot;

&quot;When I think it is safe to do so.
Maybe before I come to bed, maybe not. Would you like to phone your home to let
them know you won't be back tonight?&quot; He did with Gracie holding the phone
for him.

&quot;Gracie? Has this thrashing wiped my
slate clean? Do you think I can start again with Kathy?&quot;

&quot;As far as I am concerned it has but
I cannot speak for your daughter. She may have far more grudges against you
that I have no knowledge of. That will be between you and her but I would think
it has at least partially wiped it clean. Much depends on how you keep the
promises you made on the phone last night. As yet I don't even know if she will
come back to you or us. I will do all I can to keep her safe but, as you know,
she makes up her own mind.&quot; The conversation was cut short by David's
return and it was nearly an hour later that she returned to the bedroom.

&quot;Graham, You seem calm enough for me
to untie you so I'm going to do that. Then I'll help you to the toilet and put
you to bed for the night. My guess is that you'll have to call in sick in the
morning.&quot; He assumed he would be put in David's bed and was surprised when
she brought him back to hers and then prepared herself for bed. As she climbed
in beside him she whispered, &quot;If you can use punishment to make a woman go
to bed with a man, then I can do the same.&quot; Her hand slid down his body
and clasped the prick she seen several times that evening and tried to ignore.
&quot;I know you're a bit sore so we'll just play a little for now.

&quot;I'm more than a little sore after
what you did! Still I won't mind playing a little. It's been a long time.&quot;

&nbsp;

David anxiously watched the clock. 9 a.m.
10 a.m. 11 a.m. He wanted to phone his mother but didn't want the phone to be
engaged if Kathy called. 11:15 it rang and it was in his hand almost before the
end of the first ring. &quot;Hi. Is that Captain Streaky?&quot;

&quot;Hi Kathy. Are you okay? You�re not
hurt or anything? Where are you?&quot;

&quot;Hey, one question at a time. I'm
fine. Where I am doesn't matter for the moment. The real question is whether or
not I should come back to you. Do you want me to come back?&quot;

&quot;Oh yes Kathy, please come back. I
know I've done some things I regret but I'll try and make it up to you.&quot;

&quot;Do you regret taking me prisoner
Streaky?&quot;

&quot;No,&quot; he answered vehemently,
&quot;If I hadn't done that, we would never have met.&quot;

&quot;At least you're honest. I don't
regret that either but I do think you ought to be punished like I was for going
along with my father's plans. Punished in the way I think appropriate.&quot;

&quot;If that's what it takes, then I'll
go along with it. I want you back Kathy. Please where are you?&quot;

&quot;Let me unwind this videotape from
around the anklet�&quot;

&quot;A magnetic shield. Of course.
Brilliant idea Kathy�&quot;

&quot;It was your mother's. I couldn't
have escaped without outside help.&quot;

&quot;You're at mother's now. Can I come
and pick you up?&quot; David was excited now and he didn't want to do anything
to offend her and send her away again.

&quot;Of course, provided you still agree
to my getting my own back on your arse tomorrow.&quot;

&quot;Why not today?&quot;

&quot;You'll find out tomorrow. Your
mother says that it will be lunchtime soon so come and eat with us. Daddy may
have to stand and maybe you'll have to too for tomorrow night's meal.&quot;

As soon as he was in the house, David
lifted her until her feet were well off the floor and kissed her hard and long
until she cried out. &quot;Put me down you long streak of piss!&quot; 

&quot;I told your father earlier, we
don't allow swearing in this house Kathy so please mind what you say,&quot;
Gracie chided the girl.

&quot;Sorry mummy.&quot;

&quot;And don't be cheeky either,&quot;
Gracie laughed although she felt rather pleased that Kathy had called her
that.&quot;

Later, when they were on the boat and
cuddling in the bunk after a gentle fuck, Kathy whispered, &quot;Did you know
your mother slept with my father last night?&quot; David looked at her in
surprise. &quot;Well they did. And you ought to see the state of dad's arse.
Gracie hit him real hard. Sixteen times. I heard it on the phone but thought it
didn't sound too hard and that daddy was being a wimp and yelling his head off.
This morning I insisted on seeing if she'd punished him properly and his arse
is all purple and blue and red. Terrible sight. I wouldn't want to cross your
mum even though she helped me to get out of your clutches.&quot;

&quot;Well your in them again now,&quot;
David laughed clasped her tight. 

Kathy giggled and tried to free herself.
&quot;I'll get my own back on you tomorrow you beast.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Have we enough fuel to get to that
place where we trawled on the first day out?&quot;

&quot;Plenty. Is that where you want to
go? There's more wind today.&quot;

The sky was overcast and the wind made
the boat rock as they slowly forged ahead of the tide towing the trawl. Kathy
looked round. &quot;There's no other boats close by. Take your trousers off
Streaky but you'd better keep you lifejacket on. We don't want to breach safety
regulations do we? Up on deck with you. Time for your punishment captain.&quot;

David had an inkling of what she intended
to do and wondered just how far she would go. However far it was, he was going
to have to take it if he was to keep her. He made his way to the mast.
&quot;I'm going to tie your hands with this halyard and pull them up the mast.
Oddly David noticed she'd used the correct term for the rope, more than what
she was doing. The cool breeze chilled his bum but he guessed she'd soon be
warming it and wondered just how painful it would be. A rope left welts that
would show for a long while. Her spanking marks lasted two days at the most.
He'd have to go through with it though. In any case, now his hands were tied
and above his head, he had little option.

Kathy came up from the cockpit with a
length of rope. &quot;You ready for your flogging now Streaky?&quot;

&quot;Yes, ma'am.&quot; He didn't plead
or make excuses. Kathy swung the rope. It caught him low down. The boat's
rocking had spoiled her aim but it had left a painful red line across the top
of both legs. She shortened the rope and didn't swing so hard for the remainder
of his punishment. 

&quot;I'm giving you a dozen because
that's a nice round number and I think you should be able to take that many and
still be able to fuck me on the chart table afterwards.&quot; David knew she
was being more lenient with him than his mother was to Graham but still his
arse was sore afterwards and it would be painful to sit for a few days. Still
it was a small price to pay for the girl her loved. For the next ten minutes,
fishing was forgotten while he fucked her as she had asked. Her sitting on the
chart table with her legs wrapped around his tender arse.
