 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My name is Gary Asher, I&#8217;m a professional photographer. I have a small, but profitable, studio in down town Chicago. Because of the nature of my business, I, sometimes, work with the most beautiful women in the city and, not once, in ten years of marriage, have I ever considered cheating on my wife, Judy. I was the luckiest guy in the world and I knew it. My wife, who still looks and good as ever, is the loving mother of our seven year old daughter, Tammy, and the most loving, devoted, and caring wife a man could ever want. Not to mention, after being together for twelve years, the sex is just as exciting as it was the first time we made love. I&#8217;ve heard about other couple&#8217;s sex life and how it would get stale and deteriorate after a little while, but ours was spontaneous and fresh. Sometimes we would make love twice a week, other times, twice a day. Sometimes we would use toys or some exotic locations, but we always seemed to be in sync with each other and, in all our years together, one had never denied the other. Not once.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When I first met Judy, she was a top model herself, probably the most beautiful woman I had ever seen, at least I thought so. We met on my first, major, shoot. Prior to that I was doing model composites, some small advertising photography and, I&#8217;m not too proud to admit it, but I even took a few weddings to keep my head above water. This was my big break, it was the big time, a 3 day shoot for a major client,&nbsp; and I was all puffed up like a peacock. I would have never had the balls to even ask Judy out under any other circumstances.&nbsp; We dated for two years, then, in a city where everyone was living together, we decided to make it legal. We exchanged vows in front of our friends, family, and God. You might say, for me, life was picture perfect���until the other night.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It started out as a normal evening. After dinner Judy was helping Tammy with a project for school so I went to my home office to go over some shots for an upcoming ad campaign. I didn&#8217;t even realize how late it was getting when Judy poked her head in the door way and said she had put Tammy to bed, but my little girl wanted a good night kiss from her daddy. I jumped up, a little embarrassed that I had spent most of my family time working, and said I would give her an extra big kiss tonight. As I bent over my angel and gave her a great big smooch on the cheek, Judy walked passed the room and said she was tired and going to bed herself. I looked at my watch. It was still pretty early, but I thought, what the hell, I think I&#8217;ll hit the sack too and make passionate love to my gorgeous wife. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I hit the washroom on the way and was a little surprised when Judy was under the sheets already. I crawled in beside her and gently kissed her forehead. She knew, instantly, what was on my mind. She made a little sigh then said something that shocked me to my socks. �Honey, I&#8217;m just too tired tonight.� I couldn&#8217;t believe my ears, as I said earlier, never had we ever denied one another. I thought I would just lightly sneak my hand between her long, beautiful, legs and stimulate her clit a little. I was sure she would change her mind, but she had her legs tightly pressed together with her left hand wedged in between, completely covering her pussy. �Honey, please, really, I&#8217;m just too tired tonight,� she repeated. I said it was okay and rolled over on my back, but my mind was going two-forty. We didn&#8217;t speak anymore that night, but I couldn&#8217;t sleep. I couldn&#8217;t help but wonder if something was wrong. She was completely silent, but I knew she wasn&#8217;t sleeping either. Judy always has the cutest, little snore when she is in dream land. I , finally, started to nod off. I was in that twilight state just before sleep when I felt Judy get up. In my semi-conscience state, I figured she was going to the washroom, but after a little while I realized she hadn&#8217;t come back to bed. I put on my robe and wandered downstairs and into the kitchen. Judy was sitting at the breakfast table sipping a cup of coffee and, kind of, gazing into space. It startled her a little when I walked in. �Oh, what are you doing up?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I could ask you the same thing,� I said.&nbsp; �What&#8217;s wrong, honey? I know you have something on your mind, what is it?� She looked as if she was about to reveal some deep, dark secret, but then decided not to.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Really, honey, nothing is wrong. I just had a hard day yesterday�..honest.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Okay,� I said, �but you know, of course, you can talk to me about anything�anything at all��.right?� She smiled that smile that made men weak in the knees. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I know, dear. Really, nothing is wrong. Why don&#8217;t you go back to bed and try to get some sleep. I&#8217;ll join you in a few minutes.�&nbsp; I was exhausted from a long night of brain overload and fell asleep, this time, as soon as my head hit the pillow. I woke up a couple of minutes before the alarm went off and looked over to see my lovely bride laying next to me. I just couldn&#8217;t stop worrying that something was wrong. As the alarm went off, she stirred and stretched, then looked into my eyes. Her face was beaming as she said, �Good morning my wonderful man.� She crawled on top of me with a passionate kiss. Unfortunately, we both knew there was no time for hanky panky. Tammy had to get to school and I had an early appointment with a client. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;On the way out the door Judy informed me she had some shopping to do today so not to worry if I called the house and got no answer. I said okay as I got into my black, Z3 convertible and flicked the switch so the top would go down. It was a gorgeous, summer day in Chicago, and I was looking forward to driving in on Lake Shore Drive rather than use the expressway. I met my client, but had a hard time focusing. Judy was bright and cheery this morning, but I couldn&#8217;t help but think that something was really bothering her last night. For one split second I thought, could she be having an affair? That was ridiculous and I knew it. Out of all the people we knew, I didn&#8217;t know anyone who&#8217;s marriage was as solid as ours. No, something was bothering her, but it wouldn&#8217;t be that. What ever it was, she seemed to have taken care of it by morning. As the day progressed and I got busy and thought less and less about the night before. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By the time I got home I was hoping Judy was as horny as I was. Once again, however, she seemed to be a little pensive during the evening. I wasn&#8217;t going to make the same mistake I made the other night so I joined in helping with my daughter&#8217;s school project and spent the whole night with my family. After putting Tammy to bed, I took Judy&#8217;s hand and lead her to the bedroom. She knew, from the twinkle in my eye, exactly what I wanted and this time she gave me no arguments. I was going to be extra sensual and romantic. I teased her body with my soft touch as I slowly undress her. She laid her head back and sighed as I kissed her neck. I took her in my arms and lowered her body to the bed.&nbsp; I gently worked her nipples with my tongue as I messaged her, perfect, 34-C breasts. She moaned as I worked my tongue down her flat stomach where I paused slightly before separating the folds of her pussy. I teased, flicked, and worked my tongue around, sometimes sucking her clit until it was hard, almost like my cock. I was not, what you would call, hung like a horse, but I was bigger than average and I could stay hard for a couple of hours, which I did.&nbsp; Judy climaxed three times, each time, trying to be quiet so we wouldn&#8217;t wake Tammy. The last time we both came together and we were totally spent.&nbsp; Again though, during the whole time, I had the feeling that Judy just wasn&#8217;t into it quite as much as she normally would be and, for the second time, the suspicion of an affair crept into my brain and, this time, it stayed there.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;During the drive into work I kept telling myself my suspicions were foolish, but I had to find out for sure. One thing was obvious, I could not let Judy know I didn&#8217;t trust her so, what ever I came up with,&nbsp; had to be covert. When I got into the studio I checked my shooting schedule. There was a two hour gap around noon so I called an old friend of mine, Sammy.&nbsp; Sammy was a procurer of things. I don&#8217;t know how he did it, but I got half of the equipment in my studio from Sammy and, all the time, at lower than wholesale prices. The equipment was all top quality, it wasn&#8217;t gray market, all the equipment came with the manufacturer&#8217;s warranties,&nbsp; and I knew it was not hot. I had an idea, but I need to talk to Sammy over lunch about some special equipment I would need.&nbsp; When we met at a, down town, restaurant a couple blocks from my studio, I asked him if he had access to small spy cameras. He was a little surprised at my request and asked&nbsp; what the hell I was going to do with spy cameras. Sammy was a good friend. He had been to our house many times over the years and knew, both Judy and Tammy. �Sammy, you have to promise that what I&#8217;m going to tell you goes no further than the two of us,�&nbsp; I said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Of course, pal, what the hell is going on, this is starting to sound serous?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I think Judy is having an affair.� I could hardly bring myself to say the words. I thought Sammy was going to choke on a piece of the hamburger he had just bitten into.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No way,� he mumbled before even swallowing. He took a big gulp and continued. �I have never seen a, more perfect, couple than you and Judy. Are you sure she&#8217;s having an affair?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No. That&#8217;s why you can&#8217;t say anything to anyone. If I&#8217;m wrong and Judy somehow got wind that I wrongly suspected her, I think it would have a devastating effect on our marriage. And if I am wrong, I sure as hell don&#8217;t want to jeopardize what I&#8217;ve got.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sammy sipped his glass of beer, �so what makes you think she&#8217;s having an affair. I know you, you&#8217;re not paranoid, something put the thought in your head.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It&#8217;s just the way she&#8217;s been acting lately. If it&#8217;s not an affair, then something else is bothering her for sure. Hopefully, if I can get those cameras, I&#8217;ll find out it&#8217;s not an affair, but something else. Something is wrong, Sammy, and I&#8217;ve got to find out what it is.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Okay,� Sammy leaned forward so he could lower his voice a little, �digital spy cameras are very sophisticated these days. They&#8217;re HD with unbelievable resolution, and they&#8217;re capable of shooting in extreme low light conditions.&nbsp; Most of them come disguised in something, a clock, a smoke alarm, something like that. How many do you want?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This was sounding pretty good, I was already concocting a story for replacing our alarm clock and putting a smoke detector in our bedroom. �Well, I want one for her car. She has a blue tooth and talks in the car a lot. I want, at least, one for the living room, and, at least three for our bedroom. I doubt if she would bring a guy into our bed, but if she did, I&#8217;d want as many different angles as I could get to make sure I see the guy&#8217;s face.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Okay, I&#8217;ll have the stuff for you this afternoon. I&#8217;ll get you a small video for her car so you can see and hear her talking to anyone. I&#8217;ll get you an alarm clock, a smoke detector, and a wrist watch that you can put on the dresser. They also have one that looks like a charging unit for something. You can pretend you&#8217;re charging a camera or a phone or something. That makes four for the bedroom, that should be plenty. There&#8217;s a nice desk clock you can put on top of the TV for the living room. That should do it. I&#8217;ll set them all up so they are sound activated so they don&#8217;t go on unless someone is in the room.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�How much is all this going to cost me?� I asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Not as much as it would if you bought from anyone else,� he said with a smile. True to his word, Sammy stopped by the studio later that afternoon with all the stuff. He explained how to use everything and I was set to try and find out what was bothering my wife. When I came home I didn&#8217;t try to hide anything. I had several boxes in my arms and told Judy that one of the appliance stores had a, one day, sale on a bunch of things so I got a new alarm clock for the bedroom, and a smoke detector as well since we didn&#8217;t have one in our bedroom. I also showed her the pretty clock for over the TV.&nbsp; Before coming into the house, I quietly had snuck into the garage and installed the small video camera under the dash of her SUV. You&#8217;d have to be looking for it and know just where it was to find it.&nbsp; She seemed to be her normal self again, but neither of us approached the other in bed. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The video camera in her car was wireless and I could monitor it from the computer in the studio office. It didn&#8217;t take long before my worst fears were realized.&nbsp; About 10 o&#8217;clock in the morning I heard a voice on my computer. I had an hour yet before any clients so I hurried into the office and sat down to watch. There was my lovely wife driving her car and talking on the phone, as usual. The conversation, however, was anything but usual.
�I just feel so damn guilty all the time. I should have broken it off with you the other day when I went to your office. I didn&#8217;t get a wink of sleep all night, the night before, thinking about what a fool I was. For the first time in our marriage I denied my husband sex. I couldn&#8217;t take the chance of him seeing how puffy I was from you. I had decided that was it for us, I went to your office to tell you we were through, then, of course, you had to seduce me one more time. I got fricken rug burns from that damn carpeting in your office. I know I didn&#8217;t resist, I don&#8217;t seem to be able to resist you. You&#8217;ve made me your love slave and I can&#8217;t seem to break free. Damn you!���.I&#8217;m going over to my girlfriends. I need someone to talk to�� No, I&#8217;m not coming over there this afternoon. I need to settle down, I can trust Bev I know she won&#8217;t say anything to anyone. I can cry on her shoulder and that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m going to do. What?��.Not today. Friday Gary has to leave town until Sunday. He has a shoot somewhere down state, you can come over then, but wait until I call you just incase something falls through and he doesn&#8217;t go. Okay, yeah, I can&#8217;t wait either. Bye.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I just sat in front of my computer, my mind trying to absorb what I just heard. I kept telling myself over and over, it can&#8217;t be true, it just can&#8217;t. I knew I was about to break out bawling any minute so I called my client and told him I had a family emergency and couldn&#8217;t do the shoot this afternoon. I told him I would reschedule as soon as I could. As I closed my phone the tears came like a typhoon. I cried for the next three hours straight. I cried until there were no more tears to cry. After a while my sorrow started to turn to, �what next?�&nbsp; What will I do? A million different scenarios started running through my head. Should I pretend I don&#8217;t know, let her have her fling and hope she comes to her senses? Should I confront her? The more I thought the more angry I became. I knew I could not let her go on having an affair and pretend everything was alright. Hell, I&#8217;d lose all respect for myself and if she ever found out I knew and didn&#8217;t do anything about it, I&#8217;m sure she would lose respect for me as well. No, my marriage was over and I knew it. I started thinking about the consequences of a divorce, her folks, my folks, how devastated they&#8217;ll be when they hear the news, and Tammy. For a moment I tried to tell myself to keep the marriage together for her sake, but what kind of a household would it be? No, I didn&#8217;t want her raised in an atmosphere like that either. No, divorce was the only solution, it was clear to me now. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I got out a pen and some paper and started to divide the assets, but as I did that, I started to get more angry. Why should I give her half of my business, she&#8217;s the one having the affair, not me. Why should she keep the house? BULLSHIT! Now I was pissed. I wondered if I could hold it together long enough to find out who this ass hole is and get some evidence that I can use in court. With my concerns for her over the past few days, I had forgotten all about that shoot in Paris, Illinois. I have to cancel that, but I&#8217;m not going to tell her, I&#8217;ll let her think I&#8217;m going,&nbsp; Remembering what I heard on the computer, did she actually say he could come over, �..to our house�.probably even in our bed!!!!!&nbsp; GOD! I can&#8217;t believe this is happening, and I found I still had some tears left. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I didn&#8217;t see any way possible to go home and face Judy. As time to start heading home approached, I called the house, by that time she was home, and told her I had a late shooting schedule and I was going to stay at the studio tonight. She sounded extremely concerned. I had never done that before. �Honey,� she said, �is everything alright?� Her voice was starting to break up, I could tell she had tears in her eyes, even over the phone.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Of course, honey, it&#8217;s just that I&#8217;m already tired and I don&#8217;t want to take a chance at falling asleep at the wheel.�&nbsp; I was not good at lying, but I had no choice. As I hung up I could hear the concern and emotion in her voice. I was hoping I didn&#8217;t tip my hand. I really wanted to find out who this jackass, lover boy,&nbsp; was. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Again I didn&#8217;t sleep. At 8:00 am sharp I heard my wife&#8217;s voice on the computer again. It didn&#8217;t look like she slept any better than I did. She was using her cell phone from our living room. Those cameras are really paying off, I thought.&nbsp; I heard her say to the, unknown person on the other end, �I think we should call it quits.� It sounded more like panic in her voice now. �No, really, I think Gary suspects something��because he spent the night at the studio last night. He&#8217;s never done that before���never!��..He said he had a late shooting schedule and he was tired and didn&#8217;t want to take a chance at falling asleep at the wheel.&nbsp; Oh bull, Pete, we have never spent a night apart if he is in town. Listen, I have to go. Tammy will be down any minute and I have to get her off to school. No, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a good idea for you to come over Friday��I don&#8217;t know,&nbsp; okay, I guess, but I think this is the last time, Pete. I mean it��.no,&nbsp; I really do. Yeah, I know I&#8217;ve said that before. Okay, I&#8217;ll call you Friday morning if the coast is clear. Yeah, me too. Bye.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Okay, I now had a first name, Pete. Yeah, I said to myself, you take, mother fucker, Pete in our bed Friday and see what happens, bitch. I just realized, that was the first time since meeting her, that I referred to my wife in anyway, but in terms of endearment. I had to face the fact that our marriage was really over now, there was no going back. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This was Thursday, one more night before I find out who Pete is. Tomorrow morning I&#8217;ll pretend to leave town, but I&#8217;ll be parked down the block waiting for a glimpse of Pete. Tonight is going to be rough. I have to make everything seem normal or she&#8217;ll call it off for tomorrow for sure. I don&#8217;t know how I&#8217;m going to act like everything is okay. I had rehearsed and rehearsed for going home tonight. When I drove into the drive I took a deep breath, forced a smile on my face and said to myself, you can do this, Gary. It&#8217;s just one night. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When I walked through the door my wife was already approaching me with a very worried look on her face. She through her arms around my neck and kissed me passionately. She looked into my eyes as if she was studying them, trying to see some clue of suspicion. �What the hell was that all about, last night?� she asked. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I told you, honey, I was tired and didn&#8217;t want to take a chance at the wheel.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Bull, that time of night you can make it in fifteen minutes. You would never spend a night away from me for a lousy fifteen minutes. Please honey, something is wrong, I know it, I can feel it. Please tell me what it is.� This was not going as I had planned. A rage was building inside me that I had never felt before, but I had to suppress it, I had to convince her nothing was wrong. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Honey, honest, there is nothing wrong. I had a bad day and I was grumpy. Coupled with the long hours I felt I would be better if I spent the night there, that&#8217;s all.� I wondered if she thought that I was cheating. It would have been a logical conclusion, but she didn&#8217;t even seem to entertain the motion. She had her suspicions, but she could not know for sure if I knew anything about her and Pete. After my favorite for dinner, I played with Tammy for a while, then told Judy I was going up stairs to pack for tomorrow. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Are you still going?� she asked. �You haven&#8217;t mentioned anything about it and was wondering if it had been cancelled.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No, no,� I said, �nothing has been cancelled. I&#8217;ll be in Paris, Illinois. I have to leave here around 6am. I still have to go into the studio. I have everything packed, but I have to throw it all in the SUV. I&#8217;ll be leaving from there about 8am and it&#8217;s about an eight hour drive so, by the time I get checked in at the motel down there, I&#8217;m guessing it&#8217;ll be a good, 4:30 or 5 o&#8217;clock before you hear from me, okay honey.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m going to miss you,� she sounded like she meant it. Oh well.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m going to miss you too, honey. I&#8217;ll be back Sunday night and we&#8217;ll go out and celebrate, how&#8217;s that?� Her eyes lit up. I believe I eased her mind. She got all excited over the thought of going out for a night on the town. That night I thought I deserved a damn academy award for my perforce of a loving husband making love to his sweet wife. In the morning she got up with me and had a quick breakfast ready for me before I left. I&#8217;m going to miss this, I thought. I going to miss everything. I began to second guess myself again, but not for long though, as soon as I thought of some ass hole making love to my wife in my bed I knew this had to be done. I went into Tammy&#8217;s room and gently kissed her cheek.&nbsp; I looked at Judy who had the most wonderful smile on her face, �Take good care of the Z3,� I said, �don&#8217;t wrap it around any light poles while I&#8217;m gone.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I won&#8217;t, honey,� she said chuckling, �you be careful driving and call me as soon as you can.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I will, honey.� I could see I did a great job of acting. I was sure I squashed her suspicions of me knowing about her and Pete. I drove to the studio and set up in front of my computer. It was too early for her to call Pete before, but I&#8217;m guessing she&#8217;ll call him at his office again as soon as he gets in. That was 8am. I was hoping she would call from the living room since I was driving the car with the other, hidden, video camera. Sure enough, at 8 o&#8217;clock sharp I heard her on the phone from the living room. �Yeah, it&#8217;s me. He&#8217;s gone. He said he wouldn&#8217;t be able to call me until about 4:30, but Tammy will be home by three so you&#8217;ll have to be out of here by then�..no, no, I still have to take Tammy to school and I want to get dolled up for you, make it 10 o&#8217;clock��Well you&#8217;ll just have to wait.� I had a front row seat, I could see her smile a little as she said that. �No, I don&#8217;t know what that was all about, but I don&#8217;t think he suspects anything anymore. We had a great night of sex so you&#8217;re going to have to perform there, lover boy, if you want to compete.� Again she smiled. What a tramp, I thought. How could I have been married to her all these years and not realized it. I took a pair of binoculars from the self in my prop room and took off for home again. I parked down the street where I knew I would not be seen and waited. At 9:45 a blue Pontiac drove in our drive. The pussy hound couldn&#8217;t even wait for 10 o&#8217;clock. I got out the binocs and watched him get out of the car. He had his back to me as he walked up to the door and I really didn&#8217;t think I was going to get a good look at him until he rung the bell, then turned around to look out to the street. Pete Jeffers!&nbsp; I knew the son-of-a-bitch! He was an account executive for one of the smaller ad agencies down town. We had worked together on two shoots over the past few months. The bastard is married and has two kids of his own. I wondered if he was banging my wife while we worked together. I had to calm down or, I thought, I might have a stroke here. I wished I had my lap top, I never thought of that. I could watch what they say to each other in the living room. Oh well, it&#8217;s being recorded at the studio. I&#8217;ll watch it later. Just then I saw my wife open the door. She wasn&#8217;t kidding about getting dolled up. Gad, she was beautiful. She immediately put her arms around his neck in the same way she did me just last night. They held each other and kissed passionately. Then she pulled him by his tie and they walked into the house.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I didn&#8217;t know how long I should wait, every minute seemed like an eternity. I looked at my watch. It&#8217;s been an hour, that should be enough time, even if they sat and talked over a drink before, they should be in bed by now, I thought. I quietly walked around the back of the house and peeked in the window. There was nobody in the kitchen or the living room so I felt safe in assuming they were in my bed. I, very quietly, unlocked the back door and snuck in. I pulled the plug on the first video camera in the living room then tip toed up the stairs. As I neared the top of the landing I could hear my lovely wife screaming YES, YES, OH GOD, FUCK ME, HARDER, HARDER. I could hear the bed squeaking and a male voice grunting. I approached the door with out them seeing me until I was ready. In mid thrust I nonchalantly walked through the bedroom doorway. �Don&#8217;t let me bother you,� I said calmly, �I just have to pick up a few things.� A shrill scream filled the room as my wife saw me. I was sure the whole neighborhood heard it. Pete actually fell off the bed and onto the floor, head first,&nbsp; while trying to scramble out from my wife&#8217;s pussy. I walked over to the wrist watch I left on the dresser and stuck it in my pocket. Then I unplugged the alarm clock and the fake charging unit. With one good yank I dislodge the smoke detector. I now had all the evidence I needed. I looked at my wife who seemed to be in shock for the moment. I turned and walked out the room and down the stairs. Judy started screaming, WAIT, WAIT, OH GOD, PLEASE WAIT. DON&#8217;T LEAVE! She came running, her naked body smelling of sex. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Gary, Gary, what are you going to do? Please, don&#8217;t go, let me explain, please, I love you.� She tried to put her arms around my neck, but I pushed her away. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Don&#8217;t get that bastards cum on my clothes,� I said. �What am I going to do? Well divorce you, of course. What else can I do?�&nbsp; I never saw so much horror in a person&#8217;s face as when I mentioned the word, �divorce.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No, you can&#8217;t do that. Gary, this was just a physical thing, he means nothing to me, nothing at all, I love you, only you. What about Tammy, what would she do with out her father, please you have to listen to me, please.� I couldn&#8217;t take any more. I had to get out of there before I buckled under. I heard Pete asking me to stay as I turned toward the door. Judy was literally hanging on me and I had to push her off. I walked down the street to the SUV. Judy was actually on the porch, stark naked, yelling for me to please stop. I didn&#8217;t see anyone, but I was sure she gave more than one neighbor a hell-of-a show. I drove back to the studio to view the pictures and the video. I thought I could watch, but 5 minutes into it, I turned it back off. I had the evidence, I just wasn&#8217;t sure what I was going to do with yet. I sure didn&#8217;t want Tammy seeing her mother sucking ass hole&#8217;s dick. Well, I thought, I&#8217;ll see how she acts at the divorce. I can file for irreconcilable differences at first and see if she goes along with everything okay. If she makes trouble I&#8217;ll change it adultery and show the judge all my pics. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I didn&#8217;t know what to do with myself now. It was only 1pm. I&#8217;ll wait until Monday to file the papers. Was that a mistake, I wondered. Will I actually have the guts to go through with it. I have to. I could never look at her again as my loving wife. In my eyes now she&#8217;s nothing but a whore. Yes, come Monday morning and I&#8217;ll be at the Cook County courthouse to file for divorce proceedings. So, what do I do in the mean time. I got it, get drunk! Just then my cell phone rang. I looked, sure enough, it was her. I shut it off. A second later the phone in the studio started ringing. I walked over and unplugged it. 
I also saw I had 25 e-mails in the last hour. I bet I know who they&#8217;re from, I thought. Yup. I turned my cell phone back on just long enough to call Sammy. He asked me if I found out if Judy was really cheating on me or not. I said I sure did. He said how sorry he was. I could hear real remorse in his voice. He was a true friend. What are you doing the rest of the day old pal of mine, I said.&nbsp; We met soon after that at a bar down the block and got pleasantly drunk as I told him my whole, sorted tail.&nbsp; It was 1am by the time I stumbled back to the studio. Saturday I panicked. I had forgotten to transfer funds from our bank account and was scared that she may have, already, wiped me out, but that was not the case. I transferred half of our personal funds into my business account. That gave me a little relief. I walked a little ways to a restaurant where I, sometimes, had breakfast. There was a cute, little waitress that worked there by the name of Vicki. I ordered breakfast then picked up a paper and started looking for apartments. The studio had a full, working kitchen, bathroom,&nbsp; and a small room with a bed so, I could just stay there for a little while. The day dragged on, but, eventually, I got through it. About 10pm, with nothing else to do, I decided to hit the sack. I didn&#8217;t get much sleep the night before, as you can imagine. I stripped down to my Jockey shorts and drifted off. Suddenly I woke up. I thought I heard a noise. I sat up and listened very closely. There it was again. Someone was in the studio. I got on my feet and approached the shooting room. There, in front of me, were five figures. I knew they were men by their size. I had no idea who they were, but I didn&#8217;t think they were up to any good. I kicked out at the first guy and caught him right in the knee. He hollered out in pain. �Gary, take it easy, nobody&#8217;s out to hurt you,� a voice said. It was pretty dark in there, but I recognized the voice right away. It was Pete! I swung as hard as I could and caught him on his ear. �Damn,� he said as he almost went down to the floor. With that I felt a sharp pain from a kidney punch one of them landed. Before I could react to that another blow landed in my stomach and I doubled over. Someone pulled my face up by my hair and another one of them punched me on the side of my eye. I was fighting to remain conscience when the lights went on and I heard the unmistakable voice of my, soon to be ex, wife. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Stop!� she said, �You&#8217;re not supposed to hurt him. Damn it. Don&#8217;t touch him.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Tell him that,� I knew it was Pete&#8217;s voice. �He just about broke Jim&#8217;s knee and my ear is still ringing.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I could feel her gentle touch on my eye. �I&#8217;m so sorry, honey, nobody wants to hurt you my dear. Please, just relax. I know you hate me now, but, in time you&#8217;ll forgive me, I know you will. You love me as much as I love you, you can&#8217;t just turn that off. Now just relax, please. These men are going to have sex with you. I&#8217;m going to take some pictures.&nbsp; I know I&#8217;m not the photographer you are, but, believe me, these will be good enough that you won&#8217;t want them shown around. So, as long as you come back to me, nothing will happen. Believe me, honey, this is the best for all of us. I could feel the guys trying to position me on my hands and knees. I got in one more shot to someone&#8217;s rib cage. �Mother fucker,� I heard him yell. Just then someone hit me in the back, hard and I went down.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I could hear Judy crying. �Please, please, Gary, please stop fighting.� With some trouble they finally had me in position. One guy stood in front of me and pulled out his dick. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Okay now, you&#8217;re going to suck my cock while your wife takes some nice pictures and I don&#8217;t want any more trouble from you, hear me?� I still had some fight left in me.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You stick that thing in my mouth, go ahead, I dare you. I&#8217;ll bite it right in half, mother fucker.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No you wont&#8217;, because if I feel any teeth on my cock I&#8217;ll knock out every one of your teeth.� I didn&#8217;t know who this was, all I knew is that it wasn&#8217;t Pete.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That&#8217;s okay,� I said refusing to yield, �it&#8217;ll be worth it because I&#8217;ll swallow your fucking cock before you do it.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�This guy&#8217;s nuts, Pete, no way I&#8217;m sticking my dick in this guy&#8217;s mouth.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Okay, okay,� now that was Pete&#8217;s voice, �just fuck him then, he can&#8217;t bite it off from back there.�&nbsp; With that I felt my ass being lubricated, then I felt the head of someone&#8217;s cock at my ass hole. With out any foreplay, he shoved it in. I could see the flash of my wife&#8217;s compact digital going off. The pain was intense, but I was not about to yell. I did, however, allow my face to show the pain from the intrusion. More and more the guy behind me forced his cock into me. Judy&#8217;s flash was going off from all directions. I was hoping the guy would ejaculate inside of me so, I actually started moving my hips a little, trying to get him to cum. Once of the guys saw me and said hey look, he&#8217;s getting into it. That brought a few laughs at my expense, but I didn&#8217;t care. These guys would soon regret this. Finally it was over. I guess my wife felt that she had enough pictures to blackmail me into coming back home and acting as if all was forgiven. I couldn&#8217;t believe, that in her twisted mind, she thought that would be possible after what just happened. All I could think of was that she had gone over the top some how after being caught. They handcuffed my hands behind my back before leaving. My wife gave Pete the camera for safe keeping and was staying behind, I guess to talk. She also had the key to the cuffs. Pete asked if she really thought it was a good idea for her to stay behind. The man is a lunatic, he said, are you sure you&#8217;ll be alright. Of course she said, she was confident I still loved her and would never hurt her. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh honey,� she said as she touch my, now swelling eye again, �why did you have to fight so much. Don&#8217;t you know how much I love you?�&nbsp; I was pulling on the cuffs behind my back. I wanted deep marks left behind.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�If you love me you&#8217;ll take these cuffs off, they hurt,� I said. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She looked into my eyes, �Can I trust you? You won&#8217;t try to hurt me will you honey?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You know I could never physically hurt you.� She bent over me and removed the cuffs. She flinched a little as I quickly got up and went for my cell phone. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What are you doing?� she asked, �it&#8217;s 3 o&#8217;clock in the morning, who are you calling at this hour?� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�The police of course.� There was that same look of horror I saw on her face the day before. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�The police, why?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Why, you were just complicit in a rape, that&#8217;s&nbsp; a felony. Did you really think,� just then the police answered the phone. �Yes, I&#8217;d like to report a rape��me. Yes, I don&#8217;t know everyone involved, but I know Pete Jeffers was one of them and my wife set it up. Pete Jeffers drives a blue Pontiac and has a camera with him in the car with evidence of the rape if you can get him before he gets home, he&#8217;s probably on the Kennedy by now�No, my wife is still here with me�.yes, one of them ejaculated in me so I&#8217;ll need a rape kit. I also have several bruises and my eye is almost swollen shut from them punching me. Okay, I&#8217;m at Asher&#8217;s photographic studio�.you know where that&#8217;s at�..okay, I&#8217;ll wait here. Thanks.�&nbsp; I looked at my wife as I hung up. She sat there in stunned silence. �As I see it, Judy, you can sit there and try to explain to the police that you had me raped by five guys because you love me so much, or you might want to take off and try to run. The choice is yours.�&nbsp; Just then I saw flashing lights at my front door. �Oops,� I said, �too late, they&#8217;re already here.� 

Epilog;
The police arrested Judy for conspiracy to commit rape. They caught Pete with the camera in the car which also had the faces of the other rapists. They did a rape kit on me in the hospital and that was used to further charge the guy who stuck his cock in ass. He was charged with first degree rape and aggravated assault. He got five years in Joliet prison. Pete and Judy, along with the other guys, got shorter sentences and was able to serve their time in Cook County Jail. 
Of course Pete&#8217;s marriage was over when they arrested him. His wife sued him for everything he had, liquidated everything and moved out of state with his two kids.&nbsp; I divorced Judy, of course, and, due to the rape conviction, I got everything, including Tammy. She doesn&#8217;t know everything that happened, but she knows her mother got sick and needed help. I got a great job offer from a former client who moved his business to California. He would supply me with studio space and I would do all his advertising photography. I could also do jobs on the side as long as it didn&#8217;t affect what I did for him.
Tammy is now twelve, has lots of great friends, and never asks about her mother anymore. Sammy still calls me from time to time from Chicago. He told me he thought he saw Judy in a bar, but she looks so bad he wasn&#8217;t positive it was really her. He said it looked like she was on drugs and probably hooking to feed her habit if it was her.
I sincerely hope it wasn&#8217;t her. With everything she did, I&#8217;ll always have a place in my heart for her. I guess it&#8217;s true, what they say, true love never dies.
