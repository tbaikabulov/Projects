The Library
By: Wondering Soul

Part I
In all factual truth the library is the perfect place to stalk someone. The shelves being the perfect hiding place, peeking through to glare at them can be easily masked as looking for a book. It was this exact reason that Mark chose the R. S. Killington Library as his hunting grounds. He was looking for four girls. This may seem strange to go to a library searching for teenage girls, but he had a thing for smart girls. He enjoyed breaking the mental resolve of someone who thought they knew everything, or if they didn&#8217;t know it that they could find some book that would teach them. In the year 2900 time travel was an option that he greatly took advantage of. For years he had been saving money. When I say saving money, I mean billions upon billions. He had set up a rather nice house hidden away in the back country of Denver. Filled with everything he would need to live a life of sensual pleasure. His partners Anthony, Kyle, and Jeremy would be living with him. They had equipped the house with all the devices of the future necessary for their needs. 
The poster announcing the library slumber party was unceremoniously tapped to the library bulleting board surrounded by apartment listings and book sale announcements. I had noticed it on my way in, but I ignored it thinking it was for the younger girls as such things usually were. I spent most of my summer in the library and would have loved to go to a sleepover there. I glided through the doors into the book haven I so often called home. The library had a double stair case. One was a wrought iron dragon&#8217;s back with fake gems for eyes and scales the other was his tale. I quickly alighted up his back and found my favorite love sack and picked up the book I kept hidden under it. 
The librarian knew me all to well and had left me a small note with a copy of the slumber party brochure. 





Lindsey:
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I figured that you would ignore the flyers. Well we have decided that the older girls deserve a little party fun to so I think you should come. I really think you would enjoy it. J
Sincerely, 
Mrs. Clammerton
P.S. Samantha, Courtney, and Robin will be there as well!

I think she hoped that that would sway me and she was correct. The party was tomorrow night. I called my mom and asked her if I could go. I left the note and my book on top of the sack and went to register. 

You may be wondering who I am and what my significance is, but you need wonder no longer. My name is Lindsey and I am one of the victims of these cruel and wonderful men, to be specific Mark. This is my story. I will tell the rest to you like he told it to me. 
I had been watching her the whole time. From the minute she had entered the door. Her curvaceous 5&#8217;8 frame caught my attention immediately as she walked into the door. Her hair settled graciously against her back lightly grazing the top of her butt just slightly. Her chest was, if I had to guess, 38 DD and fit her body perfectly. She was an angel and I had to have her. I watched her from a corner farther back than hers. I had found her, now how to capture her. I saw her leave and went to see what she had left behind. A book that was of no consequence to me and two sheets of paper one with a note from the librarian and a brochure for a sleepover here at the library. I let a sly smile come cross my face I had my trap. 
I let my plan form in my head. I still hadn&#8217;t found three others, but the three on the note seemed as good as any. I didn&#8217;t particularly care about the girls that weren&#8217;t mine, but when I saw them walk up the steps with my Lindsey I knew that would be acceptable. I looked back at the flyer and smiled they were the perfect age. It was a goodbye party for the seniors. My luck just seemed to be getting better and better. My plan was perfect; it was old school with a little futuristic twist. Folding up the paper I looked over at the girls in the corner and began stroking the growing bulge in my jeans envisioning everything that would happen to them. 
I snuck in and hid in the back I knew that they never checked the bathrooms at the far back of the library. I waited patiently the girls giggled and laughed. Then everything went dark the girls were supposed to be asleep. My original plan was to simply take them in their sleep, but a couple of the girls decided for a late night game of flashlight tag, my victims included. I smiled once again and slipped out my night vision glasses on I searched for her. My own and I found her hiding behind a large bookcase on crime and punishment. Befitting of what I was about to do. I pulled the chloroform rag from the bag and quickly put it over her mouth. I had had to guestimate on the dosage and I was correct she was out within seconds. 
I picked her lovingly up into my arms and carried her back to my hiding spot. I had to resist I intricately tide her hands silk scarves. Effectively keeping her hands behind her back while looking like the work of artist, that was my specialty. Her chest gently moved up and down. She was gorgeous and she would be mine. A put a black blindfold over her eyes and went to capture my other victims. There stories are just as interesting, but are to be told later. 

Part II

I woke up in a dark room. My hands were tied behind my back and I felt people around me. I tried talking to them. After a couple of minutes of silence, my heart pounding violently in my chest and my longs feeling like they would burst if I didn&#8217;t breath, I heard a voice. �Lindsey, is that you?� I recognized that voice it was Sam. I wondered but I didn&#8217;t have to wait long soon Courtney and Robin&#8217;s voices cried out. All I could think was, Where were we and why were we here?...
 I had noticed that she had woken up a little ahead of my plans, but it gave me another idea that would work nicely with my plans. I quickly walked down the steps to the room where I had them held. Lindsey would be the first to be broken. She was the strongest she was mine. I knew everything about her. After I had gotten home yesterday I did my research on her. Albeit information no normal kidnapper could get. I pulled up school records, grades, memberships, blogs, and the private feed from the camera her father kept in her room. Her father was a wealthy member of the community and he had his hands in many businesses. Still that didn&#8217;t matter to me I didn&#8217;t want a ransom I wanted her. I watched hours of her reading, sleeping, and masturbating. I watched as the blush came to her face as she reached that most heavenly peak. I saw how her body ached and quivered for the wonderful feeling it brought her. The blogs were equally as interesting, though not as fun for me. She told her secretes, fears, aspirations on that blog I knew how she thought. I knew that right now she though there was a way out of this there always was.
I had all I needed to make her mine. I turned off the light before opening the door. I knew where she was, but still put on the glasses. I picked her up and closed the door on the screams of the other girls. I set her down before we reached the steps and began whispering in her ear. 
�Lindsey, I&#8217;m taking you as mine. I&#8217;m going to fuck and torture you everyday like the good little slut you are. I&#8217;m going to make you cum until it hurts and then I&#8217;m going to keep going until you pass out from the intensity of it. I&#8217;ll wake you up and start all over again. I&#8217;m going to know everything there is to know about you. You&#8217;ll never have another secret again. But I&#8217;m doing all of this because I love you more than anything. I&#8217;ll punish you when you&#8217;re bad and reward you when you&#8217;re good, but first things first�� I placed my hand firmly over her nose and mouth until she passed out into my arms. I wanted the affect of her waking up repeatedly in different scenarios. I hoped it would add to the fear.
I walked up the stairs and turned into the room of her torture. It was furnished with a large bed in the middle perfect for tying someone down. The sheets were black and red silk with pillows of the same. I wanted her to hate and love this room. Right now I left it cold. The only light was a harsh white light spotlight illuminating the bed only. I laid her gently down on the bed and undid her hands and retied them to hidden bolts in the post of the bed. I sat on the edge and grabbed the smelling salts and scissors from the table beside the bed. I gently waved the smelling salts under her nose and soon her eyes groggily began to open. 
As I woke up I saw this gorgeous man above me. His hair was wavy and brown and his deep dark eyes looking down at me. Something about them was cruel and loving about them. His face was well chiseled face cracked a smile of the likes I had never seen. He began talking to me and I couldn&#8217;t help but listen. �Well Lindsey, I&#8217;m glad to finally see you are awake. There will be time for introductions later. For now we need to get rid of your old life. Now first things first, let&#8217;s get rid of your clothes.� I couldn&#8217;t help it the anger boiled up and set me on fire. �You sick son of a bitch don&#8217;t you touch me. Let me go!� I started pulling at my bindings. I looked back up at him and saw that his face had fallen, little did I know, when he got this evil grin on his face, that I was in big trouble. He whispered in my ear saying, �Well now we could have done this an easier way, but I guess we will just have to settle for these.� My eyes gapped wide as he held up the giant silver scissors.
�At this precise hour eighteen years ago you were born, and at this precise hour now you are going to be reborn as mine.� That was the first time I cried in a long time. I let a single tear fall down my cheek.
I hadn&#8217;t expected anything better than this, but still it was a shock. I made sure to let the cold scissors touch her skin as snipped the thin spaghetti straps of her top. Then straight down and slow. To quote my favorite author, I cut at a place that was measured and slow. The pants followed and then the bra. I made sure to stare into her read eyes. Her tear stained face looked back at me. I placed the scissors at her hips snipping both edges of her panties. Then I moved up and slid them straight own. Making sure to enter her slit, I finally cut away the last of her clothing. The last of her old life was gone, she was mine. I smiled and placed my hand over her mouth and nose for the final time. 
I let the smelling salts rest under her nose and had her wake up. I guess if I needed to describe the look on her face as she woke up to my fingers exploring her vagina, I guess I would describe it as confusion and shock and repulsion and passion. I smiled up at her as I place the minute vibrating chip right on her g-spot and then stroked along the inside before pulling out placing one on her clit. I heard the intake of breath as I did and smiled. Now for the next part, I wasn&#8217;t very masochistic but what I really liked was the use of pleasure to the point of pain. My tortured involved continuous orgasms that left her body shaking and her mouth begging for me to stop and that was the plan here. Earlier on I had given her a hormone and sensual enhancer. By the time those little vibrators were done she would be so ridiculously close to an orgasm that she would be a babbling mess that would o anything for me and she would finally be broken or at least partially broken. 
I still needed to test the medicine to make sure it was in effect. I lazily dragged my tongue across the exposed parts of her clit and gently suckled on it. She elicited a long moan and her pussy was instantly drenched. Still all the while she cried. I moved myself up and straddled her and whispered in her ear �So will you willingly give me your body, mind and soul. Will you allow me to take you place and trust me to only have your well being in mind. In turn will you fulfill my every need and do everything I ask of you with out question and hesitation. Go through anything I decide to put you through. Will you let me be your Master? Will you be mine?� There was a momentary pause before she smiled and said �Fuck you, you disgusting piece of crap!� I smiled back and said �I figured as much, so I&#8217;ll leave you to your thoughts.�
As I walked away I activated the vibrators. They slowly released a chemical for another purpose to be discussed at a later date. I sat in a chair not to far away from her, but still she couldn&#8217;t see me I watched as the vibrators mixed with the enhancers did their work. She began writhing and sheens of sweat covered her body. It was on a relatively low level, she would never get there. She was gorgeous, her body screaming for release. Her juice smelled like flowers I slowly stroked myself. Three hours had passed when I hear her begging and soon I heard it the one thing I was dying to hear, �Please�Please�Please Master please.� It was musical, her voice was wavering and watery because of her tears and just under that tone you could hear fear.

Fear of what exactly was coming out of her mouth. I got up slowly and walked over to her. �Say it all and I&#8217;ll fix it. Tell me it all and I will make it all better.� I pushed the vibe up a level and began to stroke her hair. Her voice trembled as she let it out. I gradual increased the vibrations as she spoke. �I willingly give myself to you. I accept you as my master and agree to allow you to control and rule me. I submit and except you as my lord and master. I will be yours.� I smiled and kissed her on the lips as the vibe made it all the way to the hot and she climaxed. Her back arched a mile off the bed. She screamed into my mouth as I kissed her, her arms and legs pulling hard at the bindings. She collapsed after 7 minutes and passed out. 
Untying her arms and legs, I went and lit a fire and set out some diffuser sticks, cinnamon, and undressed down to my boxers. I pulled her into my arms. I would let her rest tonight. She had gone through enough. She woke up in my arms. Her eyelashes clumped together with tears, she moved closer to me with out realizing it, her head pressed lightly into my chest. �I&#8217;ll hold you to your word.� She silently continued crying pressing herself firmly into my chest. Of course this mainly because I wouldn&#8217;t let her go. I stroked her back as she fell asleep. Tomorrow is going to be the start of something new. 

To be continued�maybe I need responses this story might not be worth continuing�J
