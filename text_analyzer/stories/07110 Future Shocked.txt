Future Shocked, Really Shocked
By Ayla Jaxxon&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Damn."&nbsp; The truck slowed, coasting until the driver pulled over to the side of the road and came to a stop.&nbsp; "Damn, damn, damn."&nbsp; Ayla Jackson let out a deep sigh and unbuckled her seatbelt.&nbsp; She got out and opened the hood of the pickup.&nbsp; "Shit.&nbsp; I have no idea what I'm looking for."&nbsp; She looked at the engine, it wasn&#8217;t smoking, all the tubes were attached to something or the other, the battery had cables hooked to it.&nbsp; The truck had just�died.&nbsp; She wiped her hands on her jeans and got back in. Trying the key again, she heard nothing, not a sound, not even a click.&nbsp; It could have been worse, she was pulling a trailer but it was empty now.&nbsp; She had delivered two horses about an hour ago; two horses in a trailer, broken down on the side of the road, would have sucked.&nbsp; So now she was stuck in the middle of nowhere, alone; she hadn't seen another car for some time.&nbsp; "Thank God for cell phones."&nbsp; She flipped her phone open and�nothing.&nbsp; The screen was black.&nbsp; It wasn't even 'searching for signal'.&nbsp; "Son of a bitch!&nbsp; I just charged this thing last night!"&nbsp; She stomped her cowboy booted foot in frustration.&nbsp; She looked up and down the road; the last farm she had seen was miles ago.&nbsp; She could walk it...if she had too.&nbsp;&nbsp; She smiled, "On second thought, having a horse would not have been all that bad."&nbsp;&nbsp; She decided that waiting with the truck was probably the smartest thing to do�at least for now anyway.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She had grown up in Indiana, you couldn't be this isolated in Indiana, there where you couldn't throw a rock without hitting a corn or soybean field.&nbsp; They moved out west a few years back.&nbsp; She finished collage out here, a semester early she might add.&nbsp; Ayla had always wanted to live here, but distance was measured in hours in the west, and she was HOURS from home.&nbsp; Her Dad would not be pleased that she broke down.&nbsp; Usually he did these all day deliveries, or her older brother.&nbsp; Ayla had brushed aside his concerns and convinced him that there would be no worries if she did this one alone.&nbsp; She was a confident girl, smart, and had an independent nature.&nbsp; That didn't keep her from living on her folk's property�.but she had her own place, a little old house that was there when they bought the land.&nbsp; They called it "The Cabin" but it was just a little house.&nbsp; She was comfortable there.&nbsp; Her father's "hobby, slash business" was buying horses cheap at auction, getting them on a good diet and giving them some basic training, and then selling them to good homes at a small profit.&nbsp; She helped him with that for room and board.&nbsp; She worked nights in a bar to save money.&nbsp; Eventually she would have to get a real job, maybe forestry or with natural resources.&nbsp; But for now, this was fine.&nbsp; However, right this instant, things could be better.&nbsp; Between the awful gas prices and this little set back, her dad's profits for this deal were gone.&nbsp; AND he might have a thing or two to say about his "little girl" being stuck out here all by her lonesome�&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was hot.&nbsp; Leaning back in the seat of the pickup, she pulled her peach colored tee-shirt away from her body to let some air in.&nbsp; "Surely somebody drives this road!" she said out loud.&nbsp;&nbsp; She really didn't have to wait long.&nbsp; About twenty minutes later she heard a vehicle coming from behind, sounded like something with a lot of "oomph".&nbsp; Ayla got out and stood next to the truck.&nbsp; A truck with the hood up and a pretty girl standing next to it was the universal signal for "stop".&nbsp; And he did.&nbsp; A sporty little car pulled up to her.&nbsp; The driver leaned down to talk through the passenger side window, "Need help?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla leaned in.&nbsp; "Ya, it just quit on me.&nbsp; Do you have a phone I could use?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Sure, hold on."&nbsp; He was a pretty good looking guy, a little clean cut for Ayla's tastes which ran towards big rugged guys with beards.&nbsp; Her friends said she had a "Mountain man fetish"; God, if they only knew what her REAL fetish was!&nbsp; This fellow was more the upwardly mobile business type.&nbsp; He seemed very out of place here.&nbsp; He flipped open his phone, "Sorry, I'm not getting a signal.&nbsp; Are you out of gas?"&nbsp; His suit jacket was folded over the passenger seat and his tie was loose around his neck, his top button undone.&nbsp; There was an open laptop on the seat as well, facing him. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla tried not to give him a dirty look about the gas comment.&nbsp; "Nope, all good, and it's not the battery either."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Sorry, I'm no mechanic." said the guy. "But I'd be happy to give you a lift.&nbsp; Do you live around here?"&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla bit her lip, considering.&nbsp; "Ummm�not really.&nbsp; I dropped off some stock near Cloverton.&nbsp; How close are we to Delmont?&nbsp; I could call home from there. I'm gonna need a tow truck too."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He got out a map and opened it where she could see.&nbsp; "Looks like it's about twenty miles.&nbsp; Hop in, I'll take you.&nbsp; It's on my way." 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla sized him up.&nbsp; Fancy car.&nbsp; Well dressed.&nbsp; Clean cut, friendly.&nbsp; She figured he might flirt with her a bit, but heck, she might flirt back.&nbsp; He certainly didn't look like an axe murderer.&nbsp; 'O.K. Thanks." She flashed her most dazzling smile, and then ran back to the truck to lock up and grab her fanny pack.&nbsp; The driver cleared off the front seat to make room for her.&nbsp; "Nice car." she said as she got in.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Thanks, it gets me where I need to go."&nbsp; He had a pretty dazzling smile himself.&nbsp; "As you can guess, I like to take the scenic route.&nbsp; Lucky I came by.&nbsp; By the way, I'm Max, Max Romulus."&nbsp; He offered his hand.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She took it. "Ayla Jackson, nice to meetcha."&nbsp; She buckled her seatbelt.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Off they went.&nbsp; "Looks like we'll go through a corner of the state forest; Delmont is just on the other side."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She nodded and they drove in silence for a bit.&nbsp; He told her that he worked for a large research firm, in personnel acquisitions, but that was all he said for a while.&nbsp;&nbsp; Finally, he looked at her a bit quizzically and asked, "Did you say your name was Ayla Jackson?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Mmhmm."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"How do you spell that?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"A..y..l
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No, Jackson." 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She raised an eyebrow at him, "You want to know how to spell Jackson?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well," he shrugged, "it could be spelled Jackson or it could be spelled Jaxxon, with two X's."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She gave him a sharp look, and then turned away quickly. "I guess it could�"&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I met a girl once, well not a real girl, an online girl.&nbsp; Her name was Ayla Jaxxon.&nbsp; Two X's."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla stiffened. "That's interesting." She said, a tad too lightly.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Max nodded, "Yes, I play this online game called Second Life.&nbsp; Ever heard of it?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She shook her head without taking her eyes off the road.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"And here's the weirdest part, you look just like her, well almost, she was really tall."&nbsp; Ayla, the real Ayla, was 5' 6".&nbsp; "But you've got the same dark wavy hair, except yours is tied back in a pony tail and the online avatar, that&#8217;s what we call out little cartoon selves, has flowing hair."&nbsp; She didn't look at him.&nbsp; "You're both very pretty and you have the same�umm�.figure.&nbsp; Sorry but it's hard not to notice."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I have no idea what you're talking about, Max."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Really?&nbsp; Because this is a huge coincidence, you have the same name basically, and the same look.&nbsp; How do you feel about bondage?&nbsp; This chick was a huge bondage freak."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Stop the car."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Ayla, I'm really sorry.&nbsp; But you have to admit that it's pretty odd."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Stop the car!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Ayla, I can't leave you stranded out here, that's crazy.&nbsp; Tell you what, let's just pretend that you really aren't the same person that I met online.&nbsp;&nbsp; That's fine." He paused for a few minutes, then said, "But if you WERE the same girl, you would find what I was about to tell you very interesting�.What if I told you that there's a place where all the wacky stuff, well, a lot of the wacky stuff that we can do online in Second Life, is really possible?"&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She turned to him with a "do you think I'm an idiot?" look.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He laughed, "No, really.&nbsp; Where I from, we have technological advances that most people can only dream of.&nbsp; And it's not outer space either.&nbsp; I live on the Isle of Tarcrete."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Never heard of it."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No, of course you haven't.&nbsp; Very few have, only the major world leaders and those of us who live there.&nbsp; We can't do the Second Life type of flying there, not without the right tools anyway...and we don't have instant teleportation.&nbsp; But we can do many amazing things."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You're a Looney.&nbsp; Stop the car."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He just laughed.&nbsp; "You are a stubborn girl, that's good.&nbsp;&nbsp; The reason no one knows about us is because that's the way we want it, and we have the technology to�how shall I put this�.fuck the world over, should we care to.&nbsp; It behooves foreign governments to leave us be and keep us secret."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Let me get this straight," said Ayla.&nbsp; "You live on an unknown island, with super advanced technology, and you hold the world's leaders under your doomsday device button pushing thumb?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes, that's pretty much it."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Stop this goddamned car!" Her hands where fists.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh well," he answered.&nbsp; "I was planning on letting you ride in comfort for as long as possible�"&nbsp; He flipped a switch on the steering column.&nbsp; Several things happened at once.&nbsp; Ayla saw a blur in front of her eyes, a strap, nylon webbing just like the seatbelt, shot over her head from behind.&nbsp; It tightened around her immediately, catching her under her breasts and pinning her arms to her sides.&nbsp;&nbsp; A second strap, also from behind and an instant later, hit her just above her breasts, it angled downward in its constriction, pulling her back and down into the seat painfully.&nbsp; Two more straps came up from the floorboard and pinned her legs to the front of the seat, the webbing taut across each of her shins.&nbsp; As this was happening, a part of the seat between her legs, a piece shaped like a movie theater armrest, flipped up and pressed hard against her most sensitive area, it clicked, locking into place.&nbsp; There would be no sliding forward in this seat.&nbsp; Only her arms, below the elbows, were free.&nbsp; After a brief instant of shock, Ayla started struggling; there wasn't much she could do.&nbsp; Her hands were pressing against the hard bar sticking up between her legs, it would not budge.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You mother fucking son of a bitch!!!" she shouted.&nbsp; "Let me go goddammit!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Ayla�"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You piece of shit!&nbsp; You asshole!&nbsp; Unlock me!!!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Ayla�"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Undo this right now you shithead fuckwad!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He pressed a little button on his armrest, just like the ones that make automatic windows go up and down�except this one wasn't for the windows.&nbsp; The two straps across her chest tightened further.&nbsp; Her elbows dug into her sides, her breasts were misshapen, bulging upwards.&nbsp; She could barely breathe.&nbsp; She gasped and wheezed.&nbsp; Terror gripped her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Behave."&nbsp; He said calmly.&nbsp; "Those straps can break your ribs if I don't stop."&nbsp; He released the tension somewhat and she took heaving gulps of air.&nbsp; She looked at him with fear and anger.&nbsp; "And you should know, he continued," there is another strap that I can deploy.&nbsp; It goes around your neck."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She snarled, "You motherfuc�"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Tsk tsk tsk," he admonished, tapping the strap button. "Language." 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She glared at him in silence.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh, and the device pressed against your pussy is an electro muscle inhibiting stun pain inducer."&nbsp; He motioned to a button next to his thumb on the steering wheel. "It hurts like hell, but it also shuts off any messages your muscles receive from your brain. You are paralyzed and in agony at the same time if I hit this.&nbsp; Can't even blink for about a minute afterwards.&nbsp; Care to try it?"&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She just continued to glare, but now with more fear than anger.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;'That's better.&nbsp; Let me tell you where we're going."&nbsp; He relaxed into his seat.&nbsp; "The Isle of Tarcrete is a pacific island, a bit bigger than Hawaii main.&nbsp; My ancestors moved there right before the fall of the Roman Empire.&nbsp; The great genius, Gnaeus, built the most advanced ship of his day, when around the world looking for the finest minds to inhabit a new utopia.&nbsp; He started the Tarcrete culture.&nbsp; They dedicated themselves to scientific thinking.&nbsp;&nbsp; We are a people of technology and the pursuit of social well being.&nbsp; The social well being that we came up with, is hedonism.&nbsp; Hey, our founder came from Rome."&nbsp; He smiled as he talked. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla tried to gather her wits.&nbsp; This guy was obviously insane.&nbsp; But he would have to stop sometime.&nbsp; She needed a plan.&nbsp;&nbsp; She had a knife.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her Dad used to be a scoutmaster when her brother was young and insisted that she always "be prepared" just like the boys in his troop.&nbsp; She had a folding knife, a good one, in her right front pocket.&nbsp; She also had a lighter even though she didn't smoke because, as Dad said, "You never know when you need to build a fire."&nbsp; She inched her hand towards her pocket.&nbsp; If she could just get to it, she could wait until he stopped for gas or to take a leak or something.&nbsp; She could cut these fucking straps and, if she had to, stab him in his freaking neck.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Are you going for your knife already Ayla?" he said without looking. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She froze.&nbsp; "No�what knife�?"&nbsp;&nbsp; She caught a glimpse of movement, his thumb on the wheel�she just had time for her eyes to widen and her mouth opened to shout in protest.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The pain was horrific.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was like searing daggers stabbing into her crotch.&nbsp; She should have been screaming, she WAS screaming in her head.&nbsp; Her whole body was shaking uncontrollable, violently.&nbsp; White lightening bolts filled her vision.&nbsp; Every nerve was on fire.&nbsp; When it was over, she slumped.&nbsp; Her eyes were still open, staring at her own legs.&nbsp; She couldn't move.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Max flipped open a panel on the dash and typed in a code.&nbsp; "Automatic pilot," he said casually.&nbsp; He then leaned over and dug into Ayla's pocket, pulling out the knife.&nbsp; "I really figured that you would wait until we stopped to try this."&nbsp;&nbsp; He leaned back, letting the car speed along on its plotted course.&nbsp; "You don't believe a word that I'm saying, I know.&nbsp; But it's true."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She blinked, and then again several times.&nbsp; She raised her head slowly and looked at him.&nbsp; She tried not to; she really did�.but it hurt so much, she was overwhelmed with fear.&nbsp; She broke down sobbing.&nbsp; "Oh God oh God please let me go please please please!&nbsp; Don't hurt me please please." She was babbling, panic-stricken.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He just waited, watching her with a studious eye.&nbsp; "It's a real wake her upper, isn't it, Ayla?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Please please please"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "There, there, dear, I don't think we'll have to use that again, will we?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No no no no no no��please!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Good girl." He went right back into story telling mode. "So I told you why the world leaves us alone, but our "Doomsday devise" as you put it, is really one of your own making.&nbsp; Our greatest weapon is the same one I used on your truck, it simply turns things off.&nbsp; We can turn off anything�cars, trains�airplanes in flight��computers, nuclear missile silos.&nbsp; We click, and you get nothing.&nbsp;&nbsp; We could also make any nuclear weapon go off right where it sits, but that would be messy."&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla was beginning to believe, the pain in her mind still a memory of what was possible.&nbsp;&nbsp; She was almost ready to believe anything just to avoid its repeat.&nbsp; Anything he said�just please don't do it again.&nbsp; She fought to regain some modicum of composure.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"And why, I hear you ask, don't we just take over the world?&nbsp; Why not Total World Domination?!"&nbsp; He chuckled.&nbsp; "Who wants it?&nbsp; What a pain that would be.&nbsp; No, our culture went a different direction.&nbsp; We want domination, sure�but not World Domination, we satisfy ourselves with�.individual�..domination."&nbsp; He looked at her. "That's where you come in."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla licked her lips.&nbsp; She spoke hoarsely, "You�dominate�individuals?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes dear.&nbsp; I expected you to get this more quickly.&nbsp; I know you're not stupid, I've been researching you for months."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla did have an idea of what he was talking about.&nbsp; She had some understanding of domination, and submission.&nbsp; She had fantasies, lots of them, but she didn't act them out.&nbsp; She was no "lifestyler". Her only real concession to her�darker�desires was playing as a submissive to a very clever Mistress on that damned Second Life game.&nbsp; "I�.I know what you're talking about�.but�you can't do this to me in real life!&nbsp; It's just a game�.I'm not her�.I was just pretending�"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No, you weren&#8217;t.&nbsp; Let's see," he looked up thinking.&nbsp; "You had a boyfriend in college that you convinced to tie you up for sex three times."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She looked at him, confused. "No one knows that...I didn't tell�"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"And just recently you recently bought yourself a pair of handcuffs."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh my God!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You visit websites with pictures of girls in bondage, you like the more extreme ones."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She just stared at him in disbelief.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"And of course, I've recorded every word you typed, and heard, while you played on Second Life.&nbsp;&nbsp; You were very good at emoting, Ayla, but your typing sucks.&nbsp; I've also watched you in your home while you play, with infra enhanced satellite cameras; you are a very nasty girl, Ayla.&nbsp; Tying your own rope body harness, pleasuring yourself on command�."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"OH MY GOD!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Max continued to look thoughtful, "Your online Mistress is really quite good.&nbsp; She attracts quality girls.&nbsp; In fact, your sisters are just as lovely as you are and I plan to take them as well.&nbsp;&nbsp; Poor Mistress Alt, she's going to wonder what happened to all of you." He paused with a smile, "Actually, she would fit right in on our island�..as a dominator� I'll get permission to recruit her too."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"This is crazy, you can't just take people!&nbsp; Somebody is bound to notice!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Darling, your own government would cover up any disappearance that we tell them to.&nbsp; They, like you, have no choice."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The bound and helpless girl continued to stare at him, her mind reeling.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I've set up a rendezvous with one of our jets.&nbsp; It won't be long until we get there.&nbsp; In the meantime, I should tell you just a few things about your new life, but not too much.&nbsp; I don't want to ruin all the surprises.&nbsp; You will be a "Non", a non-citizen.&nbsp; You will have no rights what so ever.&nbsp; Forget all that submissive versus slave stuff, you are a slave, a pet, a beast of burden.&nbsp; You will be whatever a Citizen says you are."&nbsp; He looked at her, smiling at her dumbfounded expression.&nbsp; "You may be kept by anyone that catches you.&nbsp; They may or may not keep you forever, their choice. We have the whole range of dominant personalities, some more sadistic than others."&nbsp; His face hardened, "Ayla, killing you is not against the law on Tarcrete."&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She swallowed hard.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"But don't worry, my sweet.&nbsp; Killing slaves isn't really very common.&nbsp; It's too much fun torturing you."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That was too much.&nbsp; Ayla went wild.&nbsp; Her hands clutched and pulled at anything she could reach.&nbsp; Her head thrashed back and forth as she uttered a pitiful, guttural moan.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Max flicked a switch.&nbsp; The neck strap whizzed over her head and tightened about her throat.&nbsp; Her skull was forced back against the headrest.&nbsp; She froze, fearing that her air would be cut off but the device stopped just short of choking her.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"As I was saying," he continued, "You will be fair game to all citizens, to do with as they please.&nbsp; No more silly little fantasy life for you, Ayla dear.&nbsp; You are now a real sex slave."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla closed her eyes; a tear ran down her cheek.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Max took over the cars controls and soon made a turn onto a hidden drive somewhere in the state forest.&nbsp; They bumped their way through a narrow passage until they came to a rather small clearing.&nbsp; The "jet" was there.&nbsp; It was a hybrid between a futuristic looking private jet and a helicopter.&nbsp;&nbsp; There were two men, two very large men built like tanks, standing at ease in front of the plane.&nbsp; Both wore black fatigues and dark sunglasses.&nbsp; Max pulled up near them.&nbsp; He turned to Ayla.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Listen to me girl," She was still looking at the weird plane and the two scary men.&nbsp; Max gave her a stinging slap to the cheek.&nbsp; "Listen." He held her gaze, "There may come a time when you will get a chance to fight back.&nbsp; A chance to get away even if only for a while�now is not that time."&nbsp; She looked at him, intently. "Ayla, these men are professionals.&nbsp; Either of them could snap your neck without effort.&nbsp; If you try to run, if you try to fight�you will be hurt.&nbsp; Do you understand?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She could barely nod, her neck strapped as it was, but she tried, and croaked out an "I understand."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"And, you don't want me to have to use the electro muscle inhibiting stun pain inducer, do you?" She tried to shake her head, her eyes wide.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Good girl."&nbsp; He signaled the men and one of them opened her door.&nbsp; For the first time, she saw a gurney there behind the two men.&nbsp; The hospital table on wheels unnerved her even further.&nbsp; She started to shake.&nbsp; "Ayla, remember.&nbsp; Be good.&nbsp; They are going to help you out of the car and onto that table, and you are going to let them.&nbsp; Right?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes, ok."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The straps loosened and smoothly recessed to the pre-binding position.&nbsp; One of the men took a firm grip on Ayla's upper arm and pulled her out.&nbsp; The other man took her other arm and the two of them picked her up as though she was as light as a child.&nbsp; She was facing behind, the men forward, as they took just a few steps and laid her down on the table.&nbsp; She didn't even have time to think about fighting.&nbsp; And besides, they had grips like iron.&nbsp; She was nothing to them.&nbsp; The gurney had arm extensions out to each side and the men pinned her arms there with Velcro straps first, before tightening one across her chest, her waist, her thighs and her shins.&nbsp; Her arms were secured palm upwards.&nbsp; She was a "T".&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"How many nons are you taking today, gentlemen?" asked Max, as he placed a metal briefcase on the top of the car and opened it.&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Four, Sir." answered one of them, "The other three are already loaded."&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Good.&nbsp; Let's get Ayla here ready for the trip."&nbsp; He took out a large syringe-like device.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What the fuck is that?!" exclaimed Ayla, unable to control her outburst.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Ayla, I will tell you, but you won't believe it."&nbsp; He walked over to her right arm and started feeling for the vein.&nbsp; She watched him, breathing rapidly.&nbsp; He plunged the needle into her arm; she hissed in pain.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was a slow injection.&nbsp; The vial was large and she watched as bright, nearly glowing, yellow liquid entered her bloodstream.&nbsp; "Ayla, darling, I just doubled your potential lifespan."&nbsp; She winced again as he withdrew the needle.&nbsp; "That was, in my mind, our most amazing development.&nbsp; That serum makes you completely immune to all harmful pathogens.&nbsp; You can't get sick, no cold, no flu, no tanakee spotted fever, not even cancer will touch you.&nbsp; You are also protected from parasites, bacteria and harmful fungal growths.&nbsp; Any potential heart disease, lung disorders, liver problems, all eradicated."&nbsp; He was removing another prepared syringe from the case.&nbsp; "This one," he said as he went to her left arm, "is the real fun one."&nbsp; He started the process there.&nbsp; "This concoction basically halts the ageing process for decades." He jabbed it in.&nbsp; "It stimulates the endocrine system, regulates heart rate and metabolism, maintains skin elasticity, and protects brain cells."&nbsp; Her face was one of utter shock and incomprehension.&nbsp; "Now your potential lifespan is tripled, at least.&nbsp; You will be young and beautiful for years and years�.baring any mishaps, of course.&nbsp; When old age does finally come on, and it will, you...all of us actually�. Will get old fast but painlessly, and die peacefully.&nbsp; Usually."&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She felt funny, all warm and woozy.&nbsp;&nbsp; The things he was telling her couldn't be possible, but the drugs were doing something to her, she could feel it.&nbsp; She almost groaned as he pulled yet another syringe-like thingy from the case.&nbsp; This one had a much longer needle.&nbsp; "Better hold her for this one."&nbsp; One of the men interlocked his fingers under her chin and pulled her head back and down against the table.&nbsp; It immobilized and nearly silenced her at the same time.&nbsp;&nbsp; The other man pressed down on her stomach with his thumbs, griping around her waist with his hands, just below the strap there.&nbsp; Max lowered the needle to a point a couple of inches below her belly button.&nbsp; Her screams were just humming grunts.&nbsp; Her hands clenched and her legs twisted back and forth but that was about all she could move.&nbsp; The needle entered her flesh.&nbsp; It went deep.&nbsp; It hurt a lot.&nbsp; When he finally removed it, the two men released their hold on her.&nbsp; She sobbed, the pain now just a dull ache in her belly.&nbsp; "I am sorry dear; you probably won't thank me for that one.&nbsp;&nbsp; That was the ultimate in birth control.&nbsp;&nbsp; It doesn't eliminate, but rather completely alters you menstrual process.&nbsp; You won't even know when your cycle is.&nbsp; There will be no bleeding, no cramps, no mood swings.&nbsp; You can't get pregnant."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Comprehension dawned on her.&nbsp; "Noooooo!&nbsp; Please!&nbsp; Don't do this to me!"&nbsp; Ayla was a young woman, but she always knew that someday she would settle down, have a family�she always wanted kids�.!&nbsp; This was unthinkable!&nbsp; The finality of her current predicament, the impending transition to non-citizen sex slave, was momentarily forgotten.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Shush, shush.&nbsp; Ayla, it can be reversed."&nbsp; She heard him and sniffed.&nbsp; "Sure, you may have offspring someday."&nbsp; She calmed slightly, but the word "offspring" sounded a bit odd�.&nbsp; "Sure, it's very possible that someday, a Citizen will decide that you would make a good breeder and�."&nbsp; Ayla wailed, remembering the current predicament.&nbsp; Max spoke a bit louder, "and give you the fertility serum and boom, you'll be as fertile as a rabbit!"&nbsp;&nbsp; This did not seem to comfort her.&nbsp; However, eventually, she forced herself to stop crying
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One of the men in black fatigues was laying something on the ground next to her; she couldn't see what it was.&nbsp; The other went to the end of the table and pulled her boots off, and then her socks.&nbsp; They undid her straps and sat her up.&nbsp; As soon as she was up, one of them pulled an elastic sleeve over her head and down; it ended up covering her from just below her shoulders to her waist.&nbsp; It pinned her arms to her sides again.&nbsp; They pulled another sleeve up her legs; it seemed rather loose for a moment but as they picked her up off the table and to her feet, both it, and the upper body one, constricted considerably.&nbsp; She would barely have been able to stand on her own, had the two men not been holding her upright.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Those bindings are thermal sensitive, Ayla.&nbsp; Your body heat makes them get tighter." said Max.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They laid her down on what looked like the garment bag from hell.&nbsp; She was zipped into a black body cocoon made of some leather-like material.&nbsp; She tried to squirm but it was so tight�and stiff; body hugging bars ran down her back and sides, keeping her totally rigid.&nbsp; After zipping, multiple straps were tightened around her and buckled.&nbsp; The damn thing had easy carry handles built into the sides.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla had never felt so utterly helpless.&nbsp; Her head was still uncovered, but one of the men stood by with some sort of helmet that was obviously meant alter that condition.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Max knelt on the ground next to her.&nbsp; He had one more syringe in his hand.&nbsp; He gently brushed a strain her hair out of her face.&nbsp; "Well dear, this is it.&nbsp; We shall most likely not meet again.&nbsp; I do apologize that your first "real" bondage experience was such a�.utilitarian�.one."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Wh�wh. .what does that shot do..?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"This injection, sweet slave," he pressed her head over exposing the side of her neck.&nbsp; She didn't resist.&nbsp; "This one just puts you to sleep."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
End of part one.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

Future Shocked, Chapter 2

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The sky was blue.&nbsp; That was the first thing she noticed.&nbsp; Some of those light, wispy looking clouds where up there too.&nbsp; She used to know what those were called.&nbsp; It had been on a test in school.&nbsp; She smiled dreamily, "What a beautiful day."&nbsp; 
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla remembered what had just happened to her and sat up with a start.&nbsp; She looked around in a panic.&nbsp; She was alone, sitting on the ground in a clearing surrounded by spectacular scenery.&nbsp; She calmed herself.&nbsp; She was sitting on soft, mossy grass.&nbsp; There were birds flying overhead.&nbsp; The trees had a distinctly tropical nature.&nbsp; It felt like being in that crazy T.V. show, the one with the plane crash survivors on that island.&nbsp;&nbsp; That ��.island.&nbsp; She shook her head, thinking to herself, "There's no fucking way that this is THAT island, not the one that her abductor told her about�..not�Tarcrete.&nbsp; This is not possible."&nbsp; But it was.&nbsp; She knew it.&nbsp; She had received just a taste of what could be done to her.&nbsp; She remembered her experiences with Max Romulus and shuttered.&nbsp; Her face took on an incredulous expression.&nbsp; She was confused.&nbsp; "What, they kidnap you, hurt you, drug you and then drop you off in some sort of sex slave nature preserve?&nbsp; Shit."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She stood up, there were no apparent side affects to the anesthetic.&nbsp; She was thirsty, but that was about it.&nbsp; Looking down at herself, she was actually surprised to see that she was still dressed, jeans, tee shirt, panties and bra all still there.&nbsp; Other than being barefoot, she had on the same clothes as when she was taken.&nbsp; She checked her pockets.&nbsp; "Son of a bitch kept my knife."&nbsp; She sighed, a bit exasperated.&nbsp; "And took my lighter too, the bastard."&nbsp; Her mind went into survival mode.&nbsp; "Water first," she said to herself, "then shelter, and then a big frickin stick."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was on a rise, much of the visible land was rolling hills.&nbsp; She followed the clearing down, hoping to find a stream.&nbsp; There wasn't one in the clearing but the forest wasn't particularly dense and so she continued on through the trees.&nbsp; It wasn't hard going.&nbsp; Ayla was an outdoorsy girl; she couldn't help but appreciate the beauty of this place.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While walking along through the forest, Ayla heard voices and froze.&nbsp; Not far away, and up to her right, she heard people talking.&nbsp; They sounded�happy.&nbsp; She crept up as quietly as she could.&nbsp; There were two men and a woman standing there chatting, they were all wearing camo fatigues; they were all armed with what looked like fancy paintball guns.&nbsp;&nbsp; There was another woman as well, but she wasn't standing.&nbsp; On the ground between them was a bound girl, hogtied with her wrists and ankles tied together in the front.&nbsp; She was on her side looking up at them with desperate eyes.&nbsp; She was wearing the tattered remains of a party dress.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Congratulations again, Servos." said one of the men to the other, "you've made the first capture of the day!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The standing woman was looking at a small handheld device with a considering eye.&nbsp; "Yes Servos, my dear husband and I are ever so jealous."&nbsp; She smiled. "But fear not, we are about to catch up.&nbsp; My sensor indicates another non�..right over�..there!"&nbsp; She looked right at Ayla.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Fuck."&nbsp; Ayla turned to flee, she heard a "Pffft" and a "thunk" and saw a needle pointed syringe dart hit a tree right next to her.&nbsp; She ran like a rabbit.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh bother," said the woman, "I missed."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Shall we pursue?" asked her husband, grinning.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes, let's." She answered smiling, "Have fun Servos!"&nbsp; Servos chuckled, menacingly at his captive as the two jogged off. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla lost her sense of direction but didn't really care at the moment.&nbsp; Running as fast as she could, weaving through the trees, she finally found her stream.&nbsp; She stopped very quickly to drink, lying on her belly to do so, and then leaping up to continue her escape.&nbsp; She paused for one more second and then picked up two egg sized rocks from the stream bed.&nbsp; She ran more, she was in good shape but she was beginning to tire.&nbsp; She slowed, breathing heavily, and chanced a look behind.&nbsp; There was no sign of her pursuers.&nbsp; It seemed she had made a clean getaway.&nbsp; She didn't have a good view of the sun to maintain direction, and she didn't really know what time it was anyway, surely still morning.&nbsp; Staying on course was tricky; she certainly didn't want to wander around in circles.&nbsp; She moved quickly and as smoothly as possible through the woods.&nbsp; Eventually, some time later, she came to a different clearing; this one filled with waist high plants, mostly ferns.&nbsp; She ducked down to hide, moving along a quickly as she could, bent over.&nbsp;&nbsp; She was very surprised to come across another girl.&nbsp; The girl was sitting on the ground, surrounded by ferns.&nbsp;&nbsp; She had her knees drawn up and was hugging them and she cried softly.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She looked up at Ayla in resignation.&nbsp; "I give up.&nbsp; You got me.&nbsp; I can't run anymore."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I'm not one of them, I'm one of you!" hissed Ayla.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"We'll never get away." said the girl, miserably.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Shut up!&nbsp; This is a big, frickin island and I'm Sheena the jungle girl.&nbsp; They'll have to work their asses off to get me!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh Sheena, you'll never make it�there's too many of them�they have guns, I've been running all morning!"&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla made exasperated strangling motions with her hands. "My name's not REALLY Sheena!&nbsp; It's Ayla, I just meant that I plan to survive and you can too!"&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They heard more voices, close ones; they heard a male voice say, "This way! There's two now!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Time to go!"&nbsp; Ayla dropped one of her rocks and grabbed the other girl by the wrist and dragged her to her feet.&nbsp; "Come on! Run!"&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She did, they both did.&nbsp; They saw a line of pursuers cutting across the fern field.&nbsp; Holding hands, they dashed to the forest.&nbsp; Entering the tree line, Ayla heard the other girl cry out in pain and their hands were ripped apart.&nbsp; Looking down, Ayla saw her face down on the ground, her right leg out straight behind.&nbsp; She had stepped in a snare; a wire cable was tight around her ankle.&nbsp; Ayla dropped down to release her.&nbsp; The loop was tight, cutting into her skin.&nbsp; She pulled at it franticly.&nbsp; It had some sort of one-way locking mechanism, there was no way to loosen it.&nbsp; Ayla pulled at the cable that attached the poor girl to a thick metal stake in the ground.&nbsp; The cable cut into Ayla's hands, it was immobile.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The trapped girl had propped herself up.&nbsp; She put a hand on Ayla's arm, "Stop.&nbsp; It's alright.&nbsp; Thank you. You run, go."&nbsp; She seemed strangely calm now.&nbsp; Ayla stared at her.&nbsp; They both knew there was nothing she could do.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla nodded once, "I'm so sorry."&nbsp; She ran into the trees.&nbsp; She never even knew the girl's name.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She managed to avoid anyone for some time, hours she thought. Maybe they had given up but she doubted it.&nbsp; She ran sometimes, sometimes she slinked.&nbsp; She was being very careful�at least she thought she was.&nbsp; She walked between two trees and heard a click�.and then a "whoosh".&nbsp; She was enveloped from both sides in a cloud of red gas.&nbsp; It was like getting hit with fire extinguishers.&nbsp; She stumbled forward holding her breath, thinking it was meant to knock her out.&nbsp; But after a moment of coughing, she didn't feel any ill affects.&nbsp; She did, however, feel a breeze on her body where there hadn't been one before.&nbsp;&nbsp; She looked down.&nbsp; Holes were forming in her clothes.&nbsp; It was like they were melting before her eyes.&nbsp; She tried to hold on to them, clutching at different spots on her body but the material just crumbled to powder in her hands.&nbsp; She heard something hit the ground at her feet; it was her zipper.&nbsp; Everything else was gone, she was completely nude.&nbsp; Her hair fell about her face, even her elastic hair tie had turned to dust.&nbsp; "Son of a bitch!&nbsp; I HATE this place!!!"&nbsp; The gas had dissipated, but Ayla noticed a red blinking light on the trunk of the tree�.somebody must know this had gone off�She bolted.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla was in a forest again, running.&nbsp; She dodged trees and vines; she leapt over fallen logs, she jumped over a stream and ran right into�.another hunter.&nbsp; She almost fell over backward in her attempt to stop, the hunter, a man, smiled and advanced.&nbsp; He didn't have one of those dart guns; he had a police baton looking thing with electrodes on the end.&nbsp; Ayla scrambled, she got her feet under her and remembered that she did have one thing left after all, she still had her rock.&nbsp; She raised her arm in a threatening manner and yelled, "Stay away from me!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The man looked at her like she was crazy, he was smiling.&nbsp; "You're going to stop me�.with a rock�"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla threw.&nbsp;&nbsp; She didn't play four years of softball for nothing.&nbsp; The rock hit him right in the face.&nbsp; He staggered back.&nbsp; He shook his head and touched his own cheek with his gloved hand and looked at the blood.&nbsp; "You little bitch.&nbsp; You will pay for that."&nbsp; He looked up, but she was already gone.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She ran like a deer.&nbsp; She was going, "Yes! Yes! Yes!" as she went.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her victory celebration was short lived though; she soon heard him crashing along behind her.&nbsp; She scanned the ground as she ran and found what she was looking for, the big frickin stick.&nbsp; She scooped it up, it was about the size of a small baseball bat, it was crooked but it would do.&nbsp; She ducked behind a tree and waited, her heart pounding.&nbsp;&nbsp; She heard him coming; she tightened her grip on the stick.&nbsp; He was still running, she spun around the tree just as he got there and hit him with everything she had, again, right in the face.&nbsp; She was only 5' 6" tall and weighed 124 pounds, but she had a lot of momentum�and determination.&nbsp; The effect was amazing.&nbsp; It was like his feet flew straight out in front of him, he was horizontal before he started to fall.&nbsp; It was a home run.&nbsp; He lay sprawled on the ground, his face a bloody pulp.&nbsp; He wasn't even moaning, Ayla thought she might have killed him, but when she checked, he was breathing.&nbsp; She picked up his baton and laid it within reach.&nbsp; She searched him.&nbsp; He had lots of things that she didn&#8217;t recognize, little electronic doodads and such.&nbsp; He had a tiny earpiece, but it was...um�broken.&nbsp; Then she found something good, she found his gun.&nbsp; It was smaller, a handgun.&nbsp; It looked like a real gun, not a dart gun.&nbsp; It was different from a regular automatic pistol; this one had some buttons and gizmos on it, but it was definitely a gun.&nbsp; She was about to strip him of his clothes, to see if she could make something she could wear out of them, when she heard clapping.&nbsp; She scrambled to her feet and aimed the gun around wildly.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The couple was there, the same couple from this morning.&nbsp; The woman was clapping politely.&nbsp; "You, my dear, are one fierce little non." She said.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The man, her husband presumably, was smiling as well.&nbsp; He had his dart gun cradled in his arms, non-threateningly. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The woman continued, "We've never seen Alphonse bested," she chuckled, "He won't be happy about this."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well I'm pretty fucking not happy about this either!&nbsp; Now back off or I swear I'll shoot."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The woman continued to smile, "Oh I'm sure you would," she said, emphasizing the word "would", "But do you really think we would ever allow a non to get their hands on a weapon that they could use?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla pointed the gun right at her.&nbsp; "I'm not kidding, I'll shoot you."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Please do."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla hesitated.&nbsp; These smug assholes!&nbsp; She SHOULD shoot them!&nbsp; But she couldn't shoot, not unless they made an aggressive move or something.&nbsp; They just stood there, smiling.&nbsp; She pointed the gun in the air and pulled the trigger quickly.&nbsp; Nothing happened.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"It's programmed, non.&nbsp; It will only work for Alphonse."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla pulled the trigger a few more times, just to make sure.&nbsp; This sucked.&nbsp; She glanced at the baton on the ground.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"The baton is also programmed, non.&nbsp; All of our weapons are."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla thought about throwing the useless gun at the woman, but since there were two of them she decided against it.&nbsp; She tossed the pistol on the ground.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Smart girl." said the man.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The woman continued, "We are most impressed with you, non.&nbsp; We give you one last chance at freedom."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla listened warily, standing on her toes, tense.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The man said, "We will give you a head start, ten minutes."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh sweetheart," said his wife, "Let us give her twenty.&nbsp; She's doing so well." 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Alright Dear, twenty.&nbsp; You are such a softy." answered the man.&nbsp; "Then we come after you, non.&nbsp; And we plan to take you home today."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla took a step back, she started to turn, to run, but she saw her stick on the ground.&nbsp; She looked right at them as she picked it up.&nbsp; She stood there, arrogantly.&nbsp; She tapped the club in her left palm a couple of times.&nbsp; She raised her chin at them.&nbsp; Then, this last act of bravado accomplished, she turned, her body crouching to take off.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Phifft."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla felt a sharp pain in her ass.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Phifft."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She felt another in the back of her thigh.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Already her legs were numb; she fell to her knees, dropping her stick from loose fingers.&nbsp; "You lying, cheating�."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The two hunters walked up to her.&nbsp; The man used his boot on her shoulder to push her over.&nbsp; The woman said, "Yes non. We did lie.&nbsp; But cheat?&nbsp; We didn't cheat, we make the rules."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla's world went black.&nbsp; 
 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Future Shocked, Chapter 3

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla was getting very, very tired of waking up in strange places.&nbsp; This one was bad.&nbsp; She found herself on a cold, hard floor in a cell.&nbsp; She guessed it was a cell, it was a box.&nbsp; It was less than three meters square, with no windows, no bed, no toilet.&nbsp; All the surfaces were smooth and hard and gray.&nbsp; The light was a defused, low level glow that came from the whole ceiling.&nbsp; There was a door, she thought it must be a door, low in the middle of one wall.&nbsp; It was a very small door.&nbsp; She moved over to sit, leaning in a corner, feeling rather sorry for herself.&nbsp;&nbsp; She was stiff and sore; could have been from the dash through the jungle or sleeping on this floor.&nbsp; Either way, it was no fun.&nbsp; And she was still naked.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The little door opened, sliding up.&nbsp; Ayla jumped to her feet, on guard.&nbsp; She heard the woman's voice from outside her cell, "We see you, non.&nbsp; We know you're awake.&nbsp; If you want to eat today, you will do as you are told.&nbsp; Do you understand?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla considered this.&nbsp; This was really the big question, wasn't it?&nbsp; Could she obey?&nbsp; Could she be submissive in real life, just like she pretended to be in Second life?&nbsp; Even if it was just an act on her part, she knew that they really did have power over her.&nbsp;&nbsp; On one hand, she loathed to submit to these people, she was a proud and stubborn girl.&nbsp; On the other, she knew they could shoot her with a dart, or spray her with stun gas, or sic robots on her or, or whatever!&nbsp; And she did want to eat.&nbsp; And she did want to live.&nbsp; The choice really wasn't much of a choice.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Alright, I'll be good.&nbsp; Can I come out now?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes you may, non�..on your hands and knees like a good little slave."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla tried very hard not to make some snide remark.&nbsp; She hoped, if they really could see her, that her attitude didn't show on her face.&nbsp; She sank to her knees.&nbsp; This was harder for her than she expected.&nbsp; She dropped to all fours and slowly crawled to the door.&nbsp; The door was just the size for such an exit.&nbsp; It's hard to see up when you're crawling.&nbsp; Your hair falls in your face and it's hard on your neck.&nbsp; And besides, she didn't really want to see their smug little faces looking down at her.&nbsp; She kept her head down.&nbsp; This is why she didn't see the two nooses as the couple slipped them around her neck.&nbsp; She felt them though.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Each of them had capture poles.&nbsp; They were more technically advanced then the average dog catchers tool, but they worked pretty much the same way, slip nooses on sticks.&nbsp; Ayla immediately started struggling as the nooses tightened.&nbsp; She couldn't get her fingers under the cables around her throat.&nbsp; One of her hands was grasping and clawing at her neck while the other gripped the end of the pole on one side.&nbsp; She had no leverage, she couldn't resist.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; They dragged her squirming, twisting body along the floor.&nbsp; Lifting her up, they worked together to back her in to a chair�.if you could call it a chair.&nbsp; It was a cross between a dentist's chair and a gynecologist's exam table.&nbsp; The man took both of the poles, one under each arm, and wedged them in spots made for just that purpose under the chair's headrest.&nbsp; Ayla's hands were clinched around the ends of each pole at each side of her neck.&nbsp; Her head was forced back.&nbsp; Her eyes were wild.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Now, non," said the woman, "place both of you hands, palm downwards, on the armrests."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla looked at her like she was mad, her nostrils flaring with each rapid breath.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Comply or be punished."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla's mind yelled in her head, "Be punished?!&nbsp; What the fuck is THIS?!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Comply."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla tried to think, tried to settle.&nbsp; She let go of the pole on the right side and shakily grabbed the armrest.&nbsp; The woman continued to watch her coolly.&nbsp; Ayla slammed her other hand down as well.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Good non."&nbsp; Ayla didn't see her press any buttons but straps flipped up and tightened around her forearms anyway.&nbsp; They were wide; they covered her arm elbow to near her wrist.&nbsp; The man behind her did click something on the capture poles and the loops unlocked from her throat.&nbsp; While Ayla took a relieved breath, the woman secured her legs to the stirrups with more wide straps.&nbsp; Another was fastened around her upper body, from armpit to armpit.&nbsp; And finally, a last strap was locked across her lap.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla flexed and wiggled in the seat, testing the restraints.&nbsp; Suddenly, she stopped moving, an expression of surprise on her face.&nbsp; She quickly dropped her head, casting her eyes downward�but it wasn't in defeat.&nbsp; She got very still, she was mortified.&nbsp; She could not believe this�.she was excited.&nbsp; After all of this hellish treatment, this fear and anger�she had a rush of�something�. It was almost like the arousal she felt while being played with in Second life�.but�oh shit� this was not good.&nbsp; She could not look at them; she would die if they knew.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh look honey," said the man.&nbsp; There was all manner of scientific looking gear in the room and he was looking at one of the flickering screens. "Her arousal levels are high." 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla died.&nbsp; Alright, she didn't die.&nbsp; But she was embarrassed beyond words.&nbsp; She didn't try to deny it; they would just laugh at her.&nbsp; She just closed her eyes, concentrated on her breathing and pretending that she didn't hear a thing.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Of course they are, sweetheart.&nbsp; Didn't you read Max's report?&nbsp; He hasn't been wrong about one of these sluts yet."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Of course." The man answered, nodding.&nbsp; "It's just always nice to see.&nbsp; Well, I'll leave you to play with your new pet, Claudia.&nbsp; Call if you need me."&nbsp; He kissed her on the cheek and left the two women alone.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Claudia, now that Ayla had heard her name, set to adjusting various machines around the chair.&nbsp; Some of them were on large, pivoting arms like dental radiograph equipment.&nbsp; Some of them looked like cameras.&nbsp; Ayla tried to watch her surreptitiously until curiosity got the better of her.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What are you going to do to me now?" asked the chair bound girl.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You are my new test subject, non.&nbsp; Now be silent." replied Claudia.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla glowered but remained quiet.&nbsp; Looking around, she saw her own image from various angles on screens.&nbsp; Some of them were "normal", some thermal, and at least one that made her look like a computer generated graphic.&nbsp; Damn, she really DID look like her avatar.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Claudia came over to her and attached flat, hand shaped objects to the end of each armrest.&nbsp; "Spread you fingers on these, non."&nbsp; Ayla did so.&nbsp; Then Claudia laced each one of Ayla's fingers to the objects, one side then the other.&nbsp; Ayla's hands were totally fixed in place, fingers splayed.&nbsp; After securing her subject's hands, Claudia retrieved a device from a nearby table, another needle device�.a really big needle device.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What are you going to do with that?!" cried Ayla as she struggled unsuccessfully to pull her hands away.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Claudia gave her an annoyed look.&nbsp; Without a word, she placed the needle device back on the table and turned to the consol, typing quickly.&nbsp; There was the sound of machinery, some clicks and whirls, and then a beep.&nbsp; She opened a hatch with a hiss of steam and pulled out an object; it looked like the lower half of a mask with no features.&nbsp; It was very like the shape of Ayla's face, below her nose and under her chin, but the side edges went straight back.&nbsp; It was black.&nbsp; Without fuss, she shoved it over the girl's mouth.&nbsp; Ayla had time for a "What the fu�.." before it snuggly shut her off.&nbsp; The straight parts of the mask clicked into slots in the headrest.&nbsp; Claudia turned a knob near the slots, tightening it further.&nbsp; It was a perfect fit; it had been custom made.&nbsp; Ayla's head was immobilized, her jaw was clamped shut.&nbsp; Her whines of protest were muffled very effectively.&nbsp; Her arousal levels were high again.&nbsp; "I told you to be silent."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She picked up the apparatus and aimed it at Ayla's wrist, on the upper side, right over the metacarpals.&nbsp; Ayla squealed.&nbsp; Claudia gave her a look that almost resembled compassion, but not quite.&nbsp; "You are an inquisitive slave, non; so I will tell you what I'm doing."&nbsp; She drove the needle into Ayla's arm.&nbsp; Ayla screamed in pain, but made little noise.&nbsp; "I am implanting my latest invention in you.&nbsp; This is one of several transponders that will act as a beacon for other components."&nbsp; She withdrew the needle and moved to the other side.&nbsp; "It has to go it deep, between the bones of you wrist.&nbsp; It will eventually fuse there."&nbsp; Ayla's torso heaved and twisted as she struggled in pain, but her arms and hands remained motionless.&nbsp; She most certainly was not aroused now.&nbsp; Claudia finished the second injection.&nbsp; Then she used the chairs electronic controls to tilt Ayla back, raising her legs.&nbsp; Try as she did, Ayla could not keep her from strapping her feet to the corresponding foot shaped stirrups.&nbsp; The straps held her feet with her toes pointed down severely.&nbsp; "I surmise that the ankle implants will be even more painful than the wrists."&nbsp; She surmised correctly.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla did not pass out from the pain, but many would have.&nbsp; She hoped the worst was over.&nbsp; "Two more." said Claudia.&nbsp; Ayla nearly passed out just from those words, she didn't.&nbsp; She did sob however. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Claudia rotated Ayla forward, the whole chair turning as one system, until the trapped girl was face down.&nbsp; Padded bars folded into place across her belly, holding her even more securely.&nbsp; Claudia targeted an open space that exposed part of Ayla's back.&nbsp; "This one goes into a lumbar vertebra."&nbsp; Again, Ayla screamed quietly.&nbsp; "And lastly�.."&nbsp; Claudia rotated the chair back up until her victim was only leaning forward slightly.&nbsp; "I place one in cervical vertebra."&nbsp; Ayla felt the needle enter her in the back of the neck. The pain was excruciating.&nbsp; That's when she passed out.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When her eyes flickered open, she was still bound in the chair, back in the original reclined position.&nbsp; The mask-like gag was still in place, holding her head back tightly against headrest.&nbsp; Claudia was working at a computer, making calibrations.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Claudia touched her own ear, and spoke, "Julian darling, please come and help me take this non to the testing chamber."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla did not hear his answer but he arrived moments later.&nbsp; Julian, her husband, was a big fellow with an athletic build.&nbsp; He was also armed, a holstered dart pistol at his hip.&nbsp; He took hold of her upper arm as Claudia removed the face mask.&nbsp; With a press of a button, all of the straps unlocked and folded out of the way.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Julian looked Ayla right in the eye and said, "Please feel free to fight me, non.&nbsp; I will really enjoy punishing you for it."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla did not resist.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They walked her out of the lab, down a hall and into a large featureless chamber.&nbsp; Claudia was carrying a large metal case.&nbsp; Julian placed Ayla in the middle of the room, some six meters from where Claudia stood.&nbsp; Ayla had her back to her.&nbsp; "Stay." Was all he said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla heard some clicking and such behind her but did not dare to turn around.&nbsp; She heard Claudia's voice.&nbsp; "Alright non, we'll make the first test an easy one.&nbsp; Stand up straight, spread your feet apart��wider, and hold your arms out straight to the sides�good."&nbsp; Ayla stood there like a good target.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was another click and a whirl.&nbsp; Ayla felt a striking pain in her right ankle, and then immediately after in her left.&nbsp; It nearly knocked her feet out from under her.&nbsp; "Oww!" she cried out.&nbsp; She stumbled a bit looking down.&nbsp; Her ankles were encircled by three or four inch wide, black plastic-looking cuffs.&nbsp; Ayla spun around to look at the two tormentors.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Claudia was holding and hand-held launcher device that had just shot the cuffs.&nbsp; "Bull's eye." She said.&nbsp; "Try the controls, dear."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Julian was holding a small palm pilot looking thing and tapped it.&nbsp; Ayla felt a buzz in the right cuff and looked down again to see a small cylinder shoot out pulling a thin cable behind.&nbsp; It hit the other cuff with a pop and fixed there by some magnetic like power.&nbsp; She was now hobbled.&nbsp; She could only take short steps.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla couldn't believe that small cable was strong enough to hold her and she kicked and pulled at it. There was not a bit of give.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Carbon nanotube fiber for the cable, non." Said Claudia, "And a nearly indestructible polymer coated cuff with a titanium core.&nbsp; That would hold an elephant.&nbsp; That would hold ten elephants.&nbsp; It should hold you."&nbsp; Ayla gave one more halfhearted tug.
Julian tapped the controller again and the cable between her legs shortened.&nbsp; It shortened very fast, and Ayla's legs snapped together.&nbsp; She teetered, her arms wind milling to keep her balance.&nbsp; Before she fell over, Julian detached the lock between the cuffs and she took a stumbling step forward.&nbsp; Claudia continued, "Now turn around again; I'm going to try the wrist cuffs." 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla's first response was to hug her arms tight against her body and turn away, but Claudia just snorted. "I wouldn't do that were I you, non.&nbsp; I'm not sure what these cuffs would do�they may just go through your body to get to your wrists."&nbsp; Ayla turned pale. "Now hold your arms out."&nbsp; Ayla slowly and tentatively complied.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The cuff hit her left wrist hard, the arm flew forward.&nbsp; Her right hand was flung back as this happened�.only to meet that cuff with even more force.&nbsp; It was too hard.&nbsp; Ayla crumpled to her knees in pain, cradling her right wrist and rocking.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Whoops." said Claudia. "I will need to recalibrate the velocity on those."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The two came over to the downed girl and helped her up to examine her wrist.&nbsp; They were not quite tender about it, but they did seem to be careful with her.&nbsp; Claudia ran a scanner device over Ayla's arm.&nbsp; "Not broken, should be alright in a day or two."&nbsp; She continued to speak to Julian as if Ayla wasn't there as they led her back into the lab.&nbsp; "I'll make the necessary calculations on the launcher; the collar would have broken her neck."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The lab was larger than Ayla had realized.&nbsp; With a click, they removed her cuffs and Julian put a sling over her neck to hold her sprained wrist up.&nbsp; Then they took her to another cell.&nbsp; This one was larger than the one in which she had awoken.&nbsp; And the wall facing the lab was glass.&nbsp; The door was unlocked with a touch panel and she was simply pushed in.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla looked around her new accommodations.&nbsp; It reminded her of one of those old style primate house zoo enclosures.&nbsp; The walls here bare and beige, the floor had a drain in it.&nbsp; There was a hole in the floor, in the corner, which could have been the bathroom facilities.&nbsp;&nbsp; A "bed", bench-like, extended from the back wall.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; There was one more odd feature about this cell; there were three holes in the wall.&nbsp; The holes were low, maybe knee height and spaced horizontally.&nbsp; The middle hole was larger, big enough to stick your head in, the outside holes�hand sized.&nbsp;&nbsp; "You have got to be frickin kidding me." said Ayla.&nbsp; She looked through the glass to get an explanation, Claudia and Julian were gone.&nbsp; Guess she had to figure this out, and part of her brain already knew, on her own.&nbsp; On closer inspection she realized what the holes were for�it was a water fountain.&nbsp; Inside the middle hole, the head sized one, there was a rubber coated and very phallic spigot.&nbsp; Each of the smaller holes had handles in them, with triggers.&nbsp; The only way to get a drink, she surmised, was to get on your knees, stick your head all the way into the middle hole and suck that dick.&nbsp;&nbsp; And she was thirsty, hungry too.&nbsp; "Assholes." she said out loud.&nbsp; She got down on her knees.&nbsp; She reached in and pulled the left trigger, nothing.&nbsp; She used her left hand to do the same on the right, nothing.&nbsp; She gingerly pulled her sprained wrist from the sling and pulled both triggers�still nothing.&nbsp; She sighed heavily.&nbsp; There must be three triggers. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Knowing perfectly well that she was putting herself in a very vulnerable position, she stuck her head into the middle hole.&nbsp; She half expected to feel something lock around her neck immediately, but again, nothing happened.&nbsp; She put her mouth around the�dispenser.&nbsp; She pulled both triggers and��nothing.&nbsp; "om off a itch."&nbsp; She said around the dildo.&nbsp; She took the thing deeper into her mouth, still pulling the triggers.&nbsp; Bingo.&nbsp; Ayla got her first drink of the day, she sucked greedily.&nbsp; It tasted wonderful.&nbsp; It was water with a sweet tang of vitamins and fruit.&nbsp; Finally, her thirst quenched, she pulled her hands and head out of the holes.&nbsp; She was almost surprised that she had been able to do so.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She stood, carefully placing her arm back in the sling.&nbsp; She paced for a bit.&nbsp; And then, bored and growing resentful, she sat on the bench.&nbsp; It looked hard but it was actually padded with that memory foam stuff.&nbsp; After swinging her legs for a few minutes, she lay on her side, still watching the lab for any sign of the return of her captors.&nbsp; Before she knew it, she was asleep.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Future Shocked, Chapter 4

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Take three steps forward, non." said Claudia.&nbsp; They were back in the testing chamber.&nbsp; Ayla was a target again.&nbsp; "I don't know why I didn't think hair was going to be a problem." Claudia said to her husband.&nbsp; "I just did not even consider it in my simulations."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla had been "shot" with the shackle gun several times now.&nbsp; It still hurt, but it was no longer debilitating.&nbsp; When she was hit with the belt, the one that homed in on the lower spine implant, it nearly knocked the wind out of her the first time; it had been turned down a bit subsequently.&nbsp; Her right wrist was still sore when she had been woken up, but not as tender as she had expected, so that one wasn't too bad.&nbsp; The collar was still an issue.&nbsp; It shot, it few, it hit its target.&nbsp; But it almost always got tangled in her hair, or cracked her jaw or at the least scraped her skin.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Maybe a simpler approach, my dear." said Julian.&nbsp; He unlocked and retrieved the collar from Ayla's bruised neck.&nbsp; He took a couple of steps back.&nbsp; "Face me, non."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla turned towards him and as soon as she did, he tossed the open collar at her.&nbsp; She jerked her head back instinctively but as the collar was like a guided missile, the implants drew the restraints like cartoon magnets.&nbsp; It sped right at her throat and clicked on.&nbsp; Julian smiled broadly, "I believe that would be called a 'ringer'."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His wife gave him a sardonic smile as she shook her head.&nbsp; "Well," she said, "that will do for the time being.&nbsp; Now let us see how the controls work in synchronicity."&nbsp; Ayla was cuffed with all of the components, collar, waist, wrists and ankles.&nbsp; It was almost as though they were part of her, she tried to twist the wrist cuffs but they wouldn't turn.&nbsp; They weren&#8217;t super tight� they didn't feel "glued" on�.but if she tried to shift them, they just moved ever so slightly and then reoriented themselves.&nbsp; The transponders imbedded into her body kept the cuffs exactly in place.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Claudia considered the remote controller and started manipulating the device.&nbsp; Ayla's wrist cuffs flew together, her palms facing.&nbsp; The cuffs were flat against each other.&nbsp; That brought her elbows in close in front of her body, pushing her breasts together.&nbsp; Ayla started breathing quicker.&nbsp; She had almost become rather unmoved by the whole testing process so far.&nbsp; She did what they told her to do, they shot her with cuffs, no big deal really.&nbsp; But this one change made everything different�she could not forget how truly helpless she was.&nbsp; She looked up with trepidation.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I like that one." said Julian, leering in an exaggerated way.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I'm sure you do dear." answered his wife. "Notice how the remote gives us very accurate control, watch."&nbsp; Ayla felt her wrists twisting and rotating.&nbsp; Her right arm was forced up and around, the cuffs sliding along each other until they were perpendicular.&nbsp; Now her wrists were crossed.&nbsp; Then the lower wrist, her left, started rotating until both of her palms faced downwards.&nbsp; It was more comfortable, but it was very spooky watching her arms move like that.&nbsp; "And of course, the belt has magnetic receivers all around to attach the cuffs at any point.&nbsp; We can even have her hands in front or in back 'on the fly' because the belt will pull them to the desired position as the cuffs are brought together."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You are a genius, my love." said Julian to his wife.  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes dear, I know."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla just looked at both of them as though they were crazy.&nbsp; Unfortunately, Claudia noticed.&nbsp; "Here, non," she said, "let me show you how strong the connections are."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla felt the ankle cuff cable shoot from one cuff to the other, giving her little room to step.&nbsp; Her wrist cuffs slammed to her belt, one on each side.&nbsp; Her elbows were bent, her palms faced her body.&nbsp; Then the wrist cuffs slowly started to turn, the right clockwise, the left counterclockwise.&nbsp; Her palms faced forward, painfully.&nbsp; The cuffs continued to turn.&nbsp; Ayla's back arched, her mouth opened wide in a silent, surprised scream.&nbsp; The cuffs stopped, holding her in this agonizing position.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"A little more, non," said Claudia coldly, "will break both arms, just something for you to keep in mind."&nbsp; She stepped closer to the distraught girl.&nbsp; They were of a height, Claudia only a little taller now, due to Ayla's backwards bent position.&nbsp; After a moment she said, "Do you want me to release your arms, non?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla nodded quickly. "YES! Yes, please!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Claudia stepped very close, "Non, I know that you know the proper way to address your betters."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla's mind was a jumble of pain and confusion.&nbsp; But she knew what the woman wanted, what the woman that controlled her wanted.&nbsp; Ayla had spent months being taught how to address such a woman� it was just pretend before, just a game, a lark.&nbsp; It was fun, a turn on, to be a submissive girl before her�Mistress.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla tried to catch her breath, her arms shaking in pain.&nbsp; "Yes�.please�..mistress."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her cuffs detached from the belt and Ayla gasped in relief.&nbsp; And then Ayla said something she did not expect herself to say, indeed it was almost as if she was hearing someone else say it.&nbsp; She said, "Thank you, Mistress."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Claudia smiled, "Good girl."&nbsp; Then she turned back to her husband and said, "Let's record some of the cuffs manipulations and subject reactions for the database, dear."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla was unceremoniously put through her paces.&nbsp; Not only the ankle cuffs had attaching cables.&nbsp; The wrist cuffs did as well, and they also attached to each other.&nbsp; Ayla begin to think of them as tiny magnetic grappling hooks.&nbsp; Hands in back, hands in front, wrists to the belt, wrists loose from the belt. Crossed in back, parallel in back (that one was rough).&nbsp; More cables shot out, right wrist to right ankle, pop, left wrist to left ankle, click.&nbsp; The cables were slowly reeling in until Ayla was crouching, bent way over.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Hmmm." Claudia pondered. "I was hoping that would force a kneeling position."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I think if we vary the speed darling, and slightly alter the attachments," answered Julian, "we will get different results."&nbsp; He played with his controller remote.&nbsp; Ayla was released for a moment, just enough time to stand, and then her wrists were clamped together in the back.&nbsp; The ankle cuffs clicked together with a short hobble.&nbsp; Then, the ankles attached to the wrists again, and the cables started to shorten.&nbsp; Ayla tired to fight it, she really did.&nbsp; Not to escape, she knew that wasn't in the offing, she just didn't want this to be easy for them.&nbsp; Mostly, she just wanted to spite them by remaining on her feet, even if she was crouching.&nbsp; Her brief feelings of submissiveness were forgotten, well perhaps not forgotten, but rather regretted.&nbsp; She almost made it.&nbsp; She had to bend her knees, she had to go down, but just as she was almost all the way to a squatting position, Julian increased the speed and threw her off balance.&nbsp; She almost fell over backwards but overcompensating, she landed on her knees, kneeling.&nbsp; And frustrated.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh, well done darling!" said Claudia, smiling.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Thank you my sweet." Replied her husband, "And, of course, that same manipulation at a higher speed�"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Hogtied." finished Claudia.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Exactly," he replied, "And what fun it would be if she were running�..then we would have a 'flying through the air, landing with a thud and skidding across the ground,' hogtied."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"We'll need to try that, won't we?" Claudia smiled.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla, still kneeling with her hands and ankles cuffed behind, weakly pulled at her restraints.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Claudia appraised the girl, "Non, when was the last time you ate?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla looked up at her, "What day is it?&nbsp; I haven't had any actual food since�.Monday morning."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Three days.&nbsp; You could go much longer.&nbsp; You could �..live�..for a very long time on the nutrient fluid alone.&nbsp; But it would not be pleasant."&nbsp;&nbsp; Claudia pulled a coiled leather leash from a belt pouch.&nbsp; Ayla, living around horses as she had, knew all about lead ropes.&nbsp; The clip on this leash caught her eye.&nbsp; It was rather like a small, slim padlock connected directly to the end of the leash.&nbsp; Claudia noticed the girl's look.&nbsp; "Never been on a leash before, non?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No, not in real life anyway, but I was confused by the clip�" Ayla blushed, of all the things to think about while being held prisoner by sadistic techno geniuses, she was wondering about the clip on the end of a leash about to be attached to HER collar.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Ah yes," answered Claudia, holding it up before Ayla's face, "you could not open this even were you to have access to it.&nbsp; This smooth part here, this is a biometric scanner for our thumbprints.&nbsp; Only we can open it."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Figured." said Ayla, resigned, and then muttering, "At least it doesn't appear automatically like the one's I've worn before."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What?!" said the startled Claudia. "When have you worn such devices?!&nbsp; I thought we were the first to take you!"
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla looked at her with confusion, "Not in real life, in the game, you know, Second Life?&nbsp; Aren't you trying to make cuffs like the ones we wear in that game?&nbsp; These pretty much work the same way�."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Claudia narrowed her eyes, "You think that I got the idea for my invention from your foolish outworld game?"&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla stammered, "I'm sorry, but�..yes.&nbsp; There're several versions that you can get�.that work�.kinda like these."&nbsp; She winced in anticipation of an adverse reaction.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Claudia calmed herself and said in a low voice that promised clear understanding, "These transponder guided, highly technical, titanium alloy cuffs were not inspired by some asinine online game in your outworld village!&nbsp; Think, non!&nbsp; Do you really believe that we would waste out time pretending to do things in that game that we can actually do here?!&nbsp; If I want a slave, I go out and catch one!&nbsp; I don't have virtual slaves, I have you!"&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Julian coughed into his hand.&nbsp; Claudia gave him a look, "What?!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Sweetheart, Darling, do you remember last year at Roland's party?"&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Claudia answered slowly, "Yes��"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Remember how you made fun of Marcus for playing that Second Life game to get ideas?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes�."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Remember how you drank quite a bit of wine that night?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Make your point, husband."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I believe he may have, in fact, mentioned something about the cuffs of which this slave speaks." 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Claudia gave him a blank look, then looked at Ayla, and then back at her husband, "Ah, well.&nbsp; I see.&nbsp; Mine are still better." &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Of course they are dear.&nbsp; Let's feed our pet."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She looked towards the kneeling girl yet again.&nbsp; "Other than that, non, the only information I really have about your "game" is what I read in the acquisition reports filed by dear Max and the others.&nbsp; Now come."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Leashed, Ayla was allowed to stand, foot hobbled with her hands still cuffed behind her back.&nbsp; They led her to the lab, to an elevator.&nbsp; Julian turned her to face a back corner and, with his hand between her shoulder blades, kept her pressed into it.&nbsp; When the elevator stopped, she was led out into their main living quarters.&nbsp; It was�.lovely.&nbsp; Ayla was expecting something stark and futuristic, but it was open and airy.&nbsp; Large windows were open to the night.&nbsp; There were various artworks, painting, sculpture, and digital works about the room.&nbsp; The decor was both tropical and Mediterranean and really quite comfortable looking.&nbsp; Claudia took Ayla over to a large digital art frame on the wall.&nbsp; "Look here non.&nbsp; We took this the day of your capture, you may not remember it."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla looked at the picture and blanched.&nbsp; It was a picture of the two of her captors standing on either side of HER.&nbsp; They were both holding their dart guns and standing in a classic, clich�d "great safari hunter" poses.&nbsp; Ayla, unconscious, was hanging by her ankles from a tree branch between them.&nbsp; "Oh my God."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Indeed." was all Claudia replied.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jerking her away from the picture, Ayla had still been staring, Claudia dragged the girl over to a cabana chair and sat.&nbsp; "Kneel."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla, believing that she didn't have much choice, did so.&nbsp; Julian had gone to the kitchen area; it was only separated from the main room by a bar.&nbsp; He returned with a small tray which he placed on a table next to Claudia's chair.&nbsp; "Here you are, my Dear.&nbsp; You feed her tonight, and perhaps later I'll stuff her as well."&nbsp; He smiled wickedly.&nbsp; Ayla shivered at the words.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Non," said Claudia, "You've heard the phrase, "Do not bite the hand that feeds you"?&nbsp; Well, you should really consider that.&nbsp; If you bite me, broken arm bones will be the least of your worries."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I won't bite, I promise."&nbsp; Ayla was famished; the thought of food was making her mouth water.&nbsp; She had no intention of doing anything that would keep her from being fed, even it is was to be from the hand of this cruel, distant woman. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Claudia paused, she seemed to be waiting, one eyebrow arched.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla remembered her�training.&nbsp; "I promise I won't bite� Mistress."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Satisfied, Claudia picked up a piece of food from the tray.&nbsp; It was fruit, papaya, a small cube.&nbsp; She delicately placed it in Ayla's open and waiting mouth.&nbsp; It was wonderful.&nbsp; The flavor exploded on her tongue.&nbsp; The next was pineapple, and then mango.&nbsp; Ayla could not help herself, she made humming noises of pleasure.&nbsp; Some of the cubes were something processed, like firm tofu, with a nutty flavor and particularly nice texture.&nbsp; More fruit, some she didn't recognize, more protein cubes.&nbsp; It was so delicious.&nbsp; Ayla found herself leaning forward to accept each little piece, each one was a reward for being close to this woman, each bite was easier to accept than the last.&nbsp; Somewhere in the back of her mind, Ayla knew she was being trained.&nbsp; Hell, she WAS an animal trainer, she knew all about positive reinforcement.&nbsp; She didn't care.&nbsp; She was being fed.&nbsp; And it's tasted good!&nbsp; She scooted forward a bit closer.&nbsp; Eagerly chewing, swallowing and opening her mouth for the next bite.&nbsp; All too quickly, the tray was empty.&nbsp; It had not been a large meal, but it took the edge off Ayla's hunger. She sighed softly.&nbsp; "Thank you, Mistress."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After a moment, Claudia held her hand out to the girl kneeling and bound before her.&nbsp; "Clean my hand."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla's heart fluttered.&nbsp; She was momentarily taken aback.&nbsp; She looked into the woman's eyes and slowly, carefully, leaned in to lick her fingers.&nbsp; "Yes, Mistress."&nbsp; As it turned out, Ayla could, in fact, be submissive in real life.&nbsp; She licked each finger with delicate grace.&nbsp; She ran her tongue over the palm, the heel, even the inside of her wrist.&nbsp; She closed her mouth over the webbing between thumb and forefinger, gently sucking.&nbsp; She took Claudia's middle finger into her mouth and sucked on it a bit harder, her eyes closing.&nbsp; She was almost outside of herself, almost away from the fear and pain of the last few days, she was just a girl that wanted to please her Mistress, wanted something loving, something tender� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Claudia started breathing harder herself.&nbsp; She brought her free hand up to her own mouth.&nbsp; Julian's chuckles distracted both women.&nbsp; Claudia drew her hand back, "That is quite enough, Ayla.&nbsp; When I want sex, I will tell you."&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla blushed furiously.&nbsp; "Yes, Mistress."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"She is a natural." said Julian, smiling. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes," replied Claudia, fanning herself. "a true bondage slut."&nbsp; She picked up the leash and handed it to her husband.&nbsp; "I do hope she will still be suitable for our next experiment.&nbsp; She may be too easy."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well," said Julian, "I'm sure that with the right stimuli, we can still test your hypothesis, sweet wife."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well, we'll find out tomorrow.&nbsp; Please, husband, do be kind and put Ayla away for the night.&nbsp; I've had a long day."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Of course, dear.&nbsp; Come along, pet."&nbsp; He pulled her to her feet and led her back to the elevator.&nbsp; Inside, Ayla whispered, "She called me Ayla�"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"We know your name, non.&nbsp; Anyone with a Bio-scanner can sample your DNA and access your files."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla looked at him.&nbsp; That was, of course, not what she had meant.&nbsp; He smiled at her, "You have been fed by your Mistress's hand, you have not been entirely unpleasing today.&nbsp; A pet may have a name."&nbsp; She nodded, thinking. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"And as she is your Mistress�.I am your�..?" he looked at her expectantly.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla had never really played much with men on Second Life, something about being with men there was �.she wasn't sure, scarier?&nbsp; Being with her online Mistress and "bond-sisters" and certainly made her think in bi-sexual ways, she was downright enamored with women now, but she was still sexual attracted to men too.&nbsp; And she was cuffed and leashed and naked and very close to this large, powerful man.&nbsp; She whispered, "Master."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes, good girl. Perhaps you should kneel right now."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Why was the word "Master" somehow worse than the word "Mistress?"&nbsp; Surely, submitting to a woman was just has demeaning.&nbsp; A woman could be just as cruel as any man.&nbsp; Ayla realized what it was, for her anyway; it offended her feminist sensibilities.&nbsp; To bow before a man was letting other women down.&nbsp; But he could�.make�..her bow.&nbsp; There was no way she could stop him.&nbsp; Again, she had little choice.&nbsp; It also occurred to her, rather suddenly, that if women were equal to men, then the opposite must also be true.&nbsp; At least she was an equal opportunity slave.&nbsp; She slowly sank to her knees. "Yes�..Master."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Good girl, Ayla," he took her chin and tilted her head back, "very good girl."
She had not realized that the elevator was not moving until that moment.&nbsp; After a few moments of forcing her to endure his gaze, Julian touched the control panel and the compartment continued down.&nbsp; She had to scramble to get up as the doors opened.&nbsp; Without her hands, foot hobbled and with the man on the other end of the leash already moving, it wasn't easy.&nbsp; He took her back to the primate cage looking cell.&nbsp; He went in first and pulled her in behind.&nbsp; With his remote, he unfastened her cuffs, they stayed on, but she was unfettered.&nbsp; He held up his end of the leash, "I'm going to�" he smiled and said in a mockingly western tone, "�"hitch"�.your leash here to the wall by the bed for the night.&nbsp; Just so you don't forget your status as our pet.&nbsp; If you want a drink before morning, I suggest you get it now."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She looked at him and then at the holes in the wall, her "drinking fountain."&nbsp; She did not trust him.&nbsp; She was thirsty, but not THAT thirsty.&nbsp; "You're going to do something bad to me."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I will do many bad things to you, Ayla, some just because I enjoy it and some because you deserve to be punished.&nbsp; For instance, already you have forgotten the proper way to address me."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla groaned inwardly, "Forgive me, Master."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Julian gave her a look that bordered on a roll of the eyes, "It's late, I'm tired and my wife awaits my attention.&nbsp; Get your drink."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla nodded, it wasn't as if he couldn't do anything that he wanted to do to her anyway.&nbsp; Still feeling a bit nervous despite that knowledge, she knelt to access the drinking device.&nbsp; Activating the triggers, she sucked the fluid down her throat.&nbsp; As soon as she released the triggers, the stock-like closures around her neck and wrists tightened, trapping her.&nbsp; "Nuuuuuu!"&nbsp; The rubber phallus filled her mouth, her cries of protest were greatly diminished.&nbsp; The curved locking clamps around her were padded, but completely immobile.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Julian looked at the struggling girl, on her knees, her ass higher than her shoulders.&nbsp; Her head and hands gone, held locked in the wall.&nbsp; He listened to her muffled cries.&nbsp; He removed his pants, freeing his aroused member.&nbsp; He went to her and spanked her hard, four times.&nbsp; He could hear her squealing cries behind the wall and smiled.&nbsp; He spanked her three more times, harder.&nbsp; She tried to kick him, her leg flailing wildly.&nbsp; With a touch, he opened four small panels in the floor.&nbsp; He grabbed her swinging ankle and slammed her leg to the floor between two of the floor panels and pulled the underlying strap from one and clicked it into the other.&nbsp; Her leg was now strapped to the floor.&nbsp; As she fought to free herself from that one, he affixed her other leg to the floor with the other recessed strap.&nbsp; Her struggles were much restricted; her legs were fastened to the floor and widely spaced.&nbsp; She was still on her knees.&nbsp; His hands rubbing and patting her already red bottom elicited more gagged squeals.&nbsp; She was still able to wiggle and shift her hips back and forth, this excited him even more.&nbsp; He slapped her thighs, her ass, the curve of her sides.&nbsp; She made those wonderful, unintelligible noises frightened girls makes with a big rubber dick in her mouth, while being pinched and smacked.&nbsp; Grabbing her thighs and spreading her pussy lips wide with his thumbs, he thrust his cock into her with a groan of pleasure.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;This was it, Ayla was being raped.&nbsp; She had always known that this was her fate.&nbsp; Always known from the moment she felt the straps tighten around her body the day she was taken.&nbsp; Not admitting it, but knowing.&nbsp; Still, the shock of it stuck her a nearly mind-numbing blow.&nbsp; But it only lasted a moment before she started struggling wildly, bucking and screaming.&nbsp; He punished her.&nbsp; As he pounded into her, he started hitting her again, slapping her, raining hard, stinging blows on her body.&nbsp; He reached around and under, to where her large breasts hung swaying, and slapped the side of her right tit�over and over.&nbsp; He fucked her and hit her until he felt her slump, sobbing and exhausted.&nbsp; She felt him leave her, withdrawing.&nbsp; The leg straps were removed, the stock-like restraints opened.&nbsp; He pulled her out and dropped her to curl up on the floor, moaning.&nbsp; Then he said, "I'm pretty sure she did not cum.&nbsp; What do the readings say?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla looked up with a start to see Claudia standing outside the glass window with a handheld meter.&nbsp; "No, you're right dear," she said, "She had some higher than normal arousal levels right when the stocks closed and again when you strapped her legs.&nbsp; But the rough penetration and pain administrations kept her from orgasm."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Excellent. That's exactly what we wanted." replied Julian.&nbsp; He picked up Ayla's leash, still attached to her collar, and dragged her over to the cot.&nbsp; She grabbed her end instinctively to keep from choking.&nbsp; He opened yet another hidden panel on the wall at the head of the bed and stuck the leash handle in where it locked.&nbsp; He walked out of the cell without so much as a backward glance at the shocked and mortified girl.&nbsp; "Tomorrow we shall see how well she handles the Eros device.&nbsp; That should be interesting."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The door to the cell closed with a sturdy thud.&nbsp; Ayla watched as they left, Julian's arm around Claudia's shoulders.&nbsp; The lights in the lab went out and the light in her cell dimmed.&nbsp; The glass wall was black.&nbsp; Ayla painfully crawled up onto the cot and curled there, shivering and wide eyed.&nbsp; Her rape had been part of an experiment.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

Future Shocked, Chapter 5

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla had not slept well.&nbsp; Pain, fear, anger and even confusion kept her mind a jumble of thoughts.&nbsp; At some point, however, she must have finally succumbed to slumber �Claudia was in the room, waking her.&nbsp; She already had the leash in her hand.&nbsp; The lights in the lab were fully on.&nbsp; "Come on slave, get up."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla, awaking with a start, scrambled to a knee hugging position, her back pressed hard against the wall.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Come here, Ayla." said Claudia in an annoyed tone, and then with a sigh, "Please tell me you didn't turn into a brain fried, paralyzed with fear victim overnight�"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Still hugging herself defensively, Ayla's waking moment of panic melded into anger.&nbsp; She glowered, "Your husband raped me last night.&nbsp; You were here, didn't you notice?"&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I will allow you that tone of voice this one time, Ayla.&nbsp; Julian did not "rape" you.&nbsp; You are a non, a slave.&nbsp; You are ours to do with as we please.&nbsp; "Rape" implies a crime; it is not a crime for a Master to fuck his slut." &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla turned her head away scowling.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Claudia gave the leash a jerk. "Now come here."&nbsp; The girl didn't move.&nbsp; "Comply or be punished."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla's head whipped around to gape at her tormentor.&nbsp; "Be punished?" Her voice was rising.&nbsp; "I complied my ass off yesterday and got fucked for it!&nbsp; It doesn't matter what I do!&nbsp; I get "punished" no matter what!"&nbsp; Tears sprung to her eyes.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Claudia gazed at her coolly, "Yes, that is true, non.&nbsp; You are a slave.&nbsp; You will be punished at our whim.&nbsp; You may be punished during my research; you may be punished just because we enjoy it."&nbsp; Ayla continued to sob quietly.&nbsp; Claudia's tone dropped.&nbsp; "But hear me now, non.&nbsp; The routine sufferings and humiliations you have experienced will be nothing compared to what punishments you will receive for willful disobedience.&nbsp; Now�..come��here." 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla paused for a moment before she unwound herself, inched herself from the sleeping platform and stood with her arms crossed protectively over her breasts.&nbsp; She kept&nbsp;&nbsp; her head down.&nbsp; She kept her legs pressed tightly together.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Claudia would have none of that.&nbsp; "Get down on your hands and knees."&nbsp; Ayla took a deep shuttering breath and did so.&nbsp; "Good girl."&nbsp; Claudia looped the leash in her hand, shortening it, and led the girl to the hole in the corner of the cell.&nbsp; "Relieve yourself, non."&nbsp; Blushing furiously, Ayla urinated like a pet being taken for a walk.&nbsp; Claudia dragged her over to the three holes in the wall.&nbsp; "Drink."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla whimpered.&nbsp; She even tried to back up slightly, shaking her head.&nbsp; "Do not make me repeat myself, non."&nbsp; Shaking nervously, Ayla crept to the fountain and slowly placed each hand, one after the other, into the holes.&nbsp; Finally, she ducked her head into the middle one.&nbsp; She closed her eyes as her mouth slipped over the phallus, expecting at any moment to be trapped there.&nbsp; She waited.&nbsp; "You're not drinking, non."&nbsp; Ayla's eyes flew open; she had not even thought that actually drinking was the point.&nbsp; She pulled the triggers and sucked the fluid down her throat.&nbsp; "Good girl.&nbsp; Now don't move."&nbsp; Ayla froze, fear rising again.&nbsp; Claudia let dangle some of the leash and gently tapped Ayla's backside with it.&nbsp; Then she ran it dragging over her back.&nbsp; "You see, slave, you can comply.&nbsp; You know that at any instant I could lock you there; there is nothing you can do about it.&nbsp; But you also know disobeying would get you much, much worse.&nbsp; You are mine, helpless and controlled.&nbsp; Don't ever forget that.&nbsp; Now come out, we have much to do today."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Still on her hands and knees, Ayla was led from her cell into the lab and to a large glass cage.&nbsp; "Stand."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla did so.&nbsp; Claudia retrieved some items from a nearby table and placed them on the leashed girl's chest, they were wireless electrodes.&nbsp; Then she strapped a thin band around her left upper arm.&nbsp; "These are heart rate and blood pressure monitors."&nbsp; Claudia turned Ayla around and pulled her hair back into a high, loose ponytail, securing it there with a large clip that had teeth like interlocking fingers.&nbsp; Claudia pulled her back around and indicated the cage, its door open, with a nod. "Get in."&nbsp; Taking a deep breath, the girl did as she was told.&nbsp; Claudia followed her in.&nbsp; The cage was two meters wide and at least three long.&nbsp; In the center-line of one narrow end, head height, Claudia attached the leash to a device made for that purpose.&nbsp; She pulled the leash through until it was quite short, Ayla would have been able to kneel with her body pressed against the wall, but she would not be able to lie down.&nbsp; With a touch, Claudia locked the leash into position, walked out and shut the cage door.&nbsp; "You're in good shape, Ayla." and then with a smile, "I've seen you run."&nbsp; She typed in a few directions on a nearby control panel.&nbsp; "We wouldn't want you to lose your conditioning.&nbsp; It's time you had some exercise.&nbsp; Don't fall."&nbsp; She turned and walked briskly away.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla's floor started to move.&nbsp; The whole thing was a treadmill, and there were no safety edges.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There wasn't much of a warm up, a few moments of walking, then brisk walking, then�. running.&nbsp; Running was not really Ayla's forte.&nbsp; Dance, aerobics, palates�all good, but running, well without a really good sports bra�.running sucked.&nbsp; She was also barefoot but the track had some give, so wasn't too painful.&nbsp; She was able to keep up, until the track started to slant.&nbsp; Running "uphill", it did not take long for Ayla to be gasping for air, her thigh muscles burning.&nbsp; The track leveled out again and the speed increased.&nbsp; She tried to hold her breasts against her body to alleviate some of the painful bounce, but couldn't run fast enough like that.&nbsp; And so it went.&nbsp; Uphill, level, faster, slower, her leash snapping taunt whenever she flagged.&nbsp; Sweat poured down her face, down her body.&nbsp; She didn't how long she had been running or how "far" she had gone, over an hour at least.&nbsp; But she knew that she must not falter, being dragged by the collar over the moving track would be very unpleasant.&nbsp; But it had been going for so long, and she was faltering.&nbsp; Her steps were thudding down gracelessly.&nbsp; She bounced off the side of the cage, stumbling.&nbsp; Finally, she took the leash in both hands, trying to use it to support herself as she staggered, wheezing.&nbsp; The tracked slowed; Ayla nearly crashed, falling, into the front wall of the cage.&nbsp; She caught herself, and slowly pulled herself up by the leash as the track came to a stop. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Have a good workout, non?"&nbsp; Ayla could barely hear Claudia's voice over her own labored breathing.&nbsp; Claudia retrieved the leash and pulled Ayla out.&nbsp; The girl leaned on a table, one arm under her breasts, supporting them, the other hand pressed against the stitch in her side.&nbsp; "I don't really want your sweaty ass on that table, non."&nbsp; Claudia gave the leash a jerk and, legs shaking, Ayla followed her.&nbsp; Claudia led her into an alcove, brightly lit and equipped with multiple shower heads.&nbsp; The woman gave the leash a downward yank and Ayla, almost gratefully, sank to her knees.&nbsp; Claudia locked the leash to the wall and exited.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla was kneeling and bent over forward, her head bowed, as the water began to rain down on her back.&nbsp; It was cool, but not shockingly cold.&nbsp; After a little while, Ayla leaned back to receive the shower on her face, her breasts and all down the front of her.&nbsp; It felt good, not completely rejuvenating, but her heartbeat was finally returning to normal.&nbsp; She opened her mouth and drank.&nbsp; She didn't try to stand.&nbsp; The thought didn't even occur to her.&nbsp; She was exhausted, her muscles fatigued to their limit, but more than that, this was where she had been placed�.and she was too tired and weak not to obey.&nbsp; The water stopped, and she was left alone to recover.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her eyes were closed, and she was breathing deeply.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her body was nearly dry when Claudia reclaimed her.&nbsp; Claudia led her out and through the damnably huge laboratory, to a device where Julian stood making adjustments.&nbsp; Ayla had a brief flash of emotion at the sight of her tormentor of the previous night but frankly, she was too tired to really give a shit.&nbsp; He turned to her with a smile, "Good morning, pet."&nbsp; Ayla returned his gaze with a blank, exhausted, look.&nbsp; He raised an eyebrow expectantly and Claudia furrowed her brows at the girl.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Good morning, Master." She said quietly.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Good girl."&nbsp; He walked to her and he and Claudia each took Ayla by the upper arm and half carrying the girl, turned her back to the restraint device of the day.&nbsp; She didn't even try to fight.&nbsp; She was strapped into a partially reclined seated position on a rack made of adjustable steel pipes.&nbsp; One horizontal pipe hit her at her shoulder blades and her arms went over that and down, locked behind at the wrists, another strap cinched her arms together at the elbow.&nbsp; She winced, her teeth clenching.&nbsp; Her legs were bent at the waist but not fully 90 degrees.&nbsp; Her knees were bent as well, and of course her legs were strapped and buckled wildly spread.&nbsp; Her sex was completely exposed.&nbsp; She regretted not putting up a struggle.&nbsp; They finished her bondage with a pair of straps crossing her chest above her breasts and one around her waist.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Claudia checked the tightness of the bonds and added some additional electrodes to Ayla's body, including two on her temples.&nbsp; Julian was filling a large syringe.&nbsp; Claudia began talking in that slightly distracted voice that doctors use while they look at your chart.&nbsp; "So, Ayla, did you have orgasms when you had bondage sex in college?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was almost enough to distract the girl from the discomfort of her position, until she remembered that her history had all been in Max's report.&nbsp; Still she hesitated, "Yes�.Mistress."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"And how, exactly, were you tied?&nbsp; On a bed I presume, spread eagle?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Ummm, no, Mistress. Just my hands above my head, wrists crossed."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I see.&nbsp; And you masturbated, of course, while self bound and while playing that game."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla blushed despite the ridiculousness of it.&nbsp; "Yes, Mistress."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"And pain, Ayla, to how much pain have you exposed yourself for sexual satisfaction?"&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla whispered, "A little, Mistress."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What, exactly?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla moaned inwardly, "A couple of clothespins, Mistress�A little spanking�"&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Claudia nodded, "Yes, alright.&nbsp; But you're not really big on masochism are you."&nbsp; It wasn't a question.&nbsp; "You didn't get off on brandings or floggings or extreme pain."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla gave a tiny, fearful, shake of the head.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Claudia looked at the helpless girl, considering.&nbsp; "Tell me, Ayla, do you think you could be forced to orgasm?&nbsp; I know that you are a bondage slut.&nbsp; Right now, with the right stimulation, I could probably get you to cum, but it would be because you allowed yourself to do so.&nbsp; But under duress, in real pain, truly afraid, would you cum?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla most certainly did not like the direction this interview was going.&nbsp; But she was honest, "No, Mistress."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Thank you for being forthright, slave.&nbsp; That's a typical response for most bondage loving women.&nbsp; There are extremes in any population sample of course; we are a very diverse species." She smiled.&nbsp; "I have studied slaves that could, in fact, be forced to orgasm under the most unpleasant of circumstances, true masochists.&nbsp; But even they don&#8217;t cum when they stub their toe."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Julian moved to the space between Ayla's legs, holding the large syringe.&nbsp; "This might sting."&nbsp; He found a vein on her inner thigh and plunged the needle in, injecting her.&nbsp; Ayla gasped in pain, but quickly recovered.&nbsp; She tried not to give him a dirty look.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Claudia continued, "Those sluts were instrumental in my work, non, in the study of brain chemistry.&nbsp; You know, as a biology major, that there is no "mind", not really, there is only "brain", that organ in your skull that runs the whole works.&nbsp; The chemicals in your brain, the hormones, the endorphins all of it, are what make you do and feel the way you do.&nbsp; My work has been primarily on sexual response but I know that, as I was falling in love with my future husband, my brain was producing the chemicals of "this is a good potential mate".&nbsp; Love is chemistry.&nbsp; The reaction to fear?&nbsp; We get adrenalin.&nbsp; Joy, fear, anger and depression, are all controlled by chemicals in the brain.&nbsp;&nbsp; I believe that I have isolated the chemicals for human female advanced sexual stimulus organic response.&nbsp; That is to say, I think I can make you cum like a maniac at the touch of a button."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla stared at the woman, and then shook her head as if waking up from a trance.&nbsp; And then, she would have shrugged had she been able, she said, "Mistress, that doesn&#8217;t sound like a bad thing to me�"&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Really?" Claudia smiled again. "Do you really think that others having that level of control over you would be pleasant?&nbsp; I could make you cum while we beat you, or while you're being forced to perform some highly strenuous task, or while swimming."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla blanched and whispered, "Torture�by orgasm�"&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Claudia nodded.&nbsp; "Your Master has just injected a large amount of nano-enhanced chemicals that are rushing to your brain even as we speak.&nbsp; They remain inert until I stimulate the nanobots to activate the chemicals to whichever degree I choose."&nbsp; Ayla's heart starting racing.&nbsp; Claudia moved close to the bound girl's ear, almost whispering, "This is the level of control I've always wanted, slave.&nbsp; Not mind control or brainwashing, nothing that changes what you think or feel artificially.&nbsp; Just total physical control with the cuffs and the ultimate in reward and punishment, pleasure and pain, with the nanobots."&nbsp; Ayla looked at her, terror stricken.&nbsp; "Oh yes, slave, the brain controls the nerve impulses for pain as well.&nbsp; But don't worry; we can't use these nanobots for that, it proves to be fatal."&nbsp; She smiled that wicked smile. "I have lots of ways to handle the pain aspects of your subjugation and I'm thinking of more all the time."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Impulsively, Ayla squirmed in her bonds.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Julian and Claudia set to work on the various surrounding apparatuses.&nbsp;&nbsp; Julian wheeled a piece of equipment between Ayla's bound legs.&nbsp; Ayla moaned as she saw it.&nbsp; It was obvious in its intended function, it was a fucking machine.&nbsp; The man gave Ayla a smile and a wink as he coated the large, flesh-colored dildo with lubricant.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh please, Master, please Mistress, don't do this to me��I'll be good�I'll do anything you say�please�."&nbsp; Her pleas were ignored.&nbsp; Julian locked the device into place with the bulbous tip of the dildo inches from her vaginal opening.&nbsp; Ayla watched drops of lubricate drip.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With the final adjustments of the equipment completed, Claudia spoke to the girl again, "Ayla, before I activate the nanobots to stimulate orgasm, we want to see what your arousal levels will be with normal stimuli.&nbsp; Your task will be NOT to cum."&nbsp; Ayla gave her a look that suggested, yet again, that the woman was crazy.&nbsp; Claudia ignored it.&nbsp; "If you feel yourself nearing orgasm, you will inform us immediately."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla indicated the dildo equipped machine with her chin, "THAT is not going to make me cum!"&nbsp; 
&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Good.&nbsp; But just in case, we, of course, will make sure that you will be too distracted to orgasm.&nbsp; After I get my base-line data, then I see how this latest formula works.&nbsp; You'll cum then, I assure you."&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Julian, in a most practical manner, spread her pussy lips and shoved the dildo a few inches inside her.&nbsp; Ayla's head came forward as she tried to struggle away from the intrusion.&nbsp; "That&#8217;s the out stroke set." he said, locking it into place.&nbsp; With a click, the machine started pumping her.&nbsp; Her mouth opened in surprise and shock as she watched the fake cock slide in and out of her cunt in a steady rhythm.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla tried to shift her body, twisting and struggling but she was well impaled and could not escape the thrusting machine.&nbsp; And then it started rotating as it pumped.&nbsp; The base of the phallus was studded with little finger-like nubs.&nbsp; At every penetration, the spinning thing went "thwap, thwap, thwap" right on her clit.&nbsp; She gasped, "Oh my God."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Damn it." Spit Claudia. "The little slut's going to cum right now!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Julian was watching both Ayla and a computer screen in turn.&nbsp; "Maybe, her arousal levels are high.&nbsp; But this meter is calibrated on a large sample size, Dear.&nbsp; She may be further on this side of the bell curve than we suspected."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Claudia took a firm grip on each of Ayla's nipples, "Let's slow her down a bit."&nbsp; She twisted, hard.&nbsp; Ayla screamed.&nbsp; Claudia raised her voice to be heard over the cries, "Where is she now, my sweet?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Hard to say�.results are wildly fluctuating.&nbsp; She may have strong latent masochistic tendencies."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Claudia, releasing her grip on the helpless girl's nipples, said, "Not good, I hate it when I threaten to whip a slave and she goes "mmmmm"!&nbsp; We'd better kick it up to make sure."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla panted, "No, please�.I'm not a masochist�please��"&nbsp; and then she groaned and her eyes rolled back a bit, the pumping, spinning cock getting to her again.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the meantime, the couple had each picked up leather straps, belt-like, with handles.&nbsp; Without warning or preamble, they began to whip her.&nbsp; The first few strikes elicited screams from the girl; the next ones caused her to beg for them to stop in incoherent, babbling and spittle filled pleas.&nbsp; Finally, each blow was followed by a moaning grunt.&nbsp; They were merciless.&nbsp; Her body was soon a mass of wide red stripes.&nbsp; The woman particularly targeted her breasts.&nbsp; Powerful, downward strokes across the tops, slapping, stinging upstrokes catching the undersides, and horrible, horrible blows right on her nipples, rained down on the bound girl as she tried unsuccessfully to twist and turn away.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Meanwhile, Julian whipped her thighs and her belly.&nbsp; The appliance that held her was made of tubes, pipes, so there was room for him to swing up and hit the undersides of her legs and her ass.&nbsp; And still the maddening pounding in her cunt continued.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla's mind was awash in pain.&nbsp; Her skin was on fire, every blow a shockwave of agony that was almost like flashes of light behind her eyelids.&nbsp; Still, her body flinched with each strike.&nbsp; Still she struggled, her hands grasping at nothing, her muscles straining.&nbsp; In the haze of suffering, something was ticking in her head.&nbsp; She felt it building, her pussy throbbed, the strokes of the dildo shooting its own shockwaves through her.&nbsp; Those chemicals, those fucking brain chemicals.&nbsp; They did this to her.&nbsp; Even as she cried out from another blow she knew, could feel it growing.&nbsp; Fuck Claudia.&nbsp; Fuck Julian.&nbsp; They put this shit in her brain and she was going to cum while they tortured her!&nbsp; Her brain was no longer her own.&nbsp; The chemicals were working.&nbsp; A long quavering moan escaped her.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Claudia, panting and sweating, stopped.&nbsp; She moved behind the girl and jerked the whipping strap between her teeth and deep into her mouth.&nbsp; With a hand gripping the strap on each side of Ayla's face, she yanked the girl's head back.&nbsp; She snarled into her ear, "You're not enjoying this are you, slave?&nbsp; Which is more powerful, your buzzing clit or your burning tits?" Ayla blinked as tears streamed down.&nbsp; Julian aimed another blow to Ayla's nether region.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The chemicals in her head worked.&nbsp; Ayla's body shook, arching against the bonds.&nbsp; She cried out through the gagging strap, "cuuuuuuuummmminnngggg!"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What!?" exclaimed Claudia.&nbsp; She jerked the strap out of Ayla's mouth and grabbed her by the hair.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Cumming!&nbsp; Mistress!!!"&nbsp; Ayla's body shook and shuttered as she cried out.&nbsp; She strained one last time, and then her body relaxed.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Julian stood still.&nbsp; Claudia released Ayla's hair and let the girl's head dangle.&nbsp; "I think we got a little carried away, my husband."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He wiped the sweat from his brow, "Why do you say that, dear?&nbsp; We were beating the crap out of her and still your drugs worked.&nbsp; She came so hard she passed out."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"That's just it," she replied, "I know we planned to orgasm her at the height of physical discomfort, to prove to her that we could control even that part of her�.but I forgot to keep track of the arousal meters and well�.."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well what?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I never activated the nanobots." 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The room was silent save for the wet, squishing "thump, thump, thump" of the fucking machine still pounding the unconscious girl.&nbsp; 


Future Shocked, part 6 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By Ayla Jaxxon

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla was aware of being carried.&nbsp; It occurred to her that Julian was very strong.&nbsp; She felt small in his arms, being carried like a child.&nbsp; One of his arms was under the bend of her knees, the other across her back; her head was slumped forward.&nbsp; It was an odd feeling really, perhaps even ironic�.she almost felt safe, carried thusly.&nbsp; She watched the laboratory go by through half lidded eyes, only vaguely aware of her surroundings.&nbsp; And of course there was the pain.&nbsp; Her body ached.&nbsp; Her own skin looked alien to her, striped and red.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He laid her down on a narrow padded table.&nbsp; Her first instinct was to roll to her side, facing away from him, and curling up into a ball.&nbsp; But he restrained her gently with his hands and his voice, "No Ayla, on your back, lay flat."&nbsp; So with a wince, she did so.&nbsp; She was fully awake now as he reached over her to the far edge of the table and pulled a curved, glass-like cover over her body.&nbsp; It closed with a substantial click and all the sounds of the lab were silenced to her.&nbsp; She was encased, the glass only a few centimeters from her nose, a finger width from her nipples.&nbsp; It made her very nervous.&nbsp; She wanted out immediately.&nbsp; She looked for Julian to plead with him, knowing that the chances of his acquiesce to her desires was unlikely.&nbsp; But he was already gone.&nbsp; She took deep calming breaths.&nbsp; Already the pain was subsiding, she was still sore to the touch, a fact she discovered trying to move in her glass coffin, but when she lie still, it was only moderately uncomfortable.&nbsp; She could only just hear the faint whirling of tiny fans, no doubt the ventilation system for her tiny cage.&nbsp; The air inside left a slight medicinal taste in her mouth.&nbsp; With a groan, she thought they might be gassing her, yet another science fiction assault on her body.&nbsp; But she felt no ill effects, if anything, she started feeling too calm�and then THAT, feeling too calm, made her nervous again.&nbsp; She thought they might be using some mind and mood altering drugs on her�but she already HAD orgasm inducing nanobots in her brain, what more did they want?!&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Again, Ayla tried to relax.&nbsp; Her mind wandered.&nbsp; She had thoughts of Snow White in her glass coffin.&nbsp; How did the story go?&nbsp; Snow White's mother wanted her daughter to have hair as black as the soot on the window sill, skin as white as the snow and lips as red as the blood of her pricked finger.&nbsp; The cartoon version didn't have THAT part.&nbsp; Ayla could pull off two of the three, she figured.&nbsp; Nearly back hair and the red lips courtesy of the makeup aisle�but white skin?&nbsp; She was a tanned farm girl.&nbsp; And what would the prince think to find her naked, and marked by a resent whipping?&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And awake, that might throw him off, too.&nbsp; Ayla remembered reading the bondage erotica version of the Sleeping Beauty story�.maybe someone needed to do one for Snow White as well.&nbsp; Somewhere on the internet, Ayla did see a cartoon drawing of Snow chained to the wall of a dungeon with the evil Queen standing nearby holding a whip and wearing a strap-on.&nbsp; It was even the cartoon version of the two characters.&nbsp; The girl almost smiled at the thought, before she remembered that she had her on evil queen to deal with now.&nbsp; Ayla sighed, and waited.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After a time, Ayla caught movement across the lab.&nbsp; Julian and Claudia were moving towards her.&nbsp; They were talking but the glass box cut off any sound, Ayla took a deep breath and exhaled strongly through her nose just to hear something.&nbsp; The two stood nearby chatting animatedly for a while longer.&nbsp; Finally, with a kiss, Julian left his wife.&nbsp; Ayla tried to lie very still.&nbsp; At first, she had tried to cover herself with her hands but the touch of the glass was almost unnerving and her skin was still tender to the touch.&nbsp; It seemed a bit dumb anyway�she had been completely naked for days.&nbsp; Now she was just flat out, her hands at her sides, looking at her Mistress and wondering what would happen next.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Claudia pressed a button and suddenly Ayla heard her voice as she spoke, "Scooch up a bit, Ayla, towards this end."&nbsp; She indicated the head end of the box and Ayla wormed her way up a couple of inches.&nbsp; "There, stop."&nbsp; Claudia pressed another button and Ayla heard a muffled click.&nbsp; She felt her legs jerked apart quickly but only a few inches, her wrists too moved out just a bit and were held fast.&nbsp; Her cuffs were locked into position.&nbsp; She tried, instinctively, to rise up but her throat hit her collar with a choking jerk.&nbsp; Her collar was fixed as well.&nbsp; The cuffs and collar might as well have been bolted in place, there was absolutely no give.&nbsp; Claudia opened the glass cage with a satisfied and considering look on her face.&nbsp; Ayla felt the cooler air of the lab waft over her skin.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Claudia pulled a normal looking stool over and sat on it, right by Ayla's side.&nbsp; Claudia just stared at her for a few moments.&nbsp; Ayla grew more nervous, so scrutinized.&nbsp; Claudia sighed and said, "What a diverse species we are."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Huh?" was all that Ayla could say, her brow furrowed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Claudia almost smiled, "Well, scientists like to categorize things, but our species is really quite amazing.&nbsp; We like to think of ourselves as "unique" but of course we have so much in common and share so many traits.&nbsp; We can, therefore, put people into categories and make assumptions on how they will react to stimuli.&nbsp; On the other hand, one must remember that�.there are a LOT of categories.&nbsp; You, for instance, are quite fascinating.&nbsp; By no means are you unique, but you are interesting."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; "Ummm, thank you?" replied Ayla, and then as a quick afterthought, she added, "Mistress."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Claudia paused for a moment, then, "Did you have a nice little cum, slave?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"More mind games," Ayla thought to herself.&nbsp; Trying not to show any resentment, Ayla replied, "It's not as though you gave me any choice, Mistress."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Claudia did smile, "the nanobots made you do it, eh?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla looked at her quizzically, "Wasn't that the whole point, Mistress?&nbsp; Isn't that why you put those things in my head?"&nbsp; Her fists clenched a bit as she pulled at the cuffs.&nbsp; "It's not enough that you control my body, you had to control my brain?!"&nbsp; Ayla started to feel overwhelmed again, fear and anger rising.&nbsp; She began to cry, thinking about everything that had been done to her.&nbsp; She jerked at the cuffs in frustration.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes, Ayla, that is true.&nbsp; I do control you." And then she added with a matter-of-fact shrug, "I own you.&nbsp; But as far as your recent orgasm, I never activated the nanobots.&nbsp; You had that one all on your own.""
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It took a moment for that to dawn on the struggling girl. She became still. "I don't believe you."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Alright, I understand that you wouldn't want to believe that.&nbsp; It doesn't fit in with your view of yourself.&nbsp; You're an innocent victim, not a pain slut masochist.&nbsp; However, I've checked the nanobots in you system three times now and I can assure you that they have yet to be activated.&nbsp; I thought perhaps they may have been triggered accidentally, but they were not.&nbsp; So let us continue the experiment, shall we?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla moaned, "Please don't beat me anymore Mistress, please�"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I'm not going to beat you, slave, not right now anyway.&nbsp; But you are bound and helpless, and we both know that excites you sexually.&nbsp; So I'm going to see if that and the 'bots cause the response we're looking for.&nbsp; We'll call this the "O" button."&nbsp; She used her remote to signal the microscopic objects lodged in the bound girl's brain.&nbsp;&nbsp; Immediately, Ayla felt something, a warmth throughout her body, a quickening of her heart rate.&nbsp; The feeling was akin to arousal�but different, well maybe�it was�not bad.&nbsp; Already, her nether region was tingling, her brain increasing the blood flow.&nbsp; Her sex felt as though it was swelling.&nbsp; She knew she was getting wet.&nbsp; She licked her lips, her breath coming in quickening pants.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Claudia looked on with curiosity, glancing at various monitors as she observed the girl.&nbsp; "What are you feeling right now, slave?"&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla looked up, both confused and frustrated.&nbsp; She stammered, "Well, umm, it's interesting, Mistress.&nbsp; I feel kinda warm and tingly."&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Are you having an orgasm?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I don't think so."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Claudia snorted in frustration, "This is not how I expected this to work at all!"&nbsp; She thrust her hand between Ayla's legs and literally grabbed her sex, causing the girl to buck, gasping.&nbsp; "Look at you!&nbsp; You're soaking wet!&nbsp; I thought the nanobots would trigger an orgasmic response immediately, the whole idea was to bypass the need for bodily stimulation."&nbsp; She sighed loudly, "Apparently, they are stimulating the physical manifestations of arousal, but not the orgasmic conclusion!"&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With a thoughtful look on her face, Claudia began to absentmindedly drum her fingers on Ayla's pussy.&nbsp;&nbsp; Ayla was writhing.&nbsp; "Damn." She said to herself, "where did I go wrong in my calculations?" She tapped rather hard right on the same spot, punctuating each syllable.&nbsp; "This is very confusing."&nbsp; Ayla's head was whipping to one side then the other, her pelvis thrusting up off of the table.&nbsp; "Your brain's reaction to the stimulation seems to be causing a pre-orgasmic state."&nbsp; Claudia was still rather lost in her thoughts, only distracted by Ayla's thrashing enough to be a little annoyed.&nbsp; Using her free hand she smacked the girl's tit.&nbsp; "Ayla! Settle down, I'm trying to think!"&nbsp; Ayla's body shuttered, she moaned loudly, her hips still trusting.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Claudia finally noticed the girl's reactions.&nbsp; She quickly brought both of her hands up and held them as though she had a gun pointed at her.&nbsp; Ayla groaned and shot a look at the woman, her eyes wide, her lip trembling.&nbsp; "Juno's girdle, slut!&nbsp; You're about to cum again!"&nbsp; A crooked smile spread across Claudia's face.&nbsp; Ayla whimpered.&nbsp; Claudia said in a husky voice, "This may be even better.&nbsp; The nanobots bring you to the edge!&nbsp; How delicious!&nbsp; I could keep you on the verge of orgasm for��hours!&nbsp; Maybe days!"&nbsp; She started pacing.&nbsp; "Eventually the brain will have to shut the reactions off��for self preservation�..but certainly hours�and we'll have to experiment to narrow the variables."&nbsp; Meanwhile, Ayla was desperately trying to twist her body to the side and reach her own clit with straining fingers.&nbsp; "Oh no, no, no little slut, you're not allowed to cum now��Now we have a new plan."&nbsp; The Mistress clicked one more button and the belt around Ayla's waist slammed back to the table, holding her fast.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh no!&nbsp; Please Mistress!&nbsp; I'm so close!"&nbsp; she struggled as best she could.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What a change in you, slave!&nbsp; Now you want to cum?!"&nbsp; Claudia smiled broadly, "And, ironically, I won't let you!"&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla whimpered again.&nbsp; She did want to cum.&nbsp; I was so easy to forget the pain, the exhaustion, even the fear.&nbsp; Her body told her that she was aroused, incredibly aroused.&nbsp; It overrode all else, she was desperate, getting that orgasm seemed more important than anything else.&nbsp; She twisted and squirmed.&nbsp; Her body strained against the bonds as her hips continued to pump.&nbsp; But it only lasted for a few minutes.&nbsp; Very quickly the feelings started to fade.&nbsp; Ayla quieted in amazement, it was like waking up from a dream or hypnosis.&nbsp; The chemicals in her body were fading.&nbsp; She was right back where she had been mentally and physiologically, nervous and exhausted.&nbsp; She could scarcely believe 
that just seconds before, she had been straining to touch herself.&nbsp; She still smelled her own lingering excitement.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Claudia looked at her with a snort, "Well, that didn't last long."&nbsp; She pressed the "O" button again.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh fuck!" cried the girl.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No, not yet.&nbsp; Maybe later, slut" Claudia replied with a grin.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And so the rest of the day went.&nbsp; Claudia trying various patterns of nanobot chemical induced arousal states on Ayla as she kept the girl fastened hard to the table.&nbsp; Ayla nearly passed out again twice.&nbsp; She also cried, and begged and screamed and struggled.&nbsp; All this simply noted by the scientist.&nbsp; Every once in a while, Claudia would touch her�running a quick finger over her wet slit, tickling her throbbing clitoris ever so lightly�.flicking her nipples.&nbsp; She did this with a bemused look on her face and an occasional licking of the lips.&nbsp; But it was all to see the helplessly aroused girl's reactions, which were piteous.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Finally, hours later, Claudia allowed Ayla to recover fully, at least from the forced arousal.&nbsp; The girl was physically spent and gasping.&nbsp; However, when the chemicals dissipated, so to did her body's reactions.&nbsp; Only the exhaustion and fearful amazement remained.&nbsp; Claudia pushed her own hair back out of her face.&nbsp; "That was a truly interesting afternoon, slave.&nbsp; I'm rather turned on myself now." And then she added with a smile, "I hope my husband is prepared for a long night."&nbsp; Claudia attached the leash to Ayla's collar before releasing all the cuff attachments from the table.&nbsp; Ayla rose shakily to her feet.&nbsp; "Tsk tsk, slave, hands and knees."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla sank down, "Yes, Mistress."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Claudia allowed Ayla to crawl slowly through the lab to a small pantry.&nbsp; She fastened the leash handle to a locking hook on the wall, these devices were everywhere it seemed, and proceeded to prepare food for the girl.&nbsp; The hair clip from the morning's run was still on Ayla's head, but pushed off to the side in a disheveled mess, so before she put the bowl of food within reach, Claudia rearranged it to hold Ayla's hair back again.&nbsp; Then she placed a stainless steel bowl on the floor in front of the girl.&nbsp; Ayla sighed, frowning.&nbsp; It looked just like a fricking dog bowl.&nbsp; And the food looked like dog food, dry dog food.&nbsp; "That's today's only meal, non, best eat while you may."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With another sigh, she did.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t dog food, well if it was, it wasn&#8217;t what she thought dog food would taste like�.not that Ayla had ever tasted dog food.&nbsp; But she had always lived with dogs and knew what dog food smelled like, and this didn't.&nbsp; It really wasn&#8217;t bad, bland but a little sweet, and not at all unpleasant. And she was suddenly ravenous.&nbsp; She didn't even think to use her hands, but just ate out of the bowl like�well, like a pet.&nbsp; This did not go unnoticed by her Mistress, who smiled.&nbsp; The food wasn't as hard and dry as it looked and the girl ate every morsel greedily, chasing the last piece around the bowl with her tongue.&nbsp; He could have eaten another bowlful but it was not in the offing.&nbsp; Claudia retrieved the leash and led the girl to her cell.&nbsp; She also picked up a clipboard looking object on the way.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Back in the cell, Claudia pulled Ayla up into a kneeling position.&nbsp; The girl's body was still stripped from the beating earlier, but the signs of injury were already fading.&nbsp; Claudia cocked her head, "Even for one who has received out regenerative serums, you heal very quickly, Ayla."&nbsp; Ayla just nodded wearily.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Claudia held the clipboard-like device where the kneeling girl could see it.&nbsp; "This is some reading material for you, non."&nbsp; Ayla studied the flat object.&nbsp; Claudia continued, "Here is the title page, I have loaded three books to get you started.&nbsp; Press here to select the book, and scroll down here to chose the chapters, here to open the page, here to turn to the next page and here to save your place."&nbsp; Ayla just stared with a blank look on her face as Claudia handed the "book" to her.&nbsp; "It's very simple.&nbsp; Play with it a bit and you'll figure it out.&nbsp; There will be a test."&nbsp; Ayla looked up, not knowing if she was being mocked or not.&nbsp; Claudia unhooked the leash from Ayla's collar and strode out.&nbsp; Before she closed the door, she said, "You may read after lights out if you wish, the pages are self illuminating.&nbsp; But don't stay up too late.&nbsp; You'll need your rest.&nbsp; The door closed with its significant thud. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After Claudia left the laboratory, Ayla stood up, using the sleeping platform to help herself do so.&nbsp; She left the book tablet there; it was the only place to put anything except for the floor, in this cell.&nbsp; She stretched a little, she was very sore both from the whipping and the morning run.&nbsp; She was also still hungry.&nbsp; It seemed like she was always hungry.&nbsp; She had to steel herself both mentally and physically to get a drink from the phallic fountain.&nbsp; She drank and was not trapped by it this time, but you never knew.&nbsp; She sighed as she leaned against a wall, "Just another day in sci-fi sex slave land." She cupped her hand underneath her own right breast and held it up to inspect the wounds.&nbsp; She shook her head in amazement that such a thing had been done to her...and that she could now scarcely recall how horrible it had been.&nbsp; It had been horrible, hadn't it?&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Finally, she sat heavily on the bench and picked up the book.&nbsp; It flickered to life under her touch.&nbsp; There were three titles listed.&nbsp; "The History and Art of the Roman Empire" was the first, "Gnaeus- and the Founding of Tarcrete: A Cultural Dissertation" was next, and the last, "The Unpublished Works of the Marquis de Sade." 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla picked the last one first.&nbsp; The Title page came up on the screen but quickly faded to be replaced by a note, it looked hand written.&nbsp; It said, "Naughty slave, you don't get to read this one until you've read the other two first."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla grimaced, and with another sigh, began reading The History and Art of the Roman Empire.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 







 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; Future Shocked, part 7
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By Ayla Jaxxon

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The History of the Roman Empire, fascinating as it may be, did not hold Ayla's interest for very long.&nbsp; She got through the introduction and into the first chapter before weariness overcame her.&nbsp; She stashed the computerized book underneath her bed and quickly fell asleep, too tired to think about all the conflicting emotions she felt.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla awoke on her own the next morning.&nbsp; At least she thought it must be morning, the lights in the lab were coming up, she felt rested.&nbsp; She took care of her morning needs and then sat against the wall with her "book".&nbsp; She read for a while but found herself constantly looking up to see if either of her�..owners�..were coming for her.&nbsp; "This is ridiculous!" she said to herself.&nbsp; "I should be grateful to be left alone by those sadistic fucks."&nbsp; But she wasn't, not really.&nbsp; She was bored.&nbsp; She gave up on the book for a while and paced her cell.&nbsp; She stretched, only a little muscle soreness lingered and it was the good kind, the day after a workout kind.&nbsp; The welts on her skin were nearly gone.&nbsp; She was hungry.&nbsp; Hungry again�.still�whatever.&nbsp; More pacing.&nbsp; "Claudia must have fucked the shit out of Julian.&nbsp; They must be sleeping in."&nbsp; Finally, she went back to "The legacy of Julius Caesar."&nbsp; How exciting.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She forced herself to read for what must have been several hours.&nbsp; It was hard to get comfortable as there was no pillow to prop her up on in "bed" and the floor got hard on her bum quickly.&nbsp; And still her eyes were drawn to the lab, the empty lab.&nbsp; Her mind wandered until unpleasant thoughts emerged.&nbsp; "Oh my God!" she thought. "What if something happened to them?&nbsp; A home intruder killed them in their sleep!&nbsp; U.S. commandos attacked the island to throw off the yoke of Tarcrete's high tech blackmail!&nbsp; What if they left and had an accident!&nbsp; Do they even HAVE cars here?!&nbsp; Oh shit!&nbsp; I could DIE in here!"&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She took several deep breaths to calm herself.&nbsp; "Don't go nuts, Ayla.&nbsp; And quit talking to yourself."&nbsp; She paced for a while, she leaned on the wall, paced some more, she thumped on the glass.&nbsp; "This sucks."&nbsp; More time passed. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Still later, while staring at nothing, she heard a metallic click and hum.&nbsp; She turned to see a tray extrude from the wall near the head of her bed, about waist height.&nbsp; Curiosity was much more powerful than caution and she sped to see what it was.&nbsp; It was food.&nbsp; Three energy bar sized hunks of�something�were on the tray.&nbsp; It did not look as though it could be a trap and at this point she hardly cared.&nbsp; She scooped up all three bars lest the tray slide away, taking them back into the wall.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Clutching her horde, she huddled in a corner with her knees drawn up.&nbsp; She froze.&nbsp; "Shit, I'm like a little rodent!&nbsp; Grab the food and go hide in a corner with it!"&nbsp; She tried to relax.&nbsp; "It's just food, I am human.&nbsp; I can control myself." 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With forced calm, Ayla took a moment to examine the bars.&nbsp; One looked pretty much like a standard granola bar, made with oats and nuts.&nbsp; The second was green and smooth and softer, but it broke in half easily having the consistency of a chocolate candy bar.&nbsp; The third LOOKED like a chocolate candy bar, thicker and two layered.&nbsp; The bottom layer was peanut butter colored.&nbsp; She smelled the last one, it smelled like chocolate and peanut butter.&nbsp; She took a small bite.&nbsp; It WAS chocolate and peanut butter!&nbsp; She stuffed it into her mouth, biting and chewing ravenously.&nbsp; She moaned in ecstasy.&nbsp; "Ohmygodohmygodohmygod."&nbsp; Was her love of peanut butter and chocolate brownies in her pre-capture file?!&nbsp; She chewed with her eyes closed and her head tilted back.&nbsp; It was so good.&nbsp; Ten more of those would be pretty fine right now.&nbsp; She sighed, "I should have saved that for last.&nbsp; Who am I kidding?&nbsp; There's no way I could have saved that."&nbsp; She sat there for a few moments just savoring the lingering taste in her mouth.&nbsp; With another sigh, she tried the green one.&nbsp; Vegetables.&nbsp; Kinda green pea soup flavored.&nbsp;&nbsp; She liked green pea soup well enough, she would have preferred more chocolate peanut butter brownies but you can't have everything.&nbsp; The last was the granola bar; it tasted like a granola bar.&nbsp; She ate every crumb and licked her fingers.&nbsp; "Whoopee, dinner."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She sat there staring out of her cell, alone.&nbsp; Finally, the lights in the lab dimmed, followed by the lights in her cell.&nbsp; After a bit of staring in the dark, Ayla curled up on her sleeping shelf for a fitful night of sleep.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was awake before the lights came up.&nbsp; She was still morosely looking out into the lab when the lights came on.&nbsp; She swung her legs over the side and sat there, leaning forward on her hands.&nbsp; She stretched, arms up and back arched.&nbsp; She was rubbing her face when Julian came into the lab.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla hopped up quickly and bounded to the window, pressing her palms against the glass, peering out.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Are you that happy to see me, non?" asked Julian with a crooked grin.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No!" Ayla blurted out, "Well, yes�.I guess�relieved mostly."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Julian raised an eyebrow.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Master." Ayla added, her eyes downcast.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"That's better.&nbsp; And you should be kneeling."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla sunk to her knees, "Yes Master.&nbsp; Sorry Master.&nbsp; Where were you?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yesterday?&nbsp; We were busy elsewhere.&nbsp; You are a slave, what your owners do is for you to endure, not question."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes, Master, it's just that�.."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He gave her a look that cut her off and she said no more about it.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Julian operated his remote and Ayla's wrists whipped behind her back and the cuffs clicked together.&nbsp; She started, blinking in surprise.&nbsp; Using the bio-scanner keypad, Julian opened her cell door and came in, a coiled leash in his hand.&nbsp; He quickly and smoothly clipped the leash to her collar and pulled her up.&nbsp; "Come."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She barely had the "Yes Master." from her lips then he was dragging her out and to the elevator.&nbsp; Again, he placed her facing a back corner and held her there pressing into it.&nbsp; Upstairs, he led her through the main room and outside.&nbsp; Ayla winced at the bright tropical sun.&nbsp; She had not been outside since the day they captured her.&nbsp; She found it hard to believe that had only been what, four days ago.&nbsp; Four days, it seemed like weeks.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Julian led her down a stone path to a beautiful, crystal clear swimming pool.&nbsp; Fine wooden chairs and an umbrella covered table stood on a raised deck, pool side.&nbsp; It was a good sized pool.&nbsp; At the edge, Julian unclipped the leash and said.&nbsp; "I know you can swim, Ayla.&nbsp; This pool is twenty five meters long.&nbsp; How many full laps do you think you could do?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla looked at the pool rather nervously.&nbsp; It was true that she could swim but she was never a "lap" swimmer.&nbsp; Pools were mostly for fun, playing with friends�.showing off her bikini.&nbsp; "I�.I have no idea, Master.&nbsp; Ten or twelve, maybe?"&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He nodded, "Alright.&nbsp; Today you do thirty laps to start.&nbsp; More later if I think you need it."&nbsp; She looked at him wide eyed.&nbsp; "Thirty laps is only about half a mile, you're a strong girl.&nbsp; It should be no problem for you."&nbsp; Ayla started to shake.&nbsp; "Look, see the black panel at the other end?&nbsp; There's one on this end as well, touch each of them for each lap.&nbsp; They're electronic counters.&nbsp; You may rest if you need to with sidestroke or on your back but do not stop moving.&nbsp; If I see you floating or treading water I will snap your cuffs together and you can try a few laps like that.&nbsp; Got it?"&nbsp; She nodded quickly.&nbsp; He pushed her in, she fell panicking but thankfully her wrist cuffs came apart at his click as she hit the water.&nbsp; She came up sputtering.&nbsp; "I'll be at that table working and watching.&nbsp; Now go."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;What else was there to do?&nbsp; She went.&nbsp; The pool was deep and cool.&nbsp; She was pretty sure she couldn't touch the bottom even if she paused long enough to try.&nbsp; Her freestyle "crawl" stroke wasn't good and she felt fatigued after only a couple of laps so she switched to the breast stroke.&nbsp; It was slower but easier.&nbsp; Her mind flashed on watching the Olympics, the only time she watched swimmers.&nbsp; She knew they did that fancy flip over roll thing at the end of their laps but she sure as hell didn't know how it was done.&nbsp; But she was able to bring her feet up and get a kick off after a few laps of practice.&nbsp; She was soon tired.&nbsp; She paused ever so briefly at one end, hanging onto the side and gasping.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No."&nbsp; She heard Julian's voice.&nbsp; "Don't stop."&nbsp; She heaved a deep breath and kept on.&nbsp; The far side seemed so far away, it was like it got further away each time.&nbsp; She swam on doggedly.&nbsp; It became a quest for her, keep swimming, don't stop, finish.&nbsp; She went to a weak sidestroke.&nbsp; Back and forth.&nbsp; Finally, she came back to see Julian standing at the end of the pool.&nbsp; "Good girl.&nbsp; That was thirty."&nbsp; She stopped, breathing deeply and clinging to the edge.&nbsp; He offered both hands to her, he had his arms crossed.&nbsp; She took his hands and he pulled her up and out of the pool with seemingly little effort.&nbsp; As he raised her, he uncrossed her arms, spinning her around and sat her on the edge of the pool.&nbsp; Sitting there catching her breath but for a moment before he clicked her leash to her collar.&nbsp; "Come, you may rest over here."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He led her to the deck.&nbsp; Near the table and chairs there was a low chaise lounge sort of thing.&nbsp; It was flat and sported a quilted cushion with a bamboo and crane patterned cover.&nbsp; Near the lounge, at the head, there was a thick post.&nbsp; It reminded Ayla of a cement filled parking lot post but this one was painted dark green instead of bright yellow.&nbsp; Julian locked her leash to a heavy ring on the post.&nbsp; "Lie down."&nbsp; She did.&nbsp; She lay on her front, resting her head on her arm as she watched him move back to the table and pick up one of those electronic notepads.&nbsp; She caught herself looking at him "that" way.&nbsp; Appraising him, thinking about his body, his arms.&nbsp; She scolded herself mentally.&nbsp; But still, he was quite a man��. for an evil sadistic bastard.&nbsp; He was wearing cream colored loose weave drawstring pants and a light, gauzy, blue shirt.&nbsp; His shirt hung open unbuttoned.&nbsp; The way his mid length hair curled over his forehead and his neatly trimmed beard from below accented his brooding eyes�.. "Son of a bitch!" she said to herself, shaking her head as if to wake up, "he's got me leashed to a frickin post!"&nbsp; Yes, here she was, lounging, tethered, naked under the sun at the feet of her God damned Master.&nbsp; "I can not fucking believe this."&nbsp; What she really couldn't believe, was that she almost sorta kinda�.didn't mind.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She must have dozed for a bit, she didn't remember Julian leaving but when she opened her eyes he was gone.&nbsp; Her hair was still somewhat wet but she was dry otherwise.&nbsp; It didn't take long to dry in the sun.&nbsp; She thought she heard something and rolled over to see Julian returning from the house with a tray.&nbsp; He sat the tray on the table and pulled a chair closer to her.&nbsp; "You may kneel on the cushion, girl." 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She got up to her knees quickly, "Thank you, Master." She still, at least occasionally, cringed inside when she heard those words leave her lips so easily.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was a meal much like her first at the hands of her captors, cubed fruit and flavored tofu.&nbsp; There was also the addition of some smoky and flavorful cheese which was very nice.&nbsp; Each bite was placed directly into her open and awaiting mouth.&nbsp; After a few bites, he offered her a drink out of a dark blue bottle.&nbsp; He did not let her use her own hands but rather placed it to her lips himself.&nbsp; She nearly choked; she was very surprised to find the bottle was full of wine.&nbsp; Ayla was not a wine drinker.&nbsp; She coughed and some of the wine ran down her chin.&nbsp; Julian smiled.&nbsp; "Now now dear, don't waste it.&nbsp; This is good stuff."&nbsp; Ayla nodded apologetically as she wiped her mouth with the back of her hand. "I know you are not a "drinker", Ayla.&nbsp; But wine is good for you.&nbsp; So you will drink it."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes, Master."&nbsp; But she didn't have to drink much, just a few sips really.&nbsp; And the rest of her meal went uneventfully.&nbsp; He did not have her lick his fingers clean.&nbsp; He went back to the table and continued working on his electronic device, leaving Ayla to lay back down on her lounge.&nbsp; She was on her back, one knee up, her head pillowed on one arm.&nbsp; It was unnervingly pleasant.&nbsp; She watched birds and clouds.&nbsp; It suddenly occurred to her that she had been exposed to the tropical sun, nude, for hours now��she was going to be fried!&nbsp; She looked at her arms.&nbsp; There was not a hint of redness.&nbsp; Her old tan lines were barely noticeable now but other than that, she showed no signs of sunburn.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Master?" she asked quietly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Hmmm?" he replied without looking up.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Master, I don't seem to be sunburned yet�but shouldn't we use some sunscreen or something?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He looked up with an expression that was half annoyed and half bemused.&nbsp; "We won't burn, slave.&nbsp; Healing serums.&nbsp; Your Skin will produce the exact amount of melanin needed to protect its self." He resumed his work.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla just nodded, keeping her wonder and amazement to herself.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After what must have been several more hours, Julian cuffed her hands behind and retrieved her leash from the post.&nbsp; Without a word, he led her back to her cell in the lab.&nbsp; Ayla tried not to groan aloud; she sure as hell didn't want to go back in there.&nbsp; But she was resigned; there wasn't anything she could do to stop it from happening.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He removed her leash and left her there, freeing her wrists after he locked the door from the outside.&nbsp; Then he was gone.&nbsp; Ayla slumped, leaning on her bed shelf.&nbsp; Today had almost been�nice.&nbsp; She looked at her book and did groan out loud.&nbsp; "I'm being tortured with historical boredom."&nbsp; But she sat and read.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The lights had not been out for long, Ayla was still awake, when Claudia entered the lab.&nbsp; She only turned the lights back on partially.&nbsp; The room was dimly lit and creepy.&nbsp; Ayla rolled off of her bed and got to her knees as Claudia entered her cell.&nbsp; Claudia was clicking Ayla's cuffs behind her back as she did so.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Good evening, Mistress�."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Something about the way Claudia was looking at her made Ayla nervous, well, more nervous.&nbsp; The woman had an odd, indecipherable expression.&nbsp; Not angry, not her usual calculating look�.something else.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Is there something�." No, that wasn&#8217;t the thing to say.&nbsp; "I was wondering about�"&nbsp; No, that that either.&nbsp; Finally Ayla just said lamely, "We missed you at the pool today, Mistress."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Claudia almost smiled.&nbsp; She placed her forefinger on Ayla's lips, pressing gently.&nbsp; There was no mistaking that gesture.&nbsp; Ayla hushed.&nbsp; She also noticed her Mistress had a handful of black leather straps.&nbsp; Claudia placed the bundle of objects on the bed and with her remote, clicked the girl's ankle cuffs open.&nbsp; Ayla started as the cuffs fell apart; the right one brushing her leg as it rolled away.&nbsp; Then, with another click, her collar unlocked.&nbsp; Claudia gently removed it from her neck.&nbsp; It was soon replaced.&nbsp; Claudia picked up a wide leather collar from the bed.&nbsp; It was almost posture collar wide, with rolled and sculpted edges and a large steel ring riveted to the front.&nbsp; A wide strap hung from the back of the collar, not long, with two wide cuffs attached near the end.&nbsp; Three locking buckles on one side secured the thing around Ayla's throat.&nbsp; It was snug.&nbsp; Ayla could barely turn her head and could not tilt it downwards.&nbsp; She gulped.&nbsp; Claudia leashed her and locked the leash handle to the wall before moving behind the girl.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Claudia pushed Ayla's hair over her shoulder to one side.&nbsp; Manipulating her controls, she locked one of the techno wrist cuffs the Ayla's belt and unlocked and removed the other.&nbsp; Ayla could feel Claudia's grip on her "free" arm.&nbsp; Could she have struggled away?&nbsp; Maybe.&nbsp; But she was still leashed to the wall and had only one arm�.and Claudia simply folded her arm up high on her back, and locked her wrist in the new, dangling cuff before she could react, buckling it securely.&nbsp; She could feel the increased pressure of her arm pulling against the wide collar.&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t choking, but it was pressure.&nbsp; Claudia efficiently repeated the maneuver on her other wrist, locking it just below the first.&nbsp; Then she locked new, leather ankle cuffs on the girl, with a hobbling strap between them.&nbsp;&nbsp; She unlocked and removed the bondage belt.&nbsp; `Lastly, Claudia picked up a thick black blindfold.&nbsp; Ayla's eyes grew wide at the sight of it.&nbsp; It was wide with rolled padded edges; the wide strap had two locking buckles.&nbsp; Ayla almost spoke, almost begged, her mouth opened slightly.&nbsp; Her head moved back away from the thing as Claudia pulled it towards her face.&nbsp; Ayla's lip quivered.&nbsp; Then it was dark.&nbsp; She felt the strap buckled tightly at the back of her head.&nbsp; Total blackness.&nbsp; The padding around the edge of the blindfold cut off all light.&nbsp; Ayla swallowed, frightened.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Still without speaking, Claudia retrieved the leash, helped Ayla to her feet, and led her from the cell.&nbsp; The collar was like having someone's hand gripped around your throat, almost squeezing, always threatening.&nbsp; Ayla stumbled quietly behind, blind and bound.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She felt the movement of the elevator, she heard Claudia's breathing, she heard her OWN breathing.&nbsp; Her heart was pounding.&nbsp; She felt the cool breeze from the open windows as Claudia pulled her through the main room, upstairs.&nbsp; She stumbled along, unable to adjust to the hobbles on her ankles, hobbles she could not see.&nbsp; Ayla had no idea where she was, they turned twice.&nbsp; She was sure they entered a room, Ayla felt the door jam brush her shoulder as they entered.&nbsp; She stopped as soon as Claudia stopped pulling.&nbsp; Standing in darkness, she tested the cuffs behind her back, tensing almost unconsciously, feeling trapped.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Claudia took a firm grip on each of Ayla's nipples and pulled her forward by them until the girl felt the edge of the bed hit her right above the knees.&nbsp; It had to be a bed; the feel of a soft mattress was instantly recognizable.&nbsp; Still, bumping into it unexpectantly caused the girl to gasp.&nbsp; Claudia placed her hand on the back of Ayla's thigh, pulled it up to the side and positioned it on the bed.&nbsp; Ayla understood; she leaned forward and crawled onto the mattress, kneeling wide to keep her balance.&nbsp; Ayla felt a renewed steady pull on her leash.&nbsp; Then she felt Claudia's hand on her lower back, a hand that slid down to her ass, still pushing her forward, fingers between her buttocks.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Someone else was on the bed.&nbsp; Ayla started to breathe more quickly.&nbsp; Then, she was being pulled, and pushed, down.&nbsp; The leash on her collar was being pulled down, she had to follow.&nbsp; Claudia's hands, one twisted in her hair, the other moved up to her back, right above her cuffed wrists, pressed her down as well.&nbsp; On her knees, leaning over, her lips came in contact with something hard and fleshy.&nbsp; She knew.&nbsp; She knew right away.&nbsp; It was Julian's cock.&nbsp; Her hands opened and closed, her lips quivered.&nbsp; There was no resistance here.&nbsp; How could there be?&nbsp; Slowly, tentatively, she opened her mouth to accept him.&nbsp; She was gently forced down on him.&nbsp; At first they didn&#8217;t move, just left her there with him in her mouth, gagging her, filling her.&nbsp; She couldn&#8217;t breathe.&nbsp; He was big.&nbsp; Not unnaturally so, but he was well endowed.&nbsp; After a moment, just when she was starting to panic, they began to pull her up and down, fucking him with her mouth.&nbsp; Then she felt Claudia release her hair; then she felt her push more gently, and then she stopped pushing altogether, leaving Ayla to pump his cock on her own�which she did, sliding up and down his shaft.&nbsp; She felt Julian's hands on her head, controlling her speed.&nbsp; Then she felt Julia start to caress her body.&nbsp; Julia had obviously undressed, Ayla felt her skin to skin.&nbsp; Claudia joined her at her husband's penis, licking him, licking Ayla's face, kissing her.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla felt Claudia move up to her husband's face, she heard them kissing.&nbsp; He must have been touching her as well, she was moaning into his mouth.&nbsp; This went on for a while as Ayla continued to service Julian.&nbsp; Ayla expected him to cum in her mouth at any moment.&nbsp; Already he had lasted longer than any man she had ever been with.&nbsp; In fact, he didn't cum in her at all.&nbsp; She was drawn up from her labors, pulled kneeling into their embrace, both of then holding her.&nbsp; Claudia kissed her deeply, an owner's kiss, invading Ayla's mouth with her tongue, holding her head tightly between her hands.&nbsp; Meanwhile, Julian went to work on her breasts, sucking her right tit hard while kneading the other in his calloused hand.&nbsp; It was�.it was��.good.&nbsp; Ayla forced any complaint back out of her head, she felt herself growing more and more aroused�and there were no nanobots involved.&nbsp; The blindfold, the collar around her throat, the arms bound severely behind her back, all these things just made her feel more helpless, more controlled.&nbsp; She could enjoy this because she had no choice, they owned her, possessed her.&nbsp; They were having sex, and she was their sex toy.&nbsp; They moved her again, she was pushed to her belly, lying flat out and dragged forward with hurried passion to Claudia's moist pussy.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Claudia grabbed the back of her head and forced her hard and tight onto herself.&nbsp; Ayla could barely get her tongue out to lick her and simply mouthed her with all she had.&nbsp; Claudia was gushing.&nbsp; She pumped her crotch on Ayla's face.&nbsp; She was moaning and Ayla felt her shuttering.&nbsp; Julian spread Ayla's leg wide, he must have positioned himself between them, and she felt his hand on her sex.&nbsp; He lifted her pelvis off from the bed, arching her back, her ass high.&nbsp; Claudia moaned even louder as Ayla's face buried in deeper.&nbsp; Julian's thumb was in Ayla then, the rest of his fingers gripping her from the outside, squeezing, rubbing.&nbsp; He slid in and out so easily.&nbsp; Claudia must have cum.&nbsp; She grunted long and loud and then fairly flung Ayla off of her.&nbsp; Working in concert, the couple flipped the girl over again and Claudia dove for her cunt.&nbsp; Ayla's legs were high in the air, held wide.&nbsp; A gasp escaped her lips.&nbsp; Julian was at her head, fist in her hair, tilting her head back.&nbsp; He gagged her with his two middle fingers, forcing her to suck her own juices from them.&nbsp; He jerked his fingers out and quickly slapped the under side of one of her breasts.&nbsp; Before she could cry out, his fingers were in her mouth again, deep, pressing down her tongue, forcing her head back and forth, nearly choking her.&nbsp; Claudia was licking her furiously, lapping her, sucking her.&nbsp; Ayla's breasts where forced up as her arms were bound folded underneath.&nbsp; She was so close to orgasm.&nbsp; They did not give her time.&nbsp; Boom, she was over again and Julian's cock was in her mouth.&nbsp; Claudia was humping her from behind, with her hands reaching around to grasp Ayla's breasts, hard.&nbsp; Again, Julian did not cum.&nbsp; What was he, some sort of tantric sex guru?!&nbsp; Claudia released her red and throbbing tits and started spanking her ass, each blow ramming Julian's cock back into her mouth.&nbsp; Claudia switched to finger fucking her, two fingers in her cunt, pumping and twisting.&nbsp; Ayla was��awash in sensations unlike ever before.&nbsp; Pain and pleasure a jumbled mix in her head.&nbsp; She was dragged off of his cock again, left panting on her side.&nbsp; Her legs were together now, knees bent.&nbsp; She could feel someone's hand resting on the high curve of her hip, it felt like Claudia's.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They let her lay there for a few moments, panting and gasping.&nbsp;&nbsp; She was not alone in that.&nbsp; Then they dragged her off of the bed by her arms.&nbsp; She was moved, not far, to the floor and made to kneel on a low, padded platform of some sort.&nbsp; She was kneeling high, church pew style, but with her knees spread��and then buckled to the device.&nbsp; Both of her ankles and high on her calves, right below the knees, were strapped down.&nbsp; Harness straps were added to her upper body, they ran like a sideways H in front, above, below and between her breasts.&nbsp; The straps went around her arms, securing them even more tightly to her torso.&nbsp; Connected cuffs where buckled to her upper arms as well.&nbsp; She tried to shift and twist in her bonds, she always did, but she was held firm.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Claudia kissed her again, softly this time.&nbsp; Then Ayla heard her Mistress's breathy whisper, "You did well Ayla.&nbsp; We are pleased."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla parted her lips, unsure weather to speak, to thank her, when she felt the gag pressed into her mouth.&nbsp; It was big, filling.&nbsp; Firm but not too hard, it was shaped like a large doorknob, the shaft was attached to a wide leather panel the covered her lower face.&nbsp; She couldn't help but give a muffled squeal of protest and alarm.&nbsp; It was a harness gag and even though she could see nothing she felt it being strapped and buckled about her head as, no doubt Julian, tightened it.&nbsp; She had bridled many a horse, and felt like one now.&nbsp; Straps ran up both side of her nose to meet at her forehead.&nbsp; At least two ran around the sides to the back of her head and another buckled under her chin.&nbsp; Blind and mute, her nostrils flared in fear.&nbsp; They were not finished.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was pushed down and forward and she heard the click of a locking snap at her collar.&nbsp; She was fastened by the neck to the platform, leaning far over, inches from the floor.&nbsp; A few more clicks and she felt more straps attached to her body harness, securing her further to the floor.&nbsp; These straps angled off to either side.&nbsp; Then they shoved a dildo up her cunt.&nbsp; She cried out in surprise but nothing was heard but faint distressed mumbling.&nbsp; The dildo was big and ribbed and on the end of a rod.&nbsp; The rod was then fitted into a hole in the platform that kept it inserted at the proper angle, stuck deep inside her.&nbsp; She struggled and sobbed, but she could do nothing to free herself of either the bonds or the impalement.&nbsp; Then she heard something that made her freeze, the unmistakable sound of goop being squeezed out of a tube.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"But I was good!&nbsp; I was good!" she tried to scream.&nbsp; It was nothing but more incoherent gag speak.&nbsp; They didn&#8217;t need to spread her ass cheeks much more then they already were.&nbsp; She felt�..whatever it was�..pressing against her anus.&nbsp; She was held fast, God how she wanted to struggle.&nbsp; She shook her head, she moaned, her body twisted some�.but her ass was an immobile target.&nbsp; The second invader was a little smaller, and very well lubed.&nbsp; Try as she might, she couldn&#8217;t keep it out.&nbsp; In fact, it slipped in disgustingly easily.&nbsp; It got wider and wider, going in further than she could believe.&nbsp; She felt her ass "pop" as it tightened around the smaller, tapered base of the thing.&nbsp; She groaned.&nbsp; She was had.&nbsp; Mouth full, pussy full, ass full.&nbsp; Blindfolded and gagged.&nbsp; They were not�.quite�..finished.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Claudia pinched Ayla's nipples; she twisted and yanked on them.&nbsp; When she was satisfied that they were nice and firm, sticking out as they had been on the bed, she attached strong clamps to them.&nbsp; Ayla screamed quietly.&nbsp; Then Claudia added the weights.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They left her there and went back to the bed.&nbsp; Julian and Claudia made love.&nbsp; Ayla heard them.&nbsp; She heard her moaning and she heard him gasping with pleasure.&nbsp; They, of course heard her moans of discomfort as well, her gagged whimpering.&nbsp; They got off on it.&nbsp; Julian came and Claudia came again.&nbsp; The weights hanging from Ayla's nipples swayed.&nbsp; They finally fell asleep.&nbsp; Ayla did not.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her joints ached.&nbsp; Her arms were almost numb.&nbsp; Her ass and her pussy hurt.&nbsp; Her tits hurt.&nbsp; She stopped trying to beg some time ago.&nbsp; It seemed to be nothing but music to their ears.&nbsp; She was still wet.&nbsp; Occasionally she mustered a little strength to struggle again, but she knew she wasn&#8217;t going anywhere.&nbsp; Sadly, the dildo wasn&#8217;t even rubbing her clit.&nbsp; Finally, much later that night, crying, with one last fit of struggle, Ayla came.&nbsp; She came hard.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Future Shocked, part 8
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By Ayla Jaxxon

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Warm sun, warm breezes, the smell of flowers, there are reasons why people love tropical isles.&nbsp; Even when they are chained, leashed and naked, to a post.&nbsp; Ayla rolled over to her back stiffly.&nbsp; She was back out by the pool.&nbsp; She was still a little sore, never the less, she sighed drowsily.&nbsp; Whatever fantasies she may have had in her former life about sex and bondage, they were surpassed last night.&nbsp; Prolonged bondage is not comfortable, but it was�.something.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They had released her this morning, early.&nbsp; She hadn't heard them get up; she must have gotten at least some sleep.&nbsp; They removed the ass plug first, then the dildo, then the straps, the nipple clamps and the arm binder.&nbsp; The gag and blindfold came off lastly, she remembered blinking in the bright morning sun.&nbsp; It took a few moments before she could see either of them.&nbsp; Her joints screamed as they helped her to a nearby cushion, a round cushion that looked like a dog bed to Ayla.&nbsp; Not that she cared at this point.&nbsp; They even let her lay there, curled up, for a bit.&nbsp;&nbsp; Then they snapped on her regular cuffs, belt and collar by hand.&nbsp; She was�.fed and watered�..and "walked"�..and brought back out here.&nbsp; Julian even said, "You may rest this morning, Ayla.&nbsp; This afternoon, forty laps."&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her owners had kissed before Claudia went to the lab.&nbsp; Julian called her a "workaholic" and smiled.&nbsp; He worked out on the deck, Ayla watched.&nbsp; He was wearing hakama pants, bare chest, bare feet.&nbsp; He was a muscular son of a bitch.&nbsp; He did kata.&nbsp; Ayla had been around martial artists quite a bit, her brother was a black belt, but she did not recognize this style.&nbsp; He did some flowing, kung fu like motions but most were short, quick and very serious looking.&nbsp; She knew by watching that he could kill her with his bare hands.&nbsp; Unless she got lucky with her big frickin' stick again, she would not stand a chance fighting him.&nbsp; Did he show her this on purpose?&nbsp; Surely he knew she was watching.&nbsp; Was this a warning?&nbsp; No, she thought, he knows I'm already helpless here.&nbsp; He doesn&#8217;t even consider me a potential threat.&nbsp; She found herself contemplating the possibility that she was not leaving here.&nbsp; That she was a slave for life.&nbsp; She shook her head to clear the thoughts of growing despair, and worse than that, conflicted feelings!&nbsp; Did she even WANT to escape?!&nbsp; Yes!&nbsp; Of course she did!&nbsp; She didn't want to be a slave!&nbsp; There has to be hope for a normal life!&nbsp; I WILL get away.&nbsp; I WILL be free again.&nbsp; She had then rolled away from him, moping.&nbsp; Eventually she fell asleep.&nbsp; That must have been several hours ago.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; "Time for your swim, non."&nbsp; Julian was back in his normal "island casual" attire.&nbsp; The sun was high.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Waking quickly, Ayla replied with a, "Yes Master."&nbsp; It was becoming automatic.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla was surprised that he let her jump in to the pool herself.&nbsp; She was even more surprised that he let her rest, really rest, after twenty laps.&nbsp; "There must be something wrong with him." She thought sardonically as she started the next round of swimming.&nbsp; But afterwards, he made her suck his dick so she figured everything was back to normal.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He didn't even do that "last forever" thing.&nbsp; He just dragged her over to her post, leashed her, got a funny look in his eye and ordered her to service him.&nbsp; She was only a little taken aback as she nodded nervously and started to open her mouth.&nbsp; She was very tired from the pool, unable mentally or physically to protest. He didn&#8217;t give her time for any other reaction anyway.&nbsp; He was stiff, she was his slave.&nbsp; He fucked her mouth hard, gagging and choking her as she struggled feebly. Then he tossed her aside and left her gasping, dripping wet in the sun.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That night, she was taken back to her cell in the lab to sleep.&nbsp; She was almost disappointed as they left her there.&nbsp; She really WAS conflicted.&nbsp; Any reasonable person would be��what?&nbsp; Terrified?&nbsp; Angry?&nbsp; She wasn't really sure how to feel.&nbsp; What were they doing to her?&nbsp; She sank to her knees, grabbing her own hair in her fists and making a guttural scream of frustration.&nbsp; Was she really so submissive, after all, that she had fallen right into being an obedient little slave girl?&nbsp; She was irritated with herself and with her situation.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sniffing and pushing the hair out of her face, she slowly stood and made her way to her bed.&nbsp; With a sigh, she watched the lights of the lab dim automatically.&nbsp; Unable to sleep, she studied Roman history late into the night.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The pool-side post seemed to be her new daytime spot.&nbsp; That's where Julian put her again the next morning.&nbsp; After his katas and a refreshing dip, he retrieved her leash and pulled her to her feet.&nbsp; "Let's go for a run, slave."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She got out a "Yes, Mas�" before he started up the path into the trees at a steady run.&nbsp; She had to keep up, his swinging arms jerked her leash if she lagged.&nbsp; They both ran barefoot; he was wearing shorts and the bracelet that was her newly designed cuff remote.&nbsp;&nbsp; She of course was naked and bouncing painfully again.&nbsp; The trail was made mostly of soft, sandy soil.&nbsp; Had she not been worried about staying with him, she would have loved hiking this picturesque rain forest path. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Making a break for it did not seem wise�.she thought about it�.but he was obviously faster than she and did not seem the least bit winded.&nbsp; She was soon gasping; most of the trail so far had been uphill.&nbsp;&nbsp; She was truly gratified to see that he was, in fact, breathing heavily and sweating when they paused at the top of the rise.&nbsp; It was particularly stunning up here.&nbsp; There was a clearing, a lookout.&nbsp; They could see forest below with swarms of butterflies above the canopy.&nbsp; Beyond that she saw the beach, and the blue, blue ocean.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla gazed out over the spectacular scene.&nbsp; "It's so beautiful!" she cried.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes, beautiful indeed." He answered.&nbsp; And it was only a moment until Ayla turned to see that he was looking at her when he said it.&nbsp; She blushed.&nbsp; She actually blushed.&nbsp; Then she got embarrassed for being embarrassed.&nbsp; Then she was appalled at herself, her frustration rising.&nbsp; She turned quickly to look back out over the vista.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Julian laughed.&nbsp; "A modest slave.&nbsp; How quaint.&nbsp; Turn around."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She turned back towards him, keeping her eyes downcast at first.&nbsp; She slowly raised her face to meet his gaze.&nbsp; Ayla kept her face as impassive as possible.&nbsp; Inside, she was churning.&nbsp; She was drawn and repelled at the same time.&nbsp; Resentment started to win out.&nbsp; Her nostrils were still flaring a bit, catching her breath from the run.&nbsp; She locked eyes with him for a second too long�..of all the emotions she felt she was hiding, the one that flashed across her face for just the briefest of instants, was defiance.&nbsp; In her mind, she was still free, still rebellious, even if only for a moment.&nbsp; It did not last long.&nbsp; Before she saw the corner of his lip curl into the tiniest of smiles, she knew he has seen it.&nbsp; Before one of his eyebrows raised in the slightest, she knew.&nbsp;&nbsp; The next emotion she felt was not hidden, her face showed it immediately.&nbsp; Her eyes widened, her lips parted.&nbsp; She feared.&nbsp; Rebellion was not something this man was going to take lightly.&nbsp; "Oh Master, I'm sorry!&nbsp; Forgive me!"&nbsp; She started to sink to her knees.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He stopped her, and yanked her back up by the leash.&nbsp; "No need for apologies, little slave, I love your spirit." He reached over and grabbed a handful of her hair, twisting her head back painfully.&nbsp; "It makes me want to fuck you all the more."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She found herself squeaking out a "Yes, Master�." When he turned and, pulling her bent over by the hair, walked briskly across the clearing.&nbsp; He found what he was looking for.&nbsp; Maybe he knew exactly where it was, having used it before, she didn't know.&nbsp; He dragged her to a tree.&nbsp; It wasn't a big tree, about the diameter of a coffee can, and it forked dramatically at about waist height.&nbsp; It had smooth gray bark.&nbsp; Ayla noticed the bark; she was getting a real close look at it.&nbsp; He roughly pushed her head through the Y of the tree and pressed her collared throat down onto it.&nbsp; Her leather, or leather-like, leash was about six feet long and he wrapped it around the trunk and back through it's self, pinning her there.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla started crying, blubbering really.&nbsp; She couldn't help herself�.it wasn't even as though she were all that scared.&nbsp; Hell, she was getting used to being tied and abused.&nbsp; Alright, not used to it�..but expecting it.&nbsp; Still, she heard the words pouring out of her mouth, "Please Master! I'm sorry Master!&nbsp; Please forgive me Master!"&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He grabbed her wrists and brought them together around the tree trunk, right below her face.&nbsp; With a few wraps of the leash, he tied them there, palms together.&nbsp; Then he walked around behind the girl.&nbsp; "Spread you legs, slave."&nbsp; Whimpering, she did so.&nbsp; "Wider."&nbsp; Of course, she complied.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He fucked her.&nbsp; He fucked her hard, ramming into her, slapping her ass as it did it.&nbsp; She felt her shoulders pounding into the tree with each thrust.&nbsp; This was a dominance fuck.&nbsp; The meaning was not lost on the terrified girl.&nbsp; He was exhibiting his power over her, his control.&nbsp; And he enjoyed it.&nbsp; He spanked her harder as he fucked her.&nbsp; She continued to cry, but oddly, never once thought to move her legs, even though nothing physical held them there.&nbsp; She was paying for her brief look of insolence.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He came with a groan and withdrew from her, wiping his dick on her ass before he tucked himself back in his shorts.&nbsp; He untied her from the tree and yanked her stumbling body back to the clearing.&nbsp; There, with a touch of his bracelet remote, he cuffed her hands wrists crossed behind her back.&nbsp; There she stood, slumped over, feet apart for balance, her head down, cuffed.&nbsp; She felt like a whipped dog.&nbsp; She really did.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Again, he pulled her head back by the hair.&nbsp; Then he took the leash and wrapped it around her head, forcing it between her teeth tightly and passed it through itself again.&nbsp; Now the leash point was the side of her face, and she was cleave-gagged by it.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Let's continue our run, shall we?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was shaking, her eyes wide.&nbsp; She made a tiny pitiful sound of protest.&nbsp; He turned and started jogging down the trail.&nbsp; It was miserable, humiliating and painful.&nbsp; She stumbled along gracelessly, her arms bound, her balance impaired.&nbsp; Each jerk of the leash snapped her head to the side and forced it deeper into her mouth, cutting into her cheeks.&nbsp; He jerked the leash often. She ran bent over, faltering behind.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Finally, they returned to the house.&nbsp; Ayla was almost too exhausted to be relieved.&nbsp; She staggered as he dragged her at last to her pool-side post, dropping to her knees beside it.&nbsp; Julian made another turn of the leash around her head, again, passing it under itself and cinching it firmly before attaching the handle to the post.&nbsp; She groaned through the gag.&nbsp; Julian pushed her over onto her cushion and locked her ankle cuffs together, no space between them.&nbsp; She heard the whizzing of the magnetic cables as the wrist cuffs attached to the ankle ones�.and felt her legs being drawn up into a strict hogtie.&nbsp; She lay there on her side, her back arched, her chest heaving, her face red and tear streaked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Good run, Ayla." he said, smiling.&nbsp; He looked at her considering.&nbsp; "And here's your reward."&nbsp; As it turned out, he had an "O" button too.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!" Her eyes rolled back in her head as the nanobots sent arousal inducing chemicals screaming through her brain.&nbsp; Her head thrashed back and forth.&nbsp; He pressed it again.&nbsp; She screamed again.&nbsp; She was losing control.&nbsp; She didn't know what she was doing.&nbsp; Her body jerked and twisted.&nbsp; She fought the bindings; she bit down viciously on the straps in her teeth.&nbsp; Her arousal was building like a contained explosion.&nbsp; He pressed it again.&nbsp; She was writhing, there's really no other word for it.&nbsp; She cried with incoherent, breathy, piteous screams.&nbsp; He pressed it again.&nbsp; "Aaaaaagggggg!"&nbsp; Then he touched her.&nbsp; He forced her thighs apart and literally just stuck his fingers into her, curling them up inside her and vibrating them.&nbsp; She came immediately.&nbsp; Screaming.&nbsp; Thrashing.&nbsp; It didn't stop.&nbsp; She kept coming.&nbsp; Over and over and over.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After forever, after she returned to her body, after the chemicals in her brain subsided, he withdrew his hand.&nbsp; She lay there panting, gasping, still hogtied, the leash still cutting into her cheeks.&nbsp; And that's how he left her, overcome, literally.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hours later, when he returned, Claudia was with him.&nbsp; She unwound the saliva soaked leash from her head.&nbsp; "Honestly Julian, you just about cut off the circulation."&nbsp; He shrugged in response.&nbsp; Ayla was visibly shaken.&nbsp; She was having trouble coming back to herself.&nbsp; It's one thing to think that you are helpless; it's another to KNOW it.&nbsp; He had almost fucked the resistance out of her.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well," she continued, "I'll take her down and get her cleaned up, she's a mess."&nbsp; She released the hogtieing cables and the cuff attachments.&nbsp; She retrieved the leash and motioned for the girl to heel, crawling.&nbsp; "And, I want her in bed with us tonight.&nbsp; You know she'll need some time to stretch before that.&nbsp; I want to try the gear that Roland made for us."&nbsp; She walked off towards the house.&nbsp; Ayla, on her hands and knees, heeled.&nbsp; She didn't even think about what gear Roland may had made.&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla was taken to the lab, put in the slave shower, and then returned to her cell.&nbsp; Left alone, she eventually started to feel like herself again.&nbsp; She tilted her head back and closed her eyes, "I am so fucked."&nbsp; She spent the rest of the afternoon pacing and napping.&nbsp; She made a point of NOT reading about ancient Roman history.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That night, they came back for her.&nbsp; She was so desperate to prove to herself that she was not completely broken, that she did not drop to her knees immediately as they entered the lab.&nbsp; Claudia smiled.&nbsp; "I was wondering, slave, just how your attitude would be tonight.&nbsp; You bounce back quickly.&nbsp; I like that.&nbsp; Now kneel."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla took the time for one deep breath, and then complied.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Good girl."&nbsp; Claudia cuffed her, wrists crossed in front, leashed her and led her out.&nbsp; It seemed like Julian was just there for back up.&nbsp; The thought of that made Ayla smile inwardly.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Upstairs and back in the bedroom, Ayla saw the pile of black leather items on the bed and slumped.&nbsp; It was going to be another long night.&nbsp; They stood her in the middle of the floor and started to work.&nbsp; Claudia buckled straps around her upper thighs, high up and rather loose, one for each side.&nbsp; She held them in place while Julian remotely unlocked her wrist cuffs, only to attach them to each thigh cuff.&nbsp; Her hands were now bound to her sides.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Claudia was obviously pleased, "Oh good, the attachment points I send to Roland are working perfectly."&nbsp; The thigh straps were now pulled up hard from Ayla's crotch to her wrists, following the Y fold of her body.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Claudia was even more pleased with the new collar.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Look dear; see how he made a groove on the inside that corresponds with her tech collar?&nbsp; No need to remove it to add this one!"&nbsp; The new collar was severe, a posture collar that dipped down to her clavicles and up to the top of her jaw line.&nbsp; Ayla fought panic as Claudia buckled and locked it on her neck.&nbsp; Her eyes darted back and forth in her nearly immobile head.&nbsp; Next, they buckled a wide harness around her body.&nbsp; It was like a corset that went around her arms as well as her waist.&nbsp; Another strap device encircled her upper arms and across her chest, that attached to the corset with a piece wide across her back, but had just a single strap that ran down between her breasts.&nbsp; That dam thing buckled to the bottom of the collar too.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Unreasonable thoughts filled Ayla's mind, "I should have fought this, I should have tried run away this morning, I can't take this, I should fight now!&nbsp; I SHOULD NEVER HAVE GOTTEN INTO THAT DAMNED CAR!!!"&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The saying "Too late now" didn't even begin to cover this situation.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then Julian strapped her thighs together, right above her knees.&nbsp; Ayla moaned and flapped her free hands ineffectually.&nbsp; They walked the hobbling girl to the bed and let her fall backwards onto it.&nbsp; She squealed as she went down.&nbsp; Julian held her lower legs up as Claudia slipped a single sleeve over them.&nbsp; The sleeve was stiff and boot-like.&nbsp; Ayla's feet were forced into a brutal ballet point.&nbsp; There was no heel, this was a single piece and it held her feet together so hard, it bruised her ankle bones.&nbsp; It buckled in several places up her leg, and the last was tight above her calf.&nbsp; There was a single heavy steel ring at the toe.&nbsp; More straps buckled this to her corset�.everything was connected from her neck to her feet.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Julian propped her up in a half sitting position.&nbsp; That's when she saw Claudia holding a black leather hood.&nbsp; Ayla gave a strangled cry of fear.&nbsp; She tried to struggle, and even managed to twist away for a second.&nbsp; Julian just yanked her back into position with a chuckle.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Hold her hair back, dear." said Claudia.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No!&nbsp; Oh my God!&nbsp; Please no!"&nbsp; Ayla's cries were hindered buy the jaw tight collar.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Julian nodded and twisted Ayla's hair into a ponytail as Claudia worked the hood over the girls head.&nbsp; Again, Ayla's world went black, with the girl wailing in fear the whole time.&nbsp; Claudia and Julian worked together to fit the hood to her head.&nbsp; It was tight.&nbsp; Ayla immediately felt like she was suffocating.&nbsp; She could barely control her panic.&nbsp; Claudia used some sort of tool to pop rubber tubes far up into Ayla's nostrils.&nbsp; These tubes were attached to the hood, and the only holes.&nbsp; Ayla felt them buckle the thing down the back of her head.&nbsp; It was surreal, the most confined that she had ever felt in her life.&nbsp; More straps buckled around the outside.&nbsp; One wide one went over her mouth, over the whole lower part of her face really, curving under her chin to just under the nose holes.&nbsp; She could not open her mouth at all.&nbsp; Another padded piece was buckled over her eyes, and although she was already blind, the added pressure just made her feel even more helpless, more frightened.&nbsp; Of course, the hood buckled to the posture collar as well.&nbsp; Ayla felt like she was going to pass out.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hooded as she was, Ayla could barely hear Claudia, but she did make out the words, "She's so beautiful�."&nbsp; The words distracted the mummified girl.&nbsp; It gave her a moment to calm herself, to think.&nbsp; It did not strike Ayla as odd that someone would find her situation beautiful.&nbsp; In fact, it was strangely comforting.&nbsp; Perhaps THAT was odd.&nbsp; She was almost able to accept what was happening to her.&nbsp; And then she realized, again, that her acceptance wasn&#8217;t really necessary.&nbsp; What would happen to her was inevitable.&nbsp; Right now, tonight, she was blind and mute and restrained.&nbsp; And she would survive.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;These thoughts were interrupted when Julian let her fall back onto the bed.&nbsp; They pulled her up and moved her around.&nbsp; She couldn't tell that they had moved her to the middle of the huge bed.&nbsp; Also, she had not seen the steel ring that was fastened to the top of her hood.&nbsp; Claudia snapped a chained clip to that ring.&nbsp; The short chain was fixed to the wall at the head of the bed.&nbsp; At the other end, Julian jerked Ayla down until the chain was taut and then attached a second clip to the toe ring.&nbsp; Ayla was strung tightly between the two.&nbsp; Her head, and much of her body, was cover in tight, black leather.&nbsp; Her breasts, large as they were, hung widely.&nbsp; She was keenly aware that they were free and uncovered.&nbsp; However, she was mostly aware of her hands�..even though her wrists were bound to her thighs, and every struggling tug pulled the straps right on either side of her sex��even then, her hands felt almost free.&nbsp; Maybe it was because she could touch herself, feel the skin of her legs.&nbsp; Maybe it was because the rest of her body was so bound, her other senses impaired so completely.&nbsp; She kept moving her hands, straining, reaching, grasping at nothing.&nbsp; She made fists of frustration, yanking hopelessly at the cuffs.&nbsp; Ultimately, her free hands just made the bondage all the more real, more complete.&nbsp; Her hands were like butterflies trapped in a jar.&nbsp; The desperate sounds she made to accompany these actions were nothing but muffled hums.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Claudia and Julian made love.&nbsp; On her.&nbsp; Julian used her tummy as a pillow while his wife rode him, straddled across his pelvis, bouncing up and down enthusiastically.&nbsp; He rolled his wife over and spun her around so that her hips were propped up on Ayla's bound thighs.&nbsp; Ayla could hear Claudia's loud moans.&nbsp; She could feel the pounding.&nbsp; It seemed to go on forever.&nbsp; Finally, Claudia mounted Ayla's immobile body.&nbsp; She was sitting on her, legs on either side of her hips, leaning over, face to hood covered face.&nbsp; Ayla could not feel Claudia's tongue as the woman licked all the way up the side of her face, but she could feel her breasts being kneaded, squeezed and twisted.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Julian fucked his wife from behind as she tormented the girl's tits.&nbsp; Ayla screamed her stifled screams and bucked and struggled as best she could.&nbsp; It sent Claudia over the edge with mind blowing ecstasy.&nbsp; Julian took his cue and came with a groan as well.&nbsp; He rolled off and Claudia collapsed on Ayla's body, crooning and stroking her leather clad face.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The couple rested there for a while before kissing and nestling in to sleep, one on either side of their slave.&nbsp; Ayla felt Julian's mouth on her left breast for a kiss and a quick suck on her nipple before he lay down with his arm across her body.&nbsp; He fell asleep immediately.&nbsp; Claudia stroked her thighs and her mound for a few moments before she pushed two fingers into the spot where her thighs and sex came together.&nbsp; It was tight.&nbsp; Ayla squirmed as Claudia wormed her fingers in.&nbsp; And that's how they slept for the rest of the night.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 



Epilogue&nbsp; 

Six months later�..

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla was reading one of Julian's books on medicinal plants.&nbsp; He had been using her background in biology to help him identify some new species as well as assist in field collection.&nbsp; He was a doctor, who knew?&nbsp; She was lying on the floor, on her belly, with her face resting on her palms.&nbsp; She was in the house.&nbsp; Claudia was sitting nearby, knitting.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Ayla darling, run down to the market and pick up something for dinner.&nbsp; I'm in the mood for fish."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes Mistress."&nbsp; Ayla got up quickly and stored the electronic book on the shelf.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Claudia continued, "And put on a tunic, dear.&nbsp; You know how Simon gets when you go there naked."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla smiled, "Yes Mistress, he fills the order very slowly."&nbsp; She said the last two words in an exaggeratedly long manner.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I want one pineapple, two pomegranates and goat cheese too."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes, Mistress."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ayla slid a simple white tunic over her head, picked up an over the shoulder pack basket and headed out.&nbsp; The path to the open market wasn't long, about a mile down hill.&nbsp; Ayla enjoyed the walk.&nbsp; She did not dawdle, but she knew she didn't have to "run".&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She fingered the collar around her neck.&nbsp; Mistress had updated it some time ago.&nbsp; It now had satellite GPS tracking, a range inhibiter and three levels of electro muscle inhibiting stun pain inducer �..shocky stuff.&nbsp; They hardly ever had to leash her anymore, they still DID, but they didn't have to.&nbsp; Ayla knew that escape was impossi���highly unlikely.&nbsp; She was a sex slave in Roman Sci-fi world.&nbsp; She was in fucking kick-ass shape.&nbsp; She got tied up a lot.&nbsp; Also, she no longer slept in the lab; Julian had installed a corner cage in the bedroom.&nbsp; It was small but it did have a cushion.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She even, sometimes, occasionally, begrudgingly, was happy.&nbsp; She still had issues with being dubbed a "masochist".&nbsp; It was horribly unfair that her owners could make her cum anytime they wanted to.&nbsp; But, Ayla decided, best to look on the positive side of things whenever possible.&nbsp; And you know what they say�.when in Rome�.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now, how shall I cook Mistress's fish tonight?&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The End






Author's Note

I sure hope anyone that read Future Shocked really enjoyed it!&nbsp; I realize it's painfully obvious that I am no professional writer, but it was sure fun doing it.&nbsp; 50 pages!&nbsp; 
I know the story ends rather abruptly, and it's not like I don't have lots of ideas for the further adventures of Ayla in bondage land�.but the chapters started feeling like "and this is how Ayla gets tied up TODAY!"&nbsp; So this is it for now.&nbsp; I have some different characters in mind for another.&nbsp; 

Ayla's plight has become a pleasurable, and frequently occurring daydream for me�..so in my head she has; been hung by her wrists and dipped in a vat of painful depilatory juice that makes her bare for years. (I know girl's that would do that if it meant never having to wax again), she's spent lots of time in harness as a chariot pulling pony girl (come on, it's Rome-like!)&nbsp; and she's been stolen by another Tarcrete citizen who's a REAL sadistic creep�that was when I was feeling particularly dark�.don't worry, she gets "rescued" by Julian before she gets too maimed.&nbsp; 

Writing is fun and, I think, good for your brain.&nbsp; While writing this, I researched carbon nanotubes (those are real) as well as Roman history (which I never really used) and I found that there is VERY little research done on the physiological nature of female orgasm!&nbsp; You would think that there would be LOTS of people working on that!&nbsp; 

I also got tied up a few times�.for ummmm, research, ya, that's it!&nbsp;&nbsp; 

My special thanks to my Second Life family.&nbsp; This story was inspired by and dedicated to them with my love.&nbsp; I'd also like to thank whoever came up with spell check; this could not have been done without it!!!&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Love,

Ayla Jaxxon&nbsp;
