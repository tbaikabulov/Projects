 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Halloween was always my favorite time of year.&nbsp; Girls got to dress as sluts and guys simply got to enjoy the view.&nbsp; My costume that year wasn&#8217;t all that creative.&nbsp; I was simply going to be a construction worker, I had a jean vest, yellow hard hat, and a tool belt equipped only with an old hammer I had found laying around my house.&nbsp; My friend Bill was having a party that night and it was supposed to be legendary.&nbsp; I showed up around ten that night and the house was already packed.&nbsp; It didn&#8217;t take me long to find Bill and congratulate him on a great party.&nbsp; He was already drunk and having a great time so I looked around for a few other friends.&nbsp; I found Tom outside on the deck, hanging out and talking with a few girls so I came up and introduced myself.&nbsp; Amanda, Lucy, and Kate were the girls Tom was talking too and they all looked spectacular.&nbsp; Amanda was a blonde dressed as a nurse, Lucy a brunette dressed as an army soldier, and Kate was dressed as a dark angel.&nbsp; It was pretty apparent Tom was interested in Lucy, he couldn&#8217;t keep his eyes off her, and so I decided to focus my attention on Amanda and Kate.&nbsp; It was going pretty well as the party progressed, then there friend Kim showed up.&nbsp; Kim was a dark haired Asian girl dressed up in a secretary, nothing special about her outfit.&nbsp; She was quieter than the other two and seemingly put a damper on the mood.&nbsp; I offered to get them all drinks, when Amanda grabbed my hand, 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Get me an extra strong one� she asked.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Sure� I responded, smiling at her.&nbsp; It took me only a few moments to find the bar and pour three mixed drinks.&nbsp; Vodka and soda was all that was there so I poured three quickly, the third with a large amount of vodka.&nbsp; When I returned to the three girls I found Amanda was taken by a new guy who had shown up, leaving just Kate and Kim.&nbsp; I handed them two of the drinks, accidently giving Kim the one with all the vodka.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�This is horrible� she said instantly.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh don&#8217;t be a baby� responded Kate.&nbsp; �It's not that strong, you just don&#8217;t drink that often.&nbsp; Drink up and you&#8217;ll be fine.�&nbsp; Kim didn&#8217;t look happy but she drank up anyway.&nbsp; The night progressed slowly and me and Kate were getting more and more friendly until suddenly Kate looked away, holding her stomach.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I think I&#8217;m going to be sick� she muttered as she darted away.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t want to see her throw up so I turned away.&nbsp; I thought Kim would follow but she remained leaning against the rail.&nbsp; She had been quiet for awhile now.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Are you ok?� I asked.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Ya� she responded with a giggle.&nbsp; She was hammered I realized as she stood up, no longer resting on the rail and began to sway.&nbsp; �I have never been drunk before� she whispered to me, leaning in close.&nbsp;&nbsp; It wasn&#8217;t until that moment that I really looked at her.&nbsp; Before my attention had been on just her friends with but her close, I realized she was good looking.&nbsp; Long black hair, a beautiful smile.&nbsp; The problem was her secretary outfit did more to hide her body than show it off.&nbsp; I wanted to see more of her I realized.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�So how come you&#8217;re not dressed like your friends?� I asked, not sure how she would respond.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Me?� she responded.&nbsp; �I could never dress like that.&nbsp; I could never show so much skin.�&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Why not?&nbsp; Why don&#8217;t you take off your jacket?� I questioned her.&nbsp; She was drunk so I figured why not.&nbsp; She rose to the challenge magnificently.&nbsp; Without hesitation she undid her jacket and put it on the railing.&nbsp; She stood there with a white blouse, clinging to her tight figure.&nbsp; Her long black skirt clung to her legs and without her jacket I realized she had a great body.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�How bout that?� she asked, meeting me wandering eyes.&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t resist and pulled my phone out of my pocket and snapped a quick picture of her.&nbsp; �What was that?� she asked, stumbling over too me.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Just texting my friend� I said, lying shamelessly to her.&nbsp; �Why don&#8217;t we head inside and sit down?� I offered, wrapping my arm around her waist.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Sure� she said, leaning her head on my shoulder.&nbsp; Alcohol was clearly getting the best of her as she allowed me to lead her into the house.&nbsp; I&#8217;d been to Bill&#8217;s house before, so I steered us to a small room on the side of the house.&nbsp; He normally smoked a hookah there but during parties kept it closed so I knew we would be alone.&nbsp; Together we stumbled in the room and I shut the door.&nbsp; �It's hot in here� Kim said, sitting down on the couch.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Why don&#8217;t you take your shirt off then� I responded sarcastically, sitting down on the chair across from her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good idea� she slurred, reaching up to begin unbuttoning her blouse.&nbsp; This was the last thing I had expected but I wasn&#8217;t going to stop her, so I sat back and watched the show.&nbsp; It took her awhile since she was extremely drunk but in the end her shirt ended up next to her on the couch and she leaned back wearing a beautiful black lace bra and her long skirt.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You should take the skirt off too� I suggested, hoping for the best.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Ya� and was a struggle Kim rose from the couch and reached behind herself, unzipping the black skirt.&nbsp; She raised her hands and let the skirt fall to the ground.&nbsp; Before me stood one of the most beautiful girls I had ever seen.&nbsp; Long black hair fell across her shoulder, small breasts were supported by a black bra, lace contrasting her pale skin, and her panties matched the bra, wrapped tightly to her ass with lace on the edges.&nbsp; �What do you think?� she asked, trying to pose.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You look great� I answered truthfully, my eyes wandered up and down her body.&nbsp; I slipped my phone out of my pocket again and began taking pictures.&nbsp; This time she didn&#8217;t seem to mind, but instead posed.&nbsp; Again and again the camera flashed, each time a new angle of her body.&nbsp; �You should take the bra off too� I offered.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No,� she responded quickly.&nbsp; �Then I&#8217;d almost be naked.�&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Just cover yourself with your arms, that way you still covered� I told her.&nbsp; �Please� I said, stepping close to her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Ok� she whispered meekly.&nbsp; One hand went up to cover her chest while the other reached behind her body and undid the bra.&nbsp; It too fell to the floor besides her skirt.&nbsp; Once done she raised her second arm as well and covered her chest, making sure it was well hidden.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Smile� I said, taking a close up of her face with the camera.&nbsp; A few more pictures and she had relaxed again.&nbsp; �Why don&#8217;t you hold up your hair so it doesn&#8217;t block you face?&nbsp; She complied and I knew I could get her to move her other arm soon.&nbsp; After a few more pictures, she did without me even asking and I loved the view.&nbsp; Her perky little nipples stood at attention and she showed them off proudly now.&nbsp; My phone was nearing the limit of its pictures so I took one last full body picture of her topless and smiled.&nbsp; I stepped in closer to her now and held her in my arms.&nbsp; Her body practically molded too me.&nbsp; My dick strained against my pants and I wanted to fuck her so badly.&nbsp; I leaned into kiss her when suddenly the door opened and two drunken people fell through the door.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�The cops are here� one of them shouted as they lay on the ground.&nbsp; �We have to hide� I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d ever seen a drunk person sober up as fast as Kim did in that moment.&nbsp; One moment she was more than willing, half naked in my arms and the next she was grabbing her clothes and disappearing through the door, leaving me speechless.&nbsp; Knowing the cops were here, I calmly walked out the door and into the backyard.&nbsp; I was twenty one so it didn&#8217;t matter but I still didn&#8217;t want to chance anything.&nbsp; The backyard was clear so I walked onto the street and called a friend.&nbsp; It didn&#8217;t take me long to find a ride and another party, but nothing that followed compared with Kim.


 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The next day I was dragged awake as the clattering of dishes in the kitchen woke me from my slumber.&nbsp; I rose slowly and looked around, my phone caught my attention and the first thing I did was begin looking through my text messages, making sure I hadn&#8217;t sent out anything inappropriate.&nbsp; It only took me a few moments of thumbing through my phone to remember Kim and I quickly opened my pictures.&nbsp; I sat back as I began to click through them one by one, each one showing a beautiful girl undressing.&nbsp; Halloween night was the first night I had met Kim and with these pictures I wouldn&#8217;t be forgetting her anytime soon.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My day wasn&#8217;t anything special except for the hangover that followed Halloween; I just enjoyed hearing all my friends&#8217; stories of what they did, or what other people said they did.&nbsp; I kept the story of Kim and I to myself, instead exaggerating the tale of my escape from the police.&nbsp; The next week followed much of the same routine, school and school work.&nbsp; I was looking forward to the weekend when my roommate came to my room, interrupting my homework.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Ben, some girls here for you.&nbsp; She&#8217;s waiting down stairs.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Thanks� I said, closing my homework and heading downstairs.&nbsp; To my shock Kim stood there, fidgeting in the middle of the living room.&nbsp; �Hey� I said hesitantly, not expecting to have seen Kim again.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�We need to talk� Kim said immediately, clearly upset about something.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Sure, let&#8217;s head up to my room� I offered.&nbsp; I turned and moved back up the stairs with Kim following.&nbsp; I got in my room and shut the door after Kim walked in.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Do you remember what happened on Halloween?� Kim asked quickly, probably afraid of the answer.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Ya� I responded, a smiling on my face.&nbsp; Kim&#8217;s pale face turned beet red instantly, apparently she remembered that night as well.&nbsp; �Why� I questioned.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Do you still have those photos?� She asked, lips quivering.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes� I answered, starring her straight in the face.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You have to delete them,� she practically screamed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What?� she gasped.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m not going to delete them, it&#8217;s very simple.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You have too!� She screamed.&nbsp; �You have to delete them� Throwing her fists she fit me in the chest.&nbsp; It was a pathetic attempt at intimidation, so I smiled while she was in agony over this. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I don&#8217;t have to do anything� I stated again, grabbing her fist that hit my chest.&nbsp; �But you have to do something.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What? I don&#8217;t have to do anything.&nbsp; You&#8217;re going to delete those pictures you bastard!�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That&#8217;s where you wrong,� I replied.&nbsp; This time though I grabbed her hair and forced her against the wall of my room.&nbsp; Very quietly I looked her in the eye, �What&#8217;s going to happen is very simple.&nbsp; I was going to leave those pictures on my phone and just look at them occasionally, but nothing else with them.&nbsp; Now though, you&#8217;ve pissed me off.&nbsp; If you don&#8217;t want me to send those pictures to every one of your friends you&#8217;re going to do exactly what I say, when I say it.&nbsp; Understand me, bitch?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Shock filled her face as the realization of what I just said sunk into her mind.&nbsp; A guy she had met once had control of her life from that moment forward; those pictures could ruin her plan for the rest of her life.
