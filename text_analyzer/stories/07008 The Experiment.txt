The Experiment

Synopsis: Liz Bradley agrees to take part in an experiment, little knowing how it would change her, and her life 






The contract was written plainly, clearly, and with no hidden small print.

Liz Bradley agreed to take part in the experiment for a large sun of money. If she signed it, she would be given a single injection, and once done, the process would start, and could not be stopped. She would spend a month at Pyro-Tech&#8217;s research lab, being monitored for any changes or side effects, and after that she would be free to go, unless something had happened that warranted further research.

It was plainly written, so she could not blame hidden small print at some later stage of the proceedings.

What was not told to her, was the nature or origin of the sample cell they were injecting her with. Only two men knew of its origin, and neither was saying anything. All that Liz had been told, was that it was a new research, and that the scientists were not sure of its use, if any, and any side effects that would appear. It was because of this, the lack of knowledge, that she had been paid such a high amount.

Liz had undergone four separate medical examinations, and at least half a dozen psychological examinations to ensure that she was totally fit physically and mentally, before the experiment began. During her month at the research lab, she would be tested four more times, and monitored twenty four hours a day.

Liz read the document for the third time, and then picked up the pen and signed it. For the next month, at least, she was the property of Pyro-Tech.

The cell sample had been injected into her arm, and all they could do then, was watch and wait. Non-one was even sure that the cell would live in a human body, it may simply die, failing to marry with any of the subjects own cells. If that happened, it was back to the drawing board. But if it did marry, then they would learn much about it&#8217;s origins, they hoped.

The cell was one of three found on a meteor. Three living but separate cells, organic, but with no typical DNA that they had been able to couple with anything on Earth. Whatever the cells were, they were not of this planet.

They had tested one of the cells in the lab, done everything they could do in a lab environment, but had made no discoveries from it. It did seem impervious to heat and cold. They had exposed it to both extremes, and still it lived. Though life was simply sitting in a petrie dish and mocking the scientists.

Mallow had originally come up with the idea of testing it on a human. But he also said that the human could not be told where the cell came from, or they would get no volunteers. Together, Mallows and Stevens began to look for likely test subjects. Of the thirty that they approached, over half said no when they heard that the two scientists had no idea what the effects would be. Of the other fifteen, only five were considered suitable, of which one was Liz Bradley.

What appealed to them about her was that on her application form it said there were no living relatives, and no boyfriend or husband. So it something went drastically wrong, there would be no-one to reproach them. She was ideal, and after several medical and psychiatric tests, they deemed her ideal.

The money had been paid into her account the night before, just after signing the contract, and she was allowed to check with her bank that it was there. Only then was she given the injection. From here on, it was wait and watch, and take notes.

Liz sat in the research lab waiting to be let out. For a month she had been watched, studied, weighed and inspected, but nothing had happened. Nothing at all. 

Mallows had checked regularly on the cell they had injected, through a powerful microscope, but it had done nothing, it hadn&#8217;t moved a millimetre from where it was injected, laying totally inert. Mallows knew he could remove the cell, but saw no pointing doing so. It had been a simple matter to inject her with it, but getting it back out would take a medical team, and that would mean admitting to someone what they had done. Mallows and Stevens both knew that their research was against moral law, and as the cell was doing nothing, there was no need to inform anyone about it. The woman had been paid, and was obviously not complaining. 

Reluctantly, Mallows approached Liz and told them she would be sent home later that afternoon, and thanked her for her time. He did say that if anything happened within the next month, to call and let them know, but he now had serious doubts anything would.

That evening, Liz was once more sat in the comfort of her own home, the first time she had slept in anything but a cot for a full month.

What Mallows, and indeed Liz herself had not taken note of, was that she was now seriously late with her period. She had been due two weeks earlier, but she had no menstruated at all.

Mallows never gave it a thought, and Liz just guessed that it was the stress of being held in the lab all that time. it would sort itself out soon enough. She knew she couldn&#8217;t be pregnant,&nbsp; because at the age of nineteen, she was proud to still be able to call herself a virgin.

In truth, the absence of the period was welcomed by her, as she usually had severe pains on the first two days, and it was a blessed relief that she had not undergone that yet.

For the next few months Liz&#8217;s life went on as it had before the experiment had taken place, but with the exception of no periods. Worried, she had contacted a family planning centre and told them that she had missed three periods, but had never had sex.

After an examination, the clinic concurred that Liz was, indeed, still virginal. Her hymen was still intact. Nor could they discover an embryo hiding in her womb. At a loss for other explanations, the clinic told her that it does sometimes happen that a girl stops menstruating for a time in her late teens. This, of course, was a lie, but they had no other explanation, and it did sound plausible.

It was during the fourth month that Liz began to notice small changes. Her skin, never dark to start with, seemed a little lighter than usual, and her bra seemed to feel a little tighter. She guessed she was putting weight on, but the scales didn&#8217;t agree. In fact, she had lost three pounds since she had entered the research lab. Looking at herself in the full length mirror, she thought she looked good for it, and decided her breasts had perhaps grown a cup size, and simply bought a couple of new bras.

A month later, and these bras also seemed a little tight, and as Liz looked at them in the mirror, they seemed a little larger, but still firm. In fact, firmer than they had ever been. Firm enough not to even need a bra. And her waist line? Was she losing weight?

Climbing on the scales she was a little disappointed to see she weighed the same as she did the previous month, but her waist definitely looked slimmer. Perhaps this was why her jeans had seemed a little loose, but Liz had been putting that down to them stretching slightly after being worn and washed.

It was during the next month that nature caught up with Liz, and her period started. Her stomach ached like never before, as if someone had driven a red hot poker into her, and was twisting it around. The blood seemed to flow incessantly for a week, before finally slowing down, and stopping altogether. The difference this time, was that she was in agony for the whole of her period, something she had never experienced before, and never wanted to do again.

Now. Almost six months after she had been given the injection, the only differences where her trimmer waist, and her larger, firmer breasts. But she decided to call Mallows and let him know, to see if there was any connection. Ringing Pyro-Tech, she was sadly informed that Doctor Mallows had died with his assistant in a lab fire just over a week ago.

Liz couldn&#8217;t believe her ears. She cried for the loss of the two men she had become friends with during her time in the research lab.

Liz slept fitfully that night, her dreams full of the ever smiling Mallows, and his sterner assistant Stevens, who only smiled when Mallows was not around. He was a good chess player, and had let her win two or three games, even though she had known he was doing so, he kept an innocent face.

The next day she sent flowers to the lab, to be sent on to their graves, if they had already been buried. They hadn&#8217;t said, and she didn&#8217;t want to ask.

As she sat in front of the mirror she noticed her hair seemed to be getting lighter, and longer. It was only then that she realised she had not seen a hairdresser since she came out of the lab, but then, as she did on the day she came home, her hair still looked as if it had been done only the day before. But it was definitely lighter in colour. Her normal raven hair was now much lighter, and she wondered what was happening. Once again the month had seen her breasts grow slightly, and what was once a 36 B, was now a 36 F, but with no droop at all. Even though they had grown, they were still firm, and needed no bra.

Liz began to make notes of what differences she was experiencing, including the loss of four periods, and then the severe cramps that had lasted all week when she finally had her period. And now, her hair was getting noticeably lighter. and her waist had definitely trimmed. It was now down to twenty two inches, from the twenty four she had been before hand. Something was changing, and changing her with it.

It was then that she thought that perhaps these were side effects form the experiment, but the only people she could have talked to about it, were now both dead. She knew she was alone with the problems, but what problems? Her new physique looked good on her, and she had actually never felt better, or fitter. Even when she used to go to the gym she had not felt as fit as she did now, and without exercise. This wasn&#8217;t a problem, this was a boon.

It wasn&#8217;t until she actually thought about it, that she realised she was actually eating a lot more healthier than she had in the past. Lots of salads, pastas and vegetables, and she had also stopped smoking. And none of this had happened consciously, it had all seemed natural to her. since leaving the lab she had not bought any cigarettes, and didn&#8217;t seem to be missing them, and the new food regime was obviously paying off in dividends.

Looking out of the window, the sun was high in the sky, and barely a cloud. It was time, she decided, to take to the beach. Apart from shopping, she had barely been out since she came home, and guessed that was why her skin had seemed pale. She needed a little sun on it, and she could buy a bikini on the way to the beach. She would have to do, as nothing she wore last year would come anywhere close to her measurements now, the bikini top would certainly be too small, and the bottoms would not fir either. 

At the beach, Liz rented a hut to get changed in, and to leave her street clothes, which were also pretty new. She had bought them only a week before, when she almost embarrassed herself in the supermarket, when her jeans had slipped past her waist and were threatening to slide right off her. Now she had a whole new wardrobe, and a younger looking one. Even at still just under twenty, she had always worn clothes that hid her figure. Now she was dressing to show it.

As she walked down the beach she heard two lads talking, one of them saying what a �babe� she was. But there were no boys close to her, the nearest being two sixteen year olds sat on the beach wall almost fifty feet away from where she was walking.

Surely it couldn&#8217;t have been them? There must be others closer who she had not seen.

But the voices came again, the second voice suggesting what he would do with her �given half the chance�. This time, Liz knew without doubt that it had come from them, she had, even at this distance, seen their lips moving, and one of the boys was playing pocket billiards, stroking his cock from inside his pocket.

How could she have heard from that distance? And how could she see them so clearly? The pock marked one who had called her a �babe� was admonishing his friend, telling him to get his hand out of his pocket, at least until they got home. 

Liz realised she could actually see better than she ever could before, and her hearing was vastly improved. She could hear almost silent gasps as she walked slowly along the beach, admiring whistles from people out of sight, and for the first time she could remember, she felt really good about herself.

And there was something else, something she had never felt before. She knew without a doubt that had the lad actually approached her, she would have actually given him his half a chance. Where this thought had come from baffled Liz. Never before had she even considered having sex, and was always proud of still being a virgin. But she felt sure that had the lad asked, she would have let him take her.

Going back to her hut to dress, Liz was confused, and bewildered. She kept the bikini on under her clothes, and walked as fast as she could, trying to get home before anything else happened.

Sat in the bath, the events of the day ran through her mind, and she just couldn&#8217;t get the thought that she would have let that boy have sex with her, out of her mind. She could still see him, perched on the wall, his hand in his pocket, unmistakably playing with himself.

She suddenly realised that her own hand was between her legs gently touching herself. Quickly, she moved her hand away, admonishing herself. She had never masturbated in her life, and couldn&#8217;t understand why she had almost done so.

She needed to talk to Mallows, but he was beyond helping her now.

Liz dried and lay on her bed, weeping.

As she slept that night, she dreamed of the lad off the beach. He was lying on top of her, naked, his hands teasing her nipples, as his cock began to slide in and out of her, her hips rising to meet his thrusts. He wasn&#8217;t very deep, but deep enough to feel him as their bodies came together with a bump,&nbsp; her hips grinding into him as they met his.

She could feel him speed up, and knew he was not going to hold on much longer. Her fingers strayed between her thighs and she began to play with her clit, wanting to orgasm as he did. There was a warm feeling in the pit of her stomach, and something she had never felt before rushed over her like a wave, just as the boy thrust his own hips at her as hard as he could, and stopped, his cock jerking inside her, as he let his white juices fill Liz&#8217;s pussy.

Liz woke with a start, as she realised she was dreaming, but her own hands were wet, as was the sheet below her. there were minute traces of blood, as she realised that boy&#8217;s cock inside her in the dream, were her own fingers, taking her own virginity.

Her mind seemed to be laughing at her, as she turned over and wept uncontrollably. 

The next morning she was on the phone to Pyro-Tech, trying to find out what Mallows and Stevens had been working on, if only to give her a clue.

The girl she spoke to was new, but she spoke to a supervisor who remembered Liz from her stay in the research lab. Unfortunately, he was not a part of the team with Mallows, and in the lab fire all records were destroyed, in fact, the lab had burned down completely, and nothing had been saved at all. He didn&#8217;t think to mention the one small petrie dish that didn&#8217;t seem to have been touched by the flames at all.

Liz was no closer to finding out what the experiment was, and now it was driving her crazy with lust. A lust she had never known before.

For almost a week, Liz locked herself away in the bedroom, trying to fight the growing urges she was getting. Her nipples and her clit had started to tingle, crying out for attention, and even though she fought it hard, she eventually gave in, feeling the pleasure wash over her as she teased her clit, and her nipples, feeling that warmth grow in the pit of her stomach, as an orgasm washed over her, leaving her totally drained, and breathless.

Only then did the tingle stop. Her body had obvious needs, and it would not be denied them.

Liz knew she needed food, and regardless of how she felt, she also knew she would have to go and get some. She put a thin blouse on, something that she hoped would not irritate her nipples. The last thing she wanted was them to start tingling while she was out shopping. She also chose to wear a loose skirt, without underwear. She wanted nothing in direct contact with her clit.

The walk to the shop made her feel strange, sexy, though she was not tingling. She could hear everyone speaking clearly, and could see much better than she ever could before. As she walked past one shop she glanced at her reflection in horror. Her nipples were clearly standing proud, pressing hard at the thin material. And her waist line looked as if it belonged to someone else, much trimmer than hers had ever been in the past, which, even in the loose skirt, emphasised her hips.

She could hear a taxi driver whistle, even though he was some way down the road, and whispers were all too clear for her now. Liz did her shopping as fast as she could, and almost ran home. She needed the clothes off, and away from her body.

Even as she closed the door, her nipples and clit began tingling uncontrollably, and she knew she had to satisfy her craving, dropping the shopping to the floor,&nbsp; one hand flew up her skirt, as the other began teasing and squeezing her nipples. Her fingers were deep in her pussy within seconds, ramming them as deep as she could, three fingers, and still her body tingled.

Within five minutes Liz had collapsed onto the floor, her fingers covered in her own juices, feeling her hand move closer to her mouth. Without hesitation, she opened her mouth wide to allow them in, sucking at them, tasting her own juices for the first time, and feeling a second orgasm rip through her like a hurricane as she did so.

What ever was happening to her body, it had created an insatiable lust, and Liz knew it was only going to be a matter of time before her body wanted more than her three fingers. wanted a man.

The next morning was another where the sun was shining, and it was going to be a hot day. Without thinking, Liz grabbed the bikini she had worn a few days early, and marvelled at how it fitted her even better, her tits almost popping out of the top, and the bikini bottoms clinging to her more rounded arse, and pulling tight under her pussy. Even though, she still felt good, and grabbing a short coat she left for the beach. The coat was left open, and Liz knew she was getting admiring looks from many directions. And a large number of comments as well.

Reaching the beach she removed the coat and lay down on the sand. She had only been there ten minutes when she heard two men talking between themselves, suggesting that they move closer to get a better look. Minutes later, even with her eyes closed, she knew the men had moved to within a few feet of her, slightly lower down the beach, so they could see between her slightly open legs.

What made Liz do it she had no idea. Slowly her legs opened wider, allowing the men a good look at the way her bikini caressed her pussy, the outline of her pussy lips clearly visible under the thin material.

There was also a slight moistness, as laying there being watched, was making her body react. Although she could not feel the wetness herself, she could plainly hear the two men whispering to each other, saying that she must be well turned on, and they should ask her over to the bar for a drink.

It took them a few minutes to pluck up the courage, but then one of them came closer and asked if she wanted to join them for a drink. Liz had never tasted alcohol before, and wanted to say no, but her mouth said yes, and she found herself walking up the beach with the two strange men, heading for a drink, and, according to one of the men whispering to his friend, much more.

On the way from the beach one of the men brushed her arse �accidentally�. Liz felt it immediately. The tingling was starting. Only lightly yet, but she knew it would increase, and she knew it would want satiating. These two men would certainly get the much more that they wanted. Her body demanded it.

As they passed one of the wooden beach huts one of the men said he needed to stop off and collect his wallet. Liz knew they would not leave the hut until her body had been satisfied, but the tingling was increasing, and she knew she had no choice. Walking to the hut with them, the man who said he needed his wallet, unlocked the door and entered. Liz could see that like the hut she had rented the week before, there was a single bed on one side of the hut, and coat hangers on the other side. Without thinking, she followed the man inside and said.

�Lets forget the drink shall we? We all know what you want�.

Her voice sounded huskier than normal, and her body was tingling even more now.

The second man entered the hut, and pulled the door closed, even as the first man had turned to Liz and started to stroke her arse, this time not accidentally.

What happened from there was a blur to Liz. Suddenly all three were named,&nbsp; and one man was lying on the bed on his back fondling her naked tits, while the other was standing behind her, his arms wrapped around her hips, his fingers teasing her pussy. The tingling increased, and Liz found herself leaning forward, and taking the cock of the man on the bed into her mouth. The man behind watched in awe as she began to suck him off, hearing his friend moan in pleasure.

Standing closer to Liz, now that she was bent over, he moved the head of his cock towards her pussy, perfectly displayed for him. Within seconds, he was deep inside her, his hips ramming against her arse, as she still sucked on his friend.

Loud moans escaped all three sets of lips, and Liz seemed to be moaning loudest of all, and could feel both cocks inside her together. Anyone passing by who heard the noises from the hut, would have had no problem knowing what was happening inside.

Liz moved her mouth from the guy on the bed, and pulled herself away from the man fucking her, climbing on the bed and kneeling over the first man. Her hand guided his cock to her pussy, and in a single move, she impaled herself on it, crashing her arse against his hips, sinking the hole of his cock into her, and starting to ride him hard, as the second man moved closer to her head, as she opened her mouth, taking his hard cock into it.

For fifteen minutes the men could stay with her, but she soon showed them she was more wanting of this than they were, as she sucked harder, and rammed herself hard onto the cock in her pussy. As it had done at home, her orgasm when it came, ripped through her like a tidal wave, made harder by the fact that as she had her orgasm, the cock in her mouth exploded, as did the one in her pussy. She could taste the salty. Mustiness of the man&#8217;s cum in her throat, as she sucked him deep, drinking everything he could give her,. as she ground her hips against the other man. Milking his cock dry.

Only then did the tingling begin to subside, neither man capable of restarting, they were totally satiated, and, for now, so was her body. A week ago she had taken her own virginity so satisfy her body&#8217;s lust, now she had taken two men. Where would it end?

Dressing and walking away, leaving the two men in the hut, Liz strangely felt no remorse about what she had just done. Her body had decided, and she had fulfilled its desires. Only a short time ago she would have done her best to fight it, but now, she didn&#8217;t want to fight it. It had made her feel good, and she had drank all the cum the man could give her, and her pussy was not releasing anything it had soaked up.

Liz knew her body would want more, but not today. Tonight she knew she would sleep peacefully, her body would let her.

Waking the next morning after a peaceful sleep. Liz looked at herself in the mirror. Her bustier slim waisted self looked better than it had ever done, and her hair had now finished changing colour. Gone was the short raven hair, replaced by cascading blonde tresses that fell half way down her back, but still looked as if she had just walked out of the hair dressers. 

She smiled, not even looking to find any of the old Liz. Whatever, or whoever she had become, she had a confidence she never had before, she could hear, see and smell much better than ever before. And she had a mission. She would never let her body down again. The week locked up in her own flat, trying to defy her body had been painful, and she had paid the price. Now, she knew she could not resist it, and she never would.

Had Mallows been able to examine the single cell now, he would have been shocked. Far from being inert, it had grown, had taken over, and had become the new Liz. But they would still have not known where the cell came from. The meteor had vanished, and the spare single cell, kept at the lab, had also now died. 

Liz left the flat, and felt the tingling start. today would be a good day.
