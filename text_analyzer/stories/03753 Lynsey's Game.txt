Lynsey's Game

Synopsis: Lynsey is a sweet girl who has always had things her own way.  So the thought of a little danger excites her.  On the internet, she begins to play an exciting little game, thinking that she's safe.  But she's not...LYNSEY'S GAME 
Lynsey was bored one night, which isn't the best reason for your life to change
  completely. But then, she didn't realize how far it would go or how much she
  would lose. 
Lynsey was a pretty ordinary young woman, in her twenties. Her parents had
  spent a lot of money educating her, so she'd gone to University, learned a
  marketable skill, and then, well lubricated by family money and family contacts,
  she'd slid right into a well paying career. Nothing too extraordinary, but
  comfortable. 
Physically, Lynsey was a stunner. A natural blonde, she had long legs and
  a round ass that had become J Lo fashionable just as it was developing. Her
  breasts were high and firm, not as large as she'd have liked, but suitable
  enough. Once in a while, she thought of breast implants, but never too seriously.
  She was satisfied with herself. Sex, like the rest of her life, had come easily
  and well lubricated, easy penetrations by lithe young boys, never wild or out
  of control. 
Perhaps, it was because her life had been so smooth that she harboured a secret
  little hunger. She was a girl that nothing bad had ever happened to, and on
  some level, she didn't believe that it ever could. The world was greased for
  her to slide through with a minimum of bother and inconvenience, anything she
  wanted was hers for the asking. 
So, deep down, she fantasized about rough sex. On the Vancouver skytrain,
  she learned, at certain hours and certain stations, she'd catch the tired worn
  strippers and whores riding to or from work. Exhausted worn women, with their
  smudged make up and too bright lipstick, slouching in their �fuck me' outfits.
  Sometimes sitting legs akimbo, so anyone could see up their thighs, and they
  couldn't care less. Every now and then, some weary slut would finish the night
  too dragged out to wipe, and Lynsey would catch the pearly gleam of semen on
  a thigh or a blouse. To say this turned her on wasn't quite right, rather,
  it heated her, raised her temperature, fascinated her with its consequences
  and implications. These slags and skanks were fucked out, and it wasn't the
  gentle touches of her polished lovers, it was industrial fucking, hard fucking,
  real cocks from hard, cruel men. 
She could imagine them on their knees, bent over tables, spread out on beds,
  on all fours on the floor, taking it from a variety of brutal men. That made
  her wet. Oh, yes it did. 
She liked to watch the men too, but more carefully. Hard men with tattoos
  and prison muscles, black gangsters, grizzled street people, vicious teens
  and middle aged hustlers. She never invited conversation, and if they spoke
  to her, she shut it down. But she loved their sidelong glimpses and the thought
  of men like these putting their hard meat to the degenerate skanks. 
She just never thought she'd be one of them. 
That was certainly never in her fantasies. When she masturbated, it was never
  her writhing under black or white thugs, but the worn out, ruined girls who
  rode the skytrain. Girls who dressed to be fucked (and she'd never dress like
  that) deserved to be fucked, needed that fucking. 
And if once in a while, when her dildo was deep inside, and the vibrator on
  her clit, if it was her face and body in skank outfits, bent over and on all
  fours to some gangbanger... Well, that was just fantasy. She was far too fastidious
  to do these things, or even to contemplate doing these things. 
So, what fucked her life? 
The internet. On the internet, she one day, discovered skank sites and slut
  sites, places where worn out whores gained a few dollars selling their pictures.
  From there, she discovered story sites, which fed her wicked fantasies. Even
  chatrooms, especially chatrooms, her undoing. 
So, one night, Lynsey was in an internet chatroom, masturbating slowly, playing
  with the men. There were other women there, but Lynsey was never sure if they
  were real women. Some, she thought, were, some she was sure, weren't. She didn't
  care about them. She loved chatting with the men, encouraging their brutal
  fantasies, nothing too violent, just degradation and possession. 
�What are you wearing,� one of the regulars, Mkay asked her. 
�A bustier, garter belt and nipple clamps,� she typed back. Actually, she
  was just wearing a robe and fuzzy slippers. 
�Bullshit,� Mkay said. That offended her. 
�Fuck you then,� she typed. 
�I'd love to get my hands on you for real,� he typed. She smiled. It was going
  to spin into some nasty little fantasy scene, a little force, a little rape,
  some bondage, and she'd have a nice little orgasm for his efforts. She'd type
  just the minimum to keep him going, maybe guide him a little bit. 
But in the end, for all the violence in his words, it would be as smooth and
  effortless and inconvenience free as her sex always was. Satisfaction guaranteed,
  minimal effort required. 
�I think we'd all love to get our hands on you Lynsey,� Mike wrote. �How about
  a real life chance?� 
�What,� she typed amused, �you want a meeting? I'll think about it.� 
�Yeah right,� Mike typed. 
Then she had a little idea, a delicious little idea, an idea that sent a little
  surge of wetness down her lips. An idea that ultimately meant that everything
  that happened was her own doing, not that it really mattered in the end. 
�Tell you what,� Linsey wrote. �We'll play a game. I'll give you a clue, and
  if you can find me, you can have me.� 
�One lousy clue?� 
�Clues,� she amended. �Every time I'm on, I'll deliver a few more clues. Watch
  for clues, put them together, find me and.....� 
�And what?� 
�Rape me. I'm the prize. If you can track me down, you can rape me, blow your
  load, whatever. You own my body.� 
�You want to be raped?� Mkay asked skeptically. 
�Yes,� Linsey typed, her pussy suddenly on fire, her cunt clenching, wetter
  than she'd ever been. Her heart was pounding. �I want to be raped.� 
She caught herself, �but I don't want to make it easy, so if you want me,
  you have to work for it. So are you up for the game?� 
�Can I play too?� Another guy, Jerry, typed. 
�Anyone can play,� she said. Another shiver went through her. It was real
  life that excited her. Oh not that there was one chance in a million, or ten
  million. Hell, if she thought someone might really nail her, she'd have gotten
  off the computer right then. But still, there was the possibility, a real possibility,
  so faint and illusive that it was almost nonexistent, but just there enough
  to spark her clit. To make her shiver and squirm. 
�Yeah, bullshit clues, we'll never find you.� 
�No, I promise. I'll only do real clues.� 
�Yeah,� Mike challenged, �what are you wearing right now? No bullshit.� 
Bite the bullet time. 
�A terrycloth bathrobe and bunny slippers,� she typed. 
�Fuck,� Mkay wrote. �No garter belt?� 
�I don't even own one.� 
�I'll play,� Mike typed. �For my clues, I want you to answer a few questions.� 
�Sometimes I'll answer questions, sometimes I'll give you things, but I won't
  make it too easy.� 
�Where do you live?� 
Lynsey burst out laughing. 
�I won't make it too easy by giving you an address,� she wrote. �But I live
  in Vancouver.� 
�Height?� 
�Five feet, seven inches.� 
�Weight?� 
�115 pounds.� 
�Hair?� 
�Honey blonde, shoulder length, bangs in front.� 
�The hunt is on.� Someone typed. 
And reading that, Lynsey's fingers slammed into her cunt, pulling her lips
  wide, fingering her clit to an explosive, thrilling, delicious orgasm. 
She signed off without explanation, as she usually did, and went to watch
  TV. 
Little did she know, the Mike also lived in Vancouver, as did three or four
  other men who frequented that chatroom from time to time. She might have known
  if she'd checked the member logins, but that was her mistake. 
* * * * * * * * 
Mike stared at the screen, stroking his erection. The bitch had signed off
  again. That didn't surprise him, he'd come to expect it. The minute the bitch
  came, she was gone. It didn't matter to her whether her cyberpartner came which
  was bad enough. But worse in his view, she had no respect for the mechanics
  of a good well structured fantasy. Mike considered himself an artist, and after
  his first few encounters with Lynsey, he just didn't bother. Not that she ever
  noticed his indifference. 
So, he wondered, was this for real? He doubted it, the self absorbed bitch
  would never really put herself at risk. There wasn't one chance in a thousand.
  But even one chance in a thousand....? 
It could be a hell of a game, he decided. Abruptly, he created a new database
  directory, named it Linsey, and dumped all the �clues' in there. Then he instituted
  a file function to record her visits to the chat room and everything she said.
  Then he emailed a few of his internet friends in Vancouver to let them know
  about this fascinating little game.... 
A thousand to one shot? Worth buying a ticket to take the bitch down.... 
* * * * * * * * * 
Lynsey found herself flying through the day. She skipped at work, riding the
  skytrain she couldn't help glancing around, wondering if one of those faces
  belonged to the someone from her chatroom. Ridiculous and infinitely improbable,
  but exciting nevertheless. Why, she might be stalked even now! 
Okay, that couldn't possibly happen, not with the bullshit handful of clues
  she'd given. There must be 50,000 girls in Vancouver with her height and build
  and hair colour, and there was no way that any contact would be anything but
  totally accidental. 
But still.... She kept thinking back to that internet chat, to the game, and
  she'd find herself getting wet. 
When Lynsey got home, she couldn't wait to masturbate, bring herself to a
  rich satisfying orgasm. Later, as the evening wore on, the tingle began. She
  signed into the chatroom. Mike was there, revelling in the game, she flirted
  and dropped a few more clues. And came again. 
* * * * * * * * * * 
Most internet games wore off, their themes tired, and Lynsey got bored. But
  this one got more exciting each time she played. It was now a customary ritual,
  she would sign on, chat, flirt, cyber or role play, but somewhere along the
  line, she would drop another clue or two. Usually real ones, it was better
  that way. A few fake ones, because, after all, she wasn't stupid. 
And real clues mostly. She was always careful not to give away anything critical.
  It would be a restaurant she'd eaten in, or perhaps a favourite brand of coffee,
  or a description of an article of clothing. But with each, there was the sense
  of giving away a little piece of herself, there was a little revelation, a
  surrender that might somehow be her undoing. Perhaps they knew that restaurant,
  or staked it out? Perhaps they would spot her in that article of clothing?
  You never know. It was risky, and the risk drove her insane. 
Sometimes, giving away a particular clue, she would be so overcome by the
  idea of surrender, the idea that this might be her undoing, that she would
  come in a splashing, shuddering orgasm. 
And she came. Linsey was having the best orgasms of her life. It was a nasty,
  vile, vicious game, and she loved it. 
It seemed to put her in a state of permanent arousal, it made her more richly
  aware of herself, of the possibilities. The idea that she might be under surveillance,
  might be stalked, that any minute some rough man might grab her and drag her
  into an alley, made her stomach flutter and her nipples hard. Once or twice,
  in the middle of the day, she even had to sneak in to some bathroom and quickly
  masturbate. 
* * * * * * * * * 
�So,� Mike typed. �The restaurant is bullshit.� 
He typed into a very select chatroom, to a very select group of friends. They
  were the Linsey project, and there were six of them. 
A few he'd known from real life before. After all, guys with identical interests,
  the same sorts of nasty, misogynous tastes in women, it was nice to go to a
  strip club, tip a beer and fuck with some desperate stripper. 
They were an eclectic group. A black steelworker, a computer nerd, a mechanic
  and so on.... Truly they didn't have a lot in common besides a love for degrading
  and debasing women. So they didn't hang out much. But once in a while, they
  might get together, one or two, here or there, and share an activity... Like
  abusing some crack whore. So they trusted each other. 
Mike had introduced some real time friends to the chatroom. A few others had
  come along. The group worked itself out. 
The Lynsey project united them, it galvanized them, giving them a sense of
  purpose. They were going to hunt the bitch. 
�Yeah,� Jack typed. �But it's Italian, and she's expressed a preference for
  Italian food a few times. And there is an Italian restaurant three blocks away
  from her bullshit location.� 
�Hmmm,� Zacc said, �we should put that one in the maybe category.� 
They were building up an elaborate profile of her. They had, by this time,
  a very detailed description of her appearance, not quite enough for a police
  sketch artist, but getting better all the time. Parts of it were not immediately
  useful, for instance they knew what her nipples looked like. But who knew when
  that would come in handy. They had descriptions of several sets of earings,
  and of numerous articles of her clothing. 
�Gonna put rings through them nipples,� Jack told them. �Gonna put heavy ass
  rings, maybe 4 gage, gonna braze them so they can't be taken off, make them
  so big you see them poking through her bra. If we let her wear one.� 
They knew her birthday, three digits of her social insurance number, and four
  digits from her Mastercard. They knew two banks she wasn't dealing with, and
  a dozen restaurants where she'd been, what days she had done her shopping,
  and her favourite dry cleaning chain. They even knew several areas where she
  occasionally went to shop or relax. 
It built up steadily. Sometimes, when one of them had a day off, he'd spend
  it hanging out, frequenting some area where they believed she hung out. There
  was a slim chance she might be passing through on that day. They even had a
  search methodology. Find a traffic point where everyone had to pass through,
  find someplace comfortable and wait and watch. A few times, they even carried
  a digital camera, trying to build up a database of possibles, that could be
  compared, sifted, and used to determine if there was a recurring face... 
Of course, you would see a lot of �maybe' girls. Never anyone quite perfect,
  of course. Always a little short, a little tall, a little heavy, the earings
  not quite as described, an article of clothing close but not quite. But you
  could watch one go by and just imagine it was the bitch, and your cock would
  get hard as a rock. Sometime, if she was really close to the description, they
  might follow, ambling along behind her for a few minutes, trying to get a better
  look. 
Once or twice, Lynsey thought someone might be following her. But of course,
  it was just her imagination. Still, the feeling would leave her drenched, cunt
  clenching, just aching to masturbate to an increasingly intense orgasm, fantasizing
  that she really was followed and what they had planned to do to her. 
* * * * * * * * * * 
�Which garter belt are you wearing,� Mike typed. 
�The red one,� she responded. Lynsey really did have garter belts now, and
  she was wearing one to command. 
The game, of course, had evolved, as games always do. When the intensity had
  lagged, although never by much, with clues, it had gained a little more edge
  with suggestions. Minor suggestions, wear a particular set of earings today.
  How about this jacket? That lipstick? 
It excited Lynsey to obey. It was mostly innocuous. No one would look twice
  at her if she happened to be wearing her black bolero jacket. Except that someone
  had told her to do so. Someone who was outside somewhere and might somehow,
  possibly, maybe glimpse her in it. It upped the risk level just a tiny bit,
  and the effect on her was orgasmic, paralyzing, thrilling. 
She loved it. And so, the requests, finding compliance, became a little bolder.
  Buy a particular brand of moist, wet looking lipstick. It didn't suit her,
  but she bought it. How about a velour miniskirt? Why not, she thought, trying
  one on, it made her ass look good. Of course, she never took a real chance,
  if she was shopping an item to order, she always made sure to go to some out
  of the way place and never went there twice. 
It was when she was in front of the computer screen that the sexual intensity
  was hottest, that she got the wettest. And it was in front of the computer
  screen that the requests first evolved into commands. Little instructions for
  dress up, and then undress, to put on lipstick or make up. They couldn't know
  whether she had the lipstick on or not, but it pleased her, excited her, to
  do it anyway. They couldn't know she was obeying, but that wasn't important,
  she knew. The game made her shiver. 
Ordered to buy a bustier, she bought one and wore it before the screen. Then
  a garter belt, and another, and another. Stockings and stay ups followed, charcoal,
  fishnets, cream. She shaved her pussy for the silent masters on the other side
  of the screen, her shimmering smoothness making her unbelievably wet. She wore
  lingerie for them, put it on or took it off on command, spread her legs. 
And came and came and came. 
Excited, boldened, she confessed little fantasies, revealed her fascination
  with slutware. So of course, they commanded, describing slutty outfits, ordering,
  sending her searching. Linsey would dress the part for her computer screen,
  making herself look like a cheap whore, even putting runs in stockings, sloppily
  applying make up... And then spreading her legs and letting her cyberpartners
  push her to splendid orgasm. 
She was, without realizing it becoming a slave. She was, only vaguely realizing
  it, addicted. 
And when she got breast implants, she even mostly believed it was her idea. 
But of course, she was always careful never to give away too much. It was
  one thing to dress in slutware, to spread and whimper and beg in front of the
  computer screen. 
But some suggestions/orders went unanswered. She didn't go to a peep show
  on Granville, to the third booth, where a glory hole waited, and so never sucked
  a cock, was never spotted, photographed, sorted and identified. She didn't
  go to specific lingerie shops for specific items. She never got her nipples
  pierced, despite numerous demands, and numerous assents. And, once in a while,
  she'd lie about what she was wearing, or what she was going out in, just to
  throw it off, although in those moments, she'd tell herself that she was just
  bored with the game and who cares anyway. 
So, although they were steadily closing in on her, she remained safe and oblivious.
  For the time being. 
* * * * * * * * * * * 
Her undoing came on a Saturday morning. She signed on to her chat, to see
  if anyone was there. Mike was. 
�Hey slut,� he greeted her. 
�Hey.� 
�What are you doing today?� 
�Shopping, I think.� 
�Cool. What are you wearing right now?� 
�Nothing.� Which was true. 
�Shall I dress you?� 
Linsey got wet. 
�Sure.� 
�Black garter belt.� 
A moments pause, she returned wearing it loosely tugged around her waist.
  No stockings, she'd learned to wait to be told what stockings. 
�Fishnet stockings.� 
�What kind?� 
�The large ones.� 
She complied, and sat spreading her legs. 
�Okay.� 
�Now....� Mike thought a second, �I want you to wear this to go shopping today.� 
Lynsey felt her heart race. She was suddenly fully wet, her nipples hardened.
  She licked her lips. 
�Okay,� she lied. She'd wear any kind of shit in front of the computer screen,
  but she was a lot more careful out of doors. It wasn't that she really thought
  they'd spot her, she just didn't like looking too much like a slut. 
Mike paused, trying to gauge her. Deep down, beneath all her clues and fantasies,
  he knew she was chickenshit. She might say or do anything on line, and he mostly
  believed her when she told them about her lingerie. But to slut out in public?
  No, she might be pushed a little there, but not too far, not yet. 
�The red knit dress,� he ordered. 
Lynsey was surprised. It wasn't nearly as slutty as she had been expecting,
  or hoping. 
The red knit dress was a party dress, it looked good on her, clinging to the
  curves of her body, showing cleavage, but not too much, moderately short, but
  not as short as her miniskirts. It was just vaguely, juicily slutty. It was
  the sort of dress a woman wore to show she was fire in bed, though not necessarily
  for anyone. 
�Is that really what you want?� She asked. 
�I want you walking around shopping in this,� he said, �red dress and fishnets,
  like a whore taking time off.� 
The idea sent shivers up her spine and thrills down her cunt. Not that she'd
  do it, but she could actually visualize herself doing it. It was.... Possible. 
She went to put on the dress. 
�High heels, for shopping,� was waiting for her, �those ankle boots.� 
�No panties.� 
�No bra.� 
�Cherry lipstick.� 
�Eye liner.� 
�Now sit at the edge of the chair, hike the dress up your thighs and spread
  your legs.... Do you have the dildo... Take it and lick it.....� 
Fifteen minutes later, she came and as usual, signed off the net. On the other
  side, Mike cursed. Then he got on the phone. This was too good. According to
  their database, there were four areas where Lynsey usually shopped. It was
  a Saturday morning, she was within her patterns. 
There were six of them to stake out the four areas. Jesus, this might be it.
  If she wore even part of the outfit, hell, even if she didn't wear, there was
  still a chance they might spot her.... 
Lynsey busied herself around her apartment, doing some tidying up, taking
  care of a few things. She slipped out of the boots, but continued to wear the
  dress and stockings. They weren't uncomfortable or outrageous, especially around
  the apartment. It made her feel sexy. 
After half an hour, she found herself getting wet. After forty five minutes,
  she was seriously considering going online. But if Mike was there, he would
  probably be pissy about her signing off. She chewed her lip. There would probably
  be someone to play with her.... But if she stayed on the net all day, she wouldn't
  get any shopping done. 
Abruptly, she decided. Why not? Take a step? Wear this outfit outdoors? The
  red dress, she decided, wasn't really that bad. More a party dress, but really,
  not all that bad for shopping. She might turn a few heads, but she didn't look
  like a whore. The stiletto ankle boots she wore outdoors half the time anyway.
  So what did it really come down to? The stockings, that was all. Her heart
  pounded. Why not? No panties or bra? Who would know? 
Do it. 
She was wet, suddenly. 
Do it. 
She pulled the dress up to her crotch, fingered her wet cunt. 
Why not? 
Do it? 
Do it. 
Yes. 
Humming, brimming with excitement, almost floating with sexual tension, she
  left the apartment. 
* * * * * * * * * 
Ian had been sitting at the skytrain gate to Metrotown reading the same damned
  newspaper for four hours. He was fucking bored. 
All the things he could be doing today, instead, he was here wasting his time
  on the off chance that some blonde bitch might be passing by. What are the
  odds, he told himself, one in a thousand. 
Of all the borderline rapists and woman beaters of the Lynsey project, he
  was the most skeptical. Sure, there was a certain fun to it, a certain excitement.
  But he wasn't sure if he truly expected to find her, or what they'd do with
  her if they did. Sure as shit, it wasn't going to be today. 
But Mike, fucking Mike, had one of his wild inspirations. So everyone else
  had signed on to waste their day. Which meant Ian had to go along. 
So he sat there, reading the same fucking newspaper articles over and over
  again, scanning over every trainload of incoming passengers as they debarked
  on the platform and alternately fantasizing about raping the bitch and punching
  out Mike. 
Another train.... 
Ian glanced out. That fucking Mike, he swore to himself. He glanced up.... 
A tall blonde, maybe 5'7&quot; without her heels, paused on the platform.
  She had long legs wrapped in large fishnets, every man that passed glanced
  at those legs, and a formfitting red knit dress which exposed healthy cleavage.
  By the way her nipples pushed at the dress, there was no bra. It hugged so
  close he could see the telltale ridge at her hip that people might take for
  panties, but he knew was a garter belt. She licked glossy lips, an unconscious
  gesture that brought his cock hammering to painful erection in his pants. 
It was her! Holy shit, it was the bitch!!! After all this time, Ian couldn't
  believe it. There she was standing there like a wet dream. Ian almost lost
  it, almost gave himself away. Her gaze swept over him, indifferent, didn't
  linger. A part of him wanted to jump, run up, grab her by the hair, slap her
  face, force her to kneel and then shove his hard cock between those glossy
  lips. With a massive effort of will, he restrained himself. All those fucking
  promises, oh she never thought she'd have to come through, and she'd probably
  try to weasel out.... 
The plan. Play it cool. Ian controlled himself. Reaching down for the digital
  camera concealed by his newspaper, he snapped off a series of shots. He couldn't
  aim properly, all he could do was point and click while trying to look invisible.
  She never noticed. She proceeded down the stairs He dared to lift the camera
  to catch some shots of her backside descending the stairs. What a fucking ass!
  He thought of the sound she'd make as he shoved his cock between those luscious
  cheeks into a dry, unlubricated, squirming anus, the squeals of violation,
  and he almost came in his pants. 
The minute she was out of sight, he grabbed for his cell phone. 
�Mike, you bastard! She's here, dressed exactly the way you said, fucking
  exactly. She's coming your way, get into place!� 
Only then did he lay the newspaper over his lap so he could unobtrusively
  stroke his erection, and lift up the camera screen to see what his pictures
  had captured of her. 
* * * * * * * * * * 
Lynsey wandered through the Metrotown mall complex, not hurrying. She was
  mostly just window shopping, she didn't need to buy anything in particular.
  She smiled to herself, her outfit attracted a lot of attention, she was very
  conscious of being window shopped herself. It was harmless attention though,
  perhaps a little exciting to think of her future rapist (Rapists? Nah) as one
  of the watchers, but really that was bullshit. Still, she could feel male gazes
  like pinpricks that gave her goosebumps, caught glances sliding off her like
  oil. It made her nipples hard, it made her pleasantly wet down there. She fucking
  loved it. 
So she drifted through, window shopping here and there, and letting herself
  be window shopped. She would, she decided, have to do this again. Maybe even
  a little more daring next time... 
* * * * * * * * * * * 
She passed by Jack close enough that he could have reached out and squeezed
  her nipples. He could barely restrain himself from glancing into her cleavage.
  He could tell she noticed his quickly averted look, he caught her half smile,
  watched as she forgot about him almost instantly. His heart pounding, his cock
  pushing against his pants, he turned away. It was okay, up ahead, he knew Mike
  was waiting, he'd seen him. 
They were shadowing her carefully, doing it professionally. First one, then
  the other, sometimes ahead of her, sometimes behind, so she never realized
  that she was being stalked. And in the meantime, the others were closing in.
  Mike had called the rest off from their vigils, Jack was the first to arrive. 
Up ahead, she stopped and chatted and laughed as a couple of giggling teenagers
  pointed their camcorder at her. She piroueted and then wiggled her ass for
  their camera, and then wandered off in Mike's direction as the teenagers found
  someone else to point the camera at. Mike had paid the teenagers a hundred
  dollars and loaned them the camcorder for the express purpose of getting her
  on video without her fully realizing who and why. Now, in a few minutes, he'd
  have to retrieve it for Mike. 
His cell phone rang. �What's next?� Zacc's voice called. It was time to plan
  the next steps.... 
* * * * * * * * 
Lynsey never suspected that the man sitting on the skytrain as she departed
  Metrotown was watching her. In fact, if she noticed him at all, it was because,
  alone of the men in the skytrain cabin, he never glanced at her. She crossed
  her legs to draw his attention, slid one hand down a fishnet clad thigh. He
  glanced towards her, then back to the window. Satisfied, she forgot about him. 
Peter marked the station she got off at, and then, exceeding the agreed plan,
  he got off to follow her. He trailed her down two streets until the crowd thinned
  out, and then ducked into a Subway Shoppe. His regret was almost physical,
  but they couldn't set up a proper tail for this leg... Next time. 
At least he had some great digital shots of her legs. Their long length wrapped
  in fishnet, the slivers of garter belt and bare skin around the stocking as
  he dress had ridden up before being unconsciously pushed back down. Maybe even
  a glimpse of pussy as she'd sat down, that would be too lucky... Maybe. He
  flipped open his cell phone, �Target is lost,� he announced. 
�Roger,� the voice replied. �We'll pick her up again. Come on in, its time
  to celebrate.� 
* * * * * * * * * * 
Upon her return home, Lynsey found the chatroom curiously bland. Still, she
  was keyed up and excited from her experience. She dropped a handful of worthless,
  mostly false, clues, and reached a satisfying orgasm. 
Meanwhile, her chatroom �masters' had gathered in a restaurant, a real restaurant
  to celebrate. 
�Fucking A, Mike,� Ian crowed, �Fucking A, we tracked her. You're the man!� 
A champagne bottle popped, and soon they were all toasting him. Digital cameras
  circulated around the table as they compared their shots. There were 122 shots
  that had Lynsey in them, another 40 that were spoiled, and a precious minute
  of videotape. Many of the shots were junk, or of her backside, which wasn't
  bad because she had a clearly fuckable ass. There were a few standout shots,
  of her breasts, of her face and profile, and one very provocative shot giving
  the most tantalizing glimpse of her pussy. 
�Gentlemen,� Mike announced finally, �We've made a breakthrough, that's true.
  And I'm glad we didn't screw it up. I would have loved to take that bitch's
  ass myself, but we all held on and showed restraint. We still have some more
  work to do though, before we have her where we want her.� 
�Man,� said Jack, �I'd have loved to have taken her right there, raped her
  fucking ass.� 
�No good,� Mike replied, we've talked about it. �She figures this is just
  a game and she's not really going to get caught. All that stuff she says about
  taking her, that's bullshit, if she got raped, she'd go straight to the cops.
  So instead, we do it carefully, when we're ready, we rape her and get away
  with it and we do more than rape her, we fucking own her ass.� 
�We're going to get her,� Zacc said. �She's so got. She's all hog tied right
  now, she just doesn't know it, and won't know it till we put the branding iron
  to her.� 
Ian filed away the thought of a branding iron. Definitely a possibility. 
�Well,� said Jack, �all I've got to say is: Here's to phase two!� 
They cheered and toasted. 
Later on, after the restaurant closed, they bought a thirteen year old crack
  whore for the night. They rented a seedy hotel room, and took turns abusing
  the haunted wraith, and although the spent their lust and aggression on her
  scrawny waifish body Lynsey's face and figure was in their minds. 
When they were finished, the took turns urinating on her unconscious body,
  dropped a few twenties, and all headed to their respective homes. 
Phase two was about to start. 
* * * * * * * * * * 
Lynsey didn't go slutting outdoors all next week, although several times,
  she was tempted to, and the �masters' in her chatroom pushed. 
She was obedient in front of the screen, spreading her legs, dressing to command,
  scattering clues, good ones, before rocketing to orgasm. She never realized,
  and they never let her realize that her clues were no longer necessary. 
On Tuesday, four of the guys had booked time off and gathered at her skytrain
  in the afternoon, waiting for her to return home from work. Their tail was
  invisible, and they tracked her to her apartment building. 
The next day, Peter was in the elevator with her, when she got off at her
  floor. Within an hour after that, careful legwork identified her apartment
  number, and from there, her full name. They were amused to discover that her
  first name really was Lynsey. 
It just got easier. By Thursday, they'd tailed her to her office, identified
  her workplace, and her job. By Friday, they had her work schedule. 
It only took them so long because they were being so very, very careful. Lynsey
  was oblivious, she had no idea the noose was tightening about her, that it
  was no longer a game. She wouldn't have noticed if they were less discrete,
  might have missed it if they'd been obvious. She just didn't realize her danger,
  and so she carried on her life, of which wicked little computer fantasies were
  a larger and larger part. They watched her go about blithely, and it only increased
  their contempt for her. 
That Saturday, they pushed and persuaded her into slutting out again. This
  time high heeled boots, velvet miniskirt and tube top. She chickened out a
  little, adding a heavy jean jacket to give a bit of modesty. But still definitely
  skanky. 
This time, she wandered off someplace new, and they eventually lost the tail
  on her. No big deal. It was time for phase three. 
When she got home, in a fit of pique, Mike forced her to fuck herself with
  her biggest dildo. Which pushed her to a shuddering orgasm, and left her oddly
  nervous, with the oddest feeling that things were getting a little out of control. 
* * * * * * * * * 
Phase Three began on Wednesday, when her apartment door opened an hour after
  she had gone to work and four men walked in. Jack hadn't been able to get off
  work, and Chuck didn't want to be tagged for B&amp;E. But they had, like the
  rest contributed financially to the next phase of their little project, pooling
  both money and technical skill. 
Zacc had done plenty of B&amp;E's, and he knew how to spring a lock without
  anyone being the wiser. Ian was along for the ride. Peter carried a briefcase
  full of equipment as did Mike. Everyone was a bit nervous, except for Mike.
  Nerves were understandable, breaking into a woman's home was tantamount to
  breaking into her. It was a big step. It had all been fun and games, up until
  then. But this was for real. 
�Fuck!� Ian swore. �I can't believe it. We're in.� 
�Yeah,� Mike said, his voice businesslike to conceal his tension. �We've all
  got a job to do, let's do it.� 
He surveyed the apartment, spotting her computer, and went directly to it.
  For a second, he memorized the position of her chair, contemptuously noting
  the pussy stains on the fabric. Then he sat down, cracked open his case, and
  booted up her computer. 
As Mike attached a zip drive and began copying out the entire content of her
  computer, Peter slowly surveyed the apartment, examining each room in turn,
  looking for the best place to insert spy cams, how to hook up the power feeds
  and where to sneak the splices into the phone lines. 
Zacc took out a small dictaphone and digital camera. He went into the bathroom
  first, photographing and describing the contents of her medical cabinet, her
  soaps and shampoos, the toiletries, even the types, colours and softnesses
  of towels. Finishing quickly, he went into the bedroom, to catalogue her lingerie
  and wardrobe for them. It would keep him out of trouble, the others figured. 
Ian went carefully through her papers. �Aha,� he announced, �found her phone
  book.� 
�Rather you found her diary,� Peter grumbled. He cracked his suitcase open
  and set up a scanner plate, so that Ian could photocopy the pages. 
�Her diary, if she's got one, is probably on computer, we're getting it. The
  phone book is pretty good,� Mike offered, �it's got all the names and addresses,
  phone numbers, of family and friends. I'm sure that we can find a way to use
  that.� He paused. �Look for her tax returns.� 
�What the fuck will that do?� Peter asked. 
Mike shrugged. The zip drive had finished. He inserted a disk containing a
  tailored program, not quite a virus. What it was designed to do was to log
  her every keystroke, and send it to his computer, without her ever knowing. �Can't
  hurt. We want everything on this bitch.� 
Peter grunted. He'd found a suitable location for a spy cam in the bathroom.
  They were soon going to be seeing a lot more of Linsey. 
A hooting came out of the bedroom. Zacc had found her collection of sex toys
  and dildoes. Ian went to check it out. 
�Remember where everything was,� Mike called, �we want it all back in exactly
  the same place. If she figures out someone has been here we're fucked.� 
�She's fucked,� Zacc yelled back. 
�Not quite yet,� Mike whispered. �But soon.... Hey?� 
�What?� 
�She's got a cam on her computer.� 
�So what, the bitch never uses it for us.� 
�Yeah, but I bet we can switch it to hidden mode, so it doesn't register as
  being on, but its registering and broadcasting everything.� 
�Can you do that?� 
�Yeah, but we'll have to come again. I don't have the software here.� 
�Fine, maybe we can save a spycam. We were planning a few trips, anyway. I
  still have to figure out a phone tap.� 
* * * * * * * 
Linzey didn't notice anything out of sorts when she got home, although if
  she'd looked carefully, she might have spotted a few things. 
The cybersex was, for some reason, particularly fiery. Several of her �masters'
  were on, and they almost seemed to be coordinating, stoking her higher and
  higher, never quite allowing her to come, until finally, her orgasm was like
  a nuclear explosion. For once, she didn't simply sign off, she was too overwhelmed,
  and they extracted a promise from her to slut herself out to order the next
  morning. They'd get together in cyber in the morning to choose an outfit. 
Feeling sated, Linsey pulled herself together enough to take a nice long shower.
  As she soaped her breasts and unselfconsciously fingered her already lubricating
  cunt, she had no idea that she had an audience.... 
* * * * * * * * 
Linzey wasn't sure about how they dressed her that morning. Cream stockings
  and a short shocking pink skirt that barely covered her garters. She'd have
  to be careful sitting down. At least the top was relatively modest, not quite
  excessive.... A tight black sweater (mercifully allowing a bra), high neck
  and bare arms without appreciable cleavage, and a heavy white jacket. She might
  not have gone for it at all, just lied and told them she was wearing it. But
  the jacket allowed her just that bit more of concealment. She wondered vaguely
  when she'd mentioned it to them, she couldn't recall. It wasn't important. 
As it turned out, the day was hot, so after sweating a few hours, she took
  the jacket off. She got a lot of glances around the office, but no one spoke
  to her about her obviously inappropriate attire. After all, she usually dressed
  professionally. 
Since no one said anything, she decided it wasn't so bad. She decided to go
  trolling for looks at the mall, after work. She had discovered that she liked
  being window shopped. 
* * * * * * * * 
The second visit completed the enslavement of Linsey's computer, if not of
  Linsey herself. The cam was now permanently on, permanently relaying to Mike's
  computer. A few more adjustments, and he could read her email before she received
  it, and control her computer from his workstation.... Not that he intended
  to tip his hand. 
The phone �tap' wasn't even really a tap, just an adjustment to the phone
  circuits, so that the phone read as having an extension line.... Which happened
  to be a dedicated line that Mike had paid for in his apartment, hooked up to
  digital recording so that every call in or out was monitored. 
A few more visits, and they knew her apartment better than she did. They knew
  how many cups she had in her cupboard, the brand name of unused condoms in
  her drawer. They had copies of every key, had the passwords and codes. 
It wasn't enough for them. Mike raped her computer's memories, they examined
  her favourite internet sites, measured the frequency and duration of her visits.
  With her credit card numbers, they electronically requisitioned her visa and
  mastercard statements going back years. Phone records were pored over, cross
  referenced to her private phone book. They looked at old restaurant receipts,
  old letters, cards, tax returns. Piece by piece, they knew more about her shallow,
  empty, selfish life than she did. 
Mike's database grew immense, the data only saved from being unwieldy by Mike's
  careful software architecture. Much of it was useless, or apparently useless.
  Some of it found applications. 
They used her private writings, the information about her internet readings
  to fine tune their sexual manipulation of her. 
All Linsey knew was that they all just seemed better and better at pressing
  just the right buttons. They seemed to know when to hold off, to keep her shivering
  without letting her over the edge. The chat cyber-sex became, if anything,
  more intense and she grew more addicted, more obedient. 
They were astonished, the first night the video feed was open to them. They
  watched her trick herself out in lingerie at their commands and then masturbate
  herself to quivering helplessness with a savage dildo. It was the first time
  they saw the degree of control they'd slowly won over her. As they watched
  her ram the dildo up her body again and again, watched her quake and shudder,
  a thin stream of drool at the corner of her mouth, they were awed, and as one,
  felt an even greater hunger to crush her utterly. 
That night, they gathered again to celebrate. Not bothering with the restaurant,
  they bought the thirteen year old crack whore, who at least knew what to expect
  this time. They were merciless. 
The game was still going on, she still gave up clues. Most of the clues were
  now useless to them, they played the game to keep stringing her along. But
  there was another purpose now. Leaving her in her false sense of security,
  they could probe for deeper clues. Things she thought would not reveal her
  identity, and so did not guard so carefully. They probed, identifying weaknesses
  and vulnerabilities, bits of history, insights into friendships, insecurities.
  Things that they could use against her. 
* * * * * * * * * 
Under their influence, she started to experiment with butt plugs, and then
  a vibrator up her ass. They tutored her in fantasies more and more baroque.
  They made her come while telling her how they would have her suck a dog's cock. 
The cyber-sex relationship had simply swept aside any interest in regular
  relationships. Linsey found that it was awkward trying to spend time with friends,
  she was now setting appointments, times with her cyber �masters' and somehow,
  these always seemed to conflict with times she intended for friends. She saw
  them less and less frequently, and because she seemed so frequently busy when
  they called, they called less often. 
This disturbed her once in a while, and she would resolve to spend more time
  with her friends. But that would fade as she spread her legs. The comes were
  so good. They pushed just the right buttons, and they pushed harder and harder. 
And if certain emails from friends were intercepted and deleted, if certain
  messages were not recorded on her answering machine, how was she to know? Slowly,
  and with exquisite, delicate care, they were cutting her out of the herd, isolating
  their prey. Without understanding why or how, she and her friends drifted away
  from each other. 
She was slutting out more. Once or twice at work. But mostly in the weekends
  and evenings. Once she dressed like the cheapest whore, her top a simple string
  bikini, a skirt so short that it did not conceal her garters, heavy eyeliner
  and runs in her stockings. She rode the late skytrain, letting the other passengers
  stare at her, take her for nothing more than a worn out slag. As she rode,
  she got wetter and wetter, her thighs slick. At the end of the ride, she had
  to stumble to the women's washrooms to masturbate furiously. 
Mostly though, it was more subdued. Too wild and she balked. A few times,
  she refused to play altogether. But she was surprised at the number of times
  they did manage to coax her out, and at the way they seemed always able to
  push her a little bit further than she was prepared to go. 
There were setbacks. She was sent home from the office one day for dressing
  inappropriately. Overcome with shame, she stayed off the net for two days.
  They tensely watched her walk around the apartment, before she finally broke
  down and went online to them. Minutes later, they had a dildo up her ass. They
  had her again. 
When they thought she was ready, they ordered her on a mission: Wear your
  fishnet body stocking, halter top, hot pants. Go to the peep show on Granville,
  go to booth number three, 
Sit. If a cock slides through the glory hole, suck it, swallow it, and come
  home to tell us all about it... 
She made it perhaps halfway, dressing as ordered, and even going into the
  booth. But her nerve broke an instant later, and Chuck watched her flee, wobbling
  on her platform heels. Zacc cursed, in booth two, he hadn't even taken his
  cock out of his pants. 
A subsequent order for her to participate in wet T-shirt Amateur night at
  a remote strip club met with flat refusal. 
Regretfully, they concluded that they had found her limits. 
�Phase fucking four,� Zacc muttered, angry over his lost blow job. �Phase
  fucking four,� they agreed. 
* * * * * * * * * * 
Linsey liked to drink a glass of orange juice before going to bed. It was
  a longstanding habit, perhaps a relic of a happy childhood ritual. Unknown
  to her, they often watched her sip from her orange juice as she played. 
Tonight, however, Linsey felt tired. It had been a long day at the office,
  everyone was riding her ass. She'd lost a certain amount of respect there for
  the way she had dressed, something she didn't quite appreciate. Fatigue stole
  over her, and she decided, for once, to go to bed early. 
Ninety minutes later, as she was snoring, her door opened. Three men walked
  in. For this next move, they'd reluctantly decided on a minimal crew. 
�Okay,� Mike whispered, as he let the others in, �ski masks on, everyone remember,
  no unnecessary conversation.� 
�I don't know why we have to bother, she's out,� grumbled Ian. They could
  hear her snoring. 
�No taking chances yet,� Mike repeated. �Drugs can be unpredictable. This
  stuff is supposed to leave her docile and mildly euphoric, and fuck her memory
  formation. But that doesn't mean there's not a chance she might freak on us,
  or that she might remember.� 
�Well, in that case,� Zacc whispered, �we go straight to phase five and break
  the bitch. I'm okay with that.� 
There were grunted assents. Ian was a pharmacists assistant, and he was a
  lot more confident of the drug. Besides, they'd tried it out a few times on
  their thirteen year old crack whore, and then being cautious, they'd even experimented
  on a healthy young stripper of approximately Linsey's height and weight. They
  knew their way around. 
�We stick with the plan,� Mike demanded. The others, one by one, folded. 
They made their way into the bedroom, turning on the light. She didn't react.
  For a few seconds, they stared at her nude form, spread out on the bed. She
  was still wearing her white garterbelt with white stockings that they'd had
  her wear for their cyber play. She'd been too tired to strip it off. The garters
  on one leg had let go and the stocking, on its own, had rolled half down her
  thigh. 
�Fucking beautiful,� Zacc whispered. �Just fucking awesome.� He reached out
  to cup one naked breast, feeling the warm flesh. Ian slid his hand up her thigh,
  brushing fingertips against her pussy. 
She slept, snoring softly. Mike took out his digital camera and began snapping
  some pictures. Something to compromise the bitch. He took a basic set of half
  a dozen, he didn't want to use them all up too quickly. He tried for angles
  that exposed her charms without really making it obvious that she was sleeping. 
�Next step?� They nodded. Very gently, they rolled her over onto her stomach,
  slipping a pillow under her belly so that her ass was elevated. They pulled
  her legs apart, fixed the loose stocking back to her garter. 
Her pink virginal asshole winked up at them, perching above the smooth folds
of her pubes and labia. 
�Man,� Zacc said, �I'd love to slam that right now.� 
A few more pictures were snapped. Linsey had no secrets left. Mike knelt behind
  her and ran his fingertip lightly up and down her cunt until her lips parted
  and her clit swelled. As he began to feel wetness, her hips rolled slowly,
  but she didn't wake. Then they moved her, posing her again, propping her in
  nastily pornographic poses. Ian and Zacc took off their pants, their bodies
  moving into frame. Mike snapped more pictures, apparently of scenes of a threesome. 
Linsey's mouth yawned open. 
�I gotta do this,� Ian whispered. He straddled her face. 
�Not yet,� Mike hissed. 
�Fuck that,� Ian said. Balancing over her, he slid his cock into her open
  mouth, letting the head rest against her tongue. He winced. Oh man, it was
  all he could do not to throat fuck the bitch. 
�Hold it there,� Mike ordered, quickly snapping more pictures. 
�I'm going to come,� Ian grunted. There was no blow job, the head of his cock
  was simply resting in her slack mouth. But knowing he could have this bitch,
  it made his load want to explode. 
�Don't! Not in her mouth! In your hand, we don't want to leave any traces
  yet!� 
�Not in her mouth!� Zacc snarled. 
With his remaining self control, Ian pulled his cock back, and it splurged
  its load all over her face. 
A drop or two of semen fell down her throat. Linsey coughed once, body shifting
  restlessly. They froze, waiting. 
Then she licked her lips, seemed to stretch and went back to snoring. 
�Close call,� Mike said. 
�Look at the jizz on her face,� Zacc said. �Mike you gotta get some more pictures
  of that.� 
Lynsey seemed to smile angelically, as Mike photographed the semen oozing
  down her cheeks. She looked like a complete slut. Then, when the pictures were
  over, Mike got a soft damp tissues and carefully cleaned her face. It wouldn't
  do for her to wake up in the morning with her face smeared with powdery dried
  sperm. 
When he came back from disposing of the tissues. Mike found Zacc straddling
  her, preparing to come all over her tits. So he took some pictures of that,
  and of her come drenched nipples. 
They had gone as far as they could go.... 
Mike looked at his friends. 
�You know,� he said, �we could just take what we got and go. Waking her might
  be risky, want to take the chance?� 
Ian was already hard again. �Go the distance, good buddy.� 
Zacc nodded. 
�Okay,� he waved them back, so that they would be out of Lynsey's field of
  view. He sat carefully down on the bed and played with her cunt. They'd been
  fingering her lightly off and on through the photo session, and she was now
  genuinely wet. Still unconscious, her body showed all the signs of arousal,
  hard nipples, wet pussy, parting lips. 
It was part of the plan. Under the drug, she wouldn't wake to full consciousness,
  but if she roused to sexual arousal.... She would be.... Pliable for certain
  things. Docile. Even willing. Or so they had found with their experiments with
  the crack whore and the stripper. 
* * * * * * * * * 
�Lynsey,� a voice whispered in her ear, a soft gentle voice, but urgent, �Lynsey.� 
A hand on her shoulder gently rocked her. She rolled a little, her eyelids
  fluttering. Before she was aware of anything else, she knew she was horny.
  A wetness pulsed insistently between her legs. She dragged her hand roughly
  between her thighs. 
�Lynsey,� the voice insisted, �Lynsey, are you there?� 
�Whuz...� she slurred, �whuzzat?� 
Her eyes blinked slowly. There was someone there with her. Her vision was
  blurry. She couldn't make out his face, it was just black. That wasn't right.
  She frowned and tried to squint. 
�It's okay Lynsey,� the voice said, it was soft and warm and comforting. He
  stroked her shoulder. �It's okay Lynsey, relax, we're friends.� 
Friends? She couldn't think clearly, too sleepy. Friends. It was okay then.
  Lynsey tried to turn to go back to sleep, stroking her cunt absently. Come
  and then sleep. Or sleep and then come. 
�Lynsey,� the voice insisted, dragging her back to her half wakefulness. A
  hand, not her own, pressed between her legs, her thighs parted with a will
  of her own, and she purred. �Lynsey, do you want to have a little fun with
  your friend.� 
Fun? 
She was so wet. She couldn't think clearly, couldn't seem to see, but she
  felt soooo good, like a cat sunning itself on a rock. 
�Lynsey,� the voice called again, rousing her. �Smile for the camera. That's
  a good girl.� 
Camera? Over there. She smiled. �Good girl.� The voice was happy with her,
  that made her happy. 
�Lick your nipple,� the voice had to repeat two or three times before she
  understood. Gentle hands helped her to stand. She reached down and licked it. �Good
  girl,� the voice stroked her, she wanted to be a good girl, she was happy that
  the voice was happy. �Smile.� She grinned woozily. �Lick it again.� 
�Spread your cunt lips for the camera.� There it was, she smiled blearily,
  as her hands were guided down. Someone helped her sit up in position. �That's
  so sexy. You're a sexy girl aren't you.� 
Oh she was sooo wet. She would love to get fucked, her fingers clumsily pushed
  at her clit. 
�Open your mouth, Linsey.� There was a cock in front of her. She blinked. �You
  like cock, don't you Linsey.� She did? �Yes, you love it.� She nodded vaguely. �You
  want to suck this cock.� She did. �Go ahead, put it in your mouth.� Someone's
  fingers were in her cunt, making her wetter, and suddenly, she wanted that
  cock in her mouth. She bent forward, slobbering. 
She lost track of things. When she focused again, there were two cocks in
  front of her, she was stroking them both, smiling for the camera, listening
  vaguely to the click. Click, click, click. Funny camera. 
Eventually, she found herself laying back down. The voice whispering in her
  ear, hands stroking her body. �Good girl, Linsey, good girl, sleep now.� She
  was so drowsy.... 
A moment later, she was snoring softly. Her abusers watched carefully for
  a few minutes, then they carefully withdrew to share their new prizes with
  the gang. 
* * * * * * * * * * 
A lot of the pictures, more than half of them, were useless. Lynsey was too
  obviously asleep, or too obviously stoned in them, her eyes mostly glassy and
  lidded. 
But there was a picture of her staring at the camera with a slick grin as
  she worked a small vibrator in her cunt. Another close up of her face with
  a cock in her mouth where her drug induced bleariness seemed like ecstatic
  rapture. In some pictures, the slackness of the drug looked like lust or hunger,
  a sleazy heavy lidded alertness. 
Only Lynsey's face was visible in the pictures. The men were seen only by
  their cocks their bodies. Even in one shot, an apparent (but not real, they
  had yet to penetrate her) depiction of a double penetration, Linsey's face
  and form was clearly visible, laughing and moaning sandwiched between two male
  bodies, their hands on her breasts and ass, but somehow, the photograph left
  out her lovers heads. 
* * * * * * * * * 
Lynsey woke up with no memory whatsoever of the night's adventure. To her,
  it simply hadn't happened, the memories had failed to form, it wasn't even
  a dream. 
But she felt terrible. Her mouth tasted like a hangover, and her head pounded.
  She felt fuzzy and listless and out of sorts. She kept forgetting what she
  was doing. After an hour of fumbling, she decided she just couldn't handle
  going to work. Obviously, she was sick or something, best to take the day off. 
She sat back, relaxed, watched some television. After a while, she felt a
  bit better. Perhaps she'd go into work in the afternoon. She signed onto chat,
  played a little bit, revealed the name of her college. She had some more orange
  juice, and some time after that, started to feel drowsy. In an hour, she was
  back in bed. 
Chuck was calling Mike to see if they would take advantage of this. They hadn't
  expected another crack at her for at least a night or two. Of course, they
  did. 
* * * * * * * * 
Pictures mounted up, of Linsey in different poses, dressed in different combinations
  of lingerie and slutware. They got bolder, dragging her around her own apartment,
  making sure always that her surroundings were visible, but the occasional cocks
  and male bodies in the frame with her, were obscured. 
One night, she blearily found herself looking the pussy of a thirteen year
  old crack whore, cleaned up and made up to look childlike. The crack whore
  was as drugged out as Lynsey herself, neither enjoyed it much as they blearily
  stumbled and crawled over each other. Neither remembered a thing about it.
  But the group came away with a handful of very incriminating pedophile photos. 
Their crowning achievement, however, was a couple of nights later, when after
  careful coaxing, a laughing, confused, dazed Lynsey was slowly and carefully
  coaxed, without truly understanding what she was doing, into putting her mouth
  around the hard erect cock of Chuck's german shepherd, Steve. 
Lynsey, of course, had no idea of any of this. The strange �flu' that had
  struck her and left her sleepy and listless slowly passed. Feeling more like
  herself, she returned to work and spent her evenings playing on the computer,
  masturbating to shivering orgasms, and dressing, without fully realizing it,
  more and more slutty. Her wardrobe now permanently rode the bare margins of
  acceptability at work, and outside work, well, she became even raunchier. Not
  completely skanky, she had her limits that she would not pass. 
But they had steadily worked on her, pushing her out to those limits, pushing
  her to her personal edges, until she was at the precipice, at every point gone
  as far as she was willing, at the limits of her tolerance. She would not voluntarily
  go further, they knew that. 
It was finally time. 
* * * * * * * * * * * 
The Lynsey Project had gathered at a restaurant again. The champagne flowed
  freely as they toasted each other. At some point, it had all taken on a life
  of its own. It wasn't about fucking a slut, or even a rape. Lynsey's game had
  become a contest, a quest, something that had brought them together and become
  more than just the pursuit of a fuck, no matter how nasty. 
Unlike other gatherings, there would be no slaking of brutal lusts on the
  helpless body of an increasingly battered thirteen year old crack whore. It
  was finally time. 
Mike tapped his glass. �Gentlemen,� he said, �after all our hard work, the
  long hours, the sacrifices...� chuckling all around at that, �it's finally
  time. Now, we all know what comes next, but the question is who comes next.
  Well, there's only one fair way to decide....� 
He held out a fistful of straws, and one by one, they drew. 
* * * * * * * * * * * 
Lynsey wasn't expecting it when it happened. She was going to work in the
  morning, a little early, but not unusually so. She was cutting through a commercial
  parkade, as she usually did. The lot was mostly full, early morning commuters
  had packed it. She hardly thought twice about cutting through it. 
Abruptly, just as she passed the stairwell, a canvas hood slammed down over
  her head. She put up a hand to fend it. The drawstring of the hood pulled tight
  across her jaws, effectively gagging her, leaving the lower half of her jaw
  free while blinding. She tried to shriek through the hood, her arms flailing,
  struggling to tear it off. 
A brutal punch into her solar plexus knocked the wind out of her, and she
  would have folded up, except for the male arms that folded around her and dragged
  her into the stairwell. As she struggled to catch her breath, she was slammed
  up against the concrete wall, the drawstring of the hood was quickly tied into
  a tight knot. Rough hands tore away her purse, and for a second, she thought
  it was a mugging, glad that they were taking her purse because it meant he'd
  go away. 
Then she felt strong hands tearing at her blouse, ripping her bra open to
  squeeze and mangle her breasts. Her skirt was pulled up so harshly she heard
  the fabric tear. In blind panic, she tried to fight, but only had her head
  smashed against the concrete, the sharpness of the blow only slightly blunted
  by the hood. 
Abruptly, she found herself dragged down the stairs. Stumbling, almost twisting
  her ankle, she struggled now to keep some balance as her captor dragged her
  down. A door burst open, she was shoved through. Her assailant guided her floundering,
  pushing her to the left and back, and then she was slammed facedown across
  the hood of some car. She could taste automobile dust and grit on its unwashed
  surface. 
Her captor was behind her. As she caught her breath, she knew what was going
  to happen to her, what he intended. Terror washed through her. What did the
  police say? Don't resist? She felt helpless, for the first time in her life,
  things were completely out of control, and she didn't know what to do. Fight?
  What if he beat her savagely? 
He seemed to be pausing, watching her, waiting to see what she would do. Options
  shivered through her mind. Fighting was out. Running was out. 
He reached down her legs, she cringed at his touch, but didn't move. Almost
  gently, the assailant lifted her skirt, pulling it up her legs, pushing it
  up her ass until it was gathered around her hips. She gasped and chewed her
  lip, her fists clenching. 
Strong hands wound themselves into the crotch of her panties, the feel of
  rough knuckles against her vagina making her grunt. A moment of tearing cloth
  and the frail fabric, her last defense was gone. 
Lynsey blinked inside her hood, seeing only blackness. Senses sharpened by
  fear and blindness registered the way he stepped close to her. The sound of
  his zipper being slowly undone. She was aware of a moment's fumbling. Hands
  pawing at her. Denim pressing against her bared thighs. 
The rapists big hard cock slid smoothly into her cunt, making her groan. She
  had no idea, until his cock touched her lips, that she was so wet. Her body's
  lubrication had been completely involuntary, as was the wave of pleasure that
  surged up her hips as his cock thrust into her. She heard a low chuckle, and
  knew that he was registering her wetness. Horribly, Lynsey knew that he believed
  she was liking this. It was a nightmare. As his cock set up a brutal rhythm
  slamming her harshly again and again against the fender of the car, rubbing
  her clothes and flesh into the cars grime, her clit throbbed and her cunt spasmed,
  and she grunted in time to the increasing brutality of his thusts.... 
Her rapist finally finished with a series of brutal violent thrusts that left
  her thighs bruised against the unyielding metal of the car. As he came, he
  pushed his cock painfully deep and held it there, flattening her against the
  hood as he poured his last drop of semen into the waiting condom. She no longer
  even dreamed of resistance, she simply waited for it to be over. After a few
  minutes rest, he stepped back, his deflating cock falling out of her soiled
  cunt. He stepped back, tucked himself away, and then bent over her, undoing
  the tie on her hood and pulling it away. She kept her eyes shut, knowing enough
  not to look. A few footsteps, the sound of a door, and he was gone. 
Lynsey stayed where she was for a few more minutes, afraid he might come back,
  afraid he might be standing only a few feet away, watching, waiting for her
  to make a mistake, to invite a beating or further raping. Gradually, she realized
  he was really gone. But still, she couldn't quite move. She'd been raped....
  Had she really come? 
* * * * * * * * 
Lynsey staggered home and called in sick. Her office was not surprised, this
  was par for the course for her these days, inappropriate clothes at the office,
  unexplained and excessive sick days, a poor attitude. She was on thinner ice
  than she realized. 
Lynsey spent the rest of the day putting herself together and trying to figure
  out what had happened to her. Had she been raped? Of course she had, she must
  have been raped, there was no other description? But she had reached orgasm,
  that seemed so incompatible. The come made her disorientation all the more
  traumatic. Should she call the cops? That was her first impulse, but as she
  thought it over, she had nothing to give them. There was no evidence. She couldn't
  describe her assailant in any way, black, white, tall, short. She couldn't
  prove anything more than that she'd had sex in the parkade. What if they thought
  it was consensual and she was just angry with her lover, or playing some kind
  of game? What if they thought she was a slut? The more she thought about it,
  the more it seemed that going to the police was a bad idea. 
There was a bad moment, when it occurred to her that this might somehow be
  connected to the internet game she was playing. Had one of them actually tracked
  her down? Impossible! Still, the thought made her nervous, she signed on trying
  to find some sign of gloating, some indication that there was a real predator
  in her chatroom. Nothing. 
Was it all just a coincidence then? A complete, out of the blue, fluke. A
  random event that had nothing to do with her life, something meaningless and
  transient, and therefore without consequences. So it might just as well be
  that she never got raped, she never came, nothing happened, move along. 
In a week, she'd just about convinced herself. She forced her life back to
  normal, even played her dirty games on the internet where it was safe and she
  could always log off. The only change in her life was that her wardrobe became
  more conservative. No more slutting around in public. After all, why take chances? 
* * * * * * * * * * 
�Hey,� the man said, �don't I know you?� 
Lynsey flinched a little. Since the rape, she'd become a little shy in public,
  less willing to talk to strangers, especially men. 
�I don't think so.� 
The man wouldn't let it go. 
�I'm pretty sure I do. You look familiar.� He turned to his companion, �Don't
  she look familiar.� 
He stepped closer to her. She watched him warily. 
�I really don't think...� 
�Working girl,� he snapped his fingers. 
�What?� 
�You're one of the working girls, down on the stroll. I knew I'd seen you
  around.� 
�You're mistaken.� 
�On the skytrain, I'd see you all the time. You were something hot. I remember
  that one time, you were wearing this tiny bikini top, and this little miniskirt...� 
Lynsey blushed bright red. She remembered that outfit, remembered wearing
  it on the skytrain. Oh god, she thought, he must have really seen me there.
  He thinks I'm a whore. 
�Oh man, you gave me such a boner. I always wanted to give you a good pounding,
  ain't that right, didn't I say that?� He asked his companion. The bigger man
  nodded quietly, seemingly only half interested. 
�There must be a some mistake,� she said, not very convincingly. 
�Look at that blush,� he said, �yeah honey, its you. I don't forget a nice
  set of tits.� 
All at once, a thought seemed to hit him, he became almost apologetic. 
�But hey, am I bothering you? Sorry,� he said. 
�Well, yes. You see....� 
�Oh, you got a client?� 
�A client?� Then she realized he was asking if she was going out to turn a
  trick, to have sex for money. �Oh, no. No client.� 
�No? Well, honey, it's your lucky day. You got one now.� He stepped in and
  put his arm around her waist, pulling and guiding her out of the stream of
  pedestrian traffic. The gesture flustered her, and for a second, she was speechless. 
�What? No wait. I mean...� 
�Not to worry babe,� the man said, �I got cash on hand, this is a COD transaction,
  I promise. Don't let money worry you.� 
She tried to pull away, but his arm around her hip held her fast. His companion
  was on the other side of her now, hemming her in. There seemed no choice but
  to walk the way they were leading her. 
�No, that's not it,� she said, �the thing is...� 
�Thirty bucks,� he said, �that's the going rate the streets you work.� 
�Thirty?� She'd never thought it would be so cheap. 
�Here,� he said, �let me carry that for you.� 
He slipped her purse off her shoulder. 
�Wait,� she said, reaching for it. 
�Ian,� the man said, handing the purse out of reach, �be a gentleman for once,
  carry the ladies things.� 
They ignored her ineffectual pleadings. Instead, the man who'd captured her
  kept up a stream of patter. 
�My name is Peter by the way. What's yours... What.... Well, suit yourself,
  most girls don't give their real name, but you know, a �stage' name is good
  for business. So how long you been fucking.... Hey, Ian, listen to this, what
  a kidder.... I bet she tells us she's a virgin.... Not a virgin? I'm not surprised...
  Hey, I don't mean nothing by it.� 
Abruptly, she realized that there were no people around. They'd led her out
  of the pedestrian traffic down this empty alley. She felt helpless and vulnerable,
  frightened. 
The alley turned a corner, they lead her into a little cul de sac, sheltered
  by a dumpster. She walked on legs that felt like water. It was oddly dreamlike,
  try as she might, she couldn't seem to walk away. 
�Well,� Peter said, shoving a couple of bills into her purse, �here we are.
  It ain't the ritz, but I'm sure that you've done worse in nastier, or vice
  versa.� 
Ian laughed at the casual contemptuousness of it, laughed at her stricken
  expression. �Let's get down to business.� 
Too late, Lynsey found her courage. 
�No,� she said. 
�No?� Peter asked. �No?� Ian said, �You want to go somewhere else?� 
�No, I've.... I've changed my mind. I'm not going to do it. I want to go.� 
Out of nowhere Peter backhanded her, half her face went all pins and needles,
  her jaw rocked and she was slammed up against the brick wall. 
�You fucking cock tease!� Peter snarled. �You took the fucking money, now
  you are going to walk away.� 
�The money?� She remembered the money they'd shoved in her purse. �No, that's
  not it,� she burbled, � you can have the money, I don't want it.� 
Peter backhanded her again. 
�My money's not good enough for you?� He snapped. She blinked. 
�No, that's not it, it's just...� 
�Just what? You figured you'd just take our fucking money and walk, is that
  it?� 
�No, I just don't want to...� 
�Why'd you come on to us bitch?� Peter yelled at her. 
Come on to them? Lynsey was dissolving in confusion, she hadn't come on to
  them, had she? She wasn't sure. They were saying she did. This was all a horrible
  misunderstanding. She had to make them understand. 
�Please,� she whimpered, �I didn't mean to. I didn't want to come on to you,
  I'm sorry.� 
�I'm not good enough for you?� Peter glanced at Ian, an expression of astonishment
  writ on his face. �Listen to this, this two-bit slag is too good for us.� 
His body tensed, fist clenching. Lynsey quailed with terror. Peter pushed
  her hard against the wall, his fist cocked. She whimpered. 
�Are you saying you are too good to fuck us, is that what you are saying?� 
�No,� Lynsey squeaked. 
Peter paused, still looking mean. 
�No what?� 
�No...� Lynsey felt her way through it, �I'm not too good to fuck you.� 
�Fuck us both?� 
�I'm not too good to fuck you both.� 
�You came on to us?� 
�I'm sorry I came on to you.� 
�You took the money.� 
�Yes.� 
Peter let go, abruptly, Lynsey stumbled, struggling to keep her balance on
  legs that felt like water. She was shaking. Horribly, she was aware her panties
  were soaked. That she could have a reaction like that in a situation like this
  appalled her. 
�So,� Peter winked at Ian, before turning back to her, �what's the problem?� 
Trapped in the alley, cornered by his words and her own fear, Lynsey did the
  only thing she could. 
�No problem,� she whispered, her throat dry. �No problem.� 
She surrendered. 
Peter and Ian grinned. 
�Excellent,� Peter said. �Now we're communicating. I believe in communication,
  don't you? Well, the money has changed hands, the meeting of the minds is achieved,
  nothing to do now but the nasty. So what's your name slut?� 
�My name...� 
�Fuck, nice tits, but you're kind of retarded. Check her purse Ian.� 
�L.. Lynn! My name is Lynn!!� 
�Lynn?� Peter sounded it out. �That's a nice slutty name? You feeling slutty,
  Lynn?� 
She hesitated, knowing there was no way out, before finally conceding, �Yes.� 
�That's great! See, Ian, I can spot sluts. She's just aching to go, can you
  smell her cunt? Yeah, she's ready. So slut, show us what we bought?� 
�What?� Lynsey couldn't get her head around his words. Show? 
A flicker of terrifying irritation showed on his face. 
�Put on a show, you dumb fucking slag! Do I have to smash your face? Show
  us your fucking tits.� 
Quickly, with badly shaking hands, Lynsey tore at her jacket top. Unable to
  manipulate a button, she simply tore it off, opening the jacket and then undoing
  the blouse with hasty motions. She pushed her bra up over her breasts. 
�Nice titties,� Peter said, coming close. �Hey, you know what gets me hot,
  seeing a slut bite and suck her nipples. Bite and suck them, bitch.� 
She did as she was told, her teeth tearing into her sensitive flesh. 
�Look at her go,� Ian said. �She's a hot one all right.� 
�Yeah she is,� Peter replied. �Dance around a bit, bitch, do a striptease
  for your paying customers. Touch yourself a lot, make it a show.� 
Clumsily, she began dancing for them, undoing her clothes awkwardly, trying
  to climb out of them. Her eyes moist. 
�Smile bitch, act like you're liking it.� 
Lynsey smiled, working the skirt down over her hips. It pooled around her
  ankles and she stepped out of it, remembering to shimmy. 
�Show us your ass.� 
She turned, rolling her ass cheeks. Not looking at them was easier, she clutched
  her breasts and stared at the brick wall. A harsh voice intruded on her. 
�Hook your thumbs into those panties,� it ordered, �roll it down really slow.� 
She did as she was ordered, working the panties down her thighs. She knew
  as she bent over that they could see her pussy. They jammed around her knees,
  and she had to bend even lower to let them slide past her calves. A cold breeze
  slid around her thighs as she realized that she was bottomless, she had exposed
  herself for them, without even a trace of resistance. She hated herself, hated
  her submission. A tear rolled down her cheek. 
�Fucking dance, Bitch!� A voice snapped her reverie. She jumped and began
  to wiggle her ass. 
As she performed, Peter asked Ian, �So, how you want to do it? One at a time,
  or two on one. Two on one is faster.� 
�I dunno,� Ian said. �Fast is best, I suppose.� 
�Cool, which end you want? Keep dancing bitch, show us your pussy.� 
�Look at that: Shaved! She's really a fucking whore, isn't she? I dunno, fucking
  her mouth I suppose, probably tighter than her pussy.� 
Another tear trickled down Lynsey's cheek. 
�Sounds good, I'll pound that shaved slit. I don't want to catch anything,
  get us a couple of rubbers out of her purse.� 
She was shocked into stillness when Ian simply upended the contents of her
  purse out onto the filthy ashpalt. 
�Keep fucking dancing you stupid cunt,� Peter yelled. She jumped and started
  shaking her ass again. 
�No rubbers.� 
�Stupid skank.� 
�No big deal, I got one, you can use it.� 
�You're a buddy! What about you?� 
�No big deal, I'll just shoot my load down her throat.� 
�Good enough, showtime! Down on all fours, slag.� 
Lynsey crouched down, unwilling to fully prostrate herself. Ian grabbed her
  soft lanky blond hair and yanked her to her knees, forcing her head down. His
  pants were stained, she could smell his crotch, thick with the odour of sour
  urine. 
Peter kneeled behind her. 
�Oh man, you should feel this,� as he rudely used his fingers to violate her
  cunt. �Bitch is fucking dripping. I bet she likes it a little rough, gets her
  going really good.� 
Lynsey could only mew as his fingers painfully manipulated her towards orgasm. 
�Please,� she whimpered. 
�Please what,� Peter asked, pushing his fingers hard against her clit. 
Lynsey's answer was lost in an inarticulate howl as the orgasm hit her. She
  lost muscle control, collapsing on the filthy garbage strewn alley. Over her,
  she heard Peter and Ian chuckling and felt shame. 
They let her rest a moment, and then pulled her into position. Her hands scrabbled
  for purchase on the slimy dirt strewn concrete. Bits and pieces of stone bit
  into her knees. Peter held her ass, and shoved his cock brutally into her cunt,
  fucking without finesse. She gasped as she felt his hardness surge into her,
  for a second, her breath caught and her mouth gaped open with his fucking,
  gulping like a fish. Ian, after a second, wrapped his fingers in her hair and
  started throat fucking her. His grip on her hair was tight and painful, the
  odour of his crotch filled her nostrils, and his hard rod stabbed and tore
  at the back of her throat. Between them, Lynsey gagged, her body heaving, but
  she was trapped and helpless. 
The harsh fucking went on and on. They forced another orgasm from her body
  before Peter came. Ian brutally used her throat before shooting his load, refusing
  to release her until she swallowed every drop. 
�Oh gee,� Peter said, as she lay gasping, prostrate on the pave. �Damn, looks
  like we ruined your clothes. Sorry bitch.� 
Lynsey turned her head. Her expensive, conservative skirt and blouse and jacket
  was now smeared with dirt, torn, soiled with urine. Peter shook his cock off,
  and tucked it away. 
�I feel bad,� he announced. 
�S'okay,� Lynsey said dully. She just wanted it to be over. 
�Nah,� Peter said, �you can't go around like that. Tell you what, you stay
  with my friend here, and I'll go get you something to wear. There's a value
  village right by.� 
He walked off. Lynsey looked up at the remaining man, Ian, hoping for more
  mercy. 
Ian grinned down at her. His cock hung loose and lanky from his pants. He
  reached down and loosed a stream of pure urine that landed mere inches from
  her face. Lynsey flinched away. 
�You know what?� he said. �I think you'd look real good, licking my boots
  with your tongue.� 
Beaten, without a shred of hope or resistance in her. Lynsey crawled forward.
  When she reached him, she looked up a final time, hoping for a shred of compassion.
  There wasn't any. 
She stuck her tongue out and ran it along the leather toe of his boot... It
  was dirty, she could feel the dirt, the grit on her tongue. It had a taste
  like mud. 
�That's it,� he said, �put your tongue into it.� 
She lapped at the boot, her tongue working away the grit, smoothing the leather.
  She wanted to vomit, but instead, she obediently licked away, sticking her
  tongue out and giving the filthy boots long wet licks. Once in a while, she
  dared to look up at him, and then glanced quickly away at the cruelty she saw
  in his eyes. Her tongue stained brown, it tasted foul, but she still licked.
  There were small boot smears all around her lips. His boots started to shine
  with her spit. 
She was still licking his boots when Peter came back. 
�Got something,� he announced cheerfully, dumping the contents of a bag at
  her feet. She stared at the cheap, gaudily covered rags. 
The clothes turned out to be a short, tight sequinned dress, half the sequins
  fallen away, undersized, with a rip in the side. It was strapless, and it kept
  slipping down, exposing her nipples. But pulling it up exposed her ass. There
  were a pair of dirty white stockings that went with it. She looked like a very
  cheap hooker. 
They stayed with her, making sure she applied make up. Then Peter left. Ian
  walked her to the skytrain, accompanied her on it. She felt a bottomless shame
  as the other passengers got on and saw her, trashy make up, revealing slut
  dress, dirty, filthy, smelly, hair disheveled. She'd become one of those worn
  slags that she used to watch. Passengers got on and off, she came to her stop,
  but when she tried to get up, Ian shook his head. She sat, still imprisoned
  by their domination of her will. They rode the skytrain to the end of the line
  and back, and finally Ian let her off one stop away from her destination. 
Finally freed, she reached the street and searched her purse for change and
  money to call a cab. But her purse was only full of cheap make up, some scattered
  ID, and condoms both new and used. 
It was an hour and a half of walking, and one tortuous hitchike before she
  finally made it home. She drew a hot bath and crawled in, soothing her aching
  body, gently washing the grit from her knees and palms. Eventually, she eased
  herself into bed and laid there staring at the ceiling for half an hour before
  the tears came, and she sobbed herself to sleep. 
* * * * * * * * * * 
She didn't go to work for the next few days. Instead, she stayed in her apartment.
  Again, she thought of calling the police. But it was only a faint idea, she
  was terrified that the police would interpret it as an act of prostitution.
  What if they didn't care? What if they blamed her? She simply couldn't take
  that chance. Alone, she could deal with it, but she couldn't deal with what
  they might think of her. 
She couldn't believe how easily it had happened, how easily she'd been lead
  to it, how little resistance she had offered. She stared at herself in the
  mirror, trying to understand how she had been such a pushover. 
It had seemed to her then, and now, that it had all been inevitable, that
  each step had lead inexorably to the next, with no way off and no way out.
  It disturbed her that she had responded so strongly when it happened. It disturbed
  her that she involuntarily became wet thinking about it. 
For a while, her life derailed. But circumstances have their own demands.
  She had to leave the apartment to go to work, to buy food, to pay bills. Her
  trips outside the apartment were now furtive expeditions. Four days later,
  it happened again. 
She was walking down the street when a car pulled up beside her. She glanced
  at it warily, now almost uniformly suspicious. 
�Hey,� Jack said. 
Lynsey stared at the barrel of the pistol pointing at her, frozen. 
�Get in the car,� Jack ordered. �Back door, driver's side.� 
Terrified, she stepped to the curb, opened the back door, and slid in. Her
  eyes never left the pistol. 
�Shut the door.� 
As the door slammed shut, Jack swivelled around. There was an instant when
  the pistol wasn't pointed at her. She was frozen. 
�Look down,� Jack instructed. 
She tore her gaze away from the barrel of the gun. Down at her feet were two
  pairs of handcuffs. 
�You see them? Good. Now, I want you to take your shoes off, I want you barefoot.
  Got that? Good. Now, next, I want you to put the cuffs around your ankles.
  No, it doesn't matter which set. There you go. Good girl. Now, put the other
  pair of cuffs around your wrists. There you go� 
Jack smiled. She was almost completely compliant, with only bare hesitations.
  Why was that, he wondered? All that subliminal training in obedience on the
  net? Or the softening up of the others? He didn't care, this was his turn. 
�Now, I want you to lay down. No, not on the seat. I want you to lay face
  down in the foot area in front of the seat. No, bend your knees, your legs
  can stick straight up. Work yourself a little forward. That's it....� 
Once she was wedged in, he covered her over with a blanket. And then, whistling
  tunelessly, he put the car back in gear and started driving. 
Lynsey's face was pressed into the harsh artificial carpet in the passenger
  wells. The transmission hump raised her hips. She barely had any leverage.
  As he whistled, she could hear street noises outside. She knew he hadn't shut
  the window. 
He hadn't gagged her. All she had to do was shout. She fantasized him pulling
  up to a policecar, and her giving out a piercing scream. Perhaps heaving up
  enough to open the door, tumble out, and go hopping away, shouting for help.
  A million scenarios of rescue and escape rolled through her head, all beginning
  with a scream, a cry for help. 
Not a peep escaped her lips. She was too frightened to utter a sound. 
Instead, she just laid there, staring at the carpet, hating herself for her
  weakness and her fear. While the car drove and drove, turned right and then
  left, paused and accelerated. 
Jack drove carefully. The last thing he needed was to call attention to himself.
  Get stopped by the cops, and the whole thing would be up. His route home was
  direct, but not reckless. Still, he breathed a sigh of relief when he finally
  arrived at his house. 
He activated the door opener for the attached garage. Once he was inside,
  he could get her into the house, into the basement, without anyone seeing her.
  He'd often taken whores into his house that way, and once in a while, a semi-unwilling
  victim. 
He chuckled, imagining the look on her face when she saw his basement. 
He pulled in, waited for the door to shut, and then cut the engine. Then,
  he stepped out, straightened his jacket, and walked with deceptive calmness
  to the passenger side back door. 
The bitch was finally his. He'd seen her naked in photographs, watched her
  shower and masturbate on computer cam, he'd even fondled and posed her semi-conscious
  body. But this was different. Finally, he had her in his unfettered, unlimited
  possession. He ached to put some marks on her. 
He opened the door and pulled her out, gratified by the way she struggled
  forward, as if to help him. 
�Please,� she whimpered. �Don't do this. I can't take it.� 
Her eyes were full of tears. He ignored them and plunged his hand into her
  top, roughly mauling one breast. Finding an already hard nipple, he twisted
  it savagely, stopping her whining and causing her to draw a terrified breath. 
�Slut,� he said easily. �All the way over here, you could have screamed, and
  you didn't. Even now, you don't make a peep. You want this.� 
From the way she blushed, he knew he had scored a point. What the hell, maybe
  she really did want it. He didn't care. What she wanted didn't matter. The
  only thing that mattered, as she was going to find out, was what he wanted. 
For a while, he amused himself fondling her stiff but unresisting body. He
  exposed her breasts and pawed them, raking fingernails down to leave red marks.
  He pushed her slacks down to her ankles and caressed the smooth flesh of her
  thighs, probed the wet folds of her cunt. 
Cuffed at wrists and ankles, she had no choice but to take it, to accept the
  indignities he inflicted upon her. She could only precariously try to keep
  her balance. 
Finally, he uncuffed her ankles, allowing her to walk. 
�Follow me,� he said, brandishing the gun. She followed willingly, he was
  amused that he didn't even have to drag her. She walked into the house, followed
  him awkwardly down the stairs. He'd left one cuff at her ankle to flop loosely
  around. 
She caught only a glimpse of the house from the corner of her eye, as she
  descended the stairs. Down there, it was a full scale dungeon, with gray concrete
  walls, wooden pillars, a sloping floor with a drain in the center and a chain
  link fence section dividing it. Lynsey stopped, overcome with a powerful urge
  to flee. 
A hard shove propelled her forward, she stumbled, almost falling, staggering
  to the center of the room. She almost fell over, but he was right behind her,
  pulling her ass into his hips. Grabbing her hair, he yanked her upright, then
  lifted her cuffed hands quickly, setting them into a hook hanging from a cord
  in the ceiling. It all happened so fast, Lynsey barely registered the hook
  clamping shut on her handcuff chain. And then he pulled the rope tight, and
  she found herself jerked up onto her toes, dangling from the hook, her body
  almost suspended. She twisted on her toes. 
Jack walked in front of her, she wouldn't meet his eyes. He grabbed her hair
  and slapped her face twice, the sound of his hand on her flesh, the stinging
  in his palm, made his cock leap. 
�Look at me,� he ordered. 
She looked, eyes wide with terror. She was panting, slightly flushed. He slid
  his hand into her blouse, pulling her breast out, pleased to note the hardness
  in her nipples. 
�Are you afraid,� he said. 
She swallowed. A dry sound died in her throat, and she nodded quickly, never
  taking her eyes off him. Perfect, he thought. Man, he was going to pound this
  bitch. 
�Here's how it works,� he told her, �you do exactly as you are told, exactly.
  You do every fucking thing you're told, and you do it like you like it....
  And maybe it doesn't get any worse... Fuck around.... And I guarantee it will
  get worse, a lot worse. Worse than you can imagine...� 
He laughed. Enjoying the surge of fear, the way she struggled to catch a breath.
  Oh he might do her again, he thought, but never again like this. This was too
  perfect. 
He wondered if she was dripping. He wondered if he reached below, he'd find
  her thighs slick. If he reached a little higher, her panties soaking. Reach
  in, and feel soft pliable wetness... 
�Understand?� He slapped her again. 
She nodded desperately, finally choking out a �y.. Y... Yes!� 
He smiled benignly. More than any of the others, Jack was a genuine sadist.
  He truly liked to inflict pain. His partner in agony was a sexual thrill for
  him. For others, it was the rape, the conquest, the degradation, the punishment.
  He respected all that. He just liked to make it hurt. 
Fortunately or unfortunately for Lynsey, their agreement meant that he couldn't
  take her completely apart, the way he did with some of his victims. No real
  scars, no massive bruises. But that still left a lot to work with. And, fortunately
  or unfortunately for Lynsey, he was well acquainted with the techniques for
  forcing orgasms from bodies in agony. 
�Well then, just relax, we're going to have a lot of fun. Hell, if you keep
  the rule in mind, you'll even enjoy some of it...� 
He stepped around her, enjoying the way she dangled from the hook. It was
  just slightly too high, leaving her perpetually wobbling on tip toes. He fondled
  her breasts through the fabric of her clothes, making her wince as he found
  and pinched her nipples. His hands traveled down her blouse settling around
  her hips. He swung her around, she was so delicately balanced that she couldn't
  resist the simple pressure. For a while, he busied himself caressing her ass,
  working her skirt up her thighs until the two pale globes were exposed. 
He slapped them hard, shoving her until she lost her balance and swung free
  for a second, dangling from her stretched arms, until she could again find
  her balance on tiptoes. 
�You like it, don't you,� he said, and ripped her blouse open, glorying in
  the sound of buttons popping, fabric tearing. The violence of the act made
  her squeal in fear. He reached between her breasts, pulling the bra out. Her
  breasts were squashed up and forward, the bra straps cutting into her flesh,
  she grunted with discomfort. Then the clasp snapped and the bra flopped open,
  exposing her heaving breasts and hard nipples. 
Lynsey was panting harshly, partly fear, Jack thought, partly lust. The signs
  of involuntary arousal were all over her body. He stepped around behind, amused
  when she tried to tip toe away, to escape him. 
�You can't go anywhere, bitch,� he laughed, and amused himself slapping her
  body, provoking squeals and whimpers. Then he reached down to the hem of her
  skirt, grasped firmly and pulled. The fabric tore with a ripping sound all
  the way up to the waist, where the heavy stitching held. He worked his fingers
  into the wasteband and pulled, yanking her off balance and making her shriek.
  Another savage yank and the ruined skirt was gone. 
He swung her around, her wrists twisting painfully. She was now half naked,
  only scraps of fabric clinging to her arms and shoulders. Her naked breasts
  were heaving, her bare legs shivering as she struggled to maintain herself
  on tiptoes of bare feet. 
�Please,� she whimpered, �I'm begging...� 
�You don't have to beg for it,� he assured her, �I'm happy to do it.� 
His fingers slid down between her legs, exploring her satin panties with an
  uncharacteristic gentle fluttering touch. He traced the outlines of her labia
  through her panties, noting the signs of wetness permeating the fabric. He
  loosely cupped her pubic mound. 
�Mmmm nice panties,� he said, �you've got good taste.� 
His fingers slowly gathered the fabric at her pubic mound, pulling the central
  strip between her legs into a narrow cloth band. He wrapped it in his fist,
  twisting until it was a harsh strip of cloth stretched tight between her labia,
  spreading her lips open and abrading her clit. He pulled higher, she seemed
  to go further up on tip toes, wincing. 
�Good fabric, eh,� Jack said, �strong. I like that. Let's see how much it
  can take.� 
Enjoying her whimpering, he pulled the twisted fabric tighter and higher,
  until she was literally dancing on tip toes. It continued to hold, he pulled
  higher, giving it little yanks and twists to increase her discomfort. She started
  begging again, which only made him laugh, and then she started to screech. 
Finally, with a sudden whip snap, the fabric let go. Lynsey, released from
  agony, simply dropped, bouncing on her shoulders. 
Jack reached down and started fingering her bared cunt. 
�You're wet,� he whispered as she turned her face away, refusing to look at
  him, trying to blot it all out. He allowed her to squeeze her eyes shut, to
  try and shut herself off. It wasn't going to work of course. He might slap
  her, scare her, insist that she make eye contact. But it was much better to
  invade her through her skin, through her cunt. Try as she might shut him out,
  she couldn't shut out his fingers now gentle between her legs, massaging her
  labia, stroking her clit. He bent down to her breast, and rolled his tongue
  around her nipple, sucking it in and massaging it gently with his mouth, nibbling
  just enough to ensure the stimulation was inescapable. 
His body came close to hers, pressing her to him, bending her to his manly
  warmth. A free hand snaked around her ass, caressing it. Jack was gentle, letting
  her fear and distress ebb, replacing it with an odd, unwanted stimulation.
  When he was sure her sighs had turned completely to pleasure, when she was
  actually writhing against him, giving herself submissively to his touches,
  he stopped. Walked away, and turned off the lights, leaving her dangling in
  the dark, aroused and helpless. 
He wanted her to stew a bit. So he went upstairs, made a few phone calls.
  Leisurely he stripped down, stroking his cock luxuriously. He went into his
  bedroom, looked through a collection of floggers, belts, tools and clamps.
  Mostly unnecessary, he already knew what he wanted to do, and had all the right
  implements already laid out in the basement. But he'd saved his whipping choice
  until he could gage the quality of her skin. 
It wouldn't do to leave her massively bruised or scarred he thought. Not this
  time. After all, there were two more rapists who would want relatively undamaged
  goods. They were all in this together, and much as he would have liked to hurt
  her, he liked his new pals better and had no wish to piss in their pool, as
  it were. 
He chose a big wide belt, with small holes drilled through its business end.
  Too short to really get whip action going, more than a simple paddle, too wide
  to really bruise her. It would hurt like hell, he could imagine the way it
  would make her flesh feel, like splashes full of pins and needles. His cock
leaped. 
He grabbed the big bowie knife, popped a stick of gum, and headed back downstairs. 
The lights came on suddenly, harsh and electric, stinging her eyes and making
  her blink. She looked up, and there he was in the doorway, grinning, naked,
  his erection rampant, holding a huge knife in one hand, and a belt in the other.
  Lynsey started screaming in panic, jumping and dancing on her hook in a hopeless
  attempt to flee. 
�Scared,� he whispered, coming close to her. He held the cold metal of the
  knife blade against her cheek. Her screams suppressed to blubbering whimpers.
  For a while, he enjoyed feeling her tremble and jerk as he slid the knife over
  her body, the tip pressing into her nipples, the flat sliding against her belly,
  her thighs. Once he drew the dull (not that she knew which edge it was) edge
  up between her lips, sliding it against her clit. Every now and then, he would
  cut away a bit more of her remaining clothes until she was completely naked. 
�I'm tired of teasing with the the knife,� he whispered in her ear as she
  shivered. Really, it was just foreplay for him, he liked pain more than terror. �Now,
  we can do a couple of things. We can get a bit more creative... A little bloodwork?
  You seem to really respond to the knife, it gets you hot, I can tell. So you
  may be up for that.... Or I can whip you with the belt. What would you like?
  Your choice?� 
Lynsey shivered. �The b.. B... Belt...� 
�What was that, I didn't hear. Did you say the knife?� 
�The belt, the belt!� 
�Ahhh, okay. You really want it?� 
�Y... Yes.� 
Jack smiled. He was going to enjoy this. 
�Okay. But only if you really, really want it. You have to want it, or we'll
  just go back to the knife.� 
Lynsey whimpered. Anything was better than the knife, the thought of how much
  further that might go terrified her. 
�The belt...� she whimpered, �I want you to beat me with the belt.� 
�Will you push your ass out for the belt? Will you offer up your tits? Dance
  around and beg for it?� 
�Yes! Yes! Yes!� 
Jack laughed, folding the belt in his hands. �Okay, but let's not get too
  out of hand. Only thirty lashes. How's that?� 
�Thirty lashes, yes!� 
�Good enough, now Lynsey,� he said, �I'm not good at counting, so you'll have
  to count. I'll trust you, but if I think you've fucked me around, well, I'll
  just fucking hurt you. And I'd appreciate it if you'd keep your counting to
  yourself. I find it really distracting, and stupid to hear counting out loud.� 
He made Lynsey beg for it. He made her bend on tiptoes, begging him to lay
  the belt across her up thrust ass, she offered her breasts. Sometimes, he'd
  have her spread her legs, begging for it across the ass, and then just for
  the hell of it, snap the belt up between her lets, trying to lash her clit.
  She screamed and screeched again and again, taking some blows with only a grunt,
  others with a piglike squeal. He threw off her counting several times. 
Finally, around fifty strokes, when he judged she couldn't take any more,
  around fifty strokes, he let out the rope she was suspended from. Lynsey sagged
  to her knees, too exhausted even to sob. Her sides heaved as she panted like
  a dog. Jack let out even more slack, and she eased forward onto knees and elbows,
  head bowed. Her naked body was shining, the flesh reddened everywhere in streaks
  and smears, her body dripping with sweat. 
She looked perfectly fuckable, Jack thought, with those shivering, J-Low ass
  cheeks all round and waiting for a cock between them, her blonde hair limp
  and hanging over her face, nipples brushing the concrete floor. Jack slipped
  on a pair of kneepads and grabbed his �fun' bottle. 
Then he stepped up and knelt behind her, running his hands gently over her
  trembling ass. He reached down, drawing a finger up her cunt, pleased at her
  sopping wetness. He'd worked hard to make sure that she stayed wet and ready,
  to make sure that in all the pain and humiliation, that her body was mechanically
  stimulated. 
�Hey Lynsey,� he said, cupping her cunt, the shock of his touch made her involuntarily
  push herself onto his hand, �how about a nice fuck, and we call it a day?� 
A day? Call it a day? An end to this? Suddenly, a doorway had opened, an escape
  hatch, and Lynsey, in her desperate exhausted condition saw only a single choice.
  She leaped for it. 
�Yes,� she cried, �yes, yes, fuck me.� Fuck me and call it a day, it would
  be over. 
�Good enough,� Jack grunted. His cock poked at her lips, and she thrust herself
  back on his cockhead. But he wasn't quite ready yet. Instead, he filled his
  hands with the liquid from his fun bottle, rubbing it in. Then he grabbed Lynsey's
  rope, still hooked to her handcuffs, and pulled savagely. Her wrists were drawn
  painfully back to her shoulder blades, face sliding up against concrete. His
  free hand, he jammed up against her cunt, massaging it, working the stinging
  rubbing alcohol/aftershave mix in deep into the tender flesh. Lynsey's scream
  was earsplitting, the agony unlike anything she had known. 
Jack thrust his cock into her wildly spasming cunt, and humped her savagely
  for a few dozen desperate thrusts, until finally, shooting an explosive load
  into her defenseless cunt. There was no condom, she realized, she could in
  her agony, feel his seed invading her. 
Jack couldn't care less, he wanted to ride her bareback. He figured she was
  disease free. If she wasn't, well... He could always cut her nipples off as
  punishment later. And as for pregnancy? Her problem, not his. It could be dealt
  with. 
Even in her pain and disorientation, this added to her stress as she thought
  about diseases and pregancy. Horrified, she realized she was coming, the combination
  of physical stress and emotional degradation had tripped a masochistic switch
  in her, and a convulsive orgasm overtook her tormented body. 
After he shot his load, he stood up and looked her over. Oh he'd noted the
  orgasm, it pleased him. The bitch had been so hot, he'd lost control towards
  the end, had not had it together enough to make sure she came as he'd wanted.
  But he was pleased to see that she'd taken care of that herself. 
She looked so utterly defeated, so totally used, that he could almost feel
  his cock stirring again. Definitely, there would be a round two. This bitch,
  he thought, looked so delicious, that he had to save these moments for posterity.
  He ran upstairs, got his digital camera. When he returned, she was still lying
  in position. He took a few pictures from different angles, including a lovely
  one of his semen leaking from her reddened cunt. And then, inspired, he got
  Lynsey to do some posing, offering up her breasts and ass, spreading her legs,
  alternating between submissive and pornographic postures. Her smile, of course,
  was completely and obviously false. No one who looked at those blasted eyes,
  the strained features, the grimace, could ever believe that these were voluntary
  pictures or that she was enjoying herself. But for Jack, that simply added
  to them. 
Time for a break, he thought. He secured her to his fucking table, a large
  linen covered platform that was angled for easy use. Kind of like that table
  that they always brought Frankenstein to life on. After all, he didn't want
  her getting in trouble. He went upstairs, this time leaving the light on, just
  so she could think about what might come next. 
Upstairs, Jack took a shower, then signed onto the net, transmitting digital
  images as an unexpected bonus to his waiting and eager audience. He chatted
  for a while, discussing what would come next. They had some very interesting
  ideas for afterwards that made his cock hard. 
Lynsey glanced up as Jack came downstairs. 
�Okay,� Jack told her gleefully, holding out his piercing needles, �this is
  for all the marbles.� 
Lynsey stared her eyes wild, whites rolling, at the brutal skewers he was
  approaching her with. He set them down on the bench beside her. 
�Please,� she begged. �Oh god, please don't do this.� 
�Oh bitch,� he said, �you're going to love this.� 
She thrashed in panic, her hips lifting from the bench. But he easily caught
  them and maneuvered his hard cock into her, penetrating her. He began thrusting,
  his hands mangling her now swollen and aching breasts. 
Despite herself, she responded, her body getting wet, her cunt sending signals
  of pleasure. Oh god, she told herself, just fuck him, fuck him good and maybe
  he won't do any more. Please him... and a part of her was thinking, oh this
  is good. Fuck me good. 
�Ready?� he asked. 
He picked up a small metal object that had accompanied the skewers. She'd
  barely noticed it in the company of the terrifying needles. He reached down
  between their legs, pulling his cock back until only the head was within. His
  fingers deftly found and manipulated her clit, seizing and pulling it. 
There was a savage saw toothed tightness gripping her and she screamed with
  shock and pain. Her body spasmed, intense sensations like and unlike orgasm
  shot up and down her spine. She'd never felt anything like it. 
�Clit clamp,� Jack exclaimed, �I thought you'd like it.� 
Clit clamp? Oh god. Suddenly, it rocketed clearly in her mind. The elaborate
  set up, the sequence of tortures, it was all so familiar. 
�You're from the chat,� she squealed. 
�Of course,� Jack said grinning, �what did you think?� 
He rammed his cock hard into her, grinding against the clit clamp, pushing
  it against their two bodies. She shrieked, her next words forgotten. 
�Wild isn't it,� he smiled at her thrashing body, twisting her nipples as
  he humped her fiercely. Each pelvic thrust brought paroxysms of sexual agony
  through the clit clamp. �Don't worry though, it ain't gonna come loose in the
  fucking. It'll tear your clit off before it lets go.� 
He jammed her especially hard for emphasis. 
�Oh God!� Lynsey shrieked. She couldn't get a train of thought together, each
  pelvic thrust, each sexual invasion of her cunt, each stab of agony in her
  clit, derailed her. But even so, she was struck by how she had masturbated
  to this scenario in the chatroom, and to others like it, and then he'd thrust,
  and the train would start up again, like a broken record, skipping and skipping 
�Oh man,� he grunted, �you are good. I can feel your wet cunt grabbing me,
  tightening around me every time I jam you. You're one hot piece of ass.� 
Jack fucked her steadily, working himself up to orgasm, pushing her with alternate
  waves of pain and pleasure. 
It was coming close. Time for the big finish, he decided. 
He shoved his cock in deep and held it there, laying his weight on her. The
  new pressure on her clit clamp made her forget about her aching nipples, about
  the stings and slaps, she simply shook and spasmed and struggled. 
Lynsey didn't notice as he reached for one of the piercing needles and a cork.
  Gingerly, trying not to draw her attention, he laid the cork against her raw
  and swollen nipple. 
�Say cheese,� he said and suddenly rammed the heavy piercing needle, the largest
  gauge he could get away with, through the deep fleshy part of her nipple, embedding
  it deep in the cork. 
The pain ripped through Lynsey, drawing her away for a shocking moment, from
  the agony of the clit clamp. She stared in absolute horror at the skewer through
  her breast, for a few seconds, she couldn't even breath. 
Then she thrashed like she was electrocuted. Her cunt spasmed wildly, almost
  pushing Jack over into orgasm. But he held on, he wanted to do the other one. 
This time, there was no hiding, she watched him reach for the skewer. She
  spewed an incoherent garble of begging, pleading, screaming as he waved it
  in front of her. Her hips bucked wildly trying to throw him off, she actually
  knocked the clit clamp loose and it clattered on the floor. Jack noticed and
  cursed internally, but despite that, he loved her struggles. She tore at her
  bonds, struggled and flailed like a wild animal. The piercing needle already
  in her breast flopped about wildly. 
Oh this was going to be good, he thought. Laying his weight on her to hold
  her down, his cock embedded deeply in her spasming cunt, he grabbed her nipple,
  holding it painfully. Her eyes were white with fear. Slowly, he laid the cork
  against it, brought the piercing needle forward. 
Her screams were like music, and her whole body spasmed. As he slowly slid
  the needle into her flesh, the feelings of her pain and the sensations of her
  cunt on his cock were sending him over the edge. As he pierced her nipple,
  he ejaculated up inside her, a massive powerful orgasm that had him forcing
  the needle all the way through the cork and halfway out the other side. It
  was so powerful his vision almost whited out. 
But he had presence of mind even as his cock spurted its last bursts of semen
  to reach down to her hyperexcited cunt. With a few deft manipulations of his
  fingers, he triggered an orgasm that shook her. 
Jack rocked his hips, working his softening cock inside her clutching throbbing
  folds, forcing his last drops of semen up into her despoiled womb. He luxuriated
  in his taking of her, the helpless agonized surrender written on her slack
  face. 
Almost done, he thought. Taking advantage of the passivity of her orgasm,
  he reached down for a heavy ring, slipped the plastic joint on it, drew the
  first piercing needle out, and slid the first ring in. It was a quick easy
  process, barely a drop of blood. Then, with equal confidence, he inserted the
  second ring. Oh she looked good. 
Finally, he pulled himself off her, listening to her soft panting. He straightened
  up, grinned, and said. �Okay, that wasn't bad. Listen, I'm going to make some
  coffee, you want cream or sugar with yours.� 
She opened her eyes, Jack enjoyed the mild shock in them as she tried to process
  his words. Finally, she understood. How should she respond to this man who
  had brutally raped her and now wanted to know her coffee preferences? It seemed
  surreal. 
Eventually, she managed to say, �black is fine.� 
Jack chuckled. �I would have bet you liked it strong and black,� he slapped
  her thigh, a friendly stinging gesture, unlocked her wrists. �Coming right
  up.� 
He gestured to a corner. �Sorry about your clothes, if you want something
  to wear... Not like you need to, try that pile there.� 
Lynsey stared at the pile of rags in the corner. Whistling tunelessly, Jack
  left her to it and trotted upstairs. 
* * * * * * * * * 
Lynsey sat at Jack's kitchen table in a mild state of shock. A mug of steaming
  coffee was in her hands. She'd found a dirty T-shirt and a pair of sweat pants
  to cover her nudity. 
�I know you might want to take the rings out,� he was telling her. �But you
  need to leave them at least a week.� 
�Why?� 
�Infection,� he lied, �without the rings in there, you'll have torn tissue
  with nothing to keep it open. So, infection will set in. You don't want your
  nipples turning black and seeping pus, do you?� 
She shuddered, the very thought made her queasy. Jack smiled. 
�You should be safe after a week. My advice is to leave them for a month and
  then decide if you want to keep them or not. Your call. But they look good
  on you.� 
Lynsey simply grunted. Her nipples ached horribly, and she could feel the
  visceral weight and shape of the heavy rings. 
She still couldn't believe it. Moments ago, she'd been downstairs, chained,
  terrorized, whipped and raped. Now she was sitting here in the kitchen of the
  man who had done it all to her, as if it had never happened. Sort of... 
�Man,� he said, �you were so fucking hot. You were a wet dream. I'm glad I
  didn't wear a rubber, I didn't want to miss a bit of you.� 
�Thanks,� Lynsey said, �I think.� 
She thought a little. 
�How did you find me?� 
Jack chuckled, the lie was already prepared. �Well, I was at this department
  store, and I saw you. You fit the description, and you were wearing this outfit
  you'd described. So, I decided to follow you. You bought something from a salesgirl,
  paid with a credit card, so after you left, I came over fed her some story
  and paid her fifty bucks for your address and customer information. Simple
  as that.� 
�Simple as that,� Lynsey repeated softly. 
�Simple as that,� Jack said, �it was just a fluke.� 
�A fluke,� Lynsey said. It was a fluke. A once in a million chance. That was
  all. But... 
�Who was the salesgirl?� 
Jack chuckled and shook his head, �I wouldn't want to get the poor girl in
  trouble. You did ask for this, you know.� 
Lynsey blinked. It was a fluke she told herself. But... 
�Did you tell anyone else?� 
Jack nodded guiltily. 
�Yeah, one guy. A friend of mine. We agreed it shouldn't go any further than
  the two of us. After all, why kill the golden goose? We figured if it got too
  far out, then it would turn into a mess, no fun.� 
�One?� 
�Yeah, his big thing was nailing you in a parking lot. Then he was going to
  take off for a few weeks.� 
So the Parking Lot rape was part of it, she thought to herself. She didn't
  know if that comforted or frightened her. But what about the other incident? 
�Anyone else?� 
�Nope. We swore secrecy.� 
�But there were two guys who said... They took me for a hooker... � Lynsey
  trailed off under Jack's innocent gaze. Had that been real? That they had really
  taken her for a hooker? That for them, it had just been a transaction, fucking
  a hooker? She had submitted so easily. She felt more and more disoriented. 
�Geez,� Jack said, �you okay? You look pale suddenly.� 
�No... No... It's okay.� 
�Look, if some guys mistook you for a hooker, that was nothing to do with
  me or Zacc. He nail you?� 
She nodded. �Parking lot.� 
Jack swore softly. �Fuck, I owe him twenty bucks! That bastard, he told me
  he was going to go for it this week, I figured I'd be in first!� 
�This week?� Lynsey felt a tremor of fear. 
Jack noted it and made an innocent face. �Oh don't worry about that. We each
  figured that the merry go round was good for one ride apiece. If he's had you,
  he's not going to come back.� 
�One ride?� She didn't dare to hope... 
Jack shrugged. �Yep, and I've just had mine. You're off the hook. I mean really,
  I don't think we could get away with raping you over and over, could we? I
  mean, that wasn't what you were up for...� Jack allowed a note of hope to creep
  in his voice, a warning that sent shivers up her spine. 
�No, no,� she said quickly and tried to smile, �offer good for one time only.� 
Jack winked. �I thought so.� 
�So,� he asked her, �did he make you come?� 
Lynsey blushed. 
�You were so fucking hot,� he said. �I could tell you were into it. I mean,
  we play at rape right? But the real thing, that's not cool. I could feel how
  you wanted it though. You know how I could tell it wasn't really rape?� 
Lynsey stared blankly. It wasn't really rape? It had felt like it. She had
  been violated to her core. Jack didn't wait for the answer. 
�You came like a fountain!� He said, �the moment I stuck my hand up between
  your legs... And let me tell you, I was a little nervous until then... But
  you were dripping.� 
�See,� he lectured her, �I used to work in hospitals, in trauma ward, emergency.
  I saw a lot of shit.� He was lying, but of course, she couldn't know that. 
�So you know, we got to know things. Thing with a woman, if it's genuine rape,
  like she really doesn't want it, there's physiological reactions, right? Her
  body goes into fight or flight mode, all the blood goes to the limbs, she's
  pumping out adrenalin. It's like the opposite of a big meal, you know, all
  the blood goes to internal organs for digestion, your arms and legs feel tired.
  With fight or flight, the blood goes just the opposite, into the limbs. You
  know what that means?� 
�Uhm...� 
�No sexual response,� he lied. �None at all. She's dry as a bone, the muscles
  are tight down there, not even much sensitivity. No responsiveness. See, the
  private parts need to saturate with blood for arousal. So, in a real rape,
  a woman is incapable of orgasm, hell, she can't feel anything down there hardly.
  Can't get aroused, physiologically impossible.� 
Lynsey was confused. She had come. She'd come strongly each of the rapes.
  But if what he was saying was true... Then how? She studied his face, searching
  for any hint of deception. 
Jack noted the uncertainty that crossed her features. Privately, he was elated,
  his cock leaped in his pants. He loved this. He had fucked her body, and now
  he was fucking her mind. He was fucking into her soul. The thought made him
  hard, made him want to throw her on the floor and take her brutally. He controlled
  the urge, and simply smiled innocently at her. 
�Now a lot of the rape cases we got at the hospital... Well, I shouldn't say
  a lot, but you know, a definite percentage, a minority... They were what we'd
  call �rape after the fact.' Some girl does it with her boyfriend and you know,
  stuff happens, she freaks out that she might be pregnant, she gets an attack
  of the guilts, he turns out to be a jerk, she gets caught by her daddy or husband...
  What's she going to say?� 
He paused and looked expectancy at Lynsey, putting her on the spot. 
�That she was raped?� 
Jack nodded, mentally scoring a victory touchdown. �Precisely. She's in an
  awkward situation, she's scared, she's upset, so she tells everyone it was
  a rape. Tells herself too... Some of these bitches, excuse my language, they
  convince themselves and wind up believing it.� 
Lynsey stared. 
�So you know, Police, the Hospital, we'd have a protocol. Find out if she
  was confessing to some sexual stimulation, have a nurse go off and check if
  they're wet. That's what the physical exam is really for by the way, to see
  if there's sexual arousal, or if its really rape. If they're wet, if they were
  getting off, hell, if they came, then we would know they were lying. It's not
  a real rape, we'd just send them off for counseling to work out whatever emotional
  problems it was they had.� 
He grinned at Lynsey. �That's how I knew you were completely into it. Fuck
  you were wet! And you came, you came fucking buckets. You were a fountain,
  babe.� 
He really believes it, she thought to herself. He really believes that he
  didn't really rape me. The thought astonished her, she couldn't get her mind
  around it. 
Jack watched the emotions, the confusion and uncertainty warring on her face,
  she didn't have enough presence of mind to conceal them. He loved what he was
  doing to her, spinning her head around. 
Lynsey puzzled at it. Of course he doesn't believe he really raped me, she
  thought, that's why he's made me coffee, why he's so casual like this. He really
  does believe that I was totally into it, that I was into everything he did...
  Because he thinks I came. But I did come. Could he be right, he seemed so confident,
  so certain about that. If it was truly rape... then how could I come... And
  if I came, then at some level... I liked it... Wanted it? Oh god. 
Jack watched her face contort, almost able to read her thoughts as she worked
  her way through it all. He shifted in his chair, his cock rigid again, as an
  iron bar. Oh how he longed to drag her back to the basement and whip her ass
  until he was ready to shoot a load into it, to hear her scream and beg as he
  violated her. But this was better. This was so much better. 
He had the stupid bitch just about convinced that it wasn't rape at all, that
  it was her fault. 
�You okay, Lynsey,� he asked innocently. 
Her face was ashen, but she nodded, barely registering him. She was far too
  caught up in her betrayal of herself, in the realization that her responses
  to the rapes had been .... They weren't rapes? She'd wanted it? Liked it? But
  then, she'd asked to play the game... All those fantasies on the computer...
  Dressing like a hooker... She felt ashamed of herself, immeasurably dirty and
  filthy. She felt like a cheap whore. 
�Um... Yeah,� she whispered. The coffee was growing cold. 
She wasn't looking at him, so Jack allowed himself a gloating smirk. �Well,
  I suppose you better get going. Sorry about your clothes. Shall we hit the
  road...� 
He stood up. Lynsey, automatically stood. He lead her to the hallway, and
  stopped her there, taking her chin and kissing her. Her lips were like putty,
  she was barely responsive. He could tell she was still undergoing an internal
  struggle. She had almost no will left, was simply operating on autopilot. 
�You're so fucking hot,� he whispered, putting his hand on her shoulder and
  keeping pressure there. After a second, she sank to her knees. His heart raced
  at this reflexive surrender. He rolled her hair in his hands as she obediently
  unzipped his pants and pulled his cock out. Her mouth opened, and she took
  his hard rod between her wet lips. 
�Finger yourself,� he whispered, and watched as one of her hands slid under
  the wasteband of her sweat pants. He didn't know if she was truly aroused,
  or merely obedient, and he didn't care. He understood instead, that even as
  his cock fucked into her face, that his words had fucked into her soul, penetrating
  her more deeply than she had ever been touched. 
He patiently allowed her to suck his cock for ten minutes, watching as her
  hips began to rock of their own accord, as her arousal, born out of confusion
  and surrender built. Then, just before she was ready, he grabbed her head tightly
  and violently thrust a half dozen times into her mouth, shooting his load.
  He pulled out, his semen dripping from her lip, her expression dazed, confused
  and needy. 
That's it, bitch, he thought. Going to leave you on the hook, leave you horny.
  You don't get to come on this one, you're going to leave here all squirming
  and hot and bothered and unable to think straight. You're going to walk out
  of here with your pussy throbbing, and all those ideas I put in your head rolling
  around, and you won't know if you're coming or going, you won't know up or
  down, you're just going to be so confused you'll swallow every bit of bullshit
  because I've tied your head all up in knots and your pussy is throbbing. 
None of this escaped his lips. Instead he helped the now helplessly docile
  Lynsey up, escorted her to his car. He had her lie with her face in his lap,
  another deliberate humiliation, explaining that he didn't want her to see his
  neighborhood... Just in case she changed her mind, like the other false rape
  claimants. She acceded to his request, and so he drove most of the way across
  the city with the smell of his crotch in her nostrils. 
Finally, a few blocks away, he let her up. He explained he wasn't sure where
  she lived... A transparent and patent lie, which he noted with amusement, she
  didn't even register. Was it okay to let her off here? She nodded. 
He let her out on the busy street, and then, just as she took too steps away,
  he called her back, to demand a kiss. So she bent down to stick her head in
  the car window and submitted to a long and torrid french kiss, his tongue exploring
  her mouth, while he quite obviously felt up her breasts. A number of passer
  by's and locals saw their intimate clasp. 
Jack again enjoyed her humiliation, but also enjoyed having witnesses who
  could testify to her consensual intimacy with him. Let her bring a rape complaint,
  if she could, he laughed to himself. 
His last sight was Lynsey stumbling home in a daze, her nipple rings poking
  through the thin cotton of the dirty T-shirt, the crotch of her absorbent sweat
  pants slightly but visibly darkened with moisture. 
* * * * * * * * 
Lynsey returned home to an angry message on her answering machine from her
  employer, asking about her whereabouts and why she hadn't shown up for work.
  It seemed unreal, irrelevant. 
She left a message of her own that she was sick. After that, she stumbled
  around the apartment, bathing, laying down, cooking and doing dishes automatically,
  trying to make sense of her experiences. 
The next couple of days she stayed home as well, calling in sick, and ignoring
  the increasingly frustrated messages left by her office. She would deal with
  it when she could deal with it. 
In the meantime, she felt adrift. Things had happened to her. But now, she
  looked at her bodies reactions, and could not be sure that they had really
  happened the way she though they had. Rather, they had not been what she thought.
  Or had they? The memories and incidents were fresh and graphic, but so were
  her physical reactions. She found it difficult to work through, difficult to
  think. 
Still, as difficult as it all was, there were rays of hope. Jack had told
  her it was a fluke. No one else was out there homing in on her, there was no
  way to find her. It had all been dumb luck on his part. And it had been a one
  time thing, for Jack and Zacc. They wouldn't take her again. She was safe.
  She was secure. The hooker thing, that was just an abberation, another fluke.
  Shame on her for dressing like a hooker, she'd deserved it. But that was over.
  She wouldn't dress up in public again. No, it wouldn't happen again. It couldn't
  happen again. It was over. She was safe. 
She clung to that. She was safe. She built an island of stability for herself
  around that point. She was safe. After a few nights, she had recovered herself
  enough to return to some of her comforting rituals, her life settling back
  into her old groove. She didn't masturbate, of course, she didn't dare confront
  that. There was an urge, but it intimidated her, whispered to her of frightening
  darknesses within herself, a gateway to her own wells of shame. And she certainly
  didn't go on the net. 
But she did drink a big glass of orange juice before going to bed.... 
* * * * * * * * * * 
Lynsey woke like a car crash, a sudden jarring rush of consciousness where
  she snapped out of utter blackness to jarring, screaming wakefulness. She woke
  to rushing panic, her heart racing, pulse pounding, muscles clenching, her
  body washed with cold sweat. The world twisted unsteadily around her as she
  tried to thrash. 
She had know way to know it, but her explosive waking was the effect of a
  methamphetamine suppository countering the narcotic drugs in her system. The
  two combined to leave her jangling and disoriented. So, for the first instants
  of her waking, she knew only that she had woken in physical and emotional turmoil
  as if from a horrific nightmare. The nightmare, of course, was only beginning. 
Gradually, as she gained control of herself, Lynsey realized that she couldn't
  move. She twisted her head. She was lying on her bed, yes. In her own bedroom.
  Her mouth was constricted by some sort of gag, it pushed her jaws open and
  leather straps pulled tight against her cheek. The side of her face was slick
  with warm drool. She pulled, but her arms wouldn't move. She realized that
  they were fastened behind her back at her wrists and elbows in a posture that
  was just on the edges of discomfort. Her shoulders ached? How long had she
  been like this? She was on her stomach, and there was a pillow under her hips,
  elevating them. Her legs were splayed widely, trying to pull them up, she could
  feel cords at her ankles, she succeeded only in wiggling her ass. 
In her confused, disoriented state she could not even put together the thoughts
  to wonder why or how she was trussed in this position. Lynsey was only aware
  of her bondage in the center of her own home, and her weak pointless thrashings
  to free herself. 
So it came as a complete and utter shock to the core of her soul when two
  strong male hands were laid on her upraised buttocks. She screamed, or tried
  to scream through the gag. The only result was a muffled groaning. Up to the
  moment that the strange hands took possession of her, it had not even occurred
  to her, in her drug and fatigue addled state, to even suspect that she might
  not be alone. 
Mike had watched her shock back to consciousness, had listened to her tiny
  mews and groans, the twitching and stretching as she discovered her bonds.
  He had, of course, watched her unknowingly drug herself on tainted orange juice.
  Had waited an appropriate time before sneaking in. He had undressed her lovingly,
  posed and positioned her body as he had done so many times before. But this
  time, oh this time, it would be for real. His cock laid in his pants like a
  battering ram, as he carefully bound her body into position, ensuring both
  helplessness and complete vulnerability. He undressed himself, laid out his
  preparations. Finally, he'd slid a methamphetamine suppository up her ass to
  watch her wake. 
It had been perfect. 
Now with his hands, strange hands, kneading the yielding flesh of her buttocks,
  Lynsey flew into full fledged panic, thrashing within the limits of her bonds,
  kicking, trying to throw him off. Mike was impressed, at points, she actually
  managed to lift her torso up completely off the bed, her body straining. Her
  struggles to free herself only humped her ass up against his hands again and
  again. Mike enjoyed her thrashings, letting her play herself out like a fish
  on a line. 
Finally, she collapsed in exhausted passivity, panting fiercely, her body
  drenched in her own sweat. 
It was time, Mike decided, for the next step. 
Lynsey's eyes opened wide when she heard the sound of a vibrator being switched
  on. Her body twitched at its gentle touch at her labia. Mike played the vibrator
  like an artist, drawing it up and down her inner thighs, along her lips, teasing
  her clit with it, before circling around to her anus. 
Lynsey grew wetter and wetter, her hips rocked in the limited range he'd allowed
  her. She found herself gasping and moaning. Even the enduring soreness of her
  newly pierced nipples contributed to her arousal. Her mind locked up, unable
  to even begin to cope with what was happening to her, with her waking to bondage,
  with it happening in the sanctity and safety of her home, with this terrifying
  unknown stranger, who made her feel sooo good. The horror of previous rapes
  mingled in her unconsciousness with Jack's lies about secret willingness and
  her own bodies betrayals. She simply could not allow herself to think, her
  mind would not function. 
And so she writhed and moaned in bondage as Mike used the vibrator and his
  fingers to tease her vagina, never penetrating it, but building her again and
  again towards orgasm, while always denying ultimate release. He would not let
  her come. 
Finally, as Lynsey was reduced to a whimpering, quivering, shuddering mass,
  driven half mad with arousal and denied orgasm, Mike decided that she was ready. 
He took two fingers of lubrication and smeared it liberally between her ass
  cheeks. Lynsey gasped, not quite understanding this new cold sensation. He
  crudely and impersonally shoved his finger up her ass, lubricating it again
  and again. Lynsey, in her haze, even lifted her ass for him, wiggling it in
  hopes he would go back to fingering her cunt. 
Of course, the lubrication wasn't for her. Mike was indifferent if it caused
  her pain, in fact, he might enjoy that. But he was going in without a rubber,
  and this bitch was so tight and cherry, he didn't want to tear the skin off
  his cock. 
Lynsey was an anal virgin, which pleased him. They'd determined that in their
  nocturnal examinations of her drugged body. Her ass was cherry. They had all
  agreed that Mike's reward, his gift, their token of appreciation to him for
  putting all this together, was that they would save that luscious tight ass
  just for him. Through the previous rapes, they had carefully saved that rosebud
  for his deflowering. 
What a great bunch of guys, Mike thought. He straddled her ass now, pressing
  his cock between her cheeks. Still crazed with arousal, addled with the combination
  of narcotics and amphetamines in her system, helpless in her bindings, Lynsey
  moaned with confusion, she didn't fully understand what was going on. Wasn't
  he going to fuck her? 
Mike rolled the head of his cock back and forth between her butt cheeks as
  she squirmed. It wasn't quite enough. 
He bent forward, laying his hips across her ass, his cock resting against
  her hungry lips, so near and yet so far. He leaned in until he could whisper
  in her ear. 
�Lynsey,� he whispered, �oh Lynsey, can you hear me?� 
He whispered it over and over until he got her attention. 
�Can you understand me, Lynsey?� 
She nodded. He'd focused her attention. His cock hardened even more, grew
  violently urgent. 
�Good.� 
�Lynsey,� he told her, �I'm going to fuck you up the ass. I'm going to fuck
  you really hard up the ass.� 
She went still, he could tell she was absorbing the knowledge. He could almost
  imagine the cold horror creeping through her body, the sudden poisoning of
  her arousal, the swift temporary clarity and the fear and panic it inspired. 
�Do you understand, Lynsey?� he whispered, enjoying the evil of it. �I'm going
  to take my big cock and shove it hard up your tiny little cherry asshole....
  And there's nothing you can do but take it.� 
Lynsey thrashed violently. Even with his weight on her back, she succeeded
  for a second in raising her upper body. A series of ululating moans tore through
  her gag. Her shoulders worked, her hips bounced, her legs kicked within their
  bonds. 
Mike laughed with pure pleasure, enjoying the way she wriggled like a fish
  on a hook. For a second, he considered waiting it out, letting her exhaust
  herself into helplessness again. But why bother? Why not just take her in the
  middle of her struggles, at the height of her strength. 
He straddled her bouncing ass, positioning his cock at her sphinter. Try as
  she might, she could not dislodge him away. 
Lynsey was terrified, in full panic mode, her mind seized with unreasoning
  fear. Her mind had ceased to function, and she was now all animal fright and
  sensation. She thrashed wildly, never acknowledging her helplessness. 
There was a pressure at her sphincter. Lynsey knew it was her rapist's huge
  cock trying to breach her. Animal fear reflexes took over. She squeezed herself
  shut with every fibre of strength in her being. 
Mike pushed, letting all the weight of his body settle into his hips, letting
  his bodies mass be his weapon against her. The pressure against Lynsey's sphincter
  grew unbearable. Her struggles ceased as all her resources, every molecule
  of will devoted itself to holding him out. His cocks head pushed inexorably,
  an irresistable force of body and willpower against her immoveable entry. 
The force, the pressure continued to increase. Lynsey stopped breathing, holding
  it in tight. Even her heartrate seemed to slow, to become ponderous. Her face
  grew hot and puffy, her body stiff, the muscles rigid. Even her toes were splayed. 
For a second, for a split second, she thought, imagined, fantasized, that
  she might win, that he would not gain entry. 
And then she gave the tiniest gasp, bated held breath betrayed her with a
  quick intake, and she felt by just the tiniest increment, her body's strength
  lessening. 
His pressure kept increasing, his whole weight on her, concentrated on the
  head of his cock at her vulnerable sphincter, he pushed with his knees and
  his hips, grabbing her waist in his hands, he pulled himself onto her, curving
  his back to add to the force of his impending violation of her body. 
She felt his strength growing relentlessly, forcing her ring muscle down,
  prying it open millimeter after millimeter. And she felt her own strength waning
  quickly, the singular focus of will that had allowed her to resist him so far
  giving way to panic and frenzy. Tears rolled down her face, and she made a
  despairing moan through her gag. 
He chuckled, feeling victory in his loins, feeling defeat suffusing her body.
  The contest was now wholly unequal, he continued to push as she weakened rapidly,
  her strength becoming sporadic and fluttering. The head of his cock pushed
  at her anal ring, opening it, stretching it to its normal extension. 
It wasn't enough to admit him of course. His cock was a massive bludgeon,
  and she was an anal virgin, her tiny ring unused to violation, suitable only
  for small passage of soft and delicate excretions. 
But Lynsey was defeated now, her strength falling away, only shreds remaining
  to her, while if anything, his sexual will had grown ever more implacable.
  With victory over her vanquished spirit, he could have ripped her with a single
  thrust, but he preferred to go slow, to remain an implacable force of her slow
  destruction. And thus, he measured his penetration, paced it against her fading
  strength. 
She moaned in pain as her anal ring stretched open to its absolute limit,
  and was stretched further. Lynsey grunted and gasped in agony as his entry
  slowly tore the delicate inner muscle fibres of her sphincter ring, defeating
  her once again, opening her wider and wider. 
Finally, the head of his cock passed within her anal ring. He could feel it
  wrapped tight around him, tight as a vise, tight as a pressure clamp. The frantic
  grunting from her gag could have been taken as sobbing, mourning her defeat,
  bemoaning the inevitable fate that they both knew now awaited her, the consummation
  of her primal violation. 
Slowly, with the exquisite leisure of a conquerer, he allowed his shaft to
  sink beneath her cheeks. Millimeter by millimeter, his cock forced its way
  deeper into her helpless bowels. The contest was over, he was merely claiming
  his prize. She still fluttered, her limbs pulling weakly, her head turning,
  tears drifting. Every now and then, some depth of penetration would be achieved,
  a stretching of abused bowel, which would bring a further grunt from her exhausted
  sweat soaked body. 
Mike stared at his cock, half way into her bowels, the shaft still sticking
  out proud and strong around the taut stretched anal ring. He revelled in her
  absolute helplessness. This quivering, jellylike, sweating, feeble, defenseless
  thing, the totality of it's existence devolving upon a stretched and torn ring
  of muscle and his foreign invading meat that in the very act of penetration,
  defined and defiled it, making it nothing more than the hot clutching receptacle
  for his cock. 
He wanted her to fully understand just how utterly degraded and dehumanized
  he had made her. How her identity, her very existence had been to become nothing
  more than warm meat to wrap his cock. 
�This is you, Linzey,� Mike whispered in your ear. �Your entire life, everything
  you ever dreamed, ever thought, ever wanted, the whole thing from third grade
  music lessons to your latest job promotion, all of it to take you here, to
  make you nothing more and nothing less than a helpless quivering hole for my
  cock. This is your life, Linzey, this is the whole point of your life, this
  is your hole life...� 
Did she understand? A long tremulous groan slid from her throat. He wanted
  to laugh, his cock swelled growing even harder, its rapid pulse stretching
  her violated anal ring that much further, as he whispered degrading obscenities
  into her helpless ears. 
He sank deeper, his pubic hair tickling the crack of her ass. His hips curved
  in against her round buttocks, feeling the yielding warmth of her flesh. But
  Mike still wasn't satisfied. He kept on pushing deeper, flattening her curving
  ass against his hard muscle, pushing harder and harder now for each millimeter
  of penetration. He drove relentlessly into her, pulling her hips back, putting
  all his weight into her body. Lynsey was squashed flat under him, splayed and
  opened, his force was so relentless that she could not breath beneath him.
  If she had been able to open and close her mouth, she would have made gasping
  motions like a fish. As it was, her eyes bulged and her face went red and puffy. 
Finally, he had utterly penetrated her, violated her, defiled and deflowered
  her helpless body. He had taken her as no man ever had, had placed himself
  far beyond anything she had ever taken within herself. He was almost satisfied. 
Now for the fucking. Mike began to pull back, allowing her to breath. Her
  defile anal ring was pulled with his cock, drawn after it as it withdrew. He
  took his time with his leisurely stroke, wanting to experience every bit of
  her. And then he sank back, revelling once again, in the renewal of his possession,
  this new round of defilement. He was not particularly concerned to be gentle
  with her, he cared little about her pain and only marginally about injury.
  No, the slow steady fucking he gave her was solely for his pleasure. 
Lynsey was beyond shock, beyond awareness. She was conscious, but her mind
  was shattered, and frozen. She recorded sensation but did not comprehend it,
  existing at barely animal levels. The little comprehension she had of his filthy
  whispering had driven her nearly to oblivion. Incapable of the emotion of surprise
  now, she nevertheless became aware of her bodies response. The mechanical sighing,
  the falling into rhythm, the renewed wetness and throbbing of her clit, her
  building physical arousal despite the sea of pain and violation that she found
  herself trapped in. 
In truth, a woman's grafenberg spot at the back of her vagina was vulnerable
  to anal stimulation, and this is what was happening with her. Mike noted with
  pleasure the signs of her arousal, the smell of musk, the helpless writhings
  that marked another betrayal by her body. He could, if he chose, ass fuck her
  to helpless orgasm. 
He chose not to, that was not his plan. As he sensed her nearing, he would
  slow and stop, waiting for the edge to go off her sexual bonfire, and then
  only when there was no danger of her orgasm, would he continue his violation.
  Lynsey was left trapped in a swamp of increasingly intense sexual heat, unable
  to flee it, unable to do the slightest thing to bring herself off, continually
  stimulated but perpetually denied release. 
Finally, after almost an hour, he felt his orgasm quickening upon him. Mike
  allowed himself the luxury of ramming into her helpless, sweat soaked body
  with ever more brutal force, until finally in a handful of spastic lunges he
  emptied his semen up inside her bowels. This was another violation of her,
  though she was long past appreciating it. But Mike gloried in spurting inside
  her nether regions, his deposit of semen another kind of deflowering, leaving
  his seed within her. 
Finally sated, Mike waited till he could feel his cock softening before pulling
  himself off her. He padded to the kitchen, took a drink of water and then returned
  to inspect his work. The room smelled now of blood and shit and sweat, the
  odours of her violation. For a second, he briefly contemplated urinating on
  her to complete the scene. But that wasn't in his plan, he put it aside. 
Instead, he knelt behind her and pulled her cheeks apart. He shoved two fingers
  into her asshole, stirring it. She was loose now, her anal muscles bruised
  into helplessness, stretched and torn. But as he stirred, he noticed no signs
  of prolapse, the tearing and rupture of the ligaments that held her anus and
  colon in place. He was pleased with that, he would not have minded rupturing
  her into prolapse, but it was difficult to repair and the recovery was long. 
No, she would recover from this anal plundering, although, he smiled to himself,
  she would never again be able to resist with the strength and will she had
  battled tonight. Her gates were now permanently weakened, not so badly that
  she would be useless or forced to wear a diaper, not so badly that a man would
  lack for pleasure in her body, but weakened nevertheless. Every other struggle
  from now on would be a foregone conclusion, a doomed and futile struggle for
  the remembrance of an honour long soiled. 
He tried speaking to her, but she was beyond hearing. Instead, he merely played
  with her, ensuring that her raging sexual fire neither subsided nor was satisfied.
  When he was ready, he anally raped her again, and then later in the evening
  used her one more time for a third and final violation. It was easier each
  time, his violation more complete and thorough, her resistance almost nonexistent.
  He was not displeased, indeed, the evidence of the utter thoroughness of her
  defeat made him even harder, made his strokes that much more urgent, slightly
  more brutal. He used her body thoroughly. And of course, he never allowed her
  to come. 
After his third ejaculation into her thoroughly despoiled bowels, Mike had
  had it. His cock, despite the lubrication was sore, he was fucked out, he felt
  good in a sated loose limbed way. 
There was still one last violation, one last humiliation to inflict, though
  she was long past appreciating it. Slapping her casually on the ass, he moved
  up to her front, loosing the gag from her mouth. One look in her eyes, a glimpse
  at the blasted, shattered soul therein, was all the assurance he needed. 
He stuck his filthy shit and blood covered cock into her slack mouth to clean
  it off. At first, he only humped in her face, moving it against her tongue.
  But after a moment or two, Lynsey gathered enough understanding together to
  know what she had to do, and so, only half aware, began to suck and lick, washing
  her own shit and blood off his genitals, using her lips and tongue to clean
  him of the evidence of her own despoil. 
When she was finished, he did not bother to thank her, any more than he bothered
  to order her initially. She was just meat for his use, you don't order or thank
  meat, you simply use it. 
He released her wrists and elbow straps, freed her ankles. Now loosed from
  bondage, she simply lay where she was, her eyes gazing sightlessly, her breathing
  shallow. Mike treated himself to a hot shower, confident that she would neither
  flee nor attack. When he came out, she was still laying on the bed in the same
  position. 
He dressed, then cheerfully slapped her ass. �You know,� he said with a chipper
  tone, �you should take a shower, wash all that funk off. Maybe open a window,
  change the sheets.� 
And then he let himself out, whistling a happy tune. 
After he was gone, she was alone. Freed of bondage, the only things in the
  world were her bodies aches and the relentless unsated heat in her loins, the
  arousal he had built and refused to sate. She reached between her legs and
  began to masturbate, fingering herself to one orgasm after another, the physical
  traces and memories of her violation overpowering within her. 
* * * * * * * * * * * 
Lynsey showered automatically, mostly because she had been told to do so.
Incapable of her own thoughts, Mike's suggestion was her only motivation. 
She changed the sheets and cleaned the room, again because he'd told her to
  do it. 
And then afterwards... Nothing. She went to the bathroom when pressure began
  in her bladder or colon. She went to the kitchen and ate a little when hunger
  drove her. But that was it. The dawn rose, and she was barely aware of it.
  Sometime in the morning, her telephone rang, and she stared at it without curiousity.
  She knew that messages were being recorded that she could listen to, but did
  not bother to listen. She did not even bother to turn on the television. Mostly,
  she laid in bed, occasionally turning around. 
Once in a while, in response to some mechanical urge, her fingers would slide
  down between her legs, and she would masturbate. But it was simply her bodies
  urging and her bodies satisfaction. Lynsey herself wasn't really there. Her
  eyes were open, but she didn't see. 
That was the next few days. The phone rang several times, she never answered.
  One of the messages was from her employer, advising that she had been terminated.
  If she did not show up to collect her personal possessions from the office,
  they would simply be thrown out. Lynsey did not hear it, and would not have
  had the ability to care if she had. Other messages were from her Landlord warning
  direly of eviction after too many bounced rent cheques. Again, she was incapable
  of caring. An eviction notice was slid under her door, but she never noticed
  it. Other calls were from creditors. None from friends. 
It was late afternoon. Lynsey was laying in bed on her back, staring at the
  ceiling, half covered by a single sheer sheet. She heard her apartment door
  being unlocked. Her head turned slightly at the noise. Someone was coming in,
  she knew that. But she found that she had no response, except an automatic
  tightening in her cunt. She waited, listening to the sound of someone moving
  around. 
Eventually, he came into the bedroom. She watched without expression. She
  did not know him, but that didn't matter any more. Her body continued to betray
  her by becoming wet. He stared at her lying on the bed. Finally, he reached
  down and slowly pulled the sheet off her naked body. She did not cling to it. 
Lynsey was naked, splayed out before him like a prize for the taking. He continued
  to watch her, without speaking. 
Slowly, Lynsey spread her legs for him. 
He smiled. 
He took off his belt, folded it in half and slapped it against his palm. She
  did not react. He unzipped his pants, taking his massive heavy cock out. He
  knelt on the bed. Again, there was no response. 
He knew that she was utterly broken, that he could make her, that she would
  do anything, absolutely anything he wanted. 
And that is exactly what she did. 
Anything. 
Absolutely anything. 
Everything. 
And came, she did it all, and she came. Which was the very worst part. 
* * * * * * * * * * 
After the final rape, she struggled to put herself back together. They'd driven
  her to the bottom, so inevitably, there was no place else to go, nothing else
  to do but try to regain herself. 
She slept fourteen hours after the rape. But when she woke, she showered,
  dressed. She made herself a late lunch. She listened to her messages with a
  resigned depression, picked up her eviction notice, collected her mail, noting
  that her bank statements contained a long list of bounced cheques. How had
  that happened? She'd had money in her bank account, it was almost as if her
  cheques were sabotaged. Her life was so fucked. 
Lynsey stepped out of her apartment for the first time in days to buy a few
  groceries and a newspaper. She pored over job listings. Turned on the television
  and watched it. Finally, she went to her computer and updated her resume. After
  doing that, she closed down at the program and stared at her screensaver, almost
  losing herself in its placid evolution, like watching goldfish. 
She knew what she had to do. 
She had to stop it, end it, bring it to a close. 
And then she could go on with her life, put it all back together, find a new
  job, a new apartment, get back on the rails. 
She signed into the chatroom. 
There were all there, waiting for her. 
�Hey bitch,� Mike said, �took you long enough. How's your ass?� 
One by one, the others greeted her, with little references that told her that
  each one of them had had her, had used her and brutalized her and made her
  body love it. She was frightened, despite herself, but soldiered on. 
�It's over,� she typed. 
�Really?� Mike wrote, his sarcasm blinking quietly on her screen. 
�It was a stupid thing I did, I paid for it. You all had your fun. Fine,� she
  wrote, with more confidence than she felt. �But it's finished now. No more.
  If it happens again I will go to the police.� 
And she would, she knew instinctively. It wasn't an idle threat. She would
  risk the police, she'd risk humiliation and disgrace to bring it all crashing
  down, as long as she stopped them. 
�I mean it.� 
�Oh yeah,� Mike wrote, �did you mean this?� 
A window appeared on her screen, she glanced at it. It was a transcript of
  her original invitation to be raped. 
�Or these?� 
The window disappeared, more flickered on, lasting a few seconds and vanishing.
  Lynsey could only catch the gist, her sickest fantasies appeared before her
  eyes, a succession of rapes and tortures, animals, children, private awful
  things shared with no one. How was he doing this? How did he have these. 
Her bookmarks abruptly pulled down, making her jump. Windows opened and then
  closed on her sickest and nastiest pornographic sites. Oh my god, she thought,
  they know, they know everything, and they have it. 
�How do you think the cops will act, when they read this stuff,� Mike challenged, �when
  they find out what you like to play with yourself over?� 
Lynsey felt her confidence rock. A complaint to the cops was one thing, she
  could risk embarrassment. But this... Would the cops just see it all as some
  sick kinky game, one that she was playing, perhaps even running? She might
  become a suspect herself, what would they think, what would they do? 
�Or maybe you can show them some pictures?� Mike typed. 
An image popped on her screen, she jumped again. It was her in the red knit
  dress and fishnets, a particularly provocative picture that made it clear she
  wore no bra. Another picture of her in the dress, this one creeping up her
  thighs hinting at no panties. Others appeared in her slut outfits. A picture
  of her at the peep show, dressed like a whore. Another on the skytrain in that
  outrageously slutty outfit of bikini top and microskirt. Pictures of her made
  up outrageously. 
Oh god, she thought, they've been watching me all along, taking pictures. 
She was almost prepared for the pictures of her in the alley, taking two of
  her rapists on at once, the expression on her face almost one of bliss as a
  large cock sawed into her mouth, while one plunged her from behind. 
But she wasn't at all prepared for the next pictures of her in her own apartment,
  nude and slutty, dressed in different kinds of lingerie, playing with dildos.
  In many, her eyes were closed in apparent ecstasy, her face slack with implicit
  bliss. Cocks hovered over her, their owners out of camera range, semen dripped
  on her breasts and face. In some, her lips closed around. The pictures kept
  coming, getting worse. Was that her in sixty nine with a ... Child? Oh my god,
  was she sucking a dog's cock? An aching feeling grew in her stomach as her
  guts knotted. 
These can't be real, she thought. They can't, can't possibly be real. But
  they were all taken in her apartment, if they were fakes, then they were well
  done. The backgrounds, the familiarity of her home made them terrifyingly real
  to her. 
�You drugged me!� She typed with a sudden burst of insight. 
�Whatever you say, bitch,� Mike replied, neither confirming or denying. �But
  that's really you sucking that dogs cock, and licking thirteen year old pussy.� 
�No! No! I don't remember that!� 
�So? Do you remember the other pictures? Slutting out? Going to peep shows?
  Getting double teamed? I suppose you don't remember those? You weren't there
  for those.� 
�STOP!!!� Lynsey hammered the keys. 
She stared at the screen, trying to control her heartrate. 
�Look,� she wrote, �I'm not going to the police, okay.� 
The others noted this surrender. 
�But it's over, okay. It has to be over. The game is finished, and I don't
  want to play any more.� 
For a few seconds, the screens were silent. Then Mike's response came back. 
�You stupid bitch....� he wrote. �Of course the game is over. Let me tell
  you about the game. We won, you lost. You made the rules, you lost, and now
  you live with it.� 
Lynsey stared at the screen with numb horror. 
�And hey, when you were making the rules, you set the prize. You remember
  what the prize was? You were the prize. We got you. You lost, we won. Now we
  own you. Do you understand that, you stupid fucking cunt. The game is over
  and we own your ass, and we get to keep it, it's not yours any more.� 
The words sank into her, filling her. 
�Do you understand? You stupid bitch?� 
The screen stared at her, the letters blinking mutely. She stared, a sinking,
  surrendering feeling suffusing her. Desperately, some small part of her searched
  for a way out. 
�I said, do you fucking understand, you stupid ignorant, self absorbed bitch?� 
She stared. Six men held their breaths, waiting.... 
�Yes.� She typed finally. 
�Yes, Sir, you stupid cunt.� Mike answered. 
�Yes, Sir.� She typed. 
All over Vancouver on a handful of men celebrated at their computer screens,
  phoning and congratulating each other. It was over, the long struggle with
  the bitch, the war against her was over. She had surrendered, they owned her
  now, body and soul. 
�Finally. Goddamn, but you're slow and stupid. We'll have to fix that. Right
  now, we're going to play... Here is how we want you to get dressed. You understand.� 
�Yes, Sir,� she typed dully. 
Instructions flashed on the screen, vividly detailed instructions on lingerie,
  dress, makeup. They knew every article of clothing that she owned, she realized.
  They knew everything about her. She was trapped. There was no way out... 
�Got that?� 
�Yes, Sir.� 
�Then get started you stupid cunt!� 
There was no resistance left in her. �Yes Sir' she typed, and then went to
  obey her masters. 
* * * * * * * * * 
Epilogue: One year later. Lynsey wearing little more than a bra and g-string
  cruised through the strip bar, looking for someone to buy a lap dance from
  her. 
She was dressed in very little, teeteringly high spiked heels, a thong which
  revealed far more than it concealed, and a too short, too sheer tank top whose
  fabric revealed her heavy nipple rings and which didn't quite manage to cover
  the undersides of her breasts. Her breasts were slightly larger, after a few
  months, they had gotten bored and had them enlarged. They looked impressive
  now, but still not quite outrageous. There was a heavy matching ring in her
  navel, and another pair of labia rings not quite concealed by her thong. A
  discerning observer might have noticed that her lips had been artificially
  enhanced, though not to an outrageous degree, or they might notice a discrete
  but very clear branding scar on her ass. There was a line of chinese characters
  in heavy black across the small of her back, just above her tailbone, which
  translated as a series of instructions to excite and inflame anyone who might
  have been able to read them. 
Apart from that, Lynsey had changed very little physically. She was much the
  same. Oh, she was definitely more toned and fit, more flexible and limber,
  her skin and hair shone from careful attention, after all, her masters were
  very attentive to their investment. But anyone from her old days would have
  recognized her in a second, and sometimes they did... with invariably interesting
  consequences. 
She made eye contact with a customer, and slid smoothly over to sit on his
  lap, briefly working his knee against her pubic mound as she did so. Her nipples
  hardened automatically. 
�How you doing, honey,� she purred, smiling. She'd been taught to purr and
  smile, taught to always look sexy and inviting. It was second nature to her
  now. In fact, if she'd thought about it, she might not have been sure that
  she knew how, any longer, to turn it off. 
She ran her fingertips through his hair, and then down the front of his shirt,
  and then down into his crotch where she probed at his cock. She felt it twitch
  under her fingers, felt him squirm a little. 
�You want a little dance,� she purred, �I'm very good. You won't be disappointed.� 
Her masters had taught her very well the consequences of any sort of disappointment.
  She had learned to do whatever she had to not to disappoint. She'd become very
  good at it. If Lynsey had not changed too much physically, the changes internally
  had been profound. She was now a very willing, very eager, very desperate fuck
  toy, it defined her, it was the sum total of her identity and of her imagination.
  She literally could not even conceive of being anything else, her horizons
  encompassed only cocks ringing her universe, penetrating her. 
�Maybe later,� the man said. 
Lynsey assessed it. He'd just come in. Let him watch a few shows, get a few
  drinks in him... She leaned down, stroking his cock into half life. 
�That's cool, remember me when you want a good time.� 
Lynsey drifted off looking for the next one. She had a quota to meet after
  all, the Masters expected a minimum from her every night. Over there? 
This one was willing. Smiling, she lead him up to the private booths, past
  the bouncer, who nodded without looking at her. She had sucked his cock earlier,
  and now that he'd relieved himself of his load, he wasn't particularly interested
  in her or any of the girls.. 
The club liked her, she was their hardest worker. The other girls liked her
  a lot less, she kept to herself, she didn't chat with them much, she just worked
  and worked. There were rumours that she did more than she was supposed to.
  That was bad for their business. 
The truth was that Lynsey did anything and everything. She didn't think about
  it much. Certainly, she worked at not thinking about her old life at all. This
  was her life, for better or worse. 
On the stairs, her cell phone rang. It was Mike of course. The phone was dedicated,
  only her Masters could call in, and she could only call out to a single number. 
�Hey bitch,� he said, not bothering with pleasantries. �You're quitting early
  tonight, I'll pick you up at 11:00. I've lined up a dog show for you, german
  shepherd, guy wants a private video. Wear the black one piece, fishnets, and
  some goth makeup.� He hung up. There was no question of her agreeing or disagreeing,
  no details to be worked out, no mutual respect. He gave orders and she obeyed,
  so nothing else was needed. 
She nodded unconsciously, and put the phone away. 
�Who was that,� the client said, reaching up behind to feel her ass. 
She smiled back at him, leaning her ass into his palm. �Just an appointment,
  nothing to worry about.� 
She lead him into the private booth and straddled him. There was no worry
  about money, clients always paid, and if they didn't... that was the bouncers
  job. 
�I've heard of you,� he whispered. 
�Have you?� 
His hand cupped her cunt, something normally not allowed, she got wet almost
  instantly. He slipped a finger inside, making her gasp slightly. 
�You have heard of me,� she whispered, and smiled, riding his finger. 
They had always, from the beginning, trained her body against her. Teaching
  it to respond, making connections, training and conditioning it for sexual
  arousal, sexual response. Her mind, her personality, that was secondary. Condition
  her physical responses, they believed, and it would be that much easier to
  warp her soul. They were right. 
The man chuckled, feeling her cunt drawing at his finger. He flexed it in
  her and withdrew, noting her disappointed mew. This is one hot slut, he thought
  to himself. A lap dancer who loves her work. 
Her job, her career, was long gone of course. Her employers had not had patience
  with her continually deteriorating performance, her inappropriate dress, poor
  attitude and extensive sick days. They had let her go, and in doing so, had
  poisoned the waters for her. She wasn't able to find a new job, even if they'd
  been willing to let her take one. 
Rather, they had other careers in mind, another life. They'd meticulously
  strip mined her assets of course, cleaning out her bank accounts and credit
  balances, selling off her investments and personal property, until she was
  all but penniless. They did this while enjoying themselves on her body, distracting
  her with nonstop rapes, burying her in a swamp of defilement and orgasms. 
Then they introduced her to her new career as a toy. There were other words
  for what she did of course, stripper, lap dancer, peep show girl, occasional
  prostitute, live sex show performer. But toy summed it all up. They taught
  her what to do, and she learned it diligently. They taught her to smile and
  moan as she danced on strangers laps, or spread her legs for a batchelor party
  gangbang. And she did exactly as she was taught. 
For two reasons, of course. First, the consequences of not doing it, they
  showed her, were appalling and painful. She still felt clenches of fear and
  terror over some memories. That was Jack's specialty, and it was always a collective
  decision when they loosed him upon her. The others normally kept his sadism
  in check, until and unless she needed to be shown the error of her ways. 
And second, and more persuasively, they taught her to come. Trained her body
  to respond and orgasm in obedience. Reduced her to a passive creature of physical
  arousal. So of course, she found her mind shaped. Easier, always easier, to
  simply go along, do what was ordered, what was expected, to enjoy the wetness
  between her legs, and to come. Because, after all, they were all about keying
  her up, heating her, making her wet and shivering, and eventually, when she'd
  simmered long enough, making her come. The career that they placed her in was
  all about sex and sexuality, arousal and orgasm. Slowly, she stopped thinking
  outside of that. 
She stroked his cock with her fingers, rubbed her face against it, pushed
  her breasts. She let his hands rove wherever they wanted. Climbing over him,
  simulating sex. Even this contact aroused her, leaving her at the edge of panting.
  Every time his fingers found her pussy she was wetter. They went two dances
  as she crawled and slithered, heating him up. During this time, she thought
  about nothing but the man under her, his hard cock in his pants, his touch
  on her body. Her mind was empty. 
She was resigned to her fate. There'd been a period of resistance, which they'd
  ruthlessly smashed, then depression which they'd terrorized out of her. They
  were relentless in their exploration and excise of her entire life, they left
  her nothing of her own, they did not stop until she was entirely theirs. There'd
  been escape attempts, quickly found and brutally quashed. There had even been
  men, sympathetic men who turned out to be decoys and traps. Lynsey no longer
  had any trust in any of the strangers she serviced. Perhaps they were real,
  perhaps decoys, their promises and thoughts were worthless. All she cared about
  now was the money they gave her for her owners, and the heat they put between
  her legs. 
Her life had been pared down. Her home was now a one room apartment dominated
  by a huge bed. That she'd been allowed a television and dvd player was for
  the convenience of her owners. Her clothes were merely an assortment of slutware,
  non-slutware had been disposed of. She was forbidden to read, forbidden any
  pleasures but sexuality. Her name had been legally changed, friends and family
  carefully thrown off the trail, although as a touch of humiliation, they had
  her dance and prostitute under her old name. She was forbidden any human contact
  except her owners. To have more than casual acquaintance with her fellow lap
  dancers invited a beating, they carefully poisoned any chance of relationships
  there making her offer studied insults to the other girls, who had learned
  to dislike her. The men were simply objects of money and service. 
But she loved her work. The only power they allowed her, the only control
  over her own life that they granted, was the ability to make men hard, to suck
  their cocks, to satisfy their urges, to make them want her and take her. In
  a sense, it was the only bit of her life that they allowed her to have, the
  power and pleasure of sex. So she loved making men hard, loved knowing they
  wanted her, she loved the way they felt between her lips or up her ass or deep
  inside her cunt. Of course, it was in their interests to make her this way,
  their manipulation of her identity, of her drives, had been thorough, and very
  successful. She knew she was a sex toy, and they had taught her to love it. 
The strip clubs she worked understood only that they held and paid her earnings
  to them, they didn't much care. If they'd understood what had been done to
  Lynsey, they might have volunteered more girls for the treatment... she was,
  after all, an excellent earner. 
�One more dance?� she husked, grinding her crotch against his thigh. Sometimes
  she would actually come while lap dancing. Always, a session left her hot and
  aroused, quivering with the need for a hard cock. 
�I was thinking of a special dance,� he said. 
�Oh?� Always let them tell you, you could hint, they told her, but you couldn't
  proposition. 
�An oral dance,� he said. 
�Oh my,� she whispered. He watched her reaction, there was no reluctance.
  He decided to go for broke. 
�Suck my cock,� he told her. 
Her hand slid down, stroking his cock in his pants, measuring the long hardness. 
�It costs twice a regular lap dance,� she whispered, smiling. 
�Fine,� he choked. 
She unzipped him fishing his rock hard pile driver out, and smiling, slid
  down between his legs. 
Lynsey was now an income producing property. She worked almost non-stop, her
  time divided between two strip clubs and a lucrative but erratic escort business.
  In fact, they were making quite a bit of money off of her. They made her understand
  that was now her duty, her mission, to make them money, to make them as much
  money as she could. If she made them money, she came, she came a lot. If she
  didn't.... She shivered at the thought. She preferred to come. 
Her owners certainly never wondered or cared about her wishes, or whether
  she had deserved what they'd done. The justice of what they had done to Lynsey
  was established by the fact that they could do it to her. Their ability to
  do it meant simply that she had deserved it all. Somewhere along the line,
  while breaking her utterly, they'd ceased to think of her as human, but merely
  as an odd sort of property. 
This didn't mean that they hated her. Indeed, they all felt a vague sort of
  fondness for her. After all, she was the one who had brought them together,
  had united them with purpose, had been the canvas on which they had perfected
  their techniques. They had other victims now, other income producing properties,
  but in a sense Lynsey was special because she was the first. 
They had plans for her. With careful maintenance, adequate diet and sleep,
  and perhaps minimal cosmetics and surgery, and of course avoiding damage or
  scarring that would reduce her earning potential, she would go on to be a valuable
  income producing property well into her forties. 
After that, of course, her looks and body would deteriorate quickly, her price
  would drop, it would be time for hard and intensive use, perhaps more dramatic
  cosmetic surgery, burning her out to produce another ten years of productive
  revenue. A cheaper fuck, a more desperate fuck, her reduced earning power being
  compensated by heavier and harder use, more fucks, more brutal fucks, more
  degenerate acts, cigarettes and whips and other cruelties whose scarring was
  now financially worth the damage it did to her already dropping market value.
  By the end, there wouldn't be much left to her. 
At that point, she'd be offloaded to some desperate low end pimp willing to
  squeeze a few dollars out of her worn and used up carcass, she'd spend her
  days, if she lasted much longer, in some menial position, wiping the semen
  from peep show booths or cleaning the urinals in some filthy bar. If she lasted
  that long, if she lived that long. 
They didn't especially care. She was a revenue producing property, and their
  objective was merely to maximize her revenue production over her working life
  cycle, the same as with any other piece of revenue property. Lynsey, perhaps,
  on some level, understood this, which meant that she worked hard not to think
  of it. There was nothing she could do about it, after all. So best not to think
  at all, simply concentrate on the now, the bare moments before her, the cock
  in her mouth, and coming. 
Lynsey teased the cock, rolling her tongue around it, blowing it, nibbling
  the head. With one hand she held the shaft, squeezing the vas deferens to ensure
  he would not come too soon. She slid her mouth over it, and then slid further,
  deep throating it with merely a gutteral noise, before sliding back to work
  the head in her mouth. 
The man groaned, his hands wrapping in her hair. Lynsey always had messy hair
  it seemed. His hips lifted with arousal. She held her neck loose, in case he
  would begin face fucking her. They often did, when they were ready to come.
  But he wasn't close yet, there was so much more she could do. 
She reached under with her free hand and began to play with her dripping cunt,
  plunging her fingers in again and again, working her clit hard. There was nothing
  at all in her head, except the cock in her mouth, and the arousal radiating
  up from her clit. 
If Lynsey ever thought about things any more, if there was anything to her
  more than the immediate need for the next lap dance, the next cock, the next
  blow job or fuck, she might have pondered her situation. Was she unhappy? No,
  not quite happy or unhappy, she'd been reduced to animal levels of sense and
  sensuality, the question was meaningless. If happiness was coming, then Lynsey
  was happy, that's the best that could be said. 
Abruptly, towards the end of the song, his grip tightened, tearing out blond
  hairs that he'd find wrapped around his fingers later. He slammed her head
  down on his crotch, marvelling at the weightlessness of her, the lack of resistance.
  He began to fuck her throat brutally. Her wrist worked harder between her legs,
  the only sound out of her was a series of quick grunting gagging gasps the
  matched the tempo of his brutal face fucking. 
If she had been able to contemplate what her life had become, she might have
  been horrified, or perhaps not. She had lead an existence of drift and emptiness,
  in that sense, it was hardly a crime that deserved the fate she had found.
  But then again, it had made her vulnerable to, made her receptive to what they
  made her into. If she had not been an empty vessel, then they could not have
  taken or shaped her. 
He spurted into her mouth. She swallowed it all without hesitation. Afterwards,
  he paid her the agreed amount, zipped up and left the bar. Lynsey, he hair
  disordered, breath smelling of semen, a light sex sweat on her body, headed
  down to the bar, to make eye contact, to do more dances, suck more cocks, to
  degrade and humiliate herself, to make her masters money... Until eleven, when
  they would come to take her to fuck a dog, which she would do willingly, which
  she would enjoy, because that was what they had made her. 
So perhaps she did deserve her fate. Ultimately, unlike so many people who
  drifted through life, she had found what she deserved, what she was made for.
  She had gotten exactly what she deserved, had become exactly what she was meant
  to be. 
A man caught her eye. In his pants, there was a cock which would become hard
  for her. She smiled and walked towards him ....
