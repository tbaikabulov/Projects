&nbsp;

The muffled hum and bustle of the downtown streets gets
dimmer now as you take the left turn enveloping yourself in the alley way
walls, mummified.� You know where you
are.� This moment seems old, oblique in
its familiarity yet as ordinary as two naked lovers.� Lightning pierces the horizon with intimacy
allowing shadows to dance and write on urban designs, yet each shadow seems to
have purpose, destiny and charisma.� You
look at your watch not missing step.� Its
3:00AM and every breathe is in time
with your stride� only moments now.�
Thunder claps and crashes on your concentration.� �Will she be waiting, expecting me? Of course
not� you mutter to your mind.� �Will she
know me?�

&nbsp;

You emerge from the passageway
and you see your objective not but a few steps from where you pose.� A cigarette� your lighter� where is your
lighter? Standing under the flicker of a street light among many, your Zippo flips open and the metallic click echoes and
panics back towards your now seemingly historic steps.� You inhale and wonder why you wait.� Wonder if she will remember you; remember
your touch, lips and eyes, and your purpose.�
Why do you wait?� Its not fear or
hesitation� Is it?� Another drag� a
reflective pause.� Smoke streams from the
benign glow of your cig circling and twisting into deformity, into beautiful oblivion.�� Once more you put the filter to your lips
and pull the intoxicating bitterness into your lungs, almost wantonly.� With one last glance over your shoulder you
give silent homage to the night and let your cigarette plummet to the ground as
it forfeits its existence under your determined step.� �Move forward�, you tell yourself� the time
is now, Advance!

&nbsp;

The building entrance bolts open
as you approach; an anonymous Mr. gives you an
anonymous nod as you grab the door before it slams shut.� The cold metal handle gripped, burning,
taunting in its quiet lust.� How would
you have gotten in if not for the stranger?�
It�s been so long and your keys, lost now� a casualty of an epic journey.� You turn to find him, the stranger, to return
the nod but the early hour shadows have stolen him as they often do with
strangers.� The first drops of rain have
come.� You can hear them cut the air and
collapse on the lapels of your coat, an erotic free fall� a simple Baptism.� You step in through the threshold and your
portal pounds shut behind.� No turning
back, you know what you want.� You know
what she silently craves. You remember everything, always.

&nbsp;

Each time your boot caresses a
step the wooden ascension and the leather that encases your foot groans sith anticipation, like the quiet sultry moan of a young
girl discovering ecstasy in white picket fenced subdivisions.� With purpose you climb steadily and rhythmically
until you reach her red door.� Suddenly you
know exactly who you are if for only one brief moment of clarity.� You are sexual, you are carnal,
and you are libidinous.� You raise your
hand and turn the knob� Locked!� But your
fingers still kiss the fixture, almost afraid to let go.� You panic for a moment and you put your other
hand flat against the wood surface trying to feel her through the blockade,
trying to project your heat and appetite.�
You can almost smell her scent.�
Obstacles have always seemed like an aphrodisiac.� You remember the key, the secret key taped to
the bottom of the plant beside the door, that plant!� Carefully, you tip the pot and pull the tape
back.� With a clink the metal submits to
the floor.� It�s cold in your fingers� one
last breath.� Her body and essence awaits
your spirit, your cravings and your hunger.

&nbsp;

Silently you enter closing the
door behind you as gently as you would kiss a young virgin breast.� The leather of your trench coat crinkles and
whines in the silence of the night with every move, every twitch.� You can hear her breathing through the
bedroom door.� You are intoxicated by her
innocence and scent� that scent, your expression is almost ravenous as you
reflect� You touch the door surface, fingers so calloused, so wise.� You can almost feel her flame like the
devouring inferno burning in the pit of your guts.� You turn the knob but it�s unlatched and the
door gently caresses the darkened space and releases her delicate fragrances� angelic,
brazen, and scarlet.� The dim light
breaks through behind you, around you.�
You stand and feast on her form gently shaped by the audacious
aura.� The silence distinguishes you and
eases you towards her.� Silence has
always been your ally, your device.

&nbsp;

You stand over her watching her
body rise and fall with each and every weary breath.� Yours are in time.� The sheets invading her, fondling and petting
her as if alive savagely covering only those spots that you must devour.� A leg, an arm, and her neck left exposed to
the night� Exposed to you� You are at home in the darkness� this particular darkness�
and her hair, flowing and shimmering down her spine to the gentle curve of her
back that you have fallen out of time with so many times while delicately
tracing your intent with your tongue and your teeth.� You feel hot, feverish as you sense the
simple strain in your groin pressing against your jeans.� Pressing against your conation and you feel
power� illicit and contemptible� delicious and raw.� She stirs, and the devilish covering reveals
its mischief, shifting slightly to expose more delicate, supple flesh.� You groan as your hand involuntarily grips
your enshrouded cock.� Her foot dangles
free over the edge of the mattress.� You
gaze upon it licking your lips, licking your pretense into submission.

&nbsp;

Only moments have passed but
eternities have been built and destroyed in less time.� You swallow hard as sweat forms on your brow
and spine.� Clench your fists and calm
your nerves.� You are him after all, and
he is part of you� is you.� The one she has wanted and the one she has
loved since the first touch, the first time you kissed, the first time you
smelled her sex.� The first time you
growled in her ear with such fever and greed� �I need to fuck you
completely!�� You pull your coat over
your shoulders and quietly place your shroud on the floor beside you.� Sit beside her now!� Your knees almost refuse to bend but your
will is sturdier.� The bed squeaks and
groans as it takes your weight.� She inhales
deeply and begins to turn.� You stop her
with one steady hand on her creamy shoulder, but she smells your cologne, the
old warm leather of your trench coat and the lingering scent of tobacco.� �I�ve been waiting so long for you.�� You are silent.� �I didn�t think you were coming back,� her
majestic eyes still shut.� Yet still you
do not speak.� You caress her hair and
tuck it back behind her ears.� Leaning
down you gently kiss the side of her neck, her temple, her cheek.� You know she can feel the heat of your breath
raking across her skin as you approach her ear.

&nbsp;

�I�ve missed you,� You whisper
hoarsely while gently caressing her hair.

�Make love to me, it�s been so
long,� her sweet groggy voice disturbs your moment and you put a finger to her
lips, �shhhhhhhhh� and she sucks it into her mouth,
circling it with her tongue and grazing her teeth across your knuckles.� Your groin throbs as she groans and you feel
the vibration down to your boots, to your essence.� You could lose yourself here if you give
in.� Remember� Resist.� And you pull your fingers away from her beautiful
lips as she desperately gasps.� For a
moment you consider unzipping your pants and letting her fuck you with her
mouth in that way that only she can, only she has learned.� But you are stronger than that!� �Tonight we play a new game.�� You breathily mutter so she can feel your
words.� She sleepily smiles and before
she speaks you put a hand over her mouth.

&nbsp;

Her eyes have still not
opened.� Still she lies in that euphoric
state between sleep and wake but you feel her smile on the palm of your hand.� You stand and she rolls to her back and her
eyes meet yours for the first time in days, weeks.� Intensity shoots from your stare and
bewilderment crosses her brow.� �What
kind of game?� she questions, or provokes?�
Secretively and composedly you unbutton your shirt and pull it out from
your belt fastened jeans and let it fall to the floor.� The remains of light from the window strikes your chest, defining your form and she sighs
contentedly.� One step closer and bridge
the distance between you and her, like barriers crumbling in front of a
determined force.� And her hand reaches
for yours.� You hold it for a moment
caressing it between your fingers with one last thought of giving in to
tenderness and falling to her side to kiss her breasts, her thighs, and her
perfect cunt.�
You release her hand without a sound and before she speaks you pull the
sheets from the bed slowly, exposing her body.

&nbsp;

She lays still, one arm by her
side the other above her head.� You
examine the sheer white nightgown, you love that one.� She wore that the second time you made
love.� She looked angelic, serene.� And in that delicate passion you fantasized,
dreamt while sliding and throbbing inside her of making her your whore, your
personal depraved courtesan.� You
hesitated then at exposing your barbarianism, will you now?� Still standing, you lean in close and put a
hand on her chest.� Gently your fingers
brush her skin and the neckline of the silky gown.� The fabric screams in your grip as you fill
your hand with the cherished garment.� In
a split second she meets your gaze wide eyed and surprised as you viciously
tear the fabric from her body in one motion, the tattered rag now in your
hand.� 

&nbsp;

You don�t think,
you can hear her asking, confused.� With
the other hand you pull her up to her feet and her body slams into yours, she
grunts breathlessly.� Your hand scrapes
up her spine� Badly manicured fingernails and labour
hardened palms begin to feast on her flesh and gnaw on its purity.� She feels your fist tighten as it intertwines
her hair, the strands locking around your knuckles.� Her eyes are on yours now, in you.� Her mouth distressed, anxious� And you pull
her to you hard, forcing her lips open with your tongue.� You pull her back look into her eyes once
more and see� feel fear, perhaps terror� This is what you wanted, wasn�t
it?� Yes, this is real!� You spin her around and force her down to the
bed stomach first and naked save her silk white panties.� You feel your blood boil your cock twitch and
throb as you tear the last remaining piece from this work of art.� Sobbing, she looks back at you over her
shoulder.� �Don�t move!� you bark.� �Its time you learned how little whores get
treated!�� 

&nbsp;

She cries words like broken
grails but they don�t register� or do they?�
They fuel your fire don�t they?�
You stare right through her for a moment but she starts to move.� You grab one wrist, two and wrap the
shattered nightgown around her wrists� no tighter!� She is speechless now, breathy whines
replaced by sobs, tears.� Your heart
crunches and fills crunches and fills.�
You are alive now; you are an inferno of lust, of animalism�love.� Her satin hands struggle but secured� you
release your grip.� She hears your belt
buckle open, your zipper drag� tooth after tooth after tooth and she trembles.� You here her, she whispers sweet prayers to
generic creators and your cock screams to be released.� 

&nbsp;

Her perfect ass dances in front
of you, that divine pussy quivering for a nightmare.� You place a hand on one milky cheek and she
jolts as if her skin is blistering from the heat of your palm.� Run your finger over her cunt,
lightly, lighter, invade� as she gasps.�
Again she tries to cry� to plead.�
You reach for her tattered panties finger still immersed in her,
grinding, now two� No three and slam them hard against her, in her.� You purify her with your hand� again and
again.� Let her feel your Masterdom.� �Just a
prelude you little bitch,� you snarl.� And
before she speaks you shove the severed undergarment in her mouth.� Your nails scrape her scalp and your hand
forms a vice on the length of her silken strands.� Pull her to meet your gaze� fix.� But you say nothing and grunt hungrily.

&nbsp;

Poised behind her now, cock in
hand, and testicles swaying like cannon balls.�
One foot on the bed� grab her neck, gripping�
Pinch her nipple with the other hand no pinch hard, fucking harder.� She struggles and muffled whimpers, moans
escape from her in sighs� �If you want to hurt more, keep moving,� you
wrathfully lilt.� Release your holds,
grab her hips.� Terrify her cunt� cock like a reaper you sink into her completely until
your bodies collide.� You piston and
grind as you reach for her throat and you wrap your fingers around it,
clenching, suffocating.� Harder you crash
and pull, master and teach.� Your body
aches to its essence.� Time could stand
still as energized as you are at this moment.�
Tenderly you mash her pussy with all of you, everything that you are.� You thrust with the force of a savage
barbarian.� Her gag falls free� �Fuck me
you bastard,� she cries.� �Rape me like I
am the last cunt on earth!�� 

&nbsp;

Your silhouettes bend and contort
in the darkness.� And you are charred to
your soul, lost in your precious victim.�
Your cock tightens, your gut quakes, your thighs pulse and your mind
scorched with hunger.� Impale her again,
again� again as your breath draws in. �You explode lusciously, drenching her to her
shadows and soaking her mind in mouthwatering cruelty.� And you collapse on her trembling body, sweat
soaking her.� Spent, your body rolls to
her side as she turns to meet your eyes.�
You hand kisses her burning flesh as she quivers and shakes. Your finger
slides through her beaten cunt as you coat it in you,
your body and mind.� You offer it to her
and without a word she engulfs her reward and savours
you, still fixed in your passionate survey.

&nbsp;

�I am yours now,� a single tear
rolls to your cheek as you stare off into darkness.

�I love you� she ponders.�
