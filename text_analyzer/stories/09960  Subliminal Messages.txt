 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The noon sun came in through the window of Lilly Chen&#8217;s office and reflected off the glass of her framed MBA degree and into her slanted eyes. Lilly was reading the business profile of a dog food company called Little Bites. Ms. Chen is the youngest president in the history of Savory Treats dog Food Company. The last president retired a month ago and after careful interviewing and researching candidates, the board of directors elected a young, energetic and fiercely intelligent woman who had an impressive knowledge about how to market dog food (and probably any other product for that matter) and was running her own business before she got her bachelors degree in chemistry. Despite being her first week on the job, she seemed very at home in her corner office. Her confidence was larger than the oak desk she sat behind. Lilly pressed the button on the intercom on her desk and asked to be connected to the secretary.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Hi, this is Ms. Chen, can you please ask for facilities to come into my office after hours to hang my framed degree on the wall behind my desk, I don&#8217;t like where it is�. Said Ms. Chen. She got an enthusiastic reply in seconds.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lilly was not always so formal, in fact there might be a time when she would like to be on a first name basis with her employees, but at this point she needed to establish authority. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tammie Reynolds was busy at work in her office at Little Bites Dog Food Company. To most of the world, she was known as Ms. Reynolds the president of Little Bites Dog Food Company. A smaller and less profitable company then Savory Treats dog food. In fact, while Savory Treats was the 3rd largest dog food company in the nation, Little Bites was tied for 10th largest with another company. Ms. Reynolds was a smart woman and knew that from a business point of view, Savory Treats was simply out of Little Bites league and was happy having little to do with them. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; 
Sitting across from Tammie Reynolds was her assistant Ryan Jenkins. No need for anyone to know too much about him, no one ever really cared and he liked the anonymity. Ryan was until recently the janitor working the day shift at Little Bites dog food office building. Six months ago he was working on a psychology degree. When he was about halfway done, he dropped out of school when he asked himself �what is a janitor going to do with a psych degree?� However, he did still have a few months left on his subscription to a psychology magazine. On the day after Ryan decided to drop out of school, he was sitting around his studio apartment contemplating what he was going to do with his life. He checked the mail and had a mildly amused look on his face when he saw the next issue of the psychology magazine had been delivered to him. He flipped through it and an article about the possibility of mind control caught his eye. He figured since he gave up on serious psychology research, there was no harm in reading this schlock of an article. He was interested in a part of the article that talked about subliminal messages and how they were once used in movie commercials to encourage people to buy popcorn and drinks at the theater. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ryan went back to work the next day as usual, however he could not stop thinking about that article. So, as an experiment, Ryan dug up a DVD video him and some friends made of a road trip they took last summer. He went to his local library and got on a computer that had some video editing software. He inserted one frame of a picture of a burger in the beginning of the road trip video. Nothing too fancy, but for someone with no video editing experience, it might as well have been a graduate school project. Ryan invited the friends he took the road trip with over for beers. After they arrived and were hanging out, he casually mentioned they should watch the road trip video just for kicks. The guys agreed and took seats on the one small sofa or the floor and Ryan played the video on his 32-inch flat screen that he had bought at a garage sale. After the road trip video was over, he asked his friends what they thought. One of the guys said he was hungry and everyone else present agreed that they felt hungry too. Ryan said he was about to put a pizza in the oven and there was sour faces in the room. One of the guys suggested burgers and then everyone nodded or gave an enthusiastic yes. 
Ryan realized he was on to something. Ryan spent more time at the library researching subliminal messages. He used the libraries software to teach himself video and sound editing. It took him a few weeks to get a handle on making his �subliminal inserts� seamless. After a month and a half, he was able to insert his own �message� into a song, edit the volume and pitch. Soon he was able to put in his own words, subtle suggestions into his favorite songs. Ryan would give rides to friends; play a homemade CD in the car that he had edited with subliminal messages. At first he would hear �I think there is something wrong with your car&#8217;s CD player, the speakers are making the songs sound weird� from his passengers. Three months later and a lot of practicing getting the �subliminal inserts� in their without sticking out, complaints were exchanged with �It&#8217;s cold, can your turn up the heat� when it was 85 F degrees outside or the passenger kept staring at their watch because something was telling them they were late for an important event. In the back of Ryan&#8217;s mind, he thought to himself �Well done, now its time to have some real fun�.
Ryan never really saw himself as having a future with Little Bites Dog Food Company before. He wanted to try something that might improve his career. Ryan, now armed with both knowledge of subliminal psychology and enough technology know how was going to perform an experiment on the staff. The president of the company, one Ms. Reynolds liked to have an hour of classical music to be played during the lunch hour of noon to 1pm. A few days ago Ryan volunteered to be the one who turns the stereo on at the right time. On this particularly bright Monday morning, Ryan came into work with a CD that he had edited with some interesting subliminal messages. The secretary had a Mozart CD waiting for Ryan when he arrived first thing in the morning and he put it in his bag. At 11:58 am Ryan took out not the CD the secretary gave him, but the one he made himself. Ryan made a calculated guess that the CD that would be given to him to play would be Mozart, as that was a known favorite of Ms. Reynolds.
It did occur to Ryan �What if the secretary realizes that the music playing is not exactly what was on the CD she handed to him�? That was okay, since one of the subliminal messages on the CD was for everyone to focus not on the music so much as the message. The only thing he knew for sure, was that if a song can make a person in 85 F temperature feel cold, then a whole CD could potentially make that same person not only feel cold, but convince them to walk barefoot toward the desert.
After Ryan turned the CD on, he stepped outside where there was a concrete picnic table where sometimes people go to get fresh air our have their lunch outside. No one but him was out there at that time. Everyone in the company got an hour for lunch, and most of the staff took it at noon so that meetings could be planned without missing one person on account of them �out to lunch�. Ten minutes into the lunch break, the only I.T guy in the company came out and handed him a can of diet sprite. Ryan did not care for diet sprite, but it had to be diet Sprite. If Ryan programmed the subliminal message to be � I.T guy bring me a soda, any soda ten minutes into the lunch break�, then he was missing an opportunity to see if the messages could be specific. If you&#8217;re going to brainwash someone, might as well go all the way. The diet Sprite came on time. Ryan took a sip of his cold diet Sprite and thought of the list of subliminal messages he put in the CD. Obviously he did not walk around with a list, which could possibly be incriminating evidence, should someone put 2 and 2 together. Ryan memorized every subliminal instruction that is on that CD.
1. Ryan Jenkins is to be given control of the music that is played everyday at noon. The choice of music is not important, focus on the messages.
2. The I.T guy is to provide Ryan Jenkins with a diet Sprite every day, 10 minutes into the lunch break. This may be discontinued
3. Ms. Reynolds, the president of Little Bites dog food will for now on insist that her mother is Ms. Reynolds and that she prefers the less formal Tammie or missy Tammie.
4. Ryan Jenkins will for now on be called Mr. Ryan Jenkins. It suits him, as he deserves everyone&#8217;s respect. 
5. Tammie Reynolds will no longer use the parking spot reserved for the president. Only Ryan Jenkins will have that privilege. 
6. Tammie Reynolds will offer Ryan Jenkins a position as her assistant. He will be relieved of his janitor duties and a salary of $40,000 a year.
7. No one is to question Tammie Reynolds decision to hire Ryan Jenkins as her assistant. Otherwise, it will be business as usual. 
8. This message is for Tammie Reynolds only. If you are not Tammie Reynolds then you will not remember command #8. Tammie Reynolds is to obey every command, suggestion and piece of advice that Ryan Jenkins gives her. Tammie Reynolds will reply to every command, suggestion and piece of advice with saying �I&#8217;ll take that under advisement�. 

Ryan could have gotten greedy and asked for more money, but that would raise questions. He used the rest of his lunch hour to buy and eat a candy bar from the vending machine. Everyone including Ryan went back to work at or around 1 pm. As Ryan moped floors and restocked paper towels, he kept asking himself �will the subliminal messages work� or �even if they are going to work, how long will it take before the subliminal messages become convictions and convictions become actions�? He only had to wait 2 hours to get his answer. 
The secretary found Ryan Jenkins busy at work. 
�Hello Mr. Ryan Jenkins. Ms. Tammie�I mean Tammie would like to see you in her office, but there is no hurry, please take your time�. Said the secretary.
Ryan found that interesting. Secretaries are taught to speak to people politely, at least while on the job. However, she always just called him Ryan, so there is some evidence that the subliminal messages are working. She slipped on the name a little; guess no system is perfect. The big question is, will he become Tammie&#8217;s assistant or not? Ryan was going to put the mop away and go see Tammie immediately. Then something occurred to him, since Tammie is suppose to obey him, maybe Tammie told the secretary to convey to Ryan that there was no hurry. When the secretary told Ryan that there is no hurry, was that the secretary talking, or was she told by Tammie herself to say exactly that? Ryan took his sweet time putting things away, even stopping to get a cup of water from the break room. Worst case scenario he could claim he was cleaning up a nasty spill that needed his attention right away.
Ryan went to Tammie&#8217;s office about 20 minutes after the secretary told him to go see Tammie. He looked at the nameplate next to the office; it read �Tammie Reynolds, President�. Ryan liked that, had it said Ms. Reynolds or Ms. Tammie Reynolds, it would need to be changed. Ryan knocked on the door and announced that he was there to see her. If he were just a plain old janitor, it would be silly for him to announce he had arrived, especially since she asked for him. It would have been more polite to simply knock. Tammie told him to come in. Ryan opened the door and stepped into Tammie&#8217;s office, shutting the door behind him.
Tammie had a nice office, the only window faced a park, a wooden desk, and the artwork on the walls was mostly inspirational posters in frames. Ryan had never been in her office before and had only seen Tammie herself in passing in the hallway, since as a janitor he never had any business with her. You could not tell that Tammie was a tall woman, since she sat behind a sturdy desk. She had her blonde hair in a loose ponytail; she wore matching burgundy skirt and jacket with a white blouse complete with a thin gold necklace that rested above a generous bosom. Ryan thought to himself that it was a shame that a blouse/jacket combo hid her nice rack. Tammie was in athletic shape, she often worked out after work. Tammie shot Ryan a bright smile when he stepped into the room.
Ryan had a skinny man&#8217;s build, so much so he almost looked rubbery. In fact he was somewhat self conscious about it, when he looked at himself in a mirror he thought he resembled a guy who was not fit to join the armed forces. He saved money by cutting his own brown hair with an electric razor, it did not always look right, but he figured he did not need to look fancy for his job. His skin looked unnaturally pale thanks to long hours in the library and a less than healthy diet. At least he would not have to worry about fighting a pudgy stomach.
�Please take a seat Ryan,� said Tammie.
Ryan cleared his throat loudly and stood still. Raising his fist to his mouth for emphasis. 
�Please forgive me, Mr. Ryan Jenkins please have a seat� said Tammie.
Ryan realized he hit the jackpot. His subliminal messages worked. Sounds like there are some kinks to iron out, but the seed is there and that was enough. Ryan walked over to the two chairs that sat facing Tammie&#8217;s desk. He thought it might be fun to complain about the chair she offered him, just to jostle her, but thought better of it. Ryan took his seat.
�So, what can I do for you�? Asked Ryan.
�Mr. Ryan Jenkins�. can I call you Ryan�? Asked Tammie.
Tammie had a confused look on her face. She could not understand why she would ever want or have an urge to call him by such a formal title. Ryan reminded her that he is to be called Mr. Ryan Jenkins. This seemed to clear things up for Tammie.
�Yes then, Mr. Ryan Jenkins. I don&#8217;t believe we&#8217;ve ever been properly introduced. I&#8217;m Ms. Reynolds�.� Tammie said, but stopped mid sentence.
�Take your time sweetheart,� said Ryan, enjoying the show.
�Please call me Tammie, My mother is Ms. Reynolds�. Said Tammie
Tammie had to work on that last sentence. It sounded so unfamiliar and yet so right when she said it. She nodded her head and carried on.
�Well, the time has come for me to hire an assistant. I&#8217;ve never felt the need for an assistant before, but I had a moment of clarity and decided that now is the time to hire one,� said Tammie.
�Oh? Is this an interview? I wish I had known, I would have prepared,� said Ryan.
Ryan deliberately acted sheepishly, as if he felt overwhelmed. 
�No, I wish to offer you the position as my assistant, and if you accept you will earn a salary of $40,000 a year starting immediately,� said Tammie.
�And if I don&#8217;t accept�? Said Ryan.
That was an interesting loophole that Ryan just now thought of. What happens if you make a subliminal message and then frustrate the person by denying them? It&#8217;s one way to make a person uncomfortable.
�I can offer you my parking spot. It&#8217;s very close to the front entrance,� said Tammie.
�That is a very nice offer, agreed,� said Ryan.
�So, as your new assistant, tell me what you need to get done today�? Inquired Ryan.
Tammie listed off some reports she needs to read, a phone conference with the Sacramento office in an hour and the possibility of a merger.
�Tell me about the merger�. Said Ryan.
Tammie went on about how one company could do some business maneuvers and then they could �acquire stock� and a �hostile takeover� could happen.&nbsp; Ryan rolled his eyes; he was a psych major, not a business major. He was not interested in all that. 
�You obviously have a lot of work to do and you don&#8217;t need me here for your very important phone conferences. I&#8217;ll just take some magazines and go read in an empty cubicle just outside your door. Holler if you need me� said Ryan. 
�Yes Mr. Ryan Jenkins�. Said Tammie.
Ryan picked up a couple of business magazines that were sitting on a table in the office, grabbed the last bottle of sparkling water from Tammie&#8217;s personal fridge and walked over to the empty cubicle. Ryan could not believe his luck. It took less than 10 minutes to go from janitor to assistant to the president, given a huge raise, the president&#8217;s parking spot and to top it all off took the boss&#8217;s last sparkling water without so much as a raised eyebrow. He was feeling pretty pleased with himself. Ryan flipped through the magazines; he couldn&#8217;t really appreciate what the articles were about since he was not familiar with business jargon. Ryan was browsing his 3rd magazine when a picture caught his eye. It was a portrait of a young Asian executive named Lilly Chen. She was dressed in a grey pantsuit with a pink blouse, her black hair hanging down one shoulder. She had a bright white smile, a classic round Chinese face, and a hint of perky boobs under a grey jacket. Ryan could not tell for sure, but he&#8217;d bet she had slender and firm legs. He read the snapshot of her profile that included her education, job experience, hobbies, and current position. His suspicions were confirmed. She plays tennis; she must have firm legs. 
Ryan allowed himself a few minutes to daydream about a fantasy that involved him, Lilly Chen in a tennis instructor outfit and a private sauna. Ryan read the article. He found out that she was educated at an Ivy League school (smarts), started her first business at age 20 (smarts and ambition) and was newly elected as the president of Savory Treats Dog Food Company (smarts, ambition and money). Ryan wanted to think about her as girlfriend material, but then shock himself out of it. The article mentioned that before Lilly became the new president, Savory Treats Company had �merged� (there&#8217;s that word again) with another company. Ryan was able to piece together that merged was a fancy business term for one company buys another company and gets all of its assets. He also found it interesting that the merger caused Savory Bites to go from being the 5th largest dog food company to being the 3rd largest. That made Ryan wish he had paid more attention when Tammie talked about a merger earlier. Ryan spent the next 4 hours deciphering more business articles, found himself a business dictionary so he could teach himself business lingo and occasionally stopped by Tammie&#8217;s office just to ask her if everything was okay. 
Ryan was feeling hungry (and a little horny thinking about Lilly Chen and tennis equipment). He popped into Tammie&#8217;s office and shut the door behind him.
�Hey Tammie, how late were you planning on staying today?� asked Ryan
�Oh, not sure. I&#8217;m usually the last to leave. There is always loose ends�. Said Tammie.
Ryan realized that besides arranging for himself a nice upgrade in the career department, he hadn&#8217;t really tried anything too brazen with the brainwashing he seemed to pull on the staff. 
�Hey Tammie, do you live alone?� asked Ryan.
�Yes I do, why do you ask?� asked Tammie.
�Just curious. For now on, when I ask a question, just answer. Never ask why I&#8217;m asking a question, okay?� asked Ryan.
�Yes Mr. Ryan Jenkins� said Tammie.
�Hey, I&#8217;m going to be a little broke until payday. Spot me $20 and I&#8217;ll go grab us some sandwiches,� said Ryan.
Tammie was frozen for a minute. Something was amiss. Money was a very personal thing; it&#8217;s not something you give away just because someone asks. 
�Tammie, as your assistant, I suggest that I go get you and myself turkey clubs. Can you loan me the money?� asked Ryan.
This time Tammie did not hesitate to reach into her purse and pull out $20. Ryan remembered to use the magic word �suggest� and that seemed to get things running smoothly again. Ryan took the money from Tammie, went out and bought the sandwiches and returned to her office. The two of them were soon eating and making small talk.
�Is there any news on the merger?� asked Ryan.
�Well, it looks like Savory Treats Company might be interested in acquiring us,� said Tammie. 
�They want to buy us?� asked Ryan.
�Yes, that is correct,� said Tammie. 
�The president of Savory Treats is Lilly Chen?� asked Ryan
�Yes I spoke with her on the phone today� said Tammie
�And if they were to buy us, what would happen to your staff?� asked Ryan.
�If they were to buy us, it would not be my staff anymore. It would in effect be Savory Treats staff and it would be up to them to keep or let go anyone working for Little Bites,� said Tammie. 
That gave Ryan a lot to think about. He was looking forward to following Tammie to her house and then and he likes to put it �put the stuffin in the muffin� but it sounds like he has some work to do. 
�Is there anyway to prevent Savory Treats from buying us?� asked Ryan.
�I would say no. Even if we did not agree to a merger, they could buy the majority of our stock, thus becoming the majority stock holder and in effect own us� said Tammie. 
�How far along is this merger?� asked Ryan.
�Savory Treats Company and Little Bites are in negotiations now. We are aiming to have a decision made by the end of this week and then the merger process will take several weeks� said Tammie.
Ryan contemplated all he just heard. If Little Bites was bought out, then all the hard work he did was for nothing. Savory Treats will buy his company, Lilly not Tammie will be his boss and he does not have her under mind control. He will lose his job, the pay raise not to mention the parking spot. It was one thing to use subliminal messages at Little Bites because they were a small company, too small for anyone to find it strange that the former janitor was all of a sudden the assistant to a senior member of the staff. Ego was another matter. Little Bites is a homegrown company, started by a few people in this very city, their activities rarely made the business pages and no business magazine ever did an article on the president of Little Bites. Savory Treats was another beast all together, a large company, large enough to acquire other companies, led by a highly intelligent career woman who was hungry to make a name for herself. In other words, his subliminal messages was enough to land an assistant job at Little Bites, but was a parlor trick when it came to Savory Bites dog foods company. 
�What do you know about Lilly Chen?� asked Ryan.
�She is ambitious, focused and a keen negotiator. I spoke with her on the phone today. She is well informed about the dog food industry as a whole and has a surprisingly good grasp of how our company performs, relative to hers�. Said Tammie
Ryan nodded as he listened. Lilly was the big leagues and he was an assistant coach to a team that would never see a world series. Ryan had to put his dreams of being a kept man who lives rent-free at Tammie&#8217;s house on hold. If Ryan wanted to keep his cushy job and lifestyle, he would need to think of a way to get Lilly to play for his team. 
�Tammie, I&#8217;m going to need to take a couple of days off. I have some research I need to do for the company. I command that you arrange a meeting with Lilly for this Friday at noon. Offer to cater lunch, any food she wants. I need you to be as accommodating as possible. I&#8217;ll be back later in the week�. Said Ryan. 
�Yes Mr. Ryan Jenkins. I&#8217;ll take that under advisement�. Said Tammie.
Ryan looked at his watch; it was 6:45 pm. It took less than 7 hours for his subliminal messages to completely sink in. Ryan stood up and stretched, it had definitely been a big day for him. Ryan had one last thing to do before he went home and got to work on an improved subliminal message. 
�Tammie, I command you to come over to me and give me a blow job. I suggest you take off your heels and walk over to me on your knees�. Said Ryan.
�I&#8217;ll take that under advisement�. Said Tammie.
Tammie removed her heels and left them neatly sitting under her desk. She got down on her knees and with remarkable balance was able to walk on her knees toward Ryan. Ryan was getting excited and relished unzipping his pants and letting his dick pop out of front hole of his boxers. Tammie had a poker face expression; it almost made Ryan wish he had told her to smile while she came over, but was too horny to care about that now. Once Tammie came over she parted her mouth just the right amount and swallowed his salami. She slid her mouth back and forth making the juicy slurping sounds. His dick got herder and she used one of her hands to hold his shaft steady. The feel of her delicate hand on his junk aroused him and he started breathing harder. Ryan put a hand on either side of Tammie&#8217;s head to encourage her to go faster. It was not long before he shot his load into her mouth. Ryan told her to swallow and she did. Ryan was feeling like a million bucks and Tammie had a bad taste in her mouth. Ryan stepped back and zipped up his pants. 
�Go back to your desk. Finish any work you have, because starting tomorrow your most important job is arranging that meeting I talked about. I&#8217;m going home now�. Said Ryan. 
�I&#8217;ll take it under advisement� said Tammie.
Ryan went home and went straight to bed; he had a lot of work ahead of him. He got up early, showered and had a big breakfast. He spent all of Tuesday doing research on subliminal messages. His research also pointed him in the direction of the power of peer suggestions. Perhaps one of the reasons that Ryan was more successful in mind controlling Tammie was that he got promoted to her assistant. Tammie is more likely to give serious thought to what her assistant has to say, rather than the guy who cleans the toilets. He had no relationship whatsoever with Lilly. Ryan spent Wednesday at the library learning how to use power point and video editing software. A power point presentation was an interesting idea, but was too slow to slip in even one frame that did not belong there. Ryan felt a little frustrated and what he felt was a lack of progress.
One of the librarians saw Ryan sitting there with a deeply concerned look on his face.
�Hello sir. Is everything all right?� asked the librarian.
Ryan explained that he was struggling to create a business presentation the way he wanted. The librarian inquired whom the presentation was for. 
�Well, my company will be having a meeting with people from another company and I want a way to summarize what my company is all about. But I can&#8217;t quite find the right style of presentation�. Said Ryan.
�Have you thought about making a video tour of your office building? That way they can see the company and at the same time you can talk about it. Give these people some real insight to what your company stands for,� offered the librarian.
A light went off in Ryan&#8217;s head. He thanked the librarian for his help. Ryan would put together a straightforward video that was both a tour and a presentation. He could edit in the subliminal messages later. Ryan went home and got to work on the basic idea of how the video would be made. 
Ryan went back to the Little Bites office on Thursday morning. Ryan went straight to the I.T department and spotted the company&#8217;s only I.T guy.
�Good morning are you busy?� asked Ryan.
�Good morning Mr. Ryan Jenkins. I tried brining you a diet Sprite the last two days but I could not find you�. Said Steve of I.T
Ryan slapped his head. He was so busy getting his shaft polished by Tammie he forgot to tell the I.T guy to stop bringing him a diet Sprite.
�Call me Ryan, please. Don&#8217;t bring me a diet Sprite anymore; you have enough to worry about. What is your name?� asked Ryan.
�Steve� said Steve of I.T
�Steve, do you have access to video equipment? As Tammie&#8217;s assistant I want to make a tour video of Little Bites, for business clients and what not. Do you think you can help me out?� asked Ryan.
�Yes and yes. If it&#8217;s for Ms. Reynolds then I&#8217;ll make it my top priority�. Said Steve.
�You are a big help. I made an outline of how I want, I mean how Ms. Reynolds and I agreed to have the video made.� Said Ryan showing Steve his notes.
The first half of the video would be compiled of 15 second long scenes with Tammie narrating information about the company. Open with footage of the front of the office building, then a pan view of the staff busy at work, animal supply store clerks selling their dog food, still images of pictures of the staff with their families at company parties. The second half of the video would be of Tammie walking around the office building taking about the mission of the company, history of the company, and occasionally stopping to talk with employees and ask them why they like working for Little Bites. The video was about 15 minutes long and on the surface summarized what the staff and environment was like at Little Bites dog Food Company. Filming took about half the day, especially since the staff was busy and it was hard to find an employee who was not so busy they could stop and talk with Tammie without showing any sign of needing to be somewhere else. Ryan and Tammie spent the lunch break doing an audio recording of Tammie telling the history, mission statement and some interesting facts about the company. Ryan and Steve spent the next several hours editing the video, layering the audio track onto the video footage, and arranging the scenes in the order that was both visually pleasing and logically organized. There would be no way Ryan could do all this editing in one afternoon by himself. 
�Thanks a lot Steve, I mean it. I owe you a beer after I&#8217;m done with my project. I&#8217;m going to need you to copy this video to a DVD so I can watch it at home and make sure it looks just the way I need it to� said Ryan.
Steve nodded and made the DVD copy that Ryan asked for. Ryan went home and got to work on editing the video. He was so busy working it was 8 pm by the time it occurred to him to make some dinner. Ryan baked the frozen pizza that was turned down by his friends that preferred burgers. He stayed up to almost two in the morning to get the audio and visual subliminal inserts into the video seamlessly so that it was more persuasive. Ryan made a focused list of subliminal messages, which appear as a single frame every 3 seconds in the video.
#1 Lilly Chen will work her hardest to acquire Little Bites Dog Food Company.
#2 Lilly Chen will retain all the employees of Little Bites Dog Food Company after acquiring them. 
#3 Once Savory Treats acquires Little Bites Dog Food Company Lilly Chen will promote Tammie Reynolds of Little Bites Dog Food company to vice president. Both Tammie Reynolds and Lilly Chen will obey all of Ryan Jenkins orders when it comes to business decisions. 
#4 Lilly Chen loves to eat dog food in the presence of Ryan Jenkins.
#5 Lilly Chen has a strong desire to please and sleep with Ryan Jenkins, assistant to Tammie Reynolds of Little Bites Dog Food company. 
#6 Lilly Chen enjoys watching this video everyday. 
#7 Lilly Chen has a tennis fetish. Lilly Chen gets very aroused when she sees or touches any tennis equipment. 
Ryan only got a few hours of sleep before he would go to work and put his subliminal magic to the test. It occurred to him that an assistant to the president of a company should not be wearing the jeans and shirt he wore as a janitor. He only owned one suit that he has not worn since last year at a family members wedding. Ryan did not have time to iron the shirt or polish the shoes. He took one look in the mirror, straightened his hair a little and grabbed the DVD before he went out the door and to the office.&nbsp; 
When Ryan got in, he went straight to Tammie&#8217;s office. She was at her desk talking on the phone. Ryan politely waited for her to finish her conversation. 
�Who was that?� asked Ryan.
�It was Lilly Chen. Her and some of her associates will be here for a meeting at noon. I&#8217;ve arranged for a seafood company to cater lunch. You, Lilly, her business advisor, her accountant and I will be there. Everything has been arranged Mr. Ryan Jenkins� said Tammie.
�That is what I want to hear,� said Ryan.
Ryan spent the morning in Tammie&#8217;s office. When Tammie was not taking calls or reading reports she gave Ryan her undivided attention. Ryan explained that he had a great video compiled that would inform and summarize what the Little Bites Dog Food company was all about. Ryan handed her the disk and told her for public relations reasons it was important that she play it at the beginning of the meeting and to tell anyone who asks that it was made by the staff. A can of Little Bites dog food sat on Tammie&#8217;s desk acting as a paper weight. Ryan picked it up and put it in his jacket pocket, that can gave him an idea. Ryan handed Tammie the classical music CD with subliminal messages that he made. He told her to play it on her computer whenever she had a chance. She replied by saying she will take it under advisement.
The catering company came at quarter to noon to drop off the food. Just as the catering company was leaving, Lilly and her associates were arriving. Tammie and Reynolds shock hands with their guests and introductions were made. Ryan especially enjoyed shaking hands with Lilly, her hand was delicate, her grip pleasantly warm and it allowed him to get close enough to smell her perfume. No pantsuit for Lilly, she was wearing a navy blue skirt, black heels, and a white and gold shirt under a navy blue jacket. Ryan liked the more feminine look, but was disappointed by her small tits. He jokingly thought that he should have added another subliminal message for Lilly to go get breasts implants. Ryan led: Tammie, Lilly and Lilly&#8217;s business associates to the meeting room and held the door for everyone. Ryan was hoping no one noticed him starting to perspire. The last thing he needed was for something to go wrong with his video.
Everyone at the meeting helped themselves to some food and took a seat at the table in the middle of the room. Tammie did not serve herself yet and announced that her staff made an informative video about the company and its employees and she would play it now for everyone to watch while they enjoyed their lunch. While Tammie was turning the video on, Ryan took the can of dog food out of his jacket pocket and placed it on the table in front of him (he had made a point to sit opposite of Lilly). 
�Why is that on the table when we are trying to eat?� asked Lilly with a disgusted look on her face.
�Your right, I picked it up earlier and its been weighing my jacket down� said Ryan as he picked it up and put it back in his jacket pocket.
Everyone present watched the video and enjoyed a delicious lunch of fish, salad and breadsticks. Once the video was over, the consensus was that it was an enlightening and enjoyable film. Lilly said to give her compliments to whomever made it. Lunch was over and it was time for the meeting to go into full swing. Ryan got to see Lilly Chen in action; she was witty, knowledgeable and was about to make convincing arguments and never once raised her voice or appeared to get emotional. Tammie was no slouch either; she was older than Lilly and had more field experience. The word dog food was used a lot, as you would expect in a meeting between dog food company executives. Thirty minutes into the meeting Ryan noticed that Lilly started to salivate a little and she would wipe her mouth with a napkin. Fifty minutes into the meeting and Lilly was fighting the urge to look at Ryan&#8217;s pocket where there was a can of Little Bites dog food. The meeting lasted an hour and it was agreed that the merger between the two companies would go forward. Everyone there shock hands and said good-bye. Ryan made sure to collect the DVD he made before walking out of the room.
Tammie and Ryan walked Lilly and her associates to the parking lot. 
�Ms. Lilly Chen, I thought you might want this, as a symbol of positive business relations� said Ryan as he offered Lilly the can of dog food from his jacket pocket.
Lilly stopped in her tracks and turned to look at Ryan. She started to drool right away and was immediately embarrassed. What has come over her? 
�No thank you. I don&#8217;t want to be reminded of how I almost lost my appetite and what would have been a perfect meeting� said Lilly.
Ryan did not take it personally. He was amused to see her turn the can down, but at the same time she had a look in here eyes like she was hungry for dog food. Tammie and Ryan waved goodbye and Lilly and her associates got in their cars and drove off. Ryan thought the meeting went well. Lilly spent the ride back to her office fighting the urge to think about eating Little Bite dog food by the spoonful.
�Tammie, lets get in your car. We are going to the nearest pet store and buying as many cans of Little Bites dog food as we can,� said Ryan.
�I&#8217;ll take it under advisement� said Tammie.
Ryan was starting to think that reply was getting old. Tammie bought 40 cans of Little Bites Dog food. The clerk in the store suggested that it would be more economical to buy a bag of Little Bites dry, bagged dog food, but that did not serve Ryan&#8217;s purpose. It took Ryan and Tammie 3 trips of carrying bags of dog food from her car to her office. They took the back entrance so no one would notice or ask questions. Four hours later Ryan and Tammie were eating the leftover seafood from the meeting earlier in the day. 
�Tammie, do you have Lilly Chen&#8217;s business e-mail?� asked Ryan.
�Yes I do,� said Tammie.
�I command you to e-mail Lilly and give her my home address, directions to my address and make sure you use my full name.� Said Ryan.
�I&#8217;ll take it under advisement� said Tammie.
Tammie found Ryan&#8217;s address in the employee database and e-mailed it to Lilly.
�Tammie, do me a favor. Next time I tell you to do something, just nod. Don&#8217;t say anything okay?� said Ryan.
Tammie paused for a moment and then nodded. Ryan hoped that was the last time he would have to tell her that. 
Ryan was exhausted from too little sleep last night. He told Tammie he was leaving, for her to have a good weekend and took one can of dog food with him. Ryan drove home and didn&#8217;t even make it to the bed; he just plopped onto the sofa and passed out. Ryan spent Saturday cleaning his studio, doing some grocery shopping, even went out and got a proper haircut (he needs to look sharp at his new job as assistant to the company president). 
Meanwhile, Lilly spent Saturday thinking about three things: eating dog food, sleeping with Ryan Jenkins and a sudden urge to play tennis. She went to a pet store and bought a couple cans of dog food and took them home. She ate half of one can, but couldn&#8217;t help thinking that it would have been better if Ryan was around. Then Lilly showered and changed into her tennis outfit. Grey and white tennis shoes, white skirt, a green and white-collar shirt and a yellow cap, however this made her feel horny. Lilly thought playing a pick up game at the local tennis club would relax her. Lilly went to the tennis club and saw one of her tennis friends. The two women talked, agreed to play each other and they found an empty court. Fifteen minutes into the game and Lilly was starting to think of the racquet as a phallic toy. Thirty minutes into the game and her vagina was on fire. Lilly told her friend she was not feeling well and needed to go home early. Lilly drove home and once home she sprinted out of her car and into a cold shower as fast as her slender and firm legs could carry her. She masturbated in the shower.
Lilly woke up with a ravenous appetite on Sunday morning. She went to the kitchen and finished of what was left of the opened can of dog food. Her appetite was not satiated, there was something missing. Lilly went on her computer to research why she would be craving dog food. She got a notice that she had a new e-mail. Tammie sent Lilly Ryan Jenkins address and directions. Lilly felt that burning sensation in her vagina again and a shower would not be enough this time. She put on her tennis outfit, grabbed her purse, keys and printed out the directions to Ryan&#8217;s apartment. 
Ryan was home on Sunday morning, drinking his breakfast from a gallon of orange juice and watching the news. He heard a loud knock on his door, this kind of bummed him out because he was in a shirt and boxers, so he had to put on shorts to answer the door. Ryan made himself decent and looked through the peep hole and saw Lilly standing on the other side of the door. He was glad he decided to see who it was. Ryan opened the door and liked what he saw. Lilly was in mid thigh tennis shorts that showcased her athletic thighs and hint of curvy hips. Her hair was in a ponytail and covered in a cap, looking every bit the part of his fantasy Lilly. 
�What brings you to my neck of the woods?� asked Ryan.
�I know it was rude to invite myself over, but I wanted to talk to you about the merger and it could not wait� said an obviously distressed Lilly.
�come in, come in and why are you dressed like that?� asked Ryan.
Lilly lied that she was on her way to a tennis match and she happened to be in the neighborhood. 
�Is that the smell of dog food on your breath?� asked Ryan.
Lilly could not contain herself anymore. She nodded her head vigorously and asked him if he had any dog food in his apartment.
�As a matter of fact, I have one can of Little Bites dog food. But you don&#8217;t want that� said Ryan.
�Yes I do, I&#8217;ll buy it from you now!� said Lilly now standing very close to Ryan.
�Tell you what, you can eat the whole can, but I get to spoon feed it to you� said Ryan.
�Yes, I agree� said Lilly licking her lips hungrily. 
Ryan reached into a cupboard and pulled out one can of dog food, Lilly was starting to salivate. Ryan looked at Lilly&#8217;s eyes widen as he used the tab to slowly peel back the can lid. 
�If Lilly wants some dog food, she will get on her knees like a good girl� said Ryan.
Lilly did not have to be told twice, she got on her knees right away. Her mouth was open and her tongue seemed to reach out like a beggars hand. Ryan tossed the lid into the sink. He dipped two fingers into the can to cover them in gravy. He pulled his fingers out and slowly brought them to Lilly&#8217;s lips. Lilly moaned and she licked his fingers, it was her nectar. Ryan got a spoon and started to spoon feed Lilly. Ryan got to the 4th spoonful and acted as if he slipped and dripped the dog food onto Lilly&#8217;s shirt. 
�Oh no, your shirt is dirty you bad girl. If you want more dog food you will take your shirt off and lick it clean� said Ryan.
Lilly grabbed her shirt and lifted it off her torso. It was a beautiful sight to see her breasts jiggle free above her washboard abs. Lilly used her tongue to lap up each gram of gravy in her shirt and tossed it aside when it lost its flavor. Ryan handed Lilly the can of dog food and Lilly devoured the contents. 
�Look at you, you like eating dog food don&#8217;t you?� asked Ryan. 
However, Lilly neither nodded nor said yes she instead responded with an intense stare. Lilly stood up, put one hand on both of Ryan&#8217;s shoulders, jumped into the air and wrapped her python legs around her waist. Ryan and Lilly started playing aggressive tongue hockey. Ryan carried her to his bed and lowered her onto it. The two of them started undressing quickly. Lilly had a fantastic body, smooth skin and well trimmed bush, strong thighs for fucking and cute tits that made her look more innocent.
Lilly laid on her back, spread her legs and gave Ryan a &#8216;fuck me now&#8217; facial expression. Ryan grabbed her ankles, lifted her legs into the air and started to pump her. His dick slid in and out of her. Lilly moaned loudly because her tight twat was burning and each thrust felt better than the last. Ryan grunted as he tried to get all of his manhood in her asian vagina. Ryan let go of her ankles, so Lilly wrapped her legs around his waist and she used her leg muscles to bring him closer to her. Ryan leaned in, his hands now planted on either side of her. He fucked her hard and second put a bigger smile on her face. He cummed in her and she experienced an earth shattering orgasm. Ryan rolled onto the bed and then Lilly rolled her sweaty body on top of his. 
�That was great baby. Was it good for you?� asked Lilly.
�It was damn good. But we need to talk about getting you a boob job. I like my woman&#8217;s tits to be more than a handful.� Said Ryan.
�I&#8217;ll take it under advisement� said Lilly as she planted a playful kiss on his check.
