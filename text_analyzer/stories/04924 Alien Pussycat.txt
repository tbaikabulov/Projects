Alien Pussycat

�By: Arnold Puttwyn � 2006

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

����
The story of a future time
when colonists from The Earth return to capture primitive natives and using
surgery and retro-gene splicing with advanced medical care create exotic
pets.� 

��� Neela Parker�s whole
world nearly ended when her father unexpectedly died.� She had no future, no ambition, and no life,
but when she was made over into a pet catgirl she found herself. 

&nbsp;

Neela

&nbsp;

���� Neela Parker pulled her, thin
faded black denim jacket around her narrow shoulders as the cold wind blew
against her back.� She sat on an
age-smoothed nameless granite headstone, her butt felt cold and she shivered as
the cold from the rock pierced her deep inside.�
Neela�s old Levi�s were little protection from the bitter wind of late
October in mid-Maine.

���� She sat in the old overgrown
cemetery often; she slipped out the shabby back door and ran the 2 miles to the
unattended cemetery whenever she could.�
Her father was buried hundred�s of miles from here, but she could only
visit here.� She picked an old headstone
whose name was worn away by the elements many years ago, and assigned it to her
father.� She could visit him �by proxy�.� 

���� Her �fathers wife�, Brenda,
was Neela�s entire family now that he had passed away, she felt totally
alone.� Brenda told Neela that she had to
move out by the end of this week or start to pay rent.�� She wanted a lot of rent.

���� Neela graduated from high
school a year ago and tried working as a receptionist and a waitress several
times, but she was not interested at all.�
Many of the jobs were from friends of her father, trying to help her
out.� She had been kept on several times
when she should have been fired, but when she just didn�t show up at all, there
was no other option. 

���� A small girl at only 5 feet
tall and weighing just 87 pounds, her figure was lean with a tiny waist and
slender hips.� Neela�s chest was flat,
and punctuated only by her delicate pink nipples.� She�d never worn a brassiere.� She was quite pretty with flashing bright
blue eyes and a button nose.� Neela was
cynical and unhappy with life and did her utmost to infuriate her stepmother as
she became more sullen and withdrawn.� 

���� She wore her straight black
hair very short and with heavy black eye make-up, lipstick, and nail polish,
she was a Gothic Princess.� Neela�s
naturally pale skin and numerous facial and ear piercings completed her Gothic
appearance.� Her surly attitude finished
her Gothic demeanor.� 

���� 

���� She didn�t look up when the
intense brightness lighted the entire cemetery and the surrounding bare trees
stood starkly as shadowed monuments to warmer days and happier times.� Neela believed the caretaker in his pick-up
or the police stopped again, to tell her she had to leave.� The deputy sheriff assigned to this area had
escorted Neela home on many cold nights.��


���� When Deputy Marks didn�t
approach after a few minutes, she looked around carefully.� She didn�t see any vehicle stopped in the
cemetery driveway, and she didn�t feel cold anymore.� At first she thought it was fear or concern,
but she realized the bright light was warm, very warm.� 

���� Soon a soft buzzing began, the
noise became a whoosh, like a strong summer wind blowing through the grape
arbor behind her house.� She soon felt a
pressure in her temples; a throbbing that became a headache.� Her eyes began to water and her tears ran
freely, her heavy black make-up ran too.�
Neela lost her balance and began to fall backwards; she windmilled her
slender arms to try to regain her seat on the stone, but she couldn�t right
herself and fell headlong.� The last
thing she remembered seeing was her black Doc Martin�s as she went over
backward.

&nbsp;

Cygnas

���� 

���� Neela opened her eyes and
tried to sit up, but she couldn�t raise herself from the polished metallic
tabletop.� She was surrounded by medical
equipment beeping and shushing all around.�
Hovering above was an oval fixture that made her an island of light, and
the rest of the room a dark shadow.� 

���� A smooth, black plastic band
crossed her bare chest above her little breasts and under her arms, and a
second band low over her belly held her chest and pelvis firmly in the center
of the narrow table. Her arms and legs were also pinioned to separate portions
of the table.� Neela was naked, and
spread-eagled on the table and she could feel the presence of a catheter
filling her urethra.

���� At first she thought she had
been injured when she fell from the headstone, and was in a hospital emergency
room.� A man (?) wearing a white lab-coat
over green surgical scrubs, walked into her vision and looked her over, but it
wasn�t a human.� It had gray fur covering
it�s entire body, at least all that Neela could see, it�s head and forearms and
hands.� Neela tried to scream, but only a
yowl and then a hiss came out before she fainted.

&nbsp;

Dr.
Walks

&nbsp;

���� Ag�lnyphinsse Wakal�oines
became Dr. Walks to the humans she met on Cygnas when she moved in to open her
research hospital.� She was not
forthcoming about her origins, but she certainly was not entirely human.� She was bi-pedal, and easily used appliances
and implements designed for daily human use.�


���� Dr. Walks was nearly 6 feet
tall, and very slender, but her most distinctive feature was her pelt.� She was completely covered with short gray
fur, her arms, legs, back, front, and even her face. Her body was very slender
with narrow shoulders and hips, and nearly pipe-stem legs and arms.� Of course she wore clothing over her body,
but her head, arms and legs were uncovered.�
Her exotic appearance and great intellect became the subject of
conversation in many homes and businesses.�
She was soon accepted as a local physician and family doctor.� Dr. Walks, an accomplished surgeon, was only
interested in gene research, and she found that humans were great subjects.� 

���� After a false start when she
tried to work on local residents, a consortium was developed by 3 Cygnian
businessmen to bring off world �primitives� in for research subjects, others
were brought in for modification and sale as pets for profit, and to pay for
Dr. Walks research.� The most popular,
and profitable, were human catgirls, especially the smaller variety.

� 

Neela�s
New Life

&nbsp;

���� Neela woke up again, but much
later, laying prone in a cage or large wire kennel.� Looking around she saw that she was in a
square, light green painted room with endless medical equipment constantly
beeping around a large open center space.�
She was naked, but the place was warm so she didn�t feel cold, but she
was still scared.� Her throat hurt
slightly, but her hands and feet hurt terribly.�
When she held her fingers up her hand was completely bandaged.� Each finger was swathed and then the whole
hand was covered with coarse white gauze.�
Her feet were covered with similar bandaging, each toe and then her
whole foot and ankle was bandaged, she did notice that the catheter to her
bladder was gone.� When she moved jaw,
her mouth and gums were tender, too.

���� Neela hadn�t noticed yet, but
she was starting to grow thick black hair on the back of each arm, leg, and thigh,
her back was almost completely covered with soft black fur.� The catheter was gone now and she felt the
need to urinate, but there was no place to go in the kennel.

���� A human woman in an
old-fashioned nurses dress, complete with the folded white cap and white
stockings, came to the low kennel and smiled down at Neela.� Nurse Reynolds was quite tall and large, with
a pretty, rounded face and shining sapphire eyes.� Her patients all loved her immediately, and
she loved each and every one of them.

�� ���Are you awake, dear?� she asked.� �I�ll get you out for a while,� she opened
the kennel door for Neela to ease herself out.�
When Neela was outside the kennel the woman easily lifted and cradled
Neela in her strong arms, like an infant.�
Neela wrapped both arms around the nurse�s neck and lay on the stiffly
starched material covering her large breast. 

���� �Mmmhm,� Neela took a deep
breath, as she smelled the fragrant brown hair. 

���� �Can you stand, sweetheart?�
she asked after she crossed the room, and set Neela on her feet.� Neela stood uncomfortably between the
handrails of a therapy walker and held the railing gingerly with her sore
fingers.� 

���� �Try standing on your
tippy-toes,� she suggested.� �It�ll hurt
less,� she continued to steady Neela as she tried to stand.�� 

���� �Do you need to urinate,
dear?� Neela nodded quickly, and looked around for a toilet.� The nurse smiled at her and said, �No,
no.� Come over here,� and led Neela to a
huge litter pan.� Neela just looked down
at the long narrow brown pan of litter.� 

���� �Step over and put a foot on
each side of it Neela,� she directed.�
�Then just squat over it.� When
you get in place, just let go and pee in the litter.�� 

���� �I can�t piss in there,�
Neela, complained, but all that came out sounded more like, �Grrowll
Hhooowl.�� Neela looked quickly at her
and struggled.� No, no this can�t be,
she started to gasp and her breath came faster.�
Her temples began to throb.

���� �NEELA! Stop it!�
she shook Neela�s skinny left shoulder.�
�Calm down!�� The nurse popped an
ammonia capsule and held it under Neela�s short nose.� Neela took a deep breath of the ammonia and
coughed slightly.

���� �You�ll be all right dear,
just let me help you,� she reassured Neela with practiced ease.

���� She urged Neela over the
litter box and gently pressed down on Neela�s naked shoulders.� Crouching over the pan while Nurse Reynolds
held her hand for balance, she urinated into the gray granules. She started to
stand, but the nurse put her hand on Neela�s left shoulder.

���� �I want you to try to go more,
Neela,� she said.� �You�re over the box
now, and I�ll be leaving for the night soon.�
So move your bowels too, sweetheart.�
There won�t be much.� I�ll get you
some solid food in a little bit.��� 

���� Neela finished and looked up
at the nurse.� She helped Neela stand,
and then carefully wiped Neela�s anus, then her inner pussy lips and around
Neela�s urethra opening, with wet paper towels.�
She assisted Neela back to her kennel, without lifting and carrying
her.� Neela looked back to the litter-pan
and she felt a little pang, as though she wanted to go back and cover her
feces.

���� The left side of the dark
green double entry door opened just as the nurse closed the kennel door and
pushed the latch in place.� The same gray
furred doctor in the lab-coat came in smiling at the nurse.� When she spoke with her delightful
contra-alto voice Neela knew the doctor was female.

���� �Carmen,� she said
jovially.� �How�s our little kitty
today?�

���� �Well she used the litter-pan
on her own today,� Nurse Reynolds said brightly. �Then she walked back to her
kennel herself afterward, doctor.�

���� �Oooh, very goood,� she
squatted by the side of the kennel and looked in at Neela.� �You�re doing very well, little kitty,� Dr.
Walks smiled as she spoke.� �You�ll soon
be out there stalking mice.� �Right� 

���� �Let�s go, Carmen,� she said
as she stood.� �I�ll buy you a cup of
coffee before we close up.�� Neela
crouched in stunned silence, �Little Kitty� echoed in her head as she watched
the doctor and nurse leave.

���� True to her word, Nurse
Reynolds brought Neela her dinner.� It
was a bowl of strong smelling and mushy meat stuff.� Neela smelled it and just looked up at Nurse
Reynolds.

���� �That�s your dinner
sweetheart,� she said gravely. ��You
really should try to eat it.�� She turned
and left Neela with her dinner and headed out the door.� Nurse Reynolds turned off the lights as she
walked through the door.

� 

���� The short sleek black fur
growing over her body amazed Neela, but the hair on her chest and flat belly
was very sparse, and none grew on her nipples nor between her slender
thighs.� The � inch fur covered her head,
neck, and shoulders and thinned in a �V� between the top curve of each little
breast, and disappeared entirely at the top of her pussy lips past her anus to
facilitate cleanliness.� She also had new
triangular shaped ears with rounded tips, standing up above the usual human
location.� Her original, heavily pierced
human ears were gone.� Her new feline
ears were much more effective, though.�
The doctor made no changes to Neela�s eyes, but the gene work she
performed caused Neela�s blue eyes to gradually change to golden yellow, and
were much more effective at night or low light.

���� The most amazing change was
Neela�s mental attitude; she was not just satisfied with her new existence, she
embraced it with verve.� Neela was happy
and glad to have what she now was.� She
was proud of her new abilities and appearance.�


���� She still had tiny breasts
with pale pink nipples, each on a pink cone shaped areola, and no fur on
them.� A boob-job would have been nice� One day she showed Nurse Reynolds that she
wished she had bigger breasts.� Neela
cupped a hand under each little breast and lifted the firm flesh upward.

���� �Do you wish you had bigger
boobies, Neela?� she laughed.� Neela just
nodded.� �Well, I guess Dr. Walks could
have done that too.�� Neela dropped her
hands and gave a wry smile as she nodded with exaggerated motions.� 

���� The end of her nose was black
and the surface was leathery, she didn�t think it was very attractive, but she
could smell Nurse Reynolds bringing her food for nearly a hundred yards.� In addition to the �nose job� Dr. Walks had
made surgical alterations to Neela�s upper and lower jaws to form a slight
snout with very feline teeth and fangs, but she didn�t put whiskers on the
sides.� She also still had a tiny gold
ring through the left nostril of her stubby black snout.� It was Dr. Walks private joke.� Although she bore a great resemblance to a cat,
there was no tail.� She still looked
somewhat like a tiny and hairy woman.

���� As she was covered with black
fur and had no need for clothes, Neela remained naked.� Nurse Reynolds did not offer any clothing and
soon Neela was no longer concerned either.�
Being naked at all times was a bit hard to take at first.� 

���� Neela�s mental and emotional
transformation was much faster than her physical conversion.� Although she had been brutally kidnapped and
taken to a planet hundreds of light years away, and modified to look and act
like a cat, she wasn�t bitter.�
Occasionally she felt she was better for it.� No more stepmother nor dead end jobs.� She was taken even farther from her father�s
grave, but he would always live in her heart.

&nbsp;

���� She was kept in the medical
center, and not exposed to others, as a research project of Dr. Walks.� Neela was the favorite of Nurse Reynolds and
soon Dr. Walks too.� She was a fixture in
the lab and lately she was usually allowed out of her kennel during the entire
day.� She was secured in her kennel when
the med. center was closed and each night.

&nbsp;

���� The facilities housing Neela
were a part of Dr. Walks� research laboratory, and were not open for daily
public visitation.� The kennels housing
catgirls for sale were a kilometer away.�
It consisted of the main building containing Dr. Walk�s Labs and
operating rooms to build the catgirls.�
Neela was housed in a private lab Dr. Walks set aside for her more
advanced projects.� Neela was modified to
a higher degree and more feline than any previously made by Dr. Walks.� The retractable claws on her hands and feet,
and her teeth and fangs were changes she�d never undertaken before.� 

���� Neela�s heightened senses were
as a result of the retro-gene splicing where Dr. Walks changed Neela at the
cellular level.� A part of the researches
to see if she could incorporate such changes and then have them work.� Neela was a source of great joy to the
doctor, all of the modifications worked as well as though Neela was born with
them.

���� She had considered leaving the
ability to speak, but she was concerned Neela may not develop her new
senses.� Asking for things could be too
easy.

&nbsp;

Darlene

&nbsp;

���� Neela crouched beside the
4-foot log lying across the fenced dirt surfaced yard.� She spent as much time as possible out in her
exercise yard, she was treated to new sensations of scent and sound each time
the wind changed.� 

���� After several months her hands
and feet were completely healed.� When
she stood her feet just felt better when she stood on her toes.� Soon the calluses on her heels smoothed and
the skin on bottom of her toes became even tougher.� Every time she reached out with either hand,
or kicked with either foot, wicked claws sprang from the ends of her short
thick fingers and toes.

���� Neela was still very slender,
but no longer skinny, her muscles were getting harder and even bulged a
little.� Her black coat covered her arms
and legs, but her nearly hairless belly showed the outline of the muscular
squares of well-developed abdominals, and her little butt stood out now,
too.�� 

&nbsp;

���� The interesting aroma of the
approach of 2 people alerted Neela well before they came into view around the
corner of the medical center. One was a female, having her period Yyeecchh
and a man wearing a too much cheap, sweet aftershave. Double Yyeecchh� Neela watched as two people came to the fence
around her exercise yard.� A tall pretty
woman with gorgeous waist length blonde hair wearing a white sleeveless top and
short tight emerald green shorts walked quickly around the fence to try to get
as close to Neela as she could.� The very
tall man with her walked a little slower, but his longer steps carried him to
the fence with the woman.� He was dressed
in all black, including polished leather boots nearly to his knees.

���� The young woman, who looked
20, and the man who appeared older at about 70, stood over 30 feet away and
watched Neela as she stretched out on the tree bole.� There was a section where Neela had carefully
stripped away the dead gray bark with her claws leaving the bright bare wood,
where she now lay sunning her chest and stomach.� 

���� The woman was keen to see
Neela closer and called to her repeatedly.�
Neela ignored her, until she opened a slim cellophane package with a
small piece of sausage inside.� Neela
smelled the meat treat and walked directly to crouch in front of the woman.

���� �Daddy, she�s just what I
want,� the girl gushed.� �She has all
black fur.� I don�t see even one white
hair, at all.�� She broke the little
sausage into three pieces and carefully held one tiny bit through the fence for
Neela to eat.

���� Neela leaned forward and swept
the meat into her mouth with her pink tongue and smiled as she chewed, and
swallowed it.� She crouched by the woven
wire fence, waiting for the next piece of the spicy, greasy, sausage.� 

���� �We�ll see what we can do,
Darlene,� he sounded resigned.� He knew
his baby, the youngest of 5 daughters would get what she wanted, again.

���� �They want a lot for
her.�� He stepped to the right a few
steps to get a look at Neela from the side.�
�I hear they got her from old Earth.�

���� �Do they grow there?� Darlene
sounded amazed, thinking of a whole planet teeming with beautiful, sleek
Catgirls.

���� �No,� he chuckled.� �She�s the result of almost 6 months of
surgery and gene work.� That�s why she�s
so expensive.�

���� �Ooh.� Darlene looked a bit
flustered.� �Is it too much, daddy?�
Darlene asked softly.

���� �Almost, but I know you�ll be
good with her.�� Darlene was the first of
his daughters who ever wondered if anything cost too much.� He stepped close to Darlene and put his arm
around her shoulders.

���� �Ggrroowl.�� Neela wanted another piece of sausage.� Darlene hurried to slip another little piece
through the fence wire for Neela to eat.�
The sausage was finished immediately, and Neela sat with her mouth
opened for the next piece.

���� �Look�s like I�ve created a
little monster here,� Darlene laughed, but she was careful of Neela�s four
needle-sharp fangs as she dropped the last piece into Neela�s mouth.� �Last one, kitty.� It�s all gone.�� She held her hands up showing Neela her
opened palms. 

���� Neela stood immediately and
walked back to her seat on the log, she looked at them standing by the fence as
she stretched out again.� The man started
to laugh, and Darlene just stood with her mouth open.

���� �I guess that answers the
question about how much she acts like a cat,� he shook his head.� �Come on Darlene,� he turned to leave and
took Darlene�s hand.� �Let�s go see if I
can afford this.�

&nbsp;

� ����It�s time to come in, Neela,� Nurse
Reynolds called Neela in for her dinner.�
When Neela got in the food bowl was setting in her kennel, Neela hurried
in to eat and Nurse Reynolds closed and latched the door behind her.� It had been a week since the visit from
Darlene and her father; Neela had dismissed all thoughts about them after the
second day.

���� �We are closing a little early
tonight, so you have to stay in now, dear.��
She sounded so sad to Neela, instead of eating immediately she turned to
look at Nurse Reynolds.

���� �I�ll be all right,� she said
with great resignation.� �Even though you
know someday will come, it�s still no fun.��
She took a deep breath and sighed greatly, she turned quickly so Neela
couldn�t see the tears.� Nurse Carmen
Reynolds walked out through the door without looking back.

���� Neela turned slowly to her
dinner, and began to eat hesitantly.� Iickk

Her dinner was the same mushy meat stuff, but today it tasted even worse
than usual, flat and bland.� She was
hungry tonight; lately she seemed to need more food.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Chapter II

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

���� Neela hadn�t noticed all of
her own changes, so many things around her changed and she was still trying to
take it all in, but others had seen the changes.� Neela resembled a pet kitty cat, but she was
developing into a strong feline.� Dr.
Walks had given Neela fangs and claws intending to keep her in the med-center,
and not putting her up for sale.

���� When the influential
Bartholomew Quintal expressed an interest in buying the new kitty she was made
available.� Compared to other catgirls
her price was triple, to cover the extra costs involved in producing a more
feline animal.� Dr. Walks set the price
very high to try to discourage the purchase, but Quintal didn�t flinch when she
told him.

���� Dr. Walks and Nurse Reynolds
both voiced their doubts about the wisdom of letting Neela out.� Keeping her in the medical center allowed
expert supervision and careful attention to security.� Dr. Walks� pet catgirls at 98% human and 2%
feline genealogy were basically cosmetic, but Neela had only 90% human and 10%
feline genes.� Her potential for feline
behavior was greatly enhanced.� She was
becoming less civilized and more feline daily.�


���� One day Nurse Reynolds saw
Neela catch a Para-rat, a large brown furred squirrel-like rodent, as it ate an
apple core.� Neela lay on her log without
moving a muscle, her eyes riveted to the Para-rat.� Each time it looked down to take a bite she
crept an inch closer.� She was within 5
feet of the 10-pound animal when it finished the last bite of the apple
core.� She carefully gathered her legs
for the final burst.� The Para-rat looked
directly at the frozen catgirl without seeing her, and then turned away.

���� Neela moved like lightning,
instantly, before it took a single step she was on it, her claws impaled the
unfortunate rodent and her sharp fangs ripped its throat out in a bloody
spray.� 

���� Nurse Reynolds tried to get
the dead Para-rat away from her, but she hissed and wouldn�t let go until she
had eaten several large bites.� Suddenly
she stopped and looked around and then she shivered as she looked at her
handiwork, she dropped it on the ground and walked slowly inside.� Neela looked at her bloody hands as she went
in the door and went directly into her kennel.�
Nurse Reynolds had closed the kennel door earlier when the janitorial
crew came in to sweep and mop so it was out of the way.� Neela opened it and went inside to huddle in
the very end.� 

���� After she went out and got rid
of the remains of the dead Para-rat, Nurse Reynolds came in to get the blood
washed from Neela.

���� �Come on out sweetheart,� she
said gently.� �Let�s get you washed up
for dinner.�� Neela looked up at her and
smiled, her bloody lips and fangs ominous.�
Nurse Reynolds was chilled to her core; she almost closed the door and
ran away.� She knew that Neela could open
the kennel door now, and move fast, very, very fast.

���� She convinced Neela to come
out and get washed in the large utility sink.�
She ran hot water to half fill the smooth plastic bowl and opened the
door for Neela to come out to get washed.�
Neela smiled innocently and slipped out gracefully. 

���� �Do you need to go to your
litter-box, sweetheart?� she asked before she got Neela into the sink of hot
water.� Neela shook her head no with
small short motions.� I notice you
haven�t used the litter in over a week now,� she observed.� Neela nodded slowly as she stepped into her
hot bath, she preferred to dig a small hole outside and bury her feces and
urine.� Nurse Reynolds washed the blood
from Neela�s face and chin first.� Blood
had run down the front of her throat and even dripped from her pink nipples.

&nbsp;

���� �I just have one more question
Dr. Walks,� Darlene Quintal said, sounding very authoritative.� Dr. Walks turned to her.

�� ���Can she breed?� I mean would she have human babies?� she
sounded more curious than lascivious.� 

���� �No, she�s a hybrid,� Dr.
Walks answered.� �She�s sterile.� Even if there were male or tomcat
boys,,er,,men, you couldn�t raise litters.�
If that�s what you meant.�

���� �I was more just curious.� Wondering in case she got tangled,,,or well,
met up with a male of some sort,� Darlene stumbled.� �Will she go into heat or whatever the
medical term for it is?�

���� �The medical term is estrus,
and I don�t really know for sure.� We�ve
had her here for over 6 months since the surgery and the other treatments, and
she�s never exhibited estrus,� Dr. Walks answered.� �She has become more catlike,,,,positively
feline, lately so I�m not sure about that anymore.�

�� ���Thank you doctor,� Mr. Quintal said
condescendingly.� �We�ll keep an eye out
for that possibility.�

���� �I want you to know that she
isn�t a sweet pussycat,� Dr. Walks warned.�
�Neela can be vicious without any reservations.�� She refrained from telling about the shredded
Para-rat.

&nbsp;

Bartholomew
Quintal�s Kingdom 

&nbsp;

���� Neela sat on the floor in
Darlene�s luxurious bedroom, her legs were stretched out in front as she sat
with her legs splayed.� The floor was
covered with the deepest pile carpeting she had ever seen.� The bedroom was huge, Neela�s entire house
from Earth could have fit inside that one room.�
Darlene�s bedroom had a bathroom and huge closet at one end and study space
with her computer station, and lounge chairs at the other end.� It was all finished in various shades of pink
and purple.� The carpet was dark mauve
and the furniture was covered in pale pink furred material.� Even the walls were pink, covered with gold
accented brocade wallpaper.� 

���� Neela found the large chair
immediately and curled up on the seat.�
Darlene made her get out and stay on the floor.

���� �You�re not allowed on any of
the furniture, Neela,� she shook her finger as she spoke.� �Daddy will be mad at both of us if he finds
you in any of the chairs,� the she looked around conspiratorially.� �But you can get up on my bed.� 

&nbsp;

���� Darlene had a black leather
collar for her; she carefully buckled it around Neela�s neck.� The collar was an inch and a half wide and
decorated with gold and platinum rivets.�
Neela watched as Darlene buckled it in place, she could remove it at any
time.

���� Even with millions of dollars
to live on, Darlene wore an old blue men�s sleeveless t-shirt for a nighty. It
was at least 2 sizes too large and she had shortened it to just cover her bottom.� 

���� Darlene sat on the side of her
bed, finishing her reading before turning in when Neela came out of
hiding.� Neela crept carefully onto
Darlene�s huge bed and approached silently.�
She crept up to Darlene to cautiously lay her head on Darlene�s bare
thigh.� When she was close she gently
laid her head on Darlene�s naked thigh, for her to pet.� Darlene was surprised until now Neela had
been very aloof and only climbed up onto the bed after Darlene was asleep.

���� She began to stroke Neela�s
head and the soft fur on her back.� Neela
stirred and turned over, Darlene continued to absently caress Neela�s chest and
belly; she fondled one of Neela�s firm little breasts and rubbed her nipple.� The effect was surprising to both Neela and
Darlene she began to purr.� Neither she
nor Darlene knew she could purr, none of the other catgirls produced by Dr.
Walks purred.

���� Neela also began to moan
softly, Darlene put down her book and stroked both of Neela�s hard pink
nipples.� She gently slid her hand over
Neela�s firm belly to push her finger carefully between Neela�s engorged pussy
lips.� Neela began to squirm and shift
around as Darlene�s attentions became more insistent.� Neela was a virgin when kidnapped and had
never had a partner male or female, the feelings and sensations were new and a
bit fearsome to her.

���� Darlene was experienced with
men and women, she continued to fondle Neela�s pussy and firm breast.� Then she slowly inserted her index finger
into Neela�s tiny vagina, until her entire finger was inside the hot
cavity.� Darlene was surprised at the
volume of Neela�s secretion.� She
alternately pressed and relaxed her hand and index finger, while Neela became
more aroused.� Neela pulled her knees up
almost to her chest and spread her thighs as much as she could, to give Darlene
the best access.� 

���� Neela�s orgasm was the first
she had experienced since she was brought here and the first she had
experienced with another person.� It was
almost a cataclysmic event.� She panted
and couldn�t stop and then she couldn�t catch her breath.� She also purred loudly. I didn�t know I
could do that.

���� �Wow Neela.� I didn�t know you could purr,� exclaimed
Darlene.� �Did you know?�� Darlene didn�t expect and answer.� She was surprised when Neela shook her head.� 

���� �Do you understand me?�� Neela nodded and smiled.

�

Ahead in part 2: Neela becomes more that just
Darlene�s pet kitty.
