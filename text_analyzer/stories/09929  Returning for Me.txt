Synopsis:   A young Victorian lady is surprised by the man she thought she would never see again - the man who owns her.






I was engaging in some combination of reading, pacing restlessly, and thinking about seeing Sarah when I heard the knock at the door. �I had forgotten for the moment that the only one of the servants that my father hadn't told to stay home was Lindsey, and only the second, seemingly angry, knock pulled me out of my reverie. �I rubbed the bridge of my nose to ease the tightness behind my eyes as I exited the parlor, thinking whomever it was would certainly have been far more angry if I had yet gotten into the bath I had just been contemplating.

I didn't realize I still had the book in my hand until it hit the marble tile of the foyer as I opened the door and saw him. �I backed away, from surprise or fear or something else I could't name, and he picked up the book as he entered. �His other hand reached for my own, and as if there had been nothing between us but the polite and distant relationship of�acquaintances, he kissed my fingertips lightly. �

"Miss Vanders," he intoned politely, releasing my stunned hand and setting his hat on the rack by the door, "it's been so long. �Is your father at home?"

The sound of my voice surprised me with its steadiness and casual tone, "My father is in Paris, as I would have thought you knew well. �I was under the impression you were still in business together."

"Of course, of course," he said, lightly. �He had removed his gloves and shut the door while I failed to notice, the former placed familiarly on the table and the latter now chained and bolted again. �"Rather cold here, don't you think? �I suppose you have a fire in the parlor?" �He was already guiding my gently by the arm. �He was touching me. �

I looked sideways and up at him. �There were the dark eyes and strong features that had haunted my dreams for so long, the once-broken aquiline nose, the lips that I couldn't help but think of in a cruel smile. �Tiny hints of silver appeared in the chestnut hair at his temples, new since I had seen him six years ago.

"And here you are answering the door. �What an unexpected pleasure, Miss Vanders. �Isn't that a job for the servants?" �

I nearly explained where everyone was, mostly sent home while my father and stepmother were out of the country except for the cook who came in to make my dinner and clean up, and the housekeeper in once a week, and Lindsey in for a bit today to help me ready for the New Year's Eve ball. �She was out fetching my dress from the seamstress. �And all that came out of my mouth was "They're all out right now." �

For a split second I saw that cruel smile that I was expecting, and then he advanced upon me, slamming me against a bookcase with one arm as the other hand closed on my throat as his lips did upon mine. �I shuddered and tried to gasp, and my lips responded. �His teeth grasped my lower lip and bit as he allowed me to breathe, and as his other arm clasped my waist I felt the one that had choked me slap hard across my face. �I responded, in both surrender and hunger, as I felt his cock harden where he pressed into my body and his lips find mine again. �Sudden shame took me as I remembered Sarah, and I tried to push him away even as I ached for the way he used to use me. �

"Please Charles, I ca-" I ended in a muffled cry as his palm found my cheekbone again as he pulled my hair painfully with his other hand. �I sobbed with how much I wanted more, as he whispered in my ear. "Yes, I like to hear you say please. �And don't you ever. say. 'can't'. to me." �The next blow's solid sound was accompanied by my ragged gasping breath. �Then the hand in my hair was pulling down harder, forcing me to my knees as he unbuttoned his trousers. �I tried again to push him away, and maybe I opened my mouth to protest a second time as he shoved his cock into my mouth. �The sound that came out was a moan, and he thrust into my mouth, banging against my throat, and then I felt my teeth scrape lightly against his shaft. �I didn't have time to flinch before he had pulled out of my mouth long enough to slap me again, and then his hand grasped my jaw, forcing my mouth wider, as the one in my hair guided me in the speed and stroke that he wanted. �I covered my lower teeth with my tongue and curled my lips to shield him from the top. �As I began to suck and caress his shaft with my tongue, his hands gentled, the touch on my jaw becoming a caress, the fingers in my hair a promise. �

"Look at you. �Such a good little whore," I heard him say. �His words sent a shiver down my spine, and I tried to take more of him in. �I contained my choking as I finally remembered the trick of relaxing my throat, and I don't know if I would call his response a laugh or a moan, but it was something of both. �I eased him gently in and out of my throat, caressing with my lips and tongue, and then his hands tightened again, and he shoved his cock deep into my throat once more, taking shallow and savage thrusts. �I held my breath as he fucked my mouth, but soon I desperately needed to draw breath. �I tried to pull my head back, tried to push myself away against his thighs, but his thrusting continued. �Blind animal panic set in as I was unable to breathe, and my pale fists pounded the hard muscle of thighs and the expensive wool that covered them. �It was certainly a laugh that I heard - yet barely registered - as my airway was finally open again and he let me breathe, gasping and coughing and nearly slumping to the floor. �

The coughing was brief, though I was still breathing raggedly when I heard him say "back up on your knees", which I promptly obeyed, and then as he stroked my hair "open", which I did gladly, welcoming back into my mouth the cock on which I had just choked. �"Now suck it the way I like it", and I did. �I loved the feel of him in my mouth, his lightly guttural breathing when I slid his cock all the way down my throat, the cramping that began in my jaw as I pleasured him, the promise of more violent restriction of my breathing if I didn't please him. �I was wet, and ashamed, and the only thing I wanted more than to keep his cock in my mouth forever was to feel it in my cunt.� 

His voice was the purr of a predator as he told me I was a good girl, a good whore.� Had I been practicing, sucking other cocks?� My mouth was his, of course, he said.� I had, of course, quite a few, but that was over.� But, of course, he didn't intend me to answer.� He intended me to please him until he told me to stop.� And it did seem like quite a long time.� Finally he pulled my hungry lips and aching jaw off of him, and all thoughts were gone but the urgency I knew would soon be fulfilled as he threw me to my feet and against the wall, or to the ground on my back or stomach, or over the chairback... I made an uncomprehending moan as he started to button again, although his engorged cock would never fit away again.� "Why, my dear," he said, his tone the perfect confused gentleman, "are you alright?� Oh, have I forgotten something you wanted?" Some amount of thought, and shame or panic, was resurfacing as he pulled me to my feet.� He took my hair- gently this time, so gently, and caressed the cheek that had not yet known his palm.� I swore his touch was like burning, and I realized how hard I was crying.� "Oh yes, I can't give you one side and not the other, can I?"� His hand pulled back, and I saw stars when it landed again.� His hand was there, propping me up, and then he was straightening himself again, finishing his buttons although he was half hard.

"Sophie, pet, could you fetch me some tea?� I'm quite chill.� Your cheeks seem a bit flushed though.� I hope I didn't catch you at a bad time." He smiled the demon smile of my dreams and desires, and I nodded numbly as I teetered to the kitchen an shaky legs.� "And dear?" - I paused as I left the warm room for the halway - "Don't touch yourself.� I expect you back promptly."

I must have put on the kettle, and steeped the tea, and brought it back. �I couldn't exactly remember. �I remember pouring him tea, and then myself, and that he was smiling at me perfectly companionably with a hand resting affectionately on my knee when we heard the front door again. �He moved to a more proper distance of another chair by the time Lindsey stuck her head in, but it didn't really matter since she didn't care for the drama of overwrought propriety. �"Why hello Mr. Cross! �Oh, terribly sorry you had to make the tea, miss. �Should I draw your bath? �Will you be changing as planned? �Of course Mr. Cross, good to see you, sorry you didn't hear Mr. Vanders was out of town. �Are you alright, miss? �You look a big pale..."

Lindsey continued her clucking and he rose and kissed my hand politely as he excused myself. �"Yes, of course, Miss Vanders, I will see you at the ball this evening. �It seems like such a long time since we have danced." �Then he was gone. �And I was thinking of Sarah. �Sarah was the one I wanted to kiss. �I loved her. �Today was madness. �Maybe it was an hysterical fantasy, brought on by seeing him at the door. �But the feeling of my cheek and throat knew that it wasn't. �

Hysterical fantasies - well, memories - came on as I was bathing. �The water was as hot and all the same as after I cleaned up that first time he took me.









I was 15, and beautiful (I remembered, soaking in my hot bath).  And as far as I was concerned, the only thing more beautiful than I was was my father's business partner, who was just barely beating me at a game of chess.  I was very, very good.  And he was very, very beautiful.  

Charles Cross was sitting across the chess board from me, and I was smiling as I was finally beating him.  And I was hoping he noticed I was growing up.  Two moves to checkmate.  Then one move.  And then - HE politely announced "checkmate" to me, and followed up with "I'm afraid you're mine again."  The words made me girlishly thrilled.  

"I wouldn't really mind being yours," I said.  Perhaps I was a bit awkward, but it seemed to me that surely I was irresistible.  He stood, and I remained seated as he walked over.  He touched me gently, running his hand from the silk flower in my hair, down the dark curl to where it touched my cheek.  He smiled at me, a sort of smile I had never seen on him, although I had seen him smile many smiles.

"Wouldn't you though, pet?" he asked, "Because I certainly have planned on making you mine."

My heart was beating at ten times its normal speed, I was certain, as he caressed that chestnut curl, and his fingers barely touched my face.  "Ah, sweet Sophie.  I can't wait any longer to make you mine."  My lips parted in anticipation, and he kissed me, gently sucking and biting my bottom lip, then drifting to my earlobe and biting there, harder.  His whisper came to me "Are you mine now?"  When I only nodded, he stopped, and pulled back.  His grip on my hair became harder.  "No, pet, you must say the words, not just nod." 

"I am yours."  Then he smiled, as he said "Good", and I cried out in surprise as he pushed the set off of the table, grabbed my hair in earnest, and threw me face down over the table.  One knight had managed to stay on the table, and its hard ivory lance dug into my cheek.  "Tell me you are mine again," he said, and I did.  One hand held me down by the neck, as he pulled my dress up to my waist with the other.  "Lovely stockings, pet.  I like lovely stockings.  I am going to hurt you now, and later I will let you thank me.  Is that what you want?  No no, no nodding.  Remember to say the words."

"That is what I want," and it certainly was, although I didn't know what I wanted except that my cunt was throbbing (had I thought it was a cunt then?  I couldn't remember, but I couldn't think of it as anything else now, where I touched it under the hot water of my bath) and I wanted him to never stop looking at me.  With my garters unhooked and knickers at my ankles, he was grabbing each side of my ass, hard, and kicking my legs further apart as my stockings sagged, showing more of my legs.  "Be very very still, pet.  I'm going to stop touching you, and if you move, I won't come back."  I was so very still.  I whined when his hands left my neck and ass.  I heard him rummaging for a bit, my muscles twitching with the impatience of wanting to look for him, the confusion of what was going on.  I knew I should stop.  This was madness.  No one would believe me, but I should run.  I should - I cried out as something hard hit my ass.  I started to spring up, moving my arms, but then his strong hand was on my neck again, and he was whispering softly.  "Sophie my dear, I will stop right now if you tell me to, and I will never kiss you again.  But if you're to be mine, I will make you mine, and you will love being mine."  I started to cry, trying to push away, push up from the table and turn over and run, but he held me down, now with both hands and now pressed against my spread legs.  I could feel his hard cock pressing into me.  "No no pet, you have to answer me.  If you are mine, I'll hurt you as long as you want, and then I'll fuck you, and you'll be a dirty little whore who can never be a good wife, won't you?  No nodding or shaking your head, love.  Stop struggling."  And I stopped, and I tried to control my sobbing, and then I relaxed, and said "I'm yours."  

"Oh good," he said, moving the hand on my neck to grasp my hair painfully, and the other to his fly.  "But I changed my mind.  I'll hurt you while I fuck you, because the smell of that little cunt won't let me wait any longer."  

I moaned and cried as he yanked my hair back, and as he pushed his cock between my legs.  It wouldn't go in, of course, though I started to feel my wetness dripping down my leg.  His other hand alternatively slapped my face, slapped my ass, probed my virgin hole, and helped work his cock into fucking me.  I was crying hard, and I couldn't tell anymore whether I was struggling to be fucked, or struggling to get away, or merely struggling from the pain.  The pleasure overwhelmed me as his thick head finally entered me.  I've heard others say it was painful, but maybe I was already in too much pain to notice.  He said something, then took his other hand away, and let go of my hair as he used both hands to push my waist into the table and leverage himself.  After what seemed an eternity of shallow working, which I thought must be the height of pleasure any woman could feel, he leaned forward and pushed his cock all the way into me.  Then I felt pain, and pleasure, and I wriggled and came on his cock.  (I had come before.  I had discovered long before the pleasure of wrapping my legs tightly around each other, and then later that it was better to use my hands, but it was nothing next to coming as he fucked me.)  I didn't want him to stop, but he leaned forward again, and told me in my ear.  "Now you no longer have a little piece of chattel there between your legs.  You have a fuckhole, and it is MY fuckhole."  And he used his fuckhole roughly, and he hurt me as he did it.  He used my hair to pull me on and off of him, and he leaned all of his weight into my waist as he thrust.  He gave me orders, telling me to stand on my toes so that he could spank my ass as he used me, telling me to bring my legs up.  I whimpered as he withdrew to spread my legs wider and slap each of my inner thighs until he told me they were a lovely pink, lovely enough to be fuckable, and he entered me again and continued using his fuckhole.  I might have come again - it was hard to tell from the pleasure mixed with pain.  He ordered me on many things to say - that I was his, that I liked being his fuckhole, that this tight cunt belonged to him.  And he used his fuckhole roughly, until he came.

I was sobbing as he sagged, and although I was wetter than I had ever been, and stretched as I had never been, I felt his cum shooting into me.  He held there for a time - I am not sure how long - and asked me if I liked being his.  "I love being yours," I answered, and felt a swelling perfection of emotion as he said, "Ah, you are going to be *such* a good girl, my pet."

I felt his juices along with mine run down my leg as his half-soft cock came out of me.  "Now, let me teach you something else, darling," he said.  I nodded eagerly.  "Get down on your knees, and come here.  You will clean my cock with your mouth.  Yes dear, lick it clean.  All of it.  Now take the whole thing in your mouth.  There's a good pet, use your tongue still.  That mouth will also be my fuckhole, you know, but I'll not claim it now."  His cum tasted odd, mine delicious.  I couldn't really tell them apart at the time.  "Such a good doll you are, and all mine.  Tell me you're mine again, love.  I can't have you forget after this."

"I am yours," I said, to his nodding approval as he lifted me to my feet.  I was shaking all over.  He leaned me over the table again and pushed up my skirts.  

"Point your toes Sophie, so I can pull up your stocking.  And you seem to have lost a shoe."  He arranged all of my undergarments.  I could still feel his cum running down my leg, running out of my cunt, his mark on me.  "Quiet there, lass.  I'll fix you up right now.  You are mine, and I will care for you."  He pulled me towards the settee, and held me around the waist as I sobbed, then as I started to rat at my hair, his large hands held my wrists firmly and put them back into my lap.  "Keep your hands there, dear.  Here, hold your flower."  He handed the forgotten silk adornment to me.  A comb came from his jacket pocket, and he rather deftly removed the ratting that had come of his ill treatment of my hair.  At one point his grip tightened again, only for a moment.  I gasped and kicked my feet, and he laughed - half cruel, half affectionate, that laugh I came to crave so often - and let go the tension as he brought his teeth to my flushed white neck.  He bit just enough to make me squeal, then pulled back.  "Ah, dear, I shall bite you until you beg for more and beg me to stop all at once, but it mustn't be today.  You must get home, mustn't you?"  His hands in my hair, his cum marking my thighs, I made sure to speak, "Yes I must, if you'll have it."

"Well, pet, I'm afraid I can't restore those curls.  But no one shall remember them, shall they, anyway?"  He took the flower again from my hands and pinned it into the series of uncurled loops that was my new coiffure, surprisingly deft from my view into a mirror across the room.  "Now I'm sure you can walk again.  Now pick those chess pieces up that you've made such a mess of, and best get home before someone starts to worry."  His voice was cold, his eyes mocking.  I replaced the pieces, aware of his eyes on me.  His cold manner continued as he walked me toward the door, but his eyes softened as he said, "Tell me what I want to hear."  

"I am yours," I said, and he smiled, and his kiss was gentle but hungry as he tilted my chin up to meet his lips.

The rain started pouring as I walked home - no one would have ever noticed my lack of stray curls any longer.  Mary hustled me up the stairs and into a hot bath.  I sunk in in my underthings, hoping then that she wouldn't notice the scents of sex on them when they went to the laundry.  I felt somehow that I was losing something as I washed his mark, his cum, off of my legs and privates.  Then I touched myself again, remembering his touches, his cock, and his pain.

Just as I was doing now - I cried gently, remembering, feeling, wanting - as my climax washed away what the hot water could not.
