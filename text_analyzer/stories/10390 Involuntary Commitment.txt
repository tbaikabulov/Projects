Involuntary Commitment
Provided By: BDSM Librarywww.bdsmlibrary.com
Synopsis:  A husband arranges for his socialite wife to be held involuntarily at a mental hospital and declared incompetent, so that he can receive a two million dollar inheritance.






One obstacle stood between Harford Jones and the acquisition of a two million dollar inheritance, that being his wife Lydia.

Harford, a fifty year old divorcee of only modest financial means, had married Lydia, ten years younger, specifically because she was from a wealthy socialite family and stood to acquire the inheritance from a wealthy aunt, upon turning forty.

The marriage had chilled since shortly after its inception. While Lydia had no propensity for adultery, she was an alcoholic, who squandered away much of the existing financial assets, which she had acquired before marriage. Most of her expenditures, such as charity, were considered dubious by her husband.

Harford was a mid level executive at the local financial exchange and was able to carry on an extramarital relationship with a female co-worker, without Lydia&#8217;s knowledge.

With Lydia&#8217;s fortieth birthday fast approaching, Harford feared that she would divorce him, or at the least deny him access to the inheritance. He was an inveterate gambler, who occasionally found it necessary to borrow from less than scrupulous lenders.

Under provincial law, if a wife were found legally incompetent due to mental illness, the husband would be entitled to any inheritance. One of Harlow&#8217;s fellow gamblers was Doctor Jack Shade, a psychiatrist, with connections to a private mental hospital, about one hundred kilometers from the city.

Doctor Shade was willing to sign papers involuntarily committing Lydia to the hospital for an indefinite duration, for which he would of course receive a lucrative fee. Some of the inheritance would have to be used to pay the hospital bills, but Harford was confident he could safely squander a good portion of it.

At 2:00 on a Saturday afternoon, an unmarked ambulance pulled into the driveway of Lydia&#8217;s estate, followed by a Porsche. Doctor Shade was in the Porsche, while two hospital employees, one male and one female, were in the ambulance.

The male was a thirty year old, six foot four, towhead type, who bore a resemblance to Herman Munster, while the female was a sixty year old, six foot, two hundred pound Amazon type. Both hospital employees were attired in the standard two piece, white institutional uniforms.

Lydia was surprised, to say the least, when the trio entered the house. Without any hesitation Harford broke the news of the involuntary commitment, justifying it on the grounds that she needed alcoholism treatment. Lydia, who was sober at the moment, immediately voiced her objection.

Doctor Shade opined that treatment at the hospital had proved effective in many similar cases of alcoholism. He assured her that she could have visitors, and that the treatment would be of �short duration�, without offering any specific time frame.

She immediately demanded to call her lawyer, however the male attendant assured her that she could make the call upon arrival at the hospital. This of course wasn&#8217;t true, but it appeased Lydia for the time being.

Before she could physically resist, the two hospital employees put her in the standard hospital restraints, this being a leather belt, with a leather wrist cuff on each side of the belt. With practiced precision the restraints were quickly and efficiently applied.

As it appeared Lydia might resist, the female nurse in a most intimidating tone, informed her that she would immediately be injected with sedatives, should it be necessary. Lydia was then led by the two employees to the waiting ambulance and placed in the rear. This was not before she had the opportunity to shout curses at Harlow and the doctor.

Once inside the ambulance she was ordered to lie on her back on a stretcher. Leather restraints were used to attach her ankles to the sides, while two other leather belts were used to encircle her, one just above the knees, and the other just below the chest.

For the trip to the hospital, the male would drive, while the female would remain in the rear with the unwilling patient. Lydia, never one for modish styles, was attired in a gray knee length skirt and loose fitting pull over navy blue sweater.

�My name is Mary and I will be your primary nurse once you&#8217;re admitted to the hospital, but right now I have to search you�, she announced. 

Lydia immediately voiced her objection, but again with practiced precision, Mary conducted a search that would be the envy of any TSA worker. It included feeling Lydia&#8217;s groin area and removal of her bra, for inspection of any contraband that might be hidden within.

The search found no contraband, but prompted Mary to react to what she considered Lydia&#8217;s insolent attitude. This was to strap a ball gag into place. Lydia, who possessed scant knowledge of bondage, fought to expel the rubber intruder, but it was wedged tightly into place.

�You will be required to accept staff discipline and if necessary we will keep you in restraints and solitary confinement indefinitely�, the nurse sternly stated. The gag proved to very effective at preventing any intelligible speech by Lydia, with Mary assuring her that drooling was normal under the circumstances.

 Mary again threatened to inject her with sedatives during transport if she became agitated. The ambulance was equipped with a satellite radio system, which Mary tuned to the 60s channel, primarily for her own enjoyment, but also hoping it would have a calming effect upon the unwilling agitated patient.

None of these measures succeeded in calming the patient, and after about a half hour drive, Lydia was injected with a moderate dose of a tranquilizer. It would make her more manageable when she was brought before the superintendent upon arrival at the hospital.

It had been raining for nearly a half hour, when the ambulance entered the grounds of Los Bravos Hospital. A guardhouse stood at the entrance.&nbsp; Built in the late 1800s, it was surrounded by a barbed wire fence, with only the absence of concertina wire distinguishing it from a prison. The patient rooms did not have window bars, but were of such design that they could not be opened or shattered.

The restraints were removed and the groggy patient was escorted to the office of Doctor Graves, a psychiatrist and hospital superintendent. The doctor was not a conversationalist and simply informed Lydia she was being held involuntarily pending evaluation.

Lydia requested to contact her attorney. This was denied and she was told that it would be permitted in the near future, conditioned upon good behavior. Nurse Mary assured her that Harford had already done so, knowing full well that he hadn&#8217;t.

New arrivals are provided the amenity of a single room, minus any other amenities, such as television, telephone or the Internet.&nbsp; She was ordered to change into the standard hospital gown. The room door had a one way mirror, permitting persons outside to look in, but those inside could not look out.

Back at the estate the naked hooker was concerned. She was naked, and tied spread eagled, to the bed previously occupied by Harford and Lydia. A ball gag was nearby but not needed at the moment, as she was expected to provide oral sex.

Dr. Shade had recruited her to provide sex to Harford and himself, but hadn&#8217;t mentioned bondage. The hooker, sent from an escort agency, simply didn&#8217;t do bondage, but her protests had been ignored.

Harford had always been somewhat of a ladies man but was more oriented towards conventional sex. Dr. Shade had made a career seducing certain female patients of his into bondage. With the absence of Lydia, he and Harford planned to invite females to the estate regularly, for various sexual activities.

The current hooker would be required to provide oral sex to both Harford and the doctor, the later planned to introduce her to the flogger, for his pleasure, as well as to introduce Harford to the basics of BDSM.


Lydia&#8217;s first night at Los Bravos was indeed a stressful one, made bearable only by additional sedation. Continuous monitoring was done by CCTV to prevent any suicide attempt.

 She received her first visit from the Charge Nurse, a most mean spirited person known simply as Nurse Ratchet. Ratchet bluntly stated she was in charge at the institute, and to incur her ill will would result in permanent misery for a patient.

Ratchet, in the manner of a marm outlined a broad treatment program for Lydia, while offering few specifics. One aspect that she was not specific about was the duration of the hospital stay. Lydia&#8217;s mental faculties were severely impaired from the sedation, and she retained little of the information Ratchet provided.

In the morning Lydia was provided with the standard patient uniform, this being jeans a gray sweat shirt, and athletic shoes. She was shown her new room, which was semi private, but for the time being she would be the only occupant Breakfast was served to her in the room, as it was too early to introduce her to the rest of the patient population.

About an hour later she was taken to the office of Dr. Chan, a staff psychiatrist of Korean descent, for her formal admission evaluation. She pleaded with the doctor that she was in control of her drinking, but it fell on deaf ears.

Lydia would be required to work for six hours a day in the kitchen, mainly in a cleaning capacity. It was hot, dirty and strenuous work, and was always delegated to the newest patient.

 In addition she would attend two hours a day of therapy, which was individual as opposed to group, for the time being she would not be permitted to interact with any of the other patients.

At the estate, a three hour session served to introduce the twenty five year old hooker to the world of bondage. Bound securely to the bed on her stomach, Dr. Shade engaged in his favorite fetish, which was to alternately flog and force the sub to perform oral sex upon him.

Despite the fact that she was being generously compensated, the much sought after call girl escort, vowed never to again have dealings with Dr. Shade, or anyone at the estate. Harford was miffed as the doctor dominated the sub, leaving him little opportunity to cunt fuck the attractive harlot. He was determined that for the next session, two hookers would be invited.

By the end of the first session, Harford had observed plenty of bondage action, but participated in none. He did manage to cunt fuck the bitch, but by that time she was worn down from the repetitive flogging and oral sex forced upon her by Shade.


By the end of her first week at Los Bravos, Lydia still refused to accept the enslavement forced upon her by Harford. She rebelled against performing the kitchen work and refused to participate in any therapy.

This did not set well with either Nurse Mary, who had been specifically assigned as Lydia&#8217;s therapist. As punishment Lydia was ordered to stand in Mary&#8217;s office for three consecutive hours, attached with wrist cuffs to an overhead hook. The remainder of the time she was confined to her room.

Lydia had still not been introduced to the general population. What little she had seen of them did not favorably impress her, they were from inferior social groups, and not worthy of her companionship.

Despite Lydia&#8217;s punitive restrictions, she was not to be denied sex. Part of her daily regimen was a one hour session with Dr. Chan, who while not fluent in English, had a visceral sex drive. He was accustomed to taking sexual liberties with female patients, providing hormonal therapy to his favorites. Lydia would be no exception.

In three consecutive sessions with Dr. Chan, she was required to service him twice orally on her knees, the third was a cunt fuck, on the expensive couch he maintained in his office. Lydia found the coerced sex distasteful, but felt powerless to resist.

All of this did not set well with Nurse Mary, who had sexual appetites of her own, and often found herself competing for lesbian sex with Nurse Ratchet. However Ratchet made it clear there was to be no sex with Lydia for the time being, however she had no control over Chan.

Dr. Shade&#8217;s next guest at Harford&#8217;s mansion was one of his female patients, whom was controlled by the threat of the withholding of prescription drugs. Sara, 36, was a busty blond and natural submissive.

Harford was irked that only Sara accompanied the doctor in his Porsche, earlier he had been assured that two females would be provided. Sara soon found herself naked and hogtied on Harford&#8217;s bed, and it quickly became apparent that Shade did not intend to share her.

Sensing Harford&#8217;s anger, Shade made a call to an escort service and requested a female with whom he was familiar, one who was not into bondage. He first requested the twenty three year old hooker from the first session but she refused the assignment.

Leaving his patient hogtied after fucking her, Shade and Harford retired to the living room for a mixed drink, while awaiting the arrival of the second hooker. Lois, a 20ish, 5&#8217;10�, brunette, introduced herself to both men, before going in separate directions.

 Shade headed back to the bedroom where Sara had been left hogtied, while Harford and Lois headed for a second bedroom.

Both Ratchet and Mary were becoming increasingly antagonized over Lydia&#8217;s lack of progress, and the fact she seemed to look forward to her sessions with Dr. Chan. Ratchet contacted Dr. Graves, the superintendent, with her concerns and the sessions with Chan were stopped.

Lydia would still be kept in solitary confinement, but would not be required to stand in handcuffs for three hour periods. Instead of daily therapy sessions with Dr. Chan, they would be held by Nurse Ratchet in her office, without the presence of Mary.

Ratchet was a firm believer in nude therapy for the patient. Lydia was reluctant to strip upon Rachet&#8217;s command, but a threat to handcuff and forcibly strip her, induced compliance. Sitting next to Lydia on the couch, Ratchet gently fondled Lydia&#8217;s breasts, exclaiming �You see how enjoyable it is�, in a low tone.

Abruptly Ratchet twisted Lydia&#8217;s left nipple, causing a shriek of pain. �Or it can be painful, the choice is yours�, she snapped in a harsh tone. Lydia knew better than to resist and passively submitted to Ratchet&#8217;s deep mouth kissing.

Next on the therapy was a twelve inch dildo, a device Lydia had little use for in her sex life. Lubricated, the intruder was fully buried in her cunt, with a cord enabling it to be readily removed. The cord was attached to a vibrator control, which was immediately turned on at full speed, then abruptly stopped.

To further humiliate Lydia, she was required to mimic the words to the song �Good Vibrations�. Ratchet adjusted the speed to suit her whims, and Lydia was unable to avoid climax. This brought an evil look of delight to Ratchet&#8217;s face.

Harford found Lois to be an unsatisfying sex partner, hardly worth the five hundred dollars Shade had paid. Shade seemed intent upon running up a bill for sexual services, with the expectation that Harford would pay him back. No such explicit agreement existed and Harford was confident he could disregard his expectations without fear.

Sara would spend most of the session hogtied. Shade obtained his gratification primarily by flogging her exposed cunt with a cat of nine flogger. This was interrupted only for a blow job, after which Shade decided another break was in order.

Upon learning of Harford&#8217;s dissatisfaction with Lois, Shade suggested she be put in bondage along with Sara. Harford, ever cautious, rejected the idea. Sara was Shade&#8217;s patient and a free agent, but Harford feared the escort service might not appreciate a second hooker forced into bondage. 

Tiring of sex, Harford and Lois lie naked in the bed downing some mixed drinks, while Shade returned to play with Sara.

The merriment ended with the phone ringing. Half inebriated, Harford answered and the caller was a Mr. Tillingham, a local attorney. He stated he had been retained by Lydia to represent her in the inheritance matter. Taken by surprise, Harford informed him that Lydia was out of town for the weekend, and that she had decided to proceed without legal representation.



Harford was greatly concerned, with his fear being that some employee at the Los Bravos might tip off the attorney. Since the attorney stood to himself profit from the inheritance, the issue was clearly of concern. 

If an independent psychiatrist, not of Shade&#8217;s choosing, were appointed to examine Lydia, she likely would not be committed, both Harford and Doctor Shade would be facing criminal charges, and the hospital itself would be liable for assault and false imprisonment.

Harford promptly discussed the matter with Shade. It was decided that Shade would utilize his organized crime connections to force Tillingham off the case. It was a gamble, with the fee the attorney would receive from the inheritance, he might well go to the police.

The message was delivered to Tillingham. It stated that Lydia had retained the services of a new attorney, one with mob connections. Actually Harford had no desire to utilize an attorney for the inheritance matter. He was confident that the complexity of the matter was such, that he could handle it himself.

Even with Tillingham off the case, Lydia&#8217;s presence at the hospital might still be discovered. Shade was confident that the diagnosis would stand. Most likely an independent psychiatrist would be appointed to examine her, and that doctor could be bought off.

The hospital was alerted as to the situation. It was decided to continue to keep Lydia in solitary, with the only human contact allowed being Nurses Mary and Ratchet for therapy. Lydia would be heavily sedated most of the time.

Despite the sedation Lydia was becoming an increasing problematic patient, such that it was necessary to keep her in a strait jacket much of the time, with an attached butt plug. This was purely punitive, as Lydia was not a suicide risk.

Fortunately for Lydia, the hospital had a policy against corporal punishments, such as floggings. Forced sex was against policy as well, but was easily circumvented. When Lydia refused to provide oral sex voluntarily, Nurse Ratchet strapped her down to the bed and face sat her.

The date for the formal examination was expedited and would be held in seven days. Dr. Chung would officially certify that Lydia was incompetent to function outside the institution, and the inheritance would be paid to Harford.

At the estate the sex and partying continued. Shade tried to interest Harford in bondage, but he preferred more conventional sex. To keep down expenses Shade arranged for one of his patients to be sexually used by Harford, at no cost as it was considered part of her therapy.

Harford was apprehensive that Shade&#8217;s patient might prove to be unstable and problematic. The patient, a twenty nine year old buxom blond, was delivered to the estate personally by Shade, in his Porsche. After a brief introduction Shade departed, leaving the couple alone.

Linda made a favorable impression upon Harford. Although accustomed to performing bondage sex with Shade, she delivered one of the best blow jobs Harford had ever received. Shade seemed less than pleased when Harlan informed him of this, as if all Shade&#8217;s women were restricted to bondage sex.

A local attorney, with mob connections, was retained to represent Lydia at the competency proceedings. Dr. Chung would represent the hospital as the independent examiner. Dr. Devilius, a close friend of Dr. Shade, would represent Harford&#8217;s interests.

The outcome was thus assured. It was always in the hospitals interest to retain patients as long as possible, and Dr. Devilius would not go against the interests of the person paying him. Nurse Ratchet, who was responsible for maintaining the daily charts, could be counted upon to document the need for continuing hospitalization.

The likely outcome was that Lydia would be confined to the hospital for at least six months. During this period Harford would acquire the inheritance and spend the bulk of it. Lydia, upon her release, would have little recourse. Harford was prepared to relocate to Costa Rica if the necessity arose.

Lydia continued to endure the rigors of her involuntary confinement. She was still required to perform kitchen labor, but was not permitted to associate with any of the other patients. Access to her private room was limited to designated staff only. 

Nurse Ratchet was in charge of her therapy, which consisted primarily of keeping her medicated. The only sex permitted was with Ratchet. Predictably this resulted in tension with Nurse Mary and Dr. Chung, who both had a strong sexual interest in Lydia.

 No visitors, including Harford, nor any other type of communication with anyone outside the hospital was permitted. Isolation of Lydia was necessary for the diabolical plan to succeed.

Chung resented the fact that he no longer was Lydia&#8217;s therapist, however those days were numbered. Dr. Graves, the superintendent, would soon be taking a sabbatical leave, with Chung assuming the position of acting superintendent.

 Chung would then be in a position to assume charge of Lydia&#8217;s therapy. Nurse Ratchet would be reassigned to duties in another section of the hospital, and not permitted to have any contact with Lydia.

The competency hearing lasted less than an hour. Harford and Shade were present for the first time since Lydia&#8217;s hospitalization. She seemed oblivious to their presence, primarily because of the continuing drug therapy she had been receiving.

Dr. Devilius did not challenge any of Dr. Chung&#8217;s findings. Immediately upon conclusion of the testimony, Dr. Graves ruled that Lydia was incompetent and would remain in the hospital indefinitely for treatment. She was led away by two attendants, again seemingly oblivious as to what was transpiring.

Harford and Shade celebrated the decision by holding an orgy later in the evening. Shade ordered two escorts to service Harford, and two of his own patients to satisfy his bondage tastes. Harford was in a joyful mood as a result of the competency decision, such that the thought of paying for Harford&#8217;s escorts out of the inheritance, was more palatable.

Shade experimented with various bondage positions upon his two patients. For a period they were bound separately, then they were bound together in Siamese fashion, and forced to engage in prolonged kissing between themselves.

Harford for his part obtained the maximum worth for his money. He had both females lie side by side on his bed, as soon as he finished receiving a blow job from one, he immediately set out cunt fucking the other.

Shade uncharacteristically used cocaine at the start of, and during, the orgy. Harford, never one for drugs, consumed more than the usual amount of vodka, his favorite drink.

One week, and several orgies later, the whole nefarious scheme came to a crashing halt. Someone on the hospital staff tipped off the police and an investigation commenced.

Shade had foolishly remarked to one of the escorts, details of the scheme. It just happened to be the one who was subjected to forced bondage. The police were able to contact her, and she more than willingly provided a written statement.

From that point it was all downhill. Staff at Los Bravos Hospital described the unusual circumstances under which Lydia was held, especially the extended solitary confinement and the inordinate amount of time spent with Nurses Mary and Ratchet.



The next witness to be flipped by the police was Dr. Chung, who was provided immunity in exchange for his testimony. Harford, Doctor Shade, Nurse Ratchet and Nurse Mary were all indicted.&nbsp; Harford was blocked from receiving the inheritance, and Lydia was freed from the psychiatric hospital. The entire inheritance was awarded to her.

Harford fled to Costa Rica before the case came to trial. Dr. Shade was less fortunate, he received five years in jail and lost his medical license. Ratchet and Mary each received probation and were fired as well. Dr. Graves was not charged, but forced to retire.

Lydia has recovered from the trauma of her involuntary hospitalization and has a million dollar lawsuit pending against the hospital. Ironically her current boyfriend is a divorced psychiatrist, although one who was never affiliated with Los Bravos.

The effects of Lydia&#8217;s treatment at the hospital have not completely disappeared. Periodically she insists upon being restrained for two or three hours in a strait jacket, before being fucked,
 and her husband is only too happly to oblige.

Their sex life is mildly kinky but quite unconventional. Lydia has acquired a strait jacket, and on occasion requires her husband to wear it for the whole night. Suffice to say, Lydia refuses to wear the jacket, or engage in any other bondage activity.
