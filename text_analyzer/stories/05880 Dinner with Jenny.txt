Dinner With Jenny
By ThisYouWillDo &amp; Jenny.Wren


Mack sat at his desk thinking about Jenny.� He didn't quite know how it had happened, and he was willing to bet a month's pay that Jenny didn't know either.� They had been discussing fantasies for a while, and it must have come out of that.� Anyway, she had landed herself in this position, and she had promised - yes, promised � and now it was time for her to keep that promise.


Meanwhile, Jenny paced the floor nervously. She had tried reading, watching the TV, even doing a little tidying. Nothing, it seemed, could distract her thoughts from what she had agreed. What had she been thinking? It started out as a bit of a joke with a guy named Mack, she didn&#8217;t even know him, what he looked like or anything about him. And she had been talking about sexual fantasies with him over the internet. It was all harmless, but interesting fun.

She had told him of her fantasy, a fantasy that involved being naked in front of strangers, of having strangers look at her as she undressed. It was a fantasy, simple as that. Nothing she seriously contemplated turning into reality. She&#8217;d never even seen a stripper for goodness sake, so what did she really know about it? In reality she couldn&#8217;t imagine anything harder than standing before a group of people and undressing.&nbsp; She knew with certain conviction that she would freeze like a terrified rabbit before her audience. Fantasy was safe; fantasy was where she didn&#8217;t freeze and things didn&#8217;t go wrong. Anyway she told him, shared her fantasy with a stranger, and he in turn told her of his own.

Wow! That was her reaction! Wow! Wow! Wow! Just imagine it, lying naked on a table, no undressing, no performance of any kind, just lying on a table covered in food, food that would be eaten, food that would uncover her bit by bit as the food was slowly devoured. How erotic was that?

She told him she thought his fantasy was great. He was naturally pleased. He asked her if she thought it was the kind of thing she could do?&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t think, she reacted. �Of course,� she answered him rather offhandedly, �there&#8217;s nothing to do except lie there.�

Then came the dare, followed by the double dare. Jenny, in spite of herself, took up the challenge. Since they had never met and she didn&#8217;t really know him, she said only if he could find a venue where she would feel safe and secure would she do it!

A week passed and the subject was never mentioned again. And then he dropped his bombshell, he&#8217;d found a place and even gone so far as to book the catering staff too!

Oh my God! What could she say? 


She had made that promise willingly &#8211; almost unprompted.� She had even said go ahead when Mack said, should he confirm the booking of the room. Go ahead. I'll be there! was her exact phrase. It wasn't as if she'd had no chance to back out of it. But backing out was not something she was going to do. As soon as she'd first heard of the idea she had known she wanted to do that herself. Being a human platter had become her own fantasy, one that she wanted to realise more than anything else. And tomorrow, she'd have to go through with it.

It would take place in a private dining room at a nearby restaurant. It had been hard work to arrange that! They were concerned about their reputation. Money counts when times are hard, however.

It was important, for Jenny's sake, to keep the number of people who knew what was going to happen to a minimum, and so only a few staff would be informed. It was a certain bet, however, that this was a secret that could not be kept. So the staff that were told were chosen because of their encouraging and sympathetic natures.

Today, Mack thought, she&#8217;d be preparing herself. He had told her to avoid perfumes because it might taint the food. He also said she must have all body hair removed &#8211; not just shaved - before the meal took place. Obediently, she consented to this. He also told her she would have to prepare herself mentally because she would find lying motionless, quite difficult, and that it really takes a lot of training to take part in a Nyotaimori.�

"Well," She had said, "I'll do my best."

That night Mack found it hard to sleep, anticipating his forthcoming meal, and he knew it would be a night to remember for both of them - for him, because it was the first time he'd had the chance to eat a meal in this way. For Jenny, because of her role as the human platter. 

He had made all the necessary arrangements: the room, the chef, the Japanese girls who would help Jenny through the meal. And the audience. Jenny did not know about the audience. It would be made up of specially invited people of Mack&#8217;s acquaintance. Mack had arranged that Jenny&#8217;s preparation would take place before an audience. He knew that being naked in front of a crowd of unknown people would turn her on more than anything else: that it would be her star moment. It would maximise her humiliation and to intensify her emotions. But he also knew that the thought would scare her before the event, and she might not go through with it. So he had not told her about this part of the evening. None of the audience knew Jenny personally, so far as Mack knew, although it was certain that many had seen her about town.


At last, the day arrived. Jenny lay in bed late. She wasn't sleepy, but she felt she should rest so that she'd be alert this evening. Eventually, she got up and started to prepare herself. In the shower, she soaked herself fastidiously. She washed her hair first, because she was allowed scented shampoos, but she had to make sure there was no trace of perfume on the rest of her body. She cleaned herself thoroughly, noticing as she did, that the redness left from her waxing the day before had completely gone. She also realised how smooth she felt down there.

Jenny realised that she would need mental preparation, so she spent the rest of the day imagining how things would take place and what her role would be. Chiefly, she reasoned, it would mean that she had to lie still and let pieces of food be gradually lifted off her skin, exposing her body by degrees. She hoped it wouldn't tickle, and she made a mental note to prepare herself for that so that she wouldn't flinch at the wrong moment. 

She counted the remaining hours until she was to allow her naked body to be covered in sushi. Sushi of all things! She would stink worse than a fishmonger when they were through covering her in slimy bits of cold fish and oysters!

Six hours later Jenny was standing in her bedroom wrapped in a towel as she dried her hair. The nerves were starting to get the better of her now. If she paused for just a moment, she would feel the swarm of butterflies take flight in her stomach. She switched the drier off and looked at her clothes laid neatly out on the bed. He had been very specific about what she should wear and it struck her as odd given that she would only be taking them all off as soon as she got there. A loose fitting dress, a &#8216;floaty&#8217; dress he called it, sheer white panties and very high heels. Nothing else, except a shawl for wearing outside.

Jenny had chosen a plain white summer dress that fell to her knees with slim shoulder straps. It had to sit high on her chest because she wasn&#8217;t to wear a bra. She dressed quickly, two items of clothing and no make up made for quick dressing. She slipped on her high-heeled shoes and she was ready.&nbsp; The shoes were new and had the highest heels she&#8217;d ever worn.&nbsp; She felt a little wobbly at first.&nbsp; But she soon found the right posture and began to feel comfortable, in them

Mack had told her to arrive at seven pm and to announce herself at the Reception Desk. As soon as she did, she was told to wait in the foyer for a few minutes. She moved to the side of the large reception area and waited. 

She tried to make herself inconspicuous because she felt that everyone could see she was bra-less, while the light material of her dress clung closely to her breasts and to her thighs, leaving very little to the imagination. 

Ten minutes later, a very pretty Japanese girl appeared and walked over to Jenny, smiling. She gave her a very small bow when she reached her and said "Good evening Jenny-San. I am Suki. I am very pleased to meet you and I look forward to helping you tonight. I will show you where you will be."

Jenny allowed herself to be led by the arm into the dining room. There were about 20 tables in the room, some small, some large enough for party groups. Some tables were already occupied, others were filling. 

Jenny felt the men&#8217;s eyes staring at her breasts as they moved beneath her dress in response to every step she took, and her nipples became a little more pronounced, pressing against the light material. 

The restaurant was a very popular dining place. There was a dance floor in the middle of the room, with a small raised stage to one side. They walked to the end of the dining room, and Suki opened the door to a small private room. They went in and Jenny saw it was very well furnished. There were a couple of easy chairs, a large couch and a coffee table. But Jenny's eye fell on the dining table in the middle of the room with a single seat. It was laid for a single diner, and beside the table was a trolley, not unlike a hospital trolley for moving patients. Suki told her that she would be lying on this, and would she be comfortable? Jenny said she thought that she would, though she really had no idea.

Jenny&#8217;s mind was filled with endless possibilities, and the butterflies in her stomach were rioting as she tried to imagine herself lying naked on the trolley. 

Suki took her hand and smiled at her reassuringly.

"Have you done this before?" Jenny asked, nervously.

"Yes," Suki replied. "That is why I am here &#8211; to help prepare you for what will happen."

Jenny felt a bit better.&nbsp; Suki was at the door. "Come, Jenny-San. We must go now."

They left the room and closed the door. The dining room had almost filled up by now. A small dais had been erected in the dance floor, and a table stood on it. Most of the room was lit with subdued lighting, but the stage was very bright, with footlights shining up from the floor, and spotlights shining down from above. Suki led Jenny to the dais, and they waited there while it was set for Jenny to eat.

Jenny felt very conscious of the other diners who seemed to be watching with fascination as she waited near the front of the stage, just where the lights shone on her most intensely. There was a murmur of whispered conversation around the room. Jenny caught something. Immediately she looked down and realised that the bright lights had made her dress almost transparent, and her breasts and white panties were showing through for everyone to see. There was nothing she could do about it now except wonder, &#8216;Was Mack sitting out there somewhere watching her?&nbsp; He must have arranged this. Was he pleased with her? Did he appreciate how humiliated she felt? Did he know how thrilled she was too?

Jenny waited anxiously, willing the waiter to finish quickly.&nbsp; She wanted to be out of the glare of the lights.�But Mack had instructed that he should take his time at this point so that Jenny&#8217;s obvious charms would be on display for as long as possible. Eventually it was ready, and Suki sat her down. "You must eat now." She smiled.

Two more Japanese girls appeared and served Jenny her dinner. It was a lightly poached fish with new potatoes and fennel, served with a light German white wine. Jenny's throat was almost too dry and tight to eat because of her tense excitement. She felt so self-conscious, sitting alone in the middle of the room and the centre of attention. Aware of everyone's eyes on her as she ate, her knife and fork became very heavy, and she began to tremble slightly. She was feeling so tense she almost wanted cry and to run away.

Suki understood and whispered, "It's OK, Jenny-San. You are a beautiful girl. You�have nothing to worry about.�

At last Jenny finished. The two Japanese girls cleared the table and moved it away. Suki took Jenny by both hands and stood her up. She moved her to the front of the dais and moved behind her. All eyes were on Jenny again. The lights shone on her and through the thin layer of her dress. Jenny licked her dry lips. She knew she was on display again and flushed strongly, wondering if anyone out there knew her. Just then, Suki started to unzip her dress. Jenny was startled and started to turn. Suki held her back and whispered soothingly, "Shhhh. It's Okay. Let it happen."

Nervously, Jenny turned her head back to look out over darkened room. Conscious of all the unseen eyes that were upon her, she felt her face redden as Suki silently slipped the straps from her shoulders. Her dress swiftly slid down her body to the floor as Jenny stood motionless, hardly daring to breath. A murmur passed through the room, one or two even began to applaud as Jenny stood before them in nothing more than her heels and a pair of sheer briefs. Instinctively, Jenny moved a shielding hand across herself, but Suki gently pressed Jenny's arms back to her side and said, "Don't be nervous. They like you." 

The two other girls returned, carrying bowls of water with lemon juice in it. They began to wash Jenny's body with this water. It was ice-cold. Jenny's nipples hardened as the water drained over them and she tried to ignore her embarrassing display. Before Jenny knew what was happening, Suki crouched behind her, deftly dragging Jenny's panties down her thighs to her feet, drawing appreciative applause from Jenny&#8217;s audience. Suki tapped Jenny&#8217;s ankle, and Jenny raised one foot, then the other, so Suki could slip the dress and panties out from beneath them. The girls continued to wash Jenny, making sure her most intimate parts were well drenched. 

Jenny was both embarrassed and exhilarated at the same time. She was still aware that everyone was watching her, but found herself floating in a world of her own.

Now that the preparatory ablutions had been completed, Suki took Jenny's hand and led her slowly, naked, between the tables towards the kitchens. As they moved through the rooms, a quiet ripple of applause followed them. Women stared in quiet envy and the men gawped in lustful silence.

"Jenny-San, they all loved you. You big hit." said Suki. "Now we must prepare you for Mack. He will love you too."

Jenny lay on her back with her arms reaching to the edge of the trolley - but not clutching it. Her legs were parted slightly so that her heels touched the trolley's corners. They began to prepare the meal in reverse by starting with dessert. A small portion of cherries was cleaned and de-stalked before the stones were removed. Then the chef put his hand between Jenny's legs and pressed a cherry inside her. She relaxed her legs, and her face turned bright red like the cherries he was slipping into her. He then place two more above and below her clitoris and Jenny was acutely aware of their presence. The intention was to arouse Jenny as much as possible. Then Suki told her that, no matter how much she wanted to, she must not let herself orgasm while Mack was eating from her. Jenny nodded her head in understanding, though she doubted Suki had any cause for concern on that count.

Next, the chef placed a flower over Jenny's pussy as solitary guardian of her modesty. Over her tummy, he placed several thin slices of salmon. Then he made a chrysanthemum pattern around Jenny's belly button with slices of blowfish - highly poisonous if�not prepared properly. This chef was an expert, however.

All down her legs were placed various kinds of fish-food or vegetables rolled in sushi rice. Slices of lemon and orange were laid out on Jenny ribs below her breasts, together with cubed chicken pieces, asparagus, tomatoes and sliced carrots. Then two whole lobsters were placed on supports in the space between her body and her arms. They were positioned so as to appear as if they were climbing over her, and a claw from each lobster was positioned to look like it was pinching Jenny's nipple. In fact, the chef deliberately closed the claws tightly, so they really were gripping her nipples hard. 

Every time she breathed, Jenny would feel the serrated edge of the lobsters&#8217; pinchers dig into her nipples, and their weight pulling at them. It was both irritating and maddeningly enticing at the same time. The urge to move the lobsters was almost overwhelming, but despite herself, Jenny remained in control.
 
At the end, a few more flowers were placed strategically on her, and then Jenny was drenched liberally with lemon juice. Finally, she was deemed ready. Suki lifted a full-length mirror up and over Jenny so she could see herself and how she would be presented to Mack.

"Mack will adore you," She said. Then she covered Jenny&#8217;s eyes with a blindfold, and warned her&nbsp; not speak at all while Mack was eating.� Then the trolley moved forwards. She was being taken back into the dining room in order to get to Mack's private dining room. 

It was only at this moment that Jenny realised she would have to be taken through the dining room in order to get to Mack's private room. A small hollow grew in her stomach, and she was grateful of the blindfold Suki had put on her.

The trolley was manoeuvred through the kitchen doors and the general hubbub in the dining room stopped almost at once. Jenny realised everyone was watching. She felt the trolley move a little to the right and stop. She could feel people near her. Then the trolley moved on and stopped again. She realised with shock, she was being displayed in turn to each table in the room. She could hear approving noises from the men, and whispers from the ladies, although she could not hear what they were saying. Sometimes the trolley would gently bump over a carpet join, or some other uneven part of the floor. The lobsters&#8217; pinchers almost drove her crazy with each little bump, and she could feel her aroused nipples hardening further between the pinchers. And the cherries inside her seemed to jostle at these times. She clenched her fists in an attempt to retain her composure, but Suki told her to relax.

The parade took a long time and she thought she must have been paraded naked in front of over a hundred people. Eventually, she felt the trolley being pushed through the door into the private dining room where Mack was waiting.� He had got there while Jenny was being prepared for him.

"Hi, Jenny" said Mack. 

Jenny remained silent as she had been told to.&nbsp; Even though blindfolded, she felt better knowing that she was no longer being viewed by the people outside.&nbsp; Her mind was working rapidly, firstly to locate the voice and determine where he was stationed in relation to her; and secondly to try to take stock of the man behind the voice. What was he like? What did he think of her being displayed in such a way?

Her trolley was positioned next to the table and Jenny waited. Mack was finishing a drink, although Jenny could not know this.

"You look absolutely fantastic, Jenny" said Mack. "This is a sight I will carry in my mind forever."

Eventually Mack began to eat. He was using chopsticks and was lifting the fish very adeptly, and Jenny would feel the gentle touches from the chopstick, and a slight tugging of Jenny's skin as the fish separated from her flesh. For a while afterwards she could feel little cold patches on her skin where the meat had been. 

Mack was making small talk. How pretty she looked. Was she enjoying this as much as he was? Could she feel him as he took the food? 

She wanted to reply, and almost had on more than one occasion, but she remembered Suki&#8217;s instruction and maintained her silence. Worst of all was the not seeing, she so desperately wanted to see the man that was slowly eating his way to her nakedness.

She felt the lobster pincher move from her right breast. That was a blessing in itself, but then she imagined Mack&#8217;s eyes fixed on her exposed nipple and that just made things worse. She could feel herself blushing, and her reddened nipple swelling like a blooming flower bursting to life. 

Gradually, more and more food was taken off her, and more and more of her body was exposed. But there was too much for Mack to eat by himself and eventually he had had enough fish. Suki, who had been waiting and watching, moved the trolley away, while Mack settled back to relax. 

Jenny felt the trolley pass back into the main dining room, and she was positioned in the middle of the room. Eventually, the diners came up to her and began to take the remaining pieces of fish and vegetable rolls from her until it was all gone.&nbsp; Some people were gentle and she hardly noticed them taking their food.&nbsp; Others were rougher &#8211; deliberately so, Jenny thought &#8211; as she felt them using their fingers and groping her at the same time.&nbsp; Someone took the second lobster, and, Jenny&#8217;s left nipple hardened and grew like the right one had done before.&nbsp; After this, Jenny felt some of the diners squeeze and twist her nipples mercilessly.&nbsp; When this happened, she heard Suki shoo the men away, but not before they had had several painful moments to play with them. At last, Jenny lay there, exposed to everyone.&nbsp; Despite her soreness in places, she was still aroused.&nbsp; In fact, enduring the pain in silence had been erotic for her in itself.&nbsp; 

Suki now cleaned Jenny&#8217;s body where she lay, with warm water this time. She also removed the blindfold. Jenny&#8217;s eyes adjusted to see the crowds of people moving between the tables to get drinks, to talk to each other, or just to admire the naked girl in the middle of the room. This time, however, Suki quickly slapped anyone&#8217;s hand away if it came too near Jenny&#8217;s body: they had had their chance to feel her, but that time had now passed.&nbsp; Apart from the solitary flower, Jenny was now totally exposed to everyone&#8217;s view. And beneath the flower were the cherries inside her.&nbsp; When she had finished, Suki took the trolley back to where Mack was waiting with another glass of wine.

Once it was repositioned, Suki made her way to the lower end of the trolley and, taking Jenny&#8217;s right ankle, she bent her leg at the knee, turning her lower leg inward and opening Jenny&#8217;s thighs. Jenny gasped, but did not protest as Suki did the same with her left leg, leaving her feet together in the centre of the trolley and her legs widely splayed. She then bowed to Mack, and to Jenny before taking her leave.

Jenny watched Mack move to the end of the trolley and survey the length of her naked body. She didn&#8217;t have to see his eyes to know where he was looking. A wave of warmth radiated outward from the pit of her stomach. Mack reached forward and plucked the flower from the crease to her womanhood. Jenny shuddered inwardly.

And then she felt his fingers, lingering as they teased the first cherry from its place above her clitoris. She could feel the warmth of moisture starting to flow as his fingers reached for the second cherry. Would he know that there were more still hidden inside her? A hot flush swept up from her stomach at the very thought of it!

Her heart started racing. A shiver ran down her spine, and when she felt his finger probe her, she almost leapt out of her skin. She heard him chuckle quietly to himself, and allowed herself to relax as his finger slipped gently within the delicate folds of skin.

God! She could feel the state of her own arousal, and realised that he too must be aware. It felt like every touch would be enough to push her over the edge as one by one, Mack found the cherries one by one and ate them slowly. His finger burrowed, seeking the last cherry, but deliberately teasing her at the same time.&nbsp; Jenny could scarcely stop her hips from gently bucking as his finger wormed its way inside her. He eased it out but then seemed to lose it right at the last.

Moments later his face pressed between her thighs. Her knees jerked upward in reflex, and in the same breath Jenny cried out with surprise. His tongue worked inside her and without thought, she crossed her ankles behind his back, raising her hips from the trolley to meet his hungry lips. She hissed to herself, sucking on air as his tongue teased the final cherry out and chased it to her clitoris.&nbsp; He licked every part of her pussy, and played with her clitoris by pressing the cherry against it with his tongue.&nbsp; Eventually, when Jenny was trembling with passion, he pulled himself from between her legs.&nbsp; Jenny reluctantly let him go. She lay still and embarrassed as he moved to hover above her head. He looked down into her eyes as his face lowered to hers. As their lips met, he pressed the final cherry against her teeth. She accepted it and bit it in two before swallowing the pieces. She looked into his smiling eyes and felt a warmth. Her hand found his, and she pulled it onto her breast while moving her legs apart.&nbsp; He glanced down at her and she watched his face for reaction, fearing most the one of rejection. His face turned toward her and he leaned in once more. �Thank you.� He whispered.

She looped an arm around his neck, dragging him to her and kissed him deeply.
