Synopsis: You move abroad, suddenly become the owner of three fellow human beings - and then what?Part 1  
&quot;Here we are now&quot;. My father's business agent stopped in front
  of an impressive six storey redbrick building and I got out to have a look.
  The house sported a well-kept front garden with lawns and rosebushes and an
  overall very pleasant old-fashioned look. &quot;Quite nice, isn't it? Thirty
  flats, six to each floor and a penthouse&quot;. &quot;For me?&quot; &quot;The
  penthouse? Of course, but the rest as well. Your dad considers it a very good
  investment, so it's yours&quot;. &quot;Mine?&quot; &quot;Something to get you
  started in business, he told me&quot;. &quot;Not quite like him, but very generous&quot;.
  A teenage boy opened the door to a spacious hall decorated in marble, dropping
  to one knee and bowing his head as we passed by. Only a pair of grey shorts
  covered his deeply tanned body and a short chain hobbled his bare feet. A girl
  dressed in the same kind of shorts, but with the addition of a T-shirt was
  chained to a small reception counter by her right ankle. &quot;Mr. Marshall.
  The new owner&quot;, the agent announced. She too bent a knee in front of me. &quot;Welcome
  to Marsfield Gardens, Sir&quot;. Like the boy, she had a steel ring locked
  around her slender neck. &quot;Thank you&quot;. &quot;Your luggage will be
  brought up right away, Sir, if it may please you&quot;. &quot;It does&quot;.
  She smiled shyly and lowered her eyes. &quot;This is your private lift, John&quot;.
  The agent held the door open. &quot;Coming&quot;. I sent the girl one last
  look and sauntered over. &quot;Quite a pretty little thing&quot;. &quot;Was
  she? I didn't notice&quot;. We rose soundlessly. &quot;They belong to the company
  servicing the estate&quot;. The lift stopped and the doors opened to reveal
  a spacious hall. &quot;I hope you like your temporary home&quot;. &quot;Quite
  grand for a student, isn't it?&quot;  
I'd come over for a three-year post-graduate study in international politics
  and was of course joking. My dear parent has a wide range of interests and
  investments all over the world and I suppose that most people would consider
  me a spoiled upper class brat. Well, young man rather, I was twenty-three at
  the time. Perhaps I am, to some extent, at least used to a life in luxury,
  but the fast crowd never attracted me. I've always liked studying, have been
  reading voraciously ever since I could. Not that I don't like sports and I've
  been to all the parties I could wish for, but my real interest is the world
  around us. As a child it was animals and plants, later on history, and now
  it's politics. Luckily my father appreciates that, so we've always been on
  the best of terms, not least, I think, because even if I of course do enjoy
  the advantages of being rich, I don't overdo it.  
The agent looked somewhat unnerved and hurriedly opened the door to a large
  sitting room, elegantly equipped with modern furniture and Oriental rugs scattered
  on the gleaming hardwood floor. One wall was a great window, opening to a roof
  garden. &quot;Very grand, I dare say&quot;. I passed through the sliding doors
  to meet a superb view across town and country. The garden covered two thirds
  of the top of the building, with well-grown orchard trees, a little lawn, and
  beds of flowers, even a fairly large swimming pool. &quot;But I like it&quot;. &quot;Thanks,
  there's more&quot;. &quot;So I expect, at least a place where one can sleep&quot;.
  I followed him back to the hall to look into a bright and airy bedroom, with
  a luxurious bath, three spare rooms, a spacious study, and a diningroom. A
  door opened to a well-equipped kitchen. &quot;I don't just like it, I'm already
  falling in love with it&quot;. The agent lit up in a relieved smile. 'Poor
  guy, my father can be very demanding', I thought. &quot;But I don't know much
  about housekeeping, nothing at all, to be honest, so I'll need some sort of
  catering, and maid and cleaning service. Perhaps that company, you mentioned,
  can do that for me&quot;. &quot;Of course, but I thought you'd be more comfortable
  with your own staff&quot;. &quot;Wouldn't that be overdoing it a bit? I mean,
  we do have servants at home, of course, but after all that's a mansion in town
  and a manor house in the country. Part time help can easily maintain a small
  place like this and I don't much care for the obligations. Servants are fine,
  but do give you some trouble&quot;. &quot;Not over here, John. We use slaves&quot;. &quot;But
  I know nothing about handling slaves&quot;.  
I knew of them, of course, had seen them around on previous visits, even
  been served by some at the private homes I'd visited and at hotels and restaurants,
  but never had to deal with them directly. My own government had contemplated,
  but decided not to add slavery to the penal system. When introduced over here
  twenty years ago it was meant to save the cost of prisons and therefore included
  virtually all sorts of convicts. Soon, however, it proved much too risky to
  have hardcore criminals roaming around, even as slaves, and enslaving people
  past forty turned out to be unprofitable. So now only younger felons, males
  from the age of fifteen, females from eighteen, and up to thirty years of age,
  who'd committed minor crimes, were sentenced to slavery for periods of between
  five and twenty years. After that adjustment, the system worked well, and was
  very popular. All families, who could afford the not very high prices, kept
  slaves, and they were widely used in the service sector, at hotels, by cleaning
  companies, gardeners and at housing estates like this.  
&quot;Nothing to it, John. They come fully trained, so it's just a question
  of deciding how you want to be served and if not satisfied, you punish them&quot;. &quot;Well,
  I don't really know&quot;. &quot;It's the easiest thing in the world. I'm sure
  that you'll soon be a happy slaveowner, just like everybody else&quot;. He
  coughed nervously. &quot;As a matter of fact I've already bought some for you&quot;. &quot;Without
  even bothering to ask me?&quot; I raised a questioning eyebrow. &quot;It's
  so common over here that I didn't think twice about it, just like buying furniture.
  If you don't want to keep them, I can sell them again, easily, and without
  loss. But why not try them out? I'm convinced that once you've been served
  for a day or two, you won't want to miss it&quot;. I considered for a moment. &quot;Very
  well, on your recommendation then, but please consult me first if you want
  to do something for me another time&quot;. &quot;Of course and I'm sorry, but...&quot;. &quot;It's
  all right. What have you bought and where are they?&quot; &quot;In the slaveroom.
  There are three of them: A well-educated male of twenty-one as head slave and
  general servant. A not very bright, but strong and reliable boy of seventeen
  for heavier task, like taking care of the garden, your car, driving you if
  you prefer that. And a very pretty girl of nineteen, who's a good cook and
  can satisfy your personal needs&quot;. &quot;My what?&quot; &quot;Well, serve
  you in bed&quot;. He grinned and added hastily: &quot;Most of us use our slaves
  for sex&quot;. &quot;But you're married!&quot; &quot;I am, happily, but a slavegirl
  isn't a lover, just a tool when you need relief, and my wife sometimes uses
  our slaveboy. It's normal, actually very good for married couples. No need
  to be sullen if your wife, or husband, isn't in the mood when you are&quot;. &quot;I
  see. Very well, please fetch them&quot;. &quot;Right away, John&quot;. I went
  back to the terrace to have closer look at the surrounding grounds far below.  
&quot;Here you are now&quot;. The agent returned with my slaves; naked and
  collared, ankles hobbled by a short chain and wrists cuffed, or so I judged
  from the way they kept them rigidly behind their backs. They sank to their
  knees and bowed their heads submissively. &quot;This is Fred, college graduate.
  Fifteen years of slavery for manslaughter&quot;. &quot;You've bought me a murderer?&quot; I
  looked astonished at the kneeling young man. &quot;Of course not. His sentence
  was for reckless driving. Next, Christine, who'd just finished high school
  when she got ten years for shoplifting, and last Tim, mechanics apprentice,
  twelve years for street-fighting. None of them have served another master,
  but Fred and Christine have had six months of advanced training, including
  a special course in French cooking for her. Tim just had the obligatory three
  months routine training for new slaves. Get up, girl, to let the master inspect
  you&quot;. She rose gracefully and spread her legs as far as the chain allowed,
  but kept her head bowed. A thick mane of chestnut hair fell almost to her shoulders,
  her young breasts were firm, with prominent nipples pierced by two small steel
  rings, and her slender legs incredibly long, tapering down to well shaped feet.
  A typical teenage beauty. I went around her, appreciating her straight back
  and pert little arse. &quot;Delicious, isn't she, though not a virgin, I'm
  afraid&quot;. The agent's eyes were gleaming. &quot;And just how would you
  know that she's not?&quot; &quot;Few girls her age are and all female slaves
  are trained to serve their future masters in bed&quot;. &quot;I see. Why are
  they in chains?&quot; &quot;Standard procedure when delivered to their master.
  I have the key here&quot;. &quot;Thank you, and for your efforts. I can manage
  on my own now&quot;. &quot;Happy to be of service, John Your car is in the
  garage. I can see myself out&quot;. We shook hands and he disappeared inside.  
&quot;Please rise, Fred and Tim, and remove the chains&quot;. I unlocked
  Fred's wrist-cuffs and handed him the key. He gestured the girl to turn her
  back to him and I looked my youngest slave over. About six feet two or three
  of bulging muscles under a gleaming black hide. Like Christine's, his crotch
  was clean-shaven and his long cock was hanging low over a heavy ballsack. He
  too had rings in his nipples and I noticed the same on Fred. &quot;Member of
  a street gang, were you?&quot; He raised his head. &quot;Nah, Sir, just me
  and me mates. Guys like us got to stick together&quot;. &quot;Fighting other
  gangs?&quot; &quot;Yeah, nothing serious, just a bit of fun, Sir&quot;. &quot;Which
  earned you twelve years as a slave&quot;. He shrugged his broad shoulders,
  grinning shyly. &quot;Yeah, that's how it is for poor guys like us, Sir, not
  allowed no fun&quot;. He lowered his eyes, but the grin never left his face. &quot;And
  what did you steal, Christine?&quot; &quot;Underwear, Sir&quot;. &quot;Ten
  years for a bra and a pair of panties?&quot; &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. She looked
  briefly at me, then averted her eyes, but not before I'd caught a look of sheer
  terror. I shook my head. &quot;Can you make me a vodka martini, Fred?&quot; &quot;At
  once, Sir&quot;. I sat down in a deck chair beside the pool and was a few minutes
  later offered a glass by the kneeling slave. &quot;Thank you&quot;. I took
  a sip. &quot;Excellent&quot;. &quot;Thank you, Sir&quot;. He was about my height,
  with short-cropped fair hair, slim, but with well-defined muscles, a flat stomach,
  slender cock and strong legs. &quot;What happened?&quot; &quot;Sir?&quot; His
  calm eyes looked questioningly at me. &quot;The manslaughter incident which
  made you a slave?&quot; &quot;My car skidded on black ice, Sir, and rammed
  into another vehicle. The driver was thrown out and killed&quot;. &quot;No
  seatbelt?&quot; &quot;No, Sir&quot;. &quot;But you were using yours?&quot; &quot;Yes,
  Sir&quot;. &quot;Were you drunk?&quot; &quot;No, Sir. It was in the afternoon,
  I...&quot;. He swallowed hard. &quot;I was on my way home from University,
  Sir&quot;. &quot;Bad luck&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. &quot;I mean; it was
  just an accident, wasn't it? And you were enslaved for fifteen years!&quot; &quot;That's
  the law, Sir. I did cause the death of another man&quot;. &quot;Hardly. Black
  ice was not your fault, neither that he was fool enough not to use his seatbelt&quot;.
  He didn't answer, but his eyes darkened.  
&quot;Be that as it may. You know how to organise my household?&quot; &quot;I
  believe so, Sir&quot;. &quot;Then do that. My luggage will be brought up shortly.
  Have it unpacked&quot;. I handed him the keys to my suitcases. &quot;Dinner
  at eight&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. &quot;Don't you have any clothes?&quot; &quot;Yes,
  Sir&quot;. &quot;Get dressed then, all of you&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;.
  I waved and heard them leave. After a while, I shed jacket and tie, opened
  my collar and took off my shoes to be more comfortable. &quot;It's seven thirty,
  Sir&quot;. I woke up with a start to see Fred on his knees beside my chair,
  now dressed in white shorts. &quot;Ah, I must have dozed off&quot;. &quot;Would
  you want to change before dinner, Sir?&quot; &quot;Well, yes&quot;. He offered
  me my shoes, but I shook no and padded to the bedroom. The living room seemed
  brighter, with vases of fresh flowers scattered on the tables. I sat down on
  the bed to take off my socks, but in a flash Fred was on his knees in front
  of me. &quot;Allow me, Sir&quot;. He bared my feet, then rose on his knees
  to unbutton my shirt. &quot;Would you want to shower, Sir?&quot; I nodded. &quot;Tim&quot;,
  he called softly and the teenager came running to bend a knee. &quot;Shower&quot;,
  Fred whispered, while helping me out of my shirt and unbuckling my belt. Tim
  hurried to the bathroom and Fred looked up at me. &quot;Would it please you
  to rise and allow me to relieve you of your trousers, Sir?&quot; I did as asked
  and was soon naked. &quot;Tim has the shower ready for you, Sir&quot;. I nodded
  and strode to the bathroom, where the boy was kneeling beside a fresh bathmat.
  I went under the pleasantly warm spray to soak myself and jumped with surprise
  when a hand slid down my back. Tim had dropped his shorts and was soaping me
  up! No one had done so since I was a baby, but it did feel nice when his hands
  covered me in a rich lather, massaged my neck and shoulders gently, and went
  between my arsecheeks. He came round to kneel and wash my feet, continued up
  my shins and thighs and calmly raised my cock to wash the ballsack. When he
  rose to do my chest, I asked: &quot;Were you trained for this?&quot; &quot;Yes,
  Sir&quot;. He smiled broadly. &quot;Feels good, Sir?&quot; &quot;Strange, but
  yes, very good&quot;. &quot;Thanks, Sir&quot;. He finished by washing my hair
  and stepped out to let me rinse, hurriedly wiping himself with a rough cloth.
  When I left the shower the two slaves were ready with fluffy, heated towels
  to dry me, without forgetting the crack of my arse or the spaces between my
  toes.  
&quot;Something comfortable, Sir?&quot; Fred had laid out a pair of jeans
  and a T-shirt. &quot;Yes&quot;. He knelt to help me into boxers and jeans,
  asked me to sit down to dress my feet in socks and loafers, and dragged the
  shirt over my head. &quot;Dinner will be ready in fifteen minutes, Sir, if
  it may please you&quot;. He was combing my hair. &quot;Where would you want
  it served, Sir?&quot; &quot;In the garden, I think&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;.
  He nodded to Tim, who'd cleaned the bathroom. &quot;A drink, Sir?&quot; Fred
  followed me to the terrace, where his fellow was busy laying the table. &quot;Sure&quot;.
  A couple of minutes later I was offered another vodka martini and strolled
  over to lean on the railing, looking out over the city lights.  
When I turned and emptied my glass, Fred held a chair for me and I sat down
  at table, laid with china and silverware, candles and a bowl of fresh flowers.
  Seconds later Tim placed an ice-cold gaspacho in front of me and Fred poured
  a glass of chilled dry sherry. The soup was perfect and I ate slowly, savouring
  every mouthful. When I put down the spoon, Tim whisked the plate away and Fred
  placed another glass in front of me, cool Chablis. The black slaveboy returned
  to serve a hot plate of Dover sole and offer me small potatoes and sauce beurre
  blanc. The fish was as perfect as any I'd ever enjoyed. Fred stayed behind
  my chair, topping up the glass and offering more sauce. When I'd finished,
  Tim was back to remove the plate. I looked over my shoulder. &quot;Splendid,
  absolutely splendid!&quot; &quot;Thank you, Sir&quot;. Fred looked gravely
  at me. &quot;But where did you get this?&quot; &quot;Your slavegirl made it,
  Sir&quot;. &quot;The fresh fish and the other ingredients?&quot; &quot;I asked
  Reception to buy it for you, Sir. There are several very good shops in the
  neighbourhood&quot;. &quot;Why not go yourself?&quot; &quot;We're not allowed
  to leave the premises without your permission, Sir, and I didn't want to disturb
  you. Would you prefer cheese prior to or after dessert, Sir?&quot; &quot;Before,
  like in France&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. He left to come back a moment later
  with a selection of fine cheeses, biscuits and another glass, this time a full-bodied
  Burgundy. &quot;Excellent; a good wine merchant&quot;. &quot;Thank you, Sir&quot;. &quot;Or
  did you select them?&quot; &quot;Yes, Sir. I've undergone special training
  as a gentleman's slave, Sir&quot;. He removed plate and cheese, topped up my
  glass and left me to enjoy it. Ten minutes later he was back with a lemon souffl&eacute; and
  a glass of cool Riesling.  
&quot;Marvellous!&quot; I leaned back and emptied my glass. &quot;Thank you,
  Sir&quot;. &quot;Call Christine&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir. Would you want coffee,
  Sir?&quot; &quot;And a Calvados, if we have that&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;.
  She was wearing shorts like the boys and a clean white apron, barely covering
  her breasts. &quot;A very fine meal&quot;. &quot;Thank you, Sir&quot;. She
  curtsied, eyes to the ground. &quot;I didn't know your tastes, Sir&quot;. &quot;I
  like almost anything, especially when it's as well prepared as this, so just
  go on surprising me&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. She curtsied again and disappeared
  inside. Fred came out with a tray. &quot;Your coffee, Sir&quot;. I moved to
  a deck chair beside the pool and sat down to digest the meal. He knelt beside
  me; head bowed and hands clasped behind his back. &quot;I'm rather tired and
  suffering from jet-lag, but you seem to have everything under control, no need
  for me to interfere&quot;. &quot;Thank you, Sir&quot;. &quot;Any questions
  that can't wait until tomorrow?&quot; &quot;Just one, Sir. Would you want us
  locked up or just chained?&quot; &quot;Is that necessary?&quot; He hesitated. &quot;Slaves
  are mostly caged or chained at night, Sir, but there are no cages up here&quot;. &quot;I
  asked if it is necessary. Do you run away?&quot; &quot;No, Sir&quot;. &quot;Where
  do you actually sleep?&quot; &quot;There's a slaveroom behind the kitchen,
  Sir&quot;. &quot;Well, put on those ankle chains when you go to bed&quot;. &quot;Yes,
  Sir&quot;. &quot;Didn't I tell you to get dressed?&quot; &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;.
  He looked surprised. &quot;Don't you have a shirt?&quot; &quot;Yes, Sir, but
  most masters prefer their slaves in shorts only, if not naked&quot;. &quot;I
  want Christine to dress decently. You and Tim put on shirts when leaving the
  house&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. &quot;You may go now, and retire to bed
  when ready&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir. Thank you, Sir. Good night, Sir&quot;. He
  rose, bowed to me and disappeared inside.  
A moment later Tim came out to kneel beside my chair and top up the coffee.
  It was a warm evening and I dozed off again to wake up and find that it was
  almost midnight. The boy was still on his knees beside me and the coffee in
  my cup fresh and hot. &quot;Fantastic&quot;, I mumbled. &quot;Sir?&quot; He
  looked up with a pained smile, shifting his knees. &quot;Fantastic service
  you offer me&quot;. &quot;Thanks, Sir, but it's just what we were trained for,
  Sir&quot;. &quot;Still, but I've better go to bed now&quot;. &quot;Yessir&quot;.
  He jumped up, grimacing with pain and followed me to the bedroom. I sat down
  and he dropped to his undoubtedly aching knees to relieve me of shoes and socks. &quot;You
  want your feet rubbed, Sir?&quot; &quot;Why not?&quot; He sent me a smile and
  bowed to let his tongue wash the top of my left foot. &quot;But what are you
  doing?&quot; &quot;Lick your feet, Sir, before rubbing them; feels very nice,
  Sir&quot;. And it did. He sucked on my toes, raised the foot to clean the sole
  and rub it gently, and then changed to the other foot.  
I was surprised, but very pleased, to say the least. One of my childhood
  friends, son of a farmhand at our country estate, introduced me to the pleasures
  of foot licking. Well, not just like that. It began innocently enough when
  we were playing hide and seek in the woods. Our games developed into cowboys
  and Indians, with me as the Indian, who captured and tied the poor boy to a
  tree and tortured him. Just tickling, at first, but later on I used a switch
  on his bare thighs to encourage him to tell where his fellows were hiding.
  I guess that he was a natural submissive because he put up with it, even if
  he was about a head taller than me and much stronger, but perhaps it was just
  because I was the squire's son and therefore in his eyes naturally superior.
  Yet it was he who suggested that we changed roles to allow him dressing like
  an Indian, in just a loincloth, a headband with a few feathers stuck in and
  war paint on his chest. Now he was tortured to tell where his tribe hid its
  treasures and we gradually went further. I strung him by the wrists from a
  branch and whipped his back, sometimes with stinging nettles, or hogtied him
  and whipped the soles of his feet. Not real torture, but it did hurt. It began
  when we were about eight and we only saw each other during summer when my parents
  moved down to the country. When turning twelve he began working at the estate
  after school and was supposed to spend his summer holidays supplementing his
  family's meagre income. I complained about the loss of a playmate and my father
  agreed that he could retain his pay when spending time with me. I don't know
  if that changed our relationship, but perhaps it did. Learning Latin at school
  made me grow an interest in ancient Greece and Rome and our games turned in
  that direction. Now I became a centurion and he a barbarian warrior, who was
  captured and tortured. We, or rather he, built a secret cabin at the brink
  of a forest pond and we spent days there, imagining that it was my villa and
  he a newly enslaved prisoner of war. A very reluctant and unwilling slave,
  who had to be kept firmly in place, chained hand and foot and often chastised
  with a switch. He carried heavy loads through the forest, hobbled and barefoot,
  served me snacks and soft drinks on his knees, was used as my footstool. It
  was an important part of the game that I forced him to do something unpleasant,
  so he could rebel against me and be punished. One such thing was licking my
  feet, something both of us considered gross and humiliating. But it aroused
  me to see him there, on his knees, restrained with chains and padlocks and
  near naked, reluctantly licking my sweaty feet, always under the threat of
  the switch. Aroused, yes, but sex never played any part of our relationship.
  I don't remember ever seeing his dick. It went on until we were about sixteen
  and grew other interests. He matured earlier than I, village boy as he was,
  began dating girls and go dancing, but we remained friends and still see each
  other, even if he's married now, with two kids. It didn't harm him either,
  our friendship. He's now head gardener at the estate. But I did miss our slave
  games and his submissiveness. His wife is a wisp of a girl and sometimes I've
  been wondering about their relationship when her towering hulk of a husband
  is jumping to meet her every wish.  
&quot;Good, Sir?&quot; The slaveboy beamed at me. &quot;Very good, Tim&quot;. &quot;Thanks,
  Sir&quot;. He rose on his knees to draw off my shirt, opened my trousers and
  dragged them down. My cock sprang free, grown stiff by his ministrations and
  my reminiscences. &quot;You want me to help you with that, Sir?&quot; &quot;I
  want what?&quot; &quot;Me sucking you off, not healthy to sleep like that,
  Sir, it isn't&quot;. &quot;Do you consider me a faggot?&quot; &quot;Course
  not, Sir, but you need relief and a mouth is a mouth, isn't it? I can call
  Chris if you like, Sir&quot;. &quot;She's asleep, I hope&quot;. &quot;No problem,
  Sir. I fetch her?&quot; &quot;No, well, do it then&quot;. &quot;Yessir&quot;.
  I received another beaming smile before he relieved me of jeans and underwear
  and began licking up and down my shaft and sucking on my balls. It did feel
  good and even better when the hot mouth engulfed me and his tongue worked wonders.
  Within seconds I was shooting a heavy load and he swallowed frantically, licked
  me clean, and looked up again. &quot;Good, Sir?&quot; Good? Damn, it was the
  best blowjob I'd ever had! &quot;Are you gay?&quot; &quot;Nah, Sir&quot;. &quot;But
  you've done this before?&quot; &quot;Sure, part of the standard training, Sir.
  Practised on each other, we did&quot;. &quot;Why?&quot; He shrugged. &quot;A
  slave's duty, Sir. Most masters like it and mistresses too, we were told. You
  want a bath, Sir?&quot; &quot;No, just to brush my teeth&quot;. He jumped to
  the bathroom to stand ready with toothbrush and a glass of cool water. &quot;What
  time do you want to get up, Sir?&quot; He tugged the sheets and blankets around
  me and put the key to their cuffs on the bedside table. &quot;At eight and
  I'd like a cup of tea in bed&quot;. &quot;Yessir. Night, Sir&quot;.  
The light was dimmed and he left me to contemplate the day's turn of events.
  I suddenly owned three fellow human beings, body and soul. Exciting, frightening
  in a way, but definitely something to explore further. I hadn't dominated anyone
  since my childhood friend and we stopped playing six or seven years ago. Not
  that I hadn't dreamt about it, but grown-ups don't do things like that, except
  in a special sexual relationship perhaps. Of course I'd seen magazines, surfed
  the net, even sneaked into a SM shop, but none of the girls, I'd bedded so
  far, had shown any interest in that kind of sex. They squealed if I gave them
  a playful slap on their bare bottoms, wriggled delightfully if I caught their
  wrists in a firm grasp above their heads while I was up them, but didn't seem
  inclined to go any further. So I pushed the dream to the back of my mind, but
  never abandoned it. Now I had an opportunity to live out that dream. A delicious
  slavegirl, wrists tied to the headboard, long legs spread and tied above her
  head, sex open and inviting, and, why not, with red stripes across her strained
  buttocks. Not a dream, but something I could just do, without any protests
  or accusations of rape and abuse. No one would even think it odd or depraved.
  Or a strong black body in the same position? Not that I'd had any experience
  with gay sex, but at the bondage sites it did look tempting. Perhaps make all
  three of them kneel and raise their bare arses for my whip, before I decided
  which hole to use? The possibilities seemed endless. 'But you're a decent chap,
  aren't you, old boy? Could you really treat a helpless teenage girl like that?'
  I recalled the look in her eyes, terrified, yet resigned. 'Or a boy?' It had
  been fun when a child back in the woods, but fun for both of us, a consensual
  game. It would be no game for my slaves and most certainly not consensual,
  but then they couldn't do anything about it, weren't supposed to, were they?
  'They're convicted felons and it's your duty as their master to ensure that
  they're punished according to law'. If I got a bit of fun out of it, would
  that be more than I deserved for all my hard work? Perhaps not, but not at
  the price of losing my self-respect. 'You'll stay a good master, demanding,
  but not unfair or deliberately abusive. They'll be punished if they deserve
  it and you'll get your fun out of that. Some 'relief' too when needed. A slave's
  natural duty, as Tim told you. But you won't degrade yourself by turning into
  a sadistic monster, absolutely not'. With that decision I fell asleep.  
Fred brought my tea. I woke up when he drew the curtains aside to let in
  the sun; naked and hobbled. &quot;Good morning, Sir. I hope you slept well&quot;.
  He arranged the pillows behind my back and knelt to offer a tray with a cup
  and a plate of sweetbread. &quot;I did, thank you&quot;. &quot;Would you prefer
  a cooked breakfast, Sir?&quot; &quot;Sure&quot;. &quot;In the garden, Sir?
  It's already pleasantly warm&quot;. I nodded and he shuffled to the door, whispering
  to someone outside, then returned to the bedside. I sipped my tea, looking
  at his bowed head, curious about this slaveboy, young man rather, just two
  years younger than I, but limited myself to repeating that I relied on him
  to run my household to perfection. He meekly promised to do his best, asked
  when to serve my meals and humbly advised me to acquire a slave credit card
  and electronic slave passes to allow them shopping for supplies. Upon my question
  he explained that it was a small cell phone clipped to the slave's collar.
  If a police officer or a shop owner wanted to ascertain that he or she was
  acting under orders, they just pressed the button to connect to the master's
  phone.  
He ran my bath, soaped me up, dried and dressed me, and followed me to the
  roof garden. Tim was cleaning the pool and called a cheerful 'Morning, Sir',
  when I sat down at table. Fred poured my tea and Christine came out, naked
  and hobbled like the boys. Her body went rigid when she bent over to serve
  a hot plate and my hand slid down her arse. &quot;Relax, girl, I won't harm
  you, or rape you&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir. Thank you, Sir&quot;, she whispered
  and held the pose. I reached for her hanging breasts, fondling the firm flesh,
  gently pinching a nipple. &quot;Those rings&quot;, I looked up at Fred, &quot;Are
  they standard?&quot; &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. He was watching the nude girl anxiously. &quot;Our
  collars and rings mark us as slaves, Sir, and can be used to control or punish
  us&quot;. &quot;How?&quot; &quot;We can be chained or leashed by them, Sir.
  Weights may be hung from the nipple rings&quot;. &quot;I see. Thank you, Christine&quot;.
  She breathed a sigh of relief and shuffled off. Fred remained behind my chair
  and she came back a little later to take away the empty plate and offer me
  a basket of warm buns. &quot;Freshly baked?&quot; &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. Her
  hand was trembling. &quot;Look at me&quot;. The terror was still there. &quot;Christine,
  please don't be so scared. I promised not to harm you and I meant that. You'll
  be punished, but only if you've done something to deserve it, and I won't demand
  that you serve me sexually. Perhaps later, when you're more comfortable with
  this, but I don't want a terrified girl in my bed&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir. No,
  Sir&quot;. &quot;I'm very satisfied with your cooking&quot;. &quot;Thank you,
  Sir&quot;. &quot;Now, sit down and give me your feet&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;.
  Obviously still frightened she lowered her bare bum to the tiles and raised
  her legs, exposing her sex. I found the key in my pocket and unlocked the ankle
  cuffs. &quot;Is that another standard for slaves, shaving your pubes?&quot; &quot;Yes,
  Sir&quot;, Fred answered. &quot;You don't have to do that, Christine, if it
  makes you feel better&quot;. &quot;Thank you, Sir, but I don't like hair down
  there&quot;. &quot;As you prefer, now get dressed&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;.
  I was rewarded with a shy smile before she took her chain and fled.  
Fred buttered a bun for me and refilled my cup. &quot;Are slavegirls always
  that frightened?&quot; &quot;Most are, Sir, at least when newly enslaved. The
  hard training and the uncertainty about their future can be very scary for
  a young girl, Sir&quot;. &quot;Understandable. I hope she'll calm down soon&quot;. &quot;She
  will, Sir, but Chris is more scared than most. Her family keeps slaves and
  her two elder brothers can be very rough with their slavegirl, she's told us,
  Sir&quot;. &quot;Expecting the same from me. And she?&quot; &quot;Sir?&quot; &quot;How
  did she treat the slaves?&quot; &quot;I don't know, Sir, but if her brothers
  are allowed, eh...&quot;. &quot;To abuse the girl&quot;. &quot;Eh...yes, Sir.
  I think her family treats their slaves very strictly, most people do, Sir&quot;. &quot;You
  too?&quot; &quot;My parents have no slaves, Sir&quot;. &quot;Why not?&quot; &quot;They
  can't afford it, Sir&quot;. &quot;If they could?&quot; &quot;Yes, Sir. They
  would have a slave, or more. It's common and very convenient&quot;. &quot;So
  you don't consider slavery wrong?&quot; &quot;No, Sir&quot;. &quot;You accept
  your own?&quot; &quot;I do, Sir&quot;. &quot;All of it?&quot; &quot;Sir?&quot; &quot;You'll
  happily suck my cock or take it up your arse?&quot; &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. His
  eyes were as calm as ever. &quot;And Tim?&quot; &quot;We're your slaves, Sir,
  the three of us, here to serve you in any way you may wish&quot;. &quot;But
  won't like it?&quot; &quot;Slaves are not supposed to like what they have to
  do, Sir&quot;. &quot;I guess not. Now take off that chain and get dressed.
  Tim as well&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. He took the key. &quot;And don't send
  Christine to serve me until told differently&quot;. &quot;No, Sir&quot;.  
I spent the next two weeks getting accustomed to my new surroundings. It
  took me no time at home. Even used as I was to luxury and servants, my slaves
  surprised me. Fred or Tim was always kneeling beside or standing behind my
  chair, jumping to my every wish, dressed and undressed me, bathed me, rubbed
  my feet and my body. Christine produced a seemingly endless series of marvellous
  meals and the three of them kept the penthouse in perfect order. I acted 'masterly',
  but was polite, and, although sorely tempted by my slavegirl's half naked body,
  limited my sexual use of them to letting Tim suck me off when he saw me to
  bed. After the first few days Christine lost her frightened look and towards
  the end of the first week even sent me a timid smile when I thanked her for
  another splendid dinner. Fred was unfailingly polite and efficient and Tim
  cheerful, almost cocky, but always subservient. They gave me no reason to complain
  and I never saw them idle, so there was nothing to justify a punishment.  
Part 2  
It was a small town, centred around the university, and at this time of year,
  before the beginning of a new term, deprived of a large part of its occupants.
  There was no lack of caf&eacute;s, small restaurants, shops selling all kinds
  of delicacies, and discos, but the hustle and bustle of the student population
  was missing just now. I went around to get my bearings, always with Tim two
  steps behind me, when not driving my car. His eyes almost burst from their
  sockets when we on the first morning went down to the underground garage and
  I strode towards the large black vintage Bentley. &quot;That's yours, Sir?&quot;,
  he whispered in awe. &quot;Quite&quot;. I tossed him the keys and he looked
  dubiously at the unfamiliar car. &quot;I'm not sure I can drive that, Sir&quot;. &quot;Of
  course you can. It's a bit old-fashioned, but basically just a car&quot;. &quot;Yes,
  Sir. Do me best, Sir&quot;. I watched from the backseat while he tried the
  controls, tested the manual gearshift, and finally expertly manoeuvred it up
  to the streets. &quot;Gawd, Sir! 'Tis so beautiful, Sir&quot;. &quot;We do
  know how to make real cars where I come from, Tim&quot;. &quot;An' that's no
  error, Sir&quot;. Cars as such don't interest me. I don't even like driving,
  but have always been fascinated by the perfect, yet discreet luxury of vintage
  limousines. Tim turned out to be an excellent driver and I told Fred to let
  him spend some time getting familiar with the Bentley.  
If I hadn't paid notice to them before, the slaves, I did now. They were
  literally milling around. Scantily dressed, barefoot girls and boys trotted
  along the edge of pavements, always carefully keeping out of my way. They followed
  two steps behind their owners, waiting patiently, heads submissively bowed,
  while they chatted to friends in the streets or window-shopped, knelt by their
  chairs at the caf&eacute;s, carried their shopping bags. Most of the slaveboys
  wore just a pair of shorts, the girls a T-shirt as well, though I did spot
  some bare tits. I wouldn't say that they looked cheerful, but neither did they
  seem miserable, except some who were hobbled or sported a striped back.  
I paid a visit to the university and was cordially received by the provost,
  who showed me around. No wonder, really, my father had made a very handsome
  donation to their research fund. The tour finished at the office of the professor
  who'd tutor my studies. I knew of his reputation, of course, but had never
  met him, and found him a quite amiable man in his mid-forties. We were discussing
  my project when a hobbled slavegirl entered to serve coffee, accidentally spilling
  some in my saucer. Without breaking off our conversation my host casually slapped
  and backslapped her face. She stammered an excuse and ran off, tears running
  down her cheeks, to fetch a clean cup for me. &quot;Pity, really&quot;. The
  professor looked after her. &quot;She used to be one of my most promising students&quot;. &quot;What
  happened to her?&quot; &quot;A prank gone wrong. She lost a bet and had to
  streak down Main Street on a Sunday morning, flashing her boobies. Unfortunately,
  for her that is, she met some silly old cows on their way to church, who later
  claimed to have been offended. That earned her five years as a slave. I had
  her assigned to me when we bought her. Partly because I make good use of her,
  doing some of the more tedious research at the library for me, partly because
  she's very attractive&quot;. The girl returned to serve my coffee, this time
  without mishaps. &quot;Got one of the most delicious little arseholes I've
  ever encountered. And those tits! Show us&quot;. She dropped to her knees,
  hauling off the T-shirt and arching her back to present the soft mounds. &quot;Nice,
  aren't they? And now she can flash them all she likes, anywhere, or rather
  all I like. As long as her pubes are covered, she can run around practically
  naked without anyone taking offence. Ironic, isn't it?&quot; He caressed them
  idly while we resumed our discussion.  
My father had asked me to pay a visit to a Mr. Allen, one of his business
  acquaintances. He owned a large colonial style mansion on the outskirts of
  town and I made an appointment for the last day of my second week. A couple
  of naked slaveboys were busy mowing lawns and weeding flowerbeds when Tim stopped
  in front of the imposing entrance and jumped to let me out of the car. A barefoot
  girl, topless in a white miniskirt, showed me into a spacious hall with a grand
  curved double staircase, humbly asking me to wait while she informed her master
  of my arrival. I was studying a painting on the wall, trying to decide if it
  was an original, when an angry voice made me look up. &quot;You fucking, worthless
  idiot!&quot; A thickset, rather flabby, dark haired young man was dragging
  another slavegirl, this one naked, along the first floor balcony by her long,
  blonde hair and, when reaching the staircase, flung her down it. She stumbled,
  but managed to grab the banister for support and clung desperately to it when
  a vicious kick hit her arse. He raised his foot for another kick, but caught
  sight of me and ran past the sobbing girl down the stairs. &quot;Hi, I'm Harry.
  You're here to see my dad?&quot; &quot;John Marshall&quot;. We shook hands. &quot;Glad
  to meet you, John. Dad told you'd be dropping by. I'm up at Uni too, undergrad,
  of course&quot;. The nude girl had descended to kneel behind him, her forehead
  pressed to the floor and hands clasped behind her back. He half turned to hiss: &quot;Three
  hours on the horse&quot;. &quot;Yes, Master Harold. I'm sorry&quot;. &quot;I
  bet you are and you'll be mighty sore when you're done. Get out!&quot; She
  crept up to kiss his shoes, then scurried away, still on her hands and knees,
  displaying a severely striped arse. &quot;Sorry about that, but the stupid
  cunt scratched my cock while blowing me&quot;. I couldn't come up with an answer
  and instead asked what the 'horse' was. &quot;A high sawhorse with a triangular
  board on top. The slave straddles it; hands tied on her back and ankles to
  the board behind her arse. Very uncomfortable for her pussy&quot;. He shrugged. &quot;Damn
  good reminder. After three hours she'll hardly be able to walk. But do come
  in&quot;.  
I'd met his father back home and liked him, but Harry apparently hadn't inherited
  his open and friendly demeanour. Not that he was unpleasant, just seemed impatient
  and demanding. Mr. Allen had a naked boy rolled into a ball and chained to
  serve as a footstool and another topless girl kneeling beside his chair when
  we came out to the terrace to greet him. The girl, who'd met me at the door,
  stayed to kneel beside my chair and a third came out to serve Harry. &quot;Where's
  Julie?&quot; &quot;Had to send her down for a ride, hurt my cock, always clumsy.
  Should've learned by now&quot;. His father shook his head. &quot;I don't know
  why you keep her, if she's so annoying&quot;. He turned to me. &quot;Julie
  was at high school with Harold, they even dated for a while. She was caught
  with dope in her car, a couple of joints, and enslaved for ten years&quot;. &quot;That
  must be tough, especially for a girl from a good family&quot;. &quot;It's meant
  to be a punishment and it is. Our slave laws are strict, but fair and they've
  brought the crime rate down, taught foolish teenagers and youths to behave,
  most of them at least&quot;. They persuaded me to stay for lunch.  
We were already seated at table with our three serving slavegirls behind
  the chairs, when a lanky young man, or rather teenager, dressed in a white
  tennis outfit, burst through the French doors. &quot;Who owns that fantastic
  car outside?&quot; &quot;Daniel! Meet Mr. Marshall&quot;. &quot;Oops, sorry.
  Hello, Mr. Marshall, pleased to meet you&quot;. He was as fair as his brother
  was dark and sent me a winning smile, offering a grubby hand. &quot;Sorry I'm
  late, Dad, but we ran into a tiebreak, took more than an hour&quot;. He flopped
  down on the chair one of the girls held for him. A very tall and muscular young
  man, blond like Dan, came out with a washbasin and knelt to let him clean his
  hands. &quot;Do my feet, will you, Steve?&quot; He half turned in his chair
  and stretched his left leg. The slave put down the basin and unleashed his
  sneaker, pulled off the sweaty sock and bowed to lick his foot. &quot;So it's
  yours, the Bentley, Mr. Marshall?&quot; &quot;John, please. Yes it is&quot;. &quot;1957?&quot; &quot; '59&quot;.
  He stretched the other foot. &quot;Thanks, Steve. You can just leave them bare&quot;. &quot;Yes,
  Master Daniel&quot;. The slaveboy licked the other foot clean and left, while
  a couple of girls arrived with the first course.  
Dan talked throughout lunch, questioning me about my country and what I was
  doing over here. His father listened with a bemused smile, only occasionally
  able to put in a word, and his brother kept mostly silent. I knew that their
  mother had died a couple of years ago and that the two boys were now nineteen
  and twenty. Dan had just finished high school, but spent rather more time playing
  tennis or swimming than on his studies. Another interest of his was cars, especially
  British brands, but he had to make do with the usual four-wheeler. When told
  where I lived, his eyes sparkled. &quot;Gee, man, Marsfield Gardens! You've
  got the best private tennis courts in town and the largest pool&quot;. &quot;Is
  that so? I haven't made use of them yet, but you're welcome any time you like&quot;. &quot;Thanks,
  but they're very strict. Outsiders can't use them unless they're with one of
  the tenants&quot;. &quot;You can. I shall instruct the staff&quot;. &quot;Thanks
  again, but are you sure?&quot; &quot;I own the place, it seems, so I don't
  think you'll meet any trouble&quot;. That earned me another dazzling smile
  and his profuse thanks.  
I changed the subject to slaves and told how satisfied I was with mine, yet
  still a bit uncertain about handling them. Mr. Allen confirmed that most people
  did what I'd done so far, left day to day affairs to the slaves themselves,
  that's what they were trained for, and just expected the best of service, correcting
  them when necessary. &quot;That's what I'm most uncertain about. I don't know
  the rules&quot;. Now Harry showed an interest. &quot;There are none, or practically
  none. You're not allowed to kill them or maim them seriously, cripple them,
  but apart from that, anything goes&quot;. &quot;Really, not just a whipping?&quot; &quot;Slaves
  are not like free people, John. They don't feel pain like we do, just shrug
  off a thrashing and stay lazy, trying to cheat you. You've got to keep them
  in line all the time or they'll cut any corner they can find, so you have to
  use other methods. I can show you some, if you like&quot;. What I didn't like
  was the evil gleam in his eyes. &quot;Thank you, but how can you say that slaves
  are different. I mean, until sentenced, they were 'free people', like your
  former girlfriend&quot;. &quot;Sure, but once they've been through training
  and served for a time, they change. They think like slaves, act like slaves,
  show no responsibility, stop feeling pain&quot;. I looked dubious and noticed
  that Dan sent his brother a dark glance. &quot;Have a look at our punishment
  room, John&quot;, their father urged, &quot;Harold's right. It really is necessary
  to take a firm hand and he's very experienced. Thanks to him, we have the best
  slave herd in town. Besides, it's your responsibility that the court sentence
  is carried out. Slaves must be treated as slaves, worked hard, made to feel
  the consequences of their crimes on their body. That's the law&quot;. I nodded
  reluctantly and changed the subject again when coffee was served. After another
  hour I rose to take my leave. I'd grown to like Dan very much and renewed my
  invitation. Harry jumped up. &quot;Would you like to see the cellar?&quot; &quot;Well,
  all right, just a look&quot;. &quot;Sure&quot;. &quot;Can I have a look at
  your car in the meantime?&quot; Dan's eyes sparkled. &quot;Certainly, go ahead.
  My slaveboy, Tim, can show you, take you for a ride if you like&quot;. &quot;Gee,
  thanks, John!&quot;  
He disappeared around the corner of the house and I took leave of my host,
  while Harry yelled something through the door. We went back to the hall, where
  the tall slaveboy, Steve, came running to join us, and through a narrow door
  beneath the stairs to descend to a large room, with bare concrete floor and
  raw brick walls. The unlucky Julie sat slumped on the evil horse, moaning softly. &quot;Very
  effective, this device&quot;. Harry went up to her, pointing out her red and
  swollen cunt lips. &quot;She'll be mighty sore when I fuck her tonight, but
  it's just as effective with a boyslave and yet so simple&quot;. And it was,
  the torture bench, and the girl's tie as well. Her thumbs were lashed together,
  hands behind her back, and a short string ran from one of her big toes to the
  other across the pole she was straddling, forcing up her legs up almost horizontally
  along it. &quot;Comfy?&quot;, he mocked. &quot;No, Master Harold&quot;. &quot;Sorry
  to hear that, maybe these will help you&quot;. He fetched two lumps of lead
  from a wall cabinet and hooked them on her nipple rings. The tormented girl
  gasped and I turned away, disgusted by the casual cruelty. One of the walls
  had five doorways; four of them closed with steel grilles. I peered through
  one to see a narrow room with four bare metal shelves spaced on top of each
  other along one wall. Four smaller shelves held a few clothes and thin blankets.
  'Bleak, to say the least', I thought and suddenly realised that I didn't know
  how my own slaves slept. The fifth room was larger, but without a door. Six
  showerheads over open drains along one wall and a steel trough on the other. &quot;Shall
  we get on with it?&quot; Harry joined me. &quot;Yes, but where's the lavatory,
  I need...&quot;. He laughed. &quot;Lavatory! Right here. They piss and shit
  down the drains&quot;. &quot;Girls and boys in the same room, without any privacy!&quot; &quot;Slaves,
  John, and this is a luxury. Elsewhere they use a hole in the backyard. But
  you're no slave. Here, boy!&quot;  
Steve, who knelt in a corner, came running. &quot;Yes, Master Harold?&quot; &quot;My
  guest has to piss&quot;. &quot;Yes, Master Harold&quot;. He dropped down in
  front of me, reaching for my fly. &quot;But what are you doing?&quot; I took
  a step back. &quot;Didn't you need a lavatory? It's right in front of you&quot;. &quot;But...&quot;. &quot;But
  what? Don't you use your own slaves?&quot; &quot;Certainly not. It's gross!&quot; &quot;Not
  at all, everyone does that, even the ladies. Come on, John, piss and let's
  get on with it&quot;. The kneeling boy drew down the zipper to dig out my limp
  cock and guide it to his mouth. I looked down to see him swallow when I gave
  in and let loose a steady stream. Harry went back to the main room and the
  slave licked me clean, put back my cock and zipped up again. &quot;Sorry, Steve&quot;,
  I whispered and he shook his head with a sad smile.  
&quot;Have a look at these&quot;. Harry stood beside a frightening array
  of punishment instruments arranged on hooks on the wall. &quot;You've got the
  basic things, I guess&quot;. He pointed to a row of canes, crops, whips, a
  cat-of-nine-tails among them. &quot;Ah, yes&quot;. I had no idea. &quot;Special
  tools like these as well?&quot; He took down a small cane and a little flogger. &quot;Ah,
  well, I don't think so&quot;. &quot;Very useful. This is for their feet&quot;.
  He offered the cane for closer inspection. &quot;And this for their cocks and
  balls, or the girls' cunts or tits. Stings like hell&quot;. &quot;I see&quot;. &quot;But
  let's begin with the ordinary things. Across the horse, boy!&quot; &quot;Yes,
  Master Harold&quot;. Steve dropped his shorts to drape his naked body over
  the sawhorse in front of the riding girl, arse high. &quot;This is not a punishment,
  just a friendly lesson, no need to strap you down, but don't you dare move&quot;. &quot;No,
  Master Harold&quot;. &quot;Steve's such a big, strong boy&quot;. The cane cut
  across the already striped globes. &quot;Quarterback. Classmate of my brother,
  on a sports scholarship. Pride and joy of the old school, its girls not least&quot;.
  He sent Julie a dark glance. &quot;Yes, very popular was our Steve, but it's
  costly with all those girls and when one's dad's a construction worker with
  five kids, what do you do?&quot; He lashed down again. &quot;Good boys find
  a job, washing dishes, serving in a burger bar, but not our great footballer.
  No, Siree. Got his own little business, didn't he, selling dope?&quot; A third
  stripe appeared. &quot;But it's dangerous if someone grass on you and the cops
  find a stack of joints in your room. Earns you twenty years as a slave, no
  more football and no more blowjobs from high school sluts. Now it's our Steve
  who delivers the blowjobs, among other things. Lucky him, though, to be bought
  by his good old schoolmate's dad. So it's not too bad for poor Steve, is it?&quot; The
  cane fell again, harder, and the naked boy jumped. &quot;No, Master Harold&quot;,
  he hissed between clenched teeth. I felt my cock stirring.  
&quot;OK, you know how to cane them, I guess, but one may add some extra
  spice. The arse is fine, but they get used to it as I said. So try down here&quot;.
  The cane hit precisely where buttocks and thighs meet and Steve jumped again. &quot;Keep
  still, big boy. It hurts, as you can see, much more than on the meatier part&quot;.
  He hit the same spot twice again. &quot;But it's even better in a more interesting
  place. Spread your legs and open up!&quot; Steve reached back to display his
  arsecrack. The cane swished down and he yelped. &quot;Very effective, especially
  with a bit of practise. The hole is the most sensitive place&quot;. This time
  the tip of the cane buried itself in the prominent arsehole and Steve yelped
  again. My cock twisted, straining against the fabric of my trousers. &quot;Try
  it when you've just fucked their dung hole. Hang them upside down, best from
  their big toes, it makes it easier to take aim, and they can't hold their arses
  open for long, especially not the girls&quot;. He changed to the little flogger
  and aimed at the boy's exposed balls. &quot;Very effective if you hit them
  there too, or on their cunts. OK, feet!&quot; &quot;Yes, Master Harold&quot;.
  The boy scurried away to lie down on a low bench and place his ankles against
  a raised bar at one end. &quot;If you don't have a foot bench already, I suggest
  that you get one as soon as possible. Excellent device. Keep still!&quot; Harry
  flicked his wrist and the small cane hit the boy's left instep. &quot;You'll
  need some practice, but even if their soles are hardened after running barefoot
  for years, it does hurt, a lot&quot;. The cane hit the other foot. &quot;Right,
  boy?&quot; &quot;Yes, Master Harold&quot;, Steve hissed.  
&quot;Well, thanks, but I really have to leave now&quot;. It was becoming
  more and more uncomfortable inside my trousers and I was angry with myself
  for responding to the casual torture of a totally innocent boy. &quot;Not until
  you've had a look at the special equipment&quot;. Harry indicated three sets
  of chains and shackles hanging from the ceiling. &quot;You've seen how the
  horse works. Stretch them well in those, with weights on their rings and clamps
  on their dicks or clits, and let them hang there for a night or two, that'll
  keep them on their toes&quot;. He laughed at his nasty joke. &quot;A night
  in a strict hogtie on the floor instead of a good sleep in their soft beds

  is fine too, but this is even better. Over here, boy!&quot; He went to a small
  iron cage in a corner and Steve jumped to sit down in front of it, his back
  to the open door. Harry took a set of steel chains and clipped one end to the
  slave's collar, then drew down his head to fasten a set of cuffs around his
  sturdy ankles. The boy rolled on his knees to allow the chain to be dragged
  up his back, where his wrists were locked into another set of cuffs. &quot;In
  you go&quot;. Steve winced when backing his painfully bent body into the cramped
  space. The door was closed and his tormentor grabbed an iron bar. &quot;And
  now the icing&quot;. The bar was forced under the slave's bent knees and hooked
  to the sides of the cage, leaving him half suspended. &quot;An hour like this,
  and they're in tears. Two hours make them scream. After three, they usually
  pass out&quot;. I shook my head in disgust and hastily took my leave. The last
  I heard was Harry sneering: &quot;Now let's get you down, cunt. I'll fuck you
  bent over your old bedmate's cosy little cage&quot;.  
I was shaking with suppressed rage, partly because I couldn't deny that I'd
  enjoyed watching the slaveboy writhing in torment, and had to take a strong
  grip of myself. Dan and Tim were studying the engine of my car. &quot;Gee,
  John! It must be fantastic to drive. I almost envy your slave&quot;. &quot;Hardly.
  I can't imagine you enjoying a visit to that cellar, at least not as a slave&quot;.
  His smile faded. &quot;No, and I rarely go there&quot;. &quot;Unlike your brother&quot;.
  He looked away. &quot;I don't share his ideas about punishment, but Dad...&quot;. &quot;You
  don't punish the slaves?&quot; &quot;With a paddle, if they deserve it, or
  a cane if it's real bad, but there's no need to torture them&quot;. &quot;So
  you don't mind spanking your former classmate?&quot; His eyes flashed angrily. &quot;Of
  course I do! I try to be kind, but he's a slave and slaves are punished if
  they do something wrong. That's how it is and we have to accept it&quot;. &quot;Sorry&quot;. &quot;It's
  OK&quot;. He smiled thinly and changed the subject. &quot;Can I come over sometime
  tomorrow to try out your court?&quot; &quot;You'll be more than welcome. I
  could use a game too&quot;. &quot;That's a deal. Around ten?&quot; &quot;And
  stay for lunch&quot;. &quot;Thanks, I'd like that very much&quot;. Tim jumped
  up from his knees to open the door for me. &quot;Good slaveboy you've got there.
  I know him a bit, used to work at the garage servicing my car&quot;. He grinned. &quot;Somewhat
  more hard-working now&quot;. &quot;So, why do you say that?&quot; &quot;He'd
  borrowed a hose from our slaves and washed the car, was polishing it when I
  came by. You know how to keep them on their toes. Usually they grab the opportunity
  to relax while waiting for their master&quot;. &quot;I didn't ask him to do
  that and I don't have to keep my slaves on their toes. They manage very well
  without any encouragement&quot;.  
Back home I went straight to the kitchen. Christine looked up, alarmed, from
  the dough she was kneading and sank to the floor on her knees. &quot;Please
  rise and don't be so scared. I've repeatedly told you how satisfied I am with
  your work&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. She got up to stand rigidly with her
  hands clasped behind her back and eyes lowered. &quot;But it suddenly occurred
  to me that I don't know where you sleep&quot;. &quot;In here, Sir&quot;. She
  opened a door to what I thought was a cupboard, and in a way it was. A narrow,
  windowless room, devoid of furniture, with a showerhead in the ceiling at one
  end and an open drain beneath it. I stared. &quot;In here?&quot; &quot;Yes,
  Sir&quot;. &quot;You sleep in here?&quot; &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. &quot;On the
  floor?&quot; &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. &quot;All three of you together. Naked,
  without a mattress, or even a blanket?&quot; &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. &quot;And
  you wash under that?&quot; I indicated the rusty showerhead. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. &quot;And
  where do you, eh, do your things?&quot; &quot;In here, Sir&quot;. She kept
  her eyes to the floor. &quot;In here, where you sleep!&quot; &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. &quot;But
  it...&quot;. I shook my head in disgust, unable to mutter anything but: &quot;What
  an animal I am!&quot; &quot;Please, Sir. No, Sir. It's fine, Sir&quot;. &quot;It
  is not fine and where do you eat or spend your spare time?&quot; &quot;We eat
  here in the kitchen, Sir&quot;. &quot;But there's no table, or chairs&quot;.
  Fred must have heard us, because he entered and sank to his knees. &quot;Would
  you want a cup of tea, Sir?&quot; &quot;And a talk with you when I've changed&quot;. &quot;Yes,
  Sir&quot;. He remained on his knees while I stomped out, furious with myself.  
Tim sensed my dark mood and for once wasn't his usual cheerful self when
  licking and rubbing my feet carefully. &quot;Why did you wash the car. You
  did that yesterday and it hasn't rained since then?&quot; He didn't raise his
  head. &quot;I, eh, I'd nothing else to do, Sir&quot;. &quot;Why not have a
  rest then?&quot; &quot;Slaves don't dawdle, Sir&quot;. I shook my head, but
  didn't say anything else while he helped me into my jeans and T-shirt. His
  fellow slave was arranging my tea and a fresh apple pie in the garden when
  I came out. &quot;Fred can serve me&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. Tim disappeared
  inside, obviously relieved. &quot;Fetch a cup for yourself&quot;. Fred hesitated, &quot;Yes,
  Sir&quot;, and rose to come back with a mug. &quot;Have a piece of pie&quot;. &quot;Thank
  you, Sir&quot;. He knelt to serve me and pour for himself. &quot;Sit, on the
  floor, if you must&quot;. &quot;Thank you, Sir&quot;. He turned to draw his
  bare feet up beside him. I sipped the tea and munched my cake. &quot;Don't
  you like Christine's cooking?&quot; &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. He cut a small piece
  and seemed to savour it. &quot;Good, isn't it?&quot; &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. &quot;At
  least you eat well&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. He avoided my eyes. &quot;The
  filet mignon last night was exceptional&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. &quot;Was
  there enough for Tim? I suppose he eats like a horse, or at least a teenage
  boy&quot;. At last he raised his head. &quot;Please, Sir, I'm sorry. I didn't
  know&quot;. &quot;Knew what?&quot; &quot;That you allow us, eh, eating the
  same as you, Sir&quot;. &quot;Allow? But what do you eat then?&quot; &quot;Slave
  food, Sir&quot;. &quot;Slave...What's that?&quot; &quot;Porridge, Sir, very
  rich in proteins and vitamins&quot;. &quot;That's all you get?&quot; &quot;Yes,
  Sir. All slaves...&quot;. &quot;Three times a day?&quot; &quot;Twice, Sir.
  We have some of yesterday's bread for breakfast, Sir. It's too good to go to
  waste&quot;.  
I stared, blushing with shame. &quot;And you sleep on the floor in that horrible
  little room, stinking of your own shit&quot;. &quot;It's not...&quot;. &quot;And
  you work all the time, never take a break&quot;. &quot;Sir, we, you haven't...&quot;. &quot;Why
  haven't you told me about this?&quot; &quot;I'm sorry, Sir, but I thought...&quot;. &quot;That
  I'm a monster&quot;. At last his reserves broke and he looked gravely at me. &quot;No,
  Sir. You are no monster, but a very kind and gentle master&quot;. &quot;What
  you've had to endure is monstrous!&quot; &quot;With respect, Sir, it's ordinary
  living conditions for slaves, better than some&quot;. I looked away. &quot;Perhaps,
  I don't know much about it, but I'd never allowed it if I'd known&quot;. &quot;I'm
  sorry, Sir&quot;. &quot;Don't be. I neglected you, not the other way around,
  but at least I haven't deliberately abused you&quot;. &quot;No, Sir&quot;. &quot;But
  I can't go on with this&quot;. &quot;Sir?&quot; He suddenly looked alarmed. &quot;I
  can't keep slaves. I've seen how some people treat theirs and I don't want
  to lower myself to their level&quot;. &quot;No, Sir&quot;. He swallowed hard. &quot;You'll
  sell us, Sir?&quot; &quot;Have to, if only to preserve my self respect&quot;. &quot;Because
  you think you treat us badly, Sir?&quot; &quot;Not think, know&quot;. &quot;But,
  Sir, you don't. You're a good master, we're very happy here, Sir&quot;.  
&quot;It doesn't trouble you to be slave of a young man just a couple of
  years older than you?&quot; &quot;No, Sir. It did trouble me to be enslaved,
  but this is my life now, for the next fourteen years&quot;. &quot;So what are
  you trying to tell me?&quot; He looked me frankly in the eyes. &quot;That I've
  come to terms with my new life, Sir. I'm determined to make the best of it,
  serve my master well, be a good slave. It'll be hard years, but a slave's life
  is always hard, sometimes very hard. Even so, there's an end to it. One day
  he'll be free. That's what he hopes for and dreams about in his misery. But
  that hope can be shattered, if he's treated so badly that he's reduced to nothing,
  unable to cope on his own, when the day comes. I don't have to fear that now,
  Sir&quot;. &quot;Only if I sell you&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. &quot;So if
  I do, I'm really behaving like a monster&quot;. He didn't answer, just looked
  gravely at me.  
&quot;So be it then. I can't keep you&quot;. &quot;Why not, Sir&quot;. He
  looked questioningly at me. &quot;If I do, I'll one day give in to my darkest
  desires and abuse you&quot;. &quot;Abuse how, Sir?&quot; &quot;Whip you, tie
  you up, rape you&quot;. &quot;But that's not abuse, Sir&quot;. &quot;What is,
  then?&quot; &quot;Sir. We are your slaves. It's our duty to serve you to the
  best of our ability&quot;. &quot;And you do&quot;, I interrupted. &quot;Thank
  you, Sir, but whatever we do, we're bound to make mistakes, annoy our master
  and earn a punishment&quot;. &quot;Be abused&quot;. &quot;No, Sir. A fair and
  deserved punishment is not abuse. How else can a master express his dissatisfaction?
  By what other means can a slave redeem his faults?&quot; &quot;Don't tell me
  that you enjoy being whipped&quot;. &quot;I don't, Sir&quot;. &quot;And if
  it's not a 'fair and deserved punishment', but your master having 'fun' with
  you?&quot; &quot;A slave's duty, Sir&quot;. &quot;To be tied up and whipped,
  raped up his or her arse?&quot; &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. &quot;How do you define
  'abuse', then?&quot; &quot;If a master treats his slaves like animals, or worse
  than animals, and I don't believe that you'd ever do that, Sir. Punish us,
  yes. Use us for your pleasure, yes. Make us work hard, yes, but never degrade
  yourself by abusing us, Sir&quot;. &quot;I don't think I can see any difference&quot;. &quot;With
  respect, Sir, I believe you can&quot;. &quot;So you prefer the devil you know&quot;. &quot;We
  know no devil, Sir. We only know that we have a good master&quot;. I stared
  at him, then looked away, contemplating his words.  
&quot;Very well, then. I'll keep you; not that it's any great sacrifice.
  I've never been served as well as during these last weeks&quot;. &quot;Thank
  you, Sir&quot;. His face lit up in a smile. &quot;From now on you'll report
  to me if one of you warrants a punishment and suggest something fitting the
  crime&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. &quot;You don't seem dismayed?&quot; &quot;No,
  Sir. I, we won't like the punishments, but they're necessary in a master/slave
  relationship&quot;. &quot;Why?&quot; He looked apologetically at me. &quot;A
  slave is troubled if not punished for his faults, Sir&quot;. &quot;Relieved
  rather&quot;. &quot;Yes and no, Sir. Relieved to be spared immediate pain,
  but afraid that his master one day will be so angry that the punishment will
  be much worse. For us it's much better to have the slate wiped clean at once,
  Sir&quot;. &quot;Another neglect of mine&quot;. He didn't answer. &quot;Do
  we have any whips and such?&quot; &quot;Yes, Sir. A riding crop, two suede
  floggers, one of them for genitalia, a foot crop, some canes&quot;. &quot;Where?&quot; &quot;In
  the kitchen, Sir. Some nipple weights and genitalia clamps as well and a portable
  set of stocks. Ropes and chains too, Sir. And there's a well equipped punishment
  room in the cellar, for the convenience of tenants&quot;. &quot;Well equipped,
  how?&quot; &quot;Shackles for suspension, stocks, punishment cages, Sir&quot;. &quot;And
  it's being used?&quot; &quot;The present tenants keep 84 slaves all in all,
  so at least some of them will be due for a heavier punishment most days, Sir.
  There's also a storeroom with sleeping cages for up to 60 slaves&quot;. &quot;People
  keep their slaves there?&quot; &quot;Some tenants do, Sir. The cages have remote
  controlled time locks to release the slaves without inconveniencing their masters
  or mistresses, Sir&quot;. &quot;Others sleep in slaverooms like mine?&quot; &quot;Yes,
  Sir&quot;. &quot;Perhaps it's about time that I had a look at that cellar&quot;.  
Part 3  
The storeroom was exactly that. Bare concrete walls and floor, sixty cages
  piled three on top of each other in a row along one wall, only just big enough
  for a human being to lie down on a thin vinyl mattress. Along the other wall
  were the usual showerheads over open drains. Three bare bulbs in the ceiling
  spread a feeble light in the windowless room. Without any ventilation, the
  air was stifling hot and putrid with the stench of sweat, human waste and cheap
  disinfectant. &quot;Good Lord!&quot;, I mumbled, shocked, &quot;This is even
  worse than that horrible room upstairs&quot;. Fred didn't answer. &quot;But
  not uncommon, I suppose?&quot; &quot;No, Sir&quot;. Shuddering with disgust
  I left hastily. In contrast, the punishment room was bright and airy, though
  not exactly cosy. Tiled floor and walls, fluorescent lightning and air conditioning.
  Rows of punishment instruments were hanging neatly on the wall and six sets
  of shackles from the ceiling. Three tiny cages, of the same type I'd already
  seen at the Allens' house, were lined up on the floor beside three sets of
  elaborate stocks, in which a victim could be restrained in numerous positions.
  To my surprise, the room was in use. A young woman was vigorously paddling
  the bare arse of a teenage boy, bent over and locked into one of the sets of
  stocks. &quot;Twelve, thank you, Miss&quot;, he gasped, when yet another stroke
  made his flaming red buttocks dance.  
She stopped the next in mid-air and turned when she heard us entering. &quot;Hullo
  there, you must be our mysterious landlord. I'm Jane Thompson&quot;. Her face
  lit up in an enchanting smile and she offered a well-manicured hand. &quot;John
  Marshall, pleased to meet you, but why mysterious?&quot; &quot;Well, maybe
  that's exaggerating it a bit, but we haven't seen much of you yet&quot;. &quot;Just
  moved in&quot;. &quot;Argh, two weeks ago! Why haven't you joined one of our
  little get-togethers on Friday?&quot; I'd seen people down at a barbecue area
  in the grounds, but thought it to be a private party. &quot;Thank you, I'll
  be happy to&quot;. &quot;Fine. You're here to study, aren't you? Most of us
  are at Uni too&quot;. &quot;Yes, I've planned a thesis on French/American relations
  after 1945&quot;. &quot;Sounds interesting. I'm in art history myself, but
  I can see that you come well prepared&quot;. &quot;What makes you think so?&quot; &quot;You've
  bought Fred, haven't you. Brightest undergrad head in the politics department
  until he got himself enslaved&quot;. She nodded at the slave, who knelt quietly
  just inside the door. &quot;Shame, really, great guy, everybody liked him&quot;.
  She grinned. &quot;As a matter of fact I dated him for a while about a year
  ago, best pussy licker I've ever come across. Perhaps I could borrow him for
  the night once in a while?&quot; &quot;Eh, I...&quot;. She laughed, blushing. &quot;Just
  joking, or at least only half serious, he really is good, but I suppose you're
  going to work him hard seeking stuff for your study. He sure knows his way
  around the library and plays the databases like a pro&quot;. &quot;Well, yes,
  I... I'm very satisfied with him&quot;. &quot;Don't doubt it. Fred always does
  everything better than anyone else, no matter what it is, but of course even
  he can make mistakes&quot;. &quot;None that I've noticed so far&quot;. &quot;Oh!
  I thought you brought him down here for a whipping&quot;. &quot;No, I'm just
  looking the place over&quot;. &quot;Pity, I've always dreamt about watching
  one of my lovers writhing in the chains&quot;. She chuckled. &quot;Just joking
  again, of course&quot;. &quot;Of course. Well, nice meeting you, Jane&quot;. &quot;My
  pleasure, and do come down next Friday, will you? Or how about joining me and
  my neighbour for a drink? Third floor&quot;. She smiled again and added hastily. &quot;He's
  my present boyfriend&quot;. &quot;Thank you, I'd like to. I know very few people
  in this town&quot;. &quot;Tonight at seven?&quot; &quot;Yes, please, but perhaps
  you'd want to see the penthouse?&quot; &quot;Love to, thanks, we'll be there.
  Charlie's in politics too. I'm always attracted to those serious guys. Actually
  he replaced Fred in my bed&quot;. &quot;What about dinner then? I'd very much
  like to know more about the department and my fellow students&quot;. &quot;An
  offer one can't refuse, thanks&quot;. We shook hands again and she turned to
  the boy in the stocks. &quot;Where were we, Toby?&quot; &quot;Twelve, Miss
  Jane&quot;, he moaned. &quot;OK, last three&quot;. The paddle fell with a resounding
  smack.  
Back in the roof garden Fred sank to his knees beside my chair. &quot;You
  can let Tim serve tonight, and keep out of sight. I see no reason to humiliate
  you&quot;. &quot;As you wish, Sir, but I won't be humiliated&quot;. &quot;Serving
  your former girlfriend and your rival?&quot; &quot;A slave cannot be humiliated,
  Sir, and it was bound to happen anyway. In a small town like this a slave cannot
  avoid meeting some of his former friends&quot;. &quot;Perhaps not. Very well,
  do as you like&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir. May I leave for a moment to tell Chris
  about dinner?&quot; I waved my hand and he left silently, only to be replaced
  by Tim. &quot;Want a cup of tea?&quot; His grin was back. &quot;Thanks, Sir&quot;. &quot;Or
  something else?&quot; &quot;A coke, if I may, Sir&quot;. &quot;Sure&quot;. &quot;Thanks
  a lot, Sir&quot;. He disappeared for a moment to come back with a plastic bottle
  and kneel again. &quot;Sit&quot;. &quot;Thanks, Sir&quot;. &quot;Fred just
  met one of his old friends, how about you?&quot; &quot;Sir?&quot; &quot;Have
  you met someone you used to know?&quot; &quot;Yeah, Sir, seen 'em around&quot;.
  He grinned hugely. &quot;Fucking envious, they look, Sir. Me driving that fantastic
  car&quot;. &quot;Hardly envying your present position&quot;. &quot;Nah, maybe
  not, but that's how it is, Sir. I'm not the only one of the old gang who's
  a slave now. That's what happens to guys like us, always get in trouble&quot;. &quot;Miss
  them, your mates?&quot; &quot;Yeah&quot;. He sighed. &quot;Take a break, then,
  when waiting for me by the car and have a talk with your friends if you see
  them around&quot;. &quot;Gee, Sir, thanks a lot! You're just about...&quot;. &quot;Tim!&quot; I
  hadn't heard Fred's soft footsteps. &quot;Oops, sorry, Sir&quot;. &quot;What
  were you about to say?&quot; &quot;Only that you're just about the best master
  I ever heard of, Sir. Excuse me, Sir. Sir&quot;. &quot;Thank you&quot;. I smiled
  evilly. &quot;I expect you to change your mind when I tie you up tonight, whip
  your arse and fuck it&quot;. &quot;No, Sir&quot;. &quot;You like being whipped
  and arsefucked?&quot; &quot;Nah, Sir, not supposed to, am I, being slave, but
  that won't make me change me mind, Sir&quot;. &quot;We'll see about that&quot;.
  I waved him away and told Fred to take his place.  
&quot;You heard that. I'll have sex with you from now on&quot;. &quot;Yes,
  Sir&quot;. &quot;You and Tim that is&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir. You won't want
  Chris?&quot; &quot;Perhaps later, but not while she's still new to this and
  scared out of her wits&quot;. &quot;No, Sir&quot;. He looked up. &quot;Tim's
  right, Sir&quot;. &quot;Perhaps. How far had you come with your studies?&quot; &quot;To
  my graduation thesis, Sir&quot;. &quot;What subject?&quot; &quot;Nearly the
  same as yours, Sir. Only it was Germany, not France, and limited to the 1960'es&quot;. &quot;Really!
  Jane was right then. You can help me searching for sources and literature?&quot; &quot;I'll
  do my best, Sir&quot;. &quot;And slaves are allowed to use the library?&quot; &quot;To
  serve their masters, yes, Sir&quot;. &quot;Good. I'll probably use you for
  sparring. Two clever heads are better than one&quot;. &quot;Thank you, Sir&quot;.  
&quot;Back to the present. As of today, Christine will have to work harder&quot;. &quot;Yes,
  Sir. I'm sorry...&quot;. &quot;Making breakfast, lunch and dinner for four&quot;. &quot;Yes,
  Sir&quot;. &quot;Perhaps not the same for all, but proper meals for you and
  something you like&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir. Thank you very much, Sir&quot;. &quot;Slaves
  can have all the tea, coffee and soft drinks they need&quot;. &quot;Thank you,
  Sir&quot;. &quot;Slaves will from now on have time to relax. The two of you
  not serving me can spend their evenings as they wish&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir.
  Thank you, Sir&quot;. &quot;For what?&quot; &quot;Your kindness, Sir&quot;. &quot;So
  you're looking forward to free evenings in your cosy room?&quot; &quot;If you
  allow us, we could stay in the kitchen, Sir&quot;. &quot;I don't&quot;. &quot;No,
  Sir&quot;. &quot;Come here&quot;. I got up and went to one of the spare rooms. &quot;Store
  that double bed somewhere. Buy three singles, with good mattresses, sheets,
  blankets, pillows, perhaps screens to allow you a bit of privacy. Leave the
  rest of the furniture&quot;. Fred stared around the pleasant room, the thick
  carpet, the two armchairs, the desk, the TV. &quot;Yes, Sir. I...Yes, Sir&quot;,
  he stammered. &quot;Move in here at once. You boys can sleep on the floor tonight&quot;. &quot;Yes,
  Sir&quot;. &quot;And stop chaining yourself up at night&quot;. The adjoining
  bathroom was simple, with just a shower cubicle, lavatory and wash basin, but
  a paradise compared to what they had now and to what I'd seen in the cellar. &quot;Buy
  some better clothes. Jeans for the three of you, a couple of skirts, short
  and long, for Christine, sneakers&quot;. &quot;Slaves are not allowed footwear,
  Sir&quot;. &quot;If I order it?&quot; &quot;That's the law, Sir, to mark us
  as slaves&quot;. &quot;Very well, then, but a table and chairs for the kitchen&quot;. &quot;Yes,
  Sir&quot;.  
The evening turned out very pleasant. I was in the sitting room, when my
  guests arrived, and heard a deep, masculine voice from the hall. &quot;Hi,
  Fred. Good to see you, how's things?&quot; &quot;Fine, Sir&quot;. &quot;Not
  too bad, you mean. Bloody shame it is&quot;. &quot;This way please, Sir, and
  Miss Jane&quot;. &quot;Hello, Fred&quot;. I thought to hear a soft kiss. &quot;Sorry
  about the teasing. Forget about it, will you?&quot; &quot;Yes, Miss Jane&quot;.
  Charlie was almost the exact opposite of Fred. At least a head taller, dark
  hair, broad shoulders and chest, and a hand like a shovel. Jane caught me looking
  from her petite, slender frame to Fred and then Charlie. She laughed. &quot;Wondering
  about my change of taste, are you? Sometimes I do so myself. Fred was the perfect
  roommate, tidy and careful. I couldn't share with Charlie, even for one day.
  You can't imagine the mess that man can create within two minutes. Luckily
  he got the flat beside mine&quot;. &quot;So Fred and you have been living together?&quot; &quot;For
  about seven blissful months until we grew apart and parted, amiably. We're
  still friends, aren't we, Fred?&quot; &quot;If it may please you, Miss Jane&quot;.
  I ushered my guests to the roof garden and he brought a tray of drinks. &quot;Chablis,
  Miss Jane?&quot; &quot;Perfect&quot;. Charlie had a beer and I my usual vodka
  martini. They'd brought the slaveboy, I'd seen punished in the cellar, with
  them. He was stark naked and his ankles were hobbled with a short chain. Jane
  saw me looking at him kneeling beside her, head bowed and hands clasped behind
  his back. &quot;Couldn't leave him and I don't like locking them up in the
  cages&quot;, she explained, &quot;Can't keep his hands, not to mention other
  parts of his body off my slavegirl&quot;. &quot;Was that why you spanked him?&quot; &quot;No,
  that was because he dropped a plate when washing up. I don't deny them a bit
  of petting, not much fun in their lives, but he's not allowed fucking her and
  I don't trust him not to get carried away. Normally I keep her locked, but
  she has her period and it's such a bother when she comes running to be unlocked
  all the time&quot;. &quot;Locked?&quot; &quot;She has rings in her labia lips,
  easy to padlock&quot;. &quot;Really! Is that common? And allowed?&quot; &quot;Allowed,
  yes. Piercing is not mutilation, the holes heal up if the rings are removed.
  Common? I don't know, but it's for her sake and I don't think she minds at
  all&quot;. &quot;No, I meant, slaves allowed to, eh...&quot;. &quot;To have
  sex with each other. No, I don't think many masters allow that, rather the
  opposite, but don't understand why. A happy slave is a better slave&quot;.  
&quot;Sorry about all these questions, but I'm new to this&quot;. &quot;Ask
  all you want, but Charlie and I are not very typical slaveowners. Both of us
  were brought up in homes where slaves are treated decently&quot;. &quot;But
  you do punish them?&quot; &quot;Of course, if they deserve it. What else can
  you do if not satisfied? Besides, some slaves need it&quot;. She glanced at
  the naked boy. &quot;Some are perfect, willing and careful, others try cutting
  corners or get sloppy if not kept on their toes. If their master's not a sadistic
  bastard, it's mostly their own fault if they're punished. Toby here gets his
  arse warmed or his back striped frequently, but I don't think I've punished
  my girl for, oh, I don't know, more than a month&quot;. &quot;Me neither&quot;,
  Charlie added, &quot;It's bad enough for them as it is, no need to humiliate
  them further by spanking them like naughty children. If my boy needs a reminder,
  I tie him up painfully or lock him in a cage, but very rarely&quot;. &quot;But
  you do keep slaves?&quot; &quot;Of course and I won't deny that I enjoy it.
  There's nothing wrong with the system as such, it's better for them to be out
  working among other people than locked up in a prison, especially the teenagers,
  and many of them do need to be put back on the right track. But two things
  are wrong, very wrong. One, that there's no control of slaveowners. They should
  be vetted before being allowed to keep slaves and their slaves inspected frequently
  to ensure that they're not abused. Two, that it's mostly girls and boys from
  poor families, who're sentenced to slavery for petty offences&quot;. &quot;So
  the judges are unfair?&quot; &quot;I can't prove it, but it seems so to me.
  Not when it's real crimes, shoplifting, drug dealing or things like that, but
  when rich youngsters generally make a nuisance of themselves, are drunk and
  disorderly, vandalise public property, they're let go with a warning. Poorer
  kids get five years as slaves&quot;.  
Fred came out to announce that dinner was ready. I'd grown used to Christine's
  perfect meals, but my guests marvelled over the lobster souffl&eacute;, asked
  if I'd hired a professional cook for the occasion and was surprised when I
  called for the teenage slavegirl. She stood blushing, while they praised her
  skills, not so much because of that, I thought, rather under Charlie's admiring
  scrutiny of her half naked body. &quot;Delicious!&quot; He grinned to me and
  Jane slapped his arm. &quot;Not for you, darling!&quot; &quot;What! No more
  food for a poor hungry guy?&quot; &quot;You know what I mean!&quot; I dismissed
  Christine and Tim came out to serve the roast duck. Now it was my lady guest,
  who had trouble averting her eyes from the magnificent black body. I'd ordered
  Fred to put on a T-shirt, but Tim was in shorts only. &quot;Uh, huh!&quot; Charlie
  shook his head sadly.  
When cheese was served, Jane looked down at her slaveboy. &quot;Could Toby
  have a bowl of slave chow? I forgot to feed him&quot;. &quot;No he can't. Slaves
  don't eat chow here, and that reminds me&quot;. I turned to the slave behind
  my chair. &quot;You may leave for your own dinner, Fred. Tim can manage&quot;.
  He'd stayed with us throughout the meal, supervising the younger slave and
  serving the wines. &quot;Thank you, Sir&quot;. &quot;What'll you have?&quot; &quot;Vegetable
  soup and lamb stew, Sir&quot;. &quot;Can you allow your slave that, Jane?&quot; &quot;Well,
  I don't know if he deserves it, but OK. Run off, Toby&quot;. &quot;Yes, Miss
  Jane. Thanks, Miss&quot;. He kissed her shoes and followed Fred inside. &quot;A
  happy slave is a better slave&quot;, I reminded my guest. &quot;As I just said,
  yes. Perhaps I should try feeding them better, never really thought about it.
  Everybody gives their slaves chow, it's easier, and good for them&quot;. &quot;For
  their health, but so boring. You're right there, John, why deny them decent
  food?&quot;, Charlie added. When we rose for coffee, he asked if I could allow
  Fred to join us, to let him pick his brain, and I readily agreed. That gave
  me the first opportunity to spend time with my slave on almost equal terms
  and I decided that it wouldn't be the last. He was on the floor, we in easy
  chairs by the poolside, had his coffee in a mug, not cups like us, but nevertheless
  managed to partake in our conversation as an equal, yet unfailingly polite,
  never overstepping the line between slave and free persons. The three of them
  told me about town and university, teachers and students, and Charlie, Fred
  and I discussed mutual subjects. It was puzzling how they could act so freely,
  friends once, lovers even, and now slave and free, but it didn't seem to bother
  them. 'Decent people can handle slavery without degrading neither themselves
  nor the unlucky', I thought.  
It was late when we parted. I'd dismissed Christine and Tim to enjoy their
  first free evening since they became slaves and Toby was curled up at his mistress'
  feet, half asleep. &quot;A very pleasant evening&quot;. Fred had hurriedly
  cleared away while I saw my guests out. &quot;Can I bring you anything, Sir?&quot; &quot;No,
  I think I'll go to bed&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir. Shall I call Tim?&quot; &quot;No,
  let him sleep&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. He followed me to the bedroom to
  help me undress and was a few moments later on his knees in front of my chair,
  licking and rubbing my feet. Finished, he looked up. &quot;Would you want me
  to suck you off, Sir?&quot; I hesitated, uncertain if this was how I wished
  to end the day. &quot;No, I think I'll like to try fucking you&quot;. &quot;Yes,
  Sir. How do you want me?&quot; He rose to drag off his shirt and shorts. &quot;You
  were trained for this, show me how good you are&quot;. I opened my legs. &quot;Yes,
  Sir&quot;. Back on his knees he let his tongue slide slowly from the top of
  my left foot, up the shin and along the inside of my thigh to reach my ballsack.
  The hot tongue touched it only briefly before it went down the other leg to
  end up on my right foot. &quot;May I raise your legs, Sir?&quot; &quot;Go ahead&quot;.
  He grabbed my ankles, placed my heels on the edge of the chair and bent over
  my crotch. Now the sack was washed thoroughly, the nuts sucked into his mouth
  one by one and massaged gently by an adept tongue. My cock stood up, stiff
  and pulsating, waving in his face, but was ignored when he traced his way down
  the sensitive area below the sack to reach my arsehole. I jumped with surprise.
  No one had ever touched me there, at least not since I was a small kid. He
  licked around the puckered hole and suddenly stabbed into it. That almost brought
  me over the edge. My cock twitched and I felt the juices rising, but he knew
  what he was doing, raised his head abruptly, swallowed me and closed his lips
  around the base of my cock, preventing the imminent explosion. &quot;God!&quot;,
  I moaned. &quot;Please, Sir&quot;. He rose and dragged me with him, turned
  to kneel on the edge of the bed and reached back to open his arse. The brown
  hole winked at me and I didn't hesitate to bury my throbbing piece of meat
  in it. &quot;God!&quot;, I moaned again. Only once had I felt something remotely
  similar, when a half drunken girl had challenged me to try her arse. That had
  hardly been a pleasure, it hurt, both of us. This was heaven, so hot and narrow,
  yet smooth like a young girl's breasts. I pumped, slowly, trying to prolong
  the pleasure and felt his muscles contracting around me. Another thrust and
  I had to give in, buried myself to the hilt and with a shout of joy spurted
  deeply into his bowels, again and again and again. There seemed no end to my
  juices, never had I come as much, as long and as hard when I at last collapsed
  on his back, barely conscious.  
He stayed motionless while I lay panting, slowly regaining my breath. After
  what seemed like hours, I was finally able to rise on trembling legs, extricating
  my spent tool with a soft plop. A steady stream of sperm and arsejuices ran
  down the inside of his thighs, but was ignored when he quickly rose and turned
  to steady me, gently lowering my body to the bed, then knelt to lick and suck
  my soiled cock clean. I protested feebly and he left for a moment, only to
  come back with a glass of cool wine, offering it on his knees. &quot;That was
  fantastic!&quot; &quot;Thank you, Sir&quot;. I sat up and he arranged the pillows
  behind my back. &quot;But you're not gay! You can't be if you've been living
  with that chick?&quot; &quot;I'm your slave, Sir, here to serve and please
  you&quot;. &quot;As you most certainly do, but if not gay, where did you learn
  how to please a man?&quot; &quot;At slave training, Sir. We were taught how
  to serve our future masters or mistresses in every conceivable way&quot;. I
  took a sip of my wine and thrust the glass at him. &quot;Have a taste&quot;. &quot;Thank
  you, Sir&quot;. &quot;You practised on each other?&quot; &quot;Yes, Sir&quot; &quot;On
  girls too?&quot; &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. He'd hardly touched the wine, when offering
  it to me again. &quot;So Christine has been trained as well, very thoroughly
  in fact&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. &quot;You were in training together?&quot; &quot;Yes,
  Sir&quot;. &quot;Have you, eh, had her?&quot; He looked calmly at me. &quot;I've
  assisted in preparing Chris for her duties as a slavegirl, Sir&quot;. &quot;Fucked
  her, you mean?&quot; &quot;We've practised vaginal and rectal penetration together,
  Sir&quot;. &quot;Was it good?&quot; &quot;It was...clinical, Sir. Fifty female
  and fifty male slaves on a row of mattresses performing different sexual acts
  together under the supervision and guidance of experienced prostitutes, changing
  partners after each act&quot;. &quot;Male/female, female/female and male/male
  sex?&quot; &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. &quot;Advanced too. Bondage and such?&quot; &quot;Yes,
  Sir&quot;. &quot;So Christine were fucked by several boys there and had sex
  with other girls&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. &quot;I do wonder why she's so
  shy then&quot;. &quot;It was very stressful for the slavegirls, Sir&quot;. &quot;Of
  course, yes, it must have been. What a stupid way to train a girl, scaring
  her off the pleasures of sex, for life perhaps&quot;. &quot;A slave pleases
  her master, not herself, Sir&quot;. &quot;Of course, but how can a frightened
  girl offer any pleasure?&quot; &quot;Not all masters are as considerate as
  you, Sir&quot;. 'True, and I've met more than one of them', I thought. &quot;But
  you were not scared&quot;. &quot;I'm a grown man, Sir&quot;. &quot;And Tim?&quot; &quot;Sir?&quot; &quot;He's
  two years younger than Christine&quot;. &quot;It would take a lot more to scare
  Tim, Sir. He's been living on the streets since he was fifteen, practically
  banned from home by his mother's new boyfriend&quot;. &quot;Really? But he
  was apprenticed to a mechanic?&quot; &quot;Tim's determined to have a good
  life, Sir&quot;. &quot;Not much hope for that after twelve years as a slave&quot;. &quot;Perhaps
  not, Sir, but he'll only be about thirty, when he's free again, and a slave
  can learn a lot, if he has a good master&quot;. &quot;Like me?&quot; &quot;Yes,
  Sir&quot;.  
Part 4  
Dan turned up the next morning as agreed. Steve was waiting on his knees
  when we came down to the tennis courts. A short chain hobbled the tall slave's
  ankles and his back sported a tight pattern of fresh red lines. I've always
  liked tennis and enjoyed myself thoroughly, even if Dan beat me in five hard
  sets. &quot;Whew!&quot; I wiped sweat from my brow before Steve could reach
  me with the fresh towel he had ready for us after each set. &quot;You have
  a nasty backstroke&quot;. Dan grinned. &quot;How about a return match?&quot; &quot;Some
  other day. I'm an old man&quot;. &quot;Sure, sure, but do you mind if I play
  another? Steve's a great player&quot;. &quot;I thought it was football&quot;. &quot;He
  played tennis to keep in shape. Feet, Steve&quot;. &quot;Yes, Master Daniel&quot;.
  He dropped to his stomach and raised his legs to let Dan unlock the cuffs. &quot;Something
  of a bother, but Dad insists that our slaves are shackled whenever leaving
  the house&quot;. I sat down to watch the match. To my delight, Steve beat his
  master in three straight sets, running effortlessly on the hard gravel in spite
  of his bare feet. &quot;Mighty sore arse for you tonight, slave!&quot;, Dan
  threatened. &quot;Yes, Master Daniel&quot;. The half-naked boy hung his head,
  but with a smile on his face. He knelt to offer the ankle chain, but his young
  master shook his head and we went up to the penthouse. I showed my guest and
  his slave to the second spare room for a shower and went to my own bathroom
  to let Tim wash me.  
Dan was already in the garden when I came out, a barearsed and hobbled Steve
  at his feet. &quot;Hope you don't mind naked boys. This stupid slave of mine
  forgot to bring fresh shorts for himself and the sweaty rag he was wearing
  is just too disgusting&quot;. &quot;Not at all. Can I offer you a drink before
  lunch?&quot; &quot;A coke, please&quot;. I didn't have to tell Fred to bring
  it, along with a glass of cool white wine for me. &quot;He doesn't deserve
  it, but can Steve have something to eat?&quot; &quot;Of course, he may share
  with my slaves&quot;. Fred ushered him in and a little later told that our
  lunch was ready. It was as delicious as ever and Dan and I discussed tennis
  techniques while Fred and Tim took turns serving. Hopefully, I thought, because
  our slaves were enjoying their own lunch in the kitchen. We were waiting for
  dessert when Dan looked over my shoulder and abruptly stopped talking. He stared
  with a stupefied expression on his face, blushing furiously, then shook himself
  out of his stupor and finished the sentence. A moment later my slavegirl served
  us hot strawberry pie and offered a bowl of homemade ice cream. He took a helping,
  without looking up, still blushing. &quot;Perfect as always&quot;, I remarked
  when she was serving me, &quot;What did you have, Christine?&quot; &quot;Thank
  you, Sir. The same, Sir&quot;. She, too, was blushing, staring fixedly at her
  bare feet. &quot;Good, isn't it, Dan?&quot; &quot;Sure&quot;, he mumbled, still
  without raising his head. &quot;I think you may take that as praise for your
  excellent cooking, Christine&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir. Thank you, Sir&quot;. She
  topped up my wineglass and left for a moment to come back with a fresh glass
  of coke for my guest. This time he managed to stammer his thanks.  
&quot;Living in such a small town must be difficult. Most of you seem to
  know each other&quot;. I leaned back, nursing my wine and looking at my young
  guest. &quot;Yeah&quot;. He seemed lost in thought. &quot;Not least when one's
  friends get in trouble and suddenly are transformed to slaves&quot;. He nodded
  mutely. &quot;And that happens quite often, I've already learned. You and Steve,
  your brother and his girlfriend, my neighbours and my own slave&quot;. &quot;Yeah&quot;. &quot;You
  and Christine?&quot; He shook no. &quot;Don't lie to me, Dan. You know each
  other, don't you?&quot; He looked away. &quot;Friends, at school perhaps?&quot; &quot;Yes,
  she, we were classmates, Chris and Steve and I&quot;. &quot;Just classmates?&quot; At
  last he looked me in the eyes, his own brimming with tears. &quot;No, we...dated&quot;. &quot;And
  did more than just holding hands?&quot; &quot;Yes, we... Oh, shit! Why did
  you have to buy her?&quot; &quot;Actually I didn't, but I do own her. Is that
  a problem for you?&quot; &quot;No, I...&quot;. &quot;Dan, I like you and I'm
  looking forward to seeing you here again, often. If you don't want Christine
  around as she is now, I'll sell her, even if she's a marvellous cook&quot;. &quot;No,
  please don't! It's just...&quot;. &quot;I haven't used her, for sex, if that's
  what's bothering you, hardly even touched her&quot;. &quot;No, it's not that.
  She's yours and you can do to her what you like, that's how it is. No, it,
  I...&quot;. He drew a deep breath. &quot;It's my fault&quot;. &quot;Her enslavement?
  But that was for shoplifting. I can't imagine that you forced her to steal&quot;. &quot;No,
  of course not, but when... We only did it once, for real, and when I... undressed
  her, she was so embarrassed about her underwear. Her family isn't very well
  off and she... I mean, you couldn't buy one pair of my boxers for what she
  paid for ten sets of bra and panties, so...&quot;. &quot;So she stole to look
  pretty for you?&quot; &quot;I think so&quot;, he whispered. &quot;But that
  was still her own choice, you didn't tease her about it, did you?&quot; He
  shook his head. &quot;Of course not, I... I was in love with her. It doesn't,
  didn't matter how she was dressed. I could've bought her anything, but if I
  hadn't... pressed her, she wouldn't...&quot;. &quot;Do you still love her?&quot; &quot;I...
  You know I can't!&quot; &quot;But you do?&quot; He nodded mutely again. &quot;Do
  you want her? I'll happily sell her to you, for a price you can afford&quot;. &quot;No!
  No, absolutely not!&quot; He looked panicked. &quot;Why not? Your brother owns
  his girlfriend&quot;. &quot;I... Because I don't want to&quot;. &quot;You don't
  want her as a slave, but you could make it easier for her, treat her as your
  girlfriend?&quot; He looked away. &quot;No I couldn't. At our house slaves
  are slaves and treated... as slaves must be treated. It's bad enough with Steve&quot;. &quot;So
  you prefer that I keep her?&quot; &quot;Yes&quot;. He fastened his moist eyes
  on me again. &quot;Please!&quot;  
Just then Steve came back and surprised me by kneeling to kiss my shoes. &quot;Thank
  you for lunch, Sir&quot;. &quot;Enjoyed it?&quot; &quot;Very much, Sir. Chris
  is a great cook&quot;. He crawled to kneel by his master's chair. &quot;Some
  time since you had real food, what, Steve?&quot; Dan had regained his composure. &quot;Yes,
  Master Daniel&quot;. &quot;Your slaves eat chow?&quot; &quot;Out of dog bowls
  on the floor, hands clasped behind their backs, if you must know&quot;. &quot;Nice,
  that brother of yours&quot;, I remarked dryly. &quot;No he isn't and I've already
  told you that I don't like the way he treats our slaves&quot;. &quot;You did,
  and I suppose that he's responsible for the stripes on Steve's back&quot;. &quot;Yes&quot;. &quot;And
  what did this slave do to earn those?&quot; &quot;Nothing!&quot; &quot;Nothing?&quot; &quot;Harry
  claims that Steve scratched his balls when sucking them this morning&quot;. &quot;Clumsy&quot;. &quot;Harry
  was fucking Julie's arse and ordered Steve to work his balls over when he was
  up her. Maybe Steve did touch him with his teeth, but it must have been accidentally,
  with him hammering away on the girl&quot;. &quot;I see&quot;. &quot;No, you
  don't!&quot; His eyes flashed angrily. &quot;Harry will never forgive the two
  of them that she dropped him in favour of a poor scholarship guy, but Steve
  has only himself to blame. I'll never understand how he could be so stupid&quot;.
  I glanced at the kneeling boy, but he kept his head bowed. &quot;He's guilty
  of a major crime, but he's my friend. I do try making it easier for him, but
  what the hell can I do?&quot; I leaned over to squeeze his hand. &quot;Don't
  blame yourself&quot;.  
After Dan had left, I spent the remainder of the afternoon reading. My slaves
  moved quietly around, doing their chores and taking turns to kneel beside my
  chair. When Fred brought my pre-dinner drink, he asked permission to speak. &quot;I
  have to report Chris and Tim for punishment, Sir&quot;. &quot;So soon! What
  have they done?&quot; &quot;Chris dropped an egg on the floor while making
  lunch, Sir, and Tim didn't iron your underwear before stowing it away after
  washing&quot;. &quot;I see, and what kind of punishment do you suggest?&quot; &quot;It
  was an accident, but Chris should have been more careful, Sir. Ten strokes
  of the cane on her buttocks, if it may please you. Tim was deliberately lazy,
  Sir. Thirty lashes with the whip on his back and three days in heavy ankle
  chains and with weights in his nipple rings, if it may please you&quot;. &quot;Quite
  severe, isn't it?&quot; &quot;You ordered me to suggest punishments, Sir, and
  that is what I consider appropriate&quot;. &quot;What other masters consider
  appropriate, you mean?&quot; &quot;Some, Sir, others would be harder&quot;. &quot;I
  don't doubt it, but I'm not one of their kind&quot;. I thought for a moment. &quot;I
  don't want to cane Christine. She can serve as my footstool after dinner, naked
  and chained hand and foot&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. He looked relieved. &quot;I'll
  deal with Tim when he sees me to bed. Place some rope, a cane and the foot
  whip in my bedroom&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;.  
I was nursing the last of my wine after dinner when Fred led a naked Christine
  out to kneel in front of an armchair, made her curl into a ball with her arse
  towards it, cuffed her wrists behind her thighs and chained her ankles, then
  fetched my coffee. I emptied my glass, dismissed Fred, kicked off my loafers
  and sat down in the chair, resting my bare feet on her arse. I resumed reading,
  but it was hard to concentrate with the tempting globes right in front of my
  eyes. The girl tried to keep her body immobile, but as time went by, her legs
  began twisting and her arsecheeks opened to reveal a small rosebud. My cock
  stirred in my pants and I had to fight an urge to feel her up. After an hour
  I gave in, closed the book and swung down my feet. &quot;Turn and kneel upright
  in front of me&quot;. She laboured around, grunting with the pain in her cramped
  limbs, until she was facing me. With her hands cuffed behind her back, her
  chest was straining towards me and she surprised me by spreading her legs,
  offering a clear view of the pink, hairless slit. I swallowed hard and took
  a grip of myself. &quot;Look at me&quot;. She raised her head to reveal a pair
  of frightened eyes.  
&quot;Fred tells me that you've been trained to serve me in bed&quot;. &quot;Yes,
  Sir&quot;. Her voice was quavering on the verge of breaking into sobs. &quot;Did
  you enjoy the training?&quot; &quot;No, Sir&quot;. &quot;None of it?&quot; &quot;No,
  Sir&quot;. She shuddered. &quot;It was horrible!&quot; &quot;Dan told me that
  he has fucked you&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. &quot;Did you enjoy that?&quot; &quot;I...&quot;,
  she lowered her eyes, blushing all over her naked body, &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. &quot;So
  you can enjoy sex?&quot; &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. &quot;Was he your first?&quot; &quot;Yes,
  Sir&quot;. &quot;It must have hurt then, but you enjoyed it anyway?&quot; &quot;Yes,
  Sir&quot;. &quot;Because you were in love with him?&quot; &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;.
  Her voice dropped to a whisper. &quot;Do you think you'd enjoy sex with me?&quot; &quot;I'm
  your slave, Sir&quot;. &quot;And not supposed to enjoy what you have to do?&quot; &quot;No,
  Sir&quot;. &quot;Has the 'horrible' training scared you away from the pleasures
  of sex?&quot; &quot;I, eh, I don't know, Sir&quot;. Her frightened eyes were
  brimming with tears. &quot;If I let Dan fuck you, would you enjoy that?&quot; She
  stared uncomprehendingly at me. &quot;Would you?&quot; &quot;I...Please, Sir.
  I don't know what to... I, it...Yes, Sir. I think I would&quot;. &quot;So you
  still love him?&quot; &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;, she whispered. &quot;Even if it
  was his fault that you ended up a slave?&quot; &quot;But he had nothing to
  do with it!&quot;. &quot;That's not what he thinks or what he told me&quot;. &quot;But
  it's not true!&quot; &quot;Didn't you steal that underwear in order to please
  him?&quot; &quot;I, but...&quot;. &quot;That's why he blames himself&quot;. &quot;I,
  oh...&quot;. She burst into tears, fighting against the handcuffs. I rose abruptly. &quot;Your
  punishment is over, for now&quot;. &quot;Thank you, Sir&quot;, she managed
  to stammer, &quot;I'm sorry, Sir&quot;. &quot;Take greater care in the future&quot;. &quot;Yes,
  Sir&quot;. I went in to tell Fred to release her and send Tim to my bedroom.  
He came running to throw himself at my feet, already naked. &quot;Fred reports
  that you've been lazy and neglecting your duties&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. &quot;Why?&quot; &quot;I
  was down to empty the dryer and iron the stuff, Sir, and I met this old mate
  of mine. He's been a slave for 'bout a year, but we ain't seen him around,
  'cause of his master being away, but now he just moved in here and me mate,
  he was down to do his laundry and we got talking, sort of, 'bout what's happened
  and our friends and such...&quot;. &quot;And you forgot all about your duties?&quot; &quot;Yeah,
  Sir, got carried away some and thought I could sort of sneak your boxers down
  at the bottom of the pile and iron them later, but Fred caught me doing it.
  No excuse, Sir&quot;. &quot;And now you're mad at Fred&quot;. He sent me a
  puzzled look. &quot;Why's that, Sir? He's just doing his duty and he's a great
  guy&quot;. &quot;I'm happy to hear that. Shall we get on with your punishment?&quot; &quot;Yes,
  Sir, what do you want to do with me?&quot; &quot;Get on the bed, on your back
  and spread your arms&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. He placed himself to have
  his wrists lashed to the bedposts. &quot;Spread your legs&quot;. &quot;Yessir&quot;.
  I tied a piece of twine around the base of his cock and balls, ordered him
  to raise his feet and tied the ends to his big toes. &quot;Comfortable?&quot; &quot;Not
  much, Sir&quot;. He tried to keep his legs still and some slack in the string,
  but soon had to give in when I began beating the soles of his broad feet with
  the small whip. &quot;Augh! Oh, shit, ouw!&quot; He waved his legs, tightening
  the string around his genitals, hissing between his teeth. After fifteen hard
  lashes on each foot, I lowered the whip. &quot;Learned your lesson?&quot; &quot;Yeah,
  Sir. Sorry, Sir&quot;. &quot;Perhaps&quot;. I grabbed the cane and laid a stripe
  across his buttocks. &quot;One, Sir. Thanks, Sir&quot;. Another stripe joined
  the first. &quot;Two, Sir. Thanks, Sir&quot;. His black hide was nicely decorated
  with clearly raised welts, when he moaned: &quot;Twenty, Sir. Thanks, Sir&quot;.
  I changed position and hit along the gaping crack of his arse. &quot;Aieeh!
  Ooh, shit!&quot; &quot;Forgot to count, didn't you?&quot; I hit the same spot
  again. &quot;Ooh, arrgh! Twenty.... Ooh!&quot; &quot;Twenty-two it was&quot;.
  I dropped the cane and tore off my shirt, jeans, and briefs and knelt between
  his widespread knees. &quot;And now the reward&quot;. My aching tool was rammed
  into his puckered hole and I began mauling him mercilessly. It was heaven,
  better than anything I'd experienced so far, even better than Fred's arse.
  The helpless teenage-boy, his burning hide against my thighs, when I slammed
  into him, his blistered feet waving, his cock and balls turning blue, the feeling
  of total control, all of it combined to make it a nerve-shattering experience
  when I erupted into him. &quot;Whew!&quot; I sank back on my haunches, looking
  into the boy's pleading eyes. His long cock stood stiff and waving. &quot;That
  was good, Tim&quot;. &quot;Thanks, Sir. Happy to serve you&quot;, he croaked.
  I quickly freed his toes and genitals and grabbed the rock-hard tool. &quot;But
  what about you?&quot; &quot;Sir?&quot; &quot;You didn't enjoy it&quot;. &quot;Not
  supposed to, Sir&quot;. &quot;Not even this?&quot; I stroked his cock. &quot;Please,
  Sir!&quot; &quot;Please, what?&quot; &quot;Please, Sir. I... If you go on like
  that, I can't hold off&quot;. &quot;And why should you?&quot; &quot;Arrgh,
  shit!&quot;, he moaned, biting his lower lip, &quot;Slaves are not allowed
  to come, Sir&quot;. &quot;You are&quot;. &quot;Yessir, thanks, Siir, aah!&quot; He
  gave in and long hot spurts of sperm hit his chest. &quot;Gawd! Thanks, Sir.
  Ooh!&quot;  
I untied his wrists and he rolled on his knees to suck shit and sperm off
  my cock. &quot;Thanks a million, Sir&quot;. He looked up with a genuine expression
  of gratitude. &quot;For punishing you?&quot; &quot;That too, Sir, but mostly
  for being such a kind master&quot;. &quot;You consider me kind, even after
  what I've just done to you?&quot; &quot;Course, Sir, me own bloody fault, and
  you let us eat real food, sleep in a real bed, have a decent room, TV and all,
  and you allow me to come. Yessir, you can do anything you like to me&quot;. &quot;I
  don't think I have to ask your permission for that&quot;. &quot;Course not,
  Sir, but...&quot;. &quot;But you accept it?&quot; &quot;Got to, ain't I, and
  times I like it, Sir&quot;. &quot;You like being whipped?&quot; &quot;Nah,
  Sir, not just like that, it bloody hurts, but that blockhead me mum ganged
  up with, he was always beating the shit out of us. Sometimes I got a boner,
  when he was belting me arse, and had to run off, soon as he was finished, and
  beat off, so when you whipped me and let me blow me load, that was so great,
  Sir!&quot; He beamed at me, planted a kiss on my cock and jumped up to run
  my bath. I allowed him a shower while I was soaking in the tub, earning another
  beaming smile, before he hurried to change the soiled sheets on my bed and
  come back to dry me.  
I won't say that the relationship between my slaves and me changed radically
  after that day, but they seemed much more cheerful and content, even if punishments
  became a regular part of their life. Perhaps because of their better living
  conditions, perhaps because I was now acting more like a 'proper' master. I
  seldom found any reason to be dissatisfied, but Fred dutifully reported a number
  of minor infractions, which he thought warranted a punishment. Tim was often
  the culprit and did I enjoy striping his hide before fucking him! Perhaps he
  enjoyed it as well. I sometimes wondered if he made mistakes on purpose. Christine
  never suffered a beating. I simply couldn't make myself take a cane to her
  arse, but she 'was' punished, mostly chained up naked as my footstool, sometimes
  put on display in a set of stocks, an iron bar with four curved spaces to lock
  on her wrists and ankles. She hated it, just as much as I enjoyed looking at
  her slim body, forced into cramped positions on her knees or back, bare toes
  curling with strain and cunt gaping open. Tempting, but I never touched her,
  actually began wondering about my own sexuality. Up until now I'd considered
  myself straight, had fucked a number of girls, but after I'd learned to enjoy
  the two boys' hot mouths and tight arses, it wasn't difficult to resist the
  teenage girl's charms. It was much more difficult when Tim was trussed up at
  my feet. Fred didn't spare himself and I had to cane him occasionally for very
  small offences, but acknowledged his unspoken insistence that he must be treated
  like his fellows, even if he was as perfect a slave as anyone could wish for.
  Unlike with Tim, I didn't mix pain and pleasure with Fred. Sex with him was
  always quiet lovemaking, his tongue teasing my body until I was about to explode
  and then a long hot fucking of his arse.  
The offences were mostly minimal and called for minimal punishments, if you
  name ten hard lashes with a cane across your arse minimal, but a few times
  I had to be harder. The first occasion was when Fred stumbled and dropped my
  lunch on one of the Persian carpets. It was an accident, but he quietly insisted
  that it had to be punished severely, at least with a whipping of his back.
  I didn't want to do it in front of the others, so I took him down to the cellar
  and had just strung him up when Jane entered with the hapless Toby in tow. &quot;Hello
  again!&quot; She looked startled at her former lover's naked body, painfully
  stretched on tiptoe. &quot;We can't go on meeting like this&quot;. She grinned
  and dragged her slaveboy towards the stocks. I looked apologetically at Fred,
  but apparently he was quite unperturbed by the encounter. Jane finished strapping
  down her boy and turned to the display of whips and paddles hanging neatly
  on the wall. &quot;Do you know how to use that?&quot; She looked at the heavy
  whip in my hand. &quot;Ah, not exactly. I've only used canes so far, and I
  had some experience with those&quot;. I grinned a bit sheepishly. &quot;Then
  use this instead&quot;. She handed me a flogger with ten thin suede tails. &quot;It
  stings like hell, but doesn't draw blood. You have to practice with that whip
  before using it or risk damaging the slave seriously&quot;. &quot;Thanks&quot;.
  I took a practice swing. &quot;Not like that&quot;. Jane grabbed the flogger
  with her right hand, the tails with her left, drew them up towards her shoulder
  and let it fly with a swishing sound. &quot;Make sure to spread them&quot;.
  She repeated the demonstration then offered the flogger back. &quot;Eh, I...Could
  you show me?&quot; &quot;On Fred! You must be kidding&quot;. She stared from
  me to the bare back beside us. &quot;Please?&quot; &quot;Aw, I can't do that,
  he's too sweet&quot;. &quot;That's why he deserves to be dealt with by an expert,
  not a clumsy amateur like me&quot;. &quot;Aw...&quot;. She hesitated, but her
  eyes were gleaming. &quot;Well, OK, but only to do you a favour&quot;. Her
  small hands grabbed the tails again, raised the flogger and let it slash across
  the exposed flesh, leaving ten thin red lines. &quot;One, Miss Jane. Thank
  you, Miss&quot;. Fred's voice was as calm as ever. &quot;You're welcome, loverboy&quot;.
  The tails flew again. &quot;Two, Miss Jane. Thank you, Miss&quot;. &quot;How
  many?&quot; The breathless voice revealed her excitement. &quot;Twenty&quot;. &quot;OK&quot;.  
She really was an expert. The evil strands of the flogger travelled
    slowly down Fred's back, covering it from shoulders to the back of his thighs.
    The last two lashes were directed at his arse and even if he continued his
    calm counting and thanks for the punishment, his voice was strained when
    he at last announced: &quot;Twenty, Miss Jane. Thank you, Miss&quot;. She
    dropped the flogger and went round to confront him, &quot;You're welcome&quot;,
    then surprised me by throwing her arms around his midriff, burying her face
    at his chest and whispering: &quot;I'm sorry, Fred. Can you forgive me?&quot; &quot;There's
    nothing to forgive, Miss Jane. I deserved my punishment. Thank you, Miss&quot;.
    She let go and took a step back, while I let him down and released his chafed
    wrists. The naked slave dropped to his knees and kissed her feet, then turned
    to me. &quot;Thank you, Miss Jane and Sir&quot;. I looked at the striped
    back and raised my eyes to meet Jane's. They were moist, but held a strange
    gleam. 'Sorry or aroused?', I mused and saw her thighs rubbing against each
    other. &quot;Is Charlie at home?&quot;, I asked. &quot;Noo, not until tonight&quot;,
    she whispered. &quot;Would you like to borrow Fred for an hour or two?&quot; &quot;What
    for?&quot; She stared at me. &quot;He may be able to help you relax&quot;. &quot;What
    do you mean... Aw, shit! Is it that obvious?&quot; I just grinned and nudged
    the kneeling slave with my foot. &quot;See Miss Jane to her flat and make
    her comfortable&quot;. He looked up, staring at me for a moment, rose and
    bowed to her. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. She swallowed hard, stepped up to give
    me a peck on the cheek and whisper: &quot;Thanks, John, but not a word to
    Charlie!&quot; I shook no. &quot;I think I'll leave Toby to contemplate his
    fate&quot;. She 
  swept towards the door, Fred jumping ahead to open it for her, and I followed,
  patting his shoulder on the way.   
I didn't know he was back until he served my tea, calm as always. &quot;Was
  Jane satisfied with you?&quot; I took a sip, looking at his bowed head and
  striped back. &quot;So Miss Jane very kindly said, Sir&quot;. &quot;And you?&quot; &quot;I
  was happy serving Miss Jane well, Sir&quot;. &quot;Of course, but was it good?&quot; &quot;Miss
  Jane is a very, eh, passionate woman, Sir&quot;. &quot;Miss her?&quot; He looked
  up at me. &quot;It's as Miss Jane told you, Sir. We were happy together, but
  parted amiably when it was over&quot;. I refrained from prying further and
  he knelt silently by my chair, while I resumed reading, after all satisfied
  that I'd done the right thing. Both of us was startled, when Tim a couple of
  hours later announced that Charlie wanted a word with me, and exchanged worried
  looks, but the large young man was as friendly as ever when accepting a beer,
  flopping down on a chair. &quot;I came to ask if I could borrow Fred for a
  couple of hours tomorrow. Have to finish an essay and I've got stuck&quot;.
  I choked on my drink and almost spluttered it over the floor. &quot;Of course&quot;,
  I gasped, looking at my slave, whose shoulders seemed to be shaking in soundless
  laughter.  
&quot;Very much in demand, aren't we?&quot; I asked, when Fred later that
  night was licking along the crack of my arse. &quot;So it seems, Sir&quot;.
  He looked up briefly, the ghost of a smile playing on his lips. &quot;No wonder&quot;,
  I moaned when his tongue stabbed into my hole, &quot;Perhaps I should try the
  same as Jane&quot;. &quot;Sir?&quot; He looked up. &quot;Fuck me&quot;. &quot;Yes,
  Sir, just a minute&quot;. He jumped up and left for a moment to come back with
  a tube of KY-jelly. I'd turned to kneel on the edge of the bed and moaned softly
  when his fingers probed my arsehole, carefully spreading the lubricant. &quot;Aah,
  feels good&quot;. &quot;Thank you, Sir. Have you tried this before, Sir?&quot; &quot;No&quot;. &quot;I've
  better open you up a bit then, Sir&quot;. One of his fingers wormed its way
  into me, feeling around. A shiver of pleasure ran down my spine when it touched
  my prostate and I moaned again when a second finger joined it. &quot;God, this
  is fantastic!&quot;, I mumbled and felt a third finger enter. He fucked me
  slowly and carefully for a while, then withdrew. I felt strangely empty and
  wriggled my arse impatiently until the head of his cock touched my opening. &quot;Yess,
  ram it in!&quot; He didn't, just held it there for a moment before pressing
  gently against my sphincter, slowly going past it and up the hot tunnel until
  his balls at last touched my arse. &quot;God!&quot;, I whispered. It hurt,
  but sent sensations through my body like nothing I'd felt before. &quot;Good,
  Sir?&quot; He moved slowly back and forth. &quot;My God, yess!&quot; I was
  shivering, tears running down my face, when he slowly increased his speed,
  and began thrusting back to meet him. My own cock banged against my stomach,
  stiff as a board and throbbing almost painfully until it suddenly spurted thick
  wads of come on the sheet and I collapsed, spent but more satisfied than ever.
  Fred's dick left me and I felt his tongue cleaning my hole, but of course he
  hadn't shot his own load. &quot;God!&quot; I rolled on my back to stare up
  at him. &quot;Why did I wait all those years for this?&quot; He sank to his
  knees and cleaned my aching cock carefully.  
The next day Fred was his usual calm and subservient self, never revealing
  the slightest hint that he'd fucked his master. His back was still marked by
  Jane's flogger and I ordered him to put on a shirt. Charlie phoned after lunch
  and I sent Fred down as agreed. He kept him all afternoon and, when I asked
  how it'd gone, Fred told that Charlie had three of their mutual friends over
  and that he'd been asked for some quite extensive tutoring. &quot;An embarrassment
  or a pleasure?&quot; &quot;A pleasure, Sir, I was happy to serve the young
  masters&quot;. &quot;Rubbish, Fred! It must have been embarrassing&quot;. &quot;No,
  Sir, it was good to...&quot;. &quot;To be allowed using your brain and your
  skills again&quot;. &quot;I...&quot;. &quot;Do you still have notes and drafts
  for your thesis?&quot; &quot;Yes, Sir, at my parents&quot;. &quot;I want you
  to finish it&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. He sent me a puzzled look. &quot;I
  expect to use it in my own work&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. &quot;And if you
  really don't mind, I'll let Charlie and his friends borrow you again&quot;. &quot;I
  don't, Sir&quot;. I told him to phone his parents to prepare them for a visit,
  and, as an afterthought, asked Christine if she'd like to visit hers. She stared
  speechlessly at me and burst into tears, but managed to stammer that she would
  like it, very much.  
That night I ordered her to see me to bed for the first time as my slave.
  She was quite obviously frightened, but did what she could to hide her nervousness
  when serving as I by now had grown used to, licking my feet and undressing
  me, hesitating only when my stiff cock sprang free, waving in her face. &quot;Do
  you ... want me to suck you, Sir?&quot; Her voice quavered and she didn't dare
  looking up at me. &quot;Not now, start my shower&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;.
  She jumped up to shed her clothes and pad naked to the bathroom. Her hands
  were softer than Tim's when they slid down my back, in between my arsecheeks
  and down my legs. She crept around on her knees to wash my feet and shins. &quot;You
  may suck me off now&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. She shuddered, but raised
  her head to lick my sack and suck gently on the nuts. Her tongue continued
  up and down my stiff pole and finally her mouth closed on it. I threw back
  my head into the streaming water, moaning with lust when the hot tongue swirled
  around me, and came violently. &quot;That was good, slave&quot;. &quot;Thank
  you, Sir&quot;. She retched, but managed to swallow my load and rose to continue
  washing me. When we came back to the bedroom, she drew sheets and blankets
  off my bed and stood awkwardly cradling them to her chest. &quot;No need to
  hide your body, I know it quite well already, and don't I own it?&quot; I smiled
  evilly. &quot;No, Sir. Yes, Sir&quot;. She lowered the covering with a resigned
  look in her eyes. &quot;You may go now. Good night&quot;. &quot;Good night,
  Sir&quot;. &quot;Disappointed?&quot; I chuckled and lay down on the bed. &quot;Sir?&quot; She
  covered me. &quot;That I won't fuck you? Perhaps I should change my mind?&quot; &quot;I...I'll
  be happy to serve you, Sir&quot;. I chuckled again and waved her away.  
The next morning I told her to put on a long skirt, which almost covered
  her bare feet, and Fred to dress in jeans. He advised me that slaves ride in
  the trunk, but I let them kneel on the floor in front of the back seat instead
  while we drove to the modest residential area where Christine had her former
  home. I watched her run up to the door and caught a glimpse of a slender woman
  when it was opened and she flew into her arms. Fred was dropped off at the
  entrance to a housing estate. He was as calm and polite as ever, but his eyes
  revealed his joy. I paid a visit to the library and later went downtown to
  browse a couple of bookshops. While in the second, I happened to glance through
  the shop window to see a police van double-parked beside my Bentley. An officer
  was forcing Tim, hands cuffed behind his back, into the van. 'What the hell!',
  I thought and hurried out to cross over. Three other, white, teenage-boys,
  whose worn sneakers revealed that they couldn't be slaves, were on their stomachs
  beside the van, likewise cuffed. &quot;What's going on here?&quot;, I demanded, &quot;What
  are you doing with my slave?&quot; The two police officers turned, surprised. &quot;This
  is your slave, Mister, and your car?&quot; &quot;It is&quot;. &quot;We caught
  him conspiring with these punks&quot;. &quot;Conspiring?&quot; &quot;Yeah,
  planning a crime&quot;. &quot;Really?&quot; My eyebrows rose questioningly. &quot;What
  exactly were they doing?&quot; &quot;Well, talking. Your slave used to be member
  of the street gang the others belong to&quot;. &quot;Talking to his friends,
  then?&quot; &quot;Like I said, Mister, conspiring. Slaves ain't got no free
  friends and don't talk to free people, 'specially not punks&quot;. &quot;I've
  explicitly allowed mine to do exactly that, if he's waiting by the car and
  has nothing else to do&quot;. &quot;I told, them, Sir, but they wouldn't listen&quot;.
  The officer, who was manhandling him, slapped the back of his head. &quot;Shut
  the fuck up, slave!&quot; &quot;Will you please refrain from damaging my property,
  officer, and release him, at once!&quot; &quot;But we caught him planning a
  crime, Mister&quot;, he hissed. &quot;You did nothing of the sort. You saw
  him talking quietly to his friends, as his master has allowed&quot;. &quot;So
  you believe him innocent?&quot; &quot;I have no reason not to, and neither
  have you. Now release him!&quot; Grudgingly he unlocked the cuffs and my slaveboy
  dropped to his knees to kiss my shoes. &quot;Thanks, Sir. We didn't do nothing
  but talk, Sir&quot;. &quot;Of course not, Tim, you may rise&quot;. &quot;Let's
  get the others loaded&quot;, the officer grumbled to his fellow. &quot;We can't
  take them if this gent won't press charges&quot;. &quot;And he will not&quot;. &quot;Aw,
  shit, Mister! We know that those punks are criminals, just like your slave&quot;. &quot;Then
  prove it, but without my assistance&quot;. He shrugged his shoulders. &quot;OK,
  OK. We'll get them some other day&quot;. They retrieved their cuffs and drove
  off.  
The boys rose, rubbing their wrists. Tall and muscular, they looked very
  much like my slaveboy, except for their grubby jeans, T-shirts and sneakers. &quot;Thanks&quot;,
  one of them mumbled. &quot;Hey, you say 'Sir' to my master!&quot;, Tim hissed. &quot;What
  for? I don't say that to no bloody master until I've got one&quot;. &quot;You
  do to mine!&quot; The two large boys faced each other, clenching their fists. &quot;Tim!&quot; &quot;Yes,
  Sir, sorry Sir, but he's gotta show respect&quot;. One of the other boys stepped
  between them, bowing politely to me. &quot;Thanks, Sir, that was fucking decent
  of you&quot;. &quot;Not really, I won't perjure myself&quot;. &quot;Lots of
  people wouldn't think twice about it, and they'll get us anyway, like he told
  you ...Sir&quot;. The first boy sent Tim a sly grin. &quot;Why? Are you criminals?&quot; &quot;Nah,
  Sir, but we've got to live, ain't we?&quot; &quot;You have no jobs?&quot; &quot;You're
  kidding, Sir. There are no jobs for guys like us&quot;. &quot;Because you're
  lazy?&quot; &quot;Nah, 'cause they've got slaves...Sir&quot;. &quot;But you
  want work?&quot; &quot;Sure, Sir, if we could find any&quot;. I considered
  for a moment. &quot;Very well. I may have something for you if you show up
  at Marsfield Gardens in two hours, prepared for honest hard work&quot;. &quot;What
  kind of work, Sir?&quot; &quot;What you tell me slaves do instead of you&quot;. &quot;Kay,
  Sir, thanks&quot;. &quot;See you, then. Tim!&quot; &quot;Yessir&quot;. He opened
  the door for me, sent his stupefied fellows a grin and got behind the wheel.  
I'd told the two other slaves that they could stay out until six and Christine
  to prepare a cold lunch for me. We ran an errand on the way and I made some
  phone-calls while my slaveboy tossed a salad to serve with slices of cured
  ham, followed by fine cheeses and the strawberry pie, he'd been told how to
  heat up. When he announced that lunch was ready, somewhat nervous about the
  outcome of his efforts, I ordered him to lay the table for two. He looked puzzled
  and was obviously shocked when I told him to sit down and eat with me. &quot;But,
  Sir!&quot; &quot;I want to talk to you&quot;. &quot;Yessir&quot;. He was apprehensive,
  but managed to get through the meal without mishaps, serving me, and himself,
  and answering my questions about his former life. He even found time to stuff
  himself and drink the two bottles of coke, I allowed him  
I was looking through some files in my study, when I heard him answering
  a call from Reception and some minutes later open the door. &quot;Get out of
  them dirty sneakers&quot;, he hissed. &quot;Aw, man, we're no slaves, not yet&quot;. &quot;Nah,
  but 'tis me who's gotta clean the fucking floors&quot;. &quot;OK, OK&quot;. &quot;Those
  guys are here, Sir&quot;. He knelt by the door. &quot;Show them to the garden.
  I'll join them shortly&quot;. &quot;Yessir&quot;. The three boys were whispering
  together, pointing out sights from the rooftop when I came out. &quot;Good
  afternoon&quot;. &quot;Afternoon, Sir&quot;. They straightened to face me and
  I noticed that they'd made an effort to make themselves presentable, even if
  their grubby bare feet did spoil the picture somewhat. &quot;Please be seated&quot;.
  I indicated a group of garden furniture beside the pool. &quot;May I offer
  you something to drink?&quot; They sank down on the edge of the chairs. &quot;A
  coke would be great, Sir&quot;. I waved to Tim, who'd followed me out, and
  took the fourth chair. &quot;I own this estate and have until now employed
  a service company to maintain it, using slave labour, of course, but am willing
  to offer you an opportunity to prove that you really are willing to work for
  your living&quot;. Tim came back with a tray and served me a glass of white
  wine, then turned on his knees to offer the boys coke. &quot;You may have one
  as well, Tim, if you can stomach more of that nasty stuff&quot;. I saluted
  them and took a sip of my wine. &quot;The estate has quite extensive grounds,
  as you can see, including swimming-pool and tennis-courts. I want them kept
  as they are now, flowerbeds weeded and pruned, lawns trimmed to perfection,
  footpaths raked, forecourt swept, pool cleaned and tennis-courts tidy. Can
  you do that?&quot; They exchanged doubtful looks. &quot;Guess so, Sir&quot;.
  One of them nodded. &quot;Worked some with a gardener, promised to teach me,
  but threw me out and bought a couple slaves&quot;. &quot;Excellent. What I
  have in mind is to terminate that part of my contract with the service-company
  and offer it to you for the same fee as I pay them&quot;. They looked at each
  other again. &quot;Thanks, Sir, mighty kind of you, it is&quot;.  
&quot;That's settled, then. I have to give two weeks notice, so you can't
  start until then&quot;. &quot;OK, Sir&quot;. &quot;But I don't want to risk
  losing you before actually entering my service, because of some stupid mistake&quot;. &quot;We
  won't make no mistakes, Sir&quot;. &quot;&quot;The police might&quot;. &quot;Yeah&quot;.
  They looked down, shuffling their bare feet. &quot;Tim tells me that you're
  more or less homeless, like himself, before he was enslaved&quot;. They nodded. &quot;Then
  I have another proposal. Down at the back of my grounds is a small cottage,
  built to house the janitor, but unoccupied since he was replaced by slaves,
  years ago. I'll let you stay there, free of rent&quot;. They gaped at me. &quot;But,
  Sir!&quot; I held up my hand. &quot;And that's not particularly generous. In
  return I expect you to take care of my property. You can start by cleaning
  it out, paint it and repair what you can manage&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir. Thanks
  ever so much, Sir&quot;. &quot;Which again means that you are now employed
  by me&quot;. I fished a stack of notes out of my pocket and distributed them
  to the stupefied boys. &quot;The cottage is not uninhabitable, so I suggest
  that you fetch your belongings and move in right away to start working on it
  tomorrow&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. They jumped up. &quot;Just a minute.
  Tim!&quot; &quot;Yessir&quot;. He hurried in to come back a few moments later
  with three plastic bags, handing them to his friends. They stood clutching
  them awkwardly. &quot;Open them&quot;, Tim urged and they hauled out a pair
  of overalls and three T-shirts each. I had 'Marsfield gardener' printed on
  them. &quot;Put them on, guys. You'll look great&quot;. A bit shy they got
  out of their worn shirts and jeans to reveal three splendid teenage bodies.
  I almost regretted having saved them from slavery, it could have been a pleasure
  to play with them, but they did look great in the new clothes. &quot;Tha&hellip; Thanks,
  Sir&quot;, they stammered in chorus. &quot;Not at all. I want my employees
  looking neat. Now, if you've finished your drinks, you may go down to have
  a look at the cottage. Tim can show you around, and until you've made it ready,
  you can have your meals up here, with my slaves, provided you treat Christine
  politely. She may be a slavegirl, but not to you&quot;. &quot;Course, Sir,
  and thanks again, it's...&quot;. I raised my hand to silence them and they
  gathered their clothes and filed out. &quot;One hour, Tim&quot;. &quot;Yessir&quot;.
  He followed and a few minutes later I saw them crossing the lawn, Tim gesturing
  eagerly and slapping their shoulders. 'Another group of old friends, who know
  how to retain a relaxed relationship, even if one of them is a slave', I thought
  and went back to my study. Some time later I heard Tim moving around the flat,
  vacuuming and later cleaning the pool. He came in to remind me that it was
  half past five, time to fetch his fellow slaves.  
Christine was waiting at the front door when Tim drove up. She gave the woman
  beside her a quick kiss, when I opened the car door, and came running to kneel
  on the floor beside me, face pressed to the seat and hands clasped behind her
  back. The older woman, her mother, I presumed, stood looking after her, then
  strode towards my car. I leaned across the kneeling slavegirl to offer my hand. &quot;How
  do you do, Ma'am&quot;. She looked gravely at me. &quot;I know it's awkward,
  but I couldn't just... Thank you for treating my daughter so kindly&quot;. &quot;I
  don't know if I do, Ma'am. She's a model slave&quot;. &quot;I, eh, but you...&quot;.
  She looked away. &quot;I don't know what to say, but if I can do anything in
  return...&quot;. &quot;Thank you, Ma'am, I'll bear that in mind, but I see
  no reason to be unnecessarily cruel, don't you agree?&quot; She swallowed hard, &quot;Yes,
  now&quot;, and looked at me again. &quot;We've sold our slaves. I...we couldn't...not
  after Chris...&quot;. She shook her head and turned abruptly to go back to
  the house. I closed the door and raised her daughter's head to make her look
  up at me. &quot;Enjoyed your outing, did you?&quot; &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;, she
  whispered, eyes brimming with tears, &quot;Thank you, Sir&quot;. &quot;Like
  another?&quot; &quot;Yes, Sir, very much&quot;. &quot;Good, you can have one
  afternoon a week off, provided that your mother fetches you by car. I won't
  have you exposed to bullies in the streets&quot;. &quot;Thank you, Sir, thank
  you&quot;, she stammered, kissing my hand.  
Fred's eyes lit up in surprise when I told him about the new staff, but he
  didn't comment. &quot;Have a look at the cottage tomorrow and buy what's needed,
  paint, furniture and fittings, simple, but of good quality&quot;. &quot;Yes,
  Sir&quot;. &quot;When the boys come up here, they're your equals, even if they
  are free and you are slaves&quot;. He hesitated. &quot;That's ... unusual,
  Sir&quot;. &quot;But what I want&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. &quot;I've told
  Christine that she may visit her family one afternoon a week, you're allowed
  the same&quot;. &quot;Thank you, Sir&quot;. &quot;And Tim may have an evening
  off to stay with his old friends down at the cottage&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir.
  You are...&quot;. I cut him short. &quot;I want to read the draft of your thesis&quot;. &quot;Yes,
  Sir&quot;. It was good, in fact brilliant, even if it lacked the finishing
  touches. A stringent presentation of the subject, at an academic level, I with
  a pang of regret had to admit that I'd never be able to reach. He got it back
  without comment, but with an order to take time off to finish it, using my
  laptop in one of the spare bedrooms.  
Part 5  
The autumn term was about to begin and the student population trickling back
  to town. The number of participants at the barbecue parties on Friday grew
  as my tenants took up residence. I'd been down there a couple of times, not
  to join the meals, I'm no fan of half cooked, charred steak, but to share a
  bottle of wine or two. As Jane had told me, most of the tenants were students,
  with a few junior lecturers thrown in. They were generally a pleasant lot,
  fairly well off, since they, or their parents, could afford the rent, and all
  of them kept at least one slave.  
That Friday there were far more than the usual dozen down there, rather about
  thirty. Their slaves were milling around, tending to the three barbecues and
  serving at the tables set up on the lawn. I heard talking and laughing, while
  enjoying my own dinner and decided to join the fun. When I came down, with
  Tim in attendance, they'd finished dinner and were sitting in smaller groups
  around the pool, most of the men nursing beer and the girls white wine. Charlie
  jumped up to introduce me to those of the party I hadn't met before and then
  asked me to join Jane and him and two of the newcomers, a handsome couple,
  Paul and Paula, quite obviously twins. They had naked slaves trussed up to
  serve as footstools; the young man a girl and his sister a boy. He saw me looking
  curiously at them and confirmed my guess. &quot;Yes they are, twins I mean.
  Paula and I thought it fun to have another pair like us, and we know how close
  you get, don't we, Sis?&quot; &quot;Sure, and they're so grateful to be allowed
  serving together, aren't you?&quot; She moved a shapely bare foot down in front
  of the boy, who pressed his lips to it and then looked up with a strained smile. &quot;Yes,
  Miss Paula&quot;. &quot;You share a flat?&quot; &quot;We share everything,
  have done so since our cradle, though not a bed nowadays, at least not when
  sleeping&quot;. I must have looked shocked, because Paula laughed. &quot;Not
  quite what you think, John, but we play our slaves together, the girl licks
  me and the boy sucks Paul before we switch to plunge in and on. Great fun&quot;.
  She smiled sweetly. &quot;We really have no secrets and nothing to hide&quot;. &quot;And
  our slaves just love it, don't you?&quot; The slavegirl had her wrists cuffed
  to her ankles and her arse towards her master, who was resting his bare feet
  on the soft flesh. He dug one of them between her thighs to rub against her
  sex. A shiver ran through the naked body. &quot;Don't you?&quot;, he persisted. &quot;Yes,
  Sir&quot;, she moaned and jumped as far as her bondage allowed, when his big
  toe apparently found her clit. &quot;Yeah, always horny, those two. That's
  what got them in trouble. Found in a sixty-nine on the beach one night, ten
  years for indecent and incestuous behaviour in public&quot;. The slavegirl
  was breathing hard and cried out softly. &quot;But so lucky to be bought by
  a caring and understanding master and mistress&quot;. Paul chuckled and turned
  to wave his soiled foot at the slaveboy, who dutifully licked it clean of his
  sister's juices. &quot;Who allow them all the incestuous behaviour they may
  wish for. You ought to see them rolling on the floor, fucking like rabbits,
  heats one up no end, and they have the most fantastic arseholes, tight as gloves
  and completely identical&quot;.  
Jane shook her head and sent me an embarrassed smile. &quot;Please excuse
  them, John, they're always like that, but fun to be with, once you've grown
  used to their antics&quot;. &quot;Yeah, sorry if we're shocking you, but we
  don't consider sex indecent or shameful, something to suppress&quot;. Paula
  winked seductively at me. &quot;It's wonderful, I can't get enough of it&quot;. &quot;Will
  you lay off him!&quot; Jane hissed angrily. &quot;You saw him first, you mean?&quot; &quot;I
  did, but that's not the point. You're wasting your talents, dear&quot;. &quot;Oh!&quot; Paula
  glanced at Tim and smiled sweetly. &quot;Well, OK, sorry. Can't blame a girl
  for trying&quot;. &quot;May I offer you something else. A glass of champagne
  perhaps?&quot; I returned the smile. &quot;That'd be great, and no hard feelings?&quot; &quot;None,
  and you?&quot; I turned to her brother and Charlie. &quot;Beer, thanks, and
  please take no notice of my crazy sister&quot;. &quot;Impossible and unfair!&quot; I
  sent Tim for the drinks and Paul kicked his slavegirl's arse gently. &quot;I've
  got to make room for another beer&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. She wriggled
  around on her knees, gasping with the strain in her cramped limbs, and managed
  to get her head between his legs, while he quite unperturbed asked me how I
  liked the town. Her teeth drew down his zipper and she nuzzled with her nose
  until she at last could get her lips around his flaccid cock and drag it out. &quot;Aah!&quot;.
  Paul sighed while her throat worked frantically. I looked at the others, but
  neither his sister, nor Jane or Charlie seemed to take any notice of the humiliation
  of the poor girl. &quot;Is that normal?&quot; I asked. &quot;What?&quot; Jane
  looked puzzled. &quot;That!&quot; I nodded at the scene. &quot;Well, I guess
  it is&quot;. &quot;In public?&quot; &quot;Not in the middle of the street,
  but discreetly, like this, sitting at a caf&eacute; table, on a park bench,
  yes, many people do that. Men of course, another unfair discrimination of women&quot;. &quot;Not
  true, darling&quot;, Charlie interrupted, &quot;Some girls do it too, but of
  course you'd have to wear a skirt&quot;. &quot;And no panties, that's what
  you'd like, isn't it, Romeo?&quot; He grinned. &quot;Not your piss, darling,
  but I wouldn't mind doing something else under your skirt&quot;. She shook
  her head. &quot;No more drinks for that guy, but he's right, it does happen&quot;. &quot;In
  your bed, for example. She hates getting up, so Toby's there every morning,
  with a glass of juice and his mouth ready. Some sight, I tell you&quot;.  
I thought it disgusting, but refrained from comment when Tim came back to
  serve drinks. The twins released their slaves to let them kneel beside their
  chairs. Jane and Charlie had a girl and a boy with them, I hadn't seen before.
  They were in shorts and T-shirts, but I noticed that many of the other slaves
  were naked like Paul's and Paula's. We talked about the coming term, and the
  twins, who were studying business administration, sharing even that, were very
  much looking forward to a series of lectures on investment by a number of younger
  bankers and stockbrokers. &quot;Those kids can really teach you a thing or
  two&quot;. Paul's eyes gleamed. 'Well, why not?', I thought. My father had
  never pressed me to take an interest in his business, but it might please him
  if I one day could tell him something he didn't know. 'Not very likely, but
  why not try?' I'd already planned to attend another series, with politicians
  and experts from all over the world, and following two would take up much of
  my time, delaying my own work. 'But Fred can do the initial research for me,
  can't he, and enjoy it too'.  
Disregarding their obsession with sex, Paul and Paula turned out to be very
  charming and full of fun, so I grew to enjoy their company. Some of the other
  tenants came over; mostly to tell how satisfied they were with their flats
  and the facilities the place had to offer. One of the young men remarked that
  he'd noticed strangers using tennis-court and swimmingpool, one of them apparently
  a slave, something he found unusual. I told him that Dan was a friend of mine,
  who had free access at any time, and that if he wanted his slave as a tennis
  partner and allowed him to cool off in the pool afterwards, he had my blessings.
  A girl complained that the slaves, who were renovating the garden cottage,
  had refused to wash her car. That gave me an opportunity to make it known that
  the boys were free employees of mine and, although expected to treat my tenants
  with proper respect, not obliged to take orders from them. &quot;You could
  try asking how much they charge for a car wash. I'm sure they'll do a good
  job&quot;. She looked startled and mumbled something about borrowing her neighbour's
  boy.  
I was contemplating leaving the party, which was becoming a bit noisy, when
  loud laughter at the other side of the pool caught my attention. Two naked
  slavegirls were tied across a couple of small tables, arses high and ankles
  lashed to table legs. A third, likewise naked girl was tied kneeling upright
  against a pole. &quot;What's going on?&quot; Charlie sent a disgusted look
  at the scene. &quot;Preparations for a slaverace, time we leave&quot;. &quot;A
  slaverace, what's that?&quot; &quot;Drunken 'fun', for the masters and mistresses
  that is. They send the slaveboys for a run a number of times around the building.
  The losers, usually the last three, are paddled or whipped, the winners, another
  three, are 'rewarded' with a free fuck of the two girls, arse and cunt, or
  a blowjob from the third&quot;. &quot;Out here, for all to see?&quot; &quot;Disgusting!&quot;,
  Jane spat, &quot;And so humiliating for the slaves, who haven't any choice
  but to obey&quot;. I rose and Tim jumped up to follow, when I happened to look
  at Charlie's slave, a younger version of himself, and Paul's, who was slender,
  but seemed wiry, with very long legs, and got an idea. &quot;Why don't we enter
  our boys for the race?&quot; Jane gave me a sour look. &quot;You can't mean
  that!&quot; &quot;Yes I can, but let's try changing the 'fun' a bit&quot;.
  I explained and the four others readily agreed when they grasped my idea.  
The slaveboys were running naked, of course, and had their hands tied behind
  their backs. Their owners took up positions along the gravel path, where they
  could 'encourage' their slaves with a whip as they came by. The race was ten
  rounds and our three boys nodded and grinned, when told what was expected of
  them, while we tied their hands. Actually it was great watching the about thirty
  naked youngsters running all out to avoid the threatened punishment, though
  the pleasure was somewhat spoiled by the row of drunken men who were shouting
  and lashing at bare thighs and arses, as they flashed by. Our boys kept to
  the middle of the field during the first seven rounds and Tim sent me a smile
  every time he went by. On the eighth they'd advanced towards the front, and
  when they passed again were running three abreast a couple of yards in front
  of the others. They won, of course, as I'd expected, and weren't even exhausted
  when they finished by dropping to their knees in front of us. Some of the other
  contestants were gasping for breath and rolling on the lawn with stomach cramps. &quot;Hey!&quot;,
  the most rowdy guy of the party shouted, &quot;Your boy won, landlord. He gets
  to fuck the arse, gonna be a fine show when that black pole splits her and
  she's screaming her head off&quot;. He laughed nastily and pointed out one
  of the tied girls, a petite, almost skinny teen. &quot;Perhaps&quot;, I answered
  coolly, nudging Tim with my foot, &quot;Eager to claim your price, are you?&quot; He
  looked up with a knowing grin. &quot;If it please you, Sir&quot; &quot;But
  will it please you?&quot; &quot;No, Sir&quot;. &quot;Why not, she looks like
  a fine fuck, and you haven't had a girl since I bought you&quot;. &quot;Don't
  want to hurt her, Sir&quot;. &quot;Hey!&quot;, the drunkard shouted, &quot;What's
  this? You just do as told, slave!&quot; He stumbled closer, raising his whip,
  but Charlie caught his wrist in a firm grasp. &quot;Lay off, buddy, don't damage
  John's property&quot;. &quot;But he's spoiling the show!&quot; He wrestled
  free. &quot;OK, then your boy takes the two of them&quot;. &quot;I don't think
  he'd like that?&quot; His slave shook no. &quot;And neither will mine&quot;,
  Paul added. &quot;Aahrg, what's this? Three slave-loving prigs!&quot; The man
  was furious and some of his friends tried to calm him down. &quot;Indeed and
  no proper company for you&quot;, I answered, icily, &quot;So you'd better find
  somewhere else to stay, haven't you?&quot; &quot;What?&quot; &quot;You heard
  me. The estate manager will deliver notice tomorrow&quot;. I indicated a slight
  bow to the rest of the now silent party and left, followed by the twins, Charlie
  and Jane and our slaves. &quot;That was a fine thing, you did there, John&quot;,
  Paula told me, &quot;He's always been such a nuisance. Our Fridays will be
  much better without him as a self-proclaimed leader&quot;.  
I washed Tim in the shower. He mumbled a protest when I took the soap from
  him and began lathering up his sweaty hide. To feel up the hot muscles in his
  strong back, the hard flat stomach and the long, wiry thighs was sheer delight,
  and the slaveboy moaned softly when my hands caressed his cock and balls and
  went between his damp arsecheeks. &quot;Nice, huh?&quot; &quot;Yessir, but
  you shouldn't...&quot;. &quot;Why not?&quot; I squeezed his ballsack gently
  and pressed a finger up his hole. &quot;Who owns this body?&quot; &quot;You
  do, Sir, aargh! Please, Sir, I...&quot;. &quot;Don't you dare!&quot; &quot;No,
  Sir&quot;. He clenched his jaws in an attempt to restrain himself, but his
  long cock was hard as a board and banging against his stomach. &quot;So if
  its owner wants to enjoy his property, a slaveboy doesn't tell him to stop,
  does he?&quot; &quot;No, Sir&quot;, he hissed. I found his prostate and massaged
  it gently. &quot;Siir!&quot; My other hand grabbed his cock. &quot;Very well,
  you may come, since you can't restrain yourself&quot;. I gave the stiff member
  a few hard strokes and felt it convulsing before four long spurts of sperm
  hit the shower wall. Tim's legs gave way and he sank to his knees under the
  still streaming water, breathing heavily. &quot;Gawd! Thanks, Sir, thanks&quot;.
  His mouth was pressed to my feet and a hot tongue licked them reverently. &quot;You
  deserved it, now I've deprived you of an opportunity to fuck a girl. But then
  it's not too late, is it. Would you like a go at Christine?&quot; His head
  jerked up and he stared at me in alarm. &quot;No, Sir!&quot; &quot;No?&quot; I
  asked mildly. The head sank down again and he swallowed hard. &quot;If it please
  you, Sir&quot;. &quot;But it wouldn't please you?&quot; &quot;No, Sir&quot;. &quot;Why
  not, you wouldn't have to hurt her?&quot; &quot;She's like me sister, Sir&quot;. &quot;You
  get on well together?&quot; &quot;Sure, Sir&quot;. Clearly relieved when he
  understood that I had no intention of forcing him, he rose to begin soaping
  me up.  
When I next morning passed the reception hall on my way to visit the wine
  merchant with Fred, the abusive tenant accosted me. He'd apparently already
  been presented with a two weeks notice and was fuming with rage, but at first
  tried pleading that I was being unfair, that he'd been drunk last night and
  had no intention of insulting me. There was no apology, though, and I coolly
  told him that I didn't like the way he behaved and frankly didn't want him
  as my tenant. That made him blow a fuse and tell me what a prig I was, that
  I was already well known in town as a slave-lover, that I wasn't welcome and
  ought to get out fast, and if not, he had friends in the police department,
  who'd make life very difficult for me. With that he stormed off and I was having
  second thoughts. He could very well be right, police harassment wasn't unknown
  and I'd already antagonised two officers. Fred seemed to read my mind and coughed
  discreetly. &quot;Excuse me, Sir. I don't think the gentleman will have any
  luck, if he tries to carry out that threat&quot;. &quot;Why not, he seemed
  very certain?&quot; &quot;The chief of police is Chris' uncle, Sir&quot;. &quot;And
  so?&quot; &quot;Chris' family is very grateful that she has such a kind master,
  Sir&quot;. 'Her mother perhaps', I thought, 'But hardly a policeman, who'll
  have any reason to wash his hands of a niece enslaved for a criminal offence,
  and all that has to do with her'.  
As the tenants had noticed, Dan came over most days for a couple of hard
  games, mostly with Steve as his partner, but sometimes bringing a friend. He
  didn't come up to the penthouse uninvited, but I'd told Reception to inform
  us when he arrived and one of my slaves went down with drinks and snacks, and
  often an invitation for lunch. It angered me to see the state of Steve's back
  and arse, always covered in fresh red welts, but the two boys seemed to get
  on well together, and at least the slave gained some respite when sent to join
  mine for lunch and a friendly talk in the kitchen. It angered me even more,
  when I began attending lectures and saw how some of the students treated their
  slaves. Not all, but the majority brought their own, and the lecture theatres
  were built to accommodate that, with room for slaves to kneel under the tables,
  beside the chairs or to stand behind their masters or mistresses. Most of them
  were treated decently; some even seemed on friendly terms with their young
  owners. I especially noticed that a few of the girls, who had male slaves,
  were very affectionate, allowing them to sit on the floor and often stealing
  down a hand to play with a lock of hair or receive a lingering kiss. 'Well,
  well, slaves have many uses', I thought. Most relationships were like mine,
  friendly, but businesslike, both parties knowing their place and acting accordingly,
  but especially one group of undergraduates was pure sadists.  
Of course Harry Allen was one of the worst and appeared to be leader of the
  ten other young men and a girl. Common among them they kept their slaves practically
  naked. Most of the others followed the normal dress code, a pair of shorts,
  a T-shirt for the girls, often for the boys as well; some were allowed jeans
  or even a skirt. The 'ugly dozen', as I privately named them, kept their boys
  in tight jockstraps, the girls in a diminutive string bikini bottom, no shirts
  and always with their ankles hobbled by a short chain, sometimes their wrists
  chained as well. Of course it wasn't enough that they followed the customary
  two steps behind their owners, they were led around on a leash to their collars,
  or even crawling on all fours. It was a pitiful sight to see Julie scurrying
  after her former boyfriend like a dog, her ample breasts swinging and long,
  fair hair almost sweeping the floor. But that was only part of the routine
  cruelty. Weights or chains attached to their nipple rings seemed to be standard
  and when they had to kneel, it wasn't even reasonably comfortably resting on
  their heels, but upright, hands clasped behind their necks and toes pressed
  to the floor. Standing wasn't much better, ramrod straight, feet spread, hands
  behind neck, elbows back, chest thrust out. Only when they were used as footstools
  did the slaves gain a bit of respite, but, innovative as he was, Harry had
  found new ways of humiliating his girl. Not satisfied with the usual position,
  he made her sit cross-legged on the floor with her back to him and his legs
  resting on her shoulders, and ordered her to take off his shoes and socks to
  lick the sweaty feet. Or she was on her back under his chair, conveniently
  positioned to let him rest his feet on her bare breasts. I don't have to add
  that the slaves' bodies always bore witness to recent punishments. It seemed
  an unspoken code of conduct that whippings or canings would only take place
  in private, but that a public spanking was acceptable. So her former classmates
  had ample opportunity to study Julie's red arsecheeks when Harry took her over
  his knees and smacked them resoundingly.  
He was very friendly, diffident even, when we met, and proudly introduced
  me to his circle of friends, especially his current girlfriend, a rather plain,
  plump girl with bleached hair and too much make-up. The other boys were all
  nerdy types, who didn't look as if they wasted much time on sport, whereas
  their slaveboys seemed carefully chosen for their athletic bodies. Obviously
  their masters got a kick out of humiliating and tormenting boys, who under
  other circumstances would be looking at them with disdain. Perhaps they had,
  they could very well be former schoolmates, just like Harry and Julie. The
  girl had made a similar choice, a long legged black beauty, whose finely chiselled
  face was only made even more attractive by her shaven scull, something I guessed
  her bitchy owner hadn't done out of kindness.  
It was disgusting to watch and most of their fellow students avoided the
  gang, but some seemed to be courting them, laughing at their silly jokes, copying
  their manners, seeking their advice. Probably because the brutes were rich,
  I guessed. Harry tried the same, courting me, and I had to keep myself in check,
  just acted very cool and postgraduate-like to keep him at bay. He had the cheek
  to comment that I was very lenient towards Fred, who accompanied me at some
  of the lectures. I brushed him off with a remark that I'd gained my own experiences
  as a slave-owner and was very satisfied with things as they were. Later I was
  amused to see him send envious glances when Charlie and other senior students
  came up to chat amiably with a mere slave, while studiously ignoring him and
  his friends.  
The lectures from visiting speakers did interest me, not least those at the
  business department and my small circle of friends grew, so I soon found myself
  occupied most of the day. Evenings too, when I entertained guests for dinner
  a couple of times a week or went out. That didn't leave much time for my studies,
  but Fred amended that. He was working constantly, from the slaves rose early
  in the morning to clean and wash before it was time for him to wake me up.
  We usually talked about my day. I gave my orders and he told if any of the
  slaves had done something to earn a punishment the previous day. If he was
  up for one, I usually dealt with it at once, with a paddle or a cane on his
  arse. Christine came to get orders for lunch and dinner and Fred left to do
  the necessary shopping, while Tim bathed and dressed me and I ate my breakfast.
  After that we were off to University, where Fred stayed with me during lectures
  on politics, taking notes while sitting cross-legged on the floor with a board
  on his knees, and otherwise worked at the library. If necessary he went back
  after lunch or else prepared my reading and wrote summaries for me. I suppose
  he spent most of his evenings on his own thesis after I'd dismissed him.  
Not that my other slaves were idle. Now Fred was more or less out of the
  picture, they had their hands full with keeping everything up to the very high
  standard, they set themselves. All of my friends envied me and first Jane,
  then Paula and later a couple of others asked if they could send their slavegirls
  to learn finer cooking from Christine, something I of course agreed to, partly
  for my slavegirl's sake. She saw very few people, shut up in the house all
  day, except the afternoon when her mother would fetch her for a visit. &quot;Fucking
  girls' school, Sir&quot;. Tim grinned, when I asked him how it was with three
  or four females in the house. &quot;Yabbering away all the time, drives me
  crazy&quot;. &quot;Or horny?&quot; Jane's slavegirl was always just in shorts,
  Paula's completely naked. &quot;Aw, Sir!&quot; His grin widened. &quot;I could
  ask for a favour in return&quot;. &quot;Sir?&quot; &quot;The loan of one of
  them as a treat for my good slaveboy&quot;. &quot;If it please you, Sir&quot;.
  His face suddenly turned grave. &quot;And they're not your sisters, like Christine&quot;. &quot;No,
  Sir&quot;. &quot;But it still wouldn't please you. Why not?&quot; &quot;Cause
  they're slaves, Sir, ain't got no choice, like rape it'd be&quot;. I ruffled
  his hair. &quot;You're a good boy, Tim&quot;. &quot;Try to be, Sir, not hard
  with you as me master&quot;. &quot;And your girlfriend down at the cottage?&quot; My
  gardeners worked as satisfactorily as did my slaves. The grounds were in perfect
  order and I heard no complaints from tenants. They'd done a fine job renovating
  the cottage and proudly showed me around when it was finished. A common room,
  four small bedrooms, kitchen and bathroom, sparsely, but adequately furnished,
  a porch and a small secluded garden. I'd hardly noticed them when they came
  up to have their meals with my slaves, just that they seemed to dress like
  them, barefoot and in shorts. When asked if they now could fend for themselves,
  the three boys shuffled their feet and hesitatingly assured me that the kitchen
  was fine for heating burgers and pizzas, but none of them really knew how to
  cook. One of them asked if his sister could move in as their housekeeper, at
  their own expense, of course. I could hardly refuse and earned three relieved
  smiles, four actually. Tim was positively beaming, not least when I asked if
  they'd still allow my slave to spend an evening with them every now and then
  and was told that they liked that very much. Later, when licking my feet before
  I turned in, he admitted that he did know the girl very well, and when pressed
  further, that 'they'd made out some' prior to his enslavement.  
&quot;You mean I fuck her, Sir, but I can't, that'd be statutory rape. Slaves
  aren't allowed fucking free women, Sir&quot;. &quot;Except when ordered, I
  assume&quot;. &quot;Course, Sir, but...&quot;. &quot;If a girl should express
  a wish to borrow you for shorter periods and asked your owner nicely, I'm inclined
  to think that he'd grant it&quot;. Tim stared. &quot;You mean... Oh, Sir! You're
  not just the kindest master alive, you're...&quot;. I held up my hand. &quot;But
  she has to ask and assure me that this won't cause any trouble with her brother
  or the other boys&quot;. &quot;Course not, Sir. We've been... I mean...&quot;. &quot;Lovers
  for some time&quot;. He nodded mutely and bowed over my feet again, covering
  them in kisses. &quot;Good. I'll be expecting a visit then, but just now we
  have some unfinished business&quot;. He regained control and looked up with
  a beaming smile. &quot;Yessir, what do you want to do to me?&quot; &quot;Any
  suggestions?&quot; He hesitated. &quot;You ain't hit me crack more'n once,
  Sir, makes the fucking very hot&quot;. &quot;So I've been told, but it seems
  unnecessarily cruel to me&quot;. &quot;Does hurt some, Sir, but I can take
  it&quot;. He jumped up to fetch a short cane for me and then knelt on the edge
  of the bed, spread his legs and reached back to force his arsecheeks apart.
  I looked at his by now familiar, but always tempting hole. &quot;I don't know.
  How many can you take?&quot; &quot;As many as you like, Sir, but least twenty.
  Got to heat me up real good, Sir&quot;. &quot;And I won't have to tie you?&quot; &quot;If
  you like, Sir, but I can take it&quot;. &quot;Very well&quot;. I flicked the
  cane and hit the inside of his left buttock. &quot;One, Sir. Thanks, Sir&quot;. &quot;Too
  hard?&quot; &quot;Nah, Sir, mebbe a bit too soft&quot;. I swung again and hit
  the other side. &quot;Two, Sir. Thanks, Sir&quot;. The third stroke fell precisely
  along the sensitive skin of the crack and Tim jumped, but continued his calm
  counting. My cock stirred and I swung down with gusto. After the tenth stroke,
  the tortured slave's voice became strained and his fingers pressed desperately
  into his flesh, but he remained in position, even when I after fifteen lashes
  dropped the cane, freed my cock and entered him. &quot;God, you were right,
  Tim. You've never been so hot and tight&quot;. &quot;Tha... Thanks, Sir, augh!&quot; He
  kept his arse open for me, while I ploughed him slowly, savouring the heat
  of the striped hide.  
Part 6  
As much as I found his brother disgusting, I enjoyed Dan's company and he
  mine, I think. The only shadow in our relationship was Christine. He was obviously
  still very much in love and uncertain how to treat her, now she was a slave.
  I tried to ease the tension by keeping her out of the way when he came, but
  sensed that he was disappointed not to see her. I tried to have her serving
  us at table, but that made him embarrassed. I tried to have her in attendance
  when we relaxed on the terrace, sitting on the ground between our chairs. That
  distracted him. I tried to have Tim calling me to the phone, leaving them alone
  together for twenty minutes while observing discreetly from my bedroom window.
  They did exchange a few words, or rather Dan said something and she nodded,
  and he tentatively stroked her hair, only to make her stiffen. Finally I invited
  him up one afternoon after a game to let him find his naked girlfriend serving
  as my footstool, locked in the stocks. Her head was towards me, my feet resting
  on her back. He almost left on the spot, but with an effort limited himself
  to giving me a baleful glance and sat down, carefully averting his eyes. Steve
  knelt beside him, staring fixedly at the ground. &quot;Angry with me?&quot; He
  shook no, but kept his eyes averted. &quot;I'm happy to hear that. Christine
  dropped a bottle of my very best Chablis at lunch. This is her punishment.
  Do you find it excessive?&quot; &quot;No, of course not&quot;. &quot;Good&quot;.
  I changed the subject and we talked for an hour. Dan tried hard not to look
  at the tempting globes in front of him and the girl's exposed sex, but couldn't
  resist letting his eyes stray that way every now and then.  
&quot;Do you fuck your slavegirls?&quot; I suddenly shot at him. He blushed. &quot;Eh,
  I... Yes, I do&quot;. &quot;And enjoy it?&quot; &quot;Why're you asking?&quot; His
  voice had an angry edge. &quot;Because I want to know if you consider it wrong&quot;. &quot;I
  don't&quot;. &quot;Even if the girls have no choice in the matter&quot;. &quot;They're
  slaves, convicts&quot;. &quot;And I suppose that you treat them kindly, unlike
  certain others&quot;. He didn't answer. &quot;Do you hurt them, tie them up,
  spank them or whip them, when they're in your bed&quot;. &quot;No!&quot; Now
  he was angry. &quot;I'm sorry, Dan. I have no intention of insulting or angering
  you by my questions, but they do have a purpose&quot;. He stared, then looked
  at the chained girl and up at me again. &quot;Quite&quot;, I confirmed, &quot;I'll
  offer you the use of my slavegirl&quot;. &quot;I don't want her!&quot; &quot;Yes,
  you do. You love her, you're miserable every time you see her and just as miserable
  when not&quot;. He opened his mouth to protest. &quot;And so is she. I can't
  have that, it's cruel to you, and what's more, it's cruel to Christine. I don't
  treat my slaves cruelly&quot;. &quot;You don't, but...&quot;. &quot;Hear me
  out. I'm not suggesting that you grab her, throw her on a bed and fuck her
  brains out. Even if I'm not sure that she wouldn't enjoy it&quot;. I felt her
  back trembling under my feet. &quot;No, what I suggest is that you meet on
  equal terms, talk about what has happened, renew your friendship, forget your
  misery. After that, if both of you&quot;, I emphasised 'both', &quot;want it,
  you may end up in a bed&quot;. He blushed furiously and shook his head. &quot;And
  you'll not be fucking a slavegirl, but you beautiful beloved, who'll be just
  as happy as you&quot;. He shook no. &quot;Yes. Can you dine with me tonight?&quot; &quot;I...
  Yes, thank you&quot;. &quot;Good&quot;. I rose. &quot;Come back at eight&quot;.  
When he arrived, as always with Steve in attendance. I told him to leave
  his slave with mine and led him down to the next floor, where the evicted tenant's
  flat was still unoccupied. I'd planned using it when my father or mother came
  for a visit, and had it redecorated. When a bewildered Dan entered the parlour,
  he found his girlfriend beside a well-laid table, with fresh flowers and lighted
  candles. His girlfriend, yes, not a barefoot slavegirl in shorts. She wore
  a long, white, sleeveless summer dress, I'd bought her, and under that the
  finest lace underwear I'd been able to find, and a pair of high heeled sandals,
  with thin straps across her toes and around her slim ankles, leaving her practically
  barefoot. She'd groomed herself, set her hair and used the make up I'd given
  her. Only the ring around her neck revealed her status. Dan stopped abruptly
  when he caught sight of her and she almost dropped to her knees, but indicated
  a small curtsy instead, smiling shyly. &quot;Your hostess for tonight, my friend,
  enjoy your dinner&quot;. I touched his shoulder and left.  
I was on the terrace, discussing my, or rather our project with Fred when
  Dan returned. &quot;Good dinner?&quot; I called with a smile. He looked gravely
  at me, took a step forward and made to drop to his knees. &quot;Don't!&quot; I
  stopped him with a raised hand. &quot;And don't thank me for doing a friend
  a favour&quot;. &quot;But I, we...&quot;. &quot;Are happy, just like me, so
  you've no need to be grateful&quot;. He shook his head and mumbled something. &quot;And
  this was only the first of your weekly dinner dates&quot;. He stared. &quot;Weekly?&quot; &quot;Or
  more often?&quot; He shook no and turned away to wipe his eyes. &quot;Good,
  just tell Fred in advance and it'll be arranged&quot;. &quot;John, I...&quot;. &quot;Am
  too upset just now, so good night&quot;. I rose to give him a hug and steer
  him towards the door. He stumbled away and I sat down again. &quot;A glass
  of champagne in honour of our young lovers, Fred&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;.
  He disappeared for a moment, then came back, without the glass. I was about
  to ask why when it appeared beside me, offered by trembling hands. Christine
  was kneeling beside my chair, naked. &quot;Thank you&quot;. I took the glass
  and sipped, then raised her head to meet her teary eyes. &quot;Happy?&quot; &quot;Yes,
  Sir&quot;, she whispered. &quot;Did your friend like the underwear?&quot; I
  smiled teasingly. &quot;He didn't see it, Sir&quot;. &quot;You just talked
  and held hands?&quot; &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. &quot;Well, perhaps next time.
  I did choose it with care&quot;. &quot;Next time, Sir?&quot;, she whispered. &quot;I
  want you to host a weekly dinner for my friend, Dan&quot;. Her eyes brimmed
  over and large tears were running down her cheeks when she bowed to kiss my
  shoes. &quot;You may leave now&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. She didn't move. &quot;May
  I serve you tonight, Sir?&quot; &quot;To show your gratitude. No, you may not&quot;. &quot;No,
  Sir. Good night, Sir&quot;. She kissed my shoes again and left.  
Tim looked up from my feet. &quot;You have me hide, Sir, but I've got to
  say again that you're just so great, the best master in this world&quot;. &quot;Because
  I let one of my friends borrow my slavegirl?&quot; &quot;Aw, Sir, 'tis not
  like that. She's so fucking happy, never seen no one so happy, less it's meself,
  Sir&quot;. His girlfriend did show up a few days after he and I had our little
  talk. A fair and pretty, petite girl, about half Tim's size. She was shy, of
  course, hesitatingly stating her business, but soon composed herself and impressed
  me with her calm self-assurance when questioned about her life. She'd had to
  leave high school because she couldn't afford the fees, but had tried to continue
  her education on her own, reading voraciously and using the facilities at the
  local library. Tim served us a bottle of wine and knelt by my chair like a
  good slave, but had trouble keeping his eyes to the floor. His pride was so
  obvious that it was almost comical. Of course I promised that she could borrow
  my slave one or two evenings a week, for whatever service she might need, but
  added an offer of a job as manager of the reception. Not that I was dissatisfied
  with the service-company's slaves and they'd continue doing most of the work,
  but a competent, and pretty, head-receptionist would be an asset, especially
  a free girl, whom the tenants had to treat politely. Some of them were rather
  brusque and demanding when dealing with the house slaves. She thought it over
  and accepted, provided that it was made clear that she'd be in charge and only
  answering to me. Like with her housemates, it worked well, so well in fact
  that I put her in overall charge of the day to day running of the estate, including
  the gardeners.  
&quot;You serve the young lady well?&quot; He grinned hugely. &quot;Do me
  best, Sir&quot;. &quot;And you take care?&quot; &quot;Yeah, condoms are so
  damned expensive, Sir, but there are other ways of pleasing a mistress&quot;. &quot;Ask
  Fred to buy some, for you and for Christine. We can't afford any mishaps, can
  we now?&quot; &quot;Aw, Sir, you're so kind&quot;. &quot;When I'm beating and
  fucking you?&quot; &quot;We're your slaves, Sir, luckiest slaves in the world.
  Least I ain't never heard about no better master, but lots of much worse, like
  Steve's, not Master Dan, but...&quot;. &quot;You like him?&quot; &quot;Steve?
  Great guy, Sir, but he's going down, won't be much left of him when he's released.
  Bloody shame it is&quot;. &quot;Perhaps. He does seem a good sort, but can't
  be, really. Selling drugs is a very serious crime, in my opinion almost as
  bad as murder&quot;. &quot;Sure, Sir, but he didn't sell no drugs&quot;. &quot;He
  was found in possession of a fair amount of it&quot;. &quot;Maybe, Sir, but
  he was no dealer&quot;. &quot;What do you know about that?&quot; He looked
  down. &quot;Just something we know, Sir&quot;. &quot;You and your friends.
  So you are criminals after all?&quot; &quot;No, Sir, but guys like us, we hear
  things&quot;. &quot;I see, and you know this for a fact?&quot; &quot;We do,
  Sir. The drug business in this town's run by a black gang and Steve's white.
  They'd never allow a guy like him on their turf&quot;. I looked searchingly
  at him, but found only honest conviction. &quot;But it couldn't be for his
  own use. Not a footballer like him&quot;. &quot;Someone framed him, Sir&quot;. &quot;Perhaps,
  yes, you could very well be right. Those drug dealers, to get rid of a competitor&quot;. &quot;No,
  Sir. They'd kill him as a warning to others&quot;. He went to work on my feet
  again while I digested this new development. Of course there could be no doubt
  about who'd framed Steve, if Tim was right, and probably Julie as well. The
  more I thought about it, the more I believed that was what had happened, but
  what could I do about it? There was no evidence; just a suspicion based on
  the word of a slave and the fact that Harry hated the two of them. It proved
  absolutely nothing, but the thought kept nagging me.  
&quot;Augh!&quot; Tim's right foot jerked. As so often before he was on my
  bed, wrists tied to the bedposts and legs forced up behind his ears, with his
  big toes lashed to the rail. I was working the hardened soles of his feet over
  with a cane prior to fucking him, but my thoughts had drifted back to the question
  of what to do about Steve and Julie. &quot;Too hard was it? Sorry!&quot; &quot;Nah,
  Sir, I can take it&quot;. I dropped the cane and knelt to ease my cock into
  him. &quot;I know, but this was not a punishment, just warming up&quot;. &quot;Yessir,
  aah!&quot; I took my time enjoying his hot hole, sliding slowly back and forth,
  but once again drifted away. &quot;Argh, this doesn't work!&quot; I withdrew,
  sitting back on my heels and began untying the boy. &quot;Sorry, Sir. Don't
  know what I did wrong&quot;. &quot;Nothing, Tim. I'm just not in the mood&quot;. &quot;Maybe
  if you whipped me some more, Sir? Or I can get Fred&quot;. &quot;No, fetch
  me a glass of wine. You can suck me&quot;. &quot;Yessir&quot;. He hobbled out
  on his undoubtedly aching feet.  
The problem kept nagging me. I had to do something about it, if only for
  my own sake. The first logical step was to get in closer contact with Harry
  to see if I could detect something to sustain my suspicions. I'd kept my distance,
  declined several invitations for lunch or dinner from the Allens, but politely,
  and the loathsome boy was always eagerly seeking my company, so a couple of
  days later I joined him and some of his cronies during a break between lectures.
  Like other groups of students they'd found a spot in the shade. All of them
  were drinking beer and some were having a smoke. The young masters and the
  mistress, of course. Their slaveboys were exercising. Just when I strolled
  over they were doing push-ups. &quot;Fifty-two. Come on, you can do better
  than that, you lazy good for nothings!&quot; Harry's girlfriend strode up and
  down the row of near-naked boys, slashing at their exposed buttocks with a
  riding crop. &quot;Hello, John, can I offer you a beer?&quot; Harry jumped
  up with a broad grin on his dark face and I saw that he'd been sitting on Julie's
  bare back. The girl was on all fours, visibly trembling with strain. &quot;No,
  thanks. Tim!&quot; &quot;Yessir&quot;. My slave spread a blanket and worked
  the cork from the chilled bottle of white wine he had ready in a basket, filled
  a glass and offered it to me. &quot;Sixty-eight&quot;. The crop danced on another
  bum. &quot;Would you like a glass of wine?&quot; I called to stop the cruelty.
  Her plain face lit up. &quot;Why, yes, thanks&quot;. She came over to offer
  her hand and I indicated that she could sit down beside me. She waved impatiently
  at her slavegirl, who was on her hands and knees beside Julie, obviously used
  as another stool. The near naked girl crawled to the blanket and turned on
  her back beside me, raising her knees. Her mistress flopped down on the slavegirl's
  stomach, resting her back on her thighs, and accepted the glass Tim was offering.
  He kept his eyes to the ground, but his rigid stance revealed his anger. 'You're
  right, my boy, she's a bitch', I thought. Harry hesitated for a moment, apparently
  contemplating using his girl in the same way, but thought better of it. &quot;My
  beer!&quot; He snapped his fingers and Julie scurried over with a can. The
  other boys, who were sprawled on the grass, raised theirs in salute, but kept
  silent, used to letting Harry take the lead. &quot;You can stop that, slaves,
  and take a tour around the compound&quot;, he called. The sweaty boys jumped
  up to shuffle away as fast as the short chains hobbling their ankles allowed. &quot;Good
  for them&quot;, Harry sneered, &quot;Resting all day at lectures&quot;.  
We chatted for a while and the bitch asked about my country, where to go
  and what to do if one wanted to party. Her slavegirl must have found breathing
  difficult with the plump weight on her stomach and it got worse when her mistress
  kicked off her sneakers and waved her sweat soaked socks in her face. The bald
  girl raised her head to haul them off with her teeth and begin washing the
  bared feet with her tongue. I shuddered inwardly, but kept calm and answered
  her stupid questions as amiably as I could. Julie was on her knees beside her
  master, head hanging, obviously in very bad shape. The slaveboys came back,
  only to be sent for another round. &quot;Thanks, John&quot;. The bitch beamed
  at me. &quot;I'm off in a week for a six months stay and I sure don't want
  to miss any fun&quot;. She rested her cleaned foot on the licking girl's breast
  while the other was washed. &quot;My dad's such a miser, won't give me the
  pocket money I need, so I have to sell this ugly slut. Can't bring her with
  me anyway, they don't keep slaves over there, do they?&quot; I could only confirm
  that. &quot;Silly! They're so convenient, but at least I can raise some cash
  on her. She was birthday present from my grandmother. I've had her for a year,
  so she's well trained by now. Should fetch me about twenty grand at auction,
  but I've been trying to sell her privately to save the commission. No luck,
  though, ugly as she is&quot;. She caught one the girl's nipple rings on her
  pinkie toe and hauled. The slavegirl winced with pain, but continued sucking
  the toes of her mistress' other foot. &quot;Wouldn't she be something for you,
  John?&quot; Harry interrupted. &quot;She's a great cocksucker, takes it all
  the way down without gagging and it's great fun whipping those boobies. She
  can stand a lot of pain, never screams until after she's got at least thirty,
  and with a crop&quot;. I was about to decline the offer when I to my utter
  surprise heard Tim whispering, &quot;Please, Sir, please, please!&quot;, in
  my ear and changed my mind. 'He really must have a very serious reason to dare
  making demands of his master', I thought. &quot;Well, perhaps I could use another
  slavegirl&quot;. &quot;Yess!&quot; The bitch jumped up and kicked her. &quot;Get
  up to let Master John have closer look, you lazy slut&quot;. The black girl
  rose and untied the strings to remove her only garment, a small triangle of
  white cloth, which barely covered her sex, clasped her hands behind her neck
  and spread her incredibly long legs as far as her ankle chain allowed. Four
  rings pierced her pussy lips, each pair locked with a brass padlock. &quot;Not
  bad is she, for a slum girl?&quot; Her mistress slapped her ample, but firm
  breasts and reached down to jingle the locks between her legs. &quot;She's
  nineteen, got ten years for shoplifting, nine years left as a slave now. Always
  wet and horny, so I have to lock her up or she'll jump on every slaveboy she
  meets. How about nineteen grand?&quot; She slapped the girl to make her turn
  and bend over. &quot;Fine arse and a real tight hole&quot;. I was just about
  to explode when I heard another whispered, &quot;Please, Sir, please!&quot;,
  and again wondered why Tim was suddenly so daring. &quot;Well, I don't know...
  Eighteen?&quot; &quot;Deal!&quot; The bitch was practically jumping with joy. &quot;But
  I want to test her before closing it&quot;. &quot;Of course, I'll send her
  over first thing tomorrow&quot;. &quot;Better take her with me now. We've only
  got a week before you leave&quot;. &quot;Well... OK, fine&quot;. &quot;If she
  suits me, I'll keep her&quot;. &quot;Great!&quot; Harry looked at his watch. &quot;Time
  to leave for the next lecture. My dad would very much like to see you for lunch,
  John. Are you free any time this week, or the next?&quot; I wondered about
  his pleading, but told that I'd be delighted to come over one day next week.  
The 'dirty dozen' left with their slaves, the bitch without a word to the
  girl who'd been serving her for the last year. She stood forlornly, staring
  at her chained feet, with a leash dangling from her collar. &quot;What's your
  name, girl, and please cover yourself again?&quot; &quot;Nathalie, Sir&quot;.
  Tim was fervently kissing my shoes. &quot;Oh, Sir! Thanks, Sir, thanks a million!&quot; &quot;What
  for, Tim? She can't be your girlfriend, or do you keep a harem?&quot; He raised
  his head, looking at me with tears in his eyes. &quot;She's me sister, Sir,
  got caught stealing food for us, 'cause that bitch of a mother we've got and
  her pimp never gave us nothing&quot;. &quot;I see. That's why you dared making
  demands of your master, was it? You owe me one now, boy&quot;. &quot;Owe you
  me fucking life, Sir&quot;. He kissed my shoes again. &quot;Thank you, Sir&quot;.
  Nathalie dropped to her knees beside her brother. &quot;I'll do all I can to
  serve you well, Sir&quot;. She had a pleasantly deep voice and her large brown
  eyes were looking softly at me. &quot;Of course, that's what all of my slaves
  do&quot;. I rose and Tim looked up at me. &quot;Can I give her a hug, Sir?&quot; I
  nodded and he embraced her, dragging her up and whispering: &quot;He's just
  about the greatest master in the world, Sis, ever so kind, and he doesn't beat
  his slavegirls&quot;. &quot;When you've quite finished fondling my prospective
  slave, you may relieve her of that leash and give her your shirt&quot;. &quot;Yessir&quot;.
  He beamed, whispering: &quot;See, Sis?&quot; &quot;Do we have a key for her
  shackles?&quot; &quot;Guess so, Sir, back home&quot;. &quot;Good, let's go&quot;.
  The slaves hastily gathered my belongings and followed me to the car. When
  Tim had stowed the blanket and basket away in the boot, his sister made ready
  to crawl in. &quot;Hey, we don't do that here. You kneel on the floor, Sis&quot;,
  he whispered. She looked questioningly at me and I nodded her towards the front
  passenger seat.  
Back at my house she hesitated before following Tim into the private lift
  to kneel beside him and I heard a whispered: &quot;We're allowed using the
  lift here&quot;. Upstairs I told Fred to find some decent clothes for her and
  have her unshackled and cleaned up before presenting her to me. &quot;Yes,
  Sir&quot;. I was digesting my lunch when he led her out, now dressed in a fresh
  white T-shirt and white shorts. She was about to kneel, but I stopped her with
  a wave of my hand, and she stood rigidly at attention, wrists crossed on her
  back, bare feet spread and eyes to the ground. 'Beautiful', I thought, and
  motioned her to turn around. Her fit, slim body and narrow little arse looked
  almost boyish. 'Tempting, very tempting'. &quot;Are you a horny slut, as your
  mistress described you?&quot; She turned, but kept her eyes to the ground. &quot;If
  it may please you, Sir&quot;. &quot;So I'll have to keep you locked up or you'll
  seduce Fred, or Tim?&quot; &quot;No, Sir&quot;. &quot;Perhaps not Tim&quot;.
  She raised her eyes to look directly at me and I caught a glimpse of steel. &quot;I
  serve as ordered and do all I can to satisfy my mistress or master, but I'm
  a slave, Sir, not a whore&quot;. 'Submissive, but not broken. Excellent!',
  I thought, but answered, frowning: &quot;Rather cheeky for a slavegirl, aren't
  you? I do punish my slaves when they deserve it&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;.
  She lowered her eyes, but seemed quite unperturbed. &quot;As I think I heard
  Tim tell you, I don't like whipping my slavegirls, but you'll be hurt in other
  ways if you do something to warrant a punishment&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. &quot;Good.
  Now back to your locks. Show me&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. She drew down
  her shorts and took a step forward to present her shaven crotch. The labia
  lips were distorted by the rings and padlocks, which felt quite heavy when
  I weighed them in my hand. &quot;Don't they hurt?&quot; &quot;Not any longer,
  Sir, unless they're pulled hard&quot;. &quot;And that happens?&quot; &quot;Yes,
  Sir. When at home, the mistress locks my leash to the rings and drags me around
  by it. At night I sleep on the floor, chained by them to her bedpost and when
  I'm whipped, she uses a short chain to attach me to a ring in the wall, so
  I have to try keeping very still, Sir&quot;. I shook my head. 'What a damned
  bitch!' I noticed that her clit seemed very large and gently dragged it out
  to find it pierced by a barbell. &quot;And she hangs weights from that, I suppose?&quot; &quot;Sometimes,
  Sir, and a chain with a bell when she goes to a party. The young mistresses
  and masters find it very amusing when I dance for them and the bell is ringing.
  Or bells, I have some in my nipple rings as well, Sir&quot;. &quot;Bitch!&quot; I
  mumbled. &quot;And she lets her boyfriend use you?&quot; &quot;Yes, Sir, and
  other masters, sometimes slaves too. The young masters find it very stimulating
  to fuck me if a male slave has his cock up my arse when they use my other hole.
  He'll be chained spreadeagle on the floor; I squat over him, facing his feet,
  sit down on his cock and am chained on top of him. Then the masters take me&quot;. &quot;They
  do that in public?&quot; I looked incredulously at her. &quot;At private parties,
  Sir. Some of the mistresses have very strict parents and dare not bed their
  boyfriends, so they position us slaves like that. Then a young master enters
  me and his girlfriend straddles my head to be licked. In that way they can
  embrace and caress each other, having sex together without any risk of angering
  her parents&quot;. She looked calmly at me. &quot;Very often they whip us between
  the legs before using me, to get in the right mood, Sir. Master Harold's slavegirl
  is sometimes tied up beside me in the same way and the young masters take turns
  enjoying us&quot;.  
&quot;Good lord!&quot; I was truly shocked at the depravity. &quot;I can
  hardly believe what you're telling me, but at least you may be spared that
  from now on&quot;. &quot;You'll buy me, Sir?&quot; Her eyes lit up and a ghost
  of a smile was playing on her lips. &quot;I may and as you've probably understood,
  I treat my slaves a bit more kindly than some owners&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. &quot;But
  you are my slaves and I expect you to work hard and behave as slaves should&quot;. &quot;Yes,
  Sir&quot;. &quot;I prefer fucking my slaveboys, so I'll probably not use you
  for sex, except an occasional blowjob&quot;. &quot;No, Sir&quot;. &quot;Will
  that be a problem for you?&quot; She looked questioningly at me. &quot;Being
  denied the joys of sex you're used to?&quot; &quot;No, Sir, and I didn't enjoy
  it&quot;. &quot;Not at all? At least you must have got some relief, we all
  need that&quot;. Her eyes flashed angrily. &quot;No, Sir. I didn't enjoy being
  hurt and humiliated, Sir. Not at all, and it didn't give me any sexual relief
  to be humped by a bunch of perverts or lick a smelly cunt&quot;. &quot;Not
  just cheeky, are you, but downright insubordinate?&quot; The eyes didn't waver. &quot;Yes,
  Sir&quot;. &quot;Not even 'Sorry, Sir'?&quot; &quot;No, Sir. You asked and
  I told you how I feel. I hate my mistress and her perverted friends. I've committed
  a crime, been caught and sentenced, so I'm a slave for the next nine years,
  have to work hard, suffer punishment and abuse. I have to serve my owner obediently
  and humbly, and I do. But, Sir, I'm a human being, not an animal. I have feelings
  and opinions. If treated fairly, I respect my owner, if not, I despise her&quot;.
  I had to fight an urge to smile to her. &quot;Quite a handful, aren't you?
  I'm beginning to doubt that you'll fit into my peaceful household&quot;. She
  looked gravely at me. &quot;You're a fair master, Sir&quot;. &quot;And will
  gain a good slave, if I buy you?&quot; &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. &quot;Very well,
  we'll see, but perhaps you need an extra reminder. I'll punish you as I punish
  my other slavegirl, but if you really piss me off, I'll take out my anger on
  your brother, understood?&quot; &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. &quot;Fair enough?&quot; &quot;I'd
  prefer if you whipped me, Sir. I'm used to that&quot;. &quot;But I don't beat
  girls&quot;. &quot;No, Sir&quot;.  
&quot;Good. Fred is head slave and responsible for running my household,
  so you'll take your orders from him&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. &quot;Now
  find Tim and make him show you around&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. She fell
  to her knees and kissed my shoes before picking up her shorts and going back
  inside. My head slave knelt beside my chair. &quot;I've already decided to
  buy her&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. &quot;That ought to make Tim happy&quot;. &quot;Much
  more than happy, Sir. Nat too&quot;. &quot;But it may cause problems to have
  siblings serving together. She or he may resent what I do to the other&quot;. &quot;I
  think not, Sir&quot;. &quot;I hope you're right, but I want to make sure. The
  two of them can serve my dinner and see me to bed tonight&quot;. &quot;Yes,
  Sir&quot;. &quot;You move to the spare bedroom you're already using as a study.
  She can have your bed&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir. Thank you, Sir&quot;. &quot;Now
  we have four slaves you can just give them your orders and use more of your
  time on our studies&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. &quot;And not just my study.
  I want you to finish that thesis of yours as soon as possible&quot;. &quot;Yes,
  Sir. You don't want me serving you?&quot; &quot;In the morning as usual, but
  apart from that, only if I order it&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;.  
He left and was replaced by Tim, who mutely kissed my shoes before taking
  up his position behind my chair. My new slavegirl served tea in the afternoon
  and knelt beside me while her brother left for other duties. They took turns
  serving my dinner and I enjoyed watching the lithe black girl sliding silently
  around, taking short steps as if she were still shackled. When I finally rose
  after having enjoyed the cool of the evening and closed my book with a yawn,
  she jumped up from her knees and followed me to the bedroom, poking her head
  through the door to the hall on the way. Seconds later Tim came running and
  dropped to his knees to relieve me of shoe and sock. His sister knelt beside
  him to take care of my other foot and I was soon sighing with pleasure when
  two hot tongues began washing and sucking on my feet. &quot;Good, is she, Sir?&quot; Tim
  looked up briefly. &quot;And taught well&quot;. &quot;I know what you like,
  Sir&quot;. They finished and undressed me. &quot;Shower, Sir?&quot; &quot;Yes&quot;.
  Tim dropped his shorts and hurried to the bathroom. I followed to dug under
  the pleasantly hot spray and he began lathering up my back. A moment later
  his naked sister was washing my front. Her soft hands slid over my chest and
  down my belly before she knelt to soap up my legs and feet. I wondered what
  came next, but she didn't hesitate a second before continuing with my genitals.
  My cock jerked and stiffened when she cupped her soapy hands around it and
  she looked up. &quot;You want me to suck you off, Sir?&quot; &quot;No, just
  finish washing me&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;.  
They wrapped me in soft towels and hurriedly dried themselves while I brushed
  my teeth. Back in the bedroom I told them to display themselves and keenly
  watched Tim's eyes, while I fondled his sister's breasts and told her to turn
  and bend over, spreading her arsecheeks. &quot;Hmm, nice little hole, don't
  you think?&quot; Not even a hint of resentment crossed his face when he with
  a grin looked down at the puckered entrance. &quot;If it please you, Sir&quot;. &quot;It
  may. Kneel on the bed, show your holes&quot;. There was no hesitation when
  they got into position and I looked from one arsecrack to the next. &quot;Hmm,
  you seem very much alike, but let's see how tight you are&quot;. I wormed a
  finger up Nathalie's tunnel and felt around, added another and tried to widen
  it. Her hands were shaking, but she didn't utter a sound and kept her cheeks
  spread. &quot;Nice, very nice&quot;. I withdrew my fingers to ram them up her
  brother's familiar chute. &quot;She's tighter than you. Perhaps we should make
  it easier for her. Lick her arse, Tim&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. I withdrew
  my soiled fingers and sat down beside the kneeling girl, waving them at her
  face. Without a flinch she opened her mouth to clean me, while her brother
  scrambled on his knees behind her to begin licking the crack she held open
  for him. If I hadn't already been convinced of Tim's unfailing loyalty and
  devotion, I was now, but perversely I decided to put them through the last
  test. &quot;She's ready, Sir&quot;. The grin seemed a bit strained, but it
  was still there. &quot;Not quite. She's a bit too tight for my taste. You've
  better lubricate her&quot;. &quot;Yessir&quot;. He rose to fetch the jelly. &quot;No,
  I want her heated too. Fuck her until you spurt, but hurry, I can't wait all
  night&quot;. His jaw dropped and the girl went rigid, but his hand shot down
  to grab the flaccid cock and begin stroking it hard. He kept staring at me,
  trying to plead with his eyes, but when I just looked impatiently back, he
  sighed deeply, lining up the large member to plunge in. Just when the head
  touched the entrance, I held up my hand. &quot;You can stop that, I've changed
  my mind. Better the hole I know than one that may hurt me&quot;. I'd never
  seen a wider grin on Tim's face than when he with a sigh of relief took a step
  back. &quot;Yessir, and I get the whip so you can heat it up real good&quot;.
  His sister went limp and slumped forward, burying her face in her trembling
  hands. &quot;No, just a good long fuck, Tim. You may leave now, girl&quot;.
  I gave her arse a light slap and she rose, but stumbled and dropped to her
  knees. &quot;And I'll buy you&quot;. &quot;Thank you, Sir, thank you!&quot; She
  was covering my feet in kisses, not because of my latest announcement, I don't
  think. &quot;No need. As you may have guessed, this was a test of your obedience,
  which you passed. Can you remove her pussy rings and the padlocks, Tim, or
  do we have to call a doctor?&quot; &quot;I can do it, Sir. Just cut them open&quot;. &quot;Do
  that tomorrow, then&quot;. &quot;Yessir&quot;. &quot;Thank you, Sir&quot;.
  She kissed my feet again, rose gracefully, gathered her clothes and left while
  I turned to her naked brother. &quot;On your back, I think&quot;.  
Nathalie was a delightful addition to my household, a perfect slavegirl.
  I'd never had any reason to complain about the way my flat looked, but after
  a few days sensed that a new hand had taken over. The hand of a girl who knew
  how to add that little extra which made everything just right. Delicate flower
  arrangements, a chair moved here and a table there, small things, but noticeable.
  Christine had always concentrated on her cooking and was much too shy to make
  changes without being told. I wondered how Nathalie, a girl from a poor and
  abusive family, had gained such skills. 'Must have been born with them', I
  thought and she didn't hesitate making use them. Not that she was offending
  in any way, far from it. She was submissive, completely absorbed by her present
  task, to make me comfortable, but not subdued like Christine. In spite of the
  harsh treatment she'd suffered during her first year as a slavegirl, she wasn't
  broken. Like her brother, and Fred, she kept her own counsel, but where Tim
  was cheerful, almost cocky, and Fred calm, undisturbed, she was dignified,
  kept her head high, in spirit and body. To watch her sliding gracefully around,
  kneel down in one fluent motion to serve me, even washing the floors or dusting
  the shelves, was like looking at a piece of art. And she knew it, loved showing
  off her beautiful body, feeling my admiring eyes upon it. Not that she tried
  to seduce me, offer herself, gain my favour, but she knew what she had and
  was proud of it.  
She could turn even a punishment into a victory. A few days after I'd bought
  her Fred reported that both of my girls had to be chastised. &quot;But I can't
  use more than one footstool!&quot; I eyed the two naked beauties standing behind
  him, hands clasped on their backs and heads bowed. Fred looked flustered. &quot;No,
  Sir&quot;. &quot;So what do I do about the other offender?&quot;. &quot;I,
  eh&hellip;&quot;. &quot;Can I suggest something, Sir?&quot; The black girl
  didn't raise her head. &quot;Unless it's a caning&quot;. &quot;Thank you, Sir.
  If you want to use Chris, you could hang me from the patio beam, on my toes,
  Sir&quot;. I eyed her speculatively. &quot;Well, I suppose I could. String
  her up, Tim, and stretch her hard&quot;. &quot;Yessir&quot;. Christine was
  soon bent double in front of me, locked into the stocks, with my feet resting
  on her bare buttocks. Tim returned with four lengths of rope. Nathalie got
  into position, spread her arms to have her wrists lashed to a horizontal beam
  and her legs to let Tim tie her ankles to the supporting poles, stretching
  her magnificent body painfully. And there was no doubt about that. She was
  in pain, very much so. Half hanging from her wrists, only allowed supporting
  her body by the tips of her long toes, she was soon suffering severe cramps.
  Small rivulets of sweat were running down her torso, but nevertheless she didn't
  utter a sound, not even a faint moaning, and kept her head high. I pretended
  to be reading, but of course couldn't keep my eyes from straying to her, admiring
  the display of teenage flesh and, yes, I admit it, enjoying the agony I was
  causing her. Or was I? She was suffering, but that only enhanced her beauty,
  and she knew it. Her eyes held a mixture of pain and triumph, and perhaps something
  else. Was she actually revelling in her pain? I doubted it until I saw drops
  of moisture gathered on her labia lips. 'A natural submissive?' I mused. 'No,
  not submissive, but a strong girl, with a deep urge to be hurt, to find sexual
  relief in suffering'. An hour went by, and another. The body under my feet
  began to tremble and Christine's breath came in short gasps. Her time was up
  and I rose, gesturing Tim to release her, and went over to my new slavegirl,
  running my hands down her body, twisting her nipple rings, pinching her engorged
  clit, finally forcing a moan from her. &quot;You like this, don't you?&quot; I
  kept my voice low, so only she could hear me. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. Her eyes
  caught mine and held them. &quot;A painslut?&quot; &quot;No slut, Sir, but
  being helpless does excite me&quot;. &quot;It turns you on?&quot; She nodded. &quot;And
  is that enough for you. Or should I make Fred fuck you, hanging like this?&quot; She
  hesitated. &quot;If it may please you, Sir&quot;. &quot;But will it please
  you?&quot; &quot;No, Sir. In a consensual lovers' game, it would, but&hellip;&quot;. &quot;Not
  forced by a master, to entertain him?&quot; &quot;I'd be happy to please my
  master in any way he wants, Sir&quot;. I put my fingers to her lips and she
  kissed them softly. &quot;I hope you'll find an understanding lover, once you're
  free&quot;.  
Part 7  
I hadn't come any closer to discovering the truth about Julie's and Steve's
  enslavement and had not much hope that a visit to the Allens would bring me
  any further, yet something had to be done before Harry broke them completely.
  The obvious would be to buy them, but he'd never agree to sell Julie, of that
  I was certain, so I had to try persuading Mr. Allen, who had no special reason
  to please me. The prospects seemed gloomy when two things happened.  
Firstly, my father phoned to tell that he'd pay me a visit in two weeks time
  to stay for a few days. 'Checking on you' as he chuckled. I told him that I
  was looking forward to his check and to have him staying with me. He didn't
  want to intrude on my privacy and suggested a hotel, but I assured him that
  he would find much better accommodation at my house.  
Secondly, I invited two young stockbrokers, who were chairing a seminar
    at University, for dinner. They were about my age and knew my father well,
    not personally, but his reputation as a major player on world markets. Christine
    produced one of her splendid meals and we spent a pleasant evening together.
    Over coffee our talk turned to other well-known businessmen and I accidentally
    mentioned Mr. Allen. &quot;Yeah&quot;. One of my guests looked speculatively
    at me. &quot;Are you a close friend of the family or just a business acquaintance?&quot; &quot;Neither,
    I've just paid him a courtesy visit, now I'm staying here in town&quot;. &quot;I
    see&quot;. They exchanged glances. &quot;So you don't do business with him?&quot; &quot;No,
    my father does, I think. Why?&quot; &quot;Because Mr. Allen is in trouble,
    big trouble. He's made some very bad investments and lost quite a substantial
    sum of money, more that he can afford, so rumour says, but your dad must
    know all about that, more than we do&quot;. 'So that's why Harry was so eager
    to invite me for lunch', I thought, 'His father probably wants to see if
    I can help him, or rather if my father can, and is willing. Interesting'. 
   
  Dinner was as usual accompanied by good wines and I persuaded my guests to
  taste some of the French fruit brandies I prefer with my coffee. They weren't
  drunk but happy and relaxed, and I noticed that one of them kept sending sidelong
  glances at Nathalie. During a break in conversation he cleared his throat. &quot;Eh,
  that's an interesting specimen you've got there, John&quot;. I pretended to
  be confused and looked at the array of bottles &quot;Which one?&quot; &quot;That
  slavegirl&quot;. &quot;Ah! Well, I suppose so&quot;. Now he was openly scrutinising
  her slim body. &quot;Is she as good in bed as she's pretty?&quot; &quot;I don't
  really know. I bought her only recently, but she's an excellent slave&quot;. &quot;Don't
  doubt it, but I'd had her in my bed first thing, had she been mine&quot;. I
  shrugged. &quot;I have other slaves&quot;. He got the message. &quot;Sure,
  and very fine boys they are&quot;. We turned to other subjects and it was fairly
  late when my guests rose to take their leave. &quot;Tim can drive you back
  to the hotel&quot;. &quot;Thanks, John, and for a very pleasant evening&quot;.
  The young stockbroker once again eyed Nathalie. &quot;Now a nice girl to round
  it up, if they have any left on offer&quot;. He grinned to me. &quot;Or can
  I stretch your hospitality a bit further?&quot; &quot;To letting you borrow
  mine? Perhaps, it depends on your needs. I never beat my girls, so if you like
  warming up with a spanking or a caning, you can't use Nathalie&quot;. His handsome
  face lit up in a smile. &quot;I don't, but I do like a girl tied firmly, not
  to hurt her, but to keep her in place&quot;. I hesitated and saw the black
  beauty glance briefly from my guest to me, then lower her eyes with a little
  smile. &quot;Very well then, but she has to be back for her morning duties,
  so Tim can wait with the car until you've finished with her&quot;. &quot;Thanks
  again, John, I really appreciate that. Do call me if you want some good tips&quot;. &quot;Or
  me&quot;. My other guest nodded towards the slaveboy. &quot;If he has to wait
  anyway, perhaps I could borrow him for an hour or two?&quot;   
&quot;Did he treat you fairly, Nathalie?&quot; She was refilling my teacup
  at breakfast the next morning. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. &quot;What did he do,
  besides fucking you?&quot; &quot;I wasn't fucked, Sir&quot;. &quot;What then?&quot; &quot;Your
  guest tied me spreadeagle on his bed, Sir, face down, and licked my body&quot;. &quot;All
  over?&quot; I raised an eyebrow. &quot;Yes, Sir. He began with my feet and
  licked all the way up to my neck, then down my back again to stick his tongue
  into my crack and lick my arsehole&quot;. &quot;Some people do have strange
  needs, don't they. It must have been weird&quot;. &quot;It felt good, Sir,
  and the master kindly allowed me to come&quot;. &quot;When he licked your arse?&quot; &quot;Yes,
  Sir. Never happened to me before, but it was good&quot;. &quot;Happy to hear
  that&quot;. &quot;Then the master untied me and made me turn on my back to
  be tied up again, Sir, and started all over again&quot;. &quot;Licking your
  body?&quot; &quot;Yes, Sir. Sucked on my toes and licked up to my tits. I,
  eh, I came again, when he&hellip;&quot;. &quot;You came on your nipples?&quot; &quot;Yes,
  Sir, and then when he sucked my clit, and stuck his tongue up my cunt&quot;.
  I looked astonished at her. &quot;Four times! You came four times?&quot; &quot;Yes,
  Sir&quot;. She smiled. &quot;Dear me, what a beast! Not you, but that guy.
  I told him not to hurt you&quot;. &quot;He didn't, Sir. It was just wonderful!&quot; &quot;Yeah,
  she screamed so we could hear it in the next room, Sir&quot;. Tim took away
  my plate, grinning hugely. &quot;Thought he was killing her&quot;. His sister
  stuck her tongue out at him. &quot;So you didn't mind being used, this time?&quot; &quot;No,
  Sir&quot;. &quot;Even if you had no other choice&quot;. &quot;No, Sir&quot;.
  She smiled again. &quot;And he didn't demand anything else?&quot; &quot;No,
  Sir. The master and I took a bath together and he washed me&quot;. &quot;Hmm,
  strange not to seek relief of his own&quot;. &quot;The master said that a beautiful
  body is like a piece of art, Sir. Something to enjoy, not violate&quot;. &quot;True,
  and the other master, Tim?&quot; &quot;Very kind, Sir. I sucked him and he
  flogged me back when I was between his knees and then fucked me. Beat me off
  while he was doing it, he did. Said I was good, Sir&quot;. &quot;And you should've
  heard them bellowing, Sir&quot;. &quot;Aw, Sis!&quot;  
Harry greeted me in the hall when I arrived for lunch, telling that his father
  would be delayed for a few minutes. A meeting with his bankers took longer
  than expected. We went out to the terrace, where two half-naked slavegirls
  as usual knelt in attendance by our chairs while a boy served us wine. I couldn't
  remember seeing any of the slaves before and asked where Julie was. &quot;That
  slut!&quot; Harry sneered. &quot;She's being punished, she and her fuck-boy.
  Want to see?&quot; I didn't, but did want to know how they fared, so I followed
  him to a space behind the garage where a number of wooden posts and beams proved
  that the family's slaves could be punished there as well as in the cellar.
  Steve's naked body was suspended by his big toes from one of the beams, his
  back a horrible mess of red welts. A similarly marked Julie was on her knees
  in front of him, face buried in his crotch. A closer look revealed that she
  had his cock in her mouth. A thin string tied around her neck and the boy's
  arse kept her in place and her hands were cuffed behind his back. Steve's face
  was forced into her groin by the same means. Just as we rounded the corner,
  another slaveboy was directing a stream of piss up and down the two tormented
  bodies. I almost hit Harry's leering face, but with an effort restrained myself
  and just stared. &quot;Caught them kissing and cuddling this morning. Still
  up to their old games, our two turtledoves, so what can a kind master do, other
  than allow them enjoying each other? Warmed them up a bit, with the bullwhip,
  and now they can suck and lick all they like for the rest of the day. The other
  slaves cool them down when they have to piss&quot;. I turned away in disgust
  and headed back to the terrace, where Mr. Allen fortunately was waiting. Dan
  joined us, looking as if hovering between exploding with rage and bursting
  into tears.  
During lunch Mr. Allen kept up a forced conversation, asking about my studies,
  if I enjoyed my stay, if I missed my family. I was still fuming with rage,
  but controlled myself and answered amiably, casually letting slip that I expected
  a visit from my dear parent the following week. That made my host's eyes gleam
  and he urged me to persuade him to accept an invitation for lunch or dinner. &quot;Anytime
  it may be convenient&quot;. I promised to do so and confessed that I was a
  bit worried about the visit. Would my father be comfortable enough? He was
  used to the best of service and I had only my four slaves. Mr. Allen immediately
  offered the loan of some of his. &quot;They're very well trained, the best
  in town&quot;. I pretended to think it over and thanked him, but didn't think
  my father would appreciate that. &quot;He has always warned me against taking
  advantage of my friends&quot;. Mr. Allen assured me that it would only be a
  pleasure. &quot;Thank you, but perhaps you could sell me one or two of them&quot;. &quot;Of
  course, my dear boy, of course. Harold will select the very best and you can
  have them for what I paid for them, even if it did cost me a pretty penny to
  train them&quot;. &quot;Well, thanks again, but I'd very much like some I already
  know. Steve and Julie will suit me fine, I think&quot;. &quot;They're not for
  sale, ever!&quot; Harry hissed vehemently and his father looked uncomfortable. &quot;Well,
  they're what I want, but if you won't sell them, you won't&quot;. I shrugged
  my shoulders, looking directly at the old man. &quot;I just hope that my father
  won't be too dissatisfied&quot;. &quot;No, no, of course you may buy them&quot;. &quot;Dad!
  You can't!&quot; &quot;Shut up, Harold. I'm acting in your best interest&quot;.
  Mr. Allen sent him a furious look and I glanced at his brother, who suddenly
  had a relieved smile on his face. &quot;Julie was a birthday present, you can't
  sell her. She's mine!&quot; &quot;No she's not. I never transferred ownership
  to you&quot;. &quot;It's not fair!&quot; &quot;Why not?&quot; I interrupted. &quot;Your
  brother will lose his slave as well&quot;. &quot;And you can have any of the
  others, Harold&quot;. &quot;Dad!&quot; &quot;Please leave the table, right
  now, if you can't control yourself!&quot; Harry sank back, muttering to himself
  and staring angrily at me. Mr. Allen sighed. &quot;Very well, John. I'll send
  them over tomorrow&quot;. &quot;I'd prefer taking them with me right away.
  There's very little time left to introduce them to their new duties&quot;. &quot;As
  you wish. Make them ready for delivery, Harry&quot;. Dan jumped up. &quot;I'll
  do it, Dad&quot;. He ran off and his brother stormed into the house.  
I suggested that we finished the paperwork right away and Mr. Allen was writing
  me a receipt for the check of $30.000, I'd given him, when Dan returned with
  my purchases. They'd been cleaned and their hair was still damp when they knelt
  in front of Mr. Allen, naked and with shackled ankles. He glanced briefly at
  them. &quot;You've been sold. Mr. Marshall is your new master&quot;. The girl
  may have heard what he said, but the words didn't register. She slumped on
  the ground, forehead resting on the tiles, a picture of utter exhaustion. But
  Steve's head flew up and he stared at me, uncomprehendingly at first, then
  with an expression of gratitude I'll never forget. &quot;Help Julie to my car&quot;. &quot;Yes,
  Sir&quot;. He scuttled forward on his knees to kiss my shoes, then rose to
  drag the bewildered girl with him, whispering: &quot;Let's get out of here&quot;.
  They disappeared round a corner while I stayed on for another half hour, discussing
  stock market techniques with Mr. Allen before thanking him for his kindness
  with a promise to persuade my father to come for lunch sometime during his
  stay. Dan saw me out and was fervently thanking me for rescuing of his former
  schoolmates, when Harry accosted us in the hall. &quot;I'll get you for this,
  both of you. You plotted it together. Slave lovers!&quot; He almost spat. &quot;But
  just you wait! I know how to deal with people who try cheating me&quot;. I
  stopped and looked coolly at him. &quot;So, how exactly?&quot; He opened his
  mouth and I hoped that he'd let slip something to confirm my suspicions, but
  regrettably managed to control himself and just sent us another acid look before
  turning on his heel and leave, slamming the door behind him.  
To make sure that Harry didn't somehow manage to make his father cancel the
  deal, I told Tim to drive by the Town Court to make the sale of the two slaves
  official and was signing the register when somebody called my name. I turned
  to find a youngish looking man offering his hand. &quot;Hello, Mr. Marshall,
  happy to meet you at last&quot;. I guessed that he in spite of his youth must
  be Christine's uncle. &quot;How do you do, Chief, my pleasure&quot;. His handshake
  was firm and his smile open and friendly. &quot;Can you spare me a moment,
  Mr. Marshall?&quot; &quot;John, please. Yes, of course&quot;. He ushered me
  to a spacious office on the next floor and asked me to take a seat. &quot;Mr.
  Marshall, my family&hellip;&quot;. I interrupted him. &quot;John, please, and
  there's no need to thank me. I've already told your sister that Christine serves
  me admirably. I actually consider myself lucky to own her, but she is my slave
  and treated as such&quot;. &quot;Please hear me out, Mr. Marshall. Chris has
  always been my favourite niece and I was devastated when she was caught stealing
  and subsequently enslaved. To see the little girl I've loved, played with,
  watched growing into a fine young woman, suddenly turned into a naked slave
  in chains, worked to exhaustion, whipped, used as a sex-toy by some dirty old
  man or a sadistic teenager was unbearable, even to think of. I've been chief
  of police in this town for about three years now, the youngest ever. I've done
  a good job and I'm proud of it, but was ready to quit and leave town to avoid
  meeting Chris as she would be now, a miserable, barefoot slavegirl, in the
  street, a shop, at a party, perhaps even see her punished or abused&quot;.
  He looked gravely at me. &quot;I've been spared that, Mr. Marshall, because
  Chris was bought by a kind and decent master&quot;. I was about to protest
  again when the door was opened and a barefoot girl in a crisp blue tunic entered
  with a tray. She knelt to offer us two cups of coffee and my host sent her
  a smile. &quot;Thank you, dear&quot;. She smiled back, rose gracefully and
  left. &quot;So thank you, Mr. Marshall. I owe you more than I can ever repay&quot;.
  He saluted me with his cup. &quot;You owe me nothing, Chief. Firstly, I didn't
  buy Christine. She was already part of the furniture when I took over my house.
  Secondly, she's a model slave, as I've already said, and rarely gives me any
  reason for punishing her, but I do it when necessary. And thirdly, I'm not
  that kind and decent. My slaveboys would tell you otherwise, I'm sure&quot;. &quot;That's
  not what I've heard, Mr. Marshall, but my concern is for Chris. Of course you
  punish her, she's your slave, but not excessively and only with just cause,
  and you don't abuse her sexually&quot;. &quot;I prefer my boys, Chief&quot;. &quot;Perhaps,
  but still, and you've allowed her to spend time on her own, with her family
  and her boyfriend&quot;. &quot;I've let a friend borrow my slavegirl. Is that
  particularly decent?&quot; He looked gravely at me. &quot;You know it is, Mr.
  Marshall, but I won't argue with you, just repeat that I am in your debt&quot;.  
&quot;We can't agree on that, Chief, but now that you mention Dan&quot;.
  I told how I suspected that Harry had framed his former friends and about his
  recent threats. &quot;You don't surprise me, Mr. Marshall. We've been keeping
  an eye on young Harry Allen and his cronies for some time, especially the rather
  wild parties they seem to fancy, paid a surprise visit to them a couple of
  times, but never caught them actually breaking the law&quot;. &quot;And you
  have to be very careful, because they come from rich and influential families&quot;.
  He nodded. &quot;We have, but we're always careful, Mr. Marshall&quot;. &quot;I
  don't doubt it, but it's easier to catch a poor kid&quot;. &quot;Perhaps because
  they break the law more often&quot;. &quot;Perhaps, but what about Harry's
  threats? It's easy enough for me, he has no access to my house and I'll never
  leave my car unattended, but if he plants something on Dan?&quot; &quot;Let
  him try, Mr. Marshall. Now you've told about his dirty tricks, we'll conduct
  a very thorough investigation, should someone tell us that Dan has entered
  the drug market. There are such things as forensic evidence. Just warn the
  young man never to handle or just touch unknown packets and his brother may
  end up framing himself&quot;. He smiled thinly and I sighed with relief. &quot;Thank
  you, Chief&quot;. &quot;No need, Mr. Marshall, and don't worry about your car,
  or house for that matter. My men will keep an eye out&quot;. I thanked him
  again and asked if he would like to sample his niece's great cooking. &quot;And
  you'll not meet a barefoot slavegirl in chains, but a charming young hostess
  and her fianc&eacute;e&quot;. He could hardly decline and we agreed to find
  a date in near future.  
Julie still seemed stunned, kneeling on the floor in the back of my car,
  face pressed to the seat and hands clasped behind her back. Steve sent me a
  concerned look before he too lowered his face when I entered. Back at my house
  Tim as usual drove directly to the garage and jumped out to open the door for
  me. &quot;Fetch Christine to the little flat and bring a key&quot;. &quot;Yessir&quot;.
  I told Steve to help his former girlfriend and summoned the house lift. She
  could hardly walk and sank to her knees as soon as she entered. He knelt beside
  her, cradling the abused body in his arms, looking pleadingly at me. &quot;Don't
  worry, she'll soon recover. You first duty as my slave will be to take care
  of her&quot;. &quot;Thank you, Sir&quot;, he whispered and hefted her up in
  his strong arms when the doors slid open. I led them to the flat and its small
  spare room. &quot;Put her down&quot;. I indicated one of the two beds. &quot;And
  run a hot bath&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. He lowered her gently, but she
  cried out when her striped back touched the soft bedspread. &quot;Please&quot;,
  she mumbled, &quot;Please no more, please!&quot; I pushed the boy aside and
  bowed over her. &quot;Never, Julie. You'll never be whipped again&quot;. Her
  eyelids fluttered open and her large blue eyes stared uncomprehendingly at
  me. &quot;Never!&quot;, I repeated, &quot;You're mine now and I don't beat
  my slavegirls&quot;. Tears were running down her cheeks when she whispered: &quot;Thank
  you, Sir&quot;.  
Steve came back from the adjoining bathroom just as the two other slaves
  entered. Christine took one look at her former schoolmate and burst into tears.
  Tim relieved the new of their chains and the boys carried Julie to the steaming
  bath while Christine took a grip of herself and undressed to jump in and help
  her. I went to the sitting room where the slaveboys knelt in front of my chair. &quot;I
  don't think I can tell you anything about myself and my household that you
  don't already know, considering the time you've spent with my slaves&quot;.
  Steve looked up. &quot;No, Sir. May I speak, Sir?&quot; &quot;Go ahead&quot;. &quot;Thank
  you, Sir. We owe you our lives, Julie and I&quot;. &quot;Your sanity perhaps,
  hardly your lives. I can't imagine that Harry could be stupid enough to kill
  you&quot;. &quot;No, Sir. We would&quot;. He looked calmly at me. &quot;You?&quot; &quot;That's
  why we were caught embracing this morning, Sir. Julie couldn't stand it any
  longer. She was determined to kill herself, slash her wrists with a kitchen
  knife. I was trying to persuade her not to, but she wouldn't listen&quot;.
  I shook my head in disbelief. &quot;Had she done it, I'd have followed her,
  Sir&quot;. He kissed my shoes. &quot;Thank you, Sir&quot;. I cleared my throat. &quot;You
  are still that much in love with her?&quot; &quot;I am, Sir&quot;, he answered
  quietly. &quot;And she with you?&quot; &quot;I don't know, Sir, but she mustn't.
  I'll still be a slave ten years after she's been freed. That's no future for
  her&quot;. &quot;Perhaps not, but you'll get a chance to discover your true
  feelings now&quot;. He looked puzzled. &quot;Sir?&quot; &quot;There's not room
  at the penthouse, so you and Julie will stay here in the spare room, and as
  you probably know, I don't take my slavegirls to bed, so if both of you want
  it, I have no objections if you make out with each other&quot;. He stared. &quot;Sir!&quot; &quot;Both
  of you, I said&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. He was still staring, shaking his
  head in disbelief.  
&quot;But I'm looking forward to enjoying your arse&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. &quot;It's
  still virgin, I suppose&quot;. &quot;Almost, Sir. We were taught how to serve
  anally at slave-training, and Master Harold's girlfriend has used a strap-on
  on me&quot;. &quot;While he was banging Julie, I suppose&quot;. &quot;Yes,
  Sir. Sometimes both of them used her and I licked their arseholes, Sir&quot;. &quot;Good
  Lord! What a perverted pair, but then what am I but a perverted faggot, who
  gets a kick out of beating a helpless boy, fuck his arse and stuff his dirty
  dick in his mouth afterwards&quot;. &quot;Aw, Sir. You're no pervert&quot;. &quot;Did
  I hear you asking permission to speak, Tim?&quot; &quot;Nah, Sir, but I gotta
  say what's right&quot;. &quot;Twenty with the crop on your arse tonight!&quot; &quot;Course,
  Sir. Thanks, Sir&quot;. He was grinning hugely. &quot;Perhaps&quot;. I couldn't
  suppress a smile. &quot;Your and Julie's main duties will be keeping this flat
  as perfect as my own and serve those of my guests who may be staying here&quot;. &quot;Yes,
  Sir&quot;. &quot;That will include your former master and his girlfriend. You
  will treat her as a mistress on such occasions&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. &quot;When
  not occupied here, you'll assist upstairs as directed by my head slave. Julie
  can help Christine in the kitchen&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. &quot;But not
  just now. Both of you, but especially she, need some time to recuperate. My
  father will arrive next week for a short stay and I want you fit and ready
  to serve him&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir. Thank you, Sir, thank you&quot;. He kissed
  my shoes fervently. &quot;Thank you&quot;.  
I didn't see much of Julie during their first week as my slaves. She stayed
  at the small flat and I told Fred to allow Christine and Nathalie to spend
  as much time with her as their duties allowed. On the second morning after
  I'd bought him, I was surprised to find Steve cleaning the pool area when I
  came out to the roof garden to enjoy my breakfast. He left his brush and turned
  on his knees, forehead pressed to the tiles and hands clasped in the small
  of his back when I strolled over. &quot;Good morning, Steve&quot;. &quot;Good
  morning, Master John&quot;. &quot;Sir will do, and you don't have to greet
  me like that. Please rise&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. He jumped to his feet
  to stand with his head submissively bowed. &quot;You feel better?&quot; &quot;Yes,
  Sir. Thank you, Sir&quot;. &quot;Show me your back&quot;. His hands flew behind
  his neck and he turned to present the horribly striped skin. Not just striped
  actually, but covered in clearly raised welts, some of which seemed infested,
  probably because his former fellow slaves had been forced to piss on him. I
  let my hand slide gently down his back and saw his body go rigid. &quot;This
  must hurt&quot;. I touched one of the worst welts. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;, he
  gasped. &quot;Why aren't you resting, then, as ordered?&quot; &quot;Slaves
  have to work, Sir&quot;. &quot;Not when incapable&quot;. &quot;But I'm fine,
  Sir, and I feel better when I'm doing something useful&quot;. &quot;So you're
  fit for anything?&quot; &quot;I don't think I can play tennis, not yet, Sir&quot;. &quot;That's
  not what I had in mind. Show me your arsehole&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;.
  He hauled down his shorts, bent over and reached back to spread his striped
  cheeks. &quot;Hmm. Very well, since you are so very fit, you can join Tim in
  my bed tonight&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. &quot;Carry on&quot;. I went back
  to my table, where Fred was waiting to pour my tea and Nathalie came out to
  serve the hot plate.  
In spite of looking forward to a fresh arse I did feel a bit guilty when
  the two slaveboys undressed in my bedroom and Steve displayed his welted body,
  but he didn't hesitate to lie down beside his fellow and have first his hands
  tied to the headboard, then his legs spread and his feet tied over his head.
  A beautiful display of boyflesh, with the additional delicious contrast between
  the black and the white body. Tim was as usual grinning expectantly and wriggling
  his arse. &quot;A bit of warming up, Tim?&quot; I grabbed the small cane to
  flick it at the sole of his right foot. &quot;Aah, sure, Sir&quot;, he hissed.
  The cane hit each foot ten times before I dropped it and knelt to ram my rock
  hard member up the waiting hole. &quot;Please, Sir!&quot; I looked surprised
  at the other trussed up boy. &quot;Yes, Steve?&quot; &quot;Excuse me, Sir,
  but it's not fair&quot;. &quot;What's unfair?&quot; I frowned. &quot;That you
  don't warm up on me too, Sir&quot;. That took me aback. &quot;Don't you think
  you've been punished enough?&quot; &quot;Master Harry didn't whip my feet,
  Sir&quot;. &quot;Perhaps not&quot;. I buried myself in the black arse and Tim
  was whimpering, with lust, I think, while I hammered him mercilessly. It was
  heaven, as always, and I almost lost it, but managed to restrain myself before
  erupting. &quot;So you want a bastinado, boy?&quot; I withdrew my soiled meat. &quot;If
  it may please you, Sir&quot;. &quot;Aw, mate, don't say dumb things like that.
  'Tis not unfair&quot;. &quot;Tim!&quot; &quot;Yessir, but please don't hit
  him, not yet, Sir&quot;. &quot;And if I do need another warming up before I
  fuck him?&quot; &quot;Use me, Sir, please!&quot; I shook no and touched my
  cock to the other boy's almost virgin hole. &quot;Open up, boy!&quot; &quot;Yes,
  Sir&quot;. I pressed forward and felt him relaxing his sphincter to let me
  in. &quot;Good heavens, but you're tight!&quot; &quot;Sorry, Sir&quot;. &quot;Don't
  be&quot;, I moaned, &quot;But perhaps we should have lubricated you a bit first&quot;.
  Even wet with Tim's arsejuices, I made slow progress up the incredibly narrow
  passage, but finally my balls touched Steve's striped cheeks. &quot;Aah, I
  think I'll rest here for a while&quot;.  
I did, while my throbbing member got adjusted to the warm chute, looking
  down into the raped boy's eyes. They were calmly returning my gaze, but I thought
  to read something deep down. Pain? Perhaps. Resentment, hate? Definitely not.
  Submission? Not that either. Sorrow it was. The unjustly enslaved boy must
  have resented his fate once, but had come to terms with it, and his rage had
  been replaced by a deep-rooted sadness. I felt another pang of regret and was
  about to tell him that I was sorry, when his handsome face suddenly lit up
  in a warm smile. &quot;Good, Sir?&quot; &quot;Very, Steve&quot;. I smiled back. &quot;Thanks,
  Sir&quot;. I moved slowly back. &quot;For what?&quot; &quot;Offering me a chance
  to pay you back, Sir&quot;. My cock pumped slowly and I felt my juices rising
  again, until they spurted into his bowels. I came with a sigh, not a shout.
  Deeply satisfying, but very different from the ecstasy I felt when fucking
  Tim. I stayed inside until my deflated member dropped out by itself. &quot;Thank
  you, Steve&quot;. &quot;Pleasure, Sir&quot;. &quot;Hardly&quot;. I untied him
  and as expected, he immediately rolled forward to suck my member clean of Tim's
  and his own shit. When he sat back on his heels, I nodded to his still soft
  cock. &quot;Definitely not gay&quot;. &quot;Sir?&quot; &quot;You didn't get
  an erection&quot;. &quot;No, Sir&quot;. &quot;So you don't need to come just
  now?&quot; He looked surprised. &quot;No, Sir&quot;. &quot;Just beat off, man.
  The master's so kind. He always allows us&quot;. &quot;Thank you Sir, but I
  really don't need to&quot;. &quot;Julie's enough for you?&quot; &quot;I, eh,
  we haven't. No, Sir, but Master Harold never allowed his slaves any relief&quot;. &quot;But
  I do, so would you please help poor Tim?&quot; The black cock was still waving
  angrily, ramrod stiff. &quot;Aw, Sir, I can do it meself, if I'm untied&quot;.
  But Steve didn't hesitate to follow orders and quickly swallowed his fellow's
  meat, sucking gently. Tim grunted a protest, but couldn't resist and soon cried
  out his joy, while Steve swallowed frantically. &quot;Ooh! Thanks, Sir, and
  thanks, mate&quot;.  
Dan came up for lunch the next day. His former master's eyes lit up, when
  Steve came out to serve a drink, neatly dressed in white shorts and T-shirt. &quot;Good
  to see you again, my friend. You look well&quot;. The tall slave bowed. &quot;I
  am, Sir, very well&quot;. &quot;This brute treats you fairly?&quot; &quot;Master
  John's very kind to his slaves, Sir&quot;. &quot;Unlike some. And Julie?&quot; &quot;She's
  fine, Sir&quot;. &quot;No she's not&quot;, I interrupted, &quot;But at least
  recovering&quot;. Dan's face darkened. &quot;I'm sorry&quot;. &quot;Not your
  fault, but it almost finished her&quot;. I related what Steve had told me. &quot;But
  you wouldn't, Steve!&quot; He nodded gravely. &quot;Yes, Sir. Our only way
  out&quot;. &quot;Except for one other&quot;. He dropped down to kiss my shoes. &quot;Yes,
  Sir, but we never imagined that possible&quot;. &quot;Neither did I&quot;.
  Dan shook his head. &quot;I'll never understand why Dad agreed to sell them?&quot; &quot;Your
  father is in trouble, financial trouble, and hopes that my parent can do something
  to help him. That's why he was prepared to do almost anything to ensure a meeting&quot;. &quot;I
  see, yes, that explains it&quot;. Dan thought the unexpected news over. &quot;Is
  Dad going broke?&quot; &quot;I can't tell you, but his troubles are known in
  financial circles&quot;. &quot;Wish he were!&quot; &quot;You don't mean that,
  Dan&quot;. &quot;Yes, I do. At least it would force us out of that horrible
  house. Harry hates me and he treats our slaves worse than ever&quot;. &quot;Ah,
  yes, Harry. Now I must warn you&quot;. I reminded him of his brother's threats
  and told of my meeting the police chief. He shook his head. &quot;I don't believe
  it. Even Harry couldn't be that bad. I'm his brother, for God's sake&quot;. &quot;Perhaps
  not, but take care anyway. Promise?&quot; He nodded. &quot;OK, but...&quot;.
  We turned to more pleasant subjects and after the meal I sent him down to the
  little flat to enjoy a cup of coffee in the company of his three former schoolmates. &quot;And
  remember, down there they're not slaves, but your friends&quot;. &quot;Yes,
  thanks John. You're a great guy&quot;. When Tim was licking my feet that evening,
  he suddenly looked up. &quot;Scuse me, Sir, but I heard what you said to Master
  Dan&quot;. &quot;Yes?&quot; &quot;His brother threatened you, for real?&quot; &quot;You
  missed a 'Sir', but yes, he did, and I don't doubt that he was serious&quot;. &quot;Shit!&quot; &quot;Tim!&quot; &quot;Sorry,
  Sir, but no one's gonna do nothing 'gainst me master, Sir&quot;. &quot;Thank
  you, but there's hardly anything you can do about it. Just keep an eye out
  and never leave the car unattended&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir. No, Sir&quot;. He
  mumbled something unintelligible and resumed his licking.  
The day before my father was due to arrive I inspected the extra flat. It
  was immaculate, of course, neat and tidy, with fresh flowers everywhere. Steve
  and Julie were looking well, but I asked to see her body. The back had healed,
  but still bore witness of the brutal punishment. &quot;Are you sure that you're
  fit to serve?&quot; &quot;Yes, Sir&quot;. &quot;I could send Nathalie down
  and you could help Christine in the kitchen, take a rest when needed&quot;.
  She shook her head. &quot;I don't know what to say, Sir. You're so kind, so
  kind&quot;. Her voice broke and she swallowed hard. &quot;But I can serve your
  father, I want to, Sir&quot;. &quot;Calm down, Julie. Of course you may serve
  him, but if it proves too much for you, tell Fred and he'll replace you with
  Nathalie&quot;. &quot;Yes, Sir. Thank you, Sir&quot;. Her eyes were brimming
  with tears. &quot;At least you won't have to serve the old boy in bed&quot;,
  I chuckled.  
Of course I should've known better, but one doesn't imagine that one's dear
  parents have a sex life, does one? You know that they must have, at least once,
  but that's just something they did to produce you.  
&quot;I say, John, haven't you changed quite a bit, for the worse&quot;.
  My father arrived rather late and pretty tired, so we'd just had a drink and
  exchanged the latest news, before he retired to the flat. &quot;Dad?&quot; I
  was baffled and must have looked it. &quot;That poor slavegirl, what did she
  do to earn a thrashing like that?&quot; &quot;Slavegirl?&quot; I looked bewildered
  at Nathalie, who was serving our breakfast. &quot;Not her, the girl downstairs.
  I was in need of a bit of comfort before turning in and told her to undress,
  but lost all interest when I saw the state of her back&quot;. I stared, completely
  stupefied. &quot;How could you do such a thing, John. You've always been a
  gentle soul, or so your mother and I thought. Has your new status as a slaveowner
  corrupted you?&quot; &quot;Nah, Sir, 'scuse me, Sir. Master John's the kindest
  master alive, Sir. 'Scuse me, Sir&quot;. As usual, Tim couldn't keep his mouth
  shut, but this time he deserved my everlasting gratitude. My father looked
  up. &quot;He is, is he? Or are you just scared out of your wits?&quot; Tim
  grinned. &quot;No of course not, or you wouldn't dare speak without permission.
  But who whipped the poor girl, then?&quot; I gathered my wits and quickly explained
  about Harry. &quot;I see, young Allen. Well, it's no surprise, I never liked
  him&quot;. He looked up at Nathalie. &quot;So he's a kind master, this son
  of mine?&quot; &quot;The best, Sir&quot;. She looked calmly at him. &quot;Master
  John would never beat a slavegirl, Sir&quot;. &quot;I'm indeed happy to hear
  that, but a slaveboy?&quot; &quot;Aw, Sir. Got to, ain't he, or this lazy boy
  of his gonna get even worse than he is, Sir&quot;. My father chuckled. &quot;If
  your say so&quot;. We returned to the subject of the Allens, and I told about
  the bait I'd used to get Julie and Steve out of Harry's clutches. &quot;Very
  clever of you, John and I shall pay a visit to Mr. Allen, but that won't help
  him&quot;. &quot;So it really is bad?&quot; &quot;Quite frankly, yes. He has
  ruined himself, no one can do anything about that. He may last another couple
  of months, perhaps half a year, but not avoid the inevitable&quot;.  
We spent the day relaxing and talking about old times, the family, and my
  future. Christine produced her customary miracles at lunch and dinner, and
  my father offered to buy her, or rather tried pressing me to sell her. &quot;Don't
  you think you poor parents deserve a bit of luxury, now we're growing old?&quot; &quot;I
  can't imagine you, or Mother, lacking anything&quot;. &quot;We've never had
  a cook like her&quot;. &quot;I know, but you can't have her anyway. She can't
  leave this country&quot;. &quot;Of course she can&quot;. He explained that
  even if it was rare, a slaveowner could obtain permission to take his property
  abroad, if the slaves in question agreed. They'd be equipped with implants;
  one a satellite connected tracing device, the other containing a deadly poison,
  which would be injected if they ran away. He was only half-serious, of course,
  so I talked my way out of it.  
When we were enjoying our coffee after dinner, he nodded at Nathalie and
  asked: &quot;Now I can't use the slavegirl, you've assigned to me, I should
  like another&quot;. I could hardly believe my ears. 'He really meant it!' My
  stupefaction must have been all too plain, because he chuckled: &quot;Shocked,
  son, that your old man is still harbouring a taste for teenage girls?&quot; &quot;Ah,
  no... Damn it, yes I am!&quot; &quot;Why? Don't you consider me a proper man?&quot; &quot;I,
  eh, ...&quot;. &quot;I'm not exactly a relic, you know, even if I may seem
  so to you&quot;. &quot;Of course not&quot;. &quot;And if it's your mother's
  feelings that are troubling you, rest assured. We've never had any secrets,
  son, we share everything, so she knows full well that I use the opportunity
  when over here&quot;. &quot;Ah, yes&quot;. &quot;And approves, John. We love
  each other, would never dream of denying the other anything. So don't be afraid
  that you might let something slip. I'll tell her myself, when I get home&quot;. &quot;I,
  eh, yes. Of course you may use Nathalie&quot;. &quot;Is she any good?&quot; &quot;I,
  eh, yes she is, very good&quot;. I looked behind him and saw the girl looking
  very smug. 'Ah, well, he may be old, but not that old, and quite handsome',
  I thought. 'And you do need a bit of fun, don't you, girl?'  
This time I never dreamt about questioning her, but didn't need to, as it
  turned out. My father was late for breakfast the next morning, and when he
  eventually appeared, sank down wearily on the chair, Fred held for him. &quot;Good
  morning. I hope you slept well&quot;. He sighed. &quot;When I eventually was
  allowed to go to sleep, yes&quot;. I looked questioningly at him. &quot;I asked
  for it, but that black devil almost finished me. Perhaps I am a relic, after
  all&quot;. &quot;Uh, Nathalie, you mean?&quot; &quot;The same. What an inappropriate
  name for a tiger. But you were right. She's good. Fantastic! I haven't had
  a night like this since your mother and I were newly wed&quot;. &quot;I'm happy
  to hear that, I'm sure&quot;. &quot;Stop being prickly, John. You should be
  happy to have given your old man a great gift&quot;. &quot;But I am, Sir!&quot; &quot;Those
  legs, incredible!&quot; He sighed. &quot;And she persuaded me to tie her up!&quot; He
  shook his head. &quot;Never tried that before. Spread-eagle. Hogtied. Legs
  over head. Good heavens! Do you do that, in bed I mean?&quot; &quot;I, eh,
  yes, very stimulating&quot;. &quot;An understatement, I dare say, but I hope
  you can do without her for the duration of my visit&quot;. &quot;Of course&quot;. &quot;I
  promise not to have a heart attack&quot;. He chuckled and Nathalie came out
  to serve a hot plate.  
In the event, he never did visit Mr. Allen. Later that day Dan phoned to
  tell that his brother had been found dead in his car. He'd apparently driven
  it off the road and down a ravine, breaking his neck in the fall. What was
  more, the police found a fair amount of narcotics in the car. The shock, on
  top of his other troubles, was too much for Mr. Allen. He had a massive coronary
  during the night and died two days later at hospital. Dan was devastated and
  I persuaded him to stay with me. My father and I did our best to console him,
  but it was Christine who succeeded. I put him in the third spare bedroom, with
  her of course, and when they eventually emerged next morning, he was almost
  his old self.  
My father stayed to help Dan sorting out his affairs. Mr. Allen was in fact
  broke, but his and Harry's life insurance and the sale of mansion and slaves,
  to carefully selected new owners, brought enough to ensure Dan a comfortable
  life, for some time at least. Luckily one of the larger flats was free and
  he moved in there. I lent him Christine, who from then on just served as our
  cook.  
Some time after my father had left, the chief of police came for lunch. As
  promised, we were four at table, Christine ravishing in a short white summer
  dress and Dan unable to hide his happiness. During a lull in our conversation
  Tim came out to serve another course. The chief looked up at him. &quot;You
  are very devoted to your master, aren't you, Tim?&quot; He bowed, for once
  without his usual grin, rather looking frightened. &quot;Yes, Sir. I'd do anything
  for Master John, Sir&quot;. &quot;I don't doubt it and in a way I'm in your
  debt, but don't do it again&quot;. &quot;No, Sir&quot;. He bowed and disappeared
  hastily. I don't think our two turtledoves noticed anything, but I looked questioningly
  at my guest, who just shrugged his shoulders.  
When I later was alone with him I asked about Tim. &quot;Young Harry Allen's
  death was no accident. His neck was broken long before the car crashed&quot;. &quot;Oh!&quot; &quot;I
  suspect that he was killed because of his amateurish dabbling in drugs&quot;. &quot;I
  see&quot;. And I did. &quot;Quite, but this will go no further, Mr. Marshall&quot;. &quot;Of
  course not&quot;. &quot;As I've told you before, I consider enslavement of
  young offenders profitable, for all parties. Provided, and that's very important,
  provided that slaveowners recognise that their first duty is to ensure that
  slaves are not just punished, but brought back on the right track, ready to
  re-enter the world as good citizens, once they've served their sentence. Few
  people really understand that, but those who do, earn not only the respect,
  but also the love of their slaves&quot;. &quot;I , eh,...&quot;. &quot;Some
  people even understand that an offer of honest work is the best remedy against
  juvenile crime&quot;. &quot;I suppose so&quot;. &quot;So, Mr. Marshall, you've
  won the respect, love, of some of our most troublesome citizens, and benefited
  from it in a rather unusual way. Please continue your good work&quot;.  
Part 8  
Well, that's the exciting part of the story of my life as a slaveowner. The
  rest is rather dull and quickly told. I stayed and went on with my quiet life,
  enjoyed my friends, and, not least, my slaves.  
I never finished my study. The world of finance sucked me in, absorbed me.
  I'd inherited some money from my maternal grandmother and, firstly more or
  less as a joke, tried my hand on the stock market, willingly helped by the
  stockbrokers I'd met at University. It went well, actually more than well.
  Perhaps I've inherited my father's skills. Anyway, after a year I'd doubled
  my fortune several times over, and I just couldn't stop there, I became addicted,
  used most of my time studying the markets.  
After a time that wasn't enough. Earning paper money is fine, up to a point,
  unless you're a compulsive gambler, which I'm not, so I felt in need of creating
  something. What I did seemed silly, as things were, but it was my own money,
  so I gave it a try.  
My garden staff of free slum boys did a fine job. Not that the house and
  grounds hadn't been maintained perfectly by the service company, but they managed
  to add something extra. Slaves are good workers, have no other choice, but
  usually don't invest their souls in the work, why should they? As long as they
  can avoid the whip, there's no reason to overdo anything. But a free person
  wants to show his boss how good he is, and what's more, he's proud of his work.
  I could see the difference, and, more important, so could my tenants, who often
  told how satisfied they were. So I plunged in, started a service company, hired
  a number of homeless boys, and girls, bought a dilapidated house and employed
  them to change it to a sort of dorm for themselves, equipped them with smart
  uniforms and began advertising. I offered the same product as the slave companies,
  at the same prices, but promised more attentive service. My first customer
  was, perhaps not surprisingly, the police. I had my doubts. Potential criminals
  serving police officers! But it worked. My staff really put their souls into
  it and what doubts their former enemies must have harboured, were soon wavered.
  Not surprisingly. They were served better and saw their workload reduced. After
  that success we never looked back. If you have the entire police force of a
  town promoting your company, you can't ask for more. A year later there wasn't
  a single unemployed youth in town and we had to hire staff from neighbouring
  cities. My first three boys were promoted overseers and Tim's little girlfriend
  proved to be a perfect manager.  
Perhaps I became greedy, but my own slaves were soon turning a profit too.
  Nathalie put me on that track. Christine continued her cooking lessons for
  neighbouring slavegirls, even after she and Dan moved in together. She was
  clearly enjoying it and I quite happy doing my friends a favour, until the
  black slavegirl one evening, when she was kneeling beside my chair, suddenly
  mused aloud in the manner of her brother: &quot;Why don't you charge them,
  Sir?&quot; &quot;Charge whom?&quot; &quot;Those mistresses, Sir. They get great
  cooks and don't pay nothing for it&quot;. &quot;But I can't do that, they're
  my friends!&quot; &quot;Yes, Sir, but why not make a proper school, then? Chris
  is a fantastic teacher, she could easily take in a lot more pupils, from all
  over town&quot;. I thought it over and asked Christine's opinion. Of course
  she meekly promised to do her best, but her joy was obvious, so I spread the
  word and in a couple of months we had a waiting list as long as my arm. Julie
  was enrolled to help and my cooking school soon expanded from teaching slavegirls
  to arranging courses for their mistresses, just for fun, of course, but did
  the young things love to show their boyfriends that they had talents outside
  the bedroom. When taking in free girls I made it very clear that if they wished
  to stay on, they had to respect their teachers. Christine and Julie might be
  slavegirls, modestly dressed, collared and barefoot, but when teaching, they
  were the experts. I found rooms in town for the expanding school and only ventured
  in once, to find about fifty happy young women, shrieking with laughter, mistresses
  and slaves mingling effortlessly, and clearly not appreciating male company.  
Steve was next. Dan and he played a couple of matches or three every day,
  most often watched by some of the tenants. That developed into Steve becoming
  a regular tennis partner for a growing number of young men, women too for that
  matter. I allowed it, of course, he had little else to do, and enjoyed it hugely,
  but when we started the cooking school, I thought: 'Why not?', and hired him
  out as a professional coach. Another success, another waiting list, and another
  happy slave. To charge for Fred's tutoring was almost inevitable after that
  and he soon had his hands more than full. So instead of six, I suddenly had
  only two slaves serving me, Nathalie and Tim.  
Owner of six slaves and four of them turning a profit, splendid, for me as
  well as for them. My friends noticed how happy they seemed to be, even if working
  harder than most, but with something that make them feel worth their while,
  something to make them proud. Not that the four breadwinners among them felt
  in any way superior. I rather think that at least the three of them still staying
  with me were competing fiercely to be allowed serving in the evening and that
  Fred had to exercise his authority to deal with that. Neither did they avoid
  punishments. No one is perfect and I had my fill of whipping boys and tormenting
  girls, and of course I had a hot arse in my bed every night.  
If I were neglecting my studies, Fred worked so much harder on 'my' thesis.
  His own was long finished and delivered to me. If he resented his unjust fate,
  deprived of a well-earned degree and 'ghost-writing' for a lazy master, he
  of course never showed it, apparently unshakeable as he was.  
But I did shake him, once. I'd been paying frequent visits to my own country,
  leaving Dan in charge of my slaves, when I well into my second year abroad
  asked Fred and Tim if they'd agree to be equipped to accompany me. Of course
  they did and we left, a master with two slaves, to arrive at my home a rich
  young man with two ordinary servants. I'd removed their collars and made them
  dress decently before we landed. Tim was overawed by my parents' mansion in
  the city and very uncertain how to behave, but Fred seemed as unperturbed as
  ever. Until I brought him with me to a function at my old university. We entered
  the ancient hall to attend a lecture of a Nobel-prize winner, preliminary to
  bestowing new masters' degrees. I kept sending sideways glances to my slave,
  who was sitting stiffly beside me, calmly listening, until he suddenly jumped
  in his seat, staring at the vice-chancellor, who'd just called his name. &quot;Sir!&quot;,
  he whispered, &quot;Sir!&quot; &quot;Quite, slave, get up there&quot;. He rose
  in a daze and almost stumbled towards the dais. The vice-chancellor was droning
  on: &quot;... rare ... very few occasions during the last five hundred years
  ... outstanding work ... no student of this university could have done better
  ... first class honours&quot;. Fred reached him in time to receive a firm handshake
  and his patent as a master of this ancient establishment. &quot;... may not
  be aware of the honour, young man, but from now on you are allowed to cross
  the lawns of the quadrangles...&quot;. The vice-chancellor was actually joking.
  I reached poor Fred in time to cover him with the academic gown, he unwittingly
  had brought with him, and support him before his legs gave way under him. &quot;Fifty
  of the best, if you faint now&quot;, I whispered and put the square cap on
  his head.  
&quot;Sir!&quot; He was on his knees in front of me. &quot;My feet, slave!&quot; &quot;Yes,
  Sir&quot;. He composed himself and relieved me of shoes and socks. Later, when
  I withdrew from his smooth hole, the new Master of Arts, who was tied on my
  bed, legs beside his ears, looked up. &quot;Sir...!&quot; &quot;Congratulations&quot;.
  I freed him and with a sob he rolled up to clean my soiled meat.  
It was unusual and no matter how influential my dear parent might be, only
  Fred's own academic excellence could persuade the ancient institution to bestow
  academic honours on a person, who'd never studied there. I made it quite clear
  that it was not to be mentioned and he understood, but it was a very special
  triumph for both of us, when his, and temporarily my university asked me to
  give a lecture. I arrived in full academic fig to look down at an expectant
  audience. &quot;I am indeed honoured to be called to speak to such an illustrious
  assembly, but feel that my humble achievements are too feeble to justify this
  honour. I've therefore persuaded one of my more scholarly colleagues to take
  my place&quot;. I stepped down to be replaced by another academic, this one
  barefoot and collared. There was a stunned silence and Fred began to speak.
  When he finished an hour later, the whole of the audience, professors and students,
  rose to cheer.  
I stayed my three years, as planned, but was longing to go home. Before that
  I had to decide what to do about my property. The house was easy enough. I
  hired Dan to manage it and my service company as well, offering him the use
  of the penthouse when I'd left. But my livestock? Of course Christine stayed
  with Dan, on loan. She remained my property and my responsibility to relieve
  him of any obligation to treat her as a slavegirl, apart from the formal rules
  of dressing, and she kept running her successful cooking school. Julie and
  Steve had no love of their own country, where they'd been treated so unfairly.
  Nathalie, I think, was looking forward to new experiences, and Tim, yes, he
  was torn between his girlfriend and me, but in the end chose the latter. Of
  Fred there was no doubt, he'd stay with me, whatever happened.  
So here I am now, a happy, and successful, player of the markets, sharing
  a pleasant house in the oldest part of town with my friends. Steve and Julie,
  that is, and Tim and his sister, and his girl. Well, yes, I offered her a job
  as my P.A., but, cruelly, only after Tim had made his choice. Now I wouldn't
  know what to do without her, and they manage very well together, even if Tim
  is a slave and she a free woman. The two couples have their own small flats
  over the mews on the far side of my garden  
Steve spends most of the day at the tennis club as a professional coach and
  tennis partner. Nathalie runs an academy for sophisticated young ladies, teaching
  them how to move gracefully and keep in shape. They need it; my countrywomen
  generally look like dough-faced horses. Julie cooks for us and shares the housework
  with Tim, who takes care of the garden and my cars. The other two serve me
  when home from their jobs. Fred doesn't live here. He finished my thesis, but
  as his own now. He got his PhD and was invited to become a fellow of one of
  the most prestigious colleges at my old alma mater.  
We are still master and slaves, but friends too, and we often dine together,
  during weekends joined by our young lecturer. Yet I do have my fun. Even the
  best of slaves, like mine, inevitably make mistakes or neglect their duties
  and warrant a punishment. Most often Tim is the culprit, but Steve doesn't
  escape his share and even Fred's hide gets striped every now and then. Only
  last night the three of them decorated my livingroom. Tim was dangling from
  the ceiling by his wrists, awaiting the next ten of thirty lashes with the
  flogger, earned by forgetting to weed among the roses in the front garden.
  Steve's athletic body was forced into a very strict hogtie, thin twine cutting
  into his wrists and ankles, and with a large butt-plug rammed up his hole.
  Something he really hates, but then he could have got a move on coming home
  to help me change before dinner instead of dawdling with his friends at the
  tennis club. It was his turn as evening slave. And poor, honest Fred was tied
  bent over a straight-backed chair, displaying his thoroughly striped arse.
  Sometimes he's almost too much, his 'crime' was neglect of duty, or at least
  he claimed to have postponed correcting essays from his students unnecessarily.
  I do wonder if he invents things like that just to be punished, not because
  he likes it, but because he wants to share his fellow slaves' misery. Anyway,
  it was great to see them like that, especially when relaxing in an armchair
  with my coffee and Nathalie locked in the stocks to serve as my footstool.
  She spilled wine when serving dinner. It's an unspoken agreement between us
  that Julie never suffers a real punishment. On the rare occasions when she
  needs a reminder, I make her work naked and hobbled for a day or two  
And if the regular punishments aren't enough, I still have Tim. We've never
  discussed it, but both of us know that he is a masochist, or at least has special
  sexual needs. So does his girl, who perhaps doesn't share them, but calmly
  takes care of her beloved when he returns from my bed, with sperm and shit
  leaking from a thoroughly striped arse. Oh yes, my sex life is as hectic and
  varied as ever. Hard stuff with Tim, quiet passion with Fred on his weekend
  visits, and occasionally a double session with Tim and Steve. Not that the
  latter likes it one little bit, but he knows I do and simply turns up in my
  bedroom every now and then to be tied up beside his black fellow.  
But most nights I enjoy a very different bedmate. A gorgeous strained body
  spreadeagle or hogtied beside or under me, begging to be used and used hard,
  in all three of her holes. Yes, my black tiger has, if not turned me from the
  joys of male/male sex, then lured me back to the 'normal' path. She's so passionate,
  so insatiable, so incredibly lovely that I can't but swallow the bait, hook,
  line, and sinker, every time I find her naked in my bedroom, teasingly dangling
  the ropes in my face. And she has the cheek to do it even on nights when her
  brother is with me, smiling sweetly at his scowling face and grinning triumphantly
  when I give in and dismiss him. If I do, that is. It does happen that I have
  two black bodies trussed up side by side, arms out and legs up, and three tempting
  holes waiting for my attention.  
So, no longer a novice, but an utterly depraved slaveowner, that's what's
  I am now.  
And the future? Is a long way off. Steve and Julie have to stay my slaves
  for five more years, well, he for another ten, but I've already decided that
  the day she's a free woman again, I have a gift for her: One fine male slave.
  On the same day my P.A. will receive a bonus: Another slave to boss around,
  if only for the two remaining years of Tim's twelve. Though I doubt the poor
  boy will ever be free. And perhaps I should consider giving away my third slaveboy.
  Fred is officially mine for another ten years. I can hire him out, as I've
  already done it, though his scholarly fellows would be rather shocked if they
  knew that they had a real slave in their midst, but not free him. A slave must
  have a master, or a mistress, and last time I paid a visit to the university
  I did meet this cute little art historian, who'd been invited to join one of
  the women's colleges and, quite accidentally I'm sure, told me that she'd had
  enough of big hunks of man meat and was looking for a real experienced tongue.  
That would of course leave me to fend for myself, something of which I'm
  quite incapable, but another freedom gift may lift that burden from my poor
  shoulders. I have already bought it, a diamond ring, which will look marvellous
  on a slim black hand, when my fifth slave four years from now, hopefully, agrees
  to accept it in exchange of her shackles. A honeymoon in her old country and
  a visit to a slave centre over there will allow her to choose all the domestic
  help she'll need in her now role as a housewife.
