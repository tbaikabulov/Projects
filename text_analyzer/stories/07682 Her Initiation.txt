Synopsis: 







Hen was horny again, and she would satisfy his need. He didn&#8217;t even need to ask her, he as a man, was well within his rights to demand that she complied, but he found it more thrilling that she would to want to do the things he required of her.

He wandered along the sea front, in hopes of finding her, his thoughts wandered to their previous encounter, his cock twitched when he recalled her lips around him, it physically hardened when he recalled holding her beneath the water, feeling her struggle just momentarily against him, and hardened more when she remembered how she had surfaced seconds later gasping for air, but smiling with her eyes.

He clambered over the rocky headland as his thoughts turned to how he had thrust himself deep inside her until he felt his cock buried deep inside her most intimate place. He reminisced about holding her head as he buried deep into her throat, he brought to mind the moment his excitement had almost become to much and he had been forced to think of other things in order to contain himself until just the right moment. 

As he rounded the corner of the last peninsula on the local coastline, he saw her in the distance; she was knelt beneath the pier, sheltered from the midday sun, plaiting twine to form a rope. Hen felt his manhood swell once more, he didn&#8217;t know what it was about her, but just thinking about her made him hard.

Boldly he walked the expanse of sand, his footsteps almost silent, he remained unnoticed until he was stood behind her. Reaching over her shoulder he took the twine from her hands, he smiled inwardly as she lowered her head almost automatically in order to show the ritual respect that was required of women towards men. 

He took her gently by the arm, and helped her to her feet, she didn&#8217;t turn to face him, and he didn&#8217;t turn her either. Once she was standing his hand slipped down her arm to her wrist, he eased it gently behind her; the hand that held the twine slid down her other arm to that wrist and eased that one behind to meet the first in the small of her back. He pressed them into her indicating they were to remain there, he released his grip and using the twine, tenderly bound her wrists together. Only when he was happy she was secured, did he turn her to face him. 

She looked down to the ground, he placed and finger beneath her chin lifting it slightly to ensure face to face contact. She blushed furiously, men didn&#8217;t usually see the face of women who pleasured them, women where there simply to service the needs of men. 

He looked at her, explored her face with his eyes, her skin was soft and flawless, her hair tousled across it with the breeze. He studied her lips, full and pouting, the same lips that less than 24 hours prior had been wrapped tightly around his cock as he had satisfied his urges.&nbsp; He felt his need building again, his cock had been swelling and deflating for the last couple of hours as he had been searching for her, and now his urge was strong. 

The binding of her hands excited him greatly; he wanted to take things a little further than his previous encounter. Recalling that he had left her wanting yesterday he felt it was only right that this point should be rectified at this meeting.

He placed his hands upon her and teased her soft silken gown down over her shoulders to the waist, revealing the fullness of her breasts. His eyes fixed upon her face, reassuring her with a smile, he was pleased to see her blush, and this showed him that she wasn&#8217;t accustomed to being exposed in public. He left it like this for a moment, and lowered his head taking her left nipple tenderly into his mouth and sucking against it softly until it became rigid. He offered the same attention to her right nipple. Once both were standing proud, he smiled at her and kissed her lips. 

He lowered her gown to the floor, and indicated that she should step from it; she reluctantly did so, taking a single step to the side. The embarrassment that moments before had flushed her cheeks, spread to encompass her arms, her throat, her chest, spreading almost as far as her breasts, which heaved up and down as she took sharp breaths.

Hen placed one foot between hers, and tapped her feet with his, she moved one foot, he tapped again, she moved once more. �Wider� he ushered, tapping a third time. She obeyed quickly. He took a step back and admired her form, her breasts forced forward by the tying of her hands behind her, her shapely legs parted deliciously, showing the smallest display of woman hood. The sun behind her back caused a silhouette effect, giving her an air of vulnerability yet incredible strength.

He reached out a hand, and placed it between her legs. She looked shocked, but didn&#8217;t dare move, she went to speak, but held her tongue. His hand remained still but he looked her directly in the eye defying her to object. When she offered no resistance, he began to slide his hand gently back and forward lightly across her openings, barely touching, yet still invading her privacy. 
She took a step back, and almost instantly his hand was on her shoulder holding her still. He pressed his hand between her legs again, and brushed back and forth, holding her still until he felt her relax. 

The reluctant willingness delighted him, she could have screamed, she could have run, but she held her nerve and accepted his attention. She clearly felt uncomfortable with what he was doing, but not so uncomfortable that she rejected him.

He felt the warmth of her femininity on his hand, and wanted more, so he extended a finger and stroked it slowly across the tip of her button, causing her to gasp and blush furiously in unison.

He saw her checking around for people, and felt how uneasy she was, his hand left her shoulder and touched her chin, drawing her attention back to him, he rubbed his finger slowly across the tip of her button again in reward for concentrating again. 

He rubbed again, and again, knowing that having left her on the edge of a release just the day before, her excitement would soon return, he wasn&#8217;t wrong, he watched as he rubbed gently against her, watched her face change as she felt her body defy her and become aroused. He watched as her breathing changed from calm to slightly faster. He was thrilled that he could induce this effect on her, it excited him, but he wanted more. 

He looked around and saw the pillared feet of the pier legs, he took her by the arm and led her to the closest one, he turned her so her back was against it and pushed her until the length of her back touched the cold hardness of the metal. She shuddered against the cold, and made to move forward, he reacted instantly and pressed her harder against it by her shoulders. 
He reached behind her and untied her wrists, moved her arms so they rested each side of the pillar and then walked behind and retied them securely.

Her eyes were wide when he returned to face her, he saw an understandable nervousness about her, He leant forward and kissed her lips softly conveying unspoken words of comfort. He pressed his tongue into her mouth, searched inside, teased her lips gently, then kissed her fully again. 

As she began to respond to his kisses he tapped each of her inner thighs with his hand, encouraging her to part her legs once more. Kissing her harder, more insistently as she hesitated, her resistance lasted a fraction to long, so he nipped her bottom lip with his teeth, causing her to squeal softly and part her legs wide in an instant. �that&#8217;s better� he cooed as he kissed her once more and passed his hand up her inner thigh, towards her warm wetness. 

He pressed his finger in between her pussy lips and slowly pushed back towards her opening, he felt the dampness that proclaimed her bodies&#8217; desire, and looked at her face that screamed her minds reluctance.

He saw her blushing harder as she realised her predicament, rules dictated that she was required to pleasure any man who asked her, until he made her his own. She had previously refused to pleasure a man, and had been severely punished for it. It wouldn&#8217;t prevent her refusing again, but she would think more carefully before she did, and this man was different to the others.

He leant forward and sucked her nipple, then caught it between his teeth and nipped it, as she gasped with pain he slid his finger into her entrance working it softly in and out, He swapped nipples, and sucked that one, then nipped at the hardened bud, his finger still sliding in and out of her wetness, this time as he nipped, he used his thumb on her clitoris. 

She squirmed and wriggled, trying to move away from him, his response was to nip at her nipples harder, press harder with his thumb. It was difficult keeping the three movements going, the thumb pressing against the point of her excitement and his finger indulging in her wetness, pushing into her harder, he was almost fucking her with his fingers. Her body began to sway as her inner need took over her mental capacity to resist. 

He looked at her and smiled, she had the decency to lower her eyes in shame, 
Women were supposed to pleasure men, not the other way round. 

�You want it?� he questioned, she shook her head, her body screamed yes, her mind said no.
He rubbed her insides up and down one more time, and then withdrew his finger, she moaned, barely audible, but he heard it and chuckled.

He waited a few moments, then brushed his finger across the tip of her clit again, barely touching it, but causing a reaction inside her that she hadn&#8217;t expected. Her legs buckled slightly beneath her, he brushed again, and again, tormenting the most sensitive parts of her sexuality. His lips returned to her nipples and began licking and sucking them in turn, a mixture of softness and sharp nips, hard sucks and circling her nipple with his tongue, as his finger brushed against her bringing her nearer and nearer to the conclusion he desired. 

Her eyes, now glazed with desire, looked directly into his, almost pleading for release, something she had never done before, Women didn&#8217;t ask for satisfaction, Women gave satisfaction and were careful if their needs were left unmet and they chose to deal with them personally.

He looked at her sharply, his manhood was pressing against the softness of his clothing, and it throbbed with a need for attention. He untied her hands and looked down towards this swollen crutch; she dropped to her knees and reached out for him. He slapped her hand away as he admonished her severely, �don&#8217;t touch without permission� 

She knelt and waited as she watched him release his erection from his trousers, he stepped forward, placing the tip at her lips. He pushed against her lips and into her mouth, the warmth surrounding his cock instantly made him wish he was sliding it between her other lips. He thrust in deep, and held himself inside her. Her tongue instinctively traced around the shaft, and then the crown. He fought to hold back, took his mind off it by reaching down and pinching her nipples, enjoying the sensation of her trying to gasp in pain with a mouth full of swollen member. 

He thrust again, just deep enough to make her gag a little, and pulled out slowly, his body rocking forwards into her and pulling out, building slowly into a rhythm as he brought himself closer and closer to satisfaction.&nbsp; Each time she put her hands up to steady herself, or to touch him, he slapped them away, then thrust deeper into her then the previous time to show her that he was in charge.

She became frustrated, he wanted her to pleasure him, but wouldn&#8217;t let her touch him. He could feel her frustration; feel the tension as he thrust into her. He enjoyed the feeling, it caused him to harden further, he didn&#8217;t know how much longer he would be able or willing to carry this on. 

He tweaked her nipples between his finger and thumb, thrust his cock into her mouth and asked her again �do you want it?� she shook her head.
He pinched harder, pushed deeper, �are you sure?� she shook her head again
�We shall see� he said as he withdrew from her mouth, putting his hand behind her head he eased her forward into a hands and knees position before she had chance to protest, and was kneeling behind her just a moment later.

His placed his throbbing erection at the entrance and pressed slightly against her, so it nudged just inside the wet opening, he reached round with his hand and rubbed at her clitoral swelling, teasing it and gently squeezing it between finger and thumb, he knew that any movement she made to evade his fingers would impale her on his cock. He felt her body begin to react, and could tell she was fighting against her inner need, he continued rubbing, and flicking, exploring touches and movements to see which ones drove her mad, then when he found one that worked he increased the touch till her body almost danced beneath him.

�ask for it� he demanded as he applied his fingers to her clit, holding her tantalisingly on the edge of orgasm, she fought to resist the orgasm, he fought to keep her just seconds away from exploding. She shook her head, desperate, almost crying with need, but stubborn to the end, WOMEN didn&#8217;t ask for things, especially for sex.

He reached forward, gripping her nipple hard, pressed and circled and swirled the fingers of his other hand around her now tormented clit, endlessly applying just the right touch in just the right places, for just the right amount of time to keep her on the precipice of orgasm.

He continued for about 90 seconds, her body dancing beneath his, she wouldn&#8217;t give it up, but neither would he. He gripped her nipple harder and rolled it between his fingers, just enough to tip her over the edge� 

�please, may I have my relief� she cried as she pushed back onto him, taking his cock deep inside her in one movement, as she skewered herself on him her orgasm ripped through her, her pussy walls gripped his shaft forcing his own orgasm to erupt. 

He thrust into her twice, and then rested against her, enjoying the pulsing sensation of his and her orgasm combined on this length. When the pulsing stopped he slid out, wiped himself on her discarded gown, returned his now softening cock into his trousers and walked away smiling. He had made her realise, that the only way she would end the torment was to go against everything she had been brought up to know.

She had willingly broken the rules and asked for her orgasm.
