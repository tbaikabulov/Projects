Lisa's Interview

The evening was pleasant. A warm breeze cooled the deck, and dinner was served to the 6 couples aboard the yacht. Light chatter and laughter could be heard by the four men in the smaller boat anchored 100 yards off the starboard bow, unseen in the dark. After observing the yacht for an hour, the leader, Albert, noted that there were only three crew aboard, one a woman. Albert and his men thought of themselves as pirates, but they were slavers. As the dinner drew to a close with dessert and wine, the couples drifted off to their cabins. The crew cleaned up, and the two men made their way to the bridge. Over the next hour, the cabin lights went out one by one, and the Captain remained alone on the bridge. Albert noticed a very slight movement of the yacht. He thought, �Some of them are having sex! Excellent! I wonder if I'll be able to tell once they are lined up in front of me.� He opened the cabin door and said, �Get some sleep. We move just before dawn.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hours later, they silently picked up their weapons and climbed the stairs. One went to the stern and switched the trolling motor on. The boat slowly started moving silently toward the yacht. No one spoke in the 40 minutes it took to approach the rear of the yacht. Each man knew his role. Albert boarded and started toward the bridge. The others carefully and silently stationed themselves around the ship. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Captain noticed the bridge door opening a little too late. He saw the barrel of a gun pointed right at him. Instinctively, he started to reach for a button on the panel in front of him. �Don't even think about it!�, Albert said in a hoarse whisper. �Come toward me. Now!�&nbsp; As the Captain approached, Albert twirled his finger,&nbsp; indicating that he should turn around. In a moment, the Captain was handcuffed. �Captain�, Albert continued in a whisper, �Wouldn't you agree that it is hard to swim in handcuffs?� The Captain nodded. �Good. Now you are going to help me round up the passengers and crew on deck, understood?� Again, a nod. �You are going to go on the intercom and announce in a calm voice that there is a situation on the ship that requires everyone to assemble on deck in 10 minutes. I have six armed men already on board, so sounding any alarm would only cause you and your crew harm. Gather your wits and make the announcement.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As the passengers made their way to the deck, they saw the Captain with his back to the starboard rail, a strained smile on his face. Beside him, a man they had not seen before. The Captain nodded, indicating that all were present. Albert drew his pistol. Three men emerged from the shadows, pistols in hand. The Captain, at Albert's nod, said in a loud voice, �Ladies and gentlemen, these men have taken over the ship. Please do exactly as they say and we will not be harmed.� Taking advantage of the expected moment of stunned silence, the pirates began herding the men to the starboard rail and the women to the port side. While one man stayed with the women, the two others, waving their pistols, produced handcuffs and fastened each man to the rail with the Captain and his crewman. Albert and his men now took several moments to look over their captives. The passengers were all roughly in their twenties, all well groomed and in good physical shape. Some were in bathrobes, the rest had slipped on jeans or shorts. Some of the women were softly crying, others were starting to ask questions. The men were all glaring at Albert, silently admitting their handcuffed impotence. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Silence!� My men will now pass among you and collect everything in your pockets. Cell phones, wallets, and any jewelry you are wearing.� The first two women handed over a cell phone, a ring and a necklace. The man threw the phones overboard and pocketed the jewelry. The first man reluctantly gave up his wallet. The pirate rifled through it, taking credit cards and cash. He tossed the wallet into the water.&nbsp; At this, the fourth woman in the line began loudly demanding that they be set free and for the pirates to leave the ship or face �the law�. Albert pointed at the lady and said, �Bring her!� Two of the bandits walked over to her and seized her by the upper arms, dragging her to the center of the deck. At a nod from Albert, one of the men moved to hold her arms behind her. The other man quickly pulled her shorts down to her knees. Then they bent her over at the waist. Each holding her down with one arm. They began harshly smacking her panty-clad behind with their free hands. Screams became sobs and then frantic pleas to stop. At length, they straightened her up to face Albert, who looked directly at the other women and said, �From this point on you will all address me as 'sir', and you will not speak unless you are asked a question.� �Is that clear to all?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A few meek and tearful �Yes sirs� were heard.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Albert turned to directly face the spanked woman. �Do you have anything else to say?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her eyes cast down in defeat, tears running down her face, she sobbed, �No---sir.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Albert said, �Return to your group. Leave your shorts where they are.� She shuffled back to the rail. Albert said, �Now we will continue.� The men resumed collecting items from the captives, who were much more cooperative. After all but valuable items had been tossed into the ocean, Albert&nbsp; turned again to the women and said, �Now, two at a time, my men will take you to your cabins. You are to show them everything you have in the room. Every piece of clothing, everything. They will want to see any grooming or toiletry items you have. Some of you have left your phones and wallets in your room. Show my men everything. Is that clear, ladies?� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes sir.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As the men took the first two women by the arm, Albert held up his hand. �Stop. First, all the women, remove your shoes and throw them over the side. You won't need them.� Slowly at first, each shoe or sandal came off and made a splash. As the last one went over, Albert said, �Thank you, ladies. I find that barefoot women are just a bit less defiant. Wouldn&#8217;t you agree? You don't need to answer that� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the first cabin, the captor spoke for the first time. �What is your name?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Lisa,&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sir.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Alright Lisa. You will quickly hold up each item you have in this cabin, one at a time, and then toss it in that corner unless I say otherwise. Do you understand?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes sir.� Lisa began holding up her clothing. A dress, underwear, shorts, t-shirts and shoes. All were thrown in a pile.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Go into your bathroom and show me what is there.� Lisa brought out&nbsp; toothpaste, a few cosmetics and a razor. �Is there shaving cream in there?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes sir.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Leave only the razor, the shaving cream, and soap and towel. Throw everything else away. When Lisa returned, the man glanced in the bathroom. He turned toward the frightened woman. �Lisa, I will give you your privacy. Enter the bathroom.&nbsp; Do not lock the door. You are to shave yourself all over, including your pussy. Shower. Clean yourself thoroughly in all places. Do you understand what I mean by that?� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Stricken and tearful, Lisa choked out, �Yes sir.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You have twenty-five minutes before your interview. You are to wrap yourself in only the towel.&nbsp;&nbsp; Go!�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As Lisa scampered into the bathroom, the man smiled, sat on the bed and lit a cigarette.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In the next room, the second captive entered her cabin and backed up against a wall, expecting to be raped. �What is name?�, the man said. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Ummm, K-katherine!&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; S-s-ir.�&nbsp; A fleeting thought about trying to relate to a kidnapper entered her mind. �What is your name?� He just glared at her. She remembered the instruction to show her things. She reached toward a suitcase on the dresser.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No!� he pointed toward the bathroom. Trembling, Katherine entered the small bathroom with the nameless pirate right behind. He looked around. He picked up a bar of soap and handed it to her. Then he held up a razor. �You shave!� He pointed to his armpits, and his crotch before patting his legs. He made a waving motion from his neck to his calf. �Understand?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She reddened in embarrassment. �Y-yes s-s-sir�, she replied through tears. He turned and walked out, leaving the door open. Katherine decided to shave most of herself in the shower. The man began to go through the suitcase and a closet., dumping everything on the floor. He heard the shower stop, and took a step to stand in the doorway. Katherine was just emerging from the shower, her bush still intact. �Oh, please!�, she pleaded. The man twirled his finger in a 'hurry up' motion, then folded his arms. Trembling and sobbing, she sat on the toilet and picked up the shaving cream. She turned to hide herself , but quickly saw that it wouldn't work. She placed a bare foot on the counter and spread her legs as she applied the cream. Twice, she had to go back in the shower to rinse off before finishing and wiping with a towel. She was well aware of his stare as she bent her head and moved her lower lips around, looking for any missed hairs. She stood up and faced him. In an instant, he grabbed her arm and neck, turned her around, and bent her face down to the toilet seat. She screamed, again expecting to be raped. Instead, he bent his head down and spread her ass cheeks. He grunted and reached for her hands. He placed one on each cheek and motioned for her to hold them open. He picked up the razor and scraped a few stray hairs off. He let go and as she straightened up, he was handing her a towel. Her face couldn't have been redder as she wrapped the towel around her body. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;An hour and a half later, six women were lined up at the rail, each wrapped in a towel. Most were still&nbsp; a little wet, and their hair was dripping. Albert noticed that the lone female crew member, still dressed, had very short hair, unlike the others. He said, �Thank you, ladies for your cooperation. Your obedience will be tested further now.� He pointed to the female crew member. � You will&nbsp; go to each one, have her face the rail, and dry her hair and body with her towel. She can then put her towel back on. If anyone is uncooperative, just stand back and we will take care of it. Ladies, this will be the first step of your interview. Do you understand?� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A very meek, �Yes sir� was heard.
As the sailor began her task, each woman, blushing and tearful, dutifully turned, perhaps grateful for this small grant of modesty.&nbsp; The men, including the ignored captives, were mesmerized. As the fifth woman's backside was revealed, Albert said, �Stop! Ladies, I want you to walk over to your man and notice that he is very interested in your predicament. You have 30 seconds. Move!� Each of the six women found her mate and quickly noticed that he was painfully aroused. Two of the women slapped her man across the face. Another attempted to kick out, but her knee became tangled in her towel. Another reached out and slapped at a crotch. Each said a few angry words, and turned to walk away. Most were blushing.&nbsp; One towel started to fall off. The woman quickly re-tucked it. Albert continued. �Ladies, while you were busy freshening up, we have prepared your interview room. As you are finished getting dried, you will go one at a time with Peter here. The interview will take approximately thirty minutes. Be prepared to tell us all about yourself. Your profession, your hobbies, the books you have read, your experiences. You will be weighed and measured. You will be assessed. Do you understand?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Several women glanced at each other, helpless at this deepening of their predicament. �Yes sir.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;� I will accept your answer, though I doubt if any of you really understand.� He turned and walked away.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Peter escorted the first lady to the nearest cabin. Albert gestured, �Please sit here. What is your full name? 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Autumn Ellis� Albert looked up from his clipboard. �Uh, sir.� Sitting in the short towel, Autumn had her knees pressed tightly together.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Autumn, what is your profession?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I'm an accountant, sir.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good, that skill could be very useful� Autumn started to question this odd statement, but Albert silenced her with a gesture. �There will be time for your questions later. Take this clipboard and list all your measurements, hobbies and interests.� Autumn did so and handed the board back. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That man you just tried to kick, is he your boyfriend?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Y-yes Sir.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�And during the last few months, about how many times a week have you had sex?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Autumn was starting to tremble. �Ummmm, Uh, I guess about three times a week.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Do you have something to add, Autumn?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She looked up. �Umm, sir! Sorry.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Albert took a wild guess. He stood up looked down at her. �Autumn, did you have sex last night?� She looked up at Albert, towering over her. Her mouth gaped open, but no sound escaped. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Autumn, do you remember what happened on deck earlier? I hope you are not losing your respect for me. What are the two rules I gave you?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Errrr, to call you sir, and to not speak unless asked a question.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sir.� The trembling increased and tears began to flow.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Answer my question!�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Autumn, close to despair, whispered, �Yes&nbsp; s-sir. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; �Autumn, have you ever given your boyfriend oral sex?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Uh, yes sir.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;� And has he returned the favor?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No sir, he said he wouldn't like it.� Autumn&#8217;s face turned bright red. �Why are you asking me  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;these questions?�, she blurted out.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Albert shot her a stern look, but let the transgression go. �Stand up! Step on this scale!�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Startled, Autumn quickly moved onto the scale. �Now, Autumn, we can hardly weigh you accurately while you are wearing a wet towel. You will remove it, fold it carefully, and hand it to me.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It took a moment for the command to sink in. Numbly, she unclasped the towel, let it fall into her hand&nbsp; and started to fold it. She broke. Dropping the towel and putting her hands to her face, she started screaming, �I can't do this! Leave us alone! Leave us alone!� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At the first scream Peter stepped up and grabbed Autumn by the arms. Albert calmly said, �We will continue your interview after the others. Take her back to the rail and give her a taste of your hand�. He quickly put an arm around her waist and dragged the naked, crying woman from the room. In a few minutes, her painful screams resonated through the ship.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The next two women, though highly embarrassed, and tearful, cooperated with Albert's instructions. Each came out of the cabin blushing and distressed. The fourth was named Julie. As she handed her towel to him, Albert glanced down her body and asked, �Did you shave yourself completely?� Instinctively, she dropped her hands down across herself. Albert stood up and glared right into her eyes. Even though she was still on the scale, Albert towered over her. She bent her neck to look up at him. �Show me! Sit down!� Intimidated, Julie sat in the chair. �Come on!� He moved his hands in an unmistakeable way. Julie raised her legs and parted her knees a little. Albert grabbed her ankles and separated them. �Hold still!� He hesitated, looking at her legs. He had always been an admirer of women's legs and feet. Many women had nice legs, but few had pretty feet. Julie's feet were smooth and small with a graceful arch. �Very nice�, he thought, as his attention focused on her crotch. Interestingly, he had always thought of pussies as rather ugly. He thought, �Maybe that&#8217;s why nature covered them with hair.� His customers, though, had almost invariably preferred smoothies. He lightly ran his fingertips over her crotch, pinching here and there. Julie sat frozen. Albert thought, � I usually get some response. Not this time.� After a quick inspection he said, �Good shaving job, you may take your towel and go.� She quickly jumped up and wrapped herself in the towel. He watched her great calves and her toes flexing as she walked away.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Lisa was the last, save for Autumn. Having obediently folded her towel and stepped from the scale, Lisa stood before Albert naked. �Lisa, I am behind schedule. You have twice seen what happens to disobedient girls. I am growing impatient. If you do not wish to to be dragged from this cabin and whipped, you are going to follow my commands quickly and precisely. Do you understand?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Y-y-yes sir� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�First, I must check your grooming. Sit in the chair and hold your legs open widely.� Terrified, Lisa backed into the chair, grasped her knees and spread her legs. �I said widely!� She opened her legs more, and gasped. �I know you had to shave hastily. I will be checking for thoroughness. I will also assess your responsiveness. The last one had none.� As Albert began to lightly run his fingers over her pussy, a deep blush began spreading over Lisa's chest. Her hips moved involuntarily. �I am impressed with your shaving. It is perfect.� Lisa felt a strange sense of pride at the compliment. But Albert's manipulations quickly replaced that with a growing arousal. Albert was good. �Ah! I was hoping to see your little pink friend! He is not so little, ehh?�&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Lisa didn&#8217;t answer. She was lost in sensation. Her eyes were closed. Albert continued his light, but expert massage. He began lightly tugging at her lips. She began a low gasping sound. Albert noticed a pulsing in her pussy. He lightly circled her clit, then moved his finger rapidly. Ahhhhh! Ahhh! Ohh! An orgasm washed over Lisa. She closed her knees and thrashed in the chair. Albert kept one hand between her legs, gently rubbing. Her breathing gradually slowed. Albert sat back in his chair. He allowed Lisa to sit up. She was still in a haze, her upper body still showing a blush.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I suspect that you just had one the best orgasms of your life. Is that right, Lisa?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Through a somewhat ragged breath, she said, �Ummmm, uh,&nbsp;&nbsp; yes&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sir.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You are the most intelligent and responsive member of your group, Lisa. If you wish to make the best of your circumstance, I want you to listen carefully. First, when you are with men, you will keep your legs open a bit. This is a sign of submission.� He waited. Lisa opened her knees. �Thank you.� The rest of your friends are going to another country to live a different life than they have known. Nod if you have an inkling of my meaning.� Lisa nodded as another tear formed. �But your responses so far have earned you a chance to stay with me as my assistant. I can assure you, it will be a hard life but far less stressful than the life of the others. If you choose to audition for this assignment. you will have two tasks to accomplish to earn this position. Think for a moment. Are you interested?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lisa's mind was whirling. Her options were limited. She said, �Yes sir.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good. Your first task is to return the favor I just did for you. Peter, bring the bowl and cloth. Albert stood, lowered his pants to his ankles and sat at the edge of the chair. �You are to very gently wash me, and then service me with a measure of enthusiasm. Kneel.� Lisa knelt. At a glance from Albert, she spread her knees. She wet the cloth in the warm soapy water and began to clean the already hard organ before her. She held it up with one hand and began to wash his balls and shaft. There was no doubt what he wanted next. She lowered her head and began using her lips and tongue. She lightly squeezed his balls. After two hours of ordering women around and inspecting their most intimate parts, Albert wasn't going to last long. Moments later he exploded in her mouth. She pulled back. He grabbed her hair and forced her head back on his shaft. She kept licking and moving her lips. After a a minute, Albert sat back. He handed her the cloth. �I&nbsp; expect you to stay long enough to give me maximum pleasure. You may use this cloth on me and then yourself.� Lisa gently wiped his organ. �In fact, go take a brief shower in there. You will find clothing in there. When you return, your second task will be waiting. I believe her name is Autumn. You will take charge of her personal inspection in the same way I did for you. If you understand, go quickly.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Autumn came into the cabin at Peter's arm, naked and walking with an awkward gait. She heard a toilet flush. The three people stood silently, looking at the bathroom door. In a moment, Lisa emerged in jeans and a t-shirt. A little panic showed on Autumn's face. �Lisa, is Autumn a friend of yours?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No sir, we just met yesterday.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good. That will make it easier. Autumn&#8217;s interview was interrupted as she was folding her towel.� Albert handed the towel to Lisa. �Carry on.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;While in the shower, Lisa had thought about her options. The odds of a better future and even possible escape were with Albert, as opposed to the unknown fate facing the others.&nbsp; Though harsh, Albert didn&#8217;t seem to be a monster. And he really had given her an intense orgasm. She decided to not only try for this position, but to go all out. She narrowed her eyes. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Autumn, you will address me as 'Ma&#8217;am', and you will follow my instructions quickly and precisely. Is that quite clear?� The two men in the room gave Lisa a startled look, but kept silent. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Autumn mumbled, �Yes ma'am.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Speak up!. I notice that you are walking funny. Are you in pain?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�YES MA'AM!�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Here is your towel. You haven't finished your task.� Autumn took the towel and began to fold it quickly. She was trembling again. She offered it to Lisa. She took it, shook it out and threw it back. �Try again. I'm expecting more from you!� This time the towel looked much neater.&nbsp; �Now I need to check your personal grooming. Sit on that chair and raise your legs in the air.� Autumn quickly did as she was told. Lisa grabbed her knees and spread them apart. She began the inspection, rubbing and grazing the skin here and there. Lisa started to move her legs. �Hold still!� Everyone noticed large red marks on her behind and upper legs. �Lisa, you missed a few spots when you shaved. Have you ever shaved yourself before?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No ma'am, not before today.� A blush started to redden her face.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Go into that bathroom and fetch the razor and cream. Move!� She awkwardly stood up and scampered to the bathroom.&nbsp; When she returned she resumed her position without further instruction. There were no arms on the chair, so she had to place her hands under her knees. �Autumn, you are doing very well so far. Now, I am going to point out areas that need more attention, and you will take care of them.� She again started to lightly run her fingers around Autumn&#8217;s pussy. Soon her clit peeked from under it's hood. Lisa's erotic inspection continued. �Here.� Autumn had to raise her head to see what Lisa was pointing at. She moved the razor down and scraped it across the offending hairs. �You won't be needing any shaving cream. You already are getting plenty of lubrication down here. Aren't you?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Y-y-e-e-ss M-m-a-a-m�, Autumn replied through heavy breaths. Lisa began slow circles around her clit&nbsp; while tickling around her ass with the other hand. Her touch was very light, as Albert had 'taught' her. Lisa saw Autumn&#8217;s nipples stiffen, as her fingers made closer contact.&nbsp; Autumn&#8217;s toes began to flex and a low moan came out of her mouth. Lisa's fingers began an accelerated movement. Soon, her orgasm was upon her. Her hands flew from her knees to cover Lisa's hands at her crotch. Her head flew back, her feet were moving, and little gasps came between breaths. She tried to stop Lisa's moving fingers at her clit but couldn&#8217;t. She rode out her orgasm. Everyone in the room could see her little anus contracting. 
  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Albert couldn&#8217;t take his eyes off of the scene. He thought, �Wow. She's n not faking that one. The toes curling, the big blush, and those contractions are a dead giveaway.�After a few moments, her little bodily movements and breathing slowed. Lisa told her to sit up. She gave Albert a glance and moved her eyes toward Peter. Albert smiled and told Peter to bring the bowl and cloth. As Peter approached, Lisa motioned for him to sit.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Autumn, you are going to pay your dues for that great orgasm I just gave you. You are going to wash Peter and then bring him off. Peter lifted up and lowered his pants and shorts. �Kneel. Keep your legs apart.� The tearful gasping girl took the wet cloth and began cleaning Peter's shaft. Lisa pointed downward. He lifted slightly and felt his testicles being washed. He was already quite hard. Lisa snapped her fingers and pointed. Autumn understood and began licking and sucking. For any man, the day's events would be arousing, and Peter was no exception. He grabbed Autumn&#8217;s head and began pumping. He came to a moaning finish. Lisa handed her the wet cloth. Autumn started wiping her mouth. �No, clean him, then yourself!� She wiped the head of his still hard organ, and then brought the cloth to her lips.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Albert, who had seemed stunned into silence, spoke: �Peter, give her towel back and take her to the dining hall with the others. Lisa, stay for a moment.�&nbsp; They sat in chairs facing each other. Fully dressed, and feeling her success with Autumn, felt confident. �I am quite impressed with your performance. I would even go as far as to say you are the one I have been looking&nbsp; for. I know you are single, and I saw how you slapped the man you were with, so listen to my offer. I want you to be my assistant. Not my slave or servant, mind you, but shall I say, my 'subservient assistant'.&nbsp; You tamed Autumn with authority. I believe that you even enjoyed it in some small way. This is a lucrative business, and I am offering you a position on my crew. Along with the obvious work aspect that you have seen, there are also stays in hotels and fine dining. The work can be extremely hard and sometimes quite dangerous, but the rewards are many. You will be all things to me. A trainer, a travel scheduler, a secretary. You will do similar work with women that you just did. I will demand your complete loyalty. Oh yes, you must also be sexually available to me, and only me. You will be off limits to my crew. I think you have seen that I am not a psychopath or a pervert. I simply believe that men and women have separate roles in this life, and I have never seen a woman who was my equal. Now, I'm sure you have many questions, and I will answer all at length. But now it is time to eat. Let's go see what's for lunch.� They walked down the hall to a dining room almost filled by a large table. On the right side, Lisa saw the eight men and the female crew member, fully dressed.&nbsp; Each had one hand on the table. She quickly surmised that each one was handcuffed to a chair. On the left were were four women. Some had been softly crying. The two other women, comically wearing aprons and nothing else, emerged from a large door carrying trays of food. They began spooning a sort of stew into bowls and passing them down the table. As they turned back to the kitchen, Lisa did a little double take. One of the server's aprons framed her quite red ass. Several others noticed as well, remembering the first spanking.&nbsp; 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Everyone's attention momentarily focused on the food. Then they began looking at Albert and then at Lisa. Albert held up his palm. �Please enjoy your meal. And remember the rules I established earlier. All will become clear to you soon.� The two women passed out glasses of water. Albert pointed Lisa to a smaller table near the door where his three crew sat, already eating, guns beside their bowls. As they ate, Lisa observed various behaviors among the captives. The women were alternately glaring at Albert, the Captain, and the captive men. The men were looking at their food. Lisa noticed a faint smile on one face. She thought, could the pirates have talked to the men and told them they would be released? She was sure the women, after their humiliating ordeal, would not be so lucky. Then she realized that she was also a captive who had gone through the same ordeal. Forced to strip, to have a personal inspection, to have a forced orgasm, to be made to shave! She wondered about the woman from the crew. She was quite skinny, and at least in her forties. Could these pirates have decided they didn't want her? Was she too old? Maybe they had some odd respect for fellow sailors. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; After everyone was finished eating, the pirates lit cigarettes. One of them got up and began down the row, offering one to each man. Three nodded and the pirate lit each cigarette with a lighter. He turned his back on the women and returned to his seat. This started a series of sighs and snorts among the women, as their situation began to dawn on them. Albert silenced them with a glance. None of them wanted to feel Autumn&#8217;s pain. He rose to speak. �All of you will be leaving the ship in the next two days. My men will take you to your rooms for the night. The men will be cuffed two to a bed. I can't risk any heroics or foolish bravado from you. The women will sleep in one room. We have moved some beds to accommodate this. Ladies, feel free to commiserate and plot all night. In the morning the rules apply once more. I want to compliment you on your compliance thus far. That will be reflected in your assessment. Peter, show these ladies to their room and see to their comfort.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lisa followed Albert back to the captain's cabin. �Have you thought about my generous offer? Do you have questions? 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes sir. I feel I have no real choice but to trust your word. I don't want to be with the others. My first question is what is really going to happen to those women? Are they going to be sold off as prostitutes?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No, not exactly. But freedom is also not in their future. I have contacts all over the world who rely on me to bring them concubines and courtesans. They will be offered a future in a harem or in an apartment as what you would call 'a kept woman'. As long as they are subservient and can adapt to sexual training they will have a decent life. That is why women are on this earth. They are to serve and satisfy men.� These women will learn to flatter and flirt in public, and give long and enthusiastic service at night. They will dress, and undress, to please the whims of their man. Some of these men like to trade among themselves. But I have confidence that they will not be killed or given to cruel masters. But they must learn to be unfailingly obedient and attentive.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�And I, as well.? What if you get mad or tired of me?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes, you must be obedient and attentive, and sexy, but voluntarily. I have already seen that in your personality. That is why you are sitting here. You will be part of the crew and dress like the crew. In private, however, I will expect you to be in any state of dress I prefer, and completely available to me. We will be lovers-- of a sort-- and after what happened earlier, I don't believe you will be disappointed. When we are discussing business, I want your calm attention. But my decisions are always final and you will follow them precisely. As for making me mad, I don't recommend it. If you truly defy me, I will whip you as you saw today. I need your decision.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lisa stood up. She thought, �Here goes.� She slowly drew her shirt up and off. She unbuttoned her jeans and slipped them off . She stood naked before him again. She whispered, �Sir, business or pleasure?� and sat on his lap as she began a long kiss. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As their lips parted, he said, �Actually, a little bit of both, my dear. You are going to do a training session tomorrow with the women. You will teach them three positions of display. Stand up. I will teach them to you now.� Lisa frowned a bit and hesitantly stood.&nbsp; �The first is called 'inspection'. Stand with your feet shoulder width apart and your hands behind your head. Elbows back.� Albert stood. �This allows me me to assess your physical condition. Turn slowly.� As she turned, he ran a finger down her back and left cheek. Lisa shivered. �Position two. Kneel. Knees spread wide. Hands behind your head at first, then rest them on your thighs. Wider. Good. Now practice moving quickly and gracefully between these positions. Remember, elbows back, knees wide. Lisa bent forward on all fours to rise. �No. To gracefully stand, stay upright and extend one foot in front, then rise.&nbsp; After several repeats, Lisa was standing at inspection. Albert brushed the back of his hand across her erect nipples. Another shiver. He trailed his hand slowly down to lightly caress her bare pussy. A gasp. He caught her folds between three fingers and lightly tugged her lips. Lisa went up on her toes and gasped again. Albert said, �I believe you are ready for the third position, my dear. Down on all fours.� As she moved, he opened his pants and shirt and slipped them off. �Knees wide, bottom up.� He knelt behind her and touched her outer lips with his penis. Then he slowly slipped in. A moan escaped Lisa's mouth, and another. Albert set up a rhythm. He reached down to caress her clit. At times he slowed to a steady in and out. Then he would speed up. All the time, his fingers gently rubbed around her clit. He knew from long experience that women took much longer than men to orgasm. He also knew that forcing women to submit and display themselves was often a subconscious turn-on. He sensed she was close. She was moving back against him. He heard a low groan, and sped up his rhythm, his fingers rapidly strumming her clit.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Ahhhh Ahhh Uhhhh Oh Oh Oh!� Seconds later, Albert exploded into her spasming pussy. They collapsed to the floor. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Are you still with me, Lisa?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Ahhhh.. yes. Ahhh&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; sir.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He told Lisa to shower first as the stall was small. Later they sat at a table. Albert's smile faded. He said, �Business. When we are working I will be very demanding. There is no room for error or softness. You will still address me as 'sir' and show deference at all times. The men will lose all respect if they see defiance in you. Do not give them orders. Do not even speak to them unless you have to. They are not nice men. Do not grow cocky or there will be a swift consequence. Do you understand ?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I think so sir. I'm at your mercy. I will try do do what you want. Some of these women are not going to have a life of ease, are they?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Perhaps not. Lisa, if you can't put such sympathies out of your mind, I will take you to join them.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No sir! Please!� A small panic began to arise in her chest. �Let me show you. Tell me what you want me to do with them.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That's better. Have you thought about the positions? How do you plan to proceed?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Ummm, I thought I would take them one at a time and teach them.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Take two at a time. It will save time and it will be more embarrassing for them. They all need to get over their modesty. In fact, you will take two and I will take the other three. Then we will compare.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Next morning, Albert stayed well back as Lisa opened the first ladies cabin. All had found various articles of clothing during the night. �Did anyone tell you to get dressed?� demanded Lisa. All the women froze. �Get them off! Now!� Robes, pajamas and jeans began dropping. She pointed to Autumn and Julie, who had been first to get her clothes off. �Come with me. Quickly!� As they headed toward an empty cabin, Lisa asked, �Have you eaten?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Ma'am�, Autumn quickly replied. Julie looked at both women. �Wha..� Lisa held up a hand. �No talking. Get in there. She left the door open. �Go into the bathroom together and take care of things. While you're there, check each others grooming. You have 5 minutes. She noticed Albert with the other girls in the hallway. Her competitive instincts kicked in. She thought, �no sympathy, no softness.� The two women filed back into the room. �Kneel, facing each other.� They quickly complied. �Julie, this will be news to you. Autumn already knows that I am now with Albert. You will do exactly what I tell you to do, quickly and without thinking. I hope that is clear.� Lisa picked up a wooden rod that she had found. �My hand may not be very persuasive, but this will be. Now, we have work to do. I am to train you in ways that will be helpful to you in the future. As Autumn already knows, you will address me as Ma'am. Now, hands behind your head.� Lisa took the rod and pushed Julie's elbows back. �You are to mirror each others movements.� Both women moved elbows back. �Spread your knees widely.� Autumn moved to comply. Julie hesitated. Lisa smacked the rod across Julie's inner thigh.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Owww! Please! Through tears, she said, �Ok, ok!� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Ladies, this is your position when told to kneel in front of a man. You are displaying your body for him and waiting for instructions. Your tits are thrust out and your knees are wide. Now stand.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The women awkwardly got to their feet. �We'll need to practice a little grace, won't we girls?� Without waiting for an answer, Lisa asked, �Where should your arms be?� They quickly put their hands behind their heads. �Feet apart!. Good. This position is called 'inspection' Your body will be assessed in this position. Lisa began rubbing her fingers over both women's nipples, hardening them. Lisa trailed a hand down to their pussies, lightly exploring. Julie began to make small movements. A gasp and a little shudder followed.&nbsp; Lisa said, �Now , down on all fours. Knees spread. Asses facing me. As their legs parted, Lisa gave them&nbsp; an �Albert'. A slow, light rubbing and tugging, moving ever nearer to the clit. Within a few minutes,&nbsp; both women were wet but too nervous to orgasm. Lisa let the girls subside for a while. �This position is called 'down'&nbsp; You will assume it when commanded. Some men will just point down. Others will snap their fingers.� Some may call it Position 3. We will practice going between positions. I am expecting grace and quickness.&nbsp; Stand! Go from stand to kneel 5 times, mirroring each other.� As they worked, a sheen of sweat flowed down faces and breasts. �Now, kneel to down 5 times.� �Stand.�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Kneel.�&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; �Stand.� Lisa lightly smacked a knee or an elbow a few times, but the girls were getting good at it. Footsteps faintly sounded in the hall. �If a man walks in here, what is your position?� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In a moment, Albert stood in the door. Both women knelt and spread their knees.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Ladies, come in.� Albert's charges meekly filed in. They saw the two kneeling women. With a glance at each other, they knelt in the line. Lisa saw red marks on their thighs. All five were sweaty and short of breath. Albert remarked,�I'm impressed! Now, ladies, you will show me what you have learned. Your responses yesterday and your obedience today will all be part of your assessment score.� Ten eyes went wide in shock. �Stand!� The women rose to their position. �Kneel!� Julie was slow to get back down. At a nod from Albert, Lisa went behind the group and gave Julie a low swat with the rod.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Ow! Ahh! Please!�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Face away from me!� In seconds all were facing the wall. �As I count from left to right, each of you will show me 'down'. One!� Autumn went to all fours. �Two!� Julie followed. A red stripe crossed her behind. She seemed to hold her legs extra wide. In a moment all five women were lined up. �Crawl to that wall, turn around, and kneel.� They hurried to comply. �As your reward, four of you will be permitted clothing this evening. Julie, you will not, as your quickness needs some work�&nbsp; Albert had the women crowd into the small shower two at a time for his amusement. As they finished, he admonished them,� You are all to remain hairless from the neck down. Help each other if you need to. If a man enters your room, you will silently kneel where you are. Be ready to follow their orders. My men may require further service from some of you, but your smooth pussies are safe for now. Do not forget that your actions and your obedience are all part of your score. I'm proud of you. Each of you is a beautiful female specimen.�&nbsp; At this, something approaching pride&nbsp; very briefly surged among the tired women. It quickly faded as the word �specimen� sunk in. �Lisa will escort you to your room.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She left Peter in the hall outside the women's cabin. The look on his face told her that Peter had not accepted her new role. �Peter, Albert has made it clear that I am not in charge of the crew. I will be his assistant, not his First Mate. Each of you is very good at this sordid business, and I am trying to fit in because I have no other choice. I will try to stay out of your way. Can we give this a try?� Peter gave a slight nod of his head. �Good! Thank you.� As she made her way to Albert's cabin, she tried to decide whether to undress for his pleasure or wait to gauge his mood.&nbsp; She opened the door and saw him at the&nbsp; table, poring over a paper. She stood just inside the door. �Sir?� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Without looking up, he said, �Strip and kneel!� Lisa quickly complied, sensing anger in his voice. She waited, hands on thighs. She knew better than to speak. She began to realize that the divide between business and pleasure might be difficult to discern.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Albert stood up, sending the chair tumbling. He ripped off his shirt and jeans, and in one movement he threw Lisa on her back on the carpet. He proceeded to rape her, finishing off in moments.&nbsp; He got up and strode to the shower leaving Lisa spread on the floor, panting. In a few minutes, he stepped out of the bathroom and jerked this thumb, letting Lisa know it was her turn. When she emerged, wearing a robe, Albert motioned her to sit down. �I don't apologize for my actions. I'm angry, and you walked in. I'm not promising it won't happen again. Today has gone sour. My contacts are not responding. I think I have competition out there. Shaken and sore from the attack, Lisa remained silent. She had not expected anything like this. She took a deep breath, stood up and began rubbing Albert's back and neck. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Time for bed?�, she whispered. She continued to massage his back until he fell asleep. During the night, Lisa could hear the faint sounds of slaps on flesh and cries of pain. She slept fitfully. In the morning she decided to play her 'lovers' role and wake Albert up with her mouth. A few licks and moves with her fingers brought him erect. She gave him a light kiss on the lips and then proceeded to swirl her tongue around his shaft. A crooked smile and a moan preceded his explosion. Remembering, she continued her tongue action as he subsided. She rose to get a warm cloth to bathe him. They dozed for a half hour. Albert got out of bed, and said, �Thank you. Now get dressed, we have business.� He made&nbsp; a call, and soon Katherine and Julie knocked on the door. They had a tray of food. Lisa was surprised when she noticed that Julie was wearing shorts. Apparently something had happened during the night. Lisa remembered the cries. �Congratulations, Julie!� Julie's eyes went straight to the floor. �Thank you, Ma'am�, she muttered. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;With a wave, Albert shooed them away. As they ate, Albert tried to formulate a plan. �We're running out of food and fresh water. We have to act today. You will take the girls and find each one something to wear. Nightgowns, dresses, anything revealing and sexy. That one, uh, Julie. Put her in the skimpiest nightie you can find. I want to see her legs. We're taking pictures in two hours. I'll tell the boys. Go.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lisa faced the women. �Ladies, we are going to each of your old cabins. You are going to retrieve some clothing. You should feel good about that. However, I will choose that clothing from what you have. Leave the towels here. They will be in the way.�&nbsp; Five towels dropped. Autumn's room was first. Lisa told her to show her what was in the pile on the floor. She spotted a teddy. �That's the one. Put it on now.� Autumn began looking back in the pile. �No underwear.� Autumn obediently slipped the nightgown on. �Perfect., let's go.� Soon, each woman was clad in a gown or dress. One was in a bikini. They were kneeling in a cabin when Albert entered. �Stand! Elbows back!� When he was satisfied, he took a few pictures. �Turn around.� More pictures. �Kneel.� As&nbsp; each one lowered herself to the floor, Albert swept his eyes across the group. Julie wore a short, flimsy nighty that covered almost nothing in her present awkward position. Katherine was wearing a black cocktail dress that kept her from spreading her knees very widely. He took a closeup of each one, then, with a wink at Lisa, turned and walked out.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Katherine cried out, �What is happening to us!� Quickly, the rest started jabbering. Lisa held her hand up. �It's time to answer that question. Quiet down and I'll tell as much as I know. You are captives. There is nothing you can do about it. What each of you can do, is try to make the best of this. Albert has promised me that you are not going to be harmed. But I can already see that much depends on you. Soon, men will be looking at you. They will be bidding on you.� Tears began falling. Julie fell on the floor, sobbing. Lisa waited. After a time she continued. �Yes, you are going to be auctioned off.  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Autumn raised her hand like a schoolgirl. �Why are you so special?� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lisa thought for a moment. �I made a deal with the devil. He made me an offer and I took it. Any of you would have done exactly the same and you know it! Now I don't know any more than you about what happens next. But I have learned that it doesn't pay to make him angry. Some of you have learned it too. I'm going to do exactly what he expects and you are too if you want to get through this. Now, we're going back to the rooms. Julie, apparently your score went up last night, so keep the teddy.� Julie looked away. Peter appeared in the doorway. �When we get back you will follow the men's instructions. Is that clear?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes, Ma'am�, came a weak response.&nbsp; The barefoot, barely clad women filed out.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Lisa returned to Albert's cabin, he smiled and motioned her over to a chair. She breathed a sigh of relief at his elevated mood. �Ok, I have a deal. This evening, we will meet another boat. I have ten gentlemen coming aboard to view the merchandise. The weather is good, so we will do this on the main deck. After lunch, I will brief the girls on what is expected. You are to remain with them when they are not onstage. Keep their spirits up as best you can. Most if not all of them will be leaving tonight.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�And the men?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Albert shot her a stern look. �Don't concern yourself with matters outside your duties!�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I'm sorry, Sir. It won't happen again.�&nbsp; Beads of sweat began to form on her face. An image formed in her mind, of her standing in line to be auctioned. She realized that she could never truly trust Albert. She also realized that there had been no sights or sounds of the captive men today. A little shudder came over her. Was there a way out of this? A way off this boat? A way back to her life? No. In another world, she might even like Albert. In this world she was really only one level above the others. She would have to play her few cards with all her wits.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The captive men were conspicuously absent at lunch. Everyone ate in silence. Two women, even more comical in aprons and night gowns, served and cleaned up afterward. Albert brought his chair nearer to the women's table. �Ladies, this evening will bring our association to an end. As you have been told, we will have visitors. Each of you will probably be leaving the boat with one of them. If it is any comfort I want you to know that I only have high quality clients. You will not be sold into prostitution or servitude. You will be serving one man at his pleasure. This man will pay a large sum of money for you. This gives you a measure of safety, as you will be a valuable and expensive investment. I see that each of you is looking at me as though I am a monster. No, I am a man. Perhaps more of a man than you have ever known, but still a man.� He looked at each girl in turn, until each looked away.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Over the next few hours, you will receive further instructions and go through a kind of rehearsal. You will quickly and carefully follow every command. I can assure you that none of you wants to earn a punishment during the auction in front of my clients. That would cause a loss of respect among them. Do any of you think that would be a good idea?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No sir.�, he heard, almost in unison.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I may ask you to assume the positions you learned, and others. I will probably ask you to reveal yourself at some point. You will be obedient and graceful. There will be no breakdowns or outbursts. You will return to your rooms now. Lisa will decide what you are going to wear. It may well be what you are wearing now. You will have time to clean up and have a light meal before the evening's entertainment. You are dismissed.� Peter directed the women to the hallway. Albert faced Lisa. �I want them in panties and bras. I thought Lisa's dress was very nice. I think that would be better than nighties. It will be more exciting for the clients as their bodies are revealed. Keep them busy while you gather the clothing. Get them cleaned up and dressed by five o'clock, and bring them to the deck. I will ask one of the men to bring food. Questions?�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No, Sir, I understand.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You are not to tell them, but I have come up with a score for each one from one to ten, based on beauty, obedience, and sexual response. The starting bid will be the score times $5000. Autumn is an 8, and Julie is a 5. The rest are in between. For your own information, you would probably be a nine. You may go.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Sir� Lisa blushed lightly and started for the empty cabins where she would find dresses and underwear. She was thinking , �Wow! Being a nine is not a good thing here. I have to do just what he wants. I need to be still on this boat tomorrow!� She brought her collection back the room and spread it out on a bed. �You are to find underwear and a dress that will fit you. Do not put them on yet, as you need to shower. Keep your hair dry. Pick your clothing now and begin taking turns to shower. Be sure you are clean shaved. No stubble. There will be food here later. We are leaving here at 5.� The women eagerly started going through the clothes. A little shopping spree broke out. Lisa smiled and thought, �Even the spankings are not as humiliating for a woman as being naked.� One was already entering the shower.&nbsp; This done, she thought about shoes. They would need heels for the auction. Men loved heels. A feeling of dread came over her. She thought, �There are ten clients coming aboard and only six women. Albert just told me I was worth $45000 minimum. Will he betray me? Is this a setup? I don't dare ask him. But if he tells me to get in a dress, That will be the end of me. Oh, God!� She stopped walking and leaned on a wall. �Breath, Breath! Ok, ok! Concentrate! Get it done! Shoes!�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Peter and another man were on watch near the women's cabin. Both men looked her over as she passed. �Peter, I need to take each girl to her cabin to pick out shoes. We'll be ready on time.� All she got from Peter was a small nod and a glare. His look told her that he was picturing her as she came out of the shower the day before. She slowly walked down the length of the hall, listening at the men's door. There was no sound. After a few minutes, Lisa reentered the room. �Katherine, you're dressed. Come with me to get shoes.� As they walked down the hall, Lisa saw that Katherine was a mess. Her face was red from crying. Her hair was uncombed. They opened the door. �Find some heels and put them on. Then sit on the bed.� Lisa found a hairbrush on the floor, sat down next to Katherine and started brushing her hair. �We have to get through this. We have no choice.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Katherine glared at her. �That's easy for you to say! You're not being sold off!� More tears.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Right now, I'm not even sure that's true, but no matter. He has us. Now take a few deep breaths. We're on a schedule. I really believe that the more you cooperate, the better off you will be. We have to trust in that.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The women wobbled on deck at 5:15. Each was wearing a cocktail dress and heels. For the most part, their hair was combed. Their faces were various shades of red from crying. Lisa, to her relief, was still in jeans and a t-shirt. �Thank you Lisa. Ladies, we're a little behind. Please do as I say, and this will go well for all of you.� There was a faint menace in his words. Please line up facing me. You will be called by number, one through six, as you are standing now. Lisa, write down the number order. Now, turn to your right and walk to the rail, turn, and come back to your position. I want to see the beautiful women that you are.� They walked as they were told. Albert thought, �The heels were a good idea. It's hard for them not to look good in heels.� As they returned, he said, �Now, hands on hips, slowly turn completely around. Good. Now, sink to your knees, opening your legs as far as your dress will allow.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There were a few gasps, but the women numbly knelt as told. �At this point, I will ask each of you to rise. You will then follow my instructions precisely. We don't need to practice that part.� As his meaning dawned on each girl, tears and blushes began. He called Lisa aside. �Take them back . Get them to clean up each other's faces. Get them to put on some lipstick. They can eat a little. Then come back here. I need something. Our guests will be here in an hour or so.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes Sir� Back in the room, Lisa got the women settled as best she could. She knew Albert's instructions would distract them somewhat. As she left, a crewman stood the open door. She realized that his presence would keep conversation among the captives at a minimum. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She entered and stood by the closed door. Albert sat in a chair, naked. �It's been a hell of a day. Strip and get over here!� Lisa stripped off her shirt and jeans. Albert pointed at the floor. Lisa knelt between his legs and began her service. When he was quite hard, he growled, �Get on the bed.� As she watched his movements, she spread her legs just in time to feel his mouth on her pussy. The feeling was a jolt, but she could sense his impatience. She gasped, �Take me now!� Needing no further encouragement, Albert plunged into her. She bucked her hips and gasped. In no time, Albert exploded, far too soon for Lisa to finish. Still, she felt his male power and dominance. She kissed him deeply, and held on with arms and legs. His breathing slowed. He moved to roll off. �Thank you. Shower quickly, dress and go back. I will send for you in about an hour. Find a bottle of whiskey and a glass. As you wait off deck, give each one a shot of booze. It will relax them.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The final act was at hand. The group waited in the hall. Lisa passed the shot glass and topped it off for each girl. They could hear low voices nearby. Albert spoke. �Gentlemen, in a moment, we will view the consignment. You have a card with six numbers and a score with each. As I explained, the starting bid will be the score multiplied by $5,000. I have personally assessed the shipment over the last two days. I'm sure the value is reflected in the score. Take notes as we proceed. After the viewing, the bidding will begin. You will then have a short private visit with your purchase before departure. I remind you of the strict confidentiality of these proceedings.&nbsp; Shall we begin?�&nbsp; He backed up until Lisa could see him and gave a wave. The women filed out and faced the audience in number order. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Ladies, as I call your number, please walk gracefully to the rail and return to your place. Number one.� A small sound escaped her lips as Julie made her way to the rail. The tight dress forced small steps and as all the&nbsp; men noticed, her heels made small muscles in her calves move in a delicious way.&nbsp; Autumn was last. Each woman again faced the bidders, a slight flush showing on a few faces. �Now, turn slowly and finish in a kneeling position. Soon all six were in a somewhat awkward kneeling posture. �Heads up please. Number one, rise. Number two, unzip her dress and help her out of it. Quickly.� Katherine stood up and stepped behind Julie. The sound of the zipper seemed very loud on the silent deck. A sigh of anticipation lightly rose from the audience. Katherine lowered the dress, and slipped it off Julie's legs. �Number one, bring the dress to me.� Julie had to cross in front of the men in bra and panties. �Thank you. Please return. Each of you will repeat this procedure in order. Begin.� Katherine&#8217;s dress soon slid off. The walk across to Albert seemed to be the most embarrassing part so far. Blushes and small sobs began. Everyone knew what was next. �Number one, reach back and slowly remove your bra and drop it on the deck. Number two, as she finishes, you may begin.� Soon each captive proffered her breasts to the bidders. A new blush began spreading from the necks down to the chests of a few women. The audience noticed that the cool air and the stress were causing nipples to harden. The men could barely take their eyes off the women to take notes. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Thank you. Now, for the last part of the auction, I want each of you to turn away from us.� A small feeling of relief passed through the women as they turned away. Number one, lower your panties halfway down your thighs. All eyes watched the spectacle. �A little more. Good. Now quickly place your hands behind your head and wiggle out of them! Now!� Another gasp escaped Julie's lips, but she began. She had to gyrate wildly to get her panties to slowly slide to her ankles. �Lovely. Leave your panties where they are, slowly turn and sink to a full kneel.� Tears flowed as Julie complied.. �Wider!� Julie moved her knees farther apart. Sighs came from the frozen men. �Number two. Proceed! As she slipped her panties down, a trembling came over her. �Keep going!, Albert warned.� This jolted Katherine back into action. The wiggling action was driving the men wild. As she twisted and moved, the panties slowly edged down until they dropped at her ankles. Soon she was spread out beside Julie. Ten minutes later all six red-faced captives were in this most humiliating kneeling position in front of a group of ogling men who were about to bid on their naked bodies and their services.&nbsp; All remained still, all unable to look at their audience. Albert broke the silence. �Ladies, please remain as you are. Gentlemen, please finish your notes. The bidding will be in $1000 increments above the starting figure. Just raise your card to indicate a bid. There is no need for me to shout out numbers. That might be embarrassing for the ladies� It took a moment in the charged atmosphere for the bidders to realize that Albert had made a joke. A big laugh broke out as the tension was broken. �Number one, stand at inspection.� Julie slowly rose. �25. More?� Albert pointed at a few raised cards. �Any more? Okay, 29. Number one, walk over to this gentleman and hand him your panties. Then take his arm and leave to your left.� 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Julie hesitated as the command sunk in. She looked down at her panties, numbly deciding whether to take them off or wait until she walked over to him. Albert snapped his fingers. She slowly shuffled over to the man, bent down to pick them up, and held them out. The man stood up and took them and her hand. Very aroused, as were all the men on the deck, he walked a little bent over as he pulled her along.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lisa, Peter, and the other man listened as the bidding resumed. Katherine was next, then Autumn.&nbsp; Lisa remembered her easy orgasm during the interview.&nbsp; The bidding went quickly, and soon the last captive delivered her panties to her 'gentleman'. After watching Julie's awkward walk, each had picked up her panties before walking across the deck. As each couple left the deck, the significance of a woman wearing only heels at the arm of a fully dressed man recharged the atmosphere.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; There were five men left in their chairs.&nbsp; Albert said, �Gentlemen, this concludes the regular auction. However, I have a bonus. For your pleasure!� he turned just as Peter and the other man grabbed Lisa under the arms and carried her out on deck. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She screamed and kicked out as they began to remove her clothes.
