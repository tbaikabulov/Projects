A Turn for the Worse

Written By: Lady Lora
Part One
The bar was dimly lit and clouded with cigarette smoke. Slow music drifted through the air like a fragrant scent. It was as if magic was in this place; everything was dreamy, sleepy and soft. I became dizzy and sat down at the nearest table. At the stage, thatwas surrounded by candles and burning incense, sat a woman. Her voice was low and silky; she sang and hummed her tune beautifully.
 I looked away from the stage and checked my phone again for a text or a missed call from one of my friends. They were supposed to have met me here nearly ten minutes ago. I was nervous to say the least, my girlfriends and I had decided to live it up a little and try a new bar outside of town.
�You&#8217;re not from around here, are you?� a smooth voice whispered in my ear. 
I turned my head to see a young man standing over me. He was dressed like any other; in the latest trend. Clean cut, with a head of thick, black, careless hair. He was wearing an old leather jacket, a white V-neck shirt, grimy blue jeans rolled at the ankles and those horrible scuffed, black boots. 
�Mind if I take a seat?� he asked.
He had a single dimple on his cheek and the most piercing gray eyes.
�Sure, be my guest. You&#8217;re right; I&#8217;ve never come out here. It&#8217;s my first time at this bar,� I replied.
�That&#8217;s okay, I like you, I&#8217;m sure no one will give you a hard time,� he said playfully.
�Who&#8217;s this?� another man appeared through the smoke.
This one looked about the same, just a little bit taller, thinner and meaner. His eyes did more than pierce; they were infectious, so brown they were almost black. He had a scruffy beard, and tasseled hair, as if he&#8217;d just finished fucking someone. His skin was slightly moist. Without asking, he took the empty seat on the other side of me. I didn&#8217;t mean to, but I shut my eyes and breathed in his scent. It was husky, made up of old cologne, cigarettes, and copper. I opened my eyes again.
�I don&#8217;t really know who this is, we&#8217;ve only just met,� his friend replied.
�What&#8217;s your name?� 
�Lucy. My name is Lucy. I should probably be going though,� I said.
I tried to get up, but they grabbed my arms at each end and sat me down again.
�Stay,� they both hissed.
My heartbeat quickened. My throat clenched in a panic. 
�Want a drink?� the one I had met first asked.
�I could probably use one right about now,� I gulped.
�Whiskey, it is,� the other one laughed.
His voice made me feel dizzy. His strong, graceful hand was still wrapped around my arm.
The first one got up and went to get the drink. The other one pulled me closer to him. He unzipped my coat and pulled it off of me. He ran his hands down my bare neck, and then his lips.
�Tell me Lucy, are you a virgin?� he asked. 
His breath was hot against my skin. I could feel my heart throbbing in between my legs. I sat silently, unable to move. I was terrified and aroused, unsure of what to do in my current condition.
�Tell me,� he sighed.
�No,� I giggled.
�You&#8217;re a naughty; I was thinking about keeping you around, but you&#8217;re no good anyway, are you? You&#8217;re just a dirty little slut. I can&#8217;t make anything out of you but a good dinner,� he laughed.
I yanked my neck from his hands and looked as his eager, drooling face.
�What are you talking about?� I asked sharply.
�I wasn&#8217;t planning on having sex with you, thank you very much. My virginity is my business, you can just fuck off,� I said and got up before he had a chance to grab at me.
I replayed his words over again in my head as I raced towards the front door. Cold, crisp November air brushed up against my skin as I made my way out of the bar. The streets were littered with trash and desolate. I could make out a few silhouettes huddled under street lamps. 
I shuddered, remembering that I had left my coat at the bar. I wished my friends were around to help me out, but they had flaked on me. I raced around the corner of the bar and hid. It was a thin alley between the bar and the next building over, just enough room for a few trash bins. I got on my hands and knees and crawled behind them, hoping that he would pass by if he actually went out of his way to look for me.
�You little slut, you&#8217;ve pissed me off and now you&#8217;re going to pay. I&#8217;m going to find you and I&#8217;m going to hurt you,� he shouted into the vast, empty street.
�Whoa!� a cheering voice shouted from the distance.
Laughter echoed through the streets, then silence once again.
Where was his friend? Why wasn&#8217;t he stopping him? I heard his footsteps shuffling slowly towards the alley. Was he drunk? I slide my palms against the pavement, looking for anything to aide me. My fingers lightly grazed against shattered glass, I looked down and found the head of a broken bottle. I wrapped my fingers around it and waited.
�Peek-a-boo, I see you,� he whispered and kicked the garbage bin that I was hiding behind.
I jumped up and stabbed him. I felt the sharp end of the bottle sink into the soft skin of his stomach.&nbsp; I let go in horror and raced past him, the bottle clanked against the hard, wet pavement. He grunted for a second and turned towards me.
�Stop,� he shouted.
At first I laughed at the thought of stopping just because he ordered me to do so, but all of a sudden, I felt something inside of me. In my heart and in my mind, I knew better than to keep running. It was intuition that told me to stop. This was my only moment to make up my mind. If I ran he would look for me and eventually he would find me, and what&#8217;s worse, I would be endangering my friends and family if I let this psycho follow me home. Maybe if I stayed we wouldhave a chance to talk things out. I stopped and turned around right at the mouth of the alley. He walked towards me, still clenching onto his blood soaked shirt.
He walked up to me and smiled.
�Want to see a trick?� he asked.
I gulped nervously.
He pulled up his bloody shirt, but there was no wound underneath.
�You can hurt me, but you can&#8217;t kill me, my dear. In fact, the hurt is only a minor inconvenience. That little voice inside your head that told you to stop, well, that right there, just about saved your life. I myself happen to be a vampire, and I have a few close and personal friends that are vampires too.&nbsp; You think you&#8217;ve pissed me off now? Well, the chase would have made things much worse.�
He took a deep breath and ran his hands down his ruined shirt.
�I want you to realize that you belong to me now. I&#8217;m going to take you with me. You don&#8217;t belong to your friends or your family or to anyone that loves you, you belong to me. You&#8217;re going to want to fight me for your freedom, I understand, but save yourself the trouble because I&#8217;ve made up my mind,� he said calmly.
I was shaking like a leaf, defenseless now, listening to his crazy-person banter. He couldn&#8217;t be a vampire, but he could definitely be dangerous and quite easily hurt me at the rate he was going.&nbsp; 
�Get on your knees,� he ordered. 
I hesitated and he slapped me across the face. My eyes welled up in tears. I fell to my knees.
 �Now kiss my boots, and tell me you&#8217;re sorry for ruining my shirt and my appetite,� he hissed.
�Seriously Elliot, what the fuck are you doing?� his friend asked.
I could hear his footsteps near my head as I leaned down and kissed his boots.
�Lick them, and keep licking until I tell you to stop,� he said.
I started licking. All sorts of thought were running through my head. Where were my friends? Were they safe? Maybe I should have made a run for it. Maybe I would have if I knew he was a complete loon. 
�There&#8217;s something about this one, I&#8217;m going to take her with us,� he said.
�Forget about it man. Let&#8217;s just get out of here,� his friend said.
�No,� he replied sternly.
�She probably has friends and people are going to notice that she&#8217;s missing. We can&#8217;t just go around picking up everyone that you fancy, how many times have we made that mistake already?�
�He&#8217;s right, you should just let me go and we can forget this ever happened!� I pleaded.
 �Shut the fuck up! Did I tell you to speak? Did I even allow you to stop licking my boots?� Elliot hissed.
I didn&#8217;t know what to do but to proceed; I was too scared and disadvantaged to take any other action now. 
�Elliot, there&#8217;s only so much we can do here; let&#8217;s just go. If we leave, no one will even think twice about what happened tonight, we can just come back another night and pick up someone less noticeable for dinner,� he continued to argue.
�I don&#8217;t care, I&#8217;m taking this one with us,� he said.
My tongue was getting tired; it was dry and coated in a thick layer of gunk. I didn&#8217;t know what I was doing, I was completely lost. The pavement was scratching up my palms and knees; I was going to lose my cool soon.
�Fine, you always have to make everything so difficult. Why her anyway, what makes her special?� he asked.
�I don&#8217;t know; there&#8217;s nothing all that special about her. What made you special? You put up a fight before I turned you, and I want that feeling again. I want to break her down, she won&#8217;t be easy,� he explained.
�So you&#8217;re planning on turning her?� he asked.
�No, I&#8217;ll probably just play with her until I&#8217;m bored and finish her off. But then again, I wasn&#8217;t planning on turning you either,� he laughed.
�God, Elliot, you&#8217;re fucked up. You&#8217;re really going to ruin our chance out here over some fun you&#8217;re planning on having with his girl?� he whined.
There was a brief silence.
�Where&#8217;s my apology?� he asked and pressed the toe of this shoe up under my chin.
�I&#8217;m sorry,� I said harshly. 
The dirt coated my throat and had a weird texture that made my voice raspy.
�Sorry for what?� he continued.
�I&#8217;m sorry for ruining your shirt and your appetite.�
�I like to be called Sir, by little sluts like you,� he added. �So say it the right way.�
�I&#8217;m sorry for ruining your shirt and your appetite, Sir,� I replied.
�Very good,� he praised.
�Now get back up.�
I stood up and faced him. I managed to catch a glimpse of his cold, black eyes, had they been black this whole time? I couldn&#8217;t have believed it earlier. He walked up to me and wrapped his hand around my neck, running his fingers through my hair. He grabbed me by my short roots and bit into my neck. I tried to push him away, but he held me firmly in place. I felt my body locking up, I couldn&#8217;t move an inch. I closed my eyes for a second and felt my blood pulsing through the veins in my neck. He let go of me, knowing that I was entranced by him now. I felt his finger tips, sliding down my chest. He ripped off my shirt and bra, throwing them to the ground. 
I felt his lips up against breast, kissing, licking, then another bite. In a moment, I felt his friend join him. His lips were running down my shoulder; coming in from behind me. He bit my lower neck, sucking straight from the vein, my heart racing, pumping blood faster to his lips. He picked me up and cradled me in his arms momentarily, then laid me down gently on the cold pavement. Elliot was pulling off my pants hastily. I couldn&#8217;t stop him, I was in a trance. 
Every light touch felt like a dream, every rough bit, coursing through my veins, begging for more.
�Spread your legs,� Elliot ordered, I did as he said.
It wasn&#8217;t consensual; it was something beyond my conscious control.
�Do you want me inside of you?� he asked.
My crotch was throbbing, yes I wanted him, more than I had ever imagined possible. To be lost in this dream forever, his hard cock pounding me from the inside, my skin crawling with pleasure, my heart beating so loud, my lungs working so hard, it was impossible to breath.
�Yes,� I whispered.
�Say it the way I want to hear it,� he said softly as he kneeled down and started eating me out.
�Yes, Sir,� I sighed.
He reached up and twisted my nipples. I burned with sexual angst. 
�Maybe another time, but you don&#8217;t deserve it,� he laughed.
�That&#8217;s just mean,� his friend joined in.
�She&#8217;s my play thing isn&#8217;t she?� he said.
�Yea, but you know how it is when you get bit; it&#8217;s one hell of an aphrodisiac. Look at her; it&#8217;s pathetic!�
Elliot had gotten back up to his feet.&nbsp; His friend was begrudgingly lighting up a cigarette and pacing around the alley. I was still lying naked on the cold cement, floating along, drifting in and out. I couldn&#8217;t see; I couldn&#8217;t open up my eyes even if I wanted to try. I could hear them talking, but I refused to move from my current position. I felt so good, a truck could have run me over and I would have cared less.
�I like it, I want to make her miserable,� he said and nudged my ribs with his boot.
�I&#8217;m going to take her back to our place; I&#8217;ll drop her off and meet up with you later.�
I could hear his friend walking away.
�We are going to have so much fun together,� he sighed.
He placed his foot on my forehead and rolled my head back and forth against the pavement.
�When I&#8217;m done with you, you&#8217;re going to do anything for me, anything at all. I&#8217;m going to be your god; you can&#8217;t even imagine how much control I&#8217;m going to have over you. And this feeling you&#8217;re having right now, you&#8217;ll have it even without my bite, you&#8217;ll have it because I&#8217;ll train you to have it, whenever I&#8217;m in your presence. You&#8217;ll only live and breathe for me, until I&#8217;m bored with you,� he said.
I let those words float past me in my state of ecstasy. 
He grabbed my shirt off of the ground and tore a strand of it off. He picked up my head and wrapped the torn piece of shirt around my eyes, blindfolding me. 
�Take that off, and you wish you didn&#8217;t,� he warned.
He picked me up from the ground and cradled me in his arms. I felt a gravitational pull as we shot up into the sky. My hair whisked around in the cold air. I pressed closer to his chest as we glided through the air. When we finally landed the place sounded more desolate than the last. The sounds of the city and the people were gone. 
He walked for a minute and I heard a door swing open.
 �Take her to the basement. I don&#8217;t have time to deal with her right now. I still have to get my fix tonight, she was just a snack,� he told someone and handed me over. 
�Where are you taking me?� I asked as a heavily built man carried me into a building. 
The dizziness and euphoria was melting away.
�Don&#8217;t worry about, just stay quiet,� he replied.
�I&#8217;m serious, I don&#8217;t understand what&#8217;s going on, I don&#8217;t want to do this,� I whined, but my body was still limp and unable to resist.
I could hear his shoes clanking against a hardwood floor. I could hear voices weaving through corridors. He set me down on the floor for a minute as he unlocked a heavy, creaking door. Then I went in his arms again and he took us down a flight of stairs. The stairs sounded like concrete or something gritty, scrapping against the souls of his shoes. The air was warm and moist. There was a radiator ticking somewhere. 
I had just enough strength now to reach for my blindfold. I was about to take it off when he spoke.
�I wouldn&#8217;t do that if I were you,� he insisted.
I shook off the ever fading dizziness and grabbed at my blindfold.
He squeezed my tiny, weak body with his huge arms and bite into neck. I didn&#8217;t feel any blood drain, but I felt the euphoria again, sinking into helplessness once more. It was as if there was poison in the bite, weakening me. I was unable to move; my eyelids shutting and eyes rolling back. My arms went limp and I couldn&#8217;t speak.
�I&#8217;m sorry, you left me no choice,� he said remorsefully.
�It should ware off in a minute, I had to sedate you,� he said.
There was a jingle of keys, and a rattle of a cage; it was definitely something that sounded metallic, maybe a wire fence or a kennel. A door popped from its lock and scrapped against the concrete floor.&nbsp; 
I felt him place me down on the ground within the boundaries of this place; at least there was a woolen blanket beneath me. He stepped out and returned once again. I was awake enough to lean up against the wall near my blanket. I felt that I was at a corner of this kennel-like enclosure. Wire fence-like mesh was running up the walls as I leaned against them. He pulled a heavy, leather hood over my head, with my blindfold still underneath, avoiding taking it off completely. He tilted my head towards him and downward, tightening the braiding of the hood at the back of my head and buckling the collar strap of the hood around my neck. I heard the snap of a padlock and felt the weight of it pulling at the back of my neck. The hood was completely encompassing, aside from a wide opening at the mouth.
He grabbed my wrists and strapped leather cuffs on each one, locking them in place once they were buckled tightly enough. He hooked the two wrist cuffs together with some sort of a metal clip or carabiner behind my back, running a long chain through the restraints up to the wall where I figured it was hooked. He left for another minute to grab a few more things and came back to toss on some ankle cuffs, although he chose not to retrain my feet. 
 �I figure I&#8217;m all done here. Elliot should have the keys for those,� he said, without giving it another thought.
When he left, I thought I would explore. I had enough strength, although my knees were still shaky. I stood up and walked around, running my fingers along the sides of the supposed kennel.&nbsp; My cell was taller than me; I could stand up straight and walk without hitting my head on anything. I felt a few large hooks in the walls jutting past the wire mesh, some had chains hanging from them; others didn&#8217;t. The metal mesh surrounded me on either side as far as I could go before my chain ran out of leeway. I could get to two corners of the cage. The other two extended beyond my reach, the door was at the unreachable far end. The kennel was obviously in a rectangular shape.
I had a woolen blanket, unable to spread it out without the use of my hands, I would have to sleep on top of it, without a cover, but the room was warm enough to do that. There was also an empty plastic bucket near my bedding; I assumed that was my bathroom. It would be tedious to try to sit on without the use of my hands, but doable. 
The rest was a mystery; I would have to wait for more clues. Once I felt comfortable enough, I settled on the blanket. Although it was warm in the room, I felt miserably cold and anxious. My head spun, I was nauseous. My skin was sticky and grimy and I was lonely, it was hard to fall asleep like this.
Were my friends going to come looking for me, or were they at least going to tell my parents where we were supposed to meet? In a way, I didn&#8217;t want them to come looking for me, I didn&#8217;t want them to get hurt. They wouldn&#8217;t have a clue as to who they were dealing with. Were the police going to look for me or was I going to become just another missing person case?
&nbsp; I imagined my friends finding me in this filthy condition. How embarrassing would it be to have them looking down at me. My parents ran through my head, what would they do? I thought about everyone, and then I saw Elliot watching me with his dark, illustrious eyes. He was more prominent in my thoughts than anyone else.
I fell asleep soon after that, unable to understand what was happening to me, and what was going to come. He was going to play with me until he was bored, what did that mean? Was he going to hurt me enough to make me wish I was dead? What did he want from me? Would he let me go once he was done with me or was he really going to finish me off?
I woke up to the clanking of aluminum dishes against the concrete floor. 
�I thought you could use something to eat,� the heavy man from last night was back, I could recognize his deep voice.
He pressed the doggie dish up against my side where I could feel it. I rolled over and scooted towards it, sticking my tongue out first to feel the aluminum frame of the dish and then went in for food inside. It was plain oatmeal on one end and water on the other. I grunted and rolled away wearily.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You don&#8217;t have to eat it if you don&#8217;t want to,� he sighed.
�What&#8217;s going to happen to me?� I asked.
�That&#8217;s pretty much obvious, isn&#8217;t it?� he laughed and shut the door behind him. 
I listened as he made his way up the stairs and out the door.
�Are you going to eat that?� asked a small, mousey voice.
I jumped nervously and looked around, although I already knew I wouldn&#8217;t be able to see anything. It was a female voice, someone young, like me.
�I don&#8217;t think so. I seem to have lost my appetite somewhere in the middle of that vampire kidnap,� I said lightly. 
She didn&#8217;t seem to enjoy my humor.
�Well then can you pass it along over here?�
�Where am I supposed to pass it?�If you can&#8217;t tell, I&#8217;ve got a mask on my face.�
�Sorry, just turn to your left a little, scoot out as far as you can towards the door and kick the dish over.�
I got up from my blanket, felt the dish with my feet and pushed it along down the kennel until I ran out of chain. I turned to my left a bit and kicked the dish. I heard it hit the far end of the kennel as the wire mesh rattled. 
�Perfect!� she applauded.
�Who are you? Do you know where we are?� I asked as I sat back down on the blanket.
�I&#8217;m really not in the mood to talk,� she snapped.
I could hear her reaching through the mesh to grab at the dish; she was having a hard time.
�I just gave you all of the food I had, isn&#8217;t that enough to answer a few of my questions?� 
She was starting to irritate me.
�Oh, excuse me. Where did I lose my manners? Oh yeah, in the fucking hell hole we&#8217;re in right now. I don&#8217;t want to talk to you because I don&#8217;t have anything to tell you. If fact, I&#8217;m just like you; a stupid girl who was at the wrong place at the wrong time. I happened to run into some vampires who thought it would be a good idea to drag me along with them and use me as a fuck toy and whatever else they could come up with,� she hissed.
�I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;m just scared and I thought you could help me.�
�Help you? I can barely help myself; in fact, I&#8217;ve been here for months now. I don&#8217;t even know whether I&#8217;d just be better off dead,� she said.
 �What do they do to you?� I asked more carefully.
�That, my dear, you&#8217;ll have the pleasure of finding out yourself,� she laughed.
There was a moment of silence between us.
�Let me just spell it out for you. Elliot&#8217;s some sort of sadistic bastard; I&#8217;m not even sure whether he was ever really human. He&#8217;s the oldest vampire in this house. The others are his kin. They&#8217;ll pretty much do whatever he orders them to do. I don&#8217;t want to waste time getting to know you because I don&#8217;t know how long you&#8217;ll be here. You&#8217;re not the first; I&#8217;ve out lived two others in the past few months. There&#8217;s always someone who kills them, honestly, I don&#8217;t even know how I&#8217;ve made it this long. Elliot will play with you for a few weeks, and then he&#8217;ll get bored and finish you off. There have been a few who he turned, but I know for damn sure that I&#8217;m not going to be one of those and I haven&#8217;t seen him turn anyone while I&#8217;ve been here. My advice is, if you get a chance to make a run for it, just do it. He&#8217;s never going to care about you or love you or turn you. You see he plays these games just to mess with your head. I honestly thought he would turn me at one point, but instead he tried to have me for dinner one night. Some of the other vamps asked him to keep me alive, they thought I made a good fuck toy, someone they could use on demand and that&#8217;s all I&#8217;ve been for who knows how long,� she explained.
�I&#8217;m sorry to hear that, I don&#8217;t even know how to reply to that,� I said quietly.
�You don&#8217;t have to; I know it&#8217;s even hard to believe this is happening. What&#8217;s harder to believe still is that we&#8217;ll both probably die here. How does it feel to know that you&#8217;ll die in some dark basement in a dog cage, butt naked and shamed?� she said coldly.
I didn&#8217;t know how to reply that, so I didn&#8217;t.
�They call me Jay. It&#8217;s not my real name, but that doesn&#8217;t matter around here,� she started up again.
�What&#8217;s your name?� she asked.
�My name is Lucy.�
�L is for Lucy, they&#8217;ll call you Elle when the time comes,� she said.
�The other girls were Dee and Kay.� 
I didn&#8217;t reply.
�Fine be that way, I was the one who didn&#8217;t want to talk in the first place.�
I was still thinking about the cage and the fact that I would inevitably die here. It wasn&#8217;t the easiest pill to swallow. 
After some time, another guest made their way downstairs. I could tell it wasn&#8217;t the heavy set man. The bounce in their step and the shuffle of their shoes was different. There was also a strong odor of a lit cigarette and musky cologne in the air. I knew it was Elliot before he even announced himself. The room grew ever smaller as he neared. 
�Get on your knees and kneel before me, you stupid bitch,� he shouted and kicked the cage next to mine.
I shook in the corner of my kennel as he threw open the door to Jay&#8217;s cage and stormed inside. I heard him slap her bare skin several times.
�Did anyone give you permission to eat her food, you fat cow? If we wanted to fatten you up we would have given you double your daily ration. Someone will be in for you later, I don&#8217;t have enough time for this,� he grunted.
She was crying softly as he locked her kennel door and made his way over to mine.
He open the kennel door and gracefully made his way in, I sat breathlessly, stiff as a statue, waiting for his next move. He stood over me and smoked. Then he slid the dog dish towards me with his foot. I could tell he was just watching me, waiting to see if I had any nervous ticks. I didn&#8217;t make a move. He knelt down beside me, took a drag of his cigarette and blew it in my face. That smell was so appetizing; I could have used a smoke right then and there.&nbsp; I licked my lips unintentionally.
Elliot let out a soft, almost unnoticeable chuckle at the sight. He knew. 
He took another drag and proceeded to run the cigarette down my shoulder, just barely above the skin, tapping it lightly and occasionally letting the ashes singe the fine hairs on my skin. 
�You&#8217;re not really afraid of me are you?� 
�I am afraid� Sir,� I replied.
�But you&#8217;re not though. I know what you&#8217;re thinking. You&#8217;ll find a way out, your parents and friends and the cops will show up. You might get a little fucked up over the next few days but you&#8217;ll make it out just fine. And hell, you might even enjoy yourself, after all� being bitten feels fantastic,� he said bitterly.
He pulled away his cigarette and it hissed as he put it out in my food. 
�But here&#8217;s the hard truth, my dear pet. I don&#8217;t like you, what I do like is that fact that you&#8217;re going to suffer. I&#8217;m going to make you suffer. I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;re attractive, I don&#8217;t like your personality, and as a matter of fact, I could have picked out someone a lot better to play with. But you pissed me off; you thought you were better than me. You waltzed right into my bar, talked to my friend and completely dismissed me. And after you were done walking out on someone who could have made you very happy, you decided to assault that person with a broken glass bottle. True, I probably would have killed you that night if we did hook up, seeing as I am a vampire, but still it&#8217;s the thought. You really thought you were above me. And now I&#8217;m going to make you wish you would have thought differently, you would have probably been better off just dying quickly and painlessly last night,� he said.
�I&#8217;m sorry about that; I already apologized the night before. I stopped when you told me to, didn&#8217;t I? I chose to let you take advantage of me and to humiliated me. I could have kept running, but I didn&#8217;t. Doesn&#8217;t that count for anything?� I replied.
�Don&#8217;t talk to me like that, you&#8217;re beneath me. You know how to address me and you don&#8217;t have the right to argue with me. This is my final warning,� he snapped.
�Get on your knees, now!� he ordered and I felt a waft of air run past me as he hurriedly stood up again.
I climbed on my knees to the best of my ability; it was a challenge to get myself up and balanced without the use of my hands. 
�I don&#8217;t care about how you tried to make up for it, you&#8217;re going to have a long road ahead of you to put you in your place,� he warned.
�What do you want me to do? I&#8217;ll do anything I already said that. I just want to pretend this never happened and go back to my friends and family, you can let me go and I&#8217;ll never mention this. Besides, you don&#8217;t control me, not really. If it weren&#8217;t for your venomous bite, I wouldn&#8217;t even be here, you&#8217;re a coward and you&#8217;re evil, and demented. If it weren&#8217;t that bite, no one would want to be with you, you&#8217;re a pervert!� I shouted suddenly.
I didn&#8217;t know where my rage came from. I felt defenseless in a sense, but I still had my mouth and I could use it. The man needed to hear the truth. Without his alluring, addictive adrenaline high of a bite, he would have never got this far with me. I still couldn&#8217;t figure out why I didn&#8217;t just run for it. 
�I want you to shut the fuck up! I already told you more than once that you&#8217;re not allowed to speak to me that way. I hope this will be the last time you talk to me this way. I hope you learn your lesson this time around, and chose your words and your actions more wisely in the future,� he said in a low tone of voice.
I wanted to keep going, but I knew there was no sense in it. Whatever I said, was exactly what I wanted him to hear. Whatever his punishment would be, the worth of my words would be valued. He heard them, so they would have some sort of an effect on him.
�Stand up,� he ordered.
I stood up; my body was thrilled with a new sense of empowerment. I knew that I had some sort of say in our dysfunctional relationship. He unlocked the contraption behind my back, removing the chain and metal clip, leaving the cuffs on. He grabbed my hand and led me out of the kennel.
Although I hated him and I was already tired of the game that hadn&#8217;t begun, his hands were still pleasing to the touch; I found some secret comfort there. He led me to, what I assumed, was the center of the room.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Arms up,� he ordered.
I raised my arms up in great hesitation. He laced chain from the ceiling to my wrist cuffs and arranged it in a way where I would have to stand on my tiptoes to hold up my weight. This posture made me uncomfortable. I felt naked, I remembered I was naked. 
Although, I had felt so pompous earlier, again I felt unnerved. I was naked, chained and incapable of defending myself. I started to squirm. It wasn&#8217;t a conscious choice; it was more of the animal inside of me, trying to break loose. I wasn&#8217;t used to being in this situation; I couldn&#8217;t understand why I had been so calm thus far. This man was really going to hurt me; he had no intention of making it anything more than that for me. I was honestly scared.
�Sir, Sir I&#8217;m sorry, okay there I admit it, I&#8217;m sorry. I didn&#8217;t mean any of that stuff, Sir. If you could just imagine how I must be feeling right now. Imagine you were in my shoes for a minute, Sir. Please, you don&#8217;t have to do any of this; I won&#8217;t say anything stupid anymore. I&#8217;m sorry, I just got ahead of myself, Sir,� I started to ramble.
He grabbed me by the cheeks and squeezed aggressively, even shaking my head slightly.
�You have absolutely no self discipline. That&#8217;s alright. It will be my pleasure to teach you. It was my mistake to assume you had any common sense. Some people just don&#8217;t get raised up that way. You don&#8217;t have to beg, what&#8217;s done is done. Now you must pay the price of your mistake. Next time don&#8217;t do it,� he said and let go.
I shook my head nervously, starting to cry, although it wasn&#8217;t obvious behind my hood. Sweat drops were forming on my neck and chest now. He ran his fingers through them on his way to my breast. He pinched and flicked my nipple lightly trying to erect it; he did it to the other until they were both firm. My senses were enthralled; I couldn&#8217;t help but feel aroused.
�Much better, now onto more pressing matters,� he said.
He walked away for a moment, and then I heard the crack of a whip behind me before he swung at my back. He was trying it out for good measure, but when he was ready, he didn&#8217;t hold back. I let out a loud grown.&nbsp; He hit me again harder. I let out an angry growl.
�Here&#8217;s where our lesson begins. I give you an order. You follow it, no matter the situation, it&#8217;s that simple. I asked you to call me Sir, well you forgot all about that one. I asked you to speak to me as if I were a figure of authority, obviously, you didn&#8217;t agree with that one either. We&#8217;re going to practice a little, here&#8217;s your next task; if you feel the need to scream out and start ranting about how much you hate me, or feel the need to beg me to stop, save yourself the trouble and thank me instead. I&#8217;ll reward you for a thank you, I&#8217;ll punish you for a foul tongue,� he explained as he continued lashing me.
 I tried to plan for the next strike, but he got me again as I wiggled. Each strike felt so harsh against my skin. Every lash of the whip felt like it was digging deeper into my skin. I started to panic, wrestling the chains that held me in place, and my feet were tired to trying to stay put. My arms were tired of staying up. 
I grunted and I growled, but I refused to thank him. I thought I&#8217;d rather take the pain without a word than thank him for it. He lashed the whip against my legs; I sprang around in place trying to avoid the next blow. The irritating, and slowly growing pain was starting to get to me. I felt victimized, unable to move from where I was at. The animal inside of me was about to break lose. Never in my comfortable life had a felt so enraged. 
I tore at my restraints, trying to show that I was done with his game. I spun my body around; he started beating me from the front. He focused on my breasts until they were raw. My head my aching, my body was growing weak. My exasperated breathing was making me light headed, but I continued to fight. I ground my teeth and kept my mouth shut, only letting out the agitated screams, muffled by my shut lips.
There was a moment of weakness as he spun me around and started on my back again, the renewed pain, tipped me over the edge, I didn&#8217;t mean to, but I bent my leg back and kicked him as hard as I could. He grabbed my foot, turned the whip to the handle side and started canning it. He wacked it as hard as he could until it ached and grew numb, I could feel my foot curling it, muscles aching. 
�Fuck!� I screamed.
�Fuck you, you fucking bastard!� I shouted.
�For crying out loud, you sick sadistic bastard!� I continued.
�Let go of me, I hate you!� I kept it up.
I hopped around on the only foot left on the ground, trying to escape the small, yet pungent pain at the core of my other foot. With every crack of the handle, shoots of pain ran up my leg, the muscles of my calf were cramping. I screamed and wiggled my foot from his grasp. The initial relief to my foot was short lived as he returned to whipping me. He went back around and started up on my chest again. This time was worse than the last; my chest was already sore and irritated from the time before.
�You&#8217;re only making it worse and you know. You&#8217;ve already broken all three rules,� he said calmly.
�You&#8217;re at the disadvantage and you keep forgetting it,� he laughed, �we can do this all day, however long it takes you to learn a few simple rules.�
I fell into despair, unknowing when the torture would stop, I quit fighting it. I let my chains hold my weight as I breathed deeply and let my body hang loosely. He noticed the change and stopped. 
�Are you rearranging your attitude?� he asked as he ran his hand down my sore breasts.
�Yes, Sir,� I replied with defeat in my voice.
�We&#8217;ll see how long that lasts,� he said.
I heard him walk over to the corner of the room and set down his whip. He grabbed something else of a shelf and walked back over. He circled me a few times, grabbed my ass and squeezed it. Then he lit up a cigarette. The air filled with that nostalgic smell.
�I bet you want a drag of this,� he said and paused for a moment.
�Do you think you deserve it?� he asked.
�No, Sir,� I sighed.
I probably would have gotten a whole cigarette to myself if I would have dropped a thank you in there somewhere. 
�That&#8217;s right, you don&#8217;t even deserve it,� he said.
Again I heard the lighter click, this time he was lighting something else. He circled around a few more times and finished his cigarette. I felt a sizzling stream of wax run from my shoulder down my breast and belly.
�Candle wax is wonderful, it&#8217;s so sensual; you don&#8217;t have to be a sadistic bastard like myself to enjoy it. Too bad I&#8217;m not trying to making this sensual; I want to make sure you&#8217;re crying underneath there,� he laughed.
�This waxy brew has been cooked up just for you, its scalding hot, and slow to harden;&nbsp; I&#8217;m hoping we can get a few heat pockets going, and see you really squirm,� he said.
He brushed off the dried wax and poured a new layer on my breasts. Not hot enough to make me moan, but enough to really feel a punch. I took a deep breath and let the thick liquid run down my chest and belly. He scraped the new layer off and poured more without waiting for it to cool completely. The coat was hot and irritating my skin increasingly. I wiggled my waist trying to promote the wax to harden and fall off, but it only moved with my figure, still too warm to cool completely. He scraped again and poured repeatedly, the areas that had already been covered several times were beginning to ache. My sores from the earlier beating were burning quite badly from this repetition.
The slow torture was grueling. Each scrape and reapplication to the same area was more painful than the last. I went from grunting to whimpering.&nbsp; I wanted to beg for him to stop, but I knew it was pointless. 
�Thank you, Sir,� I squirmed as he applied a new dose of the scalding wax.
�I can&#8217;t believe what I&#8217;m hearing,� he laughed.
I wanted to add a few things after that thank you, perhaps some not-so-friendly recommendations or requests for him to stop what he was doing, but I knew that wouldn&#8217;t get me anywhere.
�Thank you, Sir,� I cried out again as he went over his meticulous procedure.
�I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ve had enough,� he said calmly.
He stopped pouring for a second and circled my body, waiting for the wax to dry. It was making me weak, too hot in my mask. Too helpless, my arms were heavy and weak from holding most of my weight. I waited for the last of the wax to dry, counting down the remaining minutes of the timely torture. 
He walked away, came back, paced around. Whack! He cracked a thin, cane against my ass. I screamed, and then I started to cry. I thought we were done. I was waiting for us to be done, and now he was starting on a new venture. I kicked the ground with the tips of my toes, unable to do anything else. Snot was pouring from my nose to my lips, I couldn&#8217;t brush it away, which humiliated me more and I continued to cry. Forgetting all about my torturer, I started feeling sorry for myself. 
The canning was less persistent than the whipping. He would hit me once and wait for me to start crying again. I would settle down in my loss and over all grief, admit to myself the failure and helplessness I was in, and then he would hit me again. I would roll my head, start to cry again, unable to beg him to stop, I would wait for the pain to subside and he would hit me once more. This happened about ten times, if I can recall correctly. Then he put away his toy and unstrapped my wrists cuffs from the chain. 
I toppled to the floor defenselessly and without a bit of energy left to try to do anything. He pulled my head up by the chin. I heard metal on metal clink as he attached something to the collar of my hood. I felt a tug, as he started to walk. I didn&#8217;t understand at first. He paused and tugged again.
�You don&#8217;t honestly think I&#8217;m going to carry you again do you? You&#8217;ve got arms and legs use them,� he said.
The tugging was something like a leash pulling at my collar. I reached my hands up to my neck and felt it between my fingers. I quickly brushed the snot off my lips. He yanked on the leash; I realized he wasn&#8217;t going to give me a minute. My hands fell back to the ground to catch myself in place. I was about to stand up when he stopped me.
�No, stay on your hands and knees, I want you to crawl,� he ordered.
Again I felt alone because of his degradation. I followed as he pulled me around the room, having me cover the same area over and over again, I could tell we were going in circles. Finally he led me into a new area, I could feel the ridge of a door frame and the flooring changed from concrete to tile. 
�Stay!� he ordered.
�Tell me you&#8217;ll be a good girl and behave,� he said in a baby voice.
I wanted to spit on him.
�I&#8217;ll be a good girl and behave, Sir,� I said.
�I&#8217;m glad to hear that,� he said and patted me on the head.
I sat down on my knees and waited as he left the room. As soon as I heard him go up the stairs, I jumped up. I had collected enough energy and adrenaline to get up and move. The pain was only a mere memory but the real threat was the thought that this misery would continue. I couldn&#8217;t stand the idea of having another episode of this torture. I got up on my feet and felt around the room, I felt a marble-like counter, a sink, and a towel rack; I was obviously in the bathroom. I felt for the door frame and made my way out of the bathroom and back into the main room. 
Again I grabbed at the back of my mask and felt for some sort of loose end, the lock was definitely staying, the braiding on there was somehow weaved up behind the collar where I couldn&#8217;t reach it. I tried to tug on the strings but there must have been a few knots.
�It&#8217;s pointless, you&#8217;ll have to find some scissors,� Jay said.
I had forgotten all about her. 
�There&#8217;s a counter to your left,� she said.
I reached my hand out feeling for a wall, following it until I reached a counter. I grabbed at the first thing I could feel, a roll of duct tape, that wouldn&#8217;t help. 
�Careful!� she exclaimed.
I grazed my fingers over a glass jar; if I had been any closer I would have knocked it off the counter.
�It&#8217;s so dark in here, I can barely see over there, but I know there have to be some scissors, I&#8217;ve seen Elliot use them before. Check the box, it&#8217;s further down,� she directed.
I felt the box; I took off the lid and reached my hand inside. It was hardware. There were a few padlocks, chains, clamps, and magnets. I grunted, what a waste of time, I didn&#8217;t have much of it left. I continued to run my hand down the long stretch of counter top. Scissors!
I felt scissors, I couldn&#8217;t believe it! I grabbed the pair and was about to cut the mask when I heard voices and footsteps upstairs. I stumbled over the counter and myself as I ran back towards the bathroom. I felt the doorway and tile and sat back on the floor again, holding my scissors behind my back.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t know where else to hide them, I changed my mind remembering that I couldn&#8217;t defend myself against them with a pair of scissors, they were vampires. I felt the counter and the cabinets below, throwing the scissors in the first one I opened.
The basement door creaked open and I heard two or three pairs of footsteps. They were talking but I couldn&#8217;t recognize anyone&#8217;s voice except for Elliot&#8217;s. 
�Can you ladies just clean her up a bit?� Elliot asked.
Two women had accompanied him. I could tell by their voices and the high heels they were wearing, which made loud, clicking noises again the concrete basement floor.
�Anything for you, Elliot,� they replied in sync.
He parted ways with them at the bathroom door. Someone grabbed me by the leash and led me up to the bathtub.
�Stand up please,� one of them ordered.
I got up from my hands and knees and followed her to the tub.
 �You&#8217;re going to have to get into the bathtub, so watch your step,� she said and grabbed my hand.
I smiled in her direction and let her help me in.
�The water is a bit cold, you understand,� the other said and started the shower.
I felt the chilly water run down my chest as the women scrubbed the wax off with a sponge; it scratched at my sore skin and reminded me of the damage done earlier. I cringed, but I remember the scissors and I still had hope. Once they were done, they dried me off with some towels and led me out of the bathroom and back into my kennel.&nbsp; Elliot had no objection with me walking on my own two feet this time; he was done humiliating me for the time being. 
When we entered the kennel, Elliot told me to stay still as he unlocked my mask. Someone else kept it pressed against the front of my face as he undid the collar and lacing. 
�This is going to be for your own good, there&#8217;s a lesson to be learned here. I&#8217;m going to shut you down and start you up again, give you a fresh chance to start over with me, keep that in mind,� he said. 
When there was enough wiggle room in my hood, he had his female companion reach up and stuff an ear plug in each of my ears. As soon as they were applied, the hood was quickly closed up again. I couldn&#8217;t see or hear them. I felt someone put a straw up to my lips and push it in my mouth. I sucked up the water at the end of it. I drank until there nothing left.
Someone pried my mouth open with their fingers and stuffed my mouth full of thick, gauze like material. Then tapped my mouth shut, leaving only a small hole above my lips and just below my nose, for a breathing hole. My wrists were tied behind my back. 
When they were done tapping my mouth, they moved down to the neck and around my arms, spinning duct tape in circles around my body. They got down to my pelvic region and stopped. My arms were completely immobilized within the wrappings of the tape. Just below the pubic area and butt, they started again, wrapping the tape around my thighs and knees. I was unable to balance or stand anymore. Someone grabbed me and held me in place. They locked my ankle cuffs together and finished wrapping duct tape around me at the ankle cuffs. Someone else grabbed me by the ankles and the two of them picked me up and placed my body of the ground. I used the exposed tips of my fingers to feel the ground beneath me. Someone must have noticed my curiosity and rolled me on my stomach, pressing my hands with together, covered them with tape. 
I rolled to my side when I had enough energy. Complete silence and blindness; this was sensory deprivation to the fullest extent, I just lay, unknowing what to do next. No one touched me, or moved me again. I didn&#8217;t know whether they had left the room, or whether they were just standing over me watching me, talking about me. The idea that I was completely aware, but unable to act upon it, scared me.
I couldn&#8217;t do anything but roll when I became uncomfortable. I had nothing to think about expect for the few things that had happen to me in the past day or so. I feel asleep soon, there was nothing else I could do. 
There was no way to know how much time had passed when I finally woke up. My dreams were strange, unable to move in my humanly form, my dreams were full of the same expression. Unable to move in my dreams, trapped, encompassed somehow, frozen. I woke up sweating. I couldn&#8217;t scratch, I couldn&#8217;t move, the phobia was starting to get to my head.
I rolled in one direction, the other, trying to think of any creative way to escape. This wouldn&#8217;t be the time. How long would I be this way, would I even fall asleep again, or would I just be lying around for days? I imagined days doing absolutely nothing, starving, laying in my own piss, with nothing to distract me, but my thoughts.
I started to panic, scaring myself at the thought of this, but it was inevitable, I would be lying in my own piss soon. And how much time had gone by, how much longer to go? I peed myself, unknowing how much longer I would have to wait. There was a thin padding underneath me. I could feel it with the slit of skin I had exposed around my genial area. I assumed this was meant for me to pee on. 
After some time, someone rolled my mummified body over and pulled the pad from beneath me, replacing it with a dry one. They ran a wet wipe down my genital area, it was a poor attempt with the room they were left to access, but it was sufficient. I was embarrassed to say the least. 
Again it was silent, no one bothered me. I was drawn to the thoughts of my family looking for me or my friends finding me. But above all, I was drawn to Elliot and the game he was playing. How could I win? Follow his rules until he got bored with me and killed me? Or fight him and keep him entertained until I had my chance to escape? I had the scissors, they were waiting for me, I would have a chance to free myself and make a run for it soon enough. This argument went on in my head for what felt like hours, analyzing every aspect of the situation. 
I felt a tickle at my foot. I brushed it off at first. Then it grew stronger, I tried to wiggle away, but it was difficult in my position. I tried to laugh, but all the came out was a muffled sound. As it continued, my constricted airway gave me little choice; I was gasping for air through the thick gauze. My body was drenched with sweat for head to toe. I felt completely incapable of doing absolutely anything. This set me into an extreme panic, but the more I toiled and the more anxious I got, the more uncomfortable my restraints became.
The tickling stopped; I lay very still trying to catch my breath, wheezing helplessly through my tiny air hole. When everything became still, I was expecting something else, but again, I was left to myself and my contemplation. 
Time had passed wearily, as I felt a pair of fingers graze my ass cheek. I was lying on my side at the time. It was a masculine hand, if I was correct, it was Elliot&#8217;s hand. He bent my body at the center where it was free, pushing out my ass. Then he ran his fingers slowly down the crevasse of it, feeling over every inch of skin. 
I felt like I had no choice but to follow his fingers with my imagination. My mind was so bored and depraved, it couldn&#8217;t think of a single better thing to do. So I followed his fingers as they slid down my crack, past my butthole, barely touching the outskirts of my womanly folds. I started to sweat again, the caress was marvelous, addicting. I could feel my juices start to flow. He restarted at my butthole, his freshly moistened fingers, circling it, taking tiny dips in, just enough to feel a bit of pressure. 
I was so turned on, my body was nearly shaking. My heart was beating so hard, my mouth was drooling around the gauze. My hands were drenched with sweat within the duct tape. I could do this forever, I wanted more!
He stopped what he was doing and started up at my vaginal opening. Petting it so gently, it left you moaning for more. He used my own running lubrication to trace his fingers around the slender opening. Again he stopped and went back to the asshole. With his other hand he started tickling me feet. I didn&#8217;t know what to do. Enjoy the gentle, erotic caress or squirm away from the tickle. If I squirmed, the tickle had no guarantee of being over, it could follow me wherever I went, but his fondling was so gently and timid, it could be gone with one blink of an eye. I couldn&#8217;t decide which one I wanted.
The agony nearly brought me to orgasm, so helpless, so turned on, at the same time in complete and utter torment. I finally wiggled my feet away from the tickling tips of his fingers and he stopped the tickling and the caressing immediately. 
This was my first real taste of his game, in the simplest way. He was going to play with me, until I didn&#8217;t know what I wanted. The pain and the pleasure would come hand in hand. He would fight me until I submitted; then the real games would begin.
I was hooked, maybe it was just the boredom or inability to distract myself from the situation, but I was stuck in his world now and I couldn&#8217;t wait for the next thing he had in mind. Somewhere within this trance and the tiny tease of pleasure he allowed me, I began to build a new persona for him. He seemed erotic, interesting and arousing. Those dark eyes, those textured hands, he was captivating in my imagination, I wanted him to touch me again, even tickle me if that&#8217;s what he wanted, just as long as we connected somehow.
My dream came true for a moment; he came back after a long wait and rolled me onto my back. He spread my lower lips and pinched my clit, I broke out in sweat. I felt him stuff a tiny vibrator against it. My legs did a fine job of holding it in place, as they were pinned together so finely with the tape. The massage didn&#8217;t have to last long for my nerves to give way. I was on the verge of an orgasm. I felt my body shaking lightly, my ass tightening, my cheeks flushed. Then he grabbed the vibrator and removed it.
I sighed hopelessly. He pressed his hand firmly against my neck and held it there until I lost any ability to breath; it wasn&#8217;t a far step from where I was already at. I started to squirm for my life, again reacting only the way nature intended me to do. He let go, I tried to gasp for air, but it was limited, this all made me very dizzy.
He pressed the vibrator against my clit again. I was still trying to come back from the choking, but it didn&#8217;t take long for my body to be distracted by the pleasurable feeling in between my legs. The orgasm came up quick, trying to make a retrieve from the missed opportunity before. But he pulled it away as soon as he saw that my body was on the verge of orgasm again.
Once more he choked me, I didn&#8217;t try to fight it, knowing that he would let go, but he was being testy with me, and he held me down longer than the time before. When I finally thought I would faint, I tried to roll away. In my restraints, I was becoming weaker, growing tired quickly.
He placed the vibrator on my clit again, but the orgasm had been wasted. It would take time now, the initial eagerness was gone. I relaxed my tense body and lay quietly as the vibrator caressed my clit. From my own experience, I knew that another orgasm would be next to impossible. 
Suddenly, I felt a surge of energy, an orgasm, much stronger than the last was creeping up on me. I squeezed my vaginal muscles; trying to apply some pressure. I strained my back, flexed my ass, begging for this new release. He grabbed the vibrator, I screamed, but the only sound was a muffled moan from my gag. He was probably standing over me laughing, I felt so weak. 
He didn&#8217;t attempt it again. I had never been able to get that far so fast, maybe it was the new type of sexual stimulation; in any case, I was hooked. I rolled back and forth in my restraints bitterly; so angry and greedy for a sexual sensation. I shouted through my gag, screamed, begged and pleaded. I wasn&#8217;t going to die without the orgasm, but it was almost as if I needed to get all of my energy out. It was so overwhelming, I wanted to fuck. 
No one came to my rescue. I whined and fought with myself until I grew tired and bored. Again, I went back to quietly waiting for something, anything at all. After a while, I fell asleep again. 
I woke up as someone was pulling the tape off of my mouth. I tried to jump up, but I was still tied down. A pair of familiar fingers pulled the gauze from my mouth. My lips were dry and crusty as he ran his fingers around the opening of my mouth. Slowly they progressed inside, just barely sliding against the tips of my teeth; I closed my mouth around them, pulling them further in.
His fingertips were rough and detailed; I could feel the ridges and creases of each fingertip as I explored them with my tongue. He pushed down deeper, feeling his way down my throat. I started panting at the thought of his cock inside my mouth, running down my throat, I tried to pull him in deeper, but my restraints would not allow my head to move much, and he pulled them out, before I could even really try. 
After a moment of hesitation, I felt a blade run up my ankle, dull side up against my skin; he was cutting off the tape. He unhooked my ankles and I stretched my legs and knees. Then he proceeded by removing the rest of the tape and finally the hood, leaving the blindfold on.
Removing the ear plugs, Elliot petted my ear lightly.
�We&#8217;re starting over, I&#8217;m going to give you a few simple rules to follow, they&#8217;re even simpler than the ones I tried to train you with before. I&#8217;m only going to say these rules once, if you can&#8217;t obey them, we&#8217;ll just have to do this again until you can,� he threatened softly.
�You don&#8217;t do anything unless I permit you to, that means no speaking, no moving, nothing at all. If I do speak to you directly and expect a reply, you will answer accordingly, addressing me as Sir and referring to yourself in third person until otherwise directed. When I remove your blindfold, you are only allowed to look at the ground, if I am within eyeshot of you, you are required to look at my feet,� he said.
�If you break any of these ground rules, expect a much harsher consequence; this should have been cake in comparison to what awaits you,� he added.
He removed my blindfold and I stared down at the concrete floor of my kennel. Elliot&#8217;s shoes were within eyeshot, so were a woman&#8217;s. I kept my eyes on his. I could hear her shoes shuffling softly against the ground as she went around the back and helped me sit up. She unhooked my wrists cuffs. 
�On your hands and knees,� he ordered.
I got on my hands and knees obediently. 
�Go out to the middle of the room and stay there,� he said.
I climbed out of the kennel and crawled to what I assumed was the center of the basement. 
�Valentine, could you be a dear and grab my things?� he said to the woman.
The woman left the kennel and walked to the bathroom, he walked up to me.
�Since we&#8217;re getting off on a fresh start, I thought I&#8217;d give you a chance to clear your name,� he offered.
�Is there anything you want to apologize for?� he asked.
I sat momentarily thinking; hadn&#8217;t I begged for his forgiveness earlier? What more did he want from me? He patiently waited for my reply. The scissors came to mind, I had definitely disobeyed and there was no doubt in my mind that he found them already, he would have noticed all of his things scattered around the counter. But what if he hadn&#8217;t found them? Was there a way I could phrase my reply that wouldn&#8217;t give away the location of the scissors, yet apologize for the mess? 
�This girl is sorry for disobeying earlier, Sir,� I said.
If felt strange to speak again, and even stranger to speak in third person.
�I want you to refer to yourself in demeaning ways; this slut, this cunt, this slave, well, you get the idea whatever comes to mind, be creative,� he laughed.
�Now, tell me; how exactly did you disobey me? So that at least I know we&#8217;re on the same page,� he said.
�This� slut is sorry for not staying in the bathroom earlier and instead going out here and making a mess, Sir,� I said.
�You did make a mess, but I forgive you, is there anything else?� he asked.
I hesitated. Was it worth the risk to hide the scissors?
�This whore has nothing else to apologize for, Sir,� I lied.
�Are you sure? It would be so awkward to find out you were lying later and have to punish you for that. Why did you make a mess out here, were you looking for anything in particular?� he asked.
�This slave was acting stupid, she did not know what she was looking for, Sir, she was just scared, Sir,� I replied.
 �I&#8217;m not going to punish you for being honest. If that&#8217;s all that happened, then you&#8217;re forgiven. I just want you to see, it isn&#8217;t all so bad,� he continued.
�Are you ready dear?� he asked the woman.
She walked up to us, he took something from her. It was an electric razor, I heard it buzzing as he turned it on. 
�This is going to be fun, there&#8217;s nothing more fun that breaking down the ego, say bye to your hair, there goes another little part of you, that makes you special, now you&#8217;ll look more like the worthless slave you are,� he said bitterly.
The woman grabbed a handful of my hair and cut it off. They she proceeded to cut until it was short enough to shave. He took the pleasure of shaving every little piece of it. I was already humiliated and degraded enough from earlier, I could have cared less at this point, this was all purely for his own enjoyment. 
�Grab the collar and leash please,� he said to the woman.
She walked off and return with his things. He brushed the loose hair of my shoulders and wrapped a thick leather collar around my neck; it had a large ring in the front and locked in the back. He attached the padlock when he felt the collar was tight enough. Now it was a sealed deal; I was a depraved, shaven, collared slave, waiting for his next command. He hooked the leash onto the collar and tugged on it a bit, I felt disgusting, but there was a ting of pleasure at my lower core.
�Can you hand me that vibrator, after that you can leave,� he said to woman.
�You know, I&#8217;m worn out taking care of you, really you should be doing that for me,� he said.
�But we&#8217;re obviously not there yet, you&#8217;re an investment,� he continued.
She handed him what he had requested, walked up the stairs and shut the door on her way out. He wet his hand and rubbed my butthole, stuffing a small vibrating butt plug inside. Then he pulled on my leash and proceeded to lead me around the room.
�What are you feeling right now?� he asked.
I could feel the butt plug comfortably playing against the inside of my anus. It felt so good. I knew it wouldn&#8217;t be long until I would want to orgasm.
�This whore feels good, she enjoys the butt plug, Sir,� I said with a shaking voice.
He stopped in his tracks.
�This whore was not permitted to feel good or enjoy anything. Some things are inevitable, I suppose, but if you feel the need to orgasm, you have to tell me. You are not allowed to cum unless I say so,� he said and started to lead me around the room again.
The tension in the room, his stern, sadistic voice, my ass riding side to side as I crawled, all turned me on, I wanted to cum right then and there. 
�This slut is going to cum, Sir,� I moaned.
He went around to my back end and pulled it out, I thought the orgasm was going to happen involuntarily as he pulled on the butt plug, but it didn&#8217;t, I was disappointed. 
�We&#8217;re going upstairs,� he said.
I followed him up the stairs on my hands and knees. We entered a kitchen as he opened the door leading out of the basement. There was another woman in the kitchen, she was different than the one that had been downstairs; I couldn&#8217;t recognize her shoes.
�Here, she needs to eat, you can send her out when you&#8217;re done,� he said to the woman and handed her my leash.
�You are required to do as this woman requests, as you would be required with me, after she dismisses you, again you will be under my command only,� he said to me and left.
�Go over to that corner and wait, I&#8217;ll bring you something,� she said.
I looked up just enough to see where she was pointed and crawled to the corner of the kitchen as she dropped my leash carelessly.
�If you ask me, I think he spends too much time down in that basement. Don&#8217;t&nbsp; get me wrong, I would never want to be in your shoes, but Elliot is so handsome, I wish he would spend some more time on the vampire girls instead of wasting himself on dog shit like you,� she said bitterly.
There was a pause, as if she was about to follow up on that thought, but she changed her mind.
�Here, you can eat this,� she said and placed a bowl ofcold, from-the-can spaghetti on the floor.
Then she knelt down until she was at eye level and tilted up my chin, I kept my eyes to the ground.
�Look at me,� she ordered.
I gazed up to see everything that I was expecting. This delicate creature, with a gracious voice and cold hands, had a face to fit the profile. She was older than me by a couple of years; her hair was long and black, pinned up in curls at the back of her head. Her eyes were a piercing gray, and she had a precocious smirk on her face. 
She was looking at me the same way I was looking at her; we were examining each other, making rash judgments. Then she pulled me in a bit and kissed me. The first kiss was small and faint, just testing the waters; then, she went in again for a deeper, more expressive kiss. She let go and stared at me again.
�What&#8217;s so special about you?� she asked.
�Honestly, I don&#8217;t see it,� she said and got up. 
She grabbed a few bottles of beer from the fridge and left the kitchen. I gobbled up the spaghetti, I was so hungry. It had little bits of meat in the sauce that made it taste so good.
In a minute, she stormed back into the kitchen and grabbed the leash, yanking on it repeatedly as I tried to chase after her. She led me down a long, narrow hall and into a large opening. 
I saw a few pairs of feet besides Elliot&#8217;s as we entered into a sitting room.
�Here&#8217;s your slut, Elliot,� she hissed in a long, exaggerated manner.
She threw the leash to the ground and stormed out. The men laughed and went back to their delicate murmur.
�Come here slave,� Elliot ordered.
I crawled over to the couch where he was seated.
�Face the doorway,� he said.
I did as he commanded; he propped up his feet and placed them on my back. I sighed heavily; I couldn&#8217;t understand what that woman was so upset about; at least she wasn&#8217;t being used as a footrest.
�Abigail is such a hag, she&#8217;s starting to get on my nerves,� one of the men said.
�That&#8217;s only because she hasn&#8217;t got laid in weeks,� someone else replied.
�What does she really expect? If she wants sex she should go looking for it out on the streets like the rest of us. It&#8217;s really not that much fun to have sex with a vampire, especially a pompous one like her,� the first one argued. 
�She can always have Jay give her a hand,� the second one laughed.
�Where is that little slut anyway? Abigail you dear little bitch of a vampire, can you please fetch Jay for us?� one of them howled.
I could hear Abigail grunting loudly all the way from the kitchen. There was a woman in the living room too, I heard her laugh for the first time. I only assumed it was Valentine because she was the only other female vampire I was aware of in the house.
�You&#8217;re not anything like her, sweets,� one of the men said to the women, she giggled in reply.&nbsp; 
 �So what are we going to do with Jay? Are you really planning on having two slaves around? That seems like a lot of work,� someone said.
�I don&#8217;t know. I was going to eat her a while back but these two idiots decided to keep her around. I&#8217;m indifferent to the situation, it&#8217;s up to you,� he said.
�Well, we could get rid of Jay and use this one instead, she seems pretty spunky,� one of them suggested.
�Hands off, she&#8217;s mine. At least for now, you can have her when I&#8217;m done with her. If it&#8217;s really going to come down to the sex, you should just keep Jay around until I&#8217;m finished with this one,� he said.
�That&#8217;s probably what we&#8217;re going to do, besides it&#8217;ll be kind of fun having the two girls. They can play together.�
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Abigail brought Jay in and threw her to the ground. I glanced up just enough to see a dirty, skinny, beaten girl come crashing to the floor. She was naked, collared and shaved just like me. I thought for a minute that I must have looked just as pathetic as her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m going out,� Abigail said and stormed down the hall.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�On your knees, chin up,� one of the men ordered.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I followed his sneakers as he made his way towards her; she followed his command without hesitation. He unbuckled his belt and pulled out his cock, she started sucking on it without hesitation. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I could hear the vampire couple making out with each other behind me. 
�Rest on your elbows on the floor,� Elliot ordered.
I did as he commanded. I felt the slippery head of a glass beer bottle get stuffed up my ass. I tried not to make a noise as the unfinished drink poured into my ass.
�Can you grab a few more beers? One for the lady and one for me,� he asked. 
One of the men got up and left. He returned momentarily and took up his seat again.
Elliot pulled the empty bottle from my ass and stuffed a new one in; I felt the fizzy liquid collect inside of me. My stomach began to growl and slosh around. He pulled out the newly emptied bottle. 
�Okay, get back to how you were,� he said.
I got up from my elbows, only to feel the weight of the beer shift inside of me. My insides weren&#8217;t dealing well with the enema. I knew I couldn&#8217;t hold it for long, it feel like huge bubbles of gas were pumping in and out of my intestines. I couldn&#8217;t tell him I had to go, but I&#8217;m sure he knew what he was doing, and doing it all on purpose.
The vampire Jay had been giving head to finally came. He blew the load in her mouth and she swallowed it without argument. He pulled up his pants and took a seat. I peeked up at Jay to see her sulk down to the ground again in shame. 
�Anybody else need her? I&#8217;m done,� he said.
�No, I think we&#8217;re about to head out,� someone replied.
Valentine got up from her seat and walked up to Jay. She grabbed her by the hand and pulled her up to her feet, and then she led her out of the room.
�Are you going out tonight?� one of the men asked.
�You&#8217;re all free to go, but I&#8217;ve got some business to take care of before I venture out,� Elliot said.
I could tell that he was obviously talking about me.
�Well, you better go out with us tomorrow,� they urged him on.
�I will, I don&#8217;t have any plans tomorrow,� he replied.
They sat around for another minute. Someone lit up a cigarette. Valentine entered the room.
�Are you all waiting on me?� she asked giddily.
�Of course we are darling,� one replied.
�I think I&#8217;ll stay in tonight,� the female vampire said.
�Oh, come on Valentine, you stay in way too often!� the same one argued.
�How do you think I keep my figure?� she joked.
They passed around a few more laughs and headed towards the door. Valentine left the room and headed in the opposite direction of the men.
 �I bet you need to take a shit,� he laughed.
He took his feet of my back and got up off the couch and the others walked out. Leaning over, he reached in between my leg and started to finger me. I sighed uncontrollably; I was so horny, it was unbelievable. But I could barely keep my butt hole shut, and I felt like any given minute, the beer would just spout out, so I squeezed it shut harder, which only aroused me more. I started quaking at the feel of it, so close to cuming, but then he stopped.
�Do you need to take a shit; or are you just going to hold on to that for the night?� he asked.
�This whore needs to use the bathroom, Sir,� I said softly.
He swatted my ass and made everything worse.
�Use the bathroom? I asked you if you wanted to take a shit, like a dog!� he exclaimed and smacked my ass again.
�This whore needs to take a shit, Sir,� I said even more quietly than before.
He walked around me and knelt in front of me. He leaned in until his face was only inches from mine and pinched my chin in between his fingers.
�Keep your eyes to the ground, slut,� he said and he tilted my chin up towards his face.
I steadied my eyes to the ground, trying to avoid eye contact at any given price. He got so close I could feel his breath on my skin, we were at eye level, but he was still looking down on me. Then, unexpectedly, he kissed me.
His soft, but firm lips pressed against mine. I shut my eyes and took in every second of it, letting the moment sweep me away, forgetting all of the rules and just being with him. His tongue gently pried my lips open and met with mine somewhere in the moment. I wanted to move out of my strict position and caress his face; run my fingers through his hair, graze my nails against the back of his neck, but I didn&#8217;t make a move.
As soon as he stopped, I opened my eyes and shot them to the ground again, pretending that the tender moment never happened, although I was sure that it did.
He stood back up without saying a word and yanked on my leash.
�Let&#8217;s go cunt,� he hissed and dragged me back down the hall.
As I crawled, the beer gargled inside of me, I was afraid I wasn&#8217;t even going to make it. We walked past the kitchen and through a door at the far end of the house that led to a patio outside. It was a warm night, nothing to worry about in my nudity. He had me crawl out into the yard and poop near some trees, within a cluster of ivy growing up them. He just stood on the patio and watched, smoking a cigarette.
When I was in the darkness of the yard, I stole some glances, appreciating his dark, intriguing body, his elegant, conceited posture and his devious eyes. I couldn&#8217;t wait until the day that I could look right into them.
The enema shit was horrible. Once I got past the nervous squatting and the ivy tickling the insides of my legs, I finally let go. At first it was difficult to encourage the shit out, but then it came like a storm, my legs were quaking, I was sweating, my stomach hurt. But there was something to it, maybe it was only because I was so horny, that even my god awful shit turned me on. The pressure from the flow, the heavy pushing from the inside of my ass, all of it nearly brought me to orgasm, the only thing that was holding me back was sheer determination. I&#8217;d have to stop for a second and breathe; letting the nearing orgasm pass before continuing on. I was done with my shit and he was done with his cigarette.
He walked inside the house and came back out with a wade of toilet paper.
�Here, you&#8217;d better clean it up, and toss it out of view when you&#8217;re done,� he said and handed it to me, I finished up.
He led me back inside the house, my hands and feet were a little dirty from the ground outside, but he didn&#8217;t seem to care. We went past the kitchen and down the hall, near the living room. There was a set of stairs around a well hidden corner, we took those up to the second floor; there was a smaller hall with a few doors and an even smaller flight of stairs up the third floor, which only had one bedroom.
We walked inside; the whole room was quite large from what I could make out. There was a big bed in the middle and wide closets and mirrors. Everything was decorated in an elegant style. He led me to the left corner of the room, furthest from the door, near the bathroom. There, he took off the leash and locked a thick chain onto my collar that connected to a large ring on the wall. The chain was long enough for me to reach the nearby bathroom that was only a few steps away. But it wasn&#8217;t long enough to reach the bed, and not nearly close enough to the door. Although there were windows, they were painted over in black. 
In my corner, I had a dog dish, just like the ones I had in the kitchen and the basement. This one simply had water at one end and oyster crackers at the other. I didn&#8217;t even have a blanket to call my own. 
�At ease,� he commanded.
I sat down on the hardwood floor and leaned my weary head against the wall. When would I get a good night&#8217;s rest?&nbsp; Even the foot of his bed seemed more comfortable. There was a bear skin rug sprawled across it. I groaned in my own self pity.
�Hands out in front of you,� he said.
I put my hands out as he walked over to one of his closets, it was a walk-in and he disappeared for a moment, reemerging with something in his hands. I dodged my eyes back to the ground as he neared.
He fitted leathery mittens on my hands that forced them into fists and tightly buckled and locked them at the wrists, just below my actual cuffs. I looked down at the contraptions. 
�These are for your own good. I don&#8217;t want to hurt you if I don&#8217;t have to. I can only imagine how hard this night is going to be for you, and I don&#8217;t want you playing with yourself while I&#8217;m away, and getting in trouble with me later, it&#8217;ll spoil my plans,� he said.
I rolled my wrists around feeling the tight, leathery mittens against my knuckles. 
�The bathroom&#8217;s right over there,� he said and walked out of the room.
 As soon as he was gone I rubbed a leathery mitten against vaginal lips and clit. The leather itself felt so good. I knew it wouldn&#8217;t be enough to get me off, but I rolled my head back and forth against the wall, pumping the mitten up against my clit, just teasing myself more, unable to think clearly about anything else. At my own disposable, without Elliot around, I leisurely spread out on the floor, pressing my nipples against the cold, hardwood floor until they got hard, petting myself with the leather, trying to unclench my fists, trying to remove the restraints with my teeth, running my lips against the chains. I was engrossed in some sort of new fantasy, completely invented by sexual depravation.
The door opened, I sat up quickly and stuffed myself further away into the corner, my heart beating uncontrollably. Valentine and Elliot came in. They were immersed in conversation and didn&#8217;t look my way. I didn&#8217;t want to take it personally, so I kept my eyes to the ground.
�Do you think they&#8217;ve caught on to us?� she asked in a teasing tone.
�We have been staying in a lot lately. Well, what&#8217;s it to them anyway, we&#8217;re our own vampires,� he replied.
I peered up to see them leaning up against a wall near the entrance. She had her back pressed against it and he was nuzzling her neck. She noticed my stare and pushed him away quickly.
�You brought her up here?� she asked, irritated.
�I thought I got my point across last time that I didn&#8217;t want any of those things around while we made love,� she whined.
�Oh, come on it&#8217;s been so long, you&#8217;re no fun!� he grumbled back at her.
�I can&#8217;t stand it, half the time it feels like you only want to fuck me because you have one of them here, why can&#8217;t this just be between you and me?� she said bitterly.
They were slowly making their way towards the bed.
�If I can recall correctly, when we first started fucking, you wanted to be treated like one of them. I can almost guarantee that I&#8217;m sensing some jealousy. If you&#8217;re going to be my play thing, I want you to obey me. If I want someone to watch, you shouldn&#8217;t whine about it,� he said playfully.
 �There&#8217;s only so much I can take. I&#8217;m not like these little whores of yours, I&#8217;m much more domineering, if fact, I should be the one telling you what to do,� she played back.
 �Then dominate me my dear, I&#8217;m all yours,� he urged her.
She laughed and pushed him on the bed. He landed on his back and started laughing too. She peeled off her dress and straddled him. He tore her bra off and flung it on the floor. They started kissing passionately. I was watching the whole thing; unable to stop myself. His hands running down her smooth back, his fingers tips exploring the lace of her underwear. Then she shot up and smacked him across the face. He grabbed her wrist and shook her whole, tiny body by it. Tossing her on her side and jumping on top, they both started laughing. 
She tried to squirm away from him passionately, but he held her down and ground against her with his clothes on. He held her by her throat with one hand and started fingering her with the other as he hovered over her. 
Valentine was moaning loudly, I wasn&#8217;t sure whether she was really all that satisfied or whether she was trying to make me jealous, in any case, I wished I was the one who was there instead of her. Her legs shook as she he controlled her whole body with two fingers. I was amazed. 
Then he grunted, pulled them out and whipped them on his pants.
�You want me to fuck you, don&#8217;t you?� he asked with a rough tone of voice.
�Yes, yes, please fuck me,� she begged.
He got up off the bed. Her body looked so cold and left behind without him. He ran his hands through his hair and turned towards me. I was so enthralled by the story I was watching, I didn&#8217;t look back down in time.
�What are you doing?� he asked me.
I was nervous and sweating grossly as he started pacing towards me. I didn&#8217;t say anything.
�I asked you a question, slave,� he said.
�This slut, uh, bitch, uh, I&#8217;m so sorry Sir,� I whispered.
I couldn&#8217;t get any closer to the wall, he got so close to me his boots were pressing up against the skin of my legs. He stood so tall over me, as I shook in place.
�Were you watching us?� he asked.
I glanced past him for a second to see Valentine sitting on the corner of the bed, glaring back at me.
�This whore was watching, yes, Sir, I&#8217;m so sorry, Sir,� I pleaded.
�Was it worth it? Did it turn you on?� he asked.
�It turned this slave on, Sir,� I replied.
He unbuckled his pants and pulled out his boner. I didn&#8217;t know whether I was supposed to be looking at it or not, but it was within eyeshot and I looked at it anyway. 
�It turned me on too,� he said as he played with himself slightly.
�Keep your eyes to the ground, tilt your head up, open your mouth,� he said.
I did as he ordered.
He leaned in over me and rubbed his dick around my lips, tracing the O they had formed. I opened wider and he pressed it in, pushed my head back with the pressure. 
�Come on, you know what to do,� he said.
I started rocking my head back and forth, letting it go deeper up against my throat. Exploring his cock with my tongue and sucking on it gracefully. He sighed very lightly from the pleasure, it was heavenly. My own cunt and pulsing with pleasure; just knowing that I was doing something right.
He pulled out and ran his wet cock against my face, degrading me.
�Do you like that?� he asked.
�This whore does, Sir,� I said, my mouth watering.
�I want you to watch tonight,� he said and dropped his pants to the ground.
He kicked off his boots and tossed his shirt on the floor. Naked and glistening with eroticized sweat, he walked back to the bed.
�Don&#8217;t you fucking look at me that way, you little fucking slut. Lay back down on that fucking bed or I&#8217;m kicking you out you ungrateful piece of shit,� he growled at Valentine and shoved her back on the sheets.
He pulled her panties off, spread her legs open impatiently and started eating her out. She moaned uncontrollably the whole time, over exaggerating every moment. At some point I stopped caring, I just watching his smooth, pale, rippling body, bobbing in between her legs, imagining they were my own. As she came, I beat the back of my head again the wall, so tired and angry. I didn&#8217;t want to watch anymore, but I couldn&#8217;t stop.
Her soft, womanly cries of ecstasy ringing through the room, buried me in envy. The mittens were not arousing anymore, they were constricting. I pressed my nails into my skin within those mittens, just to feel something real. I shook my head in my hands, groaning, pressing the leather against my skin. My dripping crotch was begging to be touched, just for a moment.&nbsp; His tongue, lips, fingers, cock, anything would do at this point. 
He picked her up and tossed her on the bear skin rug. She didn&#8217;t care about anything anymore, she was his, he controlled her with the pleasure he showed her. She was on her back, the top of her head facing my direction. He was on top, looking right at me. He knew I was watching, he had ordered me to do so, and he smiled devilishly as he grabbed her by the hair and thrust his cock in. Her legs wrapped around his back, he pounded her viscously, sliding the rug around on the ground her ass slid against the floor. She was completely captivated, every thrust taking her deeper into a land of dreams.
But he wasn&#8217;t there with her; he was in that room with me, watching me sweat anxiously. Watching as I ran my helpless, useless hands against my naked body, just trying to get something out of that experience. But only envy and frustration and lust took me over. My head rolling against the wall, chin up in the air, breathing so heavily, wanting to cry out and beg for him to touch me, but I couldn&#8217;t, I wasn&#8217;t allowed to.
Then I would look back at him, as he laughed at me silently with his evil grin, fucking this ragdoll beneath him. 
�Oh god, oh my god, harder, I&#8217;m cuming,� she moaned.
He reached in between her legs with his free hand momentarily and she came instantly. Arching her neck and back, quaking below him, but he wasn&#8217;t done, he hadn&#8217;t finished.
He turned her over and started riding her doggy style. She was so weak her arms were shaking, but he kept up his pace, changing intervals between deep slow thrusts and quick ins and outs. I could see huge beads of sweat running down her breast as they bounced around. At first she was annoyed by the fact that they were both facing me, but then a wicked smile formed on her face as she saw how much agony I was really in. At that point, she put her show back on, getting into the swing of things, letting him please her again, for the sake of making it more difficult for me.
He held her tightly by the hair as it was balled up in his fist, smacking her ass with his other hand repeatedly. He thrust into her so naturally and with a perfect momentum. He licked his fingers and started playing with her asshole as he continued to fuck her, she became weak again, running her face into the rug and using her hands to play with herself, she came again. 
He pulled out, and stood over her shaking body as she gave him head until he came. He spewed his cum on her face and left her there to grab his clothes and leave without a word. I sat breathlessly, unknowing what to say if she talked to me, but she didn&#8217;t, she ran into the bathroom, washed herself off, put her clothes back on and left without even looking at me.
�Fuck!� I screamed.
The room echoed slightly. I beat my fists against my head, I got up and paced around, I even jumped around a little, to feel some sort of freedom and relief. I walked to the bathroom and stared at myself in the mirror. My face was moist and blotchy, my body was looked grimy. A shaved head, a collar with a tight chain locked to it, I couldn&#8217;t believe I was this person. Who would want to fuck me anyway? I took a piss and walked back to my corner. 
There was nothing for me to do but go to sleep; I curled up into a ball up against the corner, dreaming of freedom, dreaming of pain and pleasure.&nbsp; 
 �Wake up, go wash up,� Elliot said.
I woke up to his sharp voice, and the darkened room. It was light outside, I could tell through the streaky black paint that did a bad job of covering up the sun. I got up to my feet with great hesitation and went into the bathroom. My hands were still of no use to me, so I had a hard time turning on the faucet and holding onto a washcloth and running it down my body.
He followed me in after a few minutes. I lowered my glace to the ground as he stood behind me. He picked up the wash cloth I had set down and ran it under the faucet. He ran the cloth down my back, tracing my spin, and in between my legs. I shuddered as he rubbed the cloth repeatedly against my folds. Then he moved down my legs and rinsed off my feet. 
He set down the washcloth and grabbed me by the back of my collar, pulling me into him. He wrapped his other hand around my waist and stuffed my ass against his crotch. He was wearing pants, but I could feel his boner beneath the layers as he ground it against my ass. 
�Turn around, get on your knees,� he ordered.
I did as he said, and watched as he pulled down his pants. 
�Go on, suck me off,� he said.
Pulling out his cock he stuffed it into my mouth without a moment of hesitation. I started bobbing my head and servicing him to my best abilities. He grabbed my head and drove his cock in deeper, until I was choking on it and gasping for air, but he didn&#8217;t care. He started pounding it in repeatedly, using the back of my head to steady his aim. I opened my mouth wider and stopped fighting it. He pulled out his wet cock and flicked it against my cheek. He pulled down his pants and took off the rest of clothing. 
He rummaged through his pant pockets and pulled out a set of keys. He unlocked the chain from my collar.
�Go lay down on my bed,� he said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I got off my knees and raced over to his bed. The sheets were warm and soft as I gently pressed my back up against them. I felt like I was floating on a cloud, I would have stayed there forever; it had felt like so long since I had been in a bed. He walked to the bed and leaned over me, he smelled my skin, ran his hand along the prickly hair on my scalp.
�You want my cock in you, don&#8217;t you slave?� he asked with a slow, eerie voice.
�Yes sir,� I whispered.
�Don&#8217;t you,� he repeated as he started rolling one of my nipples in between his fingers. 
A rush of ecstasy rolled over me.
�Please fuck this slut, Sir,� I moaned.
He stood over me and spread my legs apart. My heart was beating so hard I could feel the pulse throbbing in my ears. He pushed two fingers in slowly, and my stomach sank from the pressure. I could barely breathe. He slid them in and out gently, easily lubricated by my own secretions. Using his thumb to play with my clit, he continued his exploration of my insides. He found my g-spot and a tickled it with his fingers, I could feel my cheeks burning.
�Please sir, please fuck this whore, please,� I whined.
He started thrusting his fingers deeper in, moving methodically for greater arousal. I started tossing around in the bed, groaning at the tease. He knew it wasn&#8217;t enough to get me there, he was just teasing me. He pulled out his fingers and whipped them off on my lips. He was standing over me, my knees were up, legs spread far apart, ass on the edge of the bed. I watched as he jerked on his cock and got himself hard.
�You&#8217;re not allowed to cum, slut,� he ordered.
�If you think you&#8217;re going to cum, you have to tell me, and only I will be able to decide if you have that privilege,� he said.
With one hard thrust he sank his hard cock in. I felt my breath get pushed out of lungs. I couldn&#8217;t believe this was really happening. The room was spinning around me; his dark, hard body rocking against me. His cock pressed up against my insides. He sped up his tempo, thrusting harder, reaching deeper with every reinsertion. I begged for more without a word, rocking my body to sync in with his. He grabbed my hips and ramped harder. I moaned with pleasure. 
My walls were swelling up around his cock; I could feel my heart pounding down there. He lifted up my legs over his shoulders to apply some better pressure. I felt him slip a wet finger in my ass and wiggle it up until a new layer of pleasure swept into me. A tight, nauseous, euphoric feeling came over me, my chest was caving in; I forgot I needed to breath.
�I, your, I uh, your slave is going to cum, Sir, Sir, please!� I could barely make out.
He pulled out immediately and grabbed my cheeks with his hand.
�Don&#8217;t you fucking dare,� he hissed.
He played with his own cock as I sighed and waited for the wasted orgasm to pass.&nbsp; He walked back to the bathroom and grabbed his keys, came back and unlocked the mittens. He threw them on the bedside table as I stretched out my fingers.
He opened a tiny drawer to the table and pulled out a small vibrator. 
�Take this, get on the floor. I want to see you on your hands and knees, playing with yourself,� he said.
I took the vibrator from him and climbed off the bed.
�Not on the rug,� he snapped.
I got down on all fours on the empty floor between his bed and the bathroom. He stood in the same place, watching me from a distance. I turned on the vibrator and started rubbing it against my clit, while my other limbs stayed in the doggy position. My head dropped, as I instantly felt the overwhelming pleasure again. It buzzed through me irrefutably. My knees and wrists were shaking; I pressed harder, unsure why I wanted to reach orgasm so fast, knowing that I wouldn&#8217;t be able to experience it.
I was distracted by his quiet footsteps as they slid against the floor, made their way across the room and came back to stand over my shaking body. I was so close.
There was a hard slap against my ass. It felt like a belt. I groaned irritatingly, but continued to masturbate, unable to stop myself. He smacked me harder against the ass with the strip of leather. I winced and tried to move out of the way for the next round but it nicked me again. For every round of incredible orgasmic build up, there was a swat against my ass to ruin my mood. I&#8217;d lose my train of thought or fantasy every time he smacked me, but it would only take seconds to regain the final stretch to an orgasm. 
He wacked me again, but this time, I felt nothing at all, a numbness fell over me, I was burning down the center, sweat collecting at the back of my knees. I couldn&#8217;t support my weight with the one free hand that was holding up my quaking body. I let my chest hit the ground, my breasts press against the cold floor. I kept my ass up in the air, afraid to disobey him any further, but I couldn&#8217;t draw that vibrator away from my clit.
�She needs to cum, Sir,� I sighed, in a dreamlike, almost indifferent temperament.
�No,� he snapped.
I dropped the vibrator to the ground in agony and waited in misery as the orgasm passed. I could barely hear the vibrator rattling against the hardwood floor, as I lay with my cheek pressed firmly against the ground. This was the worst torture of all. He grabbed the vibrator off the ground and wrapped my fingers around it. 
�Again, all fours,� he said.
I lifted myself up and started over. He came around and faced me.
�Open your mouth,� he said.
I did as he ordered and he slipped his limp dick in, allowing it to harden as I sucked him off, while playing with myself. He snapped his belt with his hands and wacked me again with it. I wasn&#8217;t sure what to pay attention to. The inevitable orgasm which was already on the cusp, his cock pounding the back of my throat or to the hard lashings he was still managing to make against my back. I groaned from the strikes against my back, as it was already becoming sore, but his cock muffled my cry. He used his free hand to push up against the back of my hand and force his cock deeper inside. 
To my surprise the pending orgasm almost gave way. I released the vibrator instantly, unable to speak. He noticed. Stopped spanking me and let my arm rest for a minute and then his continued to face fuck me. 
�Good girl,� he laughed lightly at my misery.
�Again,� he commanded.
And again, I pressed the vibrator against my clit. My shoulders were sore; I could feel a pitch in the small of my back. His lashing felt cruel against my wet skin. My clit was so swollen and tender, even the slightest touch awakened it. He started walking backwards. I had to choice but to following him carefully as I played with myself and he played with me. I followed his dick around the room, it would move away too quickly and I&#8217;d have to chase after it and swallow it up as he spanked me. I had to pull away the vibrator constantly; I couldn&#8217;t go on a minute without feeling like an orgasm was just going to happen involuntarily.
We stopped suddenly, and he pulled his cock out of my mouth, he jerked it slowly and swatted it again my face lightly. He traced my moist lips with it and finally said, �I think you&#8217;ve had enough.�
Again my stomach sank, but for all the wrong reasons. I thought nervously about the mittens and the chain against the wall and how much more miserable everything would be now.
He grabbed me by the collar up to a kneeling position. My poor knees were about to give up on me. 
�Play with yourself slave,� he said
I halfheartedly pressed the vibrator against my clip as he slid his cock in my mouth. But he didn&#8217;t thrust it in this time; he just gently slid it in and out. He tossed the belt aside and ran his hand through the bristle on my head. The orgasm was no mystery now, I shut my eyes wearily as it approached, waiting to see how long it would take before I had to stop myself. I was too close for comfort, but I as waved the vibrator away from my clit he said, �You can cum, slut.�
I couldn&#8217;t believe it, I looked up at him.
�On one condition, you have to look right at me the whole time,� he said sternly.
I had my head tilted towards him with his engorged cock filling up my mouth and I came.
A warmth swept over me, then something like an invisible punch to the pit of my stomach. My knees gave way, but he held me up by my collar, pressing his cock deep down my throat. I wanted to shut my eyes and disappear. The pleasure was consuming me; I had never had such an amazing orgasm in my life. Everything was shaking around me, my ears were ringing; and then, I could only hear a fuzzy muffle as if someone stuffed cotton in my ears. I kept looking at him, into his dark, domineering eyes, as he pressed his cock deeper in, holding me by the collar. He owned me.
The orgasm faded it and out, I couldn&#8217;t move that vibrator away, there was a constant humming at the point of my clit and in between my folds, running up to my stomach. And it would overlap, as if never ending, so warm and constant, yet leaping with powerful jolts of new, tight energy through my body. He released me and I fell backwards, unable to feel anything but the pleasure.
�Look at me,� I could barely hear him say.
He grabbed me by the backs of my knees and started pounding me. He dark eyes only inches from my face and his wet skin pressing up against mine. Every thrust felt so powerful, so slow and timeless. My orgasmic feeling had not faded; it was only spurred on further with every new blow from his hard, rigid cock. I&#8217;m not sure how long we went on this way, I was lost in his eyes.
He turned me over in one smooth move and started fucking me from behind. I pressed my face against the ground and I rammed the vibrator against my clit. The cold floor felt good against my skin, I smothered my face in it. Layers of pleasure swam in and out of me. He stuck a few fingers in my ass and it only felt that much better. A sharp new, massive orgasm ran through me. I had pins and needles rushing through me.&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t understand how to breathe.
�You&#8217;re mine, you stupid bitch, you&#8217;re all mine,� he hissed.
I moaned so loudly from the orgasm, I didn&#8217;t know how to stop; it only encouraged him to fuck me harder. He pulled his fingers from my ass and grabbed the collar, yanking on it until he had my head high in the air, as if he were using it as reins. He pulled me up to my knees and grabbed me by the hips. We were both on our knees now; I was still slightly bent over, with my back arched so that he could be a good angle.
He ran his lips up against my neck, his chest pressed up against my back, my breasts jutting up, bouncing freely as he fucked me rhythmically. I knew what was going to happen next.
�Tell me I own you, slave,� he whispered.
�You own this slave, Sir,� I managed to say in between my heavy breathing.
�And your only sole purpose of existence is to please me,� he continued and thrust in harder to remind me.
I wanted to climb out my skin and melt away, his cock felt so good, and his breath against my skin, his words of degradation melted me.
�Yes sir, this cunt only lives to serve you,� I replied weakly.
�Don&#8217;t you ever forget that,� he warned.
�I can make this heaven or hell, your body belongs to me,� he said.
With this, he bit into my neck, his sharp teeth digging deep into my soft skin. I felt his cock jerking restlessly inside of me, he sighed with some dignity and pleasure as he came. Blood ran down from his lips and my neck. He cradled me in his arms as he lapped the blood off my neck, attempting a few more thrusts, and then he pulled out.
Without him there, I dropped to the ground, unable to move. He had set me into the limp, comatose state of euphoria that had run through me the first night we met. I knew that his must have been the same for every victim; unable to feel the pain or struggle, just content. The vibrator had fallen from my hand, cracking open from the sudden drop, and the battery fell out and rolled slowly on the wooden floor. My eyelids were starting to feel heavy, I watched him for as long as I could, collecting his clothes and keys, dressing up and then his came back to look over me.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You&#8217;re really quite pathetic, you know that?� he scuffed.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I wasn&#8217;t expecting you to be that much of a slut. You could have at least pretended you weren&#8217;t enjoying it and kept some of your dignity. Now crawl back to your corner where you belong, someone will come to collect you later,� he said.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I managed to make it over there and he fastened my collar to the chain on the wall. I passed out before he had even left the room.
