&nbsp;

PART ONE:

�Songs
of Love and Hate�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The Chameleon
watched dispassionately.

The gang rape
was being carried out to piped organ music with the same meticulous precision
as the military manoeuvres of the previous 72 hours. A tang of incense pervaded
the white walled room alongside the woman�s pitiful wailing and the relentless
male grunts.

&nbsp;

It had all
been worked out in advance. The woman should - at this exact moment -
have been basking in happiness as �The Mother of the Bride�, proudly watching
her elder daughter walking up the aisle. Instead, she was now being held down,
mounted and fucked by a succession of masked and uniformed men, each enjoying
his allocated five minutes.

&nbsp;

Cold hearted ? Sure, ladies and gentlemen. After all, this is a
Song of Love and Hate. And especially Hate.

So where do
I begin ? When do I begin ?
In one sense it all began so many years ago. Decades, in
fact. Plenty of time to chill a splendid buffet that is best served
cold.

&nbsp;

But in another
sense it really all went off just three days ago. The stretch limousine
carrying the bridal party to the wedding rehearsal left the gates of the
massive Cumber estate at 14.40 hrs precisely on its way to the church. As
usual, the chauffeur was armed, and the Merc escort
behind carried a pair of uniformed heavies. All was going to schedule.

&nbsp;

But the
chauffeur and escort proved no match for the crack team of mercenaries that
carried out the raid. The bride, her mother, the groom, and the bride�s younger
brother and sister were �extracted� and kidnapped in less than sixty seconds,
with a minimum of fuss and bloodshed. Only the father of the bride was missing
from the party.

&nbsp;

And, of
course, that was the Chameleon�s intention.

&nbsp;

After that it
was a question of making enough changes to cover their tracks. The five
unconscious victims were transported over 7,000 miles in total. They were
shuttled back and forth in various directions, for different durations, in a
miscellany of SUVs and trucks, then helicopters, two
private jets, via motor launch and powerboats, eventually overland in ancient
lorries, and lastly through mountain passes strapped over the backs of a train
of camels. Each time, the method of transport was �cleansed� afterwards, and -
in the case of the motor vehicles and powerboats - completely destroyed by
fire. So, by the time the long, zigzag journey was finished, they were on a
different continent, in a strange and exotic country, in an untraceable
location. Even with satellite surveillance, finding a needle in a haystack
would have been a thousand times easier than tracing either the victims or
their kidnappers.

&nbsp;

The Chameleon
smiled thinly and lit a cigarette, amused by the woman�s begging. The
geographical trip had taken almost three days, but her journey from arrogant
�45 year old billionaire bitch� to pleading, sobbing cunt had been short
indeed. It was the way she obviously thought she had something to bargain with
that caused the smile. As if, having failed to order them about like her
servants, she could negotiate her way out instead. Maybe she thought they took
credit cards ? Or she could send round her chauffeur
with a wad of cash later ? But now, Leatherback was
already the seventh man to demonstrate to her that everything she had to offer
them could be ripped from her for nothing. Leatherback�s muscled buttocks
hammered up and down in fierce, deep, impatient strokes.

&nbsp;

The familiar
organ music being played over the sound system on continuous loop started up
again. The �Bridal Chorus� from Wagner�s Opera Lohengrin
is the standard march played at the entrance of the bride at most weddings
in America and the Western World. Now it was being used as a melodic
accompaniment to Susan Cumber�s terrible ordeal. Here
comes the bride�s mother, perhaps ? On
second thoughts, probably not.

&nbsp;

Susan Cumber
was undoubtedly a gorgeous woman. One of those Prom Queens who had been born
beautiful, married young and the years had been kind to her since. She had
popped out three kids in quick succession, got her figure back, exercised, ate
well, barely drank and lived right. She hadn�t even had to resort to surgery
yet. No nips, tucks or even botox. Her 45 year old
skin was smooth, her butt was firm, and her boobs were natural Ds that still
looked sensational even without a bra. Of course, money helped. Cooks, diet
counsellors, a full time personal trainer, a tennis coach, two masseuses, daily
hairdresser, and the best doctors, gynaecologists, dentists, orthodontists,
�what-have-yous�, all at her beck and call.

&nbsp;

It was hard to
envisage the groaning, sobbing, writhing woman as the same immaculately poised
corporate wife and mother-of-three, whose photograph so often adorned the
business press and the society magazines. She was a green eyed, platinum
blonde, with perfect cheekbones and teeth that dazzled. A
rare blend of Hollywood glamour and Manhattan sophistication. At 5� 9�
tall, she was the ideal height to complement her handsome 6� 3� husband,
whether posing formally for press shots or attending charity balls. Her figure
was just a little fuller than those of her two daughters but absolutely in
proportion to her larger breasts and extra inches in height.

&nbsp;

The Chameleon
stubbed out the cigarette. Leatherback had shot his bolt and was being replaced
by Viper. There was no rush. As that old song goes, they had all the time in
the world.

&nbsp;

***
*** ***

&nbsp;

At least one
continent, seven time zones, and several thousand miles away, John Cumber paced
a room that was packed full with the best. From the President down, everybody
had promised anything and dropped everything to help. It was a Saturday and
they were all there; CIA, FBI, Military brass, others from agencies he hadn�t
even known existed, plus his closest hired hands and colleagues. The Cumber
Corporation was a multi billion dollar machine and all of its resources had
been utilised or placed on standby to assist.

&nbsp;

The problem
was there had been no progress in three days. Sure, there were teams of agents
combing the kidnap site, officers interviewing anybody and everybody,
researching, collecting data, trawling every damned domestic and international
contact for clues. Any clue. But the result so far was
a big fat zero.

&nbsp;

He glanced
down at his gold Patek Philippe. At this very moment
he should have been walking Lorna up the aisle, in front of five hundred
guests, then standing proudly alongside Susan throughout the service, with
Rachel and Ryan either side of them. He crushed the empty plastic water cup
that was in his hand, swearing for the thousandth time that he would find his
family and save them.

&nbsp;

And get the
people responsible.

&nbsp;

***
*** ***

&nbsp;

The Chameleon
sat at a bank of screens and surveyed their �guests�.

Each had a
cell to themselves. The cells were not, of course, the five star accommodation they were used to. They were below ground,
humid and damp, with trickles of liquid running down the walls. They stank of
raw sewage. Rats and insects scurried in and out of the cells and corridors.

&nbsp;

Above ground,
the house and garden had long since been converted into a comfortable but
inconspicuous home. The thick compound walls that ensured their privacy had
been built of mud, baked hard by many years of hot desert sun. Decades before,
this site had housed a fort and prison used by the infamous French Foreign
Legion to incarcerate its prisoners, miscreants and deserters.

&nbsp;

Although the
bank of screens suggested the five underground cells they had selected were neighbouring, they had in fact a choice of over fifty, and
had chosen ones spaced well apart. It was important that their captives be
unable to communicate with or hear each other, at least during the early stages
of their ordeal.

&nbsp;

The cell walls
and floors were made of stone and dried mud except for the front and ceiling
that were made of columns of steel bars, just like those in cowboy movies, the
Chameleon thought. Each one measured only six feet by six feet square and they
were totally devoid of any furniture at all; no bed, chair, even
sanitary facilities. The only �decoration� were five
iron manacles set in the shape of a star into the rock hard rear walls. Their
positioning alone would have made it obvious they were intended for a captive�s
neck, wrists and ankles to be held in a stretched spread eagle position.

&nbsp;

However, what
made that fact even more evident was that each of the �guests� had already been
fastened into the manacles. Microphones and night-vision CCTV cameras in each
cell gave the Chameleon perfect sound and vision, even in the murky light.

&nbsp;

In the middle
cell, Susan Cumber hung on her tiptoes. She was naked with a glistening stream
of wetness oozing down her inner flanks. Her breasts, hips and abdomen were
marked with red blotches and a couple of darker bruises. Her head hung down
dejectedly, face obscured, her shoulder length blonde tresses mussed and
dangling.� The Chameleon shrugged. It was
to be expected. After a lifetime of fidelity to one man, you couldn�t expect a
woman to be thrilled about going from men numbers two to twelve all within an
hour. She deserved a little rest.

&nbsp;

Shown on the
screens either side, were her two daughters. In one, Lorna Cumber - who should
now by rights be Lorna Collins of course - was fastened in a similar
uncomfortable starfish pose. She was dressed in the same outfit she had been
kidnapped in, although it glowed dirty and slightly torn in the green
night-vision CCTV light. It was a wedding dress. Not the real dress. Oh
no, it would have been bad luck to be seen in that before the happy day itself ! But the billionaire Cumbers had typically splashed
out on a choice of three bespoke, couture dresses for their darling, spoiled 23
year old older daughter and she had decided to wear her second choice for her
wedding rehearsal. Lorna was beautiful, but she took after her father rather
than her mother. She was a doe-eyed brunette, with long eyelashes, coltish legs
and a slightly olive complexion. She had lost her wedding pumps on her journey
and was now staring at the floor of her cell, shrieking and blubbering whenever
a rat or spider came close to her bare, arched feet.

&nbsp;

In the other
monitor, Rachel Cumber was wearing an expensive �sister of the bride� outfit, a
beautifully cut suit made especially for her by one of America�s trendiest
designers. Unlike Lorna, Rachel was not so much classically �beautiful�, as
just downright fuckable. Even though she was two
years younger than her sister, there was a provocative sensuality about her
that belied her 22 yrs. At only 5� 2� she was several inches shorter than her
mother and sibling but she was perfectly formed. Facially, she took after her
mother, with long blonde hair and the same perfect cheekbones and expensive
flawless smile. Her pretty, turned-up button nose was of the �my shit doesn�t
smell� variety. But whereas her mom�s eyes were green, Rachel�s were a
startling blue. The Chameleon chuckled and decided that, in the probably
unlikely event Hollywood came calling to make a blockbuster of this thriller,
the role of Rachel Cumber would be best performed by Paris Hilton. Sure, it was
unfortunate that Rachel�s cleavage was smaller than her mom and sis - a perky B
cup at best - but her model-thin legs and waspish waist made the whole package
appear just as generously endowed. The bitch was staring out straight at a
camera, mouthing obscenities in apparent defiance.

&nbsp;

The other two
cells were occupied by Ryan Cumber, �middle child and only son� of John and
Susan, and finally Gene Collins, �groom-to-have-been� of Lorna Cumber. The
Chameleon perused them briefly, spending much less time studying the men than
the women. Ryan was a younger version of his father; similar six-foot-plus
physique, the same handsome features, jutting jaw, close cropped brown hair and
intense brown eyes. Gene was the obvious odd one out in the group. And not just
because of his gingertop. The Cumbers were all hewn
from beautiful stock and it was evidently something other than Gene�s looks
that appealed to Lorna. He had a bookish air, with red hair, pale skin and
insipid, watery-blue eyes. At 5� 7� he was only the same height as his fianc�.
Mind you, the Chameleon knew that when he stood on top of his wallet, Gene
Collins was a lot taller than five seven. Strange how these rich folks
gravitated towards each other. Mergers, not marriages.

&nbsp;

The Chameleon
pushed the chair back from the monitors and lit another cigarette. It was now
over three days since any of their captives had eaten or drunk anything but
water. Soon the fun could begin.

&nbsp;

***
*** ***

&nbsp;

The Eyes
watched the Cumber Building from the coffee shop across the Street. The police
had cordoned off a large area to one side of the main tower to contain the mass
of media vehicles and rif-raff that gathered to rubberneck an event like this. It�s not every day that the
wife of a BBD gets kidnapped, let alone with her three kids and a fianc�. BBD �
acronym for a �billionaire business dude� ! But what
made it funnier to the owner of the eyes was that all these people - the police
and agents in the building and around the country, the media hacks and
paparazzi snoops outside, the watching and listening audiences around the world
- none of them knew jack-shit !

His eyes
squinted up to a window at the very top of the tower. He framed it within a
circle made by his thumb and index finger. He watched a while through the
imaginary scope, aiming carefully at the glass. Slowly he closed the palm of
his hand, eradicating the ugly Cumber Building from his sight.

Only one
fucking person in the whole US of A knew anything !

The Chameleon.

Him.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The Chameleon
entered the cell at dawn. The temperature outside was already climbing fast
after the chill of another cloudless, starlit night. However, underground,
neither the dank air nor dingy light changed much throughout the 24 hour cycle.

Susan Cumber
was barely conscious. The Chameleon wrenched her head up by her platinum
tresses and the stench of sewage in the cell seemed to act like smelling salts,
waking her. She opened her glazed, bloodshot eyes and her nostrils flared.

The Chameleon
surveyed her through the mask�s eyeholes as the woman�s face crumpled in shock
and fear.

�Time to wake up.� The Chameleon
chirped cheerily, like a mom waking a drowsy teenager.

An amazed
expression came across Susan�s features, her forehead creasing into a frown.

�Y � you�re �
a woman ?�

�Yes.� She
said curtly. �Good observation.�

�But � how c �
could you do this to � another woman ?�

The Chameleon
laughed aloud through the mouth flap of her mask.

What a
funny question.

�Are you hungry ?�

�Answer me !� Susan Cumber shrieked in anger. �How could you ?�

The Chameleon
slapped her leather-gloved hand across the woman�s face twice, first one way, then a backhander. The blow snapped Susan�s head sideways,
making her gasp and sob, before ducking her face forward in the neck iron to
try to avoid another blow.

�If you speak
to me like that again,� she spat, �I assure you that, not only will you regret
it, but your daughters will as well.�

�My daughters !� Susan�s face furrowed as she looked up. �Lorna.
Rachel. And Ryan. What have you done with them all ?�

�Oooh, they�re not far away.�

�Please � tell
meeee �� the woman begged.

�Later. Now, I
asked if you are hungry.�

Susan paused,
her brow puckered in confusion. Her head slumped again.

�Yes.� She
whimpered quietly.

�And thirsty ?�

�Yes.� A whisper.

�Okay.�

&nbsp;

The Chameleon
watched from outside the cell as Susan Cumber knelt on all fours and ate the
swill from a steel bowl on the floor. The main ingredients of the mush were
breakfast oats and tinned milk. However, the mix had been laced with a strong
laxative. The meal wouldn�t stay in her for long. She would soon be hungrier
than ever.

After the
woman had finished eating, two masked mercenaries returned to manacle her back
into the stretched, standing position in her cell,
only this time she was allowed to rest her heels fully on the floor.

�Better ?�

Susan moved
her head up and down ungratefully.

She smiled
behind her mask and placed her gloved hand on Susan�s bare hip.

Susan winced,
helpless to shy away more than a couple of inches.

She slowly
traced her hand up Susan�s side and over to her superb, bruised breasts,
hefting them as if they were damaged fruit on sale. She slid her hand back down
over Susan�s taut abdomen to between her damp thighs.

�I�m going to
give you an hour or so of thinking time.� She said. �When I come back, I want
you to give me an answer to this question. Okay ?�

Susan stared
back into her mask with a sullen look of unrestrained hostility.

�What is the question ?�

�It�s simple
really. My poor men are all alone here with us. Without their
girlfriends and partners. To stop their trigger fingers getting itchy,
they will need their sexual needs � er � catered to. Regularly. And I assure you that I am not going to
put out for them. So, two things can happen. Either you volunteer to put in
some pretty intensive stints on your own meeting their needs. Or your daughters
can assist you.�

She held up a
pair of headphones, poised over Susan�s ears.

�It�s up to
you. Mull it over for a while.�

She snapped
the headphones into place and walked briskly out of the cell before Susan had a
chance to reply. The choice of music was apt; Leonard Cohen. His
�Songs of Love and Hate� album.

&nbsp;

Next on their
�visiting round� would be the young wannabe bride, Lorna Cumber. Today should
have been the first morning of the young lady�s honeymoon, whisked by private
plane from the swanky reception to an exclusive suite in the Caribbean, to
start fucking and sucking her darling carrot head husband for a whole three
weeks.

But instead,
today was her first morning in a rather less comfortable suite. Mind you, she
would still get to do loads of fucking and sucking.

The Chameleon
let out a little giggle of excitement.

BEST ENJOYED COLD

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

PART TWO:

�Two
out of three ain�t bad�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

It was still
the middle of the night in America, when the envelope was delivered to the
night guards at John Cumber�s gatehouse. They even
signed for it. To be fair to them, there had been so many comings and goings
those past few days, they shouldn�t have been heavily blamed for not getting a
better identity fix on yet another delivery guy; �medium height�,
�moustache�, �well built�, �white�, �maybe thirties�. Well, that
description could maybe narrow the list down to five million or so !

&nbsp;

It was Sunday,
05.30 hrs, and a sleepless John Cumber was drinking coffee brought to him by a
maid and flicking through newspapers and mail aimlessly, when he came across
the envelope. It appeared innocuous enough, a thin brown packet of the type
used by companies worldwide. �JOHN CUMBER, PRIVATE� was all that was
handwritten on it, in big, black upper case letters.

&nbsp;

It was when he
opened it that his heart stopped. There was a single 10 x 8 inches glossy
photograph. It was a photo of Sarah�s face. She had been crying and looked
terrified. He flipped over to the other side.

&nbsp;

�Dear Mr. Cumber,

Welcome to hell. If
you want to see your bitch and brats again, then follow my instructions very
closely. If you disobey me, even once, you will never see them again. Never. Full stop. No negotiation. Clear ? You will be able to accuse me of many things in the
coming weeks, but being unclear is not one of them. Now, I own a lot of Cumber
Corporation stock. The first rule is that I do not want the share price to
fall, whatever happens. On Friday they closed at 15 dollars 5 cents. If the
price closes at below 15 dollars at any time during our future �discussions�,
you will lose one family member for each day it happens. The fourth time it
happens, game over.� So I suggest you use
that personal fortune of yours if ever the share price needs propping up. Buy,
buy buy !
as the saying goes. That is all for now. Sarah sends
her love. We�ll be in touch again soon.�

&nbsp;

John read
through the letter so many times he lost count. At least,
fifty. He weighed each consonant, every word, each nuance, every phrase;
�the coming weeks�, �the first rule�, �Sarah sends her love�. The bitter coffee
reacted with the ulcerous bile in his gut as he clenched and unclenched his
fists. If he could have traded every cent of his fortune there and then to have
the person who had sent this letter in the room with him, he would have shaken
on the deal in a second.

He kept the
letter private for an hour. It somehow made him feel closer to his family, now
that he at least knew something. But, at 06.45 hrs, his sweaty palm picked up
the phone and dialled Walt Furness.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

Lorna awoke
and screamed at the dreadful apparition.

Somebody had
walked into her cell. The person was wearing a facemask. It was a dreadful
green rubber hood in the shape of a lizard�s head, with eyeholes, nostrils and
a mouth slit with a flap.

She swallowed
her screams and begged. �Please � nooooo ��

Everything
ached. Her calves above all, but her feet, ankles, thighs, back, neck and arms
all throbbed with agonising pain from standing up all night.

�Please,� she
repeated, �whoever you are ��

�Shut up,
bitch.�

It was a man�s
voice. No distinguishable accent or tone. It might have been American,
Canadian, British, Australian, even a fluent English speaker from another
country. The sound was somehow expressionless, hollow and � ruthlessly
professional.

His hands
reached out and seized the cleavage of her wedding dress. With barely a pause,
he tore the silk and lace creation off her shoulders and down the middle from
her chest to her waist, and rent it asunder.

She screamed
again. In shock, fear, sick to her stomach. Lorna was awake enough and clear
headed enough to know she was going to be raped. Guys didn�t shred dresses if
they took no for an answer. She wasn�t a virgin. Not quite. She would rather
have sex than die. But she couldn�t just accept it.

His hands
pulled and ripped every last piece from her until she stood in just her
matching white panties and bra. She couldn�t fight him. So she tried words.

�Look, Mister,
it doesn�t have to be this way � I ��

She winced as
her bra was brutally pulled away from her breasts until it eventually tore the
clasp at the back, the spaghetti hoops over her shoulders ripped and the whole
thing fell away, leaving her topless.

Before she
could compute that, he did the same thing to her lace trimmed pants, ripping so
that the delicate material exploded in his grip.

She stood
naked.

Finally, he
paused, stepping back to admire her body. She could see his eye pupils moving
in the eyeholes appraising her.

And then he
started to unbuckle his belt.

�Please �� she
attempted one last time, �� look, at least let me off this wall.�

He hunkered
down in front of her, so that his erection was the correct height. She was dry
but that didn�t seem to concern him in the slightest. He spat through the mouth
flap onto his fingers and roughly manipulated her arid labia apart, then simply
forced his penis up into her. She was helpless, unable to move more than an
inch or two in any direction. She had no choice but to stand there and take it,
up against the wall.

About ten
years before, at high school, Lorna�s class had attended a lecture that covered
rape. It flooded back to her now, the sunshine streaming through the classroom
windows, her friends� morbidly fascinated teenage faces, the plain woman who
had come to give them the lecture, and her sexy male assistant who gave hints
on self defence and acted out the male role.

But this
was something quite different.

She turned her
face to the side, away from his rubber mask and tobacco breath, her wracking
sobs and his manic thrusts making it difficult for her to breathe.

At last, she
felt a small amount of lubrication as her body produced some moisture in self
defence. She didn�t know whether to feel relief because it made the rape hurt
less, or shame because her body had responded in some way. He was bigger than
Gene, the only penis she had known up to then. He was discernibly thicker and longer
and devoid of any care or finesse.

And then it
was over. He groaned and humped without much apparent enjoyment and she felt
him twitching in orgasm and then the warm wetness of his invasion of her
insides.

He pulled out
and stepped back and out of the corner of her eye she saw a big teardrop of
semen still dangling from the tip of his penis.

�You bastard.� She
muttered, defeat turning to anger.

He laughed
coldly behind the horrendous lizard mask.

�Get used to
it, cum dump. Trust me, there�s plenty more where that came from.�

And those
words were worse than the rape itself.

The sudden realisation of the inevitable. She had no idea where she was, where her mum, Gene, Rachel or Ryan
were, or even what really had happened; whether there was just one man, or many
of them.

But what she
did know was that she was now �in play�; game on.

�Please �� she
turned her head to face him, �� who are you ? At least
tell me that.�

�Sure.� He
paused while he nonchalantly tucked his penis back into his pants and zipped
himself up.

�I�m the
Chameleon.�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

It was Sunday
lunchtime when the first journalist called him.

�John ?�

The guy was
one of his close contacts, a top financial reporter to whom he had given his
cell number, somebody he could trust.

�Hi, Dan.� He replied.

�John. I hate
to do this to you. I know what you must be going through. But there�s a rumour
sweeping the chat rooms and streets that you�re going to announce your
resignation first thing tomorrow morning because of what�s happened ��

�Let me stop you
there, Dan. That�s bull. I wouldn�t let any fuckwits
beat me. Sure I�m taking time out, but resign ? Hey, no way.�

�Well that�s
what I thought, John. But this rumour�s got some momentum. I�m also hearing
that some funds are going to lighten their holdings tomorrow. There are a few
big sell orders of Cumber stock being placed in Asia for opening tomorrow.�

John exhaled,
controlling his breathing, gripping the phone tight.

�Dan, you gotta do something for me. The whole
thing�s baloney. I can�t explain now but I think this must be some kind
of scam linked to the kidnapping of my family. You call back your contacts and
your fund manager friends and tell them that, not only do I deny it, but I will
never again deal with anybody who unloads Cumber stock at this time.�

�Whoa, my friend. Cool it. I�m sure
it won�t be that bad. I�m just warning you something�s out there. I�ll make
some calls but I can�t promise anything.�

�Okay �
thanks, Dan. Keep in touch.�

He hit the red
button with his thumb and stared out of the window.

Now things
were starting to make some sense.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

She lifted the
headphones from Susan Cumber�s ears.

�Depressing
stuff isn�t it ?�

The patrician
eyes looked back at her. They were smoky, dull, no
longer so defiant. Not beaten yet, but certainly on the canvas.

She placed her
gloved finger under Susan�s chin.

�Chin up, Sue.
Things can get worse, you know. Now, have you thought about my little question ? Got an answer for me yet ?�

Susan�s green
eyes watered into tears.

�I�ll do it. Whatever you want.� A pause. �Just
don�t touch my children.�

She smiled
behind the mask.

�Sure. That�s
a deal.� She replied in her most reassuring tone. �But I want to be certain
that you�re totally clear about your side of it. You will be able to
accuse me of many things, Sue darling, but being unclear is not one of them. Okay ?�

Susan nodded,
snivelling.

�It ain�t just a bit of fucking, Sue. It�s the works.
You�ve got to do everything my boys want. No saying no. Whenever and whatever
they want.�

The gorgeous
creamy skin scrunched in a scowl of confusion. Funny how
quick the lines are to appear once you inject a bit of stress into a life.

�Wh � what do you m � mean ?�

�I mean if you
say no to anybody, even once, our deal is off and Lorna and Rachel pay the
penalty.�

�� okay � just
don�t � involve them.�

�And another
thing, Sue, you�ve got to be real enthusiastic. Some guys like it when you just
lie there, but most of my boys like to see some gusto. You got that too ?�

Susan Cumber
shut her eyes and her face froze over, blank.

�Yes � I
understand.�

�That�s
settled then.�

Susan�s eyes
blinked open.

�Now I get my
say.�

Stupid bitch. Always trying to negotiate.

�What ?�

�I want to see
my children. I need to know they�re safe.�

�You can. But
not yet.�

�Why not ?�

�Because I fucking say so.�

Susan paused,
evidently gauging how far to push it.

�When ?�

�A few days � if you keep up your side of the deal.�

The green eyes
studied her. The mask helped. Not just for scaring the shit out of them all
and hiding her identity a while. But it helped if she needed to lie as well.

�Okay. And
there�s one more thing.� Susan said. �I � need to use the bathroom.�

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

�John.�

The agent in
overall charge of the case was Walt Furness, a
grizzled veteran of thirty years, although he�d never known a situation
remotely like this.

�We dusted the
envelope and contents. Nothing. No prints except
yours, John, no traces, zip. We�ve sent the writing off to Quantico for
analysis but I�m not sure how much help that�ll be. But what it does do, is help us with a pointer as to who and what we�re
dealing with.�

John nodded. That
much he�d worked out for himself.

�John, I�ve
got to ask. Do you have any enemies ?�

He would have
laughed in other circumstances. Even now he allowed himself a wry smile.

�A few, Walt. You don�t reach my
position without inflicting some casualties along the way. I�m not exactly the
most popular kid on the block.�

�So, you know
what I�m saying. Any ideas ?�

He shrugged.
�Who would do this ? You�re kidding right
? I can be a shit, Walt, but ��, he threw up
his hands, �� to cause this ?�

�Would you
make a list of all the names you can think of who might dislike you ? Anybody, with or without reason.
We�ll handle them with care.�

John stared
across at him, then nodded.

�Sure. But
isn�t this just about money ? We�re just the innocent
targets.�

Walt eyed him
back, stroking his bristled jaw.

�Maybe. Maybe not.�

&nbsp;

In the large
courtyard, round the swimming pool, most of the mercenaries had spent the early
morning lounging on sunbeds, listening to ipods, drinking coffee, reading magazines, tanning themselves. Even in the safety of this place, two
other mercenaries were on duty, scanning the sophisticated detection equipment,
the horizon and the skies for any signs of intruders.

They were a
tough bunch, reputedly the best. An international squad of men who had fought
and killed side-by-side in many of the world�s harshest places; in eastern
Europe, Asia, around Africa, central America.

Of course,
they had real names. And a plethora of passports from
different countries. But for this job they were simply �The Reptiles�.

&nbsp;

Susan Cumber
had led a charmed life. To her, �embarrassment� up to that point was arriving
at a charity dinner and finding another woman in the same designer dress.
�Shame� was your child not top scoring at school.

But now, she
was squatting naked, in the sun-drenched courtyard, waiting for permission to
defecate onto a laid out newspaper in front of a group of evil men. The same thugs, no doubt, who had raped her the day before.

They were no
longer wearing masks. The thought troubled her.

If they no
longer cared about being identified, what did that mean ?

The men were
all hard featured with cruel eyes. Three were blacks,
one was asian of some sort, the rest varying shades
of caucasian. She estimated their age range to be
mainly in their forties, like her, but a few looked younger and one appeared to
be in his fifties or even sixties. Most were heavily muscled, scarred and
wearing just swimming shorts for sun bathing. A couple had T shirts on as well,
with dark sweat patches. Only one of them looked out of shape, a huge fat black
man with a bald head and an enormous stomach hanging over his belt.

She winced at
the realisation that he had been one of her rapists. Susan liked to think she
was a tolerant, modern woman. Not a racist. But she had been brought up in the
South and the idea of � African Americans � and their black � things � was �
quite literally beyond the pale.

The one who
seemed to be their leader they referred to as Gator.

Gator was
holding a bamboo stick, running it teasingly up the inside of her thighs. He
was one of the ugliest men she�d ever seen, with an entire ear missing and a
livid purple scar distorting one side of his face.

�You hold it
in there for us just a little bit longer, bitch.�

She grimaced.
In truth, she knew she was on the point of losing control. Beads of
perspiration sprouted like teardrops from her pores in the boiling hot sun. She
was squatting, legs akimbo, knees wide apart, her fingers tented on the ground
behind her, her arms propping herself up. She couldn�t imagine a more
humiliating pose.

She would
have rather died than this. But not Rachel, Ryan and Lorna.
They were worth more than any amount of cruelty these bullies could inflict on
her.

The obnoxious
men were fanned out just a few feet in front of her, studying between her legs,
gazing and smirking at her naked thighs, breasts and face.

The edge of
the bamboo poked up between her labia, splaying her open. She was still filthy
from their rape of her the evening before. The foul stink of stale sex and body
odour assaulted her nostrils in the hot sun.

�Please �� she
mouthed silently, a hiccup of air escaping her lips.

The man called
Gator grinned with the half of his mouth that worked. His teeth were yellow and
uneven.

�Okay. You can
dump it all out now. Give us a show.�

She paused.
She was desperate but, when it came to the actual moment, something in her
wouldn�t allow her to accept the embarrassment and shame. Her insides were
turning circles like cement in a mixer. How on earth was she going to do
something so undignified ?

And then it
happened.

With an
uncontrolled rush of noise and air and stench, her sphincter gave way and a
mass of soft faeces splattered the laid out magazines under her body.

She couldn�t
bear to look at the grinning, fascinated faces of the sweating men as they
enjoyed her total dishonour. She shut her eyes and let out an equally
uncontrolled sob.

What had
she done to deserve this ?

&nbsp;

***
*** ***

&nbsp;

�Caught in the crossfire.�

Gene Collins
hung in the manacles, mouth dribbling, doing his best to stay conscious and
understand what the woman behind the mask was saying to him. Caught in the crossfire ? He had been caught up in something beyond his
control.

�Wha �?� he mumbled.

Her gloved
hands eased down his underpants and she used scissors to snip them off him,
leaving him totally naked. Please, no.

�Yes, you�ve
been caught in the crossfire, I�m afraid.� She repeated, her tone of voice less
concerned than the words suggested.

�So, let�s
have a look-see, shall we ?�

Her voice
sounded older, like his mum�s. Her fingers cupped his balls and then smoothed
out his shrivelled, petrified length. He felt like some meagre cut of meat she
was thinking of buying for her family dinner.

�Not bad for a
little one.� He could detect the amusement in her voice.

�Please don�t
��

She moved her
finger to his lips. It smelt of leather. New gloves.

�Ssshhh �� she said. �I won�t hurt you. Not if you�re good.
I�ve got a nice job for this thing anyway.�

He swallowed. Job ?

�You should
have been fucking your bride right now, shouldn�t you ?
Using this cocktail sausage to give her a damned good seeing to, right ? � Right ?�

He nodded
slowly.

�Well, I�m
afraid that you can�t fuck the Cumber kid you wanted to. You see, your fianc�
Lorna is � er � now otherwise engaged. But you can
fuck the other Cumber kid. I�d like that. And I�m sure you�ll enjoy it
too.�

He tried to
shake his head to clear it but merely banged it on the cell wall.

Fuck Rachel ? Lorna�s sis ? I mean � but
why ?

Inside the
eyeholes of the lizard mask, he detected two pupils shining.

�No.� the
woman�s voice said, with the hint of a giggle. �Oh no.
Not Rachel, silly boy ! We wouldn�t want that. No � it�s Ryan we�d like you to give a good seeing to.�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The Chameleons
sat together in the shade and watched their screens. It would have been nice
for them to have the final member of their trio there with them too but he was
rather busy over in the States at that moment.

Still, as
Meatloaf crooned, back when they were both young, �two out of three ain�t bad�.

Two chilled
glasses of lager sat on the table, wonderfully refreshing in the heat of the north African morning.

They chinked
glasses and supped.

Best
enjoyed cold.

There is
something wonderfully erotic about a white woman�s red-lipsticked
mouth sliding up and down the full length of a long black erection.

On the main widescreen, a huge plasma monitor, Susan Cumber was being
slowly spit roasted in the sunshine. Gecko, a heavily tattooed warrior of
uncertain parentage and nationality but now carrying a Russian passport, was
crouched behind her as she knelt on the sun bed. His muscled torso glistened
with suntan oil as he sensuously eased himself in and out of her slurping cunt.

Cobra was
lying on the sunbed, his massive black belly
glistening with sweat, his fat fingers possessively entwined in her platinum
blonde tresses, guiding her pursed lips up to his swollen helmet, then back
down his shaft as far as she could manage without gagging. Her pendulous tits
hung down as she worked, nipples brushing Cobra�s inner thighs.

Give the bitch
her due, you really might think she was enjoying it.
The expensive sound system picked up every meaty slap of flesh on flesh, each
moan, every whimper, the continuous sloshy glugs from her cunt and mouth as she tackled her first ever
threesome.

Gecko and
Cobra played their parts too, with the usual porn star noises and �yes babe�, �mmm � you love it don�t you�, �oooh
you�re so tight round my dick� and other choice blue movie screenplay comments.

The
microphones taped. The cameras rolled, focussed close up, so as to catch her
face in glorious detail but only showing her lovers from their necks to their
knees. In the smaller screens to the side, other lenses captured the views from
below and also a long shot of the entire scene.

For Susan
Cumber, it was going to be one long, super-hot day.

The Chameleons
exchanged excited glances as Gecko uttered a prolonged, orgasmic groan and
unleashed his first orgasm of the morning.

Everything was
going to plan.

And for the
Cumber family, things were about to get a hell of a lot worse.

PART THREE

�Three
little birds�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

It was always
hard for him to remember anything much before the Rage.

Before the
�red mist� descended.

The first
nineteen years of his life seemed to have gone pretty well, as far as he could
recall.

Then came the summer of Seventy Six.

Sounds like
a fucking song doesn�t it ? Teenage kicks, we learned
some tricks, oh we took out our dicks and fucked those chicks, during the long
hot Summer of �76.

He�d even
strummed guitar back then, before he smashed it into pieces.

Sunday, 4th
July 1976, was a truly significant day in Charlie�s life for three reasons.

First, it was
the day that the Israeli Sayeret Matkal
Special Forces launched their daring raid on Entebbe Airport in Uganda,
sparking in him a love of military warfare that had never left him.

Second, it was
America�s Bicentenial Celebration; 1776 � 1976. The 200th anniversary of the Declaration of
Independence. One of the things that he could still remember was the
excited atmosphere: the festivities and parades, the enormous firework displays
that lit up the night sky, the fluttering flags, the cook outs and evening
parties, the sound of music, the taste of beer and the scent of spliffs.

And thirdly, 4th
July 1976 happened to be the day that John Cumber fucked his fianc� and set
this whole darned thing in motion.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

The youngest
Chameleon loved playing delivery guys.

This time he
was still �white�; but he had become �tallish�, �grey haired�,
�probably late forties� and �clean shaven�. He was also wearing a
genuine Fedex uniform. He dropped the package at the
Cumber Building reception on a frantic Monday morning, got it signed for and
even stuck his tongue out at the CCTV cameras on his way out.

It didn�t
matter. It was the last time he would be doing things this way.

&nbsp;

John Cumber
felt his blood run cold when his Executive Assistant brought in the mound of
mail with a �JOHN CUMBER, TOP SECRET, EYES ONLY� package on the top. He
immediately recognised the big, black, handwritten upper case letters.

For a moment
he wondered if he should call Security without delay to trigger a search and
chase. But he figured it would have taken a minimum of fifteen minutes for the
package to reach him. By now, the person who delivered it would be long gone.
It had a Fedex sticker. Maybe that could be used to
trace somebody if it was genuine ?

More
importantly, he wanted to open the package in private.

He tore it
open, revealing an inner envelope, one of those square plastic coated cards
used to protect computer discs. It contained a CD of some sort.

�Thanks,
Shelly.� He said, his tone making it clear to his EA that he needed time alone.
She discreetly shut the office door behind her.

&nbsp;

He pulled a
pair of plastic gloves that Walt had given him out of his desk drawer. Best to keep his prints off it. The disc was silver and
blank on one side. He turned it over. �BEST ENJOYED RED HOT� was the title
stencilled in gaudy red, pink and turquoise, swirling round the centre of the
disc like some nasty XXX porno DVD title. John Cumber hated pornography,
regarding it along with cigarettes and drugs as the three vices that were
undermining the moral backbone of Western Civilisation. He hadn�t partaken in
any of the three since his student days.

&nbsp;

With moist,
trembling fingers, he opened his PC drive and loaded the disc, clicking the
mouse to fire it up.

First, there
was music. That Louis Armstrong number; �We have all the time in the world�.
Suddenly the monitor flickered. Words scrolled down the screen.

&nbsp;

�Dear Mr. Cumber,

Welcome to �Best
Enjoyed Red Hot�. I hope your secretary doesn�t catch you jerking off while you
watch it ! It�s only a snippet of the whole movie
actually, just five minutes of edited highlights. What they call a �Cum Shot
Recap� in the trade I think. Watch it very carefully. As I said before, I never
give unclear instructions. Do not fast forward. When it�s finished we�ll
continue our little chat. Bye for now.�

&nbsp;

The music
faded. Almost instantaneously, without warning, Susan�s face filled the screen.

He stared at
his wife. Something was wrong.

And then
liquid spattered her face, the lens, everywhere. Hell, no. He realised what it
was. Great gobs of semen were landing on her from both sides of her face. He
caught sight of the ends of two penises just at the edge of the screen, jerking
and spurting. There was male laughter in the background accompanied by the
usual murmurs and sounds of orgasm, on top of some kind of �elevator music�
soundtrack.

And then, worse. He saw she was
actually smiling. Mouth open, apparently taking what they were doing in good
humour. Eyes shut against the cascading fluid but his wife�s lovely dazzling
teeth were visible, her expression even suggesting she wanted it.

&nbsp;

Without
warning, the action cut to another scene, this time of Susan outdoors, on some
kind of sun bed. She was being � having sex with � one guy while another � a
black guy � was � she was performing fellatio on him !

He wanted to
shut his eyes but he couldn�t. He stared, heart beating dangerously fast, as a
heavily tattooed and muscled man � mounted his wife from behind. It wasn�t
rape. He was doing it sensuously and slow and she was even thrusting back to
meet him.

And then the
camera panned and zoomed closer on her lips sliding greedily up and down an
oversized black penis, virtually gagging each time she got more than half of
the thing in her stretched mouth.

And the noises. He could hear them
all as if they were doing it here and now on his mahogany desk. The wet slurping sounds and the men muttering how great she was
over the dreadful �muzak� in the background.

And Susan
gasping and groaning in return.

&nbsp;

He watched all
six scenes they had included before the disc faded out. By the time it had
finished, John Cumber was blubbering like a child.

More words
started scrolling down the screen like movie credits. They were blurred and he
wiped his eye on his sleeve so he could read them.

&nbsp;

�John,

Now, now. Don�t
cry. After all, if you miss Susan and you�re feeling
horny, you can watch it again and pretend it�s your dick she�s sucking. Here�s
the deal. You can buy your kids back for two hundred and fifty million bucks
each. Plus another two fifty for the fianc�. I know
math is your thing but, just in case you�re not thinking straight, that�s a
round billion for the four youngsters.

If we do that
transaction, and if it all goes real well, then we can talk about your wife. After I�ve finished with her of course. And to show no hard
feelings I�ll make you a good price. Do what I say and I�ll only price her at
one buck !

Well, gotta go. My balls are full. A gentle
reminder about the Cumber stock price. Don�t let it close below 15. I
hear there are some big sell orders out there. I�ll be in touch again soon.�

&nbsp;

Dazed, he
despairingly picked up the phone to call Walt Furness
but, before he got it to his mouth, he dashed to his bathroom and was violently
sick.

&nbsp;

***
*** ***

&nbsp;

He never
finished College. His break up from Melanie finished his academic career for
good. Instead, he joined the military.

But not the US
Army. Being a Brit on his mother�s side and desiring both a fresh start and
anonymity, Charlie fled to the UK on the day before his 20th
Birthday and applied to join up there.

Not just any
regiment. The Paratroop
Regiment.

The legendary Paras. The maroon machine.

As hard a
bunch of geezers as ever pulled on a beret and uniform anywhere.

The induction
and training were so hard he nearly dropped out a couple of times but his rage
and talent kept him going. In the end he passed with flying colours.

Then, with the
top brass�s customary sense of humour, his commanding officer selected him to
train as a specialist signals operator, mainly due to the fact that his full
name was Charlie Victor, both letters of the army�s radiotelephony phonetic
alphabet.

He served in
Northern Ireland. The Middle East. The
Falklands. He was decorated twice.

After five
years, he transferred to the Special Air Service. The equally
legendary SAS. Who dares wins and all that jazz.

Until the �red
mist� got him into trouble one too many times and he was � well � his time in
service to adopted Queen &amp; Country was over.

They sent him
to a special psychiatric facility for two months to help him acclimatise to the
civilian world and address his �anger management� needs. And for a while it
seemed to help. But the well meaning doctor who taught him not to lash out in
the heat of the moment, only really succeeded in planting another seed in
Charlie�s tortured mind.

Don�t react
in the heat of the moment. Stay calm. If you must seek retribution, it is
something best enjoyed in the cold light of the dawn.

After seven
disastrous weeks of wearing a suit behind a desk in an office job, Charlie
Victor walked into the street one lunchtime and never
returned. He drowned his sorrows in a London pub.

Sitting next
to him that fateful afternoon was a man with a livid purple scar down one side
of his face and a missing right ear. Both men recognised each other as
ex-military, kindred spirits. They sat at the bar for many hours swapping
anecdotes and opinions and, by the time the landlord called �last orders�, a
firm friendship had begun.

Over the next
few days, after a few introductions to the right people, the man they had soon
codenamed �CV� became a mercenary.

Cry Havoc ! Let slip the Dog of War.

He became one
of the very best. Perhaps, even the best.

Even so, this
final mission had taken Charlie over ten years to plan and prepare.

But finally he
was ready.

In 2007.

Yep, best
enjoyed cold.

Fucking freezing, in fact.

&nbsp;

He had
assembled a detailed file on Susan Cumber that went back more than a decade.
Press cuttings, magazine photos, and his own
reconnaissance zoom lens shots taken during periods between combat missions
around the world. He had watched her grow and mature and raise her teenage kids
and bloom into her late-thirties and forties, still beautiful, still immaculate
and still faultless.

It was not her
fault that she and her children were now in cells downstairs about to suffer an
ordeal that nobody should be put through.

The blame
lay squarely at the door of her husband.

&nbsp;

�Please � Daaaaddd !
Please do whatever they say. Give them the cash Dad. Or they�ll cut my b �
balls off !�

The close up
of Ryan Cumber�s genitals looked very painful on
film. A noose of piano wire was wrapped tightly round his scrotum and another
garrotte around the crown of his penis had turned it purple.

Gloved hands,
clearly visible in the picture, threatened the boy with emasculation. Two quick
tugs and his sausage and eggs would be history.

�Cut !� said the masked male Chameleon.

�Nooooooo !�
the boy screamed in terror.

Everybody
laughed.

�He means cut
the film.� Gator said, punching the boy�s ribs good-humouredly. �Well, at least
� for now.�

&nbsp;

Meanwhile, in
another cell, the female Chameleon was directing Rachel Cumber�s
contribution to their fundraising epic.

�Daddy, we�re
all okay so far. I�m fine. Like, they haven�t touched me. But you gotta to do what they say, daddy, and everything will be
alright. Please get them their money quick. Please. I love you.�

Rachel looked
up at her for approval, eyes brimming with tears.

�Perfect.� The
Chameleon replied, switching the recording button off. Then she looked back
straight into the 21 year old�s wet baby-blues. �Thirsty ?�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

He wanted to
see her face when he did it.

And for her to see his.

Charlie wasn�t
a big fan of anal sex. He had always been a cunt and mouth man. I mean, why
sneak in the back when a nice purpose-built front entrance was available ? The butt was unhygienic and unnatural and to his
mind over-rated. He understood the attraction to gays but not to heterosexual
couples except maybe occasionally for a bit of novelty.

But he�d seen
enough over the past thirty years to know that anal adds a new dimension to a
female�s shame. Susan Cumber was a backdoor virgin and he was going to be the
first guy to enjoy her that way.

They were in
the old fort�s underground interrogation room. Built in the 1950s, it was a
large space, recently re-equipped with all the most modern and effective
instruments of torture. 

Susan Cumber
was fastened onto a padded table. It was like a medieval rack but covered in
black PVC, with 21st Century dials, knobs and gizmos. The tabletop
comprised four quarters and each rectangle could be controlled separately,
upwards, downwards, outwards, rotating. As a result, each of her four limbs was
able to be moved to whatever position Charlie desired.

He had her
arms outstretched above her head and her legs splayed apart and up in the air,
as if she was trying to get her ankles back behind her ears. As a result, her
butt cheeks hung nicely over the edge of the table.

She had been
allowed to take a cold shower and wash herself after this morning�s activities
round the pool, then she was fed some more gruel and water, before being
allowed a half hour�s rest curled up on the floor of her cell.

He wanted her
just slightly refreshed.

Now, he had
her alone to himself.

Embarrassed,
she admitted to him that she�d had a couple of enemas in hospital but he knew
this one would be different; a dreadful, chilled cramping solution laced with
an additive that would irritate her bowel and rectum and tender sphincter.

After he had
fixed the nozzle into her guts, he stood back and watched her sweat and grimace
as all four pints filled her, distending her nicely muscled abdomen.

�Please � aaaooorrgghh �� she groaned, trying to focus on him.

He smiled. It
was strange. He truly felt he already knew her, after all this time, and yet
she had never seen him and they had not spoken. He thought of all the articles
he�d read, the interviews, including his favourite.

�Hold it in.�
he barked. �Or your daughters will pay.�

Beads of
perspiration were bursting out of every pore on her face and body. Every sinew
in her stretched limbs strained.

He started to
whistle. She had once given an interview to her daughter�s school magazine.
Although it had been seven years ago, he had only recently found a copy. Oh,
thank the stars for search engines. It was one of those na�ve interviews full
of questions like �what is your favourite perfume� and �where was your best vacation ?�

He loved it.
She had revealed her favourite singer was Bob Marley.
So he whistled a little tune for her:

&nbsp;

�Don�t
worry about a thing,

Cause
every little thing gonna be alright.�

&nbsp;

He made her
hold the enema for several minutes, then allowed her
to expel the mass of dirty water into a bucket he held between her thighs.

She sighed
with relief in spite of the burning sensation in her guts.

Now it was
almost time.

He put the
bucket aside and sealed it with a lid. Then he walked casually around the
table, touching her, enjoying her emerald eyes as they nervously followed his
tour of her. Linda Evans, that dame from Dallas or Dynasty or whichever �80s TV
crap, that�s who she reminded him of. He reached out and squeezed her
breasts that were splurged to her sides. Even the fittest 45 year old couldn�t
defy gravity forever. He decided one time soon he would tit fuck her.

Finally,
Charlie stood humming at the end of the table, inches from her defenceless rose
bud, specked with a few remaining drops of water.

&nbsp;

�Rise
up this morning,

Smiled
with the risin� sun,

Three
little birds

Pitch
by my doorstep

Singin� sweet songs

Of
melodies pure and true

Sayin� this is my message

to you-ou-ou.�

&nbsp;

And on the �you-ou-ou� he took the lubed-up, heavily ridged vibrator and shoved it brutally into
the middle of her puckered, virgin backdoor.

Susan Cumber
howled with pain but couldn�t do anything about it.

&nbsp;

***
*** ***

&nbsp;

At that very
moment, John Cumber, Walt Furness and just two other
senior agents were sat in an embarrassed hush as the DVD played out on the
private viewing screen. The men looked straight ahead, not turning heads left
or right, ashamed to catch each other�s eye.

But it was the
noises that hit them hardest. The wet slurping and men
muttering and Susan gasping and groaning like some porn starlet. They
were men of the world but all were married and they found it impossible to
imagine the emotions that John must be feeling as they watched.

Even just the
fact he had to share this with them.

Walt had
accorded it �top-secret� and �inner-circle-only� basis.

But nevertheless.

Then came the message at the end.

Asking for a billion dollars.

And valuing Susan Cumber at just one dollar.

&nbsp;

Finally it
finished and they all sat in uncomfortable silence.

Walt coughed.

�John � I
don�t know what to say.�

Fortunately,
his embarrassment was interrupted by the phone ringing.

John hit the
speaker button placing the incoming call on conference.

�John ?� said an animated voice. There were chaotic noises in
the background.

�Yes ?� John replied, all faces looking across at him.

�John, it�s
overwhelming. There are some huge sell orders. We�re buying but the
price is in freefall.�

A pause. �It�s already dropped under
thirteen bucks.�

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

He smiled down
into her face as he eased his erection into her bottom. She was loose and ready
for him after the withdrawal of the huge dildo.

He placed his
hands proprietarily on her tits and kneaded them like dough balls. Slowly he
started rocking his hips backwards and forwards.

�Mmm �� he exhaled, �� good.�

She had shut
her eyes but was biting her lower lip, wincing.

�Open your
eyes little bird.�

She snatched
them open. They glistened; half with tears and half with anger, he suspected. 

�Tell me,� he
asked, �did your husband ever ask you to try it like this ?�

She gawped at
him, mouth like a goldfish. Her tits were jiggling in time with his thrusts,
wobbling like a pair of blancmanges on a dish.

�I asked a
question. I expect an answer.�

She nodded her
head as much as the table allowed. �Yes. B � but just good
naturedly. J � joking. It isn�t something he
really � wants.�

He nodded
back, building a nice rhythm.

�That�s how
guys who actually want something usually ask their wives, you know.�

She swallowed.
Her expression portraying shock that she was having a
conversation like this, at a moment like this. And the truth of his
comment seemed to have hit a nerve.

�Before too
long you�re going to take each guy here up this arse.�

He said it as
matter-of-factly as he could. No good natured joking.

�Unless, of
course �� he continued, �you want Lorna to help you out ?�

She flinched. Just the slightest pause. Interesting.

�N � ngh � no.� she replied. �I�ll do it m � myself.�

Charlie nodded
approvingly and increased his pace, hammering into her, his hips slapping
against her upturned taut buttocks. There was no need to hold back, no need to
impress. After all, he wasn�t trying to please her.

�Mmmmmm � yesssssss �� he hissed
in triumphant early release.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

On the big TV
in the guards common room, a soccer match was playing.
Apart from two mercenaries, all the men were sat round drinking beer, smoking
and eating nuts, shouting at the screen.

At the front
of the room, placed next to the TV, Lorna Cumber was bent over in a pillory
facing the half circle of men. The 23 year old�s neck
and wrists were held at a �convenient� height through three holes in a T bar,
forcing her to stoop over with her butt nicely presented behind her.

Her head was a
perfect height for her duties at a man�s waist level.

She was naked
but for a brutal spider-gag that held her jaws apart and mouth wide open, lined
with a rubber dental breach to prevent biting.

One at a time,
the mercenaries rose from their seats to take a break from the game. Some
simply pumped their dicks into her mouth for a while, deciding to prolong their
orgasms. Others did the same but then jerked themselves off, so that they
unloaded over her face and down her throat. But increasingly, as the beer
flowed and the match got more exciting, they simply used her as a urinal. They
would stand, cigs dangling from their lower lips, half looking at the screen
and half down at her, as they laid their penises onto her tongue and let rip
their frothy second hand lager. Meanwhile, they bantered with their friends
over their shoulders as if she was a mere inanimate object.

Then they
would flick their ash on her hair, shake themselves dry over her face and
jiggle themselves back into their pants before sitting back down without even a
second thought. Usually they were soon replaced by another colleague with a
swollen bladder.

Her tears and
gasps as she struggled to breathe were ignored.

Of course,
Lorna Cumber�s proper punishment could wait
until the final whistle had blown.

And after that
they would enjoy moving onto her sister, the third and final little bird.

&nbsp;

PART FOUR

�Four
Letters, Two words�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

She knew it
was wrong. Even through the euphoria of joints and tequila and the
extraordinary fireworks, she should never have snuck off like that. For years
afterwards she consoled herself with the illusion that it was simply her karma.
But she always secretly knew better. Fate is about choices.

Right and wrong choices.

Melanie had
never been with another boy. Suddenly it hit her that she would be going up the
aisle without experiencing � well, �different�.

It was 1976
after all. Not 1946. Or 1876 !

You just
didn�t marry the first boy you slept with anymore.

And so it was,
when Charlie passed out stoned on the bed, and John invited her outside for
�some fresh air�, she stupidly hesitated.

�Come on.� He
said, holding out his strong hand. �Trust me.�

As they walked
out, Leonard Cohen was playing on the stereo. It was one of her and Charlie�s
favourite albums, �Songs of Love and Hate�. She imagined it quietly soothing
Charlie as he lay in his unconscious stupor. The particular track playing that
moment was �Famous Blue Raincoat�, a song thus condemned to haunt her for the
rest of her life.

It was a warm
Sunday evening, 4th July, and they had all spent the day celebrating
America�s Bicentennial.

John Cumber ! The rest of their crowd
had already staggered home. She was alone with the one guy that every girl
dreamed of. Six foot three of American Adonis, with the face of a Greek legend
and the body � she felt herself moist in the humid, mosquito-laden night air.

Just once ! John Cumber slept with all the girls just once. Why
not her ?

They reached
the lake, the little porch overlooking the water.

�Feeling a bit
better ?� he asked, his dazzling smile enticing her.

She gulped. �Yeah. Thanks.�

And then his
strong right hand was behind her neck, pulling her face to him. She gasped in
shock as he mashed his lips fiercely against hers.

�Mmmou � ch �� she mumbled,
pulling away.

His left hand
snaked up the back of her top seeking her bra clasp.

She tried to
calm him, a battle raging within her. Just once.

He unclipped
her bra and pushed his hand round the front, mauling her boobs. Her mouth hurt
where he was attacking it with his face.

�Come on,
Mel.� He insisted, with an impatient snarl. �You�ll love it. Trust me.� 

And suddenly
she knew this was all wrong. She was engaged. To Charlie.
He was the only guy she wanted, needed.

But John
Cumber wasn�t used to girls turning him down.

Certainly not
prick teasers who accepted an invitation down to the lake. He pushed her onto the
ground, tripping the back of her legs over his shins so she fell onto her back.
And then he jumped on top of her.

The air
exploded out of her lungs with a whoosh.

Wrong place. Wrong
time.

Her karma.

&nbsp;

***
*** ***

&nbsp;

She peered
into the guards� common room. Gator beckoned to her, holding up three fingers.
She guessed that meant there were just three minutes left of the soccer match
to play.

Skink, one of
the black mercenaries, was stood at the human urinal shaking the drops from his
penis. He smiled. None of the men were embarrassed in front of her any more.
Melanie was treated as an �honorary male�.

After the
match ended 3-1, the TV was switched off and the pillory was wheeled into the
centre of the room. It was on a wooden platform with castors that made it easy
to manoeuvre.

The men
rearranged their chairs from the half circle in front of the TV into a full
circle around the pillory. They charged their beer glasses and lit up new
cigarettes while a camcorder on a tripod was set up in position. 

Lorna Cumber
couldn�t speak. The spider-gag meant that drooling and inarticulate gurgles
were the most she could manage. But her expression spoke eloquent volumes
anyway.

Her face
already glistened with ejaculate and urine and her brunette hair hung down in
sodden strands. 

Melanie stayed
out of Lorna�s field of vision. She wasn�t wearing her lizard mask. Not that
she needed to worry but she decided she would save up a face to face meeting
for another day. She sat down with a nice view of Lorna�s naked and defenceless
bottom.

Gator smiled
at the poor, helpless girl. The rear vistas of fit, young ladies are so
dreadfully attractive; the camber of their spines, the violin shaped curves
with no lumps or wrinkles yet, the dimples and their peeking, unspoiled
rosebuds.

At 6� 5� of
solid muscle, Gator was a contrastingly terrifying sight, with his missing ear
and dreadfully scarred face.

�Hi !� he said to Lorna pleasantly, pausing as if she could
reply.

�Feel free to
chip in at any time.� He added, reaching down to push a few strands of her hair
away from her face so they could both see each other.

�I�m afraid
your mom had the opportunity to save you from all this but she chose not to.
She�s in her cell sleeping, after a nice hot meal. You see we gave her the
choice of being here now. Or your baby sis. Or you.�

He laughed.

�And she chose
� you. What were her exact words, guys ?�

He turned to
the circle of men, as if asking for help.

�Er � yeah � she said that she was too old to take
this treatment, and she loved Rachel too much to sentence her to it, so
it had to be you !�

He stroked the
edge of Lorna�s eyes, flicking away tears.

�Personally I
can understand Rachel being her favourite daughter. I mean, we would all have
preferred her too, as she�s a much better looker than
you ! But a deal�s a deal. We said your mom could
choose.�

He held open
the palms of his hands as if to say, �what can you do ?�

�Now, I�m
afraid this isn�t going to be pleasant. You�ve spent twenty three years living
as a spoilt brat, so you�re not going to find it easy to learn the level of
humility and obedience necessary to satisfy us.�

Melanie
squirmed on her seat. Gator was so good at this routine, choosing just the
right words.

�But then,� he
continued, �we�ve got plenty of time. Weeks, months, maybe
even years. Boy are we gonna have some fun,
sweet cheeks.�

He showed her
the bamboo cane he had been holding behind his back.

�Let�s start
with ten introductory strokes, shall we ?�

He winked at
Melanie and passed her the cane when she stood up.

Melanie looked
at the watching men and then at the lovely pale buttocks stretched, and on a
plate, facing her at just the right height.

But
suddenly all she could see was a lake, with a little porch overlooking the
water and a boy and girl standing on the bank in the fading light.

Slowly, she
raised the cane and thrashed it down across Lorna�s butt.

&nbsp;

***
*** ***

&nbsp;

Charlie
sneered down into Susan�s face as he uncorked his softening erection from her
bottom.

�Open your
eyes, bitch.�

She opened
them again, full of pain and shame and who-knew-what-else.

�Thank me.�

�Th � thank you.�

He let her see
him examining his cock.

�You want to
lick this clean or you want Lorna to do it ?�

�I�ll do it.�

He walked up
to the other end of the table, then pressed a button.
There was a whirring sound as her back and head descended to knee height.

�You think
about biting me and your kids will all pay.�

He gave her
his glistening, streaked and dripping dick to suck. Man that was good. As that
rhyme went; �Any soft mouth felt good, always did, always
would�. But this was something else entirely; a beautiful face, an
unwilling woman and a shit-stinking dish eaten real cold.

But he hadn�t
finished with Lady Goody-Two Shoes yet.

He pulled his
dick out of her lips.

�You know what
rimming is ?�

She shook her
head side to side. As he suspected. Lovely.

�I�m going to
turn round and sit down on your face. You are going to stick out your tongue
and shove it as far as you can up my arsehole.�

He beamed at
her look of utter disgust.

�Look at it
this way, at least you�re sparing your lovely
daughters all this stuff. That is � unless you�d rather not kiss my butt until
it gleams ?�

It was too
easy. All the attempts at negotiation had ceased. It was going to be such fun
in the days ahead pushing and pushing, until he found her resistance point.
Then things would get really interesting.

She stuck out
her tongue to signify she would do what he ordered.

�Say please.�
He said.

A pause. �Please.�

He turned
round, stood astride her head, and lowered his backside ever so slowly over her
face, until he felt her nose tickling his crack hairs.

He reached
round with his fingers and pulled the cheeks of his butt as far as apart as he
could. That had to be one heck of a view.

When he was at
junior high there�d been a toilet cubicle with a piece of graffiti that always
made him chuckle; �One million flies can�t be wrong !
Eat Dung !�

He encircled
her tongue and nose and let go with his fingers, closing as tight a seal as he
could round her breathing apparatus. Yesss !

He settled his
weight down and idly wondered what was going on in the rest of the house at
that moment.

&nbsp;

***
*** ***

&nbsp;

The trading
screens and digital ticker displays around the room shrieked out the latest
development in the market in general, and the Cumber Corporation�s share price
in particular.

It had climbed
to $14 but kept meeting resistance as soon as it tried to move above. The
information feeds sucked data in from numerous sources.

So far, John
Cumber had already spent some $300,000,000 of his personal fortune buying back
shares in the conglomerate he had founded and then floated fifteen years
earlier.

�Please,
Ellen, give me the figures.� He said.

Of all the
people in the room, John Cumber was strangely the most composed,
the coolest.

Not without
reason was his nickname on Wall Street �Cucumber�, as in cool as a cucumber. He
was a veteran of several bloody hostile takeovers and corporate battles and; when
the going gets tough, the tough get going.

�John, you�ll
understand these figures are only approximate.�

The speaker
was Ellen O�Leary, the head of his private office. She was both a qualified
lawyer and certified accountant. A formidable divorcee in her mid-fifties, she
was devoted to her boss and friend.

Like any
billionaire, nobody knew John Cumber�s net worth for
sure on a day to day basis.

�You have
around two point seven billion dollars at today�s valuations.� She continued.
�That doesn�t include say a hundred million of less liquid assets; your homes,
cars, the jet, jewellery, art and furniture. Obviously we could raise cash on
the back of those but heaven forbid it will come to that.�

Her grey eyes
peered at him intently over half-moon glasses.

Around the
table, seven more people looked up, some scribbling on pads.

�Does that
include the three hundred million already spent today ?�
he asked.

�You would
have to knock that off the two point seven.� She replied. �Except that you�ve
purchased more Cumber stock with it so you could still include it. So long as the price stays where it is.�

�So, how much
of my two point seven billion is held in our stock now ?�

�One point five billion.�

�Which leaves me just one point two billion in usable assets.�

He had cut
to the chase. She nodded, tapping her pencil on her
pad.

�Of which I
need one billion for the children�s ransom.�

A geeky lawyer type coughed and spoke up.

�Er � Sir. Mister Collins has already made it clear he�ll
put up the two fifty for his own son.�

John Cumber
bridled at the interruption. The problem was his. The solution would be his.
He would pay Gene�s ransom. 

�That�s most
kind of him. But I will pay the full amount if it comes to it. I�ll call him as
soon as we�ve finished.� John made a note on his pad.

�So I have two
hundred million of other liquidity still available ?�

�Yes.� Ellen
replied, with a grimace. �But around half of that is no longer in your name.
You remember the trusts we set up for Lorna, Ryan and Rachel. It will take a
while to get the trustees legally to agree to using
the funds in that way.�

�So for now I
have a measly hundred million bucks of liquidity and a bunch of useless Cumber
Corporation stock that I can�t sell or the price will collapse.�

There was a
silence in the room.

People looked
down at their pads.

Suddenly one
of the large screens in the room flickered and popped. Unlike the price
monitors, it had been broadcasting Financial Media footage of talking heads and
features with the volume set low.

Moments later
the volume erupted into life.

�Daddy, we�re
all okay so far.�

Rachel Cumber�s distinctive nasal voice was clear but petrified.

Her
out-of-focus features slowly emerged from a blur on the screen.

�I�m fine.�
She said. �Like, they haven�t touched me. But you just have to do what they
say, daddy, and everything will be alright.�

Everybody in
the room stared in horror from the screen to John and back again.

�Oh � my ��
Ellen bit her knuckles and shut her eyes tight.

�Get the Feds !� A voice shouted, as a man pushed his chair back from
the table and dashed out of the room.

Again, the
calmest person seemed to be John Cumber. He stared at his younger daughter�s
darling blue eyes, brimming with tears.

�Please get
them their money quick.� Rachel beseeched him. �Please. I love you.�

He actually
smiled. A steely grin, but a smile none the less.

�And I love
you too, darling.� John Cumber mouthed to his daughter.

But it wasn�t
love he was feeling.

It was hate. Hatred for the person or persons who had done this.

Love and
Hate. Two words, each of four letters.

How
entwined those two emotions sometimes are.

The masked
Chameleon stood in front of Rachel.

�Thirsty ?�

The girl�s
lips were cracked and split. It had been four days since she had a proper
drink. Her mind had to have become delirious with dehydration.

Several more
hours had passed since she had last teased her.

Rachel�s head
nodded pathetically. �Mmm � yeth��

The Chameleon
placed the bucket of brown water on the floor at their feet. They were not
far from the Sahara Desert. Fresh drinking water was valuable
!

Rachel was
still dressed in her sweat soaked and soiled �sister of the bride� designer
suit. Soon it would be time to strip her but, for the moment, the female
Chameleon enjoyed postponing the fun.

�I�m fine.
Like, they haven�t touched me.� Hah !

For now, a
drink of her mother�s enema water would suffice as an opening move in this game
of revenge.

Melanie
thought back to that night, when he had made her wash herself
off in the lake afterwards, and rinse the evidence from her body and mouth. She
could still taste the memory of the briny, muddy water.

She raised the
pitcher to Rachel�s lips.

�Come on.
Drink up.�

The girl was
so out of it she didn�t even seem to notice the flavour.

Melanie smiled
to herself.

Oh well,
even enemas are best drunk cold.

In the cheap
motel room, Lenny dumped the convenience store bag on the bed and pulled out
one of the cans. He fired up his laptop and cracked open the beer while he
waited.

He sat at the
screen and spent ten minutes doing business, humming away to the tune on his ipod; �Four Letters, Two words� by The Urge. The St.
Louis rock band had been one of his favourites before they split.

Man, he was a fuckin� IT genius. Physically his PC was in the States but
cyber-wise it relocated to a different country every minute. After he had done
what he needed to do, he shrugged. Talking of �urges�, what�s a young man
meant to do in a strange town all on his own !

Lenny opened
his Favourites folder and clicked on his number one site.

The screen
displayed the reassuring orange and red letters on a grey background.

He clicked
�Stories�. Red and grey on white appeared.

�Aha�. He
smiled. One of his favourite authors had posted.

Lenny stood up
off the seat and undid his jeans and shucked his briefs down to his ankles. He
opened the �Whole Story�.

Soon he was
hard, reading and scrolling, the mouse in his left hand and his dick throbbing
in his right.

It didn�t take
him long. He grimaced and accidentally hosed the keyboard with an extra long
spurt. He laughed and, in his mind�s eye, imagined Rachel Cumber�s
snotty little face covered with his jizz. Fictional
stories were all very well but �

That�s what
he would like to do to her real soon.

PART FIVE

�Five
foot two eyes of blue�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

�Five foot two, Eyes of Blue

But oh ! What those
five foot could do

Has anybody seen my girl

Turned up nose, turned down hose

Flapper, yes sir, one of those

Has anybody seen my girl ?�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Charlie met
the Private Detective in a seedy bar off Melrose. The year was 1987 and Los
Angeles was roasting in a July heat wave. The man pushed a folder across the
table and settled back, lighting up a Marlboro.

Inside the
folder were black and white photographs and notes bashed out on a typewriter.
Charlie studied every one of the photos of her and scanned the typed entries
the detective had made for each of the days he had been paid to keep her under
surveillance.

Melanie still
looked pretty much the same as she had eleven years earlier. Maybe a little
lined round the eyes now but her figure and face were just as he remembered. He
stared across at the private dick.

�Nobody ?�

The guy
exhaled a series of smoke rings and shook his head. Two women at the neighbouring
table glanced over at the source of tobacco smoke and coughed pointedly.

�Sure ?�

The man
shrugged, ignoring the women. �If she has a guy, one, he�s invisible and two,
he sure ain�t getting much action
!�

Charlie didn�t
smile at the crass joke.

�She�s okay
for cash ?�

The Dick
pulled a new piece of paper out of his jacket pocket. It had been scrumpled up and then straightened. He pushed it across the
table. There was a round coffee mug stain on it.

�Last month�s bank statement.�

Charlie
checked the balance and activity. Then he carefully picked up one of the photos
of the boy.

�And her kid ?�

�Nice enough. Cycles to school. OK grades. Doesn�t mix
with a bad crowd. Maybe a bit of a loner. But seems to get on fine with his mom.�

Charlie
nodded, staring down at the photo again.

There was a
long pause. He finally reached into his vest and pulled out a brown envelope
with the agreed amount of pristine $50 bills.

The Dick
mopped the sheen of sweat from his brow with a hanky.

�The kid yours ?� he asked, supping his beer, eyeing the envelope.

He recoiled
almost at once, his eyes betraying a flash of true fear.

�Sorry.� He
opened his palms in apology. �None of my business.�

Silently,
Charlie slowly pushed the brown envelope towards him.

The boy was
turning out nice looking. A typical American 10 year old kid; taller than most,
and lean, apple pie wholesome.

Just like
his fucking dad.

&nbsp;

***
*** ***

&nbsp;

The Chameleon
smiled at the screen. Wall Street had closed five minutes earlier with the
Cumber Corporation having recovered after frantic late trading to end the day
at $15.05, exactly where it started. The rumour was that a particular hedge
fund had been buying to cover its earlier short position.

He looked at
his watch. Time for a midnight feast.

&nbsp;

Rachel Cumber
had replaced her mother on the operating table in the interrogation room. Her
designer skirt and jacket and stained silk blouse had all been removed and she
lay in just her bra and thong. She had been given a little broth to fortify her
for the impending ordeal. Her chest rose and fell visibly with the beating of
her heart. Her blue eyes roved around the room absorbing the scary furniture
and devices hanging all around. 

&nbsp;

Charlie and
Melanie had dispensed with their lizard masks. The game had reached a new
stage. They preferred seeing, and being seen. But they had dressed up in their
kinkiest bondage gear. He had donned tight black leathers while she was dressed
in a bright red PVC catsuit.

&nbsp;

Rachel
whimpered and sobbed when she saw them.

�Please � give
him more time � he�ll get you the money.�

�Of course he
will.� Melanie smiled.

�But �� the
girl�s voice trailed off.

Melanie
pouted. But � who gives a fuck ? You think
it�s about the money bitch ? Why is it that rich
people always think everything is about money ?

She reached
out and ran her fingers casually over Rachel�s stretched limbs. Her boobs were
a bit disappointing lying flat in the lace bra but that problem could soon be
sorted.

What you
couldn�t deny was the allure of the face; the cheekbones, nose, mouth and jaw,
all perfectly aligned. Her blond hair was greasy and lank but it would soon
perk up after a nice shampoo and blow dry.

�What are you
� going to do to me ?� the girl finally whispered.

�Oh � the list
is too long.�

Melanie
glanced over at Charlie. He was unbuckling his belt.

�Please � I � I�m a virgin ��

�Really ?�

Charlie
smiled, eyes twinkling. She winked back at him. The surprising media rumours
sounded as if they were true after all. 

�Well then, I
think you�ve really gotta lot of catching up to do.� Melanie
said.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Each year,
between missions, Charlie visited Los Angeles and met up with the same Private
Detective. As usual, the man pushed over a folder and lit a Marlboro but this
time Charlie�s intuition detected a difference.

As ever, physically
she appeared to have barely changed. It was 1993 and she was now 35 years old.

�Nobody ?�

He always
asked the same question first and had always got the same reply until then.

The guy
studied a series of smoke rings and stared into the distance. Enjoying his moment. Neither Charlie nor the Dick
liked each other. It was a business transaction, nothing else.

�Nope.�

�Sure ?�

The man
shrugged. �You heard of the internet ?�

Charlie
nodded. His time as a signals specialist in the army had pretty much predated
the web. He was no expert but he knew enough.

�Well your old
lady is a keen � how�d you say � er � user of the
net.�

He frowned.
Over the years he had learned to let nothing phase
him. He was immune to pain, fear, jealousy, love, all
of the weaknesses that betrayed a man. He would live fast and die young. Die
alone.

�What do you mean ?�

�Look, I don�t
know for sure. The tracking technology is new and unreliable. But she is a
frequent visitor to � well � certain sites.�

�You mean like
dating sites. Personals ?�

�No. Not that
I can tell.�

�Well �?�
Charlie almost slammed his fist down on the table but he controlled himself.
The old �anger management� techniques still worked. 

Don�t react
in the heat of the moment. Stay calm.

�I mean � well
� porn sites. But mostly fictional story sites.�

Charlie
exhaled; one-two-three-breathe.

�Yes ?�

�There is this
site that specialises in � you�ve heard of bdsm, right ?�

He waited, not
even deigning to reply.

�Well, there�s
an author named �Famous Blue Raincoat�. Writes all kinda kinky stuff.�

He already
knew where this was going. Only one person would use that nom de plume.

�Enough.� He
interrupted. �You have evidence ?�

The Dick
smiled and tented his fingers.

�I think that
an extra payment would be in order.�

Mistake. Big
mistake.

Charlie
grinned back like a reptile. One-two-three-breathe.

�Sure � let�s
meet again late tonight and exchange what you have for another envelope.�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Melanie rode
the thick dildo vigorously. Thick but just right.

It stood
upright from an inflatable gag in Rachel�s mouth. She could hear the girl
struggling for air. Well, she thought, lucky for the bitch I keep myself in
good shape. A different woman my age, with flabbier buttocks, and you�d be
suffocating my little hobby horse.

She leaned
forward and kissed Charlie, their tongues entwined.

You wonderful man. Yes, I
still hate you for walking out on me all those years ago. But I love you for
coming back. And for giving me this. Revenge. Not just any old tit-for-tat retribution but vengeance
of a type and on a scale unimaginable in normal life.

She shuddered
as erotic thrills surged up her spine. She wasn�t even remotely lesbian. But
her sexual tastes had been spiced up over the years. Truth was, in the right
mood she could enjoy pretty much anything now.

Somebody
fucks up your life ?

She hammered
down on the dildo, driving herself towards a climax.

You fuck
them back one hundredfold.

&nbsp;

She orgasmed a second time but still Charlie was making it
last. He was standing at the end of the table, pumping in and out between
Rachel�s thighs, controlling himself every time he was about to shoot. Mind
you, he�d already blown several wads that day already so it was easier. Melanie
smiled at how she teased him about not getting any younger. She felt no
jealousy watching him fucking such gorgeous, firm flesh. He belonged to her
forever now and they both knew it.

Sadly there
was no blood. �Virgin� today is a technical term. Rachel�s hymen had long since
been taken by a rampant rabbit or horse riding or whatever activity 21 year old
billionaire kids get off on nowadays.

But Charlie
was nevertheless her first cock. And they still had her asshole and mouth to
go.

And that
was just for starters.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

It was 02.00 hrs local time, when she and Charlie woke Susan Cumber
in her cell. The woman was lying curled up naked on her cell floor.

�Suseee !�
Melanie cooed through the bars. �Wakee
wakee.�

Susan turned
and rose onto her knees, wiping her eyes.

�My friend
here needs his dick cleaned. You want to do it, or would you prefer Lorna did ?�

Susan looked
at them in disgust.

�I�ll do it.�
She sighed quietly.

Charlie turned
away.

�If it�s too
much trouble ��

�Nooo.�
Susan wailed. �I�ll do it � please.�

Charlie looked
undecided, still ready to leave.

�Aw, come on.�
Melanie mock-negotiated with him. �She wants it. Leave
her kids alone.�

Still Charlie
remained unmoved.

�He�s pissed
off.� She confided to Susan. �How about you offer him something new ? I know, offer to tongue his butt, he likes that.�

Susan paused.
�� I � I�ve done that.�

Melanie
laughed. �My, you two are friends already ! Oh dear.
Well fuck it, I can�t think of anything else. Maybe we�d best go visit with
Lorna after all ? She must be getting lonely by now
anyway.�

�No ! Please � look, I�ll do anything.�

There was a
hush. One of those special, awkward silences with a
distinctive quality all of its own.

�Anything ?� she asked. �You said � anything
?�

Susan seemed
to regret her words now. But she composed herself. She swallowed and looked
tearfully into Melanie�s eyes.

�Yes �
anything.�

Dylan was
surfing the net in his room, idly checking out the free porno pages when he
came across the photo. At first he couldn�t believe the likeness. He clicked
through and found several more. Oh man ! He should
tell somebody. But first � he hit the printer menu. While the colour photos chuntered out, he couldn�t help reaching down to his dick.

Ryan Cumber
was his classmate at college and Ryan�s mom Susan was the hottest MILF groin
candy of all. And here she was fuckin� and suckin� like some two dime Eastern
European or Latina pro.

It was
definitely her face and her body. Sometimes these sites fucked around and cut
and pasted heads onto different bodies but those sure were her big tits
swinging around on some black dude�s legs as she sucked him off. Susan
Cumber being spit roasted on a friggin� sunbed, man !

After he�d
mopped himself up with a tissue, Dylan couldn�t resist it. Just one person
wouldn�t hurt. He pasted the URL onto his screen and emailed the link to Greg.

Greg was his
best mate and another fan of Ryan Cumber�s mommy.

He smiled as
he imagined him opening up the page.

Should he tell
the police ? Nah, best not to get
involved.

They�d surely
find the photos soon enough.

&nbsp;

Gator�s six
feet five frame was naked on the poolside workbench in the early morning
sunshine. He was on his back, bench-pressing some heavy weights, his muscles
glistening with sweat and oil. In the pool, several of the Reptiles were
swimming laps, while others were chatting on the deck, drinking juice and
coffee. Physical fitness was a key requirement for a top rung soldier of
fortune.

The clinging
stink of pungent male body odour was strong. Gator hadn�t showered in two days
and he was driving up the bar with animal grunts and groans of effort.

Viper was
playing his �buddy�, stood next to the bench, ready to support the heavy bar if
Gator lost control.

And then,
between Gator�s widespread thighs, kneeling at the end of the bench, was Lorna Cumber. His female
�buddy�.

Her role was
to genuflect in complete silence on the state of Gator�s damp, hirsute and
unwashed anus. The 23 year old beauty was kneeling with her face pushed in
between his thighs, her pink tongue lapping and her arms meekly held behind her
back.

She worked in
complete silence. It was her only chance of saving her fianc�s balls. One
word, one slip up from her, and young Gene�s baby-making kit would be a couple
of scraps for the wild African dogs to fight over.

So Gene was
naturally watching the scene with a fair degree of interest. He was strung up
naked a few feet from the workbench so that he could have a ringside view of
Lorna�s efforts on his behalf. A grubby towel dangled from his own erection. He
watched in complete silence like her, since one word from him, even just one
noisy breath, or if his erection softened and the towel fell to the ground, and
he had been threatened with castration.

Gene and
Lorna were the first prisoners to enjoy each other�s company since the
kidnapping. Well, after all, this was the couples� honeymoon.

Gator thrust
the bar up and held it locked for the twentieth time, wobbling.

�You can do
it.� Viper encouraged.

Gator grunted
and heaved so hard he noisily passed gas.

�Well �� he
grimaced at Viper, �� you said I could !�

Both men
laughed and peered down at Lorna. She recoiled and her hazel eyes had burst
open wide in horror.

Viper shrugged
and casually drew a 9-inch knife from his belt, starting to move meaningfully
towards Gene.

In a second,
Lorna had plunged her face back and recommenced tonguing and kissing Gator�s
hairy butt as if it was delicious frozen yoghurt.

Viper stood
threatening Gene, while sneering over at Lorna.

�What a slut.�
He shook his head. �Kid, we did you a favour, saving you from spending the rest
of your poor life with that toilet face.�

Gator hoisted
the weights bar into the steel supports.

�You gonna fuck our young bride now ?�
Viper asked him.

�Nah.� Gator replied. He rose
gingerly from the bench and removed his towel from Gene�s erection, using it to
wipe the perspiration from his face and forearms. �I�m saving myself for later.
When the real fun begins.�

�In that case
�� Viper said, hauling Lorna up by her dark hair and slamming her face down
onto the workbench, so she whimpered.

He shucked
down his shorts to reveal a semi-hard penis stiffening
by the second. Then he crouched behind her and pulled her hips up so that he
could fuck her from behind while she faced her ex-boyfriend.

Gator
nonchalantly hung his towel back onto Gene�s peg, looking right into his
red-rimmed eyes.

�You watch how
a real man does it kid. Just in case you get the chance again
sometime.�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Susan Cumber
squealed every few seconds. She was standing legs akimbo in front of Charlie
and Melanie plucking out her own triangle of soft pubic fuzz with tweezers,
hair by hair. Her collar and cuffs didn�t match perfectly. Her tresses were
platinum blonde while her pubes were a kind of medium honey colour. She winced
as she depilated herself.

Her tormentors
were sat at a table on their private roof terrace overlooking the palm garden
and desert beyond. They were eating croissants, date pastries and fruit,
sipping black coffee, chatting quietly, ignoring her. Occasionally Melanie
would glance at her and �tut� when her squeaks and �ouchs� got too loud, or she slowed down.

Eventually,
Susan�s pouting mound was scarlet hued and virtually bald.

&nbsp;

�Stand over
there� Charlie said, lighting a cigarette and rising from the table. He was
naked but for an open cotton shirt that was unbuttoned. His penis hung
temporarily sated after he and Melanie had made passionate love together
earlier, a nice contrast to the rape and violence all around them.

He reached up
and pulled down a set of chains that hung from the cross beam that supported
the terrace sunblind. With practised hands he quickly fastened her wrists so
Susan was suspended, now stretched up onto her tip toes.

�Have you ever
seen a movie called Sophie�s Choice ?� he asked.

�Meryl Streep played Sophie.�
Melanie added helpfully.

Susan shook
her head. �N � no.�

�Oh, it was
quite good as far as I recall.� Melanie said, peeling a banana. �In it, Sophie
has to choose which one of her children to save. The other she loses forever.
It�s very moving.�

�No �� Susan
whispered. �You wouldn�t. No ��

Melanie took a
sensuous, suggestive bite of banana, taking her time before replying. She too
was in just a cotton top, open to the midriff, her thighs uncovered. She had
allowed a translucent trickle of Charlie�s semen to ooze onto the tiles under
her chair without any embarrassment.

�Last night
you said you�d do anything, right ?�

�Yes.�

�Well, soon
you will get your chance.�

There was a
silence while both women stared grimly at each other.

�In a little
while, we�re all going to gather round the swimming pool. And you�re going to
invite everybody to fuck your daughters.�

�You �!� Susan
quickly stopped herself, controlling her outrage.

Melanie
chuckled. �I see you�re learning. But too late. You�ll
pay later for that little outburst. If you fail to say exactly what we want,
then � well � um, you really don�t want to think about that.�

She took
another bite of banana, pausing for effect.

�And after
your little sluts have all been fucked many times, you will get the chance to
save one of them. It will be interesting to hear your choice
!�

John Cumber
woke in a terrible sweat. He looked over in the dark at the digital clock;
03.37. He had managed to catnap for three tablet-induced hours. His normally
sharp brain was already suffering from lack of sleep.

The nightmare
was a terrible one. Susan was on a brightly lit stage having rough sex with
three men while he and all their children, and their extended family, friends
and colleagues were sat in the theatre audience watching.

And he had
opened his zip, was masturbating himself in the dark while he watched his wife,
dressed in torn black lingerie of the type she never wore anymore, performing
with these men. And suddenly a bright spotlight shines down on him without
warning, and the entire audience sees what he is doing, and they all start to
titter. Even his children are chuckling at him as Ryan leans over and says �put
it away, dad�.

He woke up,
painfully erect, and had to go to the bathroom to
urinate.

Afterwards he
lay in the dark, trying but failing to sleep some more.

At exactly
04.00 the phone by his bedside trilled. He fumbled in the dark for the handset
and peered at the digital display. It was blank.

�Yes.� He
said, assuming there had been developments in the case.

�Mr. Cumber.
Rise and shine, or � were you awake already ?�

His heart
stopped and the phone felt cold and clammy in his palm.

�Who is this ?�

�Oh, come on,
John. You know me. You can call me the Chameleon. You know about Chameleons, John ? We�re lizards that can change our skin when we need
to.�

John sat up
bolt upright in bed. The voice was male, American, quite youthful but composed,
taunting.

�Now listen
here you motherfucker ��

�Sssshhh � John. Actually that�s very good. Motherfucker ?
I suppose I am ! Anyway, don�t waste our time
together. I�m calling from a location you can�t trace and using a rather
special phone but, nevertheless, I�m only going to stay talking for one minute
just in case. The reason for my call is to say well done so far. You kept my
shares above 15 dollars, didn�t you ? Now, do you have
my billion dollars ready for me ?�

John felt the
plastic handset cracking in his grip.

�Yes.�

�Good. In that
case I will send you instructions later today about how to wire me the money.
I�ll be very specific. As you know, I never give unclear instructions.�

�How will you
contact me ?�

�Oooh, don�t worry your handsome head about that yet.�

John looked at
the luminous second hand of his watch. Over forty seconds had passed.

�How is my
wife, you bastard. And my family ?�

There was a
silence, just deep breathing.

�Please � Tell
me !�

�Actually your
wife is really a surprisingly good fuck, John.�

�You bastard !�

�Well it�s
funny you should call me that too. Anyway, I want you to ask me nicely to fuck
your wife again.�

John roared
with rage. �You �!�

�Sssssshhh �� The voice interrupted. �In that case I shall
fuck your daughters. In their arses.�

�Noooh !�

The man on the
end of the line made a �tch !�
sound. �Can�t have it both ways, John, it�s either your wife or girlies, which
is it to be ?�

�You fuckhead, I will kill you.�

�Maybe John,
but I doubt it. Well, time�s up. I guess I�m gonna
have to fuck all three of them ��

�No ! Wait !�

�Gotta go.
Catch you later.�

�Please � f �
please � fuck � my wife.� He bellowed.

�Goood.�
The voice teased. �That wasn�t so difficult was it ?
Okay, I�ll give her one from you. And we�ll continue our little chat soon.�

John stared at
his watch trying to think how to keep the conversation going but all he heard
were three more words.

�Bye for now.�

&nbsp;

Lorna knelt
motionless and silent on the tiled floor. She held her eyes and mouth wide
open. A small acidic burp repeated on her, making her throat gag and triggering
yet another wave of nausea. There were no shackles or ropes holding her
anymore, no spider gags or dental breaches. She was simply being �conditioned�
to do exactly as she had been ordered.

A human latrine.

The door
opened and one of the mercenaries entered the small, humid room. He was the
shaven headed black one they called Cobra, with his huge frame and belly.

He whistled
and stood with his feet apart in front of her, unzipping his jeans.

She looked up
into his cruel brown eyes obediently, keeping her lips as wide as possible and
her tongue flat on her lower gums to receive him. She knew what was coming. She
dreaded it. No amount of times made it better or easier. Just the stench of
urine made her feel light headed and her throat gagged; the sharp, sour taste
and the acid after-burn that exploded up through her nose making her eyes
water.

He grinned
down at her and carefully uncoiled his soft but huge penis onto her tongue.

She knew his
flow would be hot as it funnelled down her throat and windpipe and descended
all the way to her stomach, prompting bitter little burps that would recur
afterwards, bile bubbling back up like a geyser.

Worse was how
she had already started to differentiate between the different men and their
taste and how they varied according to the time of day. Mornings were worst.

She felt the
first fiery squirt against her tonsils.

�Mmmm �� she heard him exhale, treating her as nothing but
his urinal.

The rational,
proud side of her brain screamed; no !

But the
emotional, humiliated side somehow accepts she has no choice, petrified by what
might happen to her if she pulls her mouth away. Frightened for Gene, and Mom,
and Rach� and Ryan. But mostly for
herself and the pain of what they might do.

So Lorna knelt
and felt it racing into her gullet, making her eyes stream, trying not to choke
as she swallowed rapidly and it kept filling her mouth, the horrible acrid tang
somehow even worse than she remembered from the previous visitor just ten
minutes before this.

A little
frothed over her lips and down her chin but, somehow, she managed to keep
guzzling until he had finished. She was convinced they all waited until their
bladders were over-full before visiting her. He farted loudly as he shook the
last drips from the end of his length onto her tongue before tucking himself
back into his jeans.

Then he
turned, completely ignoring her, and walked back out into the sunshine.

Doctor
Wolfgang Ernst removed the rubber operating gloves and washed his hands. He
usually preferred to operate in his own very private clinic on the shores of
Lake Geneva but, for his good client and longstanding friend Mister Charles
Victor, Wolfgang was happy to travel. He had spent 25 years specialising in � er � delicate procedures such as treating wounded
mercenaries who were not able to visit official hospitals, and plastic surgery
for criminals who wished to alter their appearance. This little operation had
been straightforward.

Rachel Cumber�s overly modest 32B breasts had been substantially
enhanced. He smiled down at the sleeping blonde who would soon be coming round
from the light anaesthetic he had used. Her pretty face was still coated in the
semen he had ejaculated over her nose and lips once she was out cold.
Amusingly, she was younger than Wolfgang�s own daughter.

Sure, breast
augmentation techniques usually recommend an increase of one or, at most, two
bra cup sizes. However, he felt that the substantial silicone implants he had
utilized to endow the slim 21 year old with 40FF monsters would soon settle
down and cause no problems.

He admired the
neat 2-inch long incisions his scalpel had made in the underside crease of each
breast, now sutured with dissolvable stitches. Before the operation, the
measurement round her full breasts had been a measly couple of inches more than
the band measurement round her torso underneath her bust.

Now the
difference was a splendid 8 inches ! He smiled; �udders�.
The Americans had such a fixation with big udders.

The girl would
feel uncomfortable for a few days and her breasts would initially be tender,
swollen and unnaturally firm, but he was certain it would not take long for her
to recover fully from the physical effects of the operation.

Of course, the
mental effects might be another matter.

Lenny grinned.


This was all
too easy. Soon he�d be on a plane outta here and then
he could relax and enjoy the charms of the two Cumber girls.

And he�d be a
multi-millionaire. Aged just thirty.

He�d give John
Cumber specific instructions how to wire the money via the internet into the
master account.

It was an
innocent, virgin, 8-digit numbered St. Vincent bank account that would
automatically close as soon as it had received and instantaneously passed on
the billion dollars.

It would split
the money into ten tranches and transfer them to ten
numbered bank accounts in various places including the Cayman Islands, Costa
Rica, Anguilla, Turks and Caicos,
Panama and Belize.

In turn, those
accounts would split the money into different, smaller amounts and send it
across the water to the likes of Jersey, Liechtenstein, the Isle of Man,
Gibraltar, Cyprus and Andorra.

They would
repackage it up into altered amounts again and transfer it to accounts in Macau, Marianas, Vanuatu, Nauru, Labuan and Liberia.

Then the whole
lot would go berserk, batching, slicing, exchanging, splitting and regrouping
the money into and out of several hundred anonymous accounts around the world.
Some of the accounts had been opened a long time and operated innocently for
years, so they wouldn�t attract anybody�s attention.

Years of planning.

By the time
the whole steaming bowl of financial spaghetti had been served and covered with
a sauce of dummy accounts, closed accounts, transfers, reverse transfers,
conversion into Euros, Yen, Sterling and Swiss Francs, and a few laundering
tricks that only the very best people knew, the billion dollars ransom would be
as shiny as a new pin.

Much of it residing, like some fat cat tax exile, in
oh-so-respectable Switzerland.

It was only
fair.

His inheritance.

PART SIX

�Six-Chambered
Heart�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

�One
for the love, Two for the hate

Three
for the blood that I can�t circulate

Four
for the fear, Five for the brave

Six,
chamber six contains an open space�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Melanie had
fought.

It was
strange. From pre-puberty, her darkest, secret, unspoken sexual fantasies had
been about control and rape and �bdsm�, not that she
knew the term back then if it even existed. She had been too ashamed to reveal
such thoughts to Charlie but she�d figured she finally do so once they were
married. In them she had sometimes been the aggressor and other times the
victim.

Reality was
totally different.

Her karma.

He wasn�t like
a rapist of her imagination. He was calm, almost disinterested, pretty much
jacking off inside her. He simply held her wrists on the ground and writhed
about on top, his erection hard and painful within her unwilling flesh.

When he
flooded her he had given her an almost quizzical look as if he couldn�t
understand why on earth she might object to him using her. Him.
John fucking Cumber, the college stud and every girl�s dream.

Afterwards he
had been embarrassed but not repentant. He made her rinse herself in the lake,
destroying the evidence. Smiling, he threatened to tell her boyfriend that she
had been willing participant, that she had loved it.

Perhaps he
really even thought she had ?

�And if
Charlie comes after me,� he said, nonchalantly tucking his shirt back in, �I
will kill him. Trust me.�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

John Cumber
sat staring at the screens. Alongside him Walt Furness,
two other Agents, plus several investment bankers and John�s senior executives
were all watching the Corporations� share price tick up and down around the $15
dollars level.

Silence
chilled the room as John�s phone rang.

The cell�s
digital display was blank again.

�Yes.� He answered, all eyes on him. One of the Agents triggered the
tracking technology that had been set up.

�John.� Said the smooth, taunting male voice. Already experts had
identified it from the earlier tape as definitely an American national, accent
most likely Southern Californian, the inflexion and vocabulary estimated at
mid-thirties or under.

�Yes.�

�I will say
this once. You have ten minutes and I want to see one billion dollars in the
following bank account.�

The voice gave
the name of a bank on the Caribbean island of St. Vincent. The number of the
8-digit account was the same as that day�s date in American format: May 28th,
2007.

0-5-2-8-2-0-0-7.

�If it doesn�t
arrive, John, we will never speak again. Gotta go.�

�Wait !�

There was a
calm pause. �Yes ?�

�What about my
family ? My children ? And my
wife ? How do I know you�ll free them once I�ve paid
you the money.�

There was a
chuckle. �You don�t.�

�But you have
to give me some �� John Cumber clenched his fists, losing it in
exasperation and rage. Walt Furness reached out for
the phone but John flapped his hand away.

�Come on,
John.� The voice said, a sudden coldness entering his tone. �You�ll love it.
Trust me.�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Charlie sat
hunched over the screen reading the story. It was good. Well written, at least
in his opinion. Sure it was violent and explicit but then, that was what this
porno site seemed to be all about.

He clicked
again and returned to the Author�s page.

�Famous Blue Raincoat�.

There were ten
stories listed in all. The one he had just finished was his favourite so far.
He liked the title.

�Two out of
three ain�t bad.�

Set in 1849, a
brave Californian Gold Rush heroine had been raped and lost her husband,
friends and wagon train to Red Indian raiders but she managed to save herself
and her son.

The website
offered a facility that allowed you to email the author.

With a deep
breath, �Red Mist� started tapping at his keyboard.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Susan knelt
and licked the woman�s labia. They hung open, unwashed, sweaty, giving off an
odour like a dish of stinking fish and ripe cheese.

Whatever it
was that motivated these people it wasn�t just money. It couldn�t be. It
wasn�t even just sex. It was something else. Something
that made them want every moment, every act, to be as awful as it could be.

The woman
could easily have washed, showered, even just wiped herself. But she has chosen
not to, and Susan thought that had to be calculated.

Bile rose up
from her stomach to tear at her throat and she gulped the acid back down. There
were just the two of them now, outdoors on a private terrace in the sunshine.

She felt sharp
nails digging into her scalp, guiding her head.

�Lick, bitch. Make it good for me or
I�ll cut off your little boy�s bollocks and feed them to you.�

Susan swirled
her tongue and then drilled it, pointed, as deep as she could. She considered
lesbianism disgusting, immoral. A sheen of fresh
perspiration covered the woman�s inner thighs, making them slick and wet
against Susan�s cheeks. She guessed the woman was between forty five and fifty.
In quite good shape, probably fitness trained by the men. Nevertheless,
strangely she seemed to be in charge, along with the horrible man they referred
to as the Chameleon.

Her knees
throbbed and her ankles ached from kneeling in the same position for so long.
Her mind was delirious with fatigue and hunger and shame and worry, her tongue
was numb. She had been doing this for half an hour since breakfast, but the
woman seemed in no rush to reach a climax.

She winced as
the woman ran her long fingernails through Susan�s hair.

How much
more of this could she take ?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Charlie licked
his dry lips.

You have
one new message.

He clicked it
open.

&nbsp;

�Dear Red
Mist,

Thanks for
your email. It�s always nice for authors to receive feedback like yours. I�m
glad you enjoyed �Two out of Three Ain�t Bad� in particular. I don�t know your age but that was the
title of a song by Meatloaf when I was younger. In fact the whole story is kind
of based around what I feel about that era. The Seventies.
Anyway, feel free to email me direct if you have any more comments or ideas.

Famous Blue Raincoat.�

&nbsp;

Charlie
cracked a beer and began his response to her.

They exchanged
emails, to and fro, for several weeks. Gradually it ceased being an impersonal
dialogue and became correspondence between friends, even though they were two
faceless persons either side of a screen.

At least,
that�s how it seemed.

&nbsp;

One morning,
he awoke and fired up his PC. It was dawn in Europe. She had sent her reply from
California long after he turned in for the night.

&nbsp;

�Dear Red
Mist,

Thanks for
your last email. You�re correct, I do write from the heart. I have recently
been working on a new story. It�s called �Sow the Wind, Reap the Whirlwind.�
That�s based on a line from the Old Testament in the Bible. It�s kind of
inspired by something that happened to me many years ago. Not that �inspired�
is really the right word. I�m over it now, pretty much. But it still hurts coz
it screwed up my life. So I write to get help get it out of my system. Anyway, gotta go. Write again soon.

Yours, FBR.�

&nbsp;

Sow the
wind, reap the whirlwind !

Charlie
felt goose pimples up his spine as he started typing.

That evening,
he received her reply.

&nbsp;

�Dear RM,

Wow ! This is all pretty intense. I�ve
never told anybody any of this stuff before. Somehow it feels easier the fact I
don�t know you. You�re my anonymous, unpaid psychiatrist !
How�s that feel ? Cheap, heh ? LOL.
Anyway, you asked for it. The truth behind much of my writing is that I was raped.
Many years ago now ��

&nbsp;

The hairs
on the back of Charlie�s hands stood bolt upright.

&nbsp;

�The rape
itself was bad enough, but the consequences were worse. I lost the love of my
life. I couldn�t tell him I�d been raped. Well, could I have done
? I don�t know now. What�s done is done. You can�t wind the clock back.
My boyfriend had this dangerous streak below the surface. Besides, the guy who
raped me threatened he�d kill my boyfriend if I told anyone. But my boyfriend
could tell something was up. So I stupidly admitted I�d had this one night
stand. I thought he�d understand. I was young and na�ve. So we broke up. And
he�s never spoken to me again. I could forget the rape now, almost, but I can�t
because I�m still living with its consequences every day. My heart contains
this open space for him that has never been filled. I bet you�re sorry you
asked now. Sob stories ain�t so much fun as bdsm stories, right ? Must cut it short. My son�s home from
school early. I hope to hear from you again soon.

FBR.�

&nbsp;

For the first
time, Charlie didn�t start typing immediately. He sat, staring at the screen
for maybe an hour, he wasn�t sure. Time stopped. Eventually, he undressed,
wearily removing each item of clothing in a daze, and stood under a cold shower
for ten minutes. The razor needles of freezing water cut into his scarred,
muscled skin like shards of ice, dulling his brain yet sharpening his senses to
fever pitch.

He had always
loved soaking in hot baths after a battle, steaming away his aches and pains,
washing away the blood.

But showers he
best enjoyed cold. Hurting, setting his own blood
racing.

Preparing him for war.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

He ran his
fingers through his hair.

He was poorer
by one billion dollars. Repeat that: US$ 1,000,000,000. That�s one fuckin� thousand fuckin� million
green ones.

Walt Furness put his hand down on John�s shoulder. There were
now just the two of them in the room.

�John.� Walt
said. �We have confirmation. The money�s arrived. As I suspected, formally the
bank is refusing us access but they have confirmed - off the record - the
account is already empty again.�

John shrugged.
Trust me, the voice had said.

�I�ve put some
good guys on it.� Walt continued. �The best. But I�m
afraid the chance of us tracing it through the maze is pretty much zero. I
don�t know who this guy is but I know two things. One, he�s
not alone. And two, whoever they are, they know what they�re
doing.�

He looked up
at Walt and gave him a silent nod of agreement.

�John ?� Walt said, his tone changing. �John, I gotta ask. Do you recall what the guy said at the end of
the call ?�

He sighed. The words hung in the air
between them.

Sure he remembered.

Walt looked him firmly in the eyes.

�He said; come on John. You�ll love it.
Trust me.�

John tried to meet his gaze.

�You have any
idea what he meant, John ? �You�ll love it�. That�s
kind of a strange thing for somebody to say. You have any idea at all what that
means ?�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

�Trust me.� Said Gator, brandishing his machine pistol. �We know how to
use these things. And these too.� He gestured to his
belt where a machete hung menacingly in a leather scabbard.

Around the
swimming pool, they had painted five sets of feet in pink paint. Like the Pink
Panther�s footprints ! The rule was that each of the
five �guests� had to stand on a designated pair of footprints and not leave
them.

�Step off the
prints,� Gator threatened, pointing at a bamboo crop, �and the person next to
you gets fifty lashes with that.�

They were
arranged with Susan Cumber at the head of the pool. Her breasts hung heavy with
blotches and her pubic mound was bald.

Next to her, on one side of the pool stood her olive complexioned,
brunette, elder daughter Lorna.

About twenty
feet along was Lorna�s pallid, redheaded fianc� Gene.

At the shallow
end of the rectangular pool was a viewing gallery of seats, occupied by most of
the mercenaries, dressed in their usual mix of combat shirts and khaki shorts,
ripped Ts and leathers.

Next, opposite Gene, stood naked Ryan Cumber, tall, handsome son and
heir.

Finally,
opposite Lorna and next to their mother was blonde, top-heavy, younger daughter
Rachel. Her new, mammoth mammaries had triggered
shocked gasps from her family and raucous jeers from the male audience.

All five
prisoners were nude, bodies glistening in the hot sun, feet wide apart on the
pink prints, arms up, with their fingers laced behind their heads.

The time
for cuffs, ropes, cells and privacy was over.

�Silence.� Gator bellowed. �For your
host please � the Chameleon !�

It was
numbingly hot under the mask, but Charlie wore it for effect, for a sense of
drama. Not all five guests had seen his face yet.

He stood at
the shallow end of the pool, directly opposite Susan.

�Well, folks,
I have some good news, and some bad news.�

He did his
best to convey a smile by cocking his masked head to one side.

�Let�s get the
bad news out of the way first, shall we ? I�m afraid
that your beloved husband and father, John Cumber, has failed to come up with
our money ��

�No !� Lorna gasped, moving both hands to cover her face.

Charlie paused
threateningly for effect until the girl had snapped her hands back behind her
head.

�You will be
punished for that interruption shortly. As will anybody else who moves, speaks
or utters any noise out of turn. Nod if you all understand ?�

Five heads bobbed
up and down.

�As I was
saying, John Cumber has failed to pay your ransom. He�s asked for more time
which I have been gracious enough to grant him.�

He halted
briefly again, giving them time to appreciate his generosity.

�So, now the good news. He has offered
Susan to me as � er � interest on the money in the
meantime.�

It was evident
that young Ryan in particular was desperate to object but the boy managed to
control himself, staring across enraged, mouth agape.

�Listen.�
Charlie said.

There was a
slight crackle from two outdoor speakers fixed on the wall.

�No ! Wait !� John Cumber�s recorded voice floated
clearly over the pool water as if he was actually there with all of them.

�Gotta go. Catch you later.� A male voice replied
over the speakers.

�Please � f
� please � fuck � my wife.� John Cumber pleaded.

The tape
excerpt finished almost as soon as it had begun.

The Chameleon
opened his palms to imply �I told you so�.

�But I
understand that Susan has something to add that will help keep all my friends patient too.� He turned and gestured to the
grinning, watching Reptiles. �Isn�t that correct, Susie doll
?�

Susan Cumber
grimaced and nodded her head, lip quivering.

�What is it, Susie ? Out with it.�

�Please � f � please
� fuck my daughters too.� She pleaded, then burst into tears.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

�Dear Red
Mist,

You asked
about my son. He�s really the crux of the story. He was born nine months after
the rape. I couldn�t take the pill and my boyfriend and I had always used
rubbers or him just pulling out. Remember this was the Seventies. The rapist
made me wash the evidence in a scummy lake afterwards and I assumed I�d got rid
of everything. But a couple of months later, I�m definitely pregnant. So I�m
back home, not yet 19 years old, knocked up, with a rapist�s kid in my belly
when everybody thought I�d had a one-night-stand. Fucked, or what ? My parents wouldn�t consider an abortion, so I
had my son.

And here the
story gets even more twisted. After he�s born, I love him of course, but I
still think his father raped me. But when he�s six months old, I see a smile, a
distinctive look. I only had a few mementos of my boyfriend. One was a lock of
his hair, entwined with a strand of mine, that I kept
in a little silver box. Back then DNA testing was less advanced and available
but I lied about a possible genetic illness and the hospital had my son
analysed.

Guess what ?�

&nbsp;

The words
blurred on the screen as Charlie Victor wiped his eye.

&nbsp;

�My son is
after all my boyfriend�s child. From probably the very last time we ever made
love. And yet his father doesn�t know it. Never will. And so my son doesn�t
have his father, and the love of my life doesn�t know he has a son. All because
a bastard raped me, when he could have fucked pretty much any other chick and
she wouldn�t have minded. Sick, huh ?

But you know
the final twist ? The sickest part of all ? That boy who raped me ? He�s
turned into some hugely successful guy, rich and famous, and every few weeks I
glance by mistake at the newspaper headlines in a drug store, or catch the news
on TV, and there I see his damned face grinning out at me, like it did the
night he ruined my life.

And you know what, it makes me want to ruin his. Forgive me, but it
really does. So, because of course I sadly can�t do that in real life, I�m writing
about it instead.

And that, Red
Mist, is my story.�

&nbsp;

***
*** ***

&nbsp;

Before long,
the poolside orgy was in full swing.

The
mercenaries smoked, swigged bottles of chilled beer
and basked in the hot sunshine, watching the three tableaux. Music blared out
from the speakers; appropriately Jeff Booze�s �Carving my Name in the Sun�
album.

&nbsp;

One tableau
featured the homosexual coupling of Gene and Ryan.

Eel, one of
the Reptiles, was directing proceedings for the camera. Ryan had reluctantly
sucked his �brother-in-law-to-be� to erection and he was now on all fours on a
sun bed, grimacing as Gene sawed his penis into and out of his sweating, oiled
and virgin anus.

Eel gave them
the script under the prompting of his cattle prod.

�Oh yeah !� Ryan gasped. �Man that�s good Gene. Fuck my ass.�

�Gonna give it to you good, butt loving bro.� Gene grunted cornily.

&nbsp;

The second
scene starred Susan Cumber in a solo performance.

Alone with a huge, green, glistening cucumber.

She was lying
back on a sun bed, her legs as splayed as she could get them, ramming the
vegetable dildo to and fro inside her bald cunt.

Two cameras
were on her; one close up on her face, the other between her thighs,
its microphone picking up every slosh and slush as it disappeared inside her
then emerged, distorting her wet labia.

�My name is
Susan Cumber and I love a cucumber.� She chanted.

&nbsp;

The final
coupling was an incestuous lesbian 69 by Lorna and Rachel.

The two naked
chicks were lying on a double sun bed, with the elder girl below and her
younger sister�s pussy riding her face. Rachel was grinding her hips up and
down while she knelt forward and buried her lips in the �v� of Lorna�s thighs.
Rachel�s pendulous FF-cup tits hung down like bruised tropical fruit, now
totally out of proportion with her slim frame. But Lorna was reaching up
fondling them, while both girls moaned ecstatically.

�Mmm � make me come, Sis�, pleass
��

Another pair
of cameras recorded their action in great detail. A third lens was set up
further away on a tripod to get a long shot of the two girls enjoying
cunnilingus in the foreground, while their mum frigged herself with a foot long
cucumber just behind them.

&nbsp;

***
*** ***

&nbsp;

Completely
unaware of what was happening several thousand miles east at that precise
moment, John Cumber�s shoulders sagged.

Trust me,
the voice had said.

�Walt. That
list of people I gave you. My possible enemies.�

The grizzled
Agent looked at him expectantly.

�I have one
more idea.� John continued. �A long shot. But there was a woman. Well a girl.
Her name was � is � as far as I know � Melanie � Jones, I think.�

�Yeah ?� Walt replied, after a silence.

�It�s
something that happened a long time ago. I�m kind of ashamed now. I was young.
But I said those exact words to her; You�ll love it,
trust me.�

�You sure ?�

�Sure as I am
sat here now. I can remember saying them.�

�And ? The caller was a guy.�

�She had a
boyfriend. Charlie something. I forget what. We were
all at college together. Like I said, a long shot. But I thought I should
mention it.�

Walt nodded. �This Melanie � Jones, you think. You any idea where she
lives now ?�

John shook his
head. �None at all. But I think her family lived in
California. Some suburb of L.A.�

Walt looked
coldly at him. The regret and guilt in John�s eyes was unavoidable.

�You�ll love
it, trust me.�

Uneasily, the
two men shifted apart from each other.

�I�ll get onto
it right away.�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The five
victims were kneeling in a line on the pool deck eating �lunch�.

They were down
on all fours in front of a piece of plastic guttering that had been set up on
brick piers to make a trough.

Even though
all five were starving, none of them would have chosen to eat the swill that
had been set before them, but several of the mercenaries sidled up and down the
line, armed with electric cattle prods and leather riding crops to force them
to guzzle it all down �hands-free�, using just their mouths, faces like swine
in the trough.

The sickening
stench of the swill in the midday heat, swarming with flies, was overpowering.
The Bedouin tribesmen who roam the huge, barren landscape are infamous for
wasting nothing in the harsh environment. The basic ingredient of the mix was
goat�s intestine. It had been boiled to cleanse it then lightly fried in a
batter of blood and giblets and guts.

The final garnish
was supplied direct from a couple of the mercenaries. They jacked themselves
off and spewed copious lines of jizz over the
contents of the trough while the victims knelt and patiently watched their meal
being served.

�Eat up
Susie.� Gator now cooed, crouching behind her.

He watched her
bow her head, slurping up an unwanted mouthful.

�Goooood.�
He enthused. His calloused hands reached under her, fondling her big hanging
tits while he lined his dick up.

�Mmmm.� He
exhaled, pushing himself into her moist cunt from behind.

Susan kept
chewing as her gagging face was pushed into the mix.

Either side of
Susan, her two daughters glanced uneasily out of the corners of their eyes as
Gator began plunging in and out of their mom.

�Eat up,
little Susie, eat up little Susie.� He hummed to the rhythm of an old song,
gripping her hair and shoving her head down hard.

Following his
example, Gecko and Skink, two other mercenaries got down behind Lorna and
Rachel and mounted them.

�Aaa �� Rachel squealed as her sore, inexperienced cunt was
rammed.

�Man that�s
tight pussy.� Skink, a muscular black man exclaimed in appreciation, sinking
himself into the young blonde ex-socialite, cupping her huge breasts in his
palms and bouncing them like basketballs.

Viper stood
the other side of the gutter and unzipped himself. He was holding a can of beer
in one hand and a burning cigarette in the other.

�Excuse me
lads.� He said, laying down the can and fishing his penis out. �A bit more gravy ?� A stream of lager-fuelled urine jetted into the
gutter, refuelling the slops of offal and brown sauce.

As he
finished, Rachel Cumber let rip a choking gutteral
sound and spewed up a geyser of green-brown vomit that steamed into the
mixture.

�Aw, fuck !� Gator, Gecko and Skink exclaimed in unison.

The prisoners
all stopped eating and stared from one to the other then up at Viper. Drool
hung from Rachel�s lips and she almost heaved again.

Chuckling,
Viper flicked his cigarette ash onto it and then began stirring the whole lot
up with his machete in front of the five horrified faces.

�Hurry up and
finish eating.� He sneered coldly down at them. �Or I can feel a dump coming on !�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Inside the
chilled, air-conditioned bedroom suite overlooking the swimming pool, Charlie
turned from the window, sat down at his PC and chuckled.

What a
bunch, he thought.

He had invited
some online buddies to a web cam broadcast of Rachel�s next ordeal. The young
lady had some catching up to do with her mom and sister. What better way to
enjoy the fun than by getting some ideas for the next part of her training ? He tapped hurriedly onto the keyboard.

Ladies and
Gentlemen, may I have your suggestions please ?

PART SEVEN

�Reptile�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

�She
spread herself wide open to let the insects in

She
leaves a trail of honey to show me where she�s been

She
has the blood of reptile just underneath her skin

Seeds
from a thousand others drip down from within.�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The Lonely Man
licked his lips with anticipation.

He was sat
alone in his dark one room apartment in a small, Midwestern town. His table was
littered with the detritus of his solitary life; spent cartons of old takeaway
meals and delivery pizzas, unwashed plates and overflowing ashtrays, empty cans
and scrunched up tissues. The blinds were down and the air in the room hung
heavy with the reek of musty carpets, stale tobacco smoke and body odour.

But, to hand,
he had a nice new chilled six-pack of beer, two packets of cigarettes still in
their cellophane, and a warm burger in a bag.

In the centre
of it all stood his pride and joy; a 22-inch wide screen monitor hooked up to
the PC below the table.

He logged onto
a new site he had been introduced to. He tapped out his moniker and lit up a
cig while he waited for approval.

A minute later
the message �Welcome Lonely Man� appeared.

It was
followed by an empty Password box.

He entered his
security pass and waited thirty seconds or so.

Finally, he
was in.

He could see
there were already twelve of them online. All his favourite
people in the world; Mengele, Yakuza, Nine
Inch Nail, Hoffman, Bondage 666 and others.

The words �Hi
lonely.� appeared.

�Hi guys.� He
typed, exhaling a ring of cigarette smoke, watching his response emerge along
the bottom of the screen.

He pulled out
a tissue and wiped his sweating forehead. Then, slowly, almost reverently, he
lifted up his other pride and joy. It was a plastic mouth that he lowered
carefully onto his dick. It was a top of the range, battery-powered blowjob
device. As soon as he flicked the power control, his darling �girl who never
said no� would start licking and sucking him to heaven.

The screen
flickered and a new name was online: the most important one of all.

�Hi Red Mist.� He rushed to type on
everybody�s behalf.

�Hi guys.� 

Then he could
see that the screen had switched to web cam mode. The site was broadcasting. A
real voice repeated the typed words.

�Hi guys.�

The speaker
used a voice distortion box but the words were easy to understand; deep,
asthmatic, electronic, like Darth Vader from Star
Wars.

�Welcome
friends. Are you ready for some action tonight ?�

Whimpering
with excitement, the Lonely Man slid the power control of his plastic girl on
at its lowest setting. It hummed softly round his dick. How did it compare with
the real thing ? The Lonely Man didn�t know and didn�t
care. This was without doubt the best sex he could imagine.

On the screen,
a camera panned over the naked female body. She was strung out along a medieval
style rack, her arms and legs outstretched, connected
to wooden axles that could be turned further and tightened.

Her pale flesh
glowed with perspiration, her muscles taught with apprehension, her head almost
totally covered in a black leather hood. She was naked but for the hood and a
shiny black bikini and thong.

From the top
of the hood a blonde ponytail emerged, plaited into a guiding leash. And from
the mouth slit, a cruel steel �spider gag� forced her red glossed lips wide
open, revealing her pearly white teeth and pink tongue.

What a
twisted bitch, volunteering for this. He wondered vaguely what she looked like.
It was hard to imagine she could actually be as hot as the visible parts
suggested. He�d wager her actual face underneath was chanky.

He whimpered
again, staring at the girl�s taut ribcage and humongous cleavage in the leather
bikini. Slowly a black-gloved hand appeared from out of shot and cranked the
top axle a few degrees, making the rack creak and her stretched mouth gasp.

�So, are we
all ready ?� The distorted voice asked. �I would like
to remind you that our friend here stated there should be no limits and she
asked that you all be as imaginative as possible.�

The Lonely Man
slid his power control down a notch and moaned; not yet, please, not yet.

�May I have
the first suggestion please.�

&nbsp;

***
*** ***

&nbsp;

Rachel tried
to scream again but the gag reduced her howl to a saliva-choked gurgle.

�That�s a fun
idea.� The electronic baritone echoed above her hood.

Her muscles
burned as she tried to spread her thighs and thrust her hips upwards to ease
the angle for the clenched fist as it wormed its way inside her.

And then she
felt a searing agony the like of which she�d never even dreamed of. It was like
fire, tearing, ripping, cooking her vagina.

She heard
disembodied laughter from the audience over the speakers. She couldn�t see
through her claustrophobic hood but she knew people were watching over some
kind of computer link-up.

�Now her ass !� an excited voice urgently beseeched.

She quivered
helplessly on the rack as she felt a thick digit invading her bottom and in
seconds a terrible flamethrower of agony gutted her rectum. Again she tried to
scream but to no avail.

Cue more
uproarious laughter.

�A five minute
break, gentlemen.� Said the man in the room with her.
�And then the insects will be served !�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Charlie
surveyed the house from his hired Chevy through military issue binoculars. It
was a sultry, red-skied evening; Friday, 31st March 1995. He could
see her through the window. She was almost 37 now and yet she still looked so
much like the 18 year old girl he�d first set eyes on half their lifetimes ago.
Boy, how much he�d loved her then. And how much he�d hated
her after.

And now ?

Now that he
knew the truth ?

He realised his
hands were bending the steering wheel. Truth was, he loved her, always had and
always would. Proportion, like many things, had never been his strong point. He
had punished her unduly. And punished himself unduly.
And yet the only person who should be punished was �

Well, that
could wait a while. One-two-three-breathe.

Truth was he
had never married and had never loved anybody else. Nor had she.

And above all,
he had punished his Son. The Son he didn�t know. The Son who
didn�t know his father. The Son she had named after their favourite
singer-songwriter. The poet whose music they first made love to.

Leonard Cohen.

And the Son who would celebrate his 18th Birthday the
very next day.

Slowly,
Charlie climbed out of the Chevy, locked it and started towards the house.

He had spent
almost twenty years engaged in some of the most terrifying warfare and ruthless
hand-to-hand combat in global history. Not once had anything frightened him. He
had always laughed in the face of danger.

After all,
he never had anything to lose.

And he
wondered what his Lover and Son would say when he appeared at their door after
all this time.

Would Famous
Blue Raincoat take Red Mist back ?

Or would he
lose his Family forever ?

Suddenly,
without any warning, Charles Victor felt real fear.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

It was a
modest 1960s timber house on the lower slopes of the Hollywood Hills, ten
minutes from Sunset.

The combined
FBI and LAPD team surrounded the house and yard and then the lead agents bust
in the front and back doors simultaneously.

The place was
registered to Ms. Melanie Jones and locals confirmed that she had lived there
alone with her son for twenty plus years.

Five minutes
after the forced entry, it was apparent that neither Ms. Jones nor her son was
in. Furthermore, neither had been home in quite a while.

Over the
following 24 hours, it was to become apparent that the place had been
�cleansed� by total professionals. There was nothing left to indicate anything
personal about the people who had lived there; no clothes, no books, no PC, no
music, no papers, no tins of food, no cans of drink.

�Walt.� Said the West Coast Head to his boss back east.

�It�s like a
show home. Just basic furniture. Table,
chairs, sofa, bed without sheets. Not new. Used, but
totally clean. Like nobody ever lived here yet.�

�Well dust the
damned place again.� Walt Furness replied,
exasperated.

�That�s it,
Sir. We have. Twice. And we haven�t found a single
print or hair.�

There was a
silence.

�But there�s a
note. It was found glued to the underside of the kitchen table. Typed. No prints on the sheet of paper. Just eight words in
large font.�

�What did it say ?�

�The trail
stops here. Trust us. The Chameleon.�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Susan Cumber
knelt while the collar was sealed round her neck.

The woman she
had come to know as her Nemesis smiled.

�There we are.
Now we don�t have to worry about chains and ropes and all that stuff. Look !�

Susan choked,
unable to breathe, as an electric current coursed from the top of her spine
down her nervous system to her feet. She fell forwards
face first onto the floor, trying but failing to scream.

�If you take
one step outside this compound, that�s what will happen. Get up
!�

Slowly, Susan
struggled back onto her knees, gagging.

�Pl � zzz �� she groaned. �No m � more. My husband w � will get
you your money, I promise.�

The woman
laughed, tucking the controller for the electric tag collar into her belt.

�Oh yes. I
forgot. Thanks. The money arrived safe and sound some time ago. We�re all
multimillionaires.�

Susan shook
her head, struggling to hear and comprehend.

�Wha � ?�

�Yes, good old
John. He�s done his part. Now you just have to complete your part of the deal.�

My part ? Surely �

�I don�t un � understand ��

The woman
smiled like a mother explaining homework to her kid.

�Look. Your husband
had to pay to buy you all the opportunity to earn your freedom. But now
he�s done that, you still have to do your bit.�
�Wh � what do we have to do ?�

�Well, we�re
going to be here for a while. You see the money is a bit hot so we have to wait
for it to chill.� The woman reached and lifted Susan�s chin with her fingers so
that both of them were looking into the other�s eyes. �You see, even money is
best enjoyed cold.�

�H � how long ?� Susan gasped.

The woman
shrugged. �I�m not sure. A year or so. Maybe a bit longer.�

Unable to stop
herself, Susan wailed. �Noooooo � nooooooo !�

A short,
milder shock soon brought her under control.

�I must warn
you that outbursts like that will only extend your sentence. You have just
added one whole month to your thirteen months stay. �

Completely
defeated, Susan simply hung her head like a punch drunk boxer. Be strong ! Be strong for Rachel, Lorna, Ryan.
And John.

�Good.� Her
Nemesis said. �Now, a few new rules. While here, you
will make yourself useful. You will work 18/7. That�s eighteen hours a day,
seven days a week. Your duties will include anything and everything, from
domestic chores, to performing massages to � naturally � any sexual demands
that are required. Is that understood ?�

Susan merely
stared at her, mouth frozen slightly open.

�Is that understood ?�

Her hand shot
up to her cheek to caress where she had been slapped.

�Y � yes.�

�And when I
say any sexual demands, I mean �any�.�

The woman
waited, clearly expecting a response.

Susan bobbed
her head slowly up and down.

�Yes � any.�
She mumbled.

�Well, that�s
all clear then. Let�s go put you straight to work.�

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

There was
excitement in the room at last !

After days of
no progress, the investigation finally had something to go on.

Eighty agents
and officers were being addressed by Walt Furness.

�Leonard
Jones.�

He pointed at
an image of a man wearing a Fedex uniform, looking
straight into the lens of what was clearly an office lobby CCTV and sticking
his long, lizard-like tongue out. The man was grey haired, clean shaven and he
appeared to be middle aged, maybe mid to late forties.

Walt Furness pressed a button and produced a new slide. It
showed a different, younger, clean cut, quite handsome youth of around thirty.

�Leonard
Jones.� Walt repeated with irony. �Same guy, different
appearance. Ladies and gents, we are dealing with a master of disguise. Or to use his chosen handle, a Chameleon.�

There was the
sound of shuffling, murmurs, sideways glances.

�And Homeland
Security has reason to believe he is currently still residing within the United
States.�

&nbsp;

***
*** ***

&nbsp;

Six of the
reptiles were playing poker in the shade; Gator, the man with the missing ear,
Cobra, the huge black man with the shaved head, Gecko, the heavily tattooed
Russian, and three others.

The atmosphere
was intense. Large piles of chips were stacked in front of several players and
increasingly smaller ones belonged to the rest. It was evident that the
millions each man now possessed in his foreign bank accounts were being wagered
on No Limits Texas Hold�Em.

Skink, a
Nigerian mercenary, surveyed the table with a motionless, poker face.

�Raise.� He said, pushing several $10,000 chips forward.

Gator laughed.
�Gotcha !�

Skink froze,
then grinned and looked down between his thighs. Lorna Cumber�s
head was glued to his waist. Now that his side bet was lost, Skink relaxed and
forgot about trying to hide his orgasm from the table. He groaned and seized
the chica�s long hair, pumping her head up and down
on his dick.

�Blow her fuckin� head off, Skink.� Gecko encouraged.

�Man it�s
coming out her ears.�

Skink pulled
and twisted her hair so that her face appeared above the rim of the table, lips
closed tight, gulping his seed.

Everybody
laughed. Skink pushed a $10,000 chip over to Gator.

�Your turn, Gate. Now let�s see you
keep a straight face !�

He pushed
Lorna back under the table towards Gator�s seat.

�Get going
bitch � Now, I think I just raised you all.�

�

&nbsp;

The young FBI
agent was quivering with excitement.

�Sir.� He said, holding a printed
piece of paper out to Walt Furness and John Cumber.
�We have him.�

There it was. In black and white.

A reservation
had been made for a Mr. Len C. Jones on American Airlines, Flight 1385, from
New York to Bridgetown, Barbados. Departing JFK the next morning
at 09.55 hrs.

�The ticket
was purchased with cash from a midtown Manhattan travel agent two days ago.�

John Cumber
punched his right fist into his left palm and muttered �yessss�.

�It�s a single
ticket, Sir. One way.�

�Barbados ?� Walt mused, stroking his chin.

�The nearest international airport to St. Vincent, Sir.� 

�Where my fucking billion dollars was wired.�

The young
agent grinned at them both with a triumphant flourish.

�There�s more,
gentlemen. A small 4-seater jet has been chartered from SVG Airlines to fly
from Grantley Adams Airport, Bridgetown, Barbados to
E.T. Joshua Airport in Kingstown, St. Vincent, tomorrow
afternoon.�

He paused for
effect. �To fly a single passenger. Chartered
by a certain Lennie Jones.�

Walt looked at
the agent and then at John Cumber.

�Let�s go hunt
our reptile guys !�

&nbsp;

***
*** ***

&nbsp;

Susan stared
in horror.

�This is your
bathroom.� Melanie said, thrilled by the expression on Susan�s face. �Now that
y�all gonna be around for a while, you and your boys
will need somewhere to do your stuff.�

The squalid
room had not been touched in maybe thirty years. It was an ancient, open plan
washroom with two toilet pans, two stand up urinals,
two shower heads and two basins with unframed pieces of mirror above.
Everything was filthy, stained, rusted, cracked and decrepit. The overflowing
toilet pans had no seats or covers. The urinals and basins were yellowed by
years of dripping. The shower heads oozed slime.

The entire
concrete floor swam with liquid; water, or worse. Decades old cigarette butts,
scraps of newspaper, toilet roll and stinking mush had clogged the toilets and
urinals. Graffiti scrawled in excrement adorned the grungy walls.

�I�m going to
lock you in here ��

Susan turned
her face to look. �B � but ��

� � with one bucket, a rag and a
bottle of disinfectant. And I�m giving you two hours. When I come back, the
whole place had better be beautifully clean. Or else.�

&nbsp;

�Take the
strain.� Leatherback announced.

Several
mercenaries were watching and gambling on the �tug of war�.

�Heave�.

Ryan Cumber
and Gene Collins were connected by a length of cord tied tightly round the
shafts of their penises. The cords were a blend of nylon and wire, incredibly
strong, and they were coiled tight underneath the rim of each purple helmet to
prevent them slipping off. Each boy had been given Viagra
to help him maintain an erection through the pain.

�Aagh.�
They screeched and gasped in unison.

Croc and Boa
lashed crops against each lad�s defenceless body.

�Pull, you
fucker. My money�s riding on you.�

It was no
contest really. Ryan was six plus and muscled while Gene was five seven and
puny. But a couple of mercenaries were relying on Gene, if flogged
sufficiently, causing an upset at generous odds.

Oh well, it
seemed a harmless way of passing a sultry afternoon.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Lennie sat back in a First Class seat
for the first time in his life.

He admired the
blonde stewardess who served him a glass of champagne, as she leaned over to
ensure he got a nice view of her deep cleavage.

He felt a
twinge in his groin as he imagined reaching out and grabbing her tits. Like he would soon be able to do to those Cumber bitches.

Out through
the oval window by his side he could see frantic activity as the baggage
handlers and airline staff filled the plane with suitcases and fuel.

He felt no
emotion, no Star Spangled banner. It was goodbye and good luck as far as he was
concerned. God bless America but he doubted he would ever set foot on her rich
soil again.

Now he had
riches of his own.

A male steward
suddenly brandishing a clipboard gave him a shock.

He smiled down
at Lennie momentarily. Like he
fancied him.

�Monsieur
Kohn.� The steward said. �Bienvenue.�

Lennie peered back up at him through
his dark glasses and flashed his best white teeth smile. �Er
� Merci�.

�Vous etes Americain ?�

�Nao. Eu sou Brasileiro.� Lennie replied in his well-rehearsed Portuguese. Lennie�s temporary skin colour was mulatto and he had a
sharp goatee to compliment his wiry black hair. Every inch
a Brazilian. �But � er � I can speak a leedel English.�

The steward
gaily flipped into a mix of token Portuguese and flawless English himself.

�Bemvindo abordo,
Senor Kohn. Enjoy the flight.�

�Obrigado.�

�I will leave
you the menu and entertainment guide. If I can be of any assistance, please do
not hesitate to call me.�

Sixteen
minutes later, with typically Swiss precision, at exactly 19.55, the Airbus
A330-200 that was Swissair Flight 65 took off on time from Miami on its
overnight haul to Zurich.

&nbsp;

Around
fourteen hours later, at JFK New York, an American Airlines flight to Barbados
was delayed for several hours as Federal Agents checked out every single
passenger, searching for a Mr. Leonard Jones, without any success.

Walt Furness couldn�t help chewing bitterly on eight words:

The trail
stops here. Trust us. The Chameleon.

&nbsp;

***
*** ***

&nbsp;

Walt stood
jacketless, sleeves rolled up, in the same crammed meeting room, in front of
most of the same eighty agents, but this time there was no air of excitement.

The tang of sweaty armpits, certainly.

Grim determination for sure.

But mostly just resignation.

He projected
three mug-shot images onto the screen behind him.

To the left,
there was the same clean-cut, modestly handsome youth he had displayed before.

�Leonard
Charles Jones. Born Los Angeles, 1st April, 1977.�

To the right,
there was a nice looking woman. At first glance, she looked like a standard,
well preserved Californian soccer mom. The resemblance with her son was
striking, given their age and gender difference.

�Melanie
Jones. Born Orange County, 8th April 1958. Unmarried single mother of Leonard.�

And in the
middle, projected directly above where Walt stood, was one of the most
extraordinary faces most of the agents had ever seen. The masculine features
themselves were reasonably ordinary. Tough looking, strong
cheekbones and jaw, short military style haircut. He looked mid to late forties but was in superb physical condition.
Yet behind the features and within the narrowed eyes, there was something else
entirely.

Something
indescribable that made the little hairs of each member of the audience stand
on end.

�You are
looking at Charles Victor. Born Ontario County, New York
State, 14th February 1957 to an American father and an English
mother. Served nine years in the British Armed Forces and has since
worked around the world as a mercenary. Current whereabouts
unknown. We believe he may be the biological father of Leonard Jones.�

The silence in
the room was palpable, as if hearts had stopped beating. At second glance,
there was something about the mouths of the two men that was similar,
though far from obvious.

�Charles,
Melanie, Leonard.� He enunciated each name slowly.

Walt Furness picked up a marker pen and wrote on the white
board.

C � H � A

He turned
briefly to glance at his audience then carried on writing.

M � E � L

There were
murmurs.

L � E � O � N.

He calmly
placed the pen down and stared everybody hard in the eyes.

�Gentlemen,
ladies; The Chameleon !�

BEST ENJOYED COLD

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

PART EIGHT

�Karma
Chameleon�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

�Every
day is like survival,

you�re my lover not my rival.�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

John Cumber
sat slumped in a chair. He was barely surviving, a mere husk of the handsome,
6� 3� corporate titan he had been just a couple of weeks earlier. The sheer
horror of what had happened, the kidnap of his family, the images of his wife
posted on the internet, the loss of most of his fortune, his anger, exhaustion,
humiliation and impotence had sucked the life out of him, like all the juice
from a blood orange.

�So, Ellen.� He sighed. �It�s over ?�.

It was as
much statement as question.

The trading
screens and tickers lining the room confirmed that he had lost his battle to
keep the Cumber share price above $15. On top of the constant untraceable sell
orders and rumours out of Asia, had crashed a tsunami of hedge fund shorts and
investment bank re-ratings, overwhelming even his own and his allies�
substantial resources.

When the end
came, it was decisive. The price had plunged to under $11 and it was still in
freefall. 

Ellen O�Leary
wiped her eyes with a handkerchief and adjusted her half-moon glasses.

�It�s over,
John. The banks won�t lend you any more. A couple of them feel terrible but
they just can�t override their shareholders� interests.�

The main
Cumber Estate plus homes in the Hamptons and Aspen
had been mortgaged to the hilt. The jet, cars, art and antiques, even Susan�s
jewellery had already been put up as security.

�So how much
do I have left ?�

�Just the
Cumber stock and the bank won�t accept that now.�

�What�s its
market value ?�

�A little
under a billion dollars. At last night�s close.�

�So I�m still
a fucking billionaire.� He bellowed, hurling a pencil at the wall. �A useless
paper billionaire who can�t save his family !�

There was a
silence.

�Maybe they
will contact you soon. You held the price up as long as you could.� Ellen said.

It had been a
week since he had paid the ransom and four days since the failed attempted to
catch the villain on the flight to St. Vincent.

Not a word
in all that time. But they had said they would kill a member of his family for
each day the share price ended below 15 dollars.

In a little
over ten minutes, the share price would close at under 11.

&nbsp;

***
*** ***

&nbsp;

He snatched up
the phone, somehow knowing who it would be.

�Hi, John.�

�Yes ?� he
snapped.

�Oh dear. I�m
disappointed in you. What happened to our agreement ?�

�I have no
more money. You have cleaned me out.�

�Really ?� The
taunting voice seemed genuinely surprised. �I thought you would have lasted
longer than that.�

�I know who
you are.� He said. He could tell the caller�s voice was older, more
transatlantic. He was talking to the father, not the son.

�Do you now ?
Clever boy John, though I�m sure it was those Feds not you personally who
worked it out.�

�You bastard.�
He slammed the table. �How could you ?�

�You started
it, trust me.�

�Stop that
fucking trust me stuff. I don�t trust you at all.�

There was a
deathly hush. A five seconds pause.

�Hello ?� John
said.

�I�ve had
enough of your rudeness John. This will be our last conversation. It was � er � nice meeting up again. Briefly.�

�Wait !� He
exploded. �I�m sorry. I lost it. Pl � please ��

�But I can�t
talk more than a minute. Blame those snoopy agents of yours. You keep shouting
at me and so I never get the chance to say anything. Bye.�

�Look, please.
I�m sorry. Truly, truly sorry. Have m � mercy.�

�Aah. That�s better Johnny boy. Tell you what, I�ll call you
back once more. In a week or so.�

�Are my family
alright ? You must tell me that at least.�

�No. I don�t have
to tell you anything at all.�

The line went
dead.

He hoped it
was the only thing that had died.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Lennie awoke with sunshine filtering
through the blinds. Dust particles danced in the bright shafts of light and the
smell of citrus and coffee tickled his nostrils. He reached down under the
sheet and scratched his sweaty scrotum.

Rachel Cumber
lay with her back to him. He lay for a moment admiring the sensuous curvature
of her spine, her narrow waist and perfect buttocks. He smiled at the memory of
her anus tight round his dick last thing before he fell asleep the night
before.

�Wake !� he
said, slapping her bottom so a red mark appeared.

She snapped
alert, terrified, and dived her head under the sheet. In seconds, he felt her
soft, guzzling lips around his morning glory. Her huge boobs pressed down
against his legs like balloons.

He plonked his
head back on the pillow and shut his eyes. Then he pushed his arm out and
fumbled for the button by his bedside. He pushed.

No more than
three minutes later, there was a soft knock on the door.

Lennie peeked open his eyes and
grinned up at Lorna. She was carrying a tray with a pot of black coffee, frothy
hot milk, fruit juice and a pastry.

While she laid
it down on the table, he pushed back the sheet, revealing Rachel�s shoulders
and face worshipping his dick.

�Lick my butthole now.� He mumbled softly.

No need to
shout when they readily obeyed.

He winked at
Lorna. �You, take a turn on my dick.�

The two
sisters worked in tandem. They were coming along well. Now that six of the
mercenaries had taken off to Europe to visit a few banks, and the mom was doing
her best to cater to the guys who remained, Lennie
had the two girls to himself quite a lot of the time. As was his plan.

His own mom
and dad were still taking their turns occasionally but they were mainly
spending more time alone together, which was great.

He reached
down and pushed Lorna�s hair aside so he could watch her pretty mouth as she
slurped it up and down just as he liked it. Meanwhile, the tip of Rachel�s
little pink tongue was deep in his dark locker.

A cup of
coffee and his bowels would loosen up nicely.

He felt his
thighs tightening and his balls reaching the point of no return. First one of
the day was always thick, hot and plentiful. Like oatmeal.

�Don�t
swallow.� He murmured down to Lorna.

Her lips
encircled his shaft tightly as he pumped three, five, seven jets onto her
tongue. Her cheeks puffed and her doe-like hazel eyes stared up at him
intently.

He pulled
Rachel from his asshole and put their faces together.

�Okay, swap my
jizz, ladies. Each to the other and back as usual.�

He watched
them trade the pearly drool; drip and catch, catch and drip, brunette to blonde
and back again. They were starlets of the internet doing this although they
didn�t know it yet. There was nothing even the combined forces of John Cumber
and the Feds could do once those clips were circulating on the world wide web.
And inevitably even these chicks� supposed friends wouldn�t be able to
resist taking a surreptitious naughty peek at them in action !

&nbsp;

***
*** ***

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

It was 03.08
by the digital clock when the phone rang.

John Cumber
picked it up in the dark. There was a tiny echo.

�Oh dear,
John, I can hear those tracking people from here. Goodbye.�

&nbsp;

At breakfast,
two days later, the phone rang again. Walt Furness
had reluctantly agreed to pull most of the surveillance and monitoring in the
meantime.

�Morning
John.�

�Good
morning.� He said, as politely as he could muster.

�That�s
better. Call me Sir, will you. I prefer that.�

� � Okay �
Sir.�

�Better all
the time. We�re going get along fine after all.�

�Please � tell
me about my family � Sir.�

The Cumber
share price was limping along at the 9 dollars level and had now closed below
15 dollars four days in succession.

�They�re fine,
John. Susan�s here now actually, sucking me off.�

He ignored the
taunt, although he couldn�t prevent the obscene image of his wife and Charlie
Victor raping his mind.

�They�re all
alive ?�

�Of course.
That was only a joke about the share price. Gotcha, hah ?�

�I�ve paid you
the money.� John replied. �I�ve apologised. I�ve begged for mercy. Please free
them � Sir.�

�John, you
fucked our lives for twenty years, mate. You really think a couple of weeks is
all it takes to get even ?�

John Cumber
started to sob, his voice came out in a high squeak.

�Please ��

�Excellent
John. Real tears ! Now we�re getting somewhere.�

He couldn�t
speak, his throat and chest bawling.

�Okay John.
You just cry and listen. I read in the Wall Street Journal that you�ve still
got a fistful of Cumber stock. What I want you to do is give it away to
charity. The lot. Do something good with your life, John. Then maybe I�ll do
something good to you in return. Nice talking.�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Charlie smiled
as Melanie put her chin on his chest and looked up into his eyes. Her fingers
softly cradled his balls.

�Anything left
in here for me ?� she asked coquettishly.

�But of
course, my love.� He replied. �In just a sec.�

He turned up
the volume of the TV. It was tuned to CNN.

A female
reporter was standing on the main steps of the Cumber Corporation Headquarters.
Melanie twisted her head so she could enjoy the news too.

The report was
brief and to the point. Obviously in the days to come, numerous commentators
and analysts would rush to praise, criticise, explain, interpret and generally
spout unnecessary verbiage.

�So it has
been confirmed that John Cumber,� the identikit blonde reporter said, wrapping
her piece, �has amazed the world by giving what remains of his entire fortune
to five Foundations and Charities. He has retired as of today from corporate
and public life and announced that he plans to spend the rest of his years in
poverty, working unpaid in a not-for-profit organisation. This is Leonora
Carter for CNN.� 

&nbsp;

Charlie hit
the mute button and smirked over at Susan Cumber. She was kneeling on all fours
by his side of the bed, staring silently at the screen.

�He did it, eh
? Gave it all away. Must really love you.�

Melanie
chuckled. �I wonder what he�d say if he knew you�re having an affair with a
donkey.�

Susan didn�t
move or respond. A solitary tear rolled down her cheek.

Charlie pulled
Melanie�s face up to his and kissed her.

Mmm � he loved this woman,
kinky bitch as she undoubtedly was. He always thought of himself as the hard
one, but Mel had proved harder. It would still be a long time before Susan was
shown any mercy.

�Put on the
DVD.� She purred, turning her attention back to his genitals, running a teasing
finger up his veined, swelling shaft.

He pressed the
remote, switching from CNN to the DVD and pushed �Play�. Still Susan Cumber
didn�t react, despite what appeared on the screen. Her obedience training was
coming on apace.

The previous
evening had been the cruellest so far, culminating with the first bestial
session. He had once seen a whore in Mexico paid to have sex with a donkey. But
this Ethiopian ass they had purchased was a �donkey cock� of donkey cocks; and
the stubbornest, smelliest, ugliest and best endowed
brute that ever brayed.

Mel�s head lay
on Charlie�s stomach, tonguing his erection as she watched the screen. On it,
Susan was kneeling underneath the donkey, sobbing. The beast of burden was
clearly keen to shed its load ! Several jeering mercenaries were in the
background, holding it still.

Charlie
pressed the �volume� button louder.

The donkey�s
shaft was comparable to Charlie�s forearm. Hairier, sure, and maybe not quite
as thick around, but pretty similar. He watched the recording of Susan�s pink
tongue slurping over the glistening crown through her tears and grimaces.

�You�re going
to have to work on that technique.� He called down to her.

Mel�s teeth
nipped him gently.

�Not you !� he
laughed. �Her.�

He shut his
eyes, enjoying the feeling, listening to the loud playback of the excited ass
braying and the crescendo of excitement.

A few minutes
later, when Mel had sat astride Charlie, riding his dick, he peered around her
perspiring bouncing body at the screen.

Susan Cumber
was now strung into a hammock and she had been mounted by the donkey. Somehow
her increasingly slack pussy had managed to absorb its full length. In fact,
afterwards she had required a couple of stitches down below from Wolfgang
before the good doctor set off home to Switzerland.

The split
screen mode showed two views simultaneously; a side-on picture of the fucking
itself, and then a close up of her tormented face. He wondered how much was
pain and how much shame ?

An
interesting question. Maybe he would get Susan to write a coupla
thousand words essay on what it feels like to be fucked by an ass. They could
all then debate it with her and her kids, perhaps post their responses on the
net ?

He tore his
eyes away and smiled up at Mel, reaching to thumb her hard, excited nips,
knowing his woman was only seconds from her climax.

While Susan
Cumber still knelt motionless, listening to two people make passionate love and
staring at herself on the screen.

&nbsp;

***
*** ***

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

It was exactly
04.00 in the morning when John Cumber�s bedside phone
trilled. He picked up the handset and fumbled it to his ear.

Music was
playing down the line. A song. Vaguely familiar.

&nbsp;

�Ah, the
last time we saw you, you looked so much older

Your famous
blue raincoat was torn at the shoulder.

You�d been
to the station to meet every train

And you
came home without Lili Marlene.�

&nbsp;

He recognised
the singer; Leonard Cohen.

�Yes ?� he
muttered into the phone. �Hello ?�

There was no
response other than the continued playing of the song.

&nbsp;

�And you
treated my woman to a flake of your life

And when
she came back she was nobody�s wife.�

&nbsp;

He knew the
song now. From the early seventies; 71 or 72 maybe. It was called �Famous Blue
Raincoat� and it had been playing the evening he raped Melanie Jones.

John Cumber
wiped his moist eyes with the back of his hand in the dark.

&nbsp;

�Yes, and thanks,
for the trouble you took from her eyes

I thought
it was there for good so I never tried ��

&nbsp;

�John ?� a
male voice suddenly interrupted, as the music cut.

�You there ?�

He snapped out
of the reverie. �Yes � I�m here.�

�You listening
to the words, John ? You remember ?�

�I remember.�

�You treated
my woman to a flake of your life, John.�

�Ch � Chuck �
I�m terribly sorry. I was young � we were young ��

�And when
Melanie came back she was nobody�s wife.�

�I know.
Please � please tell Mel I�m desperately sorry too.�

�Tell her
yourself.�

There was a
pause. The rustle of a phone being passed.

�Hallo,
rapist.�

He didn�t even
recognise her voice but he knew it was her.

�Mel � I�m
sorry. Please. But spare Susan and my children. They had nothing to do with
it.�

There was
another, longer pause.

�You�re right,
John.� He heard her reply coldly. �It wasn�t their fault. But it is their
karma. And now their every day is like � survival.�

John screwed
his eyes shut and held his breath. He had to keep control.

�Please let
them survive.� He pleaded. �I�ve done everything you asked. Every last penny.
I�m a broken man. You�ve won.�

�To the
Victors the spoils, huh ?�

He stayed
silent. Not wanting to agree or disagree with her.

�You want a
choice, John ?�

� � Alright.�
He responded, uncertainly.

�Here it is.
You can either have all four kids back now and never see Susan
again. That�s Option One. Or you can have five back in one year�s time.
That�s Option Two.�

He felt his
heart beating like a hammer and struggled for breath.

�That�s the
deal. No fucking about this time. No �Trust Us� lies. We�ll keep our word. So,
it�s up to you, John. You�ve got ten seconds to make up your mind. Four now �
or five in a year�s time ? Option One or Option Two ?� Her voice asked.

John Cumber
clutched his pumping heart in pain. He couldn�t think straight. He couldn�t
choose. Ten seconds, nine, eight �

�This line
goes dead forever in five seconds.� Her tone was cold.

He knew she
meant it.

How could he
decide ? Three, two �

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Author�s Note

&nbsp;

Up until a few
days ago, the story ended here. With the fate of the entire Cumber family
uncertain and John Cumber clutching his heart, a ten second countdown to who
knows what ? As I stated at the beginning, �Best Enjoyed Cold� would only
contain eight Parts. I had no idea what the future beyond this point held for
the Cumbers or, for that matter, for Charlie, Mel and Lennie
either. As far as I was concerned, Revenge had been eaten and enjoyed.

&nbsp;

But after I
posted Parts 4 and 5 (and after reading people�s comments), I started to think
about the characters� futures and a possible Sequel. I even had a title (�Some
like it Hot�) and gradually an ending came to me. In the event, I decided that
I didn�t have the motivation or the material for a full-blown Sequel. However,
I did have sufficient for an Epilogue.

&nbsp;

Therefore I
will be posting the final Part (9) that contains a Complete Version of the
whole story (with typos corrected) and includes an Epilogue, entitled �Nine
Lives�.

&nbsp;

Finally, I am grateful to all those who
have either reviewed my stories or sent me feedback via the email author
facility. It is always more rewarding to know what people think, rather than
simply posting stories into an empty void. I have several works in various
stages of progress including a Sequel to �After the Pestilence� (�Beyond the
Pestilence�) and a Sequel to �A Special Relationship� (�A Special Weekend�)
plus two entirely new stories. Coming (reasonably) soon ! Velvetglove.

PART ONE:

�Songs
of Love and Hate�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The Chameleon
watched dispassionately.

The gang rape
was being carried out to piped organ music with the same meticulous precision
as the military manoeuvres of the previous 72 hours. A tang of incense pervaded
the white walled room alongside the woman�s pitiful wailing and the relentless
male grunts.

&nbsp;

It had all
been worked out in advance. The woman should - at this exact moment -
have been basking in happiness as �The Mother of the Bride�, proudly watching
her elder daughter walking up the aisle. Instead, she was now being held down,
mounted and fucked by a succession of masked and uniformed men, each enjoying
his allocated five minutes.

&nbsp;

Cold hearted ?
Sure, ladies and gentlemen. After all, this is a Song of Love and Hate. And
especially Hate.

So where do
I begin ? When do I begin ? In one sense it all began so many years ago.
Decades, in fact. Plenty of time to chill a splendid buffet that is best served
cold.

&nbsp;

But in another
sense it really all went off just three days ago. The stretch limousine carrying
the bridal party to the wedding rehearsal left the gates of the massive Cumber
estate at 14.40 hrs precisely on its way to the church. As usual, the chauffeur
was armed, and the Merc escort behind carried a pair of uniformed heavies. All
was going to schedule.

&nbsp;

But the
chauffeur and escort proved no match for the crack team of mercenaries that
carried out the raid. The bride, her mother, the groom, and the bride�s younger
brother and sister were �extracted� and kidnapped in less than sixty seconds,
with a minimum of fuss and bloodshed. Only the father of the bride was missing
from the party.

&nbsp;

And, of
course, that was the Chameleon�s intention.

&nbsp;

After that it
was a question of making enough changes to cover their tracks. The five
unconscious victims were transported over 7,000 miles in total. They were
shuttled back and forth in various directions, for different durations, in a
miscellany of SUVs and trucks, then helicopters, two private jets, via motor
launch and powerboats, eventually overland in ancient lorries, and lastly
through mountain passes strapped over the backs of a train of camels. Each
time, the method of transport was �cleansed� afterwards, and - in the case of
the motor vehicles and powerboats - completely destroyed by fire. So, by the time
the long, zigzag journey was finished, they were on a different continent, in a
strange and exotic country, in an untraceable location. Even with satellite
surveillance, finding a needle in a haystack would have been a thousand times
easier than tracing either the victims or their kidnappers.

&nbsp;

The Chameleon
smiled thinly and lit a cigarette, amused by the woman�s begging. The
geographical trip had taken almost three days, but her journey from arrogant
�45 year old billionaire bitch� to pleading, sobbing cunt had been short
indeed. It was the way she obviously thought she had something to bargain with
that caused the smile. As if, having failed to order them about like her
servants, she could negotiate her way out instead. Maybe she thought they took
credit cards ? Or she could send round her chauffeur with a wad of cash later ?
But now, Leatherback was already the seventh man to demonstrate to her that
everything she had to offer them could be ripped from her for nothing.
Leatherback�s muscled buttocks hammered up and down in fierce, deep, impatient
strokes.

&nbsp;

The familiar
organ music being played over the sound system on continuous loop started up
again. The �Bridal Chorus� from Wagner�s Opera Lohengrin is the standard
march played at the entrance of the bride at most weddings in America and the
Western World. Now it was being used as a melodic accompaniment to Susan
Cumber�s terrible ordeal. Here comes the bride�s mother, perhaps ? On second
thoughts, probably not.

&nbsp;

Susan Cumber
was undoubtedly a gorgeous woman. One of those Prom Queens who had been born
beautiful, married young and the years had been kind to her since. She had
popped out three kids in quick succession, got her figure back, exercised, ate
well, barely drank and lived right. She hadn�t even had to resort to surgery
yet. No nips, tucks or even botox. Her 45 year old skin was smooth, her butt
was firm, and her boobs were natural Ds that still looked sensational even
without a bra. Of course, money helped. Cooks, diet counsellors, a full time personal
trainer, a tennis coach, two masseuses, daily hairdresser, and the best
doctors, gynaecologists, dentists, orthodontists, �what-have-yous�, all at her
beck and call.

&nbsp;

It was hard to
envisage the groaning, sobbing, writhing woman as the same immaculately poised
corporate wife and mother-of-three, whose photograph so often adorned the
business press and the society magazines. She was a green eyed, platinum
blonde, with perfect cheekbones and teeth that dazzled. A rare blend of
Hollywood glamour and Manhattan sophistication. At 5� 9� tall, she was the
ideal height to complement her handsome 6� 3� husband, whether posing formally
for press shots or attending charity balls. Her figure was just a little fuller
than those of her two daughters but absolutely in proportion to her larger
breasts and extra inches in height.

&nbsp;

The Chameleon
stubbed out the cigarette. Leatherback had shot his bolt and was being replaced
by Viper. There was no rush. As that old song goes, they had all the time in
the world.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

At least one
continent, seven time zones, and several thousand miles away, John Cumber paced
a room that was packed full with the best. From the President down, everybody
had promised anything and dropped everything to help. It was a Saturday and they
were all there; CIA, FBI, Military brass, others from agencies he hadn�t even
known existed, plus his closest hired hands and colleagues. The Cumber
Corporation was a multi billion dollar machine and all of its resources had
been utilised or placed on standby to assist.

&nbsp;

The problem
was there had been no progress in three days. Sure, there were teams of agents
combing the kidnap site, officers interviewing anybody and everybody,
researching, collecting data, trawling every damned domestic and international
contact for clues. Any clue. But the result so far was a big fat zero.

&nbsp;

He glanced
down at his gold Patek Philippe. At this very moment he should have been
walking Lorna up the aisle, in front of five hundred guests, then standing
proudly alongside Susan throughout the service, with Rachel and Ryan either
side of them. He crushed the empty plastic water cup that was in his hand,
swearing for the thousandth time that he would find his family and save them.

&nbsp;

And get the
people responsible.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The Chameleon
sat at a bank of screens and surveyed their �guests�.

Each had a
cell to themselves. The cells were not, of course, the five star accommodation
they were used to. They were below ground, humid and damp, with trickles of
liquid running down the walls. They stank of raw sewage. Rats and insects
scurried in and out of the cells and corridors.

&nbsp;

Above ground,
the house and garden had long since been converted into a comfortable but
inconspicuous home. The thick compound walls that ensured their privacy had
been built of mud, baked hard by many years of hot desert sun. Decades before,
this site had housed a fort and prison used by the infamous French Foreign
Legion to incarcerate its prisoners, miscreants and deserters.

&nbsp;

Although the
bank of screens suggested the five underground cells they had selected were
neighbouring, they had in fact a choice of over fifty, and had chosen ones
spaced well apart. It was important that their captives be unable to
communicate with or hear each other, at least during the early stages of their
ordeal.

&nbsp;

The cell walls
and floors were made of stone and dried mud except for the front and ceiling
that were made of columns of steel bars, just like those in cowboy movies, the
Chameleon thought. Each one measured only six feet by six feet square and they
were totally devoid of any furniture at all; no bed, chair, even sanitary
facilities. The only �decoration� were five iron manacles set in the shape of a
star into the rock hard rear walls. Their positioning alone would have made it
obvious they were intended for a captive�s neck, wrists and ankles to be held
in a stretched spread eagle position.

&nbsp;

However, what
made that fact even more evident was that each of the �guests� had already been
fastened into the manacles. Microphones and night-vision CCTV cameras in each
cell gave the Chameleon perfect sound and vision, even in the murky light.

&nbsp;

In the middle
cell, Susan Cumber hung on her tiptoes. She was naked with a glistening stream
of wetness oozing down her inner flanks. Her breasts, hips and abdomen were
marked with red blotches and a couple of darker bruises. Her head hung down
dejectedly, face obscured, her shoulder length blonde tresses mussed and
dangling.� The Chameleon shrugged. It was
to be expected. After a lifetime of fidelity to one man, you couldn�t expect a
woman to be thrilled about going from men numbers two to twelve all within an
hour. She deserved a little rest.

&nbsp;

Shown on the
screens either side, were her two daughters. In one, Lorna Cumber - who should
now by rights be Lorna Collins of course - was fastened in a similar
uncomfortable starfish pose. She was dressed in the same outfit she had been
kidnapped in, although it glowed dirty and slightly torn in the green
night-vision CCTV light. It was a wedding dress. Not the real dress. Oh
no, it would have been bad luck to be seen in that before the happy day
itself ! But the billionaire Cumbers had typically splashed out on a choice of
three bespoke, couture dresses for their darling, spoiled 23 year old older
daughter and she had decided to wear her second choice for her wedding
rehearsal. Lorna was beautiful, but she took after her father rather than her
mother. She was a doe-eyed brunette, with long eyelashes, coltish legs and a
slightly olive complexion. She had lost her wedding pumps on her journey and
was now staring at the floor of her cell, shrieking and blubbering whenever a
rat or spider came close to her bare, arched feet.

&nbsp;

In the other
monitor, Rachel Cumber was wearing an expensive �sister of the bride� outfit, a
beautifully cut suit made especially for her by one of America�s trendiest
designers. Unlike Lorna, Rachel was not so much classically �beautiful�, as
just downright fuckable. Even though she was two years younger than her sister,
there was a provocative sensuality about her that belied her 22 yrs. At only 5�
2� she was several inches shorter than her mother and sibling but she was
perfectly formed. Facially, she took after her mother, with long blonde hair
and the same perfect cheekbones and expensive flawless smile. Her pretty,
turned-up button nose was of the �my shit doesn�t smell� variety. But whereas
her mom�s eyes were green, Rachel�s were a startling blue. The Chameleon
chuckled and decided that, in the probably unlikely event Hollywood came calling
to make a blockbuster of this thriller, the role of Rachel Cumber would be best
performed by Paris Hilton. Sure, it was unfortunate that Rachel�s cleavage was
smaller than her mom and sis - a perky B cup at best - but her model-thin legs
and waspish waist made the whole package appear just as generously endowed. The
bitch was staring out straight at a camera, mouthing obscenities in apparent
defiance.

&nbsp;

The other two
cells were occupied by Ryan Cumber, �middle child and only son� of John and
Susan, and finally Gene Collins, �groom-to-have-been� of Lorna Cumber. The
Chameleon perused them briefly, spending much less time studying the men than
the women. Ryan was a younger version of his father; similar six-foot-plus
physique, the same handsome features, jutting jaw, close cropped brown hair and
intense brown eyes. Gene was the obvious odd one out in the group. And not just
because of his gingertop. The Cumbers were all hewn from beautiful stock and it
was evidently something other than Gene�s looks that appealed to Lorna. He had
a bookish air, with red hair, pale skin and insipid, watery-blue eyes. At 5� 7�
he was only the same height as his fianc�. Mind you, the Chameleon knew that
when he stood on top of his wallet, Gene Collins was a lot taller than five
seven. Strange how these rich folks gravitated towards each other. Mergers, not
marriages.

&nbsp;

The Chameleon
pushed the chair back from the monitors and lit another cigarette. It was now
over three days since any of their captives had eaten or drunk anything but
water. Soon the fun could begin.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The Eyes
watched the Cumber Building from the coffee shop across the Street. The police
had cordoned off a large area to one side of the main tower to contain the mass
of media vehicles and rif-raff that gathered to rubberneck an event like this.
It�s not every day that the wife of a BBD gets kidnapped, let alone with her
three kids and a fianc�. BBD � acronym for a �billionaire business dude� ! But
what made it funnier to the owner of the eyes was that all these people - the
police and agents in the building and around the country, the media hacks and
paparazzi snoops outside, the watching and listening audiences around the world
- none of them knew jack-shit !

His eyes
squinted up to a window at the very top of the tower. He framed it within a
circle made by his thumb and index finger. He watched a while through the
imaginary scope, aiming carefully at the glass. Slowly he closed the palm of
his hand, eradicating the ugly Cumber Building from his sight.

Only one
fucking person in the whole US of A knew anything !

The Chameleon.

Him.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The Chameleon
entered the cell at dawn. The temperature outside was already climbing fast
after the chill of another cloudless, starlit night. However, underground,
neither the dank air nor dingy light changed much throughout the 24 hour cycle.

Susan Cumber
was barely conscious. The Chameleon wrenched her head up by her platinum
tresses and the stench of sewage in the cell seemed to act like smelling salts,
waking her. She opened her glazed, bloodshot eyes and her nostrils flared.

The Chameleon
surveyed her through the mask�s eyeholes as the woman�s face crumpled in shock
and fear.

�Time to wake
up.� The Chameleon chirped cheerily, like a mom waking a drowsy teenager.

An amazed
expression came across Susan�s features, her forehead creasing into a frown.

�Y � you�re �
a woman ?�

�Yes.� She
said curtly. �Good observation.�

�But � how c �
could you do this to � another woman ?�

The Chameleon
laughed aloud through the mouth flap of her mask.

What a
funny question.

�Are you
hungry ?�

�Answer me !�
Susan Cumber shrieked in anger. �How could you ?�

The Chameleon
slapped her leather-gloved hand across the woman�s face twice, first one way,
then a backhander. The blow snapped Susan�s head sideways, making her gasp and
sob, before ducking her face forward in the neck iron to try to avoid another
blow.

�If you speak
to me like that again,� she spat, �I assure you that, not only will you regret
it, but your daughters will as well.�

�My daughters
!� Susan�s face furrowed as she looked up. �Lorna. Rachel. And Ryan. What have
you done with them all ?�

�Oooh, they�re
not far away.�

�Please � tell
meeee �� the woman begged.

�Later. Now, I
asked if you are hungry.�

Susan paused,
her brow puckered in confusion. Her head slumped again.

�Yes.� She
whimpered quietly.

�And thirsty
?�

�Yes.� A
whisper.

�Okay.�

&nbsp;

The Chameleon
watched from outside the cell as Susan Cumber knelt on all fours and ate the
swill from a steel bowl on the floor. The main ingredients of the mush were
breakfast oats and tinned milk. However, the mix had been laced with a strong
laxative. The meal wouldn�t stay in her for long. She would soon be hungrier
than ever.

After the
woman had finished eating, two masked mercenaries returned to manacle her back
into the stretched, standing position in her cell, only this time she was
allowed to rest her heels fully on the floor.

�Better ?�

Susan moved
her head up and down ungratefully.

She smiled
behind her mask and placed her gloved hand on Susan�s bare hip.

Susan winced,
helpless to shy away more than a couple of inches.

She slowly
traced her hand up Susan�s side and over to her superb, bruised breasts,
hefting them as if they were damaged fruit on sale. She slid her hand back down
over Susan�s taut abdomen to between her damp thighs.

�I�m going to
give you an hour or so of thinking time.� She said. �When I come back, I want
you to give me an answer to this question. Okay ?�

Susan stared
back into her mask with a sullen look of unrestrained hostility.

�What is the
question ?�

�It�s simple
really. My poor men are all alone here with us. Without their girlfriends and
partners. To stop their trigger fingers getting itchy, they will need their
sexual needs � er � catered to. Regularly. And I assure you that I am
not going to put out for them. So, two things can happen. Either you volunteer
to put in some pretty intensive stints on your own meeting their needs. Or your
daughters can assist you.�

She held up a
pair of headphones, poised over Susan�s ears.

�It�s up to
you. Mull it over for a while.�

She snapped
the headphones into place and walked briskly out of the cell before Susan had a
chance to reply. The choice of music was apt; Leonard Cohen. His �Songs of Love
and Hate� album.

&nbsp;

Next on their
�visiting round� would be the young wannabe bride, Lorna Cumber. Today should
have been the first morning of the young lady�s honeymoon, whisked by private
plane from the swanky reception to an exclusive suite in the Caribbean, to
start fucking and sucking her darling carrot head husband for a whole three
weeks.

But instead,
today was her first morning in a rather less comfortable suite. Mind you, she
would still get to do loads of fucking and sucking.

The Chameleon
let out a little giggle of excitement.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

PART TWO:

�Two
out of three ain�t bad�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

It was still
the middle of the night in America, when the envelope was delivered to the
night guards at John Cumber�s gatehouse. They even signed for it. To be fair to
them, there had been so many comings and goings those past few days, they
shouldn�t have been heavily blamed for not getting a better identity fix on yet
another delivery guy; �medium height�, �moustache�, �well built�, �white�,
�maybe thirties�. Well, that description could maybe narrow the list down
to five million or so !

&nbsp;

It was Sunday,
05.30 hrs, and a sleepless John Cumber was drinking coffee brought to him by a
maid and flicking through newspapers and mail aimlessly, when he came across
the envelope. It appeared innocuous enough, a thin brown packet of the type
used by companies worldwide. �JOHN CUMBER, PRIVATE� was all that was
handwritten on it, in big, black upper case letters.

&nbsp;

It was when he
opened it that his heart stopped. There was a single 10 x 8 inches glossy
photograph. It was a photo of Sarah�s face. She had been crying and looked
terrified. He flipped over to the other side.

&nbsp;

�Dear Mr. Cumber,

Welcome to hell. If
you want to see your bitch and brats again, then follow my instructions very
closely. If you disobey me, even once, you will never see them again. Never.
Full stop. No negotiation. Clear ? You will be able to accuse me of many things
in the coming weeks, but being unclear is not one of them. Now, I own a lot of
Cumber Corporation stock. The first rule is that I do not want the share price
to fall, whatever happens. On Friday they closed at 15 dollars 5 cents. If the
price closes at below 15 dollars at any time during our future �discussions�,
you will lose one family member for each day it happens. The fourth time it happens,
game over.� So I suggest you use that
personal fortune of yours if ever the share price needs propping up. Buy, buy
buy ! as the saying goes. That is all for now. Sarah sends her love. We�ll be
in touch again soon.�

&nbsp;

John read
through the letter so many times he lost count. At least, fifty. He weighed
each consonant, every word, each nuance, every phrase; �the coming weeks�, �the
first rule�, �Sarah sends her love�. The bitter coffee reacted with the
ulcerous bile in his gut as he clenched and unclenched his fists. If he could
have traded every cent of his fortune there and then to have the person who had
sent this letter in the room with him, he would have shaken on the deal in a
second.

He kept the
letter private for an hour. It somehow made him feel closer to his family, now
that he at least knew something. But, at 06.45 hrs, his sweaty palm picked up
the phone and dialled Walt Furness.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Lorna awoke
and screamed at the dreadful apparition.

Somebody had
walked into her cell. The person was wearing a facemask. It was a dreadful
green rubber hood in the shape of a lizard�s head, with eyeholes, nostrils and
a mouth slit with a flap.

She swallowed
her screams and begged. �Please � nooooo ��

Everything
ached. Her calves above all, but her feet, ankles, thighs, back, neck and arms
all throbbed with agonising pain from standing up all night.

�Please,� she
repeated, �whoever you are ��

�Shut up,
bitch.�

It was a man�s
voice. No distinguishable accent or tone. It might have been American,
Canadian, British, Australian, even a fluent English speaker from another
country. The sound was somehow expressionless, hollow and � ruthlessly
professional.

His hands
reached out and seized the cleavage of her wedding dress. With barely a pause,
he tore the silk and lace creation off her shoulders and down the middle from
her chest to her waist, and rent it asunder.

She screamed
again. In shock, fear, sick to her stomach. Lorna was awake enough and clear
headed enough to know she was going to be raped. Guys didn�t shred dresses if
they took no for an answer. She wasn�t a virgin. Not quite. She would rather
have sex than die. But she couldn�t just accept it.

His hands
pulled and ripped every last piece from her until she stood in just her
matching white panties and bra. She couldn�t fight him. So she tried words.

�Look, Mister,
it doesn�t have to be this way � I ��

She winced as
her bra was brutally pulled away from her breasts until it eventually tore the
clasp at the back, the spaghetti hoops over her shoulders ripped and the whole
thing fell away, leaving her topless.

Before she
could compute that, he did the same thing to her lace trimmed pants, ripping so
that the delicate material exploded in his grip.

She stood
naked.

Finally, he
paused, stepping back to admire her body. She could see his eye pupils moving
in the eyeholes appraising her.

And then he
started to unbuckle his belt.

�Please �� she
attempted one last time, �� look, at least let me off this wall.�

He hunkered
down in front of her, so that his erection was the correct height. She was dry
but that didn�t seem to concern him in the slightest. He spat through the mouth
flap onto his fingers and roughly manipulated her arid labia apart, then simply
forced his penis up into her. She was helpless, unable to move more than an
inch or two in any direction. She had no choice but to stand there and take it,
up against the wall.

About ten
years before, at high school, Lorna�s class had attended a lecture that covered
rape. It flooded back to her now, the sunshine streaming through the classroom
windows, her friends� morbidly fascinated teenage faces, the plain woman who
had come to give them the lecture, and her sexy male assistant who gave hints
on self defence and acted out the male role.

But this
was something quite different.

She turned her
face to the side, away from his rubber mask and tobacco breath, her wracking
sobs and his manic thrusts making it difficult for her to breathe.

At last, she
felt a small amount of lubrication as her body produced some moisture in self
defence. She didn�t know whether to feel relief because it made the rape hurt
less, or shame because her body had responded in some way. He was bigger than
Gene, the only penis she had known up to then. He was discernibly thicker and
longer and devoid of any care or finesse.

And then it
was over. He groaned and humped without much apparent enjoyment and she felt
him twitching in orgasm and then the warm wetness of his invasion of her
insides.

He pulled out
and stepped back and out of the corner of her eye she saw a big teardrop of
semen still dangling from the tip of his penis.

�You bastard.�
She muttered, defeat turning to anger.

He laughed
coldly behind the horrendous lizard mask.

�Get used to
it, cum dump. Trust me, there�s plenty more where that came from.�

And those
words were worse than the rape itself.

The sudden
realisation of the inevitable. She had no idea where she was, where her mum,
Gene, Rachel or Ryan were, or even what really had happened; whether there was
just one man, or many of them.

But what she
did know was that she was now �in play�; game on.

�Please �� she
turned her head to face him, �� who are you ? At least tell me that.�

�Sure.� He
paused while he nonchalantly tucked his penis back into his pants and zipped
himself up.

�I�m the
Chameleon.�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

It was Sunday
lunchtime when the first journalist called him.

�John ?�

The guy was
one of his close contacts, a top financial reporter to whom he had given his
cell number, somebody he could trust.

�Hi, Dan.� He
replied.

�John. I hate
to do this to you. I know what you must be going through. But there�s a rumour
sweeping the chat rooms and streets that you�re going to announce your
resignation first thing tomorrow morning because of what�s happened ��

�Let me stop
you there, Dan. That�s bull. I wouldn�t let any fuckwits beat me. Sure I�m
taking time out, but resign ? Hey, no way.�

�Well that�s
what I thought, John. But this rumour�s got some momentum. I�m also hearing
that some funds are going to lighten their holdings tomorrow. There are a few
big sell orders of Cumber stock being placed in Asia for opening tomorrow.�

John exhaled,
controlling his breathing, gripping the phone tight.

�Dan, you
gotta do something for me. The whole thing�s baloney. I can�t explain now but I
think this must be some kind of scam linked to the kidnapping of my family. You
call back your contacts and your fund manager friends and tell them that, not
only do I deny it, but I will never again deal with anybody who unloads Cumber
stock at this time.�

�Whoa, my
friend. Cool it. I�m sure it won�t be that bad. I�m just warning you
something�s out there. I�ll make some calls but I can�t promise anything.�

�Okay �
thanks, Dan. Keep in touch.�

He hit the red
button with his thumb and stared out of the window.

Now things
were starting to make some sense.

&nbsp;

***
*** ***

&nbsp;

She lifted the
headphones from Susan Cumber�s ears.

�Depressing
stuff isn�t it ?�

The patrician
eyes looked back at her. They were smoky, dull, no longer so defiant. Not
beaten yet, but certainly on the canvas.

She placed her
gloved finger under Susan�s chin.

�Chin up, Sue.
Things can get worse, you know. Now, have you thought about my little
question ? Got an answer for me yet ?�

Susan�s green
eyes watered into tears.

�I�ll do it.
Whatever you want.� A pause. �Just don�t touch my children.�

She smiled
behind the mask.

�Sure. That�s
a deal.� She replied in her most reassuring tone. �But I want to be certain
that you�re totally clear about your side of it. You will be able to
accuse me of many things, Sue darling, but being unclear is not one of them.
Okay ?�

Susan nodded,
snivelling.

�It ain�t just
a bit of fucking, Sue. It�s the works. You�ve got to do everything my boys
want. No saying no. Whenever and whatever they want.�

The gorgeous
creamy skin scrunched in a scowl of confusion. Funny how quick the lines are to
appear once you inject a bit of stress into a life.

�Wh � what do
you m � mean ?�

�I mean if you
say no to anybody, even once, our deal is off and Lorna and Rachel pay the
penalty.�

�� okay � just
don�t � involve them.�

�And another
thing, Sue, you�ve got to be real enthusiastic. Some guys like it when you just
lie there, but most of my boys like to see some gusto. You got that too ?�

Susan Cumber
shut her eyes and her face froze over, blank.

�Yes � I
understand.�

�That�s
settled then.�

Susan�s eyes
blinked open.

�Now I get my
say.�

Stupid
bitch. Always trying to negotiate.

�What ?�

�I want to see
my children. I need to know they�re safe.�

�You can. But
not yet.�

�Why not ?�

�Because I
fucking say so.�

Susan paused,
evidently gauging how far to push it.

�When ?�

�A few days � if
you keep up your side of the deal.�

The green eyes
studied her. The mask helped. Not just for scaring the shit out of them all
and hiding her identity a while. But it helped if she needed to lie as well.

�Okay. And
there�s one more thing.� Susan said. �I � need to use the bathroom.�

&nbsp;

***
*** ***

&nbsp;

�John.�

The agent in
overall charge of the case was Walt Furness, a grizzled veteran of thirty
years, although he�d never known a situation remotely like this.

�We dusted the
envelope and contents. Nothing. No prints except yours, John, no traces, zip.
We�ve sent the writing off to Quantico for analysis but I�m not sure how much
help that�ll be. But what it does do, is help us with a pointer as to who and
what we�re dealing with.�

John nodded. That
much he�d worked out for himself.

�John, I�ve
got to ask. Do you have any enemies ?�

He would have
laughed in other circumstances. Even now he allowed himself a wry smile.

�A few, Walt.
You don�t reach my position without inflicting some casualties along the way.
I�m not exactly the most popular kid on the block.�

�So, you know
what I�m saying. Any ideas ?�

He shrugged.
�Who would do this ? You�re kidding right ? I can be a shit, Walt, but ��, he
threw up his hands, �� to cause this ?�

�Would you
make a list of all the names you can think of who might dislike you ? Anybody,
with or without reason. We�ll handle them with care.�

John stared
across at him, then nodded.

�Sure. But
isn�t this just about money ? We�re just the innocent targets.�

Walt eyed him
back, stroking his bristled jaw.

�Maybe. Maybe
not.�

&nbsp;

In the large
courtyard, round the swimming pool, most of the mercenaries had spent the early
morning lounging on sunbeds, listening to ipods, drinking coffee, reading
magazines, tanning themselves. Even in the safety of this place, two other
mercenaries were on duty, scanning the sophisticated detection equipment, the
horizon and the skies for any signs of unmanned drones or human intruders.

They were a
tough bunch, reputedly the best. An international squad of men who had fought
and killed side-by-side in many of the world�s harshest places; in eastern
Europe, Asia, around Africa, central America.

Of course,
they had real names. And a plethora of passports from different countries. But
for this job they were simply �The Reptiles�.

&nbsp;

Susan Cumber
had led a charmed life. To her, �embarrassment� up to that point was arriving
at a charity dinner and finding another woman in the same designer dress.
�Shame� was your child not top scoring at school.

But now, she
was squatting naked, in the sun-drenched courtyard, waiting for permission to
defecate onto spread out magazines in front of a group of evil men. The same
thugs, no doubt, who had raped her the day before.

They were no
longer wearing masks. The thought troubled her.

If they no
longer cared about being identified, what did that mean ?

The men were
all hard featured with cruel eyes. Three were blacks, one was asian of some
sort, the rest varying shades of caucasian. She estimated their age range to be
mainly in their forties, like her, but a few looked younger and one appeared to
be in his fifties or even sixties. Most were heavily muscled, scarred and
wearing just swimming shorts for sun bathing. A couple had T shirts on as well,
with dark sweat patches. Only one of them looked out of shape, a huge fat black
man with a bald head and an enormous stomach hanging over his belt.

She winced at
the realisation that he had been one of her rapists. Susan liked to think she
was a tolerant, modern woman. Not a racist. But she had been brought up in the
South and the idea of � African Americans � and their black � things � was �
quite literally beyond the pale.

The one who
seemed to be their leader they referred to as Gator.

Gator was
holding a bamboo stick, running it teasingly up the inside of her thighs. He
was one of the ugliest men she�d ever seen, with an entire ear missing and a
livid purple scar distorting one side of his face.

�You hold it
in there for us just a little bit longer, bitch.�

She grimaced.
In truth, she knew she was on the point of losing control. Beads of
perspiration sprouted like teardrops from her pores in the boiling hot sun. She
was squatting, legs akimbo, knees wide apart, her fingers tented on the ground
behind her, her arms propping herself up. She couldn�t imagine a more
humiliating pose.

She would
have rather died than this. But not Rachel, Ryan and Lorna. They were worth
more than any amount of cruelty these bullies could inflict on her.

The obnoxious
men were fanned out just a few feet in front of her, studying between her legs,
gazing and smirking at her naked thighs, breasts and face.

The edge of
the bamboo poked up between her labia, splaying her open. She was still filthy
from their rape of her the evening before. The foul stink of stale sex and body
odour assaulted her nostrils in the hot sun.

�Please �� she
mouthed silently, a hiccup of air escaping her lips.

The man called
Gator grinned with the half of his mouth that worked. His teeth were yellow and
uneven.

�Okay. You can
dump it all out now. Give us a show.�

She paused.
She was desperate but, when it came to the actual moment, something in her
wouldn�t allow her to accept the embarrassment and shame. Her insides were
turning circles like cement in a mixer. How on earth was she going to do
something so undignified ?

And then it
happened.

With an
uncontrolled rush of noise and air and stench, her sphincter gave way and a
mass of soft faeces splattered the laid out magazines under her body.

She couldn�t
bear to look at the grinning, fascinated faces of the sweating men as they
enjoyed her total dishonour. She shut her eyes and let out an equally
uncontrolled sob.

What had
she done to deserve this ?

�Caught in the
crossfire.�

Gene Collins
hung in the manacles, mouth dribbling, doing his best to stay conscious and
understand what the woman behind the mask was saying to him. Caught in the
crossfire ? He had been caught up in something beyond his control.

�Wha �?� he
mumbled.

Her gloved
hands eased down his underpants and she used scissors to snip them off him,
leaving him totally naked. Please, no.

�Yes, you�ve
been caught in the crossfire, I�m afraid.� She repeated, her tone of voice less
concerned than the words suggested.

�So, let�s
have a look-see, shall we ?�

Her voice
sounded older, like his mom�s. Her fingers cupped his balls and then smoothed
out his shrivelled, petrified length. He felt like some meagre cut of meat she
was thinking of buying for her family dinner.

�Not bad for a
little one.� He could detect the amusement in her voice.

�Please don�t
��

She moved her
finger to his lips. It smelt of leather. New gloves.

�Ssshhh �� she
said. �I won�t hurt you. Not if you�re good. I�ve got a nice job for this thing
anyway.�

He swallowed. Job
?

�You should
have been fucking your bride right now, shouldn�t you ? Using this cocktail
sausage to give her a damned good seeing to, right ? � Right ?�

He nodded
slowly.

�Well, I�m
afraid that you can�t fuck the Cumber kid you wanted to. You see, your fianc�
Lorna is � er � now otherwise engaged. But you can fuck the other Cumber
kid. I�d like that. And I�m sure you�ll enjoy it too.�

He tried to
shake his head to clear it but merely banged it on the cell wall.

Fuck Rachel
? Lorna�s sis ? I mean � but why ?

Inside the
eyeholes of the lizard mask, he detected two pupils shining.

�No.� the
woman�s voice said, with the hint of a giggle. �Oh no. Not Rachel, silly boy !
We wouldn�t want that. No � it�s Ryan we�d like you to give a good seeing to.�

&nbsp;

The Chameleons
sat together in the shade and watched their screens. It would have been nice
for them to have the final member of their trio there with them too but he was
rather busy over in the States at that moment.

Still, as
Meatloaf crooned, back when they were both young, �two out of three ain�t bad�.

Two chilled
glasses of lager sat on the table, wonderfully refreshing in the heat of the
north African morning.

They chinked
glasses and supped.

Best
enjoyed cold.

There is
something wonderfully erotic about a white woman�s red-lipsticked mouth sliding
up and down the full length of a long black erection.

On the main
widescreen - a huge plasma monitor - Susan Cumber was being slowly spit roasted
in the sunshine. Gecko, a heavily tattooed warrior of uncertain parentage and
nationality but now carrying a Russian passport, was crouched behind her as she
knelt on the sun bed. His muscled torso glistened with suntan oil as he
sensuously eased himself in and out of her slurping cunt.

Cobra was
lying on the sunbed, his massive black belly shimmering with sweat, his fat
fingers possessively entwined in her platinum blonde tresses, guiding her
pursed lips up to his swollen helmet, then back down his shaft as far as she
could manage without gagging. Her pendulous tits hung down as she worked,
nipples brushing Cobra�s inner thighs.

Give the bitch
her due, you really might think she was enjoying it. The expensive sound system
picked up every meaty slap of flesh on flesh, each moan, every whimper, the
continuous sloshy glugs from her cunt and mouth as she tackled her first ever
threesome.

Gecko and
Cobra played their parts too, with the usual porn star noises and �yes babe�,
�mmm � you love it don�t you�, �oooh you�re so tight round my dick� and other
choice blue movie screenplay comments.

The
microphones taped. The cameras rolled, focussed close up, so as to catch her
face in glorious detail but only showing her lovers from their necks to their
knees. In the smaller screens to the side, other lenses captured the views from
below and also a long shot of the entire scene.

For Susan
Cumber, it was going to be one long, super-hot day.

The Chameleons
exchanged excited glances as Gecko uttered a prolonged, orgasmic groan and
unleashed his first orgasm of the morning.

Everything was
going to plan.

And for the
Cumber family, things were about to get a hell of a lot worse.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

PART THREE:

�Three
little birds�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

It was always
hard for him to remember anything much before the Rage.

Before the �red
mist� descended.

The first
nineteen years of his life seemed to have gone pretty well, as far as he could
recall.

Then came the
summer of Seventy Six.

Sounds like
a fucking song doesn�t it ? Teenage kicks, we learned some tricks, oh we took
out our dicks and fucked those chicks, during the long hot Summer of �76.

He�d even
strummed guitar back then, before he smashed it into pieces.

Sunday, 4th
July 1976, was a truly significant day in Charlie�s life for three reasons.

First, it was
the day that the Israeli Sayeret Matkal Special Forces launched their daring
raid on Entebbe Airport in Uganda, sparking in him a love of military warfare
that had never left him.

Second, it was
America�s Bicentenial Celebration; 1776 � 1976. The 200th
anniversary of the Declaration of Independence. One of the things that he could
still remember was the excited atmosphere: the festivities and parades, the
enormous firework displays that lit up the night sky, the fluttering flags, the
cook outs and evening parties, the sound of music, the taste of beer and the
scent of spliffs.

And thirdly, 4th
July 1976 happened to be the day that John Cumber fucked his fianc� and set
this whole darned thing in motion.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

The youngest
Chameleon loved playing delivery guys.

This time he
was still �white�; but he had become �tallish�, �grey haired�,
�probably late forties� and �clean shaven�. He was also wearing a
genuine Fedex uniform. He dropped the package at the Cumber Building reception
on a frantic Monday morning, got it signed for and even stuck his tongue out at
the CCTV cameras on his way out.

It didn�t
matter. It was the last time he would be doing things this way.

&nbsp;

John Cumber
felt his blood run cold when his Executive Assistant brought in the mound of
mail with a �JOHN CUMBER, TOP SECRET, EYES ONLY� package on the top. He
immediately recognised the big, black, handwritten upper case letters.

For a moment
he wondered if he should call Security without delay to trigger a search and
chase. But he figured it would have taken a minimum of fifteen minutes for the
package to reach him. By now, the person who delivered it would be long gone.
It had a Fedex sticker. Maybe that could be used to trace somebody if it was
genuine ?

More
importantly, he wanted to open the package in private.

He tore it
open, revealing an inner envelope, one of those square plastic coated cards
used to protect computer discs. It contained a CD of some sort.

�Thanks,
Shelly.� He said, his tone making it clear to his EA that he needed time alone.
She discreetly shut the office door behind her.

&nbsp;

He pulled a
pair of plastic gloves that Walt had given him out of his desk drawer. Best to
keep his prints off it. The disc was silver and blank on one side. He turned it
over. �BEST ENJOYED RED HOT� was the title stencilled in gaudy red, pink and
turquoise, swirling round the centre of the disc like some nasty XXX porno DVD
title. John Cumber hated pornography, regarding it along with cigarettes and
drugs as the three vices that were undermining the moral backbone of Western
Civilisation. He hadn�t partaken in any of the three since his student days.

&nbsp;

With moist,
trembling fingers, he opened his PC drive and loaded the disc, clicking the
mouse to fire it up.

First, there
was music. That Louis Armstrong number; �We have all the time in the world�.
Suddenly the monitor flickered. Words scrolled down the screen.

&nbsp;

�Dear Mr. Cumber,

Welcome to �Best
Enjoyed Red Hot�. I hope your secretary doesn�t catch you jerking off while you
watch it ! It�s only a snippet of the whole movie actually, just five minutes
of edited highlights. What they call a �Cum Shot Recap� in the trade I think.
Watch it very carefully. As I said before, I never give unclear instructions.
Do not fast forward. When it�s finished we�ll continue our little chat. Bye for
now.�

&nbsp;

The music
faded. Almost instantaneously, without warning, Susan�s face filled the screen.

He stared at
his wife. Something was wrong.

And then
liquid spattered her face, the lens, everywhere. Hell, no. He realised what it
was. Great gobs of semen were landing on her from both sides of her face. He
caught sight of the ends of two penises just at the edge of the screen, jerking
and spurting. There was male laughter in the background accompanied by the
usual murmurs and sounds of orgasm, on top of some kind of �elevator music�
soundtrack.

And then,
worse. He saw she was actually smiling. Mouth open, apparently taking what they
were doing in good humour. Eyes shut against the cascading fluid but his wife�s
lovely dazzling teeth were visible, her expression even suggesting she wanted
it.

&nbsp;

Without
warning, the action cut to another scene, this time of Susan outdoors, on some
kind of sun bed. She was being � having sex with � one guy while another � a
black guy � was � she was performing fellatio on him !

He wanted to
shut his eyes but he couldn�t. He stared, heart beating dangerously fast, as a
heavily tattooed and muscled man � mounted his wife from behind. It wasn�t
rape. He was doing it sensuously and slow and she was even thrusting back to
meet him.

And then the
camera panned and zoomed closer on her lips sliding greedily up and down an
oversized black penis, virtually gagging each time she got more than half of
the thing in her stretched mouth.

And the
noises. He could hear them all as if they were doing it here and now on his
mahogany desk. The wet slurping sounds and the men muttering how great she was
over the dreadful �muzak� in the background.

And Susan
gasping and groaning in return.

&nbsp;

He watched all
six scenes they had included before the disc faded out. By the time it had
finished, John Cumber was blubbering like a child.

More words
started scrolling down the screen like movie credits. They were blurred and he
wiped his eye on his sleeve so he could read them.

&nbsp;

�John,

Now, now. Don�t cry.
After all, if you miss Susan and you�re feeling horny, you can watch it again
and pretend it�s your dick she�s sucking. Here�s the deal. You can buy your
kids back for two hundred and fifty million bucks each. Plus another two fifty
for the fianc�. I know math is your thing but, just in case you�re not thinking
straight, that�s a round billion for the four youngsters.

If we do that
transaction, and if it all goes real well, then we can talk about your wife.
After I�ve finished with her of course. And to show no hard feelings I�ll make
you a good price. Do what I say and I�ll only price her at one buck !

Well, gotta go. My
balls are full. A gentle reminder about the Cumber stock price. Don�t let it
close below 15. I hear there are some big sell orders out there. I�ll be in
touch again soon.�

&nbsp;

Dazed, he
despairingly picked up the phone to call Walt Furness but, before he got it to
his mouth, he dashed to his bathroom and was violently sick.

&nbsp;

***
*** ***

&nbsp;

He never
finished College. His break up from Melanie finished his academic career for
good. Instead, he joined the military.

But not the US
Army. Being a Brit on his mother�s side and desiring both a fresh start and
anonymity, Charlie fled to the UK on the day before his 20th
Birthday and applied to join up there.

Not just any
regiment. The Paratroop Regiment.

The legendary
Paras. The maroon machine.

As hard a
bunch of geezers as ever pulled on a beret and uniform anywhere.

The induction
and training were so hard he nearly dropped out a couple of times but his rage
and talent kept him going. In the end he passed with flying colours.

Then, with the
top brass�s customary sense of humour, his commanding officer selected him to
train as a specialist signals operator, mainly due to the fact that his full
name was Charlie Victor, both letters of the army�s radiotelephony phonetic
alphabet; Alpha, Bravo, Charlie, Delta, etc.

He served in
Northern Ireland. The Middle East. The Falklands. He was decorated twice.

After five
years, he transferred to the Special Air Service. The equally legendary SAS. Who
dares wins and all that jazz.

Until the �red
mist� got him into trouble one too many times and he was � well � his time in
service to adopted Queen &amp; Country was over.

They sent him
to a special psychiatric facility for two months to help him acclimatise to the
civilian world and address his �anger management� needs. And for a while it
seemed to help. But the well meaning doctor who taught him not to lash out in
the heat of the moment, only really succeeded in planting another seed in
Charlie�s tortured mind.

Don�t react
in the heat of the moment. Stay calm. If you must seek retribution, it is
something best enjoyed in the cold light of the dawn.

After seven
disastrous weeks of wearing a suit behind a desk in an office job, Charlie Victor
walked into the street one lunchtime and never returned. He drowned his sorrows
in a London pub.

Sitting next
to him that fateful afternoon was a man with a livid purple scar down one side
of his face and a missing right ear. Both men recognised each other as
ex-military, kindred spirits. They sat at the bar for many hours swapping
anecdotes and opinions and, by the time the landlord called �last orders�, a
firm friendship had begun.

Over the next
few days, after a few introductions to the right people, the man they had soon
codenamed �CV� became a mercenary.

Cry Havoc !
Let slip the Dog of War.

He became one
of the very best. Perhaps, even the best.

Even so, this
final mission had taken Charlie over ten years to plan and prepare.

But finally he
was ready.

In 2007.

Yep, best
enjoyed cold.

Fucking
freezing, in fact.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

He had
assembled a detailed file on Susan Cumber that went back more than a decade.
Press cuttings, magazine photos, and his own reconnaissance zoom lens shots
taken during periods between combat missions around the world. He had watched
her grow and mature and raise her teenage kids and bloom into her late-thirties
and forties, still beautiful, still immaculate and still faultless.

It was not her
fault that she and her children were now in cells downstairs about to suffer an
ordeal that nobody should be put through.

The blame
lay squarely at the door of her husband.

&nbsp;

�Please �
Daaaaddd ! Please do whatever they say. Give them the cash Dad. Or they�ll cut
my b � balls off !�

The close up
of Ryan Cumber�s genitals looked very painful on film. A noose of piano wire
was wrapped tightly round his scrotum and another garrotte around the crown of
his penis had turned it purple.

Gloved hands,
clearly visible in the picture, threatened the boy with emasculation. Two quick
tugs and his sausage and eggs would be history.

�Cut !� said
the masked male Chameleon.

�Nooooooo !�
the boy screamed in terror.

Everybody
laughed.

�He means cut
the film.� Gator said, punching the boy�s ribs good-humouredly. �Well, at least
� for now.�

&nbsp;

Meanwhile, in
another cell, the female Chameleon was directing Rachel Cumber�s contribution
to their fundraising epic.

�Daddy, we�re
all okay so far. I�m fine. Like, they haven�t touched me. But you gotta to do
what they say, daddy, and everything will be alright. Please get them their
money quick. Please. I love you.�

Rachel looked
up at her for approval, eyes brimming with tears.

�Perfect.� The
Chameleon replied, switching the recording button off. Then she looked back straight
into the 21 year old�s wet baby-blues. �Thirsty ?�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

He wanted to
see her face when he did it.

And for her to
see his.

Charlie wasn�t
a big fan of anal sex. He had always been a cunt and mouth man. I mean, why
sneak in the back when a nice purpose-built front entrance was available ? The
butt was unhygienic and unnatural and to his mind over-rated. He understood the
attraction to gays but not to heterosexual couples except maybe occasionally
for a bit of novelty.

But he�d seen
enough over the past thirty years to know that anal adds a new dimension to a
female�s shame. Susan Cumber was a backdoor virgin and he was going to be the
first guy to enjoy her that way.

They were in
the old fort�s underground interrogation room. Built in the 1950s, it was a
large space, recently re-equipped with all the most modern and effective
instruments of torture. 

Susan Cumber
was fastened onto a padded table. It was like a medieval rack but covered in
black PVC, with 21st Century dials, knobs and gizmos. The tabletop
comprised four quarters and each rectangle could be controlled separately,
upwards, downwards, outwards, rotating. As a result, each of her four limbs was
able to be moved to whatever position Charlie desired.

He had her
arms outstretched above her head and her legs splayed apart and up in the air,
as if she was trying to get her ankles back behind her ears. As a result, her
butt cheeks hung nicely over the edge of the table.

She had been
allowed to take a cold shower and wash herself after this morning�s activities
round the pool, then she was fed some more gruel and water, before being
allowed a half hour�s rest curled up on the floor of her cell.

He wanted her
just slightly refreshed.

Now, he had
her alone to himself.

Embarrassed,
she admitted to him that she�d had a couple of enemas in hospital but he knew
this one would be different; a dreadful, chilled cramping solution laced with
an additive that would irritate her bowel and rectum and tender sphincter.

After he had
fixed the nozzle into her guts, he stood back and watched her sweat and grimace
as all four pints filled her, distending her nicely muscled abdomen.

�Please �
aaaooorrgghh �� she groaned, trying to focus on him.

He smiled. It
was strange. He truly felt he already knew her, after all this time, and yet
she had never seen him and they had not spoken. He thought of all the articles
he�d read, the interviews, including his favourite.

�Hold it in.�
he barked. �Or your daughters will pay.�

Beads of
perspiration were bursting out of every pore on her face and body. Every sinew
in her stretched limbs strained.

He started to
whistle. She had once given an interview to her daughter�s school magazine.
Although it had been seven years ago, he had only recently found a copy. Oh,
thank the stars for search engines. It was one of those na�ve interviews full
of questions like �what is your favourite perfume� and �where was your best
vacation ?�

He loved it.
She had revealed her favourite singer was Bob Marley. So he whistled a little
tune for her:

&nbsp;

�Don�t
worry about a thing,

Cause
every little thing gonna be alright.�

&nbsp;

He made her
hold the enema for several minutes, then allowed her to expel the mass of dirty
water into a bucket he held between her thighs.

She sighed
with relief in spite of the burning sensation in her guts.

Now it was
almost time.

He put the
bucket aside and sealed it with a lid. Then he walked casually around the
table, touching her, enjoying her emerald eyes as they nervously followed his
tour of her. Linda Evans, that dame from Dallas or Dynasty or whichever �80s TV
crap, that�s who she reminded him of. He reached out and squeezed her
breasts that were splurged to her sides. Even the fittest 45 year old couldn�t
defy gravity forever. He decided one time soon he would tit fuck her.

Finally,
Charlie stood humming at the end of the table, inches from her defenceless rose
bud, specked with a few remaining drops of water.

&nbsp;

�Rise
up this morning,

Smiled
with the risin� sun,

Three
little birds

Pitch
by my doorstep

Singin�
sweet songs

Of
melodies pure and true

Sayin�
this is my message

to
you-ou-ou.�

&nbsp;

And on the
�you-ou-ou� he took the lubed-up, heavily ridged vibrator and shoved it
brutally into the middle of her puckered, virgin backdoor.

Susan Cumber
howled with pain but couldn�t do anything about it.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

At that very
moment, John Cumber, Walt Furness and just two other senior agents were sat in
an embarrassed hush as the DVD played out on the private viewing screen. The
men looked straight ahead, not turning heads left or right, ashamed to catch
each other�s eye.

But it was the
noises that hit them hardest. The wet slurping and men muttering and Susan
gasping and groaning like some porn starlet. They were men of the world but all
were married and they found it impossible to imagine the emotions that John
must be feeling as they watched.

Even just the
fact he had to share this with them.

Walt had
accorded it �top-secret� and �inner-circle-only� basis.

But
nevertheless.

Then came the
message at the end.

Asking for a
billion dollars.

And valuing
Susan Cumber at just one dollar.

&nbsp;

Finally it
finished and they all sat in uncomfortable silence.

Walt coughed.

�John � I
don�t know what to say.�

Fortunately,
his embarrassment was interrupted by the phone ringing.

John hit the
speaker button placing the incoming call on conference.

�John ?� said
an animated voice. There were chaotic noises in the background.

�Yes ?� John
replied, all faces looking across at him.

�John, it�s
overwhelming. There are some huge sell orders. We�re buying but the price
is in freefall.�

A pause. �It�s
already dropped under thirteen bucks.�

&nbsp;

***
*** ***

&nbsp;

He smiled down
into her face as he eased his erection into her bottom. She was loose and ready
for him after the withdrawal of the huge dildo.

He placed his
hands proprietarily on her tits and kneaded them like dough balls. Slowly he
started rocking his hips backwards and forwards.

�Mmm �� he
exhaled, �� good.�

She had shut
her eyes but was biting her lower lip, wincing.

�Open your
eyes little bird.�

She snatched
them open. They glistened; half with tears and half with anger, he suspected. 

�Tell me,� he
asked, �did your husband ever ask you to try it like this ?�

She gawped at
him, mouth like a goldfish. Her tits were jiggling in time with his thrusts,
wobbling like a pair of blancmanges on a dish.

�I asked a
question. I expect an answer.�

She nodded her
head as much as the table allowed. �Yes. B � but just good naturedly. J �
joking. It isn�t something he really � wants.�

He nodded
back, building a nice rhythm.

�That�s how
guys who actually want something usually ask their wives, you know.�

She swallowed.
Her expression portraying shock that she was having a conversation like this,
at a moment like this. And the truth of his comment seemed to have hit a nerve.

�Before too
long you�re going to take each guy here up this arse.�

He said it as
matter-of-factly as he could. No good natured joking.

�Unless, of
course �� he continued, �you want Lorna to help you out ?�

She flinched.
Just the slightest pause. Interesting.

�N � ngh �
no.� she replied. �I�ll do it m � myself.�

Charlie nodded
approvingly and increased his pace, hammering into her, his hips slapping
against her upturned taut buttocks. There was no need to hold back, no need to
impress. After all, he wasn�t trying to please her.

�Mmmmmm �
yesssssss �� he hissed in triumphant early release.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

On the big TV
in the guards common room, a soccer match was playing. Apart from two
mercenaries, all the men were sat round drinking beer, smoking and eating nuts,
shouting at the screen.

At the front
of the room, placed next to the TV, Lorna Cumber was bent over in a pillory
facing the half circle of men. The 23 year old�s neck and wrists were held at a
�convenient� height through three holes in a T bar, forcing her to stoop over
with her butt nicely presented behind her.

Her head was a
perfect height for her duties at a man�s waist level.

She was naked
but for a brutal spider-gag that held her jaws apart and mouth wide open, lined
with a rubber dental breach to prevent biting.

One at a time,
the mercenaries rose from their seats to take a break from the game. Some
simply pumped their dicks into her mouth for a while, deciding to prolong their
orgasms. Others did the same but then jerked themselves off, so that they
unloaded over her face and down her throat. But increasingly, as the beer
flowed and the match got more exciting, they simply used her as a urinal. They
would stand, cigs dangling from their lower lips, half looking at the screen
and half down at her, as they laid their penises onto her tongue and let rip
their frothy second hand lager. Meanwhile, they bantered with their friends
over their shoulders as if she were a mere inanimate object.

Then they
would flick their ash on her hair, shake themselves dry over her face and
jiggle themselves back into their pants before sitting back down without even a
second thought. Usually they were soon replaced by another colleague with a
swollen bladder.

Her tears and
gasps as she struggled to breathe were ignored.

Of course, Lorna
Cumber�s proper punishment could wait until the final whistle had blown.

And after that
they would enjoy moving onto her sister, the third and final little bird.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

PART FOUR:

�Four
Letters, Two words�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

She knew it
was wrong. Even through the euphoria of joints and tequila and the
extraordinary fireworks, she should never have snuck off like that. For years
afterwards she consoled herself with the illusion that it was simply her karma.
But she always secretly knew better. Fate is about choices.

Right and
wrong choices.

Melanie had
never been with another boy. Suddenly it hit her that she would be going up the
aisle without experiencing � well, �different�.

It was 1976
after all. Not 1946. Or 1876 !

You just
didn�t marry the first boy you slept with anymore.

And so it was,
when Charlie passed out stoned on the bed, and John invited her outside for
�some fresh air�, she stupidly hesitated.

�Come on.� He
said, holding out his strong hand. �Trust me.�

As they walked
out, Leonard Cohen was playing on the stereo. It was one of her and Charlie�s
favourite albums, �Songs of Love and Hate�. She imagined it quietly soothing
Charlie as he lay in his unconscious stupor. The particular track playing that
moment was �Famous Blue Raincoat�, a song thus condemned to haunt her for the
rest of her life.

It was a warm
Sunday evening, 4th July, and they had all spent the day celebrating
America�s Bicentennial.

John Cumber
! The rest of their crowd had already staggered
home. She was alone with the one guy that every girl dreamed of. Six foot three
of American Adonis, with the face of a Greek legend and the body � she felt
herself moist in the humid, mosquito-laden night air.

Just once !
John Cumber slept with all the girls just once. Why not her ?

They reached
the lake, the little porch overlooking the water.

�Feeling a bit
better ?� he asked, his dazzling smile enticing her.

She gulped.
�Yeah. Thanks.�

And then his
strong right hand was behind her neck, pulling her face to him. She gasped in
shock as he mashed his lips fiercely against hers.

�Mmmou � ch ��
she mumbled, pulling away.

His left hand
snaked up the back of her top seeking her bra clasp.

She tried to
calm him, a battle raging within her. Just once.

He unclipped
her bra and pushed his hand round the front, mauling her boobs. Her mouth hurt
where he was attacking it with his face.

�Come on,
Mel.� He insisted, with an impatient snarl. �You�ll love it. Trust me.� 

And suddenly
she knew this was all wrong. She was engaged. To Charlie. He was the only guy
she wanted, needed.

But John
Cumber wasn�t used to girls turning him down.

Certainly not
prick teasers who accepted an invitation down to the lake. He pushed her onto
the ground, tripping the back of her legs over his shins so she fell onto her
back. And then he jumped on top of her.

The air
exploded out of her lungs with a whoosh.

Wrong place.
Wrong time.

Her karma.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

She peered
into the guards� common room. Gator beckoned to her, holding up three fingers.
She guessed that meant there were just three minutes left of the soccer match
to play.

Skink, one of
the black mercenaries, was stood at the human urinal shaking the drops from his
penis. He smiled. None of the men were embarrassed in front of her any more.
Melanie was treated as an �honorary male�.

After the match
ended 3-1, the TV was switched off and the pillory was wheeled into the centre
of the room. It was on a wooden platform with castors that made it easy to
manoeuvre.

The men
rearranged their chairs from the half circle in front of the TV into a full circle
around the pillory. They charged their beer glasses and lit up new cigarettes
while a camcorder on a tripod was set up in position. 

Lorna Cumber
couldn�t speak. The spider-gag meant that drooling and inarticulate gurgles
were the most she could manage. But her expression spoke eloquent volumes
anyway.

Her face
already glistened with ejaculate and urine and her brunette hair hung down in
sodden strands. 

Melanie stayed
out of Lorna�s field of vision. She wasn�t wearing her lizard mask. Not that
she needed to worry but she decided she would save up a face to face meeting
for another day. She sat down with a nice view of Lorna�s naked and defenceless
bottom.

Gator smiled
at the poor, helpless girl. The rear vistas of fit, young ladies are so
dreadfully attractive; the camber of their spines, the violin shaped curves
with no lumps or wrinkles yet, the dimples and their peeking, unspoiled
rosebuds.

At 6� 5� of
solid muscle, Gator was a contrastingly terrifying sight, with his missing ear
and dreadfully scarred face.

�Hi !� he said
to Lorna pleasantly, pausing as if she could reply.

�Feel free to
chip in at any time.� He added, reaching down to push a few strands of her hair
away from her face so they could both see each other.

�I�m afraid
your mom had the opportunity to save you from all this but she chose not to.
She�s in her cell sleeping, after a nice hot meal. You see we gave her the
choice of being here now. Or your baby sis. Or you.�

He laughed.

�And she chose
� you. What were her exact words, guys ?�

He turned to
the circle of men, as if asking for help.

�Er � yeah �
she said that she was too old to take this treatment, and she loved Rachel
too much to sentence her to it, so it had to be you !�

He stroked the
edge of Lorna�s eyes, flicking away tears.

�Personally I
can understand Rachel being her favourite daughter. I mean, we would all have
preferred her too, as she�s a much better looker than you ! But a deal�s a
deal. We said your mom could choose.�

He held open
the palms of his hands as if to say, �what can you do ?�

�Now, I�m
afraid this isn�t going to be pleasant. You�ve spent twenty three years living
as a spoilt brat, so you�re not going to find it easy to learn the level of
humility and obedience necessary to satisfy us.�

Melanie
squirmed on her seat. Gator was so good at this routine, choosing just the
right words.

�But then,� he
continued, �we�ve got plenty of time. Weeks, months, maybe even years. Boy are
we gonna have some fun, sweet cheeks.�

He showed her
the bamboo cane he had been holding behind his back.

�Let�s start
with ten introductory strokes, shall we ?�

He winked at
Melanie and passed her the cane when she stood up.

Melanie looked
at the watching men and then at the lovely pale buttocks stretched, and on a
plate, facing her at just the right height.

But
suddenly all she could see was a lake, with a little porch overlooking the
water and a boy and girl standing on the bank in the fading light.

Slowly, she
raised the cane and thrashed it down across Lorna�s butt.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Charlie sneered
down into Susan�s face as he uncorked his softening erection from her bottom.

�Open your
eyes, bitch.�

She opened
them again, full of pain and shame and who-knew-what-else.

�Thank me.�

�Th � thank
you.�

He let her see
him examining his cock.

�You want to
lick this clean or you want Lorna to do it ?�

�I�ll do it.�

He walked up
to the other end of the table, then pressed a button. There was a whirring
sound as her back and head descended to knee height.

�You think
about biting me and your kids will all pay.�

He gave her
his glistening, streaked and dripping dick to suck. Man that was good. As that
rhyme went; �Any soft mouth felt good, always did, always would�. But
this was something else entirely; a beautiful face, an unwilling woman and a
shit-stinking dish eaten real cold.

But he hadn�t
finished with Lady Goody-Two Shoes yet.

He pulled his
dick out of her lips.

�You know what
rimming is ?�

She shook her
head side to side. As he suspected. Lovely.

�I�m going to
turn round and sit down on your face. You are going to stick out your tongue
and shove it as far as you can up my arsehole.�

He beamed at
her look of utter disgust.

�Look at it
this way, at least you�re sparing your lovely daughters all this stuff. That is
� unless you�d rather not kiss my butt until it gleams ?�

It was too
easy. All the attempts at negotiation had ceased. It was going to be such fun
in the days ahead pushing and pushing, until he found her resistance point.
Then things would get really interesting.

She stuck out
her tongue to signify she would do what he ordered.

�Say please.�
He said.

A pause.
�Please.�

He turned
round, stood astride her head, and lowered his backside ever so slowly over her
face, until he felt her nose tickling his crack hairs.

He reached
round with his fingers and pulled the cheeks of his butt as far as apart as he
could. That had to be one heck of a view.

When he was at
junior high there�d been a toilet cubicle with a piece of graffiti that always
made him chuckle; �One million flies can�t be wrong ! Eat Dung !�

He encircled
her tongue and nose and let go with his fingers, closing as tight a seal as he
could round her breathing apparatus. Yesss !

He settled his
weight down and idly wondered what was going on in the rest of the house at
that moment.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

The trading
screens and digital ticker displays around the room shrieked out the latest
development in the market in general, and the Cumber Corporation�s share price
in particular.

It had climbed
to $14 but kept meeting resistance as soon as it tried to move above. The
information feeds sucked data in from numerous sources.

So far, John
Cumber had already spent some $300,000,000 of his personal fortune buying back
shares in the conglomerate he had founded and then floated fifteen years
earlier.

�Please, Ellen,
give me the figures.� He said.

Of all the
people in the room, John Cumber was strangely the most composed, the coolest.

Not without
reason was his nickname on Wall Street �Cucumber�, as in cool as a cucumber. He
was a veteran of several bloody hostile takeovers and corporate battles and; when
the going gets tough, the tough get going.

�John, you�ll
understand these figures are only approximate.�

The speaker
was Ellen O�Leary, the head of his private office. She was both a qualified
lawyer and certified accountant. A formidable divorcee in her mid-fifties, she
was devoted to her boss and friend.

Like any
billionaire, nobody knew John Cumber�s net worth for sure on a day to day
basis.

�You have
around two point seven billion dollars at today�s valuations.� She continued.
�That doesn�t include say a hundred million of less liquid assets; your homes,
cars, the jet, jewellery, art and furniture. Obviously we could raise cash on
the back of those but heaven forbid it will come to that.�

Her grey eyes
peered at him intently over half-moon glasses.

Around the
table, seven more people looked up, some scribbling on pads.

�Does that
include the three hundred million already spent today ?� he asked.

�You would
have to knock that off the two point seven.� She replied. �Except that you�ve
purchased more Cumber stock with it so you could still include it. So long as
the price stays where it is.�

�So, how much
of my two point seven billion is held in our stock now ?�

�One point
five billion.�

�Which leaves
me just one point two billion in usable assets.�

He had cut
to the chase. She nodded, tapping her pencil on her
pad.

�Of which I
need one billion for the children�s ransom.�

A geeky lawyer
type coughed and spoke up.

�Er � Sir.
Mister Collins has already made it clear he�ll put up the two fifty for his own
son.�

John Cumber
bridled at the interruption. The problem was his. The solution would be his.
He would pay Gene�s ransom. 

�That�s most
kind of him. But I will pay the full amount if it comes to it. I�ll call him as
soon as we�ve finished.� John made a note on his pad.

�So I have two
hundred million of other liquidity still available ?�

�Yes.� Ellen
replied, with a grimace. �But around half of that is no longer in your name.
You remember the trusts we set up for Lorna, Ryan and Rachel. It will take a
while to get the trustees legally to agree to using the funds in that way.�

�So for now I
have a measly hundred million bucks of liquidity and a bunch of useless Cumber
Corporation stock that I can�t sell or the price will collapse.�

There was a
silence in the room.

People looked
down at their pads.

Suddenly one
of the large screens in the room flickered and popped. Unlike the price
monitors, it had been broadcasting Financial Media footage of talking heads and
features with the volume set low.

Moments later
the volume erupted into life.

�Daddy, we�re
all okay so far.�

Rachel
Cumber�s distinctive nasal voice was clear but petrified.

Her
out-of-focus features slowly emerged from a blur on the screen.

�I�m fine.�
She said. �Like, they haven�t touched me. But you just have to do what they
say, daddy, and everything will be alright.�

Everybody in
the room stared in horror from the screen to John and back again.

�Oh � my ��
Ellen bit her knuckles and shut her eyes tight.

�Get the Feds
!� A voice shouted, as a man pushed his chair back from the table and dashed
out of the room.

�How the fuck
� ?� said another.

Again, the
calmest person seemed to be John Cumber. He stared at his younger daughter�s
darling blue eyes, brimming with tears.

�Please get
them their money quick.� Rachel beseeched him. �Please. I love you.�

He actually
smiled. A steely grin, but a smile none the less.

�And I love
you too, darling.� John Cumber mouthed to his daughter.

But it wasn�t
love he was feeling.

It was hate.
Hatred for the person or persons who had done this.

Love and
Hate. Two words, each of four letters.

How
entwined those two emotions sometimes are.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The masked
Chameleon stood in front of Rachel.

�Thirsty ?�

The girl�s
lips were cracked and split. It had been four days since she had a proper
drink. Her mind had to have become delirious with dehydration.

Several more
hours had passed since she had last teased her.

Rachel�s head
nodded pathetically. �Mmm � yeth��

The Chameleon
placed the bucket of brown water on the floor at their feet. They were not
far from the Sahara Desert. Fresh drinking water was valuable !

Rachel was
still dressed in her sweat soaked and soiled �sister of the bride� designer
suit. Soon it would be time to strip her but, for the moment, the female
Chameleon enjoyed postponing the fun.

�I�m fine.
Like, they haven�t touched me.� Hah !

For now, a
drink of her mother�s enema water would suffice as an opening move in this game
of revenge.

Melanie
thought back to that night, when he had made her wash herself off in the lake
afterwards, and rinse the evidence from her body and mouth. She could still
taste the memory of the briny, muddy water.

She raised the
pitcher to Rachel�s lips.

�Come on.
Drink up.�

The girl was
so out of it she didn�t even seem to notice the flavour.

Melanie smiled
to herself.

Oh well,
even enemas are best drunk cold.

In the cheap
motel room, Lenny dumped the convenience store bag on the bed and pulled out
one of the cans. He fired up his laptop and cracked open the beer while he
waited.

He sat at the
screen and spent ten minutes doing business, humming away to the tune on his
ipod; �Four Letters, Two words� by The Urge. The St. Louis rock band had
been one of his favourites before they split.

Man, he was a
fuckin� IT genius. Physically his PC was in the States but cyber-wise it
relocated to a different country every minute. After he had done what he needed
to do, he shrugged. Talking of �urges�, what�s a young man meant to do in a
strange town all on his own !

Lenny opened
his Favourites folder and clicked on his number one site.

The screen
displayed the reassuring orange and red letters on a grey background.

He clicked
�Stories�. Red and grey on white appeared.

�Aha�. He
smiled. One of his favourite authors had posted.

Lenny stood up
off the seat and undid his jeans and shucked his briefs down to his ankles. He
opened the �Whole Story�.

Soon he was
hard, reading and scrolling, the mouse in his left hand and his dick throbbing
in his right.

It didn�t take
him long. He grimaced and accidentally hosed the keyboard with an extra long
spurt. He laughed and, in his mind�s eye, imagined Rachel Cumber�s snotty
little face covered with his jizz. Fictional stories were all very well but �

That�s what
he would like to do to her real soon.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

PART FIVE:

�Five
foot two eyes of blue�

&nbsp;

�Five foot two, Eyes of Blue

But oh ! What those five foot could do

Has anybody seen my girl

Turned up nose, turned down hose

Flapper, yes sir, one of those

Has anybody seen my girl ?�

&nbsp;

Charlie met
the Private Detective in a seedy bar off Melrose. The year was 1987 and Los
Angeles was roasting in a July heat wave. The man pushed a folder across the
table and settled back, lighting up a Marlboro.

Inside the
folder were black and white photographs and notes bashed out on a typewriter.
Charlie studied every one of the photos of her and scanned the typed entries
the detective had made for each of the days he had been paid to keep her under
surveillance.

Melanie still
looked pretty much the same as she had eleven years earlier. Maybe a little
lined round the eyes now but her figure and face were just as he remembered. He
stared across at the private dick.

�Nobody ?�

The guy
exhaled a series of smoke rings and shook his head. Two women at the
neighbouring table glanced over at the source of tobacco smoke and coughed
pointedly.

�Sure ?�

The man
shrugged, ignoring the women. �If she has a guy, one, he�s invisible and two,
he sure ain�t getting much action !�

Charlie didn�t
smile at the crass joke.

�She�s okay
for cash ?�

The Dick
pulled a new piece of paper out of his jacket pocket. It had been scrumpled up
and then straightened. He pushed it across the table. There was a round coffee
mug stain on it.

�Last month�s
bank statement.�

Charlie checked
the balance and activity. Then he carefully picked up one of the photos of the
boy.

�And her kid
?�

�Nice enough.
Cycles to school. OK grades. Doesn�t mix with a bad crowd. Maybe a bit of a
loner. But seems to get on fine with his mom.�

Charlie
nodded, staring down at the photo again.

There was a
long pause. He finally reached into his vest and pulled out a brown envelope
with the agreed amount of pristine $50 bills.

The Dick
mopped the sheen of sweat from his brow with a hanky.

�The kid yours
?� he asked, supping his beer, eyeing the envelope.

He recoiled
almost at once, his eyes betraying a flash of true fear.

�Sorry.� He
opened his palms in apology. �None of my business.�

Silently,
Charlie slowly pushed the brown envelope towards him.

The boy was
turning out nice looking. A typical American 10 year old kid; taller than most,
and lean, apple pie wholesome.

Just like
his fucking dad.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

The Chameleon
smiled at the screen. Wall Street had closed five minutes earlier with the
Cumber Corporation having recovered after frantic late trading to end the day
at $15.05, exactly where it started. The rumour was that a particular hedge
fund had been buying to cover its earlier short position.

He looked at
his watch. Time for a midnight feast.

&nbsp;

Rachel Cumber
had replaced her mother on the operating table in the interrogation room. Her
designer skirt and jacket and stained silk blouse had all been removed and she
lay in just her bra and thong. She had been given a little broth to fortify her
for the impending ordeal. Her chest rose and fell visibly with the beating of
her heart. Her blue eyes roved around the room absorbing the scary furniture
and devices hanging all around. 

&nbsp;

Charlie and
Melanie had dispensed with their lizard masks. The game had reached a new
stage. They preferred seeing, and being seen. But they had dressed up in their
kinkiest bondage gear. He had donned tight black leathers while she was dressed
in a bright red PVC catsuit.

&nbsp;

Rachel
whimpered and sobbed when she saw them.

�Please � give
him more time � he�ll get you the money.�

�Of course he
will.� Melanie smiled.

�But �� the
girl�s voice trailed off.

Melanie
pouted. But � who gives a fuck ? You think it�s about the money bitch
? Why is it that rich people always think everything is about money ?

She reached
out and ran her fingers casually over Rachel�s stretched limbs. Her boobs were
a bit disappointing lying flat in the lace bra but that problem could soon be
sorted.

What you
couldn�t deny was the allure of the face; the cheekbones, nose, mouth and jaw,
all perfectly aligned. Her blond hair was greasy and lank but it would soon
perk up after a nice shampoo and blow dry.

�What are you
� going to do to me ?� the girl finally whispered.

�Oh � the list
is too long.�

Melanie
glanced over at Charlie. He was unbuckling his belt.

�Please � I �
I�m a virgin ��

�Really ?�

Charlie
smiled, eyes twinkling. She winked back at him. The surprising media rumours
sounded as if they were true after all. 

�Well then, I
think you�ve really gotta lot of catching up to do.� Melanie said.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Each year,
between missions, Charlie visited Los Angeles and met up with the same Private
Detective. As usual, the man pushed over a folder and lit a Marlboro but this
time Charlie�s intuition detected a difference.

As ever,
physically she appeared to have barely changed. It was 1993 and she was now 35
years old.

�Nobody ?�

He always
asked the same question first and had always got the same reply until then.

The guy
studied a series of smoke rings and stared into the distance. Enjoying his
moment. Neither Charlie nor the Dick liked each other. It was a business
transaction, nothing else.

�Nope.�

�Sure ?�

The man
shrugged. �You heard of the internet ?�

Charlie
nodded. His time as a signals specialist in the army had pretty much predated
the web. He was no expert but he knew enough.

�Well your old
lady is a keen � how�d you say � er � user of the net.�

He frowned.
Over the years he had learned to let nothing phase him. He was immune to pain,
fear, jealousy, love, all of the weaknesses that betrayed a man. He would
live fast and die young. Die alone.

�What do you
mean ?�

�Look, I don�t
know for sure. The tracking technology is new and unreliable. But she is a
frequent visitor to � well � certain sites.�

�You mean like
dating sites. Personals ?�

�No. Not that
I can tell.�

�Well �?�
Charlie almost slammed his fist down on the table but he controlled himself.
The old �anger management� techniques still worked. 

Don�t react
in the heat of the moment. Stay calm.

�I mean � well
� porn sites. But mostly fictional story sites.�

Charlie
exhaled; one-two-three-breathe.

�Yes ?�

�There is this
site that specialises in � you�ve heard of bdsm, right ?�

He waited, not
even deigning to reply.

�Well, there�s
an author named �Famous Blue Raincoat�. Writes all kinda kinky stuff.�

He already
knew where this was going. Only one person would use that nom de plume.

�Enough.� He
interrupted. �You have evidence ?�

The Dick
smiled and tented his fingers.

�I think that
an extra payment would be in order.�

Mistake.
Big mistake.

Charlie
grinned back like a reptile. One-two-three-breathe.

�Sure � let�s
meet again late tonight and exchange what you have for another envelope.�

&nbsp;

Melanie rode
the thick dildo vigorously. Thick but just right.

It stood
upright from an inflatable gag in Rachel�s mouth. She could hear the girl
struggling for air. Well, she thought, lucky for the bitch I keep myself in
good shape. A different woman my age, with flabbier buttocks, and you�d be
suffocating my little hobby horse.

She leaned
forward and kissed Charlie, their tongues entwined.

You
wonderful man. Yes, I still hate you for walking out on me all those years ago.
But I love you for coming back. And for giving me this. Revenge. Not just any
old tit-for-tat retribution but vengeance of a type and on a scale unimaginable
in normal life.

She shuddered
as erotic thrills surged up her spine. She wasn�t even remotely lesbian. But
her sexual tastes had been spiced up over the years. Truth was, in the right
mood she could enjoy pretty much anything now.

Somebody
fucks up your life ?

She hammered
down on the dildo, driving herself towards a climax.

You fuck
them back one hundredfold.

&nbsp;

She orgasmed a
second time but still Charlie was making it last. He was standing at the end of
the table, pumping in and out between Rachel�s thighs, controlling himself
every time he was about to shoot. Mind you, he�d already blown several wads
that day already so it was easier. Melanie smiled at how she teased him about
not getting any younger. She felt no jealousy watching him fucking such
gorgeous, firm flesh. He belonged to her forever now and they both knew it.

Sadly there
was no blood. �Virgin� today is a technical term. Rachel�s hymen had long since
been taken by a rampant rabbit or horse riding or whatever activity 21 year old
billionaire kids get off on nowadays.

But Charlie
was nevertheless her first cock. And they still had her asshole and mouth to
go.

And that
was just for starters.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

It was 02.00
hrs local time, when she and Charlie woke Susan Cumber in her cell. The woman
was lying curled up naked on her cell floor.

�Suseee !�
Melanie cooed through the bars. �Wakee wakee.�

Susan turned
and rose onto her knees, wiping her eyes.

�My friend
here needs his dick cleaned. You want to do it, or would you prefer Lorna did
?�

Susan looked
at them in disgust.

�I�ll do it.�
She sighed quietly.

Charlie turned
away.

�If it�s too
much trouble ��

�Nooo.� Susan
wailed. �I�ll do it � please.�

Charlie looked
undecided, still ready to leave.

�Aw, come on.�
Melanie mock-negotiated with him. �She wants it. Leave her kids alone.�

Still Charlie
remained unmoved.

�He�s pissed
off.� She confided to Susan. �How about you offer him something new ? I know,
offer to tongue his butt, he likes that.�

Susan paused.
�� I � I�ve done that.�

Melanie
laughed. �My, you two are friends already ! Oh dear. Well fuck it, I can�t
think of anything else. Maybe we�d best go visit with Lorna after all ? She
must be getting lonely by now anyway.�

�No ! Please �
look, I�ll do anything.�

There was a
hush. One of those special, awkward silences with a distinctive quality all
of its own.

�Anything ?�
she asked. �You said � anything ?�

Susan seemed
to regret her words now. But she composed herself. She swallowed and looked
tearfully into Melanie�s eyes.

�Yes �
anything.�

Dylan was
surfing the net in his room, idly checking out the free porno pages when he
came across the photo. At first he couldn�t believe the likeness. He clicked
through and found several more. Oh man ! He should tell somebody. But
first � he hit the printer menu. While the colour photos chuntered out, he
couldn�t help reaching down to his dick.

Ryan Cumber
was his classmate at college and Ryan�s mom Susan was the hottest MILF groin
candy of all. And here she was fuckin� and suckin� like some two dime Eastern
European or Latina pro.

It was
definitely her face and her body. Sometimes these sites fucked around and cut
and pasted heads onto different bodies but those sure were her big tits
swinging around on some black dude�s legs as she sucked him off. Susan
Cumber being spit roasted on a friggin� sunbed, man !

After he�d
mopped himself up with a tissue, Dylan couldn�t resist it. Just one person
wouldn�t hurt. He pasted the URL onto his screen and emailed the link to Greg.

Greg was his
best mate and another fan of Ryan Cumber�s mommy.

He smiled as
he imagined him opening up the page.

Should he tell
the police ? Nah, best not to get involved.

They�d surely
find the photos soon enough.

&nbsp;

Gator�s six
feet five frame was naked on the poolside workbench in the early morning
sunshine. He was on his back, bench-pressing some heavy weights, his muscles
glistening with sweat and oil. In the pool, several of the Reptiles were
swimming laps, while others were chatting on the deck, drinking juice and
coffee. Physical fitness was a key requirement for a top rung soldier of
fortune.

The clinging
stink of pungent male body odour was strong. Gator hadn�t showered in two days
and he was driving up the bar with animal grunts and groans of effort.

Viper was
playing his �buddy�, stood next to the bench, ready to support the heavy bar if
Gator lost control.

And then,
between Gator�s widespread thighs, kneeling at the end of the bench, was Lorna
Cumber. His female �buddy�.

Her role was
to genuflect in complete silence on the state of Gator�s damp, hirsute and
unwashed anus. The 23 year old beauty was kneeling with her face pushed in
between his thighs, her pink tongue lapping and her arms meekly held behind her
back.

She worked in
complete silence. It was her only chance of saving her fianc�s balls. One
word, one slip up from her, and young Gene�s baby-making kit would be a couple
of scraps for the wild African dogs to fight over.

So Gene was
naturally watching the scene with a fair degree of interest. He was strung up
naked a few feet from the workbench so that he could have a ringside view of
Lorna�s efforts on his behalf. A grubby towel dangled from his own erection. He
watched in complete silence like her, since one word from him, even just one
noisy breath, or if his erection softened and the towel fell to the ground, and
he had been threatened with castration.

Gene and
Lorna were the first prisoners to enjoy each other�s company since the
kidnapping. Well, after all, this was the couples� honeymoon.

Gator thrust
the bar up and held it locked for the twentieth time, wobbling.

�You can do
it.� Viper encouraged.

Gator grunted
and heaved so hard he noisily passed gas.

�Well �� he
grimaced at Viper, �� you said I could !�

Both men
laughed and peered down at Lorna. She recoiled and her hazel eyes had burst
open wide in horror.

Viper shrugged
and casually drew a 9-inch knife from his belt, starting to move meaningfully
towards Gene.

In a second,
Lorna had plunged her face back and recommenced tonguing and kissing Gator�s
hairy butt as if it was delicious frozen yoghurt.

Viper stood
threatening Gene, while sneering over at Lorna.

�What a slut.�
He shook his head. �Kid, we did you a favour, saving you from spending the rest
of your poor life with that toilet face.�

Gator hoisted
the weights bar into the steel supports.

�You gonna
fuck our young bride now ?� Viper asked him.

�Nah.� Gator
replied. He rose gingerly from the bench and removed his towel from Gene�s
erection, using it to wipe the perspiration from his face and forearms. �I�m
saving myself for later. When the real fun begins.�

�In that case
�� Viper said, hauling Lorna up by her dark hair and slamming her face down
onto the workbench, so she whimpered.

He shucked
down his shorts to reveal a semi-hard penis stiffening by the second. Then he
crouched behind her and pulled her hips up so that he could fuck her from
behind while she faced her ex-boyfriend.

Gator
nonchalantly hung his towel back onto Gene�s peg, looking right into his
red-rimmed eyes.

�You watch how
a real man does it kid. Just in case you get the chance again sometime.�

Susan Cumber
squealed every few seconds. She was standing legs akimbo in front of Charlie
and Melanie plucking out her own triangle of soft pubic fuzz with tweezers,
hair by hair. Her collar and cuffs didn�t match perfectly. Her tresses were
platinum blonde while her pubes were a kind of medium honey colour. She winced
as she depilated herself.

Her tormentors
were sat at a table on their private roof terrace overlooking the palm garden
and desert beyond. They were eating croissants, date pastries and fruit,
sipping black coffee, chatting quietly, ignoring her. Occasionally Melanie
would glance at her and �tut� when her squeaks and �ouchs� got too loud, or she
slowed down.

Eventually,
Susan�s pouting mound was scarlet hued and virtually bald.

&nbsp;

�Stand over
there� Charlie said, lighting a cigarette and rising from the table. He was
naked but for an open cotton shirt that was unbuttoned. His penis hung
temporarily sated after he and Melanie had made passionate love together
earlier, a nice contrast to the rape and violence all around them.

He reached up
and pulled down a set of chains that hung from the cross beam that supported
the terrace sunblind. With practised hands he quickly fastened her wrists so
Susan was suspended, now stretched up onto her tip toes.

�Have you ever
seen a movie called Sophie�s Choice ?� he asked.

�Meryl Streep
played Sophie.� Melanie added helpfully.

Susan shook
her head. �N � no.�

�Oh, it was
quite good as far as I recall.� Melanie said, peeling a banana. �In it, Sophie
has to choose which one of her children to save. The other she loses forever.
It�s very moving.�

�No �� Susan
whispered. �You wouldn�t. No ��

Melanie took a
sensuous, suggestive bite of banana, taking her time before replying. She too
was in just a cotton top, open to the midriff, her thighs uncovered. She had
allowed a translucent trickle of Charlie�s semen to ooze onto the tiles under
her chair without any embarrassment.

�Last night
you said you�d do anything, right ?�

�Yes.�

�Well, soon
you will get your chance.�

There was a
silence while both women stared grimly at each other.

�In a little
while, we�re all going to gather round the swimming pool. And you�re going to
invite everybody to fuck your daughters.�

�You �!� Susan
quickly stopped herself, controlling her outrage.

Melanie
chuckled. �I see you�re learning. But too late. You�ll pay later for that
little outburst. If you fail to say exactly what we want, then � well � um, you
really don�t want to think about that.�

She took
another bite of banana, pausing for effect.

�And after
your little sluts have all been fucked many times, you will get the chance to
save one of them. It will be interesting to hear your choice !�

John Cumber
woke in a terrible sweat. He looked over in the dark at the digital clock;
03.37. He had managed to catnap for three tablet-induced hours. His normally
sharp brain was already suffering from lack of sleep.

The
nightmare was a terrible one. Susan was on a brightly lit stage having rough
sex with three men while he and all their children, and their extended family,
friends and colleagues were sat in the theatre audience watching.

And he had
opened his zip, was masturbating himself in the dark while he watched his wife,
dressed in torn black lingerie of the type she never wore anymore, performing
with these men. And suddenly a bright spotlight shines down on him without
warning, and the entire audience sees what he is doing, and they all start to
titter. Even his children are chuckling at him as Ryan leans over and says �put
it away, dad�.

He woke up,
painfully erect, and had to go to the bathroom to urinate.

Afterwards he
lay in the dark, trying but failing to sleep some more.

At exactly
04.00 the phone by his bedside trilled. He fumbled in the dark for the handset
and peered at the digital display. It was blank.

�Yes.� He
said, assuming there had been developments in the case.

�Mr. Cumber.
Rise and shine, or � were you awake already ?�

His heart
stopped and the phone felt cold and clammy in his palm.

�Who is this
?�

�Oh, come on,
John. You know me. You can call me the Chameleon. You know about Chameleons,
John ? We�re lizards that can change our skin when we need to.�

John sat up
bolt upright in bed. The voice was male, American, quite youthful but composed,
taunting.

�Now listen
here you motherfucker ��

�Sssshhh �
John. Actually that�s very good. Motherfucker ? I suppose I am ! Anyway, don�t
waste our time together. I�m calling from a location you can�t trace and using
a rather special phone but, nevertheless, I�m only going to stay talking for
one minute just in case. The reason for my call is to say well done so far. You
kept my shares above 15 dollars, didn�t you ? Now, do you have my billion
dollars ready for me ?�

John felt the
plastic handset cracking in his grip.

�Yes.�

�Good. In that
case I will send you instructions later today about how to wire me the money.
I�ll be very specific. As you know, I never give unclear instructions.�

�How will you
contact me ?�

�Oooh, don�t
worry your handsome head about that yet.�

John looked at
the luminous second hand of his watch. Over forty seconds had passed.

�How is my
wife, you bastard. And my family ?�

There was a silence,
just deep breathing.

�Please � Tell
me !�

�Actually your
wife is really a surprisingly good fuck, John.�

�You bastard
!�

�Well it�s
funny you should call me that too. Anyway, I want you to ask me nicely to fuck
your wife again.�

John roared
with rage. �You �!�

�Sssssshhh ��
The voice interrupted. �In that case I shall fuck your daughters. In their
arses.�

�Noooh !�

The man on the
end of the line made a �tch !� sound. �Can�t have it both ways, John, it�s
either your wife or girlies, which is it to be ?�

�You fuckhead,
I will kill you.�

�Maybe John,
but I doubt it. Well, time�s up. I guess I�m gonna have to fuck all three of
them ��

�No ! Wait !�

�Gotta go.
Catch you later.�

�Please � f �
please � fuck � my wife.� He bellowed.

�Goood.� The
voice teased. �That wasn�t so difficult was it ? Okay, I�ll give her one from
you. And we�ll continue our little chat soon.�

John stared at
his watch trying to think how to keep the conversation going but all he heard
were three more words.

�Bye for now.�

&nbsp;

Lorna knelt
motionless and silent on the tiled floor. She held her eyes and mouth wide
open. A small acidic burp repeated on her, making her throat gag and triggering
yet another wave of nausea. There were no shackles or ropes holding her
anymore, no spider gags or dental breaches. She was simply being �conditioned�
to do exactly as she had been ordered.

A human
latrine.

The door
opened and one of the mercenaries entered the small, humid room. He was the
shaven headed black one they called Cobra, with his huge frame and belly.

He whistled
and stood with his feet apart in front of her, unzipping his jeans.

She looked up
into his cruel brown eyes obediently, keeping her lips as wide as possible and
her tongue flat on her lower gums to receive him. She knew what was coming. She
dreaded it. No amount of times made it better or easier. Just the stench of
urine made her feel light headed and her throat gagged; the sharp, sour taste
and the acid after-burn that exploded up through her nose making her eyes water.

He grinned
down at her and carefully uncoiled his soft but huge penis onto her tongue.

She knew his
flow would be hot as it funnelled down her throat and windpipe and descended
all the way to her stomach, prompting bitter little burps that would recur afterwards,
bile bubbling back up like a geyser.

Worse was how
she had already started to differentiate between the different men and their
taste and how they varied according to the time of day. Mornings were worst.

She felt the
first fiery squirt against her tonsils.

�Mmmm �� she
heard him exhale, treating her as nothing but his urinal.

The rational,
proud side of her brain screamed; no !

But the
emotional, humiliated side somehow accepts she has no choice, petrified by what
might happen to her if she pulls her mouth away. Frightened for Gene, and Mom,
and Rach� and Ryan. But mostly for herself and the pain of what they might do.

So Lorna knelt
and felt it racing into her gullet, making her eyes stream, trying not to choke
as she swallowed rapidly and it kept filling her mouth, the horrible acrid tang
somehow even worse than she remembered from the previous visitor just ten
minutes before this.

A little
frothed over her lips and down her chin but, somehow, she managed to keep
guzzling until he had finished. She was convinced they all waited until their
bladders were over-full before visiting her. He farted loudly as he shook the
last drips from the end of his length onto her tongue before tucking himself
back into his jeans.

Then he
turned, completely ignoring her, and walked back out into the sunshine.

Doctor
Wolfgang Ernst removed the rubber operating gloves and washed his hands. He
usually preferred to operate in his own very private clinic on the shores of
Lake Geneva but, for his good client and longstanding friend Mister Charles
Victor, Wolfgang was happy to travel. He had spent 25 years specialising in �
er � delicate procedures such as treating wounded mercenaries who were not able
to visit official hospitals, and plastic surgery for criminals who wished to
alter their appearance. This little operation had been straightforward.

Rachel
Cumber�s overly modest 32B breasts had been substantially enhanced. He smiled
down at the sleeping blonde who would soon be coming round from the light
anaesthetic he had used. Her pretty face was still coated in the semen he had
ejaculated over her nose and lips once she was out cold. Amusingly, she was
younger than Wolfgang�s own daughter.

Sure, breast
augmentation techniques usually recommend an increase of one or, at most, two
bra cup sizes. However, he felt that the substantial silicone implants he had
utilized to endow the slim 21 year old with FF cup monsters would soon settle
down and cause no problems.

He admired the
neat 2-inch long incisions his scalpel had made in the underside crease of each
breast, now sutured with dissolvable stitches. Before the operation, the
measurement round her full breasts had been a measly couple of inches more than
the band measurement round her torso underneath her bust.

Now the
difference was a splendid 8 inches ! He smiled; �udders�. The Americans
had such a fixation with big udders.

The girl would
feel uncomfortable for a few days and her breasts would initially be tender,
swollen and unnaturally firm, but he was certain it would not take long for her
to recover fully from the physical effects of the operation.

Of course, the
mental effects might be another matter.

Lenny grinned.


This was all
too easy. Soon he�d be on a plane outta here and then he could relax and enjoy
the charms of the two Cumber girls.

And he�d be a
multi-millionaire. Aged just thirty.

He�d give John
Cumber specific instructions how to wire the money via the internet into the
master account.

It was an
innocent, virgin, 8-digit numbered St. Vincent bank account that would
automatically close as soon as it had received and instantaneously passed on
the billion dollars.

It would split
the money into ten tranches and transfer them to ten numbered bank accounts in
various places including the Cayman Islands, Costa Rica, Anguilla, Turks and
Caicos, Panama and Belize.

In turn, those
accounts would split the money into different, smaller amounts and send it
across the water to the likes of Jersey, Liechtenstein, the Isle of Man,
Gibraltar, Cyprus and Andorra.

They would
repackage it up into altered amounts again and transfer it to accounts in
Macau, Marianas, Vanuatu, Nauru, Labuan and Liberia.

Then the whole
lot would go berserk, batching, slicing, exchanging, splitting and regrouping
the money into and out of several hundred anonymous accounts around the world.
Some of the accounts had been opened a long time and operated innocently for
years, so they wouldn�t attract anybody�s attention.

Years of
planning.

By the time
the whole steaming bowl of financial spaghetti had been served and covered with
a sauce of dummy accounts, closed accounts, transfers, reverse transfers,
conversion into Euros, Yen, Sterling and Swiss Francs, and a few laundering
tricks that only the very best people knew, the billion dollars ransom would be
as shiny as a new pin.

Much of it
residing, like some fat cat tax exile, in oh-so-respectable Switzerland.

It was only
fair.

His
inheritance.

PART SIX:

�Six-Chambered
Heart�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

�One
for the love, Two for the hate

Three
for the blood that I can�t circulate

Four
for the fear, Five for the brave

Six,
chamber six contains an open space�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Melanie had
fought.

It was
strange. From pre-puberty, her darkest, secret, unspoken sexual fantasies had
been about control and rape and �bdsm�, not that she knew the term back then if
it even existed. She had been too ashamed to reveal such thoughts to Charlie
but she�d figured she would finally do so once they were married. In them she
had sometimes been the aggressor and other times the victim.

Reality was
totally different.

Her karma.

He wasn�t like
a rapist of her imagination. He was calm, almost disinterested, pretty much
jacking off inside her. He simply held her wrists on the ground and writhed
about on top, his erection hard and painful within her unwilling flesh.

When he
flooded her he had given her an almost quizzical look as if he couldn�t
understand why on earth she might object to him using her. Him. John fucking
Cumber, the college stud and every girl�s dream.

Afterwards he
had been embarrassed but not repentant. He made her rinse herself in the lake,
destroying the evidence. Smiling, he threatened to tell her boyfriend that she
had been willing participant, that she had loved it.

Perhaps he
really even thought she had ?

�And if
Charlie comes after me,� he said, nonchalantly tucking his shirt back in, �I
will kill him. Trust me.�

John Cumber
sat staring at the screens. Alongside him Walt Furness, two other Agents, plus
several investment bankers and John�s senior executives were all watching the
Corporations� share price tick up and down around the $15 dollars level.

Silence
chilled the room as John�s phone rang.

The cell�s
digital display was blank again.

�Yes.� He
answered, all eyes on him. One of the Agents triggered the tracking technology
that had been set up.

�John.� Said
the smooth, taunting male voice. Already experts had identified it from the
earlier tape as definitely an American national, accent most likely Southern
Californian, the inflexion and vocabulary estimated at mid-thirties or under.

�Yes.�

�I will say
this once. You have ten minutes and I want to see one billion dollars in the
following bank account.�

The voice gave
the name of a bank on the Caribbean island of St. Vincent. The number of the
8-digit account was the same as that day�s date in American format: May 28th,
2007.

0-5-2-8-2-0-0-7.

�If it doesn�t
arrive, John, we will never speak again. Gotta go.�

�Wait !�

There was a
calm pause. �Yes ?�

�What about my
family ? My children ? And my wife ? How do I know you�ll free them once I�ve
paid you the money.�

There was a
chuckle. �You don�t.�

�But you have
to give me some �� John Cumber clenched his fists, losing it in
exasperation and rage. Walt Furness reached out for the phone but John flapped
his hand away.

�Come on,
John.� The voice said, a sudden coldness entering his tone. �You�ll love it.
Trust me.�

Charlie sat
hunched over the screen reading the story. It was good. Well written, at least
in his opinion. Sure it was violent and explicit but then, that was what this
porno site seemed to be all about.

He clicked
again and returned to the Author�s page.

�Famous
Blue Raincoat�.

There were ten
stories listed in all. The one he had just finished was his favourite so far.
He liked the title.

�Two out of
three ain�t bad.�

Set in 1849, a
brave Californian Gold Rush heroine had been raped and lost her husband,
friends and wagon train to Red Indian raiders but she managed to save herself
and her son.

The website
offered a facility that allowed you to email the author.

With a deep
breath, �Red Mist� started tapping at his keyboard.

Susan knelt
and licked the woman�s labia. They hung open, unwashed, sweaty, giving off an
odour like a dish of stinking fish and ripe cheese.

Whatever it
was that motivated these people it wasn�t just money. It couldn�t be. It
wasn�t even just sex. It was something else. Something that made them
want every moment, every act, to be as awful as it could be.

The woman
could easily have washed, showered, even just wiped herself. But she has chosen
not to, and Susan thought that had to be calculated.

Bile rose up
from her stomach to tear at her throat and she gulped the acid back down. There
were just the two of them now, outdoors on a private terrace in the sunshine.

She felt sharp
nails digging into her scalp, guiding her head.

�Lick, bitch.
Make it good for me or I�ll cut off your little boy�s bollocks and feed them to
you.�

Susan swirled
her tongue and then drilled it, pointed, as deep as she could. She considered
lesbianism disgusting, immoral. A sheen of fresh perspiration covered the
woman�s inner thighs, making them slick and wet against Susan�s cheeks. She
guessed the woman was between forty five and fifty. In quite good shape,
probably fitness trained by the men. Nevertheless, strangely she seemed to be
in charge, along with the horrible man they referred to as the Chameleon.

Her knees
throbbed and her ankles ached from kneeling in the same position for so long.
Her mind was delirious with fatigue and hunger and shame and worry, her tongue
was numb. She had been doing this for half an hour since breakfast, but the
woman seemed in no rush to reach a climax.

She winced as
the woman ran her long fingernails through Susan�s hair.

How much
more of this could she take ?

Charlie licked
his dry lips.

You have
one new message.

He clicked it
open.

&nbsp;

�Dear Red
Mist,

Thanks for
your email. It�s always nice for authors to receive feedback like yours. I�m
glad you enjoyed �Two out of Three Ain�t Bad� in particular. I don�t know your
age but that was the title of a song by Meatloaf when I was younger. In fact
the whole story is kind of based around what I feel about that era. The
Seventies. Anyway, feel free to email me direct if you have any more comments
or ideas.

Famous Blue
Raincoat.�

&nbsp;

Charlie
cracked a beer and began his response to her.

They exchanged
emails, to and fro, for several weeks. Gradually it ceased being an impersonal
dialogue and became correspondence between friends, even though they were two
faceless persons either side of a screen.

At least,
that�s how it seemed.

&nbsp;

One morning,
he awoke and fired up his PC. It was dawn in Europe. She had sent her reply
from California long after he turned in for the night.

&nbsp;

�Dear Red
Mist,

Thanks for
your last email. You�re correct, I do write from the heart. I have recently
been working on a new story. It�s called �Sow the Wind, Reap the Whirlwind.�
That�s based on a line from the Old Testament in the Bible. It�s kind of
inspired by something that happened to me many years ago. Not that �inspired�
is really the right word. I�m over it now, pretty much. But it still hurts coz
it screwed up my life. So I write to get help get it out of my system. Anyway,
gotta go. Write again soon.

Yours, FBR.�

&nbsp;

Sow the
wind, reap the whirlwind !

Charlie
felt goose pimples up his spine as he started typing.

That evening,
he received her reply.

&nbsp;

�Dear RM,

Wow ! This is
all pretty intense. I�ve never told anybody any of this stuff before. Somehow
it feels easier the fact I don�t know you. You�re my anonymous, unpaid
psychiatrist ! How�s that feel ? Cheap, heh ? LOL. Anyway, you asked for it.
The truth behind much of my writing is that I was raped. Many years ago now ��

&nbsp;

The hairs
on the back of Charlie�s hands stood bolt upright.

&nbsp;

�The rape
itself was bad enough, but the consequences were worse. I lost the love of my
life. I couldn�t tell him I�d been raped. Well, could I have done ? I don�t
know now. What�s done is done. You can�t wind the clock back. My boyfriend had
this dangerous streak below the surface. Besides, the guy who raped me
threatened he�d kill my boyfriend if I told anyone. But my boyfriend could tell
something was up. So I stupidly admitted I�d had this one night stand. I
thought he�d understand. I was young and na�ve. So we broke up. And he�s never
spoken to me again. I could forget the rape now, almost, but I can�t because
I�m still living with its consequences every day. My heart contains this open
space for him that has never been filled. I bet you�re sorry you asked now. Sob
stories ain�t so much fun as bdsm stories, right ? Must cut it short. My son�s
home from school early. I hope to hear from you again soon.

FBR.�

&nbsp;

For the first
time, Charlie didn�t start typing immediately. He sat, staring at the screen
for maybe an hour, he wasn�t sure. Time stopped. Eventually, he undressed,
wearily removing each item of clothing in a daze, and stood under a cold shower
for ten minutes. The razor needles of freezing water cut into his scarred,
muscled skin like shards of ice, dulling his brain yet sharpening his senses to
fever pitch.

He had always
loved soaking in hot baths after a battle, steaming away his aches and pains,
washing away the blood.

But showers he
best enjoyed cold. Hurting, setting his own blood racing.

Preparing
him for war.

He ran his
fingers through his hair.

He was poorer
by one billion dollars. Repeat that: US$ 1,000,000,000. That�s one fuckin�
thousand fuckin� million green ones.

Walt Furness
put his hand down on John�s shoulder. There were now just the two of them in
the room.

�John.� Walt
said. �We have confirmation. The money�s arrived. As I suspected, formally the
bank is refusing us access but they have confirmed - off the record - the
account is already empty again.�

John shrugged.
Trust me, the voice had said.

�I�ve put some
good guys on it.� Walt continued. �The best. But I�m afraid the chance of us
tracing it through the maze is pretty much zero. I don�t know who this guy is
but I know two things. One, he�s not alone. And two, whoever they are,
they know what they�re doing.�

He looked up
at Walt and gave him a silent nod of agreement.

�John ?� Walt
said, his tone changing. �John, I gotta ask. Do you recall what the guy said at
the end of the call ?�

He sighed. The words hung in the air
between them.

Sure he remembered.

Walt looked him firmly in the eyes.

�He said; come on John. You�ll love it.
Trust me.�

John tried to meet his gaze.

�You have any
idea what he meant, John ? �You�ll love it�. That�s kind of a strange thing for
somebody to say. You have any idea at all what that means ?�

&nbsp;

�Trust me.�
Said Gator, brandishing his machine pistol. �We know how to use these things.
And these too.� He gestured to his belt where a machete hung menacingly in a
leather scabbard.

Around the
swimming pool, they had painted five sets of feet in pink paint. Like the Pink
Panther�s footprints ! The rule was that each of the five �guests� had to stand
on a designated pair of footprints and not leave them.

�Step off the
prints,� Gator threatened, pointing at a bamboo crop, �and the person next to
you gets fifty lashes with that.�

They were
arranged with Susan Cumber at the head of the pool. Her breasts hung heavy with
blotches and her pubic mound was bald.

Next to her,
on one side of the pool stood her olive complexioned, brunette, elder daughter
Lorna.

About twenty
feet along was Lorna�s pallid, redheaded fianc� Gene.

At the shallow
end of the rectangular pool was a viewing gallery of seats, occupied by most of
the mercenaries, dressed in their usual mix of combat shirts and khaki shorts,
ripped Ts and leathers.

Next, opposite
Gene, stood naked Ryan Cumber, tall, handsome son and heir.

Finally,
opposite Lorna and next to their mother was blonde, top-heavy, younger daughter
Rachel. Her new, mammoth mammaries had triggered shocked gasps from her family
and raucous jeers from the male audience.

All five
prisoners were nude, bodies glistening in the hot sun, feet wide apart on the
pink prints, arms up, with their fingers laced behind their heads.

The time
for cuffs, ropes, cells and privacy was over.

�Silence.�
Gator bellowed. �For your host please � the Chameleon !�

It was
numbingly hot under the mask, but Charlie wore it for effect, for a sense of
drama. Not all five guests had seen his face yet.

He stood at
the shallow end of the pool, directly opposite Susan.

�Well, folks,
I have some good news, and some bad news.�

He did his
best to convey a smile by cocking his masked head to one side.

�Let�s get the
bad news out of the way first, shall we ? I�m afraid that your beloved husband
and father, John Cumber, has failed to come up with our money ��

�No !� Lorna
gasped, moving both hands to cover her face.

Charlie paused
threateningly for effect until the girl had snapped her hands back behind her
head.

�You will be
punished for that interruption shortly. As will anybody else who moves, speaks
or utters any noise out of turn. Nod if you all understand ?�

Five heads
bobbed up and down.

�As I was
saying, John Cumber has failed to pay your ransom. He�s asked for more time which
I have been gracious enough to grant him.�

He halted
briefly again, giving them time to appreciate his generosity.

�So, now the
good news. He has offered Susan to me as � er � interest on the money in the
meantime.�

It was evident
that young Ryan in particular was desperate to object but the boy managed to
control himself, staring across enraged, mouth agape.

�Listen.�
Charlie said.

There was a
slight crackle from two outdoor speakers fixed on the wall.

�No ! Wait
!� John Cumber�s recorded voice floated clearly
over the pool water as if he was actually there with all of them.

�Gotta go.
Catch you later.� A male voice replied over the
speakers.

�Please � f
� please � fuck � my wife.� John Cumber pleaded.

The tape
excerpt finished almost as soon as it had begun.

The Chameleon
opened his palms to imply �I told you so�.

�But I
understand that Susan has something to add that will help keep all my friends
patient too.� He turned and gestured to the grinning, watching Reptiles. �Isn�t
that correct, Susie doll ?�

Susan Cumber
grimaced and nodded her head, lip quivering.

�What is it,
Susie ? Out with it.�

�Please � f � please
� fuck my daughters too.� She pleaded, then burst into tears.

�Dear Red
Mist,

You asked
about my son. He�s really the crux of the story. He was born nine months after
the rape. I couldn�t take the pill and my boyfriend and I had always used
rubbers or him just pulling out. Remember this was the Seventies. The rapist
made me wash the evidence in a scummy lake afterwards and I assumed I�d got rid
of everything. But a couple of months later, I�m definitely pregnant. So I�m
back home, not yet 19 years old, knocked up, with a rapist�s kid in my belly
when everybody thought I�d had a one-night-stand. Fucked, or what ? My
parents wouldn�t consider an abortion, so I had my son.

And here the
story gets even more twisted. After he�s born, I love him of course, but I
still think his father raped me. But when he�s six months old, I see a smile, a
distinctive look. I only had a few mementos of my boyfriend. One was a lock of
his hair, entwined with a strand of mine, that I kept in a little silver box.
Back then DNA testing was less advanced and available but I lied about a
possible genetic illness and the hospital had my son analysed.

Guess what ?�

&nbsp;

The words
blurred on the screen as Charlie Victor wiped his eye.

&nbsp;

�My son is
after all my boyfriend�s child. From probably the very last time we ever made
love. And yet his father doesn�t know it. Never will. And so my son doesn�t
have his father, and the love of my life doesn�t know he has a son. All because
a bastard raped me, when he could have fucked pretty much any other chick and
she wouldn�t have minded. Sick, huh ?

But you know
the final twist ? The sickest part of all ? That boy who raped me ? He�s turned
into some hugely successful guy, rich and famous, and every few weeks I glance
by mistake at the newspaper headlines in a drug store, or catch the news on TV,
and there I see his damned face grinning out at me, like it did the night he
ruined my life.

And you know
what, it makes me want to ruin his. Forgive me, but it really does. So, because
of course I sadly can�t do that in real life, I�m writing about it instead.

And that, Red
Mist, is my story.�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Before long,
the poolside orgy was in full swing.

The
mercenaries smoked, swigged bottles of chilled beer and basked in the hot
sunshine, watching the three tableaux. Music blared out from the speakers;
appropriately Jeff Booze�s �Carving my Name in the Sun� album.

&nbsp;

One tableau
featured the homosexual coupling of Gene and Ryan.

Eel, one of
the Reptiles, was directing proceedings for the camera. Ryan had reluctantly
sucked his �brother-in-law-to-be� to erection and he was now on all fours on a
sun bed, grimacing as Gene sawed his penis into and out of his sweating, oiled
and virgin anus.

Eel gave them
the script under the prompting of his cattle prod.

�Oh yeah !�
Ryan gasped. �Man that�s good Gene. Fuck my ass.�

�Gonna give it
to you good, butt loving bro.� Gene grunted cornily.

&nbsp;

The second
scene starred Susan Cumber in a solo performance.

Alone with a
huge, green, glistening cucumber.

She was lying
back on a sun bed, her legs as splayed as she could get them, ramming the
vegetable dildo to and fro inside her bald cunt.

Two cameras
were on her; one close up on her face, the other between her thighs, its
microphone picking up every slosh and slush as it disappeared inside her then
emerged, distorting her wet labia.

�My name is
Susan Cumber and I love a cucumber.� She chanted.

&nbsp;

The final
coupling was an incestuous lesbian 69 by Lorna and Rachel.

The two naked
chicks were lying on a double sun bed, with the elder girl below and her
younger sister�s pussy riding her face. Rachel was grinding her hips up and
down while she knelt forward and buried her lips in the �v� of Lorna�s thighs.
Rachel�s pendulous FF-cup tits hung down like bruised tropical fruit, now
totally out of proportion with her slim frame. But Lorna was reaching up
fondling them, while both girls moaned ecstatically.

�Mmm � make me
come, Sis�, pleass ��

Another pair
of cameras recorded their action in great detail. A third lens was set up
further away on a tripod to get a long shot of the two girls enjoying
cunnilingus in the foreground, while their mum frigged herself with a foot long
cucumber just behind them.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Completely
unaware of what was happening several thousand miles east at that precise
moment, John Cumber�s shoulders sagged.

Trust me,
the voice had said.

�Walt. That
list of people I gave you. My possible enemies.�

The grizzled
Agent looked at him expectantly.

�I have one
more idea.� John continued. �A long shot. But there was a woman. Well a girl.
Her name was � is � as far as I know � Melanie � Jones, I think.�

�Yeah ?� Walt
replied, after a silence.

�It�s something
that happened a long time ago. I�m kind of ashamed now. I was young. But I said
those exact words to her; You�ll love it, trust me.�

�You sure ?�

�Sure as I am
sat here now. I can remember saying them.�

�And ? The
caller was a guy.�

�She had a
boyfriend. Charlie something. I forget what. We were all at college together.
Like I said, a long shot. But I thought I should mention it.�

Walt nodded.
�This Melanie � Jones, you think. You any idea where she lives now ?�

John shook his
head. �None at all. But I think her family lived in California. Some suburb of
L.A.�

Walt looked
coldly at him. The regret and guilt in John�s eyes was unavoidable.

�You�ll
love it, trust me.�

Uneasily, the
two men shifted apart from each other.

�I�ll get onto
it right away.�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The five
victims were kneeling in a line on the pool deck eating �lunch�.

They were down
on all fours in front of a piece of plastic guttering that had been set up on
brick piers to make a trough.

Even though
all five were starving, none of them would have chosen to eat the swill that
had been set before them, but several of the mercenaries sidled up and down the
line, armed with electric cattle prods and leather riding crops to force them
to guzzle it all down �hands-free�, using just their mouths, faces like swine
in the trough.

The sickening
stench of the swill in the midday heat, swarming with flies, was overpowering.
The Bedouin tribesmen who roam the huge, barren landscape are infamous for
wasting nothing in the harsh environment. The basic ingredient of the mix was
goat�s intestine. It had been boiled to cleanse it then lightly fried in a
batter of blood and giblets and guts.

The final
garnish was supplied direct from a couple of the mercenaries. They jacked
themselves off and spewed copious lines of jizz over the contents of the trough
while the victims knelt and patiently watched their meal being served.

�Eat up
Susie.� Gator now cooed, crouching behind her.

He watched her
bow her head, slurping up an unwanted mouthful.

�Goooood.� He
enthused. His calloused hands reached under her, fondling her big hanging tits
while he lined his dick up.

�Mmmm.� He
exhaled, pushing himself into her moist cunt from behind.

Susan kept
chewing as her gagging face was pushed into the mix.

Either side of
Susan, her two daughters glanced uneasily out of the corners of their eyes as
Gator began plunging in and out of their mom.

�Eat up,
little Susie, eat up little Susie.� He hummed to the rhythm of an old song,
gripping her hair and shoving her head down hard.

Following his
example, Gecko and Skink, two other mercenaries got down behind Lorna and
Rachel and mounted them.

�Aaa �� Rachel
squealed as her sore, inexperienced cunt was rammed.

�Man that�s
tight pussy.� Skink, a muscular black man exclaimed in appreciation, sinking
himself into the young blonde ex-socialite, cupping her huge breasts in his
palms and bouncing them like basketballs.

Viper stood
the other side of the gutter and unzipped himself. He was holding a can of beer
in one hand and a burning cigarette in the other.

�Excuse me
lads.� He said, laying down the can and fishing his penis out. �A bit more
gravy ?� A stream of lager-fuelled urine jetted into the gutter, replenishing
the slops of offal and brown sauce.

As he
finished, Rachel Cumber let rip a choking gutteral sound and spewed up a geyser
of green-brown vomit that steamed into the mixture.

�Aw, fuck !�
Gator, Gecko and Skink exclaimed in unison.

The prisoners
all stopped eating and stared from one to the other then up at Viper. Drool
hung from Rachel�s lips and she almost heaved again.

Chuckling,
Viper flicked his cigarette ash onto it and then began stirring the whole lot
up with his machete in front of the five horrified faces.

�Hurry up and
finish eating.� He sneered coldly down at them. �Or I can feel a dump coming on
!�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Inside the
chilled, air-conditioned bedroom suite overlooking the swimming pool, Charlie
turned from the window, sat down at his PC and chuckled.

What a
bunch, he thought.

He had invited
some online buddies to a web cam broadcast of Rachel�s next ordeal. The young
lady had some catching up to do with her mom and sister. What better way to
enjoy the fun than by getting some ideas for the next part of her training ? He
tapped hurriedly onto the keyboard.

�Ladies and
Gentlemen, may I have your suggestions please ?�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

PART SEVEN:

�Reptile�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

�She
spread herself wide open to let the insects in

She
leaves a trail of honey to show me where she�s been

She
has the blood of reptile just underneath her skin

Seeds
from a thousand others drip down from within.�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The Lonely Man
licked his lips with anticipation.

He was sat
alone in his dark one room apartment in a small, Midwestern town. His table was
littered with the detritus of his solitary life; spent cartons of old takeaway
meals and delivery pizzas, unwashed plates and overflowing ashtrays, empty cans
and scrunched up tissues. The blinds were down and the air in the room hung
heavy with the reek of musty carpets, stale tobacco smoke and body odour.

But, to hand,
he had a nice new chilled six-pack of beer, two packets of cigarettes still in
their cellophane, and a warm burger in a bag.

In the centre
of it all stood his pride and joy; a 22-inch wide screen monitor hooked up to
the PC below the table.

He logged onto
a new site he had been introduced to. He tapped out his moniker and lit up a
cig while he waited for approval.

A minute later
the message �Welcome Lonely Man� appeared.

It was
followed by an empty Password box.

He entered his
security pass and waited thirty seconds or so.

Finally, he
was in.

He could see
there were already twelve of them online. All his favourite people in the
world; Mengele, Yakuza, Nine Inch Nail, Hoffman, Bondage 666 and others.

The words �Hi
lonely.� appeared.

�Hi guys.� He
typed, exhaling a ring of cigarette smoke, watching his response emerge along
the bottom of the screen.

He pulled out
a tissue and wiped his sweating forehead. Then, slowly, almost reverently, he
lifted up his other pride and joy. It was a plastic mouth that he lowered
carefully onto his dick. It was a top of the range, battery-powered blowjob
device. As soon as he flicked the power control, his darling �girl who never
said no� would start licking and sucking him to heaven.

The screen
flickered and a new name was online: the most important one of all.

�Hi Red Mist.�
He rushed to type on everybody�s behalf.

�Hi guys.� 

Then he could
see that the screen had switched to web cam mode. The site was broadcasting. A
real voice repeated the typed words.

�Hi guys.�

The speaker
used a voice distortion box but the words were easy to understand; deep,
asthmatic, electronic, like Darth Vader from Star Wars.

�Welcome
friends. Are you ready for some action tonight ?�

Whimpering
with excitement, the Lonely Man slid the power control of his plastic girl on
at its lowest setting. It hummed softly round his dick. How did it compare with
the real thing ? The Lonely Man didn�t know and didn�t care. This was without
doubt the best sex he could imagine.

On the screen,
a camera panned over the naked female body. She was strung out along a medieval
style rack, her arms and legs outstretched, connected to wooden axles that
could be turned further and tightened.

Her pale flesh
glowed with perspiration, her muscles taught with apprehension, her head almost
totally covered in a black leather hood. She was naked but for the hood and a
shiny black bikini and thong.

From the top
of the hood a blonde ponytail emerged, plaited into a guiding leash. And from
the mouth slit, a cruel steel �spider gag� forced her red glossed lips wide
open, revealing her pearly white teeth and pink tongue.

What a
twisted bitch, volunteering for this. He wondered vaguely what she looked like.
It was hard to imagine she could actually be as hot as the visible parts
suggested. He�d wager her actual face underneath was chanky.

He whimpered
again, staring at the girl�s taut ribcage and humongous cleavage in the leather
bikini. Slowly a black-gloved hand appeared from out of shot and cranked the
top axle a few degrees, making the rack creak and her stretched mouth gasp.

�So, are we
all ready ?� The distorted voice asked. �I would like to remind you that our
friend here stated there should be no limits and she asked that you all be as
imaginative as possible.�

The Lonely Man
slid his power control down a notch and moaned; not yet, please, not yet.

�May I have
the first suggestion please.�

&nbsp;

***
*** ***

&nbsp;

Rachel tried
to scream again but the gag reduced her howl to a saliva-choked gurgle.

�That�s a fun
idea.� The electronic baritone echoed above her hood.

Her muscles
burned as she tried to spread her thighs and thrust her hips upwards to ease
the angle for the clenched fist as it wormed its way inside her.

And then she
felt a searing agony the like of which she�d never even dreamed of. It was like
fire, tearing, ripping, cooking her vagina.

She heard
disembodied laughter from the audience over the speakers. She couldn�t see
through her claustrophobic hood but she knew people were watching over some
kind of computer link-up.

�Now her ass
!� an excited voice urgently beseeched.

She quivered
helplessly on the rack as she felt a thick digit invading her bottom and in
seconds a terrible flamethrower of agony gutted her rectum. Again she tried to
scream but to no avail.

Cue more
uproarious laughter.

�A five minute
break, gentlemen.� Said the man in the room with her. �And then the insects
will be served !�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Charlie
surveyed the house from his hired Chevy through military issue binoculars. It
was a sultry, red-skied evening; Friday, 31st March 1995. He could
see her through the window. She was almost 37 now and yet she still looked so
much like the 18 year old girl he�d first set eyes on half their lifetimes ago.
Boy, how much he�d loved her then. And how much he�d hated her after.

And now ?

Now that he
knew the truth ?

He realised
his hands were bending the steering wheel. Truth was, he loved her, always had
and always would. Proportion, like many things, had never been his strong
point. He had punished her unduly. And punished himself unduly. And yet the
only person who should be punished was �

Well, that
could wait a while. One-two-three-breathe.

Truth was he
had never married and had never loved anybody else. Nor had she.

And above all,
he had punished his Son. The Son he didn�t know. The Son who didn�t know his
father. The Son she had named after their favourite singer-songwriter. The poet
whose music they first made love to.

Leonard Cohen.

And the Son
who would celebrate his 18th Birthday the very next day.

Slowly,
Charlie climbed out of the Chevy, locked it and started towards the house.

He had spent
almost twenty years engaged in some of the most terrifying warfare and ruthless
hand-to-hand combat in global history. Not once had anything frightened him. He
had always laughed in the face of danger.

After all,
he never had anything to lose.

And he
wondered what his Lover and Son would say when he appeared at their door after
all this time.

Would Famous
Blue Raincoat take Red Mist back ?

Or would he
lose his Family forever ?

Suddenly,
without any warning, Charles Victor felt real fear.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

It was a
modest 1960s timber house on the lower slopes of the Hollywood Hills, ten
minutes from Sunset.

The combined
FBI and LAPD team surrounded the house and yard and then the lead agents bust
in the front and back doors simultaneously.

The place was
registered to Ms. Melanie Jones and locals confirmed that she had lived there
alone with her son for twenty plus years.

Five minutes
after the forced entry, it was apparent that neither Ms. Jones nor her son was
in. Furthermore, neither had been home in quite a while.

Over the
following 24 hours, it was to become apparent that the place had been
�cleansed� by total professionals. There was nothing left to indicate anything
personal about the people who had lived there; no clothes, no books, no PC, no
music, no papers, no tins of food, no cans of drink.

�Walt.� Said
the West Coast Head to his boss back east.

�It�s like a
show home. Just basic furniture. Table, chairs, sofa, bed without sheets. Not
new. Used, but totally clean. Like nobody ever lived here yet.�

�Well dust the
damned place again.� Walt Furness replied, exasperated.

�That�s it,
Sir. We have. Twice. And we haven�t found a single print or hair.�

There was a
silence.

�But there�s a
note. It was found glued to the underside of the kitchen table. Typed. No
prints on the sheet of paper. Just eight words in large font.�

�What did it
say ?�

�The trail
stops here. Trust us. The Chameleon.�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Susan Cumber
knelt while the collar was sealed round her neck.

The woman she
had come to know as her Nemesis smiled.

�There we are.
Now we don�t have to worry about chains and ropes and all that stuff. Look !�

Susan choked,
unable to breathe, as an electric current coursed from the top of her spine
down her nervous system to her feet. She fell forwards face first onto the
floor, trying but failing to scream.

�If you take
one step outside this compound, that�s what will happen. Get up !�

Slowly, Susan
struggled back onto her knees, gagging.

�Pl � zzz ��
she groaned. �No m � more. My husband w � will get you your money, I promise.�

The woman
laughed, tucking the controller for the electric tag collar into her belt.

�Oh yes. I
forgot. Thanks. The money arrived safe and sound some time ago. We�re all
multimillionaires.�

Susan shook
her head, struggling to hear and comprehend.

�Wha � ?�

�Yes, good old
John. He�s done his part. Now you just have to complete your part of the deal.�

My part ?
Surely �

�I don�t un �
understand ��

The woman
smiled like a mother explaining homework to her kid.

�Look. Your
husband had to pay to buy you all the opportunity to earn your freedom.
But now he�s done that, you still have to do your bit.�
�Wh � what do we have to do ?�

�Well, we�re
going to be here for a while. You see the money is a bit hot so we have to wait
for it to chill.� The woman reached and lifted Susan�s chin with her fingers so
that both of them were looking into the other�s eyes. �You see, even money is
best enjoyed cold.�

�H � how long
?� Susan gasped.

The woman
shrugged. �I�m not sure. A year or so. Maybe a bit longer.�

Unable to stop
herself, Susan wailed. �Noooooo � nooooooo !�

A short,
milder shock soon brought her under control.

�I must warn
you that outbursts like that will only extend your sentence. You have just
added one whole month to your thirteen months stay. �

Completely
defeated, Susan simply hung her head like a punch drunk boxer. Be strong !
Be strong for Rachel, Lorna, Ryan. And John.

�Good.� Her
Nemesis said. �Now, a few new rules. While here, you will make yourself useful.
You will work 18/7. That�s eighteen hours a day, seven days a week. Your duties
will include anything and everything, from domestic chores, to performing
massages to � naturally � any sexual demands that are required. Is that
understood ?�

Susan merely
stared at her, mouth frozen slightly open.

�Is that
understood ?�

Her hand shot
up to her cheek to caress where she had been slapped.

�Y � yes.�

�And when I
say any sexual demands, I mean �any�.�

The woman
waited, clearly expecting a response.

Susan bobbed
her head slowly up and down.

�Yes � any.�
She mumbled.

�Well, that�s
all clear then. Let�s go put you straight to work.�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

There was
excitement in the room at last !

After days of
no progress, the investigation finally had something to go on.

Eighty agents
and officers were being addressed by Walt Furness.

�Leonard
Jones.�

He pointed at
an image of a man wearing a Fedex uniform, looking straight into the lens of
what was clearly an office lobby CCTV and sticking his long, lizard-like tongue
out. The man was grey haired, clean shaven and he appeared to be middle aged,
maybe mid to late forties.

Walt Furness
pressed a button and produced a new slide. It showed a different, younger,
clean cut, quite handsome youth of around thirty.

�Leonard
Jones.� Walt repeated with irony. �Same guy, different appearance. Ladies and
gents, we are dealing with a master of disguise. Or to use his chosen handle, a
Chameleon.�

There was the
sound of shuffling, murmurs, sideways glances.

�And Homeland
Security has reason to believe he is currently still residing within the United
States.�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Six of the
reptiles were playing poker in the shade; Gator, the man with the missing ear,
Cobra, the huge black man with the shaved head, Gecko, the heavily tattooed
Russian, and three others.

The atmosphere
was intense. Large piles of chips were stacked in front of several players and
increasingly smaller ones belonged to the rest. It was evident that the
millions each man now possessed in his foreign bank accounts were being wagered
on No Limits Texas Hold�Em.

Skink, a
Nigerian mercenary, surveyed the table with a motionless, poker face.

�Raise.� He
said, pushing several $10,000 chips forward.

Gator laughed.
�Gotcha !�

Skink froze,
then grinned and looked down between his thighs. Lorna Cumber�s head was glued
to his waist. Now that his side bet was lost, Skink relaxed and forgot about
trying to hide his orgasm from the table. He groaned and seized the chica�s
long hair, pumping her head up and down on his dick.

�Blow her
fuckin� head off, Skink.� Gecko encouraged.

�Man it�s
coming out her ears.�

Skink pulled
and twisted her hair so that her face appeared above the rim of the table, lips
closed tight, gulping his seed.

Everybody
laughed. Skink pushed a $10,000 chip over to Gator.

�Your turn,
Gate. Now let�s see you keep a straight face !�

He pushed
Lorna back under the table towards Gator�s seat.

�Get going
bitch � Now, I think I just raised you all.�

�

&nbsp;

The young FBI
agent was quivering with excitement.

�Sir.� He
said, holding a printed piece of paper out to Walt Furness and John Cumber. �We
have him.�

There it was. In
black and white.

A reservation
had been made for a Mr. Len C. Jones on American Airlines, Flight 1385, from
New York to Bridgetown, Barbados. Departing JFK the next morning at 09.55 hrs.

�The ticket
was purchased with cash from a midtown Manhattan travel agent two days ago.�

John Cumber
punched his right fist into his left palm and muttered �yessss�.

�It�s a single
ticket, Sir. One way.�

�Barbados ?�
Walt mused, stroking his chin.

�The nearest
international airport to St. Vincent, Sir.� 

�Where my
fucking billion dollars was wired.�

The young
agent grinned at them both with a triumphant flourish.

�There�s more,
gentlemen. A small 4-seater jet has been chartered from SVG Airlines to fly
from Grantley Adams Airport, Bridgetown, Barbados to E.T. Joshua Airport in
Kingstown, St. Vincent, tomorrow afternoon.�

He paused for
effect. �To fly a single passenger. Chartered by a certain Lennie Jones.�

Walt looked at
the agent and then at John Cumber.

�Let�s go hunt
our reptile guys !�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Susan stared
in horror.

�This is your
bathroom.� Melanie said, thrilled by the expression on Susan�s face. �Now that
y�all gonna be around for a while, you and your boys will need somewhere to do
your stuff.�

The squalid
room had not been touched in maybe thirty years. It was an ancient, open plan
washroom with two toilet pans, two stand up urinals, two shower heads and two
basins with unframed pieces of mirror above. Everything was filthy, stained,
rusted, cracked and decrepit. The overflowing toilet pans had no seats or
covers. The urinals and basins were yellowed by years of dripping. The shower
heads oozed slime.

The entire
concrete floor swam with liquid; water, or worse. Decades old cigarette butts,
scraps of newspaper, toilet roll and stinking mush had clogged the toilets and
urinals. Graffiti scrawled in excrement adorned the grungy walls.

�I�m going to
lock you in here ��

Susan turned
her face to look. �B � but ��

� � with one
bucket, a rag and a bottle of disinfectant. And I�m giving you two hours. When
I come back, the whole place had better be beautifully clean. Or else.�

&nbsp;

�Take the
strain.� Leatherback announced.

Several
mercenaries were watching and gambling on the �tug of war�.

�Heave�.

Ryan Cumber
and Gene Collins were connected by a length of cord tied tightly round the
shafts of their penises. The cords were a blend of nylon and wire, incredibly
strong, and they were coiled tight underneath the rim of each purple helmet to
prevent them slipping off. Each boy had been given Viagra to help him maintain
an erection through the pain.

�Aagh.� They
screeched and gasped in unison.

Croc and Boa
lashed crops against each lad�s defenceless body.

�Pull, you
fucker. My money�s riding on you.�

It was no
contest really. Ryan was six plus and muscled while Gene was five seven and
puny. But a couple of mercenaries were relying on Gene, if flogged
sufficiently, causing an upset at generous odds.

Oh well, it
seemed a harmless way of passing a sultry afternoon.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Lennie sat
back in a First Class seat for the first time in his life.

He admired the
blonde stewardess who served him a glass of champagne, as she leaned over to
ensure he got a nice view of her deep cleavage.

He felt a
twinge in his groin as he imagined reaching out and grabbing her tits. Like he
would soon be able to do to those Cumber bitches.

Out through
the oval window by his side he could see frantic activity as the baggage
handlers and airline staff filled the plane with suitcases and fuel.

He felt no
emotion, no Star Spangled banner. It was goodbye and good luck as far as he was
concerned. God bless America but he doubted he would ever set foot on her rich
soil again.

Now he had
riches of his own.

A male steward
suddenly brandishing a clipboard gave him a shock.

He smiled down
at Lennie momentarily. Like he fancied him.

�Monsieur
Kohn.� The steward said. �Bienvenue.�

Lennie peered
back up at him through his dark glasses and flashed his best white teeth smile.
�Er � Merci�.

�Vous etes
Americain ?�

�Nao. Eu sou
Brasileiro.� Lennie replied in his well-rehearsed Portuguese. Lennie�s
temporary skin colour was mulatto and he had a sharp goatee to compliment his
wiry black hair. Every inch a Brazilian. �But � er � I can speak a leedel
English.�

The steward
gaily flipped into a mix of token Portuguese and flawless English himself.

�Bemvindo
abordo, Senor Kohn. Enjoy the flight.�

�Obrigado.�

�I will leave
you the menu and entertainment guide. If I can be of any assistance, please do
not hesitate to call me.�

Sixteen
minutes later, with typically Swiss precision, at exactly 19.55, the Airbus
A330-200 that was Swissair Flight 65 took off on time from Miami on its
overnight haul to Zurich.

&nbsp;

Around
fourteen hours later, at JFK New York, an American Airlines flight to Barbados
was delayed for several hours as Federal Agents checked out every single
passenger, searching for a Mr. Leonard Jones, without any success.

Walt Furness
couldn�t help chewing bitterly on eight words:

The trail
stops here. Trust us. The Chameleon.

&nbsp;

***
*** ***

&nbsp;

Walt stood
jacketless, sleeves rolled up, in the same crammed meeting room, in front of
most of the same eighty agents, but this time there was no air of excitement.

The tang of sweaty
armpits, certainly.

Grim
determination for sure.

But mostly
just resignation.

He projected
three mug-shot images onto the screen behind him.

To the left,
there was the same clean-cut, modestly handsome youth he had displayed before.

�Leonard
Charles Jones. Born Los Angeles, 1st April, 1977.�

To the right,
there was a nice looking woman. At first glance, she looked like a standard,
well preserved Californian soccer mom. The resemblance with her son was
striking, given their age and gender difference.

�Melanie
Jones. Born Orange County, 8th April 1958. Unmarried single mother
of Leonard.�

And in the
middle, projected directly above where Walt stood, was one of the most
extraordinary faces most of the agents had ever seen. The masculine features
themselves were reasonably ordinary. Tough looking, strong cheekbones and jaw,
short military style haircut. He looked mid to late forties but was in superb
physical condition. Yet behind the features and within the narrowed eyes, there
was something else entirely.

Something
indescribable that made the little hairs of each member of the audience stand
on end.

�You are
looking at Charles Victor. Born Ontario County, New York State, 14th
February 1957 to an American father and an English mother. Served nine years in
the British Armed Forces and has since worked around the world as a mercenary.
Current whereabouts unknown. We believe he may be the biological father of
Leonard Jones.�

The silence in
the room was palpable, as if hearts had stopped beating. At second glance,
there was something about the mouths of the two men that was similar,
though far from obvious.

�Charles,
Melanie, Leonard.� He enunciated each name slowly.

Walt Furness
picked up a marker pen and wrote on the white board.

C � H � A

He turned
briefly to glance at his audience then carried on writing.

M � E � L

There were
murmurs.

L � E � O � N.

He calmly
placed the pen down and stared everybody hard in the eyes.

�Gentlemen,
ladies; The Chameleon !�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

PART EIGHT:

�Karma
Chameleon�

&nbsp;

�Every
day is like survival,

you�re
my lover not my rival.�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

John Cumber
sat slumped in a chair. He was barely surviving, a mere husk of the handsome,
6� 3� corporate titan he had been just a couple of weeks earlier. The sheer
horror of what had happened, the kidnap of his family, the images of his wife
posted on the internet, the loss of most of his fortune, his anger, exhaustion,
humiliation and impotence had sucked the life out of him, like all the juice
from a blood orange.

�So, Ellen.�
He sighed. �It�s over ?�.

It was as
much statement as question.

The trading
screens and tickers lining the room confirmed that he had lost his battle to
keep the Cumber share price above $15. On top of the constant untraceable sell
orders and rumours out of Asia, had crashed a tsunami of hedge fund shorts and
investment bank re-ratings, overwhelming even his own and his allies�
substantial resources.

When the end
came, it was decisive. The price had plunged to under $11 and it was still in
freefall. 

Ellen O�Leary
wiped her eyes with a handkerchief and adjusted her half-moon glasses.

�It�s over,
John. The banks won�t lend you any more. A couple of them feel terrible but
they just can�t override their shareholders� interests.�

The main
Cumber Estate plus homes in the Hamptons and Aspen had been mortgaged to the
hilt. The jet, cars, art and antiques, even Susan�s jewellery had already been
put up as security.

�So how much
do I have left ?�

�Just the
Cumber stock and the bank won�t accept that now.�

�What�s its
market value ?�

�A little
under a billion dollars. At last night�s close.�

�So I�m still
a fucking billionaire.� He bellowed, hurling a pencil at the wall. �A useless
paper billionaire who can�t save his family !�

There was a
silence.

�Maybe they
will contact you soon. You held the price up as long as you could.� Ellen said.

It had been a
week since he had paid the ransom and four days since the failed attempted to
catch the villain on the flight to St. Vincent.

Not a word
in all that time. But they had said they would kill a member of his family for
each day the share price ended below 15 dollars.

In a little
over ten minutes, the share price would close at under 11.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

He snatched up
the phone, somehow knowing who it would be.

�Hi, John.�

�Yes ?� he
snapped.

�Oh dear. I�m
disappointed in you. What happened to our agreement ?�

�I have no
more money. You have cleaned me out.�

�Really ?� The
taunting voice seemed genuinely surprised. �I thought you would have lasted
longer than that.�

�I know who
you are.� He said. He could tell the caller�s voice was older, more
transatlantic. He was talking to the father, not the son.

�Do you now ?
Clever boy John, though I�m sure it was those Feds not you personally who
worked it out.�

�You bastard.�
He slammed the table. �How could you ?�

�You started it,
trust me.�

�Stop that
fucking trust me stuff. I don�t trust you at all.�

There was a
deathly hush. A five seconds pause.

�Hello ?� John
said.

�I�ve had
enough of your rudeness John. This will be our last conversation. It was � er �
nice meeting up again. Briefly.�

�Wait !� He
exploded. �I�m sorry. I lost it. Pl � please ��

�But I can�t
talk more than a minute. Blame those snoopy agents of yours. You keep shouting
at me and so I never get the chance to say anything. Bye.�

�Look, please.
I�m sorry. Truly, truly sorry. Have m � mercy.�

�Aah. That�s
better Johnny boy. Tell you what, I�ll call you back once more. In a
week or so.�

�Are my family
alright ? You must tell me that at least.�

�No. I don�t have
to tell you anything at all.�

The line went
dead.

He hoped it
was the only thing that had died.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Lennie awoke
with sunshine filtering through the blinds. Dust particles danced in the bright
shafts of light and the smell of citrus and coffee tickled his nostrils. He
reached down under the sheet and scratched his sweaty scrotum.

Rachel Cumber
lay with her back to him. He lay for a moment admiring the sensuous curvature
of her spine, her narrow waist and perfect buttocks. He smiled at the memory of
her anus tight round his dick last thing before he fell asleep the night
before.

�Wake !� he
said, slapping her bottom so a red mark appeared.

She snapped
alert, terrified, and dived her head under the sheet. In seconds, he felt her
soft, guzzling lips around his morning glory. Her huge boobs pressed down against
his legs like balloons.

He plonked his
head back on the pillow and shut his eyes. Then he pushed his arm out and
fumbled for the button by his bedside. He pushed.

No more than
three minutes later, there was a soft knock on the door.

Lennie peeked
open his eyes and grinned up at Lorna. She was carrying a tray with a pot of
black coffee, frothy hot milk, fruit juice and a pastry.

While she laid
it down on the table, he pushed back the sheet, revealing Rachel�s shoulders
and face worshipping his dick.

�Lick my
butthole now.� He mumbled softly.

No need to
shout when they readily obeyed.

He winked at
Lorna. �You, take a turn on my dick.�

The two
sisters worked in tandem. They were coming along well. Now that six of the
mercenaries had taken off to Europe to visit a few banks, and the mom was doing
her best to cater to the guys who remained, Lennie had the two girls to himself
quite a lot of the time. As was his plan.

His own mom
and dad were still taking their turns occasionally but they were mainly spending
more time alone together, which was great.

He reached
down and pushed Lorna�s hair aside so he could watch her pretty mouth as she
slurped it up and down just as he liked it. Meanwhile, the tip of Rachel�s
little pink tongue was deep in his dark locker.

A cup of
coffee and his bowels would loosen up nicely.

He felt his
thighs tightening and his balls reaching the point of no return. First one of
the day was always thick, hot and plentiful. Like oatmeal.

�Don�t
swallow.� He murmured down to Lorna.

Her lips
encircled his shaft tightly as he pumped three, five, seven jets onto her
tongue. Her cheeks puffed and her doe-like hazel eyes stared up at him
intently.

He pulled
Rachel from his asshole and put their faces together.

�Okay, swap my
jizz, ladies. Each to the other and back as usual.�

He watched
them trade the pearly drool; drip and catch, catch and drip, brunette to blonde
and back again. They were starlets of the internet doing this although they
didn�t know it yet. There was nothing even the combined forces of John Cumber
and the Feds could do once those clips were circulating on the world wide web.
And inevitably even these chicks� supposed friends wouldn�t be able to
resist taking a surreptitious naughty peek at them in action !

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

It was 03.08
by the digital clock when the phone rang.

John Cumber
picked it up in the dark. There was a tiny echo.

�Oh dear,
John, I can hear those tracking people from here. Goodbye.�

&nbsp;

At breakfast,
two days later, the phone rang again. Walt Furness had reluctantly agreed to
pull most of the surveillance and monitoring in the meantime.

�Morning
John.�

�Good
morning.� He said, as politely as he could muster.

�That�s
better. Call me Sir, will you. I prefer that.�

� � Okay �
Sir.�

�Better all
the time. We�re going get along fine after all.�

�Please � tell
me about my family � Sir.�

The Cumber
share price was limping along at the 9 dollars level and had now closed below
15 dollars four days in succession.

�They�re fine,
John. Susan�s here now actually, sucking me off.�

He ignored the
taunt, although he couldn�t prevent the obscene image of his wife and Charlie
Victor raping his mind.

�They�re all
alive ?�

�Of course.
That was only a joke about the share price. Gotcha, hah ?�

�I�ve paid you
the money.� John replied. �I�ve apologised. I�ve begged for mercy. Please free
them � Sir.�

�John, you
fucked our lives for twenty years, mate. You really think a couple of weeks is
all it takes to get even ?�

John Cumber
started to sob, his voice came out in a high squeak.

�Please ��

�Excellent
John. Real tears ! Now we�re getting somewhere.�

He couldn�t
speak, his throat and chest bawling.

�Okay John.
You just cry and listen. I read in the Wall Street Journal that you�ve still
got a fistful of Cumber stock. What I want you to do is give it away to
charity. The lot. Do something good with your life, John. Then maybe I�ll do
something good to you in return. Nice talking.�

&nbsp;

***
*** ***

&nbsp;

Charlie smiled
as Melanie put her chin on his chest and looked up into his eyes. Her fingers
softly cradled his balls.

�Anything left
in here for me ?� she asked coquettishly.

�But of
course, my love.� He replied. �In just a sec.�

He turned up
the volume of the TV. It was tuned to CNN.

A female
reporter was standing on the main steps of the Cumber Corporation Headquarters.
Melanie twisted her head so she could enjoy the news too.

The report was
brief and to the point. Obviously in the days to come, numerous commentators
and analysts would rush to praise, criticise, explain, interpret and generally
spout unnecessary verbiage.

�So it has
been confirmed that John Cumber,� the identikit blonde reporter said, wrapping
her piece, �has amazed the world by giving what remains of his entire fortune
to five Foundations and Charities. He has retired as of today from corporate
and public life and announced that he plans to spend the rest of his years in
poverty, working unpaid in a not-for-profit organisation. This is Leonora
Carter for CNN.� 

&nbsp;

Charlie hit
the mute button and smirked over at Susan Cumber. She was kneeling on all fours
by his side of the bed, staring silently at the screen.

�He did it, eh
? Gave it all away. Must really love you.�

Melanie
chuckled. �I wonder what he�d say if he knew you�re having an affair with a
donkey.�

Susan didn�t
move or respond. A solitary tear rolled down her cheek.

Charlie pulled
Melanie�s face up to his and kissed her.

Mmm � he
loved this woman, kinky bitch as she undoubtedly was. He always thought of
himself as the hard one, but Mel had proved harder. It would still be a long
time before Susan was shown any mercy.

�Put on the
DVD.� She purred, turning her attention back to his genitals, running a teasing
finger up his veined, swelling shaft.

He pressed the
remote, switching from CNN to the DVD and pushed �Play�. Still Susan Cumber didn�t
react, despite what appeared on the screen. Her obedience training was coming
on apace.

The previous
evening had been the cruellest so far, culminating with the first bestial
session. He had once seen a whore in Mexico paid to have sex with a donkey. But
this Ethiopian ass they had purchased was a �donkey cock� of donkey cocks; and
the stubbornest, smelliest, ugliest and best endowed brute that ever brayed.

Mel�s head lay
on Charlie�s stomach, tonguing his erection as she watched the screen. On it, Susan
was kneeling underneath the donkey, sobbing. The beast of burden was clearly
keen to shed its load ! Several jeering mercenaries were in the background,
holding it still.

Charlie
pressed the �volume� button louder.

The donkey�s
shaft was comparable to Charlie�s forearm. Hairier, sure, and maybe not quite
as thick around, but pretty similar. He watched the recording of Susan�s pink
tongue slurping over the glistening crown through her tears and grimaces.

�You�re going
to have to work on that technique.� He called down to her.

Mel�s teeth
nipped him gently.

�Not you !� he
laughed. �Her.�

He shut his
eyes, enjoying the feeling, listening to the loud playback of the excited ass
braying and the crescendo of excitement.

A few minutes
later, when Mel had sat astride Charlie, riding his dick, he peered around her
perspiring bouncing body at the screen.

Susan Cumber
was now strung into a hammock and she had been mounted by the donkey. Somehow
her increasingly slack pussy had managed to absorb its full length. In fact,
afterwards she had required a couple of stitches down below from Wolfgang
before the good doctor set off home to Switzerland.

The split
screen mode showed two views simultaneously; a side-on picture of the fucking
itself, and then a close up of her tormented face. He wondered how much was
pain and how much shame ?

An
interesting question. Maybe he would get Susan to write a coupla thousand words
essay on what it feels like to be fucked by an ass. They could all then debate
it with her and her kids, perhaps post their responses on the net ?

He tore his
eyes away and smiled up at Mel, reaching to thumb her hard, excited nips,
knowing his woman was only seconds from her climax.

While Susan
Cumber still knelt motionless, listening to two people make passionate love and
staring at herself on the screen.

&nbsp;

***

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

It was exactly
04.00 in the morning when John Cumber�s bedside phone trilled. He picked up the
handset and fumbled it to his ear.

Music was
playing down the line. A song. Vaguely familiar.

&nbsp;

�Ah, the
last time we saw you, you looked so much older

Your famous
blue raincoat was torn at the shoulder.

You�d been
to the station to meet every train

And you
came home without Lili Marlene.�

&nbsp;

He recognised
the singer; Leonard Cohen.

�Yes ?� he
muttered into the phone. �Hello ?�

There was no
response other than the continued playing of the song.

&nbsp;

�And you
treated my woman to a flake of your life

And when
she came back she was nobody�s wife.�

&nbsp;

He knew the
song now. From the early seventies; 71 or 72 maybe. It was called �Famous Blue
Raincoat� and it had been playing the evening he raped Melanie Jones.

John Cumber
wiped his moist eyes with the back of his hand in the dark.

&nbsp;

�Yes, and
thanks, for the trouble you took from her eyes

I thought
it was there for good so I never tried ��

&nbsp;

�John ?� a
male voice suddenly interrupted, as the music cut.

�You there ?�

He snapped out
of the reverie. �Yes � I�m here.�

�You listening
to the words, John ? You remember ?�

�I remember.�

�You treated
my woman to a flake of your life, John.�

�Ch � Chuck �
I�m terribly sorry. I was young � we were young ��

�And when
Melanie came back she was nobody�s wife.�

�I know.
Please � please tell Mel I�m desperately sorry too.�

�Tell her
yourself.�

There was a
pause. The rustle of a phone being passed.

�Hallo,
rapist.�

He didn�t even
recognise her voice but he knew it was her.

�Mel � I�m
sorry. Please. But spare Susan and my children. They had nothing to do with
it.�

There was
another, longer pause.

�You�re right,
John.� He heard her reply coldly. �It wasn�t their fault. But it is their
karma. And now their every day is like � survival.�

John screwed
his eyes shut and held his breath. He had to keep control.

�Please let
them survive.� He pleaded. �I�ve done everything you asked. Every last penny.
I�m a broken man. You�ve won.�

�To the
Victors the spoils, huh ?�

He stayed
silent. Not wanting to agree or disagree with her.

�You want a
choice, John ?�

� � Alright.�
He responded, uncertainly.

�Here it is.
You can either have all four kids back now and never see Susan
again. That�s Option One. Or you can have five back in one year�s time.
That�s Option Two.�

He felt his
heart beating like a hammer and struggled for breath.

�That�s the
deal. No fucking about this time. No �Trust Us� lies. We�ll keep our word. So,
it�s up to you, John. You�ve got ten seconds to make up your mind. Four now �
or five in a year�s time ? Option One or Option Two ?� Her voice asked.

John Cumber
clutched his pumping heart in pain. He couldn�t think straight. He couldn�t
choose. Ten seconds, nine, eight �

�This line
goes dead forever in five seconds.� Her tone was cold.

He knew she
meant it.

How could he
decide ? Three, two �

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

EPILOGUE:

�NINE
LIVES�

&nbsp;

�Nine
Lives � Puss &amp; Booty

Nine
Lives � Live again

Nine
Lives � It ain�t over

Nine
Lives � Live for ten�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

As the weeks
and months went by, the �Cumber Kidnap� story steadily slipped down the front
page, to the inside columns, and finally from news media coverage altogether.
With nothing new to say, editors, journalists, broadcasters, readers and
viewers moved on to other �shock, horror� stories.

Gradually the
Agencies and Police pulled resources from the Cumber Investigation until only a
hardcore small unit was left on the case. Meanwhile, the Cumber Corporation
itself slowly recovered under a new CEO and board with a fresh strategy. Even
the share price rebounded.

&nbsp;

Then, one
early morning, fourteen months after the last had been heard from the
kidnappers, John Cumber awoke in the homeless shelter he slept every night with
a couple of hundred other �down-on-their-lucks�.

Somebody was
shining a torch into his face.

�John.�

He squinted
and rubbed at the sleep dust in his eyes.

Nostrils
twitching, Walt Furness sat down gingerly on the edge of the narrow bunk.

�John �
they�re home.�

But even in
his sleep-drugged state, he could tell from Walt�s tone.

Something�s
wrong.

&nbsp;

The three
wailing police cars carried them through the rain-slick streets at dawn to the
airfield. They flew westwards in a jet laid on by the Bureau to southern Texas.
During the 2� hours flight, they travelled mostly in silence. Walt sat stroking
his chin, perusing files, making a few calls.

As they neared
the landing, Walt explained to him that his family had been found locked in the
back of a truck at a Gas Station on Interstate 10, between San Antonio and
Houston, suspected smuggled in from Mexico.

Police and
Emergency Vehicles had rushed to the scene.

Three more
police cars now carried John, Walt and others to the Ben Taub General Hospital
in the heart of the Texas Medical Center.

&nbsp;

A phalanx of
paramedics, officers and agents greeted them, bustling John into the rear
entrance, leaving a dozen armed men to seal the doors.

He was ushered
into an elevator and taken to the 8th Floor.

There were
twin doors at the end of a long corridor.

Slowly, with
leaden steps, he made it without falling over.

The doors were
opened and he walked through, followed by Walt and the grey-haired man who�d
been introduced as the Doctor in charge.

The first one
he saw was Gene, unshaven, staring red eyed. But alive.

Then Ryan. His
son. Rushing towards him. Alive.

Then Lorna,
lying covered up on a hospital gurney. Crying. Also alive.

No sign of
Rachel.

Or Susan.

And then
Ryan�s thin arms were around his neck.

�Dad.� A
faraway voice whispered into his ear.

He tried to
speak but nothing came out. He felt his legs buckling.

�Help him !�
Walt ordered urgently and strong hands scooped him under the armpits.

�This way.�

�Careful.�

He lost
consciousness for a few moments and then he was being supported at another set
of swing doors, looking through internal glass panes.

A figure was
lying on an operating table, surrounded by green suited medics, nurses and
banks of flashing equipment.

�It�s Rachel,
dad.�

Ryan�s voice
was clearer now, stronger, nearer.

�She�s too
weak, John. They�re doing an emergency C-Section.� Walt put a hand on his
shoulder.

C-Section ?
Pregnant ? Rachel ?

�H � how � ?�

Walt shifted
his gaze. Ryan blinked.

�Lorna is too,
dad. She�s over eight months gone. Just behind Rachel.�

John nodded slowly.
He half turned his head to look at his older daughter but stopped himself. His
unspoken question went unanswered.

Ryan was
wearing a white cotton hospital shift on top. On his legs he was dressed in
soiled black pants, part of the tux suit he�d been wearing when he�d been
kidnapped. Slowly, he fished a hand down into the side pocket.

�They said to
give you this, dad.�

John felt his
whole body shiver as he recognised the big, black, upper case letters; �JOHN
CUMBER, BY HAND�.

He didn�t ask
Walt for permission. He slid his trembling finger along the sealed tab and
opened the envelope, heart pumping. Cautiously, he unfolded the page.

&nbsp;

Dear John,

Hi. At last ! Long
time no speak. You�ve been a good boy, John. We like your new lifestyle so much
more than the old one. And so here is your reward. If you remember we made a
deal; you could have four kids back straightaway, or five in a year�s time. And
you chose Option Two, right ? Well, you always were a shit hot investor John.
Guess what ? You invested four and, instead of five, you�ve got six kids back !
Ryan, Gene, Lorna, Rachel and two little grand kids. I call that a pretty good
return all things considered. So, goodbye my friend. Live again. I think that
makes us even. Game�s over. The Chameleon.

&nbsp;

Unable to
speak, John passed the sheet of paper to Walt. He shook his head at Ryan,
screwing his eyes shut in pain.

�Dad !�

He reopened
them at the alarm in his son�s voice.

Through the
glass panes, he could make out frantic activity around the operating table. Rachel�s
head and body were hidden by a sheet but her pale legs were visible. A surgeon
was holding something.

John stared.

His
grandchild.

A tiny
baby.

Beautiful.

And black.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Outside, the
fresh snow lay thick and fluffy as a white sheepskin rug. The winter of 2012
had been mild by Arctic standards, but the cold snap in March had brought huge
falls of deep powder that covered every square yard of the 50,000 acres ranch,
and for hundreds of miles around.

Melanie sat in
the warmth at her PC and surfed the news pages.

�Ma�am.�

She raised an
eyebrow.

�May I take
your tea cup Ma�am ?�

She nodded.

After Susan
had picked up the empty cup and saucer, Melanie spoke.

�Would you
like to hear the latest titbit ?�

Susan�s green
eyes widened. News from the outside world was rare.

�Actually, I
think it must be a few weeks ago now since I heard it. Lorna is pregnant
again.�

She watched
Susan gasp, making the cup and saucer rattle.

Gene and
Lorna had gotten married after all, quietly, a year or so after they were released.
They lived simply, with their daughter Delorna, and at last they had been able
to conceive a child all of their own.

�Thank you,
Ma�am. That is � wonderful news.�

�I thought
you�d be pleased. And I have a new photo of Rachel�s son too for you somewhere.
He�s going to make a heck of a basketball player, I think.�

�Thank you
Ma�am. You are too kind.�

Melanie
paused, smiling at her. It had taken a while, but Susan Cumber really had
turned out a nice, polite, meek, grateful, obedient woman.

�Do you know
what day it is tomorrow, Susan ?�

The aged,
lined but still attractive face frowned at her. �No Ma�am.�

�It�s your
fiftieth birthday.�

Susan rattled
the cup again, expression shifting to nervous surprise.

�Yes. The time
has come for that game of Sophie�s Choice I promised you so long ago. Susan�s
choice ! We�ll celebrate and play it tonight.�

&nbsp;

Charlie opened
a magnum of Krug champagne and poured three glasses. He handed one to Mel and
the other to Susan, then set the bottle down on the lid of the coffin placed in
the centre of the candlelit room.

�Cheers.�

All three
drank; he and Mel smiling, Susan apprehensive. Several times her gaze shifted
down to the wooden, pine-scented coffin.

�Strip.�

Without any
reaction or pause, Susan began removing the maid�s outfit that was her everyday
uniform. He watched in the soft, flickering light, as the body that he had come
to know every inch of, was revealed one last time. She unhooked her bra and
slipped off her black thong without embarrassment.

Once upon a
time, it had been planned she would display nipple and labia rings and five
huge letters indelibly tattooed; W and H on her breasts, O on her stomach, R
and E on each thigh.

But Mel had
taken notice of what people were saying. Too harsh !

�Bend.�

Naked, Susan
turned and silently presented her rear view to him.

And once upon
a time, she was to have borne his initial C branded on her left buttock and the
letter M on her right.

Again, Mel
eventually decided that branding was a punishment too far.

Charlie put
his glass down and unzipped himself.

Mel winked at
him encouragingly.

A farewell
fuck.

She was ready.
Susan maintained herself constantly lubed up and ready for him and the
occasional guests who came to visit for fishing or hiking trips. Not that Susan
had any idea where this ranch was. She lived in the purpose built basement and
had never taken so much as a breath of the fresh Arctic air.

She bent,
hands braced on her knees, hips angled to give him easy access. He ran his
fingers up and down her familiar spine, thrusting rhythmically.

Such a
waste.

Mel watched
them a while with half an eye and, with the other, she carefully opened a
medicine chest. He smiled as she extracted two identical syringes.

He had camped
two days out on the ice on a fishing expedition. His balls were full and ready.
It took so little time when he was in this mood.

�Mmm �� Susan
moaned appreciatively from below.

He cupped his
palms under her breasts, making her shiver, as his knees juddered.

�Come.� He
grunted; part-commentary on himself, part-command to her.

He grimaced as
he emptied his heavy load inside her.

And then
smiled as, a moment later, Susan Cumber pushed back at him and hissed air in a
crescendo of uncontrolled sobs.

�Here comes
the bride�s mother, after all�.

&nbsp;

Susan lay
naked in the fur-lined coffin, looking up at them both in tears.

�Your choice.�
Mel whispered, holding up the two syringes. �It�s over, whatever happens.
Either of these will make you sleep.� She continued. �But only one will
allow you to wake up afterwards.�

Susan increased
her snivelling in terrified gulps.

�Quickly !
Come on, this bit is the hard part. Once you�ve decided, you go to sleep and
you won�t know the difference. It�s justice time. Which is it ? The left one or
the right ?�

Susan shook
her head in uncontrolled panic.

He guessed
that after years of not making the simplest decision for herself, she was
suddenly incapable when asked to make the most important one of all.

�Left or right
!? Now ! Or it will have to be both.�

�R � right !�

There followed
an ear splitting howl of terror as one woman knelt and unloaded the syringe
into the other�s thigh.

Two women,
each united by two men, both unwillingly.

A minute or so
later, very gently, Melanie Jones covered Susan Cumber in a thick, soft,
cashmere blanket, and closed the coffin lid.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The Eyes
watched the modest house owned by Gene and Lorna Collins. It was an ordinary
suburban home with a single tree and a beat up Korean car out front. Gene�s
family money could have afforded them anything but these two had learned their
lesson.

Yellow ribbons
and a Stars and Stripes bedecked the yard and house. He smiled. Although it was
his first visit on US soil in years, the welcome party was not for him. The
police had closed the street to anybody but family, neighbours and cops. In a
few minutes, the taxi carrying John and Susan Cumber would arrive to reunite
them all once more. A nice, private moment.

His eyes
squinted through his dark glasses to the window by the side of the front door.
A cute little 3 � year old girl was visible, waiting at the pane with her mom.
They smiled and waved excitedly at one of the policemen drafted in from another
precinct.

Lennie
fingered his badge and waved straight back at them both.

He felt a
twinge of emotion. Delorna. A sweet name for a sweet kid. Literally �Of Lorna�.
Appropriate. It had been his �suggestion� and of course Lorna had obeyed him.
She always would.

He might never
reveal himself to his daughter.

On the other
hand, maybe he would do like his own dad had and simply turn up on her 18th
Birthday !

You see,
�Delorna� was also an anagram of �Leonard�.

But only one
dude in the whole US of A got the fucking joke !

The Chameleon.

Him.

Charlie
finished singing and switched off the scalding hot shower.

His days of
standing under a cold spray were over. 

As he dried
himself, he smiled at the Aerosmith classic reverberating off the wet room
tiles. It was �Nine Lives�, his own motto. But there were a couple of lines he
liked even more than the manic chorus.

&nbsp;

�And
how can one man�s little bit of Heaven

Turn
into another man�s Hell.�

&nbsp;

This fishing
lodge in the middle of nowhere was his own little bit of heaven. All paid for
by another man�s hell.

Dressed in
just a white towel round his muscled midriff, he padded into the open-plan
living room. He ran his lips over Mel�s naked shoulder.

She had
finished typing and was sat still in her chair, staring at the screen.

&nbsp;

THE
END

&nbsp;

�Penny for
your thoughts.� he said. �Regrets ?�

She turned her
head to look up at him with a sad pout.

�Not really.�

Both
syringes had contained the same anaesthetic. After all, Melanie was never going
to risk killing her own granddaughter�s grandmother !

�The whirlwind
has been reaped. It�s over.� He said.

Famous Blue
Raincoat gave him a gentle nod. �No more red mist either.�

He leaned down
and kissed her full on the lips.

�Was I too
harsh ?� she asked.

He reached for
her breast but she twisted away.

�Listen.� She
said, clicking the mouse, bringing up a page of reviews. �Really good but at
times too harsh for my liking.�

He chuckled.
�Well then it�s kinda lucky you didn�t describe everything that we
actually did !�

�What about
this ? There is something about the plot I don�t care for. In this case the
Chameleon character is a real turn off for me.�

He gave
another wry smile. �Well, we weren�t meant to be nice !�

�Yes but it
says heavy bdsm � too harsh � nasty perversions ! I mean, have you ever looked
at some of the other stuff on this site ?�

Charlie smiled
at her indignation.

Nope, he
hadn�t looked. He was not a reader. He was a �doer�.

�I don�t think
it�s what we did.� He replied. �It�s the fact that you suggested their
point of view. I would guess it�s easier being a reader if it�s a catalogue of
acts. You know; he fucked her, then he pissed on her, then he snuffed her. That
kind of thing.�

He ruffled
Mel�s hair then continued.

�But every
male reader is a potential John or Ryan Cumber. Every female a budding Susan or
Lorna. You made people empathise. That�s good.�

There was a
pause. The log fire crackled.

�You think ?�

He began
sensuously stroking her back.

�And that�s
really why you let Susan go.� He said. �� in the end.�

*** THE END ***

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

By the same author:

&nbsp;

�After the
Pestilence� � a long (80,000 words) novel set in
the near future, involving numerous characters and containing, as one reviewer
said, �something for everyone� (most of it is non-consensual and the
humiliation is extreme, although the actual violence is mainly moderate).

&nbsp;

�The Ballad
of Lara and Gemma� � a spin-off tale from �After
the Pestilence�. It is set in the near future and describes the infatuation of
a lesbian/bi Domme and an unwilling female slave (all non-consensual scenes
and extreme humiliation, including scat).

&nbsp;

�A Special
Relationship� � A story set in present day London of
an Anglo-American relationship, involving a submissive British woman whose
boundaries are pushed to their very limit by her younger dominant boyfriend
during one turbulent weekend (a consensual and romantic story involving
unconventional cuckqueening, chastity and humiliation).

&nbsp;

�Son-of-a-Gun� � A story set in the mid-nineteenth century and also the present
day recounting the fate of two young ladies at the mercy of a desperate ship�s
crew stranded on a remote island (part non-consensual and part consensual
involving moderate bdsm and humiliation).

&nbsp;

�Supper�s
Ready� � Five short poems with a bdsm flavour (these
were written to amuse and stimulate minds, not genitals)

&nbsp;

�Amuse-Bouches� �written in
English, not French ! Amuse-Bouches are appetisers that fancy restaurants serve
to �amuse the mouth� before the main meal. A selection of three dominant-POV
short stories, rising in severity from consensual to mind control to
non-consensual (the first two contain moderate bdsm, whilst the third is
quite heavy and may not be to everybody�s taste).

&nbsp;

�Hors d�Oeuvres� � also in English. A selection of three consensual,
male-submissive short stories, or rather �opening chapters� of novels I have
never finished � so far (mild).
