Chapter 1 � Anne Acts! 
I had judged the time and opportunity perfectly as Maria was walking passed
  my door towards the parking lot exit. 
�Maria � hey don't go out like that, come in here.� 
She hesitated, looked at me, and then her eyes dropped away from mine and
  she came into my office. 
�It's so cold out there and just look at you.� As I spoke I moved around my
  desk to meet her. �You need someone to look after you don't you?� 
She was wearing a lovely dark green leather coat that just brushed her knees
  and it was wide open. As she stood in front of me I reached out and, just like
  a mother to a child, buttoned it down the front and then moved even closer
  to her as I reached around for the belt and slipped the end through the buckle
  to draw it tightly around her waist. 
�There now.� I said as I gripped a lapel in each hand and pulled the collar
  up around her neck �we don't need the company President getting a cold do we? 
�No, thank you Anne� she whispered without raising her eyes to look at me. 
�Do you have some gloves to go with that nice warm coat? 
�Yes.� She reached in the side pockets and bought out a pair of black leather
  gloves that, as she pulled them on, reached well up her wrists. 
�Those are just great now just let me fix those wrist straps to keep out the
  wind and then I'll close up here and see you tomorrow � bye Maria. Oh� I continued
  as she started to turn for the door �and make sure you are properly dressed
  for this weather OK?� 
She turned and left without a backwards glance and I just knew I had her pegged
  to the nth degree � she would soon be mine and so would her company and the
  money. 
It was just over six months ago when Maria had been introduced to me and the
  rest of the staff as the new owner. Her grandfather Fred, my boss and friend
  for the last five years, owned the business and when he died she, by default
  as the last surviving family member, had inherited and become President of
  our company. 
I was the CEO and Chief Financial Officer and, although just in my early 30's,
  had worked too hard for my position to put up with a 23 year old know nothing
  for a boss. The first time I met her I pegged her for a sub; she might not
  know she was but I spotted it right away. 
As we were introduced, she even had a �wet fish� handshake. I made a point
  of holding her glance until she blinked and dropped her eyes; that's when I
  knew. 
Over the next weeks and months I made sure that she came to rely on my knowledge
  and that any meaningful decisions had my input. I made a habit of dropping
  papers in front of her for signature without giving her a moment to read them.
  Maria had made it clear that she didn't understand what was going on and trusted
  my judgment. The fool. 
I adjusted my wardrobe and started wearing a lot of power suits and high heels.
  I took every opportunity to tower over this shy ex-hairdresser who was so used
  to taking orders that when they came from me she accepted them without question. 
Later that evening I phoned her at home with a cock and bull story about some
  papers that just had to be signed immediately. A half hour later I pulled in
  the driveway of Fred's mansion, now hers, that she had moved into after I arranged
  to have everything she owned, which wasn't much, shipped in from the west coast. 
I knew she would be alone because one of her other problems was she could
  not get used to the fact that she had all the money anyone would ever need.
  Under my guidance the company was netting over $2 million a year but since
  she was eighteen she had lived by herself on a very tight budget and the habit
  still stuck. 
When she opened the door I posed to let the full affect of my outfit reveal
  itself. Tight black leather pencil line skirt, matching belted hip length jacket
  and knee high boots with 5� stiletto heels. Even my hands were encased in tight
  black kid. 
Maria looked me up and down, gulped, and then lowered her eyes as she stood
  aside to let me in. 
Striding straight down the hallway to the den I turned and waited for her
  to close the front door and follow me. Suggesting that she sit at the desk
  while I showed her the papers I opened my briefcase and put them in front of
  her before moving around to stand at her side. 
With one gloved finger I pointed out where she was to sign while continuing
  a stream of verbal bafflegab as too what they meant. Gently I allowed my other
  kid gloved hand to rest on her shoulder and, as I leaned closer, moved it to
  the bare skin at the back of her neck. 
I felt her stiffen and the pen stopped moving but I just kept talking and
  turning pages and the moment passed, the tension went out of her shoulders
  and the pen moved again. Yes, it was time to make the next move. 
I let my fingers gently squeeze her neck for a second then became all business
  again and packed the papers back in my briefcase. �Have you had supper Maria?� 
�Yes I had just finished when you called.� 
�Then let's go to the kitchen and make a drink for ourselves because I have
  a favour to ask you and we need to discuss it.� 
I knew my way around the house, having been there many times while Fred was
  alive � strictly on business mind you � and let her get the full effect of
  my outfit as she followed me to the kitchen. 
A quick glance around showed me that she had indeed finished supper. There
  was an empty package for a God Damn TV dinner on the counter. She could have
  been eating caviar and prime rib served by a couple of hot and cold running
  maids and here she was with $3 pre-packaged crap. Well things were about to
  change � drastically. 
We ended up with our drinks in the living room and I made a point of sitting
  next to her on the chesterfield so that she could not avoid the scent of all
  the leather covering me or indeed the proximity of my body invading her space. 
�You see Maria, the lease on my home is up at the end of the month and I haven't
  been able to find anything else yet. Since you have this huge house with six
  bedrooms but live here by yourself I was wondering if you would allow me to
  move in for a little while until I can find a new place.� 
�It would be so convenient and since we spend so much time together at the
  office with no problems I'm sure we would get along.� 
My hand, still in the tight kid, was back on her neck and her chest was rising
  and falling with something other than just regular breathing. I moved my other
  hand to her chin and lifted it until she was facing me. Her eyes were down
  but as I tilted her head up she was more or less forced to look at me. 
�May I?� 
And that's how I moved in a few weeks ago. 
As I write this, sitting at the same desk that she had used to sign away the
  company to me, I reach down and stroke Maria's leather covered head. Tracing
  the lacing down the back of the helmet I move my fingers around to feel that
  the strap covering the huge ball gag filling her mouth is nice and tight. 
Just for fun I let two fingers cover the holes in the leather under her nostrils
  for a moment and watch as she strains against her bondage to try and writhe
  away from my grasp. That was a hopeless task but I let her breathe as I whisper �Never
  mind my pet, later we will really have some fun.� 
But back to my story and the week she lost a very uneven battle she hadn't
  even known she was fighting. 
A few days after I moved in I suggested that we go out for dinner because
  I didn't feel like cooking � the TV dinners had gone in the trash - and waited
  in the living room while she went for her coat. As I knew it would be it was
  the green leather and she took one look at my face and started buttoning the
  buttons and tying the belt. 
When that was done I looked at her and said, �It's a shame with a lovely coat
  like that you don't have some boots to wear that would compliment it.� 
�Oh, but I do.� 
�Well why don't you wear them?� I asked. 
Maria shyly explained that she had bought them on a whim as a birthday present
  to herself but the first time she wore them outside she felt everyone was looking
  at her and hadn't worn them since. 
�Let me see them on you and we can decide what the problem is with them.� 
There was no problem except that in her innocence she had gotten herself a
  pair of hooker boots with stiletto heels and it was no wonder they drew looks
  from everyone. 
We never did leave the house that evening. I decided to finish the farce and
  asked her to come and sit next to me on the chesterfield. I was wearing my
  black leather Domme outfit again and as she settled beside me I put my arm
  around her and drew her to me. 
�Maria, you're a lovely young lady but your lonely and your shy and you need
  someone strong in your life to help you. Let me show you how much better you
  can feel if you try an idea of mine, will you trust me?� 
All I got was a nod of her head, as she, for the first time, looked me directly
  in the eye without dropping her gaze. 
�Turn around and put your hands behind your back.� 
After a moments hesitation she half turned away from me and the leather-covered
  arms moved back. With two or three quick twists of the cord I had hidden between
  the cushions, her wrists were captured; and so was she. 
Reaching down with another piece of the cord I knotted it around her booted
  ankles and then sat back up and put my arm around her shoulders again. 
�Now then Maria, for the moment I have made you even more helpless than usual.
  You have no choice but to do what I say and you can't make any decisions for
  yourself. So answer me honestly, would there be a sense of relief if I was
  in charge of everything that happens to you and you no longer had to worry
  about those huge company responsibilities and other things? Would you would
  like that?� 
Two large tears welled from the corners of her eyes as she looked at me and
  whispered, �Yes please Anne.� 
Then I had kissed her and as she first stiffened and then relaxed starting
  to return the passion in our lip lock I pulled away and rammed in the other
  item hidden between the cushions � a large dark green ball gag that matched
  her coat! 
Now it was weeks later and I was going to the company Christmas party. While
  I had fun and enjoyed compliments from the staff for the very successful year
  I had guided them through, Maria was going to be spending the evening alone. 
I had spent the last two hours making sure that she would be extremely uncomfortable
  while I was away and now, wearing a black leather maxi coat over my cocktail
  dress, I ran one kid gloved hand over the form in front of me, almost tempted
  to stay and revel in my control over her. Almost but not quite, instead my
  evening would be spiced by the thought of what waited for me when I got home. 
I turned out the lights and left with the rustle of leather and clicking of
  my spike heels on the marble floor of the foyer 










THE TAKEOVER
By
Anne Gray

Chapter 2 &#8211; �Maria&#8217;s Misery�

Maria was desperately trying to stop breathing.&nbsp; Not permanently you understand, but just for half a minute or even a few seconds!&nbsp; Anything that would stop the incessant torment to her nether regions and breasts.

It was three hours since she had felt Anne&#8217;s kid gloved hand stroke her encased cheek and then watched, through tear-filled eyes, as the leather coated back disappeared and the clicking of the high heels stopped with the slamming of the front door.&nbsp; To Maria it had been an eternity; an eternity of torment and aching muscles.

Maria knew the time exactly because the one she had thought was her friend, who she had trusted in her innocence and who had taken such complete advantage of her, had hung a big clock with a large sweeping second hand on the wall in front of her tormented body.

She sucked in a deep breath of air and, for the hundredth time, strained to find some strength left in her knees to straighten her legs, just enough to raise her body the two or three inches needed.&nbsp; Pushing down, forcing her feet ever deeper into the confines of the ballet boots, Maria gradually, and very slowly, made her rigidly held torso and upper body rise the necessary amount to break the contact at the base of the spring loaded butt plug.

Of course, as soon as she was high enough and the contacts separated, Maria&#8217;s air supply became non-existent.

The set-up was diabolical; if her strength gave out she would suffer but would be able to breathe. But until her strength gave out she could chose for her self to suffer or to hold her breath.&nbsp; Anne was too much of a bondage professional to leave her sub&#8217; in danger.&nbsp; Discomfort &#8211; definitely, frustration &#8211; certainly, tormented &#8211; Oh yes; but danger - no!

For nearly 45 seconds Maria&#8217;s body remained motionless except for the quivering muscles under their covering of tight leather but then, with an audible sob through her packed mouth, it slowly settled down once again.&nbsp; The circuit was completed and the unmerciful toys came alive yet again as the tired girl drew in air to fill her straining lungs.

Desperately Maria tried to take her mind off the constant torment happening to her.&nbsp; She thought back to earlier that afternoon when Anne had come in to the huge closet off the master bedroom, that now was Maria&#8217;s home when she wasn&#8217;t �needed�, clipped a leash to her collar and led her downstairs. 

Maria had hobbled along having trouble keeping up, not so much because of the 8� chain between her ankles, but because of the difficulty of balancing on the almost non existent toes of the knee high ballet boots.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t know anymore what it was like to walk with her feet flat on the floor.&nbsp; Even a 3� or 4� heel would have been blissful.&nbsp; The fact that her arms were useless in the black leather single arm binder behind her back didn&#8217;t help matters.

In the kitchen she had been unceremoniously seated in a heavy wooden chair, her arms dragged over the back and several turns of thin cord, pulled very tightly above and below her breasts and around the chair, kept her in place.

There was a smirk a mile wide on Anne&#8217;s face as she had waited for the microwave to beep then carried its contents over to the table.&nbsp; She loosened the ball gag to let it hang around Maria&#8217;s neck as she sat down beside her and fed the poor girl &#8211; a $3 TV dinner!&nbsp; After each spoonful was pushed in the captive&#8217;s mouth, Maria knew better than to try and speak, Anne had taken great delight in describing what was to be served on the menu at the company Christmas dinner later.

�Here have some more mashed potatoes and dry sliced turkey; we are starting with shrimp cocktail.&nbsp; These green peas look a bit shriveled I bet they don&#8217;t taste like the rack of lamb with asparagus tips and scalloped potatoes I&#8217;ll be supping on!&nbsp; Oh look they have a little bit of apple crumble for your dessert I hope you enjoy it as much as the Baked Alaska we are having.�

A glass of water to wash everything down and Anne had pushed the ball back in Maria&#8217;s mouth then moved her to start the two-hour process that ended with her in the current predicament.

The metal brackets on the steel toes of the tightly laced thigh high ballet boots were bolted to a floor plate holding her feet immovably just over 18� apart.&nbsp; With her knees bent she was in a partial squat position unless she chose to straighten her legs.&nbsp; If she did straighten up then the tube of the modified snorkel slid up through the loosened clamps on the pipe at the left side of her head until the end fitted neatly over the rubber plug pointing downwards from a bracket on the same pipe.

The snorkel mouthpiece was much larger than the one used by a diver and filled her mouth to absolute capacity.&nbsp; Straps from it encircled her head that was already encased in a tightly laced leather discipline helmet.&nbsp; The helmet had just two holes at the eyes allowing her to see the clock but fitted snugly over the rest of her face including the two rubber plugs pushed in her nostrils.&nbsp; The snorkel was the only air supply available and air came at a cost!

Maria was unable to use her arms to take some of her weight as she constantly tried to lift up off the butt plug.&nbsp; They were doubled up between her shoulder blades, covered in two layers of tight leather, and held rigidly by several roller buckled straps.

Anne had moved directly in front of Maria to let her see the way the butt plug worked.&nbsp; The bulbous head topped a four-inch hard rubber tube that fitted over the slightly smaller tube extending up from the base.&nbsp; In total it was over seven inches long but, as the Domme pushed it against the palm of her hand, Maria saw it retract until it stopped against the base.&nbsp; With a finger Anne pointed to the contacts on the two parts and grinned at the helpless girl.

Several wires extended from the base and Anne let them dangle as she coated the plug with KY then moved behind Maria and attached it to a moveable bracket on the floor to ceiling pole.

Maria&#8217;s upper body and head were joined together by a heavy leather neck corset that took away any movement and, after lining up the head of the plug, Anne pulled down on the girl&#8217;s shoulders forcing it inside the waiting back passage.&nbsp; To keep Maria in that position she then tightened the clamps, through which the tube of the snorkel slid up and down, making any movement of the girl&#8217;s body impossible.

Methodically Anne had then stroked the dildo several times through the gaping vagina lips, coating it with the involuntary juices Maria provided, before working it in for the full 8� length and locking it in place.

With a scarlet fingernail she had scratched gently at her captive&#8217;s clitoris until it presented itself proudly and she could clamp on the stimulator.

Now the wires from the base of the butt plug were connected, one each to the dildo, clit stimulator and the last to the small air compressor.&nbsp; Separate tubes went from the compressor to the tips of the rubber cones over Maria&#8217;s breasts.&nbsp; These cones were lined with dozens of tiny, thinner rubber, nubs.

A quick test was made by flicking the switch attached to the pole before, satisfied, Anne shut it off and went upstairs to shower and change for the staff party.

It was just before 7pm by the clock when Anne had reappeared in a designer satin cocktail dress paid for with a considerable amount of what used to be Maria&#8217;s money.&nbsp; Throwing her black leather coat and a pair of kid gloves on the back of a chair, she waved to the immobile leather covered form as she strode towards the kitchen only to return in just moments with a small jug of water.

Pouring slowly she allowed the liquid to trickle in the opening at the top of the snorkel tube making sure that Maria was able to swallow between breaths of air.&nbsp; The jug empty, Anne loosened the clamps on the snorkel and then reached for her coat and gloves.

With a gentle, almost friendly, stroke of her hand down the frightened girl&#8217;s cheek, Anne reached down and turned on the main switch at exactly 7 o&#8217;clock before leaving the helpless and confused girl to her fate.

It took a little while for Maria to understand what was happening to her.&nbsp; The first thing was the dildo coming to life with a twisting motion and gradually growing level of vibrations.&nbsp; Then the clit stimulator added a tiny, pulsating series of electric shocks.&nbsp; On top of this the air compressor fed pressure to the rubber covering her breasts and, as the nubs grew then collapsed, made it feel as if several pairs of hands were squeezing and manipulating her flesh.

The sensations built and built until she could take no more and so, for the first time, Maria tried to straighten her legs.&nbsp; She could only lift herself so far because Anne had not allowed the leeway for her to lock her knees, but as she got her torso to rise the contact on the butt plug broke, the torment stopped but the rubber plug blocked the end of the snorkel and Maria&#8217;s air also stopped.

For the first half hour or so she managed to hold her breath for a minute at a time but now, after nearly three hours, relief for even 30 seconds was a blessing.&nbsp; Every muscle was a quivering area of exquisite torment as she closed her eyes to make yet one more effort only to open them as she heard the front door slam.

Anne strode over and, with a smile, flipped the switch.&nbsp; She was wearing a red and white fur trimmed Santa hat and holding something behind her back.

�I hope you enjoyed your evening as much as I did Maria but guess what?&nbsp; I won a prize and saved it just for you!�

Maria stared as Anne&#8217;s hand came from behind her.

Oh my God, she wouldn&#8217;t!

Would she?
