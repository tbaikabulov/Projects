AGENT BURNED
The Further Adventures of Agent Suzzanne Midsummer - 3 

CHAPTER 1 

The ballroom was crowded and brightly lit filled with the sounds of laughter and multi lingual conversations. Suzzanne Midsummer stood against the ornate door frame cradling the tall thin glass filled with champagne. She hadn&#8217;t touched it; she needed to keep her head clear. Nonchalantly scanning the faces she saw her fellow M.I.7 agent Sophie Taylor in conversation with a balding middle aged man in a dinner suit. Claus Weitzman was a well know dealer in gold and precious stones, diamonds mainly and it had served him well. The Bavarian Schloss in which the ball was being held was his, he had made his fortune in African gold mines but like most rich people enough was never enough which was why M.I.7 were here.&nbsp; Recent information had linked him to a secret bunde of German businesses who were funding a project, but that was the problem, what was the project. Suzzanne&#8217;s mission this evening was to access Weitzman&#8217;s PC files and download any information she could find. 

Suzzanne checked the silver bracelet around her wrist; it was made up of interlocking discs and had been fabricated by M.I.7&#8217;s technical team. When the wearer overlapped the discs in a certain way the pattern revealed the password to Weitzman&#8217;s PC the details of which had cost the life of a Mossad agent earlier that month. She just hoped the password was still valid and its theft undiscovered otherwise the whole mission would fail. Glancing up she noted Sophie had Weitzman enthralled, but then she was supposed to, her evening gown maximised her tanned breasts to the full, something Weitzman had not failed to notice judging by the number of times her looked down as she talked, Sophie was frequently touching his arm and leaning in close.&nbsp; 

Ditching her champagne glass Suzzanne moved quickly out of the ballroom into one of the ante rooms. It was cooler and quieter here and checking she had not been seen she gingerly opened one of the heavy wooden doors and slipped through. Weitzman&#8217;s had his own server and it was down in the basement floors, she had memorised the corridor plan and tip-toed down a set of stone steps. She looked both ways at the bottom of the steps, the corridor was empty, she moved off left. 
�He, wo Sie gehend sind? said a deep voice behind her, shit, where had he come from? She turned; a heavily built thug in a suit filled the corridor.
�Oh denke ich I' m eine Spitze verloren�, Suzzanne replied in perfect German implying she was lost and she smiled and giggled. 

He smiled back and moved towards her, �Sie sollen nicht unten hier sein�, I know I&#8217;m not supposed to be here Fritz, she thought, and giggled again smiling coyly. 

They were alone in the corridor and Suzzanne moved closer to him, she could smell him, she placed one manicured hand on his shoulder �ich bin verloren� she pouted and her other hand lightly stroked the front of his trousers. He coughed more from surprise his mind racing, where could her take her that was private. He turned looking desperately back down the corridor for somewhere to go. As he turned back to face her his world exploded as the heel of Suzzanne&#8217;s hand slammed upwards into his nose, shattering the bridge and forcing the bone fragments backwards, at the same time her knee came up hard into his balls and as he arched forward she grabbed his collar and slammed his face down into her upcoming knee, twice!. Releasing her hold on him e landed heavily on his face and didn&#8217;t move. Quickly she found a door that opened and dragged the massive dead weight inside, fortunately the floor was tiles and he slid easily but his path was marked by the huge smear of blood left by his smashed face. Quickly she pulled down the curtain behind the door and wiped up the trail, then covering him with the curtain pulled the door closed behind her.

Continuing on she came to the server room, not what she expected, normally such rooms were decorated with �No Entry� signs etc. but this was just a heavy wooden door and it was unlocked!&nbsp; Maybe Mr Weitzman doesn&#8217;t expect anybody to actually get this far she thought and she slipped quickly inside. All she found was a single PC terminal and a chair, seating herself behind the keyboard she began to type and the password request flashed up �Kennwort�. Carefully she aligned the bracelet discs to read the word, �Ich liebe Gold�, I love gold, well who&#8217;d have thought she mused, typing it in she screen came alive and she quickly found the files. Pulling the memory stick from the small pocket in the top of her stocking and plugging it in she dragged the files across, immediately they began to download.&nbsp; The stick was high capacity but apart from the USB plug virtually flat so it could be easily hidden in a specially designed stocking welt. She waited watching the progress bar until full it flashed the task was complete. Retrieving the stick she tucked it back in and logged off. 

Slipping silently out and back down the corridor she found her path blocked as a member of the kitchen staff from a doorway. Almost colliding with the woman Suzzanne took a step back, �Sorry excuse me� she said moving across the corridor and preparing to move on down the corridor. 
�No vait� said the woman in her heavy German accent, �Vot are you doing down her, guests are not allowed down here!�
Turning to face the woman Suzzanne replied �Err I&#8217;m lost I was looking for the bathroom�.
The woman looked about 50, about Suzzanne's height but of heavier build, her hair completely covered by a white turban type hat, she wore a white chef&#8217;s coat and trousers, covered with stains and splashes of indeterminate origin, she took a step forward to towards the agent. In contrast Suzzanne was wearing full make up her dark hair in a French plait.&nbsp; She wore a deep maroon evening gown, low at the front exposing her ample bosom. Split to the thigh she wore tan holdups one of which concealed the memory stick.
�Zay are not on zis level, how did you get down here?� he voice sounded accusing.
�I&#8217;m lost, I&#8217;m sorry, I go back upstairs� and she turned.
�No, I vill get security to escort you, vait!�
�It&#8217;s OK� Suzzanne replied stepping sideways �I can find my way back�.
�No you will vait!� and the woman stepped to block her route as she grabbed Suzzanne&#8217;s upper arm.
�Hey let me go!� protested Suzzanne, feeling the need to get away before the situation escalated or somebody else arrived and she twisted away from the grip simultaneously knocking the woman&#8217;s arm down with her other hand.
The woman seemed un-phased and stepped forward trying to push the agent back against the stone wall, �you vill vait!� she hissed.

Reacting quickly Suzzanne tried to get her hands inside the woman&#8217;s arms as she pressed forward but to her surprise the woman blocked the move and slammed Suzzanne against the wall her hands reaching for her throat. In seconds Suzzanne felt the woman&#8217;s strangely smooth but strong fingers feeling for the pressure points on her neck, if she succeeded Suzzanne would be wholly on the defensive. The woman smelt of cooking oil and sweat, her breath of garlic, her blue eyes locked on Suzzanne&#8217;s were cold and purposeful and her stocky frame pushed in on the agent. Summoning all her strength Suzzanne drove both her hands up again between the woman&#8217;s arms preventing her searching fingers from finding their goal, pushing off from the wall she threw her full weight against her attacker forcing her off balance. Now with room to move she drove her fist into the woman&#8217;s midriff. The woman grunted and Suzzanne took full advantage grabbing the lapel of her jacket forcing the woman back into the room she had originally emerged from. Stumbling back into the room the woman regained some of her composure and used Suzzanne&#8217;s forward momentum to swing her around slamming her into a wall of shelving. �I vill crush you� she spat and grabbing Suzzanne by the hair dragged her back across the room and smashing her against the wall face first and pinning the agent with her forearm across her shoulders used her other fist to deliver repeated blows to her victims kidneys. Suzzanne gritted her teeth, �Nnnnnnggggggg! the blows winding her and she sagged against the wall. Spinning the agent round to face her she woman grabbed Suzzanne by the throat and applied an upwards pressure, simultaneously her fist smashed into the agent&#8217;s solar plexus. Suzzanne had locked her hands around the woman&#8217;s wrist and struggled to break her tightening grip. Her head was thumping and her vision blurry as the fist buried itself in her belly forcing the last of her breath from her lungs, �OOooooooofffffff�, Suzzanne felt she would vomit. 
�You are veek! crowed the woman and punched Suzzanne again feeling the agents grip weaken and her eyes become glazed. 
�Vake up bitch I have not finished viz you� and she slid her hand into Suzzanne&#8217;s dress feeling for her nipple which she gripped between her thumb and forefinger before viciously twisting. Suzzanne screamed �Arrrrrrrgghh!� Her hands scrabbled at her bust to fend of the assault as the woman continued to twist her sensitive nipple. Unable to break her grip Suzzanne lashed out with her other hand landing a glancing punch on the woman&#8217;s cheek.&nbsp; The woman laughed and threw Suzzanne across the room. Slamming against a heavy table leg Suzzanne groaned and twisted up onto her hands and knees to face her attacker, it had not been apparent at first but the woman was much more heavily built than Suzzanne had gauged and she quickly realised she was in serious trouble. Striding after her the woman lashed out with her foot catching the agent in the ribs and flipping her onto her back, then grabbing Suzzanne by her ankles she dragged her into the middle of the room and before she could respond the woman had straddled her sitting on her middle and set about forcing her arms down by her sides before pinning them with her knees, �Now vee play�.
Suzzanne struggled, twisting beneath the woman but she was helpless and her head snapped to the side as the woman backhanded her. 
�You cheap sluts sniffing around Mr Weitzman, you are all whores!� and she reached down and scooped Suzzanne&#8217;s breasts from the front of her evening gown, �Such pretty titties!� and Suzzanne face flushed before grimacing with the pain. The woman was twisting, pinching and pulling her nipples with brutal vigour, squashing them flat between her strong thumb and forefinger. �ARRRRRRRRRGHHH� screamed Suzzanne and she struggled like and animal. 
�Shut it you whore� and she began to slap and punch the agent&#8217;s firm breasts making jump and quivered. The pain in her nipples was intense and Suzzanne fought to stifle her cries. She them began to massage them one in each hand before digging her fingers into the soft flesh, �Nice big titties� she cooed
�Fuck you, you bitch!� hissed Suzzanne, �I&#8217;ll kill you!�
�I don&#8217;t sink so!� and gripping Suzzanne round the throat she squeezed, �I sink I will have a little fun before I beat zee shit out of you�! and she slapped her hard again across the face, �Let&#8217;s see what else you have to play viz?� and leaning back slightly she reached around and Suzzanne felt her hand reach between her legs! �NO, STOP NOW! She cried. The woman just held her gaze, a fixed smile on her face as her hand sought to find the split up the side of the dress and Suzzanne felt the touch of skin on skin as the probing fingers now made their way up her thigh, �NO, STOP PLEASE!� and she fought harder trying to twist beneath the woman&#8217;s weight kicking her legs, however finding it futile she resorted to anything to distract the woman and spat in her face. The woman recoiled �Ahh Sie schmutzige Dirne� she yelled and grabbing Suzzanne&#8217;s hair she slammed her head against the stone floor, once and then again. The agent stopped struggling and groaned her head lolling to one side and wiping the spit from her cheek the woman rose looking down at her prostrate victim.
�Zat&#8217;s better, now let&#8217;s see if vee can find zumzing to fill zat dirty pussy of yours� and she turned towards the shelves.
Suzzanne&#8217;s head was pounding but now the weight was off her she sucked in deep breaths and oxygen coursed through her, forcing herself alert she saw her protagonist rifling through the contents of the shelves muttering in German.&nbsp; Rolling silently onto her side she got to her feet and took in her surroundings for the first time. She could have bolted out the door but the woman would have raised the alarm before she could get upstairs, no she would have to end it here. Looking around she saw a granite pestle and mortar on the table and her fingers curled around the cold stone of the pestle. 
�Ah, dieses ist gut� and she turned grinning holding up a thick wooden rolling pin only to see the agent standing behind her before the pestle made contact with her temple �CLUNK�, �EEEEEEHHHHHHHH� she cried doubling up as the pestle struck her again, this time across the base of her skull and she crashed to the floor face first. Dropping astride her Suzzanne deftly placed one hand on the back of her skull the other under her chin before viciously twisting the woman&#8217;s head and hearing the satisfying crunch as her thick neck snapped and her body sagged. 
 
CHAPTER 2

Back in the ballroom Sophie had managed to detach herself from Weitzman, it had not been easy, he was getting a little handy and more than once his chubby fingers had found their way onto her hip and Sophie knew from their motion he was feeling to see what if anything she was wearing under the dress and as other guests passed behind him he had used it as an excuse to move closer to her until she was flat against the wall and she could feel his portly belly pressing against her. Throughout their entire conversation she had watched his gaze repeatedly wander down to her breasts which were accentuated by her strapless gown. Still, her reference to a monthly female issue had deterred him quickly enough, now she had to find Suzzanne, she had seen her slipping out of the ballroom but that had been over an hour and a half ago and she had not yet returned. The plan was Suzzanne would get the information, return to the Ball, signal success or failure to Sophie and then they would leave independently to meet up back at their hotel and her search had so far been fruitless. She couldn&#8217;t risk trying to search downstairs; it was strictly outside their mission parameters if something like this happened. She&#8217;d wait a little longer but if Suzzanne did not appear she would have to leave. She decided to make one more sweep of the ground floor, she knew the route to the server room as well as Suzzanne and she made her way to the stairs.
 
The lobby was now empty as Sophie entered she looked at the stairwell willing Suzzanne to appear. Almost imperceptibly the curtain covering the stairs moved and she saw an eye as someone peered around the edge of the velvet hanging. Sophie moved swiftly across, �Suzzanne is that you?� she whispered and in a moment her colleague appeared. Suzzanne&#8217;s hair was dishevelled and her make up smudged, her neck and chest showed evidence of finger marks and light scratches, �Christ what happened to you?�
�I had some trouble; we need to get out of here fast�
�Did you get it?�
�Oh Yes!� and she patted the top of her thigh, �come on let&#8217;s go�
Moving briskly back towards the ballroom and exit they stopped at the doorway, a quick scan of the room showed incongruously large men in evening wear trying to inconspicuously search the room, every now and again one of them would speak into his sleeve?
�Goons!� said Suzzanne, �Secondary extraction point I think!�

Slipping back down the stairs the agents headed for the basement tunnel which would bring them up outside the Schloss walls from where they could reach the equipment and clothing they had secreted before entering the Castle. Suzzanne had hidden the woman&#8217;s body behind boxes in the room where they had fought, but she had not hidden the first body quite so well, she had not expected to still be in the building and the air was suddenly filled with the sound of blaring klaxons, shouting over the noise she said �We&#8217;re rumbled let&#8217;s move�. Sophie nodded and removing their shoes in unison they ran on stockinged feet through the corridors towards their goal. As Suzzanne passed the end of a joining corridor a voice shouted �HALT� and she spun around to see a guard levelling his pistol at her, �Hands Up� and he gestured with the pistol. Raising her hands Suzzanne turned to face the man and continued to back down the corridor, the man followed, �Stop or I&#8217;ll shoot� he shouted above the noise of the alarm.
 
Following about ten feet behind Suzzanne, Sophie had seen the man as Suzzanne passed the corridor and slid to a halt pressing herself against the wall. Watching her colleague distract the guard Sophie moved forward silently on tip toe before her fist exploded against the back of the man&#8217;s neck followed almost instantly by straight finger punch to the kidneys, as his hand shot to his neck and he doubled backwards, Suzzanne swept the gun from his hand her nylon clad foot sweeping upwards to deliver a crippling kick to the balls and as he dropped to his knees Sophie locked her arm around his neck and jerked, it was all over before he knew what was happening and the two women stood over the body breathing hard, �Good job� said Sophie. Suzzanne bent down and picked up his pistol before rifling his pockets for more clips, �we may need this� and Sophie nodded in agreement. 

�It&#8217;s&#8217; down here� and Sophie darted down an unlit passage, Suzzanne waited just inside the entrance watching to see if anyone had followed them. Sophie meanwhile had found a steel trapdoor under some tarpaulin and lifting it up found their escape route. Just then they heard approaching footsteps clattering down the corridors, 
�Quick let&#8217;s go� said Sophie. Suzzanne hesitated; if they both went their escape route would be obvious. 
�No Sophie, you go I&#8217;ll hold them off and hide the trapdoor once you&#8217;re through�
�What!� exclaimed Sophie, �I can&#8217;t let you do that!�
�Yes go, look they only know about me, you can get out with the info� and she pulled the memory stick from her stocking top and handed it to Sophie.
Reluctantly Sophie took the stick and as their fingers touched, they lingered for a moment; she knew that once through that trapdoor she may never see her friend again and she didn&#8217;t want to think about what the horrors villains could inflict on a captured spy!
 
�Go, go now!� urged Suzzanne and Sophie dropped down through the trapdoor. Suzzanne quickly pulled the tarp back over the door and returned to the entrance, leaning around she saw the guards approaching. Crack, crack!&nbsp; Two shoots from the pistol sent them scuttling into the side corridors before a hail of shots filled the air around Suzzanne with dust and chips of stone. She ducked back crouching down, the longer she could hold them off the more chance Sophie would have of getting out of the tunnel. She fired off two more shots before ducking back watching the return fire pock the entrance walls. Without warning a black cylinder hissing sparks scuttled along the floor finally rolling into her hiding place, shit, a stun grenade and as she dived towards the back of the corridor as it exploded filling her world with disorientating bright light and concussive waves of sound! 

She rolled to a halt and lay still, she could see nothing except blobs of colour and her ears were ringing, her mind spinning, then she was aware of movement and she felt herself being dragged by her feet out into the main corridor. As her awareness returned she could see looming over her four men all pointing handguns at her.

Sophie had heard the gunfire as she ran crouched along the tunnel, she had hesitated and thought to go back but she knew Suzzanne was right and her training kicked in, the information she was carrying was of paramount importance, other had died for this information and Suzzanne was probably going to die for it! 

Suzzanne was hauled unceremoniously to her feet, her wrists were roughly pulled behind her and she felt handcuffs fasten around them. Confident she was secure the men holstered their weapons; she was still suffering elements of disorientation from the blast and was in no state to resist. They began to drag her along the corridor back the way she had come, looking back she saw nobody was staying to search the corridor, it looked like the ruse had worked but now her mind began to ponder on her own fate, her future did not look pleasant and probably not very long!

�Stop� said a female voice, �where are you taking her?�
�To Mr Weitzman� said one of the men
�Not any longer� replied the voice, �take her to storage rooms we need to ask her some questions�
The men shoved Suzzanne in the back, �Move� and instead of taking her back upstairs they continued past the server room and down another set of steps moving deeper below the building. The corridors where wide and low here with caged bulbs lighting the way, on the left was row of doors marked �Storage 1, 2 and 3�.
�Take her into 3� said the woman from behind them, �it&#8217;s empty�.
Pushing Suzzanne towards the designated door, one of the men turned the heavy lock and the door swung open and reaching around the door he flicked switch and light flooded into the corridor.&nbsp; 

CHAPTER 3 

Inside Storage 3 was empty, the walls and ceiling curved to form an arch and had been painted white to ensure maximum illumination from the harsh overhead lights. One of the guards shoved Suzzanne inside. The only furniture was a couple of rough chairs and a heavy table, a chest stood in one corner and as she surveyed the room she could see eye bolts and various fixings in the walls. The door slammed behind her and she turned, against the door stood the woman she had so far only heard. She cut an imposing figure in the cold white light, at 5&#8217; 10� she was of slim build, her blond hair was scrapped back into a ponytail&nbsp; accentuating the full shape of her long face, her eyes where piercing blue and large and her lips blood red. She wore a fitted white blouse with a black lace up waist cincher over the top which forced her breasts up and made her waist appear tiny. Under her black pencil skirt she wore fishnet stockings and high heeled shiny black court shoes, she looked Suzzanne up and down. 

In comparison she looked tiny, standing in her stockinged feet she dishevelled, her hair untidy and her evening dress was dirty and torn from the evening events and her ears where still ringing from the grenade. �Well, well what have we here?� she mocked �Miss Midsummer isn&#8217;t it one of M.I.7&#8217;s finest?
Suzzanne was taken aback she knew who she was and she tried to not let the surprise show in her face.
�Nothing to say? Well no problem we have been tracking you from the moment you entered the Schloss, and we know you had an accomplice Miss Taylor. You two have been part of a scam to keep our real plan hidden, the information you so easily obtained is false, lots of rubbish about diamonds and false accounting, it will be ages before M.I.7 see through it. You see so we let Miss Taylor escape and kept you, see it makes our scheme seem just that bit more plausible, makes it look like we really didn&#8217;t want you to have that �worthless� information� and she smiled a cruel cold smile.
Suzzanne said nothing but inside she seethed with anger, Sophie was hurrying back to report and deliver the disinformation and there was nothing she could do.
�Still� continued the woman �your little foray into our den left quite a body count, you M.I.7 agents don&#8217;t care who you hurt do you?, poor old Hugo, well he should have known better but Frau Steiner was just supposed to add to the drama and she ended up dead too!�
Suzzanne looked daggers at the woman, if she could have done so she would have killed her on the spot.
�Right let&#8217;s get on anyway, can&#8217;t stand chatting all day, but search you for anything you may have hidden, get her on the table�.
Instantly two of the guards manhandled Suzzanne towards the heavy table, she struggled but quickly she was spun around and dragged backwards onto the table and forced onto back. She grimaced and wriggled as the cuffs bit into her wrists as her arms were pinned beneath her. Pinning her down by the arms the guards locked her legs with their own to prevent her kicking out. The woman appeared at the side of the table holding up her hands as she finished snapping on a pair of black latex gloves. �You hold her head� she said to a third man, as the goon lent over her Suzzanne snapped her head from side to side but&nbsp; he placed one hand across her face pressing down and squeezed her nostrils closed with his thumb and forefinger cutting off her air. With the other hand he grabbed her chin and pushed down. Suzzanne hissed through gritted teeth as she fought but he was strong and her jaw was forced open.
�Good� said the woman as her black rubber covered fingers began to explore around the agents teeth. Suzzanne spluttered, half choking, gagging as the finger probed well into the back of her throat, she could smell and taste the latex and it seemed to be taking far longer than it should have!
�Right nothing there� she said, self-satisfied as if she had done a thorough job, �strip her then turn her over�.&nbsp; 
Releasing her head the guard produced a small sharp knife and proceeded to cut the shoulders of her dress, then lifting the neckline her slit the material down the front of the dress until he met the slit coming up from the side. As the other two guards hoisted her upright the dress fell away. Twisted around to she felt tension in the back of her bandeau style bra before it too went loose and dropped to the floor. Her breast were firm and still showed the effects of Frau Steiner �play� but the woman took no notice �everything off� she barked.&nbsp; In response the guard twisted her round to face the table and forced her down so that she was bent over at the hips, again they used their knew to lock the agents legs against the table. Suzzanne struggled feebly, she could feel the guard pulling down her hold ups and then his hands were on her hips and she felt her sheer panties yanked down exposing her pert derriere to the room. The guard stepped back hurriedly secreting the tiny panties in his pocket as a trophy as the woman stepped forward.
�Now let&#8217;s see what we can find� and Suzzanne stiffened as she felt the cool touch of the lubricated glove between her legs. The hand gently slid over the lips of her sex as if feeling the shape, Suzzanne squeezed her eyes tight shut and waited. Slowly the wandering fingers applied pressure and her sex began to part, then slowly she felt a finger slide inside her and begin to probe around, �Hmmm slippery is that from me or you� she mocked, Suzzanne flushed pink. �It&#8217;s very tight my lovely young thing and Suzzanne felt all four fingers enter her. 
�Nnnnnnnnnggggg� she grunted as with a twisting motion the woman began to work her whole hand into the agent&#8217;s pussy.
�There� she said again in the self-satisfied tone as Suzzanne let out a gasp followed by a low moan. Standing behind Suzzanne her wrist hand disappeared between the widely spread lubricant coated lips of her sex. �Now let&#8217;s just see� and a look of concentration came over her face and Suzzanne let out a small cry as she felt the intruder stretching her inside begin to move. Even the slightest movement of the hand inside her caused her intense discomfort and the woman&#8217;s movement were slow and persistent as she gauged the muscular contractions of the agent&#8217;s pussy around her wrist. After what seemed like an eternity she said, �No nothing there� and Suzzanne tensed as she felt the hand begin to withdraw, biting down on her lip as the widest part of the hand exited her, her legs sagging as the woman examined her gloved handed glistening with the juices from deep within Suzzanne&#8217;s sex.
�Not finished yet� and Suzzanne knew immediately what she meant.
�No please I&#8217;ve nothing hidden, I swear!�
�Well we&#8217;re going to find out if you are telling the truth, deep breaths now� and Suzzanne felt her buttocks being spread. �No!� and she struggled against the guards grip, the woman smirked as she watched her tight brown sphincter contracting. �Now it&#8217;s going to hurt if you fight me� she said in a mock caring tone.
Smearing the coating of her gloved hands around the puckered ring she slowly introduced the tip of one finger into orifice. �No don&#8217;t �cried Suzzanne � Aaaarrrrrrrrrrrr� she screamed as the digit forced its way inside the insignificant amount of lubricant the proving ineffective. � Oh sorry did that hurt?� cooed the woman.
�Fuck you� spat Suzzanne tears welling in her eyes, but her torment wasn&#8217;t over yet, the finger forced its way in up to the knuckle as it probed deeply then a second equally dry finger stretched her further and she cried out again. The woman continued to twist her fingers inside the struggling agent, holding her steady by pushing down on the base of her spine, she was impervious to the screaming&nbsp; knowing full well she was the source of the torment, then without warning she stopped withdrawing her fingers out and pulling off the latex gloves. Suzzanne lay sobbing on the table.&nbsp; 
�She&#8217;s hiding nothing�.&nbsp; 
Just then the door open and another guard entered, �Miss Brubaker� he stammered.
The woman turned dropping the balled gloves onto the floor, �What is it she snapped� clearly irritated at the interruption.
�We, we&#8217;ve got a problem, the information�.
�What? Spit it out you imbecile!� she snarled
�The data that was downloaded from the Computer tonight by the M.I.7 operatives, well we checked the logs to make sure they had copied the files you had set for them and ��
�WHAT?� she shouted
�They didn&#8217;t just copy the file they copied everything!�
Sophie twisted; she could see the woman a red flush spreading up from her neck.
�WHAT DO YOU MEAN, THEY COPIED EVERYTHING?�
The man looked cowed, �They copied all the data files on the computer, all of them�
�And what was on the computer?� he voice quieter but cold.
�The transportation, distribution and exposure plans� he said almost into his chest.
Suzzanne saw the woman&#8217;s body tense and her fists ball, then without warning she lashed out backhanding the man across the face, snapping his head to the side. �YOU IDIOTS� she screamed, �YOU FUCKING IDIOTS!�
The man backed away and Sophie could see blood on his fingers as he cradled his face.
She turned to Suzzanne, �YOU! no wonder you made sure your accomplice got away, well she won&#8217;t get far. She turned back to the guard, �Send a team to retrieve that information NOW!!!�
The man jumped and seemed to shrink as he backed away, �Yes Miss Brubaker, right away� and he turned almost sprinting out the door.
�I can&#8217;t believe the fucking incompetence� she hissed to herself, then catching site of Suzzanne's wry smile, she lunged forward, �You can wipe that fucking smile off your face bitch, your friend won&#8217;t get far and then you will both pay.
 
CHAPTER 4 

Back at the hotel Sophie stepped out of the shower and began to towel herself down, the tunnel had allowed her to escape from the Schloss but in parts she had been forced to wade neck deep in stinking mud and stagnant water. She had arrived dripping and filthy at their car and had stripped off her ruined gown and cleaned herself up as best she could. Wearing little more than a raincoat she had slipped up the service elevator and back to her room. On arrival she had reported successful acquisition of the data and Suzzanne&#8217;s probable capture to Control and her orders had been explicit, either extract&nbsp; Agent Midsummer or terminate her dependent on circumstances and her own discretion, Agent Midsummer was not repeat not to be left alive in Weitzman&#8217;s hands. Sophie checked her equipment, pick locks, a silenced 9mm Sig Sauer pistol in a fitted shoulder holster, a thin bladed double edged stiletto in a fitted thigh sheath, flexible steel garrotte and the injector pen of fast acting nerve poison should she need to end the suffering of her colleague. She laid out the pair of knee high kitten heeled boots and her black fitted cat suit. If she could not extract Suzzanne she was to kill her, kill a fellow agent, someone she had worked alongside, a colleague who had covered her back and sacrificed her own freedom to allow Sophie to get out with the information. She took a deep breath and then exhaled loudly through pursed lips. She would get Suzzanne out alive, if she was still alive!

�Yes Sir, yes somehow they got everything not just the selected information, I understand, yes this will mean a change in plan� she paused nodded, listening intently to the deep voice on the other end of the scrambled phone.&nbsp; 
�Indeed Sir I have a team ready to contain the other agent now and yes we still have Midsummer�.&nbsp; She paused again he face a mask of concentration as she listened. 
�Ok Sir, yes that&#8217;s clear, kill Taylor, ensure any evidence is incriminating but not obvious� she paused again taking in further instruction, � Can I just confirm that Sir, you want her dumped? , No, no Sir I&#8217;m not questioning you, I just wanted to be clear, we are to let Midsummer go!� 

Sophie&#8217;s contemplation was disturbed by a knock at the door. �Room service, I have a telegram� said an accented voice. Sophie froze for a second, them wrapping herself in the towel she replied �OK� and she slipped the Sig from its holster. Moving towards the door she hid the weapon in the folds of the towel. As her free hand reached for the door she heard a noise behind her and the curtains by the French windows rippled slightly, she turned raising the pistol but as she did so the room door burst open slamming her against the wall and a silenced round smacked into the lintel above the windows, at the same moment two dark clad figures entered via the French windows. As she re-aimed the pistol her wrist was grabbed by a third assailant entering from the corridor who pinioned her against the wall and began slamming her hand against the wall until her grip on the gun was broken. Sophie jerked her knee up hard into her attacker&#8217;s crotch with no effect. However her attacker retaliated with two swift straight finger jabs just below her ribs which winded her. She then found herself flung back into the room and the clutches of the other two intruders. The towel fell away as her arms where grabbed and locked behind her, the other attacker began landing blows into her midriff, she tried to defend herself but her kicks where either parried or sidestepped. The third attacker having closed the room door and retrieved the gun now joined the fray. Sophie now felt more hands on her and punches crashed into her belly, breasts, ribs and kidneys, a knee came up into her bare pussy with such force that she doubled over from the pain. Releasing their grip she fell heavily to the floor, her mind spun. A soft soled boot pressed down firmly across the back of her neck and she felt her wrists being pulled behind her back before they were fastened with zip ties, her ankles were crossed and fastened the same way. �Ok get her up� came a female voice.
Sophie was hauled up onto her knees and forced back onto her haunches, she grimaced as the plastic ties around her ankles bit tight, strong hands held her shoulders as two of the intruders flanked her. The figure before her wore black fitted overalls, gathered at the waist and she could clearly see that her captors were all women. The leader pulled off her ski mask; she was blond with grey eyes and chiselled features. She regarded the naked agent kneeling before her before slapping her hard across the face, Sophie&#8217;s head slammed back and her stinging cheek began to redden, her eyes burned with contempt as she stared back.

�Now Miss Taylor, you took something from my bosses tonight and they want it back, so where is it?�
�You&#8217;re too late I sent off the information as soon as I got back� Her reply was rewarded with another slap.
�I don&#8217;t believe you, so, let me see� she looked around the room, �Ah good� as she spotted the laptop on the table. 
�Transmission log� she said absentmindedly as she tapped some keys, �Damn!�
�No password, sorry!� mocked Sophie
�Give it to me please�, Sophie said nothing, �Give it to me� and she slapped her again, Sophie stayed silent.
�Never mind� and she gathered up the laptop in a small black grip before withdrawing a Ziploc containing a silenced automatic pistol. Sophie stiffened but her captors keep a firm grip on her shoulders and she watched as with gloved hands the woman lifted the pistol from the bag and cocked it. �This is the weapon your colleague used to aid your escape this evening and now it&#8217;s the weapon she is going to use to kill you�. Sophie felt her captors release their grip and almost in slow motion she watched the gun sweep up towards her, the silent black �O� of the muzzle, PHUT!, PHUT! the gun spat twice and Sophie felt as if she had been punched in the centre of her chest, looking down she saw two small holes which immediately began to trickle bright red blood, there was no pain only surprise, she looked up eyes wide at the woman before, PHUT!, The gun jerked again and a red spot appeared on Sophie&#8217;s forehead, he eyes glazed and she slumped forward a pool of crimson soaking into the carpet. 

Suzzanne awoke to the sound of repeated tapping and she was surprised by how bright it was, a voice was echoing in her head, �Aus Aus!� &nbsp; Her head was pounding and her mouth dry but her wits were quickly about her.&nbsp; The noise was coming from a Police Officer rapping on the window of the car.&nbsp; Popping the car she levered herself out in the daylight, screwing up her stinging eyes against the bright light. 

�Runde gegen den Wagen, Schnell!� barked the officer, backing away, as her vision adjusted she could see he was reaching for his holstered weapon.&nbsp; Thinking quickly Suzzanne spun around and compliantly placed her hands on the roof of the car. The Officer slipped his handcuff over her left wrist and began to pull her hand down behind her.&nbsp; In the car window she could see his reflection and he was still holding his gun. In a blur of movement Suzzanne yanked her cuffed wrist down and then in up in front of her thereby pulling the surprised policeman closer, twisting she pulled him around to her left by the cuffs before using her right hand to knock his gun arm up and outwards. The pistol fired with a sharp crack as his finger reflexly gripped the trigger but by now the gun was pointing wildly upwards.&nbsp; Twisting sharply back the other way she used her cuffed wrist to yank the officer across in front of her to meet her knee. She drove&nbsp; heel of her right hand under his chin snapping back his head before pulling his back again by his collar where his descending face again me her upcoming knee� he crumpled to the icy tarmac, his pistol skittering across the road.&nbsp; Quickly Suzzanne found his keys and released her wrist.&nbsp; As she moved she noticed the black overall she was wearing was heavily blood stained down the front and it was this that had spooked the Officer. 

She took stock of her surrounding; nothing was recognisable except she was in the car Sophie and her had hired for the mission. She drugged the unconscious man over to his patrol car and heaved him in the back seat, the searched the both cars. 

In the patrol car she found a greatcoat, gloves and fur hat, in her car she knew Sophie has stashed a change of clothes to use if they need a disguise and lifting the boot floor she found a T shirt, black leggings and knee boots.&nbsp; Cuffing the officer she fired a couple of shots into his car radios and then in the radiator before hurling the gun in to the scrub,&nbsp; although she needed a weapon she could afford to be found with a Police issue pistol.&nbsp; 
The she stripped off the bloody overalls and pumps and redressed in the new clothes, finally slipping the greatcoat over the top.&nbsp; Starting the car she drove off not sure where she was.

CHAPTER 5 

�Gentlemen what do we know? Geoffrey do you want to start us off?�&nbsp; The middle aged man at the head of the long polished table turned to face a younger man to his left.
�From the information available it seems our agents Midsummer and Taylor successfully entered the target building and secured the information. Their escape however was compromised and they had to shoot their way out, during the escape Agent Midsummer was captured covering the escape of Agent Taylor.&nbsp; Agent Taylor contacted us last night from her hotel via secure satellite to give us this story. She also transmitted the information which is now in the hands of decoding. She requested further instructions re: Agent Midsummer. As per standard operating procedure she was told to either affect a rescue or eliminate Agent Midsummer�.

He paused referring to his hand written notes. �In the early hours of this morning our station in Munich received a call from or contact in local law enforcement.&nbsp; Agent Taylor was found dead in her room�. 
He took a moment to circulate pictures showing the dead agent bound with zip ties face down, another shot of her torso and face showed the three dark dots of the entry wounds. 

Information from the local police suggests she had been assaulted and bound before being shot.&nbsp; A weapon was found at the scene, early forensics show traces of Agent Midsummer&#8217;s DNA.�&nbsp;&nbsp; The men around the table remained impassive.

He continued, �This evening a Bavarian Traffic Officer was assaulted and rendered unconscious by a woman fitting Agent Midsummer&#8217;s description before she escaped.&nbsp; She was found in the car hired for the mission on a deserted road not far from the target building, her clothing was heavily blood stained, that blood is Agent Taylor&#8217;s. Therefore Gentlemen there is every possibility that Agent Midsummer has been turned or has gone rogue�.

One of the men spoke next, addressing his comment to the head of the table, �so how much credibility do we put in the information sent by Agent Taylor Control?�

�At present none, but continue decoding, and have your sections start looking for reasons why Midsummer&nbsp; may do this, check her last missions, bank dealings, personal life, everything.&nbsp; I have to say it doesn&#8217;t look good, Agent Taylor killed M.I.7. style after what looks like some form of interrogation, evidential traces linking Midsummer to the killing. One possibility is Midsummer didn&#8217;t want Taylor to send us the information.&nbsp; Taylor tells us that Midsummer didn&#8217;t make it back to the hotel with her, but evidence suggests she returned later and killed Taylor.&nbsp; I think at present gentlemen we take nothing for granted�

The men rose to leave Control spoke again, �Geoffrey will you stay a moment�
Geoffrey Chilcott returned to his seat and he and Control waited for the room to clear. �Geoffrey what is your own assessment of this?�
�Well control I think it very likely that Midsummer has gone rogue, some of her most recent missions have been to say the least traumatic, she required quite a long period of recuperation after her South American mission, and since then her evaluations have been at times borderline. Loose she could be a real danger to M.I.7�.

�Are you saying she would turn what she knows against us Geoffrey?�

�I&#8217;m afraid there is every possibility Control, she has already demonstrated she is willing to terminate �7� operatives, who know what grudge she may have developed?�

�Indeed Geoffrey, you may be right, I think for the time being we have no alternative, put out a capture or kill notice on Agent Midsummer!�

Geoffrey Chilcott nodded and rising from the table gathered his sheaf of papers into the manila folder, Control watched him leave, pondering the decision he had just made.

Entering his office Chilcott dropped into his desk chair and flicked a button on his desk intercom, �Sylvia hold my calls, no disturbances�.

On his desk he set up a small laptop with a satellite transmitted, smiling he logged in.
He began to type:

Burned asset now subject of capture or kill, ensure latter if opportunity presents.
Stolen information now tainted.

He pressed send.
After a short delay letters flicked across the screen.

Make sure stolen information is totally discredited, repeat DISCREDITED!

He closed up the laptop and slipped it back into his briefcase, he flicked the intercom again, �Sylvia, memo to all stations, plain language: Agent Midsummer capture or kill, and p.p. it from Control�

Nobody took any notice of the brunette, wrapped in a grey greatcoat sipping coffee. Suzzanne was pondering her position, she had eventually found her way back into town and parking the car up in a side street made her way back to the hotel to contact Sophie but the hotel was swarming with police and men in dark coats who spoke into their sleeves!. Slipping around the back she had engaged some of the kitchen staff in conversation at the same time scrounging a little food. Apparently a woman had been tied up and shot in her room, none of the staff had been allowed on that floor, police and �spooks� had been asking questions.

When she returned to the car she found 2 police officers present and carried on walking until she came to the coffee shop, now she was sitting in the back near the fire exit but with a clear view along the length of the shop, she had found some change in one of the coat pockets and need something warm.&nbsp; Now she was trying to piece it all together.&nbsp; After Miss Brubaker outburst Suzzanne was hauled back onto the table by the two remaining men, she fought as she thought they were going to rape her but instead a chloroform soaked cloth was forced over her face and she slipped into oblivion. When she awoke she was in the car with the policeman knocking on the window with no idea how she got there.&nbsp; Once she knew Sophie was dead it started to fall into place, she was being set up.&nbsp; The blood stained clothing she had been dressed in, other evidence probably existed to incriminate her as she guessed correctly it would seem she was being held up as Sophie&#8217;s assassin.&nbsp; She knew she needed more information, people, M.I.7, other local agencies would be looking for her but she still had time on her side, nobody knew where she was, but once she appeared on someone&#8217;s radar her time was limited. Draining her coffee she knew she had to start somewhere and that somewhere was M.I.7, she would head for the Munich station.

CHAPTER 6 

She stood across the street from the upstairs flat that housed the Munich M.I.7 station, 32 Elbe Strasse.&nbsp; She knew that at this time only two junior staff would be present, to send and receive messages.&nbsp; She slipped around the back of the building and up the fire escape. Checking the landing outside the flat she found the two intruder alarms and disabled them with ease and slipping off the bulky greatcoat she lifted the heavy sash window and eased herself inside. She could hear music and moving silently through the flat she traced it to small room, lit where she could see the back of a man&#8217;s head. She inched closer, then once she was sure he was alone, she entered and before he even sensed her presence a blow to the slips for the last 36 hours, and she searched quickly across the desk until her hand fell on a pink folder.

She flicked through the memoranda, checking the transmission times until one caught her here, it read:


Mission compromised, agent dead, agent missing, await further information.

Subsequent transmissions read.


Missing agent believed rogue. Has terminated friendly asset



Missing Agent is Suzzanne Midsummer. Capture or Kill.


She read the last slip of paper with mounting horror, she was right, they did think she had killed Sophie and now she was target number one!&nbsp; She had to get out, move, keep off the radar until she could figure what to do.&nbsp; She scanned the room for anything useful, then she saw the wallet poking from the operative back pocket. Prising it out she flipped it open, and pocketed the few notes it contained, she felt bad, like a common thief but it had to be done.

�Step away and put your hands on your head NOW!� said a voice, and Suzzanne dropped the wallet. Slowly she placed her hands on her head and began to rise, turning to face the voice. Before stood a freckly redhead of a girl, skinny in jeans and jumper�. The other operative, more problematic was the black automatic she was aiming at Suzzanne&#8217;s middle.
�What have you done to Craig� she moaned, �what have you done you bitch?�
�He&#8217;ll be Ok, believe me, he&#8217;s not dead, just out cold for a while�
�Why are you stealing his money, who are you and what are you doing here?�
�Look� said Suzzanne calmly �put down the gun, I&#8217;m not going to hurt you�
�Too fucking right� came the reply �down on your knees� and the gun wagged menacingly.

Suzzanne hesitated just long enough and from behind her came a moan.
�Craig� yelled the girl and distracted Suzzanne lunged forward, slapping the gun from her hands and pitching her to the floor. In second Suzzanne held the gun and the girl scuttled over to the prostrate man.&nbsp; She noticed the girl was sobbing quietly.&nbsp; 
�I&#8217;m not here to hurt you; really I just need some help some cash�

By now the man was sitting up holding his head and the girl was huddled next to him clinging to his arm. 
�What hit me? He bemoaned.
�She did� wailed the girl and he looked up at his assailant and his face dropped.
Suzzanne thought for M.I.7 operatives they were pathetic but then they were only office monkeys.
�I need any money, cash you have both of you now� she barked
�What and then you are going to kill us like you killed Agent Taylor you traitor?�
His words stung and for a moment she considered blowing his head off!
�I never killed her I&#8217;m being set up, now you money and I&#8217;ll be gone�

Minutes later Suzzanne dropped back onto the street and with the pistol and a sheaf of message slips deep in the pockets of her greatcoat she slipped unseen into the night. Upstairs whilst the girl sobbed hysterically Craig sent a memo to London, Suzzanne Midsummer was back on the grid! 

A tele-printer clattered into life at M.I.7 headquarters and the Duty Officer folded his Newspaper and turned in his chair to face it. After it had completed its task he tore off the sheet of paper and scanned it. The message was coded but the name of the recipient was plain enough and he picked up the phone and pressed one of the row of buttons, �Mr Chilcott Sir, a message� 

Some hours later Suzzanne sat sifting through the message slips she had taken from the Mission.&nbsp; She had booked into a small rooming house, paid cash and given the name Gerda Hertz. On her way she had employed one of her numerous �skills� to disable the alarm and break into a small supermarket, silently trawling the aisles for essential items.&nbsp; Once locked in her room she had showered, washing away the sweat and grime of days on the run. She had sat for some time under the cascade of hot water pondering her situation before towelling off and eating some of the high calorie food items from her haul.&nbsp; Then she slipped on some fresh underwear savouring the sensation, whoever had dumped her in the car had just dressed her in the blood stained T shirt and overalls.&nbsp; She read the slips with increasing alarm. Sophie had escaped and reached the hotel, there she had transmitted the stolen information to London. Then she had asked for permission to rescue Suzzanne and been advised to attempt rescue or terminate. Then there was a gap of some hours, time Suzzanne had been held at the Schloss.&nbsp; Next was a flurry of messages, Agent Taylor had been found dead in her room, bound, beaten and shot execution style. The gun used had traces of Suzzanne&#8217;s DNA on it (how convenient she thought!)&nbsp; Next a woman fitting Suzzanne&#8217;s description and wearing heavily blood-stained clothes had assaulted a Police Officer. Now she knew definitely she had been set up clearly by Weitzman and Brubaker. They must have sanctioned Sophie&#8217;s murder and incriminated her, but why? Sophie had already sent the information by then so why kill her and blame Suzzanne?&nbsp; Then the Capture or Kill order was sent from London authorised by Control. By now she thought London would now she had visited the Munich Mission and would be looking for her.&nbsp; The answers she sort would only be in one place, The Schloss. She had no alternative but to return there.

CHAPTER 7 

Back in Control&#8217;s office Geoffrey Chilcott sat facing his boss. �It&#8217;s all too convenient Control, it tells us everything we would want to know, it must be a plant!�
The information Sophie Taylor had sent back had been decoded and revealed a great deal of detailed information about the organisation that Weitzman fronted. He also knew the information was totally accurate; its loss a disaster of potentially catastrophic proportions and his Masters had set him the task of damage limitation.
�I agree Geoffrey but look at the other facts, why did Midsummer murder Taylor and is she working for the Organisation or some other agency. Have we had no information regarding her whereabouts yet?�
�No Control, nothing� he said aware of the folder message from Munich in his jacket pocket. �Control� he continued �I think this information has to be put on ice until we can corroborate its authenticity, we can&#8217;t tell the Americans and we must keep it secret from our own brother agencies�.
�Yes I do believe you are right Geoffrey; lock it down until further notice�
�Yes Control� and he rose tucking the folder marked �TOP SECRET EYES ONLY� under his arm.&nbsp; Once back in the sanctum of his office he placed it in his safe spinning the combination to lock it.&nbsp;&nbsp; He had the only copy and only he and control had seen it, then only to read.&nbsp; He would switch it with the planned dis- information his agents Midsummer and Taylor had been set up to steal and destroy the original.

Suzzanne lay hidden in thick undergrowth overlooking the Schloss. The binoculars she had stolen were cheap but gave her a good enough view of the comings and goings. She had been making notes, timings of deliveries etc.. Twice she had seen Brubaker leave in her black Mercedes CLK and she had a pretty good idea how to breach the perimeter and get in. She lifted the binoculars one more time sliding the focus to sharpen the image when her view of the Schloss disappeared completely.&nbsp; Dropping the glasses the obstruction became a pair of legs in heavy boots and camouflage trousers, she rolled to her left as a rifle butt crashed down where her head had been seconds before, rolling the other way she avoided another strike and gathered herself to lunge at her attackers legs but before she could spring a second rifle butt connected with her skull just behind her right ear and she crumpled lifeless to the ground.&nbsp; One of the men hoisted the lifeless woman over his shoulder, the second gathered her few belongings, then they faded back into the wood.

A key rattled in the rim lock and a swarthy thick set man with a black moustache entered the room. The man in the armchair turned away from the TV to face him but did not rise.
�Why have you called me back?�
We found a woman watching the castle; she was alone so we captured her and brought her here. We&#8217;ve looked through her stuff, she was making notes, she had noted the movements of the targets, she had nothing on her to identify her and her equipment was cheap, commercial, non-military but she was armed� and he picked up the pistol Suzzanne has stolen from the M.I.7 station.
�Hmmmm� the man paused, then seemed to listen, there was an intermittent mewling sound he could hear.&nbsp; �Did she put up much of a fight?�
�Not really, we surprised her�
�Has she said anything yet, and what is that noise?� he interjected, the mewling having returned.
�Oh Cem is questioning her next door� and he tipped his head towards a closed door before returning to the news program he was watching. 
The big man walked to the door, lit a cigarette and took a long drag before blowing a cloud of blue smoke into the air then he opened the door, the noise immediately became louder.

A half-naked Suzzanne was bound across the bed, her wrists secured to either side of the head with leather straps. One leg was straight out the ankle tied to the centre of the foot of the bed. Her other leg was stretched painfully up and a length of strap attached it to the same post as her left wrist, the effect was to spread her legs as if she doing the splits. Several length of black duct tape sealed her mouth and from the bulging of her cheeks it was clear her mouth had been packed beforehand.&nbsp; All that remained of her clothing was her bra and that had been pulled down to expose her breasts. Lying next to her on the bed was a younger man, slim, clean shaven; a cigarette dangled from his lips as he intently continued his work.

With one hand he was roughly manhandling her breasts, squeezing, kneading them in turn, twisting and tugging her nipples. With his other hand he worked a vibrating massage wand which buzzed angrily at full speed up and around her slick gaping sex. The man at the door took in the scene for a moment, the woman was bucking and twisting, pulling at her bounds, from behind her gag came a louder version of the sound he had first heard in the other room, a grunting, whining noise which rose and fell as the wand moved. Her big breasts were bright pink from the man&#8217;s ministrations and clearly very sensitive, her skin glistened with sweat and her breasts and stomach heaved as she struggled. He could see her pussy was shaven and the lips of her sex puffy and red, the spread folds of her pussy glistened and her clitoris was fat and engorged. Cem was carefully sliding the oscillating head of the ward around the outside of her pussy before centring it and&nbsp; in a sliding motion moving up between her lips&nbsp;&nbsp; further parting them&nbsp; before arriving at her sensitised bud where he held it with a slight circular motion before beginning the process again. It was the last part of this action which was having the greatest effect making the captive arch and thrust involuntarily against the device, her head thrown back he moaning cries filling the room.&nbsp;&nbsp; The bedding between her thighs was soaked with a mixture of lubricant and the woman&#8217;s own juices. Cem looked up and smiled, �nearly there he said� and almost instantaneously Suzzanne reached another crashing orgasm, straining, arching before sinking back onto the bed her head lolling to one side.

�Has she told us anything yet Cem?
�No nothing, I gave her the opportunity to squawk but she stayed silent so I had no choice but to work on her didn&#8217;t I honey� addressing the last part of his statement to the bound woman still working the wand slowly over her clitoris.&nbsp; Her eyes flashed anger before she squeezed them shut tossing her head from side to side as she felt another orgasm building. He pussy was a molten pit of pain and pleasure, the man had been working on her for over two hours without a break, forcing orgasm after orgasm from her weakening body.

�Cem give her break, see if she wants to say anything now, it looks like she might have had enough persuasion�
�Ok boss� and he flicked off the ward and Suzzanne almost deflated like a balloon.
The big man leant over her, the scent of musk, sweat and cigarettes was intense, �Do you feel like talking to us now?�
Suzzanne nodded her head and he reached down and ripped off the tape. Suzzanne winced as almost as one he pulled the ball of wadded cloth from her mouth, he knew what it was from the lacy edge; Cem had gagged her with her own panties. She coughed and spluttered her mouth dry from the cloth, �drink please� she rasped almost silently.
Cem had rolled off the bed and returned with a bottle of water and lifting her head held it too her lips to drink. The water was cool in her mouth and she wished he would pour the rest over her burning pussy!
�Who are you? The questioning began.
�My name is Gerda Hertz� she replied sticking to her cover.
�What were you doing at the Castle, taking notes, comings and goings, why?
�I was planning to break in see what there was to steal, must be silver, paintings something I could fence, I need some money�
�Really, so you&#8217;re just a common thief then are you, so why didn&#8217;t you just tell us this and save yourself all this discomfort?
�I said nothing as I didn&#8217;t know who you were, you ambushed me, you&#8217;ve got guns I was frightened, I thought if I said nothing eventually you would let me go then he started on me�. Cem smiled from the chair in the corner.
�OK for now� he said �we&#8217;ve got some checking to do Ms Hertz and if you don&#8217;t smell right we will carry from where we left off. Efe come in here�
The other man entered �What Boss?�
�Untie her but cuff her�&nbsp; 
The two men went to work freeing her legs first. He thighs burned as she closed her legs the tortured muscles of her inner thighs protesting, then they freed one hand at a time slipping a pair of handcuff onto her wrists. She made no move to escape, yet, they still thought she was just a cheap thief not a highly trained spy. Leaving her sitting on the bed they left the room and she soon heard them talking. 

Listening carefully through the door she heard them discuss the Schloss, Weitzman and Brubaker, they were three Turkish hoods and they spoke there native tongue not realising their captive was multilingual agent. They had been sent by their boss a local gangland boss to kill Weitzman, it seemed he or his organisation had reneged on a drug deal and the boss wanted his honour restored. For some time they discussed their plan to ambush his car and their bolt hole and escape route, vehicles etc.&nbsp; Good Luck, though Suzzanne these three goons were well out of their league, Weitzman&#8217;s men would cut them to pieces. Then they turned to discussing Suzzanne, and the language turned somewhat ribald and there was a lot of laughing. 
�We will have to kill and dispose of her Boss� said Efe.
�I agree� came the deep reply �it needs to be clean no mess�
Cem interjected �can we have a little fun first, she is very� and he must have made a gesture as they all laughed. Quickly she considered her options, the room had one door and the window opened but was barred, no escape there. They clearly considered her little threat to them as they planning to rape and then kill her. She knew she would have one chance to get the upper hand. She heard the big man leave and Cem and Efe continued to talk and watch TV.
After an hour the big man returned, and they talked for a while more then she heard the chair rattle and the door open. Sitting on the edge of the bed she mentally prepared herself.

Cem and Efe entered the room, 
�Well seems you&#8217;re a nobody Gerda so we can let you go but it looks you need a bit of cash so why don&#8217;t you be good to Efe and me and we&#8217;ll see you right� lied the younger name thinking he would gain her compliance
�What do you mean?� said Suzzanne feigning innocence
�You know�&nbsp; and he made a gesture of pumping his index finger between a ring formed of the finger and thumb of his other hand, smiling.
�No� said Suzzanne, �I&#8217;m too sore after what you did, just let me go I don&#8217;t want anything and I&#8217;ll say nothing to anybody�
�Oh come little Gerda maybe a bit of suckee suckee for me and my friend her then?� and her began to pull down the zipper of his jeans. 
 She frowned, playing them along �Ok then but then I can go right? Take off these cuffs so I can use my hands�
Smiling, Cem released the cuffs and watched as Suzzanne slipped off the bed and knelt before him, he would let her pleasure him but he and Efe would fuck her anyway whether she wanted it or not. Looking up at him she unbuttoned his&nbsp; jeans and tugged them down to his knees, then she slipped her hand down the front of his now bulging briefs and released his thick brown cock, it smelt musky very musky. Glancing she could see Efe leaning against the door frame watching, drawing on his cigarette, in the waist band of his trousers was Suzzanne&#8217;s pistol.&nbsp; She gently but firmly began to pump the young man&#8217;s shaft feeling his member turn to rock. He was circumcised so she spat onto her hand to provide some lubrication. With her other hand she reached up and began to massage his ball sack. Cem was in heaven, his eyes closed �Suck it baby suck it� he mouthed. 

Then his eyes open wide and his mouth formed a silent �O�.&nbsp; Suzzanne&#8217;s hand had suddenly tightened around his scrotum at the same time she pulled down and twisted, her other hand was wrenching the man&#8217;s tool in the other direction as her nails dug into the shaft. As she began to rise Cem began to scream and his arms flapped wildly. Efe jerked upright the cigarette dropping from his mouth, seeing his friend panicking he fumbled for the pistol and drawing it pointed it at Suzzanne.&nbsp; As she saw his finger tighten on the trigger she twisted Cem across her body and felt him jerk as the bullets hit him in the back and his face twisted in pain and surprise. Releasing her grip on him she spun him round and thrust him forward and he collided with Efe in a tangle of arms and legs, as the pistol clattered to the floor she ducked forward to scoop it up and firing she hit Efe square in the forehead and his brains painted the wall behind him before he collapsed under Cem&#8217;s deadweight. 
By now the third man, hearing the commotion and shots filled the doorway; shouting and Suzzanne levelled the weapon and fired again. �Click, Click, Click� it was either jammed or empty but she had no time to find out. Seeing the gun jam the big man thundered at her roaring, she straightened up, ducking sideways under a swinging arm, but the other arm caught her in the ribs and the heavy impact propelled her across the room and onto the bed.&nbsp; The big man followed meaning to finish her as she rolled over pushing herself upright on the bed struck a fighting pose. He grinned showing his big yellowing teeth, Suzzanne was dwarfed by his bulk and to him she looked easy meat. Once he had subdued her he would take her before slowly choking the life from the little bitch, or so he thought.&nbsp; He charged forward again and she side stepped his clumsy move landing three straight finger jabs under his ribs and into his kidney area as he passed. He howled in pain and came at her again, his spade like hands clutching for her, she ducked down and punch after punch hit him square in the belly winding him, then sidestepping his closing arms she smashed her elbow back into the side of his face and blood and teeth sprayed from his mouth. Roaring like a wounded bear his hands grappled for her but she was making for the door. At the last minute his fingers caught her hair and he yanked her back.&nbsp; Slammed against his chest she felt his arms close locking her arms by her sides and he lifted her off the ground. She struggled unable to get any purchase; she kicked back but found no soft target her heel bouncing off his tree like thighs. She heard him laugh
�Got you bitch� and with a grunt his arms tightened, with another grunt they tightened further. She was caught in a crushing bear hug, her ribs bending the breath forced from her lungs, he grunted again and his grip constricted further, she could hardly move, breath, anything, her legs flailed uselessly.
�No escape now� he rasped in her ear , �getting difficult to breath is it, can you feel your ribs bending, I used to be a Turkish wrestler, I&#8217;ll crush the breath out of you before I fuck you to death� and he grunted again consolidating his grip.&nbsp; Suzzanne could feel the life being squeezed out of her, the edge of her vision was turning pink, and she had a few seconds more before it was too later.&nbsp; Thinking quickly she first let herself go limp, her head slumping forward, then she relaxed everything, the last of her breath spilling from her lungs.&nbsp; 

He first felt something warm on his legs then he heard the trickle of liquid as it splashed onto the floor as Suzzanne&#8217;s bladder emptied. Looking down he saw the yellow streams running down the inside of her thighs and pooling between his boots. Believing she had passed out he released his grip a little and a smidgeon of air rushed back into Suzzanne&#8217;s lungs but she stayed lifeless. He moved toward the bed still intent on having his way with her and he dropped her onto her back on the bed. Still she did not move, she was out cold, good and he leaned in over just to make sure, suddenly her eyes flicked open and her straight fingers jabbed upwards into his throat fracturing his larynx. Simultaneously she thrust the index and middle fingers of her other hand into his eyes temporarily blinding him, He jerked up screaming, staggering backwards holding his throat, a hand to his eyes. Suzzanne was off the bed, she scooped up the gun and jerked back the slide ejecting the jammed round, cocking the hammer and chambering another round. He was crashing around the room still clutching his throat and eyes blabbering, a mist of blood spraying from him with every breath. Slipping behind him she pressed the gun into the middle of his back and fired, two muffled bangs and blood sprayed from the front of his chest, he slumped to his knees, swayed and then toppled backward blood filling his gaping mouth, single red bubble welled up, popped and he moved no more. Suzzanne stood breathing heavily, naked, smoking pistol in hand surveying her handy work, messy she thought but effective. 
 
CHAPTER 8 
Suzzanne checked the apartment door was locked and waited to see if there was any response to the shots, after half an hour there was nothing so she found the bathroom and showered. Washing her hair she then spent a long time letting the water play over her tender breasts and nipples before allowing the soft fingers of water to sooth her battered pussy. At home she might have used the shower to bring herself off but not today, her pussy needed a rest!
Towelling off she padding naked round the apartment stepping over the cooling bodies of her abusers.&nbsp; Finding her clothes piled in a corner, she redressed trading her T shirt for one of the men&#8217;s from his overnight bag then she searched the bodies taking a watch, money credit cards, mobile phone and a mini-recorder. Stashed in a closet she found a bag of weapons, duct tape, a hood, kidnapper kit. Making sure there were no traces of her being there she left the windows open and double locked the door, with the weather so cold it would be days before the stench of death would become noticeable.

She hid the bag of weapons back at her room and taking the cash and cards headed out. She planned to use the cards just today before destroying them.&nbsp; She had a list of kit and clothing she needed and 3 hours later returned to her room. She had carefully placed all of her purchases into one rucksack to hide the fact she had been shopping and she had burnt all the receipts along with the cards.&nbsp; Once inside she spread out and checked everything. She was almost ready. 

In the subdued light of his study Geoffrey Chilcott sipped his single malt.
�So there&#8217;s been no further trace of her? Yes I&#8217;ve shelved the report of her attack on the Munich mission but I won&#8217;t be able to keep it quiet indefinitely.�
He sipped his drink again before continuing to speak into the satellite phone set up on his desk.
�Indeed, I would guess she is still somewhere local and to be honest the longer she is at large the better it would be if she ends up dead.� 
He paused listening.
�Yes of course if you find her kill her, but it&#8217;s either got to look like she was killed escaping or she just got to disappear, no traces, no witnesses you understand?� 
He nodded as if answering questions then �Yes yes I&#8217;ve got the file, I plan to destroy it and replace it with the product you were supposed to let them take�. He stopped for a moment, �Well of course it&#8217;s your bloody fault Miss Brubaker.&nbsp; I know he is not happy but frankly I&#8217;m not taking the fall for this, you had better get your house in order and deal with Midsummer before she becomes an embarrassment to us both!� and he put down the handset.

A figure in dark trousers and blouson jacket dropped from the wall and lay flat in the undergrowth. Crawling forward Suzzanne looked for the tell-tale glint of a trip wire or infra-red beam indicating an intruder alarm. She had with her an aerosol can of deodorant bought on her shopping trip which she used in short bursts ahead of her pick out the traps before stepping over or around them.&nbsp; After half an hour she was against the wall of the Schloss and she gathered herself together. She knew from her initial mission briefing the points of entry and planned to ingress near the servants changing room. Reaching the heavy door I the wall she waited. As she had seen during her reconnaissance the servants often sneaked out to smoke and after a few minutes yellow light spilled out as the door opened.&nbsp;&nbsp; Short fat man in a waiter&#8217;s jacket stepped out and lit a cigarette before taking a long drag, then after a few moments he moved slowly into the bushes, a few seconds later she heard splashing and a gentle sigh.&nbsp; Moving quickly she peaked around the door and seeing no one around slipped in side and into the ladies changing room.

The room was deserted and quietly she tried the lockers doors with no luck, then she heard voices and the door began to open, she ducked into a janitor&#8217;s cupboard and pulled the door closed. Through a louvre on the door she saw two maids enter, opening their locker they took out bags and shoes then as one said her goodbyes the other began to get changed out of her uniform. As the other woman left Suzzanne slipped from the cupboard as the woman turned her back Suzzanne doubled back and appeared to come out of the shower room. The woman turned and as she saw Suzzanne and nodded hello.&nbsp; Then the woman looked a little puzzled at the woman wearing combat boots and trousers and a zip up jacket, she straightened up.
�Hi I&#8217;ve not seen you before, are you new here?�
�Yes� replied Suzzanne&nbsp; �I just started this week�
�Which Department are you with?� she queried, her face still quizzical
�Oh, Housekeeping, I&#8217;m still finding my feet� and she laughed
�Housekeeping? Really, I&#8217;m� BANG!  Suzzanne&#8217;s fist crashed into the side of her head, slamming her against the locker and cutting her dead before she slid to the floor.
�Shut up with all the fucking questions will you� finished Suzzanne. 
Quickly she dragged the unconscious girl to the janitor cupboard before binding her wrists, ankles and knees with duct tape finishing the job with a gag.&nbsp; 

A few moments late Suzzanne stepped out of the changing room, her transformation complete, she adjusted the starched white cuffs, apron and headpiece of the maid&#8217;s uniform before heading deeper into the Schloss.&nbsp; Remembering the layout from her briefing she moved upstairs, she needed to find Weitzman&#8217;s office.&nbsp;&nbsp; Crossing the wide entrance hall she headed for the first floor, the she heard a voice �Make sure my car is outside in an hour� and glancing across she saw the terrifying figure of Miss Brubaker as she berated one of the houseboys. Keeping her head down Suzzanne raced up the stairs two at a time, not daring to look back until she reached the landing.&nbsp; Pausing briefly to get her bearings she was just about to move off when, �Hey you there� another voice. She turned as a butler hurried up to her.
�Those rooms are done, the Conference Room table needs clearing, don&#8217;t dawdle� and he turned on his heel. Suzzanne, her head down throughout slowly walked off in the direction he had indicated before doubling back before finding herself on a deserted corridor. Finding Weitzman&#8217;s office she knocked gently and waited, then she knocked again. Satisfied there was no answer she twisted the handle and slowly peered around the door. The well-appointed office was empty; almost bare in fact, just a large desk and leather high backed chair, no paintings or any of the opulence she had imagined.&nbsp; Quickly she started searching the desk drawers but they were all empty.&nbsp; She checked one of the filing cabinets, again empty, the memo pad was pristine white and for a moment she thought she might be I the wrong office. She had an uneasy feeling about this, Weitzman&#8217;s office should have been the hub of his criminal activity, instead it was devoid of anything. Her anxiety levels were rising and she knew she had to go and she moved back towards the door. In her mind her escape route was planned and turning right out of the office she headed back towards the landing.

�Miss Midsummer� a familiar voice said loudly and panic rising she spun around. Stepping out from a curtained alcove Miss Brubaker smiled like a reptile as levelled a pistol at Suzzanne&#8217;s midriff. Suzzanne started, her eyes wide and she began to turn to run straight into the two heavies who appeared behind her, she struggled briefly but quickly the men had her restrained her arms locked with theirs behind her.

�Well Suzzanne I didn&#8217;t expect to see you again so soon especially as now on so many wanted lists�
�You bitch�, spat Suzzanne �you set me up, killed Sophie�
�Yes, yes we did and quite brilliantly too, but enough of my successes, you must be extremely desperate or phenomenally stupid to come back here so which is it?�
�Fuck you Brubaker� she fired back
THWACK! Brubaker&#8217;s hand smacked across Suzzanne&#8217;s face, knocking her head back and the agent tasted blood.
�Your insolence in the face of failure astounds me Midsummer, there&#8217;s no escape for you this time and nobody to come rescue you, you are all alone� and she drove her fist into the woman&#8217;s belly, doubling her over in the arms of the heavies, who hauled her upright again.
�Take her up to my apartments, we need to continue this questioning there, put her on the bench� and the two men frog marched Suzzanne away.

Brubaker picked up the phone on Weitzman&#8217;s desk, � Chilcott, stop worrying she&#8217;s turned up here and we have her. Yes don&#8217;t fret, she&#8217;ll disappear� and she laughed her cold laugh.


Suzzanne twisted and tugged her wrists inside the padded steel shackles that held her. �The Bench� Brubaker had spoken of consisted of a two metre sided triangular dais mounting a central steel post.&nbsp; Atop the post on a tubular arm was a narrow padded leather platform just under a metre long and at 45 degrees from the vertical.&nbsp; Extending from close to the bottom of the central post were more tubular arms pointing to each corner of the triangular base, each ended in a padded steel shackle.

The Heavies had dragged Suzzanne into the room and had forcibly stripped her of the maid&#8217;s attire, leaving it shredded; any attempt by the agent to resist was met with a volley of blows to her belly and ribs. Then they had forced her onto the dais and against the padded platform face first. Heavy One had then fastened the wrist shackles before attaching them via a chain to fastening at the top point of the triangle; meanwhile Heavy Two manhandled her ankles into the shackles on the ends of the arms. Suzzanne was now standing legs spread her body lying against the padded platform which extended from her hips to her underarms. Its angle meant she was bent forward from the hips and her arms were pulled uncomfortably over the top and down by the chain. The narrowness of the platform meant her breasts hung either side. Suzzanne struggled for a while after they left but realising it was futile began to try and take in the details of her prison.&nbsp; The platform was placed directly in front of a large mirror so Suzzanne could see every detail of her predicament. The room was darkly decorated but she could see a sideboard along one wall and a tall cupboard next to it. 

She heard a door open and close and then the tap tap of heels and in the mirror she saw Miss Brubaker approaching, smiling. 
�So Suzzanne, once again we find ourselves together and maybe this time I will get to finish what I started�
�Go to hell Brubaker I&#8217;m burned, worthless�
�As an agent maybe, but you still have something I want to know�&nbsp; She walked around behind the agent taking in the view. Although they had stripped her of the dress she still wore the maids black stockings and suspenders&nbsp; and Miss Brubaker leered at the swelling beauty of Suzzanne&#8217;s buttocks framed by the lingerie. Between them she could see the plump fullness of the agent&#8217;s sex leading up to her pigmented creased ring of her anus.&nbsp; She stepped forward and landed a stinging blow with the flat of her hand to one cheek, then the other, THWAK!, THWAK!&nbsp; Six blows one after the other. Suzzanne flinched gritting her teeth to the pain. Then she felt the woman&#8217;s fingertips trail over the sensitised skin before another half dozen blows.&nbsp; Miss Brubaker repeated this process a dozen times before she spoke again.&nbsp; Suzzanne&#8217;s buttocks were now glowing pink, burning, but it was nothing she could not bear, she had experienced worse.
�Now Midsummer perhaps you would like to tell me why you came back�
�Crawl back under your rock� 
�Now Suzzanne� she said silkily, �I just want to know what you came back for, just tell me or I&#8217;m going to cause you a great deal of pain�.
The palm of her hand hit home loudly leaving Suzzanne&#8217;s buttocks clenched.&nbsp; Again Brubaker repeated the pattern of strikes, each delivered with ferocity.&nbsp; Suzzanne twisted her wrists and ankles, trying to distract herself from the fire in her cheeks. 
Brubaker was stroking her hand over the glowing skin again, this time letting her manicured fingers followed the cleft, she flinched as a nail briefly brushed her ring then it was tracing the line along her sex.
�So beautiful and so sensitive� murmured Brubaker, �the source of such pleasure and such pain� her nail lightly scraping the woman&#8217;s labia, �Now tell me why you came back Suzzanne, what where you looking for in the office?�
Her captive remained silent.
�Very well then� and Suzzanne watched her move over to the sideboard in the mirror, moments later she returned and Suzzanne heard a series of sharp Vvvvviiiiiiiipppppps!  as Brubaker swished a thin almost transparent plastic switch through the air.
�Stop me any time you want to answer Midsummer� and Suzzanne heard&nbsp; Vvvvviiiiiiiipppppp! before a line of liquid fire course a line across her bottom. 
Vvvvviiiiiiiipppppp! another line of pain, Vvvvviiiiiiiipppppp! another and another until six in all.
Suzzanne was biting down on her lip, at no point had she cried out, but her fists were clenched, knuckles white and she felt a trickle of sweat run between her breasts and down the leather pad.
�It&#8217;s plastic, very thin, whippy, hurts like hell doesn&#8217;t it?&nbsp; watching the criss cross of lines across the woman&#8217;s nates slowly gaining definition as they swelled into thin red welts edged in white.
�Nothing to say?&nbsp; Ok then let&#8217;s continue�.

 This time Brubaker stood directly behind Suzzanne and skilfully flicked the switch so that it lightly kissed the inside of her spread thighs making the agent flinch in painful anticipation each time.
�Talk to me Suzzanne�&nbsp;&nbsp; and the switch stung her thigh above the stocking top, first one side then the other.&nbsp; Suzzanne stamped her feet like a tethered mare trying to avoid the blows.
Brubaker appeared beside Suzzanne and lifted her head by her hair and looking her&nbsp; straight in the face said 
� Look Midsummer, tell me what I want to know or I&#8217;m going to start using this on that sweet little cunt of yours and I won&#8217;t stop until you talk, understand me?�
She stared straight back at Brubaker saying nothing and her tormentor dropped her head with a huff of derision before taking up position behind her.
Vvvvviiiiiiiipppppp! the first blow landed between her spread legs, Suzzanne grunted.
Vvvvviiiiiiiipppppp!  this time viciously striking the tender petals of her sex, she twisted in her bonds; sweat began to bead across her back.
Vvvvviiiiiiiipppppp!, Vvvvviiiiiiiipppppp! , Vvvvviiiiiiiipppppp!&nbsp; it felt like, but she couldn&#8217;t actually describe the pain it was so intense!
Vvvvviiiiiiiipppppp! Vvvvviiiiiiiipppppp! Vvvvviiiiiiiipppppp! a cry leapt involuntarily from her lips, high , shrieking splitting the room, Brubaker smiled.
Vvvvviiiiiiiipppppp! Vvvvviiiiiiiipppppp! Vvvvviiiiiiiipppppp! Brubaker had her rhythm now and the blows landed quickly at regular intervals, Suzzanne was screaming with each hit, sweat trickled down her spine and tears creased from the corners of her ears, she twisted and writhed with each impact.
�STOP,&nbsp; STOP� sobbed Suzzanne hoarsely, �please stop, that&#8217;s enough� 
Brubaker dropped her arm, her breathing faster from the exertion, �Ready to talk?
�Yes yes� sobbed Suzzanne. 
�So why did you come back, what where you looking for?�
�I wanted to find out why I was set up and who killed Sophie Taylor� she gasped between sobs.
�So what were you doing in that office?�
�I thought Weitzman&#8217;s office would be the best place to start, he&#8217;s the boss after all�
�Oh Suzzanne, you people are so na�ve and foolish, Weitzman is just a front man, he runs nothing, he&#8217;s a fat fool we use to give us an acceptable face.&nbsp; We all take our orders from someone much higher.�
�So that&#8217;s why the office was empty� gasped Suzzanne, realising she had made a grave error.
�We knew you were coming here to steal information, the story about the Mossad agent story, it was all set up� crowed Brubaker.
�What?� said Suzzanne incredulously.
�You were set up from the start Suzzanne, you and Taylor were sent here to steal some information, remember, you had the code, the location, everything you needed� she chuckled.
�We planned it all�
�Why� asked Suzzanne
�To wrong foot our enemies, you the Americans, whoever is opposing us, yes we had planned for you to steal that information and take it back, but it was actually dis-information to&nbsp; mislead you.&nbsp; 
�But we got the information, Sophie escape with it, why did you kill her and set me up? Was that part of the plan too?�
�No no, unfortunately it didn&#8217;t go to plan, that fool Weitzman screwed up and you escaped with real intelligence about us. We realised but by then it was too late, the information was back in London.&nbsp; So we changed the plan, I had Taylor liquidated and got you blamed. That why we could discredit the information in London and that should have been the end of it, but no, bloody Agent Midsummer wouldn&#8217;t play her part!�
Suzzanne despite her discomfort was thinking clearly now, Brubaker had been caught off guard and was now giving her information, she pressed on.
�So how can you discredit the information in London, surely once they analyse it they will know?�
Brubaker laughed, �We have someone inside, you think you are so clever, but we are everywhere and everyone has their price, we&#8217;ve got people in many key places and one of them is in M.I.7� she said, arrogance dripping from her words.
Suzzanne pushed it, �Who� she asked innocently.
Brubaker turned, �Oh no don&#8217;t think I am an idiot Midsummer, yes I&#8217;ve probably told you too much already but actually it going to make no difference how much you know but you can go to your grave wondering who set you up�. Her smile fading her eyes narrowing.
�Anyway, thank you Suzzanne, you&#8217;ve told me what I needed to know, you are clearly here alone and nobody is likely to come rescue so let&#8217;s finish what we started shall we�

Grabbing Suzzanne&#8217;s hair she yanked her head backward, then she roughly applied a length of duct tape across the agents lips, Suzzanne struggled, surprised, fear returning. Brubaker applied two more pieces of tape, pressing them home before releasing her hair. Then she picked up the switch from the sideboard. Suzzanne struggled twisting and bucking in her bondage realising Brubaker intended to take up where she had left off.
�Now� she said thoughtfully � let&#8217;s see if we can be a bit more creative�
Vvvvviiiiiiiipppppp!  the thin switch clipped Suzzanne&#8217;s pert nipple making her scream into the gag, her eyes wide.&nbsp; Another stroke made her breast jump, burning a bright red line across it.
Brubaker kept up the assault&nbsp; until Suzzanne&#8217;s orb was bisected by lines of scarlet, her nipple pink and angry, then she moved her attack to the other breast. All the time she appeared oblivious to her victim&#8217;s screams and violent struggles. After replicating the violence on the other breast she stopped briefly before returning with a thin leather whip. Unspeaking she held it before Suzzanne showing her the knotted tip.
�Mmmmmmmoooooooooo� she moaned as Brubaker to up position behind her, she heard several sharp cracks as the woman practiced her action then the lash burned across her back and her whole body stiffened in agony.&nbsp; With accomplished accuracy Brubaker landed strike after strike leaving raised crimson lines on the agent&#8217;s pale skin inflicting intense pain but never breaking the skin.&nbsp; She stopped for moment, Suzzanne was slumped over the platform, thin lines of sweat streaking her flanks, her eyes were closed her breathing laboured.
She flexed her wrist once more snapping it back and forwards and the tip of the whip flicked venomously out striking between the agent&#8217;s buttocks, Suzzanne reared up, her scream soundless and intense piercing pain touched her anus, Brubaker laughed, pleased with her work as the tip kissed&nbsp; the agents already abused pussy.&nbsp;&nbsp; She planned to whip Suzzanne within an inch of her life, why? because she could and because she would enjoy it .

�Miss Brubaker� said a loud voice and she turned dropping her arm; a tall heavily built man had entered.
�Ah I see you&#8217;re enjoying your work again? �he said a heavy accent that seemed slightly familiar to Suzzanne.
�Yes Sir� she replied, �She has caused us no end of trouble�
�Indeed Miss Brubaker indeed� he replied �But we need to move from here now, tie up any loose ends�
He lifted Suzzanne&#8217;s head �Hello Miss Midsummer� he said softly.
Suzzanne&#8217;s eyes flickered open focusing on the heavy features, ruddy cheeks, silver brush cut, whiskey breath and crooked nose! He eyes registered recognition and flashed hate.
�Yes Miss Midsummer we meet again and once again you are at a disadvantage.&nbsp; I see Miss Brubaker has been taking care of you, I would have like to have done so myself, we had such an enjoyable time I seem to remember until you tried to kill me� his voice spitting venom. 
Through the pain Suzzanne forced a smile seeing he still carried the result of her head-butt!
�However� he continued releasing his grip �It&#8217;s not to be, we have work to continue� his hand fondling her buttock, reminding of the battering they had endured 
�and you Miss Midsummer� his hand slid between her legs over her swollen pussy lips, his thick fingers probed prying apart the abraded skin and she stiffened rising on her tip toes as his digits pushed inside her �need to turn up dead!�.
His fingers continued to roam inside her for a moment, enjoying the restrained woman&#8217;s obvious misery and discomfort. 
�Miss Brubaker we have arranged for Miss Midsummer to meet her end evading arrest at the hands of the local police, get her ready and see nothing goes wrong�
�Yes General� she replied smartly, and the big man strode out of the room surreptitiously savouring the musk of the woman on his fingers.

CHAPTER 9

The Heavy bundled Suzzanne down the cold back stairs and into the garage area, Miss Brubaker heels tapping down the stairs behind them.&nbsp; Agony racked Suzzanne&#8217;s body, her breasts, back and buttocks burned at the touch of her clothes and her swollen pussy chafed spitefully in the jeans they had found her to wear.&nbsp; Her wrists were cuffed behind her but otherwise she was unfettered. Once in the garage Brubaker told the guard to wait with Suzzanne whilst she retrieved something from her car. Suzzanne knew this was her best opportunity and as Brubaker disappeared out of sight Suzzanne feigned a faint and slumped against the man. He moved to catch her and as he did she straightened up catching him under the chin with her head, at the same time her knee came up connecting with the soft contents of his trousers. As he doubled over she threw her weight into him slamming into a concrete support and pinning him she brought her knee up repeatedly until he dropped. Finishing her attack she used her hip to cannon his head into the support and he fell in a heap. Quickly she felt in his pockets ignoring her pain as she found his keys and unlocked the cuffs. 

Hearing Brubaker&#8217;s heels returning she readied herself, gauging the right moment to spring. Brubaker&#8217;s mouth fell open as Suzzanne appeared in front of her and before she could react she was felled with a single blow.&nbsp; Dragging the unconscious form to the black Mercedes, she worked swiftly binding her wrists and ankles with tow rope before tying a cloth across her mouth, then she bundled the woman into the boot. She slipped on Miss Brubaker&#8217;s coat and tied a headscarf around her head slipping on a pair of sunglasses sitting on the dash.&nbsp; She looked at herself in the vanity mirror, in a moving car she could pass for Brubaker or any woman for that matter but if they stopped her �.well, she slipped the pistol between her thighs, cocked and ready before she gunned the sleek black sports out of the garage and down the drive.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 
Speeding down the drive she tooted the horn and flashed the lights, and as she hoped the gate guards recognised the car and swiftly swung the gates open, in moment she was through and out onto the road, dropping a gear the engine revved hard and she&nbsp; sped off back toward town.
 
Brubaker twisted helplessly in the ropes that bound her, Suzzanne had a plentiful knowledge of bondage techniques which her nemesis was now experiencing first hand. A foot square heavy wooden post protruded three feet from the floor, Brubaker was bound tightly to the post with ropes at knee and ankle, her feet spread to the width of the post, she still wore her shoes and dark pantyhose, otherwise she was naked. Her wrists and arms were bound behind her in a shoulder wrenching reverse pray tie and the ropes securing her arms had the effect of highlighting her small hard breasts.&nbsp; Rope looped around her waist was pulled tightly up between her legs and buttocks and was cinched off around the post and held her firmly against it at the hips.&nbsp; Suzzanne had also plaited rope into her long blond hair before passing the rope over a beam, this pulled her upwards keeping her back straight and with her hair pulled up and back accentuated her slender neck.&nbsp; To finish Suzzanne had packed her mouth before applying several pieces of thick tape.&nbsp; In the cool interior of the barn her thick pink nipples were hard yet her skin was covered with sheen of cold sweat.&nbsp; 

Suzzanne sat in an old threadbare fireside chair watching her captive struggle, Brubaker, obvious fear in her eyes knew what was in store for her, only hours before she had been mercilessly, brutally whipping the woman sat before her and now the situation was reversed, her arrogance and overconfidence long since departed.&nbsp; Tucked under the rope around her waist was a long black box from which a thick black wire looped out and down the front of her pantyhose before disappearing between her legs.&nbsp; Suzzanne had improved the device from a Taser she had found in the bag of weapons, the business end of which now lay nestled between the lips of Brubaker&#8217;s sex held tightly in place by the crotch ropes.

Perversely Suzzanne was enjoying seeing her enemy in such a humiliating position but she had a purpose.
�You know how this works bitch but this time it&#8217;s me asking the questions OK?�
For a moment Brubaker regained her resolve and glared at Suzzanne her blue eyes flashing hatred but then Suzzanne thumbed the small remote in her hand and the hate was replaced with surprise before her face twisted into a rictus of pain, Muffled cries came from behind the gag and tears welled in her eyes. 
Suzzanne held up the device �this is the Holy Fuck Button, felt like a bomb went off in your cunt right?�
The woman was breathing hard, made doubly difficult by the gag; her tears caused her makeup to streak around her eyes and down her cheeks in black clumps. Suzzanne thumbed the button again and Brubaker reared against the post, shaking her head from side to side silently before emitting another muffled scream.
Suzzanne watched curiously, Brubaker was staring straight ahead, her chest rising and falling quickly, her washboard stomach moving in sync, yet as the pain subsided her eyes drifted down to the device in Suzzanne&#8217;s hand, her eyes still wide with trepidation.
�Look at me bitch� yelled Suzzanne and the eyes flew to Suzzanne&#8217;s.
�I want to know who you&#8217;ve got inside M.I.7 right�
Brubaker shook her head, before arching, rising on her tip toes as if trying to escape the searing stabbing electricity coursing through her pussy.
Suzzanne waited a moment, � you want more?� and she thumbed the button again.
After three or four more shocks Brubaker was sobbing into her gag, tears streaked her cheeks with black, Suzzanne watched impassively. She held the device up again, gesturing, Brubaker shook her head emphatically.
She yanked the tape from the woman&#8217;s face and held up the dicta-phone recorder.
�Who is your contact in M.I.7?�
Brubaker continued to sob, gasping for breath.
�Tell me , who is it, who have you got inside M.I.7?�
She looked at the recorder, understanding the gravity of her situation, once she had said the name her life would be over, having betrayed the organisation they would kill her.
�Please no� she sobbed �they&#8217;ll kill me if I tell�
�and I&#8217;ll fry your pussy if you don&#8217;t, so front up� and she waved the remote, her thumb wavering over the button
�NO NO please not again� Brubaker was crying openly now �it hurts, it hurts so much!�
�Tell me� said Suzzanne softly
Brubaker began to babble, spilling information, contact networks, locations, regional controls, contact names, information about the organisation, Suzzanne all the time allowing the recorder to run. 
Eventually she slowed and Suzzanne returned to her original question.
�Who is your contact in M.I.7, who is it just give me the name�
No no, I can&#8217;t, you don&#8217;t understand, you don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;ll do, what they are capable of�
�Tell me Brubaker or ZAP!� and she raised the control again.
Knowing it was futile, Brubaker blurted �Chilcott, Geoffrey Chilcott�
She must have seen Suzzanne&#8217;s face change for in a moment and her haughtiness and swagger returned, � Ha ha ha ha� she laughed, �Yes he&#8217;s right next to your precious Control, right now and nobody has a clue, you won&#8217;t live long enough to tell anybody Midsummer you&#8217;re a���

Her mouth opened into an O and then a tortured, primordial animal shrieking rent the barn as Suzzanne held the button down her nail white.
�Shut your fucking dirty mouth, shut up! SHUT UP! SHUT UP!�&nbsp; She yelled her world reeling.
The woman in front of her was writhing , struggling, twisting, shrieking like a banshee and then silence.
Suzzanne had dropped to her knees, head down, still holding the remote and the recorder. The remote slipped from her hand and for a minute she did not move then she looked up.
Brubaker was motionless half hanging half sagging from the post, her eyes were open but vacant, her tongue, blue protruded from her mouth, she was dead.

Slowly Suzzanne rose, flicking off the recorder, normality was returning now and it shocked her, Geoffrey Chilcott, second in command at M.I.7 was a mole, a traitor!&nbsp; She had to warn Control, she had to get back to London!&nbsp;&nbsp; 

She shook herself out of her stupor and a faint smell of burnt skin and nylon crept into her nostrils reminding her of her own pain and injuries, she would clear up in here later.

Half an hour later she lowered herself gingerly into the bath of steaming water, as the water kissed her buttocks she flinched as every whip mark reasserted its presence, but she continued to lower herself,&nbsp; gritting her teeth as her flayed pussy&nbsp; slipped beneath the surface. Eventually she was in submerged up to her neck and the water was now soothing her injuries, she allowed herself to think as she soaked.

Eventually she noticed the water had cooled and she rose dripping and began to pat herself dry. The Turkish hoods had ensured the farmhouse was a suitable place to hide out and she had found a first aid kit and began to apply a calming balm to her wounds, gently smearing the faintly scented ointment carefully over and between the lips of her sex, grimacing as she did so.&nbsp; Dressing she chose some suitable clothes from the small wardrobe she had purchased with the credit cards. Plain black roll neck sweater and skirt, knee high boots.&nbsp; Having checked Brubaker was dead she and made a few preparations in the barn and house. She dropped her holdall of clothes into the boot of the Mercedes and slid into the front seat checking she had the recorder and hiding the pistol in the gloves box.&nbsp; She pressed a small button on a remote and green light changed to red as the sport car accelerated down the drive. As she reached the gate she stopped and checked in the rear view mirror. The was a muffled boom followed by a louder one as all the windows in the farmhouse blew out and flamed shot out of the roof of the barn.&nbsp; She paused, happy the property was fully ablaze before setting the sat. nav. for London. 

CHAPTER 10
The Mercedes streaked along the autobahns eating up the miles, Munich, Stuttgart, up into Belgium and onto the French coast and a ferry to England.&nbsp; A couple of times she dozed at the services but a need drove her on. At services just outside of Calais she stopped and bought a mobile phone.&nbsp; Sitting in the car park she rang M.I.7 headquarters.&nbsp; The operator answered.
�Dawlish Haulage can I help you?� 
�Yes I need to talk to Mr Dawlish Senior about an inbound shipment� replied Suzzanne giving the code words that have should get her put through to Control�
�Hold please caller� came the reply, there was a click.
�Where is the shipment inbound from caller?�
�Bavaria� Suzzanne replied, there was another click. She knew her call was being recorded and tracked, in a moment they would have her location and GPS signal.
�Mr Dawlish Senior here, how can I help you� she recognised Control&#8217;s clipped tones.
�Control it&#8217;s me Agent Midsummer, I need to come in, I&#8217;ve been set up, I need to come in now�
�Midsummer, it may be too late, you may have gone too far to come back?�
�Control listen, I&#8217;ve been set up, I can&#8217;t say much now but you need to debrief me it&#8217;s important, there&#8217;s been a breach in security, I have the name but I need to come in first�
�Ok tell us where you are an we will pick you up�
�No, no I can&#8217;t do that, you and I must meet, just you and your security, nobody else�
OK, go to safe house 9, I&#8217;ll meet you there, contact me when you arrive�
Control, understood, sorry I&#8217;ve got to go, I&#8217;ll be back in touch� and she hung up.&nbsp; She knew by now they would have her location and pulling the SIM card from the phone she snapped it, dropping out of the car. 
Geoffrey Chilcott waited until he heard Control&#8217;s handset go down then her hung up and redialled.
�She outside Calais, watch the south coast ports and rail crossings, see if you can pick her up there�.
Then he dialled the switchboard, �Chilcott here� he said cheerily.

Suzzanne was now heading north up into Holland to make her ferry crossing well away from the South Coast, she knew they would have located her and would now be staking out the ports,&nbsp; heading north would give&nbsp; her a better chance of getting in England undetected. What she didn&#8217;t realise was someone else was tracking her. 

It had taken them a while to realise Miss Brubaker had gone missing, eventually someone had found the dead goon in the garage and the Mercedes missing but by that time Suzzanne was on her dash across Europe.&nbsp; Hidden within the car was a tracking device which the General has dispatched men to locate. They had located the car in Northern France and were racing towards it when it had started moving north, now they were on an intercept course. Suzzanne had switched plates on the Merc each time she had stopped as Services stealing the plates from parked cars but that made no difference to the trackers who could now see the black sports car just a few lengths ahead.&nbsp; The silver panel van hung back confident their prey could not elude them.

At the ferry port Suzzanne booked her ticket and cabin for the overnight crossing in the name of Tania Brubaker, having found her passport in the car.&nbsp; She knew passport control would be sloppy and it only took a little flirting and her cabin number to distract the middle aged official.
Once on board she headed for the Pursers office and quickly arranged a cabin switch sighting&nbsp; she didn&#8217;t realise her cabin was inside and she need a porthole.&nbsp; Change made she headed several decks down to her cabin, away from the general hub bub of the ferry. The two men following her now began to prowl the public areas of the ship waiting for their prey to appear.

Locking the door behind her Suzzanne made a few checks, hiding the recorder and cleaning the gun before she showered off the grime of the road trip. The marks of her ordeal where fading now and although her labia still felt very bruised.&nbsp; Redressing she slipped a small flat handled, thin bladed knife down her boot and locking the cabin behind her went upstairs to the bar.&nbsp; As she ordered a double Jack Daniels she scanned the bar area, single business men, lorry drivers, families with children all milled about&nbsp; but hidden in the throng two men seated at either end of the bar spotted the curvy young woman in black drinking alone. One of them surreptitiously pointed his phone in Suzzanne&#8217;s direction before sending the image.&nbsp; Bored in the bar Suzzanne wandered out onto the deck and leant on the rail watching the water churn past the side. Holland was a thin line on the horizon and the sky was darkening as night approached. It was cold and blustery on the deck and the wind whipped around her bare booted legs lifting her skirt and exposing her shapely legs and flashing her black panties and she wished she had worn tights. 

Back in the bar the man&#8217;s phone flashed and he punched a button.&nbsp; Target is Suzzanne Midsummer M.I.7 agent, apprehend and return , approach with caution subject is dangerous. The man nodded to his colleague who was enjoying the effects of the wind as he watched the woman at the railing.&nbsp; 

Suzzanne felt cold and turned to go back inside, as she pushed open the bar she noticed a man watching her enter, as her gaze met his he spoke smiling.
�tis cold outside no?� his accent thick.
�Yes, yes it is� she replied&nbsp; heading for the bar to meet Jack.
Hopping up onto a bar stool she ordered another drink , she slipped off her leather jacket and dropped it next to the bar. Sitting side on to the bar, she crossed her legs and sipped her drink. She sat pondering the events of the last few days, across the lounge another man was looking at her until his wife punched his arm and berated him and she realised crossing her legs in the short skirt was attracting too much attention. She swivelled back to the bar and to her left the man was standing.
�Hello again, I buy you a drink?�
She smiled , �No thanks�
�Please� he said �we are both travelling alone, tis a long crossing, maybe we just talk?�
She relaxed smiling back �Ok but no funny business Buster!�
He laughed �Ok Ok&nbsp; I understand�
Across&nbsp; the lounge the other man pressed send&nbsp; Contact made.

As they chatted the other man stood to the other side of Suzzanne, �pint of Stella and a pack of nuts please� she heard him say behind her, then �Oh bugger!� and he ducked down to retrieve a ten euro note he had dropped, as he did so she deftly located the cabin key in Suzzanne&#8217;s jacket and noted the number, then he was gone with his beer back to the gaming machines.
Suzzanne&#8217;s admirer said he was a Romanian lorry driver on his first trip to England and he asked if all English girls where as pretty as her. She brushed off his flirtations and as he checked his phone for the fourth time she asked �Who&#8217;s texting you?�
He laughed � It my wife, I tell her I talk with pretty English girl yes?�
�Hmmmm only if you want to get into&nbsp; trouble� she replied.
He laughed closing the message, he now knew her cabin number and the plan.
Suzzanne checked her watch, it was eleven twenty seven pm.
�Well thanks for the company tonight, I&#8217;m off to bed now, night night� and she slipped off the bar retrieving her jacket.
�Ok thank you for talking with me� and he smiled. She nodded and headed for the companion way.&nbsp; He turned swiftly before heading down the opposite companion way breaking into a trot as he got out of sight. A few minutes later Suzzanne reached E deck and made her way along the corridor to cabin E235.&nbsp; As she reached into her pocket for the key a man appeared alongside her.
�Everything Ok Miss?� his voice sounded slightly familiar?
She looked up , �Yes, yes fine�
He was smiling and she felt his hand close over hers as she held the key in the lock.
�Hey what&#8217;s yo, Mmmmmmmmmm�
The other man had approached silently from behind and clamped a pad over her nose and mouth. At the same time the other man jabbed her in the stomach winding her, reflexly she breathed in and the pungent fumes filled her lungs and her head began to swim. Opening the door they hustled her inside, closed the door leaving the passageway empty and silent. 

They lifted the unconscious woman onto the bed, �quickly we&#8217;ve got about ten minutes�.
Rolling her onto her front they secured her wrists and elbows with zip ties, crossing her ankles they did the same at ankles and knees.&nbsp; Then together they pulled a fitted blindfold hood and gag over her head before fastening the zip which ran down the back. Confident she was secure they set about searching the cabin but and after 5 minutes they had found nothing other than her belongings and gun. The first man sat down to text:
Target secured, cabin searched nothing found. He waited, a few moments his phone flashed:  Excellent work, head for Stapleford airfield, transport will be available to return target. Proceed with caution.
�Ha, proceed with caution, she&#8217;s trussed like a turkey aren&#8217;t ya babe� and he slapped his hand on Suzzanne&#8217;s thigh.
Suzzanne&#8217;s head was clearing from the fast acting knockout drug and quickly she grasped her predicament, encased in the tight hood she was in totally darkness and rendered&nbsp; virtually silent, she could feel something binding her arms and legs and was aware there was somebody close by. 
She could just hear them speaking, �What&#8217;s the plan then now we&#8217;ve got her�
�Head for a small airfield and get her flown back, the General is most insistent�
Well she thought at least they weren&#8217;t any of the secret services but she knew she didn&#8217;t want to be delivered back into the hands of the General.
�So what&#8217;s next then we don&#8217;t get in till midday?�
�I dunno, shall we err, have a look at the merchandise?� and he nodded his head towards to form on the bed.
Suzzanne felt the mattress move as someone sat on the bed, she struggled and mmmppphed into the gag uselessly then she felt her sweater being pulled up, she tried to wriggle and roll but hands held her arms at the same time she heard sounds of appreciation from her two molesters. Fingers slipped into each bra cup and deftly scooped out each mound exposing the perky nipple.
�Blimey someone&#8217;s given her a thrashing said one of the men remarking on the fading pink lines that criss-crossed each tit.
�Yea well I&#8217;ve heard that Brubaker is a nasty bitch� the other remarked, by now their hands were kneading the soft flesh and Suzzanne squirmed uncomfortably. Fingers flicked and pulled at the nipples as the men joked, �Fuck they&#8217;re like chapel hat pegs� and she felt a wet mouth close over one and begin to suck noisily, �Mmmmmmmmmmmm� she moaned.
Then a hand was sliding up her thigh and she felt a draught as her skirt was lifted, again they noted the switch marks on the insides of her thighs but it didn&#8217;t deter their assault. Suzzanne felt a finger begin to rub the front of her panties then a voice said �can&#8217;t get at anything with her legs tied, turn her over�
Suzzanne felt herself being manhandled onto her front, then her skirt was lifted and she felt her pants being pulled down.
�Blimey� came an exclamation in response to the stripes across her bum. And then the assault intensified, she felt her buttocks being stroked then kneaded before fingers spread them exposing her most private areas.&nbsp; She struggled flexing and twisting dreading what was coming next as a thick finger began worming its way between her tightly closed thighs. Suzzanne grunted into the gag as the finger forced it was into her before withdrawing. She could hear the men making ribald comments.
�Sweet, it&#8217;s tight, I&#8217;d like a piece of that �
�Yes it&#8217;s a pretty little snatch alright, but the General was very clear, he wants her back and I&#8217;ll not cross him�
�Oh come on Dryden, he&#8217;ll never know and it will make no difference to her, she dead anyway once the he gets hold of her�
�No, I&#8217;ll not risk it and neither will you if you&#8217;ve got any sense�
�Oh fuck it, OK� she could hear the disappointment in the man&#8217;s voice, and she felt her pants drag roughly back up before a hand smacked heavily across her bum, �Lucky escape Sweetie but I&#8217;ll not risk my balls even for you� and she heard them laugh.
�Come on� said Dryden, let get her into the van then we can go back to the bar, I&#8217;m fuckin&#8217; starving, get the bag�
Suzzanne heard some rustling and then she felt herself being manhandled into a heavy canvas bag of sorts. Forcing her onto her knees her head was pushed down until her tits rested on her thighs, then she heard the sound of a zipper.&nbsp; A strong hand on her neck held her down as she felt the bag closing over her back and then she was trapped inside. She then felt the bag tighten as it was lifted and she felt herself carried bumping against the door frame as they heaved their cargo out of the cabin and down stairs. Then she heard the sound of a sliding door, the bag swung and she crashed down onto a hard surface, then the door slid closed and she was left in silence. She wriggled, guessing she was now inside her attacker&#8217;s vehicle.&nbsp;&nbsp; She waited a moment listening before she began to twist painfully, gradually moving her hands down her fingers feeling for the top of her boot. Deftly she found the blade handle and carefully she pulled it out before twisting it in her fingers until she could slide it under the tie around her wrists, Straining she worked it up and back and forwards until suddenly she felt the tie give. Next she stabbed the blade through the top of the bag feeling the material give, forcing her body to unfold straining the fabric further until she was free and kneeling upright. Still blinded by the hood she felt for the remaining straps and one by one cut them finally unzipping the hood and pulling it off. She sat breathing heavily on the floor of the van taking in her environment, waiting.

She dozed fitfully until the sound of the key in the lock roused her. Snapping upright she moved silently to one side of the van. She had pulled the bag out of sight and as light flooded into the dark compartment and a head and shoulder leant in. Dryden&#8217;s vision had not adjusted to the dark interior of the van before a hand grabbed his hair yanking him forward then slamming his face into the van floor. The thin blade flashed as it slid silently down behind his collar bone severing subclavicular artery before piercing the arch of his aorta.&nbsp; Dropping her knee across his neck the blade flared again this time jabbing into the centre of the man&#8217;s back thrusting upwards finding the pumping muscle of his heart. His arms flailed and she pressed down harder until his struggles weakened and he stopped moving.&nbsp; Then she pulled his body inside. There was remarkably little blood and rifling his pockets she found the van keys and locked the door.&nbsp; She checked the car deck, nobody was about and she slipped back up the stairs until she was outside her cabin.&nbsp; She tapped twice on the door.
�Yeah� came the reply, she tapped again.
�Dryden for fucks sake� and she heard movement inside and readied herself.
As the door opened she exploded into the opening pitching the room&#8217;s occupant back and across the bed. He yowled and tried to roll sideways but the snarling apparition was upon him and thumbs jabbed into his eyes blinding him painfully, his arms thrashed trying to fend off his attacker and protect his eyes. Suzzanne dodged his clumsy ripostes whilst feeling for the bottom of his breast bone and adeptly thrusting the blade up into his chest, he gasped continuing to struggle, gasped again, once more and slumped back. She waited a moment then withdrawing the blade rolled off the dead man.&nbsp; 

Gathering up her belongings and retrieving the recorder from behind the light fitting she then heaved the man into bed, rolling him on his side and covering him over. She pulled the porthole curtain, in the darkness his form looked as if he was just sleeping.

Returning the van she slung her bag into the cab, then checking she was alone she dragged the other body from the back and across to a dogged hatch cover. Lifting the hatch she checked inside, it was a storage compartment and dropping the body inside she covered it was a tarpaulin before closing and locking the hatch. Back on deck she breathed the briny air as the ferry cruised up the Humber estuary towards Hull and England.

CHAPTER 11

Suzzanne sat inconspicuously in the corner of the motorway services, an empty plate before her. Now sipping her coffee she pushed the numbers on the mobile phone.
�Dawlish Haulage� came the familiar reply
�Hello yes can I speak to Mr Dawlish Senior please� there was a delay.
�Can I ask the reason for the call?�
�It&#8217;s about a shipment� Suzzanne replied, conscious that once again her call would be recorded and tracked.
After a moment the reply came �I&#8217;m sorry Mr Dawlish Senior is currently unavailable�.
She though quickly, �Ok please take an urgent message for him, please tell the Bavarian consignment with arrive at the planned destination at 3 today�. She wanted to get off the phone.
�See that he gets that at the earliest opportunity�
�Thank you caller� and the line clicked and went silent as Suzzanne was already rising gathering up her jacket. Switching off the phone she knew would hide her GPS signal once she was on the move but it wouldn&#8217;t take long for them to arrive at the Services.
She had abandoned Brubaker&#8217;s Mercedes on the ferry and used the silver van but she knew they would have found it and at least one body by now.&nbsp; Within minutes she was back on the A1 heading for Safe House 9.

Chilcott had replaced his receiver as soon as Suzzanne had hung up and he headed downstairs collecting&nbsp;&nbsp; two coffees on the way. Poking his head into the duty room he asked cheerily.
�Beryl any messages for me?�
�Sorry nothing today Mr Chilcott�
Ok, oh do you have a pen I can borrow and I&#8217;m just about to go up to Control, anything for him?� 
�Yes, Mr Chilcott, this has just come in� and she handed she tore off a message from the pad and handed it to him with her ball point.
�Thanks Beryl� and he disappeared.
Back in his office he read the memo, then using the borrowed pen carefully added a 2 in front of the 3 and two zeros behind so that it now read �Bavarian consignment will arrive at destination at 2300 today�  then refolding the paper he gathered up the coffee and went to see Control.
Knocking on Control&#8217;s door he waited for a reply before entering. 
�Hello Control thought you might like a coffee and this just came for you�
�What is it Geoffrey, I left a message to hold my calls, I&#8217;ve got this report to the Minister to finish�.
Oh sorry Control, I didn&#8217;t realise, just knew you had been shut up in here all day�
Control looked up and smiled �Thanks Geoffrey, what does it say?�
�Here� said Chilcott handing over the slip.&nbsp; Control unfolded it and scanned the contents then spoke into the office intercom, �Sylvia, make sure the car and team are available tonight, I&#8217;ve got a late meeting�
�Yes Sir� came the female reply.
�Now Geoffrey, what can I do for you, or is it just a social call?�
�Nothing special Control� he said placing the coffee on the desk, �I&#8217;ll leave you to get on, if you are busy�
�Thanks Geoffrey, I do need to get this finished pronto�
Chilcott turned to leave smiling; he had just bought himself eight hours alone with Agent Midsummer and returning to his office he called down to the Duty room.
�Beryl get me Turners on the line please� and he put down the receiver. Moment later the phone rang.
�Chilcott, yes I need two today please, some electrical work, it may be dirty, yes they will be fine, yes I&#8217;ll pick them up� and he rang off. He picked up the handset again.
�Beryl, I will be unavailable for the rest of the day� then he opened his desk drawer and pulled out a Sig 2022 and a box of rounds, ejecting the magazine he topped it up before slipping the gun into his briefcase, then he gathered up his coat and headed down to the underground car park.

Safe House 9 was a large detached property just outside Epping, M.I.7 had acquired it along with several other properties to use as bolt holes and debriefing sites, number 9 was the most remote and as Suzzanne approached dusk was closing in.&nbsp;&nbsp; She had left the van hidden and walked the last half mile to the drive entrance, now she kept close the hedge her dark clothing making her invisible against the hedge.&nbsp; From the window Chilcott watched the woman&#8217;s figure advance through night vision goggles.
�That&#8217;s right Midsummer keep coming, we are waiting�
Suzzanne circled the house peering cautiously through the downstairs windows, the house was dark, deserted and moving to the back door she entered the 4 digit code on the lock and pushed the door open.
Chilcott heard the lock click and nodded to the man waiting with him, the other had concealed himself in a downstairs closet off the hall. 
Suzzanne was now crossing the kitchen, listening for the slightest noise.&nbsp; She knew Control would not have come alone; he would have had his security detail no doubt with orders to shoot her if necessary.&nbsp; Moving down the corridor to the hall she stopped.
�Control?�&nbsp; No reply and she waited motionless for a moment.
She moved to the drawing room door and slowly opened it; in the darkness she could see the shape of a figure in one of the armchairs.
�Control, it&#8217;s me Suzzanne Midsummer� she hadn&#8217;t drawn her weapon for fear of provoking the security detail. 
�Welcome Suzzanne� said an emotionless voice and someone flicked on the light and her blood ran cold.
The figure in the chair had a gun levelled at her as did the man who had switched on the light, a third man was now pushing the muzzle of a gun into her back urging her into the room.
 
�I see you are punctual as usual� sneered Chilcott.&nbsp; 
�Where&#8217;s Control?�
�Oh he&#8217;s expecting you a little later so you and I have some time to kill�
Suzzanne rapidly evaluated her situation and it was not good, three guns now pointed at her, she was out numbered three to one, she was in the middle of nowhere and nobody knew she was here!
�So Midsummer you seem to have some explaining to do, I need some answers�
Suzzanne thought quickly, how much did Chilcott know, was he working alone or was Control part of the deception, did he know she knew he was a traitor? She needed to keep it short, give nothing away.
�We were set up Chilcott, they knew we were coming, we were supposed to steal the information�
Really, go on�
�They killed Shannon Taylor and framed me; they have been pursuing me across Europe�
�Who is this THEY Midsummer, who set you up?&nbsp; You were just supposed to steal information from a businessman, Weitzman, are you saying he set it all up and framed you?�
�No. look, Weitzman is just a front for a bigger much more occult organisation�
�What proof have you got of this Midsummer, Taylor was shot with your gun, you broke into the Munich office and assaulted the staff, it doesn&#8217;t look good does it?�
She had to agree they had done a good job.
�I didn&#8217;t kill Shannon; I never got out of the Schloss and back to the hotel�.
�And THEY just let you go did they?� he interjected. �After you had broken in and stolen information off their computer system?�
�No they drugged me and dumped me in a car as part of the set up Chilcott�
�Indeed Midsummer, it&#8217;s just all too convenient�.
Suzzanne could feel the cold sweat in the small of her back.
�I think Midsummer you need to tell us everything, what really went on and who you are working for and we can make it easy or hard, your choice�
Suzzanne felt the grip of the men on either side of her.
�Let me speak to Control Chilcott, your contravening your authority holding me here�
�Oh I don&#8217;t think so, let&#8217;s adjourn to the cellar and continue this; these gentlemen brought some items which may help you to remember�
�No wait� she implored as the men frog marched her towards to cellar door and down the stairs.

Control closed the file and spoke into his intercom.
�Sylvia can you get me Mr Chilcott please� there was a delay then the speaker hissed
�Mr Chilcott is out for the rest of the day Sir�
�Oh, really, did he say where he was going or how to contact him�
�Apparently no Sir�
�Nothing at all Sylvia?�
�No Sir, he met with you, then made a call to Turners and then left shortly after�
�Turners you say?�
�Yes Sir�
�Ok Thank you� and he leant back in his chair pondering, why had Chilcott contacted Turners?
The name Turners was a front for a subdivision of M.I.7 that dealt with debriefing and interrogation; their operatives were skilled in coercion, persuasion, torture. 

Suzzanne twisted her wrists in the handcuffs suspending her from the cross member of a heavy wooden frame, her spread booted ankles were secured similarly to another cross member at floor level.&nbsp; Before positioning her, the men had made her strip, the cool of the cellar and apprehension of what was to come giving her goosebumps.&nbsp; The two men spent some time preparing her, working on either side of her they had wound thin copper wire around each arm from wrist to shoulder securing the end with tape. They had then repeated the procedure on her legs from groin to knee before winding wire around her chest under her bust before firmly but not over tightly circling each breast. Two throws of wire then bisected each orb horizontally and vertically trapping her nipples as they crossed. Finally wires were looped around her waist and down between her cheeks and up across her sex to be reattached to the wires around her waist.&nbsp; Bizarrely, given their trade and therefore not likely to be squeamish the man securing the final wires had donned latex gloves before spreading her bare lips and ensuring a wire passed either side of her clitoris!

His colleague meanwhile had been connecting crocodile clips to the ends of the wires around her body, the clips in turn ended in insulated cables which led back to a junction box and a larger device which she had only caught a glimpse of as she entered. She heard a hum as it was switched on.&nbsp; Chilcott had placed a chair with the back facing his victim and slipping off his jacket he straddled the chair, leant on the back and lit a cigarette. He blew a cloud of blue grey smoke into the room and look Suzzanne up and down. 

�Right Midsummer, I&#8217;m sure you know how this works, I ask questions, you tell me what I want to know or�� he took another long draw before blowing out �or�it gets quite unpleasant, for you that is�.
�Chilcott I&#8217;ve told you everything, let me speak to Control� she implored.
�This isn&#8217;t necessary� she said, playing for time.

�Sorry I don&#8217;t think you are telling me everything, so let&#8217;s get started� he nodded to one of the men standing in the shadows, he stepped forward and Suzzanne saw he was holding up a&nbsp; wooden bit gag which he gestured towards her mouth.&nbsp; Obediently she opened her mouth and he pushed it between her teeth before buckling it behind her head.&nbsp; Chilcott then nodded to the other man seated by the humming box.

Suzzanne bit down hard on the gag as her limbs spasmed from the current, her fists balled as her nails dug into her palms, it felt as if her arms and legs were trying to tear themselves off as the current coursed through her 
�MMMMMMMMMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRR!�
She visibly sagged as the power cut off before another seizure gripped her
�MMMMMMMMMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRR!�
They repeated the shocks six times before Chilcott addressed her again.
�Now tell me the truth, everything you know, tell me about the Organisation�
The man had hooked the gag from her mouth and Chilcott could see the indents made by her teeth.
�Look I know nothing about the organisation, they just set me up, I needed to get back to clear myself, I need to speak to Control�
Chilcott just nodded and the man tugged the gag back into her mouth.
�MO PLEETH MO!� she pleaded.
�MMMMMMMMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!�
�Just answer my questions Midsummer, that&#8217;s all�
�MMMMMMMMAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!�

�Thank you� and Control replaced the handset, the Duty Officer at Turners said Chilcott had rung and requested the services of two operatives for the evening, no details of the job and he had picked them up himself.&nbsp; Control brooded, what was Chilcott up to, he&#8217;d called in but said nothing about an interrogation, and who would he be breaking?

An hour later Suzzanne hung in the cuffs, her wrists cut and bloodied from straining against the metal, her skin glistened with sheen of sweat. Chilcott twisted out another cigarette butt under his shoe. She was tougher than he realised.
�Switch to circuit two� he said and lit another. Suzzanne lifted her head and fixed him with her red rimmed eyes. He gestured with a finger nonchalantly. This time her body just arched as the current switched to her breasts like a thousand fiery needles piercing her nipples. She gurgled and saliva dribbled down her chin.&nbsp; Five more shocks followed.
�Talk Midsummer, this is only going to get worse� and he looked down at his watch, 6pm he had several hours yet and he gestured again.
Suzzanne jerked again and again, Chilcott watched, fascinated by the way the woman&#8217;s body moved, the way her muscles tensed as she strained involuntarily at her bonds, sweat trickling down her flanks. Suzzanne was suffering, her limbs burned, she could feel her heart pounding in her chest and her breathing was ragged, where was Control? she knew now he wasn&#8217;t coming and she knew that Chilcott had engineered it. The gag was pulled from her mouth.
�Time to reconsider Midsummer, I will break you and you know that, give it up now, you&#8217;ve done your best� 
His patronising tone fired something within her and she lifted her head to look at him, her eyes filled with loathing.
�Fuck you, you bastard, I&#8217;ll tell you nothing except this, you&#8217;re a traitor, you&#8217;re the Organisation mole in M.I.7, Brubaker told me before she died you bastard, you know I&#8217;ve been set up all along and somehow you found out I was meeting Control, you&#8217;ll�.�
Chilcott lunged forward and forced the gag back into her mouth.
�That&#8217;s enough of your lies Midsummer� he looked shocked, pale, he turned to the two men.
�Take a break boys, get a coffee, I&#8217;ll carry on from here �
The men shuffled but said nothing before clumping up the stairs and she heard the door close. 

She could feel the fear rising within her as Chilcott turned to face her, he was smiling, a sadistic knowing smile.
�So you do know much more than you&#8217;ve been telling me, your right it is me but I&#8217;m afraid you&#8217;ve never going to be allowed to tell anyone.&nbsp; You see I&#8217;m right at the top now, just Control above me and once he is discredited it will be me running M.I.7�
�MOOOOO, MEWWA� she protested her words distorted by the gag 
�Sorry but yes and there&#8217;s nothing you can now do to stop me� and he made some adjustments to the control box, then he looked at her, she was watching him intently he eyes wide, she shook her head.
�This is going to hurt like hell Midsummer so brace yourself� and he pressed the button.
Pain flashed between her legs and into her sex, her abdominal muscles spasmed and sharp spikes of pain plunged deep into her pelvis, her head jerked back in silent agony before she slumped gasping for breath.
Grasping her tangled brunette mane he lifted her head from her chest and spoke quietly to her.
�You&#8217;ve played out your hand Midsummer, I don&#8217;t need to know anything else, so the rest of this is just for entertainment� and dropping her head he thumbed the button again sending her into paroxysms of agony, this time her agonising cries filled the room before subsiding into wheezing moans.
�I bet you thought nothing could be this painful did you, and now that sweet little cunt of yours is frying and I bet I can cook your tits too�
He made further adjustments before firing the device, this time he energised the wires around her breasts as well as those threaded thought her most sensitive areas, the effect was explosive. She jerked like a puppet, spittle flew from around the gag as she violently shook her head, her shriek that of a tortured animal. Upstairs the two men paused in their conversation at the sounds from below, recommencing their talk as the cries died.
He watched giving her a moment to recover, the sadist in him savouring her exquisite torment, she really was all woman, her breasts, her hips, everything, maybe it was the bondage, the control, he didn&#8217;t know, he didn&#8217;t care but for a moment her felt something stir in his trousers and he thought under different circumstances how he would love to fuck her!
He pressed the button again watching her almost demented response to the current surging into her. Between shocks she barely moved now, just her caged bust rising and falling, sweat glistening on every surface of her body.&nbsp; He wondered how long it would take her to die as he sent another jolt of current into her. He was oblivious to anything else, he was mesmerised by the agent&#8217;s death throes until his focus was broken!

�JESUS CHRIST GEOFFREY WHAT THE HELL IS GOING ON HERE?�

He spun round; Control was at the bottom of the stairs holding a revolver, behind him two men of his security detail followed.&nbsp; 
For a moment Chilcott&#8217;s face was a mask of surprise then quickly he composed himself.
�It&#8217;s Midsummer Control, we intercepted her coming back in to the country, appears she has been turned, we need to know who by and what she has told them�
Control looked from Chilcott to the broken woman hanging from the cuffs.
�Get her down and back to HQ� he said to his men and turning back to Chilcott, �until you can explain this you&#8217;re under close arrest, you&#8217;ll go back with Security�.
He spoke again to his security Chief, �Dismiss the two upstairs, they&#8217;re just acting under orders�
As Chilcott was ushered upstairs at gun point, Control moved over to where Suzzanne was laid on the floor, the guards were cutting the wires from her limbs and one had covered her with a coat.
She opened her eyes as Control leant in.
�Control, I&#8217;m sorry, he was waiting for me, I have evidence you need to hear�.

CHAPTER 12

Twenty four hours later Control sat at his desk, Suzzanne sat before him, pale, tired, her wrists bandaged, she was flanked by Security on either shoulder. Chilcott sat to one side, his eyes fixed on the file before him. Two more security officers screened the door.
We can&#8217;t believe her Control� he began, she&#8217;s been turned, she killed Agent Taylor, she raided the Munich office and assaulted the staff and a Police Officer and she can&#8217;t explain away her release by Wietzman�.

�It&#8217;s all lies Control, we were set up from the beginning, Shannon and I were supposed to steal corrupt information, but we what we actually stole was genuine.&nbsp; Once they realised that Shannon was killed and I was set up for it. They need to discredit the genuine information�.

�That information is worthless Midsummer� spat Chilcott, �it always was, Taylor realised your treachery and you killed her�.

�Fuck you Chilcott, you&#8217;re the traitor, I&#8217;ve got proof�.

He laughed, �What proof can you possibly have, Control this is all nonsense�.

�Really Geoffrey, is it?� his tone was cold, �I&#8217;m not so sure�.

 Chilcott squirmed in his seat, �What do you mean Control? I shouldn&#8217;t be the one under scrutiny here�.

�Well Geoffrey, there&#8217;s a few questions I need answering like how did you know Suzzanne would go to the safe house?�

Chilcott&#8217;s cheeks reddened, �We had been tracking her via her phone GPS, she contacted you and we traced her, I gave you the message, you remember? We picked her up entering the country and tailed her to the safe house�.

�Yes I remember Geoffrey, the message you gave me telling me she would be at the safe house, but that wasn&#8217;t the original message was it?�

�I don&#8217;t know what you mean Control?�&nbsp; His voice wavering, clearly rattled

�Yes you do, you know exactly what I mean and explain this� and Control produced a tape player from his desk drawer.

Suzzanne had been sitting silently watching Control play Chilcott and now she knew he had him. Control pressed play and the speakers hissed.

�Who is your contact in M.I.7?�
Sobs and ragged breathing filled the pause.
�Tell me, who is it, who have you got inside M.I.7?� Suzzanne&#8217;s voice clear and cold
�Please no they&#8217;ll kill me if I tell�, this time punctuated by sobs
Suzzanne&#8217;s voice again �I&#8217;ll fry your pussy if you don&#8217;t, so front up� 
The voice was crying, pleading �NO NO please not again, it hurts, it hurts so much!�
�Tell me� the voice this time soft and between sobs the woman poured out names and information
After a minute or two there was a pause and the soft voice said �Who is your contact in M.I.7, who is it just give me the name�
Panic returned to the other voice, �No no, I can&#8217;t, you don&#8217;t understand, you don&#8217;t know what they&#8217;ll do, what they are capable of�
�Tell me Brubaker or ZAP!� 
 �Chilcott, Geoffrey Chilcott�
His chair clattering to the floor behind him Chilcott was up on his feet a small evil looking black pistol in his hand, the guards moved for theirs but he had been too quick.
�Ok everybody just stay put�

 The tape continued playing , a high pitched laugh, �Yes he&#8217;s right next to your precious Control, right now and nobody has a clue, you won&#8217;t live long enough to tell anybody Midsummer you&#8217;re a�

And then screaming and sounds of struggling.

�Turn that thing off, we&#8217;ve heard enough� barked Chilcott his face white, sweat beading his upper lip.

Thick silence filled the room as Control tapped the button �Put the gun down Geoffrey, there&#8217;s nowhere to run�
�No Control I&#8217;m leaving here alone, tell them to let me go�
�I can&#8217;t do that Geoffrey, you know I can&#8217;t�

Chilcott was backing away from the table, sweeping the pistol back and forth, keeping the guards at bay.

�No Control, I&#8217;ll not let it happen� his voice panicky, high pitched, then without warning he turned and ran hurling himself through one of the open windows.

�Geoffrey NO!!� yelled Control but he was gone, they all followed to the window, below came screams and the sound of cars screeching to a halt, leaning out of the window Suzzanne saw&nbsp; his body misshapen and twisted twelve floors below, on the pavement a dark stain spreading from under it, people where looking, stopping. Dark suited men appeared from the building and a blanket was quickly thrown over the body.

Suzzanne was aware of an arm around her shoulder, it was Control, he guided her back to a chair.
�I&#8217;m sorry Suzzanne that he was able to do what he did to you�.
She looked up at him, �But how did you find me?�

�When you rang back to confirm your arrival, he intercepted the message and altered the time from 3 to 23, it was then just a matter of catching you as you arrived at the safe house. Fortunately I tried to contact him later that day and was told he had left after contacting Turners.&nbsp; He&#8217;d said nothing about his plans obviously but I couldn&#8217;t work out why he needed their assistance.&nbsp; It was just a hunch really I went down to the duty office to check the log and I asked to see the message pad duplicates, I saw he had altered your arrival time to give himself enough time to work on you, just lucky we got to you in time really, I am truly sorry�.

She shivered at the thought, Chilcott had broken her and she knew he would have killed her if Control had not arrived. She smiled, �Thank you�, and she kissed his cheek making him blush.
 Regaining his composure Control slid behind his desk, �Now I expect you need a bit of time to recover, take a few weeks to rest up,&nbsp; then I have something special in mind for you and I need you to be tip top fit!

�Can you tell me anymore� she said excitedly.

�Just to say you&#8217;re good Suzzanne but I have plans to make you even better�
