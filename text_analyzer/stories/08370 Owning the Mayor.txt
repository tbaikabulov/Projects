Owning the Mayor

Synopsis:  The Mayor has everything: money, respect, power.  Miranda is just one of the many people he's had to crush to protect that power.  But has he gone one person too far?






Miranda sat alone in a bustling coffee shop.&nbsp; In front of her on the table was a thin stack of photographs.&nbsp; She picked them up and began flicking through them.&nbsp; They pleased her greatly and she grinned widely.&nbsp; One man appeared in all of them, he looked conservative and well-groomed, his suits always smart and respectable, but the positions he was in were far from respectable.&nbsp; Meeting with some very unscrupulous looking men,&nbsp; exchanging briefcases and brown envelopes.&nbsp; She knew she had him this time, she had enough here to expose his shady deals to the whole city.&nbsp; She almost didn't want to make the call, she wanted to savour the moment, to relive it a thousand times.&nbsp; The very instant she finally took control.&nbsp; But time was ticking away, she picked up her cell and dialed the number.

"Hello?"&nbsp; A male voice answered.

"Good afternoon Mr. Mayor."&nbsp; She greeted him.

"Miranda?&nbsp; Is that you?"

"Indeed.&nbsp; I have some news.&nbsp; I've made a marvelous discovery."

"I don't care what you've got to say.&nbsp; It's over.&nbsp; I'm sorry about what happened, but you should have kept your mouth shut!"

"Oh, is that so?&nbsp; Well I won't continue to bother you but I feel obliged to inform you of one little thing."&nbsp; She wanted him to believe he was in control for as long as possible.&nbsp; So he could dig himself a very deep hole.

"Why are we still playing this silly game?&nbsp; No one believes you and no one ever will.&nbsp; I don't want to tarnish your reputation more than I already have but if you persist with this my patience will run out Miranda!"&nbsp; He bellowed down the phone at her.&nbsp; 

She laughed.

"Interesting that you mention tarnished reputations, after what I could do to yours.&nbsp; I have a photograph here in front of me, it was taken just two days ago at a highly exclusive private members club.&nbsp; It shows you meeting a certain Mr. Yamagata."

"You're lying."&nbsp; He stated.&nbsp; His blood ran cold.

"That's an awfully large brief case he's giving you.&nbsp; I hope it's not what I think it is."

She paused for his reaction.&nbsp; He remained silent.

"Didn't I read in the newspaper this morning that he's just won a lucrative planning contract to build a new skyscraper in the city center?&nbsp; Well I'm sure there's no connection."

"What do you want?"&nbsp; He said through gritted teeth.

"Well, just to leave you in peace, to hang on to my battered reputation as a corrupt liar.&nbsp; I'll just send these to the Police like any responsible citizen and get on with rebuilding my life.&nbsp; Goodbye."&nbsp; She toyed with him.

"No, wait!&nbsp; Give me a chance.&nbsp; I...I can get you your old job back, you don't have do this Miranda."
She had him right where she wanted him.&nbsp; She loved to hear him squirm.

"I feel I've outgrown my former position as your PA, but let's discuss the situation face to face.&nbsp; I've booked a suite at the Empire Hotel, meet me there tonight at 9p.m.&nbsp; Come alone and don't tell anyone where you're going.&nbsp; I'm not playing games anymore."

"How do I know I can trust you to keep those photos private?"&nbsp; His voice quivered.

"You don't."&nbsp; She hung up.




He arrived at the hotel with his heart fluttering nervously.&nbsp; However, his outward appearance was as smart as ever, his sleek black hair gelled to one side.&nbsp; He wore a black suit with a salmon pink shirt, diamond cufflinks, expensive shoes.&nbsp; He walked through the lobby as inconspicuously as possible, keeping his eyes to the floor, hoping to go unnoticed.&nbsp; He hadn't said a word to the receptionist when she recognized him and told him there was a room booked for him.&nbsp; She handed him the key to one of the executive suites and he exited the crowded lobby at a brisk pace.
&nbsp; He entered the room and, not knowing what to do with himself, sat down on a sofa, fidgeting nervously.&nbsp; As he awaited his fate, he surveyed the room.&nbsp; It was huge, the biggest and most luxurious the hotel had to offer.&nbsp; There was a full four-poster bed, a full size bar, a massive flat screen TV that was god knows how many inches wide, there were multiple sofas in different seating areas around the room.&nbsp; There would be space to hold a party for 50 people and have room to spare.&nbsp; Without doubt the center piece was an enormous window that made up the entirety of one of the four walls, ceiling to floor.&nbsp; It offered a panoramic view of his city.&nbsp; He took a moment to look down on it.&nbsp; Everyone knew his name, everyone knew his face.&nbsp; He wasn't ready to lose all that, he wasn't ready to lose his power.
&nbsp; He waited and waited and waited.&nbsp; This was all part of Miranda's plan, she didn't arrive until half past nine.&nbsp; By the time she entered the hotel room he'd had plenty of time to stew.&nbsp; She was wearing a long, white raincoat that covered her body from the knee up.&nbsp; Her make up was simple but striking, dark red lipstick and black eye shadow made her look cruel and sinister.&nbsp; Her brown hair was tied up in a tight bun.&nbsp; She was carrying a handbag over her left shoulder.

She stood in front of him and he looked up at her from his seated position.

"First of all, I want to to make something crystal clear.&nbsp; I do not have the original photos with me, just copies.&nbsp; The originals are with a close friend of mine, and I have given her instructions for them to be posted to the authorities unless I meet her at noon tomorrow.&nbsp; So don't get any crazy ideas, ok?"&nbsp; She took the copies out of her handbag and dropped them, they scattered all over the floor.

"Of course not.&nbsp; Listen Miranda, we're here to talk about this."&nbsp; His eyes darted from photo to photo, evaluating the evidence.&nbsp; He would go down for fraud and corruption for a long time.

"No we're not.&nbsp; We're here for you to get naked.&nbsp; Now."&nbsp; She ordered.

"Wh...what?"&nbsp; He stammered.

"Don't make me repeat myself.&nbsp; Do it now.&nbsp; It's not like I haven't seen it all before."&nbsp; She smirked.

"I'm sorry but that night was a one-off."&nbsp; He blushed.

"Do you defy me?"&nbsp; Her eyes narrowed, testing him.

"No, of course not.&nbsp; But please be reasonable."

"I am being reasonable.&nbsp; Here is the deal.&nbsp; If you do everything I ask of you tonight, then you will wake up tomorrow in your own bed, rather than a prison cell.&nbsp; And only I will know about your dirty little secret, rather than the whole city.&nbsp; Now, take off your clothes or the deal's off."

He decided the deal was acceptable.&nbsp; One night of whatever she had planned and he got to keep his career.&nbsp; Reluctantly, he undressed.&nbsp; She admired his fine, athletic body as he folded his expensive clothes neatly on the sofa behind him.&nbsp; His shoulders were broad, his stomach was smooth and flat with the hint of a six-pack.&nbsp; His chest was hairless but there was a thin strip off hair starting at his belly button and leading south to his crotch where it merged with his thick, untrimmed bush.&nbsp; His penis was a modest five inches, it hung there limply.

"Good boy."&nbsp; She told him patronizingly.

She took a pair of steel handcuffs from her handbag and tossed them at him.

"Secure your arms behind your back."

He caught them and reluctantly followed her instructions.&nbsp; With his arms now cuffed behind him he couldn't protect his privates, he felt vulnerable.&nbsp; She pulled a black leather belt from the bag and kneeled in front of him.

"Don't move."&nbsp; She commanded.

She wrapped the belt around his legs, just above his knees and buckled it tightly.&nbsp; Next she took a smaller belt out of the bag and strapped it around his ankles, again buckling it tightly.&nbsp; With his legs bound like this he could still bend his knees but he was completely unable to walk.&nbsp; He swayed slightly, struggling to keep his balance with his arms locked behind him.&nbsp; She knew that she could easily overpower him if he resisted in anyway.&nbsp; She no longer needed his cooperation.&nbsp; She was in total control.
&nbsp; She stepped back from the bound Mayor and placed the handbag on a table.&nbsp; The next items she took out of her handbag set the tone for the evening.&nbsp; Firstly, a large black rubber ball gag, secondly a harness consisting of several straps and buckles, and finally to complete the set a large, realistic dildo.&nbsp; The realization of what was about to happen set in for the Mayor and he shuffled in his bonds, just enough to lose balance and topple face first onto the soft carpet with a thud.&nbsp; She approached him with the gag in her hand.

"Fuck off!&nbsp; Get the fuck away from me you sick bitch!"&nbsp; He ranted, slithering along the floor on his belly in a pathetic attempt to evade her.

She leaned down over him, slammed the ball gag in his mouth and held it there with one hand, while the other hand fiddled with the straps behind his head.&nbsp; He bucked like a bronco, trying to get her off him.&nbsp; But his effort was in vain and she successfully secured the gag.

"HMMMPF!!!"&nbsp; He tried to shout at her.

"That's enough of your potty mouth."

She pulled him up to his knees and crouched down behind him putting him in a choke hold.&nbsp; With the large ball in his mouth and her forearm pressing down on his throat, his breathing quickly became short and labored.

"You can't stop what's going to happen tonight."&nbsp; She hissed in his ear.

"You're going to leave this hotel a very different man.&nbsp; A man who knows his place.&nbsp; Who knows that if he's going to fuck people over again and again then eventually someone's going to fuck him back.&nbsp; Tonight, I am that someone."

She released her hold and he slumped back to the floor with a whimper.&nbsp; She walked around so she was facing him.&nbsp; He looked up at her wearily as she removed her coat and let it drop to the floor.&nbsp; 

Underneath she was wearing a sexy black lace bra with pink trim, it barely held in her ample cleavage, her 32DD tits threatening to spill out.&nbsp; A matching garter belt and suspenders held up her silk stockings.&nbsp; But there were no panties visible and her pussy was bare, beautifully decorated with a thin strip of hair above it.&nbsp; She attached the dildo to the harness and stepped into it, pulling it up around her hips and drawing the straps tight.&nbsp; The dildo stood proudly like a real cock, bobbing with her every movement.&nbsp; She dipped back into her handbag and pulled out a tube of lubricant, squeezing a generous dollop onto her hand.&nbsp; She smiled at her captive audience as she stroked her cock.&nbsp; It was an intimidating dildo, realistic veins sprawled along the shaft and the end was adorned by a fat head ready to penetrate any orifice desired.&nbsp; It was one and a half inches thick and eight inches long.&nbsp; As she lubed it up it almost seemed to throb with desire, her desire to emasculate and humiliate this pathetic man in front of her.&nbsp; He grunted with effort as he desperately tried to break free from the belts and the handcuffs.&nbsp; All to no avail.

She dragged him over to the large glass window looking out onto the city, then returned to the sofa and removed three large cushions.&nbsp; She stacked them up in front of the window and pushed him over them.&nbsp; His knees remained on the floor but this upper body lay horizontally across the cushions making his ass an inviting target.&nbsp; She kneeled behind him, two strong hands on his hips held him firm in his position.&nbsp; She took time to enjoy the sight, gently massaging one of his buttocks and then slapping it hard.&nbsp; With his legs tied together his buttocks were also pressed together, his asshole was not immediately in sight but protected by the two firm cheeks.&nbsp; The stage was set and it was time for the show to begin.&nbsp; She squeezed some more lube from the bottle onto two fingers and plunged them into his crevice searching for the hidden treasure beneath.&nbsp; She found his orifice and stroked it gently, lubing it up but careful not to penetrate anymore than the outer ring.&nbsp; He recoiled at her intimate touch but with her other hand pushing his back down he couldn't get up and the handcuffs still immobilized his arms.

"It's pointless to resist.&nbsp; Either I rape you here and now or you go to jail and get raped there.&nbsp; Because that's what will happen, you'll be someone's gay bitch, getting fucked all day long by a real man's cock."&nbsp; She took glee in the fact that she had captured him so effectively.

&nbsp; Now that he was ready for her cock she grabbed an ass cheek with each hand and pushed them to either side, separating them to reveal his lubed hole.&nbsp; His face flushed red with embarrassment as it was revealed.&nbsp; He tensed and contracted his sphincter nervously, effectively winking at her, it was about the only muscle he had any control over.&nbsp; But it couldn't defend itself, the rest of his muscles were rendered useless by his bonds, with these defenses stripped away it could only accept whatever punishment Miranda imposed.&nbsp; She moved the dildo forward slowly, pressing gently against his ass, but as the pressure increased he was gradually skewered by the dildo.&nbsp; His sphincter unwillingly expanded to accommodate the thick head. When it was fully inside he could contract to the slightly narrower width of the shaft.&nbsp; A very small mercy.&nbsp; She was done being gentle and she rammed her hips forward suddenly, slamming the dildo all the way into him up to its balls.&nbsp; He howled in pain, muffled by the gag.&nbsp; He tried to twist and turn, anything to rid himself of the agony.&nbsp; Her hands left his buttocks and settled back on his hips, steadying him.&nbsp; She began to move back and forth, fucking him with a smooth rhythm.&nbsp; She loved the sensation of her hips bucking back and forth against him, it wasn't a feeling many women got to appreciate, the joy of fucking someone.&nbsp; The loud muffled howling eased and was replaced with a constant whimper.&nbsp; She could tell he was broken.&nbsp; With her cock still firmly penetrating his ass she leaned forward and unbuckled the ball gag, tossing it to the floor.

"Tell me you love my cock."&nbsp; She ordered.

"No!"&nbsp; He screamed.&nbsp; Clinging on to the last of his self-respect.

"Don't forget what is at stake.&nbsp; If you don't do as I say I will release the pictures and you will have suffered all this for nothing.&nbsp; Now, say it!"

"I love it."&nbsp; He whispered

"What do you love?"&nbsp; She smiled wickedly and thrust deeply to emphasize her point.

"I love your cock."

"Of course you do.&nbsp; You're just a slut now.&nbsp; And sluts like nothing more than taking a big, hard cock don' they?"

"Yes."&nbsp; His voice quivered as he held back tears.&nbsp; Tears of pain and tears of humiliation.

"You mean yes ma'am."&nbsp; She corrected.

"Yes ma'am."

"See that city out there?"&nbsp; She pulled his head up so he looked out the window.

He saw the sprawling skyscrapers and the network of busy highways, bright lights were visible all the way to the horizon from hotels and office blocks, shopping malls and bars, casinos and nightclubs.&nbsp; It was a metropolis teeming with life, people moving around like ants, unaware of what was happening miles above them.

"Whose city is it?"&nbsp; She asked.

"It......it's my city."&nbsp; He stammered.

"No. It used to be.&nbsp; But not anymore.&nbsp; Whose city is it now?"&nbsp; She quickened her pace and thrust even deeper.

"It's your city ma'am."&nbsp; 

"That's right you fucking bitch.&nbsp; It's all mine now.&nbsp; I own this city because I own you.&nbsp; And I'm going to keep you in my pocket, something to get out and play with whenever I want.&nbsp; You said you'd get me my old job back, but I don't need it anymore.&nbsp; Because I'm the new Mayor and you're my new slutty PA aren't you?"

"Yes ma'am."&nbsp; He squealed.

There was nothing left of the confident, cocky Mayor that first entered the hotel.&nbsp; He was no longer the Mayor, barely even a man.&nbsp; He was a mere object for her enjoyment.&nbsp; She reached around and grabbed his flaccid penis, massaging it into a full erection.&nbsp; It was puny in comparison to the monster between her legs.&nbsp; She stroked him in time with her own thrusts.&nbsp; Soon she could feel he was getting close to orgasm.

"Please don't."&nbsp; He begged.

But it was too late, his emasculation was complete and he came all over the cushions in thick spurts.&nbsp;&nbsp; His face burned red with shame, he felt dirty, he felt used.&nbsp; She stopped thrusting.&nbsp; Her cock was still buried halfway into him.

"I'm going to leave now, I feel like I've made my point.&nbsp; I'll give you the key for the cuffs.&nbsp; I suggest you clean up this mess and make yourself presentable before you go home.&nbsp; You don't want everyone else knowing what a filthy little whore you are too.&nbsp; These meetings are going to become regular I'm afraid.&nbsp; I'll call you to arrange the next one."

She laughed cruelly as she withdrew her cock fully.&nbsp; She stepped out of the strapon and left it for him to clean up.&nbsp; True to her word she put the handcuff key in his hand.

"Don't drop it Mr. Mayor.&nbsp; It might take a lot of wriggling to get it back."

She smirked as she put the raincoat back on and left the room.
