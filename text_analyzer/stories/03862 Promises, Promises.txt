Synopsis: A drunk at a bar learns his lesson the hard way.  A college girl gets to teach him the lesson, one spoonful at a time.I woke up with a hangover the size of Texas .&nbsp;The good part was that I was still a little drunk, the bad part was, and I had
  no idea where I was.&nbsp;Not that it mattered, I wouldn't be going anywhere
  with this ice-pick in my head.&nbsp;God I hate being hung-over, but I can't
  help it once I start drinking, especially when the bar is full of pretty undergrads.&nbsp;Oh
  sure, they're all under age, but who can say no to hotties that flash a fake
  ID and an unbelievable (and completely unattainable) body.&nbsp;After my eyes
  adjust, I realize I am back in my apartment, just on the couch.&nbsp;At least
  I made it that far.&nbsp;Last week I awoke in the hallway, the super had to
  kick me to wake me up.&nbsp;Or maybe he just wanted to kick me, no matter;
  right now all I can do to keep this hangover at bay is have another drink... 
    
&quot;Hey, thanks for the drink,&quot; I turn half surprised to see a blonde,
gorgeous girl standing next to me in the bar, alone, with a slight grin, holding
onto a pint of something dark. 
  
&quot;wha, ay, yea, you are welcome,&quot; I stutter back, not knowing what the
hell she is talking about.&nbsp;I have been at the bar for the past 6 hours nursing
my hangover off its deathbed, and I am slightly buzzed, but I am not so drunk
as to forget buying this lovely princess a beer.&nbsp;she obviously has mistaken
me for someone else,&nbsp;but am I going to complain? 
  
&quot;I am surprised you remember me, you were pretty drunk, and the things you
were saying last night, normally I would chalk it up to the alcohol, but you
seemed so sincere and, well, you showed up tonight, so maybe I was wrong about
you...&quot; she trailed off, baiting me perhaps to see if I remembered what
in the hell I had said, or was it just her way of apologizing for her misjudgment?&nbsp;I
couldn't think about either option.&nbsp;she was just drop dead gorgeous and
she was talking to me.&nbsp;she was obviously taller than me, she was tan and
firm, and her blonde hair, it just cascaded down her shoulders and back.&nbsp;she
was wearing cowboy boots and jeans, but it was her white t-shirt that got all
the attention.&nbsp;no frills, she didn't need any, her body was a work of art.&nbsp;while
I sat there stammering and trying to figure out what to say next, she pulled
her hair back into a stern pony tail and set her beer down next to mine. 
  
&quot;how could I not remember you?&quot; I bluffed, &quot;and while I might
have been drunk, you know they say you get the truth out of people after a few
drinks!&quot;&nbsp;I laughed trying to get some sort of control on the situation.&nbsp;nothing
doing. 
  
&quot;Well then, shouldn't you make good on your word?&quot;&nbsp;her eyes simply
sparkled, at what I was sure to find out sooner or later, but apparently I was
on the hook for something. 
  
&quot;Jake, get us three shots of tequila, on his tab!&quot;&nbsp;she shouted
down to my sometimes psychiatrist, sometimes pal, but always bartender.&nbsp;
  
&quot;three?&quot; I looked around, hoping it would be her twin or maybe another
equally gorgeous girl joining us. 
  
&quot;Yea, one for me, two for you, or are you going to backout on your promises
already?&quot; her tone wasn't challenging as much as it was disappointed.&nbsp;
  
  I wasn't going to blow this, no matter what, so I had to recover quickly and
  hope that whatever I had said last night would be revealed later on in the
  evening.&nbsp;&quot;oh, I just figured you would have ordered six, to save
  time,&quot; smiling, I still have it, after all these beers, er uh, I mean
  years. 
    
&quot;Oh no, I like variety.&nbsp;Besides too much tequila and I will be speaking
Spanish,&quot; such a cute joker, and her eyes, they didn't betray a thing.&nbsp;but
I was certain she was plotting, I could just feel it.&nbsp;probably the way a
mouse feels when staring into the eyes of a snake, not knowing what the move
will be next, but certain that once in its jaws, it wont matter.&nbsp;have to
stay out of her jaws, have to stay- 
  
&quot;Here, two for you, one for me, salud!&quot;&nbsp;wow, that second one really
kicked me in the ass.&nbsp;the first was fun, doing it with her and knowing I
was with this gorgeous girl at the bar, in outrageous cowboy boots and a tight
as all hell t-shirt, doing shots... but the second.&nbsp;I felt her eyes again.&nbsp;I
felt her burning into me with her eyes, almost savoring the moment, like a first
step towards something.&nbsp;like an inauguration.&nbsp;or maybe I was just getting
drunk.&nbsp;nasty fucking quervo, and quickly with a chaser to make it all better. 
  
&quot;not too bad&quot; I lied. 
  
&quot;Fucking awful,&quot; she laughed, &quot;The next one will be much sweeter,
I promise, maybe lemon drops?&nbsp;I just needed to kickstart this evening.&nbsp;Besides,
isn't this all part of the plan?&quot; she winked.&nbsp;I am positive, she just
winked.&nbsp;what plan?&nbsp;what the hell did I say to her?&nbsp;fuck, maybe
this girl is just crazy and makes up shit to drunks at the bar to get free drinks.&nbsp;whoa,
paranoia, keep er together boss, just relax and meet her smile. 
  
&quot;oh Princess, tequila or lemon drops, I would drink anything if you wanted
me to-&quot; before I could even finish she was at it again. 
  
&quot;Hey Jake, three lemon drops!&quot; she sang out, standing on her bar chair,
her chest inches away from my face, her perfume literally permeating my lungs
and brain, her scent, her breath, it was like a huge wave hitting me. &quot;...
and don't be silly, of course I know that&quot; she had already sat down and
was talking to me but I wasn't aware of it.&nbsp;her presence was more intoxicating
than the liquor.&nbsp;what had she just said?&nbsp;was that to me or was she
talking to Jake?&nbsp;I was confused but just smiled and played along. 
  
&quot;to you, Princess, for making me keep my promises!&quot; I anted up, tossing
a few more chips into the pile.&nbsp;what hand was she playing... 
  
  she slammed her shot glass on the wooden bar and handed me my second, nonchalantly
  musing &quot;oh you say that now, but wait until later, you might regret your
  promises in the morning...&quot; she hinted, letting her hand run down my arm,
  and rest on my leg.&nbsp;there were a couple of drops from the last shot that
  never made it into her mouth, landing on her t-shirt, perfectly in-between
  her perfect chest.&nbsp;she caught me staring and arched her back as I downed
  the shot. 
    
&quot;That's a good boy, all you need is a little motivation,&quot; I felt her
words more than heard them.&nbsp;how could I look at her, she was so beautiful
and I was losing the battle.&nbsp;I was losing myself in her presence.&nbsp;sure
the alcohol helped, but it was more than just that.&nbsp;I felt drugged, but
I wasn't, not at least with anything man made.&nbsp;it was her, she was... seducing
me?&nbsp;oh I don't know how much more of this I can take.&nbsp;Things are already
starting to get surreal... 
  
&quot;maybe we should slow down a little, its still early,&quot; slight pleading
in my voice as Jake comes by with three more shots, this time jager-bombs.&nbsp;sound
the alarms, man over board!&nbsp;eegad. 
  
&quot;Early?&nbsp;Its almost 11, and we have so much to do, I would say its late!&nbsp;Shut
up and drink, loser!&quot;&nbsp;It wasn't so much the way she said it, playful
and coy, it was the words that she used.&nbsp;especially that last.&nbsp;it hit
me like an electric shock.&nbsp;and the first bomb, it went down while I was
still comprehending what she had just called me.&nbsp;&quot;loser&quot; as easily
as if she knew all along, knew that she could get me to do whatever she wanted.&nbsp;just
another plaything for her.&nbsp;she read my mind.&nbsp;&quot;Come on, time for
your second.&nbsp;This will help, trust me, you will feel so much better doing
what I say,&quot; I looked into her eyes when she said that.&nbsp;she was serious.&nbsp;she
had stopped smiling.&nbsp;the music in the bar was on mute.&nbsp;the crowd noise
had hushed, all I could hear were her words to me. I was tranced.&nbsp;she stood
up out of her chair and got in-between my legs, standing above me, holding the
shot. &quot;That's a good boy, let me help you.&nbsp;Open your mouth, there you
go,&quot; she held the shot glass and brought it to my lips, I could smell with
redbull and jagermeister, her body had closed in upon me, and then it was in
my mouth.&nbsp;&quot;mmm good boy, now swallow.&nbsp;that's it, swallow it all
down, just like you promised, mmm wasn't that good...&quot; 
  
  I was reeling.&nbsp;I couldn't think. I was intoxicated with her.&nbsp;I was
  numb, my body was tingling. &quot;Come on, that's it, another one, good boy...
  mmm taste good?&nbsp;oh you are almost ready aren't you, oh yes I think you
  are...&quot; 
    
&quot;Tab Jake, were outta here!&quot;&nbsp;I barely made out what she was saying
to me, something about her place.&nbsp;wow, this was it, whatever it was, I had
won.&nbsp;maybe it was a drinking contest?&nbsp;maybe it was just an excuse for
her to let down her guard and grab some strange?&nbsp;maybe I was just lucky?&nbsp;I
wasn't fighting it, she led me out of the bar and into a waiting cab and I was
in heaven. 
  
  She straddled me in the cab, and just held me close to her chest. I could barely
  move I was so drunk.&nbsp;she held me there and stroked my hair, whispering
  in my ear how much fun she was going to have,&nbsp;how she was so happy I was
  there tonight, how I kept my promises.&nbsp;I didn't fight it, I just enjoyed
  her chest against my face and breathed in her scent.&nbsp;&quot;oh I promise
  you wont regret this, I know you are a little out of it now, but I promise
  you, I will make this a memorable night,&quot;&nbsp;What?&nbsp;how in the hell
  would I ever regret this, she was a dream come true.&nbsp;like a Dallas cowboy
  cheerleader from my fantasies as a kid, come to life and mauling me in a cab. 
    
  the air was cold and her apartment was in the warehouse district.&nbsp;&quot;in
  we go, that's it, be careful the elevator is old&quot;&nbsp;we got in the elevator,
  and I was so drunk it felt like we were going down, but she punched the button
  for 5, damn those jagerbombs. 
    
&quot;lay down over there, I will be right back,&quot;&nbsp;I hit the leather
couch in 2 seconds flat.&nbsp;I didn't want to pass out on her, but if she wanted
me, she was going to have to make it happen.&nbsp;I was so drunk I don't even
remember how many shots we downed.&nbsp;as I laid on the couch, I felt tugging
on my shoes.&nbsp;I couldn't even turn over, I was just a mess.&nbsp;off came
the second shoe, and then I felt my pants being pulled off.&nbsp;that got me
to roll over!&nbsp;there she was, wearing a babydoll with impossibly high heels.&nbsp;was
I dreaming?&nbsp;
  
&quot;Come on, big boy, unbutton your pants so I can get these off and get you
ready, you have got a long night ahead of you!&quot; she was laughing now, full
on laughing, and I wasn't sure if it was at me or with me.&nbsp;she was enjoying
herself, and I was in no way going to protest.&nbsp;two buttons later, and my
pants were on the floor.&nbsp;I tried to take my shirt off, but she just ripped
the buttons and tossed it aside.&nbsp;two quick pulls on my socks and I was left
on her couch with nothing but boxers. 
  
&quot;Much better, but I will save the unveiling for the moment of truth,&quot; more
laughing and giggling, and she was gone in the darkness before I could say anything
witty. 
  
  Oh what a tease, here I am in boxers, and its cold, and now she just disappears
  on me?&nbsp;God I am drunk, I cant even stand up.&nbsp;I cant even move or
  I will fall over.&nbsp;just hold on, amigo, she will be back, don't pass out,
  not yet, she will be back soon... 
    
  I felt her before I saw her or heard her,&nbsp;she was sitting on me.&nbsp;Literally
  sitting on my chest with all her weight like I was a pillow, or part of the
  couch.&nbsp;I opened my eyes and could see her back, her beautifully arched
  back and hips.&nbsp;she was massaging my feet, first one then the other, pulling,
  rubbing, kneading, god she was such a goddess.&nbsp;her white babydoll literally
  glowed on her tan body.&nbsp;her hair, still pulled back in a severe ponytail,
  swayed back and forth as she worked my feet.&nbsp;without saying a word she
  spun on my chest and looked down into my eyes, a high heeled foot on either
  side of my head.&nbsp;
    
&quot;So do you like my place?&quot; she smiled and pinched my nose.&nbsp;I was
still very drunk, I could not even say a word, I was too dumbfounded at where
I was to believe what was happening. 
  
  without missing a beat she followed up &quot;Well I am glad you do, I don't
  invite many boys back here, you are special.&quot;&nbsp;I felt it again, that
  seduction, her eyes, her mouth, the way the words rolled out of her like honey &quot;very
  special, and you are going to keep your promises to me, I will make sure of
  that,&quot; she said as she grabbed both of my arms and held them above my
  head and massaged them.&nbsp;I could feel her working on each one, first the
  right, then the left, slowly taking her time, letting her chest brush across
  my nose, the feeling of her babydoll sliding over my face, knowing she was
  inches away and yet somehow feeling like she was a million miles away...&nbsp;
    
  it was not the first warning signal I had.&nbsp;there were others earlier in
  the night, little hints that she kept dropping, almost ominous, except that
  in a public setting how could I do anything but play along and chalk them up
  to flirtatious advances.&nbsp;but here, things were feeling different.&nbsp;like
  a ship in a sea of fog, the warning from the lighthouse was far away and hazy,
  but now, we were much closer to the rocks, I could feel the light trying to
  penetrate through the fog, but it was hopeless, it was feet thick, clouded
  by alcohol and sexual tension.&nbsp;I was aware something was not right but
  I was unable and unwilling to stop it. 
    
&quot;There we go, how do you feel?&nbsp;she was genuinely concerned, I could
tell from her tone of voice. 
  
&quot;perfect, thank you for the massage, you are so beautiful-&quot; she hit
me so hard I didn't even see it coming and didn't feel it until my head stopped
shaking.&nbsp;there were stars, and I felt my eyes tear up, my face was on fire. 
&quot;I didn't ask you what you thought of me, loser, I asked you how you
  felt. what do you think I am stupid?&nbsp;of course I am beautiful, look at
  me, I could have any guy I wanted.&nbsp;I could have any girl I wanted.&nbsp;I
  don't need your compliments and I don't want them, I just wanted to make sure
  you were not in any pain.&nbsp;I want to make this process as comfortable for
  you as possible.&quot; she said matter of fact, not screaming, not yelling,
  not sneering, not hateful.&nbsp;just although she was talking to a dog, or
  reading from an encyclopedia.&nbsp;just as calm and clear as you please. 
    
  process.&nbsp;what process.&nbsp;I thought we were going to be fucking like
  dogs, that isn't a process in my book.&nbsp;was she a scientist?&nbsp;why did
  she have to say it like that.&nbsp;I was confused, and it obviously showed
  through. 
    
&quot;What's that look for?&nbsp;You didn't think a girl like me would hold you
to your promises?&nbsp;Oh, you really don't know what you bargained for, do you?&nbsp;I
have been thinking about this all day, I was positive you were not going to show
up.&nbsp;But now you are here, and I am going to make you keep your promises,
you are going to... eat your words,&quot; she smiled, running her finger around
my mouth, tracing the outline of my lips.&nbsp;&nbsp;then she disappeared, literally
just vanished, she was sitting on my chest and immediately got up and *poof*
she was gone.&nbsp;what the hell is going on here?&nbsp;I could hear her, walking
away, her heels clicking down on the floor, then even that faded out.&nbsp;my
arms and feet still tingled, god what a great massage she gave me.&nbsp;my whole
body felt electric, the alcohol was still coursing through me when I heard her
heels softly growing louder, then stopped. 
  
  ZAP!&nbsp;oh my god I cant see.&nbsp;I cant see!&nbsp;&quot;what the fuck?
  what?&quot; I screamed out, terrified, like a child, not understanding but
  afraid anyway.&nbsp;it was just the lights.&nbsp;&quot;just&quot;... it was
  row after row of bright halogen lights above me, beaming down, there must have
  been 100 of them, all over the ceiling.&nbsp;the entire room that I was in
  came into view once my eyes adjusted.&nbsp;it was all mirrors and all white.&nbsp;white
  tile floor, silver mirrors for walls, and as it happened it wasn't a leather
  couch I was on, but a white leather table, about 2 feet off the ground.&nbsp;I
  tried to turn away from the lights, but I couldn't.&nbsp;I was being held down,
  the couch, or table or whatever this was alive and holding me down! I screamed
  out again for help and I heard her giggle. 
    
  I looked over, and against the doorway I could see her silhouette.&nbsp;she
  was so beautiful, I could hear her coming towards me but the lights hid her
  form.&nbsp;I looked down and saw my ankles and feet were completely wrapped
  in something white, holding me to the table.&nbsp;without even looking, I knew
  my hands were held the same way, but it was ok, she was coming next to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;I
  would be ok, but then as she approached she began to squeak at me, making mouse
  noises?&nbsp;what the hell is going on in this place?&nbsp;oh no, its a table
  she is wheeling over, the wheels are squeaking on the tile floor.&nbsp;
    
&quot;Oh god I thought you were making mouses noises at me,&quot; I spoke without
even thinking as she wheeled the cart up along side my body and stroked my hair
with an attentive look into my eyes.&nbsp;without saying anything, she took her
thumb and pushed it between my lips and began to run it around the inside of
my mouth.&nbsp;with her other hand she brought it to her lips &quot;sssshhh&quot; was
all she said.&nbsp;her thumb pressed down on my tongue and held it there, then
she applied pressure and opened my mouth, pulling it down as far as I could stretch.&nbsp;her
smile broadened &quot;that's a good boy, a nice wide open mouth for Princess.&nbsp;You
swallowed everything I gave you tonight, just like you promised, I love a boy
who keeps his word.&nbsp;now are you going to be a good little piggy and swallow
everything else for me?&quot;&nbsp;she began to laugh, and I was completely turned
on and had no clue what she was talking about.&nbsp;
  
&quot;Maybe you need to look like a pig to act like a pig,&quot; she mused as
she opened the table droor and took out a pink pig nose on a band, and stretched
it behind my head, &quot;Lift up piggy, that's good...&quot; placing the snout
firmly over my nose. I felt ridiculous, she could not stop laughing.&nbsp;this
was getting stranger by the moment, but her body in that babydoll, and her voice
and her eyes, I was helpless, despite being bound physically, I was mentally
bound to her as well.&nbsp;my mouth was still open as she continues to laugh.&nbsp;she
laughed so hard tears hit my face, and I tried to laugh but all that came out
was a pig like oink and grunt which made her laugh even harder. 
she began to open droors and shuffle things around on the movable table, and
  I took the time to quickly glance around a little more.&nbsp;it was immaculately
  clean.&nbsp;there were other... instruments and medical contraptions all around
  the room.&nbsp;hoses and bags, a wall full of tools, something that looked
  like a dentist's chair, maybe this beautiful princess was studying to be a
  doctor? 
I looked up to see her placing a large tray, almost like a sushi tray, on
  her lap, her beautiful legs bent and her heels resting on the bar stool ring.&nbsp;quickly
  she snapped on a pair of white latex gloves.&nbsp;the stool she was sitting
  on was so tall all I could see when I looked to my left was the tray and about
  5 or 6 bowls on it, but I couldn't tell what, if anything were in them.&nbsp;each
  bowl had its own spoon.&nbsp;I saw her staring intently into one bowl while
  fishing around in it with her spoon.&nbsp;when she brought it out, the spoon
  was large and she sang out &quot;Open wider, piglet, this first one is going
  to go in your mouth and then down your little pig throat.&nbsp;a promise is
  a promise and mister you are going to wish you never met me by tomorrow!&nbsp;that's
  it, keep it open, once the spoon is all the way in, close your mouth and let
  me slide the spoon out between your lips. That's it...in we go� close your
  mouth and let me slide the spoon out� there we go� now� its IN your MOUTH!&quot; and
  she cracked up before I could even tell what the hell I was eating.&nbsp;then
  I felt it, it was cold and slimy.&nbsp;omg... OMG it MOVED!&nbsp;my eyes must
  have bugged out because before I could even gurgle out a scream her one hand
  was covering my mouth while her other pinched my pig nose shut.&nbsp;She held
  my head down firmly with both hands and made sure it was staying in my mouth.
  I was squirming and trying to do anything to pull away from this evil couch,
  but I could barely even move a muscle. she kept laughing while the living spoonful
  was flopping and squirming in my mouth, it was horrible. Once she caught her
  breath, she stopped laughing enough to blurt out &quot;What's wrong, don't
  pigs like goldfish?&quot; at that even I began to laugh, I had swallowed lots
  of goldfish in my time at college and was absolutely relieved it wasn't anything
  my imagination was conjuring up.&nbsp;I kept thinking of eels or worms, god
  damn fear factor has ruined me for sure.&nbsp;I relaxed and let it flop around
  until it hit the back of my throat, then with one big gulp, down it went. And
  in a weird way, it felt good. 
she was beaming when she saw my throat contract, &quot;Good Pig!&quot;&nbsp;she
  was genuinely excited and happy.&nbsp;she clapped her gloved hands together
  and looked down upon me with that beautiful face and those amazing eyes.&nbsp;it
  was all I could do not to ask for another goldfish, I would do anything for
  her, and to see her so happy, it was pure bliss. I was looking up into eyes
  that were as deep as the ocean but lit up like fire. Her babydoll was revealing
  her perfect cleavage and I began to get hard at the unbelievable view of her
  chest and her legs and her face, she was all right there, right next to me,
  and she was a Goddess. She smiled broadly and spoke down to me.&nbsp;
&quot;I promise you, no more living things, piggy, but that doesn't mean you
  wont be begging me for goldfish by the time I am through with you!&quot;&nbsp;her
  breasts heaved as she threatened me, her eyes held mine, I knew she meant every
  single word she said.&nbsp;I began to rethink everything.&nbsp;I was alone
  with her, completely bound, completely drunk, and she was literally taunting
  me with promises I had made the night before in a blaster of a drinkfest.&nbsp;She
  was absolutely thrilled with the prospect of feeding me what ever else she
  had on that tray, and somehow delighted in the fact that it was only going
  to get worse... but fuck she was beautiful.&nbsp;she was so beautiful.&nbsp;I
  could never say no to her, and she knew it... 
She got up from the stool, and stood back to look at me, to study me for a
  second. She began to walk around me while she spoke, �I promise you, little
  pig, that you will regret every promise you made to me last night. You are
  swallow everything in these bowls, every last spoonful, no matter how much
  you fight me or protest.� She pulled thick, white, leather straps from under
  the couch and began to toss them lazily over my body. �and while I really enjoy
  your struggling and squirming, I think its time you realize that fighting me
  will only make it worse for you. I want to burn this into your brain- the more
  you resist, the more I will take the necessary measures to ensure you keep
  your promises to me.� One strap fell across my shins, another across my knees,
  then my thighs, my stomach, and two across my chest. �I worked hard to prepare
  this meal for you, and you gave me your word you would swallow it all down,
  and I am going to make sure you do. All of it. No matter what.� She began to
  cinch each strap down across my body, starting from my legs, pulling it tighter
  and tighter until I thought my body would snap. �There, one last strap across
  your chest, and this will stop that senseless squirming you were doing before.� She
  looked into my eyes as she pulled the strap through its buckle and locked it
  down, encasing me in white bands of leather. A press of a button on her remote
  and my ankles and wrists were also stretched further. I began to cry, I was
  literally unable to move my entire body except for my head. �Oh god, please
  don't let her feed me something I cant take,� I thought to myself. 
She walked behind me and then climbed back onto her tall, chrome and white
  barstool. She crossed her legs and looked me up and down, �Now where were we� oh
  that's right, you were about to be a good boy and finish this next bowl I have
  for you.� She reached over the table and picked up her tray, swirling the spoon
  around one of the bowls, �Mmmmm, oh you are going to absolutely hate this one,
  it might even make you vomit. I wouldn't if I were you however, no matter how
  revolting it is, because what comes up, must go back down,� she giggled at
  her own joke. My arms were on fire, my legs felt like they were being pulled
  out of my body, and the straps across my chest made it difficult to breathe.
  She smiled, �Open wide and keep it open, I am going to put this heaping spoonful
  of filth in your mouth and I might have to scrape it against your teeth to
  make sure its completely empty. Don't you close your mouth until I say so.
  If you fight me just one tiny bit, I will make sure the next bowl I give you
  will be under much more restrained circumstances. Give in to me and do as I
  say and I might even relax your straps.� She moved closer with the spoon. It
  was piled high with what looked like seaweed or some sort of Asian mixture.
  I kept my mouth open as she delicately placed the spoon inside. I felt her
  turn it over and dump the contents onto my tongue. She took her other latex
  covered hand and pinched my pig-nose shut while she scraped the remaining bit
  of mixture off the spoon using my lower teeth. 
�That's a good little pig, now shut your mouth, look me in the eyes and swallow.� She
  removed the spoon and also took her hand off my nose. I breathed in, relieved
  to be allowed this much freedom, and when I did, the taste of whatever it was
  in my mouth made me involuntary convulse. �No, no, no piggy� she waved her
  cute finger at me, her eyes betraying the mirth behind the stern face she was
  trying to show me. What ever it was in my mouth it was totally foul and I looked
  up into her eyes for help. �Swallow it and I will tell you what it is, you
  will never guess otherwise� unless you are a plumber�� I made a squealing noise
  but swallowed anyway, looking up into her perfect face, her chest rising and
  falling with anticipation. �Oh fuck what was that! That tasted like, hell like
  garbage!� I coughed and retched after swallowing it down. She was literally
  awash with glee as she took the spoon and piled it high, �Open your mouth and
  finish this bowl, pig, you filthy fucking pig, swallow this without another
  word!� I stared in horror as she brought the spoon again to my mouth. This
  was not fair, she was going to tell me what it was, and now she was filling
  my mouth again with this� this sewage? This rotten Chinese takeout? What the
  hell kind of sadist was she. But what else could I do? She brought the spoon
  to the edge of my lips and stopped. 
�Want to know what you are dining on now, little pig? I made this just for
  you, and its literally taken me months! This morning, as soon as I woke up
  I took apart my garbage disposal and cleaned it thoroughly. Every little bit
  of grime and filth, every rotten bit of sludge, every tiny piece of foul stench,
  I took out of that disposal I put in this bowl for you to eat! Look at me,
  look into my eyes as I slide this into your open mouth, you weak excuse for
  a man, you total fucking pig! With every spoonful I give you, the less I think
  of you as a man.. You are a Pig, a disgusting barnyard oinker, and you deserve
  every little bit of grime I force down your gullet. There must be at least
  3 more spoonfuls of this muck in my bowl and you are going to swallow every
  single bit of it!� As she said the last words she forcefully shoved the spoon
  in my mouth and pushed it to the back of my throat. �Swallow it, pig! I want
  you to swallow this down right now and thank me for it. Thank me for allowing
  you to eat the rotting food in my garbage disposal, you pathetic excuse for
  a man.� It was worse the second time. Knowing that I was eating rotten food
  made my whole body convulse, but I had to do it, or else it would just get
  worse. She looked into my eyes and saw my resistance fade as I swallowed the
  mouthful of filth. �Thank you Princess for allowing me to eat the filth from
  your garbage disposal.� 
�Oh god your breath smells! What have you been eating, piggy? Maybe instead
  of talking, you should just oink from now on. Come on, Pig, oink for me, oink
  for me so I can fill your mouth with my sewage�� oh that's it, oh my little
  oinking piggy here you go, open up, open up and take another spoonful, 2 more
  to go and then this bowl is empty�� My mind began to break, I was losing myself.
  I couldn't say no to her, she was so beautiful and she was using her sex and
  her mind to bend me and twist me around her finger. I was sliding into madness,
  all I wanted to do was please her, no matter how disgusting it was, I was losing
  the fight, and she knew it. She could see it in my eyes and hear it in every
  little pig squeal, every last oink, and every grunt. I was her pig and she
  was loving the power she had over me. 
After the bowl of sewage came an entire bowl of ground up hot peppers with
  wasabi tossed in for good effect. My mouth and lungs were on fire and my eyes
  burned and nose ran. She was absolutely delighted. The fourth bowl was filled
  with smashed bugs and the hair from her shower drain, a messy crunchy mix that
  had me almost vomiting. I didn't think I could go any further. The fifth bowl,
  she confessed, was the last full bowl she had, the sixth was empty and depended
  on my performance here. If I was a good boy, there would be no sixth bowl. �But
  if you fight me in the slightest, pig, I will fill that last bowl and you will
  be getting your dessert. You don't want any dessert do you? Good, because I
  don't want any resistance. Now� open up pig� open up and make me happy.� 
She brought a sliver spoon to my mouth and carefully slid it in. �close your
  mouth while I withdraw the spoon, and swallow it down.� I closed my mouth,
  and as the contents hit my tongue, I felt sick. �Can you guess what's in you
  mouth pig? Here let me show you the bowl�� She leaned over, her perfect chest
  inches from my face, and then I saw it, the bowl was filled practically to
  the top with what looked like egg drop soup. But something was wrong. �Can
  you see it, pig? It's a bowl full of my SNOT! You are going to swallow an entire
  bowl of my snot and I don't want a bit of protest, or you are really in for
  it-� 
I have no idea what she said after that, I could not control it anymore. The
  swirling warm mess in my mouth was too much, and everything I had eaten that
  day came up in one big gag and landed all over my stomach. That was it, I was
  done, there was no way I was going to swallow a bowl of her snot, no matter
  how beautiful she was. 
�Awww piggy! You were so good this far�, she cackled, not the slightest bit
  upset. �Hmm, the mess on your stomach has to go back down, but I think its
  not going to be easy is it?� I was incredulous, I couldn't believe what she
  was saying to me, didn't she see the condition I was in? I was exhausted and
  beaten, there was no way I could do this anymore. 
�Oh piggy, don't give me that look. You promised me last night that you would
  swallow what ever I gave you and I don't take promises lightly. Not from disgusting
  drunks like you, not from losers that I can exploit and devour. Oh no, you
  must be held to your word so that you never lie to me again. If I am going
  to own you, you will always tell me the truth, and to do that, I have to break
  that part of you that lies. Do you see now, why I am doing all this? I knew
  that last bowl would make you vomit. Hell, I had planned on it! So now, I will
  make it easy on you, just relax, its all going back down and, yes my pig, the
  bowl of snot is going down your throat too, no matter what your little pig
  brain might think.� She was looking down on me while saying all this and I
  was completely aghast. She began to take off her latex gloves and take out
  a large funnel and tube, some white harness, a silver tube of god only knows
  what and other items and placed them on top of the table. 
�Now, listen to me good. Its all going down, but I will make it easy on you.
  You wont have a decision. You will just have it all forced down your throat.
  But to make it easy on you, I have to fasten a few things in place, and while
  I can do it if you struggle, it will be much easier and quicker for me if you
  allow me to do it. Don't resist, just be a good pig and let me make it easy
  for you to keep your word. Let me make it easy for you to swallow all this
  mess. I promise you that once I have all my equipment in place, the decision
  to swallow will be out of your hands and you can just accept your fate. Ok
  pig?� Her voice was soothing and sincere. She was genuinely trying to make
  it easy for me. While I made her sick, she also cared for me, as a pig, as
  a toy, as something she owns, like a piece of property. 
I sobbed a little bit and nodded my head. She smiled and put on a new pair
  of gloves. With efficiency and swiftness she gathered the entire mess on my
  stomach and added it to the bowl of snot. She then wiped me clean and held
  my chin in her hands as she looked down on me. 
�Wonderful, pig, you have been just wonderful! Ok, now to do this right, I
  need to adjust you�� She used her remote to raise the top part of the couch-bed
  and had me sitting almost upright like a craftmatic adjustable bed. Next she
  straddled me, her thighs straddling my waist, her knees sliding along side
  my body and her impossibly perfect chest inches from my face. �Open� was all
  she said. I complied and she lowered her hands in front of my face and shoved
  a large black tube, about 5 inches long and very thick into my mouth. It was
  surprisingly soft, I could close my mouth around it. But it was long and extended
  to the back of my throat and out of my mouth an inch or two. She took the attached
  straps and tied them securely behind my head. She hopped off me, patting my
  head and wheeled over an IV stand. Attaching the funnel to the top of the stand
  and connecting me to the funnel with a long, clear, thick tube finished her
  prep work. 
Without so much as a word, she dumped the entire bowl of snot and filth into
  the funnel, picked up what looked like a plunger of sorts, and began to methodically
  push the foul mix down the tube, I could see it all coming. It was going to
  be a mouthful of slime in my mouth in a matter of seconds. I bit down on the
  tube, but it didn't matter, the sludge seeped around the tube and began to
  fall into the back of my mouth. 
�Now Pig, you keep your mouth open! I am going to the trouble of making this
  easier on you so you better be good and keep that mouth open. If you don't,
  I will do it for you,� she stared into my eyes, all the while plunging the
  mess down the tube. I opened my mouth and it all slid in, in one giant, disgusting,
  push, she rammed it all into my mouth. It was all I could do not to vomit,
  but I held it in my mouth. I don't know what she was thinking, but there was
  no way I was going to swallow this, no way. She quickly unfastened the clear
  tube from the black tubing in my mouth and wheeled the IV stand and funnel
  away. 
She came up behind me and whispered in my ear �Oh little pig, are you ready
  to feel what its like to be forced to swallow the most foul mixture anyone
  could ever dream of? Oh I think you are. I know I am, and can I tell you a
  secret? I am going to absolutely love every bit of it. I will love your helpless
  expression as it slides down your throat. I will love the look in your eyes
  as you stare into mine for mercy. Oh this is my FAVORITE part, piggy, because
  I am going to thoroughly break you with this.� 
I heard the humming of the couch as it lowered back down, and then I was on
  my back, staring up at her. She looked gorgeous, but my mouth was full of filth
  and I was fighting the urge to throw up again. She was holding a clear plastic
  tube, which she began to slide through the black tube in my mouth. �This will
  make sure you don't get any second thoughts and close your mouth while I use
  my plunger to force every bit of nastiness down your throat, you disgusting,
  weak kneed, filthy fucking pig!� And with that, she proceeded to keep her word.
  The plunger fit neatly in the plastic tube, and she was right, I couldn't shut
  my mouth anymore. Tears were streaming down my face and my stomach heaved as
  she encased my head between her knees and used both hands to work the plunger
  in and out of my mouth, laughing with glee as foul greenish-brown foam escaped
  around the tubing from my mouth. �Oh Pig, you have no idea how much fun this
  is, forcing all this down your throat, oh I absolutely love this, and you cant
  do a thing about it, its going down your throat against your will! You don't
  even have a choice!� the plunger went out �You are nothing but a plugged up
  drain that I am plunging free. Give into me, you pig, don't fight it, just
  let the plunger do its work. Open your eyes, accept it, open your eyes and
  look up at me!� As I did, she slowly forced the plunger back down through the
  tubing, forcing another glob of sludge down the back of my mouth and then she
  kept pushing, further until she had pushed it past my gag reflex and down my
  throat. She was forcing me to swallow every last bit. I was losing my mind,
  I could not escape her, my head was not moving anywhere and my body had given
  up fighting long ago. She kept at it, plunge after plunge, slowly forcing all
  of it down my throat. 
�Oh little Pig, can I let you in on a secret? I must have had 3 or four orgasms
  forcing you to swallow all this� this� this sickening mix of waste.� She looked
  down on me, absolutely glowing. I didn't care about anything anymore. All I
  wanted to do was make her happy and see her beautiful face. She undid all the
  straps holding my mouth open and allowed me to rest. 
�Well, I am going to go shower and change, if you don't mind. But don't you
  worry, piggy, I will be back in just a little bit to give you your thoroughly
  deserved dessert�� she smiled and laughed at my expression. �What's the matter?
  Did you forget? Well that's ok, I didn't, I hope you are still hungry, because
  you are going to eat it all, but I am hoping I won't have to force you this
  time�� she walked out without another word and shut off the lights, her high
  heels clicking down the long hallway. 
Lights. Bright lights. And there she was. Her hair still wet from the shower.
  She was wearing nothing but a towel draped around her body. Her body was still
  slick from the shower, and her skin looked even more tan when she was wet like
  this. Her hair was straight and long, free of the severe ponytail she had been
  in all night. She was dripping with beauty and glistening with power. I could
  not keep my eyes off of her. 
�Oh my little trussed up piggy, I have your dessert ready. I will give you
  the choice, do you want me to force it down or will you willingly accept it?� I
  couldn't stop staring at her. I just nodded. I was not myself anymore. She
  smiled. She knew exactly where I was and what I meant. �Oh wonderful, I was
  hoping you would eat your dessert without any struggle or fight. I loved breaking
  you, piggy. It was so sweet seeing the last bit of resistance leave you while
  I was plunging your mouth free of that filth, plunging you deeper and deeper
  into submission. And now, you will do it willingly for me.� 
She walked closer and stroked my hair. She looked into my eyes and smiled. �Now
  piggy, are you excited for your dessert? It will be so much better than all
  of that mess before. Do you like sundaes? How about hot fudge and nuts, with
  some whip cream? Oh yes, piggy, it will all be for you, but remember, you deserve
  this, every bit, and I want you to swallow it and not fight me.� She got up
  on the couch, facing me, wearing only the towel, and looked down on my face.
  Her eyes were sparkling. I could feel her wet hair dripping on my stomach and
  on my legs. She traced her perfect finger around my lips and smiled. She pried
  my mouth open, effortlessly. Without another word, she shifter her weight and
  spun around on my stomach. I was looking for the bowl of ice cream and hot
  fudge, but it wasn't on the table next to me. 
She sighed and removed the towel, tossing it to the ground beside me. She
  scooted closer to my face, sliding on the couch with her knees, her hair laying
  against her arched back. Her ass was perfect. It was absolutely perfect, completely
  tan, and without a blemish. I was in a trance as she kept sliding backwards.
  Her calves and thighs slid along side my head as she arched her back further,
  positioning her ass over my wide open mouth. I looked to the right and in the
  mirror I could see her face, she was looking at me. She slid back a little
  further, pushing on the couch and looking in my eyes. I couldn't stop looking
  at her. Her perfect body, her perfect chest and stomach. She shook her hair
  and the drops of water splattered all over my face. I was still looking in
  her eyes. She was looking at me in the mirror. She was looking at my open,
  she was concentrating, she was using the mirror to perfectly align herself
  over my mouth. She stopped moving and lowered her ass inches above my open
  mouth. Oh god, this was my dessert. This is what I deserved. I looked up and
  saw her asshole precisely above my mouth. I looked to the right and caught
  her eyes in the mirror. She blew me a kiss and then bit her lower lip. 
I smelled it coming before I felt it land in my open mouth. I waited until
  she stopped and my mouth was completely full. I began to chew, it was warm
  and bitter, and omg, it was crunchy. There were nuts in her shit. I swallowed
  the first mouthful and looked at her in the mirror. Without missing a beat
  she filled my mouth again and then effortlessly sprang off the couch, picked
  up a bottle of whip cream on the floor and sprayed it into my open mouth until
  it was overflowing, piling high above my mouth and then down my face. I began
  to chew more and could still taster her shit, despite the whip cream. There
  were even more nuts in this mouthful and with each crunch, she giggled and
  held her hand over her mouth. I swallowed again and without another word she
  climbed back over me, this time squatting directly over my open mouth, her
  ass making a seal with my lips. I knew I would be here a while and it was the
  only place I wanted to be. 
She began to hum �I scream, you scream, we all scream for ice-cream,� as I
  felt my mouth bulge out with another helping of her shit.
