Chapter 1 - The plot
(no sex in this chapter just plot setup for the story)



The tall man acting as the chairman was trying helplessly to get some order
around the table.  Finally, he slammed his fist down on the hardwood table,
which caused the group of people to suddenly quiet down.

"Please," he said, "let's behave like human beings."

Having recovered some control over the group he looked at the puzzled faces
of the other people in the room. There were about a dozen people in the room,
including himself with a few more men than women currently present, but then
some of others were unable to make it to the meeting on such short notice. 
How many members were in their groups now?  Even he didn't know the exact
head count, because some of the members were busy recruiting new members to
expand their new scam.

He completed his circular sight to his right, motioning to another tall man to
raise and address the others.

"How is everything coming, Doc?" he asked the tall man.

The second man raised from his seat and said, "As planned, dear
friends...exactly as planned.  According to the tests I performed last night,
the drug is ready for us to put to use".

There was a little giggle from a young woman sitting on the opposite side of
the table.  She was probably more aware of this little experiment than
anybody else present. Without paying much attention to this interruption, Doc
continued, "You all know about my past experiments and studies with
pheromones�"

Another interruption disrupted the assembly, emanating from a big guy in the
back, wearing a Chicago Cubs baseball cap, "Please, Doc� would you spare us of
this lecture and get on with the facts? We're not at the university here!"

Doc frowned, shooting knives from his eyes to the disrupter.

Meanwhile, an older woman sitting just across the girl who giggled previously,
leaned over and  whispered, "Is he real doctor? "

"He's not a MD, silly", the other answered also whispering, "he has a Ph.D. in
chemistry and he used to work for a famous beauty products manufacturing."

"All right, everyone!" called the chairman, "let's hear the good things!"

The doctor turned to him, stunned, but remained silent for a minute, before
heading where everyone was hoping he would, "The results are quite clear, my
friends! The drug is harmless and completely undetectable, but very effective!
One shot is enough to render any woman very compliant and into a frenzy� a
sexual frenzy, naturally!

"Naturally!" echoed the chairman.

"The best thing about the drug is she will have absolutely no recollection of
what happened to her while she was under the influence of the drug when it
wears off!" Finished, the tall man the group called Doc.

"But how can we get a woman to take that shot in the first place?" asked a guy
from the back, sitting near the man with the baseball cap.

"Doctor, please tell us!" asked the chairman, motioning again to the other
fellow.

The chemist produced a small, plain white cardboard box, opened it and
extracted a small spray bottle, bearing the name "Possession" written in
script and in a deep, gold color lettering.

"This is how, my friends", he said. "By all women's weak point...perfume! The
drug is simply added to the perfume and even in it�s diluted state it still
retains all the effects that we need."

The bottle was slowly passed around the table to everybody and it was not too
surprising that the women were the ones who showed most interest.  Each of
them took extra care looking at the bottle, caressing the brand name with
their fingers.

"Possession", said the last woman, before handling back the perfume bottle to
the chemist.  "What a great name and it seems so appropriate too!" She
finished with a small giggle.

Now, all the people were silent, understanding that what they were hoping for
was finally reachable.  Only now the only question that remained was who would
be their first victim.

"Have you found somebody, my precious one? " asked the chairman, looking
towards the girl who had giggled a few moments ago.

The girl didn't say a word...she pushed an envelope towards him.  He grabbed
it, ripped open the seal and unfolded the single sheet of paper from inside.
He read briefly, then put the piece of paper on the table, smiling broadly
and announced, "Well, my friends... it looks like we have found our victim. 
Her name is Cathy Harris!  She's a devoted housewife and mother in her late
30's, and by the information which I have in front of me it looks like she is
a perfect candidate for our little game.

*****

A few days later, Cathy Harris's daughter Traci ran down the stairs heading
for the front door to answer the ringing door bell, "I'll get it, Mom!"

The young teenager opened the door, but there was nobody there by the time she
opened it, despite the fact the bell had been rung twice.  Stunned, she looked
from right to left, then back left to right.  Maybe it was some young kid
playing a joke on them she thought.  She was about to close the door when she
spotted and package protruding from the mailbox, so she picked it up and
brought it inside.

Mrs. Harris was just arriving at the front from the kitchen as her daughter
was closing the door, "Who was it, dear?" she asked.

"I don't know, Mom!  There wasn't anybody there when I opened the door, but I
found this package with your name on it in the mailbox."

"Strange ", said Cathy. "It's early for the mailman...he usually doesn't come
around for a couple more hours!  Besides, there is no stamp!"

"I'm leaving for school now, Mom!"  Traci told her mom, leaving her alone with
the mysterious package.

After Traci had left, Cathy returned to the kitchen with the strange package,
where she opened it up and found a card along with a small, plain white box
inside the package.  Opening the card, she read the following...

"Dear Mrs. Cathy Harris;

I am proud to introduce a new line of cosmetics and perfume called
`Possession' for the more sophisticated woman.	I have included a free sample
for you to try at your leisure.  All that we ask is that you call us with
your opinion.

Sincerely,
Mrs. Hunter
Director of Special Promotions."

Then, at the bottom of the card was a toll-free number for her to call.

Cathy decided she wasn't going to waste her time and she was about to throw
everything in the kitchen garbage can, but at the last minute she decided to
at least try the free sample.  She opened the small white box and took out
the bottle, and then she sprayed a little on her wrist and sniffed her wrist.
Suddenly, it was a revelation.	She had never felt so good about herself and
strange sensations were spreading through her body.  She felt so good she
felt compelled to call the company and she practically ran to the phone and
dialed the number on the bottom of the card.

*****


Meanwhile, all the way across town a young redhead in her early 20's answered
the phone that she had been waiting for to ring.

"Hello...Possession hot line!  My name is Holly...how may I help you?" the
young woman said as she answered the telephone.

Hi, My name is Cathy Harris and I'm calling in regards to a free sample that I
just received in the mail." Cathy began to explain.

"Have you tried the sample that we sent you yet, Mrs. Harris"? The young woman
asked, cutting her off.

"Yes, I have...", Cathy started to answer, until she was once again cut off by
the young woman.

"Then, may I ask you some questions, Ma'am?  The young woman asked,
interrupting her.

"Sure, if you would like to..." Cathy responded, feeling very compliant by
now.

Then, the young woman started asking Cathy a series of pre-determined
questions which got more and more personal so that the woman could tell if
the dug was working on their victim or not.  Once she was satisfied that the
drug was working, she told Cathy that she was to go and get all cleaned up,
because she was going to have some male visitors in about an hour or so and
that she was to do everything that she was asked when they arrived.

After she got off the phone with Cathy, the young redhead made several calls
to some of the other members of her group and about an hour later eight men
showed up at Cathy's house, where they slipped in unnoticed.

Chapter 2 - The Phone Call

The next week, on Monday morning, after her husband had left for work and her
daughter Traci for school, Cathy Harris was flipping through the TV channels
while tying to relax with a cup of coffee, but she was getting frustrated from
the news coverage of the latest President misbehaviors on CNN instead, when the
telephone rang.

She left the couch and picked up the kitchen phone which was the closest for
her and she answered, "Hello?"

"Mrs. Cathy Harris?" responded an unfamiliar male voice.

Just as she was going to answer, the front doorbell rang.

"Excuse me", Cathy interrupted the caller. "I must go answer the door, please
hang on and I will be right back!"

Cathy put down the phone receiver and made her way across the living room to
the hall. She opened the front door, but surprisingly nobody was there. She
checked around and she found a package protruding from her mailbox, maybe it
was a book delivered to the wrong address as it had often been the case since
they changed mailman a few months ago. Mrs. Harris grabbed the package and she
saw that her name was in fact on the adhesive label, so she brought it inside
and took it back to the kitchen with her, where she deposited in on the counter
as she picked up the phone.

"Sorry about the delay", she said. "Who is this?"

"Oh�" the unknown male caller began, "you don't know me, but I have something
very important to tell you".

Cathy didn't like the way the conversation was heading, so she cut him off,
"Listen, Mister!  If you don't tell me who you are and what you want, I'm going
to hang up right now! "

"That wouldn't be a very wise thing to do, Mrs. Harris!"

"How come?  If you don't stop this silly joke you're playing on me immediately,
I'll have the police, Mister�?

"You can all me Mr. Anonymous, Mrs Harris!" said the man, almost laughing at
her. "And, if I was you...I wouldn't call the police either or you will wish
you never had called them! "

"W�wh�what do you mean?"

"Well, let me just say this�if you do anything to try to find who we are, you
could end up in a very messy situation."

Cathy Harris thought that all of this was completely ridiculous. She must have
been taken for somebody else or maybe it was just a joke being played on her.

"Look!  I don't care what you say, Mister! " snapped Cathy. "I've never done
anything wrong and you can't have anything against me, so I'm just going to
hang up and call the police. The telephone company should be able to track down
where you're hiding, goodbye!"

Before she could cut the conversation, the man advised her, "Before you do
anything foolish, why don't you first take a look in the package! "

Suddenly, Cathy's gesture was cut in mid air and she brought the receiver back
to her ear. "Which package?" She asked, suddenly very puzzled how this caller
knew she had just received a package.

But, nobody was on the other end of the line anymore and she just heard the
dial tone. Hanging up the telephone, Cathy turned around and saw the strange
package sitting on the counter where she had put it and suddenly it seemed to
be staring back at her almost as if it were an explosive.

Curiously, she went and picked up the package and turned it around, but she
could not find any return address.  Not knowing what else to do, she carefully
opened the package and then she became even more puzzled when she found that
the package only contained an unmarked VHS Video Cassette.

Not being able to come up with a better idea, she took the tape to the living
room where she put the tape in the VCR.  The screen turned solid blue, which
she had seen on the beginning of a few home videos and then suddenly the blue
screen disappeared and it was replaced by scene of her having sex with a group
of strange men wearing ski masks right in her own living room.

Cathy was so shocked and horrified by the scene on her TV that she felt very
cold, almost numb and her only response was to quickly cover her mouth with her
hands as she gasped and cried out in shock.

*****

The tape didn't last long, only about 10 minutes or so, but Cathy continued to
stare blankly in tears and on her knees at the blue screen when it reappeared. 
A minute or so later, she practically ripped the tape out of the VCR and
frantically began to try and destroy the tape, and within a matter of minutes
she had all the tape out of the cassette and tore up.

Suddenly, the telephone rang again and Cathy nearly jumped out of her skin. She
was afraid to answer it and she kept hoping it would stop ringing, which it did
stop after it rang about 10 times or so and then there was an eerie silence.
Unfortunately, it didn't last long as the telephone began to ring again a few
minutes later.

"What do you want?" Cathy cried as she answered the kitchen phone.

First, she heard a loud laugh, then the more familiar male voice said, "I guess
that means you have seen the tape, Mrs. Harris!"

"What do you want?" Cathy repeated, wondering where that would lead.

"First, shut the fuck up!" snapped the unknown male caller.

Cathy decided to remain silent, but she also sensed that she might break into
tears once more real soon.  Not hearing anything, the man continued, "Now, Mrs.
Harris�I'm sure you understand the implications if you don't cooperate. I want
your complete attention now, Mrs. Harris! Are you listening?"

"Yes", answered Cathy, almost in tears.

"Very well, Mrs. Harris, or...should I call you Cathy?"

"Whatever you want�" she responded.

"Excellent, Cathy�that's a very good answer!  Now, I want you to go to your PC
and check your E-mail, where you will find your instructions for today".

"My instructions?" Cathy asked with a nervous tremble in her voice

"Yes�and, I suggest that you read them very carefully...that is, if you don't
want a full version copy of the video tape to end up in your husband's hands or
the hands of any of your friends."

Suddenly, the phone went dead as the unknown man hung up on her before she
could protest.  Feeling almost sick to her stomach with nervousness, she went
to the den and turned on the family computer.  A few minutes later she logged
onto her AOL account screen name, where she was greeted by the voice message
that she seldom heard, "You have mail!"

Clicking on the mailbox icon, she found one untitled email message waiting for
her and she nervously double clicked on the message to read it and this is what
she read.

"Mrs. Cathy Harris,

We're glad that you have made the wise choice and decided to comply, but I
think it's very important to go over what will happen if you do not follow our
instructions completely as specified.

First, if you ever fail to follow the instructions we give you we will send a
full version copy of the video tape of which you have already seen a small
sample to your husband, all of your friends and your neighbors.  Oh hell,
depending on our mood�we may even post segments of the tape on the Internet
too.  If we do, we are sure you would agree your life would be completely
ruined.

Now, we are sure you are probably wondering what will we ask of you, right?
Well, don't worry�we don't want any money from you, because frankly we already
have plenty of the green stuff and you just don't have much. Instead of money,
we will ask you to do some things and you will be expected to do them exactly
as you are asked, or else�and, I don't think there's any need for me to go into
that again.

You're probably wondering what kind of kind of things are we going to ask you
to do, right?  We don't want to ruin the surprise for you, but we will say that
according to what we know about you, you will have a very difficult time
obeying our request from time to time.

Since, there's really no better way to explain what will be asked of you than
to give you an example, then we may as well get started and have some fun right
now!  So, you are to leave your house immediately and go to the corner of Main
Street and Canal, where you will call the number listed below from the public
telephone and you are to do exactly as you are told by the person who answers
the phone. 

1-800-462-7588 

We are not sure what time it is right now, because we sent this email prior to
calling you, but you have until 10:30 to call us as requested.  If we do not
hear from you by this time we will assume that you have decided not to obey and
we will start distributing the video cassette tapes."

Cathy looked at the clock and to her horror saw that she had less than a half
an hour to get to the specified location and make the telephone call.  Very
briefly she considered just calling from her home telephone, but then she
figured that she had better not risk it since her blackmailers had obviously
gone to a lot of trouble to plan things out and they might know she was not
calling from the telephone booth, so she quickly wrote down the telephone
number

She started to close the email message, but then she was touched by an idea
that maybe she could find something out about her blackmailers by hitting the
reply button on the email.  Unfortunately, it just led to a dead end when the
return email address came up as going to anonymous.

Having no other choice, Cathy quickly shut off the computer and rushed out of
the house and jumped into her mini van and drove to the down town area where
she lived.  It hadn't occurred to her yet, but the intersection was one that
she went to every week, because it was where her bank was located.

*****

Fortunately, traffic was pretty light and there weren't many pedestrians out
due to the light spring rain they were having that day, so she made pretty good
time getting to her destination.  Unfortunately, she had a little difficult
finding a parking spot and had to park about a block away and she had to
practically run to the telephone booth when she discovered that she had only a
few minutes remaining until 10:30. 

Cathy was out of breath by the time she finally reached the telephone booth and
she quickly deposited a coin in the telephone and dialed the number she had
written down.

She had too many other things on her mind to notice it, but the number she had
been given actually spelled out, "1-800-IM-A-SLUT". The phone rang twice, then
a female voice answered, " Yes, who is this?"

"This is Cathy Harris ", she responded out of breath.

"Oh! Yes, Mrs. Harris...I'm glad that you made it on time, we were just getting
ready to send the tapes!"

The female voice giggled a little, then she add, "I'm glad to see you have
decided to follow our instructions?"

Cathy had no idea how the unknown woman on the other end knew whether she was
calling from the phone booth or not, but she nervously waited for the woman to
say something else.

"Now, first...I want you to unbutton your blouse completely!"

"You want me to do what?" cried Cathy in a state of shock as she was caught off
guard by the woman's sudden demand.

"You heard me, bitch! " answered the girl, suddenly a lot more stern. "You will
do exactly as I say or we're sending the tapes!"

"No, please...don't do that!" Cathy begged and slowly began unbuttoning her
blouse. "I'm doing it, please don't send the tapes!"

Trying to remain covered by the small telephone box, Cathy Harris did what she
was ordered to do. She took glances on the sides to make sure that nobody was
nearby and that nobody was looking at her.

"OK�I'm done", Cathy offered to the woman on the other end of the phone.

"Very good, Mrs. Harris!  But now, I want you to turn around and face towards
the street!"

"Oh God, Please� please!" begged Cathy in tears.

"Oh, OK Mrs. Harris�if that how you want it, then we will just go ahead and
send the tapes out now!  I'm sure your husband will find them rather amusing,
so good luck and good bye!" the young woman on the other end quickly responded.

 
"NO�WAIT�I'LL DO IT!"  Cathy quickly cried out loud to catch the young woman
before she hung up the phone, and then she nervously turned around and faced
towards the street with her blouse open all the way and her lace bra showing to
whoever happened to look in her direction.


Cathy closed her eyes and waiting for what seemed like an eternity for the
young woman to say something.

"Great! Mrs. Harris," she finally heard the young woman say on the phone. "You
may go back home now and we will contact you again real soon!"

Suddenly, the line went dead and Cathy quickly re-buttoned her blouse and
rushed back to her mini van, where she broke down sobbing.  About 10 minutes
later she regained her composure enough to drive back home, where she spent the
rest of the day contemplating her situation while she waited for her husband
and daughter to return home from work and school

Chapter 3 � A Trip To The City

teri_q@hotmail.com


The next morning, Cathy fawned over her husband and daughter as if her
attentions would keep them from leaving her.  She was afraid to be alone,
because her tormentors somehow seemed to know what her schedule was and when
her family was there and when they were not.  Unfortunately, her husband
eventually had to leave for work and her daughter had to leave for school.

She sat alone on the couch, staring into space and trying to think of how she
might get out of her predicament. Suddenly, the phone rang and she almost
jumped out of her skin.  Reluctantly, she got up and went to the kitchen.

"Hello?" She said, finally getting up enough nerve to pick it up on the tenth
ring.

"Good morning, Cathy." said the female voice "are you ready for more fun?"

Cathy wanted to scream at the woman, but she bit her tongue and remained
silent instead.

"I gather your silence means that you are, so go check your email right now
and follow the instructions we sent you."  Then, suddenly the line went dead.

Tears of frustration and anger trickled down her cheek as she entered the
family den and turned on the computer.  The glow of the computer screen
emphasized the furrowed lines of her worried brow as the familiar "You've got
mail."  crackled from the speakers.

She opened the message and began to read the following...

"Before you read any farther...open the attachment and look at it, then come
back and read the rest of this message."

Nervously, she clicked on the attachment and watched as a picture began to
fill the screen of her computer. Through her tear blurred eyes she
immediately recognized that it was a photograph of herself, and it was taken
the other day when she stood on the corner with her blouse unbuttoned and
flapping in the breeze while she was on the phone with one of her
blackmailers.

Until now, she wasn't sure whether they were watching or not and she was
thinking that maybe she could just fool them into believing she was really
playing along with their sick demands, but now she knew she would have to
follow their instructions until she could find a way out of this mess.

Angrily, she closed the picture and returned to reading the rest of the
message...

"Nice picture, Cathy...you look so slutty showing your bra of in public and
we really enjoyed the show.  As a matter of a fact, we enjoyed the show so
much we figured it was a real shame to keep it all to ourselves, so we
decided to share and you're going to do a repeat performance.  Well, not
exactly a repeat performance�after all, we wouldn't want you to get bored
doing the same thing over and again, so today you are going to go downtown
Chicago on a little shopping spree.

One of the main things you are to buy is a blank book that you will use to
keep a diary, and from now on you will start keeping a record of everything
we have you do...what you did...what you wore...who saw you, and more
importantly how it made you feel.  But, first you need to get dressed for
your little shopping trip.

Today, you will wear your pink spandex aerobic outfit with the white leggings
that's in the bottom of your dresser drawer.  Yes, Cathy...we know a lot about
you.  If you remember your little party with the 8 men, you were having such a
good time that afternoon that you didn't notice when a few of them took the
opportunity to do some snooping around your house.

Now, we know how much you like running around dressed like a slut, but we
have to think of any young kids you might come across, so we want you to also
like you to wear the short, wrap around white skirt that's in the dresser
with your aerobic outfit.  As far as shoes go, your white high heels with the
3 inch heels will do nicely.  But, that's it...no bra�no panties, and not
even a coat.

Once you are dressed, you are to drive to Chicago and park at the Natural
History Museum, where you will look for a public telephone and call us at the
same toll-free number we gave you last time."

Cathy slumped in her chair and cried.  Her mind was a twisted mess of
incoherent  thoughts. The one thought that was clear and which kept coming
back was who and why?

Like a zombie she turned off the computer and went to her room and stripped.
She opened her dresser and dug out the aerobic outfit with the matching skirt
and dressed as she had been directed. Only when she was finished did she dare
look into the full length mirror and she was appalled at the slut that
returned her gaze. Her eyes dropped to her breasts.  Not only were their size
and shape clearly visible, but it was obvious she wasn't wearing a bra and
her nipples could be made out through the thin material.  When she was
outside and that cool air hit her the look would be positively obscene.  The
tiny skirt barely covered her butt.  She looked like a common streetwalker
peddling her wares. She sat on the bed and cried again.

Finally, she composing herself, she cleaned up her face and made her way to
the car.  She didn't think during the drive.  She just drove. Numb. Before
she knew it, she was at the museum. She parked and got out.  She looked
around and found a pay phone near the entrance.  As she passed an elderly
couple, the man stared at her breasts until his wife gave him a jerk on the
arm and she gave Cathy a glare as they passed.	She couldn't make out what
the woman said to her husband, but she was sure it had something to do with
her and the way that she was dressed.

Cathy picked up the phone and dialed the number.

"Hi Cathy.  You made pretty good time.	Now turn around and face the parking
lot as we talk.  Remember those twin assets of yours are public property now.
Now, you are to walk up 12th to S.Plymouth and then turn right and walk to
Dearborn.  On the corner, you will find a pay phone.  The walk from the
Museum takes about 25 minutes or so, but you have only 20 minuets�so, you'd
better hurry!"	Then, the line went dead and she immediately at her watch and
saw that it was 10:14.

She started walking, looking around at the buildings. Were they watching? 
Were they taking more pictures?  So many questions. What was their goal for
her? Her thoughts were distracted by a teenage boy whistling at her as she
walked past him, and then she began to realize her current plight.

The air was chilly. Her nipples had hardened and were poking out the thin
leotard material. She glanced at her watch and saw that it was already	10:19
and she was just crossing under the tracks, so she began walking faster.
Unfortunately, picking up the pace made her breasts bounce more and the
rubbing of the material on her nipples made them harder.  She passed a woman,
who gave her a cold disapproving stare. She moved up 12th past a group of men
standing out side a caf� and she felt all of their eyes locked on her
bouncing chest as she hurried past them with a blush.

Checking her watch again she saw that it was 10:23.  She turned onto
Plymouth, where a group of black youths with a basketball called out to her.
"Whoa!	Nice goods baby.  You wanna stop and have a little fun?"  She ignored
them. "Hey! Slut!  Come on back here.  I got something nice for you."  She
kept walking. 10:27.  Her cheeks were burning from the shame and the cold
air.  She was almost there.  10:33. She rounded the corner. She saw the phone
and almost ran to it.  She picked it up and dialed the number again.

"Cathy, if you wanted to stop and play with those boys we would have allowed
you more time."  the female voice giggled.  "Now go in the store you are next
to and buy your book and then come out to the phone. We will call you back in
10 minutes." Then, the phone went dead.

She went in and bought the book. The clerk was a young man, who was especially
slow in ringing up her purchase.  He seemed much more interested in her chest
than his job. She left the store with cheeks burning red in embarrassment.

The phone was already ringing when she came back out, so she ran to the phone
and picked it up.

"Got the book?" The same woman asked her as soon as she picked up the phone.

"Yes." She responded.

"OK, now turn and look across the street.  Do you see the 'Love Boutique?'
"Yes." She said, looking across the street.

"Good.  They have all sorts of fun things in there.  We want you to go into
that store and spend some time browsing. Look over the lingerie and check out
the toys too if you like, but buy a nice half cup bra and a pair of g-string
panties�the tiniest possible, a garter belt and stockings.  Then, come back to
the phone call us again when you are finished.  Happy shopping." Then, the
phone went dead.

Cathy hung up the phone and made her way across the street and entered the
store.  Thankfully, it was mostly empty.  She looked around the store.  There
was a lone clerk at the counter near her, reading a magazine.  She glanced and
saw that it was a sex magazine.  She forced her eyes to the rest of the store.
There were signs hanging from the ceiling identifying the various departments.
She saw signs that said "Videos", "Toys", "Magazines", "Fetish", and finally
"Clothing".

She walked back through the "Toys" department towards the clothing and her
eyes bugged and her cheeks burned when she saw the large collection of
dildoes as she was walking by.	Some of them were huge!  She passed into the
Fetish section and glanced about at the strange wares.	Half of the things
she couldn't even identify.  She did recognize the handcuffs, gags and
blindfolds and she shivered.

Finally, she reached the clothing section and she started looking through the
items there.  It took her some time to find a half bra her size.  She blushed
at how explicit the pictures on the packages were.  In many of the pictures,
the women's nipples were completely exposed.

She moved to the panties and found a pair quickly, no more than a small patch
of material attached to a thong and a waist string.  She shuddered at the
thought of wearing them.  Then over to the garter belts and stockings, which
she found quickly.

When she approached the clerk, he laid down his magazine, leaving it open to
an obscene picture of a girl performing oral sex on a large black man.	Cathy
turned her eyes away.  The clerk picked up each item in turn, punching the
numbers into the register.  After Cathy had paid he put all the items in the
bag except for the panties.  These he held appearing to picture them on
Cathy. Cathy flushed, grabbed the panties and the bag and stormed out of the
store to the sound of the clerks laughter.  Only when she reached the street
did she realize she still had the panties in her hand.	She quickly stuffed
them into the bag and rushed across the street and dialed the number again.

"Cathy, do you see the bar next to the Love Boutique?" The woman asked,
answering the phone.

"Yes." She responded.

"As a reward for obeying today, you will now go over to that bar and have a
drink.	One drink over an hour or so should still allow you to drive home
safely.  I know that bar and many of the people who frequent it.  They are
very nice people, so I don't want to get any reports back that you were rude
or unfriendly to anyone there, understand?"

"Yes, I understand." She responded, after which the phone went dead.

Even with people still leering at her breasts, Cathy felt a little better as
she crossed the street and approached the bar.	At least she could sit down
for awhile, because her feet were killing her from all the walking she was
doing in her high heels.  Hopefully, the bar would be dark and she could
relax a bit since no one could see clearly. Plus�a drink sounded wonderful
right now.

She entered the bar and looked around.  It was very dark, but it seemed nice.
Cozy and warm. It was clean and the furniture looked comfortable. She sat in a
booth that was partially obscured from the rest of the bar by a column with
hanging plants. Cathy relaxed for the first time since she had gotten out of
the van back at the museum.

Suddenly, a waitress came over and set a drink down in front of her.

"But I haven't ordered yet."  Cathy replied.

The waitress just pointed at a woman sitting at the bar.  Cathy looked at the
woman trying to see if she recognized her, but she couldn't see well enough
through the darkness to tell, so she smiled and lifted the drink in a silent
toast to the woman.

She sat and sipped the drink, enjoying the feeling of warmth that came over
her, and started suddenly as the woman who had bought her the drink slid into
the bench seat next to her.

"Ohhhh.  You startled me.  Thank you for the drink."  Cathy said.

"I always try to buy newcomers to the bar their first drink."  Replied the
woman with a smile.  "My name is June."

"My name is Cathy," she responded, shaking the woman's hand.

They talked, chatting about nothing in particular. Cathy noticed that the
woman touched her a lot, on the hand or arm, but just thought to herself
"What a friendly touchy person."

As they talked more, the touches became strokes on the arms and an occasional
dropping of the hand to her thigh, but between the drink and Cathy's now more
relaxed state and the warning not to be rude to anyone in the bar. Cathy
accepted the touching, although it was beginning to get a little familiar.

Cathy realized her mind had wandered and she had just caught the word
"advertising."	"I'm sorry, my mind wandered, what were you saying?" She
asked.

"Nothing�it looks like you've been out doing a little advertising." The woman
answered.

"I'm sorry, I don't understand."  Cathy said, a little shaken.

Suddenly, the woman slid over closer to her, and with her left hand brushed
lightly across the material covering Cathy's thigh.  Cathy jumped slightly
and the woman slid even closer until their thighs were making contact.

"Please..."  Cathy started.

The woman looked at her and smiled. "Playing hard to get are we?  And, after
you walked in here advertising like that?"

"I'm not advertising anything! I'm just on my way home from a workout!" Cathy
exclaimed, sounding indignant.

"Bullshit!" said June.  "No one walks into a lesbian bar dressed like that
without expecting some action.  And I'm going to be the woman to give you that
action. Now, cut out the innocent act."

Cathy's anger flared.  A lesbian bar! Damn it!  She should have known her
blackmailers were probably up to something when they were being nice to her.
How dare they put her into this type of situation.  She drew herself up and
slid over, almost pushing June out of the booth as she got to her feet, gave
June an icy look and then rushed out the door.  As she entered the daylight
again, her sudden burst of bravado evaporated.

She began to tremble.  Had someone been watching her?  Would she now be
punished for being rude?  Or, would they send out the tapes?  Her knees felt
weak as she began walking back towards her van and she tried to ignore the
looks and comments along the way.

The next two days were a silent hell.  There were no phone calls.  No Email
messages. Though relieved that there was no direct torment, her mind was
working overtime picturing her husband sitting down to watch the mysterious
tape that had arrived.	But he was acting like nothing was wrong. Had they
sent them out? Had he seen them?  Her daughter was acting normal too. Had it
all been a bluff?

Then, on the third day a package arrived. Inside was a digital camera and a
note.  "Against our better judgment, you are being given another chance.  I
have gotten reports that you were rude to a lady in the bar. I don't like
that.  But, one day you may be kneeling and begging her forgiveness.  We'll
see.  In the meantime, study the manual for this camera. Learn how to use
every feature.	You will be spending a lot of time with it.  Instructions
will follow."

Possession

Chapter 4 � Cathy�s First Punishment

It was around noon and Cathy was wearing her favorite thick, fuzzy pink
bathrobe and she was sitting at the desk in the family's den and she was
writing in a book.  She appeared to be very nervous and her eyes looked puffy,
as if she had been crying recently.  And, the following is a portion of what
she's writing�

*****

(An excerpt from Cathy's diary)

"Wednesday, May 6th 1998�

"I really don't know how to start writing this thing, but I don't have any
choice whether to do it or not�at least, not for now I don't have any choice!
See, I'm being blackmailed by some people for something that I didn't
do�only, I can't prove it right now.  As if this wasn't bad enough, they are
also forcing me to keep this handwritten record (a dairy of sorts) of my
experiences, and they're making me keep it in of all places�the top drawer of
my night stand, which really scares the hell out of me because there's a
chance John or Traci might come across this book and read it.  Normally, they
don't go into my night stand, except there have been a few times in the past
that they both ended up checking my night stand when they were looking for
something and could not find it anywhere else in the house."

"Anyway, I have no idea who these people are or why they are doing this to
me�I just hope I can find a way out of this mess real soon, before they ruin
my marriage and my life."

"Now, I have no idea how they did it, but somehow they managed to get a home
video of me, or someone who looks and sounds like me having sex with eight
strange men in what looks like the living room of my house.  I thought about
telling John about what these people are doing to me, but he's a bit on the
jealous side so I don't think I would be able to convince him that it isn't me
in the video."

"Anyway, this morning my ordeal began soon after John and Traci left the
house for work and school.  I had hoped that my blackmailers would have lost
interest and leave me alone after that awful display of myself downtown
Chicago the other day, but I should have known better.	The minute I turned
the PC on and logged onto the Internet, I was once again greeted by the
message "You have mail" from AOL.  I opened the message and I had to read it
twice to convince myself that I wasn't dreaming and that it really said what
I thought it said."

"I was going to print it, but then I figured I had better not print it from
fear that someone might find it in the trash later on, so I knew I had to
rely on my memory and went about following the instructions I had been given.
 At first, I thought I might be able to get away with not following their
instructions and just claiming I did follow them if they ever asked me.  But
then, I figured I had better do it just incase they somehow had some way of
knowing whether I really followed their instructions or not.  After all, so
far they seem to know an awful lot about me and my life and they seem to be
keeping a very close eye on me too."

"First,  I went and made sure that both the front and back doors were locked,
since I knew that I definitely wouldn't want any one of my friends walking in
on me unexpectedly and catching me following my blackmailer's instructions.
Sometimes, my friend Janice from next door comes over for coffee and usually
she will just walk in and start helping herself if the door is unlocked and I
don't answer the door when she knocks.  Normally, I don't have any problems
with her just walking in like that, but I would just die if she was to walk in
and catching me doing what I had to do today."

"Anyway, I went upstairs to my bedroom after making sure the doors were locked
and I dug out the packages I had hidden with my purchases from the other day.
Following the instructions I had received in the email, I removed my bathrobe
and night gown and then I started to dress accordingly.  I really would have
liked to wear those sexy outfits for John sometime, but this wasn't for him.
It wasn't for anybody, anyhow!"

"As instructed, I finished dressing in a white blouse, a black knee-length
skirt with a pair of black high heels.  I fastened a thin leather belt around
my waist and looked at myself in the tall mirror.  Under normal circumstances,
I would have found my attire very attractive, but I didn't like the way I
looked or felt under these circumstances�I felt almost slutty, especially with
the knowledge of what I was going to have to do!"

"It took me a few minutes to calm myself and regain my composure.  Then,
knowing all too well that there was no way of putting off the inevitable and I
should do as ordered�or else, I left the bedroom and went back down to our den
where the computer was setup."

"Suddenly, the den appeared to be darker than it normally was for that time of
day, especially on such a nice sunny day like it was today.  At first, I
thought it was just darker because the blinds and curtains were closed and
normally they are open, but then I realized it probably wouldn't have mattered
if they were wide open or not.  Instead, the room just  appeared to be darker
from my knowing what was about to take place in the room."

"Anyway, I entered the den and stopped in the middle of the room.  Then,
taking a deep breath I slowly began to follow the ritual that I had been
ordered to perform."

"First, I knelt down and then I slowly began to unbutton my blouse.  Once my
blouse was unbuttoned, I opened it widely as I had been instructed to do and
displayed my lacy bra, before removing my blouse completely and then tossing
it on to the floor several feet in front of me.  After which, I unbuckled my
belt from my waist and I placed it on the floor in front of me within my
reach as I had been told to do. Then, I slowly unzipped my skirt and within a
few short minutes it too was laying on the floor near my blouse, which I had
just tossed on the floor a few minutes earlier."  "Next came my stocking and
garter belt, but according to my instructions I wasn't allowed to stand up or
sit down, which really made the task of removing my stockings that much more
difficult.  It took me a lot longer than usual to remove my stockings, but
eventually I did managed to get them off.  The real strange part about that
part of my instructions was that I had to put my shoes back on after I
finished taking off my stockings, so I did!"

"Even though I was alone at the time, I can not begin to put into words how
awkward and embarrassed I felt undressing like that on my knees in the family
den, but I still had a lot more to do before I was finished following my
blackmailer's instructions."

"Continuing, I removed my bra and panties, both of which I tossed on top of
the growing pile of my clothes.  Once they were off, I was completely naked
except for the high heels on my feet."

"I stayed in the same position for a long time, trying to regain enough nerve
and strength to perform the rest of the ritual that I was being forced to
perform.  Finally, I got up enough nerve to continue and I spread my knees
farther apart and then I picked up the thin leather belt and rolled most of it
around my right wrist, leaving about a foot hanging.  'How could I find the
power to do such a thing to myself?' I asked myself.  Kneeling and undressing
in the den was one thing, but this was something else!"

"Twenty lashes with the belt!  That's what my email instructions had said was
my penalty for displeasing my blackmailers the last time.  Each set of ten had
to be applied according to the indicated ritual. First my back, then my
buttocks."

"Seeing no way out and fearing harsher punishments for not doing as I was
told, I slowly raised the belt to begin my own whipping.  Flogging yourself
is no easy task, believe me!  I started to stroke my back diagonally with my
right arm, sometimes reaching my shoulder blade, sometimes my kidneys, I was
aware of the fact that those should not be whipped severely, but what could I
have done?  Eventually, I completed the ten first strokes and then I moved
down to whip my butt.  I stroke the right side five times and then, I
switched hands and used my left hand.  Unfortunately, I'm a lot less handy
with my left hand than with my right hand and many of the last five lashes
landed on my thighs rather than my buttock."

"A very strange sensations spread across my body, it felt so hot.  I couldn't
help it!  My hand found it's way down toward my pussy, not even letting the
belt fall to the floor.  I started to rub myself with the belt, which quickly
became slippery.  I increased my tempo, breathing very hard and soon I had a
very strong orgasm.  I never experienced an orgasm that strong and intense
before and I blacked out!"
 "When I regain consciousness, I recalled what I had just done and began to
shake.  I knew that all of that was wrong, but I somewhat enjoyed it
immensely.  'What kind of perverted slut would climax just by the force of a
whipping?' I asked myself.  Then, I thought of the marks I probably had from
the belt and suddenly, I began to tremble in fear while I thought of what John
would say if he saw the marks on my back and buttocks.  I didn't know how long
they would remain there and I was frightened that John would notice them
tonight.  'Maybe, I should pretend that I caught a cold and get to bed early.'
I thought to myself."

*****

It was around 2:30 PM and Cathy was sitting in the living room, dressed again
in her normal clothing when the phone suddenly rang and she jumped and spilled
some of her coffee.

"Hello?" she said, reluctantly answering the phone in the kitchen on the
eleventh ring.

"Hello, Cathy�" the unknown male caller began.  "Did you have fun this
afternoon?"

"Who is this?" she cried into the phone.

"I'm not going to tell you my name, but I think you know who I am�don't you?"
The man asked.

"Yeah, I think so�" Cathy responded, regaining her composure a little.

"Good!	Then, I hoped you learned your lesson today and I hope we won't have
to punish you again.  You're not going to make us having to punish you again
are you, Cathy?" The caller asked her in a very calm voice.

"No�" she began to respond, but then broke out crying, "Please, leave me
alone!"

"Did you write in your journal today, Cathy?"  The male caller asked,
continuing after giving her a few minutes to calm down again.

"Yes�" She responded with a sniffle.

"Good, then we have one last thing for you to do today before your husband
and daughter return home."  The caller began to explain, "We want you to type
up everything you wrote in your journal today, and we want you to send it to
us as a reply to the email that we sent you today."

Then, before she could say another word the phone line went dead as the caller
hung up on her.


*****

Later that evening, the young redhead woman stored the e-mail she received
from Cathy into a password protected directory in her computer and turned to
the chairman, winking with her bright eyes.

"Didn't I tell you that she was a natural?" she asked him.

The tall man raised from his recliner, walked behind his female companion and
bent over her, using his advantage to caress her shoulders. After a short
moment, he took his chance and lowered his hands to cup her breasts over her
business suit.

"And, so are you, my precious one!" he answered.

"Do you think Mrs Harris was been punished enough for yesterday?"  The girl
giggled, pushing his hands away.

"Not quite, my precious one!  I think, we should push her a bit farther next
time, don't you agree?"  He asked.

"Oh, I sure do!"  She quickly answered.  After which, the two of them quickly
broke out in laughter.
