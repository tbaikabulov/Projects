Synopsis:     A consensual, nonviolent kidnapping of a highschool girl.






I saw her profile while browsing one day.&nbsp; She was 18, and still in high school.&nbsp; She still lived with her parents, but had dreams about slavery and being used like a slave for years.&nbsp; She was finally old enough to do it for real, and was looking to disappear from the world, to be taken in as a slave to serve out the rest of her life; no chance at escape, no choice but to take what she was given.

So I read her profile, and looked at her stats.&nbsp; She said she was a 5'5" and 110 lbs white girl located only a couple hundred miles from me.&nbsp; I messaged her, nothing fancy or committal, just a friendly note of greeting and wishing to talk, and apparently it stuck out because I got a quick response back.&nbsp; Her name was Sue, and she was very polite and appreciated my polite email not demanding her to move in now.

We emailed back and forth for a couple weeks, where I got her to share about her life.&nbsp; She didn't have many friends, and didn't participate in many after school activities.&nbsp; The kids her age found her strange, and never wanted to get too close to her.&nbsp; Every day after school, she'd come home to an empty house.&nbsp; Her parents worked late, and she often went to bed without seeing them to say goodnight.&nbsp; She told me about her interest in slavery, how she longed for the day where she could be helpless before a strong master.&nbsp; Where her body would be used for his pleasure, where she'd be humiliated and abused.&nbsp; A place where the world forgot she existed, so she would be without hope but to accept her place as he deemed it.

Never while we emailed back and forth did I state I was interested in meeting her, nor did I ask if she'd want to enter into such a relationship with me.&nbsp; I let her reveal her story, and let myself gain a bit of her trust and confidence.&nbsp; It was then I asked for her mailing address, so I could send her a small gift.&nbsp; She gave it to me without question, and I told her to expect a package in the next week or two.

Finally, I had a chance I've never had before.&nbsp; I drove down to Wal-Mart and bought two of the pre-paid Go phones, as well as around 1000 minutes, paying with cash.&nbsp; I wanted a way to communicate with her privately that no one would know about in order to trace or track when she disappeared.&nbsp; None of my emails linked her to meeting me, so I should be safe from more then a few questions, if that.

I took great care in reducing any change of tainting the package I was to send to her with anything that would be able to be traced back to me, including hair and prints.&nbsp; I activated the phone wearing gloves, and placed it into a small box.&nbsp; I printed out a small letter from the public library so my personal printer wasn't linked, if the note were discovered.&nbsp; It was short, and read:
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Take this phone and turn it on.&nbsp; Do not use it
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; to place any calls.&nbsp; Keep it on you.&nbsp; When it 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rings, answer it.&nbsp;&nbsp; Do not email me before I
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; call.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I will contact you soon.

With all the contents in the box, I sealed it and went to the post office.&nbsp; I mailed it to the address she gave me, using a false return address and paying again with cash.&nbsp; After I got the tracking number and they put the package in the sorting bins, I walked away with butterflies flying all the way into my chest.&nbsp; I couldn't turn back now, not with things in motion.&nbsp; Anxiety filled me.&nbsp; I worried I slipped and didn't catch the clues that she was one of those FBI Stings.&nbsp; That a hair fell into the box and I missed catching it.&nbsp; That my prints were captured in the glue of the tape.&nbsp; But, things were in motion, and there was nothing to do but wait and let it play out.

Paranoia got the best of me.&nbsp; I didn't even use my home computer to check the tracking status.&nbsp; Wednesday, after a couple days of waiting, I ran to the public library to see where the package was, and the estimated delivery date.&nbsp; The readout from the website said it wouldn't be delivered till the next Monday.&nbsp; More days of waiting and anxiety gnawing at me.&nbsp; The weekend went by slowly, while I paced around contemplating everything that could go wrong, and how bad it might get.

Finally Monday came.&nbsp; Around mid-afternoon, I went to the library again to check the tracking status.&nbsp; Delivered!&nbsp; I sat there hoping she was who she said she was, and that she followed my directions.&nbsp; If she was what she said she wanted to be, she should.&nbsp; All I had to do was to take my Go phone and call her.&nbsp; But I couldn't do it somewhere public like the library.

I drove to the highway and went a few miles to the rest area.&nbsp; I parked there to make the initial phone call, thinking if it were a FBI sting, they wouldn't be able to triangulate the call to my house.&nbsp; Yes, I was paranoid, but when you were hoping and planning for what I was trying to do, it can pay to be paranoid.&nbsp; By now it was about 4:30 in the afternoon, well after she should have gotten home from school, seen the package, followed my instructions and be waiting with the phone for my call.&nbsp; I took two deep breaths, dialed the number for the Go phone I sent to her, and pressed the Call button.

After two rings, the other end picked up.&nbsp; A sweet young voice came through, excited and full of cheerful hope.&nbsp; �Hello, is that you?� she said.&nbsp; I replied and asked her a few questions while I swallowed my stomach back down.&nbsp; So far, everything was going well.&nbsp; She followed my directions, not like she had anyone to call anyways (as she put it).&nbsp; She hadn't told anyone about me either, as no one really talked to her anymore.&nbsp; Things were going well, and it was time to push her comfort zone.

I explained that the phone was to stay between me and her.&nbsp; It was my way of talking to her that no one else knew of, something special that we shared.&nbsp; Because it was something special between us, she wasn't to call anyone or give out the number to anyone.&nbsp; Anytime it rang, I would be calling and wanted to talk to her.&nbsp; I would call her, and she didn't need to call me.&nbsp; She took the explanation well, accepting it and adding her own little pieces to it, making it hers and owning the rules.

Then I had one last test.&nbsp; As I explained since now that we have the phone, we no longer needed emails to communicate.&nbsp; Not only that, I wanted anyone who came along and read the emails to think we were no longer talking, and asked her to humor me.&nbsp; I wanted her to type up one last email to me.&nbsp; I wanted her to pretend that I sent something absolutely nasty, disgusting and insulting to her in the package.&nbsp; I asked her to tell me that the present was unwanted and unaccepted, and that she threw it out.&nbsp; She was also to type that she never wanted to hear from me again.&nbsp; I told her to block me after she sent the email, so anyone that looked would think that I had blown it and she wanted nothing to do with me.&nbsp; She found the idea strange, but somewhat amusing, so she agreed to do it.

With that done, I told her how good of a girl she was being, and how she'd make a very pleasing slave for someone, someday.&nbsp; I complimented her on her voice, how I looked forward to hearing it soon, and that I'd contact her in the next couple days, so she should keep the phone on her at all times.&nbsp; I could practically hear her blushing over the phone as she stammered out thank-yous and brushing off the compliments.&nbsp; I reminded her to send that email immediately, and to trash everything but the phone.&nbsp; With that, I said goodbye, and hung up.

I turned off my phone and took out the battery.&nbsp; Still paranoid, I wasn't going to take any risks I didn't need to.&nbsp; I started my car and pulled out of the rest area, taking the next exit to turn around and head home.&nbsp; Relief was starting to set in, as everything seemed to be going well, and still nothing raised a flag that she was anything but what she said she was.&nbsp; As soon as I got home, I logged in to check my email, and to see if she followed my request.&nbsp; I was pleased when I found it as I expected.&nbsp; Like the special phone, she made the email her own too.&nbsp; She cursed at me, called me a sick perverted fuck.&nbsp; Told me that the used condom and Polaroid of it on my dick were the most disgusting things she's ever seen.&nbsp; She told me how she nearly vomited and that I belonged in hell and all sorts of other nasty things before saying she never wanted to talk to me again.

I read and smiled.&nbsp; She'd make me an excellent slave one day, and that day was coming soon.&nbsp; With that thought running through my head, I tried to reply to her email, to apologize for being so insulting.&nbsp; Stating how degrading and humiliating I thought it'd be to get that in the mail from a stranger, and telling her I was only trying to give her what I thought she wanted.&nbsp; Short, sweet, and to the point.&nbsp; I sent the email, and saw the bounce-back a moment later informing me that she had me blocked.&nbsp; Everything was working exactly as I wanted it to, at least so far.

I waited till Wednesday before I decided to call her again.&nbsp; This time, I drove across town to the Publix parking lot that didn't belong to the Publix down the street from me.&nbsp; At one point, she said she got out of school at 2:30, and was home by 3.&nbsp; I gave it a little more time, and around 3:15 I placed the call.

This time, it rung a dozen times before the automated operator telling me the mobile customer was unavailable.&nbsp; I was a little upset, I waited a few seconds and tried calling again.&nbsp; The phone rang once before she picked up, breathing heavily and apologizing.&nbsp; She said she was in the bathroom and couldn't get to the phone in time and begged me to forgive her.&nbsp; And in all her rambling, my anger disappeared into amusement.&nbsp; She was already trying to please me, and blustered when she felt she fell short.&nbsp; I chuckled over the phone while reassuring her that it was alright and okay and I wasn't upset about her missing the first call.

After she was breathing more normally, and I was able to contain my amusement at the whole situation, I talked to her a little more about what she said she wanted to find.&nbsp; I asked her if she still wanted to be someone's slave, after all the harassment she'd gotten so far online.&nbsp; She paused for a moment as I held my breath, before answering, �Not to any of those idiots and jerks online, but I'd be interested if it was someone cool, kinda like you.�&nbsp; My world spun...did she just come onto me?&nbsp; Did she just admit that all this time she's wanted me?

I exhaled and regained my composure.&nbsp; There were things I wanted to know, needed to know, if she was going to work.&nbsp; But, before I could ask the next question I planned to, I asked, �Like me?�

She giggled.&nbsp; GIGGLED before saying, �Yes like you silly!&nbsp; You're not a complete arrogant prick that wants me to kneel now.&nbsp; You let me get to know you, to like you.&nbsp; If you asked for it, I'd give you anything you wanted, even if it was the last thing I gave.�

It took a couple breaths before I could respond.&nbsp; This wasn't police entrapment.&nbsp; They don't make the offer, they accept it after you extend yourself, and make your intent clear.&nbsp; �And you still want to disappear, to vanish without a trace?� I managed to get out.

She was so quick to respond that she nearly cut me off.&nbsp; �YES!&nbsp; I mean, ideally I'd like to disappear without a trace.&nbsp; If no one in my old life, my life right now, knew where I went or how to find me, I could start over in my new life.&nbsp; I could start fresh as a slave, to wholly exist for somebody else, to fulfill their desires, wants, and needs without worry for my own.�

She was falling right into place, and without any real effort.&nbsp; And far ahead of schedule too.&nbsp; I hadn't even done half the legwork I needed in order for this all to work.&nbsp; �Well dear, you may find that one day soon, but it isn't something I can offer today.&nbsp; I have a meeting to get to soon, and I'm going to be gone for the rest of this week and weekend, so let us make the most of what I have left.&nbsp; Tell me about your day and your plans for the time I'm gone.�

I sat and listened.&nbsp; And planned.&nbsp; I wasn't originally planning to go out of town this weekend, but it's not like I had anything keeping me from it either.&nbsp; And I needed to get down to her area and scout some locations.&nbsp; I needed to find someplace that would work, one that was close enough for her to walk to.&nbsp; One without cameras, security, or commonly seen by the public at night.&nbsp; I had vague ideas in mind, the loading docks to a strip mall, or a wooded area behind a doctor's office.&nbsp; And I needed to get a few more supplies to her, sent without a trail back to me.&nbsp; I ended the phone call claiming I had to get to the meeting, and began my preparations...including shutting down my phone.

First, I needed to get a large, single-compartment duffel bag that could carry about 150lbs.&nbsp; I dropped into the local sporting goods store and looked at their stock.&nbsp; They had a lot of the smaller gym bags that wouldn't work for what I needed it to.&nbsp; I didn't want to ask, asking would create a memory in somebody else.&nbsp; Get in, get what you need, and get out.&nbsp; Make no impressions, leave no memories.&nbsp; Finally I found something that would work.&nbsp; It was large enough, and it could be collapsed into a small box for storage (or shipping).&nbsp; And, it was on clearance for under $100.&nbsp; I brought it to the register, again paying in cash, leaving no paper trail.

I threw the bag in the trunk, and drove to the sex-toy shop.&nbsp; I needed a pair of handcuffs, real ones, like the police use, with no safety emergency release button.&nbsp; They were easy enough to find, the local toy shop being quite kink-friendly.&nbsp; I also decided to pick up a full spandex hood while I was there.&nbsp; Just a guy looking to play kinky in the bedroom, not worth a second thought.&nbsp; I paid for them in cash, and walked out the door without a second glance.

Finally, I needed something that would work well as a gag.&nbsp; I settled on a sock and Duct Tape.&nbsp; Both, by themselves, are fairly easily compromised when used as a gag.&nbsp; It's easy to spit the sock out of your mouth.&nbsp; A little spit and some tongue pressure and the Duct Tape comes right off as well.&nbsp; But, when you combine the sock to absorb the spit (and prevent directed pressure against the Duct Tape), and the Duct Tape to hold it in, you have an effective gag that could last for hours.&nbsp; And the best place to get both?&nbsp; Walgreens.&nbsp; I walked in, picked up the Duct Tape, a small package of socks, some toothpaste, and a pack of gum.&nbsp; A random assortment of items, nothing to draw any notice.&nbsp; Paid with cash, and I was heading home to pack.

First, the box to ship to Sue, with all the items she'd require.&nbsp; I put on a pair of gloves and a hairnet.&nbsp; Still being cautious, I pulled out the items she'd need.&nbsp; I took the top strip of tape off the roll of Duct Tape, in case it had my prints from the store.&nbsp; Then I pulled out a sock from the bag, put it in the center of roll.&nbsp; I pulled the spandex hood out of it's plastic packaging and included it in the center of the roll as well.&nbsp; Then I pulled the cuffs out of the little box they came in.&nbsp; I removed the keys and put them in my pocket.&nbsp; She wouldn't need the keys.&nbsp; I adjusted the cuffs till they fit easily in the center of the roll of tape as well, then slipped the small bundle into the duffel bag.&nbsp; With everything in the duffel, I collapsed it as small as I could before stuffing it into a box for shipment.&nbsp; Again, I addressed it with her address, and a fake return address.&nbsp; I then packed a couple changes of clothes, some toiletries, and got a cheap hotel the next town down the highway from Sue from Orbitz.&nbsp; I'd have to use my credit card, but it was just a short vacation, and no one would have enough cause to pull the records and connect them.

I loaded the car, and started my way down to the hotel, stopping by the post office first to ship the package.&nbsp; The drive wasn't too bad, but it was well into the evening by the time I checked into the hotel and was able to shower.&nbsp; Soon I'd head out to look for the perfect place...but first some online research.

I pulled up the map for Sue's address, and began to zoom out and look at the surrounding area.&nbsp; I noted major shopping complexes and strip malls, and a few other commercial 9-5 establishments surrounding her neighborhood.&nbsp; It'd take awhile to scout them all, but at least I had a place to start.&nbsp; And start I did, leaving the hotel and jumping into my car.&nbsp; I drove up the highway, and navigated my way to the first possible location.

It was a Winn-Dixie shopping plaza.&nbsp; It was about 11, and some of the stores were just locking up.&nbsp; I checked out the area behind the plaza, and found security cameras and flood lights.&nbsp; This place didn't fit my needs, and it was time to move on.

The next area was a tire store.&nbsp; The parking lot was small and dark, and the area behind the store looked to be an overgrown field, hidden from view.&nbsp; The only problem was, it was located on a busy intersection, and the only place to park the car was exposed to the general public.&nbsp; This one didn't quite work either, I wanted no possibility of witnesses.

I drove down the street checking out the next few areas without stopping.&nbsp; A gas station which seemed to be open all night, butted right up against a residential back yard.&nbsp; A fenced in day care yard where the whole facility was easily visible to the street.&nbsp; I didn't expect it to be easy to find a place, but I was hoping some would be closer than this.

I continued on driving, until I came across a small veterinarian office.&nbsp; The parking lot wrapped around the building on three sides, the far side being hidden from the road.&nbsp; The fourth side of the office was shaded and dark, and butted right into a thick wooded area.&nbsp; The traffic on the road in front of the office was fairly light...only a car every minute or so at midnight.&nbsp; This place would work if I didn't find anything better.

I kept searching the commercial areas around the area, but none were any better then the veterinarian office I saw earlier, and they were all at least twice as far of a walk for Sue.&nbsp; I decided to head back to the hotel and crashed for the night, and felt as if I had accomplished much.&nbsp; I remember looking at the clock and realizing it was after 1 before my memory faded for the night.

I woke mid morning, and relaxed in the bed.&nbsp; Everything seemed to be coming together, and nothing had gone wrong yet.&nbsp; I still needed to set up the old farm house for the initial training.&nbsp; It really wasn't a farm, but it was a nice house built out in the woods by my grandparents.&nbsp; It was still quite rural, the nearest neighbor being close to a mile away, and was in the middle of an 18 acre plot.&nbsp; It afforded all sorts of privacy, and since I maintained such an inconsistent schedule between the house in town and the farm house, the neighbors learned not to visit.

I decided to take a shower and get dressed before heading out for lunch.&nbsp; I had one more thing I wanted to do before I got the farm house ready...I wanted to actually see the girl who said she would be willing to disappear and become my slave.&nbsp; I felt a bit creepy and like a stalker, and it was an added risk I didn't really need to take...but it would be one last confirmation Sue was real.

I knew where she went to school, and I knew where her home was.&nbsp; And I remember her talking about the rusted old Buick her parents let her drive, and only did so because it'd overheat and break down if she drove any further than school.&nbsp; Only she wouldn't need to drive to get away, she'd walk a few blocks and her life as Sue would end.&nbsp; I cruised around the area until around 2:30 when school let out.&nbsp; Then I positioned myself in a parking lot several blocks away from her house, but along the route she'd take home, and waited.

It was about 2:50 when I spotted a rusted Buick coming from the right direction.&nbsp; The windows were down and all I could tell in the moment she passed was that she had flaming red hair, and it was flowing in the wind as she drove along.&nbsp; I decided to pull out of the parking lot, and follow her to her block.

She didn't seem to notice my car following her all the way home.&nbsp; As she made the turn into her driveway, I stopped at the end of her street to watch...and that's when I decided to make an unexpected call.&nbsp; I put the battery in my phone, and watched her gather her books and homework from her car while the phone booted up.&nbsp; She wore loose pants that didn't accentuate her figure, nor did the fairly loose fitting shirt.&nbsp; But it hinted enough, she was trim and in shape.&nbsp; She'd probably have made a good cheerleader flier, if she had been better with the school's social politics.&nbsp; She closed the door to her car as I dialed her number, and it began ringing.

She was about half way to her front door when she nearly tripped and dropped all her books.&nbsp; I watched her shift them to one arm and freed a hand to fish into her pants pocket.&nbsp; She pulled out the phone and answered it, and I heard her voice and practically watched her lips move.&nbsp; �OMG, I didn't expect you to call so soon.&nbsp; Is everything okay?&nbsp; Shit, I just got home from school and haven't even made it inside yet, I'd like to get inside before we really talk, Sir.�

My heart skipped a beat at the Sir.&nbsp; I never asked her to call me Sir, and I doubt I ever would.&nbsp; Requiring titles just forces the people that use them to change their meaning and inherent respect and honor.&nbsp; When someone gives you an honorific without being required to, you know they must really mean it.&nbsp; �Get inside and everything's okay, girl.&nbsp; I just had a brief free moment to call you, and figured I'd do so.�&nbsp; As I finished my last sentence, she slipped through the front door and into her house, and I decided to drive off as I finished my conversation.

She gushed about how happy she was to hear from me, and how she hadn't been expecting to hear from me until the next week.&nbsp; She told me about a dream she had of me, asking her to run away and come to me.&nbsp; If only she knew how close she came to predicting her future.&nbsp; As she was going on about her day and continuing to say how glad she was to hear from me, and how it's made her day, I told her my break was coming to an end, but I wanted to let her know something first.

I told her I had another gift heading towards her, and that it should arrive near the end of next week.&nbsp; And I had specific instructions involving the package.&nbsp; She was to open the box, take the single item out of it, and toss the box.&nbsp; She wasn't to open or examine the contents of the package past that until I told her what I wanted her to do with it.&nbsp; She'd place it under her bed, or in her closet, and leave it there&nbsp; until I told her to retrieve it, and as I came to expect, she agreed to it all without protest.&nbsp; With that, I said my goodbye, and shut down the phone.

Instead of heading straight back to the hotel, I decided to stop into a public library for a few moments.&nbsp; I looked up the tracking status of the package, and noted that it'd be delivered Wednesday.&nbsp; After that, I did some searching to figure out who was responsible for garbage collection for Sue's residence, and what days they picked up.&nbsp; She was in the City, and her garbage days happened to be Monday and Thursday.&nbsp; It looked like the timing was going to be just right, and the box would be in the dump before anyone thought to look for it.

With my research done, I cleared the library cache and headed back to the hotel room.&nbsp; I decided to spend the rest of the afternoon and evening vegging out to TV shows, until they put me to sleep early.&nbsp; The next day I was up just after 9, with the TV still on.&nbsp; I shut it off, and took a quick shower before getting ready to check out.&nbsp; I gathered my things, put them in my car, and returned the room key to the desk, paying my bill and leaving the town.

I headed towards the Farm House, to prepare it for reception.&nbsp; Shortly after my grandparents passed and left me the property, I renovated part of the basement.&nbsp; In one room, I covered the floors in large pillows.&nbsp; On the walls at about waist height, and in a few places on the floor I secured rings soundly into the cinder block walls and concrete floor.&nbsp; I also placed one small, prison-issue toilet in the corner of the room.&nbsp; I replaced the door jam to allow for two doors, one was made of solid wood to block light and sound from entering or leaving the room.&nbsp; The other was modeled after the bars in a Hollywood jail cell.&nbsp; The next room has some furniture in it: Benches, Tables, Crosses, and the like.&nbsp; Some of the walls had rings like the first room.&nbsp; Several rings dangled off the ceiling beams as well.&nbsp; The other walls had whips, paddles, and chains hanging from them and ready for use.&nbsp; The final room had fiberglass covering the floor and going up the walls to the ceiling.&nbsp; In the center of the room was a large drain, and there were a couple garden spigots on each wall.&nbsp; One wall also had a fire hose system attached.&nbsp; This room also had rings dangling from the ceiling beams.

First thing I did when I arrived was adjusted the thermostat programming.&nbsp; As I generally spent more time at the house in town, I only ran the AC enough to keep the humidity and mildew controlled.&nbsp; Now I wanted it turned down so that being naked was slightly uncomfortable.&nbsp; I walked downstairs and pulled aside a few items I knew I'd want.&nbsp; In the water room, I set a safety razor and some shaving gel on a small, portable table made for pool decks that I kept in the room.&nbsp; If she didn't shave, I'd make sure it was done.&nbsp; In the dungeon room, I pulled aside a heavy metal locking collar, several chains, and a few Master Locks, and set them to the side in the pillow room.

From here, I checked the condition of the whips and other toys, conditioning them where needed.&nbsp; I checked the water to make sure it still flowed (I remember forgetting the bill once and getting embarrassed when a waterbondage scene turned into a bondage and blush seen).&nbsp; I checked the linens on my bed and found them to have the unused, musky smell, so I changed them.&nbsp; Then I sat in the living room, pulled over my laptop to surf the internet, and turned on the TV to see what was on.

The rest of the weekend went rather slowly.&nbsp; Everything I needed to do was done.&nbsp; I stocked up on some groceries for the Farm House, but for the most part, time was spent thinking of what to do to Sue, thinking of what to do if she decided to change her mind, and trying to come up with all the variables and possibilities of what could happen with my plans.

Monday rolled around, and since I said I was only gone for the weekend, I decided I shouldn't put off calling Sue after she got home from school.&nbsp; I kept the conversation brief, and had her repeat her instructions about the package and gift back to me, which she did with a slightly annoyed tone.&nbsp; After that, another few days of waiting.&nbsp; I decided to drive back to my house in Town, after all, if I needed anonymous internet, the library was closer.

Wednesday rolled around, and I went to the library to check the tracking status of the package.&nbsp; There had been no updates since it left the sorting facility the day after I last checked it.&nbsp; Either they're delivering it and haven't scanned it (I've had it happen to me before), or it's lost in their warehouse.&nbsp; Either way, I felt I should call and check on Sue, as it has been a few days.&nbsp; This time, I decided to call right from the library parking lot.&nbsp; She picked up after the third ring.&nbsp; I asked her how she was doing and how the last couple days went, and some other small talk.&nbsp; I asked (already assuming the answer was the typical nothing) if she had any plans over the next few days, or over the weekend, and I assumed right.&nbsp; Then I asked her if she had gotten the package, and she said she did, with no excitement in her voice.&nbsp; I asked her where it was, and she said under the bed, where I told her to put it and leave it.&nbsp; Then I asked her why she was sounding so down about the gift.&nbsp; She said she thought it'd be something nicer, after all, the last thing I got her was a phone, but all she saw was some sort of bag.&nbsp; I laughed as I told her that the best gifts are the ones we least suspect.&nbsp; I asked her where the box was, which she confirmed it was in the trash as I had ordered.&nbsp; I inquired to what days her trash got picked up, she confirmed what I knew from the library research, and I asked if it was going to get out in time.&nbsp; She sighed, like any kid being asked to do chores, and said she was supposed to do it in the morning before school.&nbsp; I merely told her to make sure she did, and said my goodbyes.









I decided to stay up late so I slept in late.&nbsp; The next evening was going to be long, and I'd be driving well into the night.&nbsp; I woke up, and anxiously paced around the house biding my time.&nbsp; I let the clock tick to 4, then to 5 before jumping in the car and stopping in a random strip mall on the way out of town to make my last phone call.&nbsp; As she picked up, I asked her if the trash had made it out in time.&nbsp; �Of course!� she said.&nbsp; I asked what time she expected her parents home tonight...she said she wasn't sure, but probably after midnight like usual.&nbsp; Then I asked her the question that she wasn't expecting...Are you ready to disappear tonight?

The line remained silent.&nbsp; �Are you ready to disappear Sue?&nbsp; Are you ready to start your new life, vanish and become what you want?�&nbsp; Some stammering and stuttering filled my speaker.&nbsp; Finally the word I was waiting to hear came across; yes.

I told her that I needed her to do everything I asked and follow all my instructions without question.&nbsp; She numbly agreed, and I continued.&nbsp; She needed to pack a gym bag of clothes, preferably her favorites.&nbsp; She also needed to grab whatever money and valuable jewelry she owned, and include it in the bag.&nbsp; If she had any prized possessions that she could carry, she needed to include them as well.&nbsp; I told her I wanted to make it appear like she was running away.&nbsp; She started to catch on and mentioned a few other items that she'd think she'd pack if she were running away from home, and I pleasantly told her to include them.&nbsp; I sat on the line and listened to her quickly stuffing and packing her bag, until she informed me she had completed that task.

Next, I instructed her to grab the gift from the last package from under her bed.&nbsp; I asked her to open it, and went over the items in the bag, and what she was to do with them.&nbsp; Later, when she got to the location I'd inform her of soon,&nbsp; she would strip completely naked.&nbsp; She started to balk at the idea until I cut her short, informing her that if she wanted to be a slave, she was there to please her Master, and if her Master wanted to see her uncovered, that's what she'd do.&nbsp; She hesitated a moment before acquiescing, and I continued my instructions.&nbsp; After she was naked, and her clothes were stuffed in the gym bag she just packed, she would stuff the sock into her mouth, and then Duct Tape over it to form as effective of a gag as she could manage.&nbsp; She would then climb into the bag, zip it closed with her inside it. Finally, she would pull the hood over her head, and handcuff her hands together.&nbsp; She would wait like that quietly in the location until I arrive to retrieve her.

I made a quick note of warning about the handcuffs.&nbsp; I didn't include a set of keys for her.&nbsp; Once they're closed around a wrist or other object, they won't release again with that object in them, and she needs to make sure she doesn't close them on herself or anything else until she's secure in the bag.

I had her repeat the instructions back to me, and confident that she knew them, I continued.&nbsp; I asked her if she knew of the veterinarian office.&nbsp; She said she was vaguely familiar and should be able to find it easily.&nbsp; I told her about how it's right next to the woods, and blocked from public view.&nbsp; She was to place her gym bag into the duffel bag I gave her.&nbsp; She'd carry them to the veterinarian office, and about 10-15 steps into the woods like she was walking along the back wall of the office and continued into the woods.&nbsp; From there, she'd take her gym bag out of the duffel, and proceed to strip and secure herself as instructed.&nbsp; If she wants to disappear, this is the only way I know to do it, and if she trusts me enough to be my slave, she needs to trust me enough to pick her up.

As I confirmed one last time the location, order of events, and other instructions, I had two last instructions I needed to give her.&nbsp; First, she was to leave her house at 10:30pm, and should make it to the veterinarian office around 11.&nbsp; Second, she was to keep my phone on vibrate, and leave it screen-up on top of her gym bag.&nbsp; With that said, I told her I'd get her soon, and her life would change, and hung up.

It was done.&nbsp; Either she'd do what I asked, and be mine, or she was calling the cops and I was looking forward to an entertaining night with lawyers.&nbsp; Nothing could be done about all that, though; I was all in.&nbsp; I shut down my phone and started the drive to Sue's town.&nbsp; I'd get there between 9 and 10, and that would give me some time to eat and relax before picking her up.

I got into town, and sat down to a decent dinner.&nbsp; I paid for my meal and checked the time.&nbsp; I remember thinking that she'd be leaving her house right about now.&nbsp; I wanted to let her lay there for awhile, so I wasn't planning on getting her till around midnight.&nbsp; With an hour or so to kill, I did the only thing I knew to do; walk around Wal-Mart.&nbsp; It killed the time, and I picked up some Icy Hot, and a few fingers of ginger root; both are always fun to play with.

Time came to head toward the veterinarian office, and the butterflies were in my stomach, in my chest; there wasn't much they weren't fluttering around in.&nbsp; I got into the parking lot and backed up so my trunk faced the woods.&nbsp; After popping the trunk and making sure it was open and available, I walked my way into the woods.&nbsp; Stumbled would be more like it; it was a new moon and I had forgotten a flashlight.&nbsp; Luckily I had told her 10-15 steps, and she must have decided 10 steps of stumbling were far enough.&nbsp; The bags were murky lumps on the ground, but recognizable if you knew you were looking for them.&nbsp; First I picked up her gym bag, and tossed it into the trunk of the car.&nbsp; I noticed it was black with pink highlights as I turned around to go get the real prize: fresh girl meat.

Finding her the second time was even easier than the first, since I knew where to look.&nbsp; I carefully felt for the straps and arranged myself to get enough leverage, and picked her up off the ground.&nbsp; I heard gasps coming from the bag, and a few grunts when I tripped and she hit the ground, but finally I got her in my trunk as well.&nbsp; �Rest well, girl.&nbsp; You will need it.�&nbsp; With that said, I closed the trunk, and climbed in the car to drive away.

I headed towards the highway and went in the direction of the farm house.&nbsp; It was a few hour's drive, and I pulled in early in the morning.&nbsp; I popped the trunk and grabbed my prize out, and carried her down to the basement.&nbsp; I dumped her, still in the bag, in the water room.&nbsp; I heard a grunt and some whimpers as I walked back to the trunk to get her clothes and valuables.&nbsp; I took these down to the basement as well, but set them in a closet to rummage through later.

I was hungry from the drive and it being several hours since my last meal, and decided to fix a snack.&nbsp; She could wait while I ate, and it'd allow her mind to build and spin the situation over and over again.&nbsp; I settled on a ham and cheese sandwich, and quickly finished it.&nbsp; I grabbed a coke from the fridge and started to wash the sandwich down as I descended into the basement.

As I walked into the water room, she was still whimpering.&nbsp; �Oh be quiet.� I said.&nbsp; The whimpering continued, but she was making an effort to quiet it.&nbsp; I found the zipper on the bag and opened it up to reveal my prize.&nbsp; Her red hair was matted with sweat where it peaked out from under the hood.&nbsp; Her body glistened with it.&nbsp; I was glad I took her to the water room first, she definitely needed the bath.

She flinched at the first touch as I pulled her up out of the bag.&nbsp; I took the handcuff keys I kept in my pocket and released her wrists, which she promptly began to rub.&nbsp; I made a small comment about it being her fault she closed them too tight, and grabbed one wrist to secure it into a wrist restraint attached to a cable at the top of one of the walls.&nbsp; Before she could react, I grabbed her other wrist to do the same.&nbsp; Her ankles were attached to a spreader bar that was secured through a loop on the floor.

I started the winches up and the cables attached to her wrist restraints tightened and pulled until she had little freedom of movement.&nbsp; She stood there, still gagged and hooded, standing spread eagle and helpless before me.&nbsp; I yanked the hood off and looked at her, and let her see me for the first time.&nbsp; I still don't know how to describe the emotions that ran through her eyes when she first saw me, the mix was intense and unique.&nbsp; Her face was...not perfect, but she'd easily pass for a 9.9.&nbsp; Her breasts were the perky C cups of a teenager.&nbsp; And she was a natural red head, and I'd be removing the reason I knew soon enough.

�I'd inspect you now, to see what I've actually picked up, but you're disgusting.&nbsp; You're covered in sweat and smell like you've worked in the field all day.&nbsp; So first, you're getting hosed down.�&nbsp; I walked over to one of the walls, and grabbed a garden hose.&nbsp; I have both hot and cold water spigots, but I find cold helps set the right frame of mind.&nbsp; As I turn on the water, she starts trying to scream through the gag.&nbsp; �I'm going to wash you, whether you like it or not.&nbsp; You can accept it, or hate it, but either way, it's going to happen.&nbsp; This is the life you've chosen.&nbsp; No one knows you're here.&nbsp; No one knows you had anything to do with me.&nbsp; I can get away with whatever I chose to do with you, no one knows anything to stop me.&nbsp; You live to please, satisfy, serve and amuse me.&nbsp; If you can't even fulfill those basic functions, you're of no use, like a lame horse.&nbsp; Now I'm going to clean you up, and see what I have to work with.�

I turned the hose on her, pinching the tip to increase the pressure it hit with.&nbsp; I started on her head, soaking her hair and her face, slowly rinsing the sweat off her body.&nbsp; Along her arms and up and down her torso.&nbsp; I had a little fun hitting her tits, making her nipples perk up in the cold water.&nbsp; Then I rinsed down her legs, and rotated around to hit her back side.&nbsp; In the corner, I had a bucket of soap with a brush in it, the kind of brush made for washing cars.&nbsp; I grabbed the brush and carried it over to her, scrubbing her hair and her body.&nbsp; I scrubbed deep into the mound of her pubis and laughed as she jerked and screamed to escape the sensation.&nbsp; I continued and finished the rest of her body, and then took the hose to rinse her down one more time.

With the last of the soap rinse from her skin, I turned off the hose and coiled it away.&nbsp; As I walked back to her, I heard her gasp for breaths.&nbsp; Next on the list was to shave the bush off her.&nbsp; I got a bowl and filled it with hot water, then carried the table with the razor and shaving gel I set out the week before, and set up next to her.&nbsp; I grabbed the bottle of shaving gel, and applied a generous amount over her furry parts.&nbsp; I dipped the razor in the hot water, and then slowly began removing her hair, bit by bit.

It took a long time, but she was finally smooth, front and back, and everything between.&nbsp; One last run to the hose to spray the remnants of the shaving gel off her, and she was clean, and I could begin my inspection.

I looked into her ears, and her eyes.&nbsp; Everything looked clean and clear.&nbsp; I decided to leave the gag in for now, and to check her teeth after I was done.&nbsp; I felt along her neck and her shoulders, and along her arms.&nbsp; She was as toned as any high school athlete, at least so far.&nbsp; Walking behind her, I ran my hand along her back and spine, without finding anything new to comment on.&nbsp; I grabbed her ass and gave her cheeks a good squeeze and kneading.&nbsp; They were firm and muscular, and perfectly round save for the dimples on the sides.&nbsp; Continuing down her legs I found the same fit, toned muscles that were on everything I touched before.&nbsp; I stood up and walked around to her front.&nbsp; I felt the pectoral muscles and let them lead me to her breasts.&nbsp; I gave them a firm squeeze, pleased that the perkiness included a nice firm and consistent tissue in her breast.&nbsp; Her nipples were still erect from the cold, and were of the small pencil eraser variety with almost no areola.&nbsp; Her ribs seemed intact, and her abdomen was firm under a soft layer of fascia.&nbsp; The front of her legs were no different then the backs, firm and toned.&nbsp; I took the time to examine her feet.&nbsp; The skin was soft and there were few calloused parts.&nbsp; They made me think she'd had a pampered life to date.&nbsp; I stood up to check her hands, still in the restraints.&nbsp; Her nails were trimmed but smooth.&nbsp; Again, like her feet, her skin was soft and smooth.

Now that everything else was done, it was finally time to check her teeth.&nbsp; I ripped the tape off her mouth, smirking as she nearly spit out the sock in a scream.&nbsp; She nearly sucked it down into her throat as she gasped for breath after the scream.&nbsp; I reached up and gingerly pulled out the sock.&nbsp; Immediately she began talking.&nbsp; �Did you have to be so mean?&nbsp; Why'd you use the cold water?&nbsp; I could have easily taken a nice warm...�&nbsp; She ended abruptly as I slapped her square across her face.&nbsp; I could see her nearly begin to cry.&nbsp; �Whyhyhy?� she stammered, as I took a step back.

�Be quiet.� I said.&nbsp; �From now on, you're not to speak unless spoken to.&nbsp; Do you understand me?�&nbsp; She nodded her head slowly, almost in shock.&nbsp; �Now, not that I have to answer you, but I'll humor you this time.&nbsp; I washed you with cold water because that's how I chose to wash you.&nbsp; You're here to please me, and you'll be my property.&nbsp; The way I choose to treat you is the way you'll be treated, and you will accept it.&nbsp; Now, do you understand this?� I asked again, and again she nodded slowly.

�Now I'm going to let you make the last choice you may have about your life.�&nbsp; She tried to swallow, tears still welling in her eyes.&nbsp; �Is this the life you want?&nbsp; To be my property.&nbsp; To fulfill my whims.&nbsp; To please me, in whatever way I choose, for the rest of your life?&nbsp; You may speak.�

�I wish you weren't being so mean...you were so nice before now, why are you so mean?� she replied.

�This is your chance to return home, if you so choose.&nbsp; I'm mean because I chose to be, as I will be sometimes.&nbsp; At other times I will be nice.&nbsp; Time to make your last choice, is this what you want for the rest of your life?&nbsp; Answer no and I will return you to the area where I picked you up, no harm done.� I replied.

�Yes,� she sighed.&nbsp; �Yes, this is what I want.&nbsp; I just wish...� she responded, as I cut her off.

�Good.&nbsp; Now open your mouth, I want to take a look at your teeth.�&nbsp; I walked up to her and took a close look at her teeth.&nbsp; I pulled her cheeks away from her teeth to see what I could.&nbsp; They looked healthy enough for an 18 year-old girl.&nbsp; �You may close your mouth,� I said as I walked towards the table.&nbsp; Laying on the table was a syringe.&nbsp; I prepared a dose of Depo earlier in the evening for my lovely new slave.&nbsp; As I walked toward her with the syringe in hand, she began to talk.

�What is that for?&nbsp; What are you doing?� she stammered.&nbsp; I replied by giving her a slap across her face.&nbsp; �What was THAT for?� she demanded.

�I said you were only to speak if you were spoken to.� I replied, slapping her again.&nbsp; She'd learn to follow the rules I set, or she'd live a short, miserable life.&nbsp; �Now this, this is a little thing called Depo.&nbsp; If you don't know what that is, it's birth control.&nbsp; I don't want you getting pregnant, at least not yet, so I'm going to do what I decide is in my best interest to prevent that.&nbsp; Now be still while I give you this.�&nbsp; I walked behind her as she swiveled her head in a vain attempt to follow me.&nbsp; Squatting down, I stabbed the needle of the syringe into her left ass cheek, and pushed the pump forward.&nbsp; After I was done, I pulled it out and gave her ass a few playful smacks.&nbsp; �See, that wasn't so bad.� I said as I stood up, returning the syringe to the table where I picked it up from.

�Now, tonight is going to be a long night.&nbsp; I'm going to test you, as a continuance of my inspection.&nbsp; I want to see where you are, what tolerances I have to work with, and where I should focus your training for improvement.&nbsp; First, let's get you down from there.�&nbsp; I said, and walked towards the winch controls.&nbsp; I lowered her arms until they were sitting next to her head, and she began to wipe the tears from earlier off her face.

I undid her cuffs and grabbed her by the hair.&nbsp; Without pausing, I led her to the dungeon room.&nbsp; She gasped as she saw the array of whips and other instruments of torture I had arrayed on the walls.&nbsp; I brought her to the center of the room, and tied her standing spread eagle.&nbsp; I let her stand there, in shock or awe, I couldn't figure out which, at all the toys spread across the walls.&nbsp; As she was distracted and not paying attention to me, I pulled a signal whip off the wall and cracked it next to her ear.&nbsp; She yelped and moved as far away from me as she could in her binds, which didn't bother me any.

I moved in, cracking the whip left and right across her skin.&nbsp; Little red welts began to raise on her skin back as I moved down the length of her torso.&nbsp; She screamed and cried as I worked my way down her back, attempting with each strike to get further from the edge of my whip.&nbsp; As I moved down towards her ass, I noticed a change in her behavior.&nbsp; She wasn't fighting so hard to get away from the whip, and was sitting there taking it.&nbsp; Her breathing was heavy and ragged, and she took a deep gasp in every time the whip cracked across her ass.&nbsp; More little red welts appeared.&nbsp; I began to bore with the whip, and decided to move on to my next toy.

I grabbed a quarter inch cane off the wall.&nbsp; I began by swatting her on her firm tits, right across her nipples.&nbsp; A scream rose from her throat and she twisted away from my next strike, which caught her across her ribs and left tit.&nbsp; Already the streaks from the cane strikes were swelling up on her pale breasts.&nbsp; I rotated around to get a better angle and struck again, and again, moving with her as she struggled to unsuccessfully protect herself from my torments.&nbsp; At some point, I switched to her back side, and began wailing down blows to her back and ass.&nbsp; I kept changing it up, keeping her off balance on where the next strike would come.

And then I tossed the cane aside, and began spanking her ass.&nbsp; She yelped at the change, and continued to try to avoid my blows.&nbsp; With my left arm I grabbed her hips to hold her still, and began raining down with my palm.&nbsp; By this time, her ass was one swollen mass of red, and I kept beating her with my hand.&nbsp; At times I'd close my fist and punch her in her ass before going back to slaps.&nbsp; Each breath she made seemed labored between the sobs coming out of her mouth, and still I continued.&nbsp; Soon my arm was beginning to tire, and I decided to move on to the final step for her tonight.

On the wall in front of her was a spiked leather belt.&nbsp; The spikes weren't needle sharp, but they were sharp enough.&nbsp; Folding the belt in half, I walked over to her.&nbsp; I ran the belt over her breasts, watching as she shivered at the sensation of them scraping across her skin.&nbsp; I continued down her stomach and around her side.&nbsp; The shivers got stronger as I ran the belt up her welted back, and stopped at the nape of her neck as she took a deep breath in.&nbsp; I swung the belt back, and brought it forward straight onto her ass.&nbsp; The scream that came out of her mouth deafened me, but I pulled back and swung again.&nbsp; Little spots of blood began to come up from her ass and I swung again, and again.&nbsp; More and more blood came out, until it began running between her ass crack and down her legs.

It was about this time when I finally noticed the throbbing hard-on in my pants.&nbsp; I continued to swing the belt, until blood ran down her legs in drops...and then I stopped.&nbsp; I set the belt aside, and took off my clothes.&nbsp; At this point, I was extremely horny and ready to take her.&nbsp; I took her down from the spread eagle position she was in, and bent her over a table.&nbsp; I ran my dick up and down her crotch, smiling as the mix of blood and juices coated my head.&nbsp; And then I rammed my cock deep into her ass.&nbsp; She screamed again as I began to pump heavily into her.&nbsp; It wasn't long before I was ready to come inside her, and still she was screaming from the violation of her ass.&nbsp; With one last thrust, I came inside her., filling her ass with my seed.&nbsp; I pulled out and sat down on the table beside her, and began petting her hair as I caught my breath.

�Good girl, that's a good girl.&nbsp; You did well.� I said reassuringly, as I continued to pet her.&nbsp; �You did well.� I continued to repeat.&nbsp; Finally I was ready to move, and brought her back into the water room.&nbsp; I took a spray bottle of alcohol I had on the side of the room, and sprayed it on her ass and legs.&nbsp; She whimpered as the alcohol worked its way inside her wounds.&nbsp; I always love the burn it gives when it gets into the wounds of a girl I've just worked over.

�Here, clean yourself up a bit, � I said as I tossed her the hose.&nbsp; I turned it on a slow stream, and sat down to watch as she rubbed her legs down with cold water.&nbsp; �Don't forget your ass,� I said as she worked her way up her legs.&nbsp; I watched as the blood ran down her leg, mixing with the water and slowly wandered its way down the drain.&nbsp; At this point she was nearly done, so I got up to grab a towel.&nbsp; As she dropped the hose and stood up straight, I looked over at her.

She wasn't smiling back at me, but she wasn't looking angry or hurt either.&nbsp; It seems like she'd accepted her place to please me in whatever sick and depraved ways I decided.&nbsp; �Let me see,� I stated as I motioned for her to turn around.&nbsp; You could still see the risen welts of the whip and cane, and the small spots of blood from the belt.&nbsp; �Good,� I said as I went to turn off the spigot.&nbsp; After it was off I threw her the towel I had been holding.

I waited until she had dried herself off, pointing to the hamper in the corner when she looked done.&nbsp; She walked gingerly to the hamper and tossed the towel in it.&nbsp; She's probably be feeling the night's session for a few days to come.&nbsp; �Good girl,� I said as I walked up to her, putting my hand in her hair.&nbsp; I bent her down and began walking towards the pillow room, where I had left the chains and collar earlier when prepping the house.

As I entered the room, I walked us over to where I set the chains and collar down.&nbsp; I smiled as I grabbed the collar, and opened it from the hinge in it.&nbsp; I slid it around her neck, and grabbing a master lock, locked it to her neck.&nbsp; I grabbed another master lock and locked the chain to a ring attached to the front of the collar.&nbsp; Grabbing another master lock, I grabbed the chain and led her over to the wall near the toilet.&nbsp; I found a ring in the wall and locked the chain to it, giving her just enough room to roam from the toilet to the pillowed floor.

�Sleep well dear,� I said, as I walked to the bared door.&nbsp; I shut the lights off in the room and locked the door behind me, heading up to the house to take a shower before heading to bed.&nbsp; I was quite proud of my new possession.&nbsp; Not only was she stunningly beautiful, but she was already molding well to her new life of torment and use.&nbsp; I look forward to the coming weeks, where I'd slowly break her into the perfect slave.









I woke up around mid-morning, feeling well rested despite my exploits from the night before.&nbsp; I stretched while laying in bed, smiling to myself at my new acquisition. She was waiting for me in the basement, awaiting my commands and directives, supple to my will.&nbsp; Well, I decided, best not to keep her waiting.

I walked my way down the stairs and into the dungeon room.&nbsp; I grabbed a few pieces of rope and walked my way into the pillow room, unlocking the door before me.&nbsp; She was still peacefully sound asleep on the pillows near the toilet, breathing deeply and restfully despite the light coming on in the room.&nbsp; I walked over to her, dropped all but one piece of rope beside me, and uncoiled the rope I kept in my hand.&nbsp; I reached down to her arms and grabbed her wrists behind her.&nbsp; Before she could fully wake, I bound her arms behind her back.

I looked down and noticed the scabs on her ass from the night before.&nbsp; A few of them had run over the night, and the drops of blood dried as they led their short ways down her ass.&nbsp; Smiling at the marks I left, I began looping the rope around her arms and chest, going above her tits.&nbsp; I crossed the rope and went back, going over the arms and across the top of her chest.&nbsp; Looping back around the center rope in the center of her back, I was running out of rope and picked up another from the floor.&nbsp; Extending my rope, I looped the rope under her arm and around the rope running between her arms and chest, before going to the other side and doing the same.&nbsp; From here I looped below her chest twice, and hooked the rope around the loops between her arms and her chest.&nbsp; I tied the rope off in the center of her back, and unlocked her from her collar and the wall.

Reaching down, I grabbed the final piece of rope I had tossed on the ground, and grabbed her up from the rope in the center of her back.&nbsp; Pulling her up, she grunted as she stumbled to her feet.&nbsp; Using the rope as a handle, I dragged her out into and down the hallway, and into the water room.&nbsp; I uncoiled the final rope and tied a larks head around the handle in the small of her back.&nbsp; I pushed her down to the ground and ran the rope through the ring attached to the winch.&nbsp; I started pulling the rope taught, then pushed her forward until she was leaning slightly forward on the rope.&nbsp; It was there that I tied the rope off.

I slid in front of her, and ran my cock into her mouth.&nbsp; As she swallowed it down her throat, I grabbed her hair by the back of her head.&nbsp; Holding her tightly, I began to release my bladder and empty the morning catch into her.&nbsp; Realizing what I was doing, she tried to scream and struggled to escape. I held her tight as her struggled became more than just trying to escape the warm liquid running down her throat, and more an attempt to get air.&nbsp; The throat tightened and convulsed around my dick and I began to get harder, as I emptied myself into her.&nbsp; Her struggles became more and more desperate as I held tight onto her hair, unrelentingly emptying my bladder into her stomach.&nbsp; She gagged and tried to cough as more and more of my piss ran down throat and into her gut.&nbsp; Her attempts to get away got weaker and weaker as my bladder neared emptying, until it was just a token muscle spasm trying to pull away from the obstruction filling her airway.&nbsp; Finally, emptying my bladder, I pulled out and stepped away and watched as she went limp, leaning forward on the rope that I had left her bound in.

I waited until she began to come to, slapping her a few times to bring her attention to the present.&nbsp; As she regained consciousness, she started coughing loudly and spitting onto the ground.&nbsp; Thinking she was about to puke, I grabbed the hose off the wall and turned it on.&nbsp; I set it on the ground with her between it and the drain.&nbsp; Feeling hungry, I decided to go upstairs and prepare myself some breakfast, debating on whether she'd be able to keep any down when I brought some down for her.

I walked down the hallway, closing the door behind me.&nbsp; She'd be safe in there till I got back.&nbsp; I walked up the stairs, smiling.&nbsp; Her time was going well, now only to figure out how to transform her into my perfect slave.&nbsp; What rules would she need to learn.&nbsp; I hadn't really thought this far ahead, and decided that I'd take it one day at a time.&nbsp; Around this point, I made it to the kitchen.&nbsp; I pulled some eggs out of the refrigerator and a pan out of the cupboard.&nbsp; I pulled a small black spatula out of one of my kitchen drawers.

I went to work cooking up some scrambled eggs.&nbsp; It'd been awhile since I actually cooked myself breakfast.&nbsp; Normally, I just go with a toasted Pop-Tart, if that.&nbsp; Luckily I didn't drop any of the shells into the pan as I cracked the eggs into it.&nbsp; Four eggs later and they were starting to fry up, and I was agitating them with the spatula to scramble them up.&nbsp; I went over to the refrigerator to pull out some cheddar cheese to put on the eggs.&nbsp; The eggs were almost done, in solid little clumps.&nbsp; I started to sprinkle the cheese over the eggs, letting it melt in.&nbsp; Using the spatula, I split the eggs into two portion and put them onto two plates I pulled out of a cupboard above my head.

I left the heat on and went into the fridge to pull out some bacon.&nbsp; I pulled a few slices out and threw them on the pan.&nbsp; The bacon immediately began to crackle and pop as the heat started to cook it.&nbsp; I pulled some tongs out of the drawer with kitchen utensils, and waited for the time to turn the bacon over.&nbsp; A few spits of grease popped up and hit me on the arm and stomach.&nbsp; I turned the bacon over and it began popping and spitting again in earnest.&nbsp; One of the popped spit out and caught me in my groin.&nbsp; One of these days I'll learn not to cook bacon naked, I thought, as I jumped back at the sudden shock.&nbsp; Shortly thereafter the bacon was done, but still chewy.&nbsp; I pulled the slices out and set them on my plate, and turned off the heat.

I grabbed a single fork out of the drawer with silverware in it, and walked my way down the stairs with the plates in hand.&nbsp; Hopefully she didn't make too much of a mess trying to keep down my piss.&nbsp; I opened the door to the water room, though it was a little bit of an effort with two plates in my hands.&nbsp; Luckily I didn't drop anything and the door swung open.

There she stood on her knees, hanging forward by the rope.&nbsp; The water was still running past her and into the drain.&nbsp; I couldn't tell if she puked anything up, but she was looking a lot less sick.&nbsp; I set the plates on a desk near the door, and went to turn off the water.&nbsp; I pulled the hose and coiled it back up on the wall, before walking over to her.&nbsp; I pet her a few times as I whispered, "Good girl."&nbsp; With my other hand I reached up and began undoing the knot to the rope that was holding her up.&nbsp; I stopped petting her and used my other hand to finish untying the knot, and lowered her to the ground.&nbsp; She laid on her stomach, her face up and looking around.

"I brought you some breakfast, dear," I said, as I walked over to the desk with the plates.&nbsp; I grabbed her plate off the desk and placed it beside her head.&nbsp; "I thought you may be hungry after last night."&nbsp; She looked up at me with confused eyes, probably wondering how she was going to eat without her hands, or any silverware.&nbsp; "Eat up, I have more in store for you, little girl."

I walked over to the desk and grabbed my plate.&nbsp; I leaned up against the wall as I grabbed my fork and began eating my bacon before it got cold.&nbsp; It was chewy goodness in my mouth, just how I liked it.&nbsp; Never got the point of rock hard and crispy bacon.&nbsp; I swallowed and grabbed the second piece of bacon with my fork, and put it into my mouth, chewing and savoring the flavor before swallowing it down.&nbsp; I looked over at her for a moment, before moving onto my eggs.&nbsp; She was eating off the plate like a dog, using her tongue and jaw to try to neatly get pieces of scrambled egg off the plate without getting any in her hair.&nbsp; She struggled to keep the hair out of her face as she ate, and I smiled at her misery as I started down on my eggs.&nbsp; I ate them quickly, wishing I had remembered to bring some salt.&nbsp; They were still bland.

As I finished my eggs I looked down at her again, watching as she tried to lick the last scraps off her plate.&nbsp; She looked at the bits of eggs in her hair out the corner of her eyes, probably trying to figure out what to do with them.&nbsp; As I walked over to her, she tried to look up at me.&nbsp; I bent forward and grabbed her plate off the ground.&nbsp; I stacked her plate under mind and walking back towards the door, set them on the desk.


"There we go, all done.&nbsp; Now to clean you up before the rest of today's entertainment." I said as I turned around.&nbsp; I began laughing as she shivered on the ground.&nbsp; I walked over to her and grabbed the rope in the center of her back.&nbsp; Using the rope, I hauled her to her feet.&nbsp; Then I began undoing the rope and tossing it in the corner.&nbsp; "Stay right there," I said as I walked over to the hoses.&nbsp; I grabbed the one to the warm water and turned it on.&nbsp; I walked back to Sue and went up to wet her hair.&nbsp; She braced for the shock as the water came closer to her, then gasped in surprise at the warm water.&nbsp; She looked back at me with an accusing glare as I continued to wet her hair.

I grabbed some shampoo out of a cabinet, and walked back to her.&nbsp; I handed it to her and said, "There, use this, and make it quick."&nbsp; She looked at the bottle for a second, and then opened the bottle and poured a bit of shampoo into her left hand.&nbsp; She ran it through her hair and began sudsing it up through her hair, being sure to get every last bit of it lathered in shampoo.&nbsp; As she was doing this, I stepped back with the hose and watched.&nbsp; Soon she was done and I went forward with the hose to rinse her hair off.&nbsp; The soap ran down her body and into the drain.&nbsp; Finally all the soap was gone, and I walked over to the wall to turn off the hose and coil it back in it's place.

I walked over to the stack of towels and tossed her one.&nbsp; "Dry off," I said.&nbsp; "I have something in store for you."&nbsp; She quickly dried off and threw the towel in the hamper like the night before.&nbsp; I pointed towards the gyno table.&nbsp; "Sit."

I walked over to the cupboards along one of the walls and began pulling supplies out from them.&nbsp; First I grabbed a large tray.&nbsp; Then I placed a couple boxes of needles on the tray, followed by a several 6-inch spinal taps.&nbsp; Next I found some sterile gauze and a bottle of surgical scrub, and placed them on the tray.&nbsp; Carrying the tray with me, I walked over to the gyno.&nbsp; "Hold this," I commanded, as I passed the tray to her.&nbsp; Her eyes were wide as she surveyed the contents of the tray.&nbsp; I walked out of the room to grab a small folding TV tray from upstairs, as well as a test; would she stay when she was given the chance run for freedom.&nbsp; I walked back into the room pleased to see she hadn't moved an inch.&nbsp; I set up the TV Tray next to the gyno table and grabbed the large tray from her, placing it on the TV tray.

"Now to get started," I said to myself.&nbsp; I grabbed some of the gauze from out of the packaging, and soaked it in surgical scrub.&nbsp; I began scrubbing her tits with the gauze, working my way out.&nbsp; I switched to a new piece of gauze and moved on to scrubbing her upper chest.&nbsp; I continued switching the gauze, and scrubbed other parts of her body.&nbsp; Her ribs were next, followed by her stomach.&nbsp; I worked my way down her thighs, and spread her legs to get high into her inner thighs.&nbsp; Then I moved onto her outer labia lips.&nbsp; Finally, with my last piece of gauze, I scrubbed her arms down.

I could tell she was getting worried.&nbsp; I gave her a smile.&nbsp; "It won't be so bad," I stated.&nbsp; "By the end you'll be flying high, trust me."&nbsp; I pulled out a sleeve of needles from the first box, and pulled out the first needle.&nbsp; I took a deep breath as I pulled the needle from the hub cap, and went towards her chest.&nbsp; I quickly stabbed it into her, high over where her pectoral muscle ran.&nbsp; She let out a little yelp and then began giggling as I pushed it out the other side.&nbsp; "See," I said redundantly, "not so bad, is it?"

I pulled the second needle from the hub cap, and decided to place it perpendicular to the one I just placed.&nbsp; I felt it scrape under the previous needle as I slid it through the skin, before poking it out on the other side.&nbsp; She giggled more as I poked the needle through her.&nbsp; Apparently I have found her giggle button.&nbsp; The next needle I bisected the angle between the previous two, and slid it under those needles.&nbsp; I stabbed through the same flesh, half a dozen more times, creating an endorphin button.

I moved to the other side of her chest and repeated the mirror image of the pattern.&nbsp; With every poke, she giggled again.&nbsp; She just couldn't stop giggling, and I didn't care enough to make her try and stop.&nbsp; After the pattern was replicated, I moved down to her breasts.&nbsp; Here I stabbed a dozen needles in her left breast, at random locations and angles.&nbsp; Keeping balance, I did the same to the right tit.&nbsp; I then took one of the spinal tap needles, and poked it through the center of her firm breast tissue.&nbsp; I skewered her tit again at a different angle, before moving back to the left tit and keeping the balance.&nbsp; I then grabbed some needles and stabbed them straight into her tits, 5 for each breast.

Half of the first box was already gone, as I moved down to her rib cage.&nbsp; I began creating a line needles down one side of her rib cage.&nbsp; I created a line of 25 needles parallel to each other leading down her ribs, and ending past her floating ribs and onto her stomach.&nbsp; I moved over to the other side and placed another 25 in the matching locations.&nbsp; Emptied, I tossed the first box to the side.&nbsp; Opening the second box, I started a pattern on her sternum.&nbsp; I used the needles to follow the curve of her breasts and made a curved V leading to the center of her sternum.&nbsp; A dozen needles later, I began to fill in the outline I created, until I had something that looked like a scalemail breastplate.

I moved down her sternum and worked another set following the outline of her floating ribs, using the line of needles down her ribs as a terminating line, and starting again following the curve below her breasts.&nbsp; Again I filled this outline in, making the appearance of a piece of armor.&nbsp; Her giggling, at this point, was becoming rasp.&nbsp; Apparently she had giggled her throat raw.&nbsp; I was almost done, having only about a dozen needles left in the final box.&nbsp; I laid her back on the gyno table, and spread her legs.&nbsp; I felt the soft flesh of her outer labia lips, and she purred at the unexpected gentle caress.&nbsp; Then, realizing what I had in mind, she tensed up.&nbsp; "Relax, it won't hurt any more than the rest of them.&nbsp; You'll love it," I said pulling out the first of the remaining needles.

I pulled out her left labia lip and stabbing from the inside, near the top, I pierced through it.&nbsp; I quickly followed with another to the right.&nbsp; With each needle she gasped a little before continuing her rasping giggle.&nbsp; I grabbed another needle and pushed another through about a quarter inch down from the first, following with one on the other side.&nbsp; I continued this using the remaining needles I had left, until the entire length of her labia lips were pierced, with the ends of the needles almost poking into the soft flesh where her thighs met her groin.

"Stay there," I said as I left the room.&nbsp; She shouldn't be interested in moving too far with the piercings in her labia ready to stab into her thighs if she should close her legs.&nbsp; I walked up stairs and pulled a camera I kept in the closet.&nbsp; It wasn't a bad camera, and took professional quality images.&nbsp; I checked the battery and the memory card before carrying it downstairs with me.

As I walked back into the room, I could here her rasping giggle, then a pause, then another giggle.&nbsp; The pattern continued as I walked into the room.&nbsp; I discovered her pushing on various needles, giggling, then pausing as she decided where to poke next.&nbsp; I definitely found the giggle button for this new slave of mine.&nbsp; I turned on the camera and began taking images of her playing with her piercings.&nbsp; After the first couple pictures she finally noticed me in the room.

"Lean back and let me take a few pictures," I said, as I took pictures of her needle-armor from several different angles.&nbsp; I took a close-up picture of her labia piercings, before taking several at different angles and settings.&nbsp; After this, I'd have some images of decent artistic quality to play with.&nbsp; The ends of the needles in her labia were already starting to stab into her thighs, and I could see dots of blood come up where they has pierced the skin.

"Alright, up you go," I said, putting pressure on the back of her shoulders.&nbsp; She slid off the gyno table and started to stand up straight before letting out a yip and spreading her legs in a half squat.&nbsp; "Alright, we're going to go upstairs and onto the pool deck.&nbsp; I hope you know how to grill." I said.&nbsp; I walked over to the cabinet and pulled out a large sharps container, then followed her slow waddle out of the room.

She moved slow and deliberately, attempting to keep the needles in her labia from stabbing too far into her inner thighs.&nbsp; Walking up the stairs was a special challenge for her, as she struggled against the pain in her thighs.&nbsp; Finally she made it to the top with a sigh, and waddled through the kitchen as I pointed towards a sliding glass door past the bar separating the kitchen from the living room.&nbsp; I stepped in front of her and opened up the sliding glass door.&nbsp; I set the sharps container on a half-wall separating the back porch from the pool deck, before turning to see her waddle through the door.&nbsp; "Stand out here," I said as I brushed by her to go back inside.&nbsp; I wasn't worried about her getting very far...at least not anywhere very fast.

It was mid-afternoon and I was getting hungry.&nbsp; I walked into the kitchen, preheated the oven to 450, and pulled a box of burgers out of the freezer.&nbsp; I grabbed a bottle of ketchup out of the fridge, and using the same hand grabbed a bag of hamburger buns off the counter.&nbsp; I walked outside and placed the items on a folding table next to a grill I had on the porch.&nbsp; I walked back inside and grabbed a bottle of pickles, and a head of iceberg lettuce out of the fridge.&nbsp; I walked outside and saw her legs were beginning to shake from the effort of holding herself up in&nbsp; such an awkward position.&nbsp; I&nbsp; placed these on the table before walking back inside, pulling out several plates, and setting them on the counter.&nbsp; I pulled a couple tomatoes from the vegetable drawer at the bottom of the fridge, and placed them on the top plate.&nbsp; Grabbing a knife, I sliced the tomatoes up.&nbsp; Pulling out a baking tray, I placed it on the stove, and sprayed it with cooking oil.&nbsp; I pulled a bag of steak fries out of the freezer and spread them over the baking tray.&nbsp; I placed the remainder of the fries in the freezer as I sprayed the fries with cooking oil and seasoned them.&nbsp; The oven beeped that it has finished preheating, and I placed the tray of fries in the oven and set the timer.&nbsp; I grabbed a grilling spatula from one of the kitchen drawers, picked up the plates with the tomatoes on top, and walked outside to place them on the table.

At this point, she was shaking so bad it could almost be called violently.&nbsp; I took pity on her.&nbsp; "Sit down there, next to the sharps container," I told her as I pointed to the red box I placed on the half-wall.&nbsp; I walked over and opened the sharps container.&nbsp; "Spread wide," I said, as I knelt before her.&nbsp; I slowly pulled each needle out, making sure to scrape it the whole way through, before tossing the needles in the sharps container.&nbsp; After the last needle was out, I closed the sharps container and stood up.

"Now you're going to cook us lunch," I directed.&nbsp; "Everything you need is on the table there.&nbsp; You can see the grill.&nbsp; Let me know when you're done," I said as I walked inside and sat down on the recliner just inside the sliding glass door.&nbsp; I turned on the flat screen in the living room, and began to watch some random game on TV while she went to work.

About 15 minutes later the fries were beeping in the oven.&nbsp; I got up to pull them out.&nbsp; I let them sit for a minute before scooping them up with a spatula and placing them on a plate.&nbsp; I was about to bring them outside when she poked her head in the door. "Sir," she said warily. "Right now the burgers are medium rare.&nbsp; I figured I should ask you how you'd like yours done."

"That'd be perfect," I said, and smiled.&nbsp; She took the initiative to ask my preference.&nbsp; It took her longer than I'd have liked, but she was probably worried from the rule I emphasized the night before; not to speak unless spoken to.&nbsp; I'd have to remember to tell her she may ask for clarifications and needed instructions that I leave out when issuing orders.&nbsp; I walked outside with the plate of fries and noticed she had a plate ready for me.&nbsp; On the plate was a bun, and on the bun was lettuce, tomatoes and a few pickles.&nbsp; She had her back to me as she placed a burger from the grill onto the bun.&nbsp; I smiled so she could see it when she turned around, and offered me my plate.&nbsp; I took my plate and kept smiling.&nbsp; She was doing good for being so new to her new life, taking the initiative where appropriate.

I moved my lettuce, tomatoes and pickle onto the burger, and picked up the bottle of ketchup.&nbsp; Popping the ketchup bottle open, I squeezed some out onto my burger.&nbsp; I set the bottle down and closed the second half of the bun onto my burger.&nbsp; I grabbed a handful of fries and placed them on my plate, then picked the bottle back up and squeezed some ketchup onto my plate.&nbsp; I sat down on a reclining lawn chair, and stretched out.&nbsp; I placed the plate on my chest and grabbed my burger.&nbsp; I took a large bite out of my burger and chewed it as I glanced up at Sue.

She was standing there, watching me and smiling.&nbsp; I quickly chewed my bite and swallowed.&nbsp; "You may eat whenever your burger is ready," I told her.

Her smile got bigger as she said, "Yes sir."&nbsp; She turned around and began preparing herself a plate.&nbsp; I looked back to my burger and took another large bite, before looking up to take a good look at Sue.&nbsp; She was still preparing her plate and was oblivious to my mental inspection.&nbsp; A few small drops of blood dried where they ran down her thighs...probably from the scraping I did to the needles as I pulled them out.&nbsp; Otherwise, she seemed to be functional enough.&nbsp; She hadn't passed out from the large number of needles in her, and she seemed a bit giddy.&nbsp; I was going to enjoy taking out the needles in a little bit.

She finished preparing her plate and turned to look at me.&nbsp; I swallowed the last of the bite I was working on and looking back at her, saying, "Sit.&nbsp; Eat."&nbsp; She walked over and sat on a lawn chair next to me.&nbsp; They were angled so we could see each other, but weren't looking directly at each other.&nbsp; I noticed she had turned the heat off on the grill, leaving two more burgers to simmer in the residue heat of the grill.

I continued to eat my meal, occasionally glancing over at Sue.&nbsp; Every time I looked, she was looking at me and smiling while eating her meal.&nbsp; She definitely had to be flying on something with those needles in her.&nbsp; I don't think she ever could have smiled that broadly before, and she definitely hadn't smiled this much for as long as I knew her (as short as that was).&nbsp; I think I found something I could use as a reward for her.&nbsp; She really seemed to enjoy the needle play.

I finished my burger and moved on to my fries.&nbsp; After we were done eating I planned on taking the needles out.&nbsp; Hopefully it didn't cause her to puke up her lunch.&nbsp; I imagined how I would take each and every needle out.&nbsp; How I'd twist them for the best effect as I slid them back through her skin.&nbsp; And before I knew it, I was done with my fries.

I felt full from the meal I ate, even though I'd normally have a second helping.&nbsp; As I waited for her to finish her meal, I decided we'd take a swim after the needles came out.&nbsp; I continued to plot at how I was going to remove the needles, and admiring the work I did on her.&nbsp; And before I knew it, she was done with her meal as well.&nbsp; I went to hand my plate over to her, and she took it without pause.&nbsp; She got up and began putting the meal away.&nbsp; She definitely had taking the initiative down, the anticipatory service, but she was missing steps.&nbsp; "Shouldn't you ask me if I wanted anything else first?" I asked.

She turned around and her face turned red with heat.&nbsp; She began stammering," I...Sir would...Sorry Sir...Like anything..."

"You're learning still.&nbsp; Don't worry about it this time, but learn from it," I said without further adding to her embarrassment.

"Thank you sir," she said and turned around meekly, finishing wrapping the meal up.&nbsp; She made several trips inside, and from the sound of it, was putting food away in the fridge and freezer.&nbsp; She brought a small plate out and scooped two remaining burgers onto it.&nbsp; As she made her last trip inside, I walked over to the sharps container and picked it up.&nbsp; I placed it on a table near the lawn chairs, and pulled the lawn chair she was sitting in closer to the one I was sitting in.&nbsp; I sat on the edge of that chair, leaning over the chair I was sitting in.&nbsp; As she came back out, I gestured to the chair and said, "Sit."

She walked over and sat on the chair.&nbsp; I pushed her back onto the chair and started with extracting the needles.&nbsp; Each needle I twisted or turned, causing it to scrape as it slid through her tender flesh.&nbsp; Doing this would maximize the pain each needle caused on the way out, and would increase the likelihood of bleeding and bruising.&nbsp; She wasn't giggling anymore.&nbsp; Each time I pulled a needle out, she would bite her lip and take a deep breath in.&nbsp; Blood began to pour out as I removed the needles.&nbsp; As I continued on, I began to worry she'd bite through her lip.&nbsp; Her gasps became sharper with each needle.&nbsp; After a few dozen, she begin to let out little whimpers, then whines, and finally she stopped biting her lip and let out moans with each needle.&nbsp; As I neared finishing, her whole torso was a mess of blood dripping down her body. 

After the last needle was out, I reached down between her leg and slipped my finger into her, wiggling it around.&nbsp; "And after all that, I think you deserve a reward.&nbsp; And, it looks like you're all ready for it," I said, registering how soaking wet she was.&nbsp; The needles must have really turned her on.&nbsp; Definitely something I could use as a reward in the future.&nbsp; "How about we go for a swim."

I stood up and waited for her to stand up.&nbsp; She seemed slightly unsteady on her feet for a second, but quickly gained her balance and walked towards the pool.&nbsp; "Go ahead, dive in!" I said.&nbsp; I waited so I could watch her young supple body in the water.&nbsp; She dove in and came up a short distance away from the edge, her red hair soaking flat against her head.&nbsp; The blood on her skin vanished as she entered the water.&nbsp; As she floated there I admired my new property.&nbsp; Young.&nbsp; Soft.&nbsp; Obvious masochistic tendencies.&nbsp; Smart.&nbsp; I had definitely caught something worth keeping, at least for awhile.

I jumped in with a cannon ball, splashing water up in her face.&nbsp; Doesn't hurt to have a little fun.&nbsp; I swam over to her and scooped her up in my arms as I stood on the bottom of the pool.&nbsp; She wrapped her legs around me.&nbsp; I began to kiss her, and she kissed me back.&nbsp; My hand ran it's way into her hair as I bit her lip, sucking it into my mouth so I could massage it with my tongue.&nbsp; She let out a moan of pleasure as she tried to bite my lip back.&nbsp; I began to get hard despite the chilly water, as I nibbled and bit my way down her neck.&nbsp; She purred in my ear as my nibbles ran their way down to her collar.&nbsp; Wish a quick thrust, I slid inside her.

She let out a slight gasp as I slid in her, apparently unprepared for it, but she quickly adapted.&nbsp; She began grinding down on my dick as I slowly thrusted in and out of her.&nbsp; I bent her neck to the side and bit hard on the side of her neck; she let out a groan of ecstasy.&nbsp; Holding onto her neck with my teeth, I ran my hands down her sides and onto her hips.&nbsp; I pushed down in time with my thrust, trying to get deeper and deeper into her tight young pussy.&nbsp; I let go with my teeth, taking deep breaths as I got closer to orgasm.

She went into loud moans and began rolling her hips rhythmically into my crotch.&nbsp; I responded by making every thrust harder.&nbsp; My tempo sped up as I got closer, until I was on the edge of cumming.&nbsp; She began pounding her hips onto might in a primal lust, and I responded my rolling my hips deep into her, and unloading deep into her cunt.&nbsp; Her pussy gripped tightly around my dick as I pulsed shot after shot of hot jism into her womb.&nbsp; She let out a deep moan and began to kiss me in earnest, rolling her hips gently, milking me for every last drop.

After holding each other for what seemed like a really long time, we slowly separated.&nbsp; After we recovered, we began to enjoy the water, swimming around, playfully splashing and toying with each other.&nbsp; After a good while, we got out and dried off.&nbsp; I let her sit at my feet as I went inside and watched TV for the evening.&nbsp; She sat patiently, with her head on my knee.&nbsp; Whenever I was ready for a drink, she was quick to get one for me, before returning to her spot at my feet.&nbsp; We ate leftovers for dinner, her sitting at my feet while I sat at the bar.

As we turned in for the night, I decided to reward her for her good service, and invited her into my bed.&nbsp; We fucked again before I finally grew tired and turned in for the night.&nbsp; Last thing I remembered was laying with her beside me. I slept soundly that night, with my girl in my arms.&nbsp;
