Chapter 1

&nbsp;

Josh sold his wife.

&nbsp;

He felt no remorse, or fear
of what he had done, just an excitement deep within him, of what would be done,
he would see, hear, smell and enjoy.

&nbsp;

Josh had dreamt of it for
years, to see his wife tortured, raped, begging, used.
Not because of any hatred for her, or of anything she had done, but simply
because of how erotic it would be, how beautiful she would be in the throes of
agony and humiliation.

&nbsp;

They of course had dabbled at
home, in the bedroom after a bottle or two of wine, some light bondage, a bit
of rough sex and role-play, but Helen had never been prepared to take it
further, out of the bedroom and into a reality.

&nbsp;

Josh had asked as he played,
explored her, fucked her, as she panted under him, or hung from the hook in the
bedroom, she would never say no, only perhaps, or maybe one day � but Josh knew
one day would never come willingly.

&nbsp;

So Josh resigned himself to
his dreams, and until recently had thought that was all it would ever be. He
acted it out in his mind during sex on a Saturday night, and talked about it
with strangers on the internet, but had never imagined it would possibly go
further. But now here he was � he had sold her.

&nbsp;

Sold her for what? Josh had
traded a few pictures of her on the internet, she was a good looking girl, 29,
blond, real strong personality, proud and independent, turned heads and knew
how to tease. Average height, 5�5 and about 55kg, gym toned with a good waist,
flat tummy, firm b cup breasts and good strong legs and ass, yes she certainly
turned heads and caught the eye.

&nbsp;

She caught their eye. They
first made contact via email, then one thing led to another and Josh ended up
having dinner with them, discussing her, them and what they did, and wanted to
do.

&nbsp;

They made films, hard, tough
films, mainly for the Asian market, though they were eastern European and spoke
with think accents. Helen was good material, just the sort of thing that sold
films in Asia. A white American girl with looks and attitude, the type many Asians
would like to spend a night playing with and punishing. Possibilities were
discussed, scenarios worked over and an opportunity suggested. 

&nbsp;

Helen and Josh would take a
sight seeing holiday in Poland. A
romantic week for their anniversary. They would be quietly filmed for a
couple of days as an introduction to the main events. Some drugs would then be
planted on Helen and the gang, posing as government officials would arrest her
as a drug trafficker. She was then to be questioned and ultimately interrogated
about information she must have and her contacts, although of course she had
nothing to tell, or anything to stop the torture. Helen would assume the whole
thing was real and believe Josh to also have been �arrested�. In reality Josh
would be able to watch and hear the whole thing through 2 way mirrors.

&nbsp;

The photos of where it was to
be done excited Josh. The gang had brought an abandoned facility which had,
until recently been used by the CIA for secretly entertaining Al Qaeda guests.
Exposure had resulted in them quickly moving on, and the facility was sold
fully equipped. It was isolated, and dug into the ground. Apart from the usual
offices and cells there were three main rooms for working on suspects. One was
used as an office, desk, chairs etc.. One resembled a
lecture room, where perhaps 50 tiered chairs ran down to a little stage in the
middle. The final one would be best described as a modified operating theatre.
White tiled floor and walls, a steel table with straps in the middle, steel
cabinets and chairs, interspaced with pulleys, chains, hooks and wires.

&nbsp;

So Helen was sold.

&nbsp;

It was hot in Krakow, the height of summer, the
temperature soaring to 35C by midday. Helen showed herself off
well. A variety of shorts and cropped t-shirts, little floral
summer dresses, tight jeans and of course a bikini by the hotel pool.
Josh was hard almost the entire time, knowing the camera was on her, close up
shots from a distance, examining her figure, her personality, the way her
clothes hung on her tight body, but he never saw it. At night in the city bars,
a couple of times Josh saw his contacts, sitting at a table close by, with 6,
sometimes 8 other guys, drinking, laughing, throwing Helen glances now and
again, talking quietly, only a whisper against the general noise of the bar. 

&nbsp;

They came for her on the
third day in the evening just as darkness closed in, 4 guys nicely dressed in
sharp suits emerging from two black cars which pulled up next to them as they
walked back to the hotel after an afternoon shopping. The road was quiet, a
one-way back street Josh and Helen had found as a short cut back to the Hotel.

&nbsp;

They came up quickly, 2
behind, 2 in front, 1 flashing an official looking id
card and explaining that they were government security. Bags were searched and
a several bags of powder were found in Helens handbag. Josh and Helen protested
as it was explained in thick broken English that they were being arrested and
would have to accompany the officers for investigation. Handcuffs were snapped
on and Helen was bundled into the back of the first car, and Josh into the
second, their shopping bags being thrown into the boot. Once moving the guy
sitting next to Josh removed his handcuffs explaining that Helen would not be
as lucky, but for the moment nothing further would happen to her as the hidden
camera in her car had stopped working on the way to collect her. As Josh was
going to find out, everything involving Helen was done in front of the cameras.

&nbsp;

The drive was not long, maybe
an hour and though nervous and excited Josh passed the time bu
discussing sports, food and Helen. All the time he had a fixed image in his
mind of her standing handcuffed in her white sneakers, denim shorts and grey
t-shirt as she protested her innocence and remained her calm composed self.

&nbsp;

He watched at a distance from
the car as Helen was led between 2 �officers� into the building. Building may
have been the wrong term, a bunker would be appropriate. They were in dense
woodland and in front of them was a large grassy mound with a well fitting
steel door carefully concealed in the side. Helen had apparently been told Josh
would be taken to a separate location for questioning, but that it was likely
he would shortly be released, as she was the one with the drugs, and from their
surveillance, clearly the only guilty person. It struck him how small she
appeared sandwiched between 2 big 6ft men, though well built and tough by her
gym training, she appeared very vulnerable in with her bare legs and arms
shining in the moonlight.

&nbsp;

Josh and his 2 accomplices followed
Helen into the bunker a couple of minutes later. A set of steps led down about
20 feet and a well lit concrete corridor led to an end where several doors led
off to other parts of the complex. Josh followed through one in the center
marked �observation�. The room was comfortably carpeted and decorated with a
fridge of beer in one corner and various comfy chairs arranged facing wall
mirrors which dominated the room on every side. One mirror appeared as window
to the office next door where Helen had been sat on a chair facing a desk, her
arms pulled back and handcuffed behind to the steel chair frame. The room was
otherwise empty of people. The observation room filled with perhaps 12 guys,
some taking seats to view the lit room next door, others collecting beers
before standing to talk. One explained to Josh that all rooms were arranged
around the observation room, and each could be seen through one of the 2 way
mirrors set in the walls, whilst sound was relayed over a loud speaker system.

&nbsp;

One by one the guys in the
room settled down to watch�

&nbsp;

Chapter 2

&nbsp;

Watching Helen sitting in the
chair was an experience in itself. Her arms were pulled tight behind her by the
cuffs, defining their toned shape as they strained. Her chest was lifted and
pushed out by her tight arms and her nervous panting, whilst a little of her
flat tummy could be glimpsed below her slightly too short t-shirt. The shorts
also did little to cover her modesty, framing her gym fit legs beautifully, and
allowing the odd glimpse of her sheer black string as she struggled to take in her
surroundings and situation, her movements could have been the start of some
erotic floor show � indeed, they were.

&nbsp;

After a few minutes of
enjoying the dancing of Helens body as she struggled in the chair, a door
opened, and one by one, five guys, all at least 6ft and suited and booted
slowly and deliberately entered. One took the seat behind the desk, and the
other 4, having pretended to turn on and arrange the already on video camera,
took up positions either side of Helen. 

&nbsp;

Questions and statements came
over the loud speakers in the observation room. The large bag of drugs was placed
on the desk, Helens voice, angry, confused, offering strained denials,
statements of having the wrong girl, threats of the embassy, demands for a
phone call, questions about Josh. The guys around Josh
were quiet, excited, watching intently as Helens arrogance and defiance in the
face of the situation became clear.

&nbsp;

Behind the desk the man
explained, patiently, calmly to Helen that she had been caught red handed. She
needed to co-operate, help herself by giving the information she had, to make
it easy on herself, but also to be clear, she was guilty, and that they would
have the information she had, however it was to be gained. Helen was denying
everything, calling them idiots, that she was the wrong girl, when the embassy
found out etc.. The man again explained, they were
licensed by the government, they had many extremely unpleasant options
available, but he did not want to ruin her, destroy her, such a pretty girl,
much better she talk now.

&nbsp;

Helen started offering more
forceful and angry denials and threats, her metal chair shaking as she replied,
her body putting on a real cute show. The attitude of the man behind the desk started
changing, growing firm forceful, but controlled. He told her she was a liar, an
enemy of the state, she would tell him what he needed to know, but first
she would be searched, for drugs and weapons, and then perhaps she would comply
with his demands. 

&nbsp;

Motioning, Helens cuffs were
undone and with hands on her shoulders Helen was made to stand. Immediately she
bolted for the door, desperately pulling at its handle, only to realize it was
locked, and turning back to the now smiling men in the middle of the room.

&nbsp;

The man from behind the desk
walked over to her, �I will give you one chance�, he
said, �remove your clothing!� Helen appeared to think for what seemed like an
eternity, offering her usual denials and threats, before suddenly spitting hard
in his face. The man turned, walking away, wiping the spittle from his now
reddening face. �That is going to cost you,� he almost whispered in his
controlled anger � and possible delight. Beckoning to two of the other men they
moved to Helen, dragging her from the corner she had retreated into and dragging
her to the middle of the room. With one guy on each arm they then forced her
wrists back up between her shoulder blades, almost lifting her off the floor,
and causing Helen to wince and scowl. 

&nbsp;

It can have been no
coincidence that Helen was being held at a 45 degree angle to the mirror and
the camera, offering both an excellent and unobstructed view to the event to
come. What a view, she could well have been on a rack, standing on tiptoe, her
body drawn taut and strained by her arms forced hard up her back. Her firm chest
pushed out and drawing the t-shirt even further up her stomach, a full 4 or 5
inches of flat toned tummy visible above her far too low cut tight shorts, and
finished off below with her straining smooth legs.

&nbsp;

The man moved in front of
her, smiling, looking, running his had down her side from her shoulder, past
her breasts, into the hourglass of her stomach and down her legs. �Shoes first�
he said. Helen winced again as he lifted first one, then the other leg off the
floor and removed her trainers, momentarily shifting all her weight onto her
arms. He made a show of examining her shoes inside and out, before placing them
behind him on the floor. Next he came forward to a point where his face was
almost touching Helens. His hands came up suddenly and grasped the neck of her
t-shirt, pulling violently once, twice and ripping it open from neck to waist.
Then something amazing happened, Helen spat hard in his face again! He turned
away, again wiping away the spittle, before calmly turning to her. �You will
pay for that in ways you can�t imagine, but not yet�� Producing a craft knife
from his pocket her proceeded to cut away the remains of Helens t-shirt as
Helen struggled in the firm grip of the aides. What a view.� Helens good shaped b cup breasts were
beautiful in the sheer black bra she was wearing, the shadow of her average
sized nipples clearly visible, and her flat tummy, taut and showing the shape
of her panting ribs.

&nbsp;

Moving down he unbuttoned her
shorts, slowly, before moving in with the knife to free them from her hips, and
placing them on the pile with her trainers and top. He stood back, ensuring all
had a good view of the struggling Helen in her bra and sheer black string,
motioning her captors to turn her round, ensuring a good view of her toned
back, and the string running up the cleft of her shaved, Latin ass, still firm
and pert, not yet sagging with age. Motioning again they faced her forwards and
we all craned to better see her flat tummy running down into her sheer panties,
and finishing in the clear shadow of her bare shaved slit.

&nbsp;

The bra came off next, the
knife slowly slid up between the cups, and then almost in slow motion the bra
fell away, her breasts swinging slightly from their containment, but remaining
high, pert and well shaped, smooth and inviting with their nipples erect and
pointing. Helen was now struggling and swearing like crazy, spitting,
threatening. The knife again went to work, first one side of her knickers, then
the other revealing her bare shaved pussy and the little pink slit, desperately
hidden as Helen tried, unsuccessfully to cross her legs, finding that they had
to remain apart to take the weight off her arms.

&nbsp;

His hands ran over her body,
exploring her firm shape, cupping her breasts, moving to and gently rubbing her
pussy, commenting on how strong she was, and how sensitive. Helen was turning
her head away, closing her eyes, shaking with the fury and embarrassment she
surely felt.

&nbsp;

Turning back to him she
screamed �see, I am hiding nothing!� �But we haven�t finished checking you
yet�, he replied calmly. Motioning to the four men, he told them to put Helen
on the desk. Josh watched as swiftly the 4 men each grabbed one of Helens legs
and arms, and carried his naked wife struggling, screaming and kicking over to
the desk. They dumped her hard on her back, momentarily knocking the breath
from her. The two on her arms pulled them back and down tight, the two on her
legs struggled to hold her taut and still, spreading her legs about 4 foot
apart, and pulling her legs about a foot down below the desktop. The effect was
to display a stretched and naked Helen for all to see, breasts and stomach
heaving and sexy on the desk, head rising to see, and bare cunt slightly opened
by her spread legs. 

&nbsp;

Every man in the observation
room was quietly commenting about what they would do to her when it was their
turn, and how they planned take their �pound of
flesh�. The man moved between Helens legs, stroking his hands over her body,
enjoying every curve as she struggled against her captors, deeply enjoying the curved
straining of her body. �Now� he said, �let�s see if you have anything in your
pussy Helen�. Placing his large dry hand at the opening to her slit he began to
slowly work his hand in. 

&nbsp;

It was quite a show. Josh was
impressed, he knew his wife was tough, but not once did she scream, she bit her
lip, banged her head hard on the desk, contorted her already tight body,
glistened with sweat, but not once would she scream. After about 10 minutes the mans hand was buried past the knuckles, but it took
another 15 to get it in to the wrist. Her pussy eventually gave suddenly and
his hand disappeared to the wrist. Josh thought that the desk would collapse
with the violence of her writhing at that point, but still Helen remained
silent. As the man felt about inside her, dragging his nails across her
sensitive membranes, stretching her hard, and seeing the distortion of her flat
tummy, the man smiled at her, �you are tough, but if you don�t talk, this could
be a very bad night for you Helen�.
