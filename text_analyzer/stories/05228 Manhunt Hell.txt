BASED ON THE COMPUTER GAME
MANHUNT

&nbsp;

Chapter 1 � The Beginning.

&nbsp;

Gary Schaffer is on the warpath
for James Earl Cash after the untimely death of Starkweather and launches a
plot to capture him. 

Eventually, after
scouring the planet for Cash, Schaffer finds his man and immediately sets an
elaborate trap, which involves hiring a gang of Cerberuses to capture him. Cash
is boarded upon a torture jet and a flight takes him to a secret location,
which we later discover is a high-tech prison on a remote island, but its exact
whereabouts are unknown. 

The sadistic guards
incarcerate Cash in a 3m x 3m sized pit in the ground with an iron grille
sealing the roof. This becomes Cash�s personal bondage for the next 10 months;
his only visits are by the disgusting leering guards and Mr Gary Schaffer
himself! They only take him out of the pit to torture him, before throwing him
back in the sadistic cramped hole. All the while Schaffer�s cameras are rolling
and the barbaric activities at the secret prison are filmed for a special
clientele. 

During the 10 months in
prison, Cash is mentally and physically tortured beyond belief, Schaffer stands
looking down through the thick iron bars of the pit, sadistically smiling at
Cash and promises him the slowest most agonising death possible. Time passes,
weary and cramp-ridden Cash sees a group of cops approaching his cage, where
they immediately pull him out and begin to strip him completely naked. The
guards drag him forcefully over to what looks like a bath of water, Cash panics
and tries to wriggle free, but he is easily overpowered as the cops begin to
fasten straps harshly in between all the creases of his body, they then apply
Japanese rope bondage to ensure escape is impossible. Cash begins to feel
himself being hoisted upwards over the tank of water by a rope-pulley system. 

Shaffer appears and
begins to explain that Cash is ready to die in a live snuff movie right now, a
death by slow drowning! Cash starts to panic, but the thick ropes keep his
limbs tightly restricted, like an Anaconda constricting a deer. The situation
forces Cash to try and scream, plead and beg for his freedom, but the rubber
ball gag is tight and harsh around his mouth as the thick leather straps
partially hide a terrified face. 

There is very little resistance
as Cash is completely submerged for the first time under the murky piss and
shit contaminated water. For a starter, Schaffer keeps Cash down in the depths
of the viscous liquid for five seconds, whilst natural instinct forces Cash to
hold his breath under water and close his eyes tightly shut. It feels like a
long five seconds and then suddenly� there is relief as he is raised back above
the surface. 

�Did you enjoy yourself
Cash, *Schaffer laugh�s sadistically* 

Cash attempts to plead
for release, but only muffled sounds are heard through the gag. 

�Too bad, back down you
go�. 

This time there is fight
in Cash as he begins to be dunked again, but his escape efforts are short lived
and hopeless as he disappears back beneath the surface. This time Schaffer
increases the count to ten seconds, confident that the slow sadistic nature of
the drowning would satisfy his clients. Although there was a twist, Schaffer
felt as though he could still get some more kicks out of Cash yet and he never
intended to drown him, just toy with him, break him and let him know that at
any point he wanted, he could extinguish Cash�s life like the flame of a candle
and sell that very death to a 1000 people on tape, ready for them to relive
that moment for sexual pleasure. 

Cash was dunked a third
time for 15 seconds and finally a fourth time for 20 seconds before finally a
broken soaking wet body was hoisted up out of the filthy water, a helpless
dripping piece of meat just hanging like a pig at a slaughterhouse. 

�You live to fight
another day Cash� taunted a smirking Schaffer. 

There was barely a
response from Cash, yet he remained defiant as his tired weary fingers
attempted to untie the ropes looped around his wrists, his arms bound awkwardly
behind his back. 

�If I as much as see you
attempting the slightest escape, I will cut ya slimy little faggot fingers off
one-by-one boy and feed them to you.� 

�Get his fuckin� arse
back in that cage Salinas, we�ll break him tomorrow.� �Yeah, Salinas here will
introduce you to his bullwhip, he aint forgot what you did to his brother
Ramirez�. 

THE VERY NEXT DAY 

A whooshing whip sound
was heard, Cash was naked and tied spread-eagled upside down. Salinas delivered
another punishing lash on his back with the bullwhip. �I�m really going to make
you pay for what you did to Ramirez, no a simple bullet in the head will not
suffice, I�m going to chop you up into little small squares and feed you to my
dog�. 

Cash lets out an
anguished scream as the sadistic Wardog member whips his back again and again
and again. Schaffer�s laughs are stifling James� agony, sweat and blood
dripping freely down Cash�s pain-wracked back. 

Schaffer sadistically
locks Cash back in his inhuman cage and begins to unzip his pants. He reaches
inside and pulls out his dick, he holds it in place and suddenly begins to piss
inside the cage all over Cash. Cash tries to move to avoid being covered in
piss, but there is absolutely no room to manoeuvre inside the pit. 

Schaffer was a complete
sadist, ever since his youth working as a prison guard; he was utterly amazed
at how easy it was to become a cop. He was the everyday civilian�s worst
nightmare, as he would think nothing of planting drugs on innocent people or
beating teenagers up on the street. As well as sadistic, Shaffer was extremely
narcissistic and domineering and there was one incident late at night when he
was questioning yet another innocent victim. Schaffer saw it was quiet and
there was nobody around, he used that moment to shock his poor victim with a
stun gun tazer. His temporarily paralysed victim was then dragged into a dark
back alleyway and raped by Schaffer. To add to the poor man�s woes, Schaffer
also planted a lot of Class A drugs in his car. The humiliated and violated man
was then falsely jailed for 10 years. 

In jail, the man �
Kenneth Jesperson was reduced to complete and utter sexual slavery and mental
manipulation at the whim of Schaffer and would later be blackmailed to join the
Smiley�s. 

Gary Schaffer was a
closet homosexual and he loved the control he had over his powerless
incarcerated prisoners, he loved locking them inside solitary confinement for
weeks just because he could, but it was just too simple. Schaffer craved
something more, he had a desire burning up inside of him, the pleasures of the
flesh, and it was something he was introduced to when he was only 20 years old.
He was a very good friend of a man named Lionel Starkweather and one night in
the safety of Lionel�s guarded mansion, he allowed Schaffer to witness a snuff
scene. A small Perspex box was brought into Starkweather�s living room along
with a young man, who looked no older than 22 years old. Five heavily armed
Cerberuses harshly outnumbered the averagely built young man; they easily
forced him inside the cramped Perspex box and padlocked it shut. 

�Would you like a drink
young man, whilst we watch the show?� said a relaxed Starkweather. 

�Erm,
yeah sure sir, thank you� replied a nervous Schaffer. He was usually supremely
confident, but he was in complete awe of Starkweather. 

Starkweather ordered one
of his house servants to pour two glasses of wine. He then stood up and walked
over to a wooden table containing his CD player. Starkweather turned on the
power and slightly lowered the volume dial, so that the music would not be too
loud and neither too quiet for the videotape to pick up. Suddenly a gentle song
began to play, very calm and eerie, yet beautifully composed. 

The haunting classical
music of Samuel Barber�s - Adagio For Strings began to play. Strangely it was
counting downwards from 9 minutes and 59 seconds, which was the length of the
piece. Was Lionel attempting to synchronise the time it would take the song to
finish with the time it would take to kill this man? 

Starkweather gave the
thumb to start filming and said, �so it begins, 3� 2� 1� and ACTION!� the
cameraman positioned the camera towards the encased man in the Perspex box.
Starkweather walked towards the box. �Are you ready to witness real power over
life and death Gary?� 

�Erm
yes sir�, Schaffer�s stomach was knotted with fear but also partially with
excitement. 

Starkweather turned a
dial on the Perspex box clockwise from the 9:00 position to the 12:00 position.
This increased the temperature inside the box from average to slightly warm. Starkweather
went and sat down very close to Schaffer, putting an arm around his shoulder. 

�Don�t worry boy, relax,
soon you will experience an adrenaline rush like no other, I promise you that
for certain� said a confident Starkweather. 

Schaffer watched the box
carefully, he noticed that the sides were starting to become moist and steamy,
suddenly there was real movement! The man trapped inside began to kick and
punch on the walls of the box, frantically searching for a way out, screams
were now audible, but very muted, perfect for the camera to capture his pleas
and cries. Although it was a claustrophobic box, there were three small,
circular special purpose holes cut into the side. The holes were big enough to
fit a hand and wrist through, or a nostril, which was enough to tease the
victim into thinking escape, was possible. 3 minutes had expired. 

�Time to turn the heat
up� laughed Starkweather as he again inched the dial clockwise from a 12:00
position to a 3:00 position. The temperature was now peaking towards hot. 

�This is where the fun
really begins Gary� said an aroused and excited Starkweather. 

A servant brought a
microphone and placed it down in front of Starkweather. He spoke into it
clearly: 

�Are ya thirsty boy,
Lionel�s voice was loud and clear inside the Perspex box�. �Must be rigged,�
thought Schaffer. �Do exactly as I say and I promise you this will be over
before the night is out�. 

�Place your head against
the side of the box and put your tongue through the small circular hole provided�.
The man began to follow Starkweather�s instructions; a flat tongue pathetically
appeared through the hole, waiting to be fed like a dog. Starkweather took a
glass of water and held it around 3 inches out of reach from the tongue. 

�I can�t reach it,
please let me drink I�m so dehydrated!� begged the young captive. 

Starkweather tutted,
�no, no, no� you�re going to have to work for it. I want you to stretch that
tongue further out�. 

The sight of the tongue
stretching and straining to reach the water, but ultimately failing turned on
Starkweather; again it was the control factor. He then moved the glass so that
the tongue �could� reach it, Starkweather sneering as the tongue began to lap
up the water from the glass like a dog. 

�Starkweather tutted
again, �no, no, no� that�s enough water for you, time to die my little Robin�.
He then pulled a small handle on the side of the Perspex box and suddenly the
three circular holes were blocked systematically by more Perspex, closing like
a pair of blinds. The victim now realising this, began to slam furiously on the
side of the box with all his strength. 

Starkweather positioned
his face close to the glass directly facing his tortured victim. �Now its time
to bake the cake� and he ruthlessly turned the dial clockwise from the 3:00
position to the 6:00 position, raising the temperature to roasting hot. Almost
immediately sweat was dripping down the inside walls of the box as the poor man
tried everything to escape from the almost airtight sauna. Feet were kicking
the walls; fingers were hopelessly slipping down the wall making a muted
squeaking sound. Helpless fingernails were trying to claw their way through the
8 inch thick solid Perspex. More minutes passed and slowly but surely, the
young man�s struggles began to get weaker and weaker as he was being boiled and
dehydrated alive, heat exhaustion would soon set in and his escape hopes were
fading fast. His screams soon began to turn to hopeless tears as he began to
beg for his Mum to save him: 

Groans of suffering
could be heard through the box, �please help me! Mummy, help me! I love you
Mum�, crying hysterically, he had given up all hope and that was it, the
struggles eventually turned into death throe spasms and then those pathetic
spasms extinguished like the flame of a candle. In the background, the haunting
music of Samuel Barber was nearing it end. The camera continued to film the box
just to confirm the death, there was no movement at all now. The film finished,
just as the music finished. The masterpiece was complete. 

It was clear that
Schaffer was aroused, he was fascinated and it seemed as though in this one
evening, he had completely desensitised himself completely to the killing and
violence. He was no stranger to a bit of sadism, but this had taken him over
the edge and he wanted to be a part of it. 

�The good thing about
snuff is that all the victims can be real actors�, Lionel said philosophically.


Both Schaffer and
Starkweather held a pause and then immediately broke into laughter at the cruel
joke. They were bonding, there was a feeling that Starkweather was grooming
Schaffer to inherit his empire and he was such a young student who seemed keen
on making his mark. They were dangerous together and they enjoyed good moments
together, until that one fateful night when Cash had done the impossible and
survived against an illegal army involved in snuff. Cash had stormed
Starkweather�s so-called �impenetrable� mansion and adrenaline and revenge were
the motives Cash had used to beat the odds, especially after the ordeal that
Starkweather had put him through. When Starkweather was murdered, Gary Schaffer
became extremely depressed and turned to drink to see him through the dark
times, he forgot about snuff for a little while and although his mind was all
over the place, he swore vengeance on James Cash. While Schaffer and
Starkweather were watching the Perspex box murder, Lionel talked about an
empire and revealed he had funded a hell on Earth encampment on a privatised
island. Lionel told Schaffer in confidence that if he ever died, he would
inherit it.

&nbsp;

Chapter 2 � The Island.

Location: Unknown. 

A long time ago,
Starkweather started to write a highly detailed manual. This manual contained
the entire blueprints for the island, such as its shape, its contents and
particularly its whereabouts. 

Starkweather had
stressed that the �location� of this island was the most important aspect. He
wanted somewhere where the weather predictability was safe, yet at the same
time had the potential to be very harsh and cruel. He didn�t want Earthquakes
or Tsunami�s damaging or completely flooding the island, yet he wanted heavy
rain to occur quite often. 

Lionel also wanted to
make sure that the island was isolated and uninhabited, although he didn�t mind
if there were small clusters of people living here, that way he could send his
Cerberus unit to move in and mop them up, they would definitely make good
slaves, there would definitely be some particular use for their services and if
not, they would be slaughtered and dumped in the ocean. 

Starkweather needed a
lot of men to help build his vision and make his wildest fantasy a reality. He
hired already corrupt workers, such as those who created the American Gulag
concentration camps and all the secret jail complexes in other countries.
Starkweather wanted a lot of construction work carrying out underground as well
as on the island surface. He wanted safety bunkers, a high-tech
maximum-security prison, surveillance and communications base, a transportation
and deportation base as well as other important facility buildings. He had also
outlined that these bases and facility buildings were absolutely impossible to
get near or break into by the prisoners. All this would be in place before he
even considered what would be constructed at the heart of the island, where the
Manhunts would be carried out. For Starkweather, once all the security aspects
were covered, he could start laying the decorations, such as the arenas and
traps. He had taken great precaution to set this up and he was absolutely
adamant it wasn�t going to blow up in his face. 

Specifically chosen
victims are taken by force to this island, where they are immediately detained
and constantly kept in a disorientated state to heighten their fear and weaken
their mentality. During this period, they are also broken down physically, with
Chinese torture methods favoured by the ruthless prison guards. Once the
prisoners are broken, they are flown by helicopter and released at another
point on the island. The prey are completely stripped of clothes and items and
given a good opportunity to try and mastermind an escape. Of course, the
prisoners are unaware they are trapped on an isolated island and there is a
very remote chance of escape. Boats/ships are prohibited from travelling to and
from the island. A radar system is used to track helicopters, which travel to
and from the island. This radar system is installed within an underground
prison. Surveillance cameras are installed around the entire border of the
island, ensuring that if the prey reaches this border, they can be tracked
immediately and re-captured. Of course, this island was different to anything
elsewhere on the planet, this was a professional crime organisation which
specialised in human trafficking and because of the dedication of the people
involved and the money they had invested, mistakes would never happen and
nothing could possibly go wrong. This meant that slaves would never escape, no
matter how ingenious their escape attempts were. Everything was painstakingly
mapped and monitored, and you can bet your life if you ended up a prisoner
here, it would be the final place you ever visited on Earth. 

The organisation itself
specialised in more than just snuff, they also made money from selling young men
and women to rich Count and Countesses all over the world to be kept as sex
slaves in private mansions. It was amazing what money could buy; you could
purchase a young male or female for �25,000 and do whatever you wanted to them.
Whether that be keep them holed in your basement forever, or have them killed
slowly for your sexual gratification. There was no limit on how cruel the human
race was; fortunately the majority of the public are kept unaware and
misinformed. Many dictators in harsh countries are also believed to have kept
prisoners as torture slaves for their own amusement. Former Iraqi dictator
Saddam Hussein is believed to have been caught on camera having the soles of
his feet licked clean by two Western prisoners, one an English male, the other
a Canadian female. Afterwards, both of these prisoners were beheaded on camera
and sold on DVD�s in the local markets. Iraqi people lusted after torture
videos, especially those with English or American victims in them. Countries
deemed friendly and safe were also torture havens, such as Sweden, Norway,
Belgium, France and Slovakia. 

The island is completely
surrounded by North Atlantic water. A very unpredictable ocean filled with
sharks and killer whales as well as the remains of thousands of people, killed
in the most dangerous blood sport on Earth. There is equipment on the island,
which is used to measure the possibility of an Earthquake or Tsunami occurring.
There are plans to build a reinforced steel dome around the entire island to
avoid a flood.
