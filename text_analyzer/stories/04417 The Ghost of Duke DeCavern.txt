����������� Katie sat
there in the eerie silence of the room to recollect everything that had just
happened. Ever since she moved into her new house, she had been very aware and
cautious of everything around her. Now she didn't know what to be aware of. She
heard all of the stories about her place being haunted, but she never really
paid attention to them. Mostly because she never really
believed in ghosts. Until now.

&nbsp;

����������� Katie� was a fairly
pretty girl. She had long dark hair, that curled at
the end. She had an OK figure, not too skinny, but she had a nice curvy body.
Her breasts were an OK size, a 34C to be exact. Her big blue eyes were probably
her best feature. She had no trouble getting boyfriends, but right now she
decided she wanted to be single. So, she was living alone.

����������� The first
few days in her house were alright. She moved all of her furniture in, replaced
all the lightbulbs, and dusted and vaccumed. It was exactly the third day that things started
happening. She was all settled in reading her book in her nice cumfy red chair. It was late in
the afternoon, so it was getting dark outside. It had been fairly nice out that
day, so there wasn't that much wind. It all started out when she thought she
heard footsteps right above her. The room that was positioned right above her
was her bedroom. She ignored it, thinking it was probably just the old house
creaking. She was mid-page in her book when all of the sudden the lights went
out. Confused and curious, she went into the next room which was her kitchen,
and turned on the switch. The lights came on. So, she went back into the living
room and sunk herself into her chair then turned to switch the lamp on. It
didn't work.&quot;Hmmph,&quot;she said to herself,&quot;there must be a short circuit
somewhere.&quot; Instead of searching the house, she decided she was tired and
headed up to bed.

����������� When she
got up there, she was surprised to see that all of her blankets had been thrown
off the bed. She remembered making it that morning, but she shrugged it off
anyways, thinking she could have made a mistake. So, she went to her closet,
took out a nightgown, undressed, and went to the mirror. As she stood in front
of the mirror studying her naked body, she had a terrible feeling that someone
was watching her. Even though she thought her thoughts as silly, she quickly
got dressed and got into bed. She layed
awake for almost an hour, just listening to the sounds of the house.
Once again, she thought she heard sounds of footsteps. This time they were in
her room. Finally, she fell into a light sleep. 

����������� She woke to
the sound of her chattering teeth, to find that all her blankets had been
thrown off the bed again. She sat up and rubbed the sleep out of her eyes. The
clock told her it was only 12:14.
She had only been sleeping for a few hours. She got up, picked up her blankets
and layed back down to sleep for the rest of the
night.

&nbsp;

����������� 

����������� The next
morning, Katie decided to go for a walk to the nearby library. She still didn't
really believe in ghosts, but she wanted to do some research on the history of
the house. She walked in and went to the desk where a small,
skinny, almost unhealthy looking women sat across from her. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Excuse me, miss?&quot; said Katie.

Nothing.

&quot;Miss?&quot;

The women stared at her with sickly eyes, not speaking a
word to her. Finally, after several attempts to get her attention, the women
said in a quiet voice, &quot;You're the young lady that has moved into the old DeCavern's house, aren't you?&quot;

&quot;Yes, actually, that's why I'm here.&quot; Katie
answered. &quot;I was wondering if you had any books on the history of that
house.&quot;

&quot;Yes,&quot; the women said, &quot;
go down to the back and look for section 'D', and you should find one called
Duke DeCavern.He was the owner of the house.&quot;

&quot;Thanks.&quot;

As she turned to walk away, the lady whispered, &quot;Have
mercy on her Lord....&quot;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

����������� After signing the book out, she walked back home. She poured
herself a cold glass of lemonade and then sat herself down in her chair. She
opened the book and started reading. Page by page, she learned more and more
about Mr. DeCavern. She had discovered he was a very
powerful and wealthy man. The one startling discovery she learned was that he
was a very sadistic man too. He married many times, but always found younger
women to seduce. But, once he seduced them, he would keep them in his home as
his slave. One of his wives even joined him in his sadistic ways. But, unfortunatly, people found out about what he was doing, and
no women would go after him anymore. So, he started raping them. He would bring
them back and cage them or chain them to the bed and rape them day after day
until they just ended up dying of starvation. His wife divorced him, and, apart
from the women he brought home to rape, he became very lonely. One night, he
brought home a young women in her early 20's, and tore
her clothes off in order to rape her. But, before he could, she pulled a knife
out of her pile of clothes beside her, and stabbed him to death. People say his
angry spirit still lurkes around the house, waiting for a women to come so he can have his way with her and get
revenge. Katie stopped reading and shook her head. &quot;Of course, none of
that can be true,&quot; she said to herself, &quot;It's all just a legend.
There are no such things as ghosts.&quot; With that, she got up to carry on
with the rest of her day.

&nbsp;

����������� She came
home late that night, and headed straight for bed. When she got up there, her
bed was still as neat and tidy from the way she left that morning. She got into
her nightgown and slipped under the covers. It was nearly 2 in the morning when
she awoke to the sound of her teeth chattering again. This time, not only were
her blankets thrown off of her, but her nightgown was gone too. She layed in her bed completely naked.
When she finally became aware of this, she opened her eyes wide and became
frightened. She started to get up but realized something was holding her down.
&quot;What the hell!&quot; she screamed. Then, she felt something heavy on top
of her. Her legs were suddenly ripped open, leaving her vulnerable to anything.
She was crying loud when she felt something on her face, and then her screams
were muffled by the invisible force. She could feel the hardness pressing
against her and then she felt it slip inside her. She screamed. She tried with
all of her strength to push whatever it was off of her, but it was no use. It
was like nothing was there. This cant be happening,
she thought, I must be dreaming, there are no such things as ghosts! But, as
much as she tried to convince herself, it was happening. The ghost of Duke DeCavern was raping her. Finally, after what had seemed
like hours, the abuse stopped. She just layed there, crying softly to herself, not knowing what to do. She was
too afraid to move. Eventually she sat up in her bed, still shaking from the
horrifying events. She got up and put her nightgown back on. Then, she sat back
on her bed to think about everything that just happened. She fell asleep with
all the lights on. When she woke up that morning, she wondered if the things
that had happened to her were actually real or just a dream she thought up in
her mind from reading all those stories. She arose to face another day unaware
of how bad it was going to be.
