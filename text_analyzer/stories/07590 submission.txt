Synopsis: 








Her sun-bleached hair blew wildly in the breeze, floating across her face, masking the expression of mixed emotion. Complete and utter joy at being able to walk freely along the broken sea defences, yet devastation at being alone, no one to turn to in time of need or danger.

She lifted her face to the setting sun and bathed in its glory, feeling the warmth of its rays upon her face, feeling her skin glow in its light, she adored the sun. Her bronzed skin contrasted stunningly against the pale gown of flimsy silk held together with a thin stretch of lace. The cut of the gown accentuating her long legs and her thin waist, she truly was beautiful.

Moving just inches in order that he might get a view from a fresh angle and still remain out of sight, Hen adjusted his position, in doing so he managed to glimpse a flash of her breast that showed through the tear in her gown. His excitement grew as her watched her, silently she stretched upwards unknowingly revealing more of her flesh, he stared at her shapely curves, enthralled by the lines her body formed as she lifted her arms high above her head, clasping her hands together, stretching and arching her back. The movement thrust her breasts forward and he gasped at the innocence of the movement and the intensity of his own bodies' reaction.

Her gown raised a couple of inches revealing just how shapely her thighs were, almost showing the cleft of her buttocks but not quite. Hen strained hoping that he might see the beauty that was still kept from him. She lowered her arms and began to walk slowly along the sea wall, barefoot she balanced herself using her arms to assist her when necessary, eagerly looking out to sea as if waiting for someone to come over the horizon.

He felt his need, and knew he would take her. The decision would not be one she would make. Women did not speak... it was not becoming. Alternative methods were used to communicate their needs. He began to imagine how she would express her need to him, how she would look up at him lustfully, begging with her eyes for him to take her, fulfil her. Swiftly, silently he leapt from his hiding place, with giant strides he covered the space between them, crossing the rocks that had previously tumbled from the wall, he grasped her arm, She screamed, fear and bewilderment together in one sound.

Spinning her to face him, He realised just how truly stunning she was. She lowered her eyes, realising that her scream would already have caused displeasure, hoping that he would accept that it was purely the abruptness of his approached that had made her break the silence. His other hand, fingers entwined in the sun-kissed waves, grasped her hair, gently but firmly pulling her head back until her lips were facing upwards, lush full and available for him to kiss. They parted fractionally allowing him to see the warm softness of her inner cheeks. He bent forward slightly and placed his lips upon hers, his tongue gently pushing forward parting her lips a little more. He kissed her gently for a long time, feeling her body fade from the frigidness that he his first touch had encountered, ebbing and giving way to a relax state, slowly she was melting in his arms. His fingers wrapped between the locks of her hair, he manoeuvred her body into a more pleasing position, and willingly she moulded herself to him. He released his grip on her arm and moved his hand. His palm lay across her left buttock his finger tips just touching the rim of her cheek, tracing the line between her upper thigh and the moons of her bottom, he felt her squirm obviously enjoying his touch, obviously finding this particular area erogenous.


She was in raptures, his fingertips tracing the line of her cheek and occasionally glancing across the edge of her inner thigh. She felt the moisture of her excitement and noticed her breathing changing slightly, she felt a warmth wash over her. Her nipples began to tingle and harden; his lips were still firmly planted upon her own, his tongue gently teasing her, flicking along the outer rim of her bottom lip. She adjusted her body, pressing her hips forward slightly so her pubis nudged gently against his manhood. She felt its hardness and was pleased. She wanted to show him how pleased she was, lifting her leg slightly she rubbed the inside of her thigh across his knee, he responded by kissing her harder. 

Suddenly he turned her round, using her hair to pull her back onto him, leaning her head against his shoulder he gently nipped her neck. His hand traced once more across the crevice and then over her thigh, gently inching its way towards the front of her. Lifting the edge of her gown his hand traced the line of her hip bone and across the front of her thighs, just when she thought it would near her mound of pleasure it began to sweep upwards, tracing a line up her stomach and towards her right breast. Her breathing quicken as she felt her excitement grow, the dampness between her legs now more evident and her desire to be taken stronger. His fingertips rounded her breast, in ever decreasing circles until they touched her erect buds. At the same time as he bit hard into her shoulder he gripped her nipples between his finger and thumb sending feelings of immense please and pain shooting through her body at the same time. How can this be... she wondered, that such a pain can be so pleasurable? 

Her knees weakened and she began to slump in his arms, he held her tight refusing to let her go. She felt his member pressing firmly in the base of her spine. She could feel it twitch in reaction to her own body movements. She wanted to cry out and beg him to allow her to please him, but years of teaching and training made her keep her silence, she had been taught how to express herself with actions. 

He felt confidant that she would not run if her released her, he wanted to feel her nakedness with both hands, wanted to explore every chasm of her being. Slowly her released her hair from his grip, ready to re-apply the hold should it be necessary. With his left hand he gently lifted her gown eased his hand beneath and traced the line of her bejewelled belly button. The intensity of his touch was astounding; she was weak in his arms ready to give her completely to him at his command. Strangely he had not uttered a sound, she found this unusual but captivating. 
With one hand now tracing her right nipple and the other making its way sensually towards her left, she felt him nip her neck again tracing along the line of her shoulder, without warning and in unison he bit down again tweaking both her nipples hard. She gasped... Never before had she felt such pleasure. 

She eased her right hand between them, sliding it between their bodies, his clothes only loosely covered him, his leather belt tied tight at the waste posed no problem to her expert hands, she glided her fingers up the inside leg of his shorts. Her finger just reached the base of his masculinity. She moved it gently to one side, probing with a slender hand to make sure it was still in a comfortable position. She managed to arrange his member in such a way that she could almost stroke along its full length, she eased her body away from his a touch, in order that she might reach him more easily. Using the nail of her index finger she quite firmly traced a line along the full length of his tool, feeling it buck beneath her touch she knew it was giving him immense pleasure. She heard him, she felt him, she knew he would soon want more. Her fingertip rounded the end of his 
engorged penis and felt the wetness of his excitement. She smeared it across its head and then traced her fingernail along the underside too. Clasping his balls in her hand she leant backwards, silently begging him to tease her nipples again. He needed no encouragement, with both finger and thumb of each hand ideally placed he repeated the action of moments ago that had caused such a response before. 

In one swift movement he turned her once more to face him, she looked longingly into his eyes, sultry, breathless, yearning, lips apart, inviting him to take her, inviting him to allow her to use her womanly ways to pleasure him. He once more wrapped his fingers in her hair, twisting hard to claim a firm grip, using this grip he lowered her to her knees. The rocks upon which she now knelt cut into her knees but she felt nothing, the sea spray from the incoming tide splashed over her speckling her flesh with spots of salty water. He allowed her the privilege of looking at him, seeing it in all its magnificent glory. She could see how swollen it was; she could see it throbbing with the force of its engorgement. He held her about two inches away, using her hair as his means of control; he was able to torment her at will. 

She reached forward with her hands to touch him. To stroke him. To tease him. He snatched her away. 
Using his free hand he gripped her thumbs and held her hands high above her head, stretching her body, when he looked down the sight was wonderful. She had perfect form and her breasts were beautifully shaped in that position.
She inched herself forward again, not caring that she was now uncomfortably kneeling on a rock wall with her arms stretched above her head, her only care was to please this man, to enjoy his pleasure. She reached out with her tongue, its tip touched the wetness of his pleasure, she lapped it up, and savouring every drop she pressed her head a fraction closer that she might be able to encompass his head with her lips.

He used his grip wisely, guiding her mouth, allowing her certain freedom of movement but still maintaining full control. If he wished he could easily have thrust her forward onto him, impaling himself deep inside her mouth, he felt sure it would have reached the back of her throat. He had no recollection of being this aroused before. 
As it was he was more than happy to allow her to continue, her lips had formed a close seal around his shaft and she was easing herself along its length whilst flicking the tip with her tongue. Her breathing became more ragged as he grew within her mouth, the swelling had now ceased but the pressure was increasing with every stroke of her lips along its shaft. She altered her movements in time with his breathing, if be breathed slowly and shallowly, she sucked slowly if he breathed hard, so did she suck. Her bottom began to gyrate in time with her ministrations, almost as if she were dancing on his cock. As he was watching her swallow his tool he had noticed and was now almost mesmerised by the action, his tool gliding in and out of her lips as her perfect moon shaped bottom swayed softly from side to side. His excitement heightened by the sight before him he released her hands, she took that as a signal, a signal that he would soon be satisfied, a signal for her to administer better. 
"make me cum" he ordered, she placed one hand upon his buttocks and pulled him towards her, taking every inch of his manhood into her mouth, cupping his testicles in her free hand she worked him to the point of orgasm, sucking and licking his length as if there was nothing else she would rather do, eager to taste the fruits of her reward. She could sense he was near his climax, she eased off allowing his excitement to diminish, as soon as his breathing returned to near normal she began again, sucking, licking, nipping encouraging him to give his all. The force of his ejaculation was immense, wave after wave of orgasm shot through her as she sucked her way to his climax. He could sense she was cuming and it proved only to heighten his excitement. Her body rocked with pleasure as she swallowed his sap, he smiled but she could not see, her thought were only for his member and ensuring she did not waste a single drop of his essence.

How glad he was that he had noticed her, how fortuitous that they had met. How pleased he was that he had selected her. He released her from his grip, his member slowly shrinking in her mouth. She let him go and wiped her lips on the back of her hand. She rose gracefully to her feet and turned. Stepping from the sea wall where they had had their encounter he walked away. Not once did he look back, not once to he show his pleasure in her abilities. She watched him leave. The sun beginning to fall below the horizon was altering the colour of the sky from blue to red. He disappeared behind a broken down trawler. No longer could she see him, she had no idea where he had gone.

Kitty followed the lie of the wall, tracing the path she took each night, around the head of the cove and over the rocks. Her bare feet used to the harshness of the rocks she scrambled to her cove side resting place, a small abandoned beachside caf� last inhabited years ago. There she lay upon the floor and rested. As night fell sleep overcame her, thoughts of the stranger in her head.
