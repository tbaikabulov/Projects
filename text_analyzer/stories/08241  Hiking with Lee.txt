Chapter 1
I had spent most of a month with Lee so far on our hike. We often split up during the day, with our varying paces, but met up again each evening. Lee moved faster than I most days, and would be eating his dinner while I set up my tent and unpacked my cooking gear.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tonight, though, he surprised me &#8211; when I (finally) arrived at the campsite, Lee had cooked dinner for two. It was nothing fancy, just solid camp food, but I appreciated the gesture. Lee waited for me to shrug out of my pack, and then motioned me to a seat on the plastic groundcover he had laid out. From experience, I knew it was pointless to argue that I was perfectly capable of getting my own food, so I settled as comfortably as I could on the plastic as Lee handed me a bowl. I was so hungry, and it smelled heavenly. Lee picked up his serving in the cooking pot and stretched out next to me, long legs stretched out in front of him.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Bon appetit.� Lee joked. �I know it&#8217;s mac and cheese again &#8211; we&#8217;ve run out of choices.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Lee, it looks great. I really appreciate that you cooked. I&#8217;ll take care of the dishes for you, once I get my tarp staked.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We sat and talked over dinner so long that I had to rush to rig my tarp before darkness set in. I grabbed the dirty dishes and headed off to do the washing up. When I came back, Lee was reading in the light of a propped-up flashlight, shirtless. I hesitated outside the circle of light for a moment. There was little privacy while camping, and Lee had changed in my sight before, but he&#8217;d never been this deliberate in showing off skin.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh, hey, finish the dishes already?� Lee called casually over his shoulder.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yeah�, I responded, stepping back into the campsite proper. �I&#8217;ll just put your stuff here by your pack, okay?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After setting down the cooking gear, I grabbed my journal out of my bag and sat down on the other side of the flashlight from Lee. This was my favourite part of the day, relaxing with Lee and being alone with my thoughts. 

Tonight, though, my thoughts all seemed to be about Lee. He sat in his usual pose, lanky legs extended. I watched him over the rim of my notebook, trying to pretend I was thinking of what to write. My eyes started at the muscular calves coming out of his heavy boots and moved slowly upward, past loose nylon shorts only hinting at the shape of his thighs. His stomach had just the smallest suggestion of a six-pack underneath a fine coating of sandy hairs. His chest and arms were lean, belying the strength I&#8217;d seen him exert on the trail.

When my wandering gaze finally reached Lee&#8217;s face, I realised he was watching me drink him in. Embarrassed at being caught, I dropped my eyes to the still-blank page of my journal. 

�It&#8217;s okay.� Lee&#8217;s voice startled me. �I want you to look.� He shifted closer to me in the dim light. �I&#8217;ve been waiting for you to look at me like that for weeks.� His voice was husky, and I could feel his hot breath on the side of my face. My pulse quickened; I&#8217;d been waiting for this moment too.

Lee leaned over, and just that fast, we were kissing. Lips on lips, parting, tongue on teeth, heat; then on my throat, my ear. Hands everywhere; breathless. We broke for a moment, gasping, and I looked at Lee with a new admiration in my eyes. I would never have had the nerve to try something like that, and even now, I was perfectly content to let him take the lead.

Almost as if he read my thoughts, Lee grasped my shoulders with a new force, pushing me backward into the dirt. He began nipping gently along the side of my neck, down towards my shoulder. I moaned. Lee glanced at me, just the hint of an evil grin playing about the corners of his lips, then turned back to softly torturing my skin. Reaching the sensitive joint where my neck met my shoulder, he bit down harder, eliciting another groan from me. Running his lips up the length of my throat, he paused for a moment to nibble under my chin, and then returned to more conventional kisses.

I responded as best I could, but my fumbling hands felt woefully inadequate. I was running one hand across his chest, trying to find somewhere that garnered a response from Lee. But every time I felt like I was reciprocating successfully, Lee would do something with his lips and tongue that made me gasp and lose track of what I was doing. After a few minutes of this, I gave up and enjoyed the ride, letting my hands just wander under their own control. 

Just as suddenly as he&#8217;d begun, Lee stopped kissing me. He grabbed my hand and pulled me to my feet. I stood there, confused, as Lee began to fumble with the buckled waistband of his shorts. He glanced over at me, and paused.

�Well, what are you waiting for?�

�Lee�� I said, plaintively. Lee knew about my body, of course, because we&#8217;d talked about nearly everything during our time together. But he&#8217;d never seen me naked. 

Lee seemed to understand my hesitation. He came over and set his hands on my shoulders, looking deep into my eyes. I was completely entranced by his gaze, and felt completely under his power. In that moment, I would have done anything for him.

�I don&#8217;t care what your birth certificate says; you&#8217;re the sexiest guy I&#8217;ve ever seen. I&#8217;ve finally got you interested in me, and I&#8217;m not wasting this chance to see every inch of that hot body.�

With that, Lee grabbed both my wrists in one hand, holding them over my head, and pushed me against a nearby tree. I resisted the urge to tell him he should have done this a month ago &#8211; I would have been interested then, too. With his free hand, Lee began peeling my shirt off, taking every opportunity to run his fingers across bare skin as it was exposed. Almost immediately, he discovered the sensitivity of the area just below my ribcage, and took full advantage of this fact. 

After several wonderfully agonizing minutes, Lee finally stopped his tickling and pulled my shirt over my head, where it settled on my up stretched arms behind my neck. Thinking to remove it fully, I started to pull my right hand out of Lee&#8217;s grasp. But he only grabbed my wrists tighter and pushed me back up against the tree, hard. 

�No. You stand here, just like this, until I tell you otherwise. Do you understand?�

I nodded, eyes wide.

�Tell me you understand.�

I swallowed, trying to wet my tongue and throat.

�I understand� I managed finally. But Lee was still not satisfied.

 �So what are you going to do?�

I swallowed again.

�Stand here until you tell me otherwise, sir.� 

I wasn&#8217;t sure where the �sir� had come from, but Lee seemed pleased. He went back to undressing me. With a push, he indicated my wrists should stay put, even though he let go. My hiking pants came down next, and Lee ran his fingers down the outside of my legs while removing the pants. In my heightened state, the sensation was intense and left me shivering, his fingers making burning trails on my skin.

�Step�, Lee commanded, and I obediently lifted my feet clear of the fabric around my ankles. My camp shoes came off as well, and I was left barefoot on the packed earth, wearing only my underwear and binder, arms extended above my head. In fact, my arms were beginning to tire, and I hoped Lee would let me put them down soon. He stood in front of me, letting his eyes roam freely across my exposed body. His look was almost tangible; I could feel his eyes rake my skin.

Moving to stand on one side of me, he said, �You can bring your arms down now.� Sighing with relief and gratitude, I let my shoulders relax. Due to the entanglement of my shirt, however, I could only rest my arms behind me, hands at the back of my pelvis.

Smack! A stinging slap landed across the back of my upper thigh. 

�OW! Hey, what was that for?�

Smack!

�I let you bring your arms down. What do you think you should have done?�

Smack!

My mind raced. What did he mean?

Smack!

In desperation, I raised my arms above my head again, hoping to stop the barrage. 

�You can put your arms down now,� Lee repeated calmly. My head was spinning. I brought my hands down behind me again.

Smack! Smack!

�OW!�

Epiphany!

�Thank you�sir!� I choked out, on the verge of tears. Lee wrapped me in his arms, soothing me with his nearness and warmth. He smoothed back my hair and kissed my forehead. 

�Good job. You&#8217;re a smart boy; I knew you&#8217;d figure it out.�















Chapter 2

I took a couple deep, shuddering breaths. Lee looked at me, concerned. 

�Are you okay? I didn&#8217;t hurt you, did I?�

I shook my head. As strange as the question seemed, given that he&#8217;d just hit me half a dozen times, I knew what he meant, and the sting was dissipating quickly. It had been more shock than anything that had made me cry out, really. This unexpected roughness was a side to Lee I&#8217;d never seen before. 

He eyed me up and down, the sly glint from before returning to his eyes.

�I still wanna see you naked.�

I had misgivings on this point, and they must have showed in my face. Lee ran his hands down my sides. 

�You are one sexy man.�

His fingers were toying with the waistband of my boxers now, feather-light touches leaving me aching for more. Futilely, I tried to stop my body from bucking into his hand. Lee just chuckled softly and moved with me, only barely keeping in contact with my skin. Leaning in, he blew softly at the base of my ear.

�Ohhhh�� I couldn&#8217;t help myself; I was tremendously aware of every sensation.

Lee whispered in my ear. �Come on, stop teasing me. I know you want this.�

�I&#8217;m teasing you?!�

Lee&#8217;s only response was to blow softly on my neck again. Every nerve ending in my body was tingling. At that point, I wanted Lee to touch me more than anything in the world. Unable to take one more second, I gripped the base of my binder and pulled it off over my head. Instinctively, as it came free, I half-turned my body away from Lee. But he spun me back around to face him and pulled me close. 

�You&#8217;ve got nothing to be ashamed of with me. Ever.�

His manner became almost businesslike at this point, and he stepped back.

�Now, to finish the job.� He reached for my waistband again, but I put a hand on his to stop him.

�Lee, I know you&#8217;re fine with my body, but I want you to be prepared. When you take those off, I&#8217;m not going to look like a guy, okay?�

Lee nodded. I took a deep breath and released his hand. Lee took his time sliding the fabric down my legs, making sure his hands caressed my skin every inch of the way. He reached my feet and I stepped free.

�Thank you sir,� I said softly.
Chapter 3
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was still standing barefoot and backed against the tree, but now I was completely open to Lee&#8217;s gaze. He had made no motions to remove his own clothing, further emphasizing the vulnerability of my position. Lee studied me for several minutes, letting his eyes roam freely across my body, apparently thinking. I simply stood and waited, arms hanging limply, though my body was screaming for his touch.

Night was falling now, leaving the pair of us in an intermediate twilight world. I knew the woods would never be truly black, but in not too much longer we were going to have trouble seeing where things were. Nevertheless, I trusted Lee&#8217;s judgement. He was a much more experienced backpacker than I, and I knew he would take care of us.

Lee reached over and untangled my shirt from my shoulders, tossing it onto the pile of my discarded clothing. I wasn&#8217;t sure if I was supposed to be doing anything at this point, but then Lee grabbed my hand. 

�We&#8217;ll go into the tent. I don&#8217;t think there are any night hikers around, but I would hate for us to get interrupted.� 

He picked up the flashlight off the ground, and then led me into his shelter. I had never tried to put two people in a tarp shelter, but it seemed that Lee had planned for this moment somewhat; it was pitched in a way that allowed both of us enough space, although not much headroom. The ground here was covered with the same plastic cloth we&#8217;d eaten dinner over, and Lee&#8217;s sleeping bag and pad were laid out in the center. Lee unzipped the bag all the way around, and opened it into a flat blanket, then hung the flashlight from a loop near the center of the tarp.

Lee pushed me backwards onto the fleece, and then ducked back out of the tent. I lay and waited, wishing I knew what was going on. Lee reappeared a few moments later with his pack, which he opened and began rummaging through. He turned and grinned at me, brandishing a length of rope and a couple of stretch cables that he used to tie extra items to the outside of his pack, plus a number of multi-purpose bandanas he carried.

My eyes widened. This was a topic that somehow hadn&#8217;t come up during our time together. Somehow, I just hadn&#8217;t pictured Lee, the young, clean-cut college graduate I&#8217;d spent the last month with, doing rope ties. At this point in the evening, though, I&#8217;d accept nearly anything just to get Lee to touch me again, including whatever he had planned for those ropes. 

I rolled onto my side and sat up on one elbow, watching Lee&#8217;s mysterious preparations. Lee spotted my movement almost immediately.

�Oh no you don&#8217;t,� he teased. �If you see, you&#8217;ll ruin the surprise.� 

He picked up two of the bandanas, folded them over a few times, and tied the ends together. I had an idea of what was to come, and rolled onto my back, supporting my neck so that my head remained a few inches up. Lee made his way over to me, crouched to avoid hitting the tarp with his head, and held the back of my head with one hand. With his other hand, he fastened the improvised blindfold across my face. It fitted snugly, effectively blocking out all light.&nbsp; 

It was like being hypnotised. Any second I liked, I could untie the blindfold, put my clothes on, and end this. Any time I wanted. I just didn&#8217;t want to right at that moment. I suppose it was a case of curiosity killing the cat; if I left, I wouldn&#8217;t ever know what happened next. Even if it meant lying there naked in a shelter that provided only minimal privacy, blindfolded, while my hiking partner did God-knows-what with a pile of ropes. 

The waiting was intense. My inability to see what Lee was doing only heightened my anticipation. I could hear rustling, and movement, then near-silence. I strained my ears, but couldn&#8217;t make out where Lee was or what he might be about to do. 

�I&#8217;m going to tie your hands now.� 

The sound of Lee&#8217;s voice made me jump. �You&#8217;ve just been going along up till now, but I need you to tell me if I go too far. If you&#8217;re moaning, or crying, or even saying no, I won&#8217;t stop, but if you say &#8216;Lee, you&#8217;re going too far&#8217;, I&#8217;ll stop right away. Okay? Let me hear you say it.�

�Lee, you&#8217;re going too far.� I repeated obediently. I was familiar with the concept of a safeword, though I&#8217;d never been in a position before to have one. It was nice to have a safety net; I didn&#8217;t think I&#8217;d need it with Lee, but I was glad to know he was thinking of my feelings and my safety.

�Good boy. Now give me your hands.� Dutifully, I held my wrists up towards the sound of Lee&#8217;s voice, hoping I wouldn&#8217;t accidentally pop him in the nose or do something else to ruin the moment. Lee wrapped and knotted for a few moments.

�Try to pull your hands free now.� I followed his instruction, but couldn&#8217;t get loose, no matter the angle from which I yanked. Lee rolled me over so I was laying on my front, facedown into the sleeping bag. He then took my bound hands and stretched them over my head, attaching them to something at ground level. I gave a few experimental tugs, and realised I was tied to a tent stake. Lee must have stuck his spares in the ground inside the shelter. 

�I&#8217;m at your ankles now; don&#8217;t kick me.� Lee had picked up on how jumpy I was, and how strongly I was responding to his every touch. He took my right ankle and tied it to a tent stake, then my left, leaving me immobile with my legs spread just slightly wider than my shoulders. A rolled jacket shoved in under my hips completed the effect; I&#8217;d never felt so defenceless in my life. 

I&#8217;d also never been quite this turned on.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
Chapter Four
My head tossed from side to side as I struggled to find a position where I could breathe comfortably. 

�Shhh�� Lee soothed. �Just breathe slowly and deeply.� 

I quickly discovered that he was right; if I just kept my breathing steady, I had no problem getting enough air. The thought occurred to me that Lee seemed awfully experienced, picking up on my every cue so quickly. I hoped he hadn&#8217;t realised yet how inexperienced I was.

Lee ran his hands up and down the length of my body. His touch was steady and firm, and the blindfold accentuated the feeling of his touch. I didn&#8217;t know where he&#8217;d head next. He started focusing on the back of my thighs and ass, and I tensed, somewhat fearful of what was to come. 

�Hey, now, it&#8217;s okay.� Lee shifted his caresses to my lower back, rubbing in calming circles. �If you don&#8217;t want to do this, tell me and we&#8217;ll stop.�

�No!� I said, too quickly. A note of pleading entered my voice. �Please don&#8217;t stop now.�
Lee reached over to pull up the blindfold, and leaned down to look into my face. 

�You&#8217;re sure?�

Our gazes locked. �I&#8217;m sure, please don&#8217;t stop.� My eyes dropped as I added quietly, �sir.�

Lee stroked my face softly. I closed my eyes and savoured his touch. I&#8217;d never imagined that this level of intimacy and trust for another person was possible; Lee&#8217;s happiness in me meant more than anything. I didn&#8217;t know what came next, but I was confident that Lee could handle it.

The blindfold came back down, and Lee returned to his full-body caresses. I focused on keeping my breathing steady and my body relaxed, but this soon became impossible. Lee seemed to know exactly where to touch me to get the maximum response. I was shuddering and shaking, my breath coming in ragged gasps.

�Oh, God�Lee��

I heard Lee&#8217;s low chuckle.

�Ready?�

I forced myself to stay calm and loose. Lee&#8217;s hand landed sharply on my ass. The pain wasn&#8217;t nearly as bad as I had feared, transmuting quickly into pleasant warmth as Lee rubbed my skin. He continued alternating strikes with caresses for a few minutes. Then I heard him let out a deep breath and shift position.

This time was different. The blows were hard and fast, landing almost right on top of each other. I bit down on the blanket under my face, stifling a whimper. It seemed to go on for an eternity, and by the time he finished, I was crying quietly. But Lee&#8217;s kisses on my cheeks wiped away my tears. 

�Good boy,� Lee told me, his voice approving and coloured with admiration. 

�Thank you, sir,� I whispered, trying to keep from sobbing aloud. The sting from this set of blows dissipated more slowly and left behind a deeper ache. I could hear his steady breathing; the sound was comforting.

�This is a really attractive tie,� Lee reflected, seemingly to himself. �I&#8217;ll have to remember it. Gives lots of access.�

As if to punctuate his words, Lee grabbed a handful of flesh on my backside and squeezed. I yelped.

�Sore?� Lee teased. I sighed in relief as he released his grip. I felt him slip a finger underneath the ropes at my ankles and wrists, checking the tightness.

�Everything okay? You&#8217;ve got circulation in your fingers? No problems with the ropes?�

�Yeah, Lee, I&#8217;m doing fine.� I let a little of the attitude I used in our banter slip into my voice. �It only hurts where you hit me.�

Lee laughed and slapped my ass playfully.

�It&#8217;s supposed to!� His tone sobered. �But you&#8217;re really okay? I don&#8217;t want to hurt you.�

Again, an odd statement given the situation, but I understood.

�Lee, I&#8217;m more than okay. I&#8217;m amazing. You&#8217;re amazing.�

I could hear the smile in his voice. �Good.�

Chapter Five
Lee returned to stroking my shoulders and back. It seemed like he was being very careful to stay in the same areas he&#8217;d touched before. He knew I was uncomfortable with parts of my anatomy, but I&#8217;d never gone into details. We were breaking new ground here.

�Lee, just so you know, if you wanted to touch me�underneath�you could. No penetration there, but touching is fine.� I felt Lee&#8217;s hand hesitate, and added hurriedly, �Only if you want to, of course, if you don&#8217;t it&#8217;s fine.� 

Lee cleared his throat. �Look, don&#8217;t take this the wrong way. I&#8217;ve never been with a, uh��

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Female-bodied man,� I supplied helpfully.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Thank you, a female-bodied man before. I don&#8217;t know how to touch you.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I just wanted to clear up any grey areas. Everything&#8217;s still up to you. I&#8217;m sure you can&#8217;t go wrong, though. Whatever instincts you&#8217;ve been relying on have been right on the money so far.�

  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lee returned to stroking my lower back, quickly locating some sensitive areas. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�So you liked�this? What about�this?� He had me breathless again within moments. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh�oh�yes sir!� 

His touch was overwhelming, and I lost track of where his hands actually were and where they&#8217;d been just moments before. Then one finger circled the tender skin around my anus, and slipped onto sensitive areas below. Lee was barely making contact, but it was more than enough. I peaked, hard, eyes clenched shut and mind flying. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When I finally came back to Earth, Lee was fumbling with the knots on the blindfold until it fell free, then did the same to the ropes on my wrists and ankles. Once loosed, I flexed my muscles, stretching. I sat upright to look at Lee.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I lost you for a minute there. Seems I did it right.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I grinned at him. �You did it perfect.� I reached out and took his hands. �Thank you. Now, when&#8217;s the part where I get to see you naked?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lee blinked and looked down at himself. �I&#8217;d forgotten I even had these on.� Deftly, he undid the buckle of his shorts and slipped them off, then returned to his default sitting position, legs outstretched. I was unsurprised to see he went commando; many of the long-distance hikers I&#8217;d met considered underwear unnecessary weight. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Lee,� I said, unable to keep the teasing tone out of my voice, �if you get any harder, I think it&#8217;s going to get stuck like that.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He looked at me slyly. �I can think of a few things you could do about that.� 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I licked my lips. �So can I.� I shifted my position so that I was kneeling between his thighs, and tilted my head back to look up at him. �May I?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lee nodded, so I leaned my head forward to bring my head down to the level of his penis. I gently kissed the head, allowing my tongue to dart out momentarily and brush the slit on the tip. Continuing my light kisses, I made my way along the length of his shaft until I reached the base. I nuzzled into the hair growth there for a moment, drinking in Lee&#8217;s not-unpleasantly musky, masculine, odour. Reaching up, I rubbed his balls for a moment before taking one, then the other, into my mouth and sucking it. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I ran my tongue back up the length, where I kissed the tip again. Opening my lips, I took him into my mouth and began to suck. At this point, I was running on impulse, gut feeling, and a few minutes of a half-remembered porn movie; this was farther than I&#8217;d ever gone with a guy. I tightened my lips, trying to improve friction as I moved my head up and down. I was only able to swallow a few inches of Lee before I hit my gag reflex and had to back off. I combined this short motion with long sweeps of my tongue, and garnered soft noises of appreciation from Lee. I kept this up until Lee grabbed the back of my head and pulled me off. 

�What&#8217;s wrong?� I asked, terrified I&#8217;d made some sort of mistake. Lee rubbed the back of my neck.

�Nothing&#8217;s wrong, baby, that was great. I just don&#8217;t want to end this soon.�

Chapter Six
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Lee pushed me back into my now-familiar facedown position on the sleeping bag. Thinking he was going to tie me again, I stretched my wrists out towards the stake in the ground that I&#8217;d been attached to before. 
����������� �You don&#8217;t have to do that now.� Lee paused. �Unless you really want to.�
����������� I was hoping he would tie me again; the feelings from the previous time had been fantastic. �I do, Lee.�
����������� �You&#8217;re going to have to tell me what you want.�
����������� I hesitated, but forced the words out: �I want you to tie me up, Lee.�
����������� His tone sharpened. �Is that how you ask for things, &#8216;I want&#8217;? You&#8217;re not a three-year-old; try again.�
����������� I thought for a moment, trying to figure out what he was asking and what he meant.
����������� �Sir, could you tie me up, please?�
����������� �Since you asked so nicely, I will. But only your hands; I want your legs free for now.� Swiftly, he knotted a discarded rope around my crossed wrists and tied it to the tent stake. �Keep your head down and don&#8217;t move,� Lee commanded.
����������� I could hear him rummaging in his pack behind me. Now that I wasn&#8217;t wearing a blindfold, waiting in ignorance for Lee to return seemed interminable, and I was resisting the temptation to sneak a quick look behind me. But just as I thought I couldn&#8217;t wait one more moment, I felt Lee&#8217;s hand on the crack of my ass, spreading apart the flesh.
����������� Something cold and slippery landed directly on my sphincter, and I yelled out with the sudden sensation. Despite myself, I jumped and started to turn my head to look at Lee.
����������� �I told you to hold still!� Lee swatted my backside hard enough to hurt, and I went quickly back into position. �It&#8217;s just the Vaseline from my first-aid kit.�
����������� Lee pressed a greased finger into me. I tried to relax as best I could. My muscles resisted the intrusion for a moment, then released. There was an odd feeling of pleasurable fullness, with just a twinge of pain. I moaned loudly as Lee shifted his finger from side to side, then pumped in and out a few times.
����������� The pain increased sharply as he inserted a second finger beside the first, but he moved slowly, allowing me to adjust. I murmured incoherently, unable to express the combination of pain and pleasure the new sensations were bringing me. Unconsciously, my hips began to thrust backward into Lee&#8217;s hand. But after wiggling his fingers a few more times, he pulled free. I whined, wounded by the sudden emptiness.
����������� Lee said something to me, but I missed it, still caught up in the whirlwind of the experience. He shook my shoulder. 
����������� �Hey. Hey! This is important. I need you to open your eyes and pay attention to me.� I opened my eyes and focused fuzzily. My mind was not working at its full capacity; I felt almost drunk. Lee shook my shoulder again, and I managed to make eye contact. �Are you a virgin? Have you ever done this before?�
����������� I shook my head, my cheeks colouring in embarrassment. Now the truth was coming out: my personal experience was next-to-nothing. 
����������� �This is going to hurt, then. There&#8217;s not much I can do to prevent it.�
����������� �Please�� I begged, though somewhat ashamed of my obvious need. �I want you.� 
����������� Lee ran his hand down my spine possessively. �Here we go, then. Don&#8217;t worry about holding still any more.�
����������� I felt him climb behind me and straddle my hips. He pushed into me, a millimetre at a time. I felt stretched to the limit, and I could feel every bump and vein on the surface of his cock, but nothing was tearing. Slowly, Lee continued to fill me up, then paused to grab hold of my hipbones.
����������� �Brace yourself,� he warned. Suddenly he slammed forward, forcing himself the rest of the way into me with one thrust. I threw my head back and let out a cry like that of a wounded animal. That had hurt. Lee allowed me a few moments to catch my breath, then began building into a rhythm, pulling nearly all the way out before sliding back in. As before, the pleasant sensations� quickly overcame the disagreeable ones, and I was soon moaning in pleasure along with Lee. 
����������� Lee pumped into me for what felt like an age. The feeling of him inside me, plus the friction of the sleeping bag on the ground below me, and the helpless feeling the ropes on my arms gave me, all added up to an incredibly stimulating experience. I lost track of my own orgasms, and settled into a state of high arousal. Lee shuddered, and abruptly I felt an odd, warm sensation that I realised was Lee&#8217;s sperm inside me, as he reached his own peak. He jerked a few more times, then withdrew slowly to lie beside me.
����������� We were both drenched in sweat and gasping for breath. Lee reached up and over my body to untie my wrists, then wrapped his arms around me. I rolled onto my side and curled up into the curve of his body. 
��� "How do you feel?"
��� "Perfect," I mumbled. "I've never felt anything like that. Tired, though."
��� He stroked me comfortingly. "Go ahead and rest now."
��� I snuggled deeper into Lee's arms, and barely noticed him pulling the sleeping bag over the pair of us, before I was asleep.
