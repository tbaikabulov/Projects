Mother Nature&#8217;s Wrath

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was dark and stormy night. Thick black rain soaked clouds rushed in from the coast blocking out the fleeting rays of late evening sun. An angry storm was quickly approaching from deep within the pacific to batter the Northwest. Here just south of Seattle we were predicted to take the brunt of the strong fall storm. A bright flash in the distance sent a shiver down my spine. Slowly, methodically, I counted. One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eighï¿½
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A deep rumble ended my count. Lightening wasn&#8217;t something I had thought about. It added a severe risk to my adventure. Death for sex was a risk I knew would never pay off. As another flash lit up the sky I knew I should quite but my arousal was driving my decisions. Again I counted. As I counted a gust of wind nearly knocked me to my feet. Bracing myself against the wind made me lose my count. As the rumble of the thunder rolled across the land I guessed it had taken ten seconds. Staring out into the night I watched as yet another flash lit up the sky. Peering deep into the dark night I let my engineering nature calm my nerves. Getting struck by lightning was a one in a million long shot I told myself.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Numbers were my livelihood. Five years in college had trained me to be a civil engineer. As graduation approached I realized I had made a mistake. There was no way I could live behind a desk. I needed more excitement and stimulation. A quick walk through the career fair introduced me to the world of construction. Now at age twenty-seven I build bridges for a living. Every day is different and every day I learn new ways of building new things. When I&#8217;m not at work designing new ways to build bridges I spend my time at home pondering new forms of bondage. My thrill is finding things no one else has thought of trying.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Looking deep into the darkness I pondered what was in store for me. My house is due south of Seattle, right in the path of the heart of the storm. Meteorologists from every local news station were hyping this storm and the damage it was threating to inflict on the region. As I watched the solid wall of black clouds roll in from the distance I realized for the first time the news wasn&#8217;t sensationalizing a story. Several more flashes of lightning illuminated the wall of clouds giving me a full preview of its fury. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A wave of uncertainty rushed over me as I checked my surroundings. All around me I could see houses with windows lit but knew none had a clear view of me. My backyard was unfenced but the surrounding topography drastically limited people&#8217;s view of it. By no means was it completely private but in the darkness of night I knew it would be impossible for anyone to see me. Standing in the shadow of my house, I was afforded a sliver of pitch blackness from the street lights on the opposite side of the house.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Looking back towards the house I admired the large barrels positioned at the base of each down spout. The barrels captured and stored the rain water that came off the roof of the house. No one questioned the purpose of the barrels. Seattle was an environmentally conscious city, which made rain barrels a sight that generated little attention. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;An extensive search of Craigslist and Ebay eventually allowed me to acquire virtually every item I needed to make my stormy bondage possible. I couldn&#8217;t help but enjoy the tight feeling of the thick neoprene wetsuit I had on. Purchased for nearly nothing, the heavily insulated rubber dive suit squeezed every inch of my skin. Straining against the tight material, my rock hard cock formed a noticeable bulge in the front of the suit. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Feeling the splash of raindrops on my exposedface broke me from my trance and urged me forward.Stepping forward onto my back lawn, I moved to the edge of the shadow created by my house. There, in the shadow, was an empty king size waterbed. Laying down on the limp rubbery material, I quickly positioned my body so that each of my limbs were pointed towards the corners of the bed. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Even in the darkness, it wasn&#8217;t hard to find the D-rings I had glued to the bed using heavy rubber straps. Beside each ring was a lock. I quickly buckled both of my ankles to the rings on the bottom corners of the bed then repeated the process to my wrists. Despite the fact each ring was mounted to a corner of the water bed, the fact it was empty allowed me free mobility of my limbs. With each of my wrists now locked to a corner of the bed, I doubled checked that the keys to the locks were still duck taped to the chest of my wet suit. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A steady stream of icy coldrain drops began to pelt my face. Greedily, I sucked in the fresh water around the large red ball gag locked between my teeth. Above me the sky filled with angry black clouds. Off in the distanceanother flash of lighting brightened the sky as a torrent of rain crashed down upon my body. My exposed face quickly began to burn from thefrigid cold as the wind and rain beat against my skin but the rest of my body was sweating inside the cocoon of tight rubber that encased me. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As the rains continued to increase in intensity I began to feel the waterbed beneath me begin to swell. Each of the rain barrels catching water around my house were connected together by garden hoses. The last barrel in the series of barrels had a garden hose that ran down the hill into my backyard and into the water bed I was laying on. At the moment all the rainwater from my entire house was being diverted into the water bed I was laying on. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I felt my body slowly lift off the ground as a torrential down pour quickly began to fill the waterbed. Rain pounded against my face as the wind began to scream through the trees. I tried to reach up and brush the rain from my eyes but the saturated bed was already too full of water to allow me to pull my arms in. A bright flash of light directly overhead was immediately followed by an earthshaking rumble. Suddenly the lightening was directly overhead. My entire body shook from the force of the thunder. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Quickly I reached for the water valve on the bed but my arms couldn&#8217;t reach. The bed was too full of water. My body was stuck splayed out from corner to corner. As the intensity of the rainstorm increased, so did the swelling of the bed. I felt my limbs being stretched from corner to corner as more and more water filled the water bed. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was too late for me to back out. More lightening filled the sky as my body was stretched to a full spread eagle position. I knew I was in for a long night as my limbs began to strain to try and reach the fully filled corners of the bed. Attached to the hose leading from the rain barrel to the waterbed was an electronic sprinkler timer control. I had set the timer to activate four hours from now. When the valve activated all of the water from the waterbed and rain barrels would be able to drain out. Until then, I was completely stuck.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Leaves and rain pelted my face as the wind continued to increase. My limbs were stretched to the max as the waterbed completely filled. I couldn&#8217;t believe how fast the bed had filled. There was more rain falling than any of the meteorologist had predicted. Another streak of lightning lit up the sky. This time a single bolt of electricity streaked towards the ground. The sky turned green as dozens of electrical transformers blew. As the fire from the transformers quickly died the area went dark. My eyes went wide realizing what had happened. There wasn&#8217;t a single light on in the area. I strained against my bonds to turn and stare at the water timer. I screamed into the ball gag seeing that the little green standby light was dead. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;More bolts of lightning shot down from the sky causing more transformers to blow. The city glow in the sky began to dim as more and more of the city lost power. Above the roar of the wind and the growl of the thunder I could hear the sound of water pouring into my rain barrels. My arms and legs strained as the waterbed swelled from the water pressure. More transformers blew coloring the sky with an eerie shade of greenbefore going out and plunging the area into an even deeper depth of darkness. Tens of thousands of people were suddenly going without power which meant it was going to take hours possibly even days before everything was restored. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Beneath me the waterbed had stopped growing but I could hear the barrels around the house filling. I cursed my need for risk. The timer was only set to come on for one hour every four hours. One hour wasonly enough time to empty the waterbedand a little water from all the rain barrels. My big bondage risk for tonight was a heavy rainstorm at the start of the night filling the rain barrels. Four full rain barrels would require the timer to activate at least twice to drain all that water and that was if the rain wasn&#8217;t refilling the barrels. Seeing all the lights sequentially dying across the city made me realize I would be stuck for hours past whenever the power was restored to my house. I screamed into the gag but the roar of the storm overwhelmed any noise I could make. More lights across town blinked out as the fury of the storm increased. Looking around I began to see candles in windows which meant my neighbors were home. I prayed that the power would be restored in time to release me for the light of morning could reveal my activities.
