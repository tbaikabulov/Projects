Chapter 1 
The man was anxious. He knew about the group's preparations for a snuff film
  and he was determined to prevent the ultimate outcome. He couldn't do much
  to prevent what would happen to the woman in the lead-up and frankly, he wasn't
  too sure he really wanted to. 
The &quot;Group&quot; was a collection of men and women who had made several
  fake snuff films. A few in the group, including him, had acted in previous
  films and he had belonged to the group for a long time. He would, and had,
  beaten a woman bloody, nailed tits to a board and branded them but he drew
  the line at murder. 
Valerie, the woman who would be involved in the proposed snuff film, was thirty-nine
  years old and a widow left with nearly nothing when her husband died. She had
  two kids she wanted to go to college but knew she'd never be able to finance
  their education. Additionally, the family home was in danger of foreclosure
  by the bank. She worked hard but couldn't get ahead and was very discouraged. 
She answered an unusual advertisement on a fetish website and, subsequently,
  a meeting with a couple women and some men was set up, She couldn't see them
  but she had noticed two different female voices; she couldn't count the men.
  The security arrangements were explained away so that she would never know
  any of the people who engaged her. After some careful questioning, and a huge
  pause, Valerie acknowledged that she understood the offer might involve her
  death. One of the men interviewing her cleared any uncertainty by assuring
  her that it was not a case of might but absolutely would involve her death. 
Over a period of a few weeks, the Group made arrangements so her kids would
  have enough money to go to college and the house would be paid off and put
  in their names. She also arranged for an old school chum who was an attorney
  to be administrator of her will and guardian to the boys if anything ever happened
  to her. 
Preparations for the event took time but finally all was ready and she had
  prepared herself in ways that, under different circumstances, she would never
  have done. Her many new piercings were a case in point. She knew women who
  had their nipples pierced but she would never have thought of having it done
  herself. Afterwards, looking in the mirror, she had to admit they were very
  attractive. But getting it done had hurt like a bitch because the group had
  insisted on larger than average rings, which meant a larger hole and that hurt
  more. Most women would have begun with smaller holes and worked their way up
  but she didn't have the time. 
The many rings in her pussy were interesting; they hadn't hurt as much as
  the piercings in her nips and had healed faster. Yes, the clit piercing had
  hurt a lot but she had to admit it was sort of neat. She also discovered right
  off that it was very useful and wished she'd had it sooner. She had a nice
  little gold bar in her clit but the line of rings around her outer pussy lips
  were just there. 
In addition to the nipples and pussy her naval and nose were also pierced
  and the ears done several more times. She could hide the pussy and nipple piercings
  but the ear and nose ones could not be hidden from her kids so she just told
  them she liked them. 
The nose ring was startling. It was large, descending below the level of her
  upper lip, which meant she sometimes had to lift it out of the way when she
  was eating. The piercings in her eyebrows really gave her an odd look, as did
  the inserts in her ear lobes. Damn but those large holes in her ears had hurt;
  they actually were punched out. She added up the total of new holes in her
  skin and in her head, and was startled when it came to twenty-two. Fortunately,
  one of the Group gave her some salve that seemed to accelerate the healing
  process. Nevertheless, she adhered to the daily treatment set up by the person
  who had done her piercings. 
Not all of the required preparations were painful. For instance, shaving her
  pussy was something she hadn't done since she got married, and it was fun to
  do again. Yes, of course, she had shaved her pussy many times as a teen and
  college student in her twenties but her husband had encouraged her to let her
  bush grow. She thought it would be nicer to eat a shaven pussy but he said
  he liked the feel of her pussy hair on his face when he did her. 
The group had given her a special fastener so that she could wear her new
  leather coat open but just enough to barely cover her bare tits. The first
  time she had gone out wearing it this way, she felt she was on display, which
  she was, but she didn't notice people being especially impressed or even noticing.
  Plus, lo and behold, she liked the exhibitionist part. 
Although she had a couple of pairs of boots to go with her leather pants,
  the Group required that she be fitted for new boots at a certain cobbler's.
  Valerie had no idea what this was about. 
She had frequently masturbated after the death of her husband but the Group
  wanted her to increase the frequency. They had given her a set of ben wa balls
  to wear while she was at work and those little metal balls had been a revelation.
  They seemed to keep her horny all the time. Except when she was a teenager,
  she couldn't recall such a continual state of sexual arousal. It was nice.
  She might only have a few more weeks to live, but it seemed she was going to
  go out as a fully aroused sexual animal. What have I been missing she asked
  herself frequently. 
Since she had been widowed Valerie had gone out a few times with girl friends
  and a couple times men she had met in bars had even fucked her. Again, at the
  request of the Group, she had gone out a few times after making the deal, and
  even seduced a couple men, but neither had been especially memorable with the
  men themselves seemingly confused by her pussy jewellery. Just seducing them
  had been good for her and she even liked the taste of the semen from the man
  she sucked off. 
She had even begun to smoke again because she had figured there was no sense
  in worrying about cancer now. 
Valerie had saved the last requirement until very close to the time when she
  expected to be summoned. When she entered the beauty parlour for her regular
  appointment her light brown hair was shoulder length. Asked how much she wanted
  cut off she had replied all of it! The hairdresser asked her to repeat her
  instructions and she told the beautician to cut it all off and make her bald. 
Reluctantly, the woman had done so. When her hair length was as short as the
  hairdresser could get it with a clippers, she proceeded to lather Valerie's
  scalp and then shaved her head. To her amazement, Valerie was really pleased
  with her appearance. That she had a very nicely shaped head helped a lot, but
  the starkness of her skull without the hair was really beautiful. 
On what she thought might be the last day of her life, Valerie sent her kids
  off to school; then wrote a letter to each child. She told them she had made
  arrangements for them to have the house and money for a college education but,
  to accomplish all this, she would have to leave them and they would never see
  her again. She couldn't bear to tell them that their mother was essentially
  committing suicide to pay for their college education. She asked their pardon
  but told them she knew of no other way. 
After taking one last look around the house she donned a long leather coat.
  She was already wearing a leather corset (that came up over her tits) and leather
  jeans with knee high boots. She took a cab to the airport, making conversation
  with the driver so that he'd be sure to remember her, as if her baldness was
  not unique enough. At the airport, even though she knew the way, she asked
  two different employees for directions to the General Aviation area. Then she
  made a phone call to the number previously given her and said simply: &quot;I'm
  here.&quot; She was told to take a certain seat and wait. 
In time, a woman approached and made like an old friend who hadn't seen her
  in a long time. They chatted for a while and then she asked Valerie if she
  wanted a drink. Figuring it was something required of her, she replied in the
  affirmative, and the two left the seating area. They entered the lounge and
  ordered martinis. Valerie automatically lit a cigarette and the other woman
  merely nodded. Finishing the drinks the woman told her they would exit the
  doors to the apron where the private planes were parked and board a plane. 
When they were seated and strapped in seats on a single engine plane, Valerie
  was handed two black scarves and told to blindfold herself with one and to
  cover her baldhead with the other. She was bemused, if she was going to die,
  why hide where she was going, but did as asked. The pilot never looked directly
  at her and wore his goggles the entire time. The flight was only about half
  an hour long and, for all she knew, they could have landed back where they
  started. 
As they flew along, blindfolded as she was, Valerie considered her leather.
  Her husband had introduced leather into her life and at first she just wore
  it to please him, but gradually had become addicted to the feel and smell of
  leather. Her skin had bonded with the animal softness and her leather wardrobe
  was now extensive. Leather dresses and leather suits, leather trousers in jean
  form and dress up form, she had them all. She had leather blouses and leather
  lingerie, including push up leather bras and leather bras with cut outs for
  her nipples which were especially useful now since her nipples had been pierced.
  She had leather garter belts and kid gloves to the wrist, the elbow and even
  the shoulder. At one point, she had laughingly suggested to her husband that
  the only thing lacking was leather sheets for the bed and, presto, they had
  them. 
Valerie spent a lot of time in her leather cat suit because it was very special.
  She learned very quickly that her husband enjoyed just seeing her dressed in
  it to watch a movie with him. Of course, the suit had zipped openings over
  her boobs and in her crotch and these might be opened or closed as a need occurred.
  When they were open, she might have clothes pins attached to her nipples. They
  hurt, but she learned to get pleasure from that hurt because it was obvious
  her husband enjoyed putting them on her and she enjoyed giving her husband
  that pleasure. 
She also had various things inserted in her cunt and asshole. Being filled
  was something she had grown to like, and when the vibrating effects were on
  she could be kept at a level of sexual tension for several minutes. The idea
  was for her to resist an orgasm for as long as possible. At first, three minutes
  was a long wait, but with practice, eventually she could stretch it out to
  a quarter hour and then a half and finally an hour. That had happened only
  once the last time she and her husband had been together before he died. In
  an instant, she regretted recalling that memory; she was about to die and he
  was already dead. 
She still had to wear the blindfold while being assisted into a car. As they
  were walking away from the plane, she heard the motor rev up. When they got
  in the car, her companion stated the plane was going to fly on for several
  hours. The stop to let them off would not be recorded and the plane had the
  markings of another plane just like it so even if someone remembered the number
  while looking for Valerie, they would reach a dead end. 
They drove for about a quarter hour. While she had no idea where they were,
  Valerie knew they were in deep woods from the smell in the air that came in
  through the ventilation system. In fact, the woodsy odour was the first thing,
  except for the fuel odour at the airport that had overpowered the smell of
  her leather until now. 
Valerie began to think about the things this group might do to her before
  ending her life and ending her anxiety. What, her mind shouted at her, was
  that ? Had she really felt a slight shiver in her pussy? Contemplating a painful
  death was a turn-on? It was! Fuck! Although she had a good sex life with her
  husband, since she had agreed to accept death, all of a sudden she had become
  a very sexual animal. Well, wasn't that just the shits. 
And just then the car came to a stop and her companion told her she could
  remove her blindfold if she wished, so she did. Wow! It was quite a lodge with
  a huge lawn and at least a four-car garage. The driver came around to open
  her door and she was told to extend both feet out of the door before exiting
  the car. When she did the driver and her companion secured leg irons to her
  ankles. The companion explained that they didn't think she would try to escape
  but the leg irons would reduce the temptation. 
Valerie was shown to a suite of rooms, her shackles were removed and she was
  locked in. A glance out the window strengthened the idea of no escape. She
  was only one floor up, but her room was right over the kennels. There were
  a couple big black dogs and she surmised they were probably released to roam
  the grounds at night. Well, she didn't want anything to interfere with the
  kids getting the money and the house so just resigned herself to a painful
  death. Would it be today? Tomorrow? She didn't have a clue but there was no
  sense worrying about it because she had made her choice. 
The woman she had met at the airport came in dressed in a maid's uniform and
  helped Valerie prepare herself. The maid shaved her head and then rubbed her
  scalp vigorously with a very light oil until her pate shone. Her make-up soon
  turned into something very elaborate. Indeed, Valerie thought she'd never worn
  so much make-up. A red, creamy substance was applied to her face in the form
  of an eye mask. By the time the maid had evened it out and applied sparkles
  it was just as if she was wearing a burglar's mask on her face. The cream served
  as eye shadow but her eyes were heavily outlined with eyeliner. Her lips were
  done in a shade of purple that was very thick and shinny and a light blush
  applied to her cheeks. 
She was invited to sit and the maid quickly laced her into a pair of knee
  high boots with heels of at least six inches. Again, shackles were locked on
  her ankles but with a longer chain. No doubt the greater length was allowed
  because of the height of the heels. The maid pulled her to her feet and then
  draped her leather coat over her shoulders. She was accompanied to the head
  of the stairs and then motioned to go down to be met by seven people. 
They Group cheered her arrival among them. There were seven, so she assumed
  that five were men since she already knew two of them were women. All of them
  wore hooded capes and masks. 
&quot;Valerie&quot; said one of the men, &quot;please join us in the parlour
  for a before-dinner drink. We want you to be comfortable and enjoy yourself.&quot; 
Struck with the irony, Valerie replied, &quot;Before you arrange for me to
  die?&quot; 
There was a cold silence, until Valerie herself smiled and added, &quot;Isn't
  that what we are here for? My death? Believe me, ladies and gentlemen, I fully
  understand our arrangement and I will live up to it - er, I guess that should
  be I will live until you end my life.&quot; 
They all seemed to collectively exhale and the man who had made the invitation
  for drinks said, &quot;Quite so. Shall we proceed?&quot; 
And so the eight of them entered a nice, comfortable room, with overstuffed
  chairs and couches. A very nice fire had been laid. As she sat, Valerie attempted
  to close her coat, but one of the women told her to just let it stay open because
  they all wanted to view her new jewellery. Valerie abandoned the attempt to
  close the coat and instead slid forward in the seat and opened her legs so
  her multi-pierced cunt was in full view. The others applauded. 
The other woman spoke, &quot;You seem to have adjusted to your role very well,
  Valerie. Are you just pleased to be providing for your kids, no matter what
  the cost?&quot; 
She was silent for a moment and took a sip of the drink that had been served
  by a butler and replied, &quot;Well, of course, I wouldn't be doing this if
  the money wasn't involved. But I have to tell you that the preparations have
  had an interesting effect on me. I am not suicidal, so I'm not looking forward
  to dying. But your requirements have re-awakened the sexual side of me and
  I admit to enjoying that.&quot; 
The seven turned and murmured among themselves. Finally, the first man spoke. &quot;Is
  it our understanding that you are enjoying yourself at this moment?&quot; 
&quot;Indeed,&quot; she replied. &quot;If you were to look closely, you would
  see my cunt lips are swollen and my pussy is wet. In some way or another I
  have responded to the preparations. As I said, I don't look forward to dying,
  but must admit that the last several weeks have been fun, as is this moment
  now. Now, I have a question, will I die tonight?&quot; 
&quot;Well, that was the deal we originally discussed. You would undergo severe
  treatment at our hands tonight and be assassinated afterwards.&quot; 
&quot;Hmm, I thought so. So when do I begin the process of dying?&quot; 
There was another long pause and then one of the women began, &quot;Valerie,
  we have discovered in you something totally unexpected. In spite of our agreement,
  we expected reluctance on your part, an attempt to escape or get free. Almost
  anything but the emotions and reactions you're displaying now. Would you be
  interested in modifying our agreement?&quot; 
Instantly on guard, Valerie early shouted, &quot;You're not going to take
  the money or the house from my kids, are you?&quot; 
&quot;No, no,&quot; the woman reassured her. &quot;In fact, quite the opposite.
  We had prepared six different scenarios for your death. You would have selected
  a number and it would reveal how you would suffer and die. What we wonder now
  Valerie, is if you would be willing to undergo several of the scenarios and
  we will triple the amount of money your children will receive.&quot; 
With a grin, Valerie reminded them, &quot;But I can die only once, can't I?&quot; 
&quot;That is true,&quot; the woman agreed. &quot;But we can stop any of the
  scenarios just short of death. You will die, but you won't know ahead of time
  which scenario will result in your actual death.&quot; 
&quot;What's the catch?&quot; Valerie replied. &quot;You can do that anyway.&quot; 
There was a collective gasp. &quot;Valerie,&quot; one of the men spoke, &quot;you
  doubt our honesty?&quot; 
At that response, Valerie laughed out loud and the others, realizing the faux
  pau, joined in the laughter. 
When they all settled down, a second round of drinks was served and, while
  Valerie lighted another cigarette, the man continued, &quot;What I meant is
  that we are honourable. We contracted with you to settle on your children a
  sum of money in return for which for which you would be tortured and killed.
  We are offering to increase the sum for which you will be tortured up to three
  times the original amount, with death resulting as previously agreed.&quot; 
Valerie drew deeply on her cigarette. The idea of her kids getting triple
  the amount she had been willing to die for really appealed to her. And then
  her new found sexuality settled the issue for her. She had an orgasm right
  there in front of them all, cigarette in hand. It might not have been the biggest
  one she'd ever had but there was no denying that it had been an orgasm. &quot;Well,&quot; she
  said, &quot;I guess THAT just settles it. When do we start?&quot;

Cemented Chapter 2 
In this chapter, Valerie faces one of her death scenes. Will
  it be the end? Read on. 
(Leather, leather and more leather � and cement) 
Valerie learned that she was not going to be stressed every day
  until she dropped or otherwise expired. Indeed, it was three days before she
  had anything happen to her. In the meantime, she had the run of the place,
  nude and with shackles. Not surprisingly, she found a huge library of erotic
  material: videos, books, magazines and some drawings. She was not surprised
  that she got very wet as she viewed or read any of the stuff. 
On the third day, she spent some time thinking about her future.
  She knew she was not going to leave this property alive; yet, at the same time,
  she was looking forward to her ordeals. If they were going to be anything like
  the dinner conversation that first night, she could see herself going out in
  a blaze of glory. And, to her delight, even those thoughts produced a wet pussy.
  She was alive as she had never been before in her life, and her death was probably
  a good idea for she could not see herself ever returning to the Tuesday afternoon
  bridge games with the ladies. She giggled at a scene that popped into her mind:
  handing out gas masks so the ladies would not be overcome by her pussy odors. 
The maid entered when she heard Valerie moving around the room.
  Her toilet was elaborate. The maid shaved her head as well as her pussy to
  get rid of any stubble. Her make up wasn't as elaborate as it was that night
  for the dinner, but it was still striking. 
The maid then urged her towards a pile of stuff. Most of it was
  leather, and Valerie inhaled the sweetness. The maid then began to wrap a different
  leather corset around her. The front was hooked and then the maid began to
  draw on the laces, methodically from top down and then from bottom up, meeting
  at the middle. Very quickly, Valerie began to feel her breath shorten. Still,
  when the corset was tied off, she knew she had been more tightly laced in the
  past. The maid then inserted wired probes in her pussy and asshole. Valerie
  had just read about electro punishment the night before so she figured these
  out right away. The maid carefully taped the wires to Valerie's belly and back. 
Leather trousers were next but they came to just below her knees
  and then the boots that rose to meet the bottoms of the trousers. There were
  two straps heading downward on each trouser leg and two buckles at the tops
  of the boots. These were fastened. The next item was a huge collar that came
  down to the top of her boobs and held her head rigidly. This was laced up the
  back, but not so tight that she had trouble breathing. She was wordlessly invited
  to insert her hands into the sleeves of a leather strait jacket, and very quickly,
  she was thoroughly secured with her arms crossed in front of her. Finally,
  the inevitable hood. This had no eye holes but a sort of glycine substance
  was at her eye level so she could look out but not see very clearly. The hood
  had no nose holes. There was a moderate opening at the mouth. Into this opening,
  a hose was inserted that protruded into her mouth about an inch. Breathing
  was comfortable. She next felt some sort of coat or cape draped over her shoulders
  and then the maid took her hand and led her out of the room and downstairs.
  She was comfortable in the heel height. 
One of the men told her of her ordeal for the day, and probably
  the whole night also. She was going to be buried alive. She thought to herself
  that this wasn't likely to be the end but it still rattled her a bit to hear
  her sentence. She didn't think she was claustrophobic but she'd soon know.
  After being tightly strapped above and below her tits, at her wrists and knees,
  and just above her ankles, she was backed into some sort of shell, facing forward.
  She knew she was closely confined because she could feel sides of something
  on either side of her body. Once she was in the shell to the satisfaction of
  the group, the shell was lowered so that she was laying on her back. Somebody
  was messing around at her crotch but she suspected they were wiring her. Then
  she sensed that a lid was placed on her shell. There was a small window for
  her to look out. The hose into her mouth was twisted a bit. She felt the lid
  being nailed to the shell. It occurred to her she was in a wooden box � an
  old fashioned casket. 
And then she was picked up and placed on some sort of device
  which turned out to be a cart. She was rolled quite a distance. She knew they
  had gone outdoors. 
In time the parade stopped. It sounded as if straps were being
  wrapped around her coffin. Soon, she felt the coffin move and she knew the
  whole shebang was airborne, and then the casket seemed to be lowering. That
  was confirmed when she saw the dirt sides of her grave begin to appear above
  her. Too soon, she felt her coffin settle on the ground at the bottom of the
  hole. Then she began to feel thuds on her casket. She could barely make out
  that members of the Group were shoveling dirt in on top of her casket. Soon
  her face plate was covered and, as the depth of the dirt above her grew, the
  sounds became muffled and then she could no longer hear anything. It was then
  she noticed that the hose in her mouth was permitting her to breath. Until
  this moment, she didn't know if she was claustrophobic or not. Fortunately,
  it seemed she wasn't. 
So she simply lay there. A hose provided air. She had been told
  this would last all day and possibly all night. My goodness, what the hell
  would she do? She knew the answer to that: nothing What about pissing and shitting?
  That answer was obvious: she would hold it. 
How long had she been down here? Time had no meaning to her.
  She could barely move her fingers and that was about all. She could breathe
  and she could THINK. And so she thought. By now, her kids should have been
  able to read her letters. She wondered what they would think. She had hoped,
  when she wrote them, that she would have been dead by now so that she wouldn't
  have had to think about them. She knew too that a search would be made for
  her, but she doubted very much that anyone would ever find her. 
She was startled when she felt a tingling in her pussy, followed
  swiftly by an alternating tingling in her asshole. Ah, those wired things her
  maid had inserted. With the tingling to help her pass the time, this might
  not be so bad after all. But after what seemed like ages, the tingling in her
  pussy had not gained any speed. She was stimulated but not near the edge and
  with no movement possible, she knew there wouldn't be any way for her to get
  off unless the current was increased. 
The current was not increased 
. 
She lay there, in her coffin. Her pussy and ass hole were alive,
  but she was not terribly excited. She found that she couldn't even squeeze
  her pussy as if a nice sized cock was fucking her. Oh, this was going to be
  major FRUSTRATION. She was pretty certain the Group was not going to let her
  die from this ordeal, but she hadn't counted on them teasing her to death.
  DAMN she thought: why can't I get off? Even a little cum would be nice. 
Even if the wires in her cunt and asshole did not bring her off,
  they did induce the need to pee. With the plug in her cunt she had no choice
  but to hold it. This produced what the electrical current could not: a moderate
  cum. Normally, she liked to thrash around when she had a cum, but there was
  no way she could thrash the way she was secured, so she just let it sweep over
  her. 
In time, Valerie became drowsy. The air was slightly warmed and
  her coffin was not cold. On a scale of one to ten, with one being painfully
  uncomfortable and ten being completely comfortable, she could say a two or
  three for sure. 
She awakened with a start. She was disorientated and then she
  recalled where she was. What was wrong??? 
The air! 
There was no air coming in the hose! 
Damn! Were they really going to kill her off in this first ordeal?
  How could she have been so stupid to believe otherwise? And then there was
  air. What had happened? Was her air supply in jeopardy? And then the lassitude
  of nothing to do again overcame her and she slept. The tiny tingling in her
  cunt and asshole continued, and she felt good about it, but knew it wouldn't
  keep her awake. 
Again she awoke with no air. She panicked. She gasped and sucked
  on the tube in her mouth but no luck. No air meant unconsciousness. She began
  to feel woozy. And then, again, there was air. It came to her that the Group
  had decided to interfere with her air supply as an additional element of her
  ordeal. She mentally smiled � these people were indeed devious. 
Twice more her air supply was interrupted. She could not help
  panicking, and so each such event was marked by perspiration and total fright. 
Again she drifted off but she awakened to something different.
  Her air supply was constant so what was it. It wasn't until a light began to
  break through the dirt at her window that she managed to realize they were
  digging her up! She had survived.

Cemented Chapter 3 
In this chapter, Valerie faces another one of her death scenes.
  Will it be the end? Read on. 
This morning Valerie awakened very early and she showered and
  shaved her head and pussy before the maid arrived. The maid applied moderate,
  day-time make-up. And then led her to a huge pile of clothes. She knew it was
  useless to try to engage the maid in conversation, still, she commented about
  how much clothing and the maid seemed to nod. The first item of clothing was
  a leather corset. Naturally, the maid did the tightening, and she was very
  efficient today, closing it a good deal more than her first night. When it
  seemed there was no chance of tightening it anymore, she did. By this time,
  Valerie was breathing in very small gasps. The corset held her rigidly erect
  with her tits uncovered but cradled nicely. Next, the maid dressed her legs
  in very heavy cotton hose and efficiently gartered the hose to the corset.
  Next, the maid introduced a neck corset that cupped her chin and came down
  her chest. When the maid had tightened it, her neck was rigid but breathing,
  even with two corsets, she found to be okay after her body became used to the
  items. 
The maid produced a stool and Valerie sat while the maid introduced
  her feet to some very high boots, thigh high it turned out, and then proceeded
  to lace them up her leg.. When Valerie was assisted to her feet by the maid,
  she found that these were the highest heels she had ever worn. While not quite
  ballet heels, there was a huge platform under her toes so that she now literally
  towered over the maid. She was uncertain how she would be able to walk in them..
  As she stood there, the maid produced a skirt that wrapped around her, and
  Valerie knew she was not going to walk anywhere as the skirt, when zipped closed
  by the maid, was very snug around her legs. She was in a leather hobble skirt.
  The maid very carefully fixed jewelry in her nipples � these were U shaped
  with a bar through her nipples across the tops. The maid then hung nice little
  weights to each of them. They weren't heavy but Valerie would know they were
  there. 
The maid then fixed a pair of swimmer's goggles over her bald
  head and fitted them very carefully. She then seemed to put some sort of substance
  over the edge of each eye piece. Valerie wondered what the hell was going on,
  but said nothing. The maid then introduced a gag like item to her. Valerie
  had to open her mouth very wide. The gag kept her mouth open for she could
  not close her mouth once it was in behind her teeth. Valerie noted in the mirror
  that her mouth was now just another hole in her body. The maid then held up
  a leather glove � opera length with fifteen tiny pearl buttons at each wrist
  that the maid had to use a hook to close after they had both struggled to get
  each glove on Valerie's arms, all the way up to her armpits. The maid then
  held up a single arm sheath for Valerie to see. Valerie nodded and put her
  arms behind her back. She felt the single glove being pulled up her arms by
  the maid. The straps went over her shoulders, the strap over her left shoulder
  crossed over to her right side where it was buckled; similarly the strap over
  her right shoulder crossed to the left side and buckled, after which both straps
  were tightened to bring the glove as high up her arms as it would go. The maid
  then began the process of lacing the glove closed in back. Slowly, Valerie's
  arms were drawn together but when the maid stopped tightening, she knew she
  wasn't laced as she had been other times meaning she would probably wear the
  damn thing for a longer period. 
The last thing the maid held up was a sort of cloak, but one
  with no sleeves and long enough to cover her from shoulder to ground. The maid
  dressed her and then stepped behind Valerie. Valerie did not know what was
  happening, but soon the maid stepped to her front and motioned for Valerie
  to back up. Valerie was totally confused but detected some sort of platform
  under her boots. The maid continued to urge her to shuffle backwards until
  Valerie felt her boot heels stop against something solid. The maid nodded,
  and then began to wrap straps around her legs just at the crotch. Valerie thought
  she was going to fall backwards as the strap was tightened but then felt some
  sort of post behind her. Very quickly, the maid wrapped straps around Valerie
  at the boobs, knees and ankles. Finally, the maid opened the door of the armoire
  to reveal the full length mirror. 
What Valerie saw was a shaven head (hers, of course) with her
  mouth held open by a ring and the rest of her covered in leather and strapped
  to a device to move her. There were small wheels at either side of her heels
  and she was tilted slightly. The maid then stepped behind her and tilted her
  even further so that she was essentially looking at the ceiling and pushed
  her to the stairs. There, two of the men stepped forward and began the journey
  downward, with a bump each time the wheels went over the edge of a step. As
  the descent continued, Valerie wondered what the Group had in mind for her
  today. She had to admit it had been okay so far. She sort of hoped her ultimate
  death wouldn't come too soon. 
Once again she was greeted with enthusiasm by the Group. She
  wondered what time they got up. She didn't have a clock in her room so she
  didn't know that she had yet to arrive for breakfast before 10:30 AM. Gagged
  as she was, she was barely able to be understood as she asked �Nu breahast
  , huh?' she asked. They all nodded. �ell, den,' she said, �less ge started
  so I kin ge bac eat.' 
�Aren't you concerned that this might be your final day?' one
  of the men asked. 
She nodded, �Yah, I taght o dat everryday, bu aftuh at hirst
  deal, I jis don hink abou dying. In fac, I foun his be a very good ime.' 
The others smiled at one another and nodded. And then they got
  up and wheeled Valerie with them. Out of the house they went and moved around
  to the far side of the garage. When they stopped, she was able to see the top
  of a winch nearby. A leather harness was fixed to her body as soon as she was
  unstrapped from the push cart. Soon, she felt she was being hoisted, and then
  she was lowered as she was steered in a different direction. She knew she had
  been lowered into a vat of something pliable but thick. Cement again, she thought
  as her feet came to rest. The hook in her harness held her upright. Once again,
  they waited. What the fuck, Valerie asked herself, is going on. All of a sudden,
  there was an awful stench. Now what? While they waited, somebody put some putty
  like substance in her ears and in her nostrils, effectively sealing them. And
  then she figured it out: she was going to spend time in a septic tank. That
  thought was followed with the very alarming thought � with my mouth open! She
  was slowly raised again, with a very heavy weight on her feet and then she
  felt herself being lowered. Then when she no longer felt the drag of the cement
  on her feet and legs, her lowering stopped. In the meantime, she felt liquid
  seeping into her pussy, her ass, the tips of her gloves and around her tits.
  The stench was turning her stomach. 
One of the men said �Valerie, you are now standing in the septic
  tank. The level of the shit and piss and muck is just below your ring gag.
  A vulgar explanation of hell described just such a scene with very many people
  standing at the same height. One was whispering: Don't anyone move. In your
  case, we will leave the hook in your harness so that you won't fall but it'll
  be your choice how much of this stuff you ingest. You will notice that right
  now, the level is just below your mouth. That is the constant level; however,
  if a toilet is flushed or a shower is taken or anyone runs the water in the
  house for any length of time, the level in the tank will rise however much
  and then will slowly recede to the level it's at now. Good luck. Oh, don't
  worry about breakfast � we don't think you'll want any after a few hours in
  here.' 
Valerie's worst fear was true. No matter how hard she tried,
  she knew she was probably going to drink and eat shit and piss and muck. At
  any rate, she thought, this, too, would probably not be a death scene, no matter
  how much she might want it. And then she retched. She didn't feel it coming � the
  stench must have really gotten to her. Most of the vomit went out through the
  ring gag but not all, and all she could do was swallow. Yuck. 
She had been there like that maybe twenty minutes when a pipe
  right over her head discharged water and other stuff but probably not shit
  on the top of her shaven skull. As she was warned, the level came up. She tried
  to push her head back but all that accomplished was that the stuff in the tank
  filled her mouth when the level got that high and she had to swallow it all. 
It had happened so fast, she didn't really notice what she did
  until she noticed the burning in her mouth. Double yuck! And this was to go
  on for a couple hours? A few minutes later, someone either did a double flush
  or two different people flushed at the same time. This time there was solid
  matter and it hit her on her bald head, and then flowed over her head , by
  her ears, to the general stuff. Helplessly, she stood there as the stuff all
  around her flowed into her mouth. She had no way to prevent it from entering
  her mouth and so she swallowed. 
Three different toilets flushed very close together. The level
  of the stuff went above her mouth, right up to her nose. She gulped, and her
  mouth remained full. Awrgh. This was awful. Maybe she should just give up the
  ghost and sink but when she tried, she found the hook in her harness held her
  up. She was doomed she realized. And so, she found herself ingesting all sorts
  of things. She could avoid the larger turds, but not the small ones. 
A couple more flushes fell on her head. One item did not feel
  like a turd, and when it fell off her head, she saw to her horror that it was
  a used tampon. Oh how she struggled to avoid it. She was successful as it seemed
  to float on past her ring gagged mouth. And then she was busy again with more
  flushes. She had learned to close her eyes when she felt poop hitting her head.
  Even with the goggles on, she did not like to see the gooey shit dribbling
  down over her eyes. But she knew immediately she had made a dreadful mistake � somehow
  the tampon had passed through the ring and she had the icky damn thing in her
  mouth. She tried mightily to force it back out but two flushes in a row had
  raised the level of the shit/piss/muck very close to her nose so she knew she
  would have to swallow. She did. She wondered if she would retch again. She
  didn't � but she did feel the most amazing thing: she had a cum. Not the greatest,
  but very good just the same. What the hell, she asked herself, I cum while
  I swallow some bitch's used tampon? What the hell is happening to me? And she
  had another cum. 
Shortly after what seemed a very long time, she felt the winch
  begin to lift her out of the septic tank. The Group was all present. When she
  was totally out, a breeze came through and she got a breath of clean air � she
  had gotten used to the stench! She knew she was again standing on the cart
  when she was again strapped to the pole. The Group wheeled her away. Later,
  the maid came to her, dressed in a rubber suit. She used a garden hose to try
  to wash off the shit and muck. She felt an air hammer begin work on the cement
  block on her legs and feet, and soon she was totally free of the encumbrance. 
And then she was wheeled into a small room.

Cemented Chapter 4 
In this chapter, Valerie faces one of her death scenes. Will
  it be the end? Read on. 
Valerie was confused. She had assumed she would be undone and
  released to await another ordeal on another day. This time things seemed to
  be different. She had been placed in a small building after the maid (in a
  full latex cat suit) had washed off the worst of the shit, but she was still
  bound in her smelly leather and secured to the push cart. And then some bright
  lights came on, and she immediately puzzled it all out. She was in a drying
  room. The bright lights were heat lamps and soon her leather would begin to
  dry on her and to her. 
The heat felt good at first. The moisture in the leather was
  cooling her and the heat warmed her. But then, the heat became very hot and
  her leather was drying, and shrinking!!! The boots were getting tighter on
  her feet. The single glove containing her now fully asleep arms seemed to be
  tightening for her shoulders were being pulled back. So far, the heat hadn't
  penetrated the cloak but she knew it soon would and with it, the corset would
  tighten. She wished she could close her mouth but no way. The lights went off. 
The maid, still clothed in the latex cat suit, entered and began
  to remove the straps holding her to the cart. Then she removed Valerie's cloak.
  After that, the single glove was removed. Valerie's arms just hung at her side
  as she was unable to move them. The maid began to vigorously massage Valerie's
  arms and very quickly the increased circulation brought first the tingling
  sensation and then movement. Her gloves were removed as was the corset. Valerie
  nearly collapsed, but the maid supported her until Valerie grew accustomed
  to the situation. The maid put leather cuffs on Valerie's wrists and then caused
  a couple hooks to lower from above. These were fixed to her wrist cuffs and
  very soon Valerie's arms were rising towards the ceiling. When her boots left
  the floor, all her weight was suspended by her wrists. She had liked this position
  when she and here husband had played, and she still liked it. She felt the
  maid remove her boots and hose. So there she hung. There was still a terrible
  odor but even that lessened when the maid removed her clothing from the building.
  The maid returned and fixed cuffs to Valerie's ankles, and very soon Valerie
  was in an X position as the ropes on her ankles drew her legs apart and the
  ropes on her arms were also pulled to the sides. Not too bad, yet, Valerie
  thought. Then the maid applied a soft brush to her body. It was soapy and the
  maid gently scrubbed her body. It almost tickled, but it felt grand, and the
  odor was becoming a bad memory. Because Valerie was suspended off the floor,
  the maid had to use a long handled brush to get to Valerie's face and bald
  head. 
After rinsing her with a gentle, warm spray, Valerie was lowered
  and the ropes were removed. The maid removed the putty from her ears and nostrils,
  and the gag. Although a long soak in a tub filled with warm water and bubbles
  would have been her choice, Valerie had to admit she felt much better. And
  then the maid motioned for Valerie to follow. Out of the small building they
  went and began to walk towards the house, Valerie still nude. 
When they reached the house, Valerie discovered the whole group
  gathered. But there was a major difference � all were nude except all wore
  hoods. The two women had average figures � nothing spectacular but still nice.
  The men were very different. The cocks of two of them were very tiny indeed.
  One was not circumcised. Two others had moderate sized cocks. One was a little
  larger and one was � only one way to describe it � horse sized. 
She was asked how she felt. 
�You mean my stomach, don't you? Ugh But it was worth it - I
  had a nice cum.' 
The Group laughed. �And I survived another ordeal,' Valerie added
  after she had lighted a proffered cigarette. Again, she noticed the members
  of the group looked uncomfortable. She again wondered what that was about. 
One of the women interrupted her thoughts with another proposition.
  Our plan was to put you through one ordeal and then kill you. With your agreement,
  we increased the number of ordeals, and this morning you told us that were
  beginning to like what was happening to you. We will offer you an additional
  ordeal, with an appropriate additional payment to your sons, that will not
  be life threatening but you might wish you might want to die. We would like
  to whip you very severely. Are you interested? 
Wow, Valerie thought, as she drew deeply on her cigarette. A
  whipping. Severe. It wouldn't be a death likely act but could she handle it? �When
  would you like my answer?' Valerie asked, stalling for time. 
She was told to take all the time she wanted to think about it
  but that she had to give her answer within five minutes. 
Why the rush, she wondered, and then she figured out they wanted
  to do it immediately while she was recovering from her shit bath and meal.
  So, she again drew deeply on her cigarette, snubbed it out viciously, and said, �Let's
  do it.' 
So, shortly, she was secured on a whipping bench. The device
  had a curved upright so that when she was secured to it, her back bowed concavely.
  It was not extreme, but it would hold her fully open for a whipping. The one
  benefit was that the tip of the whip could not curl around her. She had been
  whipped before but, somehow, she figured this was going to be worse, much worse. 
It WAS. She was on the special device as her ass was beat to
  what had to be a bloody mess. All seven of the Group had participated. They
  had used shoe soles, paddles, quirts, tawses, cains, even hickory sticks. And,
  yes, she had let them know how each stroke felt. Shit and piss were frequent
  descriptions but motherfucker, bastard, pervert were also heard. 
After what seemed an endless ordeal with constant pain, she was
  released from the device and secured with her hands over her head. She could
  move but that was a mixed blessing. She was told the next item was a bull whip.
  She had never been whipped before with a bull whip and had no idea how it would
  feel. With the first stroke, she knew it would be a bitch but since her legs
  were not secured, she could dance around. Still the bull whip seemed to get
  her no matter what she did. If she did not move, the whip mostly got her back
  with the occasional wrap-around. If she danced, the whip went everywhere. She
  knew she was being heavily marked. Her howling had diminished to merely a whimper
  or a grunt with each stroke. 
And then she exploded. She hadn't felt it coming, but when the
  tip of the whip hit her clit, she just erupted. She went off the ground. She
  spun. Thankfully, the Group just stared at her in amazement. They had all seen
  women under the whip have cums before but this was classic, a new level of
  sexual response. 
When she finally calmed down, with both feet on the ground, the
  whipping resumed, relentlessly. Valerie had passed into another world. She
  knew the whip was falling on her back, her front, her legs and even her arms.
  She knew they hurt, but she was like a spectator at her own whipping. She observed
  herself react to each stroke � not with any vigor but more an automatic response
  as if saying I'm still alive. Your fucking whip hurts, but I can live through
  it. Keep it up. She had begun to arch her back outward so that the whip could
  strike more of her skin. 
The Group had exchanged the whip among them so that each had
  applied several strokes. They too knew that Valerie was now challenging them,
  and they tried to meet her challenge. Each of them was now swinging with all
  their strength. Still, Valerie absorbed their strength and seemed to be drawing
  stronger herself. Intuitively, they knew she could not last forever, so they
  were not concerned that they couldn't whip her to death, if they chose. But
  they had to admire her spunk, her stamina, and her sexuality. 
Eventually, the whipping did stop. She had been severely punished
  but she sensed they weren't done with her. Indeed, the Group still had other
  plans for her, and they wanted her to survive. Besides, her back now looked
  about like her ass. In addition, there were livid welts across her tits, and
  the front and back of her thighs. 
She was lowered and helped to lie down, face down, on a chaise
  lounge. She startled them, saying, �Is that all? Well, if you're all done,
  I'll have a drink and a smoke.' 
�You want more?� one of the women asked. 
�Let me put it to you this way,� Valerie began, �I have been
  severely beaten before. I'm terrified at the beginning and I really can't handle
  the pain, but I know I have to as there is really nothing else I can do. And,
  as the beating continues, and the endorfins click in, I pass deeply into sub
  space. And that is when my body begins to tingle to the kiss of whatever is
  being used to punish me.� 
Stunned silence for a while, and then the same woman asked, �So
  what do you want to do?� 
Valerie rose and said, �String me up again.� 
And it was done. This time, six of them watched while one of
  the woman handled the bull whip. She seemed to have more expertise. She pulled
  the whip back, snapped it and sent it forward to Valerie's back. It was a mighty
  blow, and Valerie felt the shock and re-bounded. After a few steps back and
  forth, Valerie became calm again, and just then the whip cracked again and
  touched her back like a red-hot poker. She screamed and wobbled on her feet,
  but managed to control herself again only to hear the crack and feel the whip
  again. This kept up for quite a while. There would be a stroke, and then Valerie
  would be trying to master her sensations, and then she would re-position herself.
  Valerie had begun to moan, sort of a low hum, but on a stroke, she screamed
  and just collapsed in her bounds. 
One of the men rushed to her, but by the time he got even with
  her, she stirred and began to hoist herself into position. He looked at her
  anxiously and asked, �Enough?� 
She shook her head, and the whipping continued. There was blood
  all over her back. Some places, where strokes crossed other strokes, blood
  was running in rivulets. But the whipping continued. The others had moved back
  because they had begun to be spattered with Valerie's blood. 
A second time she collapsed. No one moved. This time there was
  no effort by Valerie to regain her feet. �Enough,� she managed to whisper,
  but her whipper hit her again and yet again. And then she coiled her whip. 
Very tenderly, two of the men released her and laid her face
  down on her chaise lounge. Then, one began to gently soak the blood away with
  distilled water. The blood stopped flowing but her back was a real mess. With
  care, she was carried to her room and laid face down on her bed. The Group
  left but her maid entered and began to treat her wounds. She applied a yellowish
  salve very lightly to the whip marks, and then she left. 
Valerie slept but woke up near supper time. She started to rise
  but quickly collapsed as her body was stiff, especially her back. Nevertheless,
  she made another effort and managed to stand. Fortunately, she had grabbed
  the chair for as soon as she stood, she got dizzy. She held on to the chair
  and the dizziness passed. She reached out for a nearby table and got dizzy
  again, although less. She hung on for a while yet, and then moved again. No
  dizziness this time. So she began the walk downstairs. 
The Group was having cocktails and were utterly startled to see
  her when she entered the room. 
�What? No drink for me?�

Cemented Chapter 5 
This Chapter is different in that Valerie wrote about it herself
  afterwards. Obviously, she didn't die in this ordeal but she might have wished
  she had as it was going on. 
One of my many torture fantasies is to undergo the water torture.
  Somehow the thought of lying stretched out having water forced down my throat
  has a strange and perverse attraction to it. I underwent this torment at the
  hands of the Group. I am more than ever sure that one of the men is probably
  a doctor and another is a nurse and they insured that I wasn't permanently
  harmed. I say that in retrospect for it was by no means certain to me at the
  time. 
It started by me being stripped naked on the patio. Then I was
  given a stack of leather gear to wear. I had a leather bodice to cover my tits.
  The boots were elegant like some of the thigh highs I had. I had help lacing
  them, and of course they were six inch heels. Long kid gloves covered my arms
  from fingertip to arm pit. Finally, I got to wear a leather great coat, one
  that came down to my ankles. I was positioned in a chair and the usual box
  was placed at my feet. But this time, there were boxes for my hands too. I
  thought that was novel. Very quickly the cement was poured in the boxes. 
While the cement was setting, putty plugs were placed in my nostrils
  so I could not breathe through my nose. I found afterwards that you cannot
  vomit if you cannot breathe through your nose. Furthermore, it forces you to
  drink whatever is poured into your mouth in order to get air. To keep my mouth
  open, a large ring gag was placed in my mouth and fastened tightly behind my
  head. This was horribly uncomfortable as only after a few minutes my jaws were
  aching. By this time, the cement had set and I was pulled to my feet. My cemented
  hands just hung at my sides � I suppose there was a weight of twenty or so
  pounds on each hand. I could bear up under the weight but I sure couldn't lift
  my hands. The chair was pulled away from behind me and I was leaned against
  and secured to a long ladder. After all the arrangements were complete, my
  head was slightly elevated above my body. 
All in all, I was not uncomfortable. I surely am glad I have
  the leather on my body as it was a bit chilly. One of the ladies told me that
  8 quarts of liquid were being be forced into me. The idea of two gallons of
  liquid in my stomach and bowels and how it would bloat me started to get me
  worried now that I was in position. I have since read that many accounts off
  this torture include this. One change over the original torture was that I
  was not going to drink just plain water, but I would have to consume a sports
  drink that would better preserve the electrolyte balance in my body. In thinking
  back over this, I sort of smile � modern updates for ancient tortures so as
  to care for the patient's body. 
I got nervous as one of the women grabbed my head to steady it
  as one of the men placed the funnel into my mouth. Then he began to pour the
  first pint of liquid. I resisted drinking it for a while, but he was patient
  knowing that I would have to eventually gulp it down simply to breathe. Finally,
  I began to drink it down and I watched him keep pouring more into the funnel.
  The jar was only half empty when I began to feel a burning sensation in my
  chest and the need to get a breath of air began to quickly grow. Yet I had
  to drink more and more liquid that was poured into the funnel. I soon began
  to panic and tried to move my head, but she just grabbed my head tighter. Finally
  the jar was empty and as soon as I could get a breath of air I did, coughing
  and gagging as I did. I coughed and gagged for what seemed to be forever trying
  to catch my breath as the Group watched. While I felt full, my stomach was
  not uncomfortable at this point, although my jaws were killing me. 
I groaned a bit when she grabbed my head and steadied it as he
  put the funnel back into my mouth. I tried to struggle a bit, but my cemented
  hands were less than useless. This time I was convinced that I should drink
  the water as fast as I could to get it over with and when he poured the water
  into my mouth, I gulped it down. But this time he poured the liquid much more
  slowly. There were times when I thought I could catch a breath of air only
  to have another slug of liquid gush into my mouth. About halfway through, I
  again started to get a pain like heartburn as I drank the liquid. By the time
  he was done with the second pint, my stomach felt very uncomfortable and I
  was just beginning to feel nauseated. My jaws felt paralyzed by the gag. At
  this rate, I would still have to consume 14 pints of liquid! 
After a few minutes, the third pint was administered. This was
  poured even more slowly than the second and I got very panicky about half way
  through. Drowning must be a terrible experience because you want air so bad
  and your chest burns so bad, but all you can do is gulp down more fluid and
  hope you survive. My stomach was now really aching and my nausea had increased.
  When I gulped down the last of the liquid, I coughed and gagged for what seemed
  to be forever trying to catch my breath. I could feel the liquid swishing around
  my stomach. Thank goodness I hadn't been made to wear the usual leather corset. 
The eighth pint was really the breaking point in many ways. Now
  to drink this one I had to force the liquid down whereas before I could actually
  say that I was just drinking the liquid down. With every gulp I felt as if
  the previous gulp of liquid wanted to vomit up and out. My feeling of heartburn
  increased to terrible levels and I struggled violently in my cement bonds.
  I felt a horrible pain in my stomach and the pain in my gut overpowered any
  feelings of torment I had previously felt in my jaw. After another coughing
  spell, I was left to lie there a while and all I could do was groan in agony.
  Then I actually felt the water move in my stomach as it forced its way into
  my bowels. I developed cramps in my bowels that were incredibly painful. 
When she grabbed my head yet again, I began to plead for mercy,
  the best I could with a ring gag in my mouth. I began to struggle violently
  and actually moved a bit as he put the funnel in my mouth and began to pour
  the ninth pint of water. I cannot describe the feeling of horrible pain that
  I felt in my chest as it felt like I needed air from the first gulp of liquid.
  This time it seemed to go on and on as I was forced to drink the liquid. Again
  I could feel the movement of liquid in my stomach and bowels as it forced itself
  lower in my system as there wasn't anywhere else for it to go. Also I felt
  for the first time the need to pee. I controlled the urge because I didn't
  want to soil my beautiful leather.. 
I was given a break of several minutes. My stomachache had grown
  to horrible proportions and I know I groaned steadily. The pressure in my bladder
  grew to the point where I couldn't hold it anymore and I pissed and a lot of
  it ran down my booted leg and dripped on to the cement block that contained
  my feet.. 
I panted and growled as loudly as I could as I thrashed about
  violently as the preparations were made for another pint � I had lost track
  so I had no idea how many pints I had consumed. My nausea had reached extreme
  levels and all I wanted to do was barf and barf to relieve the pressure in
  my stomach. As I gulped down the next pint, I was in terrible pain. My stomach
  felt like it was going to explode and I had a horrible ache from my kidneys.
  I was pissing uncontrollably. After I finished yet another pint, I was crying
  and shivering in pain and cold. Then I felt a terrible pain in my lower gut
  and I let out a scream as I had an explosive bowel movement. Rather than easing
  my torment, this just added to my horrible discomfort and embarrassment, and
  I was embarrassed and felt terrible about messing my beautiful leather coat. 
The next pint was administered faster than the others. I thought
  it was much more painful than the others, although I got to breathe quicker.
  The pain grew in my chest to the point where I thought I would die and my pissing
  and uncontrolled bowel movements continued in waves of horrendous cramps. I
  didn't worry about my leathers � I just wanted relief. 
I could only groan as I was afforded another rest. Somehow, I
  managed to scream as I saw what was coming next. The woman tending me held
  a strip of gauze. The idea was that it would be allowed to fall deep in my
  mouth and would promote choking when the liquid began to flow. I cried and
  pleaded as I watched in horror as the gauze was pushed through the funnel so
  that it would enter my mouth. I was screaming as he put the funnel in my mouth
  and began pouring the liquid. I felt the gauze go down my throat as I forced
  the liquid down as fast as I could. I struggled in my bonds as the last of
  the liquid was poured into the funnel. Then I began gagging with the gauze
  in throat. He pulled the now wet gauze out slowly which had me thrashing as
  wildly as I could. It felt like my guts were pulled from my throat, even though
  when it was done I found out that only about a foot of gauze had actually been
  swallowed. 
I was left tied in position for a long time during which I had
  several uncontrolled bowel movements and pissed almost constantly. My cramps
  were horrendous and I was in a pain that was something that I cannot begin
  to describe. 
Finally, they removed the ring gag and helped me to lay me on
  the floor in the fetal position crying and groaning. But the worst was yet
  to come. The wax plugs were removed from my nose and I immediately began to
  vomit. As my stomach cramped to vomit, I also had uncontrolled bowel movements
  so it was coming out of both ends at the same time leaving me laying in a huge
  mess of body wastes. If I thought about my leather at all, it was to be thankful
  I was not laying on a cold cement floor. And then they sprayed me with water � but
  it was warm so it felt oddly good. I was moved to an area where a rubber sheet
  was draped over a bed. They left my feet and hands cemented. 
It was the next day when my hands and feet were chiseled free.
  I was stripped down and taken back into the house to my room where the maid
  was waiting with a hot bath. The bath was incredible, and of course, she shaved
  my head. By late afternoon, I was pretty near back in shape. 
I wanted to impress the Group, so I asked the maid to help me
  dress. I wanted the corset to be tighter than ever. It took a lot of work on
  her part, but she reduced me by an extra half inch. I was panting in small
  gasps but I was certain I could handle the additional constriction. After heavily
  rouging them, I hooked tiny weights into my nipples. They made for a nice pulling
  feeling. Into my ears, I inserted all sorts of studs, some with dangling chains.
  My nose ring was gold. Into my pussy lips, I put more weights. I chuckled when
  I noticed that my cunt lips had swollen already. My boots tonight would be
  the ballet kind. The maid helped me by lacing them for with my corset, there
  was very little bending I could do. 
I put on a long wrap-around leather skirt. It opened enough so
  that my cunt jewelry could easily be seen when I moved my legs. The maid then
  again helped me with my formal, bondage, leather gloves. First, I put a small
  rubber ball in my hand and then balled my fists over them. Then, the gloves
  were pulled up. There were no fingers in the gloves and they fit nicely. Next,
  the maid drew leather corsets up each arm over my kid gloves. These were heavily
  boned. There were straps at the wrists, below and above the elbow and at the
  top. I had no fingers and I could not bend my arms. 
The last item was a splendid leather hood. There were eye holes
  and the maid quickly had it laced tightly to my head. The mouth part had a
  ring gag inside the leather so that all the maid had to do was push it behind
  my teeth and I was done. The maid assisted me on to the hand truck, strapped
  me on, and wheeled me to meet the Group. 
When the Group saw me, they applauded. I was happy and horny.
  I got fucked in my mouth, my cunt and my ass; and I was gloriously tongued
  on cunt and ass. In between, I was even fed some real food.

Cemented Chapter 6 
This morning, when Valerie awakened, she noticed it was a bright,
  sunshiny day. After a luxurious stretch, she then pulled gently on her nipple
  rings. Of course, no surprise to Valerie, the nipples stiffened and stood proudly
  on her chest. And, yes, she knew there was already an increase to the moisture
  of her cunt. Her cunt was moist all the time these days. Yes, she had become
  quite a sexual animal. After glancing at her clock, she decided it was time
  to get up. There were no clothes laid out for her so she presumed the maid
  had just had not had a chance so far. She padded to the lavatory and did her
  morning toilet: shower, brush teeth, etc., and she shaved her head. She had
  become quite adept at doing her head herself but preferred the maid to do it. 
When she exited the bathroom, she noticed there were still no
  clothes laid out. Shrugging, she strolled out of her room and down the stairs.
  Entering the dinning room, she noticed everyone else was dressed in jeans and
  shirts and work boots. 
�C'mon in Valerie,� said one of the men. �We were wondering how
  you'd present yourself this morning. I win,� he chuckled. The others applauded
  as she moved towards the table and the empty chair. 
�Just coffee today,� said another of the men. �You've got a big
  day ahead of you.� 
So Valerie simply drank coffee while the others ate. Finishing
  her third cup, the others finally began to rise and move to the sitting room,
  so she followed. 
When they were all seated with more coffee and some cigarettes,
  one of the men stood up and began: �Today, Valerie, you will be crucified.� 
She blinked, drew deeply on her cigarette and then posed a question, �With
  ropes or nails?� 
�With nails.� 
�What if you hit an artery or a vein � won't I bleed to death.
  Oh, I see .... � 
�No Valerie, this is not necessarily your exit. I will insert
  nails into your hands and feet under a fluoroscope. By using a small, local
  antiseptic, I can carefully insert them to miss everything. We'll then take
  you outside to where you'll then be nailed to your cross.� 
Nobody said anything for a while, but then one of the women said, �You're
  wondering how your hands will be able to hold up your body. Two things will
  help. Your feet will be nailed to a platform set at a forty-five degree angle
  to the center piece and there will be a horn for your ass hole..� 
Valerie nodded her understanding and stood up. �Where do we go
  now?� 
The Group and Valerie moved to a room she had never seen. It
  was like a dispensary. At an indication, Valerie crawled up on the table. Quickly,
  she was secured with straps at wrists, upper arms, neck, chest above and below
  her tits, waist, and legs at thighs, and below knees. Her hands and feet were
  then injected. Within minutes, they were numb. The fluoroscope was moved to
  the table and her left hand was placed on a block of wood under the scope.
  She could see her hand as if in an x-ray. The one man picked up a nail, a spike
  really, about six inches long with a sharpened point. With no wasted motion,
  he began to push it into Valerie's left hand. A small amount of blood came
  up but watching the screen, he wiggled it back and forth, missing bones and
  other important parts of her hand, and then it came through the back of her
  hand. He pushed the nail so that about an inch was protruding. Even quicker,
  the right hand was done. 
Then everything moved to her feet. Again, the fluoroscope was
  positioned and nails were run through both of her feet. The pain shots were
  just wearing off and Valerie became very aware of the nails in her hands and
  feet. 
She was moved out doors on the table. She sure couldn't walk
  with those nails in her feet as they were. Instead of deep into the woods,
  this time they went to where there was a clearing overlooking a large lake
  or river � Valerie couldn't tell from her position on the table. Plus, the
  pain in her hands and feet was really bothering her. At length, the procession
  stopped and the straps holding Valerie to the table were undone. She was then
  carried to her cross, laying flat on the ground. When her back and head were
  aligned with the center post, her arms were stretched out. Then, with two men
  holding her, another used a hammer to hammer the nail in her right hand into
  the wood. Valerie screamed. It took three strokes of the hammer to bring the
  nail head to her hand. Her left hand was then stretched out and it was hammered
  home with just two strokes. 
Valerie was amazed at the pain. It was like nothing she had ever
  before experienced. She was now in the form of a T on her cross. There were
  ropes at the outer ends of the cross bar and two men pulled on each one so
  that her upper body was raised up. At about a thirty degree angle, the lifting
  stopped and the two women stepped forward. Each grabbed a leg and pulled. This
  brought Valerie's body down the center post so that instead of her arms being
  straight out from her body, they were now in the shape of a modified Y. And,
  her feet touched wood. It took more strokes to nail her feet to the platform
  but there she was fully secured. The men on the ropes again began to hoist
  her until she was just about straight up. Somebody moved the base of her cross
  and she was lowered so that her cross was now in a hole. Dirt was shoveled
  in and then wedges were hammered in to hold her upright and straight. Each
  blow to a wedge reverberated through her body. The pain in her hands and feet
  was such that she had no idea if she could cope. 
When the Group had finished crucifying her, they all stepped
  back and faced her. Her body was about three feet off the ground and then up.
  Her eyes were closed as she tried to deal with her situation. But when she
  opened them, there was nobody around. Weren't they going to watch her, she
  wondered. She managed to turn her head to her left, and saw her hand with the
  nail in it securing her to the cross beam. Looking the other way, she saw her
  right hand similarly attached. Although she couldn't see it, she knew the horn
  was in her ass hole, but she tried to keep from sitting on it. Her shoulders
  were a riot of pain. This position was unlike anything she had ever before
  experienced in in her life. She couldn't see her feet, but she sure as hell
  knew they were there. 
Ultimately, she realized she was holding herself up by putting
  her weight on her arms and hands. She knew she couldn't hold herself forever
  so she allowed herself to slide down a bit. This put a new pinch on her nailed
  hands because it changed their angle slightly and the horn went deeper into
  her ass hole. But very quickly she realized this wouldn't work either � hanging
  downward made it increasingly more difficult to breathe. She recalled reading
  somewhere that death on a cross was asphyxiation. She could breathe in okay
  but expelling the carbon dioxide was difficult, so much so that each intake
  of air was less than the one before, and eventually, there would be no room
  to take in air. Realizing this, she heaved herself up by her hands. This helped
  her to expel all the carbon dioxide in her lungs, but it put pressure on her
  feet where all her weight pressed against the nails. So she let herself settle
  on the horn. Of course, this meant her breathing became labored again, and
  made the blood flow from her hands. 
Given her agony, it was hard to tell how long she had been on
  the cross. It may have been fifteen minutes and it may have been an hour or
  more. But still she suffered. And as the pain clouded her brain, she wasn't
  able to tell that she was building to a tremendous orgasm. When it came, she
  withered on her cross and jerked and shook her head, and it went on and on.
  And, as the orgasm passed, the pain came back. She marveled that she was able
  to feel any sexual excitement at all, to say nothing of a cum, and a cum of
  magnificent proportions at that. 
When her eyes were able to focus, she noticed that her maid was
  standing in front of her, looking up at her. 
With a smile on her face, �I was going to ask you how you are
  doing up there, but I just saw you. Is it really as good as that.� 
Valerie blinked, and then said in reply, �Good? My god, the pain
  is incredible, but the cum was in a class by itself. I wouldn't want to do
  this just to get a cum, because I really do hurt, it even hurts to speak to
  you, but with cums like that I could be persuaded to do it again. Only I don't
  know how long I'll be here. It's hard to breathe, you know.� 
�No, I didn't know, � the maid replied. �Why is that?� 
Valerie took a long time to answer during which she heaved herself
  up to expel the carbon dioxide and then settled down again. �See what I mean?� she
  asked. 
Nodding, the maid said, �I think so. It really is suffocating,
  isn't it?� 
�How about the nails? Do you feel them all the time?� 
Again, Valerie took her time replying, and finally said, �No,
  not all the time. My hands and feet are on fire all the time but when I pull
  myself up, I can feel the nails in my feet, and then when I slide back down
  I can feel the nails in my hands.� 
�How long have I been up here?� 
�I'm not supposed to tell.� 
�Huh, why is that?� 
�So you can't make an approximation of time. If I told you that
  you were up there an hour, you would have a reference.� 
�Well,� argued Valerie, �what's wrong with that?� 
�How long do you think you've been on your cross?� 
Valerie replied, �I have no fucking idea. That's what I want
  to know.� 
�Tsk, tsk, it's not a good idea to be cross with those on the
  ground while you are on the cross. Would you like a drink?� 
Pause, then �Yes, please.� 
�Water or wine?� 
�Both please.� 
The maid chuckled but pushed a forked stick up in which a plastic
  tube was held. She put in front of Valerie's mouth and then twisted a nob on
  another plastic tube. Water flowed into Valerie's mouth and she gulped it down.
  Finally, after a long drink, she pulled her mouth off the tube and the water
  sprayed her face. The maid shut off the water and twisted another nob, and
  wine flowed which Valerie captured immediately. 
The maid smiled, and then she turned away and left. 
Valerie called after her, �Wait. Don't go. Please .... � 
And so Valerie was alone again, nailed to her cross. The wine
  was giving her a slight buzz, but she knew she'd have to pee soon. And so she
  just let go, feeling it flowing out of her slit and onto her cross. Of course,
  she couldn't wipe, but she felt better nonetheless. 
And then she heard the bees � oh, shit she thought, what can
  I do about them. Nothing. One of the bees found the blood on her left hand
  and began creeping around. It took all of Valerie's will not to try to pull
  her hand back. She felt other bees on her right hand and on her feet. And then,
  probably because of the wetness, she felt a couple bees, at least, on her shaven
  and ringed pussy. And then she realized she would have to pull herself up to
  breathe. When she did, the bees on her feet and hands stayed with her, but
  the bees at her cunt flew off but not before one of them stung her in indignation.
  She howled but could do nothing for the burning sensation. And so she allowed
  herself to slide down again, and she went on suffering. And as soon as she
  thought �suffering', boom, another cum. What a perverse way for her body to
  behave: a cum when she was suffering the most. 
Time passed. She knew she had been on her cross for a long while
  because the sun was moving around the sky. Where it was at her back when she
  was put up, it was now on her front. And then she noticed a boat on the body
  of water. Could they see her, she wondered. If they could, what would they
  do? She could do nothing to hide herself, of course. What would she say if
  they came to her? She could not tell strangers that she was suffering fatal
  punishments for a film or that eventually she would die. 
And then she noticed the boat had turned toward shore. And, boom,
  another cum. 
The boat came closer and eventually grounded on the shore and
  the people got out � and she saw it was the Group. In quick order, they came
  to her, lowered her cross, and then removed her from it. The nails came out
  so easily she wondered if she couldn't have pulled them out herself. The wounds
  on her hands were clean. Would they heal? Anyhow, she hadn't died, again, so
  she would face at least one more ordeal.

Cemented Chapter 7 
In this chapter, Valerie faces another of her death scenes. Will
  it be the end? Read on. 
Valerie was not put to any efforts for four days after her crucifixion.
  The wounds in her hands and feet were cleaned and stitched closed, and in that
  period had healed a great deal. Her stamina returned as well. Strange to her,
  she had no contact with the Group during the healing time. Her maid changed
  her bandages and checked her wounds each day but that was the extent of her
  contact with anybody except when her meals were delivered. 
On the fourth day, her maid invited her to stand. She winced,
  but found she could indeed put her weight on her feet. Her maid then fitted
  her with a special pair of high heeled boots. When Valerie objected to high
  heels, the maid told her, �Valerie, you are very used to wearing high heels.
  It would be stressful to your feet to go flat now. See, the heel is a modest
  three inches.� 
Valerie extended her foot and the maid drew nylons up her legs
  and then the boots were laced on. When she stood again, she had to admit the
  boots were easier to stand in than in her bare feet. Her maid then helped her
  into a leather, corset like garment that came up over her tits but which had
  cut-outs for her nipples. Very quickly, she was laced in. 
�Would you like gloves and hood?� the maid asked. 
Valerie thought a moment and then said, �Both.� And very quickly,
  the opera length gloves were drawn up her arms to her arm-pits and then the
  hood was on her. �Ah, no gag, at least right now.� 
And there she stood, four days after being nailed to a cross
  for several hours (she still didn't know the exact amount of time) on her feet
  in her fetish garb. She walked around her suite, slowly at first, but then
  with purpose. Along the way, she lighted a cigarette. She looked at herself
  in the mirror and wondered about when this would all end. She readily admitted
  it had been a great time, much better than she would have imagined. She was
  sad that she hadn't learned all these things about herself earlier, but she
  would not attempt to welch on her deal. 
Unbeknownst to Valerie, the Group was then meeting. They had
  agreed that Valerie had presented them with much more than the amusement they
  had sought. Indeed, what they had received for their monetary arrangements
  far exceeded their hopes. Of course, once Valerie had delivered herself to
  them, they could have easily reneged on the money but they were honorable people
  and would not have thought of cheating Valerie out of such a piddling amount.
  Nevertheless, the Group was planning her demise. Just as much as she, they
  too needed a rest for their libidos had been stretched for the several days
  Valerie had been with them. It was agreed that the next episode would be the
  last episode. 
Valerie, of course, was unaware of the Group's plans but she
  was aware that what she now had would end, probably sooner than later. 
The death episode had to be very carefully planned. First of
  all, like all the previous events, it had to be filmed. That had been the whole
  purpose of the exercise and, while they had great footage of Valerie being
  buried alive, crucified, whipped, dunked in a vat of shit, and all the other
  things, they wanted to be true to their purpose. Secondly, if somehow, her
  death was found out, there could be no way blame, or even any connection, could
  come back to them. Her body clearly documented that she been badly treated
  and there were whip marks and her hand and foot wounds. Well, they couldn't
  un-do the wounds and it just wasn't feasible to keep her until everything healed.
  The alternative then was to make the final episode such that her body would
  be more heavily marked than she had endured to date. How? 
Well, they had additional property down river where there was
  a series of rapids with sharp, cutting rocks. That satisfied the marking of
  her body, but it seemed anti-climatic to simply throw her into the river and
  wave bye bye. Ultimately, they settled on a form of the dunking stool used
  to detect witchcraft. She would be secured in a heavy, metal chair. The heavy
  chair would be at one end of a long pole capable of supporting her weight.
  By balancing the beam on a fulcrum, the chair (with her strapped to it) could
  be lifted up and then swung out over the river, and then the chair could be
  lowered and raised to dunk her. They could vary the amount of time she stayed
  under so that she could demonstrate some distress, and ultimately, they just
  wouldn't lift her out of the water. Subsequently, they would recover the body
  and then throw it into the river to allow the rocks to have their will with
  her body. Chances were excellent that she'd never be found, but if she was,
  the river would have hidden all signs of her rough treatment and she'd just
  be considered a drowning victim. 
The next day, Valerie again found no clothes so she surmised
  she was to appear nude again. She was bored with the healing routine. Her hands
  and feet were fine and the whip marks on her back had faded to barely perceptible
  lines. Down she went. She was surprised for the Group today was only six. 
Breakfast was a gala affair with champagne and a heavily laden
  table. There was much chattering. Valerie didn't notice that while everyone
  had loaded their plates, the Group didn't seem to be eating much. She enjoyed
  herself. The absence of one of the members of the Group was explained that
  an emergency had come up that only he could attend to. She suspected it might
  have been the doctor person but she couldn't be sure. 
After the dishes were cleared away and smoking had begun, one
  of the Group's men said to Valerie, �Today, we are going to see if you are
  a witch.� 
This led Valerie to smile because she knew what he meant. �So,
  it's the dunking chair today? Well, I suppose I could do with another bath.
  When do we start?� 
�Right now,� was the reply and the Group members were just a
  fraction of second faster, rising to their feet. They all piled into two SUV's
  and drove off. 
�We aren't going to use the river?� Valerie asked. 
There was only a grunt of a reply and Valerie experienced her
  first stab of trepidation, but said nothing more. The other property was only
  a short distance and equally secluded. As they walked along towards the river,
  a muffled roar began to increase until they cleared the woods near the river.
  The rapids gave the river an entirely different appearance than the placid
  water at the other location. This scared Valerie all the more, but she was
  resolved not to give vent to her apprehension. She rationalized that this day
  had been bound to come. 
Very quickly, she was secured to the chair with ropes above and
  below her boobs, at her wrists and upper arms, thighs and ankles. Then, the
  four men present bore down on their end of the pole and lifted Valerie off
  the ground. Very swiftly, her chair was swung out over the river. She had no
  sooner stopped swinging when down she went into the churning water. She hadn't
  readied herself and swallowed a bit of water which brought on a coughing spasm
  when she was lifted out of the water. They waited until she had stopped coughing
  before lowering her into the water a second time. This time she was prepared,
  and had no trouble. She smiled at them when she was raised up. 
The smile was a shock to all. They understood that somehow she
  had figured out that this would be the end of her. And she was lowered again. 
But this time down, she got a surprise � there was someone there!
  A figure in a wet suit appeared right in front of her and held a finger to
  the face plate of the tube in the mouth to indicate to say nothing. This figure
  (she couldn't tell if it was male or female) then began to use a small cutter
  to work on strands of the ropes holding her. The rope wasn't being cut at once;
  rather, the ropes were being cut strand by strand so that the rope would appear
  to have snapped. Before the figure had finished, she was yanked to the surface
  again. She had been down longer than before and needed to clear her nose. 
What was going on, she wondered. The Group clearly intended to
  end her life here, but this rubber suit person was trying to release her from
  the chair and, presumably, save her. The question was: did she want to be saved.
  Eventually, she concluded that she would accept saving if it happened. The
  Group was responsible for her predicament now, and if they had failed to properly
  secure her, that was their problem. What she might do if she didn't die today
  she put aside to consider if and when. 
Two more dunkings occurred. Each time the rubber suit frayed
  the ropes more. Finally, with the light fading, the men lowered Valerie and
  walked away from the boom. It came to Valerie that this was it, she wasn't
  coming up, at least on the chair. The rubber suit quickly released her from
  her ropes, transferred the breathing tube to her mouth, and then pulled her
  away from the chair. They had to swim under water quite a distance before they'd
  be out of sight of the Group, but Valerie, a strong swimmer, helped herself
  a great deal. At last they entered some weeds along the far shore and surfaced
  just enough to get a breath. The rubber suit then became clear to her as a
  man, but not someone she knew. He gave her a tube and together they sank below
  the surface and stayed there a couple hours to make sure the Group had left.
  Besides, her personal attitude had changed considerably: even though this man
  had rescued her from death, she figured she didn't owe him a thing � she hadn't
  asked him to do what he had done. What he had done had been his own doing and
  for his benefit. 
Meanwhile, the Group had hoisted the chair. When they saw she
  was no longer in the chair, they brought it quickly to shore. They looked at
  the frayed ropes and wondered, but it was easy to convince them the water had
  caused it. They did take time to walk downstream on the river bank to see if
  she might have been carried to shore. After a mile, after the end of the rapids,
  they stood and stared at the river, and concluded that Valerie was no more.
  They thought her body might wash up but even that did not concern them. They
  trudged back to the SUV's, dismantled the camera equipment and left. 
It was full dark when Valerie and the rubber man climbed up out
  of the river on the opposite bank. He led her inland a few paces where there
  were towels and some clothing. Valerie had not worn clothes, other than leather
  of some sort, since she had arrived in the company of the Group, and she was
  pleased to see that this pile for her was no different, including lace up,
  high-heeled boots. 
�Why did you do that?� she asked. 
�Do what?� he replied. 
�Oh, shit, you know fucking well what � save me.� 
�Oh, that,� he said smiling, removing the air tanks from his
  back. �Well, I thought you might be a nice friend.� 
She stared at him, but the anger was clear in her face. 
�Okay, Valerie, I was one of the men who abused you these past
  several days. When we planned your death scene yesterday, I decided to save
  you for myself.� 
Nodding, Valerie said, �Okay, so now I'm yours? To do with as
  you will?� 
�Well, that could be one explanation, but I hope you might think
  of others. Actually, of the Group, I'm the only one not married. My ex wanted
  no part of leather and rubber and bondage and all that, so we divorced several
  years ago. I've been looking for the ideal mate ever since, and I think I've
  found her.� 
�Me?� Valerie said, �well, I won't thank you for saving me � that
  was your decision. I will not be your slave. The last several days have introduced
  me to a new me � and I will be independent.� 
�Fair enough. Shall we go to someplace more private?� He led
  the way to two motorcycles. She laughed. They each climbed onto a bike and
  roared away.
