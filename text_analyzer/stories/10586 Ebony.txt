EBONY!

Anne Gray

Author&#8217;s Note:&nbsp; For more than two decades it has been my honour and pleasure to write stories that have been well received by more than three million readers.&nbsp; I have received several awards from the world of bondage enthusiasts for which I will always be grateful.

Time, however, is a hard taskmaster that has delivered several on-going health problems including two heart attacks and several mini-stokes.

At one time when I was writing my fingers could not keep up with the thoughts and ideas coming from my brain.&nbsp; Several of my shorter works were done in a couple of hours. Now, however, writing has become almost hard work and this story has taken over a year from start to finish.

Ebony is the last story I plan to write and I hope you find it up to the standard of my previous work.&nbsp; It is my swan song.

Thank you all for your support over the years &#8211; God Bless.

Anne







PROLOGUE

Standing at the head of the rubber padded bondage table I gradually increased the pressure on the palm of my left hand, covered in its skin tight black kid leather glove, to force her forehead back and down a couple more inches.

�Remember what I told you Ebony, you have to learn to control that gag reflex and breathe evenly through your nose.�

With her head now tilted backward far enough to present an almost straight passage through her mouth and down her throat I was able to ease the penis shaped white rubber toy between her teeth and through the ring gag that wedged her jaws wide open.

There was the expected grunting and three or four involuntary jerks of her body against the straps holding her as the rubber shaft reached deeper.&nbsp; Quickly her training allowed Ebony to get control of the shudders caused by her body&#8217;s natural reaction as it tried to expel the invader.&nbsp; With a final twist I settled the oval shaped base of the gagging dildo against her teeth and locked it into the ring gag then tucked the flexible rubber edges into her cheeks and under her lips. When I lifted my gloved hand her head remained tilted backwards over the edge of the table held by the rubber shaft down her throat. 

I pulled her lips as close together as possible over the plugged mouth and smoothed a neat oblong of white tape firmly from under her nose to her chin and from ear to ear; finishing the gag.&nbsp; She was, yet again, silent except for the air whistling in and out through her flaring nostrils.

I moved a little way down the right side of the table and leaned over a bit until she could see me by looking down along her nose.&nbsp; The glare I got from those beautiful dark tear filled eyes proved that there was still a lot of work to be done until she came to accept her fate.&nbsp; To again drive home my complete control of her I took one of the swollen nipples, as it poked through a hole in the leather bondage long line bra covering her chest, and rolled it between the fingers of my left hand as I slowly pulled it upwards.&nbsp; My right hand, out of her sight, picked up the electric wand.

Smiling down at her I gently continued to roll the nipple between my gloved fingers and settled the wand in position barely touching the metal studs on the tight crotch strap.&nbsp; Deliberately I let the smile leave my face, released the nipple letting it snap back and triggered the wand &#8211; once, twice and then a third time.

I left her leather encased form strapped on her back to the work table and staring at the ceiling &#8211; helplessly uncomfortable, humiliated, crying in frustration and fuming!


CHAPTER 1 - THE CONTRACT COMENCES 
 

It was not too often, in fact very rarely; that I would agree to take a contract that required committing a lot of my time to what could turn out to be a fairly long period of training.&nbsp; But, after looking at all the background information from my contact, I just knew I was going to accept this one.&nbsp;&nbsp; It had been a couple of busy, very stressful, yet profitable years and I needed a break to just relax at home.&nbsp; Relax, that is, with just one unwilling visitor in my loving care and my dungeon!

Besides that, the price was right and the bitch involved needed to be stopped and then taken down hard.&nbsp; I was just the one to take on the challenge and love every minute of the process.

Working through several cutouts it took nearly five weeks to complete the required homework and make the arrangements to take possession of the young woman.

She didn&#8217;t know it yet but twenty seven year old Grace Newburgh had used her skin colour as a weapon once too often.&nbsp; Her method of attack was simple in the extreme.&nbsp; She would fabricate elaborate ways to drop any co-worker, male or female and mostly white, that she considered even a potential threat or rival to her ambitions, in to the politically correct racial shit.&nbsp; The charges were usually vague but completely indefensible and enough to get her target relocated to a different branch, another city or even fired.&nbsp; 

Senior management was her best, if usually unwillingly, supporter and always bent over backwards to avoid any sensitive issues that could become messy public lawsuits involving racial discrimination or harassment whether it was warranted or not.&nbsp; With her closest competition out of the way Grace rapidly moved up the management ladder in the company.

She was gorgeous; majestic even at 5&#8217; 8� with a figure any woman would die for.&nbsp; The actual numbers were 36 &#8211; 25 &#8211; 35 but they didn&#8217;t do justice to the way she carried herself.&nbsp; Her long, straight hair was so jet black that it had a bluish sheen. As she moved it was with fluid movements that reminded some of a lioness on the hunt.&nbsp; She had perfected an imperious pose with her chin held high and, when possible, eyes looking down her nose at any inferior beings that might be in her field of vision.

Power suits and stiletto heels added to the picture of arrogance she used to try and make those she considered lesser humans cower.

She lived alone in a rented furnished town house, not trusting or getting involved with anyone who might get in the way of, or distract her, from reaching her goal.&nbsp; Simply put that ambition was a very senior management position that would allow her to lord over underlings and demand the respect she knew she deserved.

Grace was as black as the ace of spades yet her facial features were delicate and fine.&nbsp; A perfect set of gleaming white teeth were not often seen because she rarely smiled.&nbsp; They remained hidden behind a pair of luscious lips that were usually pursed in a scarlet sneer. Unbeknownst to Grace her co-workers called her Ebony behind her back.&nbsp; It is a hard wood that doesn&#8217;t bend and, when polished, could match the sheen of her skin and the hardness of her heart.

Her remaining colleagues in the department had finally got together, having worked out what was going on, and decided they had had enough.&nbsp; Like the rumbles of a volcano getting ready to blow things threatened to explode out of control.&nbsp; Even two or three of the management bigwigs had decided enough was enough with Grace&#8217;s antics.&nbsp; The problem was that no one had any workable idea how to handle the situation without leaving the company open to the unwanted negative publicity, which she was bound to threaten them with, if they moved to get rid of her.&nbsp; 

Strangely enough, and with an element of poetic justice, it was an African-American female Vice President in another division of the company who heard about the growing undercurrent of trouble.&nbsp; She took it upon herself to investigate and quietly decided to act before things got out of control and the company was compromised.

Tanya York was active in the local BDSM scene and made some discrete calls.&nbsp; One of her contacts followed a few links and eventually I got a call.&nbsp; We negotiated through several cutouts and came to a very satisfactory agreement.&nbsp; I was going to be the one who burst the bubble of Grace&#8217;s ambition.

It had been simple getting in Grace&#8217;s town house the first time, while she was at work, to get acquainted with the layout.&nbsp; A couple of days later the door lock had required even less effort because I had taken an impression of a spare key found hanging in the kitchen and made my own copy.

Leaning on the wall behind her bedroom door when she got home on the first Friday evening of the rest of her life I waited.&nbsp; Ten minutes after I heard her come through the door from the attached garage the toilet flushed and she came, heels clicking, down the hallway.

The acquisition was simple really because any one used to coming home to an empty house has a problem when they unexpectedly run into another female, in their own bedroom yet, who is tall enough to look them in the eye, grin and then spray something in their face that smells funny.

The surprised look hardly had time to reach her face before she slumped to the floor in a heap.&nbsp; The needle slid in and out easily and I had several hours to make her just disappear.

Grace drove a three year old SUV and, after digging the keys out of her purse, I checked it in the attached garage.&nbsp; While I didn&#8217;t expect anyone to miss her until she was a no show for work on Monday it was a four hundred mile drive to my dungeon and there was no way I had planned to take a chance on that journey in her vehicle.

But it would be good enough to transfer her and most of her belongings to my own Ford Super Duty with a specially designed camper cover over the truck bed.

On my first visit I had noticed some cardboard boxes along with several suitcases and garment bags in the storage cupboard that saved me from making other arrangements.&nbsp; After pulling a pair of disposable surgical gloves over my soft kid leather ones I got a couple of the boxes and started in the kitchen.&nbsp; Everything came out of her refrigerator and then I turned it off and pulled the plug.

A simple thing like that would just help to confuse the whole investigation of what had happened to her.&nbsp; I mean, who would figure foul play when the fridge was empty, clean and unplugged?

The rest of the tins and food staples from the cupboards went in another box and then to her vehicle.

It really is amazing how much one of those SUV&#8217;s can hold.&nbsp; With the suitcases and garment bags, now full, and enough shoes and boots to stock a store there was still enough room for the comatose naked form of Grace Newburgh.

Even though she would be out for at least another five or six hours I had some fun with about fifty feet of lovely white �� cord.&nbsp; The hog tie was effective, efficient and, maybe, just a little bit brutal.&nbsp; But then I figured I might as well start as I intended to continue.&nbsp; The leather blindfold and the rubber ball gag were also white and I just loved the contrast of them against her skin.

Checking through her purse again I found her cell and completely disabled it.&nbsp; For some reason, maybe it came with it; she had a GPS app on the phone that could have been traceable.&nbsp; I made sure that was out of action and the unit would end up at the bottom of the first river I crossed as I was leaving town.

I laughed out loud as, on a final swing through the house, I checked the bedside table and found a very large and very life-like vibrating dildo.&nbsp; It was white!&nbsp; All sorts of thoughts started running through my mind as I pulled a publicly vanilla looking cashmere coat over my body hugging leather cat suit, turned off the lights and locked up.

Less than twenty minutes later I parked Grace&#8217;s SUV, where it looked positively small next to my Ford, in the underground executive parking lot of her employer and shook hands with Tanya York, the Vice President of the company that had hired me.

Like most companies these days they paid their employee salaries through direct deposit to their bank account so, with what was the supposedly confidential information, it had not been hard for the VP to access the system as soon as Grace left work that day.

Several convoluted transfers of the funds, that I didn&#8217;t even want to know about, and Tanya had made Grace Newburgh&#8217;s account balances disappear.
I assumed that they would eventually find their way back to help offset the large amount of cash she handed to me in a briefcase.

The Vice President had also arranged for the security cameras to be, shall we say, ineffective for a few hours. I dumped my coat on the front seat of the truck and went to get the next step over and done with.&nbsp; Between the two of us it didn&#8217;t take long to transfer all of Grace&#8217;s possessions to my truck and then we lifted the unconscious woman down by the hogtie cords to a blanket spread on the concrete floor.

It didn&#8217;t escape my attention that, as we lowered the limp body, Tanya had grabbed a handful of black breast and dug her nails in as she squeezed it hard.&nbsp; I really couldn&#8217;t blame her for that or the angry look on her face.

Grace had caused a lot of trouble for the company and hurt many potentially very good employees with her nasty games.&nbsp; I guessed that Tanya was also upset because, as a participant in the local BDSM scene, she was now doing something that was definitely not consensual in any way.&nbsp; Breaking the hard and fast rule of the scene that nothing took place without the informed consent of the participants was going against her grain.

I was somewhat sympathetic but personally felt the old principle of action and reaction was more the case here.&nbsp; Grace had taken action that hurt people to advance her career and we were reacting to stop her hurting anyone else.&nbsp; Besides I thought, as I stashed the briefcase full of cash in my truck, it was also very profitable.

Working together we soon had all the ropes off and Grace, still fast asleep, flat on her back.&nbsp; 

I pulled a large bag from the truck and set it on the floor.

�By the time we get the bitch settled Tanya, I estimate she will wake up in about four hours.&nbsp; Then she will have another few hours to wonder what the hell is going on.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s get started.�

�I&#8217;m not comfortable with this whole situation but it had to be done.&nbsp; I started the process and I&#8217;ll help you now.�&nbsp;&nbsp; She paused for a moment and then said.&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t even know your name.�

�You can call me Anne; now take this and fit it around her upper right thigh as high as possible.�

I handed her a hinged 2� wide metal band that had a smaller round band attached to one end. On the smaller band was a flat flange with a 3/8th hole drilled through it.&nbsp; The bands were lined with a thin rubber coating.&nbsp; Taking a duplicate one I positioned it around Grace&#8217;s left thigh and worked it up close to the crease of her ass cheek.&nbsp; The hinge closed the band until one end slid through a slot under the smaller band that was on the outside of her leg.

Tanya watched as I continued to close the wide band until it pinched the flesh but not so much that it would interfere with the blood flow to the leg.&nbsp; A small catch locked it in place and I took Grace&#8217;s left wrist, fitted it inside the smaller band, and locked that one as well.

The angry look left her face as she did the same on her side then looked up at me.

�I like those Anne.&nbsp; Simple but very effective I think I&#8217;ll try to find a pair to use on my sub&#8217;.�

It only took a moment to go to the cab of my truck and jot down the Internet address of the manufacturer of the patented limb cuffs.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t bother to tell her that I had designed them myself and had a seventy five percent investment in the company.

�Here be my guest, they also make this one.�

&#8216;This one&#8217; was a wider band big enough to go around Grace&#8217;s waist with another set of two smaller ones that locked around her forearms.&nbsp; With that in position I asked Tanya to stand astride the girl&#8217;s shoulders as I lifted and spread the unresisting legs until she could grab an ankle in each hand.

A large white butt plug slid in with the steady twisting pressure of my right hand.&nbsp; A small soft rubber plug blocked her urethra before her own, currently inactive, vibrating dildo slid in its place and I locked everything where it was with another metal piece that attached to the waistband and became a chastity belt.

Two more sets of the limb cuffs went just above the knees and around Grace&#8217;s ankles.&nbsp; The wide neck ring had a flat flange on either side and locked in place snugly but without interfering with the air flow down her throat.

The hard rubber ball gag had a one inch diameter tube through it that extended 4� out of her mouth and I pulled that lovely long hair out of the way and held her head so Tanya could fit the gag strap through its buckle and pull it tight at the back of the comatose girl&#8217;s neck.&nbsp;&nbsp; I handed her a black blindfold and she fastened that in place.

The back doors to the camper cover on my Super Duty opened wide and a set of steps folded down to allow us to climb in fairly easily.&nbsp; I had Grace by the shoulders as Tanya hooked her right arm under the knees and lifted until we could slide the body on to the bed of the truck.&nbsp; We followed it in, lifted again and settled our captive inside a six foot long &#8216;tool box&#8217;.

The floor of the box was also covered with a fairly thick rubber pad but we lined up the flanges on the limb cuffs with several matching holes through the pad.&nbsp; Using a cordless Black &amp; Decker wrench I fed simple �� by 1 �� inch bolts through the holes in the flanges.&nbsp; Either side of the neck, waist, upper thighs, knees and ankles and the bolts were screwed in.&nbsp; Technically, any single bolt would have stopped Grace escaping but, with all of them in place, it stopped any movement of her body.

Turning her head to the side so it was resting on the left cheek I snapped a curved metal clamp over the gag tube and locked that in place.&nbsp; Now her head was immobile and, with her head turned, there was less chance of any involuntary choking on her saliva.

I tucked a light blanket around the naked form and then Tanya helped me settle a false bottom shelf inside on a ledge around the perimeter.&nbsp; There was just one cutout over the end of the gag tube that was more than sufficient to allow Tanya to get air.&nbsp; The rest of the shelf we piled with an assortment of tools and small boxes making sure nothing could slide around and cover the air cutout. The lid of the box could also be controlled by a switch in the cab so I left it open for now and it would remain open unless I felt it necessary to shut it down.&nbsp; We closed up the camper and I locked the doors.

Tanya would arrange for Grace&#8217;s SUV to disappear so I thanked her for her help; shook hands again and climbed, literally, behind the wheel of the Ford.&nbsp; One hour west I pulled over to a deserted layover at the side of the highway and changed the truck&#8217;s license plates to the ones registered to the vehicle.

As a treat for the local wildlife I dumped the perishable food from Grace&#8217;s refrigerator behind a couple of convenient trees.&nbsp; There was not a doubt in my mind that the black bears would love the unfrozen lasagna; with a side of melting strawberry ice cream.
&nbsp; 
I used the crew cab to strip out of my leather body suit and boots then peeled off the brown wig and cleaned the heavy makeup off my face.&nbsp; Dressed now in jeans, a light sweater and low heeled ankle boots I pulled a wrapped sandwich and bottle of water out of the small fridge and moved to the driver&#8217;s seat again.

From a safe hidden under the seat I took my real, and perfectly legal, identification and replaced the ones in my purse with them.

Tanya had seemed like she was on my side and the money was correct but there had been quite a few people involved in the highly illegal project and I liked to increase my odds of not being identified or traced.
 
A switch under the dash allowed me to turn on a small monitor with a feed from the camera in the camper.&nbsp; Obviously, the current picture was of the toolbox but it was the microphone I wanted.&nbsp; Grace was still out cold but it wouldn&#8217;t be long before she woke up and I would keep listening in on things to make sure there were no problems as I drove home 




CHAPTER 2 &#8211; BEAUTY AND THE BITCH

The rest of the drive was uneventful and with just a couple of brief stops I pulled into the garage at my home around mid-morning.&nbsp; There had been some throaty muffled noises from the monitor but they just told me that my passenger had woken up and was getting enough air.

I needed a few hours rest before introducing myself as Grace&#8217;s worst nightmare so I took the easy route.&nbsp; A quick trip to the kitchen, a few moments with the blender, and I was back opening up the camper doors.&nbsp; Getting rid of the crap on the false bottom I lifted it out and used the cordless to loosen the bolts holding her neck down.

After taking off the clamp on the gag tube I used a handful of hair to pull her head up to open a pathway down her throat and slowly poured in the enough of the mush to keep her fed and hydrated for a few more hours.&nbsp; After replacing the neck bolts and gag clamp I left the lid and the doors of the camper open, picked up a spare monitor and headed for my shower and bed.

Now, it was three days later and it had been a very uncomfortable seventy two hours for my current project.&nbsp; I had used many little tricks other than the basic restraints to start convincing Grace, who I now called Ebony, that she no longer had any control over anyone or anything.

Meals were force fed through the ring gag, a catheter meant she had given up control of her bladder and a butt plug that was adapted to connect with a pump that hygienically cleared any waste relieved her of even that basic function. 

I was particularly pleased with the way I handled another simple everyday habit and, in the process, scared the hell out of her.

Strapped and held immobile in a fully adjustable, multi-purpose chair with her mouth stretched around the ring gag, Ebony&#8217;s eyes followed me as I wheeled over the tall rack of equipment that instantly screamed &#8211; dentist!

It was impossible but those beautiful eyes seemed to get even wider as I made a production of putting on a white rubber smock to cover my black leather cat suit and snapped latex gloves on my hands.

A deep throated moan came through the ring gag as she watched me lift the drill off the rack and heard the high pitched whine when I stepped on the foot control.&nbsp; Smiling down at her I lowered the drill out of her line of sight and changed the tip. Dipping the new one in a small jar of gunk I used two fingers of my left hand to pinch her already stretched upper lip and peel it upwards.

Then I stepped on the control switch and brushed her teeth.

The stream of emotions that flashed across her eyes was soon followed by a perceptible relaxing of her muscles as she realized what I was doing.&nbsp; It was a small psychological victory but, added to the many others I had planned; it would nibble away at the girl&#8217;s extraordinary self-confidence in herself.

�It could very easily have been the drill Ebony and that would have been very painful; you are completely and utterly under my control so get used to it.�

She wouldn&#8217;t, of course, at least for some time but I was going to have my kind of fun until she did.

Now, on the evening of her third day with me, I had her in an outfit that accentuated her figure and highlighted the fine facial features that made her so beautiful.&nbsp; Eventually I planned to tell her why she was here and what was going to happen to her over the next few weeks.

Naturally she was dressed completely in gleaming white leather and it looked amazing on her.&nbsp; On the other hand Ebony was not enjoying the experience.

A couple of hours earlier I had dressed in a comfortable pair of leather slacks, light sweater and some low heeled ankle boots before getting to work on Ebony.

I started with a combination long line white leather bondage bra and waist cincher that laced from the top of her hips to high on the back of her neck. That job done I followed with specially designed shoulder length white kid leather gloves.&nbsp; I handled her easily because she was strapped face down on a rubber topped table.&nbsp; A wide strap ran across the back of her head and kept it locked face down through an oval opening in the table.

Releasing the strap holding her left wrist I bent the arm up between her shoulder blades until a set of eyelets along the forearm of the gloves matched another set built into the bondage bra to the left of her backbone.&nbsp; Feeding a long leather thong through the eyelets I laced that arm where I wanted it and then did the same with her right arm.

Another small strap across her elbows pulled them even closer together and increased the tension on the reverse prayer position of her arms.

This process was interspersed with a constant barrage of swearing, shouts, grunts and groans because I had deliberately not gagged my victim &#8211; yet.

I pulled together the leather flaps built into the sides of the bondage bra until they met evenly down the middle of her back and laced them together.&nbsp; That took care of her arms.

I released the strap holding her head down and easily, since for all intents and purposes she was armless, flipped her on to her back.&nbsp; A couple of minutes later her feet were locked in the heel rests of the metal arms attached to each side of the table.&nbsp; Straps at her knees held them to the metal arms and, as I turned the crank, her bent legs were spread and moved downward towards the outside edges of the table.

She was now completely vulnerable and the volume of her screaming and swearing increased as I tightened a strap across her upper chest to stop her squirming around.

Next I worked two white leather straps around each of her thighs as close as possible to her buttocks.&nbsp; Attached by strong elastic bands to each strap were six small alligator clips, white naturally, and the teeth of each clip were covered in thin white rubber so they would pinch and hold but not puncture the tender skin of her labia outer lips.

Taking my time I attached a clip just in from the edge of the top of the left lip and, as I let go it the elastic retracted and pulled at the clip.&nbsp; When the other eleven clips were in place her vagina was completely exposed and ready for my further attention.

Pulling on a pair of latex gloves I moved a small table within reach and stood between Ebony&#8217;s legs.&nbsp; Twenty minutes later the swearing and cursing had changed and she was unwittingly moaning and pleading with me to let her climax.&nbsp; Using vibrators and dildos I had worked her three or four times to the point of complete frustration and left her hanging.

Throughout the whole time I had not said a word to her and my lack of reaction seemed to frustrate her almost as much as what I was doing to her; that was fine with me and just added to the building tension.

Using some of her own juices I ran a couple of gloved fingers around her rosebud and installed an anal spreader.&nbsp; Selecting an object from a container on the table I held it until the excess fluid it had been soaking in had dripped off.&nbsp; Using some paper towel I dried it and wrapped it in a couple of sheets of thin rice paper.

It was about five inches long and shaped somewhat like a greyish white stubby carrot with one narrow end and a thicker base.&nbsp; I pushed it through the opening in the spreader and, once it was completely buried inside Ebony&#8217;s rectum, I removed the spreader and pushed in a short, wide white rubber butt plug.


 I repeated the process with a similarly shaped but much larger item from the container forcing that one deeply into the wide open vagina. Fitting a piece of thick white rubber over the opening I released the alligator clips and the thigh straps, pulled her lips closed and covered them with a wide piece of white tape.&nbsp; A strap from the middle of the back of the waist clincher pulled through her buttocks and when I tightened it to a buckle at the front it locked both of her openings closed and made them leak proof.

I peeled off the latex gloves and dropped them in the garbage.

With the straps removed from around her knees the metal stirrups straightened as I turned the crank until her legs were side by side and almost touching.&nbsp; She was going to endure some very serious muscle movement and involuntary spasms soon so I fitted small pads between her knees and her ankle bones then pulled her legs tightly together with wide white tape above and below her knees, around the ankles and even the insteps.

Having cleared out and packed Grace&#8217;s, now Ebony&#8217;s, wardrobe I knew she was very comfortable in her stilettos but the heel on the white kid leather double leg thigh boot would tax even her arches.&nbsp; As I worked it up over her feet it forced quite a few grunts and groans from her throat.&nbsp; The tightening laces just accentuated the incredible curve of the top of her feet from the towering heel down to the tiny chisel point of the toe.

The boot was boned at the knee and as I completed the lacing process her legs were locked straight and she was completely encased in tight leather from her neck to the single toe of the boot.&nbsp; The yelling and swearing had slowly diminished throughout the bondage process but Ebony still managed to come out with some threats and very original ideas as to what she was going to do to me when she got the chance.

That was just not going to happen and in a couple of hours I felt she would be convinced.

The kid leather hobble dress, white naturally, was fully lined so that it slid snugly up her legs and then, after I swung her booted feet down to the floor and turned her around to face the table, I worked it up her body and over her shoulders.&nbsp; The heavy duty zip pulled the two sides smoothly together forming a pouch over her bound arms and ending at the base of her neck to form a low collar.

A wide leather belt closed at the front of her waist with a large gold buckle.&nbsp; Still standing behind her I reached around and pulled the belt as tight as it would go then slipped the end through a reinforced loop on her left side.&nbsp; There was a matching loop on the right of the belt.

From the neck down her body was stiff as a board and I easily pulled it backwards until she stood between two upright metal posts about 40� high that were bolted to the floor.&nbsp; Short stainless steel chains from the top of each post ended in snap hooks that I attached to the reinforced belt loops.&nbsp; Much shorter chains snapped on ankle high loops at each side of the boot.

A few tugs here and there to smooth out a small wrinkles in the dress and there she stood - a beautiful statue in white leather that formed to every curve of her body balanced on the single toe and the towering heel of the boot.&nbsp; Accentuating the white of the leather was the mass of dark hair piled, out of the way, on top of the gorgeously dark features of her face.&nbsp; Those features were marred by the ugly twisting of her lips as she again started with the threats and the sheer hatred glaring at me from her eyes.

Continuing to ignore her I picked up a hair brush and, releasing the mass from the top of her head, started to brush it out until it flowed forwards over her shoulders and took on the gleaming blue black sheen that was so attractive.

Standing directly in front of Ebony I used my left hand to take a firm grip on her chin then quickly slapped her face with my right and held a finger to my lips to signal her to shut up.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t get the message the first time so I did it again and she got it.&nbsp; I mean no one could ever accuse her of being stupid.

A small table held everything needed to do her makeup and, in keeping with the theme, that beautiful face soon sported white accented eye lids and glistening white lips sealed with a clear gloss coat.

I left the girl to continue to wonder what the hell was going on and went to shower and change.&nbsp; Taking my time and going over my plans for the next chapter of Ebony&#8217;s education it was nearly an hour later when I returned and stood in front of her in full black leather Domme mode right down to the short braided whip hanging from my wrist.&nbsp; 

Wheeling a large monitor over to eight or ten feet in front of her I sat down in a chair beside it and powered up my laptop.

A surprised look came on Ebony&#8217;s face as I spoke to her for the first time in two days.

�The reason you are here Ebony is because of pain, pain you have caused to so many people and in return the pain are going to feel very soon.�

�Do you recognise this man?�&nbsp; I hit a button and a picture came up on the monitor.

�Well, Ebony, do you?�

Her eyes flicked to the screen and showed me that she did indeed know who he was.

�His name is Brian and he was only 28 years old when you screwed him out of a promising career by accusing him of racial harassment that never happened.&nbsp; What you don&#8217;t know is that when you got him fired he lost not only his job but his health benefits.&nbsp; He and his wife had a three year old son with severe medical problems; they lost him when they could no longer afford his specialists.�

�Now that&#8217;s pain Ebony and you did it.&nbsp; The records show that you pulled your racial stunt at least eleven times on both men and women and most of them had families and all of them suffered because of you.�

I hit another button.

�Here&#8217;s the list of their names Ebony; there are twenty six people affected by your actions and before this evening is over you will memorise them.&nbsp; I&#8217;d start now if I were you because very soon some of their pain will become yours and the longer you take the worse the pain will become.�

The white lips parted and the tip of her tongue flicked across them and then she said �Fuck off and let me loose.�

�Oh that is a very bad mistake you heartless bltch and let me tell you why.&nbsp; What you have currently jammed up your ass and cunt are two peeled roots of horseradish.&nbsp; They had been soaking in vinegar until I was ready for them.&nbsp;&nbsp; After drying them I wrapped a couple of sheets of rice paper around the roots which takes a while to dissolve.�

�Once that happens your bodily fluids will activate a chemical reaction and produce, well, the medical term is allyl isothiocyanate, but it is more commonly known as a component of mustard oil.�

�The oil will cause extreme irritation and pain where it touches against your very sensitive internal surfaces and you can&#8217;t move a muscle to prevent it; so let&#8217;s just wait and see how long that rice paper takes to dissolve.�

What I didn&#8217;t tell her was that although it would get extremely painful the horse radish oil would not do any permanent harm.&nbsp; Once I removed the roots and flushed out her systems the pain would cease but until that happened she was about to get a glimpse of hell.

Watching her closely I saw a quick intake of breath and knew things were about to get interesting.


CHAPTER THREE &#8211; PAINFUL PLAY.

In my world my reputation as a Leather Domme was well known and understood.&nbsp; I was very, very good at what I did and used what-ever means necessary to obtain the desired end to any contracts I undertook.&nbsp; That included every conceivable form of bondage some of which caused a certain amount of pain to the subject.

But, I was not a sadist who used pain just for the sake of causing pain.&nbsp; In Ebony&#8217;s case I was, for the next couple of hours, going to skate very close to that line because within minutes she was going to start experiencing pain that would verge on the unbearable. 

It had not been an easy decision but it was the only way I could start to penetrate Ebony&#8217;s mental wall that had her believing she was better than everyone else.&nbsp; Her overwhelming self-confidence told her that what she had done had no consequences except to move her up the management ladder.

Physical pain for an hour or two would not be comparable to the devastating affect her actions had on the lives of so many innocent people.&nbsp; There was also the fact that, once it was over, the threat of a repeat performance should make her very obedient.

There was a low moan from Ebony and her eyes closed for a moment then snapped open again and stared at me.

�Start memorizing that list before the rice paper completely dissolves Ebony you don&#8217;t have much time to concentrate.�

A shocked grunt came from the white leather statue and if she hadn&#8217;t been bound so severely it would have been accompanied by a muscular shudder that would have racked her body.

�The list Ebony, study the list of your victims!�

She looked at me and then to the monitor her eyes began studying the names but then they closed and a mewling sound started in her throat and she bit her lips.

It was time to protect her from herself so I moved behind her and waited.&nbsp; It didn&#8217;t take long until I heard the sharp intake of breath and her head jerked backwards.&nbsp; As her mouth opened in the start of a scream I jammed a large white ball gag between her lips and buckled it tightly at the back of her neck underneath the black waterfall of her hair.

A stiff white neck brace stopped any movement of her head and I sat down again to watch as the inserts did their work.

I didn&#8217;t know what her pain threshold was but it didn&#8217;t take long to reach it as tears sprang from her eyes and started to run down her cheeks.&nbsp; I moved to stand in front of her and wiped the first burst of tears from her face.

�That is pain Ebony but nothing like the pain you caused those families so let&#8217;s just see how long your self-confidence helps you now.�

Sitting there with a smirk on my face I was in fact studying her very closely.&nbsp; The pain was obviously increasing and, held as she was by the layers of laced leather, I was not too worried about her straining or even breaking something as she struggled.&nbsp; Her breathing was another matter.&nbsp; 

The waves of pain made her try to scream through the ball gag but at the same time she was also trying to get sufficient air to her lungs through her nose.&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t take out the gag because it was stopping her from biting her tongue so the balance was critical.

Ebony had to suffer to drive home my lesson but there could be no lasting effect other than the massive blow to her ego.

With my experience I knew there was another possible answer and that was to interrupt the pattern of her uncontrolled screaming.&nbsp; I moved beside her and swung the braided whip sharply across the tight leather covering her buttocks.

Bingo.&nbsp; The shock of the new pain stopped her screaming for a vital few seconds.

�The pain is not going to go away yet Ebony so cut out the screaming and breathe.� 

Tears were flowing freely down her cheeks and around the bulge made by the bag gag jammed in her mouth but she was still able to glare at me as she panted to get air.

After taking in a half dozen strained breaths it was obvious that the pain was building and she lost control again.&nbsp; As she started another scream the braided whip in my right hand rose and fell across her ass.

For the next ten minutes this scene repeated itself until I knew that the sting of the whip was no longer effective; so I let her scream herself hoarse and then subside to a few sobs and finally mute.

I could no longer rely on the stringent bondage to keep her from doing some damage to herself so I grabbed her chin, looked into her eyes and gave her a big grin then a couple of quick squirts of the happy spray in each flared nostril.&nbsp; For Ebony the evening was over.

For me there was still work to be done and after a quick change to jeans and a sweater, I tied on a waterproof apron then stripped Ebony out of the top layer of leather and the boots.&nbsp; That done, and with her arms still locked behind her in the reverse prayer pouch, I arranged her limp form so she was sitting up on an open rack with her knees pulled out to each side and strapped to two metal arms.&nbsp; Once I used another couple of straps to hold her ankles in place I pulled on pair of latex gloves then, to be safe, another pair over the first.

Using a spreader I was able to manipulate a small pair of tongs inside her, get a grip on the dripping horseradish root and pull it out of her vagina.&nbsp; The one up her ass was a little more difficult but I managed to remove it as well.&nbsp; I dropped them in the wide metal trough positioned under Ebony then washed my gloved hands before continuing.

First I flushed her with a fluid that stopped the chemical action and neutralized the acid that had caused all the pain.&nbsp; Even though she was out cold her body reacted immediately; I could see the relaxing of tension in her muscles and the low moaning like someone makes when they are having a nightmare &#8211; stopped.

Using a large clean syringe I pushed it deeply inside first her vagina and then her anal canal and squirted in a load of soothing lotion.&nbsp; Before it could work its way out I plugged her with a large dildo and butt plug.

Less than an hour later she was tucked up for the night; strapped to a wheeled gurney, in tight white latex panties and a buckled crotch strap, with her legs back in the double leg boot.&nbsp; I had a padded rest under her neck and it held her head sideways.&nbsp; The ring gag was back in and I had suspended a simple baby bottle so that I could screw the bottle top into the gag.&nbsp; She was going to be dehydrated when she did wake up and would automatically find the nipple and a source of plain water.

The first thing she would see when she opened her eyes was the monitor with the list of her victims and, dangling beside it, a root of dried horseradish! 


CHAPTER 4 &#8211; MEMORY MAYHEM

Over the next two weeks Ebony and I had daily sessions to help her memorize the names of all those her selfish pursuit to reach her career goal had hurt. Besides humiliating her by making her learn how to deep throat a dildo and control her gag reflex there was a much more effective method.

For at least a couple of hours each day I suspended her stark naked in a spread eagle and carefully attached twenty six small metal alligator clips to her body. The ear lobes, nipples, the soft skin inside her elbows and at the back of her knees each received one.&nbsp; Several went around the vagina, one on the clit and the last ones at her anus.&nbsp; All of the clips were wired to a control box and all of them were numbered.&nbsp; The numbers also appeared on the monitor beside the list of names. 

I would flip a switch and send a small shock to a clip.&nbsp; 

�Number 8� I would say!

�Brian� Ebony would scream.

I could juggle those switches and play her like a piano.&nbsp; Two, three or four switches at once until she danced in her bondage and went hoarse yelling out names.

During the weeks I was working on the girl I was always trying to come up with an idea as to the best final punishment for the things she had done in the name of her self- serving vanity.

She couldn&#8217;t know, of course, that Vice President Tanya was tracking those hurt by Ebony and would personally find ways to alleviate the damage she had done to their careers and families.&nbsp; The hurt of their lost baby could never be offset but that family would find their lives turning a corner to become much more comfortable and everything in place to nurture their other children. 

In the knowledge that two minds are twice as productive as one I used our usual convoluted method of contacting each other to get in touch with an old friend.&nbsp; Among other things in the scene she also happened to own the company that manufactured my patented limb cuffs.&nbsp; 

Tatiana and I had quite a history and both of us had almost settled down although we each kept a few irons in the fire to stay active in our chosen field.&nbsp; We didn&#8217;t live that far apart and she said she could free up a couple days to visit.

In my life there were, of course; a number of people who knew where I lived but not what I did.&nbsp; Likewise, a number knew what I did but definitely did not know where I lived.&nbsp; Only one knew both of those things &#8211; Tati.


CHAPTER 5 &#8211; BONDAGE GOES HI-TECH!

I picked Tati up at the airport and admired her royal blue leather traveling suit; the jacket had contrasting pale blue lapels and was clinched at her waist with a wide matching belt.&nbsp; Her high heeled black boots nearly reached her knees and the skirt ended just above them &#8211; she was gorgeous!

Once she was settled and unpacked I took her to see Ebony.&nbsp; I had the statuesque black figure on display against a white background.&nbsp; Her bonds were minimal but held her in a standing spread eagle.&nbsp; A white strap around each wrist held her arms straight out from the shoulder.&nbsp; From the knees down her legs were wrapped in the wide white laces of a pair of strappy high heeled sandals.

Short chains connected each ankle to a floor hook.&nbsp; Other than that she was naked except for the white ball gag that accented a pair of scarlet lips stretched around it and a white crotch strap that held large toys deeply inside her.

�Well, well so this is the bitch that caused so much trouble.�&nbsp; Tati&#8217;s ever present whip rose a few inches and she snapped her wrist, as only she could, to make the tip just seem to touch Ebony&#8217;s right buttock.&nbsp; The whip was only 14 or 15 inches long but Tatiana was an artist and, for the next couple of minutes, she made the tip dance over the taunt black cheeks.

If she could have Ebony would have been screaming, as it was she tried to move her body away from the painful assault but the stinging tip was unrelenting.

�So what are we going to do with her Anne?�

�That&#8217;s why you&#8217;re here Tati; beside the fact that we haven&#8217;t seen each other for a while and I&#8217;ve missed you - a lot.�

We were relaxing in the living room with a glass of wine and, since Ebony was wrapped up for the night, the only sign of leather in the room was the furniture.&nbsp; Fluffy bathrobes were the outfits for the evening with, I might add, nothing underneath.

Tati smiled �I&#8217;ve missed you too and look forward to showing you just how much later.&nbsp; So let&#8217;s see what we can do with your problem girl.�

�We need to find a way to drive home the harm she&#8217;s done and make her realize that it has consequences.&nbsp; She needs something approaching humility drummed into her every day for the rest of her life &#8211; and then some.�

Tati looked at me and then that slow smile I knew so well started to appear.

She got up and headed for the bedroom returning a few moments later with a small bag.

�I brought something with me show you and boast about but maybe it will help in this situation.&nbsp; It&#8217;s still in the testing stage with a lot of details to work out but let&#8217;s just see what our devious minds can think up.�

Tati pulled something out of the bag and held it up; it looked like a dull brown over the elbow opera glove and she threw it to me.

�Try that on.�

I had no idea where she was going but pulled the glove over my left hand and up my arm.

�So what&#8217;s special about this besides the fact the colour sucks?�

She reached over and held my gloved hand in hers then stroked my arm with her right hand.&nbsp; As she moved her hand down my arm it felt very strange and suddenly my elbow was locked and when she reached my fingers I couldn&#8217;t move them either.&nbsp; It was like the material had turned to steel.

�How did you do that?&nbsp; What is this stuff?�

Tati turned her hand up so I could see a small metal plate in her palm.

�Magnet - It activates the material that&#8217;s got a web of new age threads embedded in it.&nbsp; Don&#8217;t ask where I got the idea but let&#8217;s just say a techie friend was working on improving body armor and stumbled on it!�

�Well I hope he stumbled on a way to release it because, even though it&#8217;s not tight enough to really hurt, I would like my left arm back.�

She dropped the magnet back in the bag and pulled out a small object that I recognized as a Taser.

�Woe &#8211; that&#8217;s going to hurt, I think I&#8217;ll just cut this thing off.�

�Well first of all you couldn&#8217;t cut it and would probably lose a lot of blood trying.&nbsp; Secondly, this is gives a shock about as strong as you get from static electricity off a carpet &#8211; trust me.�

Tati reached over and just touched the back of my hand with the gadget then pushed a button.&nbsp; I hardly felt it but the glove suddenly was just that &#8211; a glove &#8211; and I peeled it off.

Closing my eyes I ran the material through my fingers.&nbsp; Every tactile sense told me it was leather, it even smelt like leather and let&#8217;s face it, I am an expert.&nbsp; 

�Except for that shitty colour this is leather Tati!�

�There&#8217;s lot of work to do with this before I can put it on the underground market for our restraint enthusiasts.&nbsp; But then it will be worth a fortune.&nbsp; We need to dye it a range of colours and do about six or seven months of testing so someone can&#8217;t touch a sub&#8217; with the magnet and end up strangling them.&nbsp; Then there&#8217;s the problem that for some reason the material sometimes deteriorates after two or three uses.�

�You can dress a sub&#8217; in this stuff and literally mould them into any position you feel like and they can&#8217;t move a muscle until you give them a buzz.&nbsp; Imagine the possibilities, they&#8217;re unlimited.�

�So how does that help me with Ebony?�

�Well for the last few weeks I&#8217;ve had to use two of my trainee&#8217;s as guinea pigs and they are not happy campers.&nbsp; Suppose we took Ebony to my dungeon and turned her over to the tender care of a couple of pissed off blue eyed blonde student dommes in their early twenties.&nbsp; Would that burst her arrogance bubble?� 

A quick trip to the kitchen and I popped open a bottle of champagne.

As we killed the bottle we discussed several options that would be open to us once the material was ready for regular use and I just knew that Ebony was going to really hate the testing process.

A couple of days later we packed Ebony in the back of my Super Duty and, with both of us taking turns driving, headed for Tatianna&#8217;s home to deliver her into the hands of her new Dommes.

CHAPTER 6 - THE FINAL CHAPTER

During the following months I spent a lot of time thinking things over and decided that it was time for me to retire from an active role in the underground community.&nbsp; My monetary resources were more than enough and, with the income from the bondage products on the market; it would be difficult to be extravagant enough to ever have to worry about money.

Consequently, when I received a message from Tatianna asking me to visit for a few days, I made another decision.

Over the years when I was travelling in public it was always as a bit of a frump, timid, innocuous and, therefore, unnoticeable.&nbsp; 

This time would be different.&nbsp; I drove a couple of hours across the State and checked in to the airport hotel.&nbsp; The next morning I treated myself to �the works� in the hotel spa, had a light lunch and went to my room to get dressed.

I admit the reaction I got as I crossed the lobby to check out was very gratifying and a real boost to my ego.&nbsp; I mean, I&#8217;m no spring chicken but I was nice to know I could still turn a head.

The bone white leather maxi coat had a stand up collar and closed down its full length with large matching buttons.&nbsp; A four inch belt was clinched tightly around my waist and the hem of the coat brushed around my ankles which were encased in sky high stiletto heeled knee boots.&nbsp; 

A perky white leather po&#8217;boy cap and kid gloves completed the outfit.&nbsp; My makeup was impeccable and the salon owner had worked on my jet black pageboy until not a hair was out of place. I felt great and, obviously, the heads that were turning and the eyes that followed my progress to the front desk, liked what they saw.&nbsp; If only they knew!

�I see you decided to take your favorite white leather out and in to the light.�&nbsp; Tatianna laughed when she met me at the airport.

�Since I&#8217;ve decided to retire there&#8217;s no reason to stay in the background anymore so I prefer to go out with a bang not a whimper now I&#8217;ve nothing to hide.�

On the drive to Tati&#8217;s home she filled me in on progress with the experimental material and Ebony.&nbsp; She lived in an upscale apartment over her two stores that housed &#8216;Tatianna&#8217;s Treasures&#8217;.&nbsp; The one outlet was open to the public and sold a full range of leather clothing, shoes, boots and other &#8216;acceptable&#8217; products.&nbsp; The other, at the back and in the basement, was by invitation only and catered to a very specific clientele that had much more exotic tastes.

�MagnaBind, that&#8217;s what we&#8217;ve tentatively called the material.� Tatianna explained.&nbsp; �Because of the thousands of other possible uses I&#8217;ve had our lawyer start the patent and copyright process.&nbsp; We&#8217;ve got it nearly perfected; it can be tailored like any other material and now comes in every imaginable colour.�

Instead of parking in her private spot around the back she stopped directly in front of her store.

�What do you think?

Looking at the window display I studied the mannequin for a few moments.&nbsp; It was a full adult size female with no facial features just a curved shiny black mask that reminded me of a small turtle shell.&nbsp; It was dressed in a pale blue leather trench coat with a wide belt closed with a gold buckle that matched the buttons down the front and on the storm flaps.

The figure was frozen in full stride with its right leg six or seven inches off the ground and slightly bent at the knee showing off the stiletto heeled black boot that reached just over the knee.&nbsp; The left toe was firmly on the floor and you could just see a slender pole between the legs that came from the floor and disappeared under the coat.

The outfit was completed with black kid gloves, a Gucci handbag hung from the wrist of the extended right arm; a blue and white silk scarf was wrapped as a head covering and tied loosely under the chin.

�I love the outfit but there&#8217;s nothing special about it.�

She laughed and started to drive around to the back of the building.&nbsp; �Tell that to Ebony - she&#8217;s the model and you won&#8217;t believe where the end of that supporting pole is buried.�

Up in the master suite she watched as I unpacked and filled in some details.

�My students have had a wonderful time with your friend for the last few months.&nbsp; As we continued to make improvements to the MagnaBind we used her to experiment with it and you&#8217;d be amazed at the contortions a body, however unwilling, can achieve.&nbsp; Ebony still has a tiny part of that spark left in her eyes but the constant humiliations have dulled the arrogance to make her a lot easier to handle.&nbsp; Now let&#8217;s go down for dinner.�


�So now our biggest problem is promoting the material to our own particular corner of the bondage world.&nbsp; When it&#8217;s used for vanilla projects or products the name will suffice but I&#8217;d like to do something special for our clients.�

They had brought Ebony in from the window and dressed her in the proverbial French maid outfit.&nbsp; I had watched, fascinated, as they teamed up with one of the girls touching an arm or the wrist with the mini taser and removing the blue leather coat then the other ran her hand held magnet over the black leather skin covering and it locked again.&nbsp; 

The head covering was just slightly larger than the discipline helmet and gag strap that was underneath and from up close you could see the area around her nose was a very fine black mesh that allowed her to breathe.

They then added the black latex skirt, white apron and frilly head piece.&nbsp; Adjusting the right arm they positioned it to carry a small silver tray at shoulder height with several glasses on it; while the left held a single glass of champagne. They straightened her legs, still in the high boots, and fitted the support pole into a floor bracket beside the table.

�The beauty of the material is that, when it&#8217;s locked, it is unaffected by weight.&nbsp; She could stand there all night and that tray won&#8217;t move an inch.�&nbsp; Tati was gloating and I couldn&#8217;t blame her. 

Through the meal I kept looking at the motionless figure as an idea gradually took form.

Ebony was completely naked except for the simple ropes that held her ankles against her thighs and her wrists to a ring at the back of the collar around her neck.&nbsp; A ring gag held her jaws wide apart but left plenty of room for her tongue to work.

As Tati and I fell off the bound girl between us into the mound of pillows on the bed to get our breath back the idea that had been growing suddenly flowered.

�Tatianna do you have any clients or members who are very good with all aspects of the photographic arts?&nbsp; If so give me a week with them and two of your top student Dommes and I&#8217;ll solve your advertising problem as a final favour. 

I was wrong.&nbsp; After we turned one of the basement dungeons into a studio and got all the equipment set up it took nine days before I was satisfied.&nbsp; By that time the students were ready to graduate, the photographer was looking around for an Oscar, Ebony was a basket case and I was very, very proud of my last project.

There were nearly two dozen people packed into Tatianna&#8217;s living room.&nbsp; Some were invited guests, others the ones involved with developing the material plus the photographer, Dommes and staff from the store.&nbsp; Then there was Ebony who was kneeling, rigidly encased in black leather, beside my chair.

Tati dimmed the lights and her huge flat screen TV came to life.

A huge eye, brimming with tears, filled the screen and then the camera slowly drew back to show first a head covered in leather with just the eyes showing and with a very tight gag strap over the bulge at the mouth.

Gradually a full figure appeared of an exquisite adult black female body slowly revolving on a pedestal against a white background.&nbsp; It was naked except for the helmet, a crotch strap and a set of wrist cuffs holding her arms to her sides.&nbsp; There was a pile of black fabric on the floor.

One of Tati&#8217;s girls, masked, and in full Domme leathers, reached into the pile and picked up a shoulder length glove then ran her right hand over it and held it towards the camera so the fact it had become completely stiff it was obvious.&nbsp; In the next frame the glove was on Ebony&#8217;s arm.

Frame by frame pieces appeared until the figure was completely encased in the black leather but now her arms were stretched straight up behind her head in a laced binder that ran from the fingertips to shoulders.&nbsp; Ballet boots forced her feet almost on pointe. 

Soft music had been playing and that suddenly changed to a hard throbbing beat like the theme from a James Bond movie.&nbsp; Through the magic of stop motion photography the figure started to bend smoothly at the waist.&nbsp; As her stiffened fingertips reached the level of her knees a duplicate figure appeared facing the first one and repeated the movement until the two sets of fingers touched forming the letter &#8216;M&#8217;.

A starburst of colour surrounded the letter and it moved off to the top left of the screen.

The &#8216;A&#8217; was easily made with Ebony&#8217;s body leaning with her forehead against a full length mirror and her toes about 30� from its base.&nbsp; Her arms, from shoulder to elbow, were clamped against her sides and her forearms at an angle with the fingertips also touching the mirror forming the cross stroke.

Again a starburst and the &#8216;A&#8217; moved left next to the &#8216;M&#8217;.

The music was gradually building as each letter was formed &#8211; use your imagination and you&#8217;ll figure them out &#8211; and as the final one joined the others the full word &#8216;MagnaBind&#8217; filled the screen and the music reached a final crescendo.

The room exploded with applause and Tatianna gave me a big hug.

I took Tati&#8217;s hand and placed it on the head of the immobile figure kneeling beside me.

It was, I thought, a fitting end to my career.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; -30-
