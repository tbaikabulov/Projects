Lots and lots of fluids are exchanged.






Foreword

BDSMLibrary does not have a tag for it, so I am going to spell it out here: this story has elements of horror and �vore�, but no snuff.
I have to make apologies to JC Leathers for using a snippet from his �Tamara's Extreme Bondage� (http://www.bdsmlibrary.com/stories/story.php?storyid=4) in a less than flattering way: it is a really hot story if you are into encasement!
Anybody who writes at the intersection of science fiction and sex ends up being in debt to the great PJ Farmer. His great collection �Strange Relations� and the novel �The Lovers� have been recently republished by Baen, and they are strongly advised. PJ Farmer is not afraid of exploring the weird and the wonderful.

Pearl could not sleep at all. Despite a long day of hiking with a backpack, the excitement of being out on an alien planet on her own was making it impossible for her to close her eyes. She was worried that the following day she would not be rested enough for the rest of the hike, but none of her private tricks for falling asleep would work. She turned on the small tent light and grabbed her pad. Perhaps reading some porn would do the trick. She always slept better after masturbation.

She looked in her frequently renewed stash of porn. Oh yes, a vintage piece that had been recommended by her friend Lisa.

�A fiery blast of magma turned her entire body and mental core into a flooding plain of scintillating sensation when she passed out in an overwhelming tidal wave of whirling star-bursts mixed with the white-hot lances of searing, agonizing shocks.�

Wow. Purple.

�She hung limply unconscious while her torments tapered off; twitching, gasping, and sobbing with relief at their momentary cessation; still hopelessly struggling to free herself.�

Very hot encasement story, actually entombment, but sex and orgasm can only tolerate so much metaphor, Pearl thought. She yawned hopefully and tried just lying down and relaxing. Easy to say but very hard to do. Perhaps if she focused on her breathing... suddenly the loud beeping of the perimeter alarm snapped her out of her reverie. Why had it gone off? The few large animals in this section of the hilly steppes were supposed to be shy herbivores, like the hexapods or the quadros. She sat up on her sleeping pad and opened one flap of her tent. She spotted it immediately - a large quadro was slowly moving uphill towards her, a good fifty meters away.

There is an undercurrent of fear that is always present in the settlers of a new planet. No matter how tame the ecology or how sweet the air tastes, it was still a new place. Planetary survey techniques are very good indeed, and they build upon centuries of accumulated experience. The colonization wave out of Earth had a rich history of success and disaster. The disasters were getting less frequent, but they still happened.

Pearl was not very interested in history. Her role on the ship as a combination photographer and slut was directly related to her focus on the visible and the now. She did not know much about ecology, but she could certainly recognize a good image gathering opportunity when she saw one. She grabbed a tiny recording diadem and put it on with the ease that comes from long practice. The quadro, photographed in the light of the twin moons, could be the highlight of her excursion and the expedition naturalists were going to love her images, since there was much still unknown about the creatures. Which, by the way, were not supposed to go around grazing at night - not that there was much to graze on here. The quadro was slowly getting closer. The thing, and it was hard to think of it as an animal, was shaped like a large, thick, square pillow. It was covered in thick leathery skin that carried a pattern of stripes. Quadros had no limbs, a broad downward facing mouth that was very good at ripping grass out of the ground and an array of tiny eyes strung out on a line around their perimeter. The perimeter was also were their bodies grew. There were two accretion zones, above and below the eye line, and this was also where the odd stripes were generated. Quadros could grow up to six meters wide (or long) and about one meter thick. Nobody knew yet when and how they reproduced, but it was clearly an infrequent event.
Pearl was intensely focused on the creature and she noticed that this particular quadro sported several thin black lines and a thicker black band on the usual brownish background. She was not alarmed at all: quadros had never attacked anyone and they were just slow creatures that moved around the landscape like autonomous mowers, eating up the vegetation. Explorers had even ridden some of the smaller samples on a lark during the first heady days on the planet. It was widely agreed that the only danger they posed was as mobile obstacles to circulation, but electrostatic shock barriers were usually enough to convince them to stay out of camps and off roadways.
Now the quadro crossed a dry riverbed. It was definitely moving in her direction, detouring around bigger rocks and crunching through bare gravel and loose stones. Pearl was very intrigued and excited, and slightly afraid, since quadros were not supposed to be interested in anything outside of grazing. The alien stopped moving approximately fifteen meters from her tent. She squatted and poked her head out of the tent to have a bigger field of view. Then the quadro did something completely unexpected. It curled its four corners upwards, with an audible creaking of its hide. Just as Pearl was shooting more and more images of this bizarre phenomenon, the quadro did something even more unexpected. And terrifying.
It jumped.
In retrospect, Pearl concluded that it had suddenly snapped its four corners on the ground with enormous force.
But at the moment she just heard a loud slapping sound and saw the quadro leap upwards in a cloud of dust. She looked up and realized in a flash that it was going to land on her tent and on her. Without even beginning to feel afraid -there would have been no time for that- she shot out of the tent like a startled rabbit and landed clumsily on a rocky patch. The quadro crashed to the ground stirring up yet more dust and temporarily blinding the girl. Pearl scrabbled to her feet, terrified that the quadro would be coming for her, and started stumbling away from the creature. She barely noticed that she had banged her right knee and scraped her hands on the rough stones.
There was no immediate reason to be afraid, though. The quadro seemed to be doing nothing at all. In fact, the quadro was busy examining the remains of her tent and her camping kit with its huge grazing mouth. It knew that its prey had escaped through some extraordinary moment of luck, but perhaps something in its nest could be of interest. It chewed up everything, detected some disgusting chemical taste and spat out the resulting mess.
Meanwhile Pearl was busy trying to put as much distance as she could between herself and the scene of the attack. She was limping, practically barefoot and without any equipment. When the quadro had attacked she had been wearing her undersuit, a tight garment with that was perfect for a warm tent, but would not keep her warm in the chilly night air. Of course, she had not been wearing any shoes or weapons. Soldiers may sleep with their boots on and their gun ready at hand, but she was not a soldier by a long shot - more of a camp follower if anything. She did have her distress indicator hanging from her neck, a small radio transmitter pendant that would broadcast her location. Unfortunately the planet�s ionosphere was only a weak layer that disappeared by night time, which meant that long distance radios worked only when the sun was up. Which was still quite a few hours away. And of course she had her camera coronet, which was completely useless without the portable data store. That was in the tent. Under the quadro. Or perhaps even inside the quadro, being digested, she thought.
Pearl was shocked but still able to function, in a way. She limped away as fast as possible, all the time conscious that the quadro was probably looking at her. She had no idea how far the creature could leap, but she could assume that its range was limited. Perhaps it also had to rest for a while -she hoped- after such an amazing jump. She was shocked but not particularly afraid: even walking with a limp she was way faster than the quadro and she was convinced that she could lose it easily among the labyrinth of low hills. Of course she would get lost herself, but this was immaterial, since without her tent any place was the same to her. She just had to wait for sunrise, turn on the distress indicator and wait for the rescue team to pick her up somewhere. She kept walking uphill, glancing back every now and then and noticing how well the creature blended in with the background. When she crested the hill she was barely able to see the quadro. She marched on.

Quadros were big, like elephants, or cows. They had no hands or visible limbs. They grazed. They moved on their belly like slugs. They had no sex. They did not make any interesting noises or colors. The human settlers, faced with a big planet full of vastly more interesting creatures, could be excused for focusing their limited research on more interesting topics. There would be time and energy later to investigate everything that lived on the planet. But for now more charismatic fauna had priority, like the hexapods or the landstars. The quadros were like sea cucumbers, probably necessary to some ecological cycle but nothing to get very excited about.
Pearl was not a researcher, just like she was not a soldier. She got her information from the layman�s level multimedia summaries that were produced daily for the non-scientific staff�s benefit. She reasonably assumed that the quadro would just lose interest and wander off to chew on some other piece of landscape. As for herself, she strode on, walking as fast as she could to keep warm.

The quadro was actually quite smart, in its own way. It had classified Pearl as a food creature, just like the hexapods, and it was positive that it was not going to outrun her. Creatures with legs always won in straight runs, even if they limped. No, something else was necessary. The quadro noticed that the ground here was favorable for a certain tactic it had used successfully in the past. That had been about catching hexapods on loose, sandy soil, but the quadro was as adaptable in its behavior as it looked stolid on the outside. There was no guarantee that it would work, but Pearl to him looked like a good sixty kilograms of very good eating. The payoff was worth the inconvenience.

Pearl walked determinedly on. After a while her small injuries stopped hurting, and she started feeling a pleasant sense of elation. After all, this was really high adventure! It was not quite what she was expecting, but the excursion had certainly turned out to be very exciting. Almost too exciting, she thought with a shudder. The scientists were going to be interested in her story, perhaps she was going to be promoted, although the career path for photographer-sluts was not so well defined. And of course there would be celebration parties and plenty of sex. Oooh, sex. That would be nice right now, she thought, somewhat inappropriately. The emotional release after the terror of being so near death cab manifest itself in many ways. Considering her basic psychological configuration, getting horny was a very understandable reaction. She cupped her pussy through the undersuit and squeezed herself tenderly. She could feel her own heat and perhaps even a hint of moisture being wicked out. No, this was stupid. She could not stop to masturbate, and she was sure that she could not do it while walking. Focus. Focus. Fuck-us. No, not now, maybe later, when she was back at the base. She was going to be the heroine, and she was going to demand a commensurate welcome. Perhaps 24 hours of sexual dominance over some of the junior staff would do. She was going to do many things with Lisa. And to Lisa. She would book one of the playrooms, and probably invite Sgt. Andrea-Rose as well. When she divested herself of the privileges of rank the dickgirl Sergeant could be quite amazing: she had a huge versatile cock and an agile tongue. No, no, no! Not now dammit! She could not be thinking about Andrea-Rose now. She had to keep walking, and choose a wise path. And spare her feet, since the undersuit soles had not been designed for long treks.
The girl was making good time despite the occasional distractions. The sky was becoming lighter and dawn was approaching. She did not want to activate the distress indicator too early, since its power source was tiny and limited. She had been instructed to wait until the sun was completely visible before she pushed the two red buttons for five seconds.
As she kept walking, allowing herself the occasional jog to stretch her muscles and keep warm, she realized that her breasts felt heavier. Turning off lactation completely was inconvenient, so she had just turned it as low as possible for the trip. But low did not mean zero, as a sense of moisture around her areolae told her. Of course her mini breast pump and her bra-vests had been in the smashed tent. One more inconvenience to bear, she thought. At a pinch she could suckle herself, probably a good idea since she was carrying no food or water. But she hoped that rescue would arrive before she had to resort to sucking on her own tits and drinking her own pee.
She started walking up a convenient riverbed and suddenly spotted something red and green. Scraps of something red and green. The girl got closer and realized that she was looking at the shredded remains of her own tent and equipment. She had been walking in a huge circle, lost in her fantasies and dreams. She looked around carefully. The quadro was nowhere to be seen. She was very, very nervous now, sweating despite the morning chill. Actually, being back at the tent could be a good thing. Perhaps she could still find something useful. And the bright colored materials would make it easier for a planetary shuttle to see her from above. After all, the quadro could not exactly hide like a snake among the rocks. She could see the outer shell of her precious datastore, chewed and crushed but still mostly intact, and that meant that her photographs and video from this trip were still there! Including the night shots of the big quadro, and the video segment of the jump. This was good, she thought, really prime material.

As she was congratulating herself the ground shuddered as if for a small earthquake. Instead of running away as fast as she could she instinctively looked around for the quadro - and of course the quadro was nowhere on the ground to be seen, as it sailed through the air on its carefully planned parabolic trajectory. She realized her mistake too late and managed only to take a couple of tentative steps before something massive landed loudly very near her. The impact knocked her to the ground. Before she lost consciousness she thought �Well at least I have not been crushed�.

Pearl slowly came to. She was under the alien, and she was alive. She was also pinned to the ground. But she was alive. The quadro appeared to be slowly crawling over her body, exerting a pressure that was grinding her into the rocky soil. It was like being slowly covered by incredibly heavy stiff blankets up to her neck. The quadro carefully positioned its huge mouth over her immobilized body and delicately clamped its enormous lips around her, lifting her off the ground and into itself. Then it did one more amazing thing, but Pearl had fainted by then. It slowly curled itself into a flattened cylinder around the unconscious girl, all the while lifting itself up off the ground. Its bottom surface softened and adapted itself intimately to her form. After a few minutes, the alien had reshaped itself into a huge, six-meter tall drum lying horizontally on the ground, with Perl�s head lolling slackly out of one end. It knew that that food creatures needed some access to the outside world to stay alive. Right then this particular snack was not moving any more, but it was probably just a momentary interruption in its activity.
The girl slowly recovered consciousness. She could not move anything except her head, and she was so dizzy that she did not want to move her head at all. She slowly opened her eyes and realized that she was looking at the landscape upside down from an elevated point. She looked down and saw the quadro wrapped around her. The tough skin had formed radial crinkles around her and she felt like she was held in a huge fist up to her shoulders. Or a huge, half-closed mouth. She realized that she was going to die very soon unless someone found her really fast. The sun was up, and her distress indicator was around her neck, but her hands and arms were securely trapped inside the beast, and no amount of wiggling was going to make them come out.
The horror of her situation was so great that she felt she was going to lose consciousness again. That was when her enhanced physiology kicked in, administering a serious burst of endogenous tranquillizers and regulating her breathing and heart rate. She felt calm, and as a matter of fact there was no pain at all. The quadro was just holding her there. Just as she started feeling a tiny, microscopic amount of relief, she felt things moving around her body. Her undersuit was being gently pulled and stretched, as if kittens were nibbling and scratching it. Her captive hands felt small gripping organs pulling on her fingers and pinching the exposed skin.
She screamed out loud for help and stopped after realizing that it could not possibly make one little bit of difference. She had been captured by this monster, and she could do exactly nothing, except wait for a stroke of luck that would let her activate the distress indicator.

Quadros all had a similar appearance, but this particular individual came from a genetic line that had wandered in the direction of intelligence, memory and even something that approached scientific observation. It had accumulated a wealth of information about its environment, with a particular focus on the flora and the fauna. Quadros led solitary lives and avoided each other, so they had very little in the way of communication abilities, but they had the ability of passing a portion of their memories to their descendants. Having no social life at all, the quadro species did not shine for its ethics or compassion. Feeling concern for any other living creature except oneself was completely impossible for a quadro: they were unable to behave kindly, just like cats are unable to behave like herd animals. The instincts were simply not there. Still, Pearl had been lucky in her predicament, because a dumber quadro would just have eaten her as soon as it got its mouth on any part of her body. This quadro was curious - of course it would eat her in the end, but before doing that it was going to extract a maximum of information and entertainment.
The quadro�s current intellectual problem now was Pearl�s undersuit. The quadro noticed that it did not cover all of her. It also noticed that when it pinched the garment practically nothing happened, while when it pinched her hands she would react by trying to get away. It concluded that the undersuit was some sort of insensitive outer covering, similar to the black fur on hexapods. This fit with his previous experiences, and it meant that the covering could be removed. It inserted a thin, slimy appendage into one of the wrist openings and worked it up the sleeve. After wiggling around her chest and making a cursory inspection of all the space between the undersuit and her body, the quadro concluded that its assumptions were right. A tiny sharp tooth emerged at the end of the tentacle and after a few minutes of pulling, stretching and twisting the undersuit had been reduced to shreds. The quadro stored the textile mess in a vacuole for later inspection, and turned its attention to the shivering body of the girl.

Pearl�s whole body was now in contact with the alien flesh. Despite the artificial calm that had descended upon her, some parts of her mind were so terrified that she pissed herself. The quadro was intrigued by the stream of chemicals issuing from the girl�s shivering body; they tasted good, the vanguard of the many more juices and flavors that the prey was going to yield. The quadro, building on accumulated knowledge about animals, knew all about skin and orifices. This particular creature seemed to have a few ports at the junction of its lower limbs. One was clearly the source of the flavourful warm liquid, but what about the others?

Pearl felt that her anus was being delicately touched by some undefinable object. She instinctively clenched her asscheeks, but the quadro loved a challenge and pushed forward into her, careful not to stretch the opening beyond its elastic limits. Pearl had been fucked by bigger things, but never so deeply or so smoothly. The tentacle oozed lubricant at its tip, and it kept entering her as the quadro went on an enthusiastic visit of her bowels. It encountered excrement, of course, and gobbled it up greedily. More delicious half-processed food! Nothing in its experience had been quite so tasty and unusual. Pearl wasn�t a stranger to anal penetration but this was not sex. This was an outright invasion of her body. Her belly felt strangely heavy with the coils of alien gelatinous tube. There was no outright pain, what was disturbing was the knowledge that her own body was completely out of her control, and that the alien could do anything it wanted. Her bowels reacted to the intrusion by producing more lubricant. Apricot, she thought. Today my ass tastes like apricot. She hoped that the quadro liked the apricot jelly.

As the quadro continued its exploration of the girl�s intestines, the sun started warming the chilly air. Oh, if only she had turned on the distress indicator before! Now she doubted whether she was ever going to be allowed to reach it. The quadro had different concerns, because it knew that other predators were roaming the hills. They would not dare attack a quadro or even a wandering human, but a human so immobilized and defenseless would be too much of a temptation. Pearl was not the first animal that the alien had captured and inspected in this way. There was an established procedure by now, a solution that the quadro was quite proud of. It was, of course, utterly terrifying for the prey but -as we mentioned- empathy was not its strong point.

Something emerged from between Pearl�s breasts. The orifice had partially loosened to allow a thick stalk to emerge and push a purple, cup-shaped organ into the air, like a corolla reaching for the air. The stalk bent and twisted to point the cup at Pearl�s face.

She was prepared for writhing anemone tentacles. She was prepared for pulsating flesh horrors. She was not prepared for teeth or claws, but she would not have been too surprised. What she was completely unprepared for, though, was her own face. She could see her own features, rendered in detail on the bottom of the shallow cup that was even then approaching slowly her face. When the organ was almost in contact with her skin she realized, in the last glimpse of light, that what she was seeing was a negative representation of her face, like a mask made to adapt to every detail. Like a death-mask in an old novel, she thought. Then the thing fastened itself to her head, covering half of it and applying a light suction. She tried hard not to panic and adapt once more. It was not trying to kill her in this way, there would have been much easier... easier, of course, according to human rationality, but what if this was the only way the quadro could kill? Through suffocation? What was... but then she felt something gently tapping her lips.

Pearl opened her mouth slowly, and felt a wonderful breath of air enter her lungs. Warmed, humidified outside air was getting to her through the thick stalk, and exhausted air was being vented out, she did not know nor care how. Breath, Pearl, just like when they kept you in the encasement suit for twelve hours and you had all those strange hallucinations, thanks also to the white noise soundtrack and occasional flashes of imagery that were piped in the videoglasses. Just breath, it is all you can do and all you have to do.

The quadro was satisfied that the head mask was well connected to Pearl�s head, and that her atmospheric feed was working. The first human it had tried this on had died, unfortunately, but an accurate anatomic inspection had allowed the quadro to learn from his mistakes. Air goes in the frontal tube, and food in the posterior tube. Leave alone the weird flappy thing behind the tongue. Don�t poke anything down the air tube. Air must be humid... it all builds up to useful knowledge, the quadro thought. How many things was it going to learn from this new delectable specimen?

Pearl felt herself move into the quadro. The orifice tightened around her shoulders and travelled up her neck, it widened to accommodate her head and then closed, excruciatingly slowly, over the crown of her head. The girl was still very scared, but she rationalized -again, human rationality, but that was all she had- that the creature would not have gone to the trouble of providing her with an air supply if it had been planning to kill her immediately. Unless this was not an air supply at all, she thought. She found herself completly encapsulated in a hot, humid darkness. Her limbs were able to make small movements, but she could not grasp anything with her hands. The quadro�s slick rubbery flesh had formed itself into tubes around her legs and arms, offering no purchase or grip.

Now the huge alien felt finally comfortable. The prey was completely inside, and the investigation could proceed. For example, what was this moist and soft opening, edged by a pair of fleshy flaps? Smaller tendrils, then tentacles not bigger than a strand of spaghetti, then a fleshy probe cautiously entered her, as the quadro explored carefully. The opening was connected to a flesh tube that extended into the girl�s torso for quite a distance and then ended in a tight ring. The girl, because of her professional vocation, had an exceptionally fit and muscular pussy, adapted to all sizes of genitalia and most sexual practices. Pearl�s vagina ended with a sphincter that opened into a soft reservoir pocket, constantly full of hot slippery lubricant. The few men that had managed to get their penis all the way in there had raved about the sensation: the sphincter would tighten around the corona groove at the base of their glans, which would be in turn bathed in gel and massaged from all sides. The quadro withdrew the probe and spent a few minutes adapting it: mostly growing it in length and girth, to fit the odd juicy tube it had just discovered. Acting on impulse, it also added bumps and ridges. The smaller tentacles fastened on Pearl�s labia and gently but firmly opened her pussy. The probe, now much thicker and provided with a bulbous head, penetrated the girl very slowly. Pearl moaned uncontrollably as she felt the novel invasion of her body. God, but this was big. Huge. The biggest cock she had ever had, she thought vaguely... no, it was not a cock, it was an alien creature�s fuck-tool, plundering her body... stay real, Pearl, please stay real - this is what a small part of her mind kept repeating. But the bigger part of her mind was by now completely lost in the sensations that were radiating from her belly. By then, her pussy had been filled to its limits, and the big knobby head was slowly dilating her inner sphincter. Pearl felt a huge orgasm coming on, racing in without mercy. She spasmed wildly as her pussy finally yelded - the deep sphincter opened, and she felt the giant probe squelch into her deepest core and start sucking, and then she blacked out again. The quadro itself was very appreciative as the girl�s vagina had yet a different novel taste, namely green apples. Something completely unknown on this planet, and yet strangely appealing to her captor.

It rotated the girl inside of itself, placing her in a good approximation of the standard gynecological position, and it went on ramming in and out of her and sucking her vaginal and anal gels. Pearl slowly came back to consciousness. She had stopped fearing that every breath could be the last, but she greeted with shivers of fear every small change in her environment. She had an image of a giant mouth playing with a morself of food, rolling it around and exploring it with its tongue, finally aligning it properly for swallowing. Although in this case there could be no swallowing, but perhaps - she couldn�t think properly, and she did not want to think properly. The only solution was to hold on to the instant. She was alive. One hearbeat, and she was still alive. One more.

This creature was a real fountain of juices, it thought. Even better than the last hexapod it had captured, although that one had been exceptional for different reasons. Hexapods were shy herbivores that grazed in herds; highly social, fast and very flighty, they were more than a match for the quadros that could hunt them only through ambush techniques. Two planet weeks ago, the quadro had buried itself in wet river sand almost completely, counting only on ground vibrations to detect the approaching preys. It had been a long and uncomfortable wait, but when the hexapods came they were very numerous. It detected that a cluster of them had stopped in a tight group, and it jumped. While in the air it noticed in a flash that an unusually large and swollen hexapod was laying on the ground, apparently unable to move and surrounded by others. The quadro could exert very little control on its trajectory, but it could change its shape in flight, to influence which parts of its flat body hit the ground first. It twisted itself quickly and crash landed on its prey crushing one of its twitching legs, but keeping the animal alive. All the other hexapods had bolted away at a safe distance. They knew that it could not jump again soon, and they also knew that they could do nothing at all for their companion. So they went about their business and kept an eye on the quadro, which ignored them as it was busy encasing its prey for study and consumption.
The hexapod was kicking with its legs and thrashing its head around. Short thick tentacles shot out of the quadro�s mouth slit and grabbed the hexapod�s legs. A longer one wrapped around the animal�s head and closed its weakly biting mouth. The quadro folded the thin legs of the herbivore and slowly swallowed it after encasing its head just like it would do with Pearl. The other hexapods kept looking on stupidly. The entrapped animal went into a paroxysm of flailing terror, which did it very little good as the irritated quadro encased the six limbs in vacuoles and tidily amputated them near the body. The vacuole lips dissolved the flesh and cut through the articulation, coagulating the blood and leaving behind very neat hollows. The quadro then ignored the hexapod for a while as it busied itself with examining the six legs. It dissolved them in layers and enjoyed the strong calcium flavor of the bones. It was hard to come by good sources of calcium. Then the big hexapod started doing something unusual - one of its openings dilated and a miniature hexapod came out! The tiny creature started crawling on its mother�s furry belly until it found a spot it liked and fastened there. More baby hexapods followed, each one attaching itself to its mother at regularly spaced spots on her belly. So this was why the hexapod had been so large and clumsy! The quadro examined carefully the small creatures and noticed that they were extracting some sort of fluid from the big one. Delicious, it thought, as it attached sucking tentacles to some unoccupied leaking spots. After a few hours of study of the baby hexapods, it concluded that they were not very interesting. If anything, they were even more limited than the big ones. He detached their squirming bodies from their mother and attached sucking tentacles in place. Then it bagged all of the tiny hexapod replicas into digestive vacuoles and absorbed them off-handedly. Their hairless, soft bodies were particularly easy to digest, it noticed. The mother noticed that something was wrong, but since the babies were still sucking hard although she could not see them, everything had to be fine. Eventually, the hexapod started feeling very hungry and thirsty, and the flow of milk started to dry up. The quadro stuffed a hollow tentacle down its resisting throat and pumped its stomach full of vegetable slurry. After the feeding and some harder sucking the milk reappared. The quadro eventually fed the hexapod all the vegetable slurry it had accumulated into one of its stomachs. Then, quite regretfully because it had come to really like the milk, it absorbed the animal very slowly, performing as it were a vivisection that it coldly prolonged as much as possible. The hexapod suffered a great deal and the quadro learned many things.

Pearl�s breasts by now were very full, and they started leaking dribbles of milk. Pearl did not notice, since she was already soaked in fluids and the brutal sensations from her pussy and ass where all she could focus on. But the quadro had an acute awareness of its internal environments, much like a human can feel even very tiny objects with his tongue. It cheered silently: one more amazing fluid from the prey! High in calcium, fat and sugars, Pearl�s milk was much more nutritious than her calorie-free vaginal and anal secretions. Almost everybody who had tasted it appreciated it, and the quadro was no exception. It ingeniously applied the same sucking tentacles it had used on the hexapod and started pumping. Soon it realized that harder sucking did not bring out more milk and it merely made its prey more inconveniently agitated. It settled on a steady rhythm. After a few hours it realized that external stimulation of the milk producing organs increased the flow, which had been progressively degrading. The quadro noticed more worrying signs, such as increased core temperature and a reduction in the volume of the secretions. Pearl would have felt light headed, but again the general level of stimulation was just too high to pay attention to something as simple and benign as hunger. Its previous experiences with the hexapod made the quadro confident that it had a solution. Pearl detachedly felt something slide down her throat and into her stomach. The tentacle then dilated inside her, anchoring itself firmly. Then she felt her stomach being filled. The mixture of semi-processed vegetables and digested hexapod flesh would have made her throw up if she had tasted it, but this could not happen since it was being directly delivered to her starving stomach.
Oddly enough, being force fed like a fattened goose felt like the bottom of degradation. Having even that most basic of faculty taken over by the alien creature was even more wrong than being milked. After all, her tits had been made to be milked. And her throat had been made to be fucked. Not fed, she thought. Not like this.

The quadro thought that it had a pretty good thing going. But how long was it going to last? Luckily this prey, as evidenced by the dental formula, was an omnivore. This meant more feeding options, but still the alien�s reservoirs were not that large, and the levels of slurry were going down fast. The long day of the planet was still in its morning, and the quadro realized that at the present rates it would run out of stored food in the middle of the equally long night. Then it would find itself without food, except for Pearl�s body, in the middle of a wasteland at nighttime, when most prey stayed hidden. The quadro was very careful about its safety, which is why it had reached its remarkable size and age and it did not like this scenario. It decided that it would absorb the girl at nightfall, and then travel towards greener areas. Yes, this felt pleasantly safe and doable. And it meant more hours of pleasure and delicious tasting juices.

Pearl had no way to guess that her destiny had been already decided. She tried to think. There had to be a solution, there had to be a way out. Force was completely on the side of her captor. What about smarts? Pearl had no way of knowing exactly how smart the quadro was, but its actions so far betrayed a frightening amount of intelligence. The way it had caught her, by playing on its strengths and minimizing its disadvantages. The way it was manipulating her body and exploring its responses. The quadro, perhaps, was not as intelligent as a human but it was not so far below. Perhaps even above if one subscribed to the old medieval view of a linear scale of intelligence. How do you outsmart a completely alien intelligence? Winning against the quadro was not a reasonable target. And besides, Pearl thought, she did not want to win. She merely wanted to survive and not be eaten. Oh nonono, don�t eat me, she moaned. Despite her terror, the autonomous systems of her vagina and anus continued secreting jelly and her sizable breasts continued making milk. The terrified girl tried again to muster some rationality. What do all living creatures, terrestrial or alien, intelligent or dumb, have in common? They want some things and avoid some others. They desire. Stupid beasts satisfy their desires by grabbing. Smarter animals cooperate, sometimes even with other species, and invent elaborate and effective ways to get what they want, like industrial agriculture, animal husbandry and algal farming. Everybody profits: the evolutionary success of cows and dogs, once they had become useful to men, had been amazing. As a species, they had gotten a great deal.

Pearl simply had to become useful to the quadro. But how could she be even more useful than she was, she thought. It was already taking everything it could. Clearly her saliva and her tears did not turn it on so much. The quadro was fucking her at a steady pace, and she had just enough freedom of movement to fuck back, something the quadro noticed. This was another important moment, it thought, just like when she had willingly opened her mouth. Another defining moment in their necessarily brief relationship, a moment to be celebrated. The quadro increased the size of its fucking probes by a half-inch. Pearl felt a dull pain and instinctively issued protective commands to her enhanced anatomy. She was a professional fuckslut after all: her amazing pussy slowly relaxed certain deep set muscle rings, and after some minutes it reached a size that would accommodate the enlarged penis. Not a penis, Pearl, a tentacle: stay real, she said to herself. The quadro was surprised, and reacted by growing some more. This turned into a brief arms race that Pearl was destined to lose. She hit her hard size limits: everything that could be relaxed had been relaxed, her pussy was now a huge flesh tunnel and her ass could accommodate a pony cock. She had never been so open in her memory, including when Lisa had wanted to try two handed fisting. But this was still not enough, as the quadro kept growing inside her. In retaliation, she turned off the jelly production. Interesting, the quadro thought, this little soft creature is trying to... the quadro did not know the concept of bargaining, but it came pretty close to inventing it. It deflated its cocks a tiny bit, and the jelly started flowing. It deflated them by one whole inch. Pearl felt more comfortable and she started juicing full force again. One-zero for me, she thought.

That was good, she thought. Perhaps she could try to reward the quadro. She activated a layer of totipotent staminal cells in her labia, and started growing a flesh tube, a sleeve-like textured extension of her pussy that tightened itself around the big penis, yes, penis, let�s face it. She extended the sleeve as far as she could, making it thick and muscular. The inside was lined with a very slippery ribbed mucosa. The quadro seemed to enjoy the extra stimulation and it started fucking her at a higher pace.Then she fell into a strange lull of time, peaceful but punctuated by sudden violent orgasms. She thought about the next card she had to play. The game was, she realized, to keep the alien entertained. As long as she kept its interest up, it probably would not eat her. But there was only so much her body could do, so she had to pace herself. The quadro was doing a good job of keeping her comfortable, she realized. It was like a living spacesuit, in a certain sense. Or a tent. A movable tent. A movable tent with an array of sex toys. Pearl realized that during this battle with the quadro she was also in danger of losing her mind. This was an inhuman situation, something that she had not been prepared for. Although, perhaps, the heavy enclosement sessions with Andrea-Rose had come close to this. The Sergeant had a big, muscular cock and she liked teasing Pearl after wrapping her in layers of constrictive black plastic. Pearl would feel her pussy gape and drip, as Andrea-Rose slowly took her halfway. The fat cock could flex inside her and wriggle like a trapped snake. The she would whisper in her ear, making her beg for the rest of it. And beg she would. She let the fond memories take her away to a happy time, to the many hours spent in her comfortable room being fucked silly by many people, singly, in couples and in groups, but only during the weekend. Group sex left her drained of energy, which meant that she could not perform properly on her photography assignments the following day.

Pearl knew exactly how big her breasts could get. She knew because she had made them just that big once, on Lisa�s birthday. The girl had a breast fetish, and Pearl had made sure she would get all she could handle. Despite the special support corset she had been barely able to walk. The high heels did not help with her balance either. She did not do a lot of walking though, as Lisa had immediately dragged her to her couch. They had not measured her output, but she was sure that it had been around four liters per day. Perhaps even five.
Pearl issued the mental command that would start the growth cascade and felt her breasts get warmer as the glandular masses started increasing. When she had done it for Lisa, she had taken two days to reach her full potential. Now she would not have that luxury. She chose crash speed, and damn the stretch marks. That was what cosmetic medicine was for, she thought.

The quadro noticed and approved. It dedicated two more tentacles to massaging her growing breasts, and increased the power of the sucking tentacles. This was all very good, it thought, but it *still* had to finish at nightfall. It fed her more slurry as a reward, and then it realized that the solution had been there all the time, in its repertoire of tricks. It swiftly formed four large vacuoles and applied them to her arms and legs. She had the impression that someone was putting very tight rubber stockings and gloves on her. This was very bizarre, she thought, almost bizarre in a nice way. The vacuoles mouths tightened around her thighs and her shoulders, and their lips started secreting enzymes that dissolved her skin. Four burning rings of pain appeared in her mind, more painful than any bondage she had ever been in. Then the rings started sinking into her flesh and unconsciousness claimed her again, which did not bother the quadro in the least. The alien finished tidily removing her limbs and consumed them. She was going to taste so good when it would eat all of her, it thought, as it lingered over the last unrecognizable shreds of flesh. And, thanks to her reduced metabolic demands, it was going to manage to keep her alive overnight! The quadro quietly enjoyed its own brilliance. It briefly regretted not having amputated her much earlier, but it was all good, solid learning, to be applied to its next victim. The quadro deployed more ad hoc specialized structures to hold Pearl steady as it continued enjoying her.

Pearl slowly returned to a kind of consciousness. It was all dark. She tried to touch her face to remove the rubber hood she had clearly been forced to wear. That did not work. She could not move her hands. She could not feel her hands or feet. Or arms. Or legs. Then the terrible reality of what had been done to her came rushing back and she started crying and sobbing into her mask. The quadro remembered that the hexapod had also been quite distressed after its limbs had been amputated - what was the point, it thought, the limbs had been completely useless under the circumstances. There was no reason for agitation, the quadro thought as it fucked the captive girl harder. That was, in retrospect, when she had began really losing her mind. She felt that she had been glued to some large, flat floppy surface. Like a tongue, she thought, and then she tried to unthink it but it was too late. Her brief flashes of rationality between orgasms were spent on feeling alternately hopeful and dejected. She was able to think only in snatches.

�Rescue will be here soon, someone has to start looking for me�
�I am screwed. Soon it will get tired and eat me�
�Mitochondria are essential organelles of many living cells, and we know that they have derived from ancient bacteria that eventually became part of other beings. Perhaps I will become a part of this quadro, one of his organs.�
�How long this can go on�
�Why don�t they rescue me already?�
�His cocks are so fucking BIG! This is the deepest I have been fucked, I can feel every ridge and every bump as it goes in and out of me�
�My pussy sleeve feels really good. I must do this again�
�I am going to die inside this thing and nobody is ever going to know�
�My tits are enormous�


She had no way of measuring time, as her neural implants did not include a real time clock. It had never been necessary and she was not a fan of useless brain gadgets. There was an interval of lucidity. A long one. The fucking was slowing down. The sucking was getting weaker. And she was turning on her axis. Now she was face down. Perhaps, she thought bitterly, it was time for doggie style. She felt something terribly cold against her moist, overheated skin. What was this, water? What was happening? Was she being dropped into some sort of stomach to be digested?

The quadro�s giant fucklimbs entered her for a last time and then slipped out of her dilated openings. They did not return. There was more space around her, a vague feeling of movement. Oh no, it was going to eat her. The feeding tube retracted hastily from her throat and she coughed briefly with a strange muffled noise. The first real sound she had really heard in many hours. Her terror reached its peak when she felt the mask detach from her face. Of course, she thought, it was preparing itself to consume her, just like it had consumed her arms and her legs. No need to feed her or make sure she could breathe. She did not want to die, but there was nothing she could do. She screwed her eyes closed in a desperate reflex of self-protection. She felt something touch her eyelids and scrub them softly. What was this cold crap flowing all over her? Oh God, what was this last insanity going to be, was it going to do something horrible to her eyes? Why couldn�t it just kill her and be done with it? She desperately snapped her teeth at the thing that was touching her eyelids and heard another sound. A yelp.

She realized that she had been hearing sounds for some seconds now. Sounds. Wind. The cold stuff was air, but it felt like ice water on her soaked body. A human voice. Of course she had heard and seen a lot of hallucination in the sensory deprivation environment where she had spent the last hours. But this one was persistent, and finally her eyes opened to the harsh red light of the setting sun.

�Jesus, what the fuck happened to you? Where... How long have you been... Cripes, I could not get here faster and... talk about biting the hand.�

Pearl found herself lying prone in messy squishy stuff. Her head was turned sidewise and she found herself staring up at the face of Sergeant Andrea-Rose. The tall blonde was looking at her with an expression of horror and compassion. She tried to compose her features and kneeled down to run a first medical check on Pearl. The poor girl seemed to be in good conditions for someone who had just gone through forty hours of alien rape, force feeding, encasement and amputation. Her heart rate was steady, she was properly hydrated and her wounds were covered with a rubbery white material. There were no signs of infection in her bloodstream. Pearl was slowly coming back to reality. The quadro had turned back into its basic square pillow form, but it appeared to be extremely relaxed, flatter and bigger. Its upper surface was awash in fluid that partially covered many floppy tentacles, large and small. The Sergeant spoke to her as she stroked what was left of her body. For now she was going to leave Pearl resting on the quadro�s distended internal flesh. At least it was soft.

�We can use prosthetic limbs and then regrow yours in a few weeks. It will be almost as good as new. Don�t try to speak yet, your throat is raw from that tube... here, breath this in, deeply, it will help. When you failed to send in a new batch of photographs in the morning we started worrying, but you didn�t send any distress signal. Your datastore, though, sent its own hardware failure signal. We reasoned that something had probably happened to you and I flew out to investigate. The datastore ran out of power after a while so I had a bad fix on you. But I kept searching, and so did the satellite imagery guys back at the base. Have some water, here.�

Pearl coughed and cautiously sipped some cool water from a straw. Andrea-Rose looked at the defenseless girl and felt a surge of desire. This was wrong, she thought. Her first concern should be Pearl�s safety.

�Let me turn you face up so you can straighten your neck. Now I will get the hair off your face, much better, right? Poor dear, you did all you could. And you made it. I am so sorry, it must hurt so bad.�

Andrea-Rose took in Pearl�s amazingly large breasts and noticed the surprisingly large pussy sleeve that emerged from the girl�s groin. She realized how far her friend had gone to survive, and she admired her inventiveness.

�You are not the first. There has been at least another case close to HQ, but it happened last night, so we could not radio out a warning. Nobody had ever taken the quadros seriously, although there had been some suspicion after a mysterious disappearance one month ago. People used to ride them for fun! Anyway, we were not able to rescue the other victim. For some reason, the quadro... perhaps it felt uncomfortable being in an area inhabited by many humans, and it ate him right away. We acted very fast, did a crash investigation on quadros and found out that standard neural control devices developed for other local creatures work quite well. I just slapped one on this quadro, destroyed its upper neural functions and forced it to turn over and relax in the flat position. I just hoped you would still be alive. Now we are debating whether to hunt them down to extinction or use them, though nobody knows what for.�

Pearl had slowly returned to an approximately normal state of mind. Or at least as normal as it could be expected. She was nauseous, cold and hungry. The slime on her body was beginning to dry into a sticky slime. And she felt that her body was a grotesque wreck, something that had been violated and abused to a level that went beyond a mere assault on the flesh. She knew that she had spent only hours inside the quadro, but for her it had been an eternity of rape. She felt that she had fully submitted to the beast. In refashioning her anatomy, she had become an accomplice of the quadro�s vicious greed.

�Andy�, she said between tears, �I know that my body can be fixed, but... the things it did to me, the things I just had to do to stay alive... I have remade myself into a sex toy, or not even that, just a thing, a tool for the quadro. I forced myself to feel pleasure while being fucked by that monster, so that I could stay alive, and keep feeding it milk and pussy jelly and whatever it wanted from me.�

�No, Pearl, you are a very brave girl, you did what was necessary. It was a hard bargain, but you came out on top.�

�No, Andy, I cannot lie to you, I did not force myself, it made me feel pleasure, and I did. I gave in. It was horrible and by far those were the best orgasms I ever had. Andy, can you control the quadro? I know you can. I want you to fuck me, right now, right on top of it. I want you to use the quadro for our pleasure, just like it used me.�

Andrea-Rose could not believe what she was hearing, but her fat cock twitched inside her regulation pants. This was insane, she thought with the regulatory part of her mind, there was no way she was going to do it. But another part of her mind took over, and she felt herself unzipping her pants and turning on the neural control device that had been implanted in her cerebellum. She forced the lobotomized quadro to raise Pearl�s body to the right height for fucking. Her cock sprang out and she stuffed it inside the amputated girl�s throat. Uhmmm... always so soft... she fucked her face to the accompaniment of mewling and gurgling sounds until her cock was covered in slippery saliva. Then she issued careful commands to the quadro�s body and rotated Pearl until her ass was properly presented. She realized that no human cock, however enhanced, could satisfy the girl�s pussy in its current state, so she gently placed her cockhead on the spasming anus in front of her.

Pearl was moaning incoherently but clearly. �fuckmefuckmefuck� was what it sounded like. The Sergeant threw all caution to the wind and took over more of the quadro�s functions. Tentacles rose from the messy surface of the alien and plugged themselves into every available orifice. The giant quadro cock entered once again Pearl�s pussy; she felt like a puppet, impaled and controlled, completely in the hands of her talented lover. Andrea-Rose was very good with the neural control device, but normally she limited herself to behavioral control and delicate alterations. Since she did not care at all for the quadro�s welfare or survival she did some rough and ready rearrangement. She routed the beast�s internal piping to conduct Pearl�s milk from the sucking tentacles to the flesh hose that she herself was sucking on, and as a last touch she designated a tentacle for her own anal pleasure and loaded into the quadro a 30-minute steady fucking program followed by rapid widespread necrosis - there would be no mercy for this thing that had hurt her precious little girl. She made her penis twitch and felt an answering squeeze that made her smile inside. Such a precious little girl slut. So... precious... and... juicy.

The automated cameras on Andrea-Rose�s vehicle were streaming the scene back to the base. It was going to become the most popular segment of 3-D video data on the network. Pearl would be promoted to Corporal and lord it over the other three expedition sluts.

But for now, Pearl�s eyes were closed. She was, once more, being fucked from every side but now she was gently held in mid-air, gently bathed in pleasure, delicately suckled and firmly gripped by the Sergeant�s gloved hands on her hips. As she felt one more cock enter her mouth, an image from her art education classes flashed into her mind: Hokusai�s �Dream of the Fisherman's Wife�. A pale Japanese woman, making love with two octopi. She gives in to the molluscs� limbs and throws her head back in ecstasy.
