Synopsis: disowned and exiled, Emily learns first hand the cruelty of slavery         






The sentence had been passed. The only sentence that could have been passed under the circumstances, and Emily let her head fall as she heard it.

There would be no appeal, the evidence had been given correctly, and faultlessly, and she knew that any appeal she made would fail. Even to appeal against the sentence would be futile. For this offence their was only one sentence, and that was what she had been given.

Even though she had been expecting it, Emily was still a little shocked when it had been announced, and now two burly prison officers were grabbing her arms and dragging her down the steps at the back of the defendants stand.

She caught sight of her mother from the corner of her eye, but the glare she saw was more upsetting than the sentence itself. Her mother would, no doubt, disown her before the day was through. It would appear in the local paper as they always did, that Emily Watson was disowned by her family, and that her mother was sorry to have given birth to her.

Over the past six months, since the new laws came into force, there had been numerous notices of dis-ownership. The new laws. These had come when the new owner took over the Island. The first thing he had done was change many of the laws, and decided on his own penalties for various crimes. Breaking curfew meant thirty lashes of the birch in the public square. Emily had seen this happen three times, and on each occasion the girl birched had to be helped down from the post, and carried to the hospital wing. 

Right now, Emily wished she had simply been caught breaking curfew, but she was never going to be that lucky. 

Curfew was only for the female section of the Islanders, and then only the unmarried ones. This was, according to the new owner, to ensure that the younger females did not display wantonness. 

It had been the previous Friday when Emily had met Gerry in the shop. He had suggested that they go sailing on the Island&#8217;s lake, as it was only six in the evening, and she would have plenty of time to get home safely afterwards. Having met Gerry a couple of times before, and quite fancying him anyway, Emily had said yes, and off they had gone.

Quite how it had happened she was unsure, but the boating excursion had taken longer than expected, and she lost track of time. The wine may have helped, as she did feel a little light headed after only one or two glasses. had she known the truth, she would have been even more upset.

It was only when the police caught her having sex with Gerry, after curfew, that she realised the severity of her troubles. Unmarried sex was totally forbidden, plus she was out after curfew, and a single female.

She tried to explain that she was drunk, and didn&#8217;t know what she was doing, but she knew this would bear no weight when she appeared at court on the Monday morning, and it hadn&#8217;t done. The full weight of the law had been brought down on her.

Gerry had given evidence that the boat trip and the sex were both Emily&#8217;s idea, and he had simply gone along with her on both to stop her pestering him even more than she had already been doing. The shop keeper. A man in his late 50&#8217;s had given evidence that Emily had, in fact, approached Gerry, and had suggested the boat ride, adding that this was not the first time she had asked Gerry, and another man, Steven, who worked in the shop next door. When called to give evidence Steven simply agreed to what had been said, and Emily&#8217;s fate had been sealed.

Now, alone in the cells, she cried. 

If only her mother would come and talk to her, so Emily could explain that the evidence was false. But that was never going to happen. The evidence was given correctly and faultlessly, from the prosecution&#8217;s point of view, and her defence lawyer had been unable to find fault with it, and had pleaded guilty on her behalf.

No appeal would be heard, Emily knew this, and knew what her fate would be. She didn&#8217;t need the court Justice to read out the sentence, she already knew what it was going to be.

Just then the chains on the door rattled and her defence lawyer entered the cell.

�Well, Emily� he started. �Your mother has just announced that she has disowned you, so you no longer own the name&nbsp; Emily Watson. This name will be scrubbed from all records in accordance with the new laws. The court has decided you will now be known simply as 27. you will have no belongings of your own, and in a few minutes your clothes and jewellery will be taken from you. The court has decided that under the circumstances, in that you were found naked and having sex, you will not be issued with public clothing, and shall now remain naked. The number 27 will be burned onto your left upper arm, where everyone can see it�

�Why is this happening?� Cried Emily.

�You know why� answered the lawyer. �You have been found guilty of unmarried sex, breaking curfew and enticing men to have sex with you. Your mother has disowned you so you no longer exist as Emily Watson. From now on you will be 27, nothing more. You will be taken to the far side of the Island tomorrow morning, where you will stay indefinitely. Perhaps, if the law ever changes, you may be allowed back within the compound, but that seems unlikely at this time. Remember, should you wander over to this side of the Island at any time, you break yet another law, and the sentence for that is 100 strokes of the whip. To date, no-one has ever survived that punishment. Also remember, there would be no need to take you before the Justice should you be caught here. Simply being caught here would be sufficient.�

With this the lawyer turned on his heels and left the cell, slamming the heavy metal grating behind him, and leaving Emily to consider her fate.

A few minutes later the two prison guards who had led her down to the cells re-appeared and entered the cell.

�Undress and place all your items in the basket� said the first guard. �Jewellery. Watches and rings as well.�

�But please� started Emily. �The watch was a gift from my mother. Cannot I keep it?�

�Since about an hour ago you have no mother, never have had, and in fact, have never existed. Mrs Watson has expressly asked that we make sure the watch is returned to her. now get a move on, or you will be whipped.�

Emily could not control the tears as she slowly started to undress, trying her best to hide her feminine parts from the eyes of the prying men. But she knew this was a futile attempt at modesty, soon she would be fully on display, and at the mercy of any male who wanted her. she would not be allowed to come to this side of the Island, but the men were allowed to cross to the other side, and help themselves to the exiles, of which Emily was going to be added to the ranks.

Naked and shivering, she stood in the centre of the cell. One of the guards brought her arms back behind her, and she felt the cold metal of cuffs as they snapped into place around her wrists.

They brought her out of the cell and along a dark passageway, holding her up when she started to droop. At the end of the passage was an open door, and lights shining though it. Emily was brought into the room, and placed in a chair. Before being strapped to it. 

She could see the brazier burning in the centre of the room, less than five feet away from her, and knew that the iron standing out from it,. one end still on the flames, was going to be the number 27 she had been told would be burned into her arm.

At that moment the Justice entered the room from a door out of the prisoner&#8217;s sight, and walked in front of her.

�27. you have been found guilty of serious crimes and will be exiled at first light. You will be issued no public clothing, and will be allowed no personal property. Your former name has been obliterated from all records. You never existed. In a few minutes your number will be branded onto you, which will stay with you for life. As you know, there will be no appeal, and so no reason to delay the sentence being carried out. Think yourself lucky that we decided simply to exile you. You could have been birched first. It was only because your lawyer decided on your behalf to plead guilty that you escaped it. I understand you were going to fight the charges but that would have meant the birch, and you would still have been exiled.�

The Justice then walked over to the brazier and withdrew the red hot metal from the flames. Emily tried to shy away from it as the Justice moved closer to her, but the two prison officers ensured that she could not move.

A high agonising scream filled the room, and it took several seconds for Emily to realise it was her own scream, as the red hot metal burned its way onto and into her flesh. How long it was held there she was unaware, but it felt like an eternity. Only when she passed out did the Justice move the metal away from her arm. And one of the prison guards threw cold water over the wound to stop it burning any more.

The ugly black mark, hardly recognise-able yet as her number, would live with Emily for the rest of her life.

By the time 27 had regained consciousness, she was shackled hand and foot, and had been placed in a cage on the back of a cart in the yard of the prison. Her arm hurt more than any pain she had ever felt before, and as the cart moved forwards over the bumpy ground, she felt it more and more. She looked down at the branding, only to see blackened seared flesh, the number visible, but not as clear yet as it would become when it healed.

The metal gates of the prison opened, as the cart neared it, driven by two prison guards, allowing 27 her last views of the world she had known. Her mother stood outside the gates and glared at her as the cart moved slowly past. 27 could not help the tears that flowed freely, seeing her mother acting this way, disowning her only daughter. She would never again see her mother, and for this to be the last memory of her, was more than 27 could handle.

Through the town, the cart made its slow journey. The journey was always done this way, so that others may see what would happen to them if they, too, disobeyed the rules and were transported and disowned.

Once beyond the town the cart picked up speed, and 27 watched as the settlement disappeared behind her, wondering what would now become of her. She had heard stories about the far side of the Island, and none of them made her feel any better about what was happening to her. 

Exiles had no rights and no legal protection. They were&nbsp; given food that was just sufficient to live on, but, that was all that was provided for them. Other than that their needs were not met. Survival was not a right, it was a challenge, a daily challenge.

Eventually the cart pulled up in front of some wooden huts, and 27 was dragged out, falling to the ground heavily as she was pulled, her arm hurting even more.

A huge man met the guards as they handed over the paperwork that would make the girl an exile.

Reading the papers, the man then turned to the girl and spoke.

�27. you are hereby exiled to this side of the Island. You are to make no attempt to go to the other side of the Island for any reason. Any attempt to do so, or to make contact with anyone outside the confines of this settlement will result in immediate and severe punishment. There are no court rooms here, punishment is sure and severe for any breach of the rules. You will be fed once a day at the communal kitchen in the last hut, the green one. If for any reason you are not there when the food is handed out, you will miss out, there will be no excuses for lateness, miss out, and that&#8217;s the lot for the day. You will then have to wait until the following day. Any attempts to cover your body with any form of clothing is an offence, as it has been deemed you are not worthy of public clothing, as you were found guilty of whorish behaviour, and were in fact naked when arrested. I am not going to ask if you have any questions, because it no longer matters if you do or do not. Your last right was your carriage to this side of the Island. From now on you have no rights at all. As far as the law is concerned, you don&#8217;t actually exist anymore. Sleeping quarters are over there� he said, pointing to a line of trees a little way off from the huts. � When you sleep is up to you. You have missed today&#8217;s food issue, so you will now have to wait until tomorrow. A single bell will be heard when food is about to be issued, you then have two minutes to get to the hut, fail, and you starve. Expect no mercy, and do as you are told, and you will avoid punishment.�

27 watched as the cart was set into motion again, and moved out of the settlement, leaving her to what ever her future held.

Exile

Freed from the chains that had held her, 27 moved slowly away from the huts and the guard, moving towards the tree line he had pointed out to her, finding a shaded area where she sat and cried. Her arm hurt, her heart hurt and her mind was in turmoil. Only a few short days ago she had been a respectable member of the community, and now, because she had gone for that boat ride, she was an outcast, disowned and branded. Even her lawyer had believed the evidence, unless he was aware of the truth but failed to say so. It was only then that she realised that she had never heard of an acquittal since the new owner took over the Island. Perhaps the lawyers were paid to not defend, simply to enter a plea of guilty for the accused.

Looking around at the other figures a short distance away, 27 suddenly realised that all of the exiles were females. There wasn&#8217;t a single male on this side of the Island. The second thing she noticed that, like herself, they were all naked. This enforced her views that perhaps no-one was supposed to be acquitted, and that the trials were merely for show, the decisions already having been made beforehand.

A shadow seemed to loom over her, and as 27 looked up a large blonde woman stood over her.

�You&#8217;re new aren&#8217;t you?�

�Yes�, replied 27.

�Missed out on the food, and hungry?�

�I wasn&#8217;t hungry, until I was told I would not be getting any food today, and then I was�

�I can help� said the blonde. � am 15� she pointed to the brand, now healed, on her arm. �I have stashed a little away for a rainy day, and, for a price, you can have some�

�What sort of price?� asked 27

�I have to make a delivery tomorrow to West Isle�. The blonde pointed to a small Island just off the coast. �If you make the delivery for me, you can have some food tonight.�

27 looked at the woman and hesitated, but her stomach was churning, as she realised that she had no eaten since her mother had cooked for her on the Thursday night.

�Okay. What am I delivering?�

�just a few things that came from the other side. It&#8217;s a weekly delivery. Takes about an hour to get there, and an hour to get back. If you agree to make the delivery for me, you can happily eat tonight.�

27 felt she had no choice. Until she had been told that she would not be fed today, she had not actually felt hungry, but it was the reminder that she had not eaten for a few days, and would not eat for another day that had made her stomach ache with hunger.

�Okay� she agreed

�Come with me� said the blonde walking slowly inside the line of trees, and out of the sun.

27 rose to her feet and followed the woman deeper into the tree line.. they seemed to be following a new path, the grass slightly trodden down, but not enough to make it obvious unless you were actually on the path. About five minutes later they came to a small clearing in the trees, where a sail cloth had been strung up to make&nbsp; a shaded area. Under the cloth were some small items of bedding. A pillow case stuffed with grass, another small sheet of sail cloth, and a large tin which soon revealed itself to contain fresh water.

�Where did you get all this?� asked 27. �I thought we were not allowed personal belongings�

�We aren&#8217;t� answered the blonde. �Much of this I got from West Isle, if the powers that be knew I had it, I would probably be whipped and all of it taken off me and burned. The guard never comes over this far, and certainly not into the trees, so its pretty well hidden. They don&#8217;t really search the areas, they simply let us exist, and feed us once a day.�

28 joined the blonde under the shade and sat down opposite her on the grass.

�Here� said the blonde. �eat this. It isn&#8217;t much, but it should fill the void a little�

She handed 27 a slice of bread covered in what could be mistaken for margarine, and a small piece of hard cheese. It was hardly palatable, but 27 didn&#8217;t care. She ate it without thought.

�I&#8217;m Emily� said 27 when she had finished eating.

�No you&#8217;re not.� Said the blonde. She looked at the new girl&#8217;s arm and said �You&#8217;re 27. anyone heard using the name they were previously known by gets whipped. The last girl got 40 strokes, because she refused to accept that she was now only a number, not a human being anymore. I am 15, and that&#8217;s all you&#8217;re allowed to call me. Just as I can only call you 27, your old name no longer exists�

�even here I have no name?� 27 felt the tears rising in her eyes.

�Don&#8217;t worry about it honey� said 15, �In a few days it wont matter if you are 27 or Mother Theresa. Names mean nothing here, nor does time. When the bell rings in the morning you get over to the green hut for food, miss it and you starve. The bell rings whenever the guard feels like it, not at any set time. As none of us are allowed watches, it makes little difference. We are not prisoners of time, we are prisoners for all time.�

As the night started to close in 15 said she would allow 27 to stay the night with her, but the following day after getting back from West Isle she had better find her own place, as 15 was sure that the new regime would soon exile more women, and good space would become premium.

Thanking her, 27 lay down under the shade and closed her eyes. Sleep, however, seemed elusive, her mind trying to figure out all that had happened to her in the past few days, the pain in her arm slowly diminishing, but she knew from seeing 15&#8217;s brand, that the numbers would be on her arm forever.

Quite when she fell asleep she didn&#8217;t know, but it was only when 15 shook her that she woke and realised she had actually slept.

�Two minutes� said 15. �The bell just rang�.

Together the two women made their way to he green hut, making it with less than half a minute to spare. Almost as soon as they entered, the door closed, leaving at least four other women outside.

�What about them?� asked 27.

�They have missed out� answered 15. �They know the rules, and so do the guards. By only allowing us two minutes to get here, they ensure that none of the women sleep too far away, so its easier to keep an eye on them�

Food was nothing to write home about. A bowl of porridge, some toasted cheese sandwiches and a mug of tea. For each girl. 27 found it strange that even though four girls had not made it into the hut in time, there was nothing left over.

�They don&#8217;t expect everyone to get here in time� said 15, as if reading the new girl&#8217;s mind. And if they do, we simply get smaller portions.�

�doesn&#8217;t anyone complain?� she asked.

�To whom? Remember, we are not classed as humans anymore on this wretched Island. No-one cares if we live or die, no one cares if we eat or starve, if we say anything they simply remind us that we are only fed because of the generosity of the new owner, should he choose to do so, he could withdraw the food at a whim. No honey, complaining doesn&#8217;t work, and last time someone did, we all starved for two days and the girl in question was whipped�

Silently, 27 ate the meagre food, savouring the hot, insipid tea, the first hot drink she had drank in days.

�And before you think of escaping, all the boats are on the other side of the Island. Anyone of us found over that side would be whipped to death, and to try to swim to safety would simply be suicide. This Island is over a hundred miles from anywhere. Apart from West Isle, and I would not suggest going there apart from the delivery.�

27 looked around the green hut at the other women. There were about twelve others, of all ages. One of them 27 thought she had known before, but the girl showed no sign of recognition. The numbers on heir arms were not, it appeared, sequential, they were simply numbers given to them by the Justice at the time of their exile. A brunette girl to 27&#8217;s left was numbered 99, and she guessed that only four had failed to make it in time for feeding.

�The boat will be here soon� said 15. �I will help you load it up, but you will have to unload it yourself at West Isle, the men over there won&#8217;t help. I will see if I can find you a space near my sleeping area for when you get back. I may have a spare pillow case, and will stuff it with grass for you if I do. I don&#8217;t have spare coverings, but that cant be helped. If it does rain, the trees will give a small amount of shelter, which will be better than what some of the girls have.�

Just then the doors of the hut opened, and the woman started filing out. The guard seemed to watch everyone with an eagle eye as they left.

�What is he looking for?� asked 27

�Food� replied 15. �Get caught taking food out and you get punished. They naturally assume you are feeding someone who didn&#8217;t make it on time, someone not allowed to eat, and then call it theft, punishable by the usual, a whipping.�.

�Are all things punished by a whipping?�.

�Pretty much. Takes little effort, and the memory lasts a long time. No-one ever breaks two rules� answered 15

As they made their way towards the beach a boat could be seen in the distance, heading for the Island.

�That&#8217;s the West Isle boat� said 15, quickening her step. �We don&#8217;t want to be late. They wont leave without you, but the guard will take it out on your arse if you are not there when it arrives.�

Speeding up, 27 followed 15 to a wooden jetty, arriving a few minutes before the West Isle boat did. There were several boxes stacked on the jetty. Ready for loading, and both women stood by them waiting. As the boat pulled up, one of the occupants threw a line and 15 grabbed it and tied it to a mooring, while another line was tossed to 27. following 15&#8217;s lead, she pulled the rope tight, dragging the boat tight to the jetty, before tying it off.

�Okay�, said the guard. �Get it loaded.�

Without a word 15 started to pick up the packages from the jetty and place them on the boat, telling 27 that they needed to be stacked neatly in case the sea swelled and any packages went over the side. To lose a package through not packing properly would be disaster.

Twenty minutes later the packages were all aboard, and a tarpaulin sheet was pulled over them and tied down, so sea water would not get into them.

�Are you coming 15?� asked on of the men on the boat.

�Not today� she replied. �27 is coming with you. Its her first day here, and I thought she would be able to share the job with Me�

�Okay. Get on board 27, and hold on to something, the winds a bit choppy in the middle. Don&#8217;t want you falling overboard on your first trip�.

As 27 boarded the boat, 15 began to release the mooring ropes, and as the man started the engine, he turned the rudder and slowly headed the boat away from the jetty.

A few hundred yards off the Island the man sped the boat up, and as the wind levels raised, 27 felt chills running through her body. There was no cover to hide under, and the fingers holding onto the ropes began to freeze, her hair flying everywhere in the wind.

�Is it always like this?� she asked the man.

�Yep, guess it is� he answered, his face not looking towards her, his words almost lost in the winds. �Will be there in less than an hour, you then get a cup of tea to warm you up, and then you unpack the boat. Do not try to wander away from the boat, you don&#8217;t want the cat on your first trip. Once the boat is unloaded we check to see if there is anything to go back, then I will take you back to the Island, and your job is done.�

�what is in the packages?� she asked.

�None of your business.� Came the curt reply. �You just do your job and your arse will stay pink.�

By the time the boat reached West Isle, 27 was freezing cold. The wind had blown relentlessly all the way across, and she found it difficult to move. The man seemed unaffected, but then he was wearing a heavy duty jacket, climbing boots and thick trousers, whereas 27 was naked.

As the boat reached the jetty the man told her to go to the hut at the end and she would get a hot drink. She was to be back at the boat as soon as she had drank it. 

Slowly. 27 made her way to the boat hut where a group of five men sat around a wooden table strewn with dirty plates and cups.

At the far side of the hut was a brazier, the small red and blue flames flickering and dancing in the breeze that came through a broken window.

�A new girl� said one of the men, walking over to the brazier and lifting a heavy pot off it, and picking up a cup, poured her a drink of coffee.

�Drink it, and get back to the boat� he said, handing her the cup. �You&#8217;re here to work, not on holiday�

With that he returned to the other men and continued their conversation, a conversation 27 could not hear as it seemed mumbled, almost whispered.

The hot coffee, and the heat from the brazier started to warm 27 up a little, grasping the cup in both hands to try to get warmth back into her fingers, ignoring the pins and needles she felt as heat returned once more.

She tried to take her time with the coffee, trying to stay in the warmth for as long as possible, but all too soon the cup was empty.

As if the men had been watching her, as soon as she drank the last dregs, one of them came over, took the cup from her and told her to get back to the boat.

When she arrived back at the boat the tarpaulin had already been removed, leaving the packages exposed.

�Get a move on� said the boatman. �We don&#8217;t have all day.�

27 noted the whip the man had hanging from&nbsp; the belt on his trousers, she immediately decided work would warm her up, and she set to removing the packages from the boat, stacking them ion a crate next to the jetty. None of the packages were heavy, but it still took her almost half an hour to get them off the boat and into the crate.

Once the boat was empty the boatman climbed back on board and motioned 27 to get on also. Reluctantly, she did as she was told, not looking forward to the return journey. There would be no hot drink waiting for her when she returned to the Island, and even the sun would take time to warm her up again.

Throughout the journey the man said nothing, as 27 cuddled up on the floor of the boat, trying to use the sides to keep the wind off her body, but the wind seemed to find her where ever she hid.

Back on the Island 15 was waiting for 27 when she disembarked.

�Come with me� said 15, urging 27 to follow her.

Together they moved past the green hut towards the trees. 27 thought that they were going back to their sleeping place, but 15 led the way past their spot, and deeper into the trees.

�Where are we going?� asked 27, her teeth still chattering from the cold, barely able to speak.

�Wait and see� answered 15.

Deeper into the trees 15 led her charge, until, after half an hour or so, they reached a small clearing with a lake in the centre of it.

�Jump in� said 15. �The water is warm. I think its fed from an underground waterfall, perhaps close to the old volcano. I always come here after making the delivery, gets the heat back into the body quickly.�

With that 15 dived into the clear water, and signalled 27 to follow her.

Reluctantly, 27 moved closer to the water, seeing 15 splashing about happily, she decided to do as suggested..

As soon as she entered the water she felt the heat. Not overbearing, but certainly warmer than normal lake water. Swimming over to 15 she trod water and thanked her for bringing her here.

�Its no problem� said 15. �s I said, you will be sharing the delivery job with me in future, and if we share work, and sleeping area, we share everything. Not that we actually have a lot to share� she gave a small laugh, the first sound of laughter 27 had heard since her exile.

After a while. Both women climbed out of the water, 27 feeling much warmer now than she had since getting back to the Island. They lay side by side on the bank of the lake, on their backs, letting the sun dry them gently.

�How old are you 27?� asked 15.

�19� replied 27.

�Why were you exiled?�

27 told her friend about meeting Gerry in the shop, and the boat ride. She couldn&#8217;t actually remember how she got to be having sex with him though, maybe it was the wine, but she had been caught. She explained that her defence lawyer had entered a plea of guilty on her behalf, and then her mother had dis owned her, so she had been branded and exiled.

�Usual story� said 15, disgust in her voice. �The wine would have been drugged, and the whole thing set up in advance. What do you know of the history of the Island?�.

�Just stories I guess � answered 27. �It was a pirates hideaway or something, but no-one could ever say when or how�

�History time then 27.� Said 15, rolling onto her stomach and leaning on her elbows.

�1743, a British naval vessel was sailing in these parts when there was a mutiny on board. The men had not had fresh supplies for over a month, and scurvy and other diseases were rife onboard. The captain had refused to pull in and restock at the last port of call, and the men were getting frustrated, and in the end, took over the ship. They saw this island and hoped to get fresh water and food, and headed inland, sinking the ship a distance off shore, coming in by longboats. When they got here, there were no fresh supplies, and now they had sank their only way of getting back to civilisation, though that would have meant they would all have been hanged anyway.

�over the first five months over half the crew died, though the rest had learned to survive on the plants that grew on the island. This lake is actually clear water, and can be drunk. There is another lake like it on the other side of the island, which is where the settlement is. In fact, the lake you went boating on. By felling trees they managed to built a settlement. One day, they were looking for food when a boat appeared on the horizon. Laying in wait they fought and beat the people in the boat when they landed here, only to learn that there was another island a little way off. It wasn&#8217;t large enough to support their number as well, but it did have women there. Using two of the long boats they rowed over one night, and attacked the settlement on the island, kidnapping some of the women, and bringing them back here, where they were used by all of the men.

For the next five years there was continuing battle between this island and the other one, though the sailors eventually won out, they had lost a lot of men. 

Eventually a settlement was agreed, and since then both islands have lived in peace. The other island being West Isle.�

�How do you know all of this?� asked 27.

�I was the daughter of the Island&#8217;s historian before I was exiled� answered 15, her voice bitter. �I read lots of the books and records dating back to those times.�

�What happened? Why are you here then?�

�like you, I was set up. It was quite clever, as all set ups are. The old owner was visiting My father one day, and discussing deliveries, and I was in the same room. I guess he thought I had heard too much, and wanted rid of Me. I was at work the next day when two policemen arrived with a warrant for my arrest. As one handcuffed me, the other opened my desk and pulled out a sheaf of papers. Apparently, they were plans to escape the Island, and details showing how they were producing drugs here, and exporting them to other countries. If that information got out, there would be a lot of trouble. So it was decided I was a spy, and a danger to the �normal� folk of the Island. My father immediately dis-owned me, even before I went on trial, and the defence lawyer was as much good as a ship with no sails. He pleaded guilty on my behalf, as yours did, and I was sentenced to thirty strokes of the birch, and exiled to this side of the Island. That was about five years ago, and I have been here since. To make things even worse, I was given the job of delivering the packages of drugs from here to West Isle. That&#8217;s what you delivered today. They get a delivery every week, and the drugs are then transported to other countries for distribution.�

�Cant we stop them?�

�Not a chance. If I didn&#8217;t make the delivery. They would simply get someone else to do it. They only use me because of the irony. I was tried for supposedly trying to leak the information out, and now I am part of the whole thing. But not for much longer.�

�How do you mean?�

�I have a plan to escape the Island, but first I needed someone who would take over the delivery for a few weeks until I get things sorted out, and get someone, somewhere, to put a stop to it.�

�You&#8217;re going to escape? How?�

�I would rather not say, if you don&#8217;t know you cant tell. Suffice it to say I have a helper, a man on the other side of the Island who is also against the drug trafficking. If I can get to his side of the Island unseen, he will smuggle me onto the next supply ship, and off the Island�

�And if you get caught?�

�Don&#8217;t worry 27, I wont get caught�

�You need someone else to do the deliveries so you can get away, and no-one will realise you have gone for a few days?�

�You got it 27. If I failed to turn up for food, they wouldn&#8217;t notice, they would just assume I missed the bell. But if I don&#8217;t turn up to make the delivery, they would immediately come looking for me. If you are making the delivery, I have two weeks before they actually miss me. By which time I will be anywhere but on this Island�.

Escape

For the next few days 15 and 27 went along with life on the exile side of the Island, arriving when the bell rang, swimming in the warm lake and generally wasting the days with little to do.

27 had asked for more details about 15&#8217;s escape, but they were not forthcoming, 15 reminding her that the less she knew, the less she could tell. 

There was only one new arrival that week into exile, a girl in her early twenties, the number 49 burned onto her arm, though she also bore the welts of a birching on her back. 27 and 15 tried to make her comfortable, but after only two days the shock to her body took its toll, and she failed to wake up for food on the third day.

As 27 and 15 came out of the food hut that day, they could see the West Isle boat pulling away from the jetty, presumably carrying the body of 49. the two women had not even been told her name, she was, like the others in this settlement, nothing.

�That&#8217;s how we will all end up one day � spat 15, anger in her voice. �Taken off to be buried somewhere, no name, no mourners, nothing. I have seen many in the past five years. And there will be many more yet�

15 walked briskly off, and 27 considered joining her, but thought better of it. She would come back when she was ready, and calmed a little. Instead 27 decided to walk along the beach for a while, considering what her life had become.

The 27 burned into her arm was still sore, and red, but it was now clearly the number 27, and only hurt when she rolled over on it during the night, or knocked it with something or other. It seemed strange that although she remembered screaming out, she could not remember the actual pain as her arm had been branded. Strange how the mind refuses to let us remember things.

It was early afternoon when 15 re-appeared from the trees, finding 27 dozing by their sleeping area.

�Sorry 27, I needed to be alone. I just get so upset when I see someone die. It brings it home to me just how little we mean to those on the other side of the Island. Her parents wont even be told she has died. When someone is disowned, they are truly disowned�

�Its okay 15, I went for a walk along the beach by myself as well. It&#8217;s a sad day, but that goes for all the days we are here�

The following day the West Isle boat returned, and 15 made her way to the jetty, 27 close behind. 

�I will help you load up� announced 27, making the time pass a little faster, and also taking the load off 15 for a while.

As the boat left the jetty 27 knew that soon, within the next few days, she would be left alone in exile. 15 would make her escape attempt, and would either succeed, or fail. She hoped it would be successful, but her own recent trial made her distrust the men on the other side of the Island. 15 would hear nothing against the man who was going to help her. she was sure he could be trusted. He had, apparently, already secreted her some clothes away, close to the other settlement, so she could walk through the town un-noticed. It would have been much harder to get across town to the docks naked, impossible even.

A little over four hours later and 15 returned from West Isle, and she and 27 made their way to the warm lake.

�That&#8217;s my last delivery� said 15 with a smile, after she had warmed up a little. �I will be off in the next few days, so I get two weeks before I am missed. No matter what ship I get smuggled onto, in two weeks it will be far from this Island�

�I am not sure� said 27. �Remember what happened last time any of us trusted men from the other side. We ended up here�.

�Its going to be fine. Its all worked out. And besides, it&#8217;s a guy I knew before I was sent here. So I can trust him.�

�If you&#8217;re sure� said 27, concern in her voice.

�I am. And just think, when I go, you get my sleeping area, and all that goes with it�

�Ah! You mean the sheet now that is one thing I am really looking forward to� laughed 27.

For another hour or two the women swam in the lake, then lay on the side letting the sun dry their bodies.

When 27 awoke the next day she was still surprised to see 15&#8217;s sleeping are empty. It would seem she&nbsp; had kept to her plans. And slipped off in the night while 27 slept. She hoped 15 would be okay, but her recent experiences with the men on the Island caused her grave doubt.

As she made her way to the food hut, alone for the first time, the guard met her at the door. 

�Where&#8217;s your shadow, number 15?�

�She caught a chill yesterday on the boot and doesn&#8217;t feel like eating. Can I take her something for later?� 27 was amazed at how easily the lie had come to her lips, but she had to protect 15 for as long as possible.

�You know the rules, no food leaves the hut. If she isn&#8217;t well enough to eat, she will make a remarkable recovery tomorrow or the day after when she&#8217;s hungry�

27 made her way into the hut and ate her breakfast. It seemed strange to eat alone. Ever since her exile 15 had been her friend, and good company. She was already missing her �shadow� as the guard had called 15.

For the next few days life went on as normal, and 27 began to get used to living without her friend. Even when the boat came the next week, it seemed natural for her to load it herself, and make the delivery.

Upon returning to the Island she was surprised to see three guards waiting on the jetty. One was clearly carrying a set of manacles. Even before she could get off the boat, the three guards climbed on board, and while two held her in vice like grips, the third began manacling her hands, and her feet, before dragging her ashore.

�27�, said one of the guards. �You are to be taken to the Justice charged with aiding and abetting am escape. You can expect severe punishment for this.�

�What are you on about?� screamed 27 as the two guars holding her manhandled her into the back of a jeep. �I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about�

�Tell it to the Justice� replied the guard, and then ignored her and started the jeep, heading it for the other side of the Island.

The Justice was waiting for 27 when she arrived back at the compound.

�Well, 27. looks as if you have blotted your copybook at this time. You are charged with aiding and abetting an escape attempt, in that you either knew before hand, or simply lied to a guard to cover up the escape of 15. I am not going to ask how you plead, I have the evidence of the guard who says you told him 15 was too ill to eat, and that you asked if you could take food back to her. However, by that time, 15 was already in custody, so could not have possibly been too ill to eat, and your attempts to take food back to her were simply to cover up her absence. Anything to say?�

The Justice waited a few&nbsp; seconds while 27 tried to think.

�I thought not 27. However, you are not going to be birched, and nor is 15. we have decided that as she, and I guess you as well, have a desire to leave this Island, where&nbsp; we have tried to treat you fairly, we will assist you in this. You will be taken on the next ship and sold as a slave, both of you. Perhaps after a few years in slavery, you will wish you had never got involved in this tomfoolery. Take her away� he said to the guards, who dragged 27 out of the court room and down to the cells she had last seen the day she was branded.

Transported

For the next week 27 and 15 languished in the compound. The Justice had decided that they were to be out in the courtyard during the day, to stop their skin paling before they were transported for sale. He thought that pale skinned slaves would not get as much as those with colour to them. He was probably right in this, but this was their first entry into the slave trading market. If these two brought a good price, there were another fifty girls on the far side of the Island who could be sold off. The owner had originally suggested the idea. It seemed he had contacts within the slave traders, though he was still keeping his cards close to his chest on the traders. All he had said so far was that a ship would come and collect the girls, and that would be the end of them. They would certainly not be coming back.

To occupy themselves 27 and 15 swept the yard, fed the guards horses and even cooked the food for the guards and themselves. They were both surprised that they were being allowed proper food, but this, again, was down to the owner. Well fed slaves brought a higher price than skinny ones. Their new owners would want some meat on them, and the exercise they were undertaking would keep their bodies toned.

The owner, it seemed, knew a lot more about the slave trade than he was telling anyone. In truth, he had, at one time, been a senior trader, which is how he got the money to buy the Island in the first place. He had originally intended to hold markets here, away from prying eyes. But the drug trade seemed the more profitable one, and he had shelved his other ideas for a while. But the attempted escape of 15 had reawakened his thoughts, and the hunger to get back into the trade he knew more about. The drug trade more or less ran itself, and he found the time on his hands boring. In the slave trade there was lots of planning to do, so he was rarely if ever bored.

In the middle of the second week the guards went to let the girls out, but unlike normal, they carried shackles and chains. Without speaking they shackled 27&#8217;s feet together, leaving only a short chain to allow her to walk. Another pair of shackles were placed on her wrists, and a chain linking her wrists to her ankles. Escape from these shackles would be impossible. Once shackled, 27 was led into the corridor, where 15 was already standing waiting, shackled in the same manner as 27.

The Justice stood before then and spoke.

�15. 27. This is the last time you will see the island. In a few minutes you will be taken to the harbour and loaded onto a ship that will take you to your new lives. I have no idea where you are going, but I am told it will take almost a month to get there, during which time you will undergo some slave training, so that you will be ready for whoever buys you at the sales. You have only yourselves to blame for this. Had you, 15, not attempted to escape, and you, 27, attempted to cover up her escape, you would have remained in exile until the end of your days. Now, that is no longer an option for either of you. There will be no appeal, there will be no escape, and there will be no return to this Island for either of you.�

With that the guards led the two prisoners into the yard and into the back of a blacked out van. They would not even see the town as they passed through it on the way to the harbour. No chance to say a last goodbye to anyone they knew, simply carted off without anyone knowing they were being deported, and sold.

15 had apologised many time to 27 for getting her into this, but 27 had told her not to worry about it. At least she was not undergoing this on her own, and 15 was lucky that they had not whipped her instead. Being transported and sold may not be ideal, but it was far better than being whipped to death as an example to others.

The guy 15 had trusted, had apparently set her up, which came as no surprise to 27. he had given her clothes, and led her through town, as he had promised, but as they reached the harbour guards had been waiting for them. Immediately they dragged her kicking and screaming to the compound, and had ripped her clothes off, reminding her constantly that the sentence for these crimes was being whipped to death.

It was only when they had brought 27 to the compound as well that 15 discovered that she was not to be whipped, and instead, was to be sold into slavery, with 27.

At the harbour the van moved up close to a waiting cargo ship. The back doors were opened and the two girls dragged out and herded without a word onto the ship. The captain was at the top of the gang plank waiting for them.

�Not bad� he said as he looked them up and down. �This one,� he said, pointing at 15, �may not get the best price, as she is a little older than most others, but the other one should get a good price. She is fit and healthy, and not too old. What are we doing if they don&#8217;t sell? Bring them back?�

�No�. said the Justice, who had appeared from behind the girls. �If they don&#8217;t sell, dispose of them. The boss doesn&#8217;t want them back, but he would rather they be sold, even if 15 doesn&#8217;t get a good price. Maybe they could be sold together, but that&#8217;s up to you.�

�They will be sold separately� replied the captain. �Its not good to sell slaves who are friends. They tend to spend too much time with each other, and spend much of that time plotting futile escapes. They will be sold separately.�

The captain looked at the brands on the two women. �I like that. It shows they are nothing but chattel.�

Turning to the two girls the captain spoke again � Once we have left shore you will be put to work. The first thing you need to know is that you have no rights aboard this ship, except one. The right to die if you don&#8217;t pull your weight. If you are given an order by myself, or any member of my crew, simply obey. Failure to do so will see you tied to the mast and whipped. You are only worth what you will fetch at market, and until that time you are worth nothing, if you don&#8217;t survive to reach market, then you are worth nothing. Your only chance of survival is to obey, do your work, and do it well. You will also undergo slave training while you are on this ship, so that you will fetch a better price at market. Trained slaves fetch more than untrained slaves. And have no doubts in your minds at all, you are slaves and nothing more.�

With that the captain turned on his heels and walked away, leaving two of his crew to move the two girls along the deck and down some wooden step. A heavy door opened and the two girls were thrust into what appeared to be the hold, and the door closed behind them, leaving them alone.

�He cant mean it?� asked 27. �That the only right we have is to die?�

�I think he does� replied 15. �I have bad feelings about this, but I doubt we can do anything to stop what is happening. If they are not going to let us out on deck until we are off shore, I doubt we will be in a position to escape, unless drowning is your idea of freedom.�

�I don&#8217;t really feel like drowning today� quipped 27.

A few minutes later there was a hum of engines, and even in the darkness of the hold, the two girls could tell that the ship was in motion. Where ever they were heading for now, it was out of their control. 

It was about an hour later when the heavy door opened, and a hidden voice told them to get up on deck.

Struggling in their shackles the two made their way slowly up the wooden steps and onto the deck, the light blinding after their time in darkness.

The captain stood in the centre of the deck waiting for them.

One of the crew came over and removed the chains that linked the girl&#8217;s wrists to their ankles.

�as you can see� started the captain, �We are already far from land. We shall be calling at a few more places on the way, to pick up more girls. In the meantime, I want this deck scrubbing, so its clean enough to eat my food off. I have appointed Mr Sharp as gang master for the voyage, and anything he says, you do. I could, of course, tell you that to be whipped would hurt you, but you would never know how much. So for that reason, you are both going to feel the whip before you start work. After feeling it once, you will be highly unlikely to want to feel it again.�

Signalling to Mr Sharp, a heavy man with greying hair, the captain said �Six strokes each if you will Mr Sharp�

�Yes captain� replied the man withdrawing a whip from his belt.

Two men grabbed 15 and moved her to the mast in the centre of the ship, lifting her arms above her head and securing her manacles to a hook.

The sound of the whip slicing through the air coincided with the first scream from 15, as the whip cut its way across her back, the red welt appearing instantly. Even before the scream died on 15&#8217;s lips the whip sliced through the air and another scream was wrenched from 15&#8217;s throat.

By the time the last stroke landed. 15&#8217;s back was covered in red welts, no two on top of each other. She had almost collapsed the hook holding her up, her legs not able to do so.

As the last stroke landed, the two men lifted 15&#8217;s manacles from the hook and dragged her to one side, ignoring her tears and her whimpering.

Without a word they advanced on 27, who, at first, tried to struggle. Having seen what had happened to 15, she would have done anything not to be whipped, but the two men were far stronger, and had freedom of movement, dragging her with ease to the mast, and, as they had done with 15, soon had her hands above her head, her manacles hooked up.

27 found herself praying even before the first stroke had landed. The angry searing pain felt as if her back was on fire, the scream dragged from her did nothing to lessen the pain she now felt across her back.

She was sure she could not survive the six strokes, but the gang master ignored her screams and her prayers. The second stroke was again like a line of fire across her back, the scream almost inhuman as she bounced off the mast. Whether or not she felt the last four strokes no-one knew, as 27 made no sound, her body simply bouncing off the mast with each stroke, her brain having thoughtfully sent her into unconsciousness. Even so, the gang master continued his task, regardless of whether or not 27 reacted. She would feel the pain when she regained consciousness.

27&#8217;s unconscious body was taken back to the hold, though 15, was left one deck.

�You will now scrub the deck, slave. If you want to refuse, we can always give you another six strokes. Will that be necessary?�

15, still sobbing, shook her head. No matter what else happened, she never again wanted to feel the whip on her back. 

When 27 opened her eyes again the first thing she felt was the sheet of fire that was her back. She was not sure which hurt more, being branded or being whipped, but she did know that she wanted neither again. The gang master had not held back when he whipped her putting his full weight behind the strokes, and she&nbsp; was sure that he had broken flesh at least once, or was it just her imagination?

The heavy door opened and one of the crew entered the hold.

�Come on slave. No time for laying around when there&#8217;s work to be done.�

With that the crewman ushered 27 back on deck and guided her to where 15 was busy scrubbing the deck on her hands and knees. �Get on and help her� said the crewman, pushing 27 to her knees.

With no other choice, 27 grabbed a scrubbing brush out of the bucket and joined her friend. The hot sun burned their backs as they worked, bent over. 15 had asked one of the guards for a drink, but he had simply laughed at her and told her to carry one working.

Exhausted the girls eventually collapsed at their task. Only then were they carried back to the hold, where they would stay for the night.

The next morning they were each brought a bowl of food, which, though didn&#8217;t look very appetising, would nourish them. The Captain was under instruction to get as munch as he could for them, and skinny slaves didn&#8217;t sell well. An hour after breakfast, the girls were back on deck, scrubbing the deck et again. They started at the stern, and slowly made their way towards the bow of the ship.

At one stage, 15 had needed a drink so badly, she drank from her own bucket. 27 turned her head away, but could feel her own thirst getting worse. Eventually, the desire to drink got worse, and, she too, drank from the bucket. The water tastes foul, and she felt herself start to gag, but it was better than thirsting.

For a week the routine continued unbroken, by which time drinking from their buckets was a normal occurrence. The guards simply smiled and allowed them to do so. the antibiotics in their morning food would cure anything they caught from the water.

At the tart of the second week the routine changed. Their morning food was delivered a s normal, and they waited for the inevitable guard to take them to work. But the guard didn&#8217;t arrive. 

It was 15 who was first to notice that the humming had stopped. The ship wasn&#8217;t moving. With no portholes to look out of, neither girl knew what was happening, but 15 suggested that they were picking up supplies, and perhaps new slaves. The Captain had said they would pick others upon the route.

15 proved to be right, as a few hours later the humming restarted, and minutes later the guards escorted someone down the steps, her chains rattling as she entered the hold. 

The darkness hid the girl&#8217;s features, but her cries told both 15 and 27 that she was a youngish girl. It was only next day, on deck, where they saw the girl tied to the post, the whip master ready, that they realised that the girl could not have been more than 16 years old.

In silence. The two were made to watch the new girl get her initiation whipping, hearing her scream out in agony as each stroke brought a new painful red welt to the girl&#8217;s back. Her screams and cries filled the air, but, as he had done with them, the man finished his whipping without pausing, ignoring her screams.

The three of them were put to work, and once again, started at the stern and slowly worked their way towards the bow.

The new girl was slow, and spent most of the day whimpering, and both 15 and 27 took turns in helping her. making sure that she didn&#8217;t lag behind.

Later, when they returned to the hold, and the girl had stopped crying, 15 moved over to hug her. it was strange how jealous 27 felt when she saw this. 15 had been her friend and companion since her exile, and it was because of 15 that she was now on this ship, and to see her hugging the new girl, made her jealous. But she knew that the girl needed a hug, and, holding back on her jealousy, she moved over to the girl&#8217;s other side, and placed her arm around her shoulders. 15 looked up and smiled.

The next morning the guards brought three bowls of food down, and issued one to each girl. An hour later, and they were back in the old routine. The new girl had still not spoken since her arrival, and was still slow scrubbing, but again, the other two helped her. the new girl bore no brands, and her dark hair seemed to have been cut with a kitchen knife, not s much cut, as hacked away. It was only later they found out she had previously had hair down to her waist, and her kidnappers had cut it off with a knife. 

They had also sexually abused her, robbing her of her virtue. Then she had been packed off onto this ship, where she now was. When asked her age by 27, the girl answered that she was just turned sixteen.

15 suggested that, as her and 27 had no names, simply numbers, that the new girl be called 16, because of her age. 27 agreed, and no matter what the new girl thought her name was, she was now, just 16.

Over the next three weeks the shipped docked four more times, and more girls were added to the number in the hold.&nbsp; With the hold filling up, each night meant new stories. Sore backs and tears, but the deck scrubbing got easier, and soon they discovered that having scrubbed the deck, the captain did not give them more work, but allowed them to use an area of the deck, mid-ships, to relax.

After a month, the girls were now numbering seven, waited one morning for their food. But the guards didn&#8217;t arrive. They waited, and waited, and 27 was sure they were much later than normal. And the humming had stopped.

Eventually the hold was opened, and several guards entered, carrying chains and shackles. In turn, each girl&#8217;s hands were shackled behind their backs, and a chain with a series of metal collars was fastened to the first girl in line. The next collar went around the next girl. Leaving a space of about six feet in the chain. Soon, all the girls were secured, and the guards told the girls to get on deck.

In the light of the day the slaves could see the island at which their ship was docked. It was very much a pirate island, ships docked along the coastline. The town before them sprawled out in all directions, houses you would expect to see in any pirate film. The streets cobbled and worn.

The girls were ushered towards the gang plank, and off the ship, moving in single file. Hands groped them as they moved, the guards laughing at the lewd comments being made, and making no attempts to stop the groping. Hell. Soon some of these groping hands would be counting out the money to pay for the girl they had bought.

The slaves were herded through town towards a large building at it&#8217;s centre. Here, they were ushered into a large room, and the chains removed. There were seven bowls of food on a table at the centre of the room, and as many glasses of water. At least, if this was to be where they are going to be sold, they would share a last meal together.

After the meal the guards removed the bowls. And left the slaves alone, locking the door as they left.

The girls split into small groups, and 27 pulled 15 to one side, and sat in a corner.

�This is the last time I shall see you� she started. �The guard said we are to be sold separately.�

�You never know� replied 15. �The same buyer could bid for both of us�

�I doubt that� answered 27.

�In case we don&#8217;t see each other again. You once told me your name, and I told you that you didn&#8217;t have one. Mine, before this began, was Carol.�

27 looked over at her friend. In all the time spent together, she had never before offered her name. Tears came to 27&#8217;s eyes.

�I am going to miss you. I don&#8217;t know what I would have done without the help you gave me when I first went into exile�

�Stop crying� 15 responded. �Or you will have me crying as well�

The two girls huddled together for the last time, weeping on each other&#8217;s shoulders.

A few hours later and the door opened. Two guards entered carrying a set of manacles, and walked over to one of the girls who had joined the ship in the last week. Chaining her hands behind her, and fastening a nine inch hobble to her ankles, she was led out. 

The auction had begun











Chapter One

It was half an hour before the guards returned, without the girl, and chose a second, again, her hands were chained behind her, and the hobble put in place, before they took her out.

27 and 15 watched and waited. They had been told they would be sold separately, but they secretly hoped that this would change, and they would be sold together.

Their hopes were dashed later that day, as the guards came into the room and walked up to 15. without a word, 15 stood up and felt the cold steel chain lock her wrists together behind her, more cold steel on her ankles, and she was slowly walked out of the room. As she was ushered through the door she turned her head and said a final goodbye to 27, who was sat crying against the wall.

Alone, 27 knew that she had seen her friend for the last time. 15 had been more than a friend, she had been everything since 27 was sent into exile. And now, that friendship was ended. She wondered what would become of her, but could only see 15&#8217;s tearful face in front of her when she closed her eyes.

By the time the light started to fade, there were still a number of girls left, including 27. they were informed that the auction would continue tomorrow, and that they were to stay where they were for the night. 

Not only were the two friends sold separately, they were now being sold on separate days. There really was no chance of getting a last look at her friend.

During a fitful sleep, 27 relived her life from the moment she had been sentenced. It was a life she had never dreamed of before it happened to her, and wondered how anyone could inflict this on another human being. 

What was it 15 had said once? 

�You&#8217;re no longer human, you are simply a number.�

And that&#8217;s what 27 was now. purely a number. Apart from herself and 15, none of the other girls were branded, which, she assumed, meant that they still had names. But none of them offered to talk to each other, simply finding a place to sleep, and, perhaps, pondering their own fates.

As the sun slowly rose the next morning, the guards brought through some food for each of the girls, telling them that the auction would resume later in the morning.

Leaving the girls alone again, the guards left the room. 27 ate the food, not realising she was hungry until the first mouthful. She didn&#8217;t even seem to notice that there was a slightly bitter taste, and that she had been drugged.

Still sitting with her back to the wall, 27 began to feel a little tired, and couldn&#8217;t understand why. Even as her eyes closed, she didn&#8217;t realise that she had been given a strong sedative, and that the auction stage would never see her.

A little later two guards entered the room and walked over to where 27 was slumped against the wall. Together they picked the girl up and carried her from the room, taking her away from the action stage, towards a carriage waiting on a corner.

�Here she is� one of the guards said, as they placed 27 into the back of the carriage. 

The man in the carriage handed over a sum of money, and thanked them, before moving the carriage forwards. Courser had seen 27 as she was being taken into the holding room, and had bribed the guards not to sell her. it had cost a lot of money, but he had seen something in her that would please the Boss, and hoped he had not made a mistake.

The carriage was driven towards a plane, hidden under some trees. This was nothing strange, many bidders didn&#8217;t want the others to know how they arrived at the auction, and hid their transport.

Courser stopped at the plane, and lifted the sleeping girl from the carriage and placed her into the plane, strapping her into her seat. Adding a ball gag, he was satisfied, and closed the plane&#8217;s door, telling the waiting pilot that they could leave now.

She would be asleep for some time yet, and when she awoke, she would be high in the sky. Courser once again wondered if he had done the right thing, but it was now too late to do anything about it. He certainly couldn&#8217;t return the girl and say he had made a mistake.

They had been flying for a couple of hours when he heard 27 begin to awaken.

�You&#8217;re awake then�

A man&#8217;s voice filled 27&#8217;s ears.

�Just so you know what has happened. I&nbsp; bought you at the auction, We are on our way to an Island that appears on no maps. We should be there in an hour, now, so you might as well relax and enjoy the ride. You won&#8217;t enjoy things when we land�

Courser fingered the brand on 27&#8217;s arm.

�What&#8217;s that for?�

He unfastened the gag to allow her to speak.

�its my name� replied 27. 

�In which case. We shall call you 27 as well. When we land you will be taken into initiation, and then you will be trained. As I said, you wont enjoy life, but, make the most of it.�

With that the man replaced the gag and fell silent, leaving 27 to mull over his words.

The hum of the engine changed, and although 27 had never flown before, she understood that they were losing altitude and coming into land. The man who had spoken to her moved closer, a hypodermic needle in his hands.

�This wont hurt, but, its necessary. You will be asleep again in minutes. See you when you wake up�

With that the man plunged the needle into 27, and injected her with the drug that would keep her out for over twelve hours. Long enough for her initiation to take place.

When the plane landed it taxied into a hangar, hidden under a shelter of trees. The girl was taken off the plane by two men, and placed on her back on a trolley., which was then wheeled into a large compound. At one end of the compound stood a large awe inspiring building of three floors. To one side was a stable block. And to the other side a series of one room buildings.

Close to the only entrance to the compound was a smaller white building, to which 27 was taken. The interior of this building looked like a hospital, which, in fact, it was, and where 27 would be treated.

Wheeled into a sterile room, 27 was placed on an examination table, and a&nbsp; white coated doctor looked her over.

�Remove the chains� he said, no emotion in his voice.

�Yes doctor� one of the two men replied, and immediately began to remove the manacles and cuffs that 27 still wore. 

�And the gag�

�Yes doctor�

The doctor looked again at the girl laying on the table. He could appreciate that she was a fine looking woman, though his own tastes were more masculine.&nbsp; Maurice Walters MD, or Maurice Walters �former� MD, his licence to practice being revoked for sedating a patient, and playing with his anatomy. Although there were no formal charges in court, the rumour spread quickly that Walters had been found by a nurse, jacking off a patient. And, as rumours do, it spread like wildfire, leaving the hospital no choice but to fire him, and urge the medical board to revoke his licence.

It was shortly after that, when he was approached about the post he now held, and was promised a supply of his own patients, none over seventeen, and all his to do with as he wished, as once someone arrived on the Island, the chances are they would never leave it. Only Courser and the pilot ever left the Island, and only then when there were guests arriving, or, as in 27&#8217;s case, a new arrival.

The doctor looked closer at the girl. She had a thin face, her dark hair, currently spread around the table where the delivery man had put her, was almost to her waist, this would soon be shortened. She had firm breasts, the doctor guessed around thirty six, and a slender waist. Her rounded hips lead to long lithe legs, and splendid ankles. These needed to be strong, for what was going to happen to the girl. Weak ankles were easily broken, and the girl became useless. Still, they still came in handy, to feed the sharks that swam around the Island occasionally.

Everything on this Island served a purpose, even in death.

The doctor opened 27&#8217;s legs wide, strapping her ankles to the sides of the table. And began his work. By the time he had finished, 27 would never be the same again.

For over eight hours the doctor beavered away at his task, a small cassette player playing in the background, as he sang to his favourite tunes.

He was just putting the finishing touches to 27 when the door opened, and an imposing man wearing a white suit entered.

The man, in his fifties, was tall and muscular. His hair cut short and neat had lightened under the hot sun. 

�How is she doing doc?!

�Just about finishing up now Boss. Complete hysterectomy, pubes removed by laser, so they wont grow again. Her vocal chords have been severed and cauterised, so they can never be repaired. So yep, just about finished.�

�Thanks doc. Recovery time?�

�Well, every one is different Boss, but she&#8217;s a strong girl, she should recover in three or four days, enough for light duties. A week and I think the shock will set in properly, and anytime after that, you can beat the crap out of as much as you want.�

The Boss laughed loudly.

�You have such a wonderful turn of phrase doc��

The doctor&nbsp; looked over at the man and laughed back.

�Okay Boss, she&#8217;s all yours. She wont waken up for another twelve hours, and then she will need pain killers for a few days, and antibiotics for a week. Same as normal really. How was the last one?�

The doctor never saw any of the girls after he had finished with them, unless they were training as he walked past the training area.

�She starts training tomorrow� the Boss replied. �And by the way, talk to Courser, I think he has something new for you, if you approve. He has to make a delivery tomorrow, and can have it back tomorrow night.�

�Cheers Boss� the doctor grinned. �I will catch up with him later. Just want to get this girl into recovery for you, then she&#8217;s all yours�
.
�One more thing� the Boss asked. �How long to get rid of the hair?�

�A few hours. Why?�

�Do it. I want to try something new.�

�Okay Boss, she will be asleep for ages yet. Just make sure Courser doesn&#8217;t lose my present�

Again the Boss laughed. �Okay doc�

Once more the doctor went back to work, using the laser to remove the hair from 27&#8217;s head. As an after thought, he decided that perhaps her eye brows should go as well. He had never seen a totally bald woman, and it would be nice to see it, even if it were just the once.

By the time he had finished, the doctor was tired. It was a painstaking. Job to work the laser for so long at close range, but at last he was happy with his work.

Picking up the phone on his desk, the doctor called for an orderly, who was there in under two minutes. 

�Okay orderly, take her to the spray shop. Check with the Boss, he said he wanted to try something new.�

�Okay doc. Night�

The orderly pushed the table out of the surgery and headed to another area of the compound. Here he handed the still sleeping girl over to another man, who read his notes before speaking.

�Something new, the Boss asks for. I wonder sometimes if he knows the problems he gives me. Okay orderly, put her over there� he waved his hand towards a large metal tank against one wall.

To the casual eye, it looked as if the wall and the tank were painted black, but a closer look revealed the truth.

27 was laid in the base of the tank, as the man found some tape, using it to cover her pussy and arse, and then placing a tube in her mouth, the last thing was to place pads over each eye, and then he was ready to start work.

With a slight hum, the compressor sprang to life, and the man aimed the nozzle of his hose at 27. A fine black mist came from the end of the nozzle, turning 27&#8217;s skin black where it touched. It took over an hour to cover the girl. Between her fingers, under her arm pits, between her toes. Not a square inch was left uncovered. When the latex dried, she would be encased in it until someone cut her out of it. Quickly, before it could completely dry under the heat of the workshop, the man removed the pads from her eyes, and the tube from her mouth. Then, carefully, he cut away the tape that had covered her pussy and arse. 

Watching as the latex dried, he marvelled at the Boss&#8217;s idea. Normally the girls were covered from the neck down, and wore a latex hood, but this way the hood was a part of the girl herself. He had made a point of spraying her more times than normal, to ensure a thick coating. Less chance of it tearing. 27 was now nothing more than a latex doll, from head to toe.

Once the latex had dried, he phoned the Boss, who would send men over to move her to the facility, where her training would start in a few days time. another job well done.

Chapter Two

When 27 eventually started to waken, she felt a little groggy. Her mouth was dry, and her head ached, the results of the sedation she had been under for so long, and the pressure of the latex on her head. She tried to sit up, but her body refused to do so.

Her wrists were fastened to the sides of the bed by leather cuffs, and metal clips, allowing them to move only an inch or so in any direction. Her ankles, too, bore the same leather cuffs and clips, ensuring her feet would not move either. Around her forehead was a halo strap, clipped to the bed immediately behind her head, so she could not lift her head up.

She opened her mouth to scream, but was met with a strange silence. Again she screamed, and again, thee was nothing. At first she couldn&#8217;t understand what was happening, and then she slowly started to remember what the man on the plane had said, about not enjoying anything after she landed.

Landed? Landed where? And what was happening to her?

Her skin felt strangely tight, as if it was drying out, but she could not lift her head to see what was happening.

There was a click, and a slight hum, and then a man&#8217;s voice.

�You are awake at last� the voice stated. � I am sure you have lots of questions to ask, but, you will never ask them. Since your arrival, certain procedures have been carried out on you, modifications if you will. First and foremost, you have been given a hysterectomy. No more worries about monthly periods getting in the way of your social life, or at least, the social life you will be allowed. Secondly, every hair on your body has been removed using lasers, so it will never grow back. Thirdly, and for you, I guess, the most important, your vocal chords have been cut, and removed, we have ensured that they could never be repaired, even if you got off this Island, which you never will unless I allow it. Last, for now anyway, your whole body, except access to your private regions, your mouth and your eyes, is now covered entirely in latex. There are no zips, no buttons, it covers the entire expanse of your body. You will see this when we eventually allow you to move.�

The voice halted for a few seconds, while 27&#8217;s mouth opened and closed, the screaming silent.

�I can see from my screen that you were screaming just then! The voice continued. �But as I said, no vocal chords, no sound. All you are going to do is give yourself a sore throat. Now then. Why are you here? You are here because I bought you at auction And now you will be trained in a specialist field, as soon as your body recovers sufficiently, which should be in a couple of days. I must warn you. There is no escape from the island. You may leave it at any time you wish, but I must inform you that there are sharks in the waters, and the latex you wear has an undetectable aroma that attracts sharks. Besides. Unless you can swim more than a hundred miles, you are not going to find land anyway. I know you want to know more, but, not at this time. we will talk again later. Oh one more thing before I go, you are about to be visited by someone who will not know who you are, but I am sure you will get to know as time goes by. He has been a guest here several times, and always asks for a new girl if we have one.&nbsp; Enjoy yourself, if you can.�

With that there was a second click, and the room fell silent.

Seconds later there was a swishing noise, and just out of her sight a door opened, and 27 could hear footsteps on the tiled floor.

�This is her?�

The man looked smilingly at the latex clad body bound to the table, her wrists at her sides, her ankles stretched wide, leaving her totally accessible to him. He had spent the previous night with another girl, but was informed that a new girl was arriving, and that there would be a difference, in that she would be&nbsp; covered in latex from head to toe. No-one knew her identity, and no one ever would, as, like the other girls here on the island, her vocal chords had been removed.

The man stood closer to the girl. Watching the heave of her chest as she breathed, the rise and fall of those breasts less than an eight of an inch away through the latex. The nipples, standing erect, thanks to an injection&nbsp; 27 had been given which heightens a girl&#8217;s sex drive. The man placed his hands between 27&#8217;s legs. feeling the dampness of her pussy, his fingers tracing the line of her pussy from bottom, to her clit.

�Very nice� he commented, as one finger slowly started to penetrate 27&#8217;s pussy.

She tried to shake her head, to scream for the man to stop, but all in vain. Her head refused to move, and her screams went unheard.

A second finger joined the first inside her, and the injection 27 had been given helped her hips move up to meet them. She tried to resist, but was unable to do so, his fingers driving him deeper inside her.

She heard a zipper undoing, and frantically tried to shale her head, and scream for the man not to do this, but it was a mute and useless gesture. The man would never hear her, and would never know who she was.

27 felt pressure between her legs as the man climbed on the table, between them. She tried in vain to close her legs, but even her knees had been fastened open, leaving her totally accessible. The man&#8217;s weight crushed her to the table as he lay on top of her, one hand between her legs, guiding his, now hard, cock towards its goal. 27 closed her eyes and wept, as the man&#8217;s cock slowly started to invade her body.&nbsp; An inch at first, then a second, and again, her hips seemed to grow a life of their own, and slowly at first, rose to meet him. 

She struggled to hold them down, but the potion she had been injected with was stronger than she was, and so was the man. Suddenly, and without warning, he rammed his cock deep inside her, filling her pussy with it, before starting to fuck her. 

27&#8217;s movements matched his own, rising to meet his every thrust, his cock deep inside her, much deeper than Robin had ever managed. Relentlessly&nbsp; the man fucked her, until a few minutes later, he stopped. 27 felt his cock throb inside her, and knew what was about to happen.

Again she screamed her silent scream, begging the man not to cum inside her, but even had he heard, it was too late, as his cock throbbed one more time, and exploded, sending blasts of hot spunk deep inside her pussy.

Tears welled an ran from 27&#8217;s eyes, as the man pulled off her body, and moved away

As the man stood up, she heard him tell whoever was in the room with him, that this girl was a great fuck, and, if she wasn&#8217;t over used, he would like to try her again on his next visit.

As the man&#8217;s footsteps moved away from her, 27 could feel his juices running from her, trickling between her legs towards her arse. Again and again she struggled to be free, to scream, but all in vain.

As the door closed behind the man, she once again heard a click, and the voice.

 �This is your new life, and your only life. As I said earlier, feel free to leave the island, but, no-one has ever reached freedom. Unless, of course, you call being eaten by sharks freedom. You will undergo other training from next week, training I am sure you are more suited for, but, if someone pays high enough, they can fuck you. It&#8217;s your life now slut, and nothing you can do can change that�

Again there was a click, followed by silence.

Suddenly the lights in the room went out, leaving 27 in total darkness. There were no windows in the room to allow any light in, and she lay there in the blackness, tears still streaming from her eyes.

Surely this couldn&#8217;t be happening to her. why had Robin lied to her, and said he couldn&#8217;t find a buyer, and then gone behind her back. Poor Robin, if the man wasn&#8217;t lying, then Robin was dead, and she was being held responsible. Even if she could escape from the island, she could never go home. She would be arrested, and she had no alibi that anyone would believe. No jury would believe the truth, and she would spend her life in prison. But, isn&#8217;t that what was happening to her now? the man had said this was her new life.

She was also annoyed with her body. She had never known it to react the way it had when that man was raping her.. It was as if her body actually invited the rape, forced the man deeper into her. and even now she could feel his juices drying between her legs.

27 didn&#8217;t remember falling asleep, but the sudden explosion of light woke her up. Almost immediately the door opened and two men entered the room.&nbsp; At the same time that click, and the man&#8217;s voice again.

�Good morning. These two men are going to take you to your quarters now. if you struggle, they will hit you, and you do not want that. You will be shown what you look like now on the way. I hope you appreciate the new you. We shall talk later. �

Another click and the voice disappeared again.

The two men approached the bed and began by releasing one ankle. even before she could attempt to kick out, one of the men grabbed her foot, as the second fastened a chain around her ankle. using a padlock through the chain to hold it in place.&nbsp; She waited her time, waiting for her knee to be released so she could get a better chance of kicking the man, but instead, he released her other ankle from the bed, pulling it towards the first, and wrapped the other end of the chain around it. A second padlock clicked, and her ankles were held five inches apart. Only then did the men release her knees, by which time 27 could not kick.

Her head was released from the bed next, the man pushing his hand under the back of her head to release the clip that held the halo strap in place.. only now was she able to lift her head, and look down at her body, encased in shiny latex.

She was so shocked, that the men had released her wrists and elbows before she realised it, and one of the men pulled her arms behind her, clipping the two leather cuffs together behind her as she sat up. Only then was she pulled off the bed and allowed to stand.

Moments later 27 was ushered out of the room, and down a corridor her feet moving the short distance that the hobble would allow. At one end of the corridor was a mirror, where the men stopped and allowed 27 to see herself properly for the first time.

27 could not believe what she saw. From head to toe, her whole body was covered in latex, the lights from above showing its sheen. Only her eyes and mouth were visible, the rest of her body appeared to be encased in the skin tight material.

The men forced her through a door to her left, and out into the central compound, moving towards one of the stables 27 could see. Even before she reached them, she knew where she was being taken, and tried to pull back, but the men were far too strong for her, and her resistance was futile. One of the men lifted the helpless girl up and placed her over his shoulder, carrying her the final few yards.

The stable was relatively clean, fresh straw had been laid out, and a water trough had been filled with fresh water. It wasn&#8217;t this that surprised 27. It was the chain hanging from the far wall of the stable. As the man carried her into the stable. The second man grabbed the chain and brought the metal collar that dangled from the end of it, and placed it around 27&#8217;s neck. There was a click, and the collar locked in place. Only then did they release 27&#8217;s hobble and her hands.

Immediately her hands flew to the collar, trying to prise it loose, but the collar had locked, and needed a key to open it, a key neither man held. Only the stable keeper had that. One of the men told her she was free to wander around the stable, but informed her that the chain was not long enough for her to pass through the doorway. With that both men laughed. And left 27 alone. 27 sank to her knees and cried.

About an hour later a tall imposing man entered the stable. He wore leather black trousers, black riding boots, and a black shirt. In his hands he carried a collar and lead, which he placed around 27&#8217;s neck, before releasing her from the stable&#8217;s own collar.

Bringing 27 to her feet he led her out into the yard, and led her towards a tack room at the end of the stables.

�Try to run, and you will get hurt� the man&#8217;s voice was low, but 27 felt the menace it held. �You will start training tomorrow, but first I need to fit you out with a harness, and some boots.�

Inside the tack room the man picked up a selection of leather straps, and began to sort through them for what he needed.

Laying a strap with a buckle on each end over each of 27&#8217;s shoulders he wrapped a third strap around her torso, just under her breasts. This one he fastened so that it fit tightly. But did not impair her breathing, and then buckled the two shoulder straps to this one at the back, before pulling them tight and buckling them at the front. It was if 27 was wearing a cup less bra. What size shoes do you take?�

27 tried to speak, but no words came out, so she held up her fingers to show him she was trying to say six.

The man went to a cupboard and brought a pair of leather boots back, they had wide heels, but only three inches high. The boot would cover most of 27&#8217;s calf.

�These are work boots. Once you get used to wearing them we shall move to higher boots. I assume you have worn heels before?�

27 stood in the centre of the room simply nodding her head. This couldn&#8217;t be happening to her. surely it was just a dream, and she would wake up soon&nbsp; But she knew that was never going to happen.

The man pointed to a chair behind 27 and told her to sit down. When she did so he took the first boot and helped her get her foot in it, before lacing up the boot tight around her calf. At the top of the boot was a buckle which the man fastened, and then threaded a small padlock through the buckle, holding it in place until he, or someone else with the key, unlocked it. Minutes later and 27&#8217;s other foot received the same treatment. The boots felt tight, but they would support her in the heels, especially when these boots were eventually changed for higher heels still.

Telling 27 to stand, the man picked up another belt, six inches wide, and placed this around 27&#8217;s waist, pulling it tight and buckling it behind her back. 27 could feel its tightness, bringing her waist in by at least an inch or two.

�Bend� the man spoke again.

27 tried to do as she was asked, but the thick leather belt would not allow her to bend very far.

�Good� the man said again. �That seems to fit nicely. Now your collar.�

Removing the collar he had placed around her neck in the stable, the man replaced it with a posture collar, five inches deep, with three buckles at the back of the neck. The collar lifted 27&#8217;s chin up, making it difficult to look down, or even turn her head.

Satisfied that the collar was tight enough but not restricting her throat, the man stood back and looked at 27.

�One more thing� he said, going to a work bench in the corner. He brought back what appeared to 27 to be a horses bridle harness, but smaller. She stood stock still as the man placed the harness over her head, and began to tighten the straps. The bit gag sat between her silent lips, pulling back into her mouth. Even seeing sideways was prohibited by the blinkers built into the harness.

Again the man stood back and looked at 27.

�You will get used to wearing these� he said. � I will be making a set specifically for you, based on what you have on now. it will be your job to keep them highly polished. If they are not kept polished, then you will be punished. Do you understand?�

Tears filled 27&#8217;s eyes as she nodded her head as best she could.

�Your outfit was spray painted on, and will not come off. Whenever it needs polishing, someone will come and polish it for you, just as you will learn to polish other girls as and when the time calls for it. You are not the only girl here, and each trains for an hour a day, in the paddock. You will start training tomorrow, learning to walk in harness, until you can wear the proper boots, which are much higher than the ones you are wearing now. Your stable is your home. It&#8217;s up to you to keep it clean and tidy. The straw is to be kept neat, and any waste straw must be placed in a corner ready for removing. There is a bucket in the corner for you to use when nature calls. Do not expect the staff to empty it for you. You will do it yourself every morning when we unlock the stables. Food will be brought to you regularly, and you will be pleased to hear it isn&#8217;t hay. Right, we are going for a little walk in the yard. When I tug both reins you stop. When I tug the left, you veer left, and vice versa with the right.&nbsp; When you walk, your ankle must come to knee height, as if you were cantering, any lower and you will be punished. There is no leniency here, you are here to learn, and learn you will. Okay out into the yard, now�

On her first step 27 realised how difficult it was going to be walking with the harness and bridle on. She was unable to look down at where her feet were, not even sure she was lifting them high enough to please the stable manager. Her first tentative steps took her out of the doorway, and into the yard. The man lightly tugged at the right rein, indicating that she was to veer right, which, after a moment&#8217;s hesitation, 27 did. Within a few yards her ankles began to ache, her back ached and she wished she could see what was either side of her, but the blinkers made sure that she couldn&#8217;t.

The man tugged the left rein, and 27 slowly began to turn slightly left. The bit was pulling hard into her mouth, crushing the corners of her mouth. The man told her to move a little faster, but as she did so, 27 lost her co-ordination, and tumbled to the hard ground, putting her hands out in front of her to save much of the pain. 

The man forced her back to her feet, having to help her as the waist belt made it hard for her to get up alone.

For over an hour the man forced 27 to walk around the yard. Her ankles were on fire, her neck ached and her back was aching from holding the posture. Finally the man turned her back into his room, and pulled both reins sharply, indicating that 27 should stop.

�Not too bad for a first attempt� the man said, as he began to remove the harness from 27. When only the boots remained, the man put the collar and lead back around her neck and led her out of the room, heading back to her stable. �Remember to pick your feet up. � the ma said. �In or out of harness, until it becomes second nature to you. Even in your stable. The more you do it, the easier it becomes. We shall bring you food in an hour, which is the time you have to make your stable neat. Now, get in.�

27 meekly walked back into the stable that was now her home, and the man again exchanged collars, putting the same one on that she had worn earlier. 27 sighed as she heard the collar lock, knowing that she was now stuck in the stable until the man came to release her for more arduous training.

As the man closed the door 27 fell to her knees, her feet no longer able to hold her. she tried in vain to remove the locks holding the boots in place, but they were there to stay.

If only she could get some respite. 

Chapter Three

For the next three days 27 was taken from her stable and �exercised� . her ankles hurt more than ever before, being permanently encased in the boots. On the third day the man sat 27 in a chair, and began to remove the boots, and 27 breathed a sigh of relief. But it was short lived. The man pulled another pair of boots from a cupboard, and brought them to where 27 sat, waiting.

�These are five inch heels. It may take you a few days to get used to them, but the faster you do, the better it will be for you. Today we are going to do two hours of exercise. One hour in the morning, one in the afternoon. I have been ordered to upgrade your training, and when I get ordered, so do you. This morning you will do normal exercise, but this afternoon&#8217;s session will get harder.�

Once the man had got 27&#8217;s new boots locked on, he replaced the wide belt around her waist, and began to lead her out of the room.

27 had never worn heels this high before, and was having real problems keeping her balance, but the man ignored her, and with the use of a crop on her butt, soon had her walking around the yard. If only 27 could see what was around, it would be easier, but that was not to be. The blinkers were ever present when she was in harness, only allowing her to see what was directly in front of her.

The hour felt like a lifetime, and when 27 was returned to her own stable, she again collapsed, if only to take the weight off her feet, and the growing pressure off her ankles. The boots were helping to support her, but without respite, she could feel tendons stretching, conforming to their new positions. 

Even laying in the straw, her feet stayed locked in the same position, the boots allowing no respite. Her ankles were on fire, but the strain was also on her thighs, having to stretch them to stay upright on the heels. Unlike normal heels. The addition of the calf boot meant her feet stayed in the one position all the time. stretched down from the ankle.

The man had said it would take a few days to get used to them, 27 though the man was a few weeks out on that one. She could never see herself getting used to her feet staying in this position. It was as if she were walking on her toes all the time.

She tried to stand in her stable, but had to use the wall to lean against to enable her to get to her feet. Her legs ached more than she had ever known, and she knew that the afternoon session would be worse than the one she had already endured.&nbsp; Surely, no-one&#8217;s feet were meant to be at this angle. To stand upright she had to lean backwards a little, putting pressure on her upper thighs.&nbsp; And to walk? Even without raising her legs the way she had been told, walking was never going to be easy.

The man had hinted that these were not the final boots, and that she would end up with even higher heels. She knew that anything higher, would be extreme, to say the least.

When the man came back again he had brought her harness with him, and a pair of leather cuffs, which, when he had the harness on her, he placed around each wrist. These were then clipped to the side of the wide belt, meaning 27 could not use her hands to save her if she fell. Nor would she be able to use them to help her get up again if that was the case.

This time, she would have to keep her balance.

Even the first few steps out of the stable were painful. Her legs wobbled, and she almost fell, but by leaning slightly backwards, adding pressure to the backs of her thighs, she managed to avoid falling. The man walked her slowly around the yard, using the crop on her buttocks whenever she failed to lift her leg high enough.

Silent screams echoed around 27 head as the session continued. The sun was making her feel hot in the latex cocoon that covered her body, and she felt both weak and dizzy. More than once she almost fell, her feet were in agony, and her back ached. If the man knew how she felt, he didn&#8217;t show it, as he continued to walk her around the yard. 

As they crossed by the yard gate 27 could see into the paddock, and what she saw shocked her. there was a second girl, at least 27 thought it was a girl. Like herself the girl was covered from head to toe in shiny latex, though this girl had a harness on with a large red plume, coming from the centre of the top of the girl&#8217;s head. Also like 27, she wore a harness, and high heeled boots. Higher than 27&#8217;s. but it was what the girl was strapped into that shocked 27 most. Just like the American pony and trap racing she had seen on television, 27 knew that the trap the girl was strapped into was meant for someone to sit in, and be carried. Though the girl&#8217;s trap was empty at the moment, she guessed it would soon be occupied.

�That&#8217;s what you are training to be� the man said, as if reading her thoughts. �We train pony girls here. No longer thought of as human, simply here to train, and win. When the time comes, you will also have your own trap, which, of course, you must keep clean at all times. That&#8217;s&nbsp; Kelly. She has been here two years, and has won us many contests. Eventually, you will win us many as well.�

With that he led 27 back to her stable and removed the harness, leaving her alone to ponder her fate. Even as she lay curled up in the straw, 27 could still see the girl in the paddock. Tears again filled her eyes. This was no dream, this was a night mare.

How could anyone do to another human being what they had already done to her, and still do even more? To be used this way, locked ina a stable with only a bucket for a toilet, and straw to sleep on. 27 would never have believed people could be this cruel, until she became a victim herself. And even if she could break free, where would she go? The island was too far for her to swim to safety, and the sharks she had been told about? And even if she did succeed, how could she tell anyone? She had even forgotten how her own voice sounded, and she would never hear it again. A former member of the school choir, and regular at the local karaoke bar, all this was lost to her.

27 didn&#8217;t remember falling a sleep, and was not sure what woke her up. The stable door was still closed, and the overhead light was on, but these were the same whenever she was in her stable. Then she realised what had woken her. the pit patter of rain on the outside of the stable door. Since arriving on the island, she had not seen rain. If only she could feel the rain on her face. But even if she were able to open the stable door, she would not feel the rain, not through the covering of latex.

She could hear footsteps in the yard, and waited patiently for the man to come and take her out of the stable again. The footsteps came closer, and stopped outside her stable. The door opened and the Stable Manager came in, carrying a large box.

�Your harness is here. As it&#8217;s raining, you will not be out this morning, so it will give you a chance to start polishing your harness. I want to be able to see my face in the leather by the time you have finished. There is polish, cloths and a tub of water. The idea is you dip the cloth in the water, dip it in the polish, and then rub it onto the leather, in circles. Its called spit and polish, and after a few weeks, the leatyher should be like a mirror.�

With that he placed the box on the floor and left. Leaving only the top half of the stable door open. Although 27 could get close to the door, her chain stopped her actually reaching it. But, at least she could see out, and see the rain falling, cleaning the yard. What she would give to be out, and feel the rain on her flesh.

27 slowly opened the box and began to pull out the pieces that would eventually become her harness. The leather was black, but with a small gold thread running along the edges. It wasn&#8217;t enough to stand out, but it would catch the sun. the leather was already quite polished, but 27 could not see her face in it yet. She had heard stories of army soldiers spit polishing their boots, and she knew this was expected of her. so far 27 had not needed to be punished, though she had been urged on by the crop when she didn&#8217;t raise her legs high enough in the yard. And she didn&#8217;t want to start being punished now.

There was also a large piece of cloth in the box, which 27 guessed would be for putting the harness on so the straw would not get it dirty again after polishing. Opening the polish, and taking one of the smaller pieces of cloth, 27 opened the sealed jug of water, and began her task.

The rain continued to fall outside as 27 worked. At first she was worried, as the leather seemed to dull over as she applied the polish and water. But when she used a clean cloth to brush the leather up, she was relieved that the leather still shone. For over three hours she endeavoured at her task, and although the strap she was working on did have more shine, she knew it was a long way off satisfying the Stable Manager.

Only when 27&#8217;s meal arrived did she stop polishing. The Manager glanced at the strap she had been working on as he put her food down for her, smiling inwardly at how well she appeared to be doing. The rain was going to last all day, so it would help occupy 27&#8217;s time to polish the harness.

The rain lasted more than all day, and through the night. 27 had to be exercised in her stable, though she still had difficulties standing on the heels. The latex hid her expressions, but if her eyes were anything to go by, 27 was just starting to get used to the constant angle her feet were now kept at.

The Stable Manager still sometimes wondered at what the human body was capable of accepting. One girl who had been kept in her boots for over two years had finally had them removed, and even without the boots, her feet had stayed in the same position, the tendons locked in place.

He had no remorse. This was his job, as it was his job to push the girls as hard as they could handle it, to get them ready for the track.&nbsp; As he exercised 27 in her stable, he could tell she was keeping her balance a little better, but still faltered occasionally. But now she was able to adjust her weight to stop her falling. Another few days and she would be ready for her higher, and permanent boots.

 For three days it rained, which was not so good for 27, being cooped up in her stable, but it was good for the islands water supply. The island did have its own water processor, and a natural clear water stream, but the rain always helped. 

But for 27 it meant not being out of her stable, and boredom. Although she was still working on her harness, it was not with enthusiasm. Her feet felt much better by this time, and she was able to stand and walk without too much trouble. Her straw had been changed twice, as it had began to smell because of the damp, and 27 found herself praying for the sun to return, even though she knew that this would mean a return to her stricter exercise routine in the yard. 

She found herself wondering about the girl she had seen in the paddock. Apart from her, she had seen no-one but the Manager since arriving in the stable block. He had hinted there were several girls, but the lack of speech meant that even if she knew where they were, she would be unable to attract their attention. 

On the fourth day the sun returned. Weakly at first, but growing stronger and warmer. By lunch time the yard had dried, and the manager had opened her stable door completely. After breakfast he appeared with her training harness, and began to put it on her, before leading her out into the yard.

27 couldn&#8217;t understand it, but she felt excited about being out of her stable, even though she knew the manager would work her hard to make up or lost time.

For over half an hour 27 was walked around the yard, her feet now able to accept the height of the heels. Her back ached less, and her upper thighs felt a lot better. Lifting her legs high enough was not a big problem, and she only felt the crop twice in that half hour.

�I want you to move faster. You may feel a little unsteady at first, but, its no difference to walking. Your hands will stay in place on the belt, so, if you fall, you cant save yourself. Now, walk�

With that he urged 27 to walk faster. At first she didn&#8217;t think she could do it, conscious of the fact she couldn&#8217;t see what she was doing. Ten minutes later, and she was moving more fluently. 

A man in the main building, overlooking the yard, smiled. She was beginning to look good now. another few days and it would be time to move onto the next stage of her training. The races were only two months away, and he hoped she would be ready by then. She didn&#8217;t yet have the total grace that he wanted, but that would come in time.

He would have to get the workmen started on her own trap.

Chapter Four

Over the next three weeks 27 spent two hours a day in the yard, and the rest of her time in her stable polishing her harness. It now sparkled, and she was almost able to use it as a mirror. Her hands ached, but her wrists had grown stronger from all the exercise they had been given.

On the first day of the following week the stable manager came and collected her as usual, but this time she was led through the yard and into the paddock. Wondering what was happening, 27 meekly went were she was told to go, and entered a large field. Just inside the entrance to the field stood a carriage similar to the one she had seen the girl fastened to all that time ago.

The manager led 27 over to the trap and told her to stand between the two wooden poles that came from the front of it. Once there, with her hands still cuffed to her waist. The man lifted the front of the trap and took a metal clip from his pocket. He fastened this to a ring on the end of one of the poles, and then clipped it to the same ring her wrist was cuffed to. Minutes later and he did the same to the other pole, effectively making 27 and the trap one unit.

�Walk� the manager told 27. Slowly, 27 began to move forwards. The trap was heavy, and the grass under her feet was harder to walk on. She felt the crop on her buttocks, a sign her legs wee not going high enough.

�Twice around the field� the manager told her. �Then back here. Don&#8217;t try running off, this is the only entrance and exit to the paddock, and I shall be here watching you�.

27 moved off again, this time ensuring that her legs came up as she had been instructed. The trap became easier to walk in once she had got into the rhythm, and she was soon walking around the edge of the field. 

As she finished her second circuit the manager called her over and climbed into the trap. �Walk� he told 27.

27 had to use extra effort to move the trap with the managers weight inside it, and only by using her hands on the poles was she able to do so. the instinct to lean forward to help to pull the trap was stopped by the tight wide belt around her waist putting the pressure on her legs and arms, as she slowly moved forward.

Half way around the paddock and 27 was having serious problems pulling the trap with the man inside it, and wanted to stop. But a new painful sensation as the man&#8217;s whip lashed at her back, forced her on. Even through the latex covering her body, the whip had hurt more than anything she had ever felt before. Her legs and arms were on fire as the man finally pulled back on the reins to tell her to stop.

Climbing out of the trap he came to where 27 could see him again.

�That was a light tap. If you ever stop again when in trap, you will feel the full weight of it. Do you understand?�

27 could feel the tears welling up as she slowly nodded her head. The tears, she realised later, when back in her stable, were not from the pain of the whip. That had already gone by the time she had reached the end of the field. It was because she had been told off. She had tried so hard to please him, and to have him tell her off, hurt her. she could not understand this feeling inside her, as she still resented everything about her new life. But she also knew she would try harder to please. 

Leaving the paddock the manager had not released 27 from the trap until they were at the far side of the yard. Here, he placed a water pipe in her hands and told her to wash and dry the trap. It would be cleaned every time it had been used, and it would be her job to ensure it was clean for whoever was next to use it.

Whoever next was a reminder to 27 that somewhere close by were other girls that she had not yet seen. It was easy to forget, spending time either in the stable or on exercise seeing only the stable manager, that there were other girls in the same predicament as her, perhaps only a stable wall away from her.

After lunch 27 was once again taken to the paddock and strapped into the trap. She waited until the manager climbed on board and told her to move. Still hurting from the morning sessions, her legs found pulling the trap hard work. Again, she had to use her hands to help pull the heavy trap around the field. As she reached close to the top of the field, she felt a light tug on her right bridle, indicating he wanted her to turn to the right. Even without thinking, 27 began to turn, continuing to do so until the pressure on the bridle evened up, indicating she was to go in a straight line.

The manager said nothing, but he smiled. She would perhaps make a good pony, when her training was complete. For now he would continue to train her on the grass, even though it was heavy going. The track could wait until she was used to the weight of the trap and an occupant. 

By the time the session was over, and 27 was back again in her stable. Her legs ached, and she had to sit. She looked at the box holding her harness, but could not bring herself to take it out and continue polishing it. This would be the first night that she had not worked on it.

27 slept well that night. Her whole body was aching, and she needed to rest. She had hardly had her last meal of the day before she lay down in the straw and closed her eyes.

27 awoke with a start. She had not heard the stable door open, and the manager was standing over her, harness in hand.

�You slept through breakfast� he growled. �Stand up. We have work to do.�

Clumsily 27 got to her feet and stood erect as he began to put the harness on. Satisfied that everything was in order, 27 was led out of the stable and towards the paddock. The grass was wet, and 27&#8217;s heels sank into the ground a little, making walking hard. Even so, the manager placed her in the trap and climbed on board, telling her to move forwards.

If yesterday had been hard, today was even worse for her. the wet ground made it harder to get purchase under her feet, and she slipped twice within the first fifty yards, crashing to the floor, and needing help to get up again.

The manager pulled her to a halt and removed her from the trap, and together they pulled it back into the yard. 27 thought he would put her back in the stable, so was surprised when he put her back into the trap in the yard, and climbed back into it. 

Using the reins he directed 27 in the opposite direction of the field, towards a set of&nbsp; large wooden gate. The gates were over seven feet tall, and a good eight feet wide. He pulled on the reins as they approached, and climbed out of the trap as she stopped.

Unlocking the gates the manager pushed them open, and 27 had to blink before she could believe her eyes.

Inside the gates was a larger field than the paddock, with a grand stand built on one side of it, and wooden trestle seating all along one side of the field. The other side of the field were stables, much like her own, each with a wooden post outside the door with tethering rings on each post.

The centre of the field was a huge gravel track, oval shaped, and reminded 27 of the running track she had used when at school. In the centre of the track stood three small wooden huts with no roves. There were marked one, two and three. They were not really huts, they were wooden enclosures, opened at one side, and coming to just above the knees. It took 27 a few minutes to work out that they were finishing positions, and that this was a racing track for others in her position.

The manager headed 27 onto the track and stopped her at a white line painted&nbsp; across the track. Looking at his watch he started 27 moving, urging her to go faster than she had been doing. The gravel under her feet crunched under her boots, but the going was a lot easier than on the field. As she neared the first bend she felt the manager tug slightly on the right rein, easing her around the bend, before urging her to go faster down the back stretch of the track.

27 lifted and dropped her feet as fast as she could, but in the heels, it was hardly running. Heading for the bottom turn, the manager told her to keep going, not to slow down, guiding her around and heading for the white line again. Only when they crossed the white line did he allow 27 to slow down, and finally stop, 27 breathing heavily after the manager allowed her to stop.

She was led over to one of the stables opposite the grandstand and her reins tethered to one of the posts, as the manager walked off to an office at the end of the stable block.

Picking up the phone he spoke to someone for a few minutes, and then hung up and went back to 27, having rested, and led her again back onto the track.

�I want you to trot to the first bend, and then go as fast as you can as you come off the bend onto the straight. Is this understood?�

27 nodded her head. She would do anything to avoid feeling that whip on her back again.

Taking a look at his watch the manager told 27 to move.

With her ankle going high over her other knee, trotting as best she could, 27 reached the first bend and followed its contours, until she could see the straight of the track in front of her. even before the manager reminded her, 27 began to run faster, remembering to keep her legs high. As she approached the bottom bend she was tempted to slow down, but the manager gave no indication that she should do so, and kept up the pace, having to take the bend a little wider to prevent an accident. As she came off the bend the manager shouted to her to go as fast as she could for the line.

Her chest was heaving, her breath short as 27 finally crossed the line, the manager looking at his watch before allowing her to slow down, and finally come to a stop, back at the stable block, where he once again tethered her to a post before making his way to the office.

�What do you think� he asked into the phone.

He listened to the reply from the other end, before saying � There&#8217;s a novice race next week. But it&#8217;s your choice.�

Again he listened to the conversation at the other end of the line, and then hung up, returning to 27, whom he led off the course and back into the more familiar yard, where the trap was unhitched. Again she was given the hose pipe and told to clean the trap, before being allowed to return to her stable. Worn out, tired and hurting.

The afternoon was spent polishing her harness, as the manager had told her to do as he put her back in her stable. Half way through the afternoon he appeared again, but not, as 27 expected, carrying a harness, but, instead a box from which he pulled out a pair of boots.

Telling her to sit down on the straw, the manager began to remove the boots she had worn continuously for over four weeks. As the boot slid off her foot, 27 tried to straighten her ankle, back to a normal position. There was a loud scream, and 27 suddenly realised it was from inside her head. Her foot hurt like a fire, as she tried to straighten it. It wanted to stay where it was, the ankle bent down, the toes pointing away from her.

The man smiled as he began to place the other boot on her feet, this one bend her ankle down even more, as the man began to lace it up. 

�These are your new boots. You have three days to get used to them, and then we will see how fast you can do the circuit.�

Locking the first boot in place, the manager moved to the other foot, but this time, 27 made no attempt to straighten it, simply allowing the boot to be replaced by the new one. 

�These boots will lift your foot so you are literally on the tips pf your toes. The heel and sole are solid, and wide enough to give you support. The inside of each boot is coated with a solution that will, in a few hours, bind itself to your latex body suit, making them a permanent fixture. You may as well get used to them, they are now a part of you�

With that the manager stood up and left the stable. Taking 27&#8217;s old boots with him.

Chapter Five

For two days 27 was once again exercised in the yard, while she got used to the new heels. They were only three inches higher than the old ones,, but it made a huge difference. Perhaps, because 27 was now used to walking permanently in heels, it was easier for her to adjust to the new height. For whatever it was, by the end of the second day, apart from a slight ache in her ankles. 27 was able to walk around freely in them.

She had felt nothing through her latex skin as the solvent inside the boots had adhered itself to her suit, but when the manager had checked, late on the first night, and taken the locks off, the boots had refused to budge when he tried to unlace and remove them. He was satisfied that 27 and the boots were now one.

On the third morning 27 was once again reunited with the trap, placed between its two poles in the yard, and led to the track again.

There the manager told her roughly as he had last time. trot to the first bend, and then gallop as she came off the bend, and then, as they came off the fnal bend, she was to go as fast as her legs would move.

27 nodded that she understood, as the manager climbed into the trap behind her. he brought her to the white start line, and checked his watch, before setting 27 in motion.

Whilst the boots still hurt her, 27 found that the width of the boots actually helped her to keep her footing, as she trotted to the first corner. The tug on the reins told her to start her turn, and the gentle, though significant, brush of the whip told her to speed up. 

Her legs pumped, and her breath shortened as she began to move faster down the straight, heading for the final bend. Here, she felt the whip again, as she began to move as fast as her legs would carry her, even the whip landing again on her back could spur her on no faster.

Exhausted 27 passed the start line again, her legs ached, her breath was short, and she felt very hot inside her latex skin. The manager trotted her to one of the side stables and tethered her to one of the poles, while he went off to make his report.

�She has a good chance. She is fast, strong and reacts well to the track. If you want her in the Novice race, then I cant argue. Its whether or not you want her to win that matters. I feel she has a good chance. Gregory will be bringing his novice, and from all accounts, she is pretty fast. I would like to see ours go against someone else. To judge how she reacts. But, again. It&#8217;s your choice�

The manager listened to the conversation on the other end of the phone, nodding his head, and agreeing occasionally.

Putting the phone down he walked back to where 27 was still tethered, and taking the reins, urged her back into the yard, where the trap was removed.

27 expected to return to her stable., and was surprised when she was taken to a different stable further down the line.

As the manager opened the stable 27 saw that it was a larger stable, and was already occupied.

27 looked as she saw another girl, also covered from head to toe in latex, chained by her collar the way 27 had been chained in her own stable. The only difference was that this girl&#8217;s latex was pure white, as opposed to 27&#8217;s black.

Leading 27 into the stable. The manager closed the door and left. There was a light click that neither girl heard, as the camera began to record them together.

The �white� girl moved away towards the back wall of the stable as 27 entered, looking at her as if to ask why. As with 27, only the girl&#8217;s eyes and mouth were visible, and the small section between her legs to allow her to use the bucket. 

27 had no way of guessing the girl&#8217;s age, but she was about the same height as 27, quite slim, and the white high boots made her legs look long and slender.

27 could feel the girl&#8217;s eyes on her, but each time 27 tried to make eye contact, the other girl looked down or away.

It was only now that 27 really missed the power of speech. How could she introduce herself? How could she tell this girl what she felt? Did the girl really care?

For over an hour the two girls sat at opposite sides of the stable, each wondering why the other was there. It was only when the stable manager returned that it became clear.

There was a noise outside the stable and then the door opened. Just outside the door was a trap, similar to the one 27 had been pulling earlier, but with some functional differences. 

It was wider than the one 27 had been used to, and instead of two poles coming from the front, it had three. 27 was first to be taken out of the stable and put into harness between two of the three poles, on the left of the trap. Satisfied that 27 was secure, the manager returned to the stable and came back with the other girl, placing her between the other poles, to 27&#8217;s right, and securing her in place.

If one girl now moved, the other girl had to follow, or the trap would go nowhere. Someone had decided to see how they would work as a pair, instead of solo.

Because of the high rigid collars and the blinkers, neither girl was able to see what the other was doing, and had to rely on the manager using the reins to guide them. As he urged them to move, telling each to start with her left leg, the strange trap moved forwards. It was difficult, at first, getting the two girls to move as one, and the manager walked them around the yard three or four times until he was happy that they were close to unison. Only then did he head for the large wooden gates that hid the track.

Inside the gates he walked the two girls towards the white start line, and halted them.

�Okay� he started as he stood before them.. �This is going to be less easy than running around the track on your own. You have to work as a team, which is not easy considering neither of you can actually see the other. So this is how it works. On My first command of �ready� you both pick up your left leg. On my second command of �go� you move forwards together, only one of you, the inside one, will feel the tug to start your turns, the other will feel the pressure as the first on begins to turn. At this point the one on the outside will have to widen her step until you are back on the straight. We will give it a go and see what happens.�

Climbing back into the trap the man took up the reins and looked at the two girls in front of him. 

�ready.�

Both girls picked up their left leg and waited.

�Go�

Together the girls began to move forwards, the pace ,set by the girl in white, was not too fast, and together they managed to get around the top bend without too much trouble. On the back straight they were urged to go a little faster, and as they approached the bottom bend the girl in white refused to slow down, taking 27 by surprise, and losing her footing.

27 crashed to the ground, dragging the other girl with her, and almost tipping the trap on it&#8217;s side.

The manager pulled himself together and stood in front of the two girls as they slowly climbed back to their feet. Pulling 27 out of the trap, he tethered her to a post, while he moved the other girl to where 27 had been. 27 was then placed in the inside position, and the manager once again climbed into the trap.

Ordering them to move. 27 began to take the lead, feeling the other girl go with her. by listening to their feet s they hit the track, 27 could tell if the other girl was keeping the pace up, as she moved into the first bend. As 27 started to turn slowly, the other girl&#8217;s footsteps increased in speed, slowing again to match her own as they came off the bend and into the straight. They were half way down the straight when the manager told them to increase the pace, and 27 felt the other girl speed up as she did herself. 

As the bottom bend neared, 27 expected the manager to slow them down, after what had happened last time, but no order came, and both girls hit the bend at the same speed. 27 once again heard the other girl&#8217;s footsteps quicken, as she navigated the bend, managing this time to stay on her feet. As they came off the bend the manager ordered them to go as fast as they could for the line. A crack of the whip convinced 27 to do as they were told, and both girls increased their speed, breathlessly crossing the line, before they were slowed down and brought to a stop.

Their reins were tethered to a post as the manager, once again, went off to make his report. 27 could still not see the other girl by her side, but could hear her breathing as hard as she was. But there was a pride, in that they had managed the trip without falling, and the manager had not scalded them. 

The manager was gone for quite a while, by which time both girls were breathing normally again. Untethering the girls the manager climbed back into the trap and walked them back to the white line again.

27 waited for the command, knowing even before they started off, that this time they would be expected to go faster.

At the command both girls picked up their left foot, and waited. The command to go came quickly, and they began to trot forwards. 

As they moved up the straight 27 felt a tap on the shoulder from the whip, a sign to go faster. Picking up the speed a little, she was pleased to hear the other girl&#8217;s footsteps quicken to match her own. Taking the bend wider, 27 hear the manager tell her to go full gallop from the time they came off the back of the bend.

Once again, 27 moved faster, as fast as either girl could in the heels they now wore. It was harder to breath, as the corsets allowed only slight movement on the diaphragm, and by the time they reached the bottom bend both girls wanted it to be over as quick as possible.

As if they had discussed it beforehand, as they came off the bottom bend they gained more impetus, and sprinted for the white line, crossing it completely out of breath, collapsing to the floor as soon as the trap came to a halt.

The manager left the girls to catch their breath, not even tethering them, as he went to make another report.

�I think the black is the inside one, the other one can run, but she isn&#8217;t steady on the bends. The black one is a lot steadier, and can also run well. It&#8217;s up to you, in the end, but we can still put her in the novice race in a few days, or we can let that one go, and wait for your own gala week after next, by which time they will be working perfectly together, and stand a good chance.�

He listened to what was being said on the other end of the line, nodding his head in agreement.

�Okay. I will rest them today. Now, and we shall restart training tomorrow. Are you getting a new trap made?�

Again he listened, and hung up when the other person stopped talking.

Walking back to the two girls, who were just starting to get their breath back, he helped them to their feet and, still attached to the trap. Walked them back into the yard, allowing them to walk slowly. Together they washed down the trap, and were then returned to the larger stable. 27 noticed that her own harness had been moved into the new stable. Apparently, she would live here now.

Chapter Six

For the next few days the girls were exercised three times each day, an hour in the morning, a second in the afternoon, and a third hour in the evening. They began to run as one after the first four days, as if each was reading the other one&#8217;s mind. 27 had, as the manager suggested, become the inside girl, and the other one was able to take the turns faster from the outside than 27 could.

They both knew that something was in the air, due to the extra session, and extra food they were being given. But neither had heard anything about why they were getting this.

On the sixth day 27 though she spotted someone sitting high up in the grandstand as they entered the track area, but from the track she could not turn her head to see, and dismissed it from her mind. 

The man sat and watched, top watch in his hand. He had given the manager strict instructions, and now waited to see how well his girls did. 

The manager climbed into the trap and told 27 that they were going to do two laps of the track. The first lap would be at trotting speed, but as they crossed the line to start the second, they would go a little faster, and then from the back bend they would gallop the rest of the way. 27 nodded her head as best she could with the collar on, and the manager gave the ready command.

Following orders 27 and the other girl set off trotting around the track. It felt strange as the came off the bend not to speed up, but the manager held the reins tightly, just in case instinct made them go faster. Breathing was a lot easier at this pace, but 27 knew that from the bottom bend, she would have troubles. The corset she wore was not as tight as it had been days before, but still she found breathing at speed difficult. 

As they came off the bottom bend the girls were able to see the line several yards in front of them. As they neared it, they felt the manager loosen the reins ready to let them move faster.

As they crossed the line 27 felt the tap from the whip on her shoulder, and began to pick up the pace, feeling the other girl do the same. The top bend came all too fast for her, and she began to prepare herself for the last straight, which would be run at a gallop.

Coming off the bend she felt the other girl&#8217;s hand brush her own on the pole, and together, they increased the pace. Faster than they had ever gone before, the two girls dragged the trap and the manager down the straight, nearing the bend. The other girl again brushed 27&#8217;s hand, as they started the turn, taking it wider to allow for the increased pace. Coming off the bend they could see the line, and the end. The manager tapped 27 one more time, and both girls found an extra yard of pace, taking them breathlessly over the line, where the manager slowed the trap down and brought the girls to a halt. 

Chests heaving, both girls fought for breath, as the manager climbed down and headed for the stands, leaving the two girls on the track.

The man sat back in his seat, a smile on his face as the stable manager approached.

�Well Boss?� the manager asked. �What do you think?�

The man brushed an imaginary speck of dust from his arm as he spoke.

�I agree with you, they work well as a team. The one in black holds the bends well, and the other one has the speed to stay with her. that last lap was quite fast, I think Gregory is going to have to fight hard to win this time. its eight days to the gala, and the twins are in the afternoon. What chance is there of either of them doing solo in the morning?�

�The girl in white can handle that easily, as long as she has a couple of hours between. The one in black, I am not sure about. I think she could do it, but I would have to test her out first. both are now doing three sessions a day, so the stamina is there, its just a case of her breathing. I have loosened her corset a little, but I think I need to loosen it more. If I can get that right, then I would say she can handle it.�

�Okay� the Boss started. �I will put them in the twins in the afternoon, and in the solo races in the morning. It doesn&#8217;t matter too much if they don&#8217;t win, we have the red for that. Gregory is as jealous as hell over the red. He tried to buy her from me, but I refused to sell. I am sure he thinks he has someone now who can beat her, but she hasn&#8217;t lost in four challenges�

�Right. I will get them back into stables� the manager remarked. � I wont take them out again today, but I will test them both tomorrow. Could be that they won&#8217;t need as long to recover if I do a twin in the morning and solos in the afternoon.�

�Okay Ben� the Boss replied. �It&#8217;s all in your hands�

The Boss stood up and made his way out of the stands, heading back to his office, where he would make the arrangements to register both girls before the Gala.

Ben walked back to the girls and stroked each of them on the head. He was pleased with them. Returning to the yard the girls once again cleaned the trap before returning to their stable. As the door closed 27 looked at the other girl, and thought she saw a smile on her lips, her eyes sparkling. Obviously, she was as happy as 27 was to have pleased the manager.

That night both girls were given instructions to work on their harnesses, and each were told that they would have two sessions the next day, but were not told the details.

That night, the two girls slept closer, almost touching each other, whereas they normally occupied different areas of the stable.

27 lay, with her mind full of straights and bends, could she get round the bottom bend any faster? Maybe if she took smaller steps going into the bend she could hug the bend better? 

Not sure when she fell asleep, she awoke with a start. Once again she had missed the door of the stable opening, and the Manager was already in the stable. She quickly jumped to her feet, joining the other girl who was already standing.

27 looked through the stable door, to see that it was still dark. She had not overslept, they had been awakened early.

The other girl was just having the finishing touches put to her harness, and then the manager turned to 27, and began to place her training harness on as well.

�Change of plan� Ben said. �We know you can handle the track in the daylight, but, what about when you cant see it at all? I could blindfold each of you, but, I would rather do this test in the dark. You wont see the bends, the lines, nothing at all except the control of the reigns and the crop. You either get it right, or you get it wrong, and wrong gets you punished. So, my little pony girls. Lets see what you can do�

The track was in total darkness as the girls arrived. Ben was wearing night vision glasses, and could see reasonably well, but the girls could see nothing more than a few feet in front of them. They certainly would not see the bends until they were already at them, and therefore would have to obey the commands of the reins. Although 27 was lead girl, the other girl would have to follow where ever 27 moved, and, without prior warning. 

To date both girls were aware a bend was coming up and had made themselves ready for it, but now, at night, it would be different. Only the man in the trap knew where they were.

They started off slowly up the first straight, as they usually did, both girls listening to each others footsteps on the gravel under their feet. It only took a few seconds for them to gain their rhythm, both sets of feet hitting the gravel together. After a few minutes 27 felt a light tug on the right rein, and began to take a slow turn. She hoped she was getting it right, and could still hear the gravel beneath their feet, though the other girl&#8217;s footsteps were now a little faster than her own.

The pressure came off her bit as they moved into the straight, and once more the other girl&#8217;s footsteps matched her own. Then came the tap on the shoulder which meant to go faster. Tapping the other girl&#8217;s hand, 27 began to move faster, not galloping, but certainly trotting faster. This time, she would take the bend that much&nbsp; faster, and hope that they stayed on track. As the tug came on her bit, 27 began to turn, and leant slightly to the right, hoping to take the turn a little tighter. There was a slight tug on her left rein, and 27 adjusted, until she felt the pressure on her right rein again, before suddenly. The pressure disappeared, and another tap on the shoulder told her to speed up again, to gallop speed. Again she tapped the other girl&#8217;s hand with her own, and the pace quickened, trotting as fast as they could, hoping that they had pleased the stable manager with their efforts.

Ben looked at his watch as they crossed the line and the girls slowed to a halt.
 Considering how dark it was, they had done very well, and the girl in black had done well to hold the turn. He had been right to make her the lead girl. The girl in white was a runner, but 27 was steadier, and kept the pace that he had demanded from them.

Without a word he walked them back to the yard, and unhitched them from the trap, taking them back to their stables, where he removed their harnesses, and allowed them to lay back in the straw.

�Sleep well girls. Your training starts in earnest tomorrow.�

Chapter Seven

For the next three days Ben took the girls out in the morning, and at night together, but solo in the afternoon. At first 27 had missed her partner, but had found that her strength and stamina had increased, and had pulled her trap around the track faster than she had been able before. 

The understanding between the two girls was growing. Especially as they were doing night runs as well. And Ben seemed happy with their performance. The Gala was only a few days away, and he wanted the girls ready for it. It really didn&#8217;t matter if they won, but it would be nice to get one over on Gregory. 

Gregory was the Boss&#8217;s nemesis. He always won the meets, having always got his hands on the best girls. But he trained using violence, not nurturing the girls. Of course, each was free to choose how to train his girls, but Gregory beat his girls if they lost, and beat them severely. That didn&#8217;t happen with the Boss. He wanted to win. But there was more to winning, there was pride in the girls, pride in what they achieved, and pride in the fact that he never used violence for losing a race. In fact, the only time he ever used violence at all, was when a girl was blatantly disobedient.

The feud between the Boss and Gregory had been going on for a few years. They had once been partners, but had fallen out when Gregory had started to be violent towards the girls. The Boss had thought that what they did to the girls to start with was violent enough. None would bear children, none would ever speak again, and the suffering wearing the high heeled boots permanently. Re-shaping their feet, was more than enough. But Gregory insisted on more violence, using the whip for little or no reason.

In the end the Boss bought Gregory&#8217;s share of the business, and Gregory set up on his own. He had a large stable of girls, so if one was injured, he could simply use another. Whereas the Boss kept only a few, and had them trained slowly and correctly.

It would be good to get one over on Gregory, and with the white and the black, Ben thought there was a chance. They were the fastest twin he had ever worked, and both girls were getting better in their solo rigs as well.

It was not easy to train a twin, especially as neither of them could actually see the other when they were side by side. The blinkers and the posture collars made certain of that. But he had noticed that they touched hands on the centre post occasionally. As if giving each other signals. Shortly after Ben had spotted this he was going to stop it, but, it seemed to help them, especially going round the bends at speed. Not once since the girls had been communicating this way had they taken the bends too wide, and lost valuable seconds, in fact, they took the bends quite close, so he had not stopped it, but had watched closer, and it really did help. The one time Ben had put leather mittens on the girls to stop them touching, they had not run as well, so he went back to allowing them to touch.

Ben really thought the Boss had a chance with these two, and would love to see Gregory&#8217;s face if they defeated his own girls.

There was still quite a bit of work to do before the meet, not least was to see how the builders were getting on with the three new traps. The Boss had decided that they should have new ones for the meet. New girls, new traps. 

Ben walked over to the carpenter&#8217;s yard and found Stuart, the chief �mechanic�, working on a wheel.

�How&#8217;s it going Stu?�

�Hi Ben.� Stuart had worked with the Boss even before Gregory had split. The latter wanting Stuart to go with him, and had been annoyed when Stuart turned him down flat.

�The two single traps are done, just waiting for the lacquer to dry. This is the last wheel for the twin, and I should have it painted by tomorrow, and lacquered the day after. Gregory is going to be pissed off. The V shape on the new traps will make them faster than his round ones, as they will cut through the air better.�

Normal traps were either square or had rounded front, similar to those used in the Roman games. Stuart&#8217;s idea was that be shaping them differently, they would create less resistance, and therefore be a little faster. On computer, taking the readings that Ben had given him about the two girls who would be using the traps, Stuart had worked out that they would have a three second advantage over Gregory on the straight, and would not lose anything on the bends.

�Okay. Lets hope no-one has told Gregory about your designs.� Laughed Ben

�If he has these designs, I will leave no stone unturned finding who has leaked the info. The designs are not on the internet computer, so he cant have hacked in� Stuart grinned. �though I did accidentally mention something on the boards about new aerodynamics. Just to keep him guessing, as I know he reads them.�

�You&#8217;re&nbsp; a swine Stu. The poor man will be having kittens�

Walking away Ben could hear Stuart laughing behind him. But Stuart was right. If Gregory got a hint that there was something new, he would search heaven and earth to find it. And if what Stuart said was right about the three seconds, and the communication between the two girls on the bends helped. There was a chance the Boss could win the twins, and maybe even one of the solos.

Going back across the yard, Ben headed for the track, which was being made ready for the meeting, a couple of days away. Gregory would arrive the day before the meeting but some of the other owners had already started to arrive, and their girls were ensconced in stables already. By the time of the meeting, every stable would be full, and the Boss&#8217;s girls would train in the paddock. It was a general rule that when one owner was exercising his girls. the others stayed away. There was no written rule that stated one owner could not watch another owners girls, but it was a gentleman&#8217;s agreement that everyone stuck to. Even Gregory.

Ben, for some reason, was exempt from this rule, as he was the stable manager, but everyone knew he never passed information about other owner&#8217;s girls. not even to his own Boss.&nbsp; Ben was well respected by everyone in the game, and got on well with all the owners.&nbsp; Some of them often joked with him, asking which girl his money would go one, but Ben always smiled and told them he was not a betting man, even though he was going to bet this time, on the twins race. He was sure that his team would win, unless Gregory found a way to noble them first.

The Sheik had always brought great runners, but Gregory&#8217;s seemed to have the edge all the time. Ben couldn&#8217;t help think that Gregory had a spy in The Sheik&#8217;s camp. But there was no such spy here on the Island. All the men were handpicked by the Boss, and were paid enough to be loyal. 

As he passed the paddock on the way to the track two girls were racing each other around the grass, one wearing red leather harness and panties was out on front, but the other girl, dressed the same but in black leather, was slowly gaining on her.

Reaching the track Ben stood and watched as three men were re-painting the lines on the track, and two more were loading straw into the stable block. Everything was going to plan, and his own two girls were resting. He would take them out for a warm up later, but, for now they could rest. He wanted them as fresh as possible for the meeting.

Happy with developments, Ben returned to his office.

Chapter Eight

27 and her stable mate woke to loud noises in the yard outside their door. A great many voices laughing and shouting, and the sounds of wheels running across the yard.

They waited patiently for Ben to come and feed them their breakfast, as he always did, but for more than half an hour they were ignored.

A few times they heard footsteps outside their door, but each time the footsteps just kept going. Neither girl had any idea what was happening, and both were a little apprehensive.

The voices began to drift off as 27 and her friend still waited.&nbsp; Only when the yard became silent again did Ben come to their stable.

�Well girls, you may be pleased to know you are the centre of attention, and, as yet, no-one has even seen you.� He said as he placed their meals into their hands. �The Boss has been extolling your virtues, especially to Gregory. I think the Boss has high hopes for you two. This is the day you have both been training for, and the day we all hope you fulfil your potential. Each of you will run twice today, first as solos, and then together. It doesn&#8217;t matter how well you do in the solos, but as a pair we expect good things of you. You will be first out� he aid, pointing at the girl in white. �And you will be second. There will be a large number of people in the track area, but don&#8217;t let them put you off. Just do what you have been doing this past few weeks, and ignore anything else. Be careful of the girls dressed in gold latex. Those are Gregory&#8217;s girls, and usually win everything in sight. They take the bends tight, forcing other girls to take a wide turn, and losing valuable time. the only way to stop that is to get to the bend first. if you can do that, and force his girls wide, you stand a chance. In your solo runs you will meet them if you win your first runs. In the pairs though, you will not meet them unless you reach the final. So its in your hands girls. this is what the extensive training has been for.�

With that Ben left the stable. Leaving the two girls to eat, and mull over his words.

27 was a little upset to hear that no-one expected them to do well in solo runs. As she was quite fast on her feet, and could also run tight on the bends. That is what Ben had been training her to do for the past week. She guessed the other girl had been having the same training, and although she preferred the outside of the track, 27 guessed she was able to hold the bends well.

An hour later and once again their stable door opened, but it was not Ben that entered, but another girl, like themselves covered from head to toe in red latex. She put down the box she carried, and took out a bottle of clear liquid. Starting with the girl in white, she first sprayed the liquid all over the white latex, and then, using a cloth, began to polish the latex up. By the time she had finished the white latex shone in the sunlight streaming through the doorway. Then she turned her attention to 27. It felt strange to feel other hands rubbing her body, as her latex was polished from top of the head down to where the boots came half way up her calves. 27 was a little embarrassed when the girl began polishing her chest, as she could feel her nipple harden. There had been no sex in any way since her arrival, and it surprised and embarrassed her that she should feel it now. but the girl polishing her seemed to ignore it. As 27 looked over at the girl in white she thought she saw something in her eyes, something not seen before, but without communication, she would never know what the girl was thinking.

Once the girl in red was satisfied that both girls looked as good as they could, she began to place the white girl&#8217;s harness on her. until this moment, only Be had done the harnessing, and 27 watched as the white girl was harness, except for the bridle and blinkers. 

The girl in red stood back and admired her work, before moving over to 27, holding the black and gold harness that 27 had so painstakingly polished. Within minutes, she too was harnessed up, and the girl once again stood back and admired her work, before leaving the stable and closing the door behind her.

27 wondered if the girl in red had also been made mute, as she and her stable mate had, and also wondered if she was, in fact, also one of the Boss&#8217;s girls.

Twenty minutes later Ben arrived, carrying two pairs of latex panties. one was in white latex, the other in 27&#8217;s black. 27 could not look down because of her collar, but watched as Ben approached the other girl, telling her to lean on him and lift one leg. Obeying, the girl lifted her right leg, and Ben slid the first leg of the panties past her foot and ankle. gingerly. As she placed her foot back on the floor, she lifted her left, just a few inches, so Ben could get the other leg over her foot. It took a few minutes to pull the tight latex up the girl&#8217;s body, and it was only as 27 lost sight of the other girl&#8217;s crotch for the first time, that she realised that neither of them had worn anything over their crotch since they had met. It had actually become normal.

Even as Ben was pulling her own black latex panties on, 27 tried to remember what she looked like before all this had happened, but try as she may, she could not dredge a picture of herself to mind. So much had happened, so much had changed. 27 no longer existed, she knew that. In her place was this latex clad woman who had been trained for one end only. She knew she was fitter than when she had arrived, the constant exercise had seen to that, and her feet no longer hurt, even though she guessed now that she would never straighten them again without extensive help. So much change.

Ben then picked up the other girl&#8217;s bridle and began to enclose her head, pressing the bit between the girl&#8217;s lips. And tightening the strap behind her head. 27 knew that in a few moments she would again lose sight of the girl, unless they were facing each other the collars preventing them turning their heads, and the blinkers ensuring that they could not look to the side. As Ben approached her she felt an excitement she had never felt before, and was not sure why. She knew, now, that even if she were released tomorrow, she could never return to her old way of life. Not only because the police would arrest her for the murder of Robin, but because there was something about her new way of life that pleased her. 

It had taken long chats to herself to accept that she actually enjoyed having no control over what happened to her. it had started a a joke with Robin, but she was now living that joke, and it was anything but one. This was her life, and the hardest thing for&nbsp; 27 was to have accepted that. But she had, and she wondered if that was why she was upset when Ben had said no-one expected too much of them in the solo runs.

27 and the other girl were led out of the stable side by side, and walked over to the large wooden gates, which now stood wide open. As they entered the track area there was a bubble of noises, and even with their limited vision, both girls knew that there were a lot of people there. Ben walked the two girls over to the stable block, and secured them to a post outside one of the stable doors.

An imposing man in a white suit, black tie and a smile stood in front of them, so they could see him.

�Well girls� his voice was soft, but both girl&#8217;s knew that this man was in charge. �This is your day, and I hope you are going to do me proud. Ben thinks highly of both of you, which is why I have only entered you two in the meet, instead of any of my other girls. you both look good, and I have watched you train several times. I think my friend on the other side of the track will have some competition on his hands this time. good luck girls�

With that the whiter suited man disappeared from their vision as he walked around behind them. They could hear him talking to Ben, as they walked off, but could not hear what was being said.

A few minutes later and Ben returned, telling the girl in white that she was in the second heat, and then turned to 27 and told her that she was in the following heat. 27, it seemed, had missed meeting one of Gregory&#8217;s girls, but the other girl had drawn one in her heat. 

�You need to finish first or second to get through� Ben said to both of them. �You wont know who is behind you, or how close, but you will be able to see who is in front of you. Try to keep only one person in front of you when you come off the last bend. Its only a single lap, so you need to get down that back bend as fast as you can. I will be in the trap, just follow my signals and do the best you can.�

The girl in white was then taken away and placed&nbsp; between the posts of her trap, Ben checking to make sure all her straps were secure.

Minutes later and 27 heard Ben move the trap and turned to face the track. 

There were four traps on the start line, including the gold latex of Gregory&#8217;s girl. She was a little taller than 27&#8217;s friend, and the gold latex made her look a little slimmer, like 27 and her friend, she was unable to turn her head, but she did look graceful as she walked slowly to the start line. The man in her trap was around the same build as Ben, and he carried a long whip in one hand. 

The four girls lined up on the line, waiting for the starter to get them going. 

A starter pistol fired, and the girls were off. Gregory&#8217;s girl was first off the line, with a girl in just a leather harness and leather panties in second place. 27&#8217;s stable mate was in third place as they approached the first bed. Ben had been driving the traps for many years, and as they reached the bend she slowed his girl down a fraction. As he had said she would, Gregory&#8217;s girl took the inside line, forcing the girl in leather to take the bend wide. Ben waited, and then urged his girl on. Pulling past the leather girl, in second place as they came off the far side of the bend.

Down the back straight Ben pulled closer to the lead girl, breathing down the drivers neck as they came closer to the bed. Ben saw the man raise his whip and bring it down on his girl&#8217;s back. Ben hated using the whips, except for punishment, as he always believed it could break a girl&#8217;s concentration. Just as it did then. The girl lifted her head back as the whip struck, and marginally slowed. But they did have the inside line, and Ben was forced to take his own girl a little wider than he had hoped for. But the girl in third place had started to fall back, unable to keep up the pace that the front two had set,&nbsp; coming off the last bed Gregory&#8217;s girl had the advantage, and pulled away a little faster, crossing the line only a second or two before Ben.

Around the track their was a roar of appreciation, as Ben slowed his girl down, and walked her back to the stables, to where 27 was waiting.

�Well done girl� he said as he climbed off the trap. �You are in the semi final. Two more runs and then you get to ret until the twins this evening. Lets see what you can do� he said to 27 as he began to place her between the straps of the trap.

27 had drawn the inside lane, which Ben seemed very happy about. As he walked her up to the line he reminded 27 of her training.&nbsp; Trot up to the first bend, as normal, and if anyone was getting too close he would touch her on the shoulder with the whip, and she would increase her speed. As she came off the bend she was to trot faster, until she felt the touch of the whip, and then go at full pace around the final bend, and towards the finish line. He also reminded her that she only had to finish in the top two, and then told her he had every faith in her ability.

27 was unable to see who she was racing against, even though she had seen that some of the other girls wore no blinkers, nor collars. The ones Ben had told them to watch for, she saw in the first race, were blinkered and collared as she was.

She felt Ben climb into the trap behind her, and waited for the starter pistol to go off.

For a few minutes she stood still, as Ben talked her through the race again, quietly. Then he told her to get ready.

 Seconds later the pistol rang out, and Ben ushered 27 on her way. 

As she trotted up the first straight she could hear other heels to her side, but Ben didn&#8217;t touch her shoulder, so she assumed she was in front or close to being. As they approached the bend 27 was pulled in tight to the track, forcing her to take the bend as tight as possible, before he gave her her head and tapped her lightly on the shoulder with the whip. Increasing her pace, 27 came off the bend and into the straight on a fast trot, knowing that just before the final bend he would again touch her shoulder.

She was breathing a little heavier than normal, but put that down to the heat of the sun overhead, as at last, Ben touched her shoulder again, and she began to move as fast as the boots would allow her.

Taking the bend at high speed had become second nature for 27, and she held the track as tight as she could, breaking off the bend and into the final straight. Again, Ben touched her with the whip, and she made a final effort to speed up, not knowing if she really had done, or just imagined it. In seconds, she had crossed the white line, and Ben was&nbsp; slowing her down, and bringing her to a halt.

There was a lt of hollering and whooping behind her, and 27 wondered what it was for, until Ben&nbsp; climbed off the trap and walked to where she could see him.

�Well done girl. We just beat the track record set by one of Gregory&#8217;s girls three years ago. Gregory is raging.�

Ben patted the back of her head gently. And then walked her slowly back to their own stable point, where the other girl was waiting for them.

�We can rest for the next two races� he told the girls, leading them out of the sun, into one of the stables. �I suggest you rest on the straw until the next race.�

As they entered the stable 27 almost collapsed on the straw at her feet. It had not just been her imagination, she really had been going faster than normal, and it was not the sun that made her more tired.

For the next half an hour the two girls rested, until Ben came to collect the girl in white for her semi final. She would be racing against the girl in gold again&nbsp; this time,&nbsp; leaving 27 with the other Gregory&#8217;s girl her own semi final, which would follow this race. Ben had already told her she would not met Gregory&#8217;s girl until the final. She had not seen the other girl run, and would not know what to expect, but the Stable manager seemed happy with the result so far. 

She wanted to see her friend run again, but from her point in the stables, she would not see much of the race. Though she mentally wished her friend good luck, as Ben walked her out of the stable and placed her in the trap, before walking the girl to the start line.

Ben walked the girl over to the start line, and stopped as they neared it.

�Cathy� he started, the first time he had used her name since she had arrived. �I know you want to do the same as 27, and run fast and win. But I don&#8217;t want that. I want you to finish second. Behind Gregory&#8217;s girl. So follow the reins, not your heart. There is a good reason for it, and 27 is also going to finish second to Gregory&#8217;s girl in the other race. That way the Boss and Gregory will have two girls each in the final. And that is the race to win. So, be good, and do as you are told.�

Climbing into the trap Ben led the girl over to the white line, and brought her into position, next to Gregory&#8217;s gold covered girl. She wanted to look over, but the collar she wore prevented that, and all she could do was wait for the starting pistol, and Ben&#8217;s guidance.

As the pistol sounded, Ben urged Cathy forwards, but didn&#8217;t push her, as he knew that both she and Gregory&#8217;s girl could easily beat the other two. At the first bend Gregory&#8217;s girl again went for the inside track, but Ben had anticipated this, and instead of driving Cathy wide, followed the golden girl, keeping to the inside line, and exiting the bend in second place. 

As Gregory&#8217;s girl began to speed up on the back straight, Ben urged Cathy on to keep up with her, though allowing the golden coated girl to pull away slightly. As they reached the final bend, Gregory&#8217;s girl was in front, and Cathy was just&nbsp; a few feet behind her, waiting for Ben to give her the touch that would send her speeding towards the line. But the touch didn&#8217;t come, and she fought hard to resist the temptation to speed up, remembering what he had said about finishing second.

As she crossed the line she could already see the other girl had come to a halt, and had won. Ben brought her to a slow halt, and climbed off the trap and came to speak to her.

�Well done girl. You were second, just as we wanted you. I am sure you can beat her, but we want you and 27 to finish second, so that Gregory will raise the ante on his bet with the Boss. Had you beaten his girl, he would resist. Now. lets get back to the stable, and get 27 ready for her race.�

With that Cathy walked reluctantly back to the stable, where Ben hitched her to a post., and readied 27. Cathy could hear Ben telling her the same as he had told her, that she was not going to win this particular heat, but would come second. 27, for an instant started to shake her head, wanting to win, but again Ben explained why she was to finish second now. She would be able to win the final, but she had to come second in this heat.

Together, Ben and 27 made their way to the start line for their race, Ben explaining again that she must obey the commands and ignore her pride.&nbsp; Again they drew the inside lane, with Gregory&#8217;s gold cladded girl immediately to her left, which obviously gave 27 the advantage, as Gregory&#8217;s girl would have to move faster if she was to get to the inside lane before the first bend. 

As the starting pistol fired, and the race began, 27 trotted off as she always did, but expected Ben to rein her in to allow her to be passed. She was surprised when this didn&#8217;t happen, and she went around the bend on the inside lane. To her surprise, she got the tap on the shoulder telling her to speed up as thy came off the bend, and 27 moved faster. Along the back straight there was another tap on her shoulder, telling her to go as fast as she could, as she approached the bottom bend. 27 was confused, as she could see there was no-one in front of her, and she had been told she would finish second to the girl in gold. But as she hit the home straight, Ben urged her on again, rather than reining her in, forcing her over the line.

As they crossed the line Ben began to rein her in, slowing her down, and bringing her to a stop, before walking her slowly back to the stables where Cathy was waiting.

�Confused?� asked Ben as he hitched 27 to the post.

27 could only blink.

�Gregory&#8217;s girl was right behind you as we went into the bend, but as she couldn&#8217;t get the inside line she had to move faster to get past you. In doing so, she lost her footing, and fell down, tipping the trap. After that, any attempt to do anything other than win, would have made it obvious that we didn&#8217;t want to do. But that means you are both in the final, Gregory has one girl, and so does the Sheik. But that isn&#8217;t until this afternoon, so you will get chance to rest.�

Releasing Cathy from the post, he walked her inside the stable and began to remove the harness, allowing her to move her head for the first time in hours. Minutes later, and 27 joined her in the stable. Ben told them that food would be brought round soon, but warned them against eating too much. 

With a smile he opened a door neither girl had seen before and pointed to a toilet. The first real toilet either girl had seen since they arrived on the island.

�The Boss is pleased with you, and has allowed you a reward.&nbsp; If either of you win the final. He will install one into your stable. So now you have something to win for.�

With that Ben left the stable and closed the door, leaving the two girls alone.

It was going to be a great race, but Andy would have to ride Cathy. 27 was most definitely his to ride.

Chapter Nine

There was a loud hub of noise in the track area. Gregory only had one girl in the final, and this had not happened before. He was furious that one girl had fallen, and he had told her rider that when they got her home, she would be whipped badly. The rider had nodded his head, fearful of disobeying his boss.

27 had drawn the inside lane, the Sheik had drawn lane two, Gregory had drawn lane three, leaving Cathy on the outside lane, with little chance of success, unless she could get ahead of Gregory&#8217;s girl, and catch the Sheik before the final bend.

There was a&nbsp; lot of&nbsp; money being wagered on the race, and, for once, Gregory was not the favourite. The Sheik&#8217;s had won her first race, as had 27, and had also come second to 27 in the last race. Cathy had also come second. To the remaining Gregory runner. There was little between Gregory&#8217;s girl and 27 in the betting, though Gregory and her owner always had a private bet.

�What&#8217;s it to be Gregory?� asked 27&#8217;s owner in his executive box. 

Gregory looked over at his host, deep in thought. 

�I am willing to bet that my girl finishes ahead of your black, to the tune of 1000�

�Only a grand Gregory?� laughed the host. �Lets make it interesting. Five grand�

�That&#8217;s a lot of money to bet on two newbies isn&#8217;t it?�

�What can I say?&nbsp; I have faith�

�Faith doesn&#8217;t pay the bills Watson. You know that. But, if you want five grand, you&#8217;ve got it�

The two men shook hands, and the deal was set/ if Gregory&#8217;s girl finished in front of his own white, it made no difference, but if his gold crossed the line before his own black, it would cost him a llot of money.

He called Ben in the stables and informed the stable manager of his bet.

�You want to win, or lose boss?� asked Ben.

�What are their chances in the twins?�

�I think you have the best twins on the island. If they don&#8217;t win, I&nbsp; will eat my hat�

�If they lose this one, I lose five grand. But could gain more in the twins, as Gregory would bet a lot more if he thought his own girls had the beating of mine.�

�Its your call Boss� replied Ben.

Ben listened to the response and nodded, before hanging up the phone.

Looking around the stable he found Andy, and told him what the boss had said, though neither girl could hear him. Andy nodded his head, and began to prepare the trap for the race.

Just then Ben&#8217;s phone rang again, and as he answered it he nodded his head.

�Change of plan, Andy. One of ours is being dropped from the race, and they are going to run a pursuit race. The Boss wants Cathy to run it, so Gregory still doesn&#8217;t see the real 27 until the twins race. Personally, I think Gregory already knows he has a problem, but the Boss is the Boss.�

Andy was a tall thin man, light brown hair tied back in a pony tail, and had worked on the Island for many years. He was good at handling the traps, and he had a way of getting the best out of the girls without using the whip very much.

�Who is taking Cathy out?�

�You can Andy. The girls will be split equally around the track, the first one to catch the one in front of her, wins. The Sheik&#8217;s girl will be number one, Gregory&#8217;s girl number two, and Cathy will be last, not that the positions make any difference, except that Gregory&#8217;s girl is faster than the Sheik&#8217;s. If you can finish close up to Gregory&#8217;s girl, that&#8217;s good enough.�

Andy nodded and went to fetch his girl from the stable. As he led her back to her trap he spoke softly to her, stroking her head and shoulders gently as he spoke.

Ben never knew what Andy ever said to the girls, but he did seem to get the best out of them. Even so, 27 was going to be ridden only by Ben, unless the Boss said differently.

The three girls in the race were spread out on the track. Although the riders could see the other girls clearly. The girls themselves would only see each other as they came off a bend, unless they were catching up on the girl in front.

As the pistol went to start the race, the three girls set off at roughly the same pace. None seemed to be gaining an advantage on the others, as the first circuit was completed. Andy knew that Gregory&#8217; rider would make a move on the second circuit, and readied himself to respond, holding the reins tight in his hands.

Looking around the track Andy saw Gregory&#8217;s man lift his whip, ready to speed his girl up. Even before the whip had landed, Andy had tapped Cathy on the shoulder and she had started to move faster, gaining a few yards on the girl in front. Ot wasn&#8217;t much, but those few yards would stop her getting left behind when Gregory&#8217;s girl began to run faster.

On the second circuit it became clear that the Sheik&#8217;s girl was starting to tire a little, and that Gregory&#8217;s girl was slowly eating into the distance between them. Andy urged Cathy on a little faster, but well within her capabilities.

The distance between Cathy and Gregory&#8217;s girl seemed less as they chased the weakening Sheik&#8217;s girl. By the end of the second lap. It was clear that the Sheik was not going to win this race, though his girl was doing all she could to stay in front. She could hear footsteps behind her, and knew that the others were catching up with her. 

On the third lap, as Cathy came off the top bend, she could now see both of the other girls in front of her, but the distance between Gregory&#8217;s girl and the Sheik&#8217;s girl was less than the distance between herself and the girl in front. She didn&#8217;t need Andy&#8217;s touch to tell her to speed up, as she began to move as fast as her legs would allow. For her own pride, she wanted to be as close to the girl in gold as she could when the race finished.

The Sheik&#8217;s girl was tiring fast, and Gregory&#8217;s girl was catching her with ease. Cathy was still some way behind, but also catching the golden girl. As the third lap ended, it would only be a matter of time before the Sheik lost.

As the fourth lap began, Andy cracked his whip in the air, touching no-one, but making a lot of noise. Gregory&#8217;s girl, who was now only fifteen yards in front of him, heard the crack, and tried to turn her head, which slowed her down a little. Cathy had ignored the whip, and was able to gain another couple of yards on the girl in gold. As they came off the top bend, it was going to be a close finish. There was five yards between Gregory&#8217;s and the Sheik&#8217;s girls, with Cathy less than ten yards behind. Andy didn&#8217;t need to give Cathy any other instructions, he knew from her attitude already, that she wanted to reach the girl ion front, and allowed her her head to do what she could, only keeping a light hold on the reins.

The gap was closing, as Cathy drew some strength from somewhere, and was fast closing on the girl in front. The gap down to five yards, and Andy could see the rider in front of him turning frantically, trying to stay in front, and still catch the Sheik&#8217;s girl. 

Where it came from Cathy never knew, but it felt as if her heart was bursting as she made one final effort, and the distance between her and the golden girl shrank dramatically. Gregory&#8217;s rider knew he only needed a few more yards to catch the Sheik&#8217;s girl, and was concentrating on this, when there was a tap on his shoulder.

There was a loud cheer throughout the track area, as Andy tapped Gregory&#8217;s rider on the shoulder. The race was over, and although there was only a yard between the golden girl and the Sheik&#8217;s girl, it was a yard too far.

Cathy collapsed to the ground as soon as she was released from the trap, having given everything she had in that final effort. She lay on the ground shaking, her legs too weak to hold her, her breath coming in short sharp gasps.

Andy bent over the girl and whispered in her ear, though what he said no-one else hard. With supreme effort, Cathy began to move, allowing Andy to help her to her feet. 

Slowly they walked to the centre of the track, and Andy led her to the stalls in the centre, leading her into the winning stall. It had been some time since any of the Boss&#8217;s girls had stood there. It was usually Gregory&#8217;s girl. Someone people had even nicknamed it the golden circle, after the colour of their latex. It would have to be renamed now.

Andy looked up towards the stand and could see that the Boss and Gregory were in a heated exchange, as he began to lead Cathy back to the stable where 27 was still waiting.

As Andy removed Cathy&#8217;s harness he told her the Boss was proud of her. for whatever reason, this seemed to make Cathy happy and a smile appeared on her lips.

In the stands Gregory was still arguing.

�Listen Henderson. You dropped the girl that broke the track record, and replaced er with that other girl. When we agreed to run a pursuit race, I expected to run against the record breaker, not the one in white.�

�Don&#8217;t be a sore loser� Henderson responded. �You have won here more times than anyone else, always taking the big prizes. It really didn&#8217;t matter which girl ran in the race. If the one that ran won, imagine what the other one would have done.�

�Pursuit is a long race Henderson. The girl in black was fast, I agree, but I was counting on her not having the stamina to keep going. To swap her for the other girl meant leaving your fastest girl out, which was not part of the agreement.�

�We didn&#8217;t say which girl would be dropped. We agreed to drop one of my girls, and run a pursuit. That&#8217;s what happened. Don&#8217;t be such a sore loser. Or are you just jealous that my girls are now faster than yours?�

Gregory slammed his glass on the table.

�I expect both of your girls to run the twins tonight I have brought two girls especially for that race, and as they are my best girls, I would expect you to run your own best girls.�

Henderson laughed.

�Don&#8217;t worry Gregory. My girls will be there. I have only declared the two girls for the whole of the meeting. It&#8217;s the Sheik you should worry about, he has registered five girls. and so far, only used two�

With that, Henderson walked away, still smiling. It was so good to get one over on Gregory. He would have to give both Ben and Andy a bonus.

Chapter Ten

The twins races were scheduled for early evening, after all the girls had fully recovered had they been involved in the solo races.

27 and Cathy were still in their stable, waiting to be re-harnessed ready for the race.

Ben entered the stable and spoke to them.

�We are up against the Sheik in the first race. I don&#8217;t think we will have much of a problem in that one, as long as you do what you have been trained to do. 27 will take the inside, with Cathy on the left. Gregory is also up against the Sheik, as he has registered four girls for this race. I don&#8217;t really think he expects to win, but the Sheik usually enters for fun more than winning. The Boss also enters for fun, unless Gregory is involved. If we win the first race, we can expect to race Gregory in the final. It&#8217;s a two lap race, with half an hour between the race and the final. So in the first one we only do what we have to do to win, nothing more. Save all the energy you can for the final. This will also be a two lap race, but the speed you two girls have will be important, as will the communication you have built up between yourselves. Now, I shall be back soon, so I suggest you rest.�

With that Ben left the girls alone again. 27 looked over at Cathy and smiled. She knew they could beat the Sheik&#8217;s girls, it was the final they worried about. According to Ben Gregory was expected to win, and with Cathy winning the singles trophy, there was only the twins left. It was going to be some race, neither wanting to lose. Gregory&#8217;s girls out of fear, Henderson&#8217;s girls out of pride.

It was twenty minutes before Ben reappeared carrying the harnesses. Quickly he got the girls into their leathers and smiled as he looked at them.

The made a lovely looking pair, each displaying long legs, emphasised by the heels on their boots. Their bodies were strong and athletic, though covered in latex. 27 had been the first to be totally covered, whilst Cathy had been covered from neck downwards. This had changed after Henderson had seen how 27 looked, and she had been returned to the doctor to have her hair removed, and back to the paint shop to have her head covered as well. Like 27, the outfit was now one, and would remain in place until Henderson decided otherwise.

As he led the two girls out of the stable to their new trap, Ben was proud of both of them. He had trained many girls over the years, but these two were special. He had realised that the first time he had taken them out to train. Whilst Cathy was strong, 27 was fast and strong. He knew Cathy had the stamina, as he had trained her for long periods on wet ground, where both strength and stamina would be needed. With 27 it had mostly been track work, and she had always been fast. Even when he had taken her around the track two or three times at a single go, she had not tired, and had still been fast.

Then he had seen the touching hands, their own communication, and had studied this. He knew that they were �talking� this way, and had allowed it, as it meant that each knew what the other was doing, and together they formed a bond that would make them great.

The floodlights were now turned on, ensuring the track stayed light as the day gave way to early evening. There was a buzz about the place in anticipation of what was to come. Ben had already checked and seen that Gregory&#8217;s girls were favourites to win. He had secretly bet on his own girls, getting a good price. Everyone seemed to know that Gregory had brought two girls for whom the twins was a speciality, and going from his previous track record, this meant he would have good girls. but Ben had faith in his own girls, and with the new trap, it was anybodies race.

Walking the girls to the track for the first race, Ben could hear the noise of the crowd, and spoke softly to the girls, telling them to ignore it. All they had to do was remember their training, and do what was asked of them.

They were joined on the track by the Sheik&#8217;s first set of girls, and waited patiently for the starting pistol. 27 felt Cathy stroke her hand, a signal that she was ready, and 27 returned the stroke. It was as if they had decided that they would win at all costs.

The pistol fired, and both sets of girls set off. At first there was nothing between them, as they reached the first bend. Ben had given no signal to speed up, so both girls stayed at the same pace. Down the back straight for the first time, there was still no signal to speed up, even though they could hear the opposition&#8217;s footsteps close by.

They crossed the white start and finish line and had still not been given any signal to speed up, and even though 27 wanted to do so, she held back and waited.

It was on the back straight that the signal came. 27 touched Cathy&#8217;s hand, and they began to speed up. Neither girl knew it, but the Sheik&#8217;s girls were well behind them, and they were now only running to make it look good, passing the white line without even losing breath.

�Well done girls� came Ben&#8217;s voice as they came to a halt. You are in the final. That is half an hour plus the next race, but I will place you so that you can see the opposition�

With that, Ben walked them to a post near to the track and tethered both girls to it. They had a good view of the track from here. And would be able to see what went on. It would be the first race either of them had actually seen.

Gregory&#8217;s girls were resplendent in their tight fitting gold latex coatings, whist the Sheik&#8217;s girls wore simple leather harnesses, leather panties and high boots. 27 was a little surprised that not all then girls were covered head to toe in latex as she and Cathy were.

The four girls lined up on the start line, with the Sheik&#8217;s girls having drawn the outside lane. Remembering what Ben had said about Gregory&#8217;s girls liking the inside lane, she expected them to reach the bed first. but as the gun sounded, it was the Sheik&#8217;s girls who made the running, already slightly ahead by the first bend. They couldn&#8217;t quite get the inside line, but as they came off the bend they were level with the girls ion gold. Obviously, the Sheik had saved his best girls for this race, and they forced Gregory&#8217;s girls to really run. As they reached the bottom bend for the first time it was the Sheik&#8217;s girls who made the inside lane, forcing Gregory&#8217;s girls out wide. 

As they passed the white line for the first time, the Sheik&#8217;s girls were a few yards ahead, but Gregory&#8217;s girls were once again catching up.

At the top bend they were once again level, but the Sheik&#8217;s girls managed to hold onto the inside line, forcing the golden girls to run faster just to sty in touch. On the back straight, the Sheik&#8217;s girls began to slow down a little, but they had done what they had intended. They had forced Gregory&#8217;s girls to use maximum effort to win the race, so they would not be as fresh as 27 and her companion for the final race.

Ben was smiling as he came back to where the girls were tethered, untying them and leading them away to their stable. Once there he told the girls that the Sheik had realised that he could not beat either Gregory or the Boss, and had struck a deal. They had not overextended 27 and Cathy, so they would be rested well before the final. but he had used his best girls in an effort to tire Gregory&#8217;s girls. The Sheik really didn&#8217;t like Gregory, called him an arrogant upstart. 

This would give 27 and Cathy the edge, but it would still be a hard race, and if they couldn&#8217;t force themselves past Gregory&#8217;s girls and get the inside line, the girls in gold would win.

Ben made a few last minute checks to their harnesses, before leading the girls back out to the trap, and fastening them in place. Ben had done all he could now, it was really up to the girls. once on the track, he could only guide them. Only they could do the winning.

As they approached the track the loudspeaker sprung to life and a voice began to talk

�After an agreement by both Mr Henderson and Captain Gregory, this race will be run over three laps. Each will start at opposite sides of the track, and the first to complete three laps will be declared the winner.�

Ben was a little taken aback, as this had never happened before. Twins always ran two laps, not three, and always started at the same place. This was more like pursuit. But he had no choice in the matter. Gregory&#8217;s girls were already in place on the far side of the track, so Ben led his girls to the normal start line. With this it won&#8217;t be known until the first pair cross the line who has won, and they would not be trying to overtake on the bends.

He quickly explained to the girls what was happening, They would be time racing, rather than person racing, although they would race against Gregory&#8217;s girls. they would be racing against the clock., first home was the winner.

Ben led the girls to the start line, and waited for the pistol to start them off. He looked across the track to where Gregory&#8217;s girls were also waiting, nodding politely to the rider. The nod was not returned, but Ben didn&#8217;t care. 

The starter began to get everyone lined up properly, and then fired the pistol.

The first lap was a gentle stroll for both sets of girls. Ben was keeping his eye on what Gregory&#8217;s trap was doing, and doing nothing more than keeping pace with them. As the second lap started, Ben could see Gregory&#8217;s rider begin to urge his girls forwards, and gently tapped 27 on the shoulder. Obediently, 27 picked up the pace, and once again Ben could see that they were running at the same pace as the other trap. 

As they passed the white line for the second time, Ben gave 27 a double tap of the crop, telling her to go as fast as she could, ignoring everything. 27 stroked Cathy&#8217;s hand twice, and together they picked up the pace.&nbsp; As they came off the bend into the straight, Ben tapped 27 once more. Almost immediately, she and Cathy began to run at full gallop. Ben could see that Gregory&#8217;s rider had been taken by surprise, as he now urged his girls on as fast as they could go. 

As the final bend approached, 27 moved as close to the inside line as she could, taking the bend so tight it almost caught Cathy out. It certainly caught the other team out, as they had to take the bend wider. As the whiter line came closer, Ben yelled out to the girls for a last effort. As one, they rushed forward not knowing from where they gopt the extra energy. As they passed the line, both girls were, shattered and breathing hard. Ben knew he would have to get the belts off them as quick as he could, but not before the official declared the winner.

Ben and Gregory&#8217;s rider moved towards the centre of the track where the official was standing. 

The official would only hold up one hand, and his decision was final. If Gregory won, Henderson would have to accept that, once again, Gregory had got the better of him.

There seemed to be a lot of discussion between the official and two other men, each with watches in their hands. Apparently, there was little to choose between both sets of girls.

After about five minutes the official came and stood between ben and the other rider, taking one hand of each in his own. 

For what seemed a lifetime, the official made no movement, and then, to rapturous applaud, Ben&#8217;s hand was lifted into the air, declaring 27 and Cathy the winners.

Ben could hardly contain his excitement, having personally trained both girls, and neither ever having raced before today. In reality, they should have both gone into the novice meeting, but Ben had convinced Henderson that they were ready for the big race. And his faith had been justified.

He looked into the stands where Henderson was on his feet, applauding wildly, a smile lighting up his face.

Her turned to Gregory and held out his hand, and for once, Gregory looked down hearted. It was good to get one over on Gregory after all the times he had come second best to his ex partner.

Perhaps, a new era had began.

Time would tell.
