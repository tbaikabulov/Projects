Kavya sat down on a small bench placed on top of the college building�s terrace. �This is a wonderful, warm place to sit and think. Come, join me,� she tapped the seat next to hers.

�Wow, I�ve been in this college two years, never seen this spot before.� Priya said. �So quiet and secluded.�

�And warm,� Kavya said. �Check out the view from here. You can see the college grounds fully.�

Priya sat down on the bench and looked out to see the college�s football field. �Nice! This is a good spot, indeed.�

�Told you so,� Kavya said, staring out into the football field. �And those are our classmates playing out there!�

�Yeah.� Priya smiled. �And there�s Rahul.�

�What about him?�

�Oh, it�s nothing. He�s just, you know, a very close friend��

�Like a boyfriend?� Kavya asked.

�How could you know? I never told anybody about us.�

�I would know such things. I see the way he looks at you, and the way you look back at him.� Kavya said. �Your eyes get all big, and your breath slows down and your head turns sideways like this,� she said, leaning her head towards the left.

�You know body language or what?� Priya laughed.

�It�s just called good observation.� Kavya said.

�What about you? Don�t tell me there isn�t any mushy stuff going on with you��

�Yeah there is someone,� she blushed. �Rohan,� she pointed to one of the players on the football field.

�Wow.� Priya said. �He�s a very nice guy.�

�Yeah he is.� Kavya said. �It was almost like love at first sight. You remember the debates we had during the first year?� Priya nodded. �I saw this guy with his beautiful chest, his strong manly voice and his charisma.�

�I understand. I like him, too.� Priya said. �Look at you, you�re almost drooling right now.�

�Yeah I know.� Kavya said. �Love him, love him, love him.�

�You both look like a wonderful couple, too.� Priya said. Just then, there was a noise behind them. A classmate named Manoj had tripped on the terrace�s door, and tumbled to the floor with his heavy bag. The girls watched him in complete silence as he recovered from the fall, smiled at Kavya, giggled and walked out of the terrace. �What just happened?�

�Oh, he�s a bit of a stalker.� Kavya said.

�He was your boyfriend or something?� Priya asked.

�No. No way. Yuck, how�s that even possible? You�ve seen how he walks? It�s like he�s walking on the moon or something.� Kavya said.

�So why�s he stalking you?�

�For two years he just kept staring at me and said nothing. Then last week he tried to ask me out and I said �no�. We�ve been bumping into each other since. It�s been so awkward.�

�You just said �no�?�

�I said that I�m not interested in him.�

�Oh dearie.� Priya shook her head. �That�s never enough with these losers.�

�What should I do, Priya?�

�Just wait right here,� Priya said, jumping off the bench and sprinting out of the terrace behind Manoj. �Hey, Manoj! Wait for me.�

Manoj was one flight of stairs below. �Yes?�

�Kavya wants you to come upstairs.� Priya stated.

�She does?� Manoj asked, turning around and climbing up and giggling like an enthused monkey.

�Of course she does.� Priya said, guiding him to go towards the girl.

Manoj got onto the terrace and cautiously walked towards Kavya. He pointed to her and then to himself. �She said you wanted to see me?�

�I guess so,� Kavya shrugged.

Manoj made his way towards the bench she was sitting on. �Hey, that seat is mine. Just stand in front of her,� Priya said, showing him a spot before the pretty girl.

�What�s happening?� Manoj asked, darting glances between the two pretty women.

�Well,� Priya said, standing next to Manoj. �Why don�t you start by asking Kavya exactly what you asked her a week back?�

Ask her out again!

�You mean?� Manoj swallowed. Priya nodded. �Kavya,� Manoj said, getting down on his knees. �I�m in love with you, since the day I laid my eyes on you. Please go to dinner with me, so I can show you how much we both suit each other.�

�Is that exactly what you said?� Priya asked.

Manoj shook his head. �Isn�t she the one who�s supposed to answer my question?�

�She will give you your answer, alright.� Priya said. �But I want to make sure that you�ve got the words right.�

�This was exactly what I said, Priya.� Manoj said. �I wrote it down and practiced it before the mirror many times, so I could get it right when I ask her for real.�

�Of course you wrote it down.� Priya laughed. �Now, do you know that Kavya is in love with Rohan?�

�She is?� Manoj asked, his eyes turning left, then right.

�You knew it, didn�t you?� Priya asked.

Manoj shook his head. �No way. I wouldn�t ask her out if she wasn�t single.�

�Hey, you need to stop lying to us. Everyone knows about the two of them.� Priya said. �And Kavya cannot stand dishonest men. Your only shot here is to be honest.�

�Alright,� Manoj said. �I knew about them and I was hoping I could still win her over.�

�That�s better.� Priya said.

�What about your answer, Kavya? Please go out with me?� Manoj pleaded.

�Tell him exactly what you had told last week.� Priya said.

�I�m not interested.� Kavya said, pursing her lips.

�Hey, don�t do that.� Priya said. �You�re looking embarrassed. Come on, you�ve got an awesome boyfriend who�s keeping you happy. Say it with more force.�

�I�m not interested in you.� Kavya said, frowning at him and shaking her hands towards his face as if she were brushing him out of her life.

�Awesome.� Priya said. �Now,� she caught Manoj�s hand and locked them behind his back using her tight grip. �He starts crying.�

Manoj looked up to Kavya with tears in his eyes. �I�m so sorry.� Kavya said.

�Hey, you�ve got nothing to be sorry about.� Priya said. �He wants to break you up with your perfect boyfriend and you are stopping him. Be firm with him.�

�That�s true,� Kavya said, raising her head. �Manoj, I want you to get out of my life. I would never go out with you.�

�Because you have a boyfriend, I understand.� Manoj said.

�Yes.� Kavya said.

�NO!� Priya screamed. �I�ve faced obsessive men like him before. It�s very dangerous to say that you can�t be with him solely because you aren�t single.�

�How is it dangerous?� Kavya asked.

�Okay, I�ll tell you.� Priya said, keeping Manoj trapped under her grip. �Once, a guy had asked me out in school and I said I�m with another guy. So the guy went and beat up my boyfriend.�

�Seriously?� Kavya asked.

�Yes.� Priya said. �You�ve communicated that the only reason he can�t be with you is one boyfriend. So in his head, he only has to eliminate the boyfriend from the equation to be with you.�

�You reckon Manoj is like that?� Kavya asked.

Manoj shook his head but Priya began before he could speak. �Kavya, I know these guys. Tell me, how long has he been staring at you?�

�Two years plus.� Kavya said.

�That�s just what he does when he sees you. Imagine what�s going in his head the whole day. What would he dream about at night? Obsession builds up like that, you know.� Priya said.

�That�s true.� Kavya said. She turned to him. �Hey, Manoj,� Kavya said. Manoj looked up to her. �I will never ever go out with a loser like you. You suck!� she said. Tears flew out of Manoj�s eyes as he twisted under Priya�s shoulder lock. �Look at you crying away like a pathetic loser,� Kavya said. �What makes you think a girl like me would ever be with a guy like you?�

Priya nodded and smiled. �That�s sensational performance! Keep going, don�t stop.�

�In what universe do guys like you get girls like me?� Kavya asked, pointing to herself.

�Beautiful!� Priya laughed, gripping Manoj tighter and making him squirm at her feet. �That�s right, loser. Kiss her sandals.� Manoj opened his mouth and went for a kiss to Kavya�s sandals. �That�s what I thought. He�s a perverted slave.�

That's where you should be! Kiss her sandals

�You mean, the way he�s enjoying my sandals?� Kavya laughed.

�Exactly.� Priya said.

�Well if he�s enjoying my sandals,� Kavya raised her leg and kicked away Manoj�s face. �I will never let him kiss them again in his life.� She let her sandals drop to the floor and displayed her dirty feet to him. �You want to take a kick from these feet, loser?�

Manoj shook his head.

�Then that�s exactly what you�ll get.� Kavya said, delivering a hard kick to the reject�s face. �Take that, loser. And that,� she said, winding back her leg and pushing it forth for a hard kick that almost broke the bridge of his nose. �LO-SER. LO-SER.� Kavya said, kicking him once on the face as she spoke each syllable.

Take my kicks to your face!

Soon, Manoj�s face was combination of red from bleeding, blue from the impact of her kicks and black from the sticky dust she�d transferred to his face. Priya let go of him, and he dropped to the floor, defeated and soul deprived. �How do you feel?� Priya asked.

�Awesome.� Kavya said. �He deserved every bit of that.�

�Yes he did,� Priya said, smiling at the girl as she breathed heavily. �You feel like a big weight is off your shoulders?�

�I do, Priya. Thank you so much.� Kavya said.

�Let me test you, then.� Priya said, sitting next to Kavya. �What do you feel like doing to him now?�

�Grrrrrrr,� Kavya gritted her teeth. �I want to pound his head to the floor and watch him bleed. I want to spit on him. Then I want to pee on his ugly face and make him drink it. Grrrrr�. his mere presence pisses me off.�

�That�s perfect.� Priya said. �You have learned well, my child!�









�How long do you think it�ll take for this guy to get up?� Kavya said. �I can�t wait to pound the life out of him.�

�You will do that and much more, just wait.� Priya said, waiting with folded hands for the reject to get up from Kavya�s ruthless kicks to his face. Manoj began to stir, his head reeled from the sudden paucity of strength in his body. He slowly got up and looked at the two women sitting over him on the bench.&nbsp; �Are you awake, loser?� Priya asked.

�Yes,� Manoj said, holding his head in his hands to see if the world could stop spinning that way.

�How do Kavya�s sandals taste? You want some more?�

�Shut up.� Manoj said. �You girls had no right putting me through that kind of violence. It�s not a crime to fall in love with someone.�

�It isn�t a crime, that�s for sure. But you kept staring at her and stalking her. You basically creeped her out of any possibility of ever liking you .� Priya said.

�That�s crazy talk.� Manoj said.

�Hey, who said you can talk now?� Priya asked. �Shut up and take off Kavya�s sandals.�

Manoj looked at the girl�s black sandals and then to her frowning face. He hesitated for a few moments. Then he crawled forward and took off the sandals one by one.

Kavya smiled with Priya. �How come he is obeying you so easily?�

�I control people like him all day with my voice and my words. It�s not hard to make him do anything you want.� Priya said.

�Let me try that, then.� Kavya sad. She rested the left leg on the right and showed the bottom of her dirty foot to the reject. �Hey, loser!�

Look how dirty!

Manoj kept his head down.

�Hey, you fuckin� bastard! Why didn�t you respond to me just now?� Kavya asked.

�I didn�t hear my name.� Manoj said, looking up to her.

Kavya kicked his face hard with her dirty heels. �You are a loser. From now on, you�re going to respond to the call of �loser�. Is that understood?�

�Yes Kavya,� Manoj said, wiping tears off his face.

�That�s right. Now stop crying, you pathetic loser!� Kavya ordered. Manoj sniffled and rubbed off the tears in response. �That�s better. You are nothing but an ugly, creepy reject. You�re going to obey my every command. Starting with,� she stretched her left foot forward, �taking my dirty feet in your hands.�

Ask my feet out on a date!

�I will, Kavya.� Manoj caught Kavya�s dirty foot in his hands.

�Now ask me out again. But this time, you�re talking to my feet.� Kavya said.

�Kavya,� Manoj began.

�Talk to my feet, loser!� Kavya reminded.

�Kavya�s feet,� Manoj said, looking up to the bottom of her foot. �I have been in love with you since the day I laid my eyes on you.� Kavya laughed and Priya joined her with a high-five. �Please let me spend some time so you can see how much we suit each other,� he said, looking straight to the dusty feet.

�He wants a date with my beautiful feet!� Kavya said, sharing a hearty laugh with Priya. She then wiggled her toes. �My gorgeous feet on a date with a loser like you? I just don�t think it�s ever going to work out. I mean, look at my beautiful, flexible toes. You will never be good enough to go on a date with these toes.�

�Please, Kavya�s feet.� Manoj said.

�I will consider it if you kiss them.� Kavya said.

�Oh, come on. They�re so dirty,� Manoj cried.

�Do you want a date with them or not?�

Manoj closed his eyes and moved his head close to the feet, smelling their rotten flavor into his nose. He opened his mouth, converged his lips and pecked one of the toes.

�Oh my God! He actually kissed my feet.� Kavya said.

�Of course he did.� Priya said. �Don�t be fooled by the appearance. He�s loving every moment of it.�

�I�m done.� Manoj said. �I kissed your feet.�

Kavya caught her foot in her hand to check their bottoms. �There�s still so much dust on this foot. What sort of a loser are you, anyway? Can�t even clean my feet properly.�

�You told me to just kiss them,� Manoj said.

�Kiss them with your tongue. You know what a French kiss looks like, loser?� Kavya asked.

�Yes.� Manoj swallowed.

�Yeah. That�s exactly what I want you to do with my feet.� Kavya said, wiggling her toes.

Manoj caught the foot in his hand and opened his mouth wide. He went forward and mouthed much of her dirty heel, and kissed it with some intensity, cleaning up the sticky dirt surface with his agile tongue. �Oh my God. It tickles,� Kavya said.

�But it feels good?� Priya asked.

�Wonderful. We are putting this loser in his rightful place.� Kavya said.

Manoj�s tongue went up the arches of her feet, then to the two cheeks. He then sucked each of her toes. �That�s right. Put it into your mouth like a lollipop.� Kavya instructed. Manoj obeyed without question, and without the slightest hesitation. He was done in a few minutes; he stared at the foot as he sat back in place. Kavya checked her foot. �Hmmm, not such a bad job.� She then stretched her right foot forward. �But now my other foot is all dirty. Do them now, loser.�

Manoj obeyed swiftly, grabbing the feet and French kissing them with his tongue, cleaning up every speck of dust on them before placing them back on the ground. �Now, Kavya?�

Kavya checked the surface of both her feet. �You�ve genuinely cleaned them up with your disgusting tongue,� she nodded. �Keep both my feet on your face and ask them out again.�

Manoj picked up both her feet and placed them on his face, worshiping them like they were his Gods. �Please give me a chance with your feet.�

�You want to be a boyfriend of my feet?� Kavya asked.

�Yes. Please, yes.� Manoj cried.

�What do you say, Priya?� Kavya asked. �Is this loser good enough to be with my feet?�

�No way in hell.� Priya shook her head.

Kavya kicked off Manoj�s face. �You are rejected from that too. Not good enough for me, not good enough for my feet, either. That�s how much of a loser you are!�

You'll never be good enough for these feet!

Manoj fell to the floor and began to cry uncontrollably. �What do you want me to do, Kavya? Say it and I�ll do it.�

�I will tell you what to do.� Priya said. �Sit down on your hands and knees.� Manoj sat as he was told. �Now turn around,� Priya giggled.

�You�re going to kick my ass, aren�t you?� Manoj asked, turning around.

�That wasn�t what I had in mind, but if you want it so badly.� Priya placed her feet in position and gestured for Kavya to do the same. The girls kicked each of his butt cheeks as hard as they could, sending him crashing head first into the floor. �You can have it!� The girls clapped their hands and laughed.

If you want your ass kicked so badly!

Manoj rubbed his buttocks as he tried to recover from the hit. �Hey, loser. Get in position again.� Kavya said. �Priya has something she wants you to do.�

Manoj sat on his hands and knees again, and turned around. Priya stood up and walked over to his front. �Have you ever been to the ladies restroom, you disgusting pervert?�

�Never, Priya.�

�Even while stalking this girl?�

�Not the ladies room, Priya. No.� Manoj said.

�In that case,� Priya pointed to his back, �Kavya will sit on your back. You are going to ride her to the ladies room�

�Wow,� Kavya got up to sit on Manoj�s back. �You�re my four legged horsie. Take me to the ladies room, loser. Giddiyap!� She slapped the back of Manoj�s head. �Move! Now!�

Manoj began to walk on his fours, guided by Priya. He made his way out of the terrace with Kavya sitting comfortably on his back. �What are you girls going to do to me in the ladies room?� he asked.

�A bunch of stuff,� Priya said. �You need to be shown how inferior you are to a girl like Kavya. It�s a crime for a loser like you to even ask out a girl like her. Heck, it�s a crime for people like you to even imagine asking her out. We�re going to make you sorry that you ever dared to do it.�

Ride me to the restroom! Giddiyap!

�I�m sorry,� Manoj said as he reached the stairs.

�You�re just saying that because you have to ride me down these stairs.� Kavya said. �Nothing doing, loser. Start going down, now!�

Manoj landed one hand on a step, the other hand on the next step and began to step down the stairs on all fours. �See how naturally you adapt to this job?� Kavya asked. �This is where you belong, this is what God sent you for. Now go down faster.�

Ride me to the restroom! Giddiyap!

Manoj struggled with her weight on his back as he crawled down four flights of stairs on his tired hands and knees. They finally reached the ladies room. Priya went in first and came out a few seconds later. �The coast is clear. Bring him in.�









Kavya slapped Manoj�s head, just outside the ladies� room. �Get inside, loser!� Manoj moved forward, pushed the door using his head and crawled inside with Kavya riding on his back. He rode the girl of his dreams into the restroom and stopped right in front of Priya. �Stop,� she said, planted her feet on the ground and slowly raised herself off his back.

�Kneel down,� Priya said, �and look at yourself in these mirrors.�

Manoj knelt on the cold floor and looked at his bruised face in the mirrors and started to cry.

�How do you feel?� Priya asked.

�Ugly,� Manoj said. �I took such a nasty beating from you, Kavya.�

�Hey,� Kavya shook her head, �you�re making it sound like you did me a favor. You didn�t.�

�I most certainly didn�t do it for myself.� Manoj said.

�It nothing but just punishment for your crimes.� Priya said, strangling the man�s neck. �Look at yourself in the mirror. And look at Kavya. How can it even be possible for a creep like you to get a girl like that?�

�I�m not��

Kavya slapped his cheek, shutting him up for good. �You�re a creep. A loser. I�m going to punish you in any way I want, you just have to shut up and take it from me.� She adjusted her hair behind her head. �Speaking of which, that slap felt really good. Show me your face again.�

Manoj showed his cringed face to the girl. She took her hand back and brought it to his cheeks swiftly, delivering a nasty slap.

�That was beautiful!� Priya said. �Let me show you how to make it hurt even harder.� She took Kavya�s place and shouted down to the reject. �Hey, loser! Get up and take a slap from me!�

Manoj slowly sat himself up, his head shaking around with no idea of how he could possibly defend himself from the slaps. Priya brought all her fingers together tightly and showed her hand to Kavya. �Make your hand like a bat. Solid. No space between the fingers.� She then took her hand behind her head and brought it over to his cheek, nearly blowing it apart on impact.

�Wow.� Kavya said, clapping. �I will try to do that now.� She stood over Manoj, waited for him to get up and applied her newly learned slap technique, cutting into his skin with loud, devastating effect.

�Perfect!� Priya said. �The apprentice has beaten the master.�

�Thank you,� Kavya blushed. She then shook her hands. �My fingers almost hurt a bit from that slap.�

�It�s time to make him really sorry.� Priya said, grabbing Manoj�s neck and bringing him up to seat. �Hey, loser. Say you�re sorry.�

�I�m sorry,� Manoj said, joining his hands together.

�You�re finally saying it,� Kavya said.

�I mean it, Kavya. I�m so sorry I ever asked you out.�

Priya shook him under her grip. �How far are you willing to go to win her forgiveness?�

�I�ll do anything, Priya.�

�Good. Kavya, show him your ass.� Priya said.

�What? Why should this loser get to see my beautiful butt?� Kavya asked.

�He should get a real sense of how superior you are.� Priya said.

�Hmm. Didn�t think of that.� Kavya said. She raised her skirt and stood before Manoj, displaying her butt. �Look at that, you ugly loser. The ugliest part of my body is prettier than your stupid face!�

How pretty is my ass? How ugly is your face?

�Yeah, you�re nothing more than a butt-ugly dog. Except you�re uglier than a butt.� Priya said, catching the back of Manoj�s neck. She pushed him into the panty-clad buttocks of Kavya. �Smell that. Taste that beautiful pair of balls.� She pushed Manoj�s face so that his nose piloted into the core of her butt crack and the sweaty surface of her buttocks spread all over his face, smothering him completely. Manoj went in and shook his face around for a few seconds, then caught the girl�s thighs and tried to get out of it. �Nothing doing,� Priya said, pushing him inside even harder.

Manoj spent the next moments in the breathless vacu�m, breathing nothing but the air between her ass cheeks. He moved his face around, feeling the gorgeous shape with his face, but he needed some air to enjoy the privilege that few men could ever get. Priya pulled back his face just in time to prevent him from passing out. �I would normally let losers like you die behind her ass. But you are such a loser, even that would be too good a death for you.�

You don't even deserve to die here!

�Yeah,� Kavya said. She stepped back and caught the sides of her panties� cloth in her hands, then brought them down to her feet and took them off from under her shoes. She dangled the divine panties in her fingers and taunted Manoj with them. �You want to eat this, loser?�

Manoj joined his hands and shook his head.

�Then that�s exactly what you�ll eat.� Kavya said, stuffing the panties into Manoj�s mouth. �There�s some dirt between the threads, suck them into your soul because that�s the only meal you�re going to get.� Manoj choked on the panties as she stuffed them into his mouth. She was stretching the limits of his cheeks� flexibility and that of his throat with the forceful feed. �Good!� she said, once the panties were fully in his mouth.

Eat my panties for dinner!

�Now,� Kavya said, turning her back on him again. �I want you to ask out my ass.�

Manoj mumbled, and pointed to the panties stuffed in his mouth.

�Well, guess what?� Kavya said, bending forward. �There�s no point asking because you know the answer. You�re not good enough for my butt.�

�And you�ll never be,� Priya said, pushing Manoj�s face into Kavya�s ass, except this time, the buttocks were naked. He enjoyed the delightful scent and swam in the perfection of the girl�s butt crack for a few religious moments.

Kavya shook her butt left. �No.� She shook her butt right. �No way. A loser like you? Never!� She then twisted her butt round and round, smothering him in her crack.

Priya pulled him back after a few dozen smothering rounds. �Look at this guy. He looks like he�s just seen God.�

�That�s because he has!� Kavya said, flicking her butt with her forefingers. �To people like him, this is God!�

Delicious, ain't it?

�Yeah.� Priya said. �Take those panties off your mouth, loser.�

Manoj pulled out the panties from his throat, fully wet with his saliva.

�Ugh!! Throw it into the dustbin and buy me new ones.� Kavya said. �Hand me your wallet now.� Manoj frantically pulled out a brown leather wallet from his pants and handed them to her. �Good,� she said, checking the contents, �there is enough money for new panties.�

�Now what, Kavya?� Manoj asked.

�I want you out of my life. So far out, I shouldn�t even be able to see you.� Kavya said.

�Or, you have one more option.� Priya said, winking at Kavya. �You can live the rest of your life as Kavya�s dog.�

�Him? My dog?� Kavya asked, clenching her face�s muscles. �I would have to take him home and give him food and everything.�

�No,� Priya said. �Don�t give him anything. He gets no food, no clothes, no nothing! He�ll be your dog for the rest of HIS life, as long as HE�s alive. Trust me, I know which life he�ll choose.�

Manoj had a guilty look on his face as he glanced at the two beautiful women standing over him. �I can go out and live my life normally, as long as I forget about you completely?� Kavya nodded. �Or I can live my life as your dog, with no food or water or money?�

�Exactly. Which one is it?� Kavya smiled.

�Make me your dog Kavya,� Manoj said, leaping to Kavya�s sandals and giving them a kiss.

�See? I told you.� Priya laughed. �I know his type.�

�Alright, dog.� Kavya said. �I�m going to take you home.�

�Hey, you have a car, don�t you?� Priya asked, slapping Manoj�s head.

�Yes, I do.�

�Give her the keys!� Priya demanded. �What would a dog like you need a car for?�

�Here!� Manoj pulled out his car key and placed it in Kavya�s hand. �It�s yours for life.�

�No hesitation at all! That�s a good dog.� Kavya said, fiddling with the keys. �Let�s go to my place, then. You can massage my legs as I drive your car.�









Priya stepped into the dungeon with a clear sense of urgency. She left the door unclosed as she looked at me and two other slaves waiting in there for her orders. She caught one of their faces, turned him left and right, went �Hmmm,� and threw him back. With the other slave she did the same. She finally caught my face and nodded. �You! Come with me.�

My heart leaped with joy � she had finally selected me for something in my life! She walked out of the toilet and bolted the door close. I crawled aside to prevent from being trampled under her quick feet- not that that wouldn�t be enjoyable but she had some agenda that was causing the hurry and the last thing I�d want was to get in her way.

She darted across her living room and stepped out of her house. I followed her on all fours as quickly as I could, constantly keeping my head below the level of her knees. The bright world outside poked into my eyes, almost causing me to swoon right before the girl. She had thrown me into the dungeon four months back. I had never seen the light of day since that time, and as of the moment, I didn�t want to, either. Darkness was good, darkness was my life.

Priya walked over to her red sports car and unlocked the trunk. �Get in there, quick! And don�t ask me any questions.� I climbed into the little area and brought down my knees on the black, dusty mats. An overwhelming surge of dust particles went into my nose so I locked them with my fingers to prevent from sneezing in front of my Mistress. I closed my eyes, bent over and squeezed my head between my knees so she could close the boot of her car shut. She did, and there was darkness all over again. A dustier version of the darkness than I was used to, but good nevertheless.

Priya started her car and began to drive someplace. I kept myself alive with little breaths in the dusty void of her car. About ten minutes later, the car stopped and the trunk popped open. �Get out,� she ordered, �and come to my feet. You�re going to meet another Goddess like me today.� I crawled out quickly and knelt behind her as she closed the trunk We were in front of a big house, almost the size of Priya�s mansion. It felt like I was in front of a gigantic monument. She made her way to the gate and walked inside to ring the bell before the front door.

Kavya opened the door and greeted her with a hearty �Hello! So good to see you.� It was the very first time I laid my eyes on the beautiful friend of Priya�s and she was nearly as spectacular herself. The bright eyes, the perfect tall body, slender legs, always dressed in elegant clothes just like the Goddess. Even their names sounded similar; it was like they were both spawned from the same branch of heaven!

�Hi,� Priya said, hugging the female friend of hers. �I brought over one of my slaves,� she said, pointing to me. I gave her a short smile for a moment before bowing down and looking at her legs.

�Aww, that was so sweet of you.� Kavya said, approaching me. �What is this loser�s name?�

�Slave 31.� Priya said proudly.

�Oh my God. You don�t even remember their names, do you?� Kavya laughed.

�Who cares about a slave�s name?� Priya said. �I rename then once I take them into my custody.�

�With numbers no less.� Kavya said. �So, this is the thirty-first guy to ask you out?�

�No. Not at all.� Priya said. �He never ever asked me out. For years, he was my neighbor. Never spoke much, but kept staring at my legs. So one day we played a cards game,� the girls began to walk into the living room and I followed them. �The loser would have to become the winner�s slave.�

�And he lost of course?�

�No. He gave up.� Priya said. �I�ve had him for four months since. Think there�s around two or three more months left in him before I would have to replace him.�

�Cool! A born loser.� Kavya said. �My slave, in contrast, looks like he�s going to die today,� she pointed to Manoj who was kneeling down and waiting for her before the couch.

Two pathetic losers. Your loser and my loser.

The girls sat down on the couch, while I knelt next to Manoj. �Look at these two pathetic losers. Just kneeling down instead of worshiping our beautiful feet.� Kavya said.

I hastily went forward and picked up Priya�s bare feet, caught them in my hand and began to lick them and massage them. Manoj attempted to do the same for Kavya�s feet, only to get his face kicked off by her strong legs. �Haha!� she laughed. �That is your salary! Worship my feet the whole day and your payment is in kicks.�

�That was,� Priya began rubbing her chin, �not right.�

�What? Why?� Kavya asked, as Manoj recovered from the kick and came back to serve at her feet.

Start licking, losers!

�Watch how I do it.� Priya said. She stretched out her left leg and pushed my head into her left ankle using her right leg. �Observe carefully how I kick my slave,� she said, taking back her right leg and serving it hard to my face in the next microsecond. My nose took a hard pounding, but her merciless leg went back and came for a second landing, even harder and swifter than last. �You see?� she explained. �I trap him with my other leg when I kick him. That way, I don�t have to wait for him to get back from the floor.�

�Wow. That�s so clever.� Kavya sad. �Let me try that,� she said, trapping Manoj in her right leg and pounding his face with her left foot. �One.� The deadly legs went back and came forth. �Two.� She kept on going. �Three, Four�� until she reached �twelve,� by which time Manoj was bleeding uncontrollably through his nose.

�Yuck, what a hopeless slave.� Priya said. �Started to bleed at twelve. Worthless piece of dump is what he is.�

�Yeah,� Kavya said. �Let me try kicking your slave,� she said, gesturing towards me.

Which one of you is more resilient?

Priya let her feet down, freeing me for the task. �Sure, you can try him out.�

I crawled towards the other Goddess and picked up her feet to place them on my face. Kavya trapped me in her left ankle and began to pound my face hard with the bottom of her right foot. �One. Two.� Each time her heel landed on my face, it crushed into my skull and blew bits of my brain away from their place. �Twelve. Thirteen�� She was relentless and persistent, and her kicks were nearly as hard and ruthless as Priya�s. �Thirty Eight. Thirty Nine. Forty.� She said, dropping her feet to the ground. �Wow. You�ve got quite a resilient slave here.�

�I know.� Priya said, signaling for me to get back under her feet. �I think what your slave needs is a good blessing from you.�

�A blessing?�

�Yeah.� Priya said. �Sit on his back for a while. Let him get the energy from your bum into his worthless life.�

�Didn�t think of that.� Kavya said, stepping towards Manoj. �Get up, you dog! Let me sit on your back. Or are you too useless for that, too?�

�I�ll get up, Kavya.� Manoj said, getting on his hands and knees.

�Why can�t you be more like Priya�s slave there?� Kavya asked, kicking me with her knee. I couldn�t believe for the life of me that I was a role model to someone.

�I�ll try, Kavya.� Manoj said.

�You better.� Kavya said, letting her weight crush into the slave�s back.

�He�s taking your blessing alright.� Priya laughed. �Look at that bloody erection he�s getting now!� Kavya laughed with her, while I turned away, avoiding a peek at Manoj�s thing.

I'm going to bless only my slave.

�You know what we can do to test whether he�s getting blessed properly?� Priya asked, her eyes lit up with dazzling brilliance.

�What?� Kavya asked.

�We can put these slaves in a contest. My slave rides me around this room, your slave rides you. We�ll see which slave does more rounds before passing out.� Priya said.

�Like a horse race.� Kavya laughed. �Except it�s a slave race. Your slave versus my slave? Not much of a contest, but you�re on!�









�On your marks!� Kavya said, sitting on Manoj�s back. I was next to him, with my body parallel to his and my hands and knees approximately at the same straight line on the floor. Priya was seated on my back. �Get set!� My heart began to pound nervously, even though my competition was weak as a dog trying to carry a human on its back. �Go!� Kavya screamed.

I crawled forth, rapidly moving my hands and knees on the floor to transport Priya all around the beautiful living room. I turned back to see how Manoj was doing; he seemed to be stuck at the starting line himself. Priya flicked my head hard. �Hey idiot! Don�t look at him. Just concentrate and ride me as quickly as you can.� I shook myself and turned around at the corner of the glorious living room, then the other corner and one more. Soon, I could see Manoj right in front of me struggling to carry Kavya even a quarter of a round, whereas I had done one complete round. This was the easiest contest, ever.

As I tried to pass Kavya and her slave, a deadly kick came over me from nowhere and brought me down by surprise. I fell down and hit the floor, crash landing my owner Priya into an unexpected fall. �Hey!� Priya cried. �That was cheating. Kavya, how could you kick my slave?� There was a hint of a smile in her voice, she wasn�t serious about me being kicked at all.

�I know it�s cheating,� Kavya said. �But look at my pathetic slave. I had to do something to level the playing field.� She pointed to Manoj, who was trying to trudge forward on his hands and knees, carrying her on his back.

�Oh yeah.� Priya said. �You should probably give him some time to get used to it. He�ll improve.�

�I don�t know.� Kavya said, sounding concerned. �He wasn�t good enough to be my boyfriend, he wasn�t good enough to kiss my feet. It turns out, he isn�t even good enough to be my slave.�

Manoj gathered up some strength from nowhere and covered one round before I could recover from Kavya�s blow. I sat up and stayed on the spot, to give Manoj some sort of advantage which Priya presumably wanted. �You know what?� Priya said, getting off my back. �You can take this slave. He�s all yours.�

What? I couldn�t believe Priya was just giving me away so easily. What about me? Would I have to spend the rest of her life waiting at her friend�s feet? It wasn�t that the feet were any less prettier, but I felt a sense of belonging to my Goddess. Changing Goddesses wasn�t so easy, but I began to contemplate the inevitable as the beautiful Kavya approached me. She stood over me and knocked my head with her toes. �Hmm. Sturdy build.� She kicked my stomach hard. �Ooh. He needs to work on that area, get a harder stomach for me. But better than my stupid slave any day.�

Kavya then caught my neck and sat on my back. �Giddiyap!� she shouted. I began to ride Kavya on bruised hands and knees all around the living room and quickly brought her back to the starting point. �He�s faster, too. Why can�t you be like this slave?� she asked, spitting on Manoj as we rode past. We went for one more round, this time her elbows jabbed into my back. I struggled to move forth, but her elbows jabbed down on me again. Soon, I had almost no strength left. I barely reached Priya and the other slave before I fell down, completely tired.

�Nobody is that resilient, I guess.� Kavya laughed even as I dropped right next to Manoj. She shifted one knee onto the other slave and kept one on me. �Now that both of you are down, I�m going to ride both of you together. Come on, slaves.�

Manoj and I rose to our hands and knees together, elevating the divine Goddess off the floor. We began to move in sync, slowly riding her across the living room. There was no point hurrying at all, there was no race left to win. It was purely for the pleasure of the Goddess that we traversed the perimeter of the room.

�You still haven�t given me an answer.� Priya said.

�Which question?� Kavya asked.

�Do you want to keep my slave for yourself?� Priya asked.

�Oh,� Kavya said. My heart began to overdo the pumping. �I don�t think so,� she stated to my relief. �Because then I would have two slaves. What the hell am I going to do with two of them?�

�Exactly.� Priya said. �I have to keep killing them off when they get so numerous, you know? Like right now, two slaves are waiting for me back at home. So I need to kill off two among these three. You�re better off with just one slave.� Despite the talk of death, I felt a peace come over me. Living and dying for Priya was the only true purpose of my life.

�Yeah.� Kavya said, catching our heads in her hand as she rode us along. Soon, we both dropped from extreme exhausion.

�So,� Priya said. �Who won the slave ride race?�

�We won!� Kavya said, standing on my half-dead body. �We girls are the winners, these boys are the losers! Yay!� she began dancing on my body.

�Of course we did,� Priya jumped onto Manoj�s exhausted body. �Girls are the best!� she held Kavya�s hands in hers and the girls began to dance on our bodies, and all we could do was lick the floor as our bodies took a pounding from their feet.

The divine women giggled and rejoiced their strange victory. �You think it�s something people are born with?� Kavya asked.

�You mean winners and losers?� Priya asked. �Of course. It�s not so much about whether you go out and achieve something, it�s always within you. It�s an attitude of unconditional love for oneself.�

�That sounds like one of those self-help books,� Kavya laughed.

�Who cares? We�re winners!� Priya gazed into Kavya�s eyes as they danced on me and the other slave. She bent towards the girl and kissed her lips. �Hmmm!� she said.

Kavya blushed and laughed a bit. �You just kissed me right now.�

�I know.� Priya said. �I just felt like doing it.�

�Me too, actually.� Kavya confessed. �How is that okay? You have an awesome boyfriend and so do I.�

�Hey, we�re two beautiful, straight women. Let�s not make a big deal about it. We shared a victory kiss and that�s all it was.� Priya said. I tried to turn back and look up, to see if they�d kiss again but Kavya�s feet stepped onto my head and covered my eyes.

�Let�s punish these losers just for being the losers they are.�









�It�s a good thing you chose to become my dog,� Kavya said, clasping Manoj�s cheeks in her hands. �I don�t imply that you�re doing well or any such thing. But the thought of you ever becoming my boyfriend makes me laugh. The thought of you succeeding someday as my dog, doesn�t sound nearly as impossible. You just have a very long way to go.�

�Thank you, Kavya.� Manoj said, leaping to her feet and worshiping them. �I will do everything in my power to become a good dog for you.�

�And I bless you in that endeavor.� Kavya said. �Here, show me your face so I can spit on you.� Manoj looked up to her and closed his eyes as she gathered up a ball of saliva in her mouth and spat on his face. �There you go- that�s your blessing.�

�Thank you so much, Goddess.� Manoj crawled back to kneel next to me, with thick viscous saliva spreading into a film over his bruised face.

�That was one good blessing.� Priya said, observing her apprentice dealing with the defeated man. �You know, I have lots of rules about how rejects and slaves and other inferior beings like these two should behave in front of us. Your slave isn�t obeying any of those.�

�What are your rules?� Kavya asked.

�Look at how my slave keeps his head down below the level of my knees.� Priya pointed to me. �Your slave doesn�t.�

Your head below my knee level!

�So rude of you!� Kavya shouted at Manoj. �How dare you keep your head so high?�

�That�s not even the worst part.� Priya said. �My slaves aren�t allowed to talk to me. Not even �thank you�.�

�Grrr�� Kavya said, shifting over to the other side and delivering a hard kick to Manoj�s head. �Stupid dog. When will you stop being disrespectful to me?�

�And you,� Priya kicked my shoulder. �You�re a loser. Why can�t you teach him how to be a loser?�

The brutal kicks began to rain one after the other, piercing our shameful naked bodies until we were both on the floor tasting the dusty matted floor with our tongues. �You know what? Both of you are sentenced to one hundred whip cracks from us.�

A hundred lashes from her whip, for not being a good sample slave to Priya and her friend.

�Keep your ugly heads on the floor,� Priya said, �and spread out those hands.� Manoj and I obeyed despite the burning pain. �Because we are going to offer you a way to decrease the sentence.� Priya stepped over my body and planted her legs on both sides. �You are both going to do push-ups for us, right here. We may even sit on your backs while you do that. The more push-ups you do, the fewer whip cracks you both would have to suffer. Each push-up exempts you from two beatings. Is that understood?�

I nodded, and so did the other slave. �Good, then. Start now, slaves.� A look at the sharp whip in her hands filled me with fear. I pushed the ground away from myself, then bent my elbows. �One,� she counted. I went on with the push-ups until I reached 25. My hands began to twist and flail on the path as it had exerted every molecule in them to their very highest limit. Just then, the cold whip touched my skin. I went for a couple more before dropping to the ground exhausted.

The other slave had done worse than me, I was sure, but I had no chance of looking that way or keeping my eyes open. �Useless slaves.� Kavya said, sitting down on Manoj and raising the whip. �Eat this, you reject!� She unleashed her power on him, cutting into his back and making him flinch under, helpless and exhausted. Priya�s weapon landed on my back with even more crushing force and proximity, vibrating my very existence with the unbearable, cold whip. The girls went on whipping us, without keeping a count of how many push-ups we did complete. That was simply a ploy to decrease our resistance to the thing they were doing then, whipping us until they saw our blood and felt happy.

The whip cracks began to roll their way into my spine, and my crushed soul could do nothing in resistance but smile. The Goddess must have her way, even if I died from the pain.

�Look at my slave,� Kavya said, pointing at Manoj. �He looks entirely dead to me.�

�Hey, you!� Priya said, kicking my head up. �Go check his pulse.� I stretched out my hand in the other slave�s direction and just reached his neck. I nodded, there was a pulse.

�He�s probably just passed out.� Kavya said.









Kavya stood over her unconscious reject. She tapped his face with her feet. �Hey Manoj! Wake up.� Manoj continued to breathe heavily, his body lying on the floor with no hint of movement. She rubbed the bottoms of her feet on his face.

�I think I know how to wake up rejects like you.� Kavya said, bending her knees and bringing her butt over his face. She piloted her clean buttocks over him and spread their sweaty skin all over, trapping and crushing him in their divine scent. �Wake up, loser. It�s true, you are, very much in heaven.�

Manoj was aroused by her perfect, smooth naked skin and the beauty of what was touching him, even though he could see nothing. He went for a little kiss, spreading his lips randomly in the blissful darkness.

�You are awake now, aren�t you?� Kavya laughed.

�Yes?� Manoj replied, nervous that the moments would end.

�Now, how awake are you?� Kavya asked.

�I feel very good, Kavya. I don�t think I need sleep for many more hours. Thank you for asking.�

�Hey, I don�t care about you.� Kavya said. �I just need you to be awake for the last part of your rejection.�

�Oh, no. We�re still on that?�

�Of course we�re still on that. You stalked me and you wanted to break me up with my boyfriend. Do you still expect me to get past that so easily?�

�I�m living as your slave, Kavya. You whipped me so hard and made me unconscious. Isn�t that revenge enough?�

�No it�s not.� Kavya said. �But like I said, it�s� the last step I have left for you to win my forgiveness. Do this, and you can spend the rest of your live being my slave. Just like that slave Priya brought over. No more punishment.�

�What is this last task, Kavya?� Manoj asked, kissing her ass.

�Well. My boyfriend is coming over in a few minutes.� Kavya said. �And we are going to do it on my bed.�

�That�s good for you?�

�It�s marvelous for me. You, on the other hand, not so much. Because I�m going to tie you and gag you and throw you under my bed.� Kavya sat herself down on his face. �You�ll spend the whole night just listening to me screaming with joy, while you have to fend off a bunch of spiders and cobwebs under my bed with tied hands.�

�So that�s your plan. You beat me up and hurt me physically, and now you want to torment me psychologically.�

�Exactly.� Kavya stood up, turned around and sat down on his face again. �For now, I want you to lick my pussy. And really get in there.� Kavya said, shaking herself on her slave�s face. �Do you have a tongue or not?�

�I do, I do.�

�Then fuckin� use it! Let me feel it deep inside my cunt. Go on, get in there.� Kavya said. Manoj stuck up his tongue and went into the girl�s beautiful ass. �Something like that. Make my pussy ready for action.�

Kavya bounced her ass cheeks up and down his face and moaned as she forcing her reject�s tongue into the valley of her smooth, clean pussy.

�A real man like Rohan would get to push his penis into that. But losers like you only get to do it with you tongue.�

Manoj silently enjoyed the intended punishment with an eager tongue and closed, obedient eyes.

She then rubbed herself on his tongue for the finish, stood up and walked away.

�What�s going on, Kavya?�

�Time for you to go under my bed.� Kavya said, returning to the scene with ropes. With expert precision and practiced efficiency, she bound the reject�s hands together.

�That is too tight, Kavya. I can�t feel my hands.� Manoj cried.

�Well, it isn�t tight enough to shut you up,� Kavya said, grabbing the ends of the ropes and going for a tighter knot, squeezing tears out of his eyes. She then bound the legs together in an equally tight hellacious knot.

�You like to sniff girl�s panties, loser?� Kavya asked, dangling her pair in her hand. Manoj didn�t answer. �In that case, I�ll just stuff this into your mouth,� and she did.

Manoj twisted around, making no noise as he rolled left and right on the floor. Kavya kicked him into her bedroom and pushed him under her bed. �And stay there.�

Minutes later, the doorbell rang. Rohan was upstairs in a jiffy, undressing himself and pleasuring Kavya with his massive erection. Manoj stared at the undersides of her bed, helpless as he listened to her enjoying consecutive orgasms.
