Western Justice-

�By Dungeon Master

Marshal Dillon was sitting in his Dodge City office gazing over some wanted
posters when kindly, but cranky old Doc Adams moseyed in the front door.

&quot;Hey Doc. How�s it going?�

�Busy mornin� Matt,� Doc replied, shaking his
head while taking a seat
across from the rugged lawman�s desk. �Had go out to
the Schrader place this
morning to help deliver a calf. The mother and daughter are doin�
just
fine,� he said with a pleasant voice and a slight nod of the head.

�Glad ta hear that Doc...I�m
sure they were in good hands,� Matt
complimented his friend with a smile.


&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &quot;
&quot;What's on your mind?� Matt continued while shuffling the posters.

&quot;Well, dag nabit, it's noontime and I was thinking about headin�
over to
Delmonicos for some lunch. Wanna
come along?�

�Sounds like a mighty fine idea. As soon as Festus returns from his rounds,
I�ll join ya.�

Just as he said that, the deputy burst in the front door with a wild-eyed
look.&quot;Mr. Dillon, Mr. Dillon!&quot;

�Slow down. What is it Festus?�

&quot;Miss Kitty needs you over at the Long Branch!&quot;

&quot;Why ...has somebody been shot?�

&quot;No,&quot; Festus replied.

�Is there a fight Festus?�

&quot;No, Mr. Dillon!�

&quot;Then what in thunder is it?�

�I don�t know...Miss Kitty just said ta come an� git ya.�

Matt rolled his eyes as his deputy�s non-information.

&quot;Can't you get anything straight?� Doc asked in a clearly exasperated
voice.



�Listen you old coot...,&quot; Festus sneered.

&quot;Alright, sorry Doc. I guess I better go see
what�s eatin� the lady,&quot; Matt
said in a calm but irritated voice as he rose from his chair. �Maybe ya
better come along. I might need ya.�

Doc and Festus took turns needling each other as the three gents walked
along the buckboard down to the Long Branch saloon. When they entered, the
red haired Kitty Russell immediately greeted the trio.

&quot;Matt ...I've got a problem with one of my newly hired girls. I caught her
red-handed stealing money out of the cash register.&quot;

&quot;You saw her take the money?!&quot; Matt pressed.

�Yes Matt... just hired her last week... seemed so
sweet.�

�Well I'll be!� Festus said with raised eyebrows.

�Can�t trust anybody these days,� Doc replied while shaking his head.

�I'll take her in if you want to press charges Kitty, but where is she now?�
asked Matt in a serious tone.

�I've got her in my office.�

�Let's go talk to her.�

The four of them entered the proprietor�s office where the accused thief
nervously sat. Matt Dillon looked at her sternly. �Is what Miss Russell is
saying true? Did ya take money outa
the register?�

The dark haired miss clasped her hands together and looked down. �I�m just a
poor girl from Missouri,� she replied rapidly.

�But Miss Russell would pay you a fair wage. Ya don�t
need to steal from
her. Now you did take the money, didn�t you?�

Her eyes widened and tears streamed down her cheeks.

�How old are you young lady?�

�Nineteen sir.�

�Well at least she�s polite,� Doc snorted.

�Is this your first time away from home?� Matt inquired sympathetically.

�Yes sir,� she sniveled.

�But that�s no reason to steal young lady,&quot; Marshal Dillon lectured. �If
Miss Russell here wants to press charges I�ll have to take ya
in.�



�To jail! Oh!... Please no!� the terrified young lady
blurted as she rose
from her seat and backed against a wall.

Matt got a puzzled look on his face, trying to decide what to do about this
petty thief. He looked at Doc.

&quot;Well dadburnit,&quot;Doc chimed in. � I know what I�d do!�

&quot;What's that you old buzzard?&quot; Festus scowled.

&quot;Well by Golly, where I came from...anybody caught stealin�
like this would
get a whoopin!�

They all looked at Doc, quizzically. Kitty snickered .
Matt kind of smirked.
The young lady�s eyes got as big as saucers.

Matt gazed at Miss Kitty. �If I spank this little thief, will you drop the
charges?�

�Yes Matt.�

�Very well then. It�s either that or jail,� Matt
declared authoritatively as
he returned his gaze toward the nervous young lady.

�You can't spank me!� She protested as she protectively placed both hands on
her bottom cheeks through her dancehall dress.

�It's your choice young lady,� Marshall Dillon offered evenly.

She looked around the room at these strange faces, then
returned her
attention to the Marshall. Tears fell. &nbsp;�I don't want to go to jail!� She
sniveled.

�Then lean over Miss Kitty�s desk and let�s get this over with.�

Slowly the dark haired dance hall girl nervously plodded toward the wooden
desk and hesitated when she stood in front of it. Feeling trapped, she
daintily bent from the waist so that her ample cleavage pressed onto the top
of the desk with her feet on the floor.

�Matt!� Doc interrupted. The marshal�s attention was temporarily drawn away
from the skirted bottom as he looked at Doc Adams. �Where I come from,
spankings are given on the bare!�

Matt looked at Kitty, who nodded, and then back to the covered bottom. The
decision was made.

&quot;Raise your skirt young lady!� Marshall Dillon ordered in an official
tone.



�Nooo!� Marcy protested and
jumped to her feet.

Losing patience with her Matt looked at his deputy. �Okay Festus put the
cuffs on her. I�m takin� her in.�

Before the deputy took two steps she changed her tune. �Okay! okay!�.
Turning back around quickly, she obeyed the Marshall�s order, and soon a
shapely pair of legs and thighs appeared as well as her white cotton
panties. Doc declared he was getting too old for this, as he wiped his brow
with a handkerchief. Festus whistled. The Marshall remained stoic.

�Panties down!� Matt ordered sternly. The mournful miss dared not protest
again, but she was extremely embarrassed to say the least to be bare butt
naked in front of these strangers.

As he gazed intently at the sweet, soft derriere of this dance hall girl,
Matt took off his thick belt and told Doc and Festus to secure her arms.
Doubling the leather, the fair minded but resolute lawman raised his arm and
swiftly delivered a stiff swat in the center of her upturned buttocks. She
yelped and yanked on her arms but the two men held her. Again he brought the
heavy belt down as he lectured her. �This will teach you about stealin!�

The now yelping thief protested loudly as the determined lawman brought the
belt down repeatedly, making snapping contact with his intended target each
time. Up, down, left and right he thwaped her
jiggling, ever-reddening rear.

A winded Marshall Dillon then looked at Kitty. �Did she give back the
money?�

�Yes Matt, I've got it back.�

�Do you think she�s learned her lesson?�

Kitty walked over to where the young lady laid in agony and cupped her palm
under the young woman�s chin. �Are you truly sorry?�

�Yes ma�am!� she sobbed.

�All right guys let her up,� the Marshal declared. �I won't take you to jail
this time miss, but if it happens again, I will take you in.�

�Yes sir,� she sniffed.



&quot;Doc, I�m ready for that lunch now.�

*********************

Later on that evening...

Miss Kitty and Matt Dillon are at his ranch.

�Oh Matt, I was so jealous today when you were spanking Marcy...I know you
couldn�t tell, but I was,� she says with her arms around her man�s neck.

�Well by golly woman, I can remedy that in a hurry!� he smiled lasciviously
as he lowered his hands and gave her a swift swat to
her covered derriere.

With a crooked smile, she looked into his smiling eyes. �Got more of that,
big man?�

�Bare that bottom and I�ll show you.�

�Yes Sir.�

Thus ended another day in ol� Dodge City.
