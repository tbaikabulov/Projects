A Beer or Two Won't Hurt

Synopsis: Traveling across country, Tim stops at a small hotel and decides to have a beer or two at the tavern before checking in. He makes a new friend. This is an old story of mine I thought I might as well share.Tim had been driving for a long time that day. He had gotten a very early
  start (for him) and it was now almost dark. He was having trouble keeping his
  eyes open. He thought he would need to start looking for a hotel. He was a
  little worried that it might take a while since he was going through an area
  with few larger towns, but he had hardly started looking when he saw a little
  old fashioned looking motel to his right. It was small but didn't look in too
  bad repair. The sign bragged that they had television and air conditioning
  in all rooms. Tim figured it would be cheap and as long as it had clean sheets
  and there weren't bugs he didn't care where he slept. He pulled into the large
  gravel parking lot shared by the hotel and the tavern next door. He parked
  near the office. The red sign said &quot;Vacancies&quot;, though only &quot;cancies&quot; still
  lit up. There were only 2 cars there and maybe 10 rooms. Tim looked over at
  the bar. It was a small white wooden building overlooked by 3 large silos.
  There were 2 rusty pickups parked by the door under a Pabst Blue Ribbon sign.
  It certainly looked like a redneck type of bar. Being kind of shy, Tim was
  always a little leery of going into strange bars. He wasn't a big guy, standing
  only about 5' 7&quot; and he was kind of thin. He had found trouble enough
  in the bars around college, let alone a dive bar in the middle of nowhere,
  but he wanted a beer. He figured it would be safe enough, probably a couple
  of farmers at the bar watching a ball game. He would keep to himself and nobody
  would notice him. He decided to go in for a beer or two before checking in
  at the motel. If it seemed okay, he might come back for a couple more later. 
Inside the place looked about as he imagined. It was dim. There was little
  decoration, but a few neon beer lights adorned the walls. A bar ran down the
  left side with 8 tall barstools. There was a TV in the left corner of the room
  with a ball game on, though the sound was down. A jukebox was to the right
  playing an old country song. There was a little open space behind the barstools,
  then 2 tables with chairs, then a pool table. The bathrooms were on the back
  wall. Another door led out from behind the bar, probably to a storage room.
  There were 2 guys sitting by each other at the bar. One looked about 40, the
  other in his late fifties. They looked up when he walked in. They didn't look
  especially friendly, but didn't look threatening either. Tim left 2 empty stools
  between them and him and took a seat at the bar. He was relieved to see they
  had Miller on draft as well as the PBR. He ordered a Miller draft. The bartender
  asked to see his ID. Tim showed him his license and the bartender got him a
  giant looking frosted mug. It was only a dollar fifty. Tim gave him 2 dollars
  and the bartender set 2 quarters on the bar. Tim left them there. The farmers
  and the bartender went back to their conversation about the weather or tractors
  or whatever (Tim couldn't care less). Tim took a large swig and started to
  relax. This wasn't so bad. The beer tasted great. A warm beer in a plastic
  cup would have cost him twice that in the places he was used to. Before he
  knew it the mug was empty. He sat there a moment staring at the empty mug,
  thinking he needed to go check in, then asked the bartender for another. He
  was a little surprised that the bartender took his empty mug and put it in
  a sink then filled him a fresh frosted mug. One of the farmers got up and left.
  This just gets better, Tim thought. He had a feeling he might be spending quite
  a bit of the night over here after all. He took a small sip, determined to
  make this one last a little longer. 
When he first heard the rumbling he thought, �that guy needs a new muffler
  for his truck.' When it got a little louder he realized it was something else,
  the sound of several motorcycles. He still had most of his beer left when the
  bikers started coming into the bar. Two men entered first, big guys with old
  jeans, Harley shirts, leather jackets, and beards. Then a stream of them entered,
  all talking at once, mostly men, but a few women too. Soon the bar seemed packed
  with bikers and noise. Tim couldn't believe the change that had happened. The
  tables were now full. Men pounded on the bar, everyone wanting drinks. The
  jukebox started putting out old hard rock music, which they had the nervous
  bartender turn up. A pool game started. There was a line at the bathroom. Smell
  of dirt and sweat. A huge tattooed man sat to Tim's left, cramping Tim over.
  Tim wanted to go suddenly, but didn't want to run out on a full beer. He started
  to drink quicker, thinking he would finish it and then saunter out as if nothing
  out of the ordinary was going on. Two women came out of the bathroom and sat
  in the two stools to his right. He tried not to even look at them, fearing
  that even a glance might get a boyfriend jealous enough to knife him or something,
  but he couldn't help himself. They were really sexy looking. All skin tight
  jeans, knee-high leather boots, bare midriff, slutty makeup, lots of cleavage.
  The exact type of woman Tim was attracted to, but knew he could never have.
  They both looked to be about thirty. They sat talking to each other, not paying
  any attention to Tim. Several people came up right behind Tim, yelling at the
  bartender for drinks. Tim finished his beer and turned in the stool to get
  up. 
He found his way blocked by the huge bikers who were standing directly behind
  him. There were two men and a woman waiting for the drinks they had just ordered.
  He wanted to stand and just squeeze between them, but they didn't make it possible.
  He could only turn around partway and they were right up against him with no
  room at all between them. They didn't step out of his way. Tim cleared his
  throat and said nervously, &quot;Umm, excuse me.&quot; They didn't move at
  all, they just continued their loud conversation. They may not have even heard
  him. The bartender was setting up the drinks on the bar. Tim's leg was pressed
  up against the woman to his left who stood between him and the front of the
  tavern. She was a huge woman, bigger than most of the men in the bar, somewhat
  overweight, but very solid looking. She looked like she was in her mid 40's
  with a stern face, medium length hair that was black streaked with a little
  gray. She wore tight worn blue jeans and a new black Harley T-shirt stretched
  very tight across her large breasts. The men she was talking with were two
  of the toughest looking men Tim had ever seen, but she looked even tougher.
  Tim cleared his throat and tried again. �Excuse me,� he said a little louder �I
  need out.� 
The woman looked him over, seeming amused. �Going someplace?� she asked. 
�Uh, yeah, I need to get going.� Tim stammered. 
�Oh, come on. Stick around a while. The party's just getting started.� Without
  waiting for Tim to answer she turned toward the bartender. �Hey, get my friend
  here another beer� and a shot,� she said as she clamped her hand down on Tim's
  thigh. 
�I really should be going.� Tim tried to say but she ignored him. She turned
  his stool back towards the bar. The bartender had finished pouring the shots
  she had ordered before and went to get Tim's beer and shot. She reached around
  Tim to grab two shots off the bar and pass them to her friends. As she did
  her breasts pressed firmly against Tim's shoulder. Tim tried to back away,
  but the woman on the stool to his right was so close he was only able to move
  a little before he was shoulder to shoulder with her. She shot him an annoyed
  look. When the other woman reached back in for her shot, her breasts pushed
  even harder against Tim and there was no more room for him to move. Tim was
  embarrassed, but also a little turned on. The group drank their first shot
  and she traded the empty glasses for the other round still on the bar, again
  rubbing her breasts against Tim. By this time the bartender had returned with
  another beer and Tim's shot. She dropped some money on the bar and took her
  shot in her left hand. She pushed her way in and the man on the left moved
  his stool over to give her room to squeeze in next to Tim. 
�Bottom's up,� she said lifting her glass in a gesture to Tim. Tim was getting
  very nervous and wanted out more than ever, but didn't want to offend the bikers.
  He lifted the shot and smiled weakly at her. They drank the shots at the same
  time. Tim made a face and chased his with his beer. She just watched him smiling. �My
  name's Gail,� she said. 
�I'm Tim,� he replied after a little pause. She didn't say anything for a
  while and Tim took a few more drinks of his beer, not looking back at her.
  He felt uncomfortable with the way she was looking at him and he was very conscious
  of her breast still resting against his left shoulder. When he did look back
  over at her he saw that she was staring down right at his crotch. She let her
  gaze linger there, then looked up to meet his eyes. She had a mischievous smile
  on her face. �Uh-oh,� Tim thought, �she really is coming on to me.� He had
  been getting that feeling, but didn't really believe it since she was so much
  older than he, and so much bigger too. He was sometimes attracted to tall women,
  but it seemed to him that they always were attracted to men as tall as they
  were. He also had the older woman fantasy, like most guys, but it was always
  a really classy older woman in his fantasy. Gail wasn't the type of woman he
  was looking for at all. He liked really feminine looking women, usually on
  the slutty side. He liked short skirts, cleavage, and lots of makeup. Gail
  wasn't that type. She did have big breasts, but otherwise there wasn't much
  feminine about her. She may be a slut in practice, but didn't dress like a
  slut really. He was a little flattered, but mostly afraid. He picked up his
  beer and took a couple of swigs. It was now half gone. He thought he would
  be able to finish it quickly and get the hell out of here before things got
  any worse. As if she knew what he was thinking, just then she ordered herself
  and him another shot. �No really, you shouldn't get me another.� Tim protested. 
�That's okay. I insist.� she said, �You can get the next ones.� Tim tried
  to turn in his stool to get up again, but Gail put her right hand down firmly
  on his thigh and held him in place. He could feel the strength of her grip
  as he struggled to turn. She squeezed hard enough to hurt a little and he wasn't
  able to turn himself. He stopped struggling and picked up his beer again. Gail
  smiled at him and relaxed her grip, but still let her hand rest on his thigh,
  uncomfortably close to his crotch. In spite of himself, he was starting to
  get a little turned on. He had enjoyed the way her breast felt rubbing against
  him. Her hand resting on his bare thigh gave him a nervous thrill. Soon the
  bartender was back with two more shots. They drank the other shots of whiskey
  and Tim chased his with his beer again, which was now almost gone. 
The two women who were sitting next to Tim got up and went to the restroom.
  One of Gail's friends took the seat next to Tim. He pushed the chair back some
  and sat turned so that he could talk with the other friend who still stood
  directly behind Tim, who was now right between the three of them, and more
  nervous than ever. Gail had taken her hand off of his thigh, but now her arm
  was around his waist. It made him feel trapped. �It feels good to relax a while,� the
  guy sitting said, �We rode a long way today.� 
�Yeah, I'm a little tired,� said the other biker, stretching his back. 
�I like a long ride like that�� put in Gail, �it gets me horny.� Her friends
  both laughed, but Tim blushed and looked down. The shots arrived and they drank
  them down. Tim was beginning to feel a good buzz after 3 beers and 2 shots
  in so short a time. Though he liked to drink beer, he rarely drank hard liquor
  because he couldn't handle it well. He always got too drunk too fast. Tim tried
  again to excuse himself muttering he needed to get going. 
The biker sitting next to Tim said, �When a lady buys you a drink, it's only
  polite to return the favor. You aren't going to be rude, are you?� He said
  it mildly enough, but Tim could sense an underlying menace coming from him. 
�Uh, no, of course not,� Tim stammered, �I'll gladly buy her whatever she
  wants, I just don't need anymore now. I'll pay for her drinks and get going.� He
  was still hoping to get out of there. He really didn't mind paying for her
  drinks, at this point he would gladly give them everything in his wallet to
  get out of there (most of his money was still hidden in his car anyway). 
Gail laughed, �You have to drink with me or it doesn't count,� she said, �but
  that's okay, I'm good right now too. We'll hang around a while and have another
  round later.� Tim realized he wasn't getting anywhere by arguing so he just
  kept quiet. The two women who had been sitting at the bar before had come out
  of the ladies room and were dancing with each other in the middle of the bar. �Let's
  dance,� Gail said, �that will work up our thirsts.� 
�Oh, no thanks.� Tim tried to say as she grabbed his hands and pulled him
  off the stool. �I'm not really much of a dancer,� he continued as she effortlessly
  dragged him to the middle of the room. He was amazed at her size and strength.
  She hadn't even seemed to notice that he was struggling not to come with her.
  The other two dancers made some room smiling at Tim and Gail. Gail held on
  to his hands and began dancing, simply but with good rhythm. When Tim began
  to dance as well and she thought he wasn't going to try to run off she released
  his hands. Now that he was standing he realized just how big Gail really was.
  He came up to her shoulders and his face was even with her breasts. People
  were watching them and he felt embarrassed. He hadn't been lying. Though he
  enjoyed it, he really wasn't much of a dancer. Tim did his best however and
  Gail didn't seem to mind. By the end of the song, he was relaxing a little.
  He scanned the room and although there were lots of guys ringed around them,
  nobody seemed to be paying attention to them anymore. He stole a glance at
  the two girls dancing next to him, who were dancing very seductively. There
  wasn't much room for dancing and they occasionally bumped up against him. He
  was feeling the drinks even more and began to let go and get more into dancing
  as the next song began. He looked back to Gail and found that he was staring
  right into her bouncing tits, which were at his eye level. He looked up at
  her face and she smiled at him. Just then a big heavyset guy barged through
  on his way to the bathroom. His shoulder pushed Tim right into Gail and he
  continued on without even looking back. Tim's face was shoved right into Gail's
  breasts for a few seconds. When the guy had passed, Tim pushed himself back
  from her chest blushing and stammering an apology. 
�That's okay,� Gail said still smiling. They kept dancing for the rest of
  the song. Gail kept dancing closer and closer to Tim, so that her breasts were
  very close to his face. He tried to back up some, but the guys behind him didn't
  give him much room. He kept staring into her huge tits and was getting turned
  on. He had liked the way they felt against his face and with his beer goggles
  on Gail was starting to look a little better to him. He was starting to think
  that maybe this wasn't so bad after all. He was probably not being fair to
  the bikers. They were probably just normal people out for some fun who just
  happened to like to ride motorcycles. That didn't make them a gang or anything.
  If they weren't dangerous there was no reason for him not to just try and have
  some fun. He didn't know anyone around here, so even if Gail wasn't that great
  looking, nobody he knew would ever find out about it. Why not go along with
  her? He watched her tits bounce, remembering how they felt against his face
  and his shoulder before and he started getting a hard-on. Gail stepped a little
  closer so they were almost touching his face again and he looked up into her
  eyes. This time he returned her smile. Then she stuck out her chest and slowly
  rubbed one tit across his face, and then the other. He didn't try to pull away,
  just enjoyed the feeling. Somebody whistled, and he was a little embarrassed
  again, but tried to ignore it. She backed up a little and winked at him. He
  smiled and looked down. 
�Come on,� she said taking him by the hand, �I'm about ready for that drink
  now.� Tim followed her to the bar. Gail's two friends were sitting at their
  seats, but one of them got up when Gail and Tim approached. Tim got out his
  wallet and stood at the bar to order. He jumped a little when Gail grabbed
  his butt and squeezed. She leaned down and whispered in his ear, her breasts
  rubbing against his back again, �You order for us, I'll be right back.� She
  went to the restroom and Tim ordered 2 beers and 4 shots of whiskey while she
  was gone. Gail's friends watched Tim silently as he waited for the drinks.
  Somehow he didn't feel as threatened by them now. One of them told him to go
  ahead and sit down. Tim sat back on the barstool and waited. 
The drinks had arrived by the time Gail returned. Again, she squeezed in to
  stand beside him, though she seemed even closer than before. Her tit rested
  against his left shoulder. They did the first shot. It went down easier for
  Tim than the other two had. Then they sipped at the beers and talked a little.
  Tim told her about how he was driving to California where he had a summer job
  waiting working for his aunt. He was going back to college for his fourth year
  after that. Gail kept rubbing her tit against Tim's shoulder as they talked
  and occasionally looked down at his crotch. He was getting an erection again
  and he wondered if she could tell. 
Then Gail pulled out a cigarette. �Got a light?� she asked. Without waiting
  for an answer, she rubbed her left hand over where the pockets of his shorts
  were, feeling for a lighter. She felt his erection, which of course she had
  noticed, and reached her hand in his pocket and grabbed it. �Oh,� she said
  in mock surprise, �I guess that isn't a lighter,� and laughed. Her friends
  laughed too and Tim found himself blushing again. The guy behind Tim gave her
  a light still laughing. Tim was insulted, while not especially well-hung, he
  was bigger than a lighter anyway. He was also embarrassed that she had grabbed
  him that way, and that he was hard. �Oh lighten up,� Gail said, �I'm just teasing.� She
  put her hand on his thigh and began rubbing up and down, closer and closer
  to his crotch. After she had smoked her cigarette they drank the other shot
  and finished the beers. Tim had pretty much decided he was going to go for
  it and have sex with Gail if that was what she wanted. He was drunk and turned
  on enough not to care much what she looked like. He had a rubber in his wallet
  that he hadn't really expected to use. He had only gotten lucky at school twice
  in three years. He was usually too shy. He was hoping for better luck when
  he got to California. So, when Gail started pulling him out onto the �dance
  floor� again, he didn't even try to resist. 
They started dancing again and Tim was having fun. He paid no attention to
  the other people in the bar. The third song turned out to be a slow song and
  Gail pulled him in close to her. His face rested right against her tits as
  they swayed. He imagined he looked foolish, but was beyond caring now. His
  cock swelled again. They danced that way for the whole song, then another fast
  song played. The two girls started dancing again on this one. They danced even
  sexier than before and Tim kept watching them out of the corner of his eye.
  They were playing up to the guys around them, rubbing up against them as they
  danced. Tim saw a guy pinch one girl's ass and she just turned her head and
  winked at him over her shoulder. Then the other girl lifted up her shirt partway,
  exposing one of her tits for a moment. Someone whistled. A few moments later
  the first girl lifted her shirt as well, flashing both her tits. Tim openly
  stared this time with a smile on his face. �You like that?� Gail asked Tim. 
�Oh yeah,� he answered. 
�So you approve of a little public nudity, huh?� she said smiling. 
�Sure, what guy doesn't?� Tim said. 
�Good,� Gail said and she grabbed onto Tim's shorts and yanked them down to
  his knees. His underwear came partway down and his cock poked out too. He grabbed
  onto his underwear with one hand and pulled them back up quickly. He tried
  to grab his shorts with his other hand, but missed. Gail pulled them down all
  the way to his ankles. When Tim tried to reach down he lost his balance and
  fell on his butt. Gail soon had his shorts all the way off and she tossed them
  to one of the girls who held them up. Everyone was laughing. Gail grabbed onto
  Tim's shirt and pulled him to his feet. He fought to hold onto it, but Gail
  pulled his shirt over his head and after a brief struggle had it off him as
  well. She handed it to the other girl who pulled off her own shirt, then put
  Tim's on in its place. There was more laughter and whistling. Tim was embarrassed
  and angry, as well as afraid again. He looked around, but didn't see the girl
  with his shorts. The other one wearing his shirt was looking him up and down
  smiling. Tim wished he hadn't worn the skimpy bikini underwear he had on. He
  had gotten them as a gift once and had never really felt comfortable in them.
  His cock was very visible in its partially erect state. He tried to cover his
  crotch with his hands. 
�Give me my shorts back!� Tim demanded, looking up at Gail. 
Gail just laughed and said, �I don't even have them anymore.� 
�I mean it I want them back now!� he said again. 
�You're so cute when you're angry,� she said tickling his ribs. 
�My car keys and my wallet are in those.� The girl who had taken the shorts
  came back up empty handed. �What did you do with my shorts?� he said to her. 
�They're safe,� she said laughing. 
�I want them back now!� he demanded loudly stepping toward her. Two large
  men stepped between them and gave him a look that made him cringe back. He
  was back to being more scared than angry. 
�Relax,� Gail said, �we're just having a little fun. I'll make sure to get
  everything back for you if you just play along. Nobody's going to rip you off,
  I just had to see that cute little body of yours.� She reached out again and
  snapped at the waistband of his underwear. Tim tried to back away, but was
  surrounded by a ring of people. Gail grabbed his hands and said, �Come on,
  let's just dance some more.� She began dancing, moving his hands with hers,
  making him dance as well. Tim reluctantly went along and began dancing as well.
  The men backed away, but when he glanced around the room, the men gave him
  unfriendly looks and the women amused looks. Tim figured it was hopeless and
  he would have to go along with whatever happened and hope he wasn't beaten
  to a pulp. By the end of the song he was dancing more normally, though he was
  still nervous and embarrassed. The girls continued to put on their show, wiggling
  their hips and flashing their tits occasionally. Less attention was on Tim
  now at least. They danced for another song and Tim relaxed just a little, his
  buzz helped him cope, though he really wanted the rest of his clothes back. 
As the song was ending Gail started to say, �I'm about ready for another drink.� But
  then a slow song started and she changed her mind and said, �Oh, but we have
  to dance to this one first.� She pulled Tim close and again he found his face
  against her bosom. She reached her hand down and started feeling his ass. Embarrassed,
  Tim reached behind him and grabbed her wrist and pulled her hand up to his
  back. Some people watching laughed. It looked more like something a woman would
  do when dancing with a guy with roaming hands. Gail just laughed too and reached
  right back down and gave his butt a hard squeeze. Tim tried again, but found
  he wasn't even able to budge her hand when she resisted. Instead she grabbed
  onto his hand and led it back around to her own ass. He only left it there
  a moment, but kept his arms around her this time. She just held him by the
  hips for a little while to Tim's relief, but then halfway through the song
  her hands started inching down again. She grabbed his butt with both hands
  and started kneading his cheeks, while pulling him even closer against her.
  His face was resting in her tits and his crotch rubbing against her thigh.
  Combined with the way she was feeling his ass it got him turned on again. By
  the end of the song he was completely hard. As the song ended she pushed him
  back and looked him up and down. Tim cursed his choice of wearing those bikini
  underwear again as his hard-on was so obvious. He was almost going to pop out
  of the underwear. 
Gail grabbed his hand and led him to the bar. Tim looked at the floor to avoid
  meeting the eyes of the men and women they passed. He had never felt so embarrassed.
  At the bar, Gail's friends were sitting in the stools again. They gave up their
  seats, amusement apparent in their faces. The girls who had been dancing were
  sitting in the next stools again. On the bar were Tim's wallet and keys. He
  looked at them as Gail ordered more drinks and everything seemed to be there,
  except his shorts. Gail sat next to Tim this time her hand resting on his thigh. �Where
  are my shorts?� Tim asked again. He was staying calmer hoping that might help
  get them back. 
�Oh they're around, don't worry. I like seeing you like this now.� she said
  and she grabbed his balls and squeezed lightly. �You look sexy.� She ran her
  fingers up his shaft then dropped her hand back on his thigh. 
The girl in the next stool (the one still wearing Tim's shirt) turned to them.
  She looked Tim up and down, her gaze obviously lingering on his cock for a
  moment. She leaned closer so that her breast rubbed on Tim's right shoulder
  and said to Gail, �I like your new boyfriend, he's cute,� and she giggled. 
�Back off, he's mine!� Gail said, but she laughed too. She grabbed Tim's crotch
  again. The drinks came and Gail made Tim do another shot and he drank his beer.
  He was getting drunker and everyone acted like it was no big deal so that he
  almost got used to sitting there in his underwear. It wasn't very long before
  Gail wanted to dance again. Tim barely bothered to try to protest as once again
  he was dragged to the middle of the room. He felt the embarrassment return
  immediately as all the rough looking men and women watched him dancing there
  in his bikini shorts. Gail didn't help by grabbing at him and laughing loudly.
  She kept fondling his crotch Tim would just blush and look at the floor. Every
  time he did look up he saw faces staring at him. All the women in the bar seemed
  to be watching. He was starting to get really aroused in spite of his embarrassment.
  Gail started putting her finger inside the waist band of his shorts, snapping
  them on the side or in back. 
�Please don't,� Tim said, looking up at her pleadingly, �I'm too embarrassed,
  I have to go.� 
�Shhh,� she responded and started tracing her finger along his chest and slowly
  down his stomach. Then she hooked her finger in the elastic in front and pulled
  it way out, looking down as she did so. Tim's erection bounced out to laughter.
  He reached down and struggled with Gail to pull his shorts back into place.
  She let him do it but grabbed his butt with both hands and pulled him against
  her. She bent close to his ear and said quietly, �I'm going to strip you in
  front of all these people. Then I'm going to do whatever else I want with you� and
  you won't be able to do anything about it.� She smiled at him and he knew she
  was exactly right. He was afraid of what was in store for him. Gail started
  grabbing at his underwear again playfully. Tim grabbed onto each side and held
  tightly. 
�Oh come on, just take them off,� the girl who was still wearing Tim's shirt
  called out. Then she came up and took hold of one of Tim's arms. Her friend
  took the cue and grabbed the other. Tim could feel their breasts rubbing against
  him as he struggled. Gail, instead of going for his underwear again, began
  tickling Tim. Tim was ticklish and soon he was squirming around and laughing.
  Then Gail stuffed her hand down the front of his underwear and grabbed firmly
  onto his testicles. 
�I'll give you to three to let go. One�Two�� By two she had tightened up her
  grip enough for Tim to wince and let go. Gail released his balls and grabbed
  his underwear on both sides and gave a yank. Soon he found himself completely
  naked, the two ladies still holding his arms. He was still hard and everyone
  seemed to be staring at him. He was blushing and wished he could get away or
  at least cover himself. Then the girls released him and backed away looking
  him up and down. Gail pulled him to her again and began fondling him. �Let's
  dance some more.� She began dancing and Tim had no choice but to go along.
  He had given up resisting and just hoped it would end soon. His erection bounced
  around as he danced. He thought he would die from the embarrassment. Before
  long she tired of dancing and took him back up to the bar. She had one more
  drink, but Tim didn't have another. 
�Well, I think it's about time for us to leave, lover.� She grabbed Tim's
  cock and started leading him towards the door. 
�Wait, what about my clothes?� Tim asked nervously. 
�Oh you don't need those for what were going to do,� she said. 
�Please, let me have my clothes back.� Tim pleaded, �Please�� he said again. 
�Aw, you're so cute when you beg. It almost makes me feel sorry for you�but
  I know you really like it. Your cock gives you away. Tim looked at the floor
  as he was irresistibly led to the door. A woman pinched his butt as he walked
  past and he could hear people laughing at him. Tim looked hopefully at the
  bartender before he was led outside. He thought maybe he would call the cops,
  but the way he quickly avoided Tim's gaze made it seem doubtful. In the parking
  lot there were even more bikers partying and roughhousing, a new crowd of people
  to laugh at Tim. Just outside the door Gail pushed Tim against the wall and
  kissed him on the mouth. It was a long lingering kiss and Gail's tongue probed
  Tim's mouth. He was still very aroused in spite of his fear and he found he
  was kissing her back. He was ashamed that the way she could overpower him turned
  him on so much. It felt so exciting to be pressed against the wall that way,
  completely helpless and unable to escape. After the kissing she again led Tim
  by his cock to a motorcycle, hers apparently and she straddled it. She told
  Tim to get on back. Since he was still surrounded by Gail's friends he saw
  no choice but to comply. Again he was very afraid. Getting on a motorcycle
  naked sent visions of what could happen if they wiped out running through his
  mind. Gail was confident and commanding and soon he was sitting behind her.
  She started the bike and pulled Tim's arms around her waist. She shifted on
  the seat so that she was sitting on Tim's cock. Before he could really prepare
  they were off, Tim shutting his eyes and clutching to Gail in his terror.
