It was a typical alcoholic night
out. It started with you listening to music and drinking wine in your house. Then
you got dressed and went out heading to DADA (1). You found a stool
on the bar, ordered the first beer and took out the tobacco to roll a cigarette.
You took the first drag in the same time with the barman giving you the glass.
You thanked him and took the first sip. The music was good, dark with not a
hint of the typical Saturday night metal shit (2); at least not yet.
�I hope he keeps it like this� you thought and took another sip of cold Amstel.
The place was starting to get crowded, something you could tell by the
increasing fuss and smoke which had already filled the bar. You drank the second
pint while smoking the third cigarette and as it looked, you wouldn�t stop
there. The third beer was on the house and the fourth from someone sitting at the
other side of the bar, someone you would definitely remember at another time.
He raised his glass nodding his head towards you and without standing up he
gulped almost one third of his pint. You waved back and drank. You didn�t go
over there; you didn�t even ask why he gave you a treat. It didn�t matter.
Maybe you had met him once, maybe from Thessalonica (3), maybe from
somewhere else. It was a free beer and you felt a little grateful towards him
for not coming to your side; understanding the fact that you were drinking
alone and that was how you wanted it be. After all that was what he was doing.
It was a typical alcoholic night out.

&nbsp;

At it was usual for the Saturday
nights in DADA, after two o�clock the dj changed and the music
became unbearable. You stood up and after going to the toilet to unload as much
of the beer as you could you went to pay the barman (4). The mystery
man wasn�t there which was good since you didn�t want to talk. Before you left the
bar, the barman gave you a free shot of Tequila and after thanking him you
headed for the door. It was biting cold but no more than an ordinary January
night in Athens, so you buttoned up your coat.
Your ears were buzzing from the loud music and the alcohol. You were not drank of
course, you were just in the right place. It was that particular state when you
know what�s happening around you and you can react but not in the right time!
Arriving at Thisio (5), you saw a silver colored car running like
hell leaving behind a tail of lights; just like a picture. You smiled and kept
walking. You were a little hungry and since you had nothing in the fridge you
got in a fast food. You were last in the queue and as you were trying to decide
what to get you put your hands in your pockets. And then you realize what�s
about to happen. You take
your hands out holding but a few cents. You�ve got no money! 

&nbsp;

�Way to go!� you think to yourself and leave the
store laughing at what could have happened. 

&nbsp;

You take the road down to your house.
It�s still cold and the wind is increased too. It whistles
around you and freezes your face even more. You change the road so now the wind
is blocked by the houses and after a while you smile with your choice since it
works. Nevertheless, you can�t wait to get back home and get under a blanket.
After a few blocks, you�re there and you enter the building. The warmth brings you comfort. You open the door to your flat. Strange�the
door was unlocked. You walk inside quite alarmed.� You look at the kitchen and grab an empty
beer bottle. You turn
all the lights on. Your
heart beats faster. You go into the toilet but no one is in there. So you head
to the bedroom. With a hand yielding the bottle ready to throw it you kick the
door open and jump inside. That�s when you realize you�ve been holding your
breath all that time. You sigh
with relief. You put
the bottle down and go to release the last remains of the beer. You throw some water on your face and go out. You undress,
put your pajamas on and get under that huge black blanket. You close your eyes and surrender in Morpheus arms. 

&nbsp;

The next morning you woke up with
a strange feeling. It was a weird night and you had a restless sleep. But it doesn�t
really matter. Alcohol can play tricks with your mind. It�s nothing a big cup
of coffee and a cigarette can�t fix. You open your eyes but everything is still
dark. �What the hell?� you wonder since you remember leaving a light on before
you went to sleep. But that�s not what�s bothering you. You feel something on your
face. A mask! You panic and try to get it off with your hands but in vain. Your hands can�t move. They�re
both stretched upwards and tied to the bed post. So are your legs. What�s going on? You�re
way beyond panic and now you�re entering levels of fear you never imagined that
existed. You scream but you can�t hear you voice. And how could you with this
thing in your mouth? How is it that you didn�t realize it was there all this
time? What can you
do now? You
try to relax and understand what�s going around you. You move your body a
little bit. You can
feel clothes on you. You�re
still under the blanket and this confuses you. This is definitely your bed. So,
you�re still in your house, you�re still dressed, on your bed with the slight
(!) difference that your hands and legs are tied. This makes no sense. Someone
got in your house, tied you up on the bed and left you there. But when did all
this happen? Does it
really matter? No it
doesn�t. The big question is what you do now. Will he come back? When and will he be alone? Is he
gone? You try to relax and hear something, anything in the room. You can�t hear
a movement; nothing that would signify another man�s presence. Not even a scent
but on the other hand the room is full with the smoke from your clothes from
the bar so you couldn�t smell anything even if you tried.

&nbsp;

All of a sudden you hear a light
�click� and your head jerks backwards as much as possible. A few agonizing
seconds follow and then you hear the intro of �Strange day� (6). The
creak of a chair and light steps following that and you try to understand their
location. You scream but nothing comes out. You try to get whatever is the
thing that keeps you blind off but you fail. The footsteps come near you.
You�re panicking again. There is a pressure applied on the bed. He sat beside
you and you�re yelling behind the gag. You feel a hand pushing your hair aside.
You jerk your
head left and right to avoid his touch. The
bed is shaking violently from the movement of your hands and legs. But you can�t really succeed at anything. You�re tied to good. 

&nbsp;

�Ssshhh� you hear voice as he keeps stroking
your hair. The hand goes down, grabs the blanket and lifts it up with one
movement as he stands up. You hear the blanket landing on the floor in the same
time with the intro of �Silence is sexy� (7). 

&nbsp;

�At least the
music is good� you
hear a voice in your head in a desperate attempt to avoid getting hysteric, but
that doesn�t succeed much. 

&nbsp;

You feel the hand on your back,
lowering on your waist and getting inside your blouse. You feel him touching your skin. You shiver by this. You jerk
your body in every direction and keep screaming even though you�re sure you
couldn�t even be heard in the kitchen, a few meters away. His hand travels over
your pajamas all the way to your calf and then back up, staying for a little on
your ass. Your hearing is in tremendous excitation so you can pick up a light
humming of approval. And then you decide what you must do. You stop reacting. You stop
screaming (it didn�t have any effect after all) and jerking. You stop reacting
to his touch, his moves and his presence. And when you get the chance, you�ll
try to make as effort to escape; if you�re given any. Maybe if you relax you
could deal with the situation better. 

&nbsp;

You feel something cold and sharp
on your waist. It moves a bit on your skin and then up pulling your
blouse.� It doesn�t take long before the
first �scratch� and you know what comes next. The sleeves are torn and then the
blouse is pulled of your body. You feel a pair of lips kissing your shoulders and
parts of your back with no pattern or direction. You feel him caressing you and
after a while�nothing. The blade travels to your left shoulder and cuts the strap
of the bra; he does the same on your right. You feel teeth biting your shoulders
and neck. Your mind gets confused. It�s trying to assimilate the senses. You are
trying to figure out if you know him from his touch, bite and scent but the panic
and fear that you can�t reject entirely stop you from doing so. He leaves the
bra on you, something that is more than welcome. �

&nbsp;

The blade gets lower without
leaving your skin offering an almost hedonistic chill. It�s the first pleasant feeling and it upsets you. It disorientates
you and perhaps that�s his purpose. He puts
your hair up and kisses your neck again. He bites
softly and caresses your back. His hand goes down to your ass and caresses you
there too. He moves it between your legs, he touches you, enters you, rubs you.
The biting continues. You feel
his other hand grabbing your neck and lifting you just a little bit; the biting
is getting better and his �exploration� deeper. Your mind gets lost for a while. You�re sweating. But why? Is it because
you understand that he is going to go further and you are sweating from fear?
Or are you starting to enjoy it? This scent� it�s definitely familiar. You�re
trying to think but you can�t. After all this is not exactly the most
convenient situation for logic thinking. Suddenly he pulls himself away and that
brings you back. You feel the blade on your legs and the pajama tears up along
them; up until the hem in the waist, revealing the wonderful ass he had felt
earlier. He caresses your legs and spanks in a playful manner your ass. Then it
gets more intense, the spanks are landing on the upper thighs and then on their
inner side, well at much as he can aim these parts since you�re lying on the
bed and then he returns on your ass. You realize that you must have a slight red
color by now but that�s the least of your concerns. What worries you is that
you like this. He is not violent; he is gentle, almost polite. Without being able
to see, the rest of your senses are working overtime multiplying everything you
feel. His touch on your shoulders sends shivers down to your calves and the
other way around. �

&nbsp;

You feel the blade going from one
side of your body to the other, from your shoulder to the toes, playing with
whatever covers it. Then he spanks your ass with the blade and after that�nothing.
He gets off the bed and you can not understand anything. You hear sounds that
can only mean he�s getting undressed. He sits
on you, just below your ass. A kiss
on your neck and a metal thing (handcuffs?) on your right leg and then getting
untied. Is this the
chance you were looking for? But what can you do with only one leg? You realize that it would best if you waited. The same
thing happens to your left arm, but again this is not something you can deal
with him. He pulls your leg and ties it to the hand. He pulls your head by the hair a little painfully. He kisses
your lips, bites your neck and then lets you down again. 

&nbsp;

He ties your hands together in a sudden
move that surprises you. The same thing happens to your legs. He hugs you and turns
you on your back. He pushes your body vertical to the bed and now your head is
on the wall. He leaves the bonds that keep legs and hands tied but undo the one
that keeps them together. Is this your chance? You don�t think so. You
feel the blade on your navel. It goes up to your breasts. You feel it standing
above the nipples, pressing lightly. Then it goes down to the breastbone, under
the bra and with one swift motion cuts it. Your full breasts are free now, to be
seen, touched, tasted, something he does. You feel the blade upon your flesh now
and it turns you on.� Your breath gets
irregular and you�re hoping he won�t see it. You feel his tongue on you, his lips;
his teeth are biting down, pulling your nipples slightly. The biting gets more intense,
pain, pleasure and pain again. Your feet tremble a bit from the pain and
plaintive groans slip your lips. He withdraws and you feel an additional pain
as the blood returns to your nipples. 

&nbsp;

He gets up from the bed and you�re
trying to relax. He ties a rope around your right ankle and another one on your
left. You don�t know why he�s doing this. He pulls the rope and both legs (since
they�re still tied together with the cuffs) are directed to your left. You understand
that he ties the rope to the left and then the cuffs come out. He tied the other
leg on the opposite side of the bed; and now you�re lying on your back, your hands
tied behind it, you can�t see or talk, you only wear your string, your legs are
open wide and most important tied to the bars of the bed. Suddenly, you realize
that maybe it wasn�t that bright idea to get a bed with iron bars. Or was it? The
expectation of what�s coming is as strong as the fear. You feel the blade coming
up and down your inner thighs. The tip of the blade turns you on because it�s on
the right height, deep enough to scratch you but not to cut you. His fingers
play with your string. They put it aside and caress you. They enter you and now
his lips are on your legs.� He bites and you
catch your breath because you didn�t expect it. His fingers play with you, getting
inside out, slowly at first then faster. The blade is above the string pressing
inwards. It scares you. You start moving but soon enough you�ll realize that it�s not a good idea so you stop it. You feel
a little pressure and then it goes to one side cutting it. Then the other side is
cut and the last piece of cloth is drawn from you. Robert Smith�s (8)
voice fills the room: 

&nbsp;

��My body is cut and broken

It�s shattered and sore

My body is cut wide open

I can�t stand anymore

It tortures me to move my hands

To try to move at all

And pulled

My skin so tight it screams

And screams and screams

And
screams for more� (8)

&nbsp;

He
gets off the bed and steps away. You
hear water running and he comes back planting a kiss on your lips, then on each
nipple and finally on the thighs. You manage to distinguish a splashing sound and
warm wet cloth touches your pussy. �He massages
you lightly and then removes it. You hear something like foam getting out of a can
and then something creamy gets applied on you. It�s so obvious now; he�s going
to shave you. The forgotten feeling of panic returns and comes over you. You kick
with hands and legs, you�re screaming but of course all these are in vain. You feel
his fingers on your cheek as a move to comfort you. You know you don�t have a choice
and how easy it is to cut you if you keep moving so you try to relax. He shaves
you very carefully, rinsing the razor each time in a bowl. His continuing touch
on your lips, the sense of the razor but also the idea of what is going on
excites you. After a while he�s finished and he puts the towel back to wipe
you. He passes his hand over you to feel the result and it�s electrifying! It�s
more intense that you could have ever imagined. You feel his breath getting
near. His lips touching yours, his tongue enters you, his hands touch your ass
and you let yourself go. He picks up the pace focusing his caresses on your breasts
and your excitement can�t be hidden now. 

&nbsp;

He tastes you as he drives you to
an orgasm you wouldn�t have thought possible a couple of hours ago. One of his
hands stops touching you but that doesn�t matter anymore as you�re near to your
orgasm. Suddenly he stops and you�re left alone. You feel his lips on your nipples and neck. You
hear clothes taken off and you know he�s getting undressed. Is this fear you�re
feeling or expectation? He gets inside you and you hold your breath. You didn�t think it would be so soon. His
pace is getting faster by the minute. It feels like he picked it up from where
his tongue was. His pace is getting even faster and you�re ready. You need just
a few more seconds. The moment the orgasm hits you, you feel an instant and
intense burning on your thighs. He keeps purring wax on you until it reaches
your lips making you scream from pain and pleasure. You tremble for a whole minute
and before you try to relax he kisses your nipples and bites gently on your
neck. He caresses the whole surface that�s been waxed and then the quite wet
smooth pussy. 

&nbsp;

He pulls the cloth that filled
your mouth. You gladly accept the water he offers you from a bottle. After a
few sips he takes it back causing a few drops to fall on you. He lowers his head
and licks it off you tasting once more your breasts. You think whether it would
be a good idea to scream for help. Before you decide you feel the bed moving
and pressure applied on it. It�s
not hard to understand what�s going to happen. He is right in your face. Your keep your mouth closed. You feel
his dick on your lips and his hands caressing your hair. You keep your mouth
closed so he presses forward a little. You try to avoid it but then again maybe
you could get back at him in this way. So you open up and he gets inside you. He
takes his time, moving slowly at first back and forth. You are positioned in a way
that you can�t really give the rhythm so you pretty much have a passive role in
this. He gets deeper and stays longer inside you. You�re
getting choked. He grabs your hair and keeps a steady pace. You�re sitting really
awkward but that�s really the least of your concerns. He puts his hand on your breasts
and the other one remains on your head. You
decide to bite him to force him out. But you don�t have a desiring effect; it�s exactly the opposite since he�s getting more excited. You bite harder but still no changes. You
are really getting choked and bite him desperately, so he pulls back. He
pinches your left nipple making you gasp. 

&nbsp;

�I bet it
hurt you more than me� you think
and smile to yourself.

&nbsp;

This thought will be interrupted
by a sudden, piercing and unexpected pain. Before your body calms down, you
received a second and then a third spanking. You had forgotten your position
and what he was able to do. He is holding a leather belt and he�s hitting you
exactly between the legs. It feels like an electroshock. You�re up to number
five, six�ten times on the left and the same on the left of your thighs.
Somewhere around the third one he put the gag back on for the screaming was
getting too loud. He moved the spanking to your ass with the same intensity. It�s a completely different feeling. At
least this brings you some pleasure. But you can�t think of that because your
mind is still screaming from the pussy spanking. Your body is shaking. He gets inside you and you scream. But he
doesn�t move; he just stays there. He lifts your hair up and bites your neck.
He puts his hand in front aiming for your clit. He keeps biting. He starts
rubbing. The pain from the first spanking has faded. You�re feeling pleasure again. You
start moving. He remains still. His hand
keeps moving. He keeps biting. You�re
in your house, tied, with a stranger who�s making love to you, sometimes violent
and sometimes gentle. You�re with a stranger who�s tied you up, spanked you,
who�s doing whatever he wants and the only thing you do is respond. 

&nbsp;

He lets your neck loose and grabs
your hips. He picks up the pace and now you�re moving together. His moves
become more intense; so are yours. He pushes your head down thus making your
ass stand higher. As he penetrates you deeper you�re following his rhythm. You both
are close to an orgasm and suddenly he pulls himself away. Complaining sounds escape
your gagged mouth. You feel him in your ass but you�re not ready for this so you
try to pull away. He grabs your neck tightly. A wave of fear hits you. His other
hand finds your clit. He rubs you again but the closer you get the tighter gets
his grip to your throat. Your face is red and you breathe more difficult. The gag
comes off and it gets a little easier on you. The grip in your neck gets loose
but the clit rubbing keeps going. He gets inside you again and you gasp. You are
so wet that he�s sliding inside with more comfort and much deeper. 

&nbsp;

For once more he gets his dick out
of you and grabbing your hips he goes for your ass. This time you remain still. He
starts to get inside and you jerk from this new emotion. Your favorite
combination of pain and pleasure is offered you in great amounts. He got
himself half way in moving slowly when with one sudden motion that makes you
shout, he put the rest of his dick in you. With his fingers rubbing your clit, his
dick in your ass and his other hand struggling you, there are but a few moments
separating you from the orgasm. That�s when he stops rubbing your clit and you receive
another waxing on your back, giving you the chance to scream again, only this
time it�s from pure pleasure. The wax hits your neck and running along your
spine, it reaches your ass. He pushes your head down and you bend forward thrusting
your ass even more, something he gets advantage of and pours some more wax.
This exact time, the orgasm hits you and your whole body trembles. That of course
had an immediate effect on him since your ass pressed him more bringing him closer
to an orgasm he reached just a few moments later; making him unload his warm semen
inside you. Every time his dick jerked you felt him more, that made your muscles
spasm more, which in turn made your body press his dick more. So the cycle you entered
kept on going for a couple of minutes even though you both felt it like a
century. He collapsed on you kissing your neck. After a few minutes, without
changing places, you began moving your ass again and in no more than ten minutes
you had made him hard. 

&nbsp;

�I want you inside me� you said
without thinking anything else. �I want you inside me, as you want it�. He kissed
your neck and got up. He helped you get up too. He hugged you until your blood
was running normally in your legs again. The
scent! You definitely
knew him but your mind was stuck somewhere. He put his hands on your shoulders
and pushed you forward. You knelt in front of him. You felt a rope around your
neck. He didn�t tie it; you just knew it was there. He kissed your lips and pulled it. Your tried
to stand up but held you kneeling. You followed him walking on your kness. He
walked very slowly so it was easy for you to keep up. You went in the bathtub
after he took the rope off you. He got in and turned the water on. You were
still kneeling, with eyes closed, hands tied behind the back and he was
standing in front you. Hot water fell on you and then soap. He bathed your body
and then let you to do his. You raised your head upwards and opened your mouth.
You received a caress on the cheek, a kiss on the neck and flesh in the lips.
You closed your mouth taking him inside. You picked up a steady and slow rhythm
and you made him hard in no time. The water fell on your face making your efforts
more difficult as it was getting in your nose and you couldn�t breathe. He
changed the water�s direction and put his hand on your head setting the pace.
Your position was getting him excited something you could easily understand by
the intensity of his moves. 

&nbsp;

After a while your gag reflexes showed
up and he withdrew himself. He helped you get up and held in his arms. He made you open your legs, lean against the wall, lifted your left foot and got inside you. Then
he lifted your right leg and now you found yourself on the air with only the
wall and a �still- unknown man that tied you, spanked with you a belt, waxed
you, made love to you the way he wanted, holding you. �The water was falling over you and he began
moving faster inside you. You could tell that he was going to cum soon. You pressed your legs downwards to let you down.

&nbsp;

��I want to taste you� you said and he
released your legs. �

&nbsp;

You knelt in front of him, only
this time you opened your mouth for him to get inside. He put his hands on your
head and he did. His was moving fast and deep but it didn�t make you feel
uncomfortable; it was exactly the opposite. The
whole situation was turning you on. You stuck
your tongue out and licked his dick as he entered your mouth. His breathing was
telling you his was about to come, plus your could feel his hands on your head
tremble a bit. His last moves were slower but deeper so you gagged a little, especially
when your throat filled with his semen. Lucky for you he didn�t last as much as
the first time so you managed to handle it. When you relaxed he lifted your body
up and kissed you. 

&nbsp;

He untied your hands rubbing them
for a while to get the blood back flowing. He
toweled your body and then his. He took you back in the room. He took the mask off. You didn�t open your eyes.� You took his hand between yours;
you went to the bed and lied down. You kept
your eyes closed. He lied beside you. He threw a blanket over you. You
placed your leg between yours because he liked it. You put your hand on his
chest because he liked it. You rested your lips on his neck because he liked
it. You slept in the arms of a man who satisfied a secret wish. You didn�t open your eyes. You didn�t have to. You knew. The kiss�
