Synopsis: A sub- girlfriend dresses in an extreme outfit for her dom boyfriend.Pinky- Bowing Out 

Pinky checked everything was laid out on the dining table in the correct order,
  getting dressed was going to be hard enough without struggling to find any
  parts of the outfit. H er boyfriend Jerry, correction her Master (she would
  really have to get used to thinking of him as such) was relaxing in an armchair
  with a little smile on face. 

The reason that he was smiling, was that tonight Pinky would have to prove
  to the world (or at least the H igh St. , Fulham part of it) that she was his �sub'
  . That she was totally subservient to his wishes and would do anything he requested. 

It had all started a when she had met Jerry two years ago, they had been living
  together on and off for just over a year. Over that time Jerry, shit sorry � H
  er Master� had slowly introduced to bondage and then mild pain. At first she
  had resisted, when the levels of bondage and pain had increased and twice now
  she had tried to leave him. The first time she had stayed away for two weeks
  before begging him to let her come back. The second time, a month ago, she
  had only managed three days before she again begged him to let her come back. 

This time though he made conditions, if she came back she must obey him unconditionally
  inside and outside the flat. She would have to be his sub in public and in
  private. 

For the last month she had been preparing for her first public outing. H er
  Master had laid out the rules; there would be no halfway measures, she would
  wear the outfit of his choice. 

This evening Pinky was to be her public outfit as �Pinky'. 

H er Master had planned it so that everything about her outfit would embarrass
  her and make her stand out from the crowd. H is first decision had been the
  colour. Pink, she hated pink, she had always hated pink, it was a girlie colour.
  Before she had met him, Pinky had been a goth . All black, black doc martens,
  black tights, short black skirt, ripped black top, black makeup and jet black
  hair. Jerry (damn), her Master had slowly teased her into more feminine clothes
  and different colours. But she had steadfastly refused to wear anything of
  any shade of pink. 

On her last return, her Master had decided to change her name from � Tom my'
  (Jane Tom kins ) to Pinky. She could not fight him, she could not leave him
  again she needed the bondage / the pain / the control. So she became Pinky.
  Early on her Master had decreed that from then on she would wear mostly pink,
  not just any pink but blush pink, Barbie pink, girlie pink. H e knew she detested
  the colour, that's why he made her wear it. H e also ordered her to dye her
  hair blonde and wear it in a high Barbie, bouffant style. H er makeup which
  was previously, all dark colours, was now pinks and reds and light blue's .
  Pinky hated herself every time she looked in the mirror, but knew she had no
  choice if she wanted to stay. 

The last month she had spent all her spare time preparing her outfit, her
  Master had asked that she wear her normal �bedroom' gear covered with extra
  clothes to preserve her modesty and stop her being arrested. Pinky had sewn
  an ornate hobble skirt and a short jacket and covered a long line bra, all
  these items were in blush pink. She had been wearing a waist cincher night
  and day and had reduced her waist six inches from her normal 29� to a breathless
  23�. This made her figure stunning, as she was a big girl 5' 10 � , 168lbs, &nbsp;40� D
  and 38� hips. She hated the corset it was so restricting, she could not bend,
  breath and it dug in under her ribs. She had also being wearing high 6� heels,
  although she had not seen the shoes or the corset for tonight's outing as Jerry
  (��. Master) had handled those. &nbsp;

Pinky went back upstairs and sat down at her dressing table, sitting down
  at the low stool was uncomfortable in the tight cincher and the high-heeled
  boots. First she undid the high collar of the frilly pink massively befrilled
  floor length peignoir, that her Master insisted she now wear in the bedroom
  and around the house while not dressed, it was a totally over the top with
  a high frilly neck and dripping with lace at wrists and the edge. It was buttoned
  all the way down the front to about mid-thigh with multitude of small buttons
  and woe betides Pinky if her master found any of them undone. 

There was two reasons for this: 

&#149;&nbsp;She could not close the buttons at the waist without the cincher
  being fully laced and as such if she was wearing the peignoir the cincher had
  to be tight laced 

&#149;&nbsp;The collar was high tight and filled with bones and as such Pinky
  had to go round the house with her head held high to stop the bones digging
  in. 

Pinky absolutely detested the Peignoir and as such he was most strict and
  made her wear it every morning and night. 

First she trowelled on a heavy pink tinted foundation, next she drew on eyebrows
  much higher than her normal and then several shades of pink and light blue
  eye shadow. Next she glued on an enormous set of false eyelashes and then layered
  them in heavy black mascara, the false lashes were cumbersome and she had trouble
  seeing past them. Then came the bight pink lipstick that stood out from the
  foundation like a beacon. &nbsp;Earlier on she had teased the blonde hair up
  into a bouffant and set it hard with a full can of hairspray. Pinky picked
  up a deep stiffened pink ribbon with a large 6� wide Pink bow attached to it,
  she carefully wrapped it around her bouffant hair, she pinned it at the back
  and then hair gripped it in eight places around the bouffant. Using a hand
  mirror to judge, at the back she pinned several smaller pink bows from crown
  down to neck. The last touch was the large earrings which had 3� wide pink
  bows attached, especially picked out by her Master. 

Finished at last, she viewed herself in the mirror, grimaced, and thought 

�Was Jane Tom pkins really still under there somewhere� 

She struggled to her feet, the low stool, the high heels, the tight cincher
  and the frilled peignoir all causing her problem. Slowly she unbuttoned all
  the little buttons of the peignoir and then loosened the waist cincher and
  rubbed her sore ribs. This morning he had made sure it was fully tightened
  before he left for work. Pinky then bent down and unlaced the 6� heeled ankle
  boots, that he made sure she wore in the house, the reason being that she could
  not just slip them off the way she had being doing with pumps. She was not
  really happy in high heels, competent but prior to moving in Jerry ( ooops � Master)
  , she had worn flat shoes or Doc Marten boots. 

Now naked Pinky visited the toilet before going back downstairs, she had a
  feeling that it would be many hours before she had the opportunity again, lastly
  she sprayed herself all over in a pungent cloying flowery perfumed body spray,
  it smelt like something her grandmother would wear on bad day. Back downstairs
  two new items had been added to the table a large butt plug and some small
  nipple clamps. Next to her Master's chair was large zipped holdall, which Pinky
  assumed contained the missing parts of her outfit. With a sigh Pinky went back
  upstairs and fetched the lubricant. The butt plug was the largest she had so
  far used and inserting it caused her a great deal of discomfort and left her
  feeling bloated. Back downstairs she then picked up the high waisted , long
  legged extra firm control panty briefs, in effect a girdle. It was very stiff
  and to make matters worse it was two sizes to small. 

Pinky inserted her legs and dragged them up to her thighs, and there they
  stuck. She grasped the top and slowly jerked and twisted them up to her waist.
  Jerry stood and indicating to Pinky that she should pull the front, he stood
  behind and jerked up the back. Pinky gasped as the gusset was pushed upwards
  driving the butt plug deeper. The briefs were really tight and they crushed
  Pinky's minimal belly to nothing. Jerry resumed his seat, and Pinky moved back
  to the table feeling the butt plug even more intensely due to the tightness
  of the panty briefs. She then picked up the stay up stockings and with some
  difficulty sat down and smoothed each one onto her legs. 

Standing with even more difficulty, Pinky returned to the table and picked
  up the &nbsp;pink longline bra. 

There came a short cough from her Master and she quickly put down the bra
  and picked up the nipple clamps. &nbsp;Pinky had deliberately avoided them
  as although they were small she knew they were very uncomfortable if worn for
  any length of time. She grimaced as she carefully attached them to her large
  nipples. 

Moving even more deliberately now, Pinky picked up the longline pink bra.It
  was an original fifties cone bra. She had carefully covered it in the blush
  pink material and had even had to pad the cups as the cups were to big even
  for her 40�D breasts. 
She pushed her arms through the wide straps, hoisted her breasts high into
  cups the and strained to fasten the 7 hooks at the back, wincing as she put
  pressure on the nipple clamps. H er bosom was now about 4� higher and &nbsp;6 � bigger,
  due to the padded cups and the much shortened straps. H er view of the floor
  was now severely restricted by the two missile nose cones thrusting out from
  her chest. 

The sound of the zip on the holdall, made her turn and her Master drew out
  a long pair of pink boots, when the heels appeared Pinky gasped they were full
  7� stiletto heel, with a ballet toe. Pinky started to say something, something
  like she could not wear them, she could not walk in them, they would show below
  the skirt, people would see her. 

H er Master held up his hand to stay her outburst, 

�We agreed that it would be bedroom wear� 

Pinky could not really argue, even before she left the last time, her Master
  had made her wear ballet boots most nights, a short pair of ankle boots, but
  still with ballet heels. She had eventually managed OK on them, except for
  the stairs, which she had to take on her knee's . These boots though were something
  else, they were thigh high with double lacing and blush pink patent leather. 

H er Master held them out and Pinky walked over and took them, she walked
  back and sat on a dining chair and placed her feet into one of them. The lacing
  was out except for the last few holes and Pinky began to slowly lace it. The
  holes were close and double with two laces one pink and one white, as she progressed
  up the ankle, she felt her calf muscles being pulled taut and thought that
  these might be slightly steeper than the ones upstairs. She had to keep moving
  her head from side to side to see downwards through the long thick false lashes,
  after ten minutes she had managed to get up to her knee. 

�Make sure they're tight or there wont be enough lace to get to the top� 

Pinky reached down and started from the bottom, pulling each loop tight. &nbsp;After
  half an hour she had nearly reached the top, which covered the leg of the panty
  briefs and came within an inch of the gusset. She then realised that she was
  still short of lace, she reached down again and started tightening from the
  bottom, she found that the sides had to meet and the tightness at the knees
  was making her leg rigid. 
At last she finished and they were so tight that a roll of flesh was forced
  at the top. She then started on the second boot. After another twenty minutes
  she had finished and using the back of the chair as support , levered herself
  upwards. Although she was used to ballet heels, the tightness of the thigh
  high boots gave her little movement at the knees and she had to move this way
  and that to keep her balance. 

H er Master indicated that she should parade around the room, and Pinky made
  a slow stuttering tour, making straight-legged short 6� strides and struggling
  on the turns. When she got back to the table she picked up the hobble skirt.
  This was no ordinary hobble skirt ie just a tight tube of material and it had
  stretched her sewing skills to limit with plenty of mistakes and restarts.
  The basis was a tight skirt of heavily lined pink satin with flat pleats all
  the way down the front that would hold legs clamped together from hip to knee.
  The pleats were held flat by lacing all the way down, to each of the lace crossovers
  was attached a small pink bow. At the bottom was an enormous flounce of pink
  netting, which stuck out 18� all the way round. Just above the flounce was
  a tight 4� pink band, with a massive a massive 18� wide bow at the back. The
  bows continued all the way up the back of the skirt, starting small at from
  4� wide, until the one at bottom level was as wide as her hips. H er hips would
  be extra wide at this point as she had carefully sewn in 2� of extra padding
  on either side to accentuate them, into the bottom was sewn even more padding
  which Pinky thought was a definite overkill as she thought her bottom was enormous
  as it was. &nbsp;She hated the skirt, not the hobble, she was use to them as
  all her skirts, (she was now never allowed to wear trousers) were very long
  and very tight. No it was the prettiness, the girlishness, the sweetness, the
  frilliness and above all the pinkness. 

She unsteadily let herself down onto the chair, and tried to reach down, to
  put the skirt on but could not reach, the ballet heels were to long. So she
  scrunched up her knees tight to her stomach forcing the butt plug even further
  upwards and touching the bra with her knee's and disturbing the nipple clamps,
  grimacing with pain she struggled to guide the skirt over the stiletto heels
  of the ballet boots. With some difficulty she managed and thrust her legs into
  the tight skirt, and took the pressure off her breasts and her anus. She drew
  it up and ruched it until the heels appeared and then stood up using the table
  for support and reached down and eased the skirt up and over her hips. The
  skirt was intended to stop at her hips so that it would not add any inches
  to her waist. Balancing unsteadily on the skyscraper heels. She reached behind
  and fastened the numerous hooks and eyes that closed the skirt. She reached
  across and found the large bow and stretched it across her padded bottom to
  hide the hooks and attached it to another set of hooks. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

She turned around for approval and her Master again signalled for her to parade
  around the room. She thought she managed quite well, even though her legs were
  now pinioned together from hips to knee by the pink skirt and she could only
  manage tiny steps, the ballet heels would not have allowed her much more anyway.
  She slowly moved around the room with wide flounce swinging dramatically with
  every tiny stride. As she completed the circuit, she heard the zip again and
  looked over to see a rolled corset being extracted from the holdall. As expected
  it was pink, but the length surprised Pinky. It looked twice as long as her
  current waist cincher. &nbsp;

H e held it out and Pinky slowly tottered over reached for the corset and
  was surprised at the weight and the stiffness. H er Master made no attempt
  to help her into it and so leaning against the table for balance, she unrolled
  it and the heavily boned, pink satin corset came into view. With some difficulty
  Pinky wrapped it around her torso and adjusted it so that the waistline seemed
  correct. The bottom sat just on her hips, just above the large bow on her bottom,
  the top sat just below her raised bosom, She started to clip the busk together,
  but soon found that the laces were not opened wide enough. She swore under
  her breath and undid the lower clips, removed the corset and pulled the laces
  wide and was surprised to see that there was now at least an 8� gap at the
  waist. She re-balanced herself, fitted the corset again and started fastening
  the clips once more, she got slightly worried at the waist, thinking of the
  8� gap at the back as she struggled to fasten the clips. At last she had the
  10 clips fastened and straightened up. Even loose the corset felt much more
  restricting than the waist cincher. 

Seeing that no help would be forthcoming, leaning heavily on the table she
  reached behind and started pulling the loops tight from the top and the bottom
  towards the middle with one hand, pulling out the excess lace out from the
  middle with her other hand. Eventually she could pull it no tighter with just
  one hand and she looked over her shoulder for some help, her master did not
  move, just pointed to the fireplace. And said, 

�A master should not have to help his sub., that's not part of the deal.� 

Pinky knew what he wanted, next to the fireplace was a large hook, she had
  used it before to help lace the waist cincher when her master was out. H olding
  the surplus lace taut, she struggled vertical and holding the other hand out
  for balance teetered over to the fireplace and reversed up to the hook, and
  looped the surplus lace over the hook. She then moved slowly forwards until
  she had taken up the tension, rolling forward on miniscule toes of the pink
  ballet boots. Looking over her shoulder and using the mirror beside the hook
  to guide her hands, she resumed pulling the loops through again, leaning forward
  to keep the lace in tension. Soon she was becoming breathless and the corset
  became unbelievably tight. Not just at the waist like the cincher but also
  at the hips and ribs as well. 

She eyed up the gap left at the waist, 

� Two inch gap�, she thought, � that leaves another about one inch to go,
  but this thing feels as tight or even tighter than my cincher, she thought
  good thoughts about what she had previously considered a torture�. 

�Master are you sure this a 22� waist, because it already feels very tight� 

�I don't remember saying it was a 22� waist, it is actually a 21� waist and
  if you are to wear this� 

Master then pulled a wide leather pink belt out the holdall, 

�It must be fully closed at the waist� 

�But I have never been below 23 inches, I can't jump 2 inches in one go� 

�Oh, I think you can, we have plenty of time, our table is not for another
  two hours yet� 

Pinky looked at the clock and saw it was still early; she tied off the laces
  and tottered over to the sideboard to get the tape measure from her sewing
  box. It slipped out her hands and she automatically reached down to pick it
  up, the corset had other thoughts and refused to let her bend. She turned round
  to ask for help, but he deliberately avoided her eyes. Taking a firm hold on
  the sideboard, she forced the tight ballet boots to bend at the knee, the corset
  forced her to keep her back perfectly straight and as such she had to pivot
  unsteadily on the tiny points of the rigid ballet boots. The act of bending
  reminded her of the butt plug's presence and she quickly snatched at tape measure
  and picked it up, the tension built up in hobble skirt, boots and the corset
  forced her back up too quickly and she stumbled heavily against the sideboard
  and struggled against the unfamiliar compression of her ribs to get her breath
  back. Panting heavily she looked daggers at her master, who seemed to be enjoying
  every second of her discomfort. 

When Pinky had got her breath back, she tried to measure her waist, but there
  was no way she was going to be able to read it directly she could not bend
  forward due to the rigid corset and anyway she could not see downwards past
  the two mountains that now resided on her chest. Not to be beaten, Pinky moved
  slowly back to the mirror, her masters eyes following her as her skirt shimmied
  below her sharply indented waist. In front of the mirror she held the tape
  measure tight and read off twenty three and a half inches, That meant two and
  half inches to go. 

Slowly she turned and throwing the tape on the table and nearly losing her
  balance in the process. Tottering wildly she grabbed the mantelpiece to steady
  herself. H er Master made no effort to help her and this made Pinky angry,
  she pushed off back to the hook, unknotted the laces and hung them over hook,
  walking quickly forward she tugged at the laces and spreading her legs as wide
  as the skirt would let she tipped forward on the ballet boot toes to increase
  the tension, the laces jerked through eyelets and Pinky gasped as the corset
  crushed her waist, not giving up she reached behind her and pull the loops
  through above and below her waist. Finally Pinky could take no more, and gripping
  the free lace tight, she inched her inclined toes forwards, until she got back
  on the heels of the ballet boots. Panting rapidly, her massive bra cups rising
  and falling, she tied off the laces and turned to him. 

�Well is that enough� 

H e shrugged, and pointed 

�Now your laces are not even and it's loose at the top and the bottom� 

Pinky looked in the mirror and saw that the over tightening at the waist had
  forced the busk away from her body at the top and the bottom. She sighed and
  once more she backed upto the hook and repeated the tightening process. There
  was now no way Pinky could see if she had succeeded and she kept looking across
  at her Master until he nodded. With some relief Pinky backed up, unhooked and
  tied off. The stretching round to reach the higher loops had made her short
  of breath and now the corset was even tighter across her ribs and she he struggled
  for air, and stood for a minute taking short pants . She also rubbed the corset
  at her waist and ribs with both hands to try and ease the tightness, it did
  not help and she could not even feel her hands through the tight boning and
  heavy fabric of the corset. 

When her panting had slowed she turned her Master and he held out the belt,
  Pinky slowly minced over to him and grabbed the belt. It was made of stiff
  leather about 3� wide and was covered in the same blush pink patent leather
  as the ballet boots. There was no buckle, just a slit and a matching hasp with
  an unlocked padlock hanging from it. The front of the belt had the word Pinky
  picked out in pinky -red rhinestones and in between the n and the k was a solid
  metal half loop. &nbsp;Pinky held the belt with a look of disgust on her face,
  but eventually she wrapped around her waist, the hasp nearly met the slit but
  however hard she tried , she could not make it meet. 

H er master, sat through all this offering no help. 

With a screech of annoyance, Pinky tottered back to the hook, loosed the knot
  hooked up and pulled forward once again, this time she did not jerk as the
  tightness of the corset after the last tightening was really beginning to make
  it self felt. Eyeing up the one-inch gap remaining at the waist, she slowly
  leant forward and eased the loops through until the gap had closed to just
  half an inch. She eased back, gripping the laces tightly, unhooked and knotted
  the laces. Still panting rapidly, Pinky tried the belt again, and the hasp
  slipped through the slip, turning to the mirror she centred the �Pinky' to
  front, middle and then clipped the padlock closed. 

�What do I do with all this extra lace � 

Pinky indicated the yards of lace trailing behind her, her Master held up
  a pair of scissors, he made no move and Pinky had to flounce over to him to
  get the scissors and then chop the extra lacing. 

�While you're here you might this� 

H e held out a massive a pink frilly bow at 18� wide�. 

�The bow attaches to the belt to hide the padlock� 

Pinky gave back the scissors and took the two items. She reached behind and
  clipped the bow to the belt and it stuck out either side of her harshly constricted
  waist. She then examined the neck corset, this was new, she had never worn
  anything like this before. It was pink leather and only lightly boned, but
  she could not see how she would manage to lace it on her own. Then her master
  stood up and took her arm. 

�Kneel down� 

With her master's support , she pivoted forward on the ballet boots, and then
  he took all her weight until she was on her knees, the tight leather of ballet
  boots squeaking under the strain. Pinky knelt straight upwards, the unbending
  corset not allowing her to slouch. H er master fitted the neck corset and it
  forced her chin up, the rim of the neck corset then swooped upwards under her
  ears and higher up the back &nbsp;&nbsp;of her neck. H e laced until it became
  rigid and Pinky's chin was forced upwards and she sought for air. When he was
  satisfied he grabbed her arm again and hauled her up, holding her tight he
  spun her around grasped her waist and pulled her forward, squeezing the bra
  against his chest, crushing. Pinky yelped as she was powerfully reminded about
  the nipple clamps. &nbsp;

�And now the jacket� 

Pinky pushed off, wincing and staggered back to the table, gasping for air
  again. When she had calmed, she picked up the jacket. It had taken her weeks
  to make and still she had needed help from a retired seamstress down the road.
  It was in pink satin, with pink trim. It was a short bolero reaching to just
  over the top of the corset, with a cut out to allow the cone bra to thrust
  through, it would have had a loose 2� stand up collar, which would now be tight
  over the rigid neck corset. &nbsp;It had massive puff sleeves that were stiffly
  padded; these narrowed down to the elbow where the sleeves became incredibly
  tight and were fastened by closely packed loop buttons, at the end of the sleeves
  was a froth of pink lace which would stand out from the wrist like the skirt
  flounce. The front, above and below the cutout was closed by the same buttons.
  Following the theme of the skirt , the padded sleeves which stuck out &nbsp;4� upwards
  sideward and forwards were decorated with pink bows, starting small at the
  elbow and getting larger at the widest part of the padded shoulders. The hidden
  features of the jacket were that it had been cut short across the back so that,
  Pinky would have to pull her shoulders way back to get it on, also the inners
  of the puff sleeves were sewn to the bodice of the jacket so that she would
  be unable to raise her elbows and as with the skirt there was 2� of padding
  from under the arms downwards to make her waist look smaller. 

Pinky could not get the jacket on without help, and as such her master had
  moved around behind her and she handed him the jacket. Putting her arms low
  and behind her, he guided her arms in to the sleeves and worked them up her
  arms, moving round to the front he dragged one shoulder of the jacket over
  her shoulder forcing it back and then the other. This forced her shoulders
  back and propelled her cone breasts out even further. H er Master carefully
  fastened the top buttons, while Pinky fastened the lower ones, her Master finished
  and stepped backed while Pinky took an age. The buttons were small, close packed
  and fiddly, her reach was restricted by the fixed upper sleeves and she could
  not look downwards due to the neck corset or peer downwards due to the oversized
  false eyelashes. Getting nowhere by feel, she gave up and tottered over to
  the mirror and still took a long time to finish the front buttons using the
  reflection. She then started on the sleeve buttons, which were nearly impossible
  one handed. 

H er Master made no effort to help until she was nearly down to her wrists,
  he then picked up the pink leather gloves from the table and came over, holding
  out her hands, he forced the tight gloves onto her hands, at her Masters request
  Pinky had modified these as well, the fingers were sewn together to the first
  knuckle and the thumb was sewn to the first finger all the way down, making
  her hands practically useless. With some difficulty he forced them onto to
  her hands and then buttoned them closed at the wrist. H e then finished buttoning
  the tight sleeves of the jacket over the gloves and arranging the wrists flounces
  so that Pinky could hardly see her hands even when she held them up. 

H er Master returned to table and picked up the jacket collar, this was a
  large ruff of the same material as the skirt flounce with a stiff deep collar.
  H e fitted it around the neck corset and the ruff nearly covered all of the
  neck corset. The stiffened flounce stood out 6� all the way round. H er master
  first adjusted the angle of the stiffening wires so that it stood straight
  upwards at the front so that it covered Pinky's eyes. 

�Well what do you, think � 

Pinky replied in a muffled voice 

�I don't think I will be able to walk on my own or eat Master� 

H e then laughed and adjusted the angle so that at the front it was level
  with her chin and it then rose until it was vertical at the back framing her
  face. Next came some broad pink ribbon, this he wrapped around and around Pinky's
  neck and then tied a massive frothy bow in front that was so big it was wider
  than the neck �ruff'. 

�OK, lets see how it looks� 

Pinky started off around the room, but soon lost her balance and stumbled,
  the neck flounce and the lack of movement in her arms for balance on top of
  the hobble skirt and the ballet boots was too much. Master jumped to her aid
  and with support , Pinky was much more stable and she flounced around the room
  with many tottering tiny steps. Master led her round to the mirror. 

Pinky looked in the mirror and saw her reflection, she was totally appalled.
  She looked completely tacky. The two flounces along with bows made her look
  like a heavily wrapped pink toffee. The whole pink outfit with the flounces
  and the bows made her look like Barbara Cartland on acid. What would people
  think when they saw her. 

�By the way get used to that corset as the cincher is now going in the bin
  and that your new daily corset� 

Pinky groaned, she would not be able to do anything, bend, sit down, breath. 

�And you better keep it laced tight so that you can manage the next one which
  is already on order and that has got an 18� waist� 

What was he trying to do kill her, she would never be able to manage an 18� waist,
  she could not breath at 21�. 

� Lets finish off then� 

H e came up behind holding the leather wristlets, anklets and chains that
  were kept in the bedroom. 

H e fastened the wristlets above the wrists flounces and attached the chain
  to one side, passed it through the belt half loop and across to the other wristlet,
  the chain was so short that her wrist was dragged to the belt loop. When the
  other wrist was attached, Pinky found that there was enough chain that she
  could only hold one arm straight with other tight against the belt loop. H
  e then bent down and fitted the anklets; the ankle chain would not affect her
  stride, as it was not short enough. Pinky was glad that the anklets would not
  be on view as the flounce covered them. Or they were, until her Master pulled
  out another chain, clipped it to the ankle chain and then pulled it tight to
  the belt half loop. The tight vertical chain pulled the flounce high and the
  ankle chain and anklets were displayed. 

And the she looked up and saw her master holding the ball gag, he opened her
  mouth to say something and he forced in the large pink ball and then pulled
  the ball gag strap around her cheeks and fastened it behind her neck in front
  of the ruff. 

H er Master then pulled up a chair beside Pinky to give her support while
  he went upstairs to get showered and changed. Pinky stood quite still and quiet,
  the now tight ankle chain would not let make a stride. The ball gag restricted
  her breathing even more and she snatched air through her nostrils. Pinky was
  crestfallen the addition of the chains and the ball gag had completely taken
  her aback. She did not know how she would cope with the attention of walking
  up the street with them attached. She could not help but draw attention in
  the pink outfit , &nbsp;but the chains would be just awful. 

After fifteen minutes he came back down, stood behind her, and viewed her
  reflection in the mirror over her shoulder. Pinky noticed that he could only
  just see &nbsp;over her shoulder. Master was a big man 6ft 1� but with the
  7� heels, the padded shoulders , &nbsp;big collar and the bouffant hair he
  looked small. From the tips of her ballet toes to the top of bouffant hairstyle
  she must be about nearly 7ft tall. 

Master moved in front and unclipped the vertical chain so that Pinky could
  move. H e pulled out the body spray and sprayed Pinky liberally all over, including
  her hair. H e then led her over towards the door. 

Pinky was thinking, 

�This is it, the whole street was going to see her in this pink monstrosity
  and even worse with chains and the ball gag.� 

H er Master stopped her and said, 

�I think the chains and the ball gag are a bit much for Fulham� 

H e took them off and then handed Pinky a long handled frilly pink parasol. 

�Well off you go then� 

�What do you mean?� 

�You will take for ever getting down to the H igh Street in that skirt and
  heels, I will follow you in half an hour� 

Pinky sort of nodded and gulped, she had been expecting at least the support
  of her master on her first excursion, but it was not to be. H er Master guided
  out of the front door and then shut it behind her. 

Leaning heavily on the parasol and holding her other arm out as far as the
  restrictive sleeve towards the wall, Pinky started her slow progress, she could
  not where her feet were landing as her view was blocked by the frilly ruff,
  and the stiff neck collar held her head up high. She made slow steps feeling
  every step, even a small crack in the pavement caused her problems. 

A old woman came past and stopped and gazed, Pinky just hoped she would think
  she was an eccentric and tried to ignore her. She kept her eyes forward and
  tried to speed up to walk, but the restrictive outfit kept he progress slow. 

Pinky thought of the future with her Master, she knew she would have try to
  be at ease in the Pink outfit, even though it &nbsp;made her cringe. If she
  showed any major dislike of the outfit in front of him, she just knew he would
  make her wear it again and again. But in the back of her mind she already knew,
  that he knew she really loathed this pink abomination and it would see a lot
  of use in the future. Pinky by name and Pinky by dress. 

And so Pinky makes her slow mincing progress down the street, her view restricted
  by the massive eye lashes and the pink net ruff, her neck squeezed by the high
  neck corset, her shoulders and upper arms pinioned by the tight jacket, her
  massive breasts jutting out in front her, her waist crushed by the heavily
  boned corset, emphasised by the by the extra padding above and below the waist,
  her stomach &nbsp;flattened by the too small girdle. H er legs were squeezed
  from crotch to toe by the tight laced ballet boots and pinioned together by
  the heavily lined hobble skirt. 
She tottered along on 7� stiletto heels, her progress emphasised by the swirling
  flounce the bobbing movement of the padded shoulders, led by the cone bra,
  jutting inches in front of her, finished by her massive bottom, padded and
  forced backwards by the tight girdle and boned corset. She was a fantasy in
  Pink and covered in bows, something out a cartoon, straight out of a &nbsp;Feydeau &nbsp;farce,
  one thing is for sure if you ever see Pinky you will not forget her.
