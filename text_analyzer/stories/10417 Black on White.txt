Chapter 1


Laine Theron just couldn&#8217;t help it. Ever since she was in her early teens, she&#8217;d felt sexually attracted to other girls. Now in her late 40&#8217;s she enjoyed her &#8216;regulars&#8217; but held onto nothing overly consistent in terms of loving relationships.
Laine had been successful at crafting her own small company in the financing niche, but the glory days were well and truly over. Her once thriving little company had previously employed some 18 full-timers, all of which were pretty girls, of course. Now, she only barely managed to afford to keep 7 girls, none of whom she could afford to pay more than 40 thousand pounds per year.
She stared forlornly at her accounts on her computer.
Not getting any better, is it darling? She said to herself.
She shook her head, trying hard to put aside any depressive thoughts that all too regularly invaded her mind.
Her office phone rang.
�Hi, yeah, okay Beth, show her in, please.� Laine glanced at her watch. �She&#8217;s five minutes late, did she say why? Okay, never mind.�
Momentarily, the door to her office opened.
�Miss Theron, this is Hayley. Hayley McArthur,� Laine&#8217;s secretary introduced the girl.
�Please come in and take a seat Miss McArthur. Thanks for coming.� 
Laine stared as her interviewee entered her office and took a seat at the other side of her imposing office desk. The girl had dark skin. 
African decent, Laine pondered. 
She was short, perhaps no more than 5 foot 3. Her hair was long and obviously well cared for. Her curves more than adequately accentuated by her choice of clothing.
Wo, she&#8217;s really, really pretty. Sexy. If I can afford to employ this girl, maybe I&#8217;m onto a good thing in more ways than one. She&#8217;s like a young version of Halle Berry crossed with Nicki Minaj. Best of both worlds.
Laine stood up, towering over the new arrival. She extended her hand. 
�Good to meet you. Thanks for coming. You are a little late. Did you have trouble finding our office?�
Hayley proffered her hand across the office desk.
�Yeah, sorry, I just was, well, late, I guess.�
What does that mean? Laine wondered.
�Okay, well never mind. I&#8217;m sure it will not happen again if I do decide to engage your services. Now, Miss McArthur. Is it McArthur or MacArthur?�
�Mc. Mc. McArthur, thank you.�
�Okay, Ms McArthur, you&#8217;re currently working at Geneva Inc., right?�
�Yup, that&#8217;s it.�
�And why do you wish to transfer to us? Are you unhappy about something where you are at the moment?�
�No, not at all. I just fancy a bit of a change.�
�A bit of a change? Is that all? It&#8217;s not really what I was expecting. I was��
Hayley interrupted. �Look, you know full well that I can turn this� your company around, Laine, so let&#8217;s just get to it, shall we?�
Laine sat back in her seat, startled at the young girl&#8217;s over-confident and aggressive outburst. She felt her face flush. She tried to gather her wits�
�Well� you� you have� you&#8217;ve done well at Geneva, there&#8217;s no taking that away from you.�
�Nope, I&#8217;ve done exceptionally well, and you know it. Over the past year, I&#8217;ve been responsible for more sales than any other employee. A lot more sales. And that is why you need me. Simple, isn&#8217;t it?�
Laine eyed the girl.
�Okay, so you are good� well� very good with sales. There&#8217;s no taking that away from you. And, well� yes, you are right, we do need to improve things on the sales front.�
�Correct. So when do I start, Laine?�
�Emmm� don&#8217;t you� don&#8217;t, you know� don&#8217;t you have to give a certain period of notice with your current company?�
Hayley sniggered. �Joking, right? I think they&#8217;ll be glad to see the back of me.�
Laine raised her eyebrow. �Oh? Why&#8217;s that then, Miss McArthur?�
This girl is just so obnoxious. Is she really going to fit in here? She&#8217;s so� DOMINANT.
�They don&#8217;t like me, Laine. It&#8217;s that simple. I really don&#8217;t know why. I&#8217;m such a good girl.�
�Would you mind calling me Miss Theron, thank you Miss McArthur.�
�Yeah, I would, Laine.�
�Pardon me?�
�You heard me, dear.�
�Look, this is not how you ought to be going about a job interview. Please do remember, this is an interview young lady. I most certainly have not��
The new arrival got up from her seat. �You&#8217;ve not what, Laine, dear? You&#8217;ve not what? I think we ought to get one thing clear right now. Listening?�
Laine looked stunned. She felt her cheeks flush once more. 
�Are you listening, I asked?�
�Ye� yes��
�Good. Okay, here&#8217;s how it&#8217;s going to be. First, I start this coming Monday. Just nod. You don&#8217;t have say anything.�
Laine slumped a little in her office chair, her self-confidence now in tatters. 
�Just nod, I said!�
Laine nodded.
�Good. Second. You will pay me 70 thousand per year, plus comms. Commissions will be paid depending on sales volume. You will provide a 25 percent bonus on sales volume. Thus, if I sell 100,000 pounds worth of gear in month one, I get 25 on top of my monthly salary. Clear so far?�
�But� but we can&#8217;t� I can&#8217;t��
�But you will, Laine. You will. It&#8217;s that simple. You will, dear. Okay, now that&#8217;s clear, thirdly. I need an office. Good sized office. Not some poxy little bedroom-type thing. This size would be fine.� Hayley surveyed Laine&#8217;s expansive office.
�We don&#8217;t� I can&#8217;t� we have an office, but it&#8217;s not as large as this. I&#8217;m sorry but...� 
Why am I apologizing to this� this� woman?
�Okay, just do your best for now. At a later date, we&#8217;ll discuss swapping. Frankly, we&#8217;ll not be spending much time in the office, you and I, so it&#8217;s not of much consequence.�
Laine tried to regain her composure.
�Swapping? Of course, that&#8217;s out of the question. I own this company, young lady. I am the owner. You can&#8217;t possibly just waltz in here and take over. It&#8217;s out of the question! And what do you mean, we&#8217;ll be out of the office. That&#8217;s entirely my decision.� 
�Look, Laine, there&#8217;s never going to be &#8216;no&#8217;. What I want, I get. Simple. End of discussion. Now I don&#8217;t want to hear another word about it. Let&#8217;s move on� where was I? Oh yes, fourthly�&nbsp; car. I need a company car. What&#8217;s available?�
�I don&#8217;t� we don&#8217;t do company cars, Miss McArthur.�
�Well, you do now. I want hmmm� I want an Audi R8 Coupe.�
�I� I can&#8217;t possibly� I don&#8217;t��
�You can, and you will, Laine. Is that clear to you?�
Laine looked down at her hands. She was being beaten into submission from every angle. However, she knew full well that if this young, impulsive, aggressive, downright rude lady came through on her promise, her company would survive, and perhaps even thrive. �Okay. Okay, I&#8217;ll see what I can do, Miss...�
�That&#8217;s better, Laine, dear. And of course, I need a mobile &#8211; top of the range no less, and a laptop. Goes without saying, really. I&#8217;ll also need a secretary, Laine. You will appoint me a personal secretary. Someone young. Pretty.�
�Pretty? Why�? Why� pretty?�
�I like them pretty, dear. So I want pretty. Sexy. Simple.�
�I don&#8217;t believe any of my staff will take too kindly to answering to you, Miss McArthur.� Laine tried to regain some control of the situation.
�I don&#8217;t care. What I want is what I get. Remember, Laine, you cannot say no. I want to run this company the way I see fit. So when I want something, I get it. Don&#8217;t worry. She&#8217;ll not have much to do. I can take care of my own affairs.�
�But� this is my company. Who do you think you are? You come in here for an interview and already you&#8217;re demanding the world. Just who do you think you are?�
�I am who I am, Laine, dear,� Hayley sneered. �You don&#8217;t like that, then your company will die, and you can die along with it. You&#8217;ll probably end up workin&#8217; someplace cleaning toilets or something. Is that what you want? You see, Laine, I know full well how things are going here. I know full well that year on year you&#8217;re failing. Your sales are dropping badly. Your company will go under within the next couple of years. I know it. And you&#8217;ll go down with it. And I know you too. I know that you are &#8216;that way&#8217;. I know that you like younger girls. I know. I know everything about you, and I know about your pathetic little company.�
Laine looked shocked. 
�Oh, don&#8217;t worry, darling, your desire for lesbian lust will be kept secret with me. Don&#8217;t worry about it. But��
Laine waited, now sitting forward, gripping the edges of her office desk tightly.
�But� you have to do what I say. What I want. Nothing less will do. If you refuse, or if you fail, I will kill your company, and I will make sure that you are disgraced into the bargain. Now darling, is that really what you want?� Hayley didn&#8217;t wait for a reply. �No, I thought not. So, I think that concludes our meeting for now. When I return on Monday� or perhaps before� I&#8217;ll expect everything to be ready. Now let me just go through our arrangement once again, briefly, just so there&#8217;s no misunderstanding on your part. That simply would not do.
One &#8211; I begin on Monday, or perhaps before. Gives you 7 days to get everything prepared for me. 7 days or maybe less.
Two &#8211; 70 thousand per year basic, plus 25 percent comms on my sales volume. If I don&#8217;t sell, then no comms need to be paid. But then, I will sell, and I will sell far more than anyone else is capable of in this place, so you best be ready to hand over the commissions as and when.
Three &#8211; good sized office and some fine furnishings. If you don&#8217;t have anything available with regards furnishings, you can ship your desk and chair into my office.
Four &#8211; the car. Audi R8 Coupe. Nothing less.
Fifth &#8211; top of the range mobile phone and a fancy laptop too.
Sixth &#8211; personal secretary. Sexy, pretty, young. Actually, if she&#8217;s not young, then that&#8217;s fine. Someone your own age is fine. But she has to be pretty. In good shape. Big up top. Nice butt. Good for spanking, see? A bit like you, Laine. I find you particularly attractive.� 
Hayley paused.
�Oh, and I almost forgot, there is something else.� Hayley smiled broadly.
Laine felt beads of sweat on her forehead as she noted Hayley&#8217;s extra-exuberant requirements. �And� well� may I ask, what, what is that�?�
�YOU!�
�Emm� pardon� pardon me?� Laine looked perplexed.
�I said, I want you, Laine. I want you.�
�Par� excuse me� you want� you want me to do what?�
�I like you, darling. Just as I said. I find you attractive. Very. I really like your long blonde hair. I appreciate your large bust. Your tits are really big, and I like girls with big tits. You&#8217;re very pretty. You&#8217;re sexy. You&#8217;re relatively submissive, even though you run this feeble company. But then, it&#8217;s because you&#8217;re so pathetically submissive that your company is in such a terrible financial situation. So, I want you. I want you to be mine. I&#8217;ll be moving into your apartment this week. Tonight, in fact. Oh, and don&#8217;t you worry, I don&#8217;t need a separate bedroom. Yours will do perfectly. You&#8217;ll be sleeping with me. I do hope you have a large enough bed. If not, you&#8217;ll have to get one. I don&#8217;t like being crowded out when I&#8217;m trying to get my beauty sleep. And another thing� do you have toys?�
Laine protested. �But� I can&#8217;t� I� it&#8217;s just not possible��
�Tut, tut, tut. Again, you force me to force you. To be the overly dominant partner. Do remember, darling, I know everything there is to know about you. What would you prefer? Again, I have to remind you, seems you have a very short term memory. Would you prefer to remain here, working for me, in a thriving company? Or would you prefer to work cleaning toilets in some office block? I&#8217;ll disgrace you, Laine. I&#8217;ll make you nothing. Your life will become nothing. Is that what you want? Is it?� Hayley carried on. �No, I thought not. And that is why you will do exactly as I say. From now onwards, your private life belongs to me. Your private life will be at my beck and call. Your private life will be our private life, my private life. And Laine, from now on, you will address me as &#8216;Dominae&#8217;. Do you understand what that word means, Laine, darling?�
Laine shook her head.
�It means Mistress, in the Latin language. I thought you were educated. Seems not. Don&#8217;t you worry though, I will be sure to educate you with the correct etiquette. Oh, and Laine, I suspect we&#8217;ll need to do some shopping, you and I. I suspect we will need to get some nice little subby clothing for you. Some new office wear too. A petite maid&#8217;s outfit for the home, perhaps. And here, in the office, I want you in nice little skirts, no more suit trousers for you. Sexy underwear, of my choosing of course. And we&#8217;ll need an assortment of toys. Well, they&#8217;re not really toys, more like domination equipment. Strap-ons, crops, whips, tight latex, face masks, all sorts, really. Any questions?�
�But� my staff. They will� they&#8217;ll��
�They will�?� Hayley raised her eyebrow. �Laine, you must understand, from now onwards, this pathetic company of yours, with your seven little pathetic employees, will come under an iron hand. There will be no disobedience. No gossip. No slacking on the job. It&#8217;s time there were some major changes here. And now that I&#8217;m in control, the dominant force, that&#8217;s exactly what&#8217;s going to happen. Are we clear on that?�
Laine nodded in resignation, fully aware of her new subordinate station in life. 
�Good. Now, as mentioned previously, I wish to move into my new home tonight. Please make the necessary arrangements. I believe this interview is now at a conclusion. It&#8217;s so kind of you to see me, and to offer me the job, Laine, darling. I do hope we can work favourably together. I&#8217;m sure we will make a wonderful partnership, you and I.�
Miss McArthur rose from her seat. �There&#8217;s no need to see me out baby. You&#8217;ve got plenty to get on with, so no doubt you will be very busy for the rest of the day. I will be arriving at my new home around 7 this evening. You will have a taxi come pick me up. My address is with your secretary. Do be sure to be there at my home to greet me. Oh, and Laine,� Hayley eyed her new submissive, �best you wear something lovely and sexy for me this evening. I like tight, small. Black is good. I like black on white. You&#8217;ve got such lovely pale skin, the sort of skin that glows so nicely when it&#8217;s whipped harshly and turns that beautiful shade of red. I really do like black on white, and for that matter, black on red too. Black dominates white. Certainly in this case it does, anyhow. Please do not disappoint, or there will be repercussions. Am I clear on this, Laine, my love?�
Laine raised her eyes to look at her new boss, �yes� yes, Miss� I think it&#8217;s clear��
�Hmmm seems you&#8217;ve forgotten already how to address me correctly. Dominae. Nothing less will do, thank you, Laine, darling. Don&#8217;t you worry, you&#8217;ll soon get the hang of it. It&#8217;s merely a matter of a bit more time. I&#8217;m certain you&#8217;ll be just perfect as a little whore to your new black Dominae. Am I right?� Hayley glared at Laine.
Laine nodded. 
�Okay, you&#8217;re already starting to get the idea. Honey, I&#8217;ll see you tonight at 7. Please, do not be late, will you? You don&#8217;t want to keep me waiting, not at any cost.� Hayley laughed. She blew Laine a kiss. �Bye for now baby. Catch up with you soon. Be good.� She marched out of Laine&#8217;s office, leaving the door open behind her. 
Laine sat staring through the open door. 
Did that really just happen, or was it a bad dream? I can&#8217;t believe it. What have I done to deserve this? It&#8217;s not just a bad dream, it&#8217;s a fucking nightmare! Fuck, I better start making some arrangements for the bitch from hell. Fuck! 
Laine picked up her office phone. �Beth, please, can you come in, I need you to take some details down. There&#8217;s much to be done, no time to lose, thanks.�
Beth knocked on the open door.
�Yeah, yeah, come in Beth. Close the door behind you, will you. And take a seat.�
Beth did as she was asked. �Laine, are you okay? You seem rather flushed.�
�I&#8217;m fine, thanks Beth. Don&#8217;t worry about me. I&#8217;m fine. Now please, can you note down the following.�
�Okay boss, shoot.�
�One &#8211; can you draw up a contract for Miss McArthur. She&#8217;ll be joining us this coming Monday. As senior sales. Her title will be senior sales manager.�
�But Laine, what about Natalie? She&#8217;s senior. She&#8217;s been with us now for the past 3 years. She&#8217;s not going to be at all happy.�
�Beth, please just do as I say. There&#8217;s no time for dialogue, thank you.�
�As you wish, Laine.�
�Two &#8211; the new lady, Miss McArthur, is to be paid 70 thousand basic. 25 percent commission on sales.�
�What? You can&#8217;t! It&#8217;s not possible. That&#8217;s far more than anyone is on. How can we afford that? How can you afford that?�
�Please, again, Beth, don&#8217;t ask. Just take notes and sort it.�
Beth nodded. �Okay Laine. I just don&#8217;t know how you&#8217;re going to cover this though. Is she really that good, this girl?�
Laine eyed her secretary. �Yeah, yes� she&#8217;s good, Beth. She&#8217;s very good. I think she&#8217;s going to turn our fortunes around. And yeah, I know she&#8217;s asking a lot. But she&#8217;s that good. So yes, I&#8217;ll pay her 70 plus 25 percent on top. It&#8217;s fine. She&#8217;ll be good for us.�
�Okay Laine. I just hope you know what you&#8217;re doing here.�
�Three &#8211; she needs the office next door. Plus, get us some nice furnishings. Walnut office desk. Large. Nice chair. The works. You know��
�Okay��
�Four &#8211; now please, don&#8217;t question me on this. Please��
�What is it, boss?�
Laine looked down at her desk. �She needs a company car.�
�She what? But� no-one has a company car. In the good old days, yes, but not now. Are you sure?�
�Beth, please, note it.�
�Okay Laine, if you must. What sort of car? Let me guess� a Porsche 911 Carrera. How much is that gonna be? About, hmmm� only about� 80 thousand quid or something��
�Actually, no. She wants an Audi R8. The coupe.�
�Oh shit. Sorry? Are you joking? Laine�? That&#8217;s probably gonna be even more expensive than the damn Porsche.�
�Beth, please, just do it. No more questions.�
Beth made some notes.
�Now fifth, mobile and laptop. Have we got anything available?�
�Yes, we&#8217;ve got a spare S4. And we&#8217;ve got an Asus N550.�
�Can we get the Galaxy S5? And Apple. Get a MacBook Pro.�
�Laine, the Pro costs almost 2 grand. Are you sure?�
�Beth, just do it. Stop with the questions.�
�Okay, okay. I&#8217;m just worried. This� this� this little black girl waltzes into your office, late for her interview, I may add, and yet she&#8217;s got you eating out of her damn hand. What&#8217;s going on, Laine?�
�Nothing&#8217;s going on Beth. It&#8217;s just the way it is. She&#8217;s very good. I want her. I� we� we need her. Don&#8217;t you understand that? Don&#8217;t you? If we don&#8217;t get some fresh blood into this place, we&#8217;re going to sink. We don&#8217;t have any choice. It&#8217;s as simple as that. I can&#8217;t keep pouring funds in. Funds that I no longer have. What do you expect me to do, Beth?�
�Okay, okay, okay��
�Fine then, we understand the situation now, do we? I hope so. I can&#8217;t keep repeating this to you. And lastly�� Laine hesitated.
Beth looked up� �Laine?�
�Yes� lastly� Lastly� she needs a personal secretary.�
�She needs a personal secretary? But why? She&#8217;s a sales girl. A trumped-up sales girl, yes, but a sales girl all the same. Laine�?�
�Beth, it&#8217;s my decision. She needs a personal secretary. And Beth�� Laine looked at Beth.
Beth looked back. �Yeah? Laine?�
�Beth, don&#8217;t get me wrong, okay?�
�What is it Laine?� Beth looked quizzical.
�Well� her secretary has to be� sort of� you know� um� nice.�
�What do you mean, &#8216;nice&#8217;?�
�Nice, like sort of� sexy nice.� Laine dropped her gaze.
�Sexy nice? What? Sexy nice? What are you talking about, Laine? What is &#8216;sexy nice&#8217;?�
�You know, Beth. Nice. Sweet. Pretty.�
�Nice, sweet, and pretty?�
�Yes, that&#8217;s right. Pretty. Sexy. You know what sexy means, don&#8217;t you?� Laine looked exasperated.
�I know what sexy means, but what&#8217;s that got to do with our line of work? What&#8217;s that got to do with a trumped-up sales girl who&#8217;s just marched off the street and suddenly it seems she owns the damn place?�
�Beth! Don&#8217;t! Please don&#8217;t. She needs a pretty secretary, and that&#8217;s the end of the matter.�
�Okay,� Beth sighed. �So who are you thinking about? How about you, Laine, you&#8217;re pretty, sexy�� Beth smiled.
�Beth, don&#8217;t you dare!� Laine growled. �This� this� this girl is just��
�Just what, Laine? Just way too much? Is that what you&#8217;re sayin&#8217;?�
Beth sighed deeply. �She&#8217;s just� She want&#8217;s� sexy. She wants a pretty secretary. I don&#8217;t know why, she just does.�
�Fine. Who do you want to assign to her then? Tell me. I&#8217;m all ears, Laine.�
�How about Kiara? Think she can deal with� with the situation okay?�
�Nope. I don&#8217;t think anyone in the whole world could deal with this situation, Laine.�
�Kiara&#8217;s very pretty though. She&#8217;s� sexy. She dresses sexy, even though I&#8217;ve told her often not to over-do it. What do you think? Beth, please, tell me. What do you think?�
�Fine then. I&#8217;ll assign Kiara to this� person. If that&#8217;s what you wish, that is what you will get. Who&#8217;s going to do Kiara&#8217;s job though?�
�Help me out a bit here Beth. Can&#8217;t you take on some of her responsibilities? Just for a short while. Once Miss McArthur is earning good money for us, we&#8217;ll bring in someone else. In fact, we&#8217;ll start building our staff all over. I envisage having 10 new staff within 18 months, providing that Miss McArthur performs as I expect she will.�
�Laine, it&#8217;s your call. I can&#8217;t say I agree with anything you&#8217;re telling me. But it&#8217;s your call. If you want me to assume Kiara&#8217;s responsibilities for a little time, then fine. I&#8217;ll do my very best. I always have, for you, and I always will. You know that.�
�I know Beth. You&#8217;re an excellent employee, and a good friend too. I wish that I could reward you so much better than I am doing now. But, bear with me. I&#8217;ll see you right soon enough. I promise you. Once the money begins to discover us, as it will, then you&#8217;ll be duly rewarded, and more, for all your efforts. I promise you Beth, I really do.�
�Hmmm� I&#8217;m not here for the money Laine, and you know that. I&#8217;m here because I love my job. I love working for you. You&#8217;re my best friend, best employer I&#8217;ve ever had. Simple as that. But I must say Laine, I am worried about this� this� woman. She&#8217;s so young. She&#8217;s rude. Aggressive. She&#8217;s also got you eating out of her rear end, pardon me for saying so.�
�Beth! How could you say that? You have to understand, as I keep telling you, she&#8217;s going to change the landscape for us. She&#8217;s going to bring in the capital that we so desperately need. It will change everything.�
�It will change everything Laine, but probably not in a good way. Who does she think she is?�
�She is who she is. That&#8217;s it.�
�She&#8217;s a bitch, and that&#8217;s it, Laine. Simple as that. A stuck up bitch!�
�Beth, stop. I don&#8217;t want to hear anymore. Kiara will do nicely. Can you inform her of her new work role, please. And Beth, do try to be subtle with regards to the &#8216;sexy&#8217; thing. I don&#8217;t want the word getting out about that.�
�How can I be subtle about it, Laine? What will happen when, if� if Kiara turns up on Monday wearing a tiny little skirt, suspenders, high heels, and luscious lipstick, with her hair tied back in ponytails? What are the other staff going to say? What if Kiara says &#8216;no&#8217;? She may well say no. Then what?�
�Offer her a raise, Beth. Tell her that if she does this, she&#8217;ll get a raise.�
�How much? How can you afford it?�
�I can afford it. She� Miss McArthur will see us right there. We can afford it. Don&#8217;t you be worried about that.�
�Okay, so you can afford the raise. How much?�
�I dunno. 4.�
�4? As in 4 pounds?�
�Beth, you know what I mean. 4 thousand.�
�4 thousand it is then. But what about the other thing?�
�Yes, I know. Let me think��
�Best you think fast Laine.�
�How&#8217;s this? From now on, we allow staff discrepancy for work-wear. They can choose what to wear to work. Furthermore��
�I&#8217;m listening��
�Furthermore, we wish to encourage a certain level of flamboyancy within the work place. Say that. We need more� more� style. More sensuality. More� warmth��
�Warmth? What, like a duffel coat and mittens?�
�You know what I mean. Damn it Beth, you&#8217;re always the one to be pushing me, aren&#8217;t you!�
�Sorry. I don&#8217;t mean to. I can see your hands are tied. So� I tell them that they need� that they can� choose more, how to put it� attractive clothing from now onwards, right?�
�Yeah.�
�And that goes for me too, does it?�
�Yes, you too.�
�Beth, I&#8217;m pushing 50 for God&#8217;s sake. And you want me to go all sexy. What?�
�Just do what you&#8217;re told for once, Bethany!�
�Okay then, sexy it is. I have no idea what my husband&#8217;s going to think about this. He&#8217;ll think I&#8217;ve gone mad. Really, Laine. But okay, if that&#8217;s what you want, then that&#8217;s what I&#8217;ll do. I wouldn&#8217;t do this for anyone else. You do realize that, don&#8217;t you?�
�Of course, I do. I appreciate it. I really do.�
Beth nodded. �Okay, let&#8217;s see what I can do. I&#8217;ll have to cast a few spells around the place. Not sure how the girls are going to take to this. It&#8217;s odd. Very odd.�
�Do your best Beth. Do your best. Oh, and can you get me the girl&#8217;s current address please? I need to get a taxi for her. Is she close to my place?�
�Yeah, about 15 minute drive, if traffic isn&#8217;t too heavy.�
�Okay, so say 6.40 tonight. Get a cab to her place for 6.40.�
�You&#8217;re meeting up, tonight?�
�Yes, she&#8217;s coming round to my place so I can instruct her further on her new duties,� Laine looked out the window, unwilling to meet her employee&#8217;s quizzical gaze.
�Laine, what&#8217;s going on?�
�What do you mean?�
�You looked away when you said that. Means you&#8217;re hiding something from me. What is it?�
�Nothing. Nothing at all. Never mind.�
�Tell me, Laine, what&#8217;s going on��
Laine slowly turned back to face Beth.
�Beth, I don&#8217;t have a choice, right? I need this girl. She&#8217;s going to save my� our company. That&#8217;s it. That&#8217;s all.�
�That&#8217;s all? Something&#8217;s up? Laine, I&#8217;ve known you for, what, 10 years almost? I&#8217;ve helped you to build this company up from the roots. I&#8217;ve been there. All this time. Don&#8217;t lie to me, Laine. What&#8217;s going on here?�
Laine sighed deeply. �Beth, she knows about the company. She knows it&#8217;s going to go under. Plus, Beth, she knows about me. About my� my pleasures. She knows.�
�And she&#8217;s blackmailing you into all this, is she?�
Laine eyed Beth. �Yes. And there&#8217;s nothing I can do� As you just said, my hands are tightly tied, and there&#8217;s nothing I can do��






Chapter 2


Laine returned home at just after 6. 
It had been a difficult day at work, and she just wanted to wash, do some quick dinner, grab a bottle of wine, then flop in front of the television. That however, was not an option. She had other matters to contend with.
Shit, so much to do, not enough time to do it. That fucking bitch will be here in less than an hour. How the hell did I get myself into this mess? How?
Laine quickly tidied her grandiose apartment. She then showered. 
This� this� creature� she wants me in black. What do I have? Not a lot. Black is not entirely my colour. 
She emerged from the shower, wrapping a towel tightly around her long blonde hair and grabbing a white bath robe from the hook behind the bathroom door. She walked through to her bedroom and opened the door to her expansive wardrobe. 
Black� black� what do I have� Ah, this will probably do�
She picked out a black baby doll negligee and threw it on the bed.
Underwear? Will she want me to wear underwear? The baby doll will have to do. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ve got any black underwear. Shit! 
Next, she sat down at her dresser, removing the towel wrap from her hair and casting it onto the bed. She checked the time.
Damn, it&#8217;s 6.35 already. She&#8217;ll be here in the next 25 minutes. Damn it! I do hope she&#8217;s late again.
Laine grabbed her hair dryer and ran the warm air through her long golden hair, stroking it roughly with her free hand. 
After drying her hair, she picked up the brightest red lipstick she could find on her dresser and pushed it to her lips. 
The intercom buzzed. 
Oh shit! Not yet. I&#8217;m not ready�
She jumped up from her dresser, snatching the black baby doll from the bed, and ran to the front door. She pressed the intercom.
�Hello?�
�Let me in. Don&#8217;t keep me waiting here, stupid!�
Laine pressed another button, allowing her guest to enter the main building. She opened her front door and donned the baby doll, pulling it tightly around her overly large bust in an effort to hide herself from unwanted attention.
�As if this is going to help me,� she mumbled to herself. �That girl will rip this thing to shreds in an instant.�
She heard the elevator door open at the other end of the hallway.
Here we go then, the journey to hell. Brace yourself, Laine. This is not going to be an easy ride.
She peered around her door, eyeing the petite beauty walking towards her.
She might be a proper bitch, but she&#8217;s extremely hot. Such a cute little thing. So dominant and powerful. 
Laine opened the door wide to allow her guest access.
�Miss McArthur, you have other belongings?�
�Nope. Just this single suitcase. I like to travel light. No need for a mountain of clothing and all the rest of it. It&#8217;s pointless. However, Laine, now I&#8217;m here, I think we need to find me a new wardrobe, don&#8217;t you think so?� Hayley eyed her new submissive. �Oh, and didn&#8217;t I tell you� it&#8217;s Dominae to you, not Hayley. Only my friends get to call me Hayley, and you, Laine, are certainly not my friend. Not yet, anyhow. Now let&#8217;s have a look at you girl. I want to check out the goods and see what you&#8217;re really made of.�
Laine closed the door quietly and turned to face her newly acquired resident. 
Hayley rested her single suitcase against the hallway wall. 
�I like this. I like your little negligee. It&#8217;s pretty, sexy. You look good. And� no underwear, huh? Okay for now. That&#8217;s fine. Don&#8217;t you have any little black panties to wear though, Laine? Or how about a thong? G-strings? I do like my girls in sexy stuff. Silk is nice. Don&#8217;t you have some silk for your beautiful Dominae? You and I, we need to get silk. Silk is so nice, soft, and it smells so good once it&#8217;s been up inside there for a bit.� Hayley pointed towards Laine&#8217;s neatly trimmed pussy.
�I� I don&#8217;t� I don&#8217;t usually go in for black� sorry��
�You don&#8217;t usually go in for black? What, you don&#8217;t find me attractive? Is that it?� Hayley glared at Laine.
�No� no� it&#8217;s not that. I do� emmm� I do think you are pretty. It&#8217;s just that I, well, I just don&#8217;t have much black clothing, other than business wear, of course.�
�Changes have to be made then. That&#8217;s not acceptable. From now on, black is the colour, although I do rather like luscious pink. I like luscious pink skin, just like yours is, Laine, and I like luscious pink underwear. We&#8217;ll get some tomorrow. No need to worry about it. Now turn and bend over.�
�� bend?�
�Yah, bend over darling. Let&#8217;s see what you&#8217;ve got round the rear end. Obviously what you&#8217;ve got now belongs to me. I need to check it out. Too much to ask, is it?�
Laine hesitated. �Miss McArthur, this is not exactly appropriate. I&#8217;m not that sort of girl. I don&#8217;t��
Hayley interrupted. �You don&#8217;t what, Laine? You don&#8217;t remember how to address your new Mistress fittingly. What else, darling Laine? You don&#8217;t know how to let me check you over? Well, let me show you. It&#8217;s not difficult, really.� Hayley grabbed hold of Laine&#8217;s long blonde hair with both hands and pulled down hard.
�Agggghhh!�
�Painful, darling? Best you do what you&#8217;re told, then we wouldn&#8217;t have to resort to such silly behaviour. What you say about that, my love?�
�It&#8217;s� you&#8217;re hurting me� please��
�Please? Please? Best get used to it, honey. Welcome to your new life. Seems you&#8217;ve a lot to learn. But don&#8217;t you be worryin&#8217;. I got you covered. See, I&#8217;m a real good teacher. Yah, I&#8217;m still young, and I&#8217;m just a little smaller than you, that may well be, but I&#8217;ve got lots of experience. So I is a darn good teacher. Don&#8217;t you be worryin&#8217; that lovely head of yours. I&#8217;ll make sure you know exactly how it&#8217;s going to be from now onwards. Now stop whimpering. Let me check out my new assets.�
Hayley relinquished her grip on Laine&#8217;s hair. �Now turn around, bend over, and spread them! I need access. Spread your feet! And pull your sweet little black number up too.�
Laine did as she was told. She gingerly turned around and bent over, hoisting her baby doll negligee up above her waist, then supporting herself by placing her hands on the wall in front of her.
�Spread your feet a bit wider, cherub, there&#8217;s a good girl.� Hayley reached down with her left hand and began to massage Laine&#8217;s vagina. �Hmmm� seems you&#8217;re wet for me, honey. Seems you do like black after all. So you been lying to me. I think we&#8217;ll get along well, you and I. As long as you don&#8217;t be no lying bitch. Hmmm� nice. Very nice. Your pussy&#8217;s drippin&#8217;. Now� how about that butt of yours. Ever been butt fucked, Laine?�
�� pardon� pardon me. Ohhhhhh� Please don&#8217;t. I� I can&#8217;t�� Laine felt her knees buckle. The attention on her pussy was already making her feel weak. 
�You can&#8217;t, or you won&#8217;t? Either way, won&#8217;t and can&#8217;t are no longer words that belong within your vocabulary, honey. Let&#8217;s get things straight from the get-go. This is easy. All that I want is that you maintain your focus on your new Dominae and do exactly as she instructs. It&#8217;s not too much to ask, is it?�
�Hayley. Please. Sorry�. Ooooooo��
�Who Hayley? Who is Hayley? Seems your memory is lacking.� The petite black girl continued to massage Laine&#8217;s vagina. She lowered her other hand and prodded her fingers at Laine&#8217;s upturned rose bud. �Shit, I mean girl. Seems you ain&#8217;t had no action in here. It&#8217;s just way too tight. I can&#8217;t even get two fingers in here. What you expecting from me? There&#8217;s lots of changes need to be made. This simply is not good enough. We&#8217;ll have to do something about this poop hole of yours. It&#8217;s way too tight. Don&#8217;t you think so? Got a cucumber in the fridge that I can be using to get us off to a good start, have you?�
�Dominae�? Sorry� I� Hayley� please�.�
�Oh do stop that blabberin&#8217;. You&#8217;re my cunt now. That&#8217;s the way it is. No choice. You&#8217;re a disaster. Your company is a disaster. I&#8217;ll be changing that. Isn&#8217;t that what you want? Don&#8217;t you want me to assume control of your company? Don&#8217;t you want that I sort out your problems? Or you prefer to be cleaning toilets for the rest of your days? Laine� you&#8217;re late 40&#8217;s. You&#8217;re not no spring chicken any longer. It&#8217;s time you had some home help. Time to put that stupid little company of yours back in order. You&#8217;re pathetic. Really� pathetic.�
Tears began to drip from Laine&#8217;s eyes. She&#8217;d never been so humiliated in all her life. And of all things, to be humiliated by a girl that was less than half her age. And a black girl at that.
�Okay, never mind for now. We&#8217;ll continue with the fun later on. I&#8217;m famished. What you got to eat in this place of yours? Something nice I hope. Something delicious. Got pizza? I fancy pizza. I&#8217;m a Margherita fan myself. Don&#8217;t go in for the meat much. Well, okay, that&#8217;s not quite true. I love white meat. It&#8217;s just so tender. Supple. And I love how it turns so beautifully red when it&#8217;s thrashed. Didn&#8217;t I tell you that before though? Sorry, I surely did. Not that I wish to bore you, Laine, my lover, but may as well plant the thought into that little brain of yours. There&#8217;s gonna be a whole lot of red skin on your body from now on in, you can bet your sweet little life on it! Now, do you have pizza or not?�
Hayley removed her fingers from Laine&#8217;s nether regions. �Here have a taste, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll love it. So flavourful, I bet.�
Laine remained with her hands against the wall, feet spread widely apart. 
�White girl, did you not hear your new Mistress? I said taste em&#8217;.�
Laine took her hands off the wall and rose upright, brushing her baby doll negligee down over her hips. She turned to face her tormentor, towering above her. 
�You are a tall girl, aren&#8217;t you, my lovely. How tall are you anyway?�
�� I&#8217;m� I��
�Oh for goodness sakes, stop that whimpering. Cry baby! Fuck. You&#8217;re a grown woman. You should be ashamed of yourself, really. Pull yourself together. It&#8217;s okay, Dominae will take good care of you. I promise, I will. There&#8217;s no need to doubt it. Baby, come, don&#8217;t cry. It&#8217;s okay, there, there. Let mommy hold you tight.�
Hayley stepped forward and grabbed Laine around the waist with both arms. She pulled her in tightly and began to rock gently, back and forth. 
�See? Your Dominae will make a fantastic mom for her Laine. No need to worry, Dominae will take such good care of her baby Laine. It&#8217;s going to be okay. It&#8217;s going to be so much better from now. You&#8217;ll have nothing at all to worry about. All your problems will be gone soon enough. I promise you. I&#8217;ll take care of you, darling.�
Laine found herself feeling comforted by the younger girl&#8217;s affection. Not only comforted, but aroused. Deeply aroused. 
�Now baby,� Hayley maintained her tight grasp around Laine&#8217;s waist, �Dominae is hungry. If you got pizza, it&#8217;s a green light. We stay in and eat. If no pizza, we go out and get some. Got pizza?�
Laine nodded, trying to regain some level of composure. �Yes� yeah� I&#8217;ve got some pizza in the freezer, Dominae. Is that any good?�
�Great! That&#8217;s great! Cheesy pizza, is it?�
�Yes, I have cheese pizza. Marks and Spencers.�
�Lovely. I love their pizza! Seems like you know me already, even though we&#8217;ve just met. See, I told you Laine, we is gonna be great girls together you and me. Friends, lovers, you name it� So, be a good girl, go sort out the pizza, and while you&#8217;re at it, grab us a bottle of wine, will ya? White is just fine. How about a Pinot Grigio or something?�
�Sorry� I� well� I don&#8217;t have Pinot Grigio. Is Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc good?�
�If it&#8217;s white and it&#8217;s sweet, sweet as I am, then I&#8217;m good for it, baby.�
�It&#8217;s a fruity wine, from New Zealand. I think you&#8217;ll like it. A little like Pinot Grigio.�
�Sounds perfect. Now go, go get us some grub and some fine wine. Let&#8217;s enjoy. Once that&#8217;s done, you can show me around my new place. Might need to make some changes here and there, you know, just to get the d�cor how I like it.�
Hayley released her grasp on Laine. Laine turned to make her way into the kitchen. Hayley slapped her buttocks. �Wow, those are so gorgeous, babes. You got yourself some great assets going on there, so you have. For a woman of your mature years, you certainly is in mighty fine shape, sista!�
�Th� well em, thanks� thank you� Dominae.�



********



25 minute later, Laine entered the living room with freshly cooked pizza and two large glasses of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc. 
�There, I put extra cheese on the pizza, since you like cheese. I added some mozzarella, Isle of Mull Cheddar cheese, and a little jalapeno to make it a tad bit more spicy. Do you like jalapeno, Dominae?�
�Yeah, I love it. I love hot and spicy food, just as I like hot and spicy girls, Laine. Are you hot and spicy, darling?� Hayley looked up from the settee where she was sprawled lengthwise. 
�Emmm� I wouldn&#8217;t really go that far, no. I like spicy food though. I like jalapeno.�
�Yeah, but I don&#8217;t mean spicy as in food honey. I mean spicy and hot in sex, huh?�
�Well� emmm� I don&#8217;t really know.�
�Honey, I guess you&#8217;re not yet familiar, right? I mean, your butt hole is so tight that you couldn&#8217;t even get a lubed up 3 incher in there. It&#8217;s just way too tight. We gotta fix that though. I got just the right thing in mind too. We really need to get us some gear. I was thinking big. Like 10 or 12 inches of rock hard rubber. Some real pro flesh-biting whips. I just love to see those sort of markings on white skin. I mean, you should have seen my last girl. Her butt was so beaten with my whip she couldn&#8217;t sit down for a week without flinching. It&#8217;s just so hot! I love that. Ah, anyway, I got a couple of whips in my suitcase. I do travel light, but I always like to carry my whips. Best friends we are, me and my lashes. But I do need some extras in the cock area. I think that bitch of mine stole some of my bigger ones. I had a whole collection of them, ranging from small to whopping huge throbbing sons of bitches.�
�You� you did this with another girl?�
�You bet I did. Course I did. Fuck! Course I did. My last bitch was at Geneva&#8217;s. She was gagging for it every day. I used to beat her senseless. Such a stupid cow she was. But she used to take everything I gave to her without a whimper. I got bored though. She was just too easy. Too tame. I&#8217;m looking for something a little bit more� well� jalapeno-ish, if you like, more spicy, hot. Know?�
�And� you really feel that� you know� that I&#8217;m� spicy?� Laine flushed.
�Hey darling, put that stuff on the table here will ya.� Hayley motioned towards a small table just in front of where she was stretched out on the settee. �Feels like I could eat a horse. And hand me that wine. Let&#8217;s you and I get down to some serious drinkin&#8217;. I think you could do with some relaxation therapy, and wine is a great antidote for that, right?�
�Yes� yes, it is, right.� Laine rested the tray on the table and handed Hayley her wine glass.
�Salut, sweetie, here&#8217;s to a very fruitful and loving relationship.� Hayley held her glass up.
Laine did likewise. �To a fruitful relationship.�
Hayley gulped at her wine, while Laine merely sipped.
�Shit, this is good stuff, honey. Hope you got more of it cos I sense we&#8217;ll be needin&#8217; it. Try to keep up with me though, I don&#8217;t like to drink alone. Go on, drink more, be a good girl.�
Laine raised her glass to her lips and swigged.
�That&#8217;s better. So you like your wine, do you? Is that your penchant?�
�Yes, yes I do Dominae. I like wine. Helps me to relax after a hard days work.�
�A hard day&#8217;s work where you accomplish so little. How did you manage to let the company get into such a mess, Laine? That was your baby, yet you&#8217;ve not cherished it how it needs to be cherished. And what the hell are the rest of the staff doing? Pissing around all day sending text messages to their lovers and playing games on the fucking computer, or what?�
�Well, you know, it&#8217;s the economy. It&#8217;s a mess. It&#8217;s made a mess of what we had. We were doing really well just a few years back. Now, it&#8217;s a bit of a different story. Dominae�?�
�Yes baby?� Hayley looked up at Laine.
�Do you� do you really think you can� you know� you can turn things around, for me, for us� I mean, for you too, of course. Do you?�
�Yup. I can, and I will. Don&#8217;t doubt me. I turned over almost two million in a single year with Geneva. And I&#8217;ll do better with our company, my company. I have the motivation. I have the drive. I have the contacts. I have everything. Not to worry pet. I&#8217;ll do the goods, and it will not take long either. You&#8217;ll soon see the coffers filling up once more. Are you intent on bringing in fresh blood? Other than myself, of course.�
�That would be so great. I&#8217;d love to see the company thrive again, like it was thriving before. And yes, I think we should bring on new staff, as and when we&#8217;re ready to do so. Do you agree?�
�Well babes, I already have a meet with Dawsons. Dawsons Estate agent. They&#8217;re looking for some guidance on a new venture. I think it will be a biggie. I know the managing director personally. She&#8217;s an old flame of mine, if you wish to put it that way.� Hayley giggled.
�Flame?� Laine asked.
�Flame as in, I used to flame her ass. She was a right slut that one. All high and fuckin&#8217; mighty, like these sort are. But when I had her under the whip, she&#8217;d become a totally different story. She&#8217;d shriek, scream, howl, you name it, and she&#8217;d do it. I really loved thrashing her jugs though. Her jugs are so big, so white, peachy white. A bit like yours, actually. Well, she loved having her assets beaten till they were red as the reddest rose. I&#8217;m tellin&#8217; ya. She was the near-perfect subordinate. Had her at my feet on an almost daily basis.�
�So� so you are saying that you&#8217;re sure you can get Dawson&#8217;s in on the deal?�
�Yup, that&#8217;s exactly what I&#8217;m sayin&#8217; baby. I got that bitch wantin&#8217; for more. She&#8217;s so hot, too hot to handle for most girls. But to me, she&#8217;s like a fly on the wall when you swat it. She crumbles when she&#8217;s in the vicinity of power. And I&#8217;m power. I&#8217;m pure power. She never stood a chance with me, and she&#8217;ll not stand a chance when I meet her again this coming Thursday.�
�So soon? But I thought you wanted to begin on Monday. I&#8217;ve got your contract being drawn up for Monday. Sorry, I thought��
�Doesn&#8217;t matter. Here, let&#8217;s eat a bit. That pizza smells awesome.�
Hayley grabbed a slice of pizza. �What cheese did you say you added to this?�
�Mozzarella and Isle of Mull Cheddar. They work so well together. The mozzarella is so subtle with regards to flavour, while the cheddar is strong, smoky, vibrant.�
�Strong, smoky, and vibrant? Sounds like me then. Maybe that&#8217;s why I love the aroma so much.� Hayley laughed as she munched heartily on her pizza. 
Laine also picked up a slice and began to eat. She&#8217;d not eaten since early morning and she was famished. 
�You know, you got a real nice place here, Laine. I&#8217;m really lookin&#8217; forward to living here. Needs a few changes, but you&#8217;ve done it out fine. You&#8217;ve not only got taste in d�cor, but you&#8217;ve got taste in your women too. Namely me. Come, get comfy with me. Don&#8217;t leave me all alone on this here big ol&#8217; seat of yours. Plenty of space for the both of us.�
Laine joined Hayley on the settee. 
�See, I ain&#8217;t such a bitch as you thought. Am I right? I&#8217;m very loving, devoted, kind hearted. Sure, I&#8217;m strong, powerful, wicked at times. I do what it takes. I like to control, to be in control, at all times. I don&#8217;t like feebleness. Can&#8217;t stand it. Feeble girls must be disciplined. Disciplined with a fine level of harshness. That&#8217;s what they require. That&#8217;s what you require, Laine. Someone who is going to take total control, not only of your feeble little company, but also of your life. And that&#8217;s why I&#8217;m here. I&#8217;m that girl. I&#8217;m the ultimate in dominatrix-ability. I like to walk into a room and watch all the girls quiver in my presence. That&#8217;s the way it has to be for me. And that&#8217;s how I&#8217;m going to revive our company, my company. Simple mathematics, really. Simple equation. You provide what people want, and in return, they give you what you want. Seems you&#8217;ve not been doing that. And don&#8217;t give me this shit about a bad economy. It&#8217;s got nothing to do with the economy. It&#8217;s all to do with control. Control equates to power. Power equates to getting what you want in life. Surely you know that. So I don&#8217;t quite get it how you&#8217;ve managed to let my company sink to its&#8217; knees. You&#8217;ve failed. Time to move over. Let me handle things from now onwards. That&#8217;s what I do, and that&#8217;s what I do best. Not to worry though darling, I&#8217;ll remain discreet. You may still act as the head girl. For now. After all, we don&#8217;t want to be upsetting the apple cart too much just yet.� Hayley reached over and helped herself to another slice of pizza. �Damn, this is good stuff. You&#8217;re a fine cook, Laine. Ever thought about taking up that occupation instead?�
�I&#8217;d love to, Dominae. Not sure how to break into it though. Plus, at my age��
�At your age? I watch that Masterchef programme all the time and there&#8217;s plenty of folk at your age wanting to get into the industry. Let&#8217;s keep our focus though. We, I, need to turn this little puny company around first, then we can think about branching out a bit. First up, is that hussy over at Dawsons. She&#8217;ll be a snap. I&#8217;m seeing us gettin&#8217; in on a million contract for starters with that bitch at the helm. She&#8217;s pathetic. A worm. So easy to get. After that, I heard that the MacDonald&#8217;s are looking for more action. Not the food Franchise. How I wish it. No, that housing development company. Know the one I mean?�
�Yes, isn&#8217;t that where Linda Barnes is the lead?�
�Linda Barnes. What a fuckin&#8217; tramp she is. I&#8217;ve had dealings with her before when I was at Genevas. She&#8217;s a hottie. She&#8217;s temperamental as fuck. Doesn&#8217;t stand for no bullshit, that one. But I fully intend to give her a run for her money, and a hell of a lot more besides. I heard that they&#8217;re looking for just over 6 million. Think you can handle that, Laine?�
�6 million? Oh my. That&#8217;s huge! 6 million? Let me drink more wine please, Dominae. I think I need it.�
Hayley laughed. �There&#8217;s a whole lot more where that will come from, I&#8217;m tellin&#8217; ya. This is just for starters. When I get that dumb ass cow at Dawsons, and if I can get the Barnes woman too, which I will, of course, word will go out about us, about me. It&#8217;s that simple. It&#8217;s simple maths, really, as I said to you. I was never any good at maths, but at school they make it so damn difficult. In real life, it&#8217;s so much easier. I&#8217;ll set up something with that Barnes woman for early next week. I want her in the bag. I want them all in the bag. They&#8217;re just sittin&#8217; waiting for someone like me to clear up their mess. It&#8217;s an easy poach when you know how and you have the POWER.�
 �That would be amazing, really. Totally amazing. I&#8217;d love to see how you do it.� Laine finished her glass of Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc, feeling more confident about herself. �Here, want more wine? Let&#8217;s drink. Let&#8217;s eat. Let&#8217;s enjoy.�
�Don&#8217;t mind if I do, girl. You&#8217;re a great hostess. And you and me, we&#8217;re gonna do some fantastic business over the next few months. Mark my words. As a matter of fact, you should come to the Dawsons meeting with me. I&#8217;ll show you just how effective I am with a pipsqueak like that Mathews woman. She&#8217;ll be gagging for it. I&#8217;ll show you.�
�Can I? Is that okay, Dominae? I&#8217;d love to, really, I would.� Laine picked up the wine and filled Hayley&#8217;s glass to the brim.
�Wow, trying to get me totally out of it, honey bunch? Think we need more, the bottle&#8217;s almost done. You go get more, I&#8217;ll take care of this here gorgeous pizza.�
�Yes, yes of course. Is the pizza enough for you? Do you want something else?�
�Gotta take care of my figure, baby. Just like you do too. I would say this is plenty enough for us both. Go get some more wine and make sure your glass is filled. I don&#8217;t want to be the only drunk in this household tonight.�
