� 

�� They had been
married for seven years. It took Terry 3 years to convince his beautiful blonde
wife to try swinging. Diana was so beautiful and took very good care of her
twenty-six-year-old body. 

&nbsp;

� Diana was a trophy
wife that any man would be proud to have. Terry was waiting for his wife to
finish dressing for their first night at the club they had joined. It was a
swinger�s club for white couples who enjoyed a little spice in their life.

&nbsp;

� Diana walked out
of the bedroom wearing her new green dress which barely covered her huge white
breasts. Terry smiled at his wife as he looked her up and down and saw how
short the dress was on his wife. 

&nbsp;

� It fit very tight
on her body and enhanced every single curve of her excellent figure. Diana
worked out every day and was very proud of the way she maintained her figure.

&nbsp;

� They drove to the
address that had been given them which took them directly into the city. Terry
had a very hard time locating the address on the large white building that
resembled a warehouse.

&nbsp;

�� Finding a decent
place to park was even tougher as Terry drove around the block several times
until a large black man finally stood in the middle of the street and waived at
them. He said he was they�re to park the cars for the guests to the club. 

&nbsp;

� Terry reluctantly
got out of the car and allowed the huge black man, into the driver�s seat and
watched as the man as the tires squealed as he drove the car away.

&nbsp;

� Diana was standing
on the curb looking at Terry as they watched their car turn the corner. Terry
took hold of his wife�s arm as they walked up to the huge steel door and rang
the bell.

&nbsp;

� The huge door
opened and a small framed black woman greeted them and directed them into the
building. 

&nbsp;

� The black woman
introduced herself as Gloria and said she was the manager of the club and would
be their host for the evenings� event. 

&nbsp;

� Terry was confused
because this was supposed to be an all white club for couples and couldn�t
understand why their host was a black woman.

&nbsp;

� Gloria took their
ID�s and checked out their identity�s while Diana stood holding Terry�s hand
tightly. She was very nervous being at this swinging club tonight and felt the
butterfly�s in her stomach as Gloria stood up and motioned for Diana to follow
her to another room.

&nbsp;

� The huge black man
that parked the car a few minutes ago was waiting to take Terry into the
theater to wait for his wife. 

&nbsp;

� Diana gave her
husband a long passionate kiss as they were separated. Terry glanced back over
his shoulder one last time before the huge black man took him into the theater
and saw Diana smiling and waiving at him.

&nbsp;

� Terry followed the
huge black man down a long dark hallway until they entered another room which
was filled with about twenty white couples. The room wasn�t that huge, only
about the size of a large bedroom except for a small stage with a curtain along
one wall. 

&nbsp;

� Terry followed the
huge black man and smiled at the couples who were starring at him as the black
man directed him to a wooden chair in front of the stage. It looked like one of
those old prison chairs they used to electrocute people.

&nbsp;

�� A very beautiful
blonde walked over and gave Terry a drink and told Terry it would allow him to
relax and to drink it right down. Terry finished the drink which tasted more
like a soft drink.

&nbsp;

� The woman told
Terry to sit in the wooden chair and allow the black man to fasten the straps.
She said that there would be a special show tonight for his enjoyment and
because he was new, he had to be strapped into the chair.

&nbsp;

� �Ah . . . What
about my wife? Isn�t she going to join me?�

&nbsp;

� �Your wife is
being prepared right now for the night�s event. Just sit down and relax and
enjoy the show.�

&nbsp;

� Terry sat in the
chair and waited as the huge black man strapped his ankles to the legs of the
chair followed by his wrists to the arms of the chair. Another strap went
around Terry�s chest which held him firm against the wooden chair.

&nbsp;

� Terry sat in the
chair looking at the red curtain in front of his face wondering what they had
planned for them tonight. He was beginning to worry about Diana and wondered
when she would join him.

&nbsp;

� Terry was
beginning to feel relaxed, just like the woman said he would. His body felt
very weak as he tried to sit straight in the chair. 

&nbsp;

� The huge black man
returned with a device that he attached to the back of the chair which held
Terry�s head straight in line with the curtain in front of him. It was padded
all around and Terry got alarmed as he felt a strap being fitted around his
mouth with a large rubber ball.

&nbsp;

� The black man
forced the huge ball into Terry�s mouth and tightened the strap until the ball
fit tightly inside Terry�s mouth keeping hip from speaking.

&nbsp;

� Terry felt someone
touching his arm and felt a needle being jabbed into his arm near the shoulder.
Terry tried to turn his head but couldn�t. He could only look straight at the
curtain in front of him.��� 

&nbsp;

�� Terry sat in the
chair for more than two hours and heard the couples whispering around him but
could no longer see them because of the way they strapped his head onto the
chair. It had padded blinders on each side of his face which kept him looking
straight toward the curtain.

&nbsp;

� The lights in the
room went dim and the red curtain opened slowly. Everyone in the room sounded
excited that the show was about to begin. Terry looked onto the stage which was
empty as the moment.

&nbsp;

�� Diana woke on a padded table with bright
lights in her eyes, hands working� her
body her naked body, she realized. She was naked, bound to the table at wrists,
throat, waist and ankles by soft velvet straps. 

&quot;Do you have footage of
her being subdued and prepared?&quot; someone, a woman, asked. &quot;Yes,&quot;
was the reply. 

&quot;She's a beauty, isn't
she? Makeup on her nipples. And on her inner labia. I want them to show up well
in the spotlights.&quot; A hand molded her breast, teasing her stiff nipple.
&quot;God, she's beautiful. Not too much morphine, all right? I don't want her
going zombie at the wrong moment. Nice musculature. She's going to be
special.&quot; 

�� A face leaned close, between the bright
lights and her eyes, a pretty black woman. &quot;Well, you're awake. That's
fine. You relax now, and everything is going to be fine. You're going to be
part of our show tonight. Just take it as it comes, and any embarrassment or
discomfort will all come to 
an end soon.&quot; 

��� Diana felt flushed and disoriented. The
greedy mouth at her sex had� ceased to be
a lewd intrusion; she welcomed it, and savored the wash of pleasure from the
woman's deeply lapping tongue at her vulva, the hands stroking her body,
teasing her turgid nipples. She was uncertain where she was, or why;
consciousness came and went. 

��� Bright lights and hands on her body. Her
body had been shaven, nearly every inch of it; manicure and pedicure, her hair
worked into a neat french braid, close to her scalp, exposing her long neck and
the line of her jaw, just so. 

��� Makeup, too, and hands working her
shoulders and arms, massaging. Mouths on her breasts, and the mouth at her sex,
urging her to excitement and pleasure. The suckling at her clitoris was
delicious, and she came gently, again and again, squirming against restraints
she barely acknowledged in her erotic haze. 

�� &quot;Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to our
club. We hope you enjoy our little entertainments tonight. As usual, the doors
have been locked, so please remain seated. The entertainment tonight is, of
course, being filmed for those less fortunate than you. I suggest you remain
seated so 
your face doesn't appear on one of our cameras.&quot; 

&nbsp;

�� Terry sat secured in the wooden chair as he
watched a spot light shining on the center of the stage. Another spot light
illuminated the corner of the stage where Terry saw a long steel shaft.

It was standing straight up
protruding from the floor as if it were on display for a reason.

&nbsp;

� 

�It looked a bit like a jousting lance, and the
foil toward one end was clearly designed to cradle a pelvis once a live person
was impaled. It was fully three inches in diameter, the first foot tapered to a
blunt tip. 

&nbsp;

� Terry saw four huge black men wheeling a
table onto the stage and once they reached the center, they lifted the table up
off its wheels and carefully positioned it toward the audience. 

&nbsp;

� Terry saw that someone was laying on the
table under a white sheet and wondered who it was as his heart began to race
thinking about his wife. The men were working around the table making adjustments
as they removed the white sheet off the person on the table. 

&nbsp;

� Terry gasped as the spot light moved over the
person laying on the table. It was his wife! Diana!
�Her ankles were bound to her thighs, and
her arms were crossed behind her and tied. Two black men restrained her and two
stood by, smiling down at Diana. 

�� The table was tilted up so Diana faced the
audience. Her bonds had been arranged to strain her muscles; her belly,
buttocks and thighs were taut and hard. Her erect nipples and her labia were a
pearly pink, and her entire body had a satiny gleam as if she'd been buffed.
She was beautiful. 

&nbsp;

�� &quot;This is Sandra, ladies and gentlemen.
She's a newlywed bride who has come here tonight for a very special occasson.
Sandra has consented to be impaled on this staff. Sandra's impalement will be
ala Dolcett, that is, the staff will start in her vagina, travel through her
abdomen past her 
viscera, until it reaches her stomach. It will then pierce her stomach, and be
guided through her esophagus, to emerge from her mouth. The &quot;saddle&quot;
at the end of the shaft will carry her pelvis when the shaft is mounted
upright. At that point, Sandra's restraints will be removed and we 
will be able to see how she struggles against her impalement. Please watch
closely, then. We begin.&quot; 

&nbsp;

�� If Diana understood any of that, she didn't
give any indication. Her eyes were dark, a look Terry had seen in intimate
moments, but she didn't seem completely aware of what was going onaround her.
One of her male attendents fetched the staff, swinging the pointed end to one
of the huge black men.. The huge black man leaned over and put one hand in the
middle of her chest, pinning her, the other rubbing the staff against her stiff
nipples.

&nbsp;

Diana squirmed, trying to raise
her head. As the huge black man seemed to be saying something to her; Diana�s
pink tongue came out, awkwardly licking the steel near the tip. Jock spoke to
her again, lifting her head. Diana nodded, looking down, and her full lips
pressed briefly to the end of the shaft. 

&nbsp;

��� The huge black man moved the shaft down and
presented it to her vulva, spreading her lips with two fingers, working the
point against her vulva, then easing it against her vagina, entering her
delicately. The huge black man muttered instructions to another man holding the
far end of the staff, and it began moving into Diana�s belly. When several inches
of the rod were slipped into her vagina, she smiled vacantly, rolling her hips.
Her breasts slipped back and forth on 
her chest, filming with sweat. 

&nbsp;

� For several minutes, the huge man fucked her
with the staff, the tip of it working in and out as he fingered her clit. Diana
stiffened and writhed, breasts rolling back and forth, her big nipples gorged
and dark. She crooned something softly and came. The entire theater was taut
with 
silence. 

&nbsp;

� The huge muscular black man was in control of
the rod, one hand on Diana�s belly and the other on the end entering her body.
The huge man signaled as Diana stiffened in orgasm, and the rod moved inward,
paused, then slipped a foot inside her body. 

&nbsp;

� Terry was straining against his bonds trying
to break free and dislodge the ball from his mouth but it was useless as he sat
there watching the horrific display going on with his wife on the stage in
front of him.

�� Diana screamed and lunged against her bonds,
her entire body taut and straining, her breasts bouncing and quivering. The
huge black man held her shoulders, forcing her back, restraining her. 

�� Diana�
finally subsided to passionate sobbing. A gout of blood welled from her
vagina, and a girl rushed up with a towel, cleaning her quickly, then retiring
from the spotlights. The huge muscular black man signaled again, and the staff
was tilted sharply down at the far end. A point below Diana�s navel bulged, the
point of the staff deep inside her, and Diana squirmed and wailed. 

&nbsp;

��� &quot;Can you see it, ladies and
gentlemen?&quot; Gloria murmured. &quot;It's deep inside her now, 
having pierced her womb.&quot; The shaft was straightened in line with her
spine. The huge muscular black man worked the rod in slowly, pushing Diana�s
body back and forth, probing her belly with one hand, easing the rod in an inch
at a time. 

�� Diana lunged and struggled with each
increment, but it didn't take two minutes to work another foot into her
writhing, naked body. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Ladies and gentlemen, the
tip is past the viscera, and ready to enter Diana�s stomach in the vicinity of
her esophagus. Guided properly, the rod will emerge from her mouth a moment
later. If the man holding the shaft misses, though, it will pierce her heart,
and Diana will die before we want her to. Please watch closely. This is the
critical moment.&quot; ���������������� 

�� The huge muscular black man judged the angle
of her body, judged the angle of the shaft, moved it slightly, then nodded to
the man at the end. A hard push, and another six inches slid into her body.
Diana sobbed, gagged and then shuddered. 


�� The huge black man pulled her forehead
sharply back as the rod began moving smoothly into 
her. Her tongue came out of her mouth just before the point, but her tongue was
only a pink slip as the rod continue moving through her, pushing out of her
mouth until nearly a foot and a half jutted from her lips. 

�� Blood welled around her lips, dripping down
her cheeks. Diana squirmed, her eyes wild, and her teeth clacked against the
shaft with her struggles. Her breasts jounced and swayed wildly, but she was
fully impaled. 

�� It was done. A murmur went through the room,
but nothing more. Despite the mass of the pole passing through her torso, Diana
was clearly alive, squirming and struggling against the horrible invasion. 

�Two of the huge black men lifted her by the
shoulders and the other man anchored the pole in 
a hole in the floor. In an instant, the pole was upright, Diana�s gleaming body
run through and still struggling. The bonds at her feet and hands were quickly
cut free, and the men stood away from her impaled beauty. Diana kicked, and
kicked again. Her hands went to the tip of the rod, trying vainly to dislodge
it. She kicked, one hand sliding to her throat, the other to her belly. San
kicked, her breasts jouncing madly, kicked again. 



�� Her entire body strained, every muscle hard
and defined under her gleaming skin, her nipples standing out from her breasts
like pink lemons. 

�� Then
slowly, she relaxed. Her arms first, slipping to her sides, palms outward; then
her legs, relaxing and opening slightly. Her belly shuddered; her breasts
jumped once, and she was still. 

� Terry looked terrified as he watched his
wife�s lifeless body dangling from the pole in the floor of the stage.

&nbsp;

�� The curtain closed and Terry�s body was
fighting the drugs they had given him. He could hear the couples around him
talking about the show they had just seen.

�

�� Terry felt another needle entering his arm
and within minutes, he was out cold. Another night, another show.
