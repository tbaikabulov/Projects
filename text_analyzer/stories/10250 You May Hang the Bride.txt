Picture this, if you will: 
An outdoor wedding. Folding chairs set up, the groom's friends and relatives on one side of the aisle, the bride's on the other. As often happens, about 20% of the guests consider themselves friends of both and choose a side at random, or based on where their other friends are sitting. Most of the male guests are in the standard suit and tie, and the female guests are in formal dresses. 
Music is provided by a keyboard and amp, while the groom's closest friends act as ushers to help seat the other guests. The groom and best man climb onto the stage and stand on one side of the judge. The groom wears a powder blue tuxedo. The best man and ushers are in slightly darker blue tuxes, the judge of course in a black robe. 
The music changes to a more formal theme as the flower girl walks down the aisle, followed by the bridesmaids in their frilly, pale rose outfits. A short pause, then the matron of honor walks down the aisle in a slightly fancier version. The tension rises, but the guests chatter on. 
A couple of loud chords warn the guests to quiet down, then the music changes to the traditional processional from "Lohengrin". The bride walks slowly down the aisle on her father's arm. She is dressed in the traditional white gown, veil, train, heels, everything the well-dressed bride will wear. 
"Ginny, honey, are you sure you want to go through with this?" Her father whispers. "Your mother and I will stick by you if you change your mind." 
"Yes Father. Thank you very much for your support, but I've decided. It wasn't an easy choice but this is what I want." 
At last they reach the bottom of the aisle and climb the steps to the stage, about three feet off the ground. The bride's mother is weeping openly now as her husband and daughter take up their position on the other side of the judge. The music stops. The guests sit hushed trying to keep their attention on the bridal party, but constantly distracted by the noose that dangles near the front edge of the makeshift stage. 
The judge begins. "My friends, we are gathered together to join together a man and a woman under the laws of this state. If any here present know of any legal block to this marriage, let them speak now or forever hold their peace." He pauses a short time, then proceeds. 
"Do you, Frank, take this woman Virginia to be your lawful wedded wife, to have and to hold, from this moment forward, until death do you part?" 
"I do." 
"Do you, Virginia, take this man Frank to be your lawful wedded hangman, to have and to hold, from this moment forward, until death do you part?" 
(Gulp) "I do." 
"The ring..." 
The best man gives the ring to the groom. He looks into the bride's eyes and takes her hand, then puts the ring on her finger. They continue holding hands for a few moments before turning back to the judge, who pulls a black cap on over his wig. 
"By the authority vested in me by this state and county, I now pronounce you hangman and wife. You may hang the bride." 
The groom whispers to the bride "Are you really sure you want to do this? I can still take you home and pretend this is a normal wedding. I can make you happy, I promise you." 
"Frank, no. This is what I want. You're a dear to offer me an out, but I wouldn't have married you if you hadn't agreed to this. Besides, I know you're really looking forward to it too." 
"Well, yes, I am, actually, but still..." 
"It's what I came here for." 
"OK, sugar bun, I guess... it's your neck..." 
Ginny steps to the edge of the stage and, turning, throws her bouquet. The youngest bridesmaid, less than a month past her eighteenth birthday, catches it. She gives the groom a look that says, as clearly as words, "You're mine next." 
The bride crosses her wrists behind her so the groom can tie them together. Then she turns to face the groom. He removes her veil so everyone can see her face. 
Ginny's mother breaks into loud sobbing, and the father climbs quickly down to comfort her as best he can. 
Virginia walks over to stand on the carefully painted X near the edge of the stage. 
The groom slips the noose over her head. She gives a startled gasp as the weight of the knot settles against her neck, but she stands straight and proud while he adjusts the knot snugly under her ear. 
"Don't forget my legs," she whispers, "I don't want to ruin the effect of my dress." 
He quickly kneels down and straps her ankles together. Then he stands up and takes her in his arms. They kiss hungrily. She rubs her body against him, feeling his erection through both their clothes. 
At last, panting, she breaks the kiss and looks at him, waiting. 
He steps back off the hinged trap to a lever, then motions for her to face the audience. She turns and looks out at the faces watching her, feeling their combined support for her decision, but also knowing that... they are waiting to see her hang. 
She stands, waiting, trembling only slightly. The seconds seem to drag on and on. She begins to have doubts... is he going to go through with it? She feels the noose snug around her neck and anticipates it... tightening, squeezing the life out of her... her dangling by her neck... the pain... the helplessness... strangling... forever... 
As she thinks about it, she feels herself get excited &#8212; but also fear. She knows it will hurt an awful lot. Maybe she should cancel this... She's almost ready to turn her head and tell him she's changed her mind, when... 
Thwap! fwap! fwap! The trap door falls from under her and bounces a few times. 
She gasps as she starts to fall, but no noise comes out &#8212; the rope jerks tight around her neck and the room appears to tilt as the knot pushes her head to one side. She hadn't realized just how much it would hurt, having all her weight on her neck. She should have called it off, but it's too late now. She jerks her legs up and down, feeling for someplace to stand, but the floor is still over a foot away. 
The neat rows of chairs turn into chaos. Most of the guests are already paired off and seek a position that allows them to enjoy each other without losing a good view of the bride's struggles. 
Every time Ginny tries to kick, the knot jerks tighter and hurts more. She tries to hang quietly and succeeds for a little while... 
In the audience, some couples are adopting a modified rear-entry position with the woman leaning on the chair in front. That way she can still watch the hanging. 
A few couples are keeping their hands and fingers busy with each other so that both can stay seated and watch the stage. 
After perhaps half a minute, Ginny runs out of air. Her chest hurts and she can't hold her breath any more! 
She manages to force the stale air in her lungs out past the constriction around her neck, then her chest muscles spasm and manage to pull in a little air. Not enough, and she's still choking. She tries again, but the rope feels like steel around her neck. 
Then she remembers that this is what she wanted. This is what she got married for. She chose to die like this, hanging by a rope around her neck. Her neck hurts and her body is ready to panic from that suffocating feeling in her lungs, but she wants to enjoy every moment of it. She gives in to the struggle and lets her instincts take over. 
The groom stares at his young bride's death struggles, horrified, but also fascinated. His iron hard-on is painful in his tight tuxedo trousers. He unzips his pants and starts to jack off, but the youngest bridesmaid comes over and grabs it. She leads him gently to the edge of the stage, then jumps lightly to the floor. He glances at her and notices the same "you're mine" look, just before she takes him in her mouth. He turns his head to watch his bride's performance; the bridesmaid grabs his hips and turns his body slightly so she can see too. 
Virginia tugs at the rope around her wrists, trying to get her hands free and loosen the noose, but it's tied too well. She can't budge it. 
Her knees pull up to her chest, then thrust down hard, bouncing her up and letting her get a tiny breath. Again and again... but each time it's a little harder. She's getting tired... weak from lack of air... 
Her bouncing movements pull the noose ever tighter around her neck... now she can't breathe at all. Her eyes grow wide and her face turns red. She feels a delicious sensation beginning between her legs... tries to rub her thighs together... frustrated by the bindings at her ankles. She struggles, but weakly now. 
The audience's movements become more frantic as they see the bride's struggles slow down. A few have already come and are relaxing in the afterglow, watching as Virginia starts to fade. 
The groom moans as the bridesmaid slides her lips rapidly up and down his erect cock, her tongue flicking over the sensitive area right under the head. 
Ginny hears a high-pitched buzzing and realizes it won't be long now. She is at peace, hanging by her neck, barely aware of the reflexive heaving of her chest muscles. What little awareness remains is concentrated between her legs now. 
The groom groans as he erupts in the bridesmaid's eager mouth. She swallows eagerly without stopping her rapid motion, and he screams as the pleasure whites out his consciousness. 
Ginny's face turns purple as she hangs, twitching a little. She feels a huge explosion between her legs and the everything goes away in a high-pitched red blur. 
At last her face is a deep purple and even the twitching of her legs and chest slow down and stop. Her muscles relax and her body hangs limply. 
The bridesmaid feels her own orgasm start as she watches Ginny's movements stop. Her free hand steals down between her legs to add pleasure. A little bit of semen that she hadn't managed to swallow dribbles from her relaxed mouth. 
The audience breathes a collective sigh and starts cleaning themselves up and straightening their clothes. 
The groom regains control of himself to find himself being partly supported by the bridesmaid, his bride now hanging limp in the noose. 
The teenager helps him rearrange his tuxedo, then looks up at him and jumps up and down eagerly. "Me next! Me next!" 
"Hey, don't I ever get to marry somebody and keep her for awhile?" 
"I'm sure you can find somebody if that's what you really want. But admit it... you enjoyed the hell out of this." 
"Well, yes..." 
The keyboardist strikes up the recessional and the groom and bridesmaid walk back up the aisle. The audience follows them to the huge buffet brunch set up in the pavilion.
