Pilloried in the
Mid-East 

&quot;Guilty as
charged.&quot; 

The judge's verdict
stunned me. I couldn't believe him. No, I didn't want to believe him. The trial
was a complete farce, just as&nbsp;Katy&nbsp;insisted from the beginning. How
could&nbsp;we be guilty of violating a law when&nbsp;we were not even in the
country but just passing by in the Mediterranean? How had we ended up here? 

I had signed up for a
BDSM cruise at the urging of Kelly, a Domme friend,
who&nbsp;convinced me to come along with her and her sub&nbsp;husband. I was
hesitant, but decided to give it a try. I might&nbsp;have some fun, and I might
even meet a Dom I really liked. 

The cruise was
wonderful&nbsp;with everyone aboard&nbsp;in the lifestyle, except for the crew,
of course. However, the organizers cleared that with the cruise line in advance
and we paid a premium for the privilege.&nbsp;The&nbsp;BDSM theme made everyone
comfortable and we all did things we would not normally do outside of our
homes. The ship&nbsp;scrupulously avoided&nbsp;entering the waters of any
country that objected in any way to what we were doing. 

At least, that was
the plan. 

The morning was
beautiful, a typical day in the Med. It was in the 70's with a breeze blowing
gently across the deck. As I laid face down on the lounge and drifted in a fog
of sleepiness, the memories from the dinner at the Captain�s table night before
kept me awake. I had enjoyed the flirting and was wondering if he might be
interested in exploring the world of BDSM with me. He was the one that
suggested that we work on our tans this morning, as we would be in port in the
late afternoon. I woke early and went on deck to catch some sun. 

Normally I&nbsp;wear
a one-piece suit in public, but I opted to work on my tan all over, something I
could not&nbsp;do at home. I was on the fantail with a few other women,
including Katy, and I&nbsp;found myself admiring&nbsp;her sated look, she must
have had some fun last night. She's a bit taller than I am, with fuller
breasts. The kind of breasts I wish I had, ones that men lust after and that
cause them to drool. She had chosen to go topless instead of nude, and I teased
her about it. She wore her hair short, and it was&nbsp;reddish, and tousled
that morning; as if she had slept in the lounge chair she was in. She was
tanned everywhere except for her breasts. 

I did not know the
other women on deck, but they were definitely younger and more used to being in
the sun than I. They had �all over� tans. The first wore her hair past her
shoulders, was blond, and had a light complexion, about 20, 5�7 and 147 lbs. I
envied the firmness of her skin, but knew that in a few years it would turn to
leather because of the time she spent in the sun. The other&nbsp;was darker
with an Arabic look. Her hair was long, and very dark; but it glowed in the
light as though lit from&nbsp;within. I would love to have hair like hers. She was
about 126lbs and 5'8 tall. She had small breasts and her right nipple pierced.
The only other thing she was wearing was an anklet that I had seen in fetish
shops before, and I wondered where the matching collar was. She looked
delectable, and would tempt me to switch if she asked. 

The first that I knew
of a problem was when I felt something cold at the base of my spine. Looking up
I saw a sailor in a uniform that I did not recognize pointing a gun at me, and
then realized that men with guns surrounded us all. 

They hustled us off
the ship as is. I could not even pick up the wrap that I had brought on deck
with me. The trip across to the other ship was rough in the small boat we
entered at gunpoint. When we reached the ship, we had to climb a rope ladder
onto the deck. We all made it with the exception of the Arabic woman who curled
into a ball in the bottom of the boat, and no amount of prodding by our captors
elicited a response from her. Even the coaxing of her friend had no effect.
They finally tossed a rope from the deck and tied it around her wrists, hauling
her aboard dangling like an animal. This actually woke her up and she began to
scream form the weight of her body straining against her arms. 

The blonde-haired
girl tried to look at her wrist because we could all see the blood from where
the rope had dug into them, but they cuffed us, and led us stumbling along the
crowded deck to the bow of the ship, where a single sailor guarded us. This left us open to the leering eyes of every sailor that
could find any excuse to come on deck and look. 

Katy&nbsp;was vocal through
all&nbsp;of this, demanding to talk to the Captain, despite the rest of us
pleading with not to make it worse.&nbsp;Personally, I&nbsp;agreed that it
could not be any worse, but I&nbsp;kept my mouth shut, having learned from my
Dom that calling attention to myself only brought more
trouble. 

After the ship
docked, we&nbsp;found ourselves the center of activity as they led us down the
gangplank and into the arms of the police. We climbed into the bed of a pickup
truck, and they fastened collars around our necks, clipping us to a rack that
forced us to stand as they drove through the city. The driver must have
toured&nbsp;every major street&nbsp;in the city. I may never have been there
before, but I do know when I am going around in circles. 

They unclasped us
from the truck and shoved us out the back I almost fell as I went off the
tailgate. They chained us together and led&nbsp;us into the building. At first,
I couldn�t see after coming out of the bright sun and found myself again
stumbling as I tried to keep my feet. 

We went directly
into&nbsp;the courtroom and met our lawyer. A more despicable example&nbsp;of a
man I could not imagine. It almost seemed like a clich� to look at him. Robes
and a turban of silk made him look like a sheik, but his untrimmed beard seemed
to be crawling with lice, and was full of dandruff and his breakfast. He
spent&nbsp;more time feeling us up than working on our defense. He seemed
really to enjoy the nipple ring that the Arabic girl&nbsp;sported. I was worried
about her because she was simply staring into space as if nothing mattered
anymore. 

Katy did not wait for an
opportunity to speak. She simply tore into them, demanding an opportunity to
speak to the American Ambassador and that they release us immediately with a full
apology. The only acknowledgment made of this was the filthy gag that they
stuffed into her mouth. I was sorry to see this, but also glad, because I was
tired of listening to her. 

The only witness that
testified shocked me immensely.&nbsp; It was the Captain of the cruise ship.
&nbsp;He came in and described our &quot;immoral and brazen&quot; behavior in
detail. It seemed that he was a new convert to Islam and deliberately guided
the ship into the territorial waters to make an example of us, this after flirting
with me at his table the night before. I wanted to scream and cry, but no way
would I crack. I refused to give anyone that kind of satisfaction, especially
those creeps. As far as the Captain was concerned, I hoped he choked the next
time he sat down to eat. This made me wonder about the rest of the passengers
and if they were here somewhere. 

The next thing we
knew&nbsp;they found us guilty. I gritted my teeth and asked the lawyer what
would happen next. He put his face close to mine, and as he got in one last
grope, he said only one word,&nbsp;&quot;Pillory.&quot; 

They then lead us off
to await punishment.&nbsp;Again, we walked through the halls,&nbsp;but this
time I was able to&nbsp;see enough to make me wonder if&nbsp;the
building&nbsp;dated from the Crusades. Some of the art seemed to be even older.


The architecture was
delightful, and there were the typical friezes and tapestry of Arabia. There was one frieze in particular that reminded
me of some I had seen of pictures from Ancient Babylon, A smaller version to be
sure, it was a statue of an ancient king holding a lion cub in his arms.
Another work that I really wanted to look at was a carpet&nbsp;hanging on the
wall. The colors were bright and clear, and the pattern was hypnotic. The
simple pattern looked almost Navaho in concept and made me wonder where it came
from. I realized I was desperately seeking anything to take my mind off what
was happening. Tears began to fill my eyes. 

We walked into the
bright sun again, by this time the heat was&nbsp;oppressive. It must have been
approaching 40 degrees. We walked for what seemed like hours, but was only a few minutes. I&nbsp;felt hands groping at me as
we&nbsp;pushed our way through the crowd.&nbsp;The cell they led us to was nothing more than a cage in the courtyard with an open
latrine in one corner. Flies were everywhere and rancid food covered the
ground.


The only concession
they made to our comfort when they put us in the cell was removing the chain
that held us together. We were in the open. Anything we did was visible to
everyone. I walked over to Katy and told her that I would try to remove the gag
if she knelt so I could reach. She glared at the crowd, but realized that she
had no choice and did as I told her. When I finally managed to work the knot
free she spit the gag onto the ground. 

We cleared a space on
the floor so we could sit, and turned our backs to the crowd. By this time, the
flies had discovered and covered us.&nbsp; They drank the sweat pouring off us,
and occasionally bit into our tender flesh. 

After I told them
what the lawyer had said to me, we talked about other things to keep our minds
occupied. Pillory was a term we were all familiar with, the only thing left to
wonder was when and where. I actually have enjoyed stocks in play, but let me
tell you, the real thing was different. 

Everyone enjoyed the
show whenever one of us had to use the bathroom. We all got up to try to block
the view of the crowd. It was a futile exercise. With no paper to clean
ourselves, and no way to use it anyway, we had to live with the filth, and the
flies soon discovered another reason to torment us. It was especially difficult
when I helped&nbsp;Katy with the bikini bottom she was wearing. &nbsp;So much
so that I was tempted to tell her to leave them off, but I didn�t want to add
her misery. 

We took the
opportunity to talk to each other and introduce ourselves. The blonde-haired
woman was&nbsp;Jean, and the Arabic girl was June. I discovered that they were
lovers, and that June is obviously the sub in the relationship. I even found
out why she was almost catatonic. She was actually from this area of the world,
was raised a Muslim, and was shamed by the public humiliation. 

&nbsp;I perked up when I
saw them bringing us supper, but when they simply tossed it inside and half the
food spilled to the floor I lost my appetite. We all ignored it, except for
June, who had not eaten in a couple of days. At that time, I thought that I
would never be hungry enough to eat like a dog in front of the whole city. 

After dinner, they
placed a large bowl of water in the cell for us to drink. This was too much for
me after being out in the sun all afternoon. I swallowed my pride and got down
to drink like everyone else. Katy was going to hold out, but we convinced her
that it would be better to strong as possible for whatever might happen. 

The cheering of the
crowd was deafening. &nbsp;Half the city must have been there by then. The
night was long and surprisingly cold so we huddled together in a futile attempt
to stay warm. This actually made things worse in some ways, because by then I
was in pain from the sunburn from the constant sun and lack of shade. 

When the sun rose,
the guards again tossed food into the cell, and all of us, except for Katy,
decided to eat despite the humiliation. We drank as much water as possible.
We&nbsp;went through the routine at the toilet again, the crowd outside had
thinned some, but we still had an audience for every move. 

The guards opened the
cell and we went to the same truck as yesterday. They let us sit this time,
something that actually worried me, because I knew that worse was in store for
us. They drove us straight to the main square of the city&nbsp;Crowds cheered
the whole way.&nbsp; The word had spread during the night. People thronged the
streets. 

At the square, we saw
the stocks waiting for us on a platform, and more people lining the square.
Getting down from the truck, we walked to a shower. A female guard tore away
what little Katy was wearing. The crowd cheered. She held up the bikini bottoms
and tossed them into the crowd, causing a minor diversion with the scrabble for
them.&nbsp;We then walked into the shower; the two female guards scrubbed us
down. I would have enjoyed being cleaned if it the guard had been gentle. The
one who scrubbed me took a sadistic pleasure in using the brush to scrub me
everywhere. 

The path from the
shower to the stage was through the crowd. This was the worst part for me. The
crowds were able to press upon us from every side and the guards made no effort
to keep them at bay. We were forced to endure the pawing of the men as we
walked for what seemed like years. 

I was the last one
onto the stage and we all stood around waiting for something. Katy again spoke
up, this time demanding to know what the delay was. It was interesting to see
her almost anxious for the punishment. I guess she was thinking that the sooner
it started, the sooner it would be over, something I
knew from experience was not always true. 

Soon the crowd
stirred and our lawyer walked up on the stage. He unrolled a huge scroll and
read from it to the audience, who enthusiastically interrupted quite often with
cheers. Not understanding Arabic none of us knew what he was saying but we knew
it was about us. 

I found myself
watching as the others walk into position and bend over for the stocks. I
winced each time I saw them remove the cuffs from someone, because by this time
my shoulders were sore. I was sure each of the others was just as sore.
Somehow, I ended up&nbsp;last, and nervously walked to my place. As the cuffs
fell away&nbsp;my shoulders protested the sudden movement. Before I could do
anything to relieve the pain, I felt a hand forcing me down and I placed my
neck in the depression in the bottom stock. My wrists fit nicely into the other
slots and as the guard closed the top I found that I was grateful for the
well-polished wood At least there were no splinters. 

We were positioned in
a rough square so that we could see each other. The design of the stocks
prevented us from seeing anything behind us, something I had always found to
almost as erotic as being blindfolded. Forgive me for saying this as I did not
find it erotic then. I saw the others straining to see what was happening
behind me on the stage, and suddenly knew that though I had been last in line,
I would be first for what happened next. 

There was a stinging
blow across my ass and I yelped. I was being flogged, and not by a flogger that
I had ever felt before. This one seemed to have rougher leather, and to have
weights at the end of each individual thong. Whoever was wielding it must have
been strong, putting everything he had into the blows. The pain quickly brought
tears to my eyes, but soon I felt my body responding to the years of
conditioning from BDSM play. I was getting excited! 

The flogger continued
to strike me, expertly wielded, moving from my ass up my back and then back
again. The thongs were long enough to wrap partially around me and slap my
stomach and my breasts. The man wielding the flogger even paid&nbsp;attention
to my pussy, making sure that one blow fell there every time he got to my ass. 

By then, I was
panting a bit from the excitement. My throat was raw from the yelps. When the
flogging stopped, I whimpered and almost begged for more. 

I screamed for the
first time as I felt a sharp sting across my upper thighs and heard a loud
crack. 

What was happening?
Trying to think through the pain, I soon realized that the sensations I felt
came from a whip. The pain was sharp and expertly applied&nbsp;to the sweet
spot from my upper thighs to my ass. Occasionally, I felt a sting across my
pussy and screamed louder. 

The hardest thing for
me to believe was how exciting this was for me. I had never experienced pain
this intense, and the pleasure that commingled with it was almost intoxicating.
I found myself again building toward orgasm as the whipping continued. 

The tide quickly
broke over me, and I had to concentrate to keep my knees from buckling, I knew
better than to let that happen while in stocks. When I finished my orgasm, I
realized that the whipping was over and that everyone there was cheering,
because of how much I enjoyed it. 

I knew my back was
red from the flogger and the whip, and wondered if any of the liquid I felt
trailing down my sides and legs was from blood.&nbsp; 

The next thing I felt
was a hand at my pussy. Whomever it was searched for my clit and pinching it
expertly. Then I felt the first finger enter me. The probing continued
expertly, and despite just having one of the most intensive orgasms of my life,
I soon found myself responding. The hand continued to work. More fingers
entered me. The hand was rough and demanding. &nbsp;Yet at the same time
delicate. When I felt the whole hand inside me, I realized that the person back
there had to be one of the female guards, because the hand was too small for a
man. 

She continued to use
her hand on me. Her other hand began to work my clit. I built toward another
orgasm. I heard the cheering of the crowd as they enjoyed the show. I then
heard an almost musical laugh behind me and the fingers at my clit dropped
away. I felt the hand withdrawing from my pussy. I tried to push myself onto
the hand and whimpered with desire, but all I got for my efforts was a slap on
the ass. 

Tears ran down my
face, from the mingled pleasure, frustration, and humiliation. I opened my eyes
when I felt someone grab my jaw and force something inside my mouth. As I
looked up, I realized that this woman had just been fisting me. I tried to beg
her with my eyes. She only smiled as she buckled the gag into my mouth. I
explored the gag with my tongue and discovered it was a ring gag. She put her
hand under my nose and I smelled myself on her. 

The next thing I saw
was a large man walking behind Katy with a flogger. 

He was about
6'4&quot; and must have weighed at least 250 pounds, but he was built like a
footballer, without an ounce of fat that I could see. He was wearing only a loincloth
and a hood.&nbsp; I admired the muscles across his back as he loosened up
before using&nbsp;the&nbsp;flogger on Katy. The muscles of his legs looked like
cables embedded in the earth as he braced himself to swing. His forearm bunched
like writhing snakes as he shifted his grip on the flogger. I even found myself
admiring the sweat as it dripped from his bronzed shoulders and down his back.
I wondered what he looked like under the hood he was wearing. &nbsp;Was he as
handsome as he was buff? I do not think I had ever wanted a man as much as I
wanted him at that moment, and I would have done anything for him. &nbsp; 

Then I felt the first
cock at my pussy. My eyes focused as a man stepped in front of me with his cock
in his hand, and I knew the day had only begun. As I tasted the first unwashed
cock, I heard Katy scream when the first strike of the flogger fell against her
back.
