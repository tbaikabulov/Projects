Synopsis:  Anna is the top student in Gulf State University�s Anthropology Department.  She jumps at the opportunity to go on a research trip with her favorite professor, Dr. Jill Wallings, to study a tribe on a remote Pacific island.  She knew about the chauvinistic attitudes of the tribe�s males before volunteering for the expedition but she had no idea that she would become literally owned once she arrived on the island.

Chapter 1

She crept slowly along the rocky trail.&nbsp; She had to be very careful here.&nbsp; The path took her up higher on the mountain and, therefore, to a safer position.&nbsp; But the slightest misstep could send her spilling down the side of the mountain hundreds of feet.&nbsp; It would surely mean death for her if that happened.&nbsp; But, then again, maybe that was preferable to being captured by the savages who had been stalking her all morning.&nbsp; Her first choice, she decided, however, was to escape.

She came to a fissure in the rock face of the mountain.&nbsp; After looking at it more closely, though, she saw that it was actually a small cave.&nbsp; She crawled in to hide for a few moments to catch her breath.&nbsp; Inside, she found a spring in the cave and drank thirstily from it.&nbsp; It had been hours since she drank anything at all.&nbsp; It had been two days since she had eaten anything.

The mountain tribes in this land were primitive and warring.&nbsp; She did not belong to any of these tribes but had somehow gotten entangled in their feuds when she accidentally wandered into their disputed hunting grounds.&nbsp; She had been chased by both sides for the past two days and it was a miracle that she had not been captured or killed.

Anna peeked out through the mouth of the cave after she had rested for a few moments.&nbsp; She could see her destination off in the distance.&nbsp; She was an anthropologist and she could see smoke rising from the fire in her base camp several miles away.&nbsp; It would provide her safety if she could reach it.&nbsp; It was not far at all but it might have been a million miles away.&nbsp; For the time being, she was trapped up on this mountain with natives down below.&nbsp; And right now, they were probably climbing the mountain to try to capture her.

She tried to figure out what to do next.&nbsp; She could keep climbing but who knew what she would find higher on the mountain.&nbsp; Plus, that meant that she would have to climb back down all that distance eventually.

She could start her descent now in hopes that the natives had given up looking for her.&nbsp; Then it would be a quick dash across the hills and fields to the safety of her base camp.&nbsp; But she realized that it was just wishful thinking that the natives might have given up.&nbsp; They had chased her for almost two days so it was unlikely that they would let her go now.

Her other choice seemed to be staying where she was.&nbsp; There was a chance that the natives would walk right by her little cave.&nbsp; After all, she had almost missed it completely.&nbsp; Plus, the cave had plenty of water.&nbsp; She could survive here for several days and, hopefully by then, her pursuers would give up.&nbsp; She decided to make the cave her temporary home.

She sat by the mouth of the cave and used the light streaming in from the opening to take stock of her situation.&nbsp; She had a knife, so that was good.&nbsp; She was wearing serviceable shoes which meant that she could run if she had to.&nbsp; Those shoes had already saved her life many times as she darted among trees earlier in the morning and managed to evade the many arrows that had been shot at her.

She shuddered as she remembered the arrows.&nbsp; These people were playing for keeps!&nbsp; They weren&#8217;t just trying to chase her away.&nbsp; They were trying to kill or capture her!

The rest of her clothing was a mess.&nbsp; Yesterday, one of them had ambushed her and grabbed her shirt.&nbsp; It had been torn away, along with her bra.&nbsp; The shoulder strap of the bra had prevented her from losing the garment but it was pretty useless with the way the back had been torn.

The shirt was in no better shape than the bra.&nbsp; The native had grasped the back of her shirt and pulled downward.&nbsp; She assumed he was trying to pull her down to the ground at the same time.&nbsp; But the well-worn shirt gave way easily and tore down the back.&nbsp; One of the sleeves was torn at the same time.&nbsp; Since it had been tucked into her shorts, she still had most of the cloth but it was now in tatters as it hung from her waistband.

The shorts had met a much more natural death.&nbsp; They too were old and well worn.&nbsp; The crotch had split open as she leaped and stretched to clear a small stream.&nbsp; She had caught one of the legs on a limb and it had ripped up the side.&nbsp; Now, her shorts consisted of a waistband, one leg, and some shredded fabric where the other leg of the shorts was supposed to be.

She realized that she should have worn panties.&nbsp; In hindsight, that would have been a very good idea.&nbsp; But she had also learned that wearing panties in the jungle created their own hazards.&nbsp; Things could slither or crawl in there.&nbsp; And sand always seemed to be getting caught in them, causing chafing.&nbsp; She had learned that it was more comfortable and safer to go without.

She stripped out of her clothes and spread them out in the sliver of light that entered the cave through the narrow opening.&nbsp; Surely, there must be something to do with the remaining cloth.

The bra was clearly useless as a bra.&nbsp; Her heavy breasts would never be constrained by some kind of makeshift fastener.&nbsp; And her shirt could no longer be used a shirt either.&nbsp; She thought about the pieces of material in front of her and kept shifting them around, hoping that some kind of outfit came to mind.&nbsp; She would hold a piece of cloth up to her naked body and then set it down to try another one.

Finally, she settled on what she thought would be her best bet.&nbsp; She got out her knife and set to work.

The result was a cross between hillbilly and American Indian.&nbsp; She used the shoulder straps from the bra and a side of the shirt.&nbsp; She cut off the shirt sleeve and then started tying her garment together.&nbsp; The result was a halter top that would provide her at least a little bit of modesty.&nbsp; It would do nothing to support her bountiful breasts but she had already lasted for a full day without the support.&nbsp; She had even been able to endure the bouncing and jiggling of those generous orbs as she ran.

The lower half of her clothing was a loin cloth.&nbsp; She sliced up the remaining leg of her torn shorts and cut little holes in the tops of the rectangles of cloth.&nbsp; She fished the belt through the holes and then fastened the belt around her waist.&nbsp; It did not provide a lot of protection but it gave her a little coverage.

There was leftover material which she tied together.&nbsp; Maybe it would be useful in the future.&nbsp; In the meantime, she used the little clump of cloth as a pillow and lay down to take a nap.&nbsp; Her plan was to try to sneak back down the mountain after it grew dark.&nbsp; Hopefully, if she didn&#8217;t fall down the mountain, she could reach the bottom.&nbsp; And if nobody was around to interfere with her movement, she could make her way back to her base camp.&nbsp; If she did detect people, she would climb back up the mountain and wait it out in her cave until later.

It was dark when she woke up.&nbsp; She crawled to the mouth of the cave again and listened.&nbsp; When she heard nothing, she poked her head out and looked around.&nbsp; It was safe.

She went back to the spring and gulped down some more water.&nbsp; She did not know when she would have another chance for that.&nbsp; She tied the little package of extra cloth to her belt on one side and then secured her knife to the other side of the belt before crawling out of the cave.

There was enough light to see for the first hour of her descent but it was still slow going.&nbsp; By the time it got truly dark, she was less than a hundred feet high.&nbsp; She paused to rest and to wait for everyone to go to bed.&nbsp; She could hear drums but they were off in the distance.

Finally, she started down the path again.&nbsp; The path became wider and was less steep at this point.&nbsp; Eventually, the terrain leveled out and she oriented herself.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t hear anyone around her so she started toward her camp.&nbsp; But only took two steps into her escape, two sets of arms emerged from the darkness and grabbed her by the upper arms.&nbsp; The natives lifted her and other arms reached out, stripping her almost instantly.

She shrieked and struggled against her captors but they were too strong for her.&nbsp; Her wrists were bound behind her back and she was marched off to where they had set up camp for the night, protesting her treatment the whole way.&nbsp; She was indignant at the way she was being treated but they ignored her complaints and just kept prodding her whenever she slowed down.

Anna gasped as she was pulled into their camp and saw what they had built in the center of their camp.&nbsp; Firewood was piled up around a pole that they had erected and she saw ropes dangling from the top of the pole.&nbsp; They were going to burn her at the stake!&nbsp; They were going to roast her!

But it turned out that they had other plans for her first.&nbsp; She struggled again as they hauled her to a beam that they had placed between two trees.&nbsp; She was draped over the beam and her arms and legs were stretched wide.&nbsp; Her bottom was in the air and she was completely exposed and vulnerable.&nbsp; For the next two hours, they ravished her.&nbsp; Cock after cock was plunged into her sex as they raped her continuously.&nbsp; She shuddered as each new cock erupted in her, spewing its savage seed into her womb and she shouted profanities at her rapists throughout the entire ordeal.

Each of them had his way with her and she was exhausted and sweaty by the time the last one climaxed in her.&nbsp; She felt filthy and used.&nbsp; They released her bindings and carried her to the pole, securing her wrists to the top.&nbsp; One of the males brought a flaming torch to the pole and pressed it into the firewood.&nbsp; It started to catch fire and she could feel the heat increasing.

�No!!!!� she cried out.


�Anna?&nbsp; Are you all right?�

Anna shook her head to clear it and looked around.&nbsp; Every face in the classroom was turned toward her.&nbsp; She blushed furiously as she realized that she had been daydreaming in class� again.

�Yes, Professor Wallings,� she replied sheepishly.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m sorry for the interruption.&nbsp; But everything is fine.�

�Good,� said the professor.&nbsp; �Then let&#8217;s continue.�&nbsp; Anna paid attention to the rest of the class and got up to go when the class was over.&nbsp; Jill Wallings called her over to her desk, however, before she could escape.

�Was it the wild men of Borneo this time?� the professor asked.&nbsp; �Or maybe a savage African tribe?�

Anna was by far the most gifted anthropology student that Jill had ever taught in her classes.&nbsp; But she also seemed to lack focus.&nbsp; She was always drifting off into some exotic culture in her daydreams and getting lost in her fantasies.&nbsp; At least her dreams are anthropologic in nature, thought Jill.

�Sorry again, Professor,� apologized Anna.&nbsp; �I think it was somewhere in South America, though.&nbsp; I was in the mountains this time.�

�I see,� said Dr. Wallings, trying to be as serious as she could.&nbsp; She meant to be stern with her student but it was very difficult with Anna.&nbsp; She was such a good student.&nbsp; And she had such a love of anthropology, Jill&#8217;s specialty.&nbsp; Plus, she was an adorable girl.&nbsp; Everyone at the school loved her.

�Anna, you must really learn to focus better,� advised the professor.&nbsp; �You are the most talented student in the department but you are constantly taking these little trips into fantasyland.&nbsp; You are only hurting yourself.�

�I am planning on a field expedition next month and you would be a logical research assistant,� the professor continued.&nbsp; �But I can&#8217;t risk taking you if you keep getting lost in your imagination.&nbsp; It would not be fair to you or the rest of the expedition.�

�Sorry, Professor,� said Anna sheepishly.&nbsp; �I&#8217;ll do better.&nbsp; I promise.�

�I certainly hope so, Anna.�


Chapter 2

Anna was so embarrassed as she finally left the classroom.&nbsp; This was not the first time that this had happened.&nbsp; And each time it had been embarrassing.

She desperately wanted to be an anthropologist, just like Dr. Wallings.&nbsp; She viewed the professor as both an idol and her mentor and she felt awful that she kept disappointing Dr. Wallings.&nbsp; She just had to do better.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t know how she would manage it, but she knew she had to.

And she would love to go on the field research with the professor.&nbsp; That was something that was usually reserved for graduate students.&nbsp; But, if she heard the professor correctly, she viewed Anna as the logical choice.

Wouldn&#8217;t that be something?!?!?&nbsp; As a Junior, she would get to do primary research in the field!&nbsp; She knew that the professor studied South Pacific tribes and that, in itself, would be exciting.

She also knew that Dr. Wallings was famous for her research.&nbsp; She was Leopard Girl.&nbsp; A year earlier, she had changed her research techniques and now fully immersed herself in the culture of the tribe that she researched.&nbsp; That sounded thrilling to Anna.

And Dr. Wallings was like a heroine to her.&nbsp; She had fought alongside the tribe that she studied and had even saved its chief&#8217;s life at one point.&nbsp; Anna even had a Leopard Girl poster that had been tacked up all over campus after one of her returns from researching the tribe.&nbsp; She stared at it for hours at times.

Professor Wallings was beyond beautiful as far as Anna was concerned.&nbsp; She was the epitome of what a woman should be.&nbsp; She was strong and confident and loving and oh so beautiful.

The picture had been taken without Dr. Wallings&#8217; knowledge or permission and had been made into a poster.&nbsp; But Anna was so glad that the picture had been taken.&nbsp; It perfectly defined what Anna wanted to become when she grew up.

In the picture, Dr. Wallings&#8217; long red hair was a wild mane as it flowed down over her shoulders.&nbsp; She was naked and her body glistened with the perspiration of the tropical heat.&nbsp; She had one foot planted on a half-naked male who was obviously injured.&nbsp; She was holding him down and hovering over him protectively.

Her bow was drawn and three armed men were obviously her intended targets.&nbsp; And the expression on her face could only be described as calm determination.&nbsp; There was no sign of weakness or panic.&nbsp; She was in total control of her emotions.&nbsp; And there was no way that she would allow the three men to advance on the man who she was protecting.

Anna sighed as she walked across campus.&nbsp; She wanted to be just like Dr. Wallings someday.&nbsp; And she desperately wanted to go on this research trip.&nbsp; She would have to find a way to demonstrate that she was worthy.

�Dr. Wallings,� Anna said the next day when she visited the professor&#8217;s office.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m terribly sorry that I have let you down.&nbsp; I know that I have let my mind wander in the past but that&#8217;s behind me now.&nbsp; I plan to buckle down and concentrate from now on.�

Jill smiled back at her student.&nbsp; �That&#8217;s very good to hear, Anna.&nbsp; I worry about you often.&nbsp; Concentration is needed in any field.&nbsp; It&#8217;s especially important during anthropological field studies.&nbsp; Not all societies are friendly.&nbsp; And even when the people come to accept you, there are always their enemies and the wildlife to worry about.&nbsp; It can be very dangerous out there.�

�Yes, Professor,� nodded Anna.&nbsp; �I understand.&nbsp; And I will make sure that my actions never put myself or anyone else in danger.�

�That&#8217;s good,� Jill responded.&nbsp; �And I appreciate your stopping by to let me know that.�

�Well, there is something else,� Anna said.&nbsp; �Yesterday, you said that I was the natural choice to go with you on your next field trip.&nbsp; I would very much like you to consider taking me with you.�

�Oh,� replied a surprised Jill.&nbsp; She wasn&#8217;t quite sure how to respond.&nbsp; She did not want to hurt Anna&#8217;s feeling.&nbsp; But at the same time, she wasn&#8217;t sure that the girl had enough maturity to handle a field expedition.&nbsp; Lately, she had just seemed too flighty.

�I see,� Jill went on.&nbsp; �Do you know anything about the tribe that I am studying?�

�I only know what you have written, Professor,� Anna said.&nbsp; �But I have read everything you have written about them.&nbsp; I find them fascinating.�

�You do?�&nbsp; Jill was surprised again.&nbsp; She genuinely loved her tribe but she knew that they were a chauvinistic lot who treated their women more like slaves than daughters and wives.&nbsp; Even she was treated as a slave when she visited the island.&nbsp; She was a very special slave: a katahua.&nbsp; But she was still essentially a slave.

�Yes, I do,� said Anna quickly.&nbsp; �They are so very different from us, but that&#8217;s what makes them fascinating.&nbsp; It would not be very challenging to study a tribe that acted a lot like us.�

�Yes, I suppose that&#8217;s true,� nodded Jill.&nbsp; �But how can I be sure you will concentrate?&nbsp; How can I know you won&#8217;t endanger the rest of us or the tribe?�

�I&#8217;ll prove it to you,� said Anna.&nbsp; �I&#8217;ll be the very model of focus and concentration for you.&nbsp; And if I fail, then I want you to leave me behind.&nbsp; But if I can prove it to you, I 
would dearly love being part of your expedition.�

�Okay,� smiled Jill.&nbsp; �You prove it to me and I will consider you.&nbsp; But there will be a lot of preparation needed.&nbsp; You will have to spend a lot of time getting ready.&nbsp; Do you have the time for that?�

�I&#8217;ll make the time,� answered Anna.&nbsp; �I really want to be an anthropologist, just like you.�

�That&#8217;s very flattering, Anna.�&nbsp; Jill opened her desk drawer and pulled out a folder which she handed to Anna.&nbsp; �Here&#8217;s your first test.&nbsp; Complete this and meet me on Friday.&nbsp; We can discuss it more then.�

Anna smiled brightly at the opportunity she was being given.&nbsp; She had viewed this meeting as a lost cause.&nbsp; But now it was looking like she really might have a chance.&nbsp; �Thank you, Professor.&nbsp; Thank you so much.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll make you proud.�

Jill smiled back at her.&nbsp; �Anna, there&#8217;s one last thing before you go.&nbsp; You said that you have read all of my works regarding the tribe.�

�Yes, Dr. Wallings.&nbsp; I have.�

�Then how would you describe the sexual morays of the Incunu?�

Anna blushed at the question and paused as she tried to come up with a response.&nbsp; �Libertine?&nbsp; Free love?&nbsp; Uninhibited?�

Jill laughed softly at the answer.&nbsp; �Yes, they are all of that.&nbsp; And are you okay with that?�

Anna&#8217;s blush deepened even further at that question.&nbsp; �Well, Professor, it&#8217;s not the way that I live.&nbsp; But I remember what you told us in one of your first lectures of the semester.&nbsp; &#8216;Leave your sense of morals and your cultural norms and your judgment at home when you go into the field.&nbsp; You are there to observe and understand; not evaluate or critique.&#8217;&nbsp; So I&#8217;m okay with that aspect of their culture and any other aspects that they have.&nbsp; It&#8217;s their culture.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not there to change it.&nbsp; I just want to fit in and see what I can learn.�

Jill smiled at her student.&nbsp; This girl really was the cream of the crop in the anthropology department.&nbsp; She quickly and easily grasped the technical aspects of the discipline.&nbsp; But more importantly, she understood the softer side of anthropology.&nbsp; So many people failed to grasp that.&nbsp; Even some of her colleagues on the faculty missed it completely.&nbsp; They would completely trample a small society in order to write a paper.&nbsp; Entire cultures had been ransacked in the past in the name of academia.

Jill&#8217;s preferred method of studying a culture was as an outside observer.&nbsp; Until a year earlier, that had been her relationship with her tribe.&nbsp; And until a year ago, it had been her tribe in her mind only.&nbsp; But the head of the anthropology department at Gulf States University at the time had forced her into trying &#8216;immersion research.&#8217;&nbsp; Through that process, she had become a member of the tribe.&nbsp; Thankfully, the head of the department had left the university since then.

But there was no going back to being an impartial observer at this point.&nbsp; She was Leopard Girl now.&nbsp; She was part of the tribe&#8217;s history and lore.&nbsp; She had killed for her tribe.&nbsp; There was no putting the toothpaste back in the tube at this point.&nbsp; She would have to remain with immersion research for as long as she studied this tribe.

�You make me sound so smart when you quote me,� kidded Jill.&nbsp; �But what I said is true.&nbsp; We have to accept them as they are.&nbsp; We should not try to change them.�

�Yes, Professor,� nodded Anna.&nbsp; �But I have been wondering something ever since you told us that.&nbsp; Didn&#8217;t you change their culture when you became Leopard Girl?�

Jill sighed and nodded.&nbsp; �Yes, I did.&nbsp; And I deeply regret that.&nbsp; But you also have to understand the circumstances.&nbsp; My tribe was under attack.&nbsp; My chief was about to be murdered.&nbsp; I simply followed my instincts.&nbsp; That does not excuse my behavior but hopefully it explains it.�

�Yes, Professor,� Anna nodded again.&nbsp; �But your tribe?&nbsp; Your chief?&nbsp; Is that how you think of them now?�

�Yes, it very much is,� affirmed Jill.&nbsp; �I am Leopard Girl.&nbsp; I am the chief&#8217;s katahua.&nbsp; I am Incunu.�

�But enough chit chat,� announced Jill.&nbsp; �You have work to do.&nbsp; And then we both have a lot of work to do together if you convince me to take you.�

�Work?� asked Anna with a puzzled look on her face.

�Yes, work,� confirmed Jill.&nbsp; �What do you think you&#8217;re holding in your hands?�

�Oh that,� said Anna as she held up the folder and looked at it.&nbsp; �I&#8217;ll have it completed by Friday.�

�Good,� nodded Jill.&nbsp; �Keep your weekends and evenings open after that.&nbsp; That&#8217;s where the real work begins.�

Anna raised her eyebrows at that comment.&nbsp; How much could there be to preparing for this research trip, especially since they didn&#8217;t need to pack much in the way of clothes.&nbsp; Jill saw her confusion and spoke up.

�There&#8217;s the conditioning.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t take a powder puff into the field with me so I have to check your strength and stamina.&nbsp; I have to see how you adapt and react in different situations.&nbsp; I can&#8217;t be guessing about your reactions in the field and there usually won&#8217;t be time to talk things over.&nbsp; And there&#8217;s a certain amount of team building involved.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll be very busy for the next month if I select you.�

�Yes, Professor,� said Anna.&nbsp; �I won&#8217;t let you down.�&nbsp; Then she left with her folder and headed back to her dorm room.

Anna spent all of her free time over the next three days working on the contents of the folder.&nbsp; The first thing she tackled was a one inch thick document.&nbsp; These were some unpublished notes about the tribe and its culture that the professor had made during her years of studying the South Pacific islanders.

She read the notes carefully, making notes of her own and highlighting items of importance.&nbsp; Several times, the document brought a blush to her cheeks.&nbsp; She wasn&#8217;t sure that the tribe members were complete hedonists, but they were pretty close to it.&nbsp; It seemed that everything they did had some kind of sexual undercurrent.&nbsp; That would probably be the hardest thing for her to adapt to.&nbsp; She was not a virgin but she was far from being promiscuous.&nbsp; Living in this culture, however, would take her way beyond promiscuity.

She finished reading the notes for the second time and then sat back on her bed trying to imagine what this immersion research would be like.&nbsp; Part of her was thrilled to be considered for it.&nbsp; It would literally be stepping into another world, complete with different languages, different rules and different morals.&nbsp; That was so exciting in her mind.&nbsp; But it was also those things that made it terrifying to her at the same time.&nbsp; It was all so unknown.

She looked up at the wall opposite the foot of her bed.&nbsp; The poster of Professor Wallings hung there and she looked closely at it.&nbsp; It had been her inspiration for the past year.&nbsp; Actually, Dr. Wallings had been her inspiration but this was a constant reminder to her.

Her eyes slowly traveled down the nude body shown in the poster.&nbsp; Every muscle was tensed as if the professor was about to spring into action.&nbsp; Her eyes blazed with energy but the expression on her face was so calm and determined.

She&#8217;s so beautiful, thought Anna.&nbsp; Her gaze moved up the finely muscled legs to the professor&#8217;s tight ass.&nbsp; From there, they moved up over the flat but very feminine belly.&nbsp; And above that, her eyes once again found the perfectly curved swells of the professor&#8217;s magnificent breasts.&nbsp; They were large but incredibly firm and they stood out proudly as she held her bow high and aimed at the invaders.&nbsp; Each breast was capped with a nipple that was stiff, almost as if she was highly aroused.

Anna shivered as she looked at the gorgeous figure in the picture.&nbsp; She wanted to be just like Dr. Wallings.&nbsp; She got off the bed and stripped out of her clothes.&nbsp; She stood before the full length mirror in her room and inspected what she had to work with.

She had to admit that it was not bad at all.&nbsp; She unfastened her ponytail, letting her long brunette mane tumble freely over her shoulders and chest.&nbsp; She tucked her hair back over her shoulders and then stood upright with her chest thrust forward.

Her C-cup breasts were not as large as her professor&#8217;s but they were full and very firm.&nbsp; She lifted them in her palms, giving them a squeeze and feeling a little shiver of excitement rush through her.&nbsp; She wondered what it would be like to have this body on display constantly when she was on the island and what it would be like to have her body essentially owned by one of the tribal males.&nbsp; A soft moan escaped her lips as she imagined life with the tribe.

But she stopped herself before her imagination got the better of her.&nbsp; She had promised the professor that she would concentrate.&nbsp; She could not afford to let her daydreaming to get out of hand.&nbsp; She could do that after the expedition had completed its work.

She went to her desk to work on the rest of the packet that Dr. Wallings had given her.&nbsp; But she didn&#8217;t put her clothes back on.&nbsp; She figured that she might as well get used to constant nudity.

Some parts of the assignment were to be expected.&nbsp; She had to complete a medical history.&nbsp; She had to sign a consent form that acknowledged that the university could not be held liable for anything that happened during the expedition or in preparation for it.&nbsp; And she had to write an essay on why she wanted to participate in the research and what she hoped to get out of it.&nbsp; These were easy and she completed those assignments that night.

The other two assignments were more difficult.&nbsp; The first was that she had to put together a packing list of things that she would take on the expedition.&nbsp; She would need to share this list, along with her logic, with Dr. Wallings on Friday.

The last item caused her to blush.&nbsp; It was a five page questionnaire.&nbsp; Parts of it were clearly designed to help build a personality profile.&nbsp; That was understandable.&nbsp; Parts of it, however, asked about sexual experiences and likes and dislikes.&nbsp; Had she ever had sexual intercourse?&nbsp; On a scale of one to ten, how would she view sex with a woman?&nbsp; The same was asked about anal intercourse and bondage and whippings and forced nudity and dozens of other things.&nbsp; She was having difficulty imagining all of these things and was having second thoughts about the expedition.

She set the folder aside for the night and picked it up again on Wednesday.&nbsp; She worked on it some more on Thursday.&nbsp; On Friday, she was sitting in the professor&#8217;s office again, across the desk from her, as Jill slowly read her assignments.

�That&#8217;s not much stuff,� commented Jill as she looked over the packing list.&nbsp; �Why so little?&nbsp; We&#8217;re going to be gone for a month, after all.�

�Well,� started Anna.&nbsp; �That was a tough assignment since I&#8217;ve never been on one of these before.&nbsp; But here&#8217;s how I finally decided on what to bring.&nbsp; First, I wanted to make sure that I didn&#8217;t introduce any new technology to the tribe.&nbsp; So that eliminated things like watches and combs and sunglasses.&nbsp; The only thing new that I might be introducing is the composition books and pens I will be using to take notes.&nbsp; And I will try to use those only when people are not around.�

�As far as clothes were concerned,� she continued, �I realized that I wouldn&#8217;t need any for the whole month.&nbsp; I read through your notes several times and it appeared that you were naked the entire time.&nbsp; And I figured that if I did need anything, they would provide it to me since I think I&#8217;ll essentially be owned by one of them while we&#8217;re there.�

�Yes,� interjected Jill.&nbsp; �It&#8217;s true that you&#8217;ll be naked for the whole month.&nbsp; How do you feel about that?�

�To be honest,� said Jill as she looked up at Dr. Wallings bashfully.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m a little nervous about it.&nbsp; It&#8217;s so different from what I&#8217;m used to.&nbsp; But that&#8217;s how they live so that&#8217;s how I&#8217;ll live.�

Jill smiled.&nbsp; �Good girl.&nbsp; Go on with your list.�

�So I didn&#8217;t need much in the end.&nbsp; Other than the notebooks and pens, all that I will be bringing is birth control pills, a bunch of leather thongs, and the clothes on my back.&nbsp; Oh, and I wanted to ask you about a knife.&nbsp; Should I bring one?�

�No, you should leave the knife behind.&nbsp; They will give us knives if they want us to use them.&nbsp; Now, I understand the birth control pills.&nbsp; But why the leather thongs?�

�Well,� Anna started again.&nbsp; �I didn&#8217;t want to bring rope because I wasn&#8217;t sure if they had it.&nbsp; But I did want to be able to tie things, like my hair.&nbsp; And I figured I could use them for other things too.&nbsp; They just seemed very handy and yet very primitive too.�

�That&#8217;s a good list,� Jill complimented her charge after she was finished reciting her list.&nbsp; �You may be the first person to ever pack for a month in a shoebox.�

This caused Anna to giggle.&nbsp; �Yeah, it&#8217;s not much.&nbsp; How much do you usually bring on one of these things?�

�Ever since I started immersion research, that&#8217;s about how much personal stuff I bring too.&nbsp; I like your idea about the thongs, though.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll have to add it to my list.&nbsp; The only other thing I bring is sunscreen.&nbsp; I burn pretty easily.�

�Oh,� Anna responded.&nbsp; �I want to get nice and toasty brown.&nbsp; I want to get as dark as the islanders by the time I leave.�

�Oh you will be,� said Jill.&nbsp; �Trust me.&nbsp; In that tropical sun, you&#8217;ll be a little brown berry quickly.&nbsp; You&#8217;ll just have to be careful that you don&#8217;t burn.�

�Now let&#8217;s look at the rest of your assignment,� said Jill as she picked up the folder.&nbsp; �You can put your clothes over there on the table for the rest of the meeting.�

Anna gasped.&nbsp; �Professor?�

Jill raised her eyebrows and looked at her student.&nbsp; �Yes, Anna?�

�You want me to take off my clothes?�

�Yes, please,� replied Jill.&nbsp; �And then take your seat again.�

�Ummmm,� said Anna.&nbsp; Her cheeks were blushing as she stared at the floor in front of her.

�Anna, I understand if you can&#8217;t do it,� said Jill.&nbsp; �This kind of research isn&#8217;t for everyone.&nbsp; But it&#8217;s best if we find that out now rather than once you get to the island.&nbsp; It would be very uncomfortable for you to learn that there.&nbsp; And it might end up insulting those in the tribe.�

�No, no, no,� said Anna.&nbsp; �I can do it.�&nbsp; Anna stood up and walked to the table.&nbsp; Then, reluctantly, she peeled off her clothes and folded them, creating a little neat pile before she turned back around.

Jill watched the girl undress.&nbsp; She wanted to see how difficult it would be for her.&nbsp; This would be a very telling moment.&nbsp; It would give her a good indication about what kinds of inhibitions she was dealing with.&nbsp; There was a bit of blushing but, for the most part, Anna dealt with the task bravely.

Jill also wanted to see the girl&#8217;s body.&nbsp; A few years earlier, she would have had no interest whatsoever in another feminine form.&nbsp; She was never attracted to other girls.&nbsp; But after her boss had blackmailed her into slavery, she found herself paired up with other females frequently.&nbsp; Over time, she grew to enjoy the soft warmth of another girl cuddled up to her and now liked sex with women as much as she did with men.

Anna completed her task and then stepped back to the desk.&nbsp; She waited until her professor instructed her to be seated again and then sat back in the chair.&nbsp; She kept instinctively trying to cover herself with her arms but then would will them to the arm rests as she waited for the next step.

�I just looked over your consent form and your medical history.&nbsp; Everything seems to be in order there.&nbsp; We will need you to have a full physical before we leave and you will need some vaccinations too.�

Anna smiled brightly.&nbsp; �Does that mean that I&#8217;m going?�

�It means so far so good.&nbsp; Remember that you still have to prove to me that you can maintain your focus.�

�Oh, I can!� gushed Anna, very excited about the opportunity.&nbsp; �I can!�

�I look forward to seeing that.�

�Now,� Jill continued.&nbsp; �Let&#8217;s move on to the questionnaire.&nbsp; Are you comfortable telling me about your responses?�

Anna blushed again.&nbsp; �Probably not.&nbsp; But let&#8217;s do it anyways.&nbsp; Nothing could keep me from this expedition.�

�It looks like you are not a virgin,� said Jill.&nbsp; �Is that correct?�

More blushing spread across the girl&#8217;s cheeks.&nbsp; �That&#8217;s correct.&nbsp; I am not a virgin.�

�Tell me how you view sex,� said Jill.&nbsp; She purposefully let her eyes wander down to Anna&#8217;s chest.&nbsp; She wanted to see how uncomfortable she could make the girl feel and how she would react.&nbsp; Plus, she thought that the girl was beautiful and especially liked the firm breasts that were being displayed to her.�

�Sometimes I like it.&nbsp; Sometimes I don&#8217;t.&nbsp; It&#8217;s as simple as that.�

�What happens when you like it?� asked Jill.

�Fireworks?� replied Anna sheepishly.

Jill laughed.&nbsp; �That&#8217;s a good description.&nbsp; What I meant, though, was what causes the fireworks?�

�Oh,� said Anna.&nbsp; Then she paused to think.&nbsp; �I think it&#8217;s when I guy gets inside my head.&nbsp; When he can create a mood or a scene, I am totally into it.&nbsp; If he just wants to fuck, then I don&#8217;t get much out of it.�

�I see,� said Jill.&nbsp; �Tell me about some of the scenes or moods.�

�Well,� said Anna.&nbsp; �One was skinny dipping.&nbsp; It was naughty and risky.&nbsp; I was like a little firecracker that night.&nbsp; Another time was after a bunch of us streaked through campus.&nbsp; Two of us snuck off into the bushes after that and were like a pair of rabbits for hours.�

�So you like a little bit of adventure.�

Anna grinned.&nbsp; �I guess so.�

�Good,� said Jill.&nbsp; �You will need that spirit for an expedition like this.&nbsp; Come around to this side of the desk.�

Anna gulped at that command but arose and moved to the opposite side of the desk.&nbsp; Jill turned her so she was facing away and then gathered her hands together, locking leather cuffs around her wrists.&nbsp; �You may be seated again.�

Anna went back around the desk and sat down.&nbsp; �Why did you tie me up?�

�I bound you because that is the way you will be kept during much of your time on the island.&nbsp; I assume that you read that in my notes.&nbsp; How does that make you feel?�

�Honestly?� asked Anna.

�Honestly,� replied Jill.

Anna blushed again before responding.&nbsp; �It makes me feel all gushy inside.�

Jill laughed softly.&nbsp; �Good girl.&nbsp; It does the same to me.�

Anna gasped.&nbsp; �It does?&nbsp; I thought I was weird for feeling that way.�

�No, you weren&#8217;t weird.&nbsp; You&#8217;re just honest.�

They continued to go through the questionnaire and, eventually, Anna&#8217;s blushes died away.&nbsp; She soon forgot that she was even naked as the two of them sat and talked about Anna&#8217;s responses.

Finally, the meeting was drawing to a close.&nbsp; �You did very well, Anna.&nbsp; I&#8217;m looking forward to being on the field trip with you.&nbsp; I just hope that you continue to focus.�

�Oh, I will, Professor,� she replied.&nbsp; �I definitely will.�

�Good girl,� smiled Jill.&nbsp; �Tomorrow, we start preparations for our trip.&nbsp; I will need you at my house for the weekend.&nbsp; Do you have a car or should I pick you up?�

�I have a car,� replied Anna.&nbsp; �What should I bring?�

�Your leather thongs and your birth control pills.�

Anna blinked at that response but just nodded slowly.&nbsp; This should be some unusual preparations; exciting maybe, but definitely unusual.


Chapter 3

Anna struggled to get to sleep that night.&nbsp; She was excited.&nbsp; She was nervous.&nbsp; She was excited.&nbsp; She was nervous.&nbsp; She wasn&#8217;t sure exactly what she was.&nbsp; But she definitely felt that she was starting off on an adventure.

She arrived at Dr. Wallings&#8217; house the next morning, bright and early.&nbsp; As instructed, she brought only the leather thongs and her pills.&nbsp; Jill met her at the door and let her into the house where she instructed her student to remove her clothes.

�Wow!� breathed Anna.

�Abrupt, huh?� smiled Jill.

�Yeah, kinda, Professor.�

�Get used to it.&nbsp; The chief will expect us to strip as soon as we set foot on the beach.&nbsp; They&#8217;ll hold our clothes for us until we&#8217;re ready to leave.&nbsp; But it will be buck naked time until then.�

Anna handed the last article of her clothing to the professor and then fought with her arms to keep them by her sides.&nbsp; Once again, Jill let her eyes roam over the nudity, trying to see if she could make her student uncomfortable.&nbsp; All she was able to elicit, however, was a blush and averted eyes.&nbsp; Anna even surprised her by clasping her hands behind her back, leaving her even more exposed and vulnerable.

�Good girl,� said Jill.&nbsp; �Now come with me.&nbsp; I want you to meet my chief and my katahua.�

Anna started to follow and then stopped and gasped.&nbsp; �Wait!&nbsp; Your chief is here?&nbsp; And you have a katahua?�

Jill laughed lightly.&nbsp; �This is my home chief.&nbsp; He&#8217;s my main chief.&nbsp; I also have one on the island with the tribe.&nbsp; And yes, I have a katahua.&nbsp; I rescued her from another island tribe.&nbsp; She did not want to go home.&nbsp; She wanted to remain with me so I sort of own her now.�

�Wow!� breathed Anna again.&nbsp; Anthropology was much different than she had ever imagined.&nbsp; And it was sending wild thrills through her body.&nbsp; She followed Dr. Wallings through the house into the backyard.&nbsp; There, she saw a man dressed in shorts, holding up a tent, as a naked brunette woman was busy pounding stakes into the ground.

�Honey,� called out Jill.&nbsp; �I&#8217;d like you to meet Anna.&nbsp; She&#8217;s the one I told you about.&nbsp; She&#8217;s going to Papaluana with me and will be spending her weekends with us until we go.�

�Oh my gosh!� muttered Anna under her breath.&nbsp; She couldn&#8217;t believe this was happening.&nbsp; How could her teacher be so casual about bringing her naked into the back yard in front of her husband.&nbsp; And who was the other naked woman there?&nbsp; Was she the katahua?&nbsp; This was all so unreal!

Bill turned his head briefly toward Anna.&nbsp; �Hi, Anna.�&nbsp; Then as soon as he had turned back to his work, he whipped it back again to look at the new girl again.&nbsp; �Wow!� he declared.&nbsp; His lack of concentration on his work, however, caused him to lose his balance and he teetered over backward, falling with the tent material ballooning up around him.

Anna had to stifle a giggle, despite the embarrassment that she felt at being displayed naked to him.

�I&#8217;m blessed,� he declared as he struggled to his feet.&nbsp; He kept his eyes on the new girl the entire time.&nbsp; The beauty who had just entered his yard was gorgeous; not necessarily more gorgeous than his wife or his wife&#8217;s slave girl, but gorgeous nonetheless.&nbsp; He couldn&#8217;t believe his good fortune at having his life filled with so many beautiful women.&nbsp; And he knew that all three of them were his to enjoy during the time that they were preparing for the upcoming trip.

�Very nice to meet you, Anna,� he said as he walked toward her.&nbsp; Anna blushed as she saw that his eyes remained fixed on his chest and felt her blush deepening even more than before.

�It&#8217;s very nice to meet you too, Mr. Wallings,� Anna managed to say in response.

�And this is Emily,� said Jill, walking to the other naked girl who was still kneeling and placing her hand on her head.&nbsp; �She&#8217;s my pride and joy.�

�Hi, Emily.�

�Cheers, Anna.&nbsp; It&#8217;s very nice to meet you,� replied Emily.&nbsp; Anna was surprised by the British accent but she liked the sound of it.

Then Anna turned back to Dr. Wallings.&nbsp; �Is Emily your katahua?�

Jill nodded.&nbsp; �Yes, Emily is my katahua.&nbsp; She&#8217;s my girl; my most valued treasure.�

�And she has work to do,� continued Jill, causing Emily to gasp.&nbsp; �Why don&#8217;t you help them put the tent up?&nbsp; If my chief can keep his eyes off of my naked beauties long enough to finish the task, this will be our home while we prepare for the trip.�

�Oh,� remarked Bill.&nbsp; �Well, keeping my eyes to myself will be tough.&nbsp; But we should be able to get the tent up.�

They quickly finished the task and then Bill stood back to admire the two girls who were moving around the tent, making final adjustments.&nbsp; Both were remarkably beautiful.&nbsp; He had grown to adore Emily&#8217;s petite, cuddly body.&nbsp; And he could tell that he would equally adore Anna&#8217;s taller, lithe form.&nbsp; There certainly were advantages to being married to an anthropology professor; advantages that he never would have dreamed of.

�The first order of business,� Jill announced, �is language lessons.&nbsp; Anna, Emily will start to teach you some basic Incunu.&nbsp; You two can work wherever you want as long as you remain outside.�

�Mistress,� said Emily.&nbsp; This caused Anna&#8217;s ears to perk up.&nbsp; Was Emily really a slave?&nbsp; �Can we use the picnic table?�

�No, probably not,� replied Jill.&nbsp; �They don&#8217;t have anything like that on the island.�

�Yes, Mistress,� nodded Emily.&nbsp; �Come along, Anna.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll start over here.�

The two naked girls found a spot of ground under a tree.&nbsp; Emily sat down, cross-legged, causing Anna to blush once again as she saw how immodestly her tutor was sitting.&nbsp; She kept standing, trying to figure out the best way to position herself, until Emily patted the ground beside her.

�Come along,� she said.&nbsp; �I won&#8217;t bite.&nbsp; Sit down and we&#8217;ll begin.�

Anna sighed and sat down with her legs straight out in front of her and together.&nbsp; It provided the most amount of coverage and she would try to keep this position as long as she could.

�It&#8217;s a little different being naked, isn&#8217;t it?� smiled Emily.

Anna nodded.&nbsp; �Yeah, it takes some getting used to.&nbsp; But I guess that&#8217;s why Dr. Wallings will be having me spend so much time here.�

�Probably,� agreed Emily.&nbsp; �But you get used to it eventually.&nbsp; It&#8217;s actually liberating after awhile.&nbsp; Mistress can&#8217;t stand wearing clothes for the first week that we return from the island.&nbsp; She considers bras to be sadistic instruments of torture.�

Anna giggled, relaxing a bit with her naked partner.&nbsp; �Yeah, I&#8217;ve seen her walking around campus and bouncing her way to her next meeting.&nbsp; She seems to take awhile to get used to shoes and combs again too.�

It was Emily&#8217;s turn to giggle.&nbsp; �Yes.&nbsp; She would go around completely naked if she could.&nbsp; And don&#8217;t you just love her hair when it&#8217;s wild and free like that?�

Anna smiled and nodded.&nbsp; �Yeah, I do.&nbsp; And it usually takes awhile for her spots to wear off.&nbsp; She always looks so exotic and sexy when she returns to campus.�

Emily nodded and sighed.&nbsp; �Yes, she&#8217;s definitely all of that.�

�She called you her katahua,� said Anna.&nbsp; �And yet you call her mistress.&nbsp; Are you her katahua or her slave?�

�Hmmm,� pondered Emily.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m both, I guess.&nbsp; To the Incunu, there&#8217;s really no difference.&nbsp; Women are treated as property.&nbsp; And I&#8217;m her property.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m her property by choice.&nbsp; She has tried to give me back my freedom a number of times.&nbsp; But I want to belong to her.�

�Why?�

�Well, I love her for one thing,� explained Emily.&nbsp; �And she saved my life.�

�How did she save your life?�

Emily explained the rescue mission where the Incunus rescued Jill and then she would not leave the island until they had rescued all of the other women who were being held prisoner there.

�You should have seen her charging forward with her bow drawn and aimed at the guy who was holding me.&nbsp; She looked primal.&nbsp; She looked feral.&nbsp; She looked like a mighty warrior.�

�Then she tried to release me and send me home.&nbsp; But I had no home left.&nbsp; There was nothing to go back to.&nbsp; So I begged to stay and be able to serve her.&nbsp; She agreed but only reluctantly.&nbsp; And she still periodically gives me the opportunity to be free.&nbsp; But I can&#8217;t imagine ever choosing that.&nbsp; I love her.&nbsp; And I love Bill too, now.&nbsp; Plus, they&#8217;re both great lovers.�

This caused Anna to gasp.&nbsp; �You have sex with them?�

�Oh my, yes,� replied Emily with a grin.&nbsp; �You will too, I&#8217;m sure.&nbsp; They&#8217;re both wonderful.�

�Wow,� breathed Anna.&nbsp; �I had no idea the professor was so kinky.�

�She&#8217;s actually not kinky at all,� said Emily.&nbsp; �And she started off even conservative.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll let her tell you her story if she wants you to know.&nbsp; Now, she&#8217;s just very uninhibited and very loving.&nbsp; She&#8217;s Incunu.&nbsp; But we should get to work.&nbsp; I need to teach you Incunu.�

The two girls spent three hours on the language lesson.&nbsp; Anna proved to be a good student of the language although it was a very difficult dialect to master.&nbsp; They started with common nouns such as food and people and items that would typically be found in the village.&nbsp; They added verbs after awhile and soon Anna was forming crude sentences.&nbsp; At the end, Emily gave Anna a small translation dictionary that Jill had created and told her to study it.

�We&#8217;ll probably only be allowed to speak Incunu at some point,� said Emily.&nbsp; �That won&#8217;t be so hard for me because I lived with them for years.&nbsp; But you need to study hard unless you want to be eating sandals or calling people great lizards.�

Anna furrowed her brow.&nbsp; �Calling people great lizards?�

Emily giggled.&nbsp; �Mistress should tell you the story.&nbsp; She tells it much better than I do.&nbsp; But her boss went with her on one of her trips and didn&#8217;t learn the language very well.&nbsp; He called the chief a great lizard by mistake and almost got himself killed.�

�Oh,� nodded Anna.&nbsp; She would have to study hard.

Lunch time came around and Jill carried a basket out to the yard where the two girls were still sitting under the tree.&nbsp; Anna sucked in her breath when she saw her professor.&nbsp; She was completely naked now and had let her hair loose, allowing it to flow freely over her shoulders.

�Hungry?� asked Jill as she sat down with the basket.

�Y� y� yessss,� stammered Anna as she stared up at the beauty before her.

Emily giggled at Anna&#8217;s response.&nbsp; �Me too.&nbsp; I&#8217;m starved.&nbsp; Teaching is hard work!�

�How&#8217;s she doing?� asked Jill as she started to set the pieces of fruit onto the grass between them.

�She&#8217;s doing great,� said Emily honestly.&nbsp; �She&#8217;s picking it up much faster than I did.&nbsp; But then again, she has a great teacher.�

Jill smiled and reached out, tweaking one of Emily&#8217;s nipples.&nbsp; �Yes, she does have a great teacher.�

Anna gasped at the sight of the intimate touch.&nbsp; That was a total surprise to her.&nbsp; Were they lesbians?&nbsp;&nbsp; No, that couldn&#8217;t be right.&nbsp; Dr. Wallings was married.&nbsp; And Emily had talked about having sex with Mr. Wallings.&nbsp; Wow, they sure were into free love, it seemed.&nbsp; This would take some getting used to.

Jill laid out the rest of the basket contents, spreading them across the grass.&nbsp; �Eat up, girls.�

Anna just looked at the stuff and wrinkled her nose.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t recognize any of it.&nbsp; All of the fruits were foreign to her.&nbsp; They were colorful enough but she had never seen any of them before.&nbsp; The rest of the stuff was foreign too.&nbsp; Some brown strips looked like they might be some kind of dried meat.&nbsp; There were some dried fish but she had no idea what kind and their grayish color made them look uniquely unappealing.&nbsp; And there were some white balls of stuff that looked like foamy baseballs.

�What is it?� asked Anna.

�It&#8217;s lunch,� said Jill.&nbsp; �It&#8217;s as close to Incunu as I could find.�

�It looks delicious, Mistress,� said Emily as she reached out and picked up one of the yellow fruits.&nbsp; Anna watched her pick some green spikes off of the fruit and then sink her teeth into the thing.&nbsp; �Mmmmm.�

Anna continued to wrinkle her nose as she stared at the unappetizing looking items on the grass.&nbsp; She couldn&#8217;t believe that Dr. Wallings would set the food items on the ground like that.&nbsp; And she couldn&#8217;t even really believe that this was food.

�Try it,� encouraged Jill.&nbsp; �You might find that you like it.�

Anna pointed to what she believed was a fruit.&nbsp; It was oblong and red and had a bumpy surface.&nbsp; �What&#8217;s that?�

�That&#8217;s a paganga,� answered Emily.&nbsp; �They&#8217;re delicious.�

�Here, I&#8217;ll show you how to eat it,� offered Jill.&nbsp; She picked it up and dug her fingernails into one end.&nbsp; Red juice came squirting out and hit her in the cheek, causing her to giggle.&nbsp; The drop of juice fell from her cheek and landed on her left breast and Emily leaned forward to lick it off.&nbsp; This caused Anna to raise her eyebrows.&nbsp; The fruit peeled like a banana and Jill held the red, pulpy center to Anna&#8217;s lips.

Anna opened her mouth and leaned forward slightly, biting a small bit of the tip off of it.&nbsp; The fruit was both very sweet and very tart, causing her jaw to clench up and her lips to pucker.

�Good, isn&#8217;t it?� asked Jill.

Anna nodded slowly as she let her mouth adjust to the onslaught of tastes.&nbsp; �It&#8217;s got a lot of taste.�

Jill laughed and nodded.&nbsp; �It does take some getting used to.&nbsp; Try some of the pig or the fish.�

�Ummmm,� stammered Anna.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m not really all that hungry right now.�

�Suit yourself,� said Jill as she picked up one of the dried fish and bit into it.&nbsp; �But this is what we&#8217;ll be eating on the island.&nbsp; So you better get used to it.�

Jill and Emily happily munched away on their lunches as Anna just stared at the food and occasionally poked at it with her finger.&nbsp; Eventually, she picked up one of the brown strips and bit into it.&nbsp; It was very dry and very chewy, but at least it seemed edible.&nbsp; She became more adventurous and tried some of the other fruits and, in the end, she had tried everything but the white balls and the fish.&nbsp; Nobody had touched the white balls.

After most of the food was gone, Jill handed a white ball to each of them.&nbsp; �Here, have some Banka for dessert.�&nbsp; Then she bit into it.&nbsp; It looked like it was made of Styrofoam or some kind of foam rubber.

�Oooooo!� squealed Emily as she bit into her own ball.&nbsp; Then she chewed it up and swallowed.&nbsp; �We&#8217;re going to have a fun afternoon.&nbsp; Is Master having some Banka too?�

Jill laughed.&nbsp; �We&#8217;ll give him some later.�

Jill turned to Anna and saw her studying the ball in her hand.&nbsp; �Go ahead and try it.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a favorite on the island.�

Anna bit into the ball.&nbsp; It was somewhat like a dry custard.&nbsp; It had a sweet ricey flavor and was actually pretty good.&nbsp; She smiled at her professor with a full mouth and the three of them continued to eat their Banka.&nbsp; Jill finished first and leaned back, stretching her legs forward and supporting herself with her arms.

�This is how Saturdays were meant to be spent,� said Jill as she relaxed and looked at the two naked girls.&nbsp; Both would be going with her to Papaluana.&nbsp; Emily had already been there with her several times in the past.&nbsp; Plus she had been held prisoner by a rival tribe for a couple of years.&nbsp; So Jill knew that Emily would do well.&nbsp; She knew the culture and the language.&nbsp; She was used to the food.&nbsp; And she would have fun.&nbsp; She viewed the island as a sexual amusement park.

Jill hoped that Anna would do well also. The girl certainly had the drive to become a successful anthropologist.&nbsp; And, while she was somewhat reluctant about things, she would eventually plunge in and seemed to be fine once she did.

The Banka would be Anna&#8217;s next test.&nbsp; The Incunu liked to enhance their sexual play with the white puffy drug.&nbsp; It stripped away inhibitions and heightened the sensations.&nbsp; Jill did not use it often at all but, when she did, it was almost like nonstop orgasms for her.

Jill started feeling the effects of the aphrodisiac.&nbsp; It always began with a warm rush over her chest and a pulsing in her pussy.&nbsp; She could tell by Emily&#8217;s dreamy look that she was feeling the drug also.&nbsp; Anna had a furrowed brow and a confused look, which told Jill that she was feeling something also.

�Ooooo,� cooed Anna.&nbsp; �I feel kind of dizzy.�

�Just relax, Anna,� said Jill.&nbsp; �Take a deep breath and relax.�

Anna complied and took in a deep breath.&nbsp; She did feel more relaxed.&nbsp; Then she felt a flash of warmth rush over her chest.

She sat there and took the last bite of the white ball, chewing it and then swallowing it.&nbsp; Then she watched Emily start to move.&nbsp; Emily leaned forward and then stretched her body toward Dr. Wallings.&nbsp; She might have been a short girl but she was very well proportioned.&nbsp; She was all sleek, elegant, almost feline curves.&nbsp; She slinked forward and ran a hand up the inside of Jill&#8217;s leg, sliding it to the top of the thigh once she reached the juncture of the two legs.

Anna blushed as she saw another intimate touch between the two of them.&nbsp; But it was so erotic and so loving that she could not tear her eyes away.&nbsp; Emily placed a hand on the ground on the other side of the professor and then lowered her head, kissing Jill&#8217;s belly.&nbsp; She snaked out her tongue and licked upward to the belly button before letting her tongue circle the little indentation.

Anna sucked in her breath as she saw Emily lift her head again and then use her tongue to paint the rounded lower swells of the professor&#8217;s right breast.&nbsp; Then she sucked in her breath again when Emily turned her head and looked at Anna, beckoning her closer with her hand.

Anna seemed propelled by some unknown force as she leaned forward and then slinked toward the reclining woman as Emily had just done before.&nbsp; She repeated Emily&#8217;s actions by gliding her hand up the soft inside of Jill&#8217;s leg and then leaned forward to let her tongue swab the curves under Jill&#8217;s left breast.

What was she doing?&nbsp; She had never done anything like this before!&nbsp; Why was she touching another woman like this now?

But she had no time to think.&nbsp; Her body was moving on its own.&nbsp; Her head lifted and she rubbed her lips back and forth across Jill&#8217;s nipple, feeling it stiff and rubbery to the touch.&nbsp; She parted her lips and sucked the little nubbin in, hearing Jill moan softly.

Jill let the two girls feast on her breasts for several minutes, enjoying the soft warmth of their lips and tongues.&nbsp; Then she tucked her fingers beneath Anna&#8217;s chin and lifted it, drawing the girl&#8217;s lips upward to her own.&nbsp; She was surprised by the passion that was present when their lips touched and she was easily able to snake her tongue into her student&#8217;s mouth, tasting her sweetness.

Emily moved behind Anna and reached around her, grasping her firm breasts.&nbsp; She squeezed them, extracting a moan from Anna, before stroking them and finally gripping her nipples.&nbsp; She rolled the nipples back and forth and Anna continued to moan.

Jill had determined to let Anna move at her own pace.&nbsp; She could go as far and as fast as she wanted.&nbsp; But Jill was surprised at the initiative that her student showed.&nbsp; Anna shifted her head and kissed each of Jill&#8217;s eyelids before returning to kiss her again passionately, letting her tongue explore her teacher&#8217;s mouth.&nbsp; Then she kissed her way down Jill&#8217;s neck to reach the full, firm breasts again.&nbsp; And she did not stop there.&nbsp; Her lips kept moving downward until her lips found Jill&#8217;s sex which was positively flowing at this point.

Jill reached out and stroked Anna&#8217;s cheek as she watched the girl&#8217;s tongue snake out again and felt it scooping up between her labia.&nbsp; The drug gave her a detached view of the scene, almost as if she was an observer rather than a full participant.&nbsp; It was like watching an erotic movie as she saw Anna&#8217;s tongue touch her clit as the girl looked up into her eyes and saw Emily kneeling behind Anna&#8217;s bottom which was thrust up in the air by her knees.

She could see that one of Emily&#8217;s hands was between Anna&#8217;s thighs and heard her student moaning as Emily obviously played with her sex.&nbsp;&nbsp; Jill rocked her head back, enjoying the fluttering and scooping and stabbing of Anna&#8217;s sweet tongue.&nbsp; She was soooooo good!

The orgasm came quickly and Jill let out a groan and fell back onto the grass as the tremors shook her body.&nbsp; But Anna kept working, toying with her professor&#8217;s sex.&nbsp; The only thing that ended the sweet torment was Emily&#8217;s manipulation of Anna&#8217;s sex which quickly elicited an orgasm.&nbsp; Anna shook and groaned but Emily continued to stroke and probe.&nbsp; Eventually, Anna rocked her body onto its side and clamped her thighs together to try to protect her sex and maintain her sanity.

Emily was the next victim and both other females attacked her.&nbsp; Anna kissed her lips and suckled her breasts as Jill dove between her legs.&nbsp; Jill fluttered her tongue, concentrating on her girl&#8217;s clit, as she watched Anna kissing and stroking Emily.&nbsp; In Anna&#8217;s questionnaire, she indicated that she had some limited experience with other girls.&nbsp; But the way her hands traveled over Emily&#8217;s naked flesh and the way she kissed and licked and nibbled, Jill was convinced that the experience must be more than just limited.&nbsp; Either that or she was an extremely quick study.

Jill slid a finger into Emily&#8217;s sex and started slowly pumping, eliciting a long, low groan from her katahua.&nbsp; As always, Emily was positively swampy.&nbsp; She was constantly ready for sex, it seemed.&nbsp; She kept sliding her finger in and out as she fluttered her tongue over and around the juicy clit.&nbsp; She watched Anna languidly moving from lips to throat to breasts, using her lips and fingers to further arouse the prone girl.&nbsp; Anna appeared to be totally into the Sapphic festivities in the backyard.

Emily erupted without notice, catching Jill and Anna off guard.&nbsp; Her body tensed and she groaned as the orgasm shot through her.&nbsp; But they kept up their exquisite torment, prolonging the climax until Emily was babbling incoherently.&nbsp; It was only then that they paused.

Jill lay on her side in the grass and patted the spot in front of her.&nbsp; Anna slid into the spot and spooned with her naked professor as Jill stroked and squeezed the soft breasts that were made available.&nbsp; When Emily came back to her senses, she slid into the spot in front of Anna and the three of them lay together, caressing one another.

�I liked that,� said Jill, finally breaking the silence.

�Mmmm, me too,� said Emily.

Jill swatted her slave girl&#8217;s bottom playfully.&nbsp; �I know you liked it, pet.&nbsp; You like sex in any form.&nbsp; What about you, Anna?�

�Mmmm, yes,� cooed Anna.&nbsp; �I loved it.&nbsp; Can we do it again?�

�I hope you&#8217;re saving some for the chief,� said Bill.&nbsp; He was standing over them and they had not even heard him arrive.&nbsp; He was naked now and his cock was thick and hard, pointing straight out in front of him.

�Yes, my chief,� giggled Jill in Incunu.&nbsp; Then she realized that her husband did not understand the language and she repeated it in English.&nbsp; �Which katahua do you want?�

�All of them, of course,� he replied.&nbsp; �But I will start with the new one.�

Jill and Emily peeled away from Anna and rolled her onto her back.&nbsp; They each grasped an arm and a leg and stretched her open into a spread eagle positioning the grass.&nbsp; Then Bill knelt between her legs and slowly lowered himself, impaling her smoothly with a single stroke.

Anna let out a slow hiss as the thick cock opened her and then filled her.&nbsp; The drug was still coursing through her veins and she completely abandoned herself to the impalement.&nbsp; She climaxed shortly after he entered her and then twice more as he continued to fuck her.&nbsp; The other two women just held her and showered her with little kisses during the coupling.

The remainder of the weekend was a blur of sex with moments of language lessons and planning sessions sprinkled in between.&nbsp; Finally, Sunday evening came around and it was time for Anna to leave.

�So are you still interested in going?� asked Jill as she sat on a step in the front hallway and watched Anna getting dressed.

Anna paused and looked at her professor, surprised at the question.&nbsp; �Are you kidding?&nbsp; Now I really, really want to go.&nbsp; I&#8217;m just worried that I might not want to come back at the end.�

Jill smiled and stood up.&nbsp; She was still naked as she hugged her clothed student.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m glad.&nbsp; I&#8217;m looking forward to having you.�

Anna giggled.&nbsp; �Well, you had me plenty this weekend.&nbsp; You can have me any time you want.�

Jill kissed Anna.&nbsp; �I plan to do just that.&nbsp; And don&#8217;t worry.&nbsp; We&#8217;ll be sure to bring you back with us.�


Chapter 4

�Mistress,� said Emily as she was repacking one of the video cameras.&nbsp; She and Jill had been checking out the equipment one more time in preparation for the trip.&nbsp; They were to leave in four days.&nbsp; �Are you sure it&#8217;s a good idea to include Anna in the hunt?�

�No,� replied Jill.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m never sure about things like that.&nbsp; It&#8217;s a risk, I know.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m hoping that it lets me see how she handles herself under pressure.�

�Yes, Mistress,� nodded Emily.&nbsp; �I just hope she doesn&#8217;t get offended by it.&nbsp; It&#8217;s pretty graphic and pretty lewd at times.�

�That&#8217;s true,� agreed Jill.&nbsp; �But other than the paint ball guns and the occasional dog, there&#8217;s not a lot different from life on the islands.&nbsp; Girls are slaves.&nbsp; And you remember that tribe that owned you.&nbsp; The hunters will be mild compared to that.�

�Will you be a hunter or prey, Mistress?� asked Emily.

Jill laughed.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m not sure.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve never been a hunter before.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m not sure if it would be appropriate for a mistress to be prey.&nbsp; What do you think I should do?�

�Be hunted,� piped up Bill who had been lounging on a couch, watching the two women in his life working on their gear.

�Oh?� said Jill.&nbsp; �Why is that, dear?�

�I love the stories afterwards,� he said.&nbsp; �Especially if I&#8217;m not included as prey in the hunt.�

Both of them had been slaves to Jill&#8217;s boss until a year ago.&nbsp; Bill absolutely hated the hunts because two gay hunters always seemed to make a point of targeting him.&nbsp; But the boss, Hal, had ultimately released them and now they were completely free.

�I see,� said Jill.&nbsp; �Maybe you&#8217;d like to participate in the hunt tomorrow too.�

Jill laughed as she saw the blood drain from her husband&#8217;s face.&nbsp; �Oh, I think my days of being hunted are over,� he said.&nbsp; Emily giggled at the comment.

�I was thinking of you as a hunter, actually,� Jill said.&nbsp; �You qualify, you know.&nbsp; You own a girl who will be contributed.&nbsp; And we&#8217;ll be contributing Anna.&nbsp; Just think.&nbsp; You could bag Anna and have her all to yourself for the night.&nbsp; Or you could bag Charity.&nbsp; You seemed to like her when she stayed with us that time.�

�Hmmm,� he pondered.&nbsp; �Yes, I suppose I could hunt this time.&nbsp; Maybe I&#8217;ll do that.&nbsp; So what are you going to do?&nbsp; Hunt or be hunted?�

Jill turned to Emily.&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t know.&nbsp; What do you think, pet?�

�I think my mistress should do whatever she wants,� replied Emily diplomatically.

�That&#8217;s no answer,� scolded Jill.&nbsp; �I would love to be a hunter at least once.&nbsp; But I think it will be easier on Anna if all three of us were prey.&nbsp; It might help her get over any fears she has about it.�

�What fears does she have?� asked Emily.

�Well, none right now,� said Jill.&nbsp; �She doesn&#8217;t even know that she&#8217;s going to be hunted yet.&nbsp; She&#8217;ll learn about that tomorrow morning.�

�Oh wow,� said Emily.&nbsp; This was going to be a huge surprise for Anna.

Anna arrived the next morning at eight.&nbsp; She was surprised that she was not stripped naked upon her arrival.&nbsp; Jill explained that, for this last weekend of preparation, they would be focusing on survival training.

�I have arranged for us to participate in a hunt,� Jill explained as she sat at the kitchen table with Bill and the two girls.&nbsp; �It will let us all experience being chased and hunted so that we hopefully don&#8217;t panic if anyone attacks the tribe while we are there.�

Anna smiled.&nbsp; �That sounds like fun.�

�Oooo!� squealed Emily.&nbsp; �It is.&nbsp; I love the hunts!�&nbsp; It was true.&nbsp; Emily did love the hunts.&nbsp; Even though she always got caught and frequently ended up getting abused by whoever caught her, she loved the excitement of the hunt and always had explosive orgasms during those weekends.

Jill shook her head and then continued.&nbsp; �Not everyone enjoys them.&nbsp; In fact, I think that Emily might be the only prey who does enjoy them.�

�Why is that, Professor?� asked Anna.

�It can be pretty humiliating,� explained Jill.&nbsp; Then she went on to describe how the prey is always naked and how the hunters would be armed with paintball guns.&nbsp; �And whoever shoots you gets to keep you for the night.&nbsp; You are their slave.�

Anna gasped.&nbsp; She couldn&#8217;t believe what she just heard.&nbsp; This seemed like an entirely new and entirely kinky world that she was entering.

�Wow!� breathed Anna.&nbsp; �Do you do this often, Dr. Wallings?�&nbsp; That response helped Jill decide what her role should be today.&nbsp; She would be prey so that she could provide some reassurance to her student.&nbsp; She could always be a hunter when she returned.

�I used to,� said Jill.&nbsp; �We haven&#8217;t done it in over a year though.�

�Wow!� breathed Anna again.&nbsp; �Will there be many people there?�

�I don&#8217;t know,� replied Jill.&nbsp; �Probably between forty and fifty.&nbsp; There are usually a few more hunters than slaves.�

�Slaves,� whispered Anna.&nbsp; This really was a whole new world.

They arrived at the ranch at about nine.&nbsp; The hunt would start at ten.&nbsp; Each of the three women removed their clothes and put them in the back of the car.&nbsp; Then Bill went into the ranch house to meet up with the rest of the hunters.&nbsp; The girls went into the barn where the slaves were congregating.

Anna gasped again and her eyes opened wide in surprise as she saw the sea of naked flesh.&nbsp; There were about thirty nude bodies in there already and about a third of them were male.&nbsp; �Wow,� she whispered.

Anna&#8217;s eyes opened wide again and she blushed as she saw someone from school who she recognized.&nbsp; Charity came up and hugged Jill, giving her a long kiss on the lips.&nbsp; �Hiya, Teach.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t expect to see you out here today.&nbsp; At least not like this.�

Jill gave Charity&#8217;s butt a swat before responding.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m just reliving old times.&nbsp; Besides, this is preparation for my next expedition.�

�Preparation, huh?� asked Charity with her eyebrows raised.&nbsp; �Are you going to be studying some kind of sadistic, orgiastic society?�

�Hmmffff,� Jill snorted.&nbsp; �Same tribe.&nbsp; Charity, do you know Anna?�

Charity turned and saw Anna blushing furiously.&nbsp; �Oh, hi Anna.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t recognize you without your clothes.�

Then Charity turned back to Jill.&nbsp; �Yes, I know Anna.&nbsp; We have been in classes together.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t even know she was owned, though.�

�She&#8217;s not,� replied Jill.&nbsp; �At least not yet.&nbsp; Someone from the tribe will definitely claim her but she&#8217;s not owned here.&nbsp; This is just for training.�

Charity giggled and gave Anna a squeeze.&nbsp; �This is real good slut training.�

�Charity!� admonished Jill.&nbsp; �It&#8217;s not slut training.�&nbsp; Then she turned to Anna.

�Anna,� she said.&nbsp; �You already know that whoever shots you owns you.&nbsp; Just try to stay free as long as you can.&nbsp; After that, keep an open mind.�

�Yeah,� said Charity.&nbsp; �An open mind.&nbsp; An open mouth.&nbsp; An open pussy.&nbsp; An open asshole.&nbsp; It should be fun.�

�Charity!� scolded Jill again.

Ten rolled around and it was time for things to begin.&nbsp; The first activity was viewing time.&nbsp; Just prior to ten o&#8217;clock, two males came into the barn and fastened the slaves to overhead beams.&nbsp; When the dominants arrived at ten, they found thirty four naked bodies standing with their arms stretched above them.&nbsp; Eleven of them were male and twenty three were female.&nbsp; The dominants would have thirty minutes to inspect the prey and determine which prizes they wanted to claim this day.

Jill endured the squeezes and pokes and probes as the dominants milled about, assessing her body.&nbsp; She was used to this and tried to ignore the indignities.&nbsp; She focused, instead, on Anna.&nbsp; The girl had been subjected to a whole string of new experiences over the past month.&nbsp; The pattern for each of them had been the same.&nbsp; It always started with embarrassment and reluctance.&nbsp; From there, she migrated into tentative experimentation.&nbsp; She always ended up fully embracing whatever the new activity was and seemed to be totally thrilled by it.

Jill was curious to see if the pattern would continue today.&nbsp; In reality, she just wanted to see how Anna would react to stressful situations and she couldn&#8217;t think of anything more stressful than being hunted into temporary slavery.&nbsp; But she also wanted to see if Anna would end up enjoying the experience like she had with the other activities that she had been introduced to lately.

Anna was blushing and squirming as hands touched her and lifted her breasts.&nbsp; She looked truly uncomfortable as people plunged their fingers into her pussy or ass.&nbsp; And she closed her eyes to shut out the embarrassing scene as people talked about her among themselves.

�Oh look,� a female dominant said as she lifted one of Anna&#8217;s breasts by the nipple.&nbsp; �Fresh meat.�

�Tight cunt,� declared a male as she plunged a finger into her sex.&nbsp; �This is where my gun will be aimed today.�

�I just love blushing girls,� a female said to her as she patted a cheek.&nbsp; �You&#8217;ll spend the night with me.�

On and on it went until it was time to release the slaves.&nbsp; Jill counted no fewer than a dozen dominants who declared that they were going to claim Anna.&nbsp; She only hoped that the girl was not terrified at this point.&nbsp; But she could see that Anna&#8217;s inner thighs were slick with her juices.&nbsp; She might be terrified but she was also highly aroused.

Jill had Anna go with Charity once they were released.&nbsp; Jill and Emily stuck together and stayed behind the other two.&nbsp; She wanted to observe Anna&#8217;s actions and reactions.

The two girls sprinted across the field to the cover of the woods.&nbsp; Jill and Emily entered the woods in a different place but not too far away.&nbsp; Jill saw Anna pull Charity to a stop and then start gesturing.&nbsp; Anna leaned over and started drawing on her palm with her finger and pausing occasionally to point.&nbsp; Charity would nod and occasionally point in another direction.

Jill viewed this as a good sign.&nbsp; Instead of running off willy-nilly, Anna was keeping her wits about her and appeared to be trying to make a plan.&nbsp; And she was making use of the only resource that she had available to her: Charity.&nbsp; Once again, Jill felt good about her choice of Anna for the expedition.&nbsp; And Anna appeared to be completely focused on the task at hand; no fantasies or lapses in concentration.

�How do they usually advance?� asked Anna as she stood up and looked back toward the barn and ranch house.

�I don&#8217;t know,� replied Charity.&nbsp; �I always run as fast and as far as I can and then look for hiding places.�

�Well, I&#8217;m thinking that if we can let them get past us, we can hide near the ranch house,� explained Anna.&nbsp; �I saw an old cart out in the middle of the field we just crossed.&nbsp; Once they all get into the woods, we could go back and hide under that.&nbsp; We could pile up some grass to make a natural looking barrier that should hide us.&nbsp; I doubt that they would ever even think of looking some place so close to where they started.�

�Have you done this before?� asked Charity, skeptically.

�No.&nbsp; Did I say something stupid?�

�No, not at all,� said Charity.&nbsp; �I think it&#8217;s brilliant.&nbsp; How do we let them get past us?�

�Hmm,� said Anna.&nbsp; �I haven&#8217;t figured that out yet.�

�I have an idea,� offered Charity.&nbsp; �Let&#8217;s let them get past us but not here.&nbsp; There are some rocks near here.&nbsp; They never seem to look there until the end because all of the slaves run as far as they can.&nbsp; We hide there and watch.&nbsp; Once they&#8217;re all gone, we go back to your cart.�

Jill watched, perplexed, as she saw Anna and Charity leisurely strolling hand in hand off in a direction that she did not view as overly safe.&nbsp; Then she and Emily took off in another direction to find safety for themselves.&nbsp; She would have to ask Anna later what that was all about.

Anna and Charity crouched down in the small pile of boulders and waited.&nbsp; Ten minutes later, they watched as the hunters emerged from the barn.&nbsp; Charity had been right.&nbsp; They headed out to the woods as a group and started to fan out from there, heading off to the far corners of the ranch.&nbsp; The closest that any of them came to the two naked girls was a couple hundred feet.&nbsp; Anna had the duty of watching.&nbsp; They figured that her brown hair would be less conspicuous than Charity&#8217;s fair blonde head.

They waited ten minutes after they saw the last hunter and then dashed back across the field to their little shelter.&nbsp; They madly pulled up grasses and arranged them at various openings where wood slats had been knocked away.&nbsp; Finally, they crawled into their little haven and made themselves comfortable.

�Are you sure you&#8217;ve never done this before?� asked Charity suspiciously.

Anna laughed.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m sure.&nbsp; I&#8217;m just surprised that you have.&nbsp; It&#8217;s not something that most college kids do on weekends.�

Charity nodded.&nbsp; �Yeah, I know.&nbsp; But my mistress likes the hunts.&nbsp; So each month, she enters me.&nbsp; Then she goes hunting for a girl for the night.&nbsp; I figure it&#8217;s her way of getting a little variety.�

�Wow!&nbsp; You have a mistress?�

Charity nodded.&nbsp; �I do.&nbsp; She has owned me for almost two years now.�

�Wow!� Anna repeated.&nbsp; �I never would have guessed.�

The girls made a little mat of grass and straw and lay down to figure out their next move.&nbsp; Their bodies touched at hips and shoulders as they looked out toward the woods.&nbsp; They chatted quietly, considering various alternatives.&nbsp; About twenty minutes after they settled in, they saw the first victim of the day.&nbsp; A small Asian girl had been bagged by a bearded male who had the girl slung over his shoulder.&nbsp; He walked across the field, passing several hundred feet away from them and ultimately disappeared into the barn.

�He&#8217;s a good one to have out of the way,� said Charity.&nbsp; �He caught me one time and he&#8217;s pretty brutal.�

�Poor girl,� said Anna.

�Better her than us,� advised Charity.

�Well he could still come out and find us.�

�No,� said Charity.&nbsp; �They are only allowed one kill.&nbsp; Once they bag a slave, they&#8217;re done for the day.�

Over the next hour, ten or so more slaves were brought in.&nbsp; Some were carried like the first one.&nbsp; Some walked with their wrists bound behind their backs.&nbsp; Some were just led by a crude rope leash tied around their necks.&nbsp; Emily was one of the ones caught relatively early in the day.&nbsp; She was led by a rope lead around her neck and had her arms bound behind her back.&nbsp; A red paintball splotch colored one of her bottom cheeks.

�I get so horny during these things,� announced Charity who had rolled onto her back and was lazily stroking her clit as a hand cupped and squeezed a breast.&nbsp; �Wanna make love?�

�You&#8217;ve got to be kidding!� gasped Anna incredulously.&nbsp; �We&#8217;re being hunted and you want to fuck?�

Charity grinned sheepishly.&nbsp; �I was thinking more of licking and kissing and fondling than fucking, actually.�

Anna rolled her eyes.&nbsp; �You&#8217;ve got to be kidding!&nbsp; People are prowling around trying to shoot us and enslave us and you want sex?�

�Ooooo yeah!� giggled Charity as she reached out to run her hand down Anna&#8217;s naked back.&nbsp; �It turns me all gooey inside.&nbsp; Aren&#8217;t you excited too?�

�Oh, I can tell from here that you are,� Charity continued.&nbsp; �Your nipples are hard as pebbles.�

�Char,� said Anna, pronouncing it as Chair.&nbsp; �It&#8217;s no wonder you always get caught.&nbsp; You aren&#8217;t concentrating.�

It was Charity&#8217;s turn to roll her eyes.&nbsp; �Everyone gets caught, silly.&nbsp; Concentration has nothing to do with it.&nbsp; In the end, we all get shot.&nbsp; We all get caught.&nbsp; We all get owned.&nbsp; And we all get fucked.&nbsp; That&#8217;s how they play this game.�

�Well, I don&#8217;t plan on getting caught,� said Anna.&nbsp; �Ssshhhh.&nbsp; More people are being brought back.�

Charity wriggled up to the window that they had created in one of the holes in the cart.&nbsp; �They got Sandy.&nbsp; She&#8217;s another girl from school.&nbsp; How many do you figure have been caught so far?�

�Somewhere between fifteen and twenty, I guess,� replied Anna.&nbsp; �And she&#8217;s from school?&nbsp; How many other people who I know do this?�

�Beats me.&nbsp; I&#8217;m always surprised when I discover that someone I know is owned.�&nbsp; Charity turned her head and kissed Anna&#8217;s cheek and draped an arm across her back, letting her hand glide down to squeeze the other girl&#8217;s bottom.&nbsp; �I need sex,� she whispered huskily.&nbsp; �If I don&#8217;t get sex, I think I&#8217;m going to scream.�

Anna gasped.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t know if Charity was kidding or not.&nbsp; She couldn&#8217;t believe that anyone would surrender like that but she also couldn&#8217;t afford to find out if Charity was bluffing.

�Okay, okay,� said Anna in resignation.&nbsp; �If I get you off, will you settle down?�

�I will for a little while,� grinned Charity.&nbsp; �I might need it again later if they don&#8217;t catch us by then.�

Anna rolled her eyes yet again.&nbsp; �Okay.&nbsp; Lie down.&nbsp; Do I need to worry about you making any sounds?�

�I don&#8217;t think I make a lot of noise.�

�Never mind,� said Anna.&nbsp; �I&#8217;ll take care of you.�

Anna straddled Charity&#8217;s head with her sex above the blonde girl&#8217;s face.&nbsp; She could always sit down on Charity&#8217;s mouth if she started making noise.&nbsp; Then she lowered her head and snaked out her tongue, running it over the bald mound.

�Ooooooommmmffff,� Charity started to coo as soon as Anna&#8217;s tongue came in contact with her skin and Anna immediately silenced her by squatting down and driving her own sex into Charity&#8217;s lips.&nbsp; Anna started again and Charity cooed and mewled again, causing Anna to squat again to silence her partner.&nbsp; This was repeated several more times.

�Okay, okay,� whispered Charity.&nbsp; �I get the message.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll be quiet.&nbsp; Just stop smothering me.�

Anna went back to work.&nbsp; She stabbed her tongue into Charity&#8217;s sex, tasting her slave sister for the day.&nbsp; She listened and Charity remained silent.&nbsp; She scooped her tongue between the slick petals and still heard no words or sounds.&nbsp; Finally, she started concentrating on the girl&#8217;s clit but she kept her crotch poised to be ready to silence Charity if she piped up again.

Charity did not just lie there, though.&nbsp; She was fascinated by the juicy sex above her face.&nbsp; She simply had to enjoy it.

Charity lifted her head and touched her tongue to one of the slick petals, causing Anna to jump.&nbsp; She giggled silently and then repeated her action to the other petal.&nbsp; This time, Anna lowered her hips, pressing Charity&#8217;s head to the ground to have her stop.&nbsp; Charity had to work hard to keep from laughing.

Her hands were free and she put them to good use.&nbsp; She reached down and found Anna&#8217;s dangling breasts which she captured and held.&nbsp; Anna hummed a protest and lifted her hips again, letting Charity voice the warning this time.&nbsp; �Sssshhhh.�

Again, Charity almost giggled but she was truly enjoying the talented tongue that was scooping into her sex and fluttering over her clit.&nbsp; Charity looked up and saw the cute, tight asshole of her current lover winking at her.&nbsp; She released one of the breasts and moved her hand to Anna&#8217;s bottom, letting her finger circle the little pucker.

�Mmmffff,� grunted Anna as she felt the finger exploring.

�Ssshhhh!� whispered Charity again.&nbsp; She circled the little rosebud again and then dipped her finger into Anna&#8217;s juicy sex.&nbsp; She did this several more times, each time painting the cute little asshole with the girl&#8217;s juices.

Anna&#8217;s mind was swirling at this point.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t know what to do.&nbsp; She was not used to anyone touching her there.&nbsp; But she couldn&#8217;t make a stink about it either, for fear of being discovered.&nbsp; She decided to concentrate on bringing Charity to climax and then she could end the assault.

Charity pointed her finger and then pushed.&nbsp; Anna bit her lower lip to stifle the groan that was sure to escape as she felt the finger violating her bottom.&nbsp; Then she started her tongue moving again.&nbsp; It took only a few more flicks before Charity groaned but the sound was muffled by Anna&#8217;s sex draped over her mouth.

�That wasn&#8217;t very nice,� said Anna as they lay side by side afterwards, peeking out of the little window.

�Mmmm,� cooed Charity.&nbsp; �That&#8217;s where you&#8217;re wrong.&nbsp; That was very, very nice.�

�I meant the asshole thing.�

�Oh,� said Charity innocently.&nbsp; �It just looked so inviting.&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t help myself.�&nbsp; Anna just rolled her eyes.

The day dragged on.&nbsp; At several points, Charity recommended that they move to a different hiding place.&nbsp; She was getting bored being cooped up in the little cave that they had created.&nbsp; Anna told her to go ahead if she wanted but she was staying put.&nbsp; Her goal was to evade capture.&nbsp; Charity agreed to stay but only if Anna would have sex with her again.&nbsp; Every hour or so, Anna would have to service her cell mate to keep her content and to keep her from complaining.

They continued to see slaves being carried or led from the hunting grounds.&nbsp; One of the last ones they saw was Jill who was walking proudly as a male held onto her leash.&nbsp; After that, they didn&#8217;t see anyone for about an hour.

�I wouldn&#8217;t bother with that,� they heard a female voice say.&nbsp; Charity gasped as she heard Claire, her mistress&#8217; best friend.&nbsp; �We all saw all of them go into the woods.�

�Let me just check,� another voice said.&nbsp; �It&#8217;s the only place we haven&#8217;t looked so far.�&nbsp; Charity gasped again.&nbsp; This was the voice of her Aunt Janice, her mistress.

Both girls tensed and pressed their bodies together, as if that would make them harder to see.&nbsp; They heard a pair of footsteps coming closer and then saw the grasses that they had arranged moving.&nbsp; Suddenly, sunlight was streaming into their little makeshift cave and they both groaned.

�Hello, girls,� smiled Aunt Janice.&nbsp; Then the head disappeared for a moment and they heard her call out.&nbsp; �They&#8217;re over here, Claire.&nbsp; I&#8217;m taking the new one.&nbsp; Do you want Charity?�

�Oh, my, yes,� they heard Claire&#8217;s reply.&nbsp; �I can never get enough of that cute little body.�

The head reappeared.&nbsp; �We can shoot you if you would like,� said Janice.&nbsp; �But that seems silly at this point.&nbsp; Will you surrender to us?�

�Yes, Mistress,� sighed Charity.&nbsp; Anna just blinked.

�What about you, beautiful girl?� asked Janice as she looked at Anna.

Anna quickly glanced around but, just as quickly, realized that there was no way to escape.&nbsp; �Yes, I surrender too.�

�That&#8217;s yes Mistress,� corrected Janice.

�Yes, Mistress,� repeated Anna.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t know why but a little thrill rushed through her body as she spoke the words.&nbsp; �I surrender.�

Both girls were extracted from under the cart and their wrists were bound behind them.&nbsp; Claire groped and fondled the two girls as Janice tied them.&nbsp; Then they were led back to the barn.

Jill smiled as Anna and Charity were brought into the barn on their leashes.&nbsp; They were the last two captured that day and it had been over an hour since Jill was caught.&nbsp; She was the third from the last.&nbsp; It was clear that Anna had been focused and thinking because Charity was usually caught early in the day at these events.&nbsp; Jill was very proud of her young student.

The slaves were taken away to be cleaned up and used as their new owners saw fit.&nbsp; Then they were brought back together for dinner and entertainment.&nbsp; As always, the ones caught early in the day received the harshest treatment and Anna&#8217;s jaw gaped as she watched slaves being sodomized and fisted and whipped.&nbsp; She blanched as she watched a girl being fucked by a dog and wondered what torment lay ahead for her.

Emily suffered the worst of the four of them since she was one of the earlier ones caught.&nbsp; She was bound to an X-shaped cross with her limbs stretched tightly.&nbsp; Leather bands were wound around her chest, above and below her breasts, securing her tightly to the frame.&nbsp; Then Anna watched with horror in her eyes as she saw one of the mistresses pushing long slender needles into Emily&#8217;s perfectly formed breasts.

Emily whimpered with each new needle but did not cry out.&nbsp; Anna thought she was very brave to be enduring the punishment so stoically.&nbsp; The mistress inserted all of the needles near the base of the poor girl&#8217;s breasts.&nbsp; She would lift the breast in one hand, cradling it and instructing Emily to look down and watch as the next needle was pushed slowly into the tender flesh.&nbsp; That must have been the worst part, thought Anna; having to watch your breasts being skewered.&nbsp; She saw tears rolling down Emily&#8217;s cheeks as each new needle was pushed home.&nbsp; Eventually, there were eight needles through the base of each breast, each pushed from a different angle.

Once that was completed, the mistress inserted four more in each breast, halfway between the base and the nipple.&nbsp; Again, they were arranged symmetrically and were pushed from different directions.&nbsp; And again, Emily acted very bravely.

But Anna had been wrong about what the worst part was.&nbsp; After the mistress had finished with the needles that penetrated the soft swells of the girl&#8217;s breasts, she had two more to plant.&nbsp; Emily did cry out at these as one needle, shorter than the others, was pushed inward through the tip of each of her nipples.&nbsp; Tears were flowing freely at this point.

The mistress stood back and curtseyed to the crowd once she was finished torturing the girl.&nbsp; The crowd erupted in applause and Anna just stared in disbelief.&nbsp; She would never have been able to endure that!

Jill was caught near the end.&nbsp; For her part of the entertainment, she was mounted on a pole that stood upright with a dildo mounted on the end.&nbsp; A clothespin was attached to each of her nipples and Anna could tell by the grimace on her professor&#8217;s face that the clamps must be very painful.

Jill was instructed to fuck herself on the pole which she started doing immediately.&nbsp; Again, Anna looked on in awe.&nbsp; Here was her beautiful professor, her idol and mentor, performing so lewdly in front of the crowd.&nbsp; Jill&#8217;s whole body was tense as her legs propelled her up and down on the shaft that was buried deep in her body.

As Jill pumped the dildo in and out, the master who was giving her the punishment amused himself with a long slender whip.&nbsp; He used the clothespins for target practice.&nbsp; Occasionally, he would knock one off, causing Jill to squeal, but he would immediately replace it and begin again.&nbsp; Occasionally, he would miss the clothespin altogether and, depending on the angle that he was using, the whip would slash into her taut belly below or crash into the soft, tender upper swells of the professor&#8217;s breasts, eliciting a screech.

Anna wasn&#8217;t sure how her professor did it but eventually Jill climaxed.&nbsp; It was obvious as her entire body tensed and she let out a low guttural groan.&nbsp; That marked the end of Jill&#8217;s part of the entertainment.&nbsp; But Anna had no idea how she could have climaxed with all of those eyes watching and that master punishing her so much.

Anna was trembling at this point.&nbsp; It was only her and Charity left.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t know who they would pick next or what they would do.&nbsp; But she was sure that she could not handle whatever it was.&nbsp; Everything she had seen so far had been so horrible.

But the last ones caught were always treated lightly.&nbsp; For her contribution to the entertainment, she had to sixty-nine with Charity so it was simply a repeat of what they had done throughout the day in the security of the little shelter they had made.&nbsp; After the last of the entertainment, the dominants took their temporary slaves to their rooms.&nbsp; Once again, Anna&#8217;s tongue was called into action as she serviced Charity&#8217;s mistress and brought her to several orgasms.&nbsp; Janice reciprocated and rewarded Anna with several very satisfying orgasms of her own.

Wow, thought Anna as she lay in bed cuddled up to Janice at the end of the evening.&nbsp; �Anthropology is wild!!!�

Chapter 5

�Charity&#8217;s aunt was very impressed with you,� said Jill.&nbsp; The three of them were on their first of three flights that would take them near the island.&nbsp; The last leg of their journey would be by boat.&nbsp; Anna was in the middle seat and Jill and Emily flanked her on either side.

�Her aunt?� asked Anna.

�Yes, Janice said you were wonderful.�

�Her aunt is her mistress?� gasped Anna.&nbsp; �Wow!�

Jill laughed.&nbsp; �Yeah, I know.&nbsp; Most people are shocked.&nbsp; But they have a very special and very loving relationship.�

�I just love it when Janice captures me,� said Emily, reaching over and cupping one of Anna&#8217;s breasts in her hand.&nbsp; Anna immediately slapped the offending hand away and glared at Emily.&nbsp; �She&#8217;s so loving and considerate.&nbsp; It&#8217;s hard to believe that she&#8217;s a dominant.&nbsp; Charity is lucky to be owned by her.�

�Hmmm,� said Jill.&nbsp; �So does that mean that you would prefer to be owned by her, girl?&nbsp; I could always sell you.�

Emily gasped.&nbsp; �Oh, no, Mistress.&nbsp; Please don&#8217;t even consider anything like that.&nbsp; I love being owned by you.&nbsp; I wasn&#8217;t comparing to you.&nbsp; I was comparing to the other dominants.�&nbsp; Emily continued to babble until Jill finally told Anna to kiss her to shut her up.&nbsp; Anna did but glanced around furtively before she did that to see if anyone was watching.&nbsp; She sure hoped that they could not hear either.

Anna turned to Jill.&nbsp; �Dr. Wallings, why were you in the hunt?&nbsp; I mean why were you hunted instead of hunting?�

�We all had to get ready for the trip,� Jill replied.&nbsp; �I figured it would be good practice.&nbsp; And by the way, you should call me Jill until we get back to school.�

�Oh,� Anna said.&nbsp; �Sure.&nbsp; Can I ask you about your time on Saturday night?�

Jill laughed.&nbsp; �Sure.&nbsp; And then we&#8217;ll have Emily tell us about hers.&nbsp; A master named Jack bagged me.&nbsp; He always used to try to hunt me down when I was a slave.&nbsp; And he hadn&#8217;t caught me in over a year since I haven&#8217;t been in any hunts.&nbsp; So when he saw that I was prey that day, he made it his goal to catch me.&nbsp; I guess he&#8217;s one of my most avid admirers.�

�He&#8217;s pretty good,� she continued.&nbsp; �He doesn&#8217;t have any extreme kinks.&nbsp; He just likes to bind a girl; make them helpless and then fuck them silly.&nbsp; But he always gives me plenty of orgasms so I always come away happy.�

�Doesn&#8217;t your husband get jealous or upset when you have sex with others?� asked Anna.

�I don&#8217;t think so,� replied Jill.&nbsp; �He had better not with the way he&#8217;s been screwing you and Emily.�&nbsp; This caused Emily to giggle.

�Besides,� Jill went on.&nbsp; �It&#8217;s still a lot better than when he and I were slaves.&nbsp; He absolutely hates gay sex and my owner, our owner, was constantly fucking his ass or making him give blow jobs.&nbsp; He&#8217;s much happier now that he can just screw women.&nbsp; He caught a girl on Saturday and seemed to come away very contented.�

They landed in Los Angeles and then had dinner.&nbsp; The three of them slept through most of the second leg which took them to Manila.&nbsp; The last leg took them to an island near Papaluana.&nbsp; They spent the night there and then took a boat the next morning to their final destination.

The chief and his entourage met the boat when it arrived.&nbsp; His other katauha was with him along with his son and several of the warriors and their women.&nbsp; Jill was the first off the boat.&nbsp; She went to him and kissed his spear which he held casually.&nbsp; Then she quickly removed her clothes and knelt.

�Greetings, my great leader,� she said to him in Incunu as she kept her head bowed.

�Greetings, my leopard,� he said with a smile.&nbsp; The women of the tribe were extremely attractive with creamy, toffee colored skin and beautiful figures and faces.&nbsp; But it was the body of his Leopard Girl that he craved.&nbsp; �You have lost your spots again.�

Jill sighed.&nbsp; �Yes, my lord.&nbsp; Spots do not do well where I live.�

�Then you should live here,� he said.&nbsp; �Leopards need their spots.�

In the meantime, Emily and Anna had shed their clothes.&nbsp; It was a pretty easy task.&nbsp; They had each worn only a pair of jeans, a cotton blouse and sandals.&nbsp; It was Anna&#8217;s idea.&nbsp; Underwear would just be one more thing to keep track of and she said that they should not introduce something like a bra into the culture.&nbsp; Now, they stood at the water&#8217;s edge, awaiting instructions from Jill.

Jill ignored the chief&#8217;s comment about her living with the tribe permanently.&nbsp; �I have brought you a gift, my lord.�

�I love gifts,� he said.&nbsp; �But the return of my katahua is enough of a present.�

Jill signaled to the two girls and, on cue, they came forward, kneeling on either side of her and slightly behind.&nbsp; �I have brought my katahua again.&nbsp; The other girl is named Anna.&nbsp; She is a gift for you.�

Anna sucked in her breath.&nbsp; Where did that come from?&nbsp; Jill had not said anything about that.&nbsp; Anna had read all of Jill&#8217;s notes and assumed that she would just belong to one of the harems that the warriors looked over.&nbsp; What would it mean to belong to the chief?

�It is a beautiful gift,� smiled the chief.&nbsp; �I will treasure it always.&nbsp; I know just what I will do with the girl.�

Jill giggled.&nbsp; �I know just what you will do with her too, my lord.�

The chief laughed.&nbsp; �Yes, that too.&nbsp; But I have another use in mind also.�

He had each of the girls stand and then he gathered their wrists together behind their backs, binding them with a coarse rope made of local vines.&nbsp; The chief then led the ensemble back to the village.&nbsp; The children started squealing in delight as soon as they saw the shock of red hair of the Leopard Girl approaching.&nbsp; By the time they got to the center of the village, every boy in the tribe was sporting an erection.&nbsp; They couldn&#8217;t wait for nursing time to begin so they could suckle on their favorite breasts.

Anna looked around in amazement.&nbsp; She sort of knew what to expect.&nbsp; They had talked about life in the tribe a lot during their month of preparation and she had read everything that Jill had written about this society.&nbsp; But seeing it for real was still a shock.&nbsp; There was so much nudity and so much sexuality on display.

The chief looked into the sky and then turned to his son.&nbsp; �You become a man soon.&nbsp; You should rest.�

The son nodded and sighed.&nbsp; He was looking forward to becoming a man.&nbsp; He was not even afraid of the dangerous ceremony that lay ahead of him.&nbsp; But he now realized that his days of suckling on Leopard Girl&#8217;s magnificent breasts were behind him.&nbsp; He obediently turned and walked back to his hut, sighing again.

The chief turned to Jill and stepped close, lifting her breasts and letting his thumbs brush back and forth across the soft flesh.&nbsp; �It is time for the Leopard to be spotted.&nbsp; I will take your body later.�

Then he stepped up to Emily and repeated the actions, cradling her breasts and rubbing his thumbs against her warm softness.&nbsp; �My katahua&#8217;s katahua, you will dance on my spear tonight too.&nbsp; But right now, you must attend to your mistress&#8217; spots.�

He released the second pair of breasts and stepped up to Anna who was trembling slightly, unsure of what was happening.&nbsp; She felt so vulnerable all of a sudden.&nbsp; She was naked.&nbsp; She was bound.&nbsp; And the tall older man was standing in front of her, looking down.&nbsp; Again, the chief claimed a pair of breasts and let his thumbs dance over the silky flesh.

�My present,� he said.&nbsp; �Such a young, beautiful thing.&nbsp; You will spear dance while we wait for the Leopard.�

Anna gulped at the words.&nbsp; She was going to be fucked!&nbsp; Not only that, but the chief of the tribe was going to claim her!&nbsp; Her head was spinning and her mind was racing as one of the women led her to the hut.

Another woman was present; one who had been on the beach to meet them when they arrived.&nbsp; She was older and seemed closer to the chief&#8217;s age.&nbsp; Was this the chief&#8217;s other katahua?&nbsp; She knew that Jill was one of his katahuas but that he also had another one who was his full time girl.

The woman stepped to her with a bowl of liquid and softly told Anna to relax.&nbsp; But how could she relax?&nbsp; She felt like she was about to be made into some kind of sacrificial offering.&nbsp; She saw the woman dip her hand into the bowl and then blushed as she felt the oily fingers gliding over her skin, spreading the warm liquid.

The woman kept dipping her fingers and then coating her skin, making sure that every inch below her neck was covered.&nbsp; She paid particular attention to Anna&#8217;s nipples which were now stiff with extreme arousal.&nbsp; After several minutes, her body was glistening.&nbsp; She also felt a tingling sensation and felt as if her pussy was clenching.&nbsp; Was this oil like the Banka that Jill had given her back at school?

She glanced at the chief who was standing with his hands on his hips and blushed again.&nbsp; His breechcloth had been pushed aside by his cock which had hardened and elongated.&nbsp; She gulped as she saw the size of the massive tool.&nbsp; It was far larger than anything she had ever taken before.

She remembered Jill&#8217;s advice on sex with the Incunu.&nbsp; They liked to think that they were in charge but they also highly valued spirited girls.&nbsp; Anna should let the males take the lead at the beginning but should gradually move into a role of leading the pleasure giving.&nbsp; It was a fine line to walk according to Jill.&nbsp; But she would try her best.&nbsp; She did not have nearly as much experience as Jill but she would give it her all to try to fit into the tribe.

The woman set the oil aside and then went to the chief.&nbsp; She untied his breechcloth and then ran her fingers, which were still slick with the oil, up and down his cock.&nbsp; He closed his eyes and let out a long contented sigh.

The chief lay back on a cushion which was in the center of the hut.&nbsp; The woman moved Anna until she was straddling the chief&#8217;s hips.&nbsp; Because her hands were still bound behind her back, she was awkward in her movements and the woman helped her to crouch down, holding onto her to balance her.

Oh, my gosh, thought Anna.&nbsp; She&#8217;s going to stay here while he fucks her!&nbsp; This woman was essentially his wife and she was going to watch as her husband fucked another woman!

The woman reached between the chief and Anna and grasped the cock, positioning it as she continued to help Anna descend.&nbsp; Anna sucked in her breath as she felt the tip of the shaft come in contact with her petals and then let out a low moan as the woman pushed her lower.&nbsp; The cock slid easily into her overheated body and made a slow journey into her womanhood.&nbsp; Her worries about being able to handle its size, however, turned out to be unfounded and she was amazed that she was able to accommodate the log.

The katahua finally pushed Anna down, fully impaling her and coaxing a groan out of her.&nbsp; Then she gripped the oily breasts with her oily fingers and guided the girl up and down on the shaft.&nbsp; The chief watched his katahua handling the girl and admired the youthful, firm flesh of the creature who was worshipping his cock.&nbsp; She looked perfect to him.

He started to have second thoughts about how he would use the gift that Leopard Girl had given him.&nbsp; Maybe he should keep the girl for his own.&nbsp; He already had two katahua so some people would probably view him as greedy for claiming a third.&nbsp; But Leopard Girl only came to the island occasionally.&nbsp; And this lithe, beautiful form on his cock had never been to the island ever before.&nbsp; For most of the year, he lived with only one katahua.&nbsp; And after all, he was the chief.&nbsp; He deserved another katahua, didn&#8217;t he?&nbsp; In the meantime, as he pondered what to do with the girl, he would enjoy this wondrous creature from the outside world.

Be a spirited girl, thought Anna as she remembered Jill&#8217;s words.&nbsp; Be a spirited girl.&nbsp; Be a spirited girl.&nbsp; How in the heck was she supposed to do that when she was held in place by the log embedded in her sex and with her wrists bound behind her back?

She bent down.&nbsp; Initially, she was going to feed her breasts to the chief but she was afraid that she would topple forward in the process without the use of her hands.&nbsp; She had to settle for letting her hair drape across his face and brushing it back and forth.&nbsp; He seemed to like it.&nbsp; �You have fire, girl,� he said.&nbsp; At least that&#8217;s what she thought he said.&nbsp; She was still learning the Incunu language.

The katahua saw what the girl was trying to do.&nbsp; She was surprised that someone so new to the tribe would show so much initiative.&nbsp; But then again, she was a friend of Leopard Girl&#8217;s.&nbsp; Anything with the tribe&#8217;s Leopard was possible.&nbsp; The katahua released the rope that was binding the girl&#8217;s wrists and then watched.

With her hands free, Anna had much more mobility.&nbsp; She leaned forward, placing her hands on either side of the chief&#8217;s head.&nbsp; Then she lowered her chest until her left nipple brushed across his lips.&nbsp; He opened his mouth to capture it but she giggled and shifted it away, moving her right nipple across his lips.&nbsp; He tried to capture it but she shifted again.&nbsp; A game of cat and mouse began but she was sure to let the cat occasionally capture one of the two mice.

The katahua was caressing Anna&#8217;s body, letting her hands roam over her belly and back and bottom.&nbsp; Anna kept feeding her breasts to the chief, occasionally letting him even catch one and hold onto it for a little bit.&nbsp; After awhile, Anna reached between the bodies and cradled the chief&#8217;s heavy balls in her hand, squeezing them lightly and extracting a moan from him.

The chief prided himself on being able to control himself and prolong his sexual play.&nbsp; But this nymph-like girl was making him lose his waiting game.&nbsp; Nipples teased his lips.&nbsp; Fingers squeezed and rolled his balls.&nbsp; And the buttery, tight pussy that was wrapped around his cock was pulsing and gripping him in a way that made him lose total control.&nbsp; He groaned as his seed shot deep into her womb, leaving him panting and breathless.

The katahua took over from there.&nbsp; She gently helped Anna off of the chief, hearing the audible sound of the softening cock slipping from her liquid channel.&nbsp; She washed the cock, which was slick with the girl&#8217;s juices.&nbsp; Then she laid Anna back on the cushion beside the chief as she picked up a highly polished wooden phallus and started pumping it into the girl.&nbsp; The chief recovered and started feasting on the girl&#8217;s breasts again until the two of them brought Anna to an explosive orgasm.

�I like my gift,� the chief grinned to Jill as he led Anna back out of the hut.&nbsp; Anna&#8217;s wrists were bound behind her back again and she obediently followed the tribe&#8217;s leader.&nbsp; Emily was standing behind Jill who had just received her spots.

Anna thought her professor looked so exotic.&nbsp; Her pale, flawless skin was now dotted with leopard spots which only enhanced her beauty in Anna&#8217;s mind.&nbsp; Dr. Wallings was beautiful and looked so erotic!

When she finally looked around, she saw that the entire village had gathered.&nbsp; She blushed furiously when she saw that all eyes were on her and her two colleagues.&nbsp; And her blush deepened when she saw all of the young boys unabashedly sporting erections as they stared at the three white bodies.

She was able to pick up much of the discussion, thanks to Emily&#8217;s tutelage.&nbsp; But she still had a lot to learn about the language.&nbsp; She heard the Incunu words for ritual and man and tomorrow.&nbsp; But much of the dialogue was lost to her.

She saw the chief draw Jill to him and hold her facing away from him.&nbsp; The chief&#8217;s other katahua did the same thing to Anna.&nbsp; She looked down and saw the older woman&#8217;s hands claiming her breasts and felt her blush returning.&nbsp; She did not understand what was going on but she felt so self-conscious to be held on display like this.&nbsp; Then she gasped as she saw the ritual beginning.

For the next hour, she witnessed what could only be described as a brutal and humiliating ceremony.&nbsp; The chief&#8217;s son was made to run through a gauntlet of the males of the tribe who were all beating on him with clubs and bamboo rods.&nbsp; He safely made it to the other end and grabbed something.&nbsp; Then she gasped as he ran again through the cloud of flailing weapons.&nbsp; After that, he carried rocks that were dangling from a rope that was tied around his scrotum.&nbsp; She watched a little later as one of the women of the tribe masturbated him to ejaculation.&nbsp; And then she realized what was going on.&nbsp; She had read about this ritual in Dr. Wallings&#8217; notes.&nbsp; The chief&#8217;s son was becoming a man.&nbsp; He was being tested.

When the tests were completed, the chief led his son and a small entourage down to the water.&nbsp; The chief returned alone about fifteen minutes later.&nbsp; Anna knew that the boy would be spending the night on a small spit of land that would become submerged when the tide came in.&nbsp; And she also knew from Jill&#8217;s notes that there were sharks out there.

That night, the chief claimed Anna&#8217;s body again and fucked her silly as Jill attended to the two of them.&nbsp; Emily and the other katahua slept soundly on the other side of the hut as the mini-orgy lasted through much of the night.

In the morning, the boy was brought back into the camp.&nbsp; He looked tired but seemed to be in good spirits.&nbsp; Anna knew that she would be a babbling idiot if she had to spend the night in shark-infested waters.

The next part of the ritual involved one of the tribe&#8217;s katahuas initiating the boy in the ways of sex.&nbsp; By mid-afternoon, the boy would be a man.&nbsp; The chief selected Emily, who was Jill&#8217;s katahua, to initiate the boy.&nbsp; This explained why Emily was allowed to sleep through the night and had not been called upon to service the chief.

Throughout the morning, Anna heard a chorus of sounds coming from the hut where Emily and the boy were.&nbsp; Grunts and coos; wet slapping sounds and the noise of things shaking.&nbsp; Groans from the boy and squeals from Emily.&nbsp; She even heard Emily shriek once.&nbsp; She would have been worried about most people.&nbsp; But she had made love with Emily enough to know that shrieks just meant very good orgasms.

In mid-afternoon, Emily brought the boy back into the center of the village.&nbsp; They were both completely naked and were walking hand in hand.&nbsp; Emily was sweaty and her hair was completely disheveled.&nbsp; But she wore a look of contentment and satisfaction on her face.&nbsp; The boy was sweaty also and was panting, trying to catch his breath.&nbsp; He looked even more exhausted than before but he had a sheepish grin on his face.

Anna felt so fortunate that she was able to witness this ritual.&nbsp; She knew about it from the notes but it was quite another thing entirely to see it for oneself.&nbsp; One of the women in the tribe wrapped a loincloth around the son&#8217;s waist and then tied the leather thong.&nbsp; Two warriors stepped forward.&nbsp; One fastened a knife to the new man&#8217;s thigh while the other fitted his bow over his shoulder.

Then the chief spoke.&nbsp; Anna could not catch it all but did understand bits and pieces of the speech.&nbsp; �You are a man� was the start of one sentence but she did not understand most of the rest of it.&nbsp; �Defend the women and children� was in the middle of another sentence.&nbsp; The chief finally concluded with another very long statement but all that Anna understood was the end of it which was �choose your katahua.�

Each of the warriors stood in a large circle.&nbsp; They held their katahuas and the remaining women of the tribe stood in little harems around their respective warriors.

The son opened his eyes wide at the smorgasbord of female flesh that was being displayed and offered to him.&nbsp; Emily had shown him the delights that a female body could provide and he was anxious to claim one of his own.&nbsp; He slowly walked around the large circle, appraising the women who were available to him.&nbsp; He could not take someone who was already a katahua but he could claim any other female who was of age as his katahua.

Each of them was lovely although some of them were too old for him in his mind.&nbsp; He wanted someone Emily&#8217;s age or younger.&nbsp; Actually, he would have loved to claim Emily herself.&nbsp; She had a tight little body that he had adored as he explored his first woman and she certainly knew what to do with it.&nbsp; Unfortunately, Emily was already a katahua.&nbsp; She belonged to Leopard Girl and was the only katahua in the tribe who belonged to a woman.&nbsp; It was a shame.&nbsp; He really wanted Emily.

Several of the women were very appealing to him as he made the wide circuit.&nbsp; He made mental notes to himself so that he would be able to make his final decision.&nbsp; He finally came to the chief who held each of his two katahuas with his arms draped over their shoulders.&nbsp; Leopard Girl held Emily in front of her possessively as her hands claimed her katahua&#8217;s breasts.&nbsp; Anna stood alone.

The son pointed to Anna and she sucked in her breath.&nbsp; �Can she be katahua?�

�She would be a very wise choice, my son,� the leader replied.

Anna gasped.&nbsp; She had only been on the island for a day and already they were talking about someone claiming her.&nbsp; And they were considering her for a katahua, no less!&nbsp; She trembled slightly and started panting.

�This is my katahua,� the son said proudly as he placed his palm on the top of Anna&#8217;s head.&nbsp; She started hyperventilating and was afraid she might pass out.

The chief smiled.&nbsp; �This one will make you very happy, my son.�

Anna looked over her shoulder at Jill for some kind of guidance or moral support.&nbsp; Jill just smiled proudly back at her.

The son was given a rope by one of the other warriors which he looped around Anna&#8217;s neck and tied loosely.&nbsp; Then he led her off to his hut as the entire tribe cheered him on.

�She&#8217;s going to be raw by tomorrow morning,� whispered Emily to Jill.&nbsp; �That boy is totally insatiable.�

�She&#8217;ll be fine,� Jill whispered back.&nbsp; �She&#8217;s Incunu now.�


Chapter 6

The next day, Jill and Emily set up the expedition&#8217;s equipment.&nbsp; This time, they brought three video cameras to capture images of the tribe.&nbsp; They figured out the best places to mount them to be able to get the broadest exposure to the tribe&#8217;s day to day activities.

The cameras fed their images via satellite link back to a bank of computers at the university.&nbsp; During a previous visit, someone had hacked into the computer that held the video.&nbsp; That was how the posters of a very naked Dr. Jill Wallings had been plastered all over campus upon her return.&nbsp; This time, she ensured that the computers were well secured so that the incident would not be repeated.

Each time they passed Anna&#8217;s hut, they heard the sounds of active and passionate lovemaking going on inside.&nbsp; Wet slapping sounds could be heard as the two sweaty bodies smacked against one another.&nbsp; The chief&#8217;s son was frequently grunting or groaning.&nbsp; And Anna was a nonstop chorus of coos and moans and mewls.

Emily just shook her head after they passed the hut for about the tenth time that day.&nbsp; �Don&#8217;t they ever wear out?&nbsp; One of them is going to have a heart attack at this rate.�

�Young love,� Jill sighed melodramatically and then giggled.&nbsp; �Well, I suppose they are on their honeymoon, after all.�

�Yikes!� gasped Emily.&nbsp; �Honeymoon?&nbsp; Does Anna know that she&#8217;s married to that guy?�

Jill laughed.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m not sure.&nbsp; But she knows that she belongs to him.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll have a talk with her after they settle down a bit.�

�Hmmm,� said Emily as they walked down to the water&#8217;s edge together.&nbsp; Their hands were not bound behind their backs today so that they could do their work but they still kept their hands behind them as if they were tied.&nbsp; �Do you think of the chief as your husband?�

�Oh, yes,� replied Jill, turning to face Emily.&nbsp; �Very much so.&nbsp; They don&#8217;t use those words but they use the concept.&nbsp; I am his katahua; wife.&nbsp; He is my master; husband.�

�How does that work?� asked Emily.&nbsp; �You have Bill.�

�Well, the chief has two wives.&nbsp; I have two husbands.�

Emily furrowed her brow as she thought.&nbsp; She had not realized that a katahua was the same as a wife.&nbsp; She thought it was a much more casual relationship since the men seemed to have sex with all of the women in their harems.&nbsp; �Then does that mean that I&#8217;m your wife?�

Jill smiled and brought her hands forward, cradling the petite brunette&#8217;s breasts in her palms and letting her thumbs brush against the soft flesh.&nbsp; �Yes, my little lesbian lover.&nbsp; It means you&#8217;re my wife.&nbsp; How does that make you feel?�

Emily blushed at the comment but part of the coloring was caused by a flush of arousal that sped through her body.&nbsp; �Well, I&#8217;m not sure that I&#8217;m qualified to be a lesbian.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m thrilled to learn that I&#8217;m your wife.&nbsp; Til death do us part.�

Jill leaned down and kissed her katahua as she continued to hold the breasts that she adored so much.&nbsp; �Til death do us part.�

Jill finally had to have the chief intervene on Anna&#8217;s behalf.&nbsp; She was afraid that his son would keep Anna on her back throughout the entire visit.&nbsp; But Anna was here to study the tribe; not to be studied.

Each day, the three naked outsiders were given several hours together so that they could meet and talk.&nbsp; They would share notes and make new notes.&nbsp; They would try to interpret the things that they had seen or heard.&nbsp; And they would figure out their research objectives for the next day.

Jill watched her student as she madly scribbled in her journal as the three of them were seated in a small circle.&nbsp; Anna was sitting cross-legged and appeared to be completely unabashed about the lewd position she was in with her sex exposed to the view of the other two.

Jill set her journal aside and leaned back, supporting herself with her arms behind her and admiring Anna.&nbsp; They had only been on the island for less than a week but already her student was turning a toasty brown.&nbsp; She let her eyes travel downward, drinking in the nudity of the beautiful girl.

Anna&#8217;s face was gorgeous and Jill could tell by the furrowed brow that she was deep in thought as she wrote out her notes.&nbsp; Occasionally, Jill would see the girl&#8217;s lips move as if she was trying to form some new word that she had learned.&nbsp; It was encouraging to see her student concentrating on her work.

Anna had her hair tied into a ponytail with one of her leather thongs.&nbsp; Another was tied around her upper arm.&nbsp; A third one was tied around her right thigh.&nbsp; Were these fashion statements or did they serve some purpose?&nbsp; Jill would ask her later.

Her long neck was almost swanlike and gave her an elegant, almost regal, appearance.&nbsp; Soft shoulders spread to either side at the base of the slender neck.&nbsp; Jill could only fully see one breast because of the position Anna was in but it was nothing short of perfect.&nbsp; It was magnificently rounded and perky despite its impressive size.&nbsp; And the nipple was stiff; almost begging to be toyed with.

The girl&#8217;s belly was tight and slightly rippled in the seated position Anna was in.&nbsp; There was not an excess ounce of fat anywhere on the girl and everything was distributed to perfection.&nbsp; Each leg was finely muscled and shapely.&nbsp; And the point where the two legs joined together had already proven to be like a playground for Jill.&nbsp; She loved to toy with her tribe sister&#8217;s body.

But she wondered what their relationship would be like once they returned to school.&nbsp; It was one thing to feast on the girl&#8217;s delicious body when they were in a primitive culture on a remote Pacific island.&nbsp; It would be quite another thing to continue it once they returned to civilization.

Anna glanced up and caught Jill staring at her.&nbsp; �What?�

�Oh, nothing,� replied Jill.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m just admiring my beautiful sister.&nbsp; And trying to figure out how I&#8217;ll dine on her body next.�

Anna giggled at the response.&nbsp; �Is it Banka time again?�

�Ooooo, yes!� Emily chimed in.&nbsp; �Banka time!�

Jill laughed.&nbsp; �Aren&#8217;t you the horny two?�

Anna blinked.&nbsp; �Well, you&#8217;re the one who was staring.�

Then Anna set her journal aside and raised her hands to her chest, lifting her breasts.&nbsp; �Are these what you wanted to dine on?�

Then she seductively trailed her hands down her belly to between her thighs.&nbsp; She trailed a finger down between her petals which were already parted and glistening with arousal.&nbsp; �Or maybe this is what you wanted to feast on?�

She slipped a finger into her sex and stroked a few times before withdrawing it.&nbsp; Then she slowly raised it to her lips, snaking out her tongue and licking the wet digit provocatively.&nbsp; �Mmmmm.&nbsp; You&#8217;re welcome to taste.�&nbsp; Then she giggled.

�You&#8217;re so bad!� chided Jill.&nbsp; �You never told me that you were such a vamp!�

Anna giggled again.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m really not.&nbsp; It must be this place.&nbsp; Or maybe the food.&nbsp; Or maybe it&#8217;s just from being naked all the time.&nbsp; But I&#8217;m sooooooooooooo horny all the time here.�

�Yeah, me too,� added Emily.&nbsp; �What happened to Banka time?�

Jill laughed again.&nbsp; �Maybe later.&nbsp; We have work to do.�

Anna and Emily sighed in unison and then returned to their journals.&nbsp; Jill resumed her study of her naked student&#8217;s body.&nbsp; After a few moments, Anna looked up and asked a question.

�Why do they kiss their fish?�

�Why do they do what?� asked Emily.

�Kiss their fish,� Anna repeated.&nbsp; �Haven&#8217;t you noticed?&nbsp; Before they eat a piece of fish, they kiss it.�

�Oh,� said Jill.&nbsp; �I always thought they were smelling it to see if it was still good.�

�I thought so too at first,� said Anna.&nbsp; �But I have been watching them.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure that they kiss it.&nbsp; They might also smell it but I&#8217;m sure they kiss it.�

�Hmmm,� pondered Jill.&nbsp; �I&#8217;ll have to watch more closely.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll ask the chief about it too when I get a chance.�

�Hey!� protested Emily.&nbsp; �Who cares about fish?&nbsp; Where&#8217;s the Banka?�&nbsp; She crawled over to Anna and kissed the student as she let her fingers dance along the slick petals that Anna had recently toyed with.&nbsp; But they were interrupted by shouting coming from the beach.

Jill stood up and Emily sat back down on her heels, sighing at the interruption.&nbsp; �What is it now?� the little Brit asked.

�I don&#8217;t know,� replied Jill.&nbsp; �A lot of people on the beach.&nbsp; And they&#8217;re pointing out to sea.&nbsp; Maybe another invasion?&nbsp; Let&#8217;s go see.�

Emily sighed again but she and Anna rose to their feet and followed Jill down to the beach where all of the commotion was.

�Oh my gosh!� exclaimed Jill.&nbsp; Anna looked out to the water and saw an empty canoe.&nbsp; Near the canoe, a head was bobbing in the water.&nbsp; Arms would flail and then the head would disappear, only to reemerge for a moment.&nbsp; One of the boys from the village was drowning.

�He can&#8217;t swim,� said Jill desperately.

�He lives on an island surrounded by water and he can&#8217;t swim?� asked an astonished Anna.

�None of them can,� said Jill.&nbsp; �The Incunu can&#8217;t swim.�

�Well I sure can,� said Anna.&nbsp; She pushed through the crowd and ran into the water, diving cleanly into the surf.

�Anna come back!� shouted Jill.&nbsp; �There are sharks out there!�

Anna ignored the shout and started swimming.&nbsp; Her arms pinwheeled elegantly through the water, propelling her toward the drowning boy.&nbsp; Periodically, she would lift her head to make sure she was heading in the right direction.&nbsp; It was during one of those peeks that she saw the fins.

�Oh boy,� she thought.&nbsp; Maybe this wasn&#8217;t such a good idea.&nbsp; But she was committed at this point so she continued stroking through the water toward the flailing boy.

As soon as she reached the boy, he threw his arms around her neck for support but ended up choking her instead.&nbsp; She struggled with him to break his grip but he held on tight.&nbsp; She submerged herself to get away and that worked.&nbsp; As soon as the boy&#8217;s head went below the water, he released his death grip.

Anna surfaced again, this time behind the boy.&nbsp; She reached over his shoulder and gripped him across the chest.&nbsp; He struggled again, trying to grab her, but she rolled him to the side, submerging his head.

�Be still,� she warned him when she brought his head back above the surface.&nbsp; He struggled again and she dunked him again.

�Be still,� she repeated.&nbsp; �I have you.&nbsp; Just be still.�&nbsp; The boy eventually did calm down and she was able to start swimming toward the shore.

More fins were sticking out of the water now.&nbsp; They were keeping their distance but were slowly circling the pair.&nbsp; Anna used her legs to scissor-kick the pair of them back toward the beach.

One shark came close and Anna could feel its wake in the water as it swam by.&nbsp; Her heart was in her throat at this point but she really didn&#8217;t have any options.&nbsp; She continued to slowly kick her legs as they glided back toward the island.

The tribesmen were in the water, standing waist deep in the surf.&nbsp; They carried spears, obviously to try to fend off any sharks that might come near.&nbsp; Anna headed toward the pack and continued moving her legs, trying not to thrash around too much and attract unwanted attention.

A pair of hands grabbed her arms and pulled her to the beach.&nbsp; Another pair grabbed the boy and dragged him to safety.&nbsp; Anna stood and watched as the boy coughed and spewed the seawater that he had swallowed while he was drowning.

Finally, the boy stood up and faced the chief, pointing to Anna.&nbsp; �She tried to drown me!�

Anna blinked at the boy&#8217;s words.&nbsp; The chief merely shook his head.

�What are you talking about, boy?� asked the chief.

�Her,� he said, pointing at Anna accusingly.&nbsp; �She tried to drown me!�

The chief laughed and pulled Anna to him, draping an arm over her shoulder and grasping one of her breasts.&nbsp; �She saved your life, boy.�

His fingers found the nipple and Anna felt a little thrill shoot through her body.&nbsp; Adrenalin was still coursing through her veins and the added stimulation had her body in a fevered pitch.

�Maybe I should give you to her,� the chief said to the boy as he held Anna and continued to toy with her nipple.&nbsp; �Maybe you should become her katahua.&nbsp; Would that seem fair?�

The boy gasped and Anna watched as the blood drained from his face.&nbsp; �Or maybe you could just thank her for saving you,� the chief continued.

The boy gulped but then turned to Anna.&nbsp; An apology was obviously difficult for him but he eventually uttered the words.&nbsp; �Thank you for saving me.�

�That&#8217;s thank you for saving me, Shark Girl,� the chief corrected him.

Anna blinked, as did Jill and Emily.&nbsp; First there was Leopard Girl.&nbsp; Now the tribe has a Shark Girl?&nbsp; Several of the men grabbed Anna and hoisted her onto their shoulders.&nbsp; She was carried triumphantly back to the center of the village where her new status in the tribe was celebrated.

There was a feast and everyone was dancing throughout the celebration.&nbsp; Couples fucked openly and without shame whenever the mood hit them and Anna blushed almost continuously at the lewd behavior of the tribal people who she was here to study.&nbsp; It was all so unreal.&nbsp; But finally, things started to slow down and the party gradually became tamer as the evening drew on.

�Where did that come from?� asked Jill as the three girls leaned back against a log near the end of the partying.

�Beats me,� replied Anna.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m a lifeguard but I&#8217;ve never gone swimming with sharks before.&nbsp; I guess the adrenalin just took over.�

�I guess so, Shark Girl,� nodded Jill.


Chapter 7

�I guess it&#8217;s going to be awhile before I change in the locker room after we get back,� observed Anna the next day as the three expedition members met again to share notes from the previous day.

�Yeah,� agreed Emily.&nbsp; �And now you&#8217;ve got a good incentive to keep your clothes on during dates.�

Similar to Jill&#8217;s leopard spots, Anna had received her markings showing that she was Shark Girl.&nbsp; The women of the tribe had spent the morning decorating her body; actually just decorating her breasts.

While Jill&#8217;s markings were all brown and muted, Anna&#8217;s were colorful with sharp outlines.&nbsp; The outer swells of her breasts had been the canvas upon which the tribe&#8217;s women had worked.&nbsp; Now, she had the image of a shark head on each breast.&nbsp; The nipple was the shark&#8217;s nose.&nbsp; A gaping mouth had been painted on each breast, complete with sharp white teeth.&nbsp; The outside of each breast was an ornate decoration of bluish-grey, red and white and a shark&#8217;s head could clearly be seen from a profile view of either side of Anna.

�I don&#8217;t know if I can suck on a shark nose,� giggled Emily as she flicked Anna&#8217;s left nipple.

�Better watch out,� warned Anna, reaching up to lift her breasts in her palms.&nbsp; �These haven&#8217;t been tamed.&nbsp; They might bite.�

�I just hope this wears off eventually,� Anna continued.&nbsp; �And I sure hope nobody hacks into the computer again.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll die of embarrassment if pictures of these get out.�

�I think I&#8217;ll love sucking on a shark nose,� said Jill as she leaned over and pulled the stiff little bud between her lips.&nbsp; Anna sucked in her breath as she watched her nipple being drawn into her professor&#8217;s mouth and felt the tongue fluttering over the sensitive little nubbin.

�I&#8217;d much rather bounce a shark,� said Emily.&nbsp; She reached out and placed her palm beneath the other breast.&nbsp; Then she bounced it, smiling as she saw the image of the shark head going up and down.

�Ever see a shark bite?� asked Jill as she took a break from suckling on the full breast.&nbsp; Then she opened her mouth and bared her teeth, closing it to clamp down on the nipple.

�Yikes!� screeched Anna as the teeth sank into her nipple.&nbsp; �Hey!&nbsp; Those aren&#8217;t toys!�&nbsp; She reached up to cover her chest and protect it from the two crazy women who were with her.&nbsp; But each of them grasped a wrist and drew her arms behind her.&nbsp; They easily bound her wrists together and then laid her down on the ground.

�Hey!� Anna protested.&nbsp; �We&#8217;ve got work to do!&nbsp; Stop horsing around!�

�The work can wait,� replied Jill who was now sliding between Anna&#8217;s legs.&nbsp; �I just love eating shark.�

�Mmmm, me too,� agreed Emily who had returned her attention to the prisoner&#8217;s breasts and was sucking the nipples into her mouth, alternating from mound to mound.

Jill snaked out her tongue and scooped it slowly up between Anna&#8217;s labia.&nbsp; The girl&#8217;s sex was already juicy with arousal and Jill gathered the nectar on her tongue, savoring it.&nbsp; Anna started to protest but Emily shifted her attention to the girl&#8217;s lips, kissing her to silence her.&nbsp; The shark decorated breasts continued to receive attention, though, as Emily&#8217;s fingers toyed with the firm mounds.

�I should have kept this one as my katahua,� remarked Jill as she paused and lifted her head for a moment.&nbsp; �I think I would enjoy owning this body.�

�Mmmffff,� mumbled Anna past Emily&#8217;s lips.&nbsp; Emily shifted her body around so she could more easily grasp the captive&#8217;s breasts.&nbsp; Then she gave each stiff nipple a sharp tweak as a warning to remain silent, eliciting a muffled squeal out of Anna.

Jill and Emily continued to feast on the delectable curves and swells of the bound girl.&nbsp; Anna&#8217;s head was spinning with lust again as Jill&#8217;s tongue continued to scoop and flutter and probe.&nbsp; Once Emily was satisfied that she had silenced the girl, she leaned forward, trailing her left breast across Anna&#8217;s lips.&nbsp; Anna sucked the succulent nipple into her mouth and hungrily drew it deep into her mouth as Emily&#8217;s lips captured one of Anna&#8217;s nipples.

The first orgasm caught Anna by surprise.&nbsp; Her body tensed and she let out a long, low groan around Emily&#8217;s breast flesh.&nbsp; But the pair of tormentors continued their mission.&nbsp; Jill sucked Anna&#8217;s clit between her lips and pulsed it, flickering her tongue across the sensitive little nubbin.&nbsp; Emily moved her lips from breast to breast, shifting her torso to alternate the breast that Anna would suckle on.

Jill placed her hands beneath Anna&#8217;s bottom, lifting the girl and further opening her thighs.&nbsp; Her tongue and lips kept up the assault and she started to rake her teeth lightly along the clit.&nbsp; Emily saw Anna&#8217;s belly starting to quiver and knew that a second orgasm was about to erupt.&nbsp; She ran her hands down the girl&#8217;s side and then lightly raked her fingernails back up the soft, warm flesh.&nbsp; This was all that it took to throw Anna into another orgasm and her body shuddered in climax.

They extracted four orgasms from the girl before they were finished with her.&nbsp; Anna was sweaty once again from the exertions of the powerful orgasms and was babbling incoherently.&nbsp; The two assailants finally knelt on either side of her, stroking her damp flesh lovingly.

�Who needs Banka when we have a beautiful slave girl?� giggled Emily as she ran a palm over one of the proud, decorated breasts.

�I definitely should have claimed her as my katahua,� added Jill.&nbsp; �Maybe I&#8217;ll plan on buying her.�

Anna shuddered again as she heard her two colleagues talking about her as if she was property.&nbsp; But again, she felt waves of arousal rushing through her.&nbsp; This place sure was different!

They helped Anna to sit up but kept her wrists bound behind her back.&nbsp; �Hey!&nbsp; What&#8217;s up with all of this?� questioned Anna, complainingly.

�Oh,� replied Emily.&nbsp; �That was just the Shark Girl initiation.&nbsp; Now you&#8217;re official.�

Anna rolled her eyes at the response.&nbsp; She knew that there was no such thing as a Shark Girl initiation.&nbsp; There has never even been a Shark Girl before in this tribe so how could they have an initiation ceremony.&nbsp; She was the first one.&nbsp; Jill and Emily were just sex-crazed lunatics.

�Well, why aren&#8217;t you untying me?� asked Anna.

�I&#8217;m deciding whether or not to keep you,� Jill responded.&nbsp; �If I keep you, you&#8217;ll already be gift-wrapped for me.�

Anna gasped.&nbsp; �You can&#8217;t be serious!� she exclaimed.

�Oh, yeah,� smiled Jill as she knelt down beside Anna.&nbsp; She gripped the girl&#8217;s chin and tilted her head up to look into her eyes as she slipped a finger into Anna&#8217;s sex which was still swampy with arousal.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m very serious.&nbsp; One of the advantages of immersion research, I&#8217;m learning, is that you get to enjoy the customs of the local society.&nbsp; And the custom here is that girls are owned.&nbsp; I&#8217;m trying to decide whether or not to add you to my harem.�

Anna felt a chill snake down her spine.&nbsp; Was Dr. Wallings being serious?&nbsp; And was she just talking about owning her on the island or did she mean that she would own her after the research trip too?&nbsp; She knew that she viewed Emily as her property on and off the island.&nbsp; And she knew that Emily viewed herself as Dr. Wallings&#8217; property.

�But I&#8217;m your student, Dr. Wallings.�

Jill continued to smile at Anna, making the girl increasingly uncomfortable.&nbsp; The finger pumped in and out a few more times until Jill plunged it deep into the girl&#8217;s sex, causing her to gasp.&nbsp; Then the professor withdrew the finger and used it to paint Anna&#8217;s lubrication across her lips.&nbsp; Jill leaned down and kissed the coated lips before extending her tongue to lick the sweet nectar away.

�I&#8217;ll still be your teacher if I claim you, pet,� said Jill.&nbsp; She kissed the tip of Anna&#8217;s nose and then kissed her lips again.&nbsp; �But I&#8217;ll be able to enjoy you more fully and much more frequently if I own you.�

Emily giggled.&nbsp; �I always wanted a baby slave sister.�

That evening, Jill had a talk with the chief.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t lead into the conversation with a discussion of Anna&#8217;s future.&nbsp; She had learned that serious matters, especially ones that dealt with trade, were never talked about early in a meeting.&nbsp; Instead, she asked about Anna&#8217;s observation about fish being kissed.

�Yes, of course we kiss the fish,� was the chief&#8217;s response.&nbsp; �We know that he fish sometimes eat those in our tribe.&nbsp; We hope that they show respect to our fallen.&nbsp; So we always show respect to their fallen before we eat them.�

They talked about many other subjects before Jill finally brought up her main topic of interest.&nbsp; �I would like to own Shark Girl, my lord.&nbsp; Before talking to her master about it, I wanted to talk to you, though.�

The chief raised an eyebrow at that.&nbsp; �But you already have a katahua, my katahua.�

�Yes, my lord,� she replied.&nbsp; �But I would like a second one.�

�But Shark Girl?� he questioned.&nbsp; �My son seems very much smitten by the girl.&nbsp; I&#8217;m not sure that he would give her up.�

Jill sighed and nodded.&nbsp; �That was why I wanted to talk with you first, my lord.�


Chapter 8

Jill had often wondered if there was something in the water or the air or the food of the Incunu.&nbsp; She never really felt totally like herself during her research trips.&nbsp; Early on, during her immersion research, she had become a warrior.&nbsp; She was normally not combative or aggressive in any way but twice already she had borne arms and fought for her tribe.

Also, she was always horny on the island.&nbsp; She normally had a healthy sex drive but it was normally something that required some kind of stimulus.&nbsp; On the island, though, she was ready to fuck all the time.&nbsp; Not only that, but she was not particularly choosy about who she fucked.&nbsp; She was always ready to spread her thighs for whoever the chief chose for her to mate with.

But her most recent action was what had convinced her that she definitely behaved differently on the island.&nbsp; She sold Emily.&nbsp; Actually, she traded Emily for Anna.&nbsp; It had taken quite a bit of negotiation to close the deal.&nbsp; The chief&#8217;s son required that she be available to fuck him each day if he summoned her.&nbsp; She had to clear that with the chief but it was easy for her to agree with.&nbsp; She would fuck anyone at any time.&nbsp; He also wanted to be able to suckle on her breasts whenever he desired.&nbsp; He missed the availability of her succulent nipples that he had enjoyed before he became a man.&nbsp; That was also easy to agree to.&nbsp; And he required that Emily be left behind on the island for one three month period between research trips each year.&nbsp; That had been the hardest term to come to grips with but she eventually agreed so that she could gain ownership of young, beautiful Anna.

She was out of control!

What was it about this island that elevated her libido so much?&nbsp; And was she the only one who was affected this way?&nbsp; She made notes in her journal about possible causes of her behavior and ways to test them to determine what was the culprit.

And as she made her notes, Anna knelt between her legs, lapping at her sex and sending comforting, erotic thrills through her body.

Despite her concerns about her behavior, she felt immense pride.&nbsp; She owned Shark Girl!&nbsp; The beautiful twenty one year old girl was now her property.&nbsp; How many college professors could say that they owned one of their students?&nbsp; Not many, she imagined.

She paused for a moment and combed her fingers through the lush brunette hair that was between her thighs.&nbsp; She wondered what was going through Anna&#8217;s head at the moment as she watched the flickering tongue.

Emily had seemed fine with the arrangement.&nbsp; She would still spend most of her time in the US as Jill&#8217;s slave.&nbsp; And she had always viewed the island as a sexual wonderland, so spending more time there was no imposition on her at all.&nbsp; The more orgasms the merrier always seemed to be her motto.

But Anna seemed to react differently.&nbsp; Jill saw her big hazel eyes looking up at her as the girl&#8217;s tongue dutifully lapped and fluttered and probed.&nbsp; Initially, she had been shocked.&nbsp; Even though she knew that the tribe participated in a form of quasi-slavery, she viewed it as more light and playful than real.&nbsp; To her, the slavery had seemed more virtual in nature than literal.

But that was before she was sold!&nbsp; That had changed everything.&nbsp; She was present for the negotiations and it was unreal.&nbsp; Unfortunately, she had learned the language and now understood everything that was going on.&nbsp; She couldn&#8217;t believe that her professor was actually buying her.&nbsp; She was going to actually be owned!

She also couldn&#8217;t believe the price that Dr. Wallings was paying for her.&nbsp; Jill agreed to ongoing sex with Anna&#8217;s former master.&nbsp; She agreed to letting the male enjoy her breasts each day.&nbsp; But most unbelievably, she had given the male her beloved katahua, Emily.&nbsp; This was crazy!

After the transaction, Anna was somehow able to compartmentalize her life.&nbsp; At times, she was a research assistant.&nbsp; She was observant and active.&nbsp; She took beautiful notes on the culture of the tribe.&nbsp; And she learned.&nbsp; That was her professional compartment.

Her domestic compartment was quite different.&nbsp; Somehow, the knowledge that she was owned had affected her in ways that she did not expect.&nbsp; She was docile and complaint.&nbsp; She tried to be pleasing.&nbsp; She wanted to be the perfect slave girl for her new owner.

Now, as she knelt between her new owner&#8217;s thighs, she looked up at the beautiful spotted woman.&nbsp; She dutifully ran her tongue up between the petals that were presented to her and paused frequently to flicker her tongue over Jill&#8217;s prominent clit.&nbsp; But she was in no hurry.&nbsp; Her mistress appeared to be deep in thought.&nbsp; Anna&#8217;s current job was to provide her owner with pleasure but she did not want to be distracting.

The fingers combing through Anna&#8217;s hair were comforting to her.&nbsp; She knew that her mistress loved her and that felt very good to her.&nbsp; She would be a pleasing and attentive and obedient slave for her owner.

She curled her tongue and slowly stabbed it into Jill&#8217;s sex.&nbsp; Her owner tasted delicious to her.&nbsp; She could not imagine anything that she would rather be doing than what she was doing at this very moment.

She still enjoyed a cock and Jill was always filling that need by sharing her with the chief.&nbsp; And her favorite experiences were when she could ride the chief&#8217;s cock, feeling it filling her completely, as Jill and Inkin kissed her and stroked her and toyed with her breasts.

Occasionally, she wondered what the relationship would be like once they returned to school.&nbsp; Would she still belong to her professor?&nbsp; She thought that would be fine with her but she was not sure what Jill&#8217;s plans for her were.&nbsp; And she wasn&#8217;t sure what others would think about that.&nbsp; Maybe Jill planned on keeping her as a secret slave.

�Oooooo, that&#8217;s nice, Anna,� cooed Jill after the tongue lazily swept up between her petals again.&nbsp; Her girl was turning out to be every bit the treasure that Jill had imagined that she would be.

Anna paused momentarily and smiled up at her owner.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m glad that you like it, Mistress.�&nbsp; Then she returned her attention to the task that she so much enjoyed.

Mistress?&nbsp; Jill wondered where that came from.&nbsp; She liked the sound of it but she had never instructed Anna to call her that.&nbsp; Maybe this had uncovered a part of Anna&#8217;s personality that Jill didn&#8217;t know about before.&nbsp; Maybe the girl had slave girl fantasies that she was able to act out in real life on this tropical island.

Or maybe it was the same thing that seemed to affect Jill when she was on the island but being displayed in a different way.&nbsp; Could it be that the drug, or whatever it was that affected her, just broke down inhibitions to allow people to behave more naturally the way that they were already wired?

If that was the case, then that meant that Jill was naturally a sex-crazed dominant.&nbsp; Emily was certainly sex-crazed also but she seemed to be submissive both on and off the island.&nbsp; Although she had spent years in the islands so, if there was some kind of drug involved, she might have become permanently submissive from the prolonged exposure to whatever it was.

And Anna, it seemed, was a natural slave girl.&nbsp; That worked out perfectly for Jill while they were on the island.&nbsp; She wondered how that would play out once they got home.&nbsp; Would the drug wear off to let things return to normal?&nbsp; Or did she now have permanent ownership of another person?

Jill set her journal aside and leaned back to fully concentrate on what the beautiful slave girl was doing to her.&nbsp; Every movement of the delicate tongue was highly arousing now and she knew her orgasm was only moments away.

Jill looked down across her body and saw her breasts rising and falling with each breath, occasionally jiggling as Anna&#8217;s ministrations sent a little tremor of pleasure through her.&nbsp; Her spots undulated as she breathed and looked even more exotic to her through her haze of arousal.

Anna looked exceptionally beautiful to her.&nbsp; The girl looked up at her, watching each reaction to her efforts.&nbsp; It somehow seemed even more erotic to Jill to have her girl looking at her as her tongue probed and scooped into her sex.&nbsp; 

Her girl.&nbsp; Yes, Anna was her girl.&nbsp; She now owned the entire perfect package that was kneeling before her.&nbsp; And it felt wonderful.&nbsp; She had never been so proud of anything that she owned before.&nbsp; This girl was her most treasured possession now and she couldn&#8217;t believe her good fortune.&nbsp; She hoped that her husband liked her new pet.&nbsp; But she knew that she didn&#8217;t need to worry about that.&nbsp; She had seen his eyes almost pop out of his head when he first saw the girl.&nbsp; And she had watched him enthusiastically and energetically fucking Anna.&nbsp; Bill would be delighted.

The mistress reached out and placed her hand on top of the slave girl&#8217;s head again, pushing her back slightly.&nbsp; She was getting too close to orgasm and she wanted to delay it for a bit longer.&nbsp; She wanted to continue this moment of reflecting on her new property.

Anna furrowed her brow as her lips were moved away from her owner&#8217;s sex.&nbsp; Had she done something wrong?&nbsp; She glanced down at the petals which were gaping open and wet with arousal and her saliva.&nbsp; The entire pussy seemed to be pulsing and Jill&#8217;s belly was quivering.&nbsp; That usually meant that Jill was close to orgasm.&nbsp; Why would she be stopped at a moment like this?

Jill finally returned Anna&#8217;s face to her sex and the slave girl resumed her worship of the succulent folds.&nbsp; It only took a few more movements of her tongue before Jill let out a long, low groan.&nbsp; Her body tensed and she closed her eyes, telling Anna that her mistress had just enjoyed a wonderful orgasm.


Chapter 9

The next two weeks were a combination of sex and learning more about the tribe and its ways for Jill.&nbsp; She and Anna and Inkin, the chief&#8217;s other katahua, were frequently summoned to give the chief pleasure.&nbsp; Sometimes he wanted one to entertain him.&nbsp; At other times, it was more than one.&nbsp; He seemed to especially like it when he played with one of them while the other two had sex together.&nbsp; And every possible combination of bodies was tried out at one time or another.

Emily only had to provide pleasure to one other person, although she probably had more sex than the other three women combined.&nbsp; She was only seen at meal time for the first week after the trade.&nbsp; After that, she was sometimes seen being led on a leash by her new mate with her wrists bound behind her back.&nbsp; Even then, he sometimes took her in the middle of the village or down by the beach, stopping her and plunging his cock into her sex to relieve himself of any sexual tension that had built up in the thirty minutes since he last fucked her.&nbsp; And Emily had been right when she predicted that Anna would be raw, although she herself was the one being rubbed raw.&nbsp; She was becoming sore from all of the heated and active sex.&nbsp; She was even walking slightly bow-legged and she wondered if all of the katahua were this sore.

In the meantime, Jill and Anna explored the ways of the tribe.&nbsp; They helped with the cleaning and preparation of the food that the men brought back to the village.&nbsp; Despite the fact that neither of them was lactating, they helped with the ritualistic nursing of the children that occurred several times each day.&nbsp; And they helped making rope and cloth and wooden eating implements.&nbsp; And Jill even had her daily nursing sessions and daily fucks with Emily&#8217;s new owner.

�Don&#8217;t they realize that we don&#8217;t have any milk?� asked an exasperated Anna after one of the most recent nursing sessions.&nbsp; She must have had close to a dozen children sucking on her breasts that afternoon.&nbsp; Jill had easily that many also.

�It has nothing to do with milk,� Jill replied.&nbsp; �You&#8217;ve got great tits.&nbsp; Plus, they probably like your sharks too.�

Anna sighed and leaned back against the log in the middle of the camp.&nbsp; Jill laughed and then added, �Don&#8217;t blame them.&nbsp; They can&#8217;t help it.&nbsp; I love to suck on them too.&nbsp; You really do have great tits.�&nbsp; Anna just rolled her eyes.&nbsp; She was in her professional compartment at the moment.

Near the end of the second week, Jill convinced the chief to intervene on Emily&#8217;s behalf.&nbsp; She was sure that the girl could use a break from the nonstop orgy that was her �honeymoon� with the chief&#8217;s son.&nbsp; He did so and Emily got to spend much of her day with Jill and Anna, much to her relief.

As Leopard Girl, Jill was the only woman in the tribe who was allowed to use a bow.&nbsp; She took advantage of this to take her two colleagues out into the jungle.&nbsp; They could normally only do this with a warrior as an escort to protect them.

Each day, the three naked beauties who were becoming increasingly bronzed by the tropical sun would venture into the forest to explore.&nbsp; They found beautiful waterfalls and landscapes.&nbsp; One day, they climbed up to the highest peak on the island and just stood there, enjoying the spectacular view.

On one day, Jill decided that she needed practice with the bow and she set up a little target range.&nbsp; She spent thirty minutes shooting, with Anna and Emily retrieving arrows before Anna spoke up.&nbsp; �Could I try it?�

Jill handed the bow and quiver to her student and now pet and smiled, �Sure.&nbsp; Have at it.�

Anna flexed the bow and took a few practice shots, getting used to the weapon.&nbsp; �Okay, here goes nothing.�

Anna pulled back on the bow string and aimed before letting the arrow fly.&nbsp; It sailed through the air and lodged off-center in one of the tree trunks.

�You almost got it,� said Jill, thinking that Anna was trying to hit the tree in the center.

�Oh, I thought I did get it,� said Anna.&nbsp; She started walking toward the tree which was over fifty feet away.&nbsp; When she got there, she leaned in and peered at where the arrowhead entered the tree.

�I did get it.�

Jill leaned in and looked.&nbsp; �What were you trying to hit?�

�This beetle,� said Anna as she lifted a hand and pointed.&nbsp; Sure enough, a beetle had been impaled and was pinned to the tree.

�You were aiming at that?� asked a surprised Emily.

�Of course,� replied Anna.

�Wait a minute,� said Jill.&nbsp; She picked up a stick and wedged it into the bark of the tree.&nbsp; �Let&#8217;s see you hit this.�

�Okay,� said Anna.&nbsp; Then the trio went back to where she had taken her first shot and she aimed again.&nbsp; �Where do you want me to hit it?�

�Anywhere will be fine,� replied Jill.

�I&#8217;ll clip it off where it enters the tree,� said Anna.&nbsp; Jill just nodded and rolled her eyes as she heard the claim.

Anna shot and then the trio went forward.&nbsp; As promised, the arrowhead had neatly cleaved the stick at the point where it had been jammed into the bark.

&#8216;Where did you learn to do that?� asked an incredulous Jill.

�My daddy,� Anna replied.&nbsp; �I have three older brothers so I was always being dragged along on hunting trips.�

�You can hunt with a bow too?� asked Emily in surprise.

�Sure,� Anna said.&nbsp; �I&#8217;ve gotten deer and pheasant and rabbits.&nbsp; Never got a bear but one of my brothers did.�

�Wow,� breathed Jill and Emily together.&nbsp; For the next fifteen minutes, they rolled coconuts to simulate moving animals.&nbsp; Anna hit each one, even anticipating some random hops as the coconuts hit bumps in the ground.

�You&#8217;re a good one to have around,� smiled Jill proudly as she gave her naked slave giril a hug.

�Yeah,� said Emily who kissed Anna&#8217;s cheek.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m sticking close to you.�

Three days later, the village was raided.&nbsp; It was the same tribe that had invaded twice before when Jill was visiting.&nbsp; This time, they brought more warriors, though.

The sentries spotted them landing at the far end of the island and ran back to the village to warn the tribe.&nbsp; The chief quickly organized the defenses and ordered that the women move toward the other end of the island where a cave had been prepared for shelter in emergencies.

�My lord,� said Jill as the women were gathering their things for the journey.&nbsp; �I would like Anna and Emily to stay.�

�Leopard Girl, you may stay,� he replied.&nbsp; �But the other two must go where it&#8217;s safe for them.�

�My lord, you are wisest, as always,� she said, trying to be as diplomatic as possible with her owner.&nbsp; �But I have not had a chance to show you Anna&#8217;s skills.&nbsp; She is a mighty hunter.&nbsp; And Emily will be useful in tending to the wounded.�

�I will take full responsibility for them, my lord,� she added.

The chief threw his arms up in the air as if pleading for some unknown god to help him.&nbsp; Then he rolled his eyes and just muttered.&nbsp; �Women!�

Finally, he turned back to Jill.&nbsp; �You would risk my son&#8217;s katahua and your own?�

�Only to protect you and your son, my lord,� she said.

He rolled his eyes again and sighed.&nbsp; �You may stay.�&nbsp; He had learned long ago that he always lost arguments with Leopard girl despite owning her.

Anna was given a bow as was Jill.&nbsp; Each of the three women also had their daggers strapped to their thighs.&nbsp; The chief gave them the assignment of protecting the village and repelling any invaders who tried to land at the village&#8217;s beach.&nbsp; Now, they waited.

The other warriors went toward where the invaders were reported to be landing.&nbsp; Fifteen minutes after the others left, six canoes showed up in the little cove on which the village set.

Anna did not wait for the invaders to land.&nbsp; She rushed forward toward the beach and started shooting as soon as they got in range.&nbsp; She picked off five of them before they started shooting back at her.&nbsp; Quickly, she fell back and hid behind a boulder, calling out for more arrows.

Emily crept forward with a fresh quiver as Jill and the other warriors moved forward and found shooting positions of their own.&nbsp; Anna moved to a new position and jumped onto a boulder, firing more arrows at the invaders.&nbsp; Four more slumped in their canoes.&nbsp; Emily ran back and brought more arrows to the rest of the defenders with arrows swooshing through the air all around her.

Just then, four more canoes appeared and the small defending party knew that they were badly outnumbered.&nbsp; It was Jill&#8217;s turn to move into action.&nbsp; She found a relatively sheltered spot between two boulders that gave her a good view of the canoes.&nbsp; She loosed a stream of arrows that immobilized six more of the invaders.

The canoes finally made it to the beach and the invaders jumped ashore, rushing forward.&nbsp; At this point, the Incunu warriors entered the fray and started shooting down invaders.&nbsp; But the attackers kept advancing.

Anna sent Emily back for more arrows when she saw two invaders creeping up on Jill.&nbsp; She bolted across the open area between them with arrows zinging past.&nbsp; One even grazed her thigh, creating a little trickle of blood down her leg.

She reached Jill&#8217;s position and hurriedly shot an arrow which landed in the invader&#8217;s chest, knocking him backward.&nbsp; She readied another arrow but the second attacker was already upon Jill and had her pinned down.&nbsp; He raised his dagger, prepared to stab it into Jill, but Anna had no clear shot at him without risking hitting Jill.&nbsp; Anna leaped, propelling her body forward and extending a foot.&nbsp; She caught the attacking male in the side of his neck with her heel.&nbsp; He let Jill go as he rolled away, jumping quickly to his feet to fight.

He was angry that he was interrupted from driving the dagger deep into the beautiful woman&#8217;s body.&nbsp; He was even angrier when he saw that a woman had caused the interruption.&nbsp; With his dagger in his hand, he lunged at Anna.

Anna ducked to the side to avoid the blade and chopped down on his wrist with the side of her hand.&nbsp; The dagger went flying but that did not stop the male from trying to kill Anna.&nbsp; He lunged at her again but she easily sidestepped him, this time driving her toes into his crotch.&nbsp; He howled as he dropped to his knees but quickly sprang up again to continue the fight.

Jill watched in amazement as her katahua fought.&nbsp; She picked up her bow and shot another invader who was coming to help.&nbsp; Then she tried to aim at the one attacking Anna.&nbsp; But the two of them were too close for her to get a good shot.

Finally, the invader managed to pick up his knife again.&nbsp; Over and over, he lunged at Anna but each time she ducked away and delivered another punishing blow to him.&nbsp; Jill was astounded that Anna did not draw her own dagger.&nbsp; The girl must be too caught up in defending herself to even think about it, concluded Jill.

The invader was in a fury at this point.&nbsp; He was bruised in several spots and was bleeding in some others.&nbsp; But he was filled with blood lust at this point and was determined to kill the girl with the painted breasts.

Jill noticed that her tribesmen had driven the rest of the invaders back to their canoes and were now picking them off as they tried to paddle away.

She looked back just in time to see the invader lunge at Anna again.&nbsp; This time, he held his blade high and swept it downward to plunge it into Anna&#8217;s body.&nbsp; But Anna remained spry and dodged again. This time, she grabbed his wrist and pushed it down and toward the male.&nbsp; Jill grimaced as she saw the male&#8217;s own long blade sink into his belly.&nbsp; Anna pulled upward, slicing the male&#8217;s belly open and then released it, letting him sink to his knees before he toppled face first into the sand.

�Where did that come from?� asked an amazed Jill after the battle was over.

Anna shrugged her shoulders.&nbsp; �I told you I had three older brothers.&nbsp; I had to learn to take care of myself.�

�Wow!� breathed Jill.

Emily treated Anna&#8217;s thigh and bandaged it.&nbsp; Another tribesman also needed a shoulder bandaged where a knife had stabbed him.&nbsp; Then the defending party headed off in the chief&#8217;s direction to try to offer help if it was needed.

They met the chief&#8217;s group about a quarter mile from the village.&nbsp; He was smiling when he saw the other group as he led his defenders back to the camp.&nbsp; �It was just a fake.&nbsp; They must have just been trying to scare us.�

�They did a good job of that,� muttered Emily under her breath.&nbsp; She was still shaking from the experience.

One of the tribesmen who had fought with the three women spoke up.&nbsp; �It was not a fake, my lord.&nbsp; They attacked the village.�

The chief stopped and blinked.&nbsp; �They did?&nbsp; How many?�

�Ten canoes,� replied the warrior.&nbsp; �Probably fifty men.�

The chief looked around at the group that stood in front of him.&nbsp; There were only nine of them:&nbsp; six men and the three women.&nbsp; How could they have held off a force of fifty attackers?

�I think we have another Leopard Girl, my lord,� the warrior said as he hugged Anna to him.&nbsp; �She fought bravely and she fought well.�

�And we have a Leopard Cub, my lord,� said another warrior, hugging the naked and still shaking Emily to him.&nbsp; �She was fearless as she helped to defend the village.�

The chief rolled his eyes.&nbsp; �May the gods help us all?&nbsp; More leopards!�

The three women remained silent during the walk back to the village.&nbsp; But the six warriors who had fought with them were quite animated as they related the story of the brave defense of the tribe.

Two of them even started a pantomime in which they acted out Anna&#8217;s hand-to-hand combat.&nbsp; They chopped at each other with their hands and kicked at one another until one acted as if he was dead, dropping to his knees and clutching his belly before falling face first into the dirt.

�Ha!� snorted the chief.&nbsp; Now he knew they were just making it all up.&nbsp; �Very good tale.&nbsp; You can be the tribe&#8217;s new story teller and you can amuse the children with your fanciful dreams.�

�It is true, my lord,� protested the warrior.&nbsp; �Here, I&#8217;ll show you.&nbsp; No, I&#8217;ll let Shark Girl show you.�&nbsp; He moved into a crouch and started approaching Anna.

Anna looked pleadingly at the male.&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t want to hurt you.�

�We have to show him,� the warrior said.&nbsp; He advanced closer and reached out to grab Anna.&nbsp; Anna just ducked away from him easily.

He kept advancing and Anna kept dodging.&nbsp; Finally, the male grabbed her from behind.&nbsp; She instinctively jabbed backward with an elbow, knocking the wind out of him.&nbsp; Then she bent forward and flipped him over her back, letting him land with a loud thud in the dirt.

The warrior looked up at the chief who just rolled his eyes again.&nbsp; The warrior knew that more proof was needed.&nbsp; He jumped to his feet and sprang at the girl.&nbsp; Anna just swung a leg around as she twisted out of the way, knocking the male&#8217;s legs out from under him and making him land on his back again in the dirt.

The warrior was exhausted and bruised at this point.&nbsp; He signaled two more of the defending party to attack the girl.&nbsp; Quickly, she had the two of them face down in the dirt as she stood behind them, totally nonplussed and not even breaking a sweat.

�It&#8217;s true, my lord,� said Jill finally.&nbsp; �She fought bravely.&nbsp; And she saved my life.�

The chief blinked and then looked at each of the nine people standing in front of him.&nbsp; The two males had painfully raised themselves back to their feet.&nbsp; �Is it true?�

�Yes, my lord,� said the first male.&nbsp; �Yes, my lord,� said the second.&nbsp; This was repeated until all six had confirmed that Anna had fought well.

�And she killed at least ten of the invaders all by herself,� added the one at the end as he dusted himself off.

The chief just shook his head in disbelief.&nbsp; Where were these superwomen coming from?&nbsp; How could they fight as well as the men?&nbsp; Actually, they seemed to fight better than his men.&nbsp; How could they do that?

They proceeded back to the village and one of the males led the chief around the battlefield.&nbsp; He pointed to Anna.&nbsp; �That one shot this one and this one and this one�� he went on as he led the chief along the waterfront.&nbsp; �And she shot four or five of those out there,� he said, pointing to the corpses that had been tossed out of the canoes and which were now floating in the cove.&nbsp; He led the chief to the other side of the battlefield and pointed to another invader.&nbsp; �She shot that one.&nbsp; And this is the one she fought with her hands.�

�And which ones did you shoot, my mighty warrior?� asked the chief.

�I shot one of the ones in that group.�&nbsp; He pointed to a spot where five bodies were lying together.&nbsp; He was not even embarrassed that the women had fought so much better than the warriors.&nbsp; He was just happy that they were on his side.&nbsp; �The Leopard shot this bunch over here,� he continued.

He led the chief to a spot where three invaders had been shot and more were floating near the shore.&nbsp; In all, twenty three invaders had been killed.&nbsp; Only half of them had escaped with their lives.

Emily&#8217;s gallantry was equally regaled in the telling of the story and they told of how she bravely ran weapons to the defending party and bandaged the wounded.&nbsp; Finally, Emily was sent to the cave to retrieve the women and children.&nbsp; When they returned, the chief declared a celebration and the entire village partied late into the night.

�Now we both have Leopards as katahua, my son,� said the chief as they watched Emily receiving her spots from the village women.&nbsp; One of the warriors had declared her to be a Leopard Cub for her bravery during the battle.&nbsp; �May the gods have mercy on us both.�

Anna was declared to be a leopard also but she did not receive any spots.&nbsp; After all, she was already Shark Girl.

Most of the villagers fell asleep at one point or another during the celebration.&nbsp; The three leopards sat together on a log, chatting.

�So what were those moves you used on that guy earlier?� asked Emily of Anna.

�Oh, I don&#8217;t know,� replied Anna.&nbsp; �I wasn&#8217;t doing much thinking at the time.&nbsp; I was just reacting as best I could.�

�Have you ever been trained in any martial arts?�

Anna nodded.&nbsp; �Yeah, a few.&nbsp; Like I said, I grew up with three brothers.�

�Do you have a rank or color in any of them?� asked Emily.

�Yeah,� nodded Anna.&nbsp; �Black.�

�Black in which one?�

�In all of them that I was trained in: judo, karate, and taekwando.�

�Wow!� breathed Emily.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m definitely sticking close to you from now on.�

Jill laughed.&nbsp; She wasn&#8217;t sure how successful this was as an anthropology expedition but it sure had been successful from the standpoint of surviving.

Chapter 10

Emily was quite proud of her new spots.&nbsp; She smiled brightly and walked with a new bounce in her step that caused her breasts to be even more animated than before.&nbsp; She knew that people would view her as weird once they went home but she was fine with that.&nbsp; They were just ignorant about the importance of the spots.

Anna was somewhat embarrassed about all of the attention.&nbsp; She was just glad that she did not receive any spots of her own.&nbsp; She never wanted to be the center of attention and she knew that everyone would stare at her once they got back to the university.&nbsp; She remembered how everyone always gawked at the professor when she returned to school with spotted skin.

Emily&#8217;s master&#8217;s lust for her grew to new heights after she received her spots.&nbsp; She wasn&#8217;t quite sure how to think of him, though.&nbsp; Was he her master?&nbsp; Surely he kept her bound and loved to parade her around on a leash.&nbsp; That seemed like a master.

But he also might be her husband in the eyes of the villagers.&nbsp; That sent a chill down her spine.&nbsp; She expected to get married again someday but no time soon.&nbsp; And she didn&#8217;t want to have to explain to a future husband that she kind of sort of already had a husband on a distant island in the Pacific.&nbsp; Maybe he was just a temporary mate.&nbsp; Or maybe she was just a temporary play thing.

Regardless of what her status was, he was horny� always.&nbsp; She had no idea that anyone could get erect that often.&nbsp; And he loved to ravish her just about everywhere on the island.&nbsp; But Emily was always horny too, so that worked out perfectly for her.

Anna realized that she was always horny also.&nbsp; She was constantly wet, which was new to her.&nbsp; She had no idea why that was happening.&nbsp; It was okay to be that way here on the island but she hoped that it went away by the time she returned home or she would be staining all of her skirts and slacks.

It was really useful here, though, she realized.&nbsp; Her mistress&#8217; master would plunge into her with barely a moment&#8217;s notice.&nbsp; He would lie her down on a mat or drape her over a railing or lift her up and then lower him onto his ever-rampant cock.&nbsp; It was fortunate that she was so well lubricated all the time or it could have been painful.

She was even wet during nursing time.&nbsp; This was one of the most bizarre rituals that the tribe had in her mind.&nbsp; The women would gather in the center of the village and would lay out their reed mats.&nbsp; Then the children would arrive and start nursing on breasts whether they contained milk or not.&nbsp; The children ranged from infants to teenagers and all of them helped themselves to the offered breasts.

Most of the women had their wrists bound behind their backs during this and had to put up with whatever the children did.&nbsp; There was no good way to stop them without raising a stink.&nbsp; So they endured the teeth and the harsh suction.&nbsp; Some children even treated the breasts as balls and would swat them back and forth.&nbsp; And Anna even found herself being groped and fondled and even probed at times.

�Do these children seem a bit forward to you?� she asked Jill at one point.

�It&#8217;s just a different culture, Anna.&nbsp; What seems forward to us might be perfectly natural to them.�

�Hmmmffff,� snorted Anna.&nbsp; �Well copping a feel is copping a feel.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t care what culture you&#8217;re in.�

�Of course they just seem to be copping a feel,� replied Jill.&nbsp; �They&#8217;re actually sucking your breasts and squeezing them.&nbsp; They&#8217;re too young to be getting to second base.�

�I&#8217;d be okay if they just played with my breasts,� complained Anna.&nbsp; �It&#8217;s when they diddle my clit or stab into my pussy that I mind.�

�They do that to you?� asked a surprised Jill.

�All the time!� said Anna.&nbsp; �They masturbate me!�

�Wow!� exclaimed Jill.

Jill watched Anna during the next nursing session.&nbsp; Sure enough, the girl who was suckling on her student&#8217;s breast had a hand between Anna&#8217;s thighs and was clearly stroking her clit.&nbsp; She decided that she should watch this over time to see how widespread the behavior was.&nbsp; 

Jill kept watching and chuckled at one point as she saw Anna trying to squirm away from the finger.&nbsp; There was an immediate slap to Jill&#8217;s left breast by the boy who was nursing on her right breast.&nbsp; Fingers gripped her chin, turning her face back to watch her nipple being drawn between the boy&#8217;s lips.

What was that all about?&nbsp; Did the children of the tribe play some kind of dominant role in this society?&nbsp; This had never happened to her before but, then again, she had always been completely compliant as the children nursed on her breasts before this.&nbsp; She would have to study this behavior.

Anna started moaning and Jill glanced over at her student again.&nbsp; This brought an immediate spank to her pussy and caused her to gasp.&nbsp; She looked back at the boy who had a determined look on his face, clearly indicating that Jill should keep her focus on him and not be looking elsewhere.

During the brief moment when she had looked at Anna, she saw that her student was in the throes of orgasm.&nbsp; Her head was thrown back and she was moaning.&nbsp; Her face and chest were flushed with arousal.&nbsp; And the girl who was suckling on her breast was still moving her fingers to prolong the orgasm, occasionally slipping her fingers into Anna&#8217;s swampy sex.

Jill kept her eyes locked on the boy.&nbsp; He smiled back at her approvingly as he repositioned her and himself.&nbsp; He pushed her back until she was lying on her bound hands and then straddled her hips.&nbsp; His cock was standing in front of him, fully erect as he reached forward and pushed her breasts together.&nbsp; Then he leaned forward and started suckling on the other breast.

She wanted to look around to see if all of the women were being dominated this way but she did not want to upset the youth again.&nbsp; Instead, she just watched him feasting on her fleshy orbs, seeing his cheeks hollowing with each suck, and feeling his very hard cock brushing against her belly.

�But I&#8217;m not dominant,� explained Jill to the chief later that day.&nbsp; She had just described the dominant behavior that she observed in the children.&nbsp; His response was that they were being trained to be dominant.&nbsp; The boys were always raised to be dominant.&nbsp; Now, they were going to raise the girls the same way.&nbsp; Some of them would still turn out to be docile katahuas and harem girls.&nbsp; Others might become future Leopard Girls.

�Why are you raising the girls to be dominant?� she continued.

The chief shrugged his shoulders and then stepped forward lifting her breasts in his hands.&nbsp; �I know that it is not a perfect plan.&nbsp; Treasures such as these should be protected so they can be enjoyed.�&nbsp; He bounced the breasts to illustrate what these were.

�But you have seen three attacks on our island,� he continued.&nbsp; �You were taken during one raid.&nbsp; I would have been killed if not for you on another.&nbsp; And the village would have been taken and destroyed in the third one if not for you and your katahua.&nbsp; We need more defenders.&nbsp; The girls are the only answer that we have.&nbsp; We will raise Leopard Girls from now on.�

Oh, no, thought Jill.&nbsp; She had been right to worry about changing this society.&nbsp; Because of her, traditions that were centuries old were being changed.&nbsp; No good could come from immersion research, she reminded herself.

�But the women should be protected,� she reminded him.

�You are not protected when you charge into the enemy,� he said.&nbsp; �And you are a woman.&nbsp; A very fine woman.�&nbsp; He illustrated this point by bouncing her breasts again and admiring the jiggling orbs of flesh.

Jill groaned.&nbsp; She wanted to roll back the clock but she could not imagine how that was possible.&nbsp; It appeared that, despite her best efforts at being unobtrusive, she had permanently changed the culture of this simple tribe.

�Come, my Leopard,� he said, grasping her nipples and pulling her forward.&nbsp; �We fuck now.�

She would not have resisted him.&nbsp; She would always comply with her chief&#8217;s wishes and desires.&nbsp; She was his katahua and she belonged to him.&nbsp; But she could not have resisted in any event.&nbsp; With her wrists bound behind her back as they almost always were, she was only able to follow him.

Normally, she enjoyed sex with the chief.&nbsp; Actually, after spending a few years as her boss&#8217; slave, she had gotten to the point of enjoying sex with just about anyone.&nbsp; She certainly had been taken by enough people over the years before she was finally released from her enslavement.&nbsp; Enjoy wasn&#8217;t actually the right word.&nbsp; It was frequently humiliating and debasing to be used as a sexual object that was owned by another.&nbsp; But she had gotten to the point where she could escape into her own private world and find pleasure.&nbsp; She almost always climaxed.

Today was different, though.&nbsp; The chief was as tender and caring as always as he slid his thick cock in and out of her sex.&nbsp; He caressed her body softly in a way that she always enjoyed.&nbsp; But she wasn&#8217;t able to get into the spirit of the lovemaking.&nbsp; She was too worried about the damage that she had done to the tribe.

He noticed it and spanked her ass which was upthrust in the position he had her in.&nbsp; �What&#8217;s wrong, my girl?�

�I am sorry, my lord,� she replied after gasping at the surprise swat.&nbsp; �I will do better.&nbsp; I promise.�

He reached around and grasped her breasts, using them as handles as he started to piston in and out of her again.&nbsp; The normal coos and moans were still not there, though, and he abruptly pulled out of her, causing her to gasp again and leaving her lying over the rail where he had been impaling her.

�You are not pleasing today,� he told her as he moved around to her head.

She sighed.&nbsp; �I am sorry, my lord.&nbsp; I will try to do better.&nbsp; I promise I will.&nbsp; How can I make it up to you?�

�You try again later,� he said as he tied his loincloth around his waist.&nbsp; �I will not give you the normal punishment for a katahua who is not pleasing her master.&nbsp; But the next time, I will.�&nbsp; He left the hut and Jill struggled to her feet.

They have a punishment for katahuas not being pleasing?&nbsp; That was the first she had heard of that.&nbsp; She wondered what that consisted of.


Chapter 11

Jill continued to worry about the potential damage that she had inflicted on her tribe.&nbsp; What would this mean about this loving tribe&#8217;s future?&nbsp; How would future generations where Leopard Girls were developed possibly reproduce?&nbsp; Would Leopard Girls have babies?&nbsp; If not, then the population would likely dwindle over time.

The children continued to get bolder by the day.&nbsp; Anna had been the first one to notice that she was being molested by the young ones.&nbsp; Within days of that observation, all of the children were toying with whoever they were nursing on at the moment.&nbsp; Jill constantly had at least one finger moving in and out of her pussy and frequently had more than one.&nbsp; And it was quite common to have a breast bounced or slapped around as the other one endured the nonstop suction of young lips.

The result was that nursing time became pornographic scenes of masturbation.&nbsp; And it wasn&#8217;t just Jill and Anna and Emily who were being abused this way.&nbsp; All of the women were being masturbated and toyed with and the entire village was filled with moans and whimpers during nursing periods.

All of her worrying continued to distract Jill from being able to please her master, the chief.&nbsp; He let her go the first time with a warning.&nbsp; After several days of it, however, he could no longer ignore her errant behavior.&nbsp; Something had to be done.&nbsp; Jill finally discovered how katahuas are punished when they are not pleasing.

It must not happen often.&nbsp; In all of her years of studying this tribe, she had never witnessed the punishment of a katahua or even heard of it happening.&nbsp; So she had no idea what to expect.

It came as a surprise that the entire village would be involved.&nbsp; Early the next morning, the chief led her to the center of the village where everyone was waiting for them.&nbsp; The other katahuas were assigned the task of preparing her and they worked efficiently to get her ready.

Their first step was to bind her into a frame.&nbsp; It was rectangular and her limbs were stretched to the four corners where they were lashed securely.&nbsp; This left her bound tightly in a spread eagle position.

She learned that the frame could be rotated in many different directions and the other katahuas swiveled it until she was horizontal and looking up at the sky.&nbsp; Several of them poured oil over her body while many hands rubbed the oil in.&nbsp; Something was in the oil, she realized, because the more they rubbed, the more sensitive her flesh became.&nbsp; It was not painful.&nbsp; But she could tell that her sensations were being heightened by whatever ingredient was in the oil.

The katahuas finished with her front and the frame was rotated again. Now she was looking down at the ground.&nbsp; Again, oil was poured onto her skin and the feminine hands rubbed it in.

Half of Jill wished that Anna was not in the audience, even though she knew that her student was there.&nbsp; As her katahua, Anna was one of the people who w as rubbing the oil into her skin. But she wished that her girl would not be forced to witness whatever was about to happen to her.&nbsp; The other half of her was glad that Anna was there and she hoped that her student took very good notes.&nbsp; This was a ritual that she had never observed before and she wanted a good record of it.

Anna was indeed there.&nbsp; She was not sure what to do but Inkin was instructing her on the proper way to prepare a katahua for punishment.&nbsp; She had just finished rubbing oil into the firm ass cheeks of her owner and now they glistened in the bright morning sun.

Inkin&#8217;s next instruction was to coat the inside of Jill&#8217;s ass.&nbsp; Anna gasped at the instruction and shook her head defiantly.&nbsp; She couldn&#8217;t do that to her mistress!

Inkin was understanding but insistent.&nbsp; She poured some oil between the taut globes of flesh and then grasped Anna&#8217;s wrist, guiding her hand to Jill&#8217;s little pucker.&nbsp; Anna had a dazed look on her face as she watched Inkin pry her fingers open and then straighten one.&nbsp; She gasped again as she watched Inkin push her finger into her mistress&#8217; rectum and heard Jill groan as her bottom was violated.

Jill groaned loudly at the intrusion and Anna felt the tight sphincter gripping her digit.&nbsp; Anna watched in disbelief as Inkin moved the finger in and out.&nbsp; She gasped yet again when Inkin straightened another finger and pushed it into her mistress.

Jill groaned again as the second finger stretched her bottom.&nbsp; She immediately felt the drug or whatever it was going to work inside of her as she became more and more sensitive to each movement of the fingers.

They finally finished working on Jill&#8217;s backside and Anna was thankfully allowed to extract her fingers.&nbsp; The frame was rotated again and, once again, Jill was looking up at the sky.&nbsp; Her skin felt tingly all over at this point.

One of the katahuas went to work at Jill&#8217;s head while Inkin and Anna stood between the bound woman&#8217;s legs with the older katahua instructing the younger one.&nbsp; The one at her head was fitting an ivory ring into Jill&#8217;s mouth.&nbsp; It was wide and the katahua had to work carefully to get it in place.&nbsp; Eventually, however, the ring was seated behind Jill&#8217;s front teeth.&nbsp; Her mouth was stretched open painfully and it was obvious that she would not be able to remove it herself.

Once again, Anna was horrified at the act she was being forced to perform.&nbsp; Inkin had coated the girl&#8217;s hand with the oil and then formed the fingers and thumb into a cone shape.&nbsp; The cone was then pushed into the captive&#8217;s sex.&nbsp; Anna was once again in disbelief as she saw what Inkin was doing with her hand.&nbsp; Inch by inch, the fingers were pushed deeper into her mistress&#8217; sex.&nbsp; Jill was groaning constantly at this point and seemed to be protesting the violation, but the words were garbled and unintelligible because of the ring gag.

Anna felt the resistance getting stronger and heard the protests getting louder as her fingers moved deeper.&nbsp; And then the resistance was gone and she heard her owner let out a long, low groan.&nbsp; Her hand was now fully embedded in Jill&#8217;s sex.

Oh my gosh, thought Anna.&nbsp; She had never even seen this act before, let alone done it.&nbsp; She knew about fisting a woman but she always assumed that it was just fanciful talk.&nbsp; Nobody really did this sort of thing, did they?

But obviously they did.&nbsp; She saw her wrist disappearing into Jill&#8217;s womb and could feel her fingers brushing against the soft, warm insides of her vaginal walls.&nbsp; This was so unreal!

Inkin continued to control the girl.&nbsp; She turned the wrist this way and that.&nbsp; She pumped the hand in and out.&nbsp; �Spread your fingers, Shark Girl.&nbsp; Move them around.&nbsp; Spread the oil so she is fully coated.�

As if in a hypnotic trance, Anna obeyed.&nbsp; She moved her fingers and stroked the soft membranes, probing every nook and cranny to ensure that the oil reached everywhere.&nbsp; Inkin stood behind Anna and held onto the girl&#8217;s wrist with one hand throughout all of this bizarre ordeal.&nbsp; With her other hand, she reached around Anna and toyed with her nipples, alternating between the two luscious breasts, as she murmured words of encouragement to her pupil.

�Good girl, Anna.�

�Feel her squeezing you.&nbsp; Feel her heat.�

�You are helping her to become better, Shark Girl.&nbsp; You are such a good katahua.&nbsp; You are such a loving girl.�

Anna&#8217;s head was spinning.&nbsp; It was so unreal to see her arm embedded in another woman&#8217;s body.&nbsp; It was so erotic at the same time and she felt her pussy pulsing with arousal.&nbsp; And Inkin&#8217;s ministrations were heightening that arousal as the older katahua played with her nipples and teased her.

Eventually, Inkin pulled on the girl&#8217;s wrist, slowly extracting it from Jill&#8217;s body.&nbsp; Anna was amazed at how coated her wrist and hand were with the arousal of her mistress.&nbsp; Inkin led the young katahua away from the captive and sat down, drawing Anna down with her.&nbsp; Then the mentor began to make love with the young girl.

Jill&#8217;s head was spinning now too.&nbsp; The oil had made every nerve in her body come alive.&nbsp; She could feel everything much more intensely now.&nbsp; Even the gentle sea breeze felt like a gale across her exposed and vulnerable body.

The remaining katahuas started the first torment.&nbsp; Each of them had a feather and each of them lightly drew their feather across the sensitized flesh of the captive woman.&nbsp; Jill gasped through her gag and pleaded for mercy as the plumes sent waves of sensation through her.&nbsp; But again, all that came out were garbled sounds as she struggled unsuccessfully against her bindings.

Inkin was all over Anna, kissing her and stroking her and fondling her.&nbsp; Anna tried to watch as her mistress was tormented by the feathers but Inkin kept turning her face away and ravishing her as the rest of the tribe alternated between watching the punishment of the negligent katahua and the Sapphic display being put on by the other two katahuas.

The feather dance seemed to go on for an eternity.&nbsp; Jill howled and gurgled as her sensitized skin was assaulted by the ticklish implements.&nbsp; Her body tensed again and again and she was quickly a trembling mass of tightly stretched female flesh that was being abused by the women of the tribe.

Near the end of the feather torment, Jill received her plugs.&nbsp; One was inserted into the ring gag.&nbsp; The long, hollow, phallus-shaped plug fit neatly into the ring and was pushed partially into her throat, causing her to gag.&nbsp; Because it was hollow, she was still able to breathe through it but it was very uncomfortable and thoroughly degrading.

A second one, even longer than the first and much thicker, was slowly pushed into her sex, filling her and stretching her around it.&nbsp; Finally, the third one was inserted into her ass.&nbsp; Thankfully, it was much narrower than the one in her pussy but it seemed impossibly long.&nbsp; The shaft seemed to keep sliding into her bowels forever, causing her belly to cramp painfully.

The katahuas were finished with their work.&nbsp; They rotated the frame again and positioned Jill upright.&nbsp; Then they each returned to their masters.

Anna peeked again at her stretched mistress but Inkin kept turning her face away.&nbsp; Then Inkin guided Anna&#8217;s face between her thighs and the younger katahua began to dutifully lick the petals and clit of the older one.

Jill saw one of the males step forward and drop his loincloth.&nbsp; The man&#8217;s cock was already fully erect as he reached forward, extracting the phallus-shaped object that was plugging her sex.&nbsp; She knew what was coming next but was still caught by surprise as the male thrust his member deep into her sex.&nbsp; He started to slowly pump in and out of her and her sensitized tissues went on overdrive.&nbsp; It was almost as if his cock was electrified and she was quivering uncontrollably with the arousal that shot through her body.

She climaxed and then climaxed again.&nbsp; Still, he kept pumping and her body danced in her bindings.&nbsp; He reached up and grasped her large breasts and she felt her skin come alive as his fingers sank into the abundant orbs.&nbsp; He grunted and she could feel each spurt of his seed as he deposited his load of sperm into her sex.&nbsp; The last thing he did before leaving was to push the plug back into her pussy.

A second male came forward, approaching her from the rear.&nbsp; Again, she knew what to expect but again she was surprised as his beefy shaft plunged into her ass.&nbsp; Once more, her body quivered and danced and trembled and shook as orgasms raced through her body again.&nbsp; He too gripped her breasts and squeezed, causing the over-stimulated flesh to send waves of sensory overload through her.

The male finally grunted and withdrew, leaving her hanging limply in the frame and making gurgling sounds through the hollow phallus in her mouth.&nbsp; How long would this go on?&nbsp; How much of this could she take?&nbsp; Were all of the men of the tribe going to rape her as part of this punishment?

She looked around to see if another one would step forward.&nbsp; Instead, she saw several of the youth move toward her.&nbsp; What did they have planned?

That question was quickly answered.&nbsp; Each of them carried an implement of punishment.&nbsp; One of them carried a switch which he whirled through the air a few times, making a swooshing sound.&nbsp; A girl carried what looked like a short, crude whip with many soft strands of leather emerging from the handle.&nbsp; The third carried a flat leather strap.&nbsp; She was going to be whipped!

The girl with the whip started first.&nbsp; She swung it upward between Jill&#8217;s stretched legs to land with a wet slapping sound against her exposed and vulnerable labia.&nbsp; Then she adjusted her position and swung downward, catching Jill&#8217;s clit.&nbsp; She howled at both strikes, feeling pain shooting through her body.

The boy with the strap started in after that.&nbsp; He swung it, hitting her hard across the ass and eliciting another howl as her overly sensitized skin was abused.&nbsp; Both the boy and girl continued swinging their implements of torture.

The other boy went to work once the other two got into a steady rhythm.&nbsp; To Jill&#8217;s horror, she discovered that his target was her breasts.&nbsp; Being whipped across her breasts would be horrible under any circumstances.&nbsp; But being whipped in her highly stimulated state was inhuman in her mind.&nbsp; Her howling grew louder and became a garbled shriek each time the switch bit into her tender orbs.

She looked down in disbelief and saw the thin, flexible switch slice into both breasts, denting them deeply.&nbsp; A loud crack accompanied each strike and a thin, angry, red line was left across her precious mounds when the switch was removed.&nbsp; This was sheer torture!

Thankfully, the punishment ended after only a couple of minutes.&nbsp; She was panting and trying to regain her composure as she hung in the frame, being stretched tightly toward the four corners.

The rapes, as she thought of them, began again.&nbsp; This time, the frame was rotated and she was looking up at the sky.&nbsp; The tube in her throat was removed and it was an easy task for the male to impale her mouth by slipping his cock through the ring that held it open.&nbsp; It was a long cock and it too was pushed down her throat, causing her to gag anew.&nbsp; And eventually, the male climaxed in her mouth, shooting his sperm down her throat before putting the plug back in and backing away to let the next one have his turn with the beautiful but errant katahua.

The frame was shifted again, this time to slightly raise her hips, but she was still mostly horizontal.&nbsp; She felt the dildo being removed and quickly replaced with another cock.&nbsp; Her breasts were used as handles as the male used them to pull himself deeply into her and her skin felt every subtle movement of his fingers and every not-so-subtle thrust of his cock.

After that male erupted inside of her, the frame was rotated, leaving her horizontal and looking down at the ground.&nbsp; The butt plug was removed and she groaned as a huge cock was buried in her over- stimulated rectum, stretching her painfully.

This pattern was followed throughout the day.&nbsp; She would be raped three times by the males and then would be turned over to the children.&nbsp; The children would torture her for several minutes and then she would be raped again.

The abuse by the youngsters of the tribe was the worst part.&nbsp; They were very creative and very devious in their ways of torment.&nbsp; At one point, she was upright in the frame but upside down.&nbsp; This left her pussy pointing upward which made it an easy target for the girl with the leather strap.&nbsp; Another time, when she was horizontal, two girls caned the soles of her feet.&nbsp; She had no idea how sensitive feet were and she only hoped that the ordeal had not crippled her.

She was exhausted and barely able to keep her eyes open by the time her punishment ended.&nbsp; But that&#8217;s when the chief stepped between her stretched thighs.

�Are you ready to behave, my katahua?�

�Oh, yes, my lord,� she blurted.&nbsp; All of the plugs and the gag had been removed by that point.&nbsp; The only remaining things on her were the ropes that secured her to the frame and a pair of nipple clamps that a girl had fastened to her earlier.&nbsp; �I am so sorry, my lord.&nbsp; I promise to do better.�

�We shall see,� he replied.&nbsp; He stepped closer and let his cock slide easily into her well-used sex.&nbsp; The drug had started to wear off but her senses were still elevated.&nbsp; She could feel every slight movement of the pole that impaled her.

Anna tended to her mistress once she was released from the frame after the chief deposited his seed into her.&nbsp; Jill was barely able to stand and Anna helped her into the chief&#8217;s hut, bathed her, and then laid her down to rest.&nbsp; Anna spent the rest of the evening riding the chief&#8217;s shaft as Inkin once again toyed with the young katahua&#8217;s body, enjoying the firm curves of the Shark Girl.


Chapter 12

The chief never said another word about the punishment.&nbsp; Jill apologized once more the next day and vowed to do better.&nbsp; Then the incident was left behind.

What Jill found truly remarkable was that there was not a single mark on her body the next day and there was no pain whatsoever.&nbsp; She had been whipped and flogged and paddled and caned.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of her holes had been violated multiple times throughout the day and stretched painfully around those huge cocks.&nbsp; And she was concerned that she would never walk again because of the assault on the soles of her feet.&nbsp; But she awoke the next morning and it was as if nothing had happened.

Inkin explained that it was because of the oil.&nbsp; She had never been struck hard.&nbsp; None of the cocks had been as huge as they seemed when they were plundering her.&nbsp; Even the nipple clamps that had sent intense pain through her breasts had only been tightened enough to hold them in place.

But the oil contained an ingredient that heightened her senses.&nbsp; Every slight tap felt like a punishing blow.&nbsp; She would feel the pain but there was never any risk of her being harmed or damaged.

She would also climax easily because of the oil.&nbsp; Jill admitted to Inkin that she experienced more orgasms the day before than she ever had in her life.&nbsp; She didn&#8217;t admit that she was worried that she was a pain slut, although that concern had gone through her mind.&nbsp; She was just very relieved that her wanton behavior was drug induced instead a manifestation of some sick perversion that she was unaware of.

There was less than a week left before they were to return home.&nbsp; Emily would be staying behind as part of the purchase agreement but the other two would be leaving the island in just a few days.

The chief decided that he should take advantage of the Leopards&#8217; last days on the island to train his warriors.&nbsp; He scheduled a day when Jill and Anna could help the men become better fighters.

Jill was assigned to teach the bow and some games of skill were developed that would test what the men were learning.&nbsp; Fixed targets were set up in the forest.&nbsp; Moving targets in the form of rolled coconuts and dummies in canoes that were pulled by a rope were created.&nbsp; And a scoring system was put in place to let the men know how they were doing.

Anna was assigned to teach them hand-to-hand combat.&nbsp; The warriors were then divided into two groups and each Leopard took their students off to instruct them.

The chief did not participate but he did wander from group to group to monitor progress.&nbsp; He was very proud of himself for having thought of this training.&nbsp; This would help his tribe significantly.

He was very pleased with how his Leopards were conducting the training also.&nbsp; They boiled each topic down to the basics and communicated everything clearly.&nbsp; They demonstrated everything so that it could be easily understood.&nbsp; And they were patient as people were introduced to new techniques.

But he was appalled by the performance of his warriors.&nbsp; They were good but not as good as his two Leopard Girls.&nbsp; He knew that ahead of time.&nbsp; This was why they were holding the training.&nbsp; What really appalled him, however, was the fact that his men were not improving as the day went on.

Could it be that they were just not capable of improving?&nbsp; He couldn&#8217;t believe that to be the case.&nbsp; These were his men, after all.&nbsp; He decided that it must be because they weren&#8217;t focusing.&nbsp; That was understandable.&nbsp; Even he, himself, had difficulty focusing on anything when the two beautiful girls were around him.

That&#8217;s when he decided to give his men an incentive.&nbsp; If one of his men beat a Leopard during a contest, he could fuck her.&nbsp; If the Leopard won, the male would be fucked.&nbsp; He sent for Emily to help with administering this incentive.

The men were aghast at the chief&#8217;s announcement.&nbsp; This was totally unheard of!&nbsp; There was a tribe on an island nearby that practiced gay sex between men but it was a totally foreign concept to their tribe.&nbsp; A man&#8217;s ass was sacred and was never to be violated.

The chief led Emily to the class that Anna was teaching and then the contests began.&nbsp; The first contestant to face Anna was trembling like a leaf and Anna quickly leveled the male.&nbsp; He was bound over a log and Emily donned a rope harness that held a wooden dildo in place in front of her sex.&nbsp; Then she plundered the unfortunate male&#8217;s ass as the other students watched in horror.

The second contestant fared no better, although he did last longer than the first.&nbsp; Soon, he was draped over the log and howled as Emily plugged her fake cock into his ass.&nbsp; This was great fun as far as Emily was concerned but the male obviously did not share in her glee.

It became clear that none of the men were going to defeat Anna.&nbsp; She was just too quick and too skilled for them.&nbsp; They moved as one when the next contest started and all eight of them attacked her.

Anna was very good and she managed to stay on her feet for a long time.&nbsp; She even managed to drop a few of them to the ground during the fray.&nbsp; But she was not good enough to hold off eight men.&nbsp; Finally, one stepped behind her and reached around, grabbing her breasts.&nbsp; She tried to get away but he held on tightly, using the fleshy mounds as handles to hold her in place.&nbsp; He took some punishing blows from her elbows and heels but eventually the others knocked her to the ground and subdued her.

�Is that fair?� asked Inkin who had been watching the contest as she stood beside the chief.

�They are expected to win in battle,� replied the chief.&nbsp; And then he grinned at her.&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t care how they win; as long as they win.�

Now it was time for the men to have their fun.&nbsp; The eight men who participated in the contest split into two groups.&nbsp; One would get Anna as their reward and the other would get to use Emily.

Emily was fine with this arrangement.&nbsp; She would take sex in whatever form she could whenever she could.&nbsp; It was totally humiliating to Anna, however, for a couple of reasons.&nbsp; First, she lost.&nbsp; She was not used to that.&nbsp; And even though she had faced overwhelming odds, she still thought that she should have won.&nbsp; The other reason, and more important reason, was that it was humiliating to be treated as a sexual plaything.&nbsp; She did not view herself as a toy to be won as a prize.&nbsp; This was so degrading.

The men enjoyed their prizes two at a time.&nbsp; One would fuck the girl&#8217;s pussy while his partner fucked her ass.&nbsp; This was their idea of a perfect school day.

Anna and Emily each received two loads of sperm and then their men were replaced by two new ones.&nbsp; The chief smiled as he watched his happy warriors enjoying themselves on the feminine delights of their prizes and then wandered off to see how the other training session was coming along.

Jill was very good but she was not as dominant with her bow as Anna was with her martial arts.&nbsp; She had beaten three of the men in shooting contests and she had dutifully donned her artificial penis and raped their bottoms.&nbsp; But two of the man had beaten her.&nbsp; One had already satisfied himself on her luscious body.&nbsp; The second one was enjoying her exquisite feminine form as the chief led Inkin into the clearing.

Jill was on her back with her arms bound behind her.&nbsp; The male was kneeling between her widely stretched legs with his cock pistoning in and out of her.&nbsp; He kneaded her full breasts and moved his lips from nipple to nipple, occasionally biting lightly on them.

He was truly enjoying this opportunity.&nbsp; It was almost unheard of to be able to fuck another man&#8217;s katahua, especially when that man was the chief.&nbsp; He had lusted after the gorgeous redhead for years, ever since she started visiting the tribe.&nbsp; Now, she was stretched around his cock as it kept plunging into her tight steamy sex.&nbsp; It was divine.&nbsp; He was in heaven.&nbsp; He only hoped that there would be enough contests throughout the day that he could enjoy her sweetness again.

Jill was not disgusted as she looked up at the male who was buried in her sex.&nbsp; She had tried her best to win but he had tried harder.&nbsp; He deserved to win the contest.&nbsp; But she was shocked at the stakes of the game.&nbsp; Katahuas were never shared with others except during the manhood ritual and during a katahua&#8217;s punishment.&nbsp; Even when they were shared during the manhood ritual, they were shared only for their sexual expertise; not to provide pleasure for the male.

And she had never heard of Incunu men allowing anal intercourse. Their assholes seemed to be inviolate.

But the chief had introduced both of these notions into his tribe as part of the games that were developed for the training.&nbsp; Were these things that were already part of the tribe and she just hadn&#8217;t discovered them yet?&nbsp; That was possible.&nbsp; Certainly she had never discovered how katahuas were punished before this trip.

Maybe, however, this was something new.&nbsp; Maybe her immersion research had caused these changes.&nbsp; Once again, she regretted having started down this path.&nbsp; But she quickly shook that concern out of her head.&nbsp; She could not get distracted again.&nbsp; She could not afford to be punished for not being pleasing again.

She cooed and mewled as the male&#8217;s cock moved inside of her.&nbsp; She could feel her orgasm building and only hoped that he would last until she achieved it.&nbsp; He bit down on one of her nipples again, eliciting a squeal from her.&nbsp; He plunged particularly deep, causing her to grunt but also pushing her over the edge.&nbsp; Her body tensed and was overwhelmed with an explosive orgasm just as the male reached his peak.

The two of them moaned together and the chief smiled.&nbsp; His men seemed to be enjoying the training program that he had designed.


Chapter 13

Anna finally stopped blushing at about mid-day.&nbsp; She had been followed and hounded all morning long between classes.&nbsp; Even when she was able to reach what should have been the safe sanctuary of a classroom, the onslaught continued.

People wanted to talk to her.&nbsp; People wanted to be near her.&nbsp; People wanted to touch her.&nbsp; People wanted to have their pictures taken with her.&nbsp; And most of all, people wanted to get her autograph.

It was bad enough that the posters had been mounted all over campus.&nbsp; It was just like a year earlier when the Leopard Girl posters seemed to adorn every wall on campus.&nbsp; Certainly Leopard Girl posters were in abundance this morning also, although they were new pictures showing a naked and spotted Dr. Jill Wallings.

But now, there were posters of Shark Girl all over campus too.&nbsp; It was truly humiliating for the young college student.&nbsp; And all of the attention she was receiving as a result of them was almost too much for her.&nbsp; There were three different poses of her that Anna had seen so far.

One showed her naked with a bow drawn and standing on a rock.&nbsp; She was seen in profile and the painted image of a shark head on her breast was clearly visible.&nbsp; Her hair was a wild mane that was blowing in the sea breeze as she aimed at a group of canoes, each filled with five or six men who were shooting arrows back at her.&nbsp; An arrow could be seen whizzing past her right hip, dangerously close to hitting her.&nbsp; She had to admit that she looked determined and defiant in the image.&nbsp; She was the very picture of confidence and strength.&nbsp; But it was so humiliating to see her naked body on display for all of her fellow students to see.

Another poster showed a different image.&nbsp; It was obviously taken the same day as the first one and occurred during the attempted invasion of the village.&nbsp; Anna&#8217;s image was full frontal in this shot.&nbsp; She was perpendicular to a male who was holding a dagger, obviously threatening her with attack.&nbsp; Every muscle in Anna&#8217;s body was tensed and her leg was extended, delivering a punishing blow to the male&#8217;s face.&nbsp; She looked very much like a warrior in this poster too.

But she looked like some kind of lewd, pornographic caricature of a warrior.&nbsp; Her dyed breasts with their shark heads were bobbing upward and the stiff nipples betrayed her obvious arousal.&nbsp; Worse yet, with her leg extended the way it was, her pussy was fully exposed and her labia were parted.&nbsp; The tropical sun reflected off of her slick petals, showing how wet they were.&nbsp; It was totally humiliating to Anna.

The last poster was the most humiliating to her, though, but probably because she knew the circumstances that it captured on film.&nbsp; She was not sure that anyone else would fully understand what was being depicted in the picture.&nbsp; In this image, her eyes were cast downward.&nbsp; Her wrists were tied behind her back and a rope was tied around her neck.&nbsp; Jill held the other end of the rope with her head up proudly and a hand on one of Anna&#8217;s bottom cheeks, obviously squeezing the ripe mound.&nbsp; Both women were completely naked.&nbsp; This picture had been taken only moments after Jill had bought her and she was being led back to serve her new owner.

She was sure that none of her fellow students knew what was going on.&nbsp; They probably just saw it as a lesbian bondage image, which was probably a good thing as far as Anna was concerned.&nbsp; She would hate to think that others knew that she had been bought as a slave just prior to the picture being taken.

The afternoon continued like the morning with throngs of people flocking to her as if she had come kind of celebrity status.&nbsp; Her hand was achy from signing so many posters but she continued to ink her signature.&nbsp; It seemed like the easiest way to get rid of her admirers.&nbsp; All three of the posters seemed popular but the one that was presented to her for signature most often was the third one, which exhibited her in the submissive pose.

They had returned on Saturday and Anna had quickly learned what Jill had learned after returning from her previous trips.&nbsp; Clothes were a nuisance at best.&nbsp; Shoes and bras were pure torture.&nbsp; And combs and brushes were completely irrelevant.

Anna glanced down as she walked across the campus to her next meeting.&nbsp; She had just shed the last of her paparazzi and was truly alone for the first time of the day.&nbsp; It was a very nice feeling.

She had considered wearing clothing that was more concealing when she got dressed this morning for school.&nbsp; She could have covered her spots but she decided against it.

Anna too had received her Leopard spots before leaving the island.&nbsp; It was true that she was Shark Girl.&nbsp; But after the defense of the village, she was declared to be a leopard too.&nbsp; The dyes on her breasts were fading at this point but the more recently applied leopard spots were still quite evident.&nbsp; People would see them eventually, she concluded.&nbsp; She decided against trying to hide them.

She wore what she normally wore to class� mostly.&nbsp; Her blue short sleeve cotton blouse allowed the spots on her arms to be seen.&nbsp; She eschewed the overly casual attire of her fellow students and usually wore a skirt.&nbsp; The mid-thigh khaki skirt left many of the leopard spots on her legs on display.

Like her professor, she had found all of her other clothing to be something akin to torture.&nbsp; Today, she was barefoot as she crossed the campus.&nbsp; And she had foregone her bra this morning, meaning that her breasts bounced and swayed with each of her steps, delighting most of the people who saw her.&nbsp; And her hair was still untamed by a comb or brush.&nbsp; Currently, she had it tied with one of her leather thongs in a wild-looking ponytail.

She sat down on a park bench to calm herself.&nbsp; It had been a hectic day.&nbsp; Maybe tomorrow would be better.&nbsp; She certainly hoped so.

Should she have gone on the expedition?&nbsp; She wasn&#8217;t sure at this point.&nbsp; It had certainly been thrilling and she had certainly learned a lot.&nbsp; Plus, it would look good on her resume to have the hands-on field experience.&nbsp; But a lot had changed as a result of the trip.&nbsp; She had changed.

She thought back to her final day on the island.&nbsp; She had been dreading that moment and wasn&#8217;t at all sure that she wanted to leave.&nbsp; Despite their unusual attitudes and chauvinistic behavior, she had grown to love the Incunu.&nbsp; They were her tribe.

She would especially miss the chief and Inkin who had taken her into their home.&nbsp; On the final morning, she asked to be able to serve them once more before leaving.

Her ability to serve them was hindered by the bindings which held her wrists behind her back.&nbsp; The chief was lying on one of the mats in the hut and she had lowered herself onto it, being guided by his strong hands circling her waist.&nbsp; She let the long thick shaft that stood erect from his body slowly penetrate her sex, wanting to enjoy every inch of its progress during this last fuck.

Once the cock was fully embedded in her, she stayed motionless, feeling it filling her completely.&nbsp; She half expected the chief to become impatient with her and start moving her up and down, but he didn&#8217;t.&nbsp; He just let her stay still.&nbsp; He must have known what was going through her mind.

It felt divine to be so stretched around his cock.&nbsp; This was the chief.&nbsp; This was her chief.&nbsp; And he was her owner&#8217;s owner.

After a little while, she did start to move, raising herself slowly until just the tip of the cock was nestled between her slick labia.&nbsp; Then she slowly lowered herself, again feeling the thick rod traveling into her body.

Finally, she established a slow, steady movement and was gliding up and down the shaft which was well oiled now with her juices.&nbsp; She asked that Inkin move closer and she leaned forward, kissing the older katahua&#8217;s mound.

Her tongue snaked out and she ran it up and down Inkin&#8217;s petals, tasting the sweetness of the woman.&nbsp; Inkin sighed contentedly as she looked down at the girl who was bouncing up and down on her mate&#8217;s cock as she tenderly licked and probed at her sex.&nbsp; She would miss Shark Girl.&nbsp; She loved the young woman who had joined the tribe only a month earlier and especially loved her talented tongue.

Inkin stroked the girl&#8217;s cheek with her fingertips and Anna looked up as her tongue scooped through the wet folds and her shapely form moved up and down the shaft buried within her.

The lovemaking lasted for over an hour.&nbsp; None of them wanted it to end.&nbsp; But eventually, they realized that they were running out of time.&nbsp; Inkin was the first to climax, followed shortly by Anna.&nbsp; The chief took that as his cue and launched his hot seed deep into the beautiful girl&#8217;s body.&nbsp; Soon after that, Jill and Anna were led, bound and naked, to the beach.&nbsp; Their clothes were waiting for them and they were allowed to dress before the boat arrived.&nbsp; There was much hugging and kissing and even a few tears were shed during the farewell.&nbsp; And then the journey for home began.

Looking back on it, Anna could not believe all that had occurred during the trip.&nbsp; She had grown to love those people in such a short time.&nbsp; How could that possibly have happened?

She was owned almost from the moment she arrived.&nbsp; Then she was given to the chief&#8217;s son.&nbsp; Then she was bought by her professor.&nbsp; How did she feel about becoming merely a piece of property?

And she had become a sex-crazed slut.&nbsp; Before the planning for the trip had started, she was very selective about who she had sex with.&nbsp; Now, it almost didn&#8217;t seem to matter.&nbsp; She would bed with anyone, it seemed.&nbsp; How did that happen and what did that mean about her future?

She finally stood up from the bench.&nbsp; Things were calmer now.&nbsp; The crowds had left her alone for the first time in the day.&nbsp; She started walking again.

She reached her destination and walked down the long hallway with her breasts bouncing beneath her shirt.&nbsp; Thankfully, it was the end of the day and the hallway was empty of students.&nbsp; Posters of her and Dr. Wallings were on the walls that she walked by and she paused to look up one that she had not seen before.&nbsp; It showed Jill during one of the nursing sessions.&nbsp; A girl was suckling at the beautiful bountiful breast as she stroked Jill&#8217;s sex.&nbsp; The labia were parted and shiny in the bright tropical sun.&nbsp; And a line of boys with erections waited in line for their turn to nurse on the redhead&#8217;s magnificent orbs.

�She must hate that one,� muttered Anna under her breath.&nbsp; Then she turned and continued down the hall.&nbsp; She finally reached the door and opened it, stepping through.

�I&#8217;m ready now, Mistress,� Anna said.

�Good, pet,�&#8217; smiled Jill from behind her desk.&nbsp; �So am I.&nbsp; I just finished up.&nbsp; Let&#8217;s go home.�

�Yes, Mistress,� smiled Anna.&nbsp; Yes, her life had permanently changed because of anthropology.&nbsp; And she was very happy that she was now the property of Dr. Wallings.


The End
