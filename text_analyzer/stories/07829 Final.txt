 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The first thing that went wrong was that he met me alone, which immediately started my mental alarm bells ringing. The flight had been long and uncomfortable; I had never learned to get any decent sleep on such long journeys and there was jet lag of course. I had been building a quite incredible well-spring of nervous excitement during the journey, both consciously and in the horrible half-sleep moments I'd managed to catch.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; I'd spent the first leg of the long flight reading through the entire printouts of our email correspondence going back since we met on the net nearly a year before. It was both exciting and frightening to read through it all again as the plane made its way over the dark ocean. After attempting sleep, and the interruption of the free dinner, I settled to some soft music and my own imaginings of what would await me upon landing in the morning.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I shrugged off the worry as an after effect of my long reading and fertile imagination as I hefted my only bag and rushed to meet him. We recognised each other from many shared photographs, but he was bigger than I had anticipated. He smiled as I approached. The airport was busy, and the indecipherable drone of announcements filled my ears. People bustled past as I made my way towards him.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We shook hands, and I tried to make my grip firm. He was taller than me, and towered a little - surely a physical effect of our dynamic, for I had come to be his slave, had I not?
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"It's so nice to finally meet you," he said, and his accent struck me for the first time. Voice was something we hadn't often done.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes, you too," I tried to manage a smile, but nervousness and excitement had turned me into a toy of my emotional state. I returned my hand to my pocket so he wouldn't feel how I was trembling.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was wearing much the same as me, jeans and a shirt. He was unshaven now, and his familiar dark eyes looked ever so more intense in real life. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You look tired, we should grab a drink before we start the next leg," he said tentatively, but motioning with his arm for us to move towards the nearby food plaza. He was all smiles, and I allowed myself to relax with my surety of my knowledge of him, and the way we had long-since connected and got so familiar. He led me to a table at the edge of an open coffee shop, just out of the bustle of arriving passengers and the clamor of happy greetings. I dropped my bag, and slumped in the soft seat, unable to care to hide my sudden exhaustion at nearly two days without sleep.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You look quite pale, are you okay?" Concern was evident, and I smiled for him. He quickly ordered two coffees with some faux-Italian name I didn't know.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes, just nervous exhaustion and .. exhaustion," my tone made him laugh, and I felt a little proud. It had not been lost on me how lucky I was to have found this couple, and the gratitude I felt to them for the pleasure we had already shared was very real. Couple. Alarm bells. I took advantage of the mood and asked: "So, where is Sarah?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He looked me in the eye, "she got all excited at the last minute about meeting you at home rather than in a public place, you know how she is. Preparing and all that."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It had been Sarah who I had first met, in the fateful profile chat interchange that had eventually, inexorably led to this. Sweet Sarah who could indeed be spontaneous and surprising. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A waitress arrived with our coffee, and after sipping his and sweetening it, John, my new owner, said: "I understand you're tired, but I'd really like to get started immediately so we can get you rested later." He smiled kindly, with genuine concern in his eyes.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The phrase 'get you rested' sent a lightning bolt from my brain to my cock and it sprang alive fully like it was indeed made of electricity. Pure white-hot sexual excitement engulfed my prior nervousness, blanketing it save for the best parts. I shifted in the chair, sighed silently with the power of it, lowered my eyes and clutched the coffee cup for support as I fought to control the depth of the brilliantly intense fire of arousal that this situation had finally awoken. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He laughed, fully aware of what was occurring for me, "take deep breaths."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Two pale yellow pills were on the towel next to my coffee, and he fished in the duty free bag he had been carrying (but I hadn't noticed) and now dropped something else next to them. The rumble inside me continued, and I did need to breathe slowly in order to keep myself under control. My exhaustion added a surreal edge to everything, giving it a near-dream quality. I remembered to savor the experience.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I had a nightmare finding out about bringing things like this into airports, silly paranoid me. When you go to the restroom, I want you to take both pills, and apply this device around the base of your genitals. It's very expensive, so don't lose it," he said, he was a little cautious, but now he looked me in the eye, "and don't run away with it."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was a big, thick, dull grey metal ring, which looked just about right to fit around the base of my genitals. He reached over and twisted it, it fell into two halves in front of me. He showed no concern about the many people around, they would have little idea what sick depraved uses it had. Neither, in fact, did I. The tidal force of my arousal rippled through me again.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Be careful not to trap the skin. The next time it closes, it will stay closed. Do you understand?" His voice has taken on more authority now, and I felt myself crumbling to obedience.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I looked up at him and smiled again, took a deep breath and then leaned back in my seat. I was a little high from the feelings in me, and needed to relax.
"I understand." I picked up the two halves of the device and put them in separate pockets. My whole body was shaking like I'd been plugged into something. I drank my coffe.The metal jingled with the suddenly foreign coins in my pocket.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The shorter, second half of my journey had been into the rising sun, and the pastel of the light as it dusted the inside of the cabin - and thus my eyelids through the cheap sleeping mask - had kept me from any kind of real sleep, and rather fuelled my dreamy fantasies of what was to come. I dreamt of hot deserts and glaring landscapes with millions of chained slaves worked naturally in this alternative world. I saw glittering waterfalls, scandent with the sun, hanging with slaves as decoration and a flavour for the architecture. I smelt the fertile wisps of nature as I was led through it, naked and barefoot, in my dreams.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;These images came back to me as I sat alone in the cubicle, literally holding my future in my hands, examining the device I was to wear for him. I saw now that it has numerous small semicircle attachments points around the edge, and there were cracks in the surface of unknown function. The glow of arousal in my body had not subsided, but now it was tempered and enhanced with the fear of these many unknowns I was facing. The pills I had taken already, with the last of the strong coffee, but I was not afraid of them, as they did not represent anything final. This device was final. I savored again the frequency of this strident feeling as I dropped my trousers.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It beeped when I clumsily fitted the two sections together, and it became very snug against my skin. I had given him these dimensions of my body long ago, with many others even more obscure. The width of it pushed my balls up and out from my body, stretching the skin slightly, and it trapped my semi-erect penis tightly against them. It was heavy too, and swayed with every movement I made.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A second beep and the device tightened suddenly. Discomfort and finality hit me, causing me dick to burst awake again. The steel ring was uncomfortably tight around my genitals, trapping my erection and causing it to stand out directly in front of me. The desperation turned to panic as I realised that I couldn't take it off, and that it would force my erection. I leaned against the inside of the door, again trying to breathe calmly, jeans and underwear pooled around my feet, heavy steel hanging above them. It rocked with each breath, and my dick prodded mindlessly, out of my control.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I fought my clamoring emotions, and pulled up my clothes. I felt light-headed, and was struggling to breathe calmly. My erection was obvious like a spike in front of jeans, and I had to force it down with both hands held in pockets before I could exit the restroom, and trudge carefully back to him, unable to ignore the swinging weight in my underpants. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It beeped again as I approached him, walking like an alcohol victim with hands thrust in my pockets to hold it all down. My balls ached, stretched painfully in the ring. My cock ached, rubbing against cloth, trapped by hand and steel.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He grinned and stood up as he saw me coming, picked up our bags and dropped a note on the table for the bill. It occurred to me that I had no local money, then, but I guessed that was the least of my worries. He put one arm around my shoulders and directed me out of the food plaza area and towards the exits. I was easy to guide without the benefit of my arms, and with this big, uncomfortable thing wrapped around my most private area. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"It's three hours to our place, your new home," he said, glancing down at me as he led me out of the airport and into the car park. The sun was bright, and the mid-morning warm. I struggled along with him, anxious to reach some kind of safety where I could free my hands and hide my state. I smiled weakly, but couldn't get my thoughts together enough to speak. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Another beep made me start, but it was only his car as we arrived. He opened the door for me and I got in quickly, my erection prodding at my jeans as I sat in the big vehicle and removed my hands from my pockets. Within a few seconds he had slung my bag in the back and we were driving out of the airport. The silence made me uncomfortable as he concentrated on negotiating the road system but I still couldn't express myself. The sun glinted through the windshield of the car, an oversize SUV.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He fished in his pocket as we reached the freeway, the scenery starting to have a hypnotic effect on my tired mind. I realised the pills were making me sleepy. He showed me a small silver device, matching colour and design with the ring around my balls, but smaller. They ached when I thought about them. I blinked at the object as he held in front of my face.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"This is the remote. Isn't technology great?" he glanced at me and I saw then the first hint of the demon inside, disguised for now as a child with a new toy, but in hindsight, yes that was the first time, and my second alarm bell of the morning. "Are you feeling sleepy yet?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I nodded. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well this should wake you up," the shock was like a red hot knife had cut off my genitals. I screamed. I bucked in my seat and gagged, dizziness rippling through me after the agonising pain, and the world swam. I gagged, barely managing to keep the stale coffee down.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh god," I groaned, my breath rasping.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Master will do. It's set to be continuous if you move more than a few yards away from the remote, and the batteries last for weeks. So stay close, baby," there was real glee in his face as he looked down at me with my head between my legs trying to stifle the urge to puke. "It can't be removed," he looked back at the road, continuing to speak, confident, ha ha, that he had my attention. "Any serious attempt to tamper with the device will result in severely damaging self-destruction. Horrible."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I looked at the plush floor of the vehicle between my feet. The car sped along.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Final enough for you?"
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes, Master."
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Good boy."
