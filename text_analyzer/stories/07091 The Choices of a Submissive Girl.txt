The Choices of a Submissive Girl

by Lewis Chappelle 
(with the able plot line assistance of Lady Marissa, a dear friend) 

The girl was eighteen years old but, was still very naive. She had not yet experienced how cruel the world could be. That is not to say that she had lived a sheltered life because she had learned the pain of rejection at a very young age. Her mother had never wanted to give birth to her, and had never cared to hide that fact. 

She was also well aware of what it took to make her juices flow. She fantasized about being dominated, being completely controlled by a man, and reveled in the freedom it would allow her. She needed to find a dominant man, that was willing and able to fulfill her desire of being a submissive cum slut. 

She had never told anyone of her fantasies; they were improper and, she was a Preacher&#8217;s daughter. However, when she was alone in bed at night she would fantasize about being humiliated and whipped, and she would twist and pinch her nipples as she finger fucked her cunt until she had cum after cum.

She was multi-orgasmic. She didn&#8217;t care if some in the church might think it was against God or not. She enjoyed masturbating and making herself cum until she passed out from pleasure. She also enjoyed frustrating herself by bringing herself to the edge of orgasm and stopping abruptly. 

Despite her vivid fantasies, she had never really known love. She wanted someone to sweep her off her feet, and whip her, but she was still wearing the rose colored glasses of an adolescent. She had never been in a relationship, and didn&#8217;t know what to look for in a&nbsp; partner. She didn&#8217;t know how to tell the difference between a man with dominant tendencies, in contrast to one with abusive qualities. 

Until she went off to college, her father had forbidden her to date at all. Furthermore, she had not had time to devote to a relationship. 

She was a dancer and devoted all of her time and energy to that. She had wanted to be a dancer all her life. No one other than her ballet instructor ever supported her in her endeavor. She had a petite, lithe, body, barely one hundred pounds of tight sinew and muscle. 

She also devoted herself to her academics. She was aware of the importance of being goal driven. However, she was not at Harvard because it was where she truly wanted to be, rather she was there because it was an "appropriate school for a women of her status." She had made the mistake of listening to her family and ignored her own dreams. 

She deeply regretted her decision to go to Harvard. There, she was surrounded by rich brats with whom she did not relate. Sure, her family had money, and plenty of it, but she wasn&#8217;t attracted to the spoiled rich boys. She had seen what most marriages were like between rich couples and she didn&#8217;t want that. Also, she wanted someone to love her for who she was; it did not occur to her that no one would ever be able to look past the fact that she was indeed one very rich, young, woman.

No one in her life understood her desire to be a totally unique person. No one understood her deep love and interest in the various art forms. Everyone thought that her dreams of becoming a famous dancer were foolishness. Even her dear brother did not understand her love of the arts. He never discouraged her as others did, but at the same time he did not encourage her when she most needed his support.

In an attempt to prove everyone wrong, she had applied to The Juilliard School and she had been accepted. But, she let her dream die and went off to Harvard under the pretense of going to medical school there and becoming a doctor in the footsteps of her mother. Once enrolled, however, in a rebellious act, she changed her major from pre-med to architecture. It was not a completely random change. She had the natural artistic ability but, more than anything, she wanted to do something of her own. Her father was enraged by her decision. 
 
She reveled in the thought that she had finally done it; she had broken free from the hold her family held over her! For once she was doing something for herself, and she just knew it would lead her in a positive direction. She never imagined where her life choice would soon lead her.
 
As she walked through the Harvard bookstore in her freshman year, her nipples were still sensitive as a result of the attention she had given them in moments of self gratification the night before. She desperately wanted to tear off her blouse and pull on her nipples right then and there. Her cunt was dripped just from the thought.
 
It was there, in the book store, where she met him. She was instantly attracted to him. 
He was hot! He had a rugged handsomeness about him that made her wet, and there was a swagger in his walk, that spoke volumes about his personality. She could tell right away that he was the type of man that could fulfill her deepest fantasies. 

As a matter of fact, he had seen her from the first day she arrived on campus and had made a rather comprehensive study of her habits and activities. She didn&#8217;t know it at the time, but she was very wrong in her first impressions about him. She had mistaken his self assured and self confident air as a signal of a solid man with a good heart who could bring her the satisfaction she so desperately craved. 

He could tell she was wealthy and he knew right away that he had to have this girl. He sensed her frailty, - her vulnerability. He could tell that she would be easy to manipulate. He was good at detecting the weaknesses in others and using them to his advantage. He was certainly a wonderful con-artist, and he knew that this poor, young, innocent girl would be a very easy target. He could tell&nbsp; she was attracted to him, and he couldn&#8217;t deny that she was gorgeous. Perhaps anyone else would have appreciated that beauty. 

To him she was small and susceptible. He could tell she was lonely. He figured, and correctly so, that it was her first time away from home. She felt a million miles away from everyone and, everything she knew. She was looking for companionship, but he sensed something more. He sensed that given the right circumstances, she could have a very dependant personality, but he knew that first he would have to woo her into a sense of security. He could tell she had a natural defenses which he would have to wiggle his way through. He knew that once he was in, she was his, forever and for always, whether she knew it or not. 

The girl had always been socially independent, but he planned on changing that. He wanted to show her that she needed him, and couldn&#8217;t live without him. He figured she had always known she was surrounded by people who would protect her, and that she would find comfort in seeing him as her protector, her savior. He wanted to make her believe that she was not safe without him and could not function without him. It was his ultimate desire to have complete control over this young beauty. 

He didn&#8217;t know it, but her thoughts were much on the same line as his. She couldn&#8217;t help but think that despite the fact that she had not been raised in an environment surrounded by love, she had always known that she was safe and secure. She now no longer had that safety blanket, and she was feeling very exposed. 

She knew he had been watching her, and it made her very uncomfortable, but in a sense she was flattered. For the first time she thought&nbsp; someone was looking at her as a woman. She had no idea how wrong she was. He didn&#8217;t see her as a woman, he saw her as a prize, proof that he was the best at his game. 

He also saw what she didn&#8217;t see in herself - her naivety. He figured he could have her wrapped around his little finger in no time. When he walked up to her, she watched his every movement, and still jumped when he spoke to her. 

He said, "Hello there. My name is Michael, what&#8217;s yours?" He was very kind about it. He did not want to scare her off. He could tell she was thinking about running off, but she was rooted to the spot. 

Finally, she found her footing and went to walk away from him. He grabbed her arm just hard enough to keep her from going anywhere. She was slightly afraid, but made no effort to get away because she didn&#8217;t want him to hurt her. That should have been a warning signal to her before she ever got involved with him. Her choice was driven by her need for affection, and her subconscious desire to be dominated. 

Truth be told she was very aroused when he grabbed her arm and that emotion kept her from walking away. Her nipples got hard and her juices began to flow again. She turned toward him hoping he would let go of her, which was not to be.&nbsp; 

She quietly responded, �My name is Kristin. What do you want from me? I have money, if that is what you want." 

He laughed because he did not want her money, not yet anyway. 

"I just want a chance to get to know you Kristin. You look like the type of young woman that I am attracted to. You are very pretty, and you must be smart as well," he said wanting to flatter her. She blushed at his comment and fell right into his trap. "I&#8217;d really like to get to know you Kristin. Will you allow me that honor? Will you let me show you how a beautiful woman should be treated?" he added.
 
The girl was already falling for him. "Okay!" was all she managed to choke out. 

He was twenty eight and seemed strong and self willed. He seemed to actually care for her like no other man ever had. But, in all actuality he could not have cared less. He didn&#8217;t care about her family, her fears, her dreams, or her aspirations; all he cared about was getting her to do everything he wanted her to do without question or complaint. In fact, there were many things about her that he did not like, and he would demand that she change these things in order to please him. 

She thought she had found the love and affection for which she had been seeking. She quickly fell head over heels in love with him, just like he wanted her to. At this point, she had no idea how manipulative he was. She did not have the slightest idea that this �perfect man� would soon bring her nothing but pain and heartache. 

She never thought twice about his intentions, and was quick to do anything and everything he asked of her without question. She never once considered that he wanted anything more than to spend time with her, and to be her boyfriend. She didn&#8217;t consider the fact that he was ten years older than her. Nor, did she ever take into account that she paid the bill every time they went out. She was completely wrapped up in the attention he showered on her. He "took" her to the nicest places and "bought" her the nicest things. It seemed to her that they had the "perfect relationship." She quickly learned how wrong she was. 

Soon after that had started to date, he proposed that they marry. She was ecstatic. However, she was stunned when he told her that once they were wed he would expect her to drop out of school and tend to the house, and her other duties as his wife. But she took it all in stride and accepted his conditions.

She took him home to meet her family, and they all fell in love with him, except her favorite brother. She made a huge mistake at that time that she has regretted immensely. She said to him, �You just don&#8217;t want me to be happy, Richard. You are a selfish ass." 

In all reality, after spending an hour with him, her brother saw Michael for the man he really was. He saw what she refused to see at that time. Her brother saw how manipulative this man, that she loved, actually was. He saw the flaws in the �perfect man� and he also saw how dependant she was becoming on him. He knew this man was going to break her, not just her heart, but her spirit as well. 

She did not tell her family that once she was wed she would drop out of Harvard, she knew they would be disappointed.
 
Her father was more than happy to foot the bill for the wedding. She assumed that she would get to be involved in the planning of her own wedding, but that was not to be. 
As with most things, Michael took control. He often treated her like a child, incapable of doing things on her own. He told her that since she was still in school and needed to focus on her grades that his mother would be more than happy to take care of the planning of the wedding. At the time she did not consider this strange, but in later years she realize that this was simply his way of taking control. 

She promptly learned that she would have no say in anything regarding the wedding. She was not even allowed to pick her Maid of Honor and bridesmaids. She honestly felt like a guest at her own wedding, which is the way he wanted her to feel. He did not want her to be comfortable at their wedding. He wanted her to know that it was out of her control. He wanted to leave no doubt in her mind that he was in complete control, and that things would be done as he wanted them to be done. 

As the date of the wedding got closer, he became more and more controlling. He wanted to know where she was every second of the day. He wanted to know why she was where she was, and with whom she was spending time. At times she felt like a prisoner, but she once again allowed her need for affection and control to overrule her better judgment. She gave him the impression that she needed him, and couldn&#8217;t live without him. All of this was detrimental to her own self image and she started to think less-and-less of herself. 

By the time he killed himself, she was coasting through life and not really living. She had lost all confidence in herself and her abilities. 

He was very happy that she was becoming more and more dependant on him, that is exactly how he wanted it, and he took advantage of that dependency at every turn. He forced her to do many depraved and degrading things, with the threat of leaving her if she didn&#8217;t follow his direction.
 
He did not even allow her to have a bachelorette party, rather she had her serve as the entertainment at his own bachelor party. He forced her to strip for his friends, and then serve them drinks naked. She was also forced to perform oral on all of the friends. She didn&#8217;t suspect it at the time, but this was to serve as a punishment for having refused to perform oral on him several weeks prior to the event. He told her that what she had been forced to do was punishment for what she refused to do earlier. �You won&#8217;t refuse to give me head anymore now will you, dearest?� he sneered.

On the day of the wedding she saw �her� gown for the first time. The gown was stunning, however, it was a very restrictive garment, which is exactly the way he wanted it. She had to wear a tight corset that severely restricted her waist to get the dress to fit. The dress was actually a hobble skirt. He had designed the gown himself to accentuate her figure and to remind all present that she belonged to him completely, and that he would display her in any manner he desired. 

She could hardly walk with the gown designed as it was, and the heels her Mother-in Law had selected were over 6&#8217; high. While she had worn heels before, she had never worn heels that high. Soon enough she would become proficient walking in such high heels as they would be the only shoes she was allowed to wear. She felt like the goose being prepared for the oven.

She had not wanted to have a Catholic ceremony, but. his mother had had the church picked out and had it decorated with roses. She was allergic to roses. Of course, she did not express these feelings to anyone. All who saw her that day thought that she was a radiant&nbsp; and ecstatic bride, but on the inside she was seething, as she minced down the aisle on her father&#8217;s arm. 

Her father on the other hand was a very happy man. He thought&nbsp; she had found the perfect man in him and he never changed his mind on that even though it was definitely not true. Like most people, her father was conned by his charm. To the outside world, their marriage would appear perfect, but she alone knew the hell he would put her through. 

When it came time for her to say "I do" she had trouble. All she wanted to do was say "I don&#8217;t," and run from the church. He sensed her turmoil at the alter, and reached out and took her hand and squeezed it tightly and leaned over and whispered �If you don&#8217;t stop stalling you are really going to regret it later�. She quickly said �I do�. 

Her wedding should have been the happiest day of her life. Instead it was filled with angst. Her wedding would be memorable to her mostly because of the internal turmoil she experienced rather than the pure joy she should have been feeling. It would be memorable because she hated two of her bridesmaids, and she abhorred her gown. She was supposed to feel wonderful and happy on her wedding day but she didn&#8217;t. She felt annoyed and disgusted. She hated everything about the wedding.

And, her day of agony did not end there, it only got worse. At the reception things started out normally enough. Of course, as the bride and groom, they were the center of attention and everyone wanted at least a moment with them. As they were circulating through the room they were stopped by a gentleman she did not know. He must have been a friend of the grooms family. The guy asked if they planned on having children in the near future. She had always wanted to be a mother so she said, "Yes, of course." At the same time, her new husband said, "No, not anytime soon." She looked at him in amazement. She had thought that they would start a family right away. She couldn&#8217;t believe he didn&#8217;t want children. She realized then and there that she really did not know all that much about her new partner. 

He looked at the man and said, "You will have to forgive her. She has yet to learn her proper place." The man simply smiled and walked off. 

He grabbed her arm and said in a nasty tone, "You are never to disagree with anything I say, ever. You are never to cross me, and if you do , I swear you will regret it." 
He then slapped her across the face and stormed off. Quite a few people saw the altercation, but not one of them went to comfort the newly wed. 

The one person she did not want to see the exchange did see it, and came running&nbsp; to her. "Kristin, you can&#8217;t put up with that. If you never listen to me on anything else, listen to me on this, Honey. It will never get any better. If he will hit you at your wedding in front of a whole room full of guests what do you think is going to happen when you are behind closed doors?" She heard it first from her dear brother. 

In her heart she knew he was right. She knew that the abuse would not stop there, but she could not force herself to act on that knowledge. She could not convince herself that she would be better off without him. She thought that his companionship would make her happy. She was shocked that he had hit her, but she disregarded it and told herself he was just stressed over the wedding. She learned over time that she could only come up with so many excuses for his ill-considered and irrational behavior. 

That evening she found out just how right her brother, Richard, had been. She was a virgin when she married. Her father was a preacher and she had never come close to having premarital sex. She had fantasized that he would be gentle with her and make sure that they both got pleasure on their wedding night. 

Once again she was wrong. He took her virginity forcefully. He took her like one would fuck a whore. He didn&#8217;t care about whether she got any pleasure or not. He didn&#8217;t care whether or not he was hurting her. He laughed at her pain. It aroused him further. Her husband was a true sadist in every sense of the word. He enjoyed seeing her in pain. It gave him pleasure to hurt her. 

He called her names that night, some of which she had never heard before. She couldn&#8217;t believe he would call her such things. She did not deserve it. 

Even though he ripped through her maidenhood, he claimed she was not a virgin, saying that she did previously have sex and had cheated on him. She was never once been unfaithful to him. 

Two weeks into their marriage she made a careless comment about a guy in one of her classes. He acted as though she had fallen in love with the man and was going to leave him. That was the first time she felt the kiss of his belt on her skin. Physically the pain was unbearable, but the emotional scars that is created were a thousand times worse. 

She did drop out of Harvard after her first semester and, for two years tried hard to please him. She walked on egg shells around him. No matter what she did she could not make him happy. She tried everything. He expected her to change everything about herself in order to please him. Nothing about her made him happy. She did not understand the change in him. Before their wedding he had been so kind and nice, he had never once struck her while they were dating. 

At times she feared for her very life. Michael was a violent man. He would go from being a charming man to a sadistic one without warning. She never knew whether he was going to hug her or strike her. She lived in constant fear. 

She did not yet realize how manipulative the man she loved was, and yet she loved him with all her heart. It felt as though he tore her spirit to shreds every day. 

She tried to give him her love and her heart, but time-and-time again it was rejected. The emotional pain he caused her was a million times worse than any physical pain she had ever known. Her happiness and well being meant nothing to him. As long as she paid the bills, and did everything he required of her he was as happy as he ever was. He always found something wrong with her. She always felt that she fell short of meeting his expectations. 

He enjoyed torturing her. He enjoyed beating her, and raping her. He enjoyed degrading her, and making her do shameful things. Of course anything that she didn&#8217;t like doing instantly became his favorite thing. 

In his view she was his property and he could do as he liked with her.

In her opinion he treated his property better than he treated her. He caused her pain beyond compare. 

She stayed true to her vows. She honored and obeyed him until the bitter end. She was there for him for richer and for poorer, in health and his final sickness. She saw him die a gruesome, and very premature, death. 

This might not be a great love story, but this is� The End
