Blond Honey
in a Brown Bowl

By

&nbsp;

In the mid-seventies I was working
full time and attending college in Western New York.� I worked for an upholstery shop that
specialized in repairing or recovering car seats. I lived in a small efficiency
apartment above the shop, rent-free. The weekends were the only break I got
from work and study to party.� At that
time in my life, 19 years old, the only thing I had on my mind was girls, sex
and drinking.

&nbsp;

My boss allowed me to take the
company's Ford van on Saturday nights after work when my old car was broke
down. This was the case more times then not.�
The back of the van was always full of tools and materials for
upholstery work. There was one bench seat for the driver and occasional
passenger. It was no love van, but it was better then walking. I always drove a
distance out of town to pick up girls because all I wanted was a one-night
stand and I was honest about it. I was also a little wild and impulsive in
those days.� One particular Saturday
night I will never forget. The boss went up to the 1000 Islands to stay at his
cottage in Clayton. He invited some of his friends to join him for a weekend of
fishing; he was staying for a full week. I was in charge until he got back. I
had a week's wages in my pocket. I went bar hopping trying to pick up girls. I
decided to try a bar that I never stopped at before called the Gun Smoke; a
Country Western Bar that had live bands on Saturday nights It was located about
50 miles from home.� I wasn't a big fan
of Country Music but there were bound to be girls there. I parked the van in
the far corner of a near empty parking lot. When I walked in the jute box was
playing.

&nbsp;

I walked up to the bar and ordered
a rum and coke. I asked the bartender were the band was? I was told that the
band that was scheduled to play that night stiffed him.� I turned to look the place over and see who
was in there. There were mostly middle age married couples sitting in groups, a
few couples were dancing.

I didn't recognize anybody
there.� While I was sitting at the bar, a
women came out of the ladies room and sat down next to me leaving an empty bar
stool between us. She looked to be in her thirties and was dressed in tight
Jordache jeans, a white low cut silk blouse and tooled red leather western
boots.� She saw that I was watching her
and slid over to sit next to me. She held out her hand and introduced herself
telling me her name was Becky. I took her hand and told her my name was Tom. I
noticed that she was not wearing a wedding ring and that was a good sign and
peaked my interest. 

&nbsp;

Looking her over closer a second
time I saw she had blue eyes accented with makeup done to perfection. Becky's
natural honey blond hair was pulled back in a long ponytail and decorated with
a red ribbon.� Becky was a good-looking
woman that knew how to dress and attract men. I realized she was at least 12 or
more years older then I was but that didn't matter; she was interested and so
was I.

&nbsp;

We spent a lot of time that night
dancing.� Becky liked the slow dances best.
While we danced, Becky started teasing me by rubbing her ponytail on the side
of my face and neck. I responded by pulling in closer and licking and kissing
her behind her ears. While we danced, I gently ran my hands all over her,
paying special attention to her firm ass. Becky kept feeding the jute box with
my money and I bought all her drinks. I was afraid of running out of money.
Between dances we sat and made small talk at a corner table.� While we talked, I noticed that Becky liked
to play with her long hair. I moved my chair closer to her and started stroking
her long blond ponytail telling her how beautiful I thought her hair
looked.� Becky told me I was a sweet boy
and I was wasting my time with girls my age.�
She was going to show me what a being woman was all about.� 

&nbsp;

We stayed until closing and were
the last to leave the bar.� We left the
Gun Smoke with my arm around her trim waist because Becky was a little
tipsy.�� I drank plain cokes after she
started rubbing my face with her ponytail. I had to have her. I wanted to be
sharp and alert in order to be able to seduce her; I never had a woman her age
before and couldn't chance mistakes. Becky led me to her car and promised to
give me head, and that was just a warm-up for things to come. 

&nbsp;

�Becky's car was a loaded 1976 mint green
Lincoln Continental that included a custom stereo system. We put the front
bench seat all the way back, and then Becky was all over me. When she went down
on me, I wrapped my hand around that thick blond ponytail. This excited her so
I used her ponytail liked a horse's rein to slow her down so the blowjob would
last longer. After I came, Becky sat up but looked a little flushed. I asked if
she was all right. Before she could answer me, she turned around and vomited
all over the floor behind the seat.

&nbsp;

I told her not to worry about it. I
had some rags and dry cleaning solution in my truck.� When I got back, Becky was passed out behind
the steering wheel with the engine idling.�
I noticed the glove compartment was open and there were papers and
jewelry on the seat and floor. I got in on the passenger side and closed the
door. I reached over and shut the engine off and turned on the dome light.
Besides expensive gold rings set with large precious and semi-precious stones,
there were 2 heavy gold bracelets. Also included in the loose jewelry was a
gold wedding band and engagement ring with at least a two-carat diamond. The
dropped paperwork included the insurance card, registration, and her husband's
business cards. The insurance card and registration indicated the car was
registered to her husband's business: Jim Banner Ford. My shop does
business with Jim Banner and the boss and he are good friends. They were up at
the 1000 Islands fishing while Chastity was picking up young men at bars.
Picking up married women wasn't my style. If I had known she was married I
would have left her alone. I'm sure you can guess the name on her driver's
license was not Becky, but Chastity, Chastity Banner. The irony of her given
name was not lost on me at the time.

&nbsp;

I went back to the van and brought
back a large pair of upholstery shears and several of stainless steel bowls
used for mixing fabric dyes. When I returned a second time, I shook her, but
other then moaning a bit, she was out of it. I sat her up, untied her ribbon,
and repositioned the elastic band holding her ponytail in place until it was by
the nape of her neck at the hairline.

I cut off her long blond ponytail
just above the elastic band. Chastity's now much shorter hair spilled loose,
half way down her neck.� Her shorn
ponytail was about 20 inches long. Setting her ponytail aside, I arranged her
hair in the front so that it fell forward over her face. 

&nbsp;

I tried the stainless steel bowls
on her head until I found one that fit just above her ears. Pushing the bowl
down firmly, I cut off all the hair sticking out the rim of the bowl, stuffing
the cut off blond hair into the glove compartment. I removed the bowl from her
head, and tousled her hair to shake out the remaining cut pieces, then smoothed
it down. Chastity smiled and giggled, snuggling up to me, but still half asleep
and pretty much out of it. 

&nbsp;

I pushed her back up to a sitting
position to admire my work, noticing the silly smile still on her face.
Chastity didn't have a clue what was happening to her or what else was going to
happen.

Chastity's best feature was her
beautiful long honey blond hair. It was obviously her pride and joy and well
cared for. She loved touching it and having it touched. She used it to attract
and entice and arouse. It enhanced her sexual appeal and fed her ego. What
remained off her once luxurious tresses was a short, rough-cut bowl of hair on
her head just touching her ears. I took a section of her hair and tied the
ribbon tightly in place. It look silly and out of place.

&nbsp;

�I took all of her jewelry, minus her wedding
band; which I put in my pocket, her purse and all the papers including
registration and insurance and locked them in the trunk. I went back and took
the boots off her feet and locked them in the trunk for good measure. I took
her car keys, house keys and drivers license, adding them to the wedding band
already in my pocket. On the way home, I stopped a payphone and called her
husband's Ford dealership knowing they had a 24-hour towing service.

&nbsp;

The following Monday, I anonymously
mailed Chastity's shorn ponytail to the dealership, addressed to Jim Banner.� Included in that large manila envelope with
the ponytail were the house keys, car keys, Chastity's driver's license and
wedding band.

&nbsp;

I found out later through the
grapevine, my boss that the tow truck driver made a phone call to Jim at the
boss's cottage. Chastity was made to wait at the dealership until her husband
arrived at the dealership to bring her home personally. What a sight she must
have been when her husband first saw his faithless wife, shorn of her tresses
and shoeless.� When things were sorted
out and the pieces came together, Jim threw her out. They eventually
reconciled, Jim took Chastity back on his terms and with conditions. I know he
made her work at the dealership where he could keep an eye on her and strictly
monitored her comings and goings. 

&nbsp;

I met her by chance in the grocery
store nine months after her husband took her back.� I stopped to buy a pound of coffee for an all
night study session. I was waiting in line at the only checkout open when
Chastity walked up behind me to get in line. I turned to see who was behind me,
and there she was. She had on a long blue dress with a white Peter Pan collar
and sensible shoes. Chastity's face was devoid of makeup and her only jewelry
was her wedding band.

&nbsp;

Chastity's hair was no longer a
beautiful honey blond, it was now dyed plain brown. It was styled in a precise
bowl shape that curled under at the bottom and just touching her ears. The
remaining hair was cut short to accent the top. Talk about conditions?

Realizing I was staring at her, I
smiled, nodded hello. Chastity smiled back and I leisurely turned back around.
If she recognized me she didn't show it. Looking back, I would best describe
her demeanor as resigned and subdued.

&nbsp;

I waited in my car in the parking
lot for her to come out.

I watched her as she walked to her
car and opened the trunk.� As she was
loading the groceries, I thought she looked somewhat plain and dowdy, a far cry
from the sexy confident blond I met in a bar. Chastity closed the trunk and got
in her red Ford Pinto. As she drove past, I could see large white letters
painted on the sides of her Pinto that said: Jim Banner Ford.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

My name is Jim. My dear wife
Chastity and I have shared our married lives together these past 35 years.� I was 27 when we married; Chastity was
25.� I sold my Ford Dealership. Chastity
and I can now devote our full time to restoring the Historical Brick house we
bought together on the St. Lawrence River. As I am writing our story down, my
Chastity is upstairs washing her hair.� 

&nbsp;

It has faded over the years from
gold to silver. Yet, it is still thick and soft, flowing like captured
moonlight radiating from her head to her slim waist. I met Chastity when we
were attending high school. I always dated girls with long hair; then I met
Chastity; I thought she was very pretty at 13 with her blue eyes and honey
blond hair. Chastity had a short pixie cut when I first saw her; and she told
me she hated it.

She complained,&quot; My mother,
thinks I look cute in a pixie, I think I look like a baby.&quot; &quot;She says
liberated women should be above such things. Short hair is so much more
convenient; mother knows what's best, Chastity&quot;.� 

I told her she was both cute and
beautiful. Knowing my preference for long hair, Chastity defied her mother and
grew her hair long for me. Chastity's mother thought I was a bad influence; her
father liked me.

&nbsp;

Many married women Chastity's age
cut their hair short for convenience, never considering their husband's wishes
in the matter; how selfish.

I am a very lucky man. Chastity has
maintained her trim figure over the years, and has beautiful wrinkle free
skin.� She always wears nice wide brim
hats when she it outside in the sun. Thank God, I stopped her from going to
those tanning salons years ago.� Many of
her old friends that continued to frequent tanning booths now look like
wrinkled prunes with over processed short hair and bad haircuts; the rest, just
prunes.

&nbsp;

I am not exaggerating by saying
that aside from her silver hair; Chastity could pass for a woman in her
forties. I love the silver now as well as I loved the gold. We are going out
for a light dinner this evening, then dancing. My wife loves dancing. We enjoy
the slow dances best. Chastity has a walk- in -closet full of beautiful form
fitting dresses. 

Long, dresses and medium only; her
lacey 

bras with matching bodice and
frilly silk panties hidden from view.� I
won't know what color she will choose until much later at bedtime. Those are
for her husband's eyes only. 

&nbsp;

Chastity will put her hair up in a
bun. I suggested a Celtic Bun; she will graciously comply. Chastity is very
skilled in pinning up her hair, she is an expert in dozens of variation;
including styles for the bedroom only, the results will be perfect as always;
my sister taught her well.

&nbsp;

We will return late from dancing,
retiring to our large spacious bedroom. I will completely undress and sit on
the edge of our massive carved mahogany poster bed. Chastity will stand with
her back to me and slowly remove her dress letting it slide down her graceful
figure to the floor at her feet, revealing her under garments for my pleasure. 

&nbsp;

Chastity will step out of her
dress, and with her back to me, walk to her antique cherry vanity table and sit
at the matching bench. Taking her time, making me wait, she will apply her
make-up in her mirror; it will be expertly applied and tasteful. I hope she
chooses the red lipstick this evening. When she is satisfied with the results,
she will remove all the pins securing her large bun shaking her ponytail loose.


&nbsp;

Chastity will return to the bed
where I am waiting and face me. She will first slip out of the bodice, posing
seductively, then reach behind and unhook the clasp on her bra, remove it and
drop it carelessly to the floor exposing her luscious breasts, the nipples
erect and proud, free of confinement. I will forbid her from removing her
panties, garter belt and silk stockings this evening: she will know why and
must wait. Like a good wife, Chastity will go down on me, it is unspoken: her
intact panties the implied order. 

&nbsp;

Excited she will be licking and
sucking. As always I will play with her long silver ponytail; assessing it's
weight and thickness; assessing the silky, soft texture. Interrupting her
progress, I will surprise her by removing the elastic tie, letting her hair
loose and free: another sign that her panties might be coming off soon. 

&nbsp;

Chastity will throw her head
forward spilling her hair over my chest and stomach to heighten my pleasure and
resume with renewed vigor in the hopes that I will remove her panties and
expose her smooth bald pussy to my welcome fingers and erect manhood. I will
bury my hands in it in celebration of her redemption.

&nbsp;

When I had taken my pleasure, I
will direct her to go to her vanity drawer to select a spool of colorful ribbon
and a pair of scissors for her sleep time braid. Chastity will dutifully comply
returning with her brush, the scissors and the colored spool of ribbon, choosing
the color.

&nbsp;

I will brush her beautiful long
silver hair until it shines in the soft lighting of the bedroom. I will braid
her hair in a low loose braid to keep me from accidentally lying on her hair
while she is sleeping. After the braid is complete, I will tie the ribbon,
spool and all to the bottom of her braid.�


&nbsp;

Taking up the closed scissors, I
will caress the entire length of her braid, from her nape ending at the ribbon
with the cold heartless steel, it's harsh kiss and deadly bite to which Chastity
is so familiar; the implied threat insuring her continued compliance and
submission; only then will I cut the ribbon from the spool. 

&nbsp;

I will direct her to remove her
stocking and garter belt; the silk panties will remain. We will turn off the
lights and cuddle before we fall asleep. Before I fall asleep, I will silently
lament the first 5 years of our marriage and the unreasonable time I spent at
work: the time I should have been home with my wife.� 

&nbsp;

In the morning, I will awake to her
kisses. I will remove her panties and stroke her smooth bare pussy. She will
push my head down between her legs. I will return her favor with my tongue. I
will bring her to orgasm with my tongue or manhood at her whim. 

&nbsp;

If she removes the ribbon from her
braid she will want intercourse and foreplay. If not, I will gladly continue
licking and probing her flower with my tongue anticipating her intense multiple
orgasms, my pleasure and duty as a good husband.

Chastity is a good wife and great
lover. She knows her place as I do mine. That was not always the case. In 1976,
five years into our marriage, Chastity strayed. This is our story:

&nbsp;

It was a Sunday morning at
approximately 4:00 AM. I was at my friend Don's fishing cottage in Clayton, NY
in the 1000 Islands with some buddies. I received an emergency phone call from
my sister Susan.� Susan advised me that
she received a telephone call from one of my tow truck drivers.� From the description given from an anonymous
call he received about the make and model of the car to be towed he knew it
could be my wife's. Mark didn't have my telephone number at the cottage and
called Susan to meet him there before he towed the car. Susan told Mark to
delay leaving until she drove to my house and see if Chastity's car was in the
driveway; she would check and call him back. When Susan arrived at my house,
Chastity's car was gone and nobody was home.�


&nbsp;

Susan had the directions to the Gun
Smoke and drove there ahead of Mark and found Chastity asleep in the
Lincoln.� Susan managed to get her out of
the Lincoln and into her car without anybody seeing them; covering Chastity
with a blanket.� 

&nbsp;

Susan said on the way home she
stopped at a payphone in an all night Mobil Gas station to call Mark to get the
car. The gas station attendant mentioned she was the second person to ask for
change. Some young guy in a Ford Delivery van stopped to use the phone. 

&nbsp;

Susan said she couldn't find my
wife's car keys or purse and didn't have time to stick around and look for
them.� I asked if Chastity was hurt? Susan
assured me that Chastity was fine but was a mess.

Looking back, what occurred at my
sister's house that Sunday saved our marriage. Susan is older then me by 17
years. I was three years old when Mom died. Susan was in college and dropped
out to care for us. 

&nbsp;

Dad was retired and crippled with
arthritis by then.

Susan was the daughter dad never
wanted. But he loved her all the same. He taught her things that he wanted his
son to learn if he had one. Susan could hunt, fish and play baseball. She was
an avid Yankees fan.� She could also
fight. Dad was a semi-professional boxer when he went into the Navy during the
war.� He came out an electrician. 

&nbsp;

He taught his daughter to box.
Susan didn't like violence as a rule, but found the lessons useful. By the time
I came along, Dad was in a wheel chair. After I started school, Susan graduated
from Cosmetology School. Dad took out a loan for her and they added on to the
garage and converted it to a beauty salon. Her salon hours were flexible and
she was there for me when I got home from school. 

Dad died when I was in the third
grade. Susan raised me alone from that point on. We always had a large garden
and raised chickens for eggs and the freezer, after cleaning out the junk in
the old chicken coop. 

&nbsp;

Susan was strict but fair. I
remember getting hit by her with Dads brown garrison belt a couple of time;
that was enough. I loved my sister. Susan often told me in private that she
thought my wife Chastity was, &quot;, spoiled, disrespectful and willful&quot;
adding, &quot;Not that I dislike the girl, but�
&quot; Her mother should have taken a belt to her&quot;. 

&nbsp;

Susan was very modest and proper,
especially when she got older. Susan was Susan, not Sue or Suzy, but Susan. She
hated it that my wife called her Suzy, but what could she do, start a war over
it; instead she just ignored it. Chastity thought it was funny and did it to
irritate her. I warned Chastity,

&quot; There will come a
day...........&quot; Chastity would just smile or laugh and shrug me off. 

&nbsp;

Chastity on the other hand
commented to me that she thought my sister was, mean, unfeeling, and old
fashioned.

The truth was that my wife was
afraid of my sister, and was afraid of her even before we were married. She
really never gave Susan a chance. Susan could as tough as nails and gentle as a
lamb. Susan could find good in most people. &quot; If you were
&quot;family&quot;, her loyalty was unquestioned. My wife only saw the&quot;
nails&quot; They never were close until after Chastity's indiscretion.

&nbsp;

While we were dating, Chastity
loved to come over and play with the baby chicks. She thought the fuzzy baby
chicks were just,&quot; &quot;precious &quot; My wife always loved
animals.� When we were engaged, Susan
invited us to Sunday dinner. This meant fried chicken with buttermilk biscuits
and gravy. My sister spent the whole day cleaning the house and getting dinner
ready.� I picked Chastity up at her
apartment and brought her home.� She
immediately ran to the chicken coop to see all the baby chicks.

When she passed the back porch,
Chastity saw the bloody bucket full of guts, feathers and chicken heads. My
finance ran to my truck, her long ponytail bouncing behind her. 

�

When I got there, she was inside
crying about the poor chickens and how Suzy murdered them, sobbing,&quot; I
want to go home.&quot; I held her and soothed her stroking her long blond hair
telling her it was all right and she didn't have to eat chicken, Susan would be
happy to cook her something else; adding &quot;after all you and she will be
family soon.&quot;

&nbsp;

Susan stood on the porch and
watched the whole thing unfold; her arms were crossed and that meant
trouble.� Approximately after another
hour of trying to reason with her, I drove Chastity home.

I returned back to the house for
dinner, Susan was on sitting on the porch waiting for me. I sat down across
from her; my sister leaned forward then quietly said,&quot; I spent the whole
day cooking for her.&quot; &quot;I know she is your finance, but that is no
excuse for being rude.&quot;

&quot;It's obvious to me that her
mother didn't raise her properly, her with her liberal ideas.&quot; &quot;If
she were my daughter, I would have taken the belt to her early on.&quot; &quot;
It's not that I dislike her mind you; Her mother aside, at her age she should
know better. &quot; Take your sister's advice on this; after you are married,
Chastity is a woman that needs a firm hand. &quot;You are the man, that's your
duty as a husband. There is one more thing Jim, you will see Chastity before I
will. My name is not Suzy it's Susan, that's the name on my birth certificate.
Be sure and tell her that.

&nbsp;

That all aside, The thing that
really hurt and bothered my sister was that Chastity refused to go to her
beauty salon to get her long hair trimmed. My sister had long brown hair that
she always kept pinned up in a variety of buns. Susan could create dozens of
bun variations and changed the style of bun every other day saying,&quot; It's
good for business&quot;. Susan loved long hair on women and girls.

&nbsp;

Trimming long hair was her
specialty. I would hazard to guess at least 90% of her clients had long hair.
They swore by her. As in everything she did, Susan was a perfectionist.

She was in great demand in the
spring and summer for weddings and graduations.�
As a matter of fact, she had several clients that drove 50 miles or more
just to get a trim from her.

&nbsp;

Let me be go back to the point of
the story where my sister found my wife: When I arrived, Susan met me in the
driveway. When I got of the car we hugged and I kissed her cheek.
&quot;Jim&quot;, she said,&quot; your wife had an indiscretion.&quot;� 

&nbsp;

All kinds of scenarios went through
my mind on the drive home.� I prayed she
wasn't raped.

But then I discounted that
irrational thought; Susan would have had me meet her at the hospital. This
thought never crossed my mind. Chastity was a virgin when we married. 

�I pulled away from my sister, angry. I became
wild and pushed past her running towards the house, my sister seconds behind
me.

I screamed, &quot;Where is that
bitch,&quot; Susan calmly stepped in front of me and quietly said,&quot;
Watch your mouth&quot; &quot;Your wife is in the kitchen&quot;. I followed
Susan into her kitchen. Chastity was sitting at the kitchen table wearing one
of Susan's white terry cloth bathrobes with her hair wrapped in a towel.
Chastity was leaning forward with her hands over her face, crying. I screamed, 'look
at me you bitch&quot; and tried to lunge at her: my sister tripped me
sending me sprawling. As I was scrambling to my feet, Susan punched me twice in
the stomach, doubling me over with pain and the knocking the wind out of me. 

&nbsp;

While I was trying to catch my
breath, Susan leaned over me and hissed,&quot; Don't you dare hit your wife in
anger.&quot; I taught you better then that&quot; adding; I told you to watch
your mouth&quot;. Chastity had stopped crying, she had jumped up abruptly,
overturned her chair and retreated with her back to the wall. She was staring
at us with her mouth open, speechless and couldn't believe that Susan had
interceded on her behalf the way she did.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I couldn't believe it either
thinking, &quot; how could a 49 year old woman hit so damn hard&quot;.� While I was trying to catch my breath, Susan
gently took my arm and firmly guided me to a chair and sat me down. Chastity
meekly sat down across from me next to Susan. Susan put her arm around her and
whispered for her not to talk but just listen. 

&nbsp;

We sat for a time not saying a
thing. Susan broke the silence, &quot;Take your towel off Chastity and show
your husband your shame&quot;. My wife removed the towel from her hair shaking
her head and smoothing down her damp hair with her hands.� Chastity did not have beautiful long silky
blond hair anymore. I loved her hair almost as much as she did. It was her
pride and joy. She said it defined her femininity and sexuality; she loved
touching it and having it touched. Chastity was left with a thick, choppy rough
cut of a bowl of blond hair uneven at the bottom. 

&nbsp;

Continuing,&quot; This is your
wife's shame&quot;. Susan said, &quot;it is the punishment she received from
the young man when he found out he was deceived by a married women&quot;.
&quot;I talked to her Jim, she confided in me&quot; In my heart I know she told
me the truth&quot;. Her shame is there for all to see&quot; 

&quot;

&nbsp;

Thank God things were kept
quiet&quot; This was the first and only time she ever strayed&quot;� &quot;She gave him oral sex, which is bad
enough; thank God she came to her senses and didn't have intercourse. Chastity
tried to leave but passed out from the alcohol&quot; &quot;Drunk is not an
excuse, but there you have it&quot;.&quot; Whatever Chastity is, she is not a
liar.&quot; I can't abide by liars.&quot; &quot;She never lied before this and
is not lying now&quot; &quot; I understand;&quot; Chastity needs your
forgiveness, and you need to forgive and let go.&quot; Chastity is family
Jim, she is your wife and my sister in law; we don't turn our back on
family&quot; &quot;That's all I have to say&quot; as Susan placed her hand on
Chastity's. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Chastity walked to me and
touched my hand saying,&quot; I'm sorry Jim, I so sorry and ashamed for what I
did to you, to us; can't you please forgive me&quot; I prayed Jim, I prayed to
God and asked his forgiveness&quot;. &quot; Susan forgave me.&quot; I promised
God to be a good wife.&quot; I made a promise to God to make amends &quot; I
made that same promise to Susan.&quot; I promise I will do whatever you say if
you will only take me back.&quot; &quot;I know in my heart you love me as I
love you.&quot;

&nbsp;

�Exhausted and drained by the turn of events,
all I could say to her was,&quot; Chastity, I can't deal with all this right
now.&quot;&quot; I want to say yes, but I need time to think and I can't be
with you right now&quot; I got up and left, Susan followed me to my car, 

&quot;

Do you love her little brother?'
she said gently. I sighed and said, &quot;I love her Susan; will you tell her
that for me?&quot; &quot; Chastity knows you love her, but I will tell
her.&quot; &quot;You have loved her since you were 15 years old&quot; &quot; 

&nbsp;

But how can I trust her now,
Susan?&quot; &quot;Chastity is not a liar, may God strike us both dead if I'm
wrong&quot;, Susan replied, &quot;Your wife is a good, but willful woman&quot;
&quot;Chastity needs some direction in her life to mature.&quot; 'She needs a
firm hand to guide her. That same firm open hand on her bare bottom; but never
in anger or violence; only to correct her.&quot; 

&nbsp;

&quot;You are partially to
blame.&quot; You're never home&quot; You are always at work&quot;. &quot; When
you are not at work you are fishing with your friends.&quot; You have stopped
doing things with her; at one time, you and Chastity were
inseparable.&quot;� 

&nbsp;

You own your own business.
&quot;You are your own boss. You can make your own hours. God bless you, you
have good people working for you. You have put your job before your family.
Chastity doesn't need a fancy car and expensive jewelry, she need you, and you
need her&quot; I've never interfered with your marriage but like it or not I'll
have my say hear and now.&quot; 

&nbsp;

Chastity can stay with me for a
month or so.&quot; There are things I can teach her, despite what she thinks.
God knows she's a trial some times and irritates the angels but despite
everything, I love her dearly.&quot; I see that look on your face&quot;;&quot;
don't be so surprised. &quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Stay away from her, talk to
on the phone if you like, you both need time to heal.&quot;� &quot;Alright, I'll trust you big sister, but
why are you so sure? My sister paused as if she didn't want to answer. &quot;I
took the belt to her three times. &quot;But Susan you said you believed her? I
do, but the Bible says with confession, followed by forgiveness, then
contrition&quot; The first time was her punishment for her indiscretion; then I
washed her mouth out with soap. Why the second time, Susan? &quot;That was for
shaming our good name; the third time was for calling Suzy.&quot;�� 

&nbsp;

I went home and slept like a dead
man, waking up early Tuesday morning. I showered and didn't fail to notice the
bruises on my stomach.� I went to my
dealership, got the master keys from service and opened the trunk. Everything
Susan reported missing was there excepting for Chastity's wedding band and
drivers license, house and car keys. 

&nbsp;

I noticed the back seat and floor
smelled like cleaning fluid. I got the Lincoln ready for sale, substituting a
red Ford Pinto for her use. On Thursday, I got an envelope in the mail with a
long blond ponytail and my wife's drivers license, car keys, house keys, and
wedding band.� Susan was right about my
wife. 

&nbsp;

I called Chastity and told her I
loved her and would take her back, but there will be uncompromising
conditions.� I would be making major
concessions and changes as well. I got my dealership in order, promoting
people, hiring others. 

&nbsp;

I scaled back my hours taking
weekends off and every other Monday then Friday.� I enrolled with a dancing school arranging
private lessons three nights a week.� I
talked to my wife everyday on the phone just to talk, something I never did
before at work. 

&nbsp;

Chastity's days were occupied. My
sister taught her, canning and baking. Chastity learned how to clean and
quarter chickens for the freezer: Susan never made her kill them though or
force her to watch while they were being killed.� Chastity worked in the salon doing odd jobs
including shampoos and comb-outs on the longhaired girls and women. Susan
taught Chastity her secrets for a perfect bun and soon Chastity knew them all
and was putting Susan's hair up for her; a penance of sorts, a contrast to her
own poor shorn head. 

&nbsp;

Chastity learned how to sew and as
it turned out had a natural aptitude for it. She was making dresses for herself
by the end of the month. Over the years, Chastity surpassed my sister in this
endeavor, and my sister deferred to Chastity's knowledge of sewing, much to
Susan's pride and delight. 

&nbsp;

Susan taught her how to handle
firearms, something I sadly neglected. Chastity became a cracked shot with my
Dad's old Remington .22 and could break a Ritz cracker at 50 yards each and
every shot; Chastity never hunted with me in later years but learned to fish. 

&nbsp;

Chastity even learned to shot my
sister's Smith &amp; Wesson 38 cal. revolver and was a fair shot. When I found
out I asked her,&quot; Which do you like to shoot best?' &quot; I like the 22
best of course.&quot; &quot;Susan says learning to shoot a handgun could be
useful someday&quot;. I did not see my wife for the entire two months as I had
promised and we agreed on another two weeks so Chastity, as Susan put it,
&quot; could learn to clean a house properly&quot;� 

&nbsp;

Everyday day when we talked it was
Susan said this, and Susan said that, and how Susan taught me this or Susan
taught me that; Chastity was finally seeing my sister trough my eyes.

&nbsp;

The day finally arrived when I
could finally see my wife and take her home with me.� When I arrived at my sister's house they were
sitting on the porch waiting. As I was walking to the porch, Chastity jumped up
from the rocker and ran down the steps.

I swept her up into my arms and
showered her with kisses holding her close and tight. We stepped back and
looked at one another.

&nbsp;

My wife, my Chastity was wearing an
apron. It covered a plain blue dress with a white collar: the dress that
Chastity made with her own hands.� Her
face was freshly scrubbed and free of all makeup. But her hair, her beautiful
honey blond hair was now dark brown like my sister's. Chastity's hair was
styled in a neat perfect bowl that curled under about one inch above her ears.
Chastity's remaining hair cut off a 1/4 inch long to draw attention to the top.
My once longhaired honey blond wife was now a brunette with a short little
girl's haircut. 

&nbsp;

I knew Chastity had to hate it but
it was one of the conditions. I controlled her hair in all things. Chastity
must earn back her long hair. Another condition was that she must dress
modestly in public and always in conservative jumpers and dresses. In time she
would be allowed nice skirts and blouses and form fitting modest dresses;
pantsuits were forbidden forever.� 

&nbsp;

Chastity would not be allowed any
makeup in public. In the privacy of our home, she could decide to wear makeup
if she wished or not, but she absolutely would wear it if I directed her to do
so. I was allowed to modify the conditions; she would obey them. Finally, she
would be disciplined for infractions; major infractions may include the belt to
be administered exclusively by Susan; as was only proper. Only Susan could
modify the last condition. 

&nbsp;

I cradled her poor shorn head in my
hands. I ran by hands from the base of her neck to the top of her head. The
bottom felt like a shorn pelt rubbed the wrong way. The top of her head was
soft and silky.� Susan walked up to us
and hugged us both, absolutely beaming, 

&nbsp;

&quot;How do you like her dress and
apron little brother, Chastity made them herself?&quot; she said.� &quot;Susan you gave her a little girls
haircut, I stated. &quot;Now she won't be turning young men's heads.&quot;
Susan explained, adding,� How do you like her dress and apron?&quot;� &quot;They are very nice,&quot; I said, but
why brown hair, Susan?&quot; &quot;When she learns to act like a proper modest
woman and wife she may have blond again, but for now, she has to earn it&quot;
Susan said. Looking at Chastity,&quot; Isn't that right little sister?&quot; 

&nbsp;

&quot;I will try to be a good wife
Susan&quot; Chastity replied. To which Susan announced,&quot; You will not just
try, you will succeed; after all you are a Banner woman&quot;, We left my
sister's promising to meet her in church on Sunday then drive to her house for
Sunday dinner.

We arrived home and went up to or
bedroom. 

&nbsp;

I had Chastity sort through her
closet. Most of her clothing was pantsuits, tight fitting blue jeans, and
blouses and tops to accentuate her beautiful figure.

The pantsuit issue was a holdover
of her mother's liberal influence; no wonder her father divorced her and moved
to the east coast when Chastity graduated from college. 

&nbsp;

When the closet was empty, it was
empty except for her shoes.

She was allowed to keep most of
these because they were appropriate for most occasions; Chastity never liked
fancy high heel shoes. I liked her barefoot. Chastity sometimes went without a
bra. I didn't like the idea and my sister certainly didn't approve.

Chastity's underwear was comprised
of plain bras and cotton panties. She generally slept in the nude. 

&nbsp;

Prior to her indiscretion, I always
figured that was her right and freedom to choose. After all I thought,&quot;
who was I to tell her what to wear; my wife must now submit even to this.

&nbsp;

Chastity unpacked her suitcase and
hung a dozen long modest dresses and jumpers she made during her stay with
Susan.

I cleaned out her dressers
completely, prior to her arrival getting rid of all her clothing. From the sale
of the expensive jewelry that Chastity carelessly left in the Lincoln, and
sparing no expense, I purchased the following:

Silk panties, plain or with lace
and ruffles, French knickers of the same, tongs with matching suspender belts
for the stockings. Various silk bras of all descriptions with a bodice to cover
them, as well as basques &amp; corsets for the garter belts and stockings of
every variety to suit my whims; pantyhose were forbidden. These she would wear
under her plain dowdy long dresses out of sight. 

&nbsp;

On the surface she was a plain and
modest woman with brown hair and a little girls haircut, but underneath. This
wasn't discussed, this would-be her surprise and submission. The plain dresses
were to her modesty and penance as was the short hair to her shame.

&nbsp;

When we were alone at home or in the
bedroom, I purchased for her: silk camisoles fancy and plain, sheer baby dolls,
nightdresses, long and short and revealing ones; and finally, silk
kimonos.� 

&nbsp;

I planned on returning her wedding
band and engagement ring. Other then a watch, and a few simple pieces, this is
all the jewelry she will be allowed. I will also sell the remainder of her
expensive flashy jewelry because a modest woman needs such, not. Fine silks
will now be Chastity's precious adornments. 

Moving
on: later that evening Chastity showered getting ready for our first night
together since her indiscretion. She came out of the bathroom wearing only a
towel around her middle; her wet hair was combed straight back away from her
face. 

&nbsp;

Chastity
had a demure smile on her face. I walked over and kissed her pulling off her
towel and slapping her playfully on her bare bottom. Standing there in all her
glory, I noticed for the first time that my wife had shaved her pussy bare and
smooth, just like a little girls.

&nbsp;

Taken
aback at this drastic change, though I had to admit that I liked it and was
turned on by it; while rubbing her bare pussy, I asked, &quot;Was this your
idea or was it Susan's?&quot; &quot;Susan says it is much easier to keep clean
this way.&quot; Chastity answered, &quot; Susan shaves hers.&quot; &quot; At
first I didn't like it, but now I love it this way&quot;.

&quot;Women
have needs too you know. Besides, now you don't have any excuses for not going
down on me&quot;.

Incredulous
and embarrassed about this revelation about my sister, 
I stammered, &quot;You discussed our sex life with my sister?&quot; Chastity
smugly replied,&quot; I discussed everything with Susan&quot;. 

&nbsp;

I
told Chastity that I had a surprise for her too. I took a red silk scarf from
her dresser folding it into a blindfold and tying it over her eyes.� I tied her arms together behind her back with
another red silk scarf.� I then placed
her back to one of the massive carved columns of our poster bed and secured her
tied hands to the column. While she was tied and helpless, I started rubbing her
all over, playing special attention to her breasts and bare pussy.

Chastity
was getting wet and aroused. I spread her legs apart and started probing her
vagina with my tongue.� I brought her
just to the point of orgasm, and then I stopped.� Leaving tied to the bed; I walked away and
took a leisurely shower.

&nbsp;

When
I returned, I repeated the process again, getting her aroused and denying her
orgasm. I then untied her from the post, leaving her hands tied.� I made kneel and give me a blowjob. When I
came, I untied her, had her put on her silk panties and then we went to bed.

I
warned not to play with her self or there would be consequences.

The
next morning, I took her shopping and selected some perfumes for her, which I
then purchased.� We spent the rest of the
day together and I surprised her by taking her dancing that evening.

When
we got home, I informed that I had taken two weeks off from work. For the next
to weeks, I got her aroused in various ways and denied her an orgasm. 

&nbsp;

During
the first week of this I caught Chastity masturbating in the shower.� I stopped her from finishing, and told her to
wait in the shower.� I got undressed and
got into the shower with her. I shampooed and conditioned her hair and lathered
her up with some lavender soap.� I shaved
her armpits and legs finishing up with her pussy, which I then rubbed with baby
oil. I then had her shampoo and wash me.

&nbsp;

When
we toweled off, Chastity received a good spanking on her bare bottom with my
good right hand. When I finished, and she stopped crying I again reminded her
that there would be consequences for defying me. The next time it would be at
Susan's with the belt.

&nbsp;

When
I decided it was time, we made love and I spent a long time getting her aroused
with gentle foreplay.� I went down on her
licking and sucking, probing and teasing with my tongue. 

I
brought her to multiple orgasms for the first time ever.

Chastity
in turn went down on me returning the favor. 

I
learned a great deal about my wife's sexual nature in those two weeks.
Especially Chastity's desire to be loved &amp; dominated, but not abused.

&nbsp;

I
made Chastity wear her hair in the little girls bowl haircut for about 8 months
and then let her grow it out a little bit.

From
1977 to 1978 it was approximately 2 inches long on the sides, with the bowl
just touching her ears and blended in softly.

From
1978 to 1979 I allowed her to grow it out and Susan styled it in a blunt ear
length bob with bangs.� By 1980 it was
the same blunt bob just at chin level. Sometime in 1980 Chastity met up with a
group of friends from college.� She decided
to wear makeup outside of the home without asking for permission; for this
occasion I would have made an exception and given her permission; instead, she
went behind my back.� Chastity was out of
town at the time and was seen by one of Susan's customers.� This mentioned customer bragged to Susan how
nice Chastity looked with makeup and how she should wear it all of the time.

&nbsp;

Susan
told me what transpired and of course I brought Chastity to the salon for the
belt and a haircut.

Chastity
was very quiet on the drive over to Susan's. She started crying when we pulled
in the driveway. I left her in my sister's capable hands with instructions to
come back in a couple of hours because she wanted to try something new with
her.

Three
hours later, I returned to my sister's house not knowing what to expect. When I
got there, Chastity was in Susan's bedroom. 

Through
the closed door, I could hear the crack of the belt land five times on my
wife's bare bottom.

Susan
came out of the bedroom and closed the door. She told me that Chastity would be
out shortly. 

&nbsp;

Susan
further went on to explain that she had cut Chastity's hair all the way around
to about two inches long. She then rolled her hair on small curlers and applied
a strong perming solution.

Susan
said that Chastity looked cute and to make sure that she not wash her hair for
a couple of days in order for the curls to set.

&nbsp;

When
Chastity came out of the bedroom, her hair was a mass of short curls that
hugged her head. Even her bangs were curled snug to her head.� Chastity cried all the way home. I didn't
have to say anything; I knew she hated her new hairdo. Chastity now looked like
a brown haired cupie doll.

&nbsp;

I
let her stew for a couple of days. I then washed her hair, and conditioned her
curls with hot oil as Susan had instructed.

When
her hair was finished, I had her go down on me while I played with her soft
curls. That was the last time that Chastity got the belt, another perm or short
haircut. On those rare occasions when she asked to wear makeup when she wasn't
with me, I always gave her permission.

&nbsp;

I
always loved long hair on my Chastity. I let her grow the perm out. Susan
gradually lightened her hair until it grew out to her natural color, just
trimming enough off to prevent split ends.�
When it had just touched her shoulders, Chastity was given a chin length
bob without bangs. Chastity's hair was now her natural virgin hair, with the
colored and permed hair on the cutting room floor.

&nbsp;

I
let Chastity grow her hair just a couple of inches below her shoulders. Her
hair was precisely blunt cut, no layers, straight across the bottom. When she
left the house, she was mandated to pin it up in a french twist, which I
preferred or a small bun.

&nbsp;

I
knew she wanted it longer, but made her keep that length for another 3
years.� Eventually, I let her it grow out
until it just touched the bottom of her butt.�
By that time it was too heavy and thick for a french twist and a variety
of buns were the preferred style. That was the longest length that she ever had
and it drove her wild in the sack when we made love and I caressed her body
with her long hair.

&nbsp;

When
she turned 50, we both decided that it should be cut back to waist length, and
it has stayed that way since.

&nbsp;

Well,
that's about it, Chastity is standing by my chair waiting for me to finish. We
have to leave now but I can't wait to get back home.
