Anticipation
By dirtydiva26, April 2008

Darkness surrounds me as I lay on my bed waiting with intrepid anticipation. Listening for the sounds of the door lock turning. Listening for the sound of foot steps. Trying to sense the smell of His aftershave. I wait. I yearn. Anticipation.

I moan, I wriggle, struggling for freedom from the silky ropes that bind me to the bed. My legs spread and tied tightly to the cold metal bed frame. The ropes between my thighs resting against my lips grow moist. Abandoned, alone in a dark room. Vulnerable in a position meant to welcome only Him.

I moan, I twist, I turn. Relentlessly I strive for freedom. With each pull the knots between my legs tighten, pulling on my pussy lips making them damper and hungry for Him. A silk handkerchief wrapped tightly around my eyes make it impossible to see. Darkness surrounds. Wait, I hear a noise. I listen. I hold my breath in anticipation. Is it Him?

No, I moan softly into the darkness. Alone. Sheer panic washes over me and I can&#8217;t help but think. He&#8217;s not coming. I cry out, I whimper, I struggle to free myself. The ropes tighten against my wrists, my legs twist and turn but the ropes do not loosen. Panic. Darkness overcomes me. I start to thrash violently in an attempt to get free.

Wait. I hear a noise. What is that? Suddenly a firm hand from out of the darkness presses hard against my chest, pressing me into the bed. He has come. I breathe a sigh of relief. He leans towards me and presses hard on my lips with his. I taste. He moves abruptly from the bed and reaches over. I turn my head in his direction but I can not see. Where is He? I shiver. Cold. The steel blade touches the bottom of my foot. I moan.

The sharp tip of the blade slides up from my foot, up my leg, to my thighs and lingers. He slides the blade and presses it to my pussy lips. Pressing harder, rubbing the tip of the knife against my clit. The ropes between my legs grow damp, I yearn�I hunger for Him, for His touch.

He slides the blade over my stomach, up to my chest and pauses on each breast. He reaches up with His free hand and clutches my throat, pushing me into the pillow. I struggle for a breath. He pushes the knife hard against my breast and squeezes my throat. SLAP. The sting of the knife against my left breast. SLAP. Then on my right breast. He pulls back suddenly. He tugs on my hair pulling my head back and presses the knife against my throat. He leans in again and kisses me hard on the lips. I gasp for air.

He places the knife on my chest, resting between each breast. One hand pulling my hair, He lifts the other hand and SLAP. A backhand across my left cheek. SLAP. SLAP. SLAP. I lay there dazed unable to move, I moan, I cry out. Tears form behind my closed eyes. He presses hard against my lips with His SLAP SLAP SLAP. Only this time the slaps were drawn upon my breasts. He pulls each nipple, twisting, turning, pinching. SLAP SLAP SLAP. He leaned down and with His teeth, bit down on one nipple. He let go of my hair and covered my mouth and nose so I couldn&#8217;t breathe. I scream in agony and feel myself start to drift away from Him.

I see stars. I see the moon�He pulls my hair roughly again and SLAP, my left cheek. And suddenly, He rips off the blindfold and shoves His cock into my mouth. He moans. I lay motionless as He rapes my mouth. Pulling and twisting my nipples, He continues to fuck my mouth. With one swift motion He pulls away. SLAP. Across the face. SLAP SLAP SLAP on both breasts. He pulls again, and I struggle for breath as He covers my mouth and nose.

I close my eyes and feel Him pull the ropes from my pussy away roughly. SLAP SLAP SLAP. He slaps my pussy. He moves the ropes away just enough for His cock to fit through and rams it in. In and out, He fucks me hard and fast. He grabs my hands and pulls hard against the ropes. I cry out in pain. Tears start to flow freely down my face and He licks them off one by one. SLAP SLAP SLAP as He continues to slap my face and breasts while fucking me hard. He moans. He trembles, He shakes.

He presses His lips firmly to mine and pulls on my hair. He grabs the knife that had fallen from my chest and again, presses it to my neck. He covers my mouth once more. He groans and fucks me harder, pulling in and out all the way. His cock covered in my juices soaking us both. The rope between my legs drenched in the sweet smell of Him. SLAP SLAP SLAP. He lets out a groan, He twitches, He jerks. He&#8217;s come.

He lays on top of me for a long moment catching His breath. I see the stars, the moon, the sun, the animals dancing with the Gods. I open my eyes and see Him lying on me with His head in between my breasts. He moves off the bed and carefully, gently, loosens the ropes around my feet. He unties my hands and rubs them working the circulation back into them. He sits me up, holding me, wraps me in a blanket. He offers me a cup of water. I drink. I taste. I lay my head on His shoulder.

He holds me tightly in His arms. He runs His fingers through my hair untangling it. He takes a hold of my chin and lifts my face up to His. I return to Him slowly. He smiles at me through His eyes. Filled with love, concern and content. He leans down and kisses me softly, tenderly, lovingly. He smiles. He has come.
