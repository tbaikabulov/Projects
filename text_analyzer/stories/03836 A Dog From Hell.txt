Synopsis: Helen is in love. David likes to play. Helen will humiliate herself for her love. David thinks this is a great idea. Part 1: A kiss in the mirror 
�Now get down on your knees!� 
I looked at the floor. The tiles were wet, footprints in dirt. Footprints
  left by shoes of many men emptying their bladders hour after hour. I felt slightly
  nauseous. The shivering worsened. I could smell the urine on the floor, I could
  see the yellow surfaces of urinals. I couldn't. I couldn't do it. 
�Get DOWN on your knees, Helen� said David impatiently. �Now!� he added, lifting
  his voice just a little bit to show his irritation. I looked down in shame. 
�I� I can't do it� The shivering intensified. I hesitated looking up to his
  face to see his reaction. 
He was staring at me as if thinking whether slapping me was the thing to do. 
�Aw, come on. What the fuck is this now? Eh? What the FUCK?� His voice rose
  at the end of the sentence and produced a brief echo in the men's room. 
�David, please� my voice sank. I was barely able to whisper. I knew he'd be
  mad. �I�� 
�Aw, shut the fuck up, man.� He cut right into it. �Shut the fuck, up, Helen,
  I don't need to hear your excuses. Just get DOWN on your fucking knees right
  now or stop wasting my time with your babbling.� He made a gesture as if he
  was going to leave. 
�No� David, please� I looked at the floor again. No, I couldn't do it. 
�Aw, fuck� said he in a disappointed voice. He checked the time on his telephone. �Yo,
  I knew you were a disappointment, Helen. Fuck. I did hope you'd come through
  for me, but now I'm not sure why. You're just not like that. You talk the talk,
  but that's about it. When it comes to putting your money where your mouth is
  you're just a little scared girl.� 
By this point the shivering turned into trembling. I was beyond control, my
  throat dry and tight, my eyes going blind from the tears. I was shaking my
  head left to right. I wanted to tell him how much he meant to me, I wanted
  to tell him he was the only man I cared about. I wanted to tell him that I
  just needed some more time. I'd do it for him. For him I would. 
But I couldn't speak. I was staring at him, tears starting to roll down my
  cheeks. I was unworthy of looking into his face, the failure staring back in
  silence. He was right. I was a worthless cunt. I was a waste of his time. 
David never punished me for anything. I deserved my punishment, oh, how I
  deserved it. I deserved to be slapped right there on the spot. Slapped like
  a little girl acting obnoxiously in front of her parents, or a prostitute acting
  up in front of her pimp. I deserved to have my hair pulled and to be forced
  to my knees, to have my face shoved into the urinal right there. But, David
  never punished me for anything. He never cared enough to punish me, never cared. 
I looked at the floor. I closed my eyes, then opened them again. It didn't
  get any cleaner. I started lowering myself slowly. For him. For him, I will
  do it. I didn't deserve him, but he didn't deserve me refusing his orders. 
David noticed the change in my attitude and mumbled approvingly. �That's more
  like it, sweetie, show me you can be a good girl.� He seemed pleased that the
  situation was getting firmly under his control. �But first, I want you to take
  your shoes off.� 
I looked at him in puzzlement for a second. He nodded reassuringly, smiling
  at me, all his impatience and anger now just a distant memory. He made a gesture
  with his hand, encouraging me to take my shoes off. I was wearing pointy, sexy
  high heels, just for him. The shoes he pointed out in a shop's window one day
  and said �These are the shoes for a true whore. The one that's true at heart'.
  I bought them the next morning and the next evening I had one of the strongest
  orgasms in my life. True at heart. 
These shoes had higher heels than any shoes I ever owned before. They were
  not particularly comfortable or easy to walk in. Wearing them made me feel
  very self-conscious, the first few days I was barely able to walk the streets
  because I imagined everyone's eyes on me. They make me look like a whore, I
  kept telling myself. 
I remember the salesgirl at the shop while I was trying them on. I couldn't
  believe how calm and businesslike she was. Because I was breathless and hot
  in the face. I knew I was blushing as the unknown sensation was overcoming
  my whole self. I was no stranger to wearing high heels, yet my feet were never
  arched this way, my bottom was never so high up, so firm, my legs never looked
  this long. I couldn't stop eyeing myself in the mirror as my heart kept drumming
  with excitement. A whore. A true whore. That's what I kept repeating to myself.
  I stayed in them after I paid and walked all the way home rather than taking
  a taxi, despite them being rather uncomfortable. My panties were so wet after
  I reached my apartment from all the looks I got that I had to fight the urge
  to phone David straight away. This was supposed to be a surprise. 
�Come on, sweetie� David's soft voice brought me back to the present, �take
  them off�. 
The weather was getting warm. I was walking around with no stockings on for
  a couple of weeks already. All I had on besides the shoes was a thin golden
  chain around my left ankle. I detested the idea of stepping on the men's room
  dirty floor with bare feet. But I made the decision. For David. I first took
  my left shoe off. The cold, wet tiles made me shiver all over again. I removed
  the other shoe. I felt strangely vulnerable standing barefoot on the floor
  of one room where I had no place being to start with. 
�Come on, love, I'll take care of those�, David took my shoes with a smile
  and put them aside. �Go on, go on, keep us entertained�, he waved. 
Shaking where I stood I knew what I had to do. He explained it all to me beforehand,
  while we were sitting at the restaurant's table and eating vegetarian salads.
  I knelt on one knee, rolling my skirt up to avoid it getting dirty as much
  as possible. Thankfully, it was short to start with. 
�That's a good whore, Helen. Now get down on the floor� 
Oh my God. He called me a whore. I was barefoot in a public toilet, kneeling
  in dirty water next to a urinal and the man who would not be my lover called
  me a whore. 
The shivers didn't subside but kneeling on the tiles and holding onto the
  urinal I was more able to control myself. How long were we in the toilet already,
  anyway? It seemed like ages even though it probably was not more than a minute.
  How long before someone walks in? How long before David is pleased and we can
  go? 
�Come on, Helen, be a good girl now. You know you how much you wanted this.� 
I do? Do I? Did I want this? Did I want to be taken to a fine dinner in a
  suburb restaurant, have two glasses of red wine while listening to David's
  enchanting voice and then be taken to a dirty toilet and humiliated like the
  cheapest prostitute in the world? Did I want this? 
He put his phone up, looking at the display. He put his other hand on his
  groin and started to massage the bulge clearly visible through the fabric of
  the trousers. 
Did I want this? 
I looked at the urinal. I saw where its white face turned yellow from shame.
  From having thousands of customers piss in it. I saw a wrinkled pubic hair
  in there, somehow stuck and stubbornly resisting the stream of water. 
Did I want this? 
I knew. He was right. David was right. I knew I wanted it. I knew, because
  my panties were so wet even back there in the restaurant, I was afraid there
  would be a spot on my skirt. Because merely kneeling down on the floor almost
  made me orgasm. Because he knew what I was. At heart. A dirty slut. A true
  whore. Wet from humiliation. Wet from shame. 
As I slowly positioned my face inside the urinal I heard the sound of zipper
  opening. I closed my eyes and brought my face down. My nose touched the cool
  surface of the urinal's insides. With my eyes closed, the smell was occupying
  most of my mind. The smell of urine. The smell of male piss. Generations of
  male piss on top of each other, right there under my nose. It was intoxicating.
  It made my head spin. It should have made me want to puke in disgust. Instead,
  dear Lord, forgive me, it made me horny. It made me horny with shame, horny
  with humiliation and pure desire to be fucked. I heard the clicking sound mobile
  phones make when taking pictures. I wanted this. 
I turned my head back so David could get a picture of my face wet from water.
  Wet from stale male piss. I looked over my shoulder, back at him, as he was
  taking another picture, his left hand slowly stroking his erect penis. I was
  wet, my cunt dripping with the desire to be fucked. I looked over my shoulder
  back at David. David� Oh, David, my love. Why don't you fuck me? 
�Come on, sweetie, let's see some action now� said he, breathing heavily. 
�Baby�� I whispered, �Why don't you fuck me? I am so horny and wet. I need
  your cock so bad. Come on, baby, why don't you give it to me? Please�� 
David masturbated slowly. He made a gesture with his other hand: 
�Come on, get your face back in there, Helen. Show me what you got. Come on.� 
I turned to face the urinal once again. Another tear rolled down my cheek
  but it didn't matter any more, my face would be wet in a matter of seconds. 
I leaned forwards, I buried my face into the urinal. The smell overcame my
  whole being once again. But this time around I didn't just breathe in deeply.
  This time around I placed my face onto the cold surface and extended my tongue. 
�Oh, yeah, whore, oh, yeah, do it�, David's voice was deep and soft as he
  got closer to me to get pictures. His breathing was fast, his words bouncing
  up and down as he accelerated the strokes. �You are such a whore, Helen. Such
  a dirty fucking whore.� 
This was too much. I was never humiliated in this way, never brought so low.
  I couldn't take it any more. Despite the instructions he gave me in the restaurant,
  I reached between my legs and started touching myself. My panties were so wet
  they were sticking to the smooth skin around my cunt. They WERE my second skin.
  Touching myself through them brought me immense pleasure. Until David slapped
  my arse: 
�Stop that right now, Helen. You know you are not allowed to masturbate.� 
I knew. David� When will I stop being a failure and become worthy of you? 
�I am� sorry� I couldn't stop myself� I am sorry, David�� 
�Stop yakking, cunt, and show me how you clean that urinal with your tongue.
  I didn't come here to listen to you talk.�, David was masturbating again, my
  apologies just fuelling a stream of insults rolling down from his tongue. I
  made him hot and hard. I made you hot and hard, David. 
His phone made more of those clicking noises as I licked the inner side of
  the urinal. I cried silently, the tears flowing without spasms or loud noises,
  as I cleaned the piss, lapping like a dog. Every few seconds I'd bury my face
  in water at the bottom but then go again to licking the urine. I looked for
  the wrinkled pubic hair in there and collected it with my tongue. I positioned
  my face so that David could see what I was doing as I swallowed. Then I continued
  licking as his breathing got louder and louder. 
�Oh, God. Oh, you fucking whore, lick that piss, clean that fucking thing,
  I want to see it shine after you're done. Come on, you slut, you toilet slut,
  do it!!� 
And he made more of the pictures as I obeyed, trying to lick all of the yellow
  off, eager to please him, eager to make him happy. 
�That's it, slut, you know where you belong. You'll get better at this with
  time. Oh, yes� Oh, yes� Oh, God! Oh GOD!! OH, FUCK, HELEN, FUCK, FUCK, FUCK,
  YOU DIRTY WHORE, HELEN!!!!� 
I felt gushes of his semen fall on my hair as he was shouting in orgasm. David
  was cumming on me. David was shooting his cum all over his whore's hair as
  his whore continued licking the urinal in the men's room. Another clicking
  noise. And then another. Breathing slowing down. 
He was done. He came and that was all that is important. No one walked in.
  And now it was over. I started lifting my head up and away from the dirt. 
�Hey, hey, hey, hey, where the fuck do you think you're going?� David pushed
  my head gently downwards. �There's more on the menu, sweetie.� 
More? More on the menu? I couldn't possibly tell what he had in mind but he
  wanted my face back in the urinal and that's where it belonged. 
�That's a good girl. Stay like that.� I could hear him click and whirr with
  the phone and adjust his position behind me. �Just like that� 
A hot stream of fluid hit the back of my head. 
�Awwww, fuuuuck!!!!�, exclaimed David, rejoicing in his relief, triumphant
  in my humiliation, every little filthy detail of it. �Come on, turn your head
  a bit to the side. That's it, that's a good slut.� 
He aimed with his penis and pissed in my face. I kept my eyes tightly shut
  to keep his urine out. To keep the image out. To keep my tears in. This will
  be over, it will be over soon, it's almost over, Helen. 
Nobody ever did this to me. I wouldn't let anybody do this to me. Only David.
  And not even David told me he'd do this. He never mentioned pissing all over
  my face and hair after he already humiliated me beyond all limits I could imagine.
  He was using me. He was using me selfishly like he ever did, using me as I
  was full of shame, helpless, broken and horny, my God, so horny, so dirty,
  so wet and horny. He had me where he wanted me. So he decided to piss all over
  me. 
�Agghhh, fucking shit, MAN, what a whore you are, Helen. What a WHORE you
  are.� He kept repeating that word. He kept repeating that word as my stomach
  muscles convulsed with every repetition. He stepped back, mumbling to himself,
  presumably putting his dick back in place and tucking himself in. 
�You can touch yourself now, whore. I know how wet you must be right now.
  God, isn't that fascinating?� I could hear him move behind me but my mind was
  now focusing on one thing only. �Oh, wait, did I say �fascinating'? I meant
  disgusting. Yeah, yeah, that's the word I was looking for. Dis-fucking-gusting.
  A toilet slut all wet from being pissed upon. Nice one, Helen, nice one. Get
  on with it!� 
My mind was focusing on one thing only, as I buried my hand between my thighs
  and felt the swollen labia under my fingertips. I found my clit and started
  nervous, quick circular motions. I extended my ring-finger and pushed the fabric
  of my panties in. I managed to get almost half a finger up my cunt before the
  fabric stretched to its limit. It didn't matter. I was cumming. I was cumming
  like a whore David knew I am from the first minute he laid his eyes on me.
  I was cumming with my face in the urinal, moaning into its porcelain ear, kissing
  its porcelain lips. I was cumming, violently thrusting my hips onwards, trying
  to fuck my fingers through my soaked panties. I was cumming, my hair and face
  wet from David's semen and piss, cumming in front of him, giving him what he
  wanted to see. A whore unable to control itself. A slut he found in me and
  dragged to the surface screaming. A slave begging to be enslaved. A soul begging
  to be freed. All that, at the tip of my fingers, twitching, hot and slippery. 
I came like a bitch for David but it could not, would not be enough. I couldn't
  stop myself. I had to cum again. Please, I have to come again. 
I used my fingers on me, stroking my clit, and fucking my cunt so wet and
  slippery from my own juices. I moaned in a low, harsh voice, trying to keep
  it down as pleasure kept building up and up and up, threatening to destroy
  whatever was left of me there. I was nearing it. I was getting close to my
  second orgasm and I was scared as I furiously fucked myself with my fingers.
  I was scared of losing control but I couldn't stop myself. I moaned and groaned
  into the urinal. 
And then. 
�Lady?� 
No. No, please no. 
�Lady?� 
Please, no, God, please no, no, please, don't let this happen, please no,
  please God. 
�Lady, are you feeling alright?� 
God, no, please, no. 
So close� I was so close. 
�Lady, is there something wrong? Want me to call a doctor?� 
No no no no no no no no no no no 
Like a reel of film slowed down to that ridiculous speed that makes people
  in it float through the air comically. Unable to break away. I turned around. 
A fat, balding men in a blue jumpsuit, mobile phone in his hand. Puzzled look
  on his face. 
No David anywhere in sight. 
Please God, no. 
I leapt to my feet but the film reel refused to roll any faster. 
God, why? Why? 
David is gone. The door. Where is the door? 
Left. Right. Left again. I started to run. He kept talking. Confused, fast
  talk. No words I could understand. The door. Its frame was frozen in front
  of my eyes. Impossible to reach and infinitely far away. I ran towards it but
  it kept the distance. 
In one long, eternal breath I broke through the door and ran through the restaurant,
  blind with tears and layers of red in front of my eyes. I had no idea where
  to run. I moved through tar, every step taking whole lifetimes. I caught glimpses
  of surprised faces, men, women. No, no, no, no, God, why? No, please, no. 
I made it to the street and kept running, my breath burning my lungs with
  every step. My bare feet made short, sharp noises against the concrete. My
  shoes. My slut shoes. I left them behind. Lost. Forever. 
Just keep running. Just keep running. 
And then I realised I was near the parking lot. And then I realised David
  was sitting on the bench in front of it. He made a comical gesture as if to
  protest because of me talking so long to arrive. My shoes, my slut shoes were
  resting on the bench at his side. 
�You sure took your sweet time, sweetie�, he said, getting up. �Come on, let's
  get into a car, you look a mess.� 
Part 2: Vapour claws 
�Did you know I studied to be a painter?� asked David completely out of the
  blue. About an hour and a quarter before he was to humiliate me by pissing
  all over my face in that toilet, we were driving through thick traffic to get
  to this restaurant David claimed I had to see. Most of the ride we weren't
  talking at all. David played his hip-hop CDs at brutally high volume, my whole
  body vibrating with thumping beats. He also rapped along the music, using his
  best African-American accent (not that anybody would mistake him for a ghetto
  gangster). He didn't know half of the lyrics and he seemed to be focusing exclusively
  on swear words, threats to police and threats to women, catching a line or
  two and rapping along the recorded voice before trailing off. He kept himself
  amused in between by insulting other drivers and shouting at pedestrians foolish
  enough to try crossing the street near his car. 
It took me a while to realise he was talking to me. Then another few moments
  to realise it was actually a question. He was ignoring me so efficiently most
  of the ride that I had to make an extra effort to become involved in a conversation
  with him. 
�No� No, you never told me about it, David.� I love pronouncing his name,
  it feels so� intimate. 
David smiled and extended his arm through the window to warn the teenager
  readying to cross the street that it will be his utmost pleasure to run her
  over. 
�Oh, I didn't? Weird. I usually thump my chest and boast about it to everyone
  I meet. DO I LOOK LIKE A MOTHERFUCKING ROLEMODEL TO A KID LOOKING UP TO ME?
  LIFE AIN'T NUTHIN' BUT BITCHES AND MONEY!!!� David effortlessly switched to
  his normal voice after rapping these lines �I was obsessed with drawing ever
  since I was a little snot-nosed kid. Then I wanted to be a painter as soon
  as I understood that it means sitting around at home all day and not having
  to work in the office like regular people do. YEAH, FUCK YOU MAN, WHERE DID
  YOU BUY YOUR LICENSE, EH?� David made a very rude gesture towards the older,
  bespectacled man who was driving too slowly by his estimation and who refused
  to drive on the sidewalk so that David can get by at his chosen speed. 
�But seriously, I started painting for real in high school and I was good
  enough for the arts college. I mean, had things gone the way it was planned,
  I would have been a proper painter now.� 
I didn't know this. David was a college lecturer in computer sciences. I met
  him on a meeting between our school and his college, discussing a project they
  were looking to support. He was a bit eccentric to say the least, even on that
  first meeting with sharp, direct approach to discussion, strange sense of humour
  and a spark of madness in his eyes. But I never thought of him as art type.
  David? No, he never struck me as a creative soul, he was too destructive, too
  nervous, too nihilistic to be creative. 
�So what happened?� I asked, struggling to be heard over the roar of David's
  car stereo. He slammed the car horn hard, instead of giving me an answer. 
�LADY, THAT'S SO NICE!!! I LOVE IT!! YOU HAVE TO TEACH ME HOW TO DRIVE LIKE
  THAT!!!� David was screaming at a middle aged woman blocking our way in an
  attempt to make a turn and apparently struggling with her car. I am sure he
  was aware that his behaviour was not going to help her become any more efficient
  but David is like that, he will always go for cheap instant gratification over
  efficiency. He kept hitting the horn and barking at the woman. 
�WHAT'S THAT? WHAT'S THAT? YOU'RE TELLING ME TO FUCK OFF?� 
The woman, obviously irritated made an unmistakeable gesture, adding something
  in a voice too soft for me to hear. But David was either able to hear her through
  his window or just decided to fill in the blanks through his imagination. After
  all, the whole drama was largely in his mind, rather than a concrete reality. 
�She's telling me to fuck off, is she? Aw, that won't do, no, that won't fucking
  do.� He reached to the back seat. �Where's my piece, eh? Where's my fucking
  piece?� Then he found what he was looking for and got his attention back to
  the chosen victim of the moment. �Let's see if you're so talkative now, nigga!!!� he
  pointed his weapon through the window towards the woman. 
�David, please�� I whispered. But there was no way for him to hear me through
  a snowstorm of beats and angry voices on his stereo. 
�FUCK DA POLICE! FUCK! FUCK! FUCK DA POLICE!!!� he rapped along to the music,
  following the rhythm with his outstretched arm, clutching the handle of the �piece'.
  He aimed at the woman. I saw the look of sheer blind panic on her face as she
  automatically raised her arms up to try and stop the expected bullets. From
  where she was sitting the light was probably completely preventing her from
  seeing the dayglo colours and the sci-fi features of David's �gun'. David squeezed
  the trigger repeatedly, spraying her windshield with water, laughing maniacally. 
�That'll teach her to fuck with the straight up G's, yo!� he said, pleased
  with himself as he packed his pistol back and drove around the woman who was
  out of her car now and shouting at him. �I have to remember to fill the clip
  with my piss one of these days, to put an extra twist on the formula. Fear,
  man. Fear is what makes them respect you. With no respect you lose your turf,
  your possessions and eventually your life, homie, youknwowhatimsayin?� 
I would have been shocked if I didn't know David by now. 
�Where was I?� said he. I opened my mouth but he remembered. �Ah, the arts
  college. Well, you know, the usual story, as time passes you realise that the
  art world is just as prone to being run by cliques and lobbyists as any other
  world. And that there's no big money in it unless you put your arse up for
  grabs. And you feel like telling everyone to sod off because if you're going
  to whore yourself, there's less painful ways to do it. And so you do. And someone
  close to you decides to OD and, you know, die.� 
The last sentence caught me completely unprepared. Perhaps David's disillusioned
  description of the �art world' was just part of his act as many other things
  he says and does are. Perhaps even that last sentence was part of the act,
  it wouldn't be the first. But then again, David is a human being, despite his
  claims and all the evidence he supplies to the to the contrary. I know that
  he is and I know he can hurt and grieve just like any of us. What he said could
  be a sign of that grief. And he shared it with me, how ever frivolously and
  superficially. I felt for David that moment. And I was grateful for being there,
  for letting me be near him and letting me know he was hurt once. 
�What happened?� I asked and then his phone rang. 
The next thirty seconds I was listening to David reject and deny whatever
  it was the person on the other side was saying. At least the music was down
  to a tolerable level now. 
�Nononononono, that won't happen. Do you hear me, Caroline? That won't happen
  in this world, OR the next!� 
Caroline was the assistant in David's department. I have never met her but
  David mentioned her often, sharing with me his scorn about the way she looked
  at child-raising, about the way she dressed and about the way she pronounced
  the word �often'. 
�No. No way. I don't give a shit, Caroline. Let me put it this way: I. DON'T.
  FUCKING. CARE. Get that?� 
I don't think Caroline was too happy having to talk to David at all, after
  hours, on his mobile phone with rude hip-hop music in the background. He knew
  that, making it more difficult for her just out of malice. He looked at me
  and rolled his eyes several times, expressing his frustration with having to
  communicate with lower forms of existence. Then he barked back into the phone. 
�Hey, I don't care. Fuck him, man. Yeah, tell him that's EXACTLY what I said.� He
  listened to her, no doubt agitated response, �Don't worry, he will know I would
  say something like that anyway. He doesn't get to control my free time like
  that, you know. Ta-ta, bye!!!!� 
David closed his phone and turned to me triumphantly. 
�You have to step up and say �Hell no!!' to the man, otherwise, you're fucked
  for your life, nigga!� He was happy with his little victory there. 
�David...� I hesitated. 
�Yeah?� 
�You� You said something about somebody dying.� 
�I said what?� He looked genuinely surprised. I felt my heart sink. He just
  made it up right there to play with me and he managed to forget it in a matter
  of seconds. 
�You said�� I hesitated. Maybe I shouldn't go there? �You said somebody close
  to you had� died�� 
�Oh, that.� David looked the other way and for a moment he struggled to come
  with the right words. This never happens to David I know. The moment grew longer
  and longer. I put my hand on David's knee. The David I know and love. 
Then his phone rang. 
�Aw COME ON!!!� David grimaced looking at the caller ID on his display. �That's
  not FAIR!!!� 
The next minute and a half David was using his nicest, most reasonable voice,
  agreeing with everything the person on the other side said and ending many
  sentences with �sir'. 
�Oh, certainly! Why, of course!! No need to, no need to, really, it's fine.
  I will, sir. It'll be a pleasure. Certainly. Certainly. With pleasure!!� 
When the conversation ended, he looked up at me, infuriated, irritated and
  angry. He stopped the car. He brought the telephone to eye level and put the
  middle finger up to the display. 
�FUCK YOU!!! FUCK YOU FUCK YOU FUCK YOU, YOU HEAR ME MAN? FUCK YOU AND YOUR
  FAMILY!� He was hitting the display with his middle finger. �Imma fuck you
  up, man!! Imma fuck you up COLD, nigga!!� 
He closed the phone and threw it into the glove compartment. He turned to
  me, apparently to explain the reason for his irritation, completely ignoring
  the chorus of car horns rising behind us. 
�Fuck!!! That was Craig, may his soul rot in hell for eternity. There go our
  plans to have an intimate weekend in the countryside.� 
I blinked. He started the car. Our plans? Intimate weekend in the countryside? 
�Oh, David.� I smiled, feeling tender. He never told me about the plan for
  the weekend. He wanted to surprise me. Oh, David. 
�Aw, I'm kidding, don't go all gay on me, woman. The only plan I had for the
  weekend was to sleep until noon and my boss just HAD to fuck it all up for
  me. I'm gonna pay him back once. With interest!!!� 
He was kidding? Just like that? He was kidding? A small, cruel joke to have
  my heart rise and then sink in a matter of seconds. This is the David I know.
  David I know and Love. 
�Here we are, Helen,� He announced �Get ready to taste the food of gods�.
  The restaurant was in front of us and David pulled the car towards the parking
  lot. 
* 
�One of the advantages of this restaurant is that the washroom is in such
  an illogical, concealed place that barely anyone knows it exists� said David
  while he was examining the menu. At that point in time I didn't understand
  the full meaning of this sentence. I didn't pay much attention either. For
  all I knew, David wanted us to have a quiet dinner together in a restaurant
  he recently discovered. I should know better. I really should. 
�What will it be, sir?� asked the waiter. His face will be a mask of utter
  confusion roughly an hour from now, seen as static frame after frame in unmoving
  time without breath. David looked up to him and smiled. 
�Anything not containing body parts of a murdered animal, my good man.� 
The waiter blinked. 
David smiled reassuringly. 
�He's vegetarian�, I said. 
�Ah.�, said the waiter. 
�Can you get us two vegetarian salads?� 
�With pleasure, madam�, said he and turned on his heel. 
I looked at David. He was busy with his phone. 
�I know what you're thinking�, he said, looking at his phone's display. 
�You do?� I had no idea what he was talking about. With David this is a rule,
  rather than an exception. 
�Yes, you're thinking I was lying to you.� 
I still didn't know what he was talking about. I wasn't thinking he was lying
  to me. I never do. David will say a lot of things that will sound off the wall
  and improbable but then, if you know him well enough like I do, you'll know
  he is just being playful. In his completely infuriating way. And even though
  I have seen him lie to other people many times, complex, intricate lies, lovingly
  told by someone obviously taking pleasure in lying, I never thought he'd lie
  to me. That would be too simple for David. He gets more fun out of truth with
  me than he could ever get out of lying to me. Truth hurts more. And this is
  his fun. 
�But I wasn't.� he continued. He brought the phone up so I could see the display. �I
  really studied to be a painter and I will draw a thing or two to amuse myself
  from time to time.� 
I took the phone from his hand. I looked at the display. That was me there.
  David wasn't lying. I felt my face blush. That was me there, a small drawing
  of me on David's display. 
�Hand-drawn and then scanned and then photoshopped�, said David not without
  pride. 
I looked at him but then had to look down again. I couldn't stand to look
  him in the eyes, not with my head starting to spin and my panties starting
  to get wet. That was me there, my face just a simple pattern of thin lines
  and a lot of white. But that was me there. Like those Japanese cartoons, I
  was so simple there, yet that was me, no mistake. That was me there, David
  creating me with his hands, one line at a time, creating light and darkness
  with the merest of gestures. That was me there, dressed like a whore, my clothes
  cheap, slutty and torn, as if I was assaulted and raped prior to being chained
  to the wall. That was me there in torn stockings, high heels, my breasts visible
  through holes in a short, tight blouse, my wrists cuffed and chained to the
  wall. There was a ball gag in my mouth. 
I still couldn't look into David's eyes. He created me. He created me with
  his own hands. He showed me how easy it was. So easy, so easy for him. 
* * * 
Driving back from the restaurant was like falling through clouds made of cotton-wool.
  I didn't mind David's loud music for once. Rather, I was thankful for the sensory
  deprivation it provided. I didn't want to talk, I didn't want to see or hear
  anything. I didn't want to think. I sank into the seat and sat there with closed
  eyes, trying not to exist for a while. David was mercifully leaving me alone,
  focusing on driving and rapping along his music. There was a woman he treated
  like a cheapest slut just minutes ago on the seat next to him, a woman he humiliated
  in public in a way that was obviously planned and preconceived and that obviously
  made him happy. 
I didn't want to think. I just wanted to feel. To feel the warm, relaxed glow
  running slowly through my body. I just had two crushing orgasms, two orgasms
  I reached through almost complete loss of control and dignity. Two screaming
  peaks of pleasure I got through severe humiliation. My body was like a broken
  toy and I hated myself for feeling so good about it. 
The man who brought the humiliation to me, the man who enjoyed so much turning
  me into a toilet slut was sitting next to me and rapping in a broken American
  accent about the harms he will bring on to a rival street gang. There seemed
  to be no concern on his part about how I felt or what I thought about the humiliation
  he brought on me. He had me lick the piss off the urinal. He ejaculated all
  over my hair. Then he urinated all over my hair and face and then he had me
  masturbate for him, my face still in the urinal, just so he could leave me
  for a stranger to run into me. He had me running barefoot, my face and hair
  wet from his piss, running through a restaurant and down the street, for all
  the world to see his toy. And he didn't care. 
And he knew. He knew that lying there on the passenger seat of his car, still
  wet from piss and shaking from shame, he knew how I hated myself. Because the
  two orgasms I had were not enough, because thinking of it all (and I didn't
  want to think, no) made me hot and wet again. 
�Well, this is it, love. This is where you get off.� 
David stopped the car in front of my house and very unceremoniously waited
  for me to get out. David knew. And he didn't care. 
No point in talking, is there? 
I got out of the car, wondering if my neighbours peered through their windows
  and raised their eyebrows seeing how wet my hair was and that I had my shoes
  in my hands instead of on my feet. What will they say to their wives and husbands?
  What will they say to other neighbours in their gossip sessions? Whatever they
  tell them, they will be wrong. Except saying that I have become a true whore.
  Yes, David, you knew. True at heart. 
�I'll call you Helen�, said David. �That was VERY much fun.� He started the
  car and disappeared down the street. I slowly walked towards the door, my slut
  shoes in my hands, my bare feet touching now quickly cooling pavement. 
Unlock the door. 
Feed the cat. Then check the messages. I can't ring Julia back now, not just
  now. Then recharge your phone. All the while trying not to. Trying not to kneel
  on the floor, put my hands between my thighs, close my eyes, masturbate, back
  again in that toilet. Again, humiliated and hot. David, you could have had
  me any way you wanted. You could have made me do anything you wanted. I'd do
  anything for you. Why this, why like this? 
Put the shoes back into place. The high heeled slut shoes David spotted in
  the window one day. Take the clothes off. They need to be cleaned. Look into
  the mirror. Look at that slut. Look at that slut, oh, my God, look at her make-up,
  smeared all over her whorish face. I bet she sucks cocks for a living. I bet
  she fucks in men's rooms for a living. I bet she enjoys being fucked like a
  dirty bitch, right there on the toilet floor. I bet she enjoys eating cum and
  drinking piss, I bet she licks urinals for fun. 
No! No, stop it!!! 
But why? Look at her cunt. Look at it. See, it's clean shaven, the way prostitutes
  do. And look at it, when she opens the lips with her fingers, look how wet
  she is. She wants it. She needs it. Come on, stick one finger up her cunt.
  See how she rocks her hips right away. She needs it. 
Oh, God, no, God, no. 
Yes. Yes, get down on the floor, down on the floor now!! 
The tiles are cold. They make me shiver. I don't want to do this. No. 
Get DOWN on the fucking floor, you fucking slut! On your fucking back! Get
  your legs up in the air, now!! 
Close your eyes if it makes you feel less violated. Oooh, you're sucking your
  finger now, are you? You like the taste of your cunt, do you? Let's see that
  cunt fucked properly now, shall we? 
David� Please� 
One, two, three fingers in. I can't believe you're so fucking wet, whore.
  I can't believe you're rocking your hips like that, whore. Round and round
  and round we go, in circles. 
David... David� Please. Take me, please. Take me like that, please. 
The phone rang. My heart missed a couple of beats but I was safe. I was safe,
  locked in my own home, on my own bathroom floor, on my back, my legs up in
  the air. I ignored it. I kept fucking myself with the three fingers of my right
  hand, using my left hand to pinch my nipples and squeeze my tits. 
Yes. Oh, yes, that's it, baby, fuck me harder. Hurt me, baby, please, fuck
  your slut, hurt her, she loves when you do it, please baby, don't stop. 
The phone rang again, then the machine kicked in. 
�E, yo, it's me.� I opened my eyes. David's voice was calm in a totally surreal
  way. �Just wanted to check if you're OK.� 
I got up as quick as I could and ran into the living room. 
�I guess you're in the shower at the moment, which is, I guess, expected and
  justified.� 
I grabbed the receiver. It was so sad. I am so sad. In a way, it would have
  been interesting leaving the machine on and hearing what David had to say.
  Speaking to the machine, he could have said things he wouldn't say to me directly.
  There was a potential there to take some of the power back, how ever tiny.
  But I am so sad. 
�I am here, David�, I whispered into the receiver. 
�Hey, Helen!!� David's voice was loud in my ear. I closed my eyes again. David.
  I am so sad. I am so happy. So sad. 
He sounded genuinely happy to hear me. David who pissed on me earlier that
  evening, David who ignored me for most of the time we spent together, David
  who called me a slut so many times I couldn't keep count, he sounded genuinely
  happy to hear me. 
�Just wanted to make sure you're OK, Helen. You OK?� That was a question.
  Oh, David, my sweet, sweet, caring David. 
I nodded. Then I opened my eyes. 
�Yes.� I whispered. �I am OK.� I couldn't help but smile. 
�That's cool, homie. Just making sure. You know�� He hesitated for a second,
  struggling for words. Oddly, no fresh African-American slang seemed to be coming
  into his mind. 
�I know� I said, smiling. �I know, David.� 
�Right� he said, switching to a more business-like tone. He chuckled. �Good
  to hear that. Listen, you have to check your mail before you go to bed. I have
  just sent you some of your photos.� I stopped breathing for a moment. Absent-mindedly,
  my free hand started stroking my breasts. 
�I have to admit you look fucking gorgeous on them, Helen. I am looking at
  them right now and, blimey, I am getting hard as wood.� 
I closed my eyes again. Back again. I lowered my hand, touched my shaven cunt.
  Waves of pleasure raced through my belly, up my spine, down my limbs. I suppressed
  a cry. 
�David�� I whispered. 
�You look like a complete fucking mess there, on your knees, you look ashamed,
  scared, humiliated, you look so fucking sexy I'd fuck you right now if you
  were here.� 
�David�� you cruel bastard, you sweet, sweet, vicious demon. You never fucked
  me, you never fucked me, you never fucked me I hate you I hate you I love you
  my sweet, sweet darling you know me so well, you know me better than I ever
  knew myself. 
�OK, OK, a figure of speech, OK. But really, you have to see them before you
  go to bed. I know you'll love them. Fuck, man, I'm willing to bet you'll get
  so hot just looking at yourself there, you'll probably be forced to masturbate
  right there. I mean, I know just how fucking horny you are.� 
Oh, David, my David. My sweet, sweet , cruel monster. 
I started fingering my cunt. Faster and faster. 
�David� I whispered. �I have a confession to make.� My breathing got faster. 
David's laughter was my reward and my punishment. 
�You are already masturbating, eh?� he said and then I heard him laugh some
  more. Was it a cruel, vicious, sarcastic laughter or a joyful, good natured
  one? �That's so predictable, you know.� 
�Yes�� I said. I held the receiver so close to my mouth that I felt he could
  almost read my mind. He knew. He knew me well. �I have nothing on, David. I
  am completely naked, just for you.� 
�For me, eh? Aw, that's flattering. Please, go on.� I could hear David positioning
  himself more comfortably on his sofa. 
�When you phoned�� I stopped there and gave my clit a little rub. A small,
  barely audible yelp escaped my lips. 
�Yes?� His voice also slipped into a deep murmur that always makes me so horny. 
�I was in the bathroom, yes, but I wasn't having a shower.� 
�You weren't having a shower, eh? Curious�� 
�No, I wasn't.� I took a deep breath. This was just a game now. No winners,
  no losers, just a game. �I was on the floor, on my back, naked, my legs up
  in the air. I was squeezing my tits and fucking myself with my fingers.� 
�So you did, eh? I imagined you'd do something like that this evening. You're
  such a horny bitch, Helen.� 
The game. He called me a horny bitch. He was masturbating too. I knew he was.
  He was squeezing his cock right there on his sofa, wanking with his eyes on
  fire, listening to me describe the thoughts going through my head a few minutes
  before. 
�I imagined you were there, sweetie. I imagined you were there, my legs up
  on your shoulders, your cock so hard and beautiful. I imagined you ramming
  it up my wet, hungry cunt.� 
�� bitch!!� reiterated David after a few seconds of contemplation. I could
  hear a small note of insanity and a small note of admiration in his voice. 
�Oh, God, David, yes, I am such a bitch. I am such a horny bitch. You should
  see my cunt now, David. I am so horny, it's gotten so wet and it's open, David,
  I am open like some street whore, awaiting your cock.� 
�That's nice, go on, go on, you know you're not getting my cock in there.
  How are you gonna deal with it?� You cruel, cruel bastard. 
I took a deep breath. My head was spinning. 
�I'm fucking myself with three fingers, David, just for you. I am fucking
  myself as we speak, baby, I am so horny.� 
�Three fingers, eh?� David adjusted the phone and his voice continued even
  louder in my ear. �If you're so open as you claim, slut, you should be able
  to fit at least four fingers in there, if not all five. I suggest you make
  an effort.� I could hear him breathe harder and harder as he was speaking.
  I could picture him wanking over there. 
�I'm scared, David. I don't know if they will fit.� I took all three fingers
  out of my cunt and examined them. They were covered with sticky, shiny mucus.
  I put my little finger together with the others. �Oh, my God David� I exclaimed
  as I started shoving the four fingers in, �I am so scared, this is too big
  for me.� 
�Grow some fucking spine, bitch. I am not here to hear about your inner fears.
  Let's see them fingers fuck that cunt of yours.� His rude words made me even
  hotter. I got my left leg up, put my toes on the chair, making the access to
  my cunt easier. I wished I was wearing my slut shoes. That would have made
  me even hotter � completely naked, in high heels, fucking myself for David. 
�Oh, God, David� I panted, �My God, it hurts. My God, David!!� 
�Are they in? Eh? Tell me, bitch!!!� 
�Yes� Oh, God, yes, they are in, David, my God� it hurts.� 
�How many? Eh, tell me, how many fingers do you have up your fucking cunt,
  bitch? Do I have to ask you about each and every little detail?� 
�I have�� I pushed the fingers a little deeper. It did hurt. But I didn't
  mind. I needed this. I needed my cunt fucked, stretched, hurt like this. �I
  have four fingers up my cunt, David, I have four fingers up my dirty, horny
  cunt and I am shoving my thumb in, I need my thumb in there too.� 
�Damn right you do, bitch. You fucking need a fist in there, you fucking,
  dirty slut. I should have pissed in your mouth back there, you would have loved
  it so much! I should have made you swallow all that piss.� 
His words. It was his words, not my fingers in my cunt. It was his words what
  made me cum there. The words, what made step over the line, push my fingers
  in deeper than they ever were and cum for the third time that evening, living
  through the men's room humiliation all over again, the images, the sounds,
  the touch, taste and smell all clashing in my mind in mere seconds. The humiliation
  I lived through, reinforced through the humiliation of talking about it with
  David, telling him how horny it made me, admitting to masturbating before he
  called, then masturbating together with the man who introduced me to the shame
  I never knew before. I reinterpreted the men's room scene in my mind all over
  again and my mind hijacked it and added images that were not there originally.
  Images of David pissing in my mouth. Images of David fucking me from the rear
  as the man in the blue jumpsuit who'd walked in shoved his fat cock in my mouth.
  Static images of no name of me being chained to the wall, whipped, tortured,
  raped repeatedly, impregnated, fucked, raped. That is what made me cum, as
  I screamed and shouted in orgasm, the spasms in my belly tearing me apart,
  the liquid fire in my spine making me arch my back as if I was tortured by
  electricity. I came for the third time that evening, David not even being in
  the same room with me any of the times. 
I love you David. I love you. I am so sad. You make me so happy. I love you.
