�������������������� REVERSAL OF FORTUNE

&nbsp;

���������������������������� by

&nbsp;

����������������������� C. Lakewood

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

��� The smartly dressed young woman strode
nonchalantly through 

the outer office
and into Dean Malcolm Heywood's inner sanctum 

without a
by-your-leave or even a perceptible hesitation.�
As she 

passed, the
dean's secretary, looked up, startled, and opened her 

mouth to object,
then closed it again and shrugged.� Dr.
Barbara 

Lang was slated
to take over as dean in a few days, and there was 

no point in
making waves.

&nbsp;

��� Relishing her impending triumph -- another
big step up the 

career ladder --
the dean-designate gazed about the spacious, 

mahogany-paneled
room, so redolent of savoir faire.� But
she was 

not totally happy
with what she saw.� Drawing herself up to
her 

full height
(5'9&quot; in heels), she addressed the dean in a phoney, 

saccharine tone.

&nbsp;

��� &quot;Afternoon, Mal.� You haven't even STARTED packing up yet?� 

It won't take me
long to get completely up to speed, but I WOULD 

like to settle in
ASAP...and, since your offical duties don't 

amount to much
anymore....&quot; 

&nbsp;

��� &quot;Mmmm...I understand that, but I have,
in fact, managed to 

keep fairly
busy.� Research....&quot;� He paused.�
&quot;I really hadn't 

planned on
retiring so soon, but perhaps I am too old to function 

well in these
times.� I don't think, for example, that
civilized 

adults should
address their superiors familiarly unless invited 

to do so -- or,
indeed, barge into private offices unannounced 

and without even
knocking....� But I am pleased that you
did 

drop
by.&quot;� He picked up a manila folder
from his desk.� &quot;I was 

looking over your
official r�sum�.� Exemplary.� National Honor 

Society and high
school diploma at age 16, Phi Beta Kappa at 

18 -- and those
degrees: Bryn Mawr B.A. (Magna Cum Laude) at 

19, Chicago M.A.
at 20, Harvard Ph.D. at 22 -- an assistant 

professorship at
Stanford, and then leaving there to come here....� 

Yes, except for
that curious final item, it's a r�sum� of which 

its owner can
certainly be proud.� He slid the folder
across to 

his visitor.� &quot;Of course, yoU aren't the real owner,
are you, 

'Barbara'?&quot;

&nbsp;

��� Stupified, she blanched and began
stammering.

&nbsp;

��� He held up his hand.� &quot;Please don't try to deny it.� I have 

photographs and
fingerprints -- all of which will hold up in 

court very
nicely.� And, we can get DNA evidence if
there's still 

even a scintilla
of doubt (which there won't be).� It's
obvious 

that you're
guilty of identity theft...and possibly murder.&quot;

&nbsp;

��� &quot;Not MURDER!� It was an accident, I swear.� On vacation...an 

allergic
reaction...anaphylactic shock.� I didn't
kill her...just 

switched
purses....� It was....&quot;

&nbsp;

��� Heywood made a dismissive gesture.� &quot;I'm not concerned with 

the details,
though I'm sure the police will be.&quot;

&nbsp;

��� B-but, I didn't hurt her...just seized my
chance.� I'd been a 

very good
student, with pretty good prospects, but she was truly 

extraordinary.� Her future was bright...and assured....&quot;

&nbsp;

��� He shook his head.� &quot;It doesn't matter.&quot;� 

&nbsp;

��� Everything having collapsed, she gathered
herself to make 

a run for it, but
he spoke up, saying, &quot;And don't think about 

attempting to
flee -- your purse is no longer in your desk, 

and your car is
no longer in the parking lot.&quot;

&nbsp;

��� &quot;Please!� I-I....&quot;

&nbsp;

��� He leaned back and steepled his
fingers.� &quot;But I must also 

think of the
college's reputation.� We might avoid a
scandal...IF 

you agree to be
treated like the arrogant and treacherous tramp 

you really are --
instead of the responsible academic you have 

been masquerading
as.� Of course, you'll also have to give
up your 

stolen
identity...AND your 'ill-gotten gains,' as it were.&quot;

&nbsp;

��� &quot;But she was buried as me.&quot;

&nbsp;

��� &quot;You will, naturally, need yet another
identity.� That can be 

arranged.� And I won't inform the police or any of the
references 

in this
supposititious r�sum�.� In return, you
will resign at once, 

and I'll place
you in the custody of...well, let's call her a 

'tutor.'&quot;� 

&nbsp;

��� &quot;Tutor?&quot;

&nbsp;

��� &quot;She's an intelligent, no-nonsense
young lady.� She will 

provide you a
place to stay for a while.� If you mind
your 

manners and
improve your behavior, it won't be long -- only 

until we can tidy
up your affairs -- likely not much more 

than a
month.� When business is concluded (and
she's satisfied 

that you are at
least minimally repentant), she'll give you new 

ID, some money,
and a job referral.� Then you'll be free
to go 

your own
way...anywhere but here.� So, which path
do you prefer?&quot;� 

His hand moved
toward the phone on his desk. 

&nbsp;

��� &quot;I-I'll...submit.&quot;

&nbsp;

��� He nodded.�
&quot;Very well.� I've taken the
liberty of drawing up 

your
resignation...for unspecified 'personal reasons.'� Just sign 

there....� Yes.�
And now this power of attorney, so that your 

assets can be
liquidated properly....&quot;

&nbsp;

��� &quot;Power of attorney?� Oh, I'd have to think about that.&quot;

&nbsp;

��� He shrugged and reached for the phone.� &quot;Of course.� You can 

think about it
from your jail cell.&quot;

&nbsp;

��� &quot;No!�
Wait!� There...I signed it.&quot; 

&nbsp;

��� He made a brief, cryptic phone call and
then drove her across 

town to a seedy,
deserted playground.� After a few
minutes, a 

yellow van
arrived and parked nearby.� A dark woman
in sweatshirt 

and jeans got
out; she carried a ratty shopping bag.

&nbsp;

��� &quot;That's your 'tutor,'&quot; Heywood
said.� Her name's Rosie Toler; 

she's part
Latina, part black, and part who-knows-what.�
She's an 

experienced
fighter with a short fuse.� I'd mind her,
if I were 

you, Barbie.� Oh yes, your new name is 'Barbie Goldberg.' 

&nbsp;

��� She looked stunned.� &quot;A Jewish name?&quot; 

&nbsp;

��� &quot;Yes.�
Now, out.&quot;� (&quot;What a
package,&quot; he thought.� &quot;Thief, 

imposter,
bigot...and, I suspect, a coquette, as well.&quot;)

&nbsp;

��� The two women approached each other and stopped
face to face.� 

&quot;Barbie&quot;
said something, and Rosie immediately slapped her.

&nbsp;

��� Heywood nodded and watched the two head off
toward the 

restrooms.� Rosie was a couple of inches shorter than
Barbie -- 

and apparently
much lighter -- but he knew she could handle 

herself against
far more formidable opponents.

&nbsp;

��� He sat quietly for a few minutes, thinking
pleasant thoughts.� 

At length, Rosie
reappeared.� Her bag seemed somewhat
heavier, 

now.� A moment later, he saw Barbie -- sheer pink tube
top, black 

polyester
micro-skirt, and cheap flip-flops -- the very picture of 

&quot;trailer
park trash.&quot;� It was obvious she was
braless, and, from 

the way she was
walking, probably pantyless, as well.

&nbsp;

��� Satisfied, he started his car and drove off,
without a 

backward glance.

&nbsp;

����������� ******************************

&nbsp;

��� Rosie easily impressed upon Barbie (with
the aid of a strap) 

that she should
accept her reversal of fortune.� There
wasn't any 

way to escape --
she no longer possessed money, checkbook, credit 

cards, ID, phone,
or car.� And she had no clothes, other
than 

those provided
for her: everything cheap and trashy, most of it 

much more
appropriate for someone years younger and several social 

strata
lower.� Not that the appearance of her
clothes was of much 

immediate
concern.� Barbie spent virtually all her
time naked.��� 

&nbsp;

��� She also spent hours every day working out
-- aerobics, 

treadmill,
stationary bike -- and toiling at a long list of 

recurring
household chores, all of which she was expected to 

do under STRICT
supervision.� 

&nbsp;

����������� ******************************

&nbsp;

��� So, for a while, she did hard labor.� She went to sleep each 

night exhausted
and woke up...extremely horny, for some reason.

But, being
intelligent and adaptable, she quickly learned to 

submit without
seeming too resentful.

&nbsp;

��� It was, of course, an act.� She was seething inside.

&nbsp;

��� (&quot;Damn mongrel bitch!� I don't deserve this!� I was only 

trying to better
myself.� Nothing wrong with that.� Prissy Barbara 

Lang had always
had it too easy, and then she just died.�
Not my 

fault.� But it was time that I got a taste.� Who could truly blame 

me?� I'm not really a bad person, just tired of
seeing others get 

all the
breaks.� That goddamn bastard
Heywood....� What right did 

he have to stick
his long nose into my business?� And
this...this 

squinty-eyed,
slave-driving bitch...probably a goddamn dyke....&quot;)� 

&nbsp;

��� Later on, Barbie was taught how to prance
and shimmy and bump 

and grind....

&nbsp;

��� After 44 days of this regimen, she was
declared &quot;free&quot; and 

allowed to
dress.� She was sent on her way, with a
new ID card, 

a dollar bill,
the address of a strip club said to be expecting 

her, and a small
canvas bag with some clothes and toiletries. 

&nbsp;

��� She didn't look back.

&nbsp;

����������� ****************************** 

&nbsp;

��� It was named &quot;The Rat Hole.&quot;� She felt defiled just by walking 

into the place,
but she knew she had little choice.�
She'd been 

warned and didn't
dare subject her fake ID to much more than casual 

scrutiny.� She knew a place like &quot;The Rat
Hole&quot; wouldn't be nearly 

as picky as even
the average fast food joint, and, without a r�sum� 

or references,
those were her only chances for employment.�
In 

fact, without
better ID, she couldn't even get welfare.�
Besides, 

here she had a
&quot;referral&quot; (whatever THAT might realistically mean).� 

So, at length,
she found herself standing slightly pigeon-toed in 

front of the desk
of one Otto Triandos, manager of the club, and 

feeling rather
like an errant schoolgirl sent to the principal. 

&nbsp;

��� The office was suitably grim.� Under foot was a threadbare 

rug over faded
lineoleum.� The drab walls were plastered
with 

old posters,
magazine centerfolds, and photos of dancers and 

pornstars.� The atmosphere reeked of cigar smoke, cheap
liquor, 

garlic, and B.O.

&nbsp;

��� The big man behind the desk was all jowls
and boredom.� 

He looked a lot
like Broderick Crawford. 

&nbsp;

��� &quot;Whatcha want?&quot; he growled,
barely giving her a glance.� 

He went back to
idly flipping through a dog-eared issue of 

&quot;Hustler.&quot;

&nbsp;

��� &quot;Mr. Triandos, s-sir...I was told you
might h-hire me....&quot;

It took some
effort to suppress the quaver in her voice.�
&quot;My 

name's...Barbie
G-goldberg.&quot; 

&nbsp;

��� &quot;So what?&quot;

&nbsp;

��� &quot;So...so I need a job...sir.&quot;

&nbsp;

��� He looked at her more closely now.� Despite her clothes, 

there was a
certain...something...about her.� (The
first 

term that had
occurred to him was &quot;prude,&quot; and that was true, 

but it was more
than that.� She stood too straight, her
accent 

was too highbrow,
her expression was too disapproving....�
If 

his active
vocabulary had been larger, he might have termed 

her
&quot;prim,&quot; &quot;vain,&quot; &quot;self-absorbed,&quot; and
&quot;disdainful.&quot;� Yet, 

he did have her
character pegged, even if he didn't have all 

the right words
to describe it.� He also recognized that,
over 

all, she had an
air of desperation.� It was an
interesting 

combination....� And all of it could be of value.)

� 

��� &quot;Yeah, maybe....� We can allus use new girls....� You're not 

bad
lookin'...tits okay, legs good....� But
you jus' don' seem 

like the type,
honey.&quot;

&nbsp;

��� She felt herself getting red.� 

&nbsp;

��� &quot;No!�
I-I COULD be....� I c-could
be...um...anything you 

wanted me to
be.� I do really need a job, Mr. Triandos.


Please.&quot; 

&nbsp;

��� He shrugged and passed her a pen and an
application form.

&quot;Maybe.� Sit.�
Fill this out.&quot;� He returned
to his magazine.

&nbsp;

��� Filling out the form was quick enough.� Name, sex, age 

(31), SSN (from
the bogus ID), hair (auburn), eyes (hazel), 

vitals (5'6&quot;
138lbs 35C-26-36), marital status (divorced, 

� la her cover
story), no illnesses, no allergies, no criminal 

record, education
(out-of-state high school, nothing beyond), 

no address, no
phone, no job history.� Her degrees, honors,


experience, and
accomplishments had been buried with Barbara 

Lang.� 

&nbsp;

��� Triandos looked it over and sniffed.� &quot;Pretty thin.� You 

runnin' from the
cops?� Some kinds of trouble don' matter;


some do.&quot;

&nbsp;

��� &quot;N-no, sir, I swear!&quot;� She hoped her prepared story would 

sound plausible
enough.� &quot;I've been a h-housewife
since high 

school, b-but I'm
divorced now and broke, with nowhere to turn....&quot;�� 

&nbsp;

��� &quot;Maybe.� There's some questions I need to ask that
ain't on 

the
application.� Had sex with men,
right?&quot;

&nbsp;

��� &quot;Yes.&quot;

&nbsp;

��� He squinted at her, and there was an
awkward pause that 

stretched out
longer and longer until it finally dawned on 

her what he was
waiting for.

&nbsp;

��� &quot;Um...yes, sir.&quot;

&nbsp;

��� He nodded.�
&quot;With women?&quot;

&nbsp;

��� &quot;No, sir.&quot;

&nbsp;

��� &quot;Animals?&quot;

&nbsp;

��� &quot;N-no, sir!&quot;

&nbsp;

��� &quot;Oral?&quot;

&nbsp;

��� &quot;Yes, sir....� But not often.&quot;

&nbsp;

��� (&quot;Twice,&quot; she thought.� &quot;And that was TOO often.� Of course, 

both times there
was something I wanted out of it...and I got 

it.� Oh, god!�
And now I want this job...desperately.&quot;)

&nbsp;

��� &quot;Anal?&quot;

&nbsp;

��� &quot;No, sir.&quot;� (&quot;Asshole!&quot;)

&nbsp;

��� He looked thoughtful.� &quot;You say you could be ANYTHING we 

want you to be,
yeah?&quot;

&nbsp;

��� &quot;Yes, sir.� I'd work real hard, Mr. Triandos.� I....&quot;

&nbsp;

��� &quot;Stand up.� Show me whatcha got.&quot;

&nbsp;

��� She stood up.� 

&nbsp;

��� (&quot;When that Rosie bitch told me the
name of this place, I 

was afraid of
what might happen, and then, when I first saw it, 

I just KNEW it
would come to this.� From Dean-Designate
to strip 

club
slut....� God! �That pig is so loathesome!� I ought to spit 

in his ugly
face...but I'm out of options.� I just
CAN'T become 

a bag lady or a
street hooker.� The 'Rat Hole' might not
be much, 

but it's better
than that.&quot;)

��� 

��� She took off her clothes, mechanically.� It didn't take long.� 

She kicked off
her flip-flops, slithered out of the tube top and 

dropped her
miniskirt -- and was naked.

&nbsp;

��� &quot;Hmmmm.� Nice nips.�
And it's good you're shaved.�
Lotsa guys 

like
that.&quot;� 

&nbsp;

��� (&quot;Shit!� That fucking Rosie Toler MADE me shave.� My nipples 

are so goddamn
stiff!� What's the matter with me?� I've actually 

got to beg this
cretin for a chance to-to...strut my stuff for 

strangers.&quot;)

&nbsp;

��� &quot;Please, sir....� Just give me a chance to show you, Mr. 

Triandos.&quot; 

&nbsp;

��� &quot;O-kay, you got a audition.� If the payin' customers like 

you, you got a
job.� You'd be a part-time trainee; 37
hours a 

week.� We'd pay you less than minimum -- but you'd
get to keep 

half of what you
make doin' lap dances, hustlin' drinks, and 

turnin'
tricks....� You'd live
upstairs.&quot;� 

&nbsp;

��� He pushed himself back from the desk.

&nbsp;

��� &quot;Before you go out there, though, I
gotta try you out...test 

your 'work
ethic,' honey.&quot;� He chuckled.� &quot;So get down here and 

suck me off.� Do what's called a 'bad girl blow
job'...lotsa spit 

and
enthusism.� Slurp it up.� Moan.�
Make me believe you jus' LOVE 

doin' it.� Make it last for a while.� And, when I cum, you swallow 

it all,
understand?&quot;� 

&nbsp;

��� She understood.

&nbsp;

��� She knelt in front of him, unzipped his
pants, and nervously 

extracted his
half-hard prick.� It smelled
awful...musty and 

over-ripe...but
it didn't taste TOO bad.� She followed
his 

instructions,
slurping and moaning in what she hoped was a 

good enough
imitation of passion.� When it was over,
when she 

had swallowed the
last vile gulp of his cum, she sat back on 

her heels,
feeling completely debased.

&nbsp;

��� &quot;You ain't through yet, babe.� You gotta lick it clean, kiss 

it like you love
it, and put it back.� And do it gentle....&quot;

&nbsp;

��� She'd been wrong before.� She was just beginning to learn to 

depths of
debasement.

&nbsp;

��� Triandos pressed a button on his
intercom.� &quot;Get Miranda in 

here.&quot;

&nbsp;

��� A moment later, the door opened and
&quot;Miranda&quot; entered.� She 

might have been
Rosie Toler's bigger, meaner, and less refined 

sister.� She looked like the same indeterminate racial
mix and 

had the same
caf�-au-lait skin...virtually all of which was on 

display, since
she was naked, except for a red garter around 

her right thigh.

&nbsp;

��� She was scowling, but not at Triandos.

&nbsp;

��� &quot;Miranda, this here's...uh...'Barbie
Goldberg.'� She goes on 

next.� Get her squared away.&quot;� He fetched a red garter from his 

desk drawer and
tossed it to Barbie.� &quot;That's your
costume.&quot;�� �

&nbsp;

��� And so, his &quot;Human Relations&quot;
duties having been taken care 

of for the
moment, he went back to his magazine.�� 

�

��� (Naked?�
I have to dance totally NAKED?)

&nbsp;

��� Miranda was saying something snarly, but
Barbie couldn't make 

much sense out of
it.� Her mind was spinning and her body
starting 

to sweat as
Miranda propelled her along the corridor.�
&quot;Put your 

garter on,
bitch,&quot; the big dancer ordered.�
(She did understand 

THAT.)� 

�

��� &quot;No, yours goes on the LEFT leg.&quot;

&nbsp;

��� Just before they reached the curtains stage
right, they passed 

another nude
girl, her hair in pig-tails, heading in the opposite 

direction.� There was a moment of silence.� Then the PA crackled, 

&quot;And now,
please welcome our newest.� Bar-bie
Gold-berg!&quot;

&nbsp;

�� �Barbie barely had time to recognize the tune
that started up 

-- &quot;Girls
Just Want To Have Fun&quot; -- when she was thrust roughly 

out onto the
small stage.���������� 

�

��� There weren't many customers in the place
that early in the 

day, but what
there were, she despised.� Swarthy lower
class 

types, barely
above the homeless -- very &quot;ethnic,&quot; with cheap, 

sweat-stained
clothing, facial stubble, bad teeth, and coarse 

voices....� The emotional combination -- her loathing of
her 

audience, her
embarrassment at being on stage naked, and her 

fear of screwing
up and losing even this crappy job -- had her 

practically
paralyzed.� 

�

��� She took a couple of tentative steps toward
the brass pole 

up front, then
froze.� She was supposed to know some moves,
ones 

Rosie had taught
her, but her mind had blanked and her body was 

zombified.

&nbsp;

��� The customers were pleased at first at the
sight of fresh meat, 

but their
patience ran out quickly, and they were becoming restive 

(abusive would be
next) at Barbie's inaction, when Miranda suddenly 

swept onto the
stage with a formidable switch in her hand -- and 

began using it on
Barbie's butt.� The audience, usually
rather 

blas� at this
hour, responded with genuine enthusiasm, real 

applause -- and,
by the end, more than a few dollar bills.�
Miranda 

pranced Barbie
around the stage for twenty minutes, winding up 

by forcing her to
hump the brass pole until she orgasmed...twice.�


&nbsp;

��� And a new act was born that day on stage at
The Rat Hole -- one 

that would be
repeated often, by popular demand. 

&nbsp;

��� (And they shared the cheers and applause,
though Miranda kept 

all the money.)

&nbsp;

��� Afterward, even Triandos looked as pleased
as he was capable 

of.� &quot;O-kay.�
You two done pretty good.� Guess
you're a team...so 

you can be
room-mates, too.&quot;

&nbsp;

��� (He'd be looking in on them later --
through the CCTV in their 

room -- and,
knowing Miranda, didn't expect he'd be disappointed.)

�

��� &quot;Miranda, you fill her in on her other
duties, and make sure 

you keep her in
line, now.� Okay, scat!&quot; 

&nbsp;

��� Barbie spent the rest of the day primarily
hustling drinks and 

performing as an
apprentice lap dancer, with occasional turns on 

the stage (during
which she got her ass and thighs thoroughly 

switched
again).� In addition, she turned two
tricks....

&nbsp;

��� In the small hours of the morning, when she
was finally allowed 

to drag her weary
carcass off to bed, she quickly learned that 

she'd be sleeping
that night (and for the foreseeable future) with 

her face between
Miranda's thighs.� Triandos had asked
several 

questions earlier
regarding her sexual experience.� Viewing
the 

tape, he made a
mental that one of her answers was no longer true.� 

&nbsp;

For starters.

&nbsp;

����������� ****************************** �

��� 

��� Four months passed.� It was mid-autumn, and the year was dying. 

Barbie was firmly
in the grip of an apathetic inertia.� She
hated 

what she was
doing, feared her bosses, and loathed her clientele.� 

But she couldn't
see a way out.� So far, she'd managed to
hide only 

$57 from her
greedy co-workers, and she'd need a lot more getaway 

money than
that.� Clothes, transportation, reliable
ID, basic 

living expenses,
a cash reserve -- all that would add up....�
But 

she was finding
it easier anymore to just be a &quot;Rat Hole&quot; girl...to 

wake up with the
pungent taste of cunt in her mouth and go to bed 

with the
lingering, musty taste of prick...and, in between, to 

prance and coo
and hustle drinks and turn tricks....�
Oh, god!� It 

was better than
the alternatives, better than prison or the 

streets, she told
herself.� She could still dream, though,
and 

she dreamed of
someday, somehow crashing out.� Those
dreams, 

however, were now
beginning to get a bit shop-worn, and sometimes 

she had difficulty
convincing even herself that she'd ever get 

back to anything
like the good life she'd once had.���� 

�� 

��� And then, an implausible white knight
appeared.� He was a 

short, plump,
middle-aged, Buddha-esque Oriental, inscrutable, 

but with a
polite, almost deferential manner.� He
introduced 

himself as
&quot;Mr. Soong,&quot; and seemed content to pay lap dance 

prices just for
conversation with her.� 

&nbsp;

��� Barbie was captivated by the man.� Finally, someone civilized 

in that
dump...mannerly and perceptive enough to appreciate her 

for her
mind.� (He also seemed to be quite
well-to-do...maybe even 

rich.� He owned some sort of import-export
business.)

&nbsp;

��� She began to perk up, to increasingly
resemble her old self -- 

that is, the
woman she'd been as Barbara Lang -- cool, crisp, 

confident,
articulate....

&nbsp;

��� They talked about everything -- literature,
history, current 

events, political
theory, taste and manners, music, theatre, 

architecture --
though, in fact, she did most of the talking 

while he
listened, spell-bound.� (Seemingly, at
least.� Though 

he wasn't
married, Mr. Soong had the ability that most husbands 

eventually
develop of appearing to be absorbed in listening to a 

woman babble,
while actually thinking of other, more pleasant 

and/or more
important things.) 

&nbsp;

��� She was devastated when, after barely a
week, he told her that 

his business
there was concluding and that he'd be heading home 

to the Far
East.� But then he invited her to come
with him.� He 

scoffed at her
lack of a passport.� Laying a finger
beside his 

nose, he reminded
her that he was experienced in importing and 

exporting -- and
in circumventing officialdom.� And he
promised 

to give her a
life filled with everything that she truly deserved.

&nbsp;

��� Yet another reversal of fortune!� This time, light at the end 

of a long, dark
tunnel.� 

&nbsp;

��� She accepted, of course.

&nbsp;

����������� ******************************

&nbsp;

��� &quot;Well, whadaya think, Mr. Soong?&quot;
Otto Triandos asked, already 

sure of the answer.

&nbsp;

��� &quot;You have surpassed yourself this
time, Otto.� The woman is 

quite
amazing....� So pretentious, so
delusional.� A self-absorbed, 

would-be
bluestocking...and so supercilious a snob that I sometimes 

fear her eyebrows
will disappear into her hairline.&quot;

&nbsp;

��� Triandos, sensing that this last was some
sort of joke, 

chuckled.� &quot;Well, she's adaptable.&quot;

&nbsp;

��� Mr. Soong inclined his head.� &quot;Not TOO adaptable, I hope.� She 

is perfect as she
is.� I expect we can curb her
adaptability to 

a sufficient
extent to preserve her marketability.&quot;�
He made a 

dismissive
gesture.� &quot;It should not be an
insurmountable problem.&quot;

&nbsp;

��� Otto blinked.� Mr. Soong was a good guy, but talking with
him 

for any length of
time tended to give you a headache.� More
out of 

courtesy than
real curiosity, he asked, &quot;So...where'll you send 

her?� Manila?�
Bangkok?&quot;

&nbsp;

��� &quot;Hong Kong first, for
'processing.'� From there....&quot;� Mr. Soong 

shrugged.� He handed Triandos a thick envelope.� &quot;I have included 

a substantial bonus,
Otto.� Well done.&quot;

&nbsp;

��� They shook hands.� Mr. Soong then resumed his mask of 

inscrutability
and left to collect his latest export.

&nbsp;

��� Otto yawned and opened a magazine.
