INTERNET VICTIM

&nbsp;

I am still� not exactly
sure when the idea came to me. Maybe about six months before, when we were
chatting on the internet, maybe even before that, before I had even met her
there. Maybe she was not even the original target, as I had been looking at
houses for years, thinking how good a dungeon the basement would make, and
whether it could be soundproofed easily.

&nbsp;

I had even taken
college courses on bricklaying and sound engineering, long before I had first
logged onto the internet that day, and had found my true need,,or at least the answer to it.

&nbsp;

It had still
amazed me how easily I had been able to pull it off, even here, in a foreign
country, it had been easy.� I had. I
suppose, been drawn to the States by all the films and televisions shows, where
kidnapping had been all to easy,� I
watched hundreds of films and shows depicting kidnapping, to see if I could
discover the pitfalls, and the easy ways to do it.� I watched enthralled as helpless women were
dragged off, kicking and screaming, only for the kidnapper to be found in the
last reel. For the most part this was because the kidnapper was known to the
woman, or he had been seen in the areas days or hours before.

&nbsp;

I was determined
not to make this mistake, and began planning carefully.

&nbsp;

My first task was
a four month let in an area where I had discovered my internet friend lived,
and paid for the let through a bank, all legitimate. I even used my own name,
and came and went without raising� any eyebrows. But from my apartment I
had a perfect view of my intended victim's home, and the hidden camera and
video recorder I had set up kept a never ending vigil on her.

&nbsp;

At the end of the
let I left, even leaving a forwarding address, and then sending mail to my old
address knowing that it would be sent back to me at my new home.� For three months I sent mail, until I stopped
receiving it, the forwarding address either being forgotten, or at the very
least, ignored.

&nbsp;

During this time
I watched the videos and studied the pictures, and had a great understanding of
my victim. 

&nbsp;

I still spoke to
her regularly on the internet, and knew she had still no new man in her life
since her divorce, a nasty affair that had warned her off physical contact ever
since, even though I and others had suggested she get back in to the fray. But
she was happy alone, and was making no efforts to meet anyone.

&nbsp;

Using a different
name I had made arrangements to meet her on three occasions, but she had cried
off at the last minute, telling me she was still not ready.

&nbsp;

And so, after
months of painstaking deliberations and planning, my plan was ready to be put
in motion.

&nbsp;

I chose a Friday
night for the abduction, knowing that apart from her internet friends, she
would not be missed until Monday at the earliest. Using� knowledge I had gained from a hacker
back in Britain, I was soon able to discover her password, and during the
Friday I went on line as her, and told everyone that she was going away for the
weekend, and would be off line. Many of her friends wished me a pleasant weekend,
though some were convinced that she was keeping a secret date and didn't want
to admit it.

&nbsp;

Singing off. I deliberately logged off in such a way that they could all read her id on the log out the first
part of the plan done, and a success. The next part was to damage her computer.
Not physically, but just enough to stop her gaining access to the internet, and
talking to friends who already believed she was gone for the weekend. This
would mean a visit to her home, and the first dangerous element, but a
necessary thing, though once inside, I would not be leaving without her.

&nbsp;

I chose midday to
go to her home, as there were always so many people around, and even though I
had been away for a while, my face would not be out of place there, and within
minutes of arriving in the area, I was safe in her home. A quick check through
the window showed me that there was no one pointing in my direction, and even Mrs McCarthy, the area busybody, was not on the phone to
the Police reporting an intruder.

&nbsp;

Quickly I switched
on her computer and let it load, before removing the ini
file for her internet connection, without which, she could not get on line.Before deleting it, I copied the file to disk, so I
could replace it later, so that if anyone else checked, they would get straight
on line, and decide that it really was her that had told everyone she was going
to be away.� My last task on the computer
was to copy the log from the morning's chat to her own logs, so that it would look
as if she herself had made the call.

&nbsp;

Satisfied, I
closed the computer and switched off, smiling to myself as the second part of
the plan was executed perfectly. Now all I had to do was wait,
and another few hours after so many months of planning was to be no problem.

&nbsp;

I looked at my
watch. Five fifteen. Another ten minutes and she would be here. I quickly moved
all evidence of my visit, and went into the spare room, from where I could see
her when she entered the bathroom. Almost as soon as I closed the spare room
door, I heard the key in the front door, and again looked at my watch. Five
twenty five, she was as predictable as always. I knew the first thing she would
do would be check her email, but had allowed her the same amount of time to try
to sort out her connection problem, and within a minute or two of that, she was
an her way to the bathroom, and phase three was ready to be put in motion.

&nbsp;

Covered by the
sound of the shower I moved to her computer, and replaced the missing file,
tempted to switch it off, but as she had left it on, I left it that way, just
in case she spotted it off from the corner of her eye as she moved to the
bedroom, to where I moved now myself.

&nbsp;

I heard her turn
the water off, and stood behind the bedroom door, sure I could not be seen in
the dresser mirror, and poured some of the ether onto a cloth, and waited.

&nbsp;

As she entered
the room I grabbed her quickly, and placed the cloth over her mouth and nose,
holding her tightly to me, waiting for her to go limp in my hands. For a few
minutes she struggled, but the ether soon took it's
toll, and she began to sink into my arms. Gently I lowered her to the ground,
and kept the cloth over her mouth to make sure she was not faking, until I was
satisfied that she was not. 

&nbsp;

My next job was
to tie her up, her wrists behind her, her ankles together, and a gag in her
mouth in case she woke up before I was ready for her. As an afterthought I also
added a blindfold, though later on I would want her to see me, when I was
satisfied that she would be able to do no harm with this knowledge.� When she was in my dungeon and secure.

&nbsp;

I waited until
the light began to fade, and carried my victim through the interconnecting door
to the garage, and placed her into the boot of the car, securing it before
returning to her home for the last part of the abduction.

&nbsp;

Quickly� I grabbed the bag
I had prepared earlier, with a selection of her clothes, the sort of thing she
would take for a weekend, and then donned a wig matching her own hair colour, and her jacket that she had taken off when she had
returned from work, and headed back to the car.

&nbsp;

As I drove out of
the garage I spotted Mrs McCarthy, and waved at her,
knowing she would remember seeing my victim driving herself out of the
driveway, and off up the road.

&nbsp;

The first part of
the drive was over an hour, and after about half an hour I pulled into a dark
area and checked on my victim. She was awake, and moving about, but by now
there was nothing she could do.� I smiled
at her unseeing eyes, and closed the boot again, and drove off.� My own car was in a basement lockup, and as I
neared the street was deserted, as I had expected it to be.

&nbsp;

Quickly I drove
into the basement, and opened the boot to my own car, then her boot. As a I helped her from the boot I whispered that her life
depended on doing as she was told, and that meant making no noise, even though
I knew that the gag would soak up almost any sound she made. I just wanted her
to be more frightened of calling for help than she was of what was happening to
her.

&nbsp;

Within minutes I
had her secured in my car, and was cleaning all traces of myself from hers. I
made sure that there was no fingerprints of mine
anywhere, and even swept out the drivers floor with a small hand brush to
remove any dirt that may have come from my shoes, then locked her car, and got
into my own.

&nbsp;

Within another
minute I was off again, the wig now gone, and feeling more relaxed. The last
part of the trip was another two hour drive, and every now and then I stopped
to make sure my victim was okay, and then carried on.

&nbsp;

My home was deep
in the forest, buried in it's own grounds, and far
away from prying eyes. My deliveries had always been on a Thursday, and meant
that I would not be disturbed by the sudden appearance of any delivery men, as
I moved my victim to her new home.

&nbsp;

The move out of
the car boot into the house was simple enough, having warned her again against
the idea of trying to attract attention, as she had no idea that no matter how
loud she screamed, no one would hear it.

&nbsp;

Once in the house
I released her ankles, and helped her through the house and down the steps to
the basement. Once in the basement I moved her into her room, a cell I had
built specially for her, with metal rings built into the wall,
that would lock around her neck like a collar.� Backing her up against the wall I fastened
the ring around her, and padlocked it in place, then removed the blindfold and
gag. 

&nbsp;

As soon as the
gag was removed she opened her mouth to scream, and I smiled, as she did so.
She seemed surprised that I made no effort to stop her, until I informed her
that the basement was soundproofed, and that we were also at least five miles
from the nearest neighbours. Almost immediately, she
stopped screaming, and tears filled her eyes.

&nbsp;

Lastly I moved
her and unfastened her wrists, leaving her free of all bonds save for the metal
collar around her neck. Her hands sprung to this, and she cried again as her
fingers found the padlock, and she realised she would never open it. She was
now mine, and would remain so, and there was nothing anywhere that would tie me
to her abduction. It was only then that I remembered the last thing on my list,
and I left her there to worry, as I moved upstairs, and turned on my computer.
Going to my &quot;A&quot; drive, I entered the dos disk and typed format c:

�

This would remove
any traces of the hacking I had done earlier, and reloading my programs was not
too much of a problem, but was far better an option than letting anyone finding
the trace evidence.

&nbsp;

Now I was happy
to go and spent time with my captive, and returned to the basement. I could see
through a spyhole that she was still struggling with
the collar, and getting nowhere.

&nbsp;

I stood watching
her for a few minutes before entering the cell.

&nbsp;

&quot;Okay!&quot;, I started. &quot;This will be your new home, and you
will never be leaving here. I wish there was another way of saying that to you,
but I feel the truth will hurt less than leaving you with the illusion that
release is around the corner.&quot;

&nbsp;

As I stopped
speaking I could see her eyes flickering around the cell, probably looking for
the way out, if she could get the collar off.

&nbsp;

&quot;The collar
around your neck is made of tempered steel, and would need an oxy torch to get
off, unless you have the key, which is currently upstairs, so trying to grab me
and take it is not worth it. You will stay there within the confines of the
collar until I am ready to let you move. If you have any questions, keep them
to yourself. I am not interested, and will not answer them, You
are here for my purpose, and if that means that you will feel pain occasionally,
then so be it.Is that understood?&quot;

&nbsp;

I could see the
thousand questions flashing through her mind, but only one came out. &quot;Why me?&quot;

&nbsp;

As if to
demonstrate my ignorance of her questions, as the words left her mouth I
slapped her across the face, hard enough to sting, but not to cause real pain.
Immediately tears filled her eyes and ran down her cheeks.

&nbsp;

&quot;I told you
no questions&quot;. I told her calmly. &quot;If you cannot obey, you will not
get fed.&quot;

&nbsp;

With that comment
I turned and left the cell, closing the heavy metal door behind me, and leaving
her alone to consider her fate. I watched for a while through the spyhole, her hands immediately moving back to the padlock
on the collar, and then turned the light out, leaving her in pitch blackness
where she would stay until I decided that it was morning. Within a few days her
body clock would be a mess, and within a few weeks, she would be mine totally, her mind submissive to me.

&nbsp;

I went upstairs
and showered, then moved to the cupboard I had built to hold my new clothes,
the only things she would see me in from this time forwards. Even when she had
totally submitted to me, she would not be allowed out of the house, and would
never see her home, work or friends again. 

&nbsp;

As I dressed I
turned on the news, and tuned into her area, waiting to see if there was any
mention of her in the broadcast. Nothing!

&nbsp;

Over the next two
hours I reloaded the programs on my computer, and started back to chat with
mutual friends. One of them, Starfyre, told me that
our mutual friend had gone away for the weekend, and would be back on Monday.
Thanking her for this information, talk turned to it's
more natural subject, and I spent over three hours chatting, logging out in
such a way that they would see my id as I did so. More proof, if ever it were
needed, that I was at home that night, and that they had actually told me about
the weekend trip my victim was making.

&nbsp;

By the time I
decided to return to her, she had been alone almost six hours, and I decided it
was now morning. Turning on the lights I opened the door and wished her a good
morning, and told her the time was 0730. She looked at me and I could see the
shock in her eyes as she saw what I was wearing. Gone were the clothes of
earlier, and in their place I wore a leather vest and trousers, a studded belt
and wrist straps, and over my face a mask that would be more suited to
Halloween, black, with a flame design around the eyes and nostrils. Unless my
image was burned into her memory, this was the only impression she would have of
me.

&nbsp;

As I entered she
opened her mouth to speak, but seemed to think better of it, and closed it
without uttering a word. I handed her a bowl of cereal, and a plastic spoon,
knowing that she could feed herself, even though, by now, her legs had to be
very weak.� Hungrily she ate the cereal,
as if she had not eaten for days, instead of hours. As soon as she finished
eating I took the bowl from her, and placed it on the ground, before picking up
a belt I had designed for her. 

&nbsp;

Telling her to
stay perfectly still, I moved close to her and started to place the belt around
her waist. As I had thought, as soon as I moved in close, she raised her hand
to strike me. I acted as if I had not seen it, but at the last moment grabbed
her hand as it flew through the air, and bent her fingers back, until she
screamed out in pain. I warned her that any move she made against me would end
up in pain for her, and smiled at her with no warmth. As she dropped her hand
to her side, I returned to my task, fastening the metal belt around her waist.

&nbsp;

My captive's
waist was 24 inches, but the belt was much less, pulling hard at her, and
cutting deep into her stomach muscles as I forced it to close, and then added
the locking padlock. On either side of the belt was another metal strap, with
which to lock her hands to her side. Even though she struggled, it took little
time to lock the first wrist at her side, and another blow across the face
found her letting the second be locked with little trouble. 

&nbsp;

Once I was
satisfied that her hands were secure, and that she could not get them free, I
released the collar, and let her slip to the floor, her legs finally giving way
from under her.

&nbsp;

&quot;this belt&quot;, I said, &quot;will stay around your waist
for the foreseeable future. If your hands are secured to it, you will be
allowed to wander around the basement. If you try to get
away. I shall out you back in the collar, and you will stay there for
three days,which means your
legs will take the strain all that time. I am sure you will already have
discovered that you cannot relax your legs in the collar, as to do so would
start to strangle you.

&nbsp;

To my surprise,
she nodded.

&nbsp;

&quot;Right
then&quot;, I continued. &quot;Over the next few days you will learn that I am
to be your Master. Without me you can do nothing. You rely on me for food, and
for washing. Behaviour will earn rewards,
disobedience will earn punishment. Have no doubt about that. I WILL punish you
if you disobey. I have infinite patience, and will not tire with punishing you,
though I would rather not do, as I hate to see� whip marks on tender flesh. But
believe me, I will whip you, I will starve you and I will punish you.&quot;

&nbsp;

I turned to start
to walk away, then turned back again.

&nbsp;

&quot;One other thing. If you are thinking that you will be
found, and rescued, forget it. All on the net think you went away for the weekend, and even Mrs McCarthy
waved you off. It will be Monday before you are even missed, and there is
nothing at all to tie you in with me. As you� would have guessed, the name I use on
the net bears no relation to my own, and if the police do come here. I will
welcome them with open arms and show them around, though obviously not the
basement, and as this is not on any plans, they will not be asking to see
it.� When I� told you there was no escape, I actually
meant that there was no escape.&quot;

&nbsp;

With that I left
the cell and closed the door, watching through the spy hole as she realised
what I had said, and collapsed to the floor in tears, unable even to wipe them
away, as her hands would not reach. As I stood watching her, I did consider
letting her dress, but then dismissed this idea, As
with everything else, she would have to earn the right to wear clothes, and
that would take a long time.

&nbsp;

For the next few
days I slowly turned her night into day, and her days into night. She had cereal� when she
should have been having dinner, and dinner when she should already be long time
sleeping. When the lights were on she wore the wrists straps, and still, when
the lights were out, she was collared to the wall, forcing her to sleep on her
feet.

&nbsp;

She had stopped
any form of questioneing, after feeling the whip
twice across her ass, and reluctantly stayed silent whenever I was in her cell.
Still, though, as soon as the door closed and she was alone, the tears came.
But that would eventually stop.

&nbsp;

I had planned to
start training her the next week, and the first thing was to teach her to call
me Master.

&nbsp;

I had told her on
the first day that she was to consider me as her Master, but she had not yet
used the term. But she would, however grudgingly, she would.

&nbsp;

At the start of
the second week, I moved a cot into her cell, but told her she would have to
earn the right to use it. Until then she would spend the nights in the collar.
I could see in her eyes that she wanted to know how to earn that right, but she
did not ask. At least that was one lesson she had learned.

&nbsp;

I looked up at
her and smiled, though she did not return the smile. I told her that the cot
was hers, all she had to do to earn it, was to call me Master, and kneel everytime I entered the
room. With that I left, leaving her standing looking at the cot, so close, so
wanted, but out of reach.

&nbsp;

I stayed away for
over an hour, and when I entered the room, although she could not kneel, she
called me Master. I turned my back to her and let the smile fill my face.
Moving back to her I released the collar, and as soon as her hands were
fastened to the belt, she sank to her knees in front of me. This was enough to
tell me how much she really did want the bed, and as I left, I stopped at the
spy hole and smiled as she let herself collapse onto it, the first comfort she
had felt since she had been here

&nbsp;

I had been on the
internet everyday since she had been here, and for the first few days there was
a lot of talk about her absence, but by now she was hardly mentioned at all,
and life went on as normal.

&nbsp;

The news form her
home town was not much better. No one seemed to know where she was, and though
there had been a lot of talk when she failed to appear at work on the Monday,
and no one had been able to contact her, but now even that seemed forgotten,
and other news was taking the headlines.�
I knew, though, that she was still being looked for by the police, but I
also knew that by now I had covered my tracks carefully, and was a not a
suspect in her disappearance.

&nbsp;

On my next
journey to the cell I took with me a small pair of panties for her. they were made of a leather like material, and would cover
very little, but would still make her feel better. Almost as soon as I opened
the door she flew off the cot and sank to her knees. Not out of respect for me,
but through fear of losing the cot, and having to sleep on her feet again. 

&nbsp;

I showed her the
panties and told her to stand up. As she did so let her lift one leg and placed
the panties over one foot, and then the other, before pulling them up into
position for her. I would have liked to see her do this herself, but the cell
door was open, and if I had released her wrists I knew she would have made an
attempt to escape.

&nbsp;

Once the panties
were in place I looked at her. They did only just cover, leaving nothing to the
imagination, but allowing her a little dignity. I warned her that these were
not a right, and that any infringement would see them taken away from her, and
the cot as well. Any time she disobeyed, and everything she had been given
would go, and she would have to start over again, earning them.

&nbsp;

Her response,
though feeble in volume, was &quot;Yes Master&quot;.

&nbsp;

I smiled.

&nbsp;

It was the fifth
Friday that she first found out that I meant what I said to her. I entered the
room and it took her e minute to get to her knees.� Without a word I dragged her to the wall and
fixed the collar around her neck, then using a knife from my belt I cut through
the sides of the panties, watching them drop to the ground by her feet. Moving
quickly I went across the room and folded the cot, and pulled it out of the
room.

&nbsp;

I could see the
question in her eyes, and told her it was because she had been slow in getting
to her knees, and then left the room, leaving her to feel both sorry for
herself, and angry with me.Through the spy hole I saw
the tears, the first for some time, and knew that I had reached her. In another
week she would do anything to get her bed back.

&nbsp;

By now she had no
real idea of time, and had no idea how long she had been my prisoner. She had
not seen fresh air since I brought her here, and decided that today would be an
ideal time. When I re-entered the cell I carried with me a long chain, which I
fixed to the belt around her waist. Removing the collar I led her through the
cell door, and blindfolded her before leading her through the house and out
into the grounds.

&nbsp;

I could see her
eyes half close with the first sight of the sun in such a long time, and then
the female instinct to covet herself, though she could not do so. I led her
around the grounds on the chain, telling her to study the isolation of the
area. The grounds were quite expansive, and she could see that help would not
be easy to find.� She could also see the
barbed wire along the top of the surrounding wall, the last remains of the
security ordered by a previous occupant of the house.

&nbsp;

For an hour I let
her feel the fresh air, smiling as she tried to keep out of my view, still
trying to shield her body from me. I let her try, taking no action as she
turned away from me, keeping a firm grip on the chain connected to her waist.

&nbsp;

When I took her
back to her cell I could see her face drop, and I told her that the fresh air
was another merit that had to be earned. I was quite happy to leave her in the
cell, but was just as happy to allow her fresh air if she behaved.

&nbsp;

It was at that
time that I told her the next phase of her training would begin that night. She
looked at me, but made no sound, the questions never getting past her lips;.

&nbsp;

I could see the
disappointment in her face when I moved her back to the cell, and held her
against the wall, placing the collar around her neck. I told her I would bring
the cot back for her later, but that I was moving onto the next phase as well.

&nbsp;

Again I left her
alone, and knew that whatever I did, she would accept if it meant she would get
fresh air and her cot back.

&nbsp;

It was about
three hours before I returned, having had another chat on the internet. By now
she was almost forgotten, and other newer people had joined the chat room.
Things had moved on. 

&nbsp;

When I returned
to the cell I took with me a small device I had built. It was a two inch strip
that would pass under her and between her legs, and
then clip to another metal strip that would go around her waist, almost like a
metal g string. The main difference was the vibrator welded into place on the
metal understrip.

&nbsp;

Until now there
had been nothing sexual in her capture and imprisonment, but now it was to
start. As I closed it on her I saw her move her legs together. Without a word I
slapped her across the face. Immediately she relaxed, and when I pressed her
legs open, they obeyed. I had lubricated the vibrator, but I also knew that
after this time, it would still be hard for her to take. But I could not let
her feelings interrupt me, and quickly started to force the vibrator into her. ignoring her involuntary scream as it filled her, and
stretched her. Only when it was deep inside her did I loop the waist band
around her, and pulling the understrip tight, I
clipped it into place behind her.

&nbsp;

Her face showed
the pain she was feeling, and she was unable to hold back the tears. Satisfied
that the vibrator was secure, and that she could not reach it, I released the
collar and let her move around the cell.

&nbsp;

Holding the whip
in my hand, I led her around the cell, knowing that she must be feeling the
vibrator deep inside her, and her face told me that even with the lubrication
it was hurting her.� As a final gesture
for now, I dragged back the cot, and opened it out for her, telling her to lay down and get some rest. I saw her wince as she sat on
the edge of the cot, and then lift her legs up so she could lay
down.

&nbsp;

I then showed her
the small box I pulled from my belt. This was the remote for the vibrator. I
smiled as I turned the knob slowly, and heard the quiet buzz as the vibrator
sprang to life. Then I turned my back on her and left the cell, closing the
door behind me.� I watched her for a
while, through the spy hole, and after a short time I could see her hips begin
to move. Slowly, hesitantly at first, but as the vibrator continued to hum
away, I could see her start to relax. Just then I stopped it. 

&nbsp;

For over a week I
kept the vibrator in place, taking it out only for her bath and toilet, then putting it back. I knew she was both upset and hurting,
as I had turned the vibrator on and off at my will, bringing her close to
orgasm more than once, but stopping, refusing her that final release. This was
another privilege she would have to earn.

&nbsp;

Over the next few
days I introduced her to other items that would become a part of her training,
including a pair of nipple clamps. She screamed out� when I first placed these onto her,
but after a few days I was able to put them on without a murmour.

&nbsp;

She had been with
me now for over two months, and Christmas was close. Though
she did not realise this. She had no idea of
what date or time it was, as I still controlled her days and nights with the
cell light. 

&nbsp;

Once, she had
tried to get out of the cell just as I opened the door, but after a whipping,
she had not tried that again. I had also removed the vibrator, still not
letting her have the orgasm that had been so near so many times. I had seen her
on a number of occasions trying to reach herself with her hands, wanting to
finish what the vibrator was starting, and smiled at her frustration as she was
unable to reach.

&nbsp;

She now knelt as
soon as I entered the cell, and greeted me as Master. Long gone had the hope of
release or rescue, and though I had not taken it for granted, I knew that that
she had accepted her fate.� I had let her
have more fresh air and she had stopped any attempt at trying to cover her
self. 

&nbsp;

One day I entered
the cell and removed the metal belt from around her waist, the first time she
had been without it since shortly after her arrival. I warned her that if she
tried to escape, or to attack me, the belt would go back on, and would stay, as
I would weld it in place. She seemed to accept this, and when I took her out on
a lead and collar she made no attempt to get away from me.

&nbsp;

Slowly she had
come to rely on me for her food and well being. I allowed her to keep clean,
fed her well, and, now, was making sure she exercised daily. How much different
this was from the day I had abducted her.

&nbsp;

Just after
Christmas I took her upstairs in the house, and to my bedroom, watching her
eyes widen as she saw this area of my life for the first time. She still had
not seen the computer, as this was locked away in my den, as I knew that if she
saw it, she would try to get�
word to others, and gain her freedom. This piece of machinery
would come later.

&nbsp;

Once in the
bedroom I told her to remove her panties and place them at the bottom of the
bed, and then lay down. Without hesitation she did as she was told, and watched
as I removed the leather trousers I was wearing. I could see in her eyes that
she had mixed emotions. She had been so close to orgasm so many times her body
still screamed for release, and yet, she did not want sex with me. 

&nbsp;

Silently I lay on
the bed next to her, warning her that anything she did wrong would be severely
punished. She nodded immediately, and knew that the warning was not necessary.

&nbsp;

On the bed I lay
one hand over her breast, and felt the little nipples harden almost
immediately. Such was her desire to be fulfilled after being so close so many
times. I moved my hands slowly down and across her stomach, and smiled to my
self as she flinched, not sure whether she was supposed to respond or lay
still.� But as I neared the tops of her
thighs, her body seemed to take over from her mind, it seemed to be craving the
release it had been so often promised and denied.

&nbsp;

As my hand moved
between her legs I could feel the dampness already, and as my fingers brushed
against her, her hips rose to meet me. |i was not
fooled into thinking she was enjoying this, but her body craved release, and
her hips were hungry to get to my fingers, almost forcing them inside herself
in her eagerness.

&nbsp;

I let her do as
she wished for a while, and allowed my thumb to locate her clit, circling it
gently, feeling her hips crash against my hands as I did so, and at the same
time I took one nipple between my teeth and gently teased it.

&nbsp;

Deciding that now
was the time, I rolled over on top of her,. my legs between her open thighs, and my cock aimed at her
wet pussy. She did not fight as I pulled my fingers away, and touched her with
the head of my cock. Her hips again rose to meet me, and I smiled behind my
mask at her urgency. I wanted to make her beg,. to
scream for it, but in truth my urgency was almost as great as hers, having
watched her for so long, knowing that she was mine, and trying to pick the
right moment.

&nbsp;

As I slid my cock
into her, her hips crashed against me, swallowing the whole of my cock in one
go, her need far greater than her repulsion at being taken. Her whole body
seemed to come alive as we bucked together, not sure who was in control, if
either of us, both wanting it to last longer, yet neither able to hold back.

&nbsp;

I could feel her
muscles holding me, refusing to let go, refusing to be denied again, as she
lifted and lowered her hips in time to my thrusts. Then she screamed, loud and
guttural in my ear, her hips crashing against me, her arms wrapped around me to
make sure I would not pull out at this crucial moment, and then I felt the
wetness grow, as she started to cum. I could feel the pent up excitement in her
as she gave in to her desires, her muscles pulling at me, forcing me to join
her in this state of ecstasy. as I led my cum flood into her, filling her,
joining with her own juices, running out of her and down her inner thighs,
felling the dampness grow in a patch on the bed between her thighs.

&nbsp;

Even as I stopped
cumming, and began to relax, she refused to let go,
still trying to milk more juices from my cock, as she screamed out again, and I
knew that another orgasm had taken her.

&nbsp;

Later, as I took
her back to her cell, she whispered to me,as
if ashamed and delighted at the same time.

&nbsp;

&quot;Thank you,
Master&quot;

&nbsp;

IT was done, my
victim had become my slave, and she had admitted it to both herself and to me.

&nbsp;

That night I went
into the cell and gave her a leather collar, allowing her the choice to wear it
or not. To my surprise, she eagerly took it, fastening it around her own neck,
and handing me the key back.

&nbsp;

She had often
said on the internet that she craved a Master of her own, a strong Master, who
would take her, and force her to be His. Her wish had been fulfilled, and for
the first time I called her by her new name, her internet name. 

&nbsp;

She was home.

&nbsp;

She would stay
