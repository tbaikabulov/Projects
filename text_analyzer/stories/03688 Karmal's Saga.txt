Synopsis: Karmal escapes from a hacienda in Mexico run by a slave owner who subjects Karmal to extremely hard labor along with using her as a painslave.Her escape leads her to landing a job with a large corporation that has its headquarters on a large Carribean Island where she is sent for job training.Here she finds out rather suddenly that her new employer has other things in mind for her.A big thanks to Karmal,whose past experiences inspired this storyKarmal leaned back in her well upholstered seat as the whine of the executive
  jet lulled her comfortably into a relaxed state.Her racing thoughts continued
  to race within her mind as she tried to get a firm grasp on her good fortune
  over the past 2 days when she had been hired by the W_S-T_N Corporation. 
Karmal over 3 months ago had escaped from the confines of a Mexican Slave
  Farm and had sought employment once she returned to the U.S..She had just about
  been on the point of despair as she got the usual round of ignored r&eacute;sum&eacute;s,
  useless interviews and rejection letters from all the companies she applied
  to.One company H.R. director named Salter told her he was impressed with her
  and her credentials, but that he simply did not have a position at that time,
  but would be glad with her permission to forward her resume to some other H.R.
  directors he knew .Karmal thanked him profusely and told him by all means to
  do so. She smiled as she thought of the phone call the next day from the H.R.
  director at W_S-T_N, who sounded so positive as he talked to her, that she
  somehow knew that this was the one she been looking for all these months. 
What she did not anticipate was how rapidly she was hired on the spot the
  next morning 
after an hour long interview and an hour of taking a few written tests.During
  this process she found that W_S-T_N was involved in security consulting business
  and served corporate client's worldwide.Mr.Steele, the H.R. director beamed
  as he invited her back into his office after the tests and told her she had
  scored the highest in the company history on the executive selection tests
  and that the CEO himself had reviewed the results and had instructed Steele
  to hire her on the spot. 
�Now Karmal,this position is that of training coordinator and you will be
  responsible for scheduling our training teams to go onsite to our corporate
  client's offices and plants in order to provide security training to the client's
  employees. It's a very hands on position and yes you will dealing with the
  airlines and their quirks, but after you hear the compensation for this position,
  it may not seem quite the set of headaches you think it is.� 
With that he handed across the desk an offer letter and Karmal's heart went
  into her throat as she read that the base salary was $200,000 a year plus stock
  options, a company furnished car, an unlimited expense account and the opportunity
  to travel, along with a grocery list of other perks.Mr.Steele allowed her to
  read over it and then asked �Think we can persuade you to come aboard?�Karmal
  replied� I would be foolish not to! But I would need a little time to learn
  this job first wouldn't I?� Steele replied� We'll of course and if you decide
  to come on board with us, we have a complete training program ready to go at
  our corporate headquarters, in fact all our new employees undergo training
  there at corporate headquarters, along with taking care of all the other new
  employee details, like filling out the paperwork .Also one thing required of
  each W_S-T_N employee is an annual physical at company expense and that is
  done at the clinic there at corporate as well.� 
Steele paused and leaned over and pulled a four color brochure from his desk
  drawer 
and handed it across the desk and the said� By the way as you can see our
  corporate headquarters is located on our own tropical island in the Caribbean
  and the will be plenty of recreation time while you are there.�Karmal looked
  over the brochure and asked �But why an island and in the Carribean, wouldn't
  like New York, LA or Chicago make more sense? Steele replied� Yes it would
  be easier access for our employees, no question of that. But we located corporate
  there for several reasons, primarily it's far more secure and we can construct
  our corporate buildings to our specifications rather than putting up with zoning
  laws and outmoded building codes. In fact our buildings there can withstand
  a nuclear weapon detonation and still function. Which is a real good idea given
  the nature of our business.� Steele paused and chuckled� As you can imagine
  ,when the letters in your corporate name stands for �We Stop Terrorists Now�,
  it's no surprise that these folks would love to pay us a visit.Karmal replied� Yes
  ,I can certainly see that, but is it dangerous to be there at corporate, especially
  outside? Steele shook his head and pointed to the back of the brochure and
  said �No danger at all as the corporate compound is virtually impenetrable,
  we invested heavily in state of the art anti-intruder fencing 
and even if the bad guys get inside this ring of fences, they will not get
  far inside the building as we have internal security gates inside the building
  as well .But you will see all that when you go for the training, that is if
  you are ready to accept out offer?�Karmal quickly signed the offer letter and
  then delighted Mr.Steele with the fact that she no family ties and that she
  had been on a week to week arrangement with her landlord in case she did have
  to move after landing a job.�In fact Mr.Steele,I can be ready to go in the
  morning if that is not too soon�Steele replied�Why that will work perfectly
  as the corporate jet will be here overnight�Mr.Steele then thanked her warmly
  then told her a corporate limousine would be by her place at 9 AM the next
  morning to pick her up and take her to the corporate hangar. 
Karmal was bumped awake as the jet went through a patch of turbulence and
  the very attentive flight attendant appeared beside her seat and suggested
  she fasten her seat belt, then asked politely if she could get her anything.Karmal
  thanked her and then continued to doze and thought of the contrast between
  her life now where it seemed these folks were all giving and that of just a
  few weeks ago where the Mexicans were determined to take and take and then
  take some more. She tried to shake the images from her mind, but they still
  came bubbling up time and again as she adjusted to her life of freedom. 
Chapter 2 
Karmal started to doze gain and as she did her mind replayed her time in Mexico
  at the hands of the slavers .She well recalled the ride into Mexico on the
  back of a Harley, not knowing at the time that her biker boyfriend had met
  another woman and had made arrangements to sell her to the Mexicans, who operated
  a large ranch which featured a tile factory among other things. She would soon
  find out the tremendous amount of work it requires keeping a tile factory operating. 
The arrangements her boyfriend made with the Mexicans were carried out the
  next night as the bikers had a Tequila soaked blow out in one of the Cantinas.
  Her boyfriend had her 
engage in several contests with other biker women to see who could down the
  most Tequila shots in 30 seconds, shot glass by shot glass.Karmal soon found
  herself almost immobilized after downing several dozen shots of Tequila. Her
  boyfriend then announces it is time to go for the night and he half carries
  her outside .Karmal just wants to lay down and go to sleep as the world seems
  to spin about, then to her relief she is taken to the back of an SUV and one
  of the Mexicans opens the back gate and says� Place her in here, Senor.she
  will be quite comfortable.� Grateful for a place to sleep, Karmal hears her 
boyfriend talking to the Mexicans and then hears one Mexican counting in English��and
  5,000 ,Senor,nice doing business with you.�Karmal is to drunk to comprehend
  what is taking place as the Tequila plunges her into a deep sleep. 
Karmal awoke the next morning and as she opened her eyes, her mind had real
  trouble comprehending where she was and why. As she looked down she saw that
  she was totally naked! Raising her head slightly she felt something heavy about
  her neck ,her fingers instantly shot to her neck and she felt cold steel almost
  3� wide encircling her neck! She probed for the release only to find two openings
  that were keyholes to some sort of internal lock within the collar itself.
  She starts to stand she discovers a solid metal chain attached the collar on
  one end, the opposite end secured to a metal ring in the wall. The chain is
  but a few feet long, which allows her to stand and take a few steps, but as
  she 
does she almost falls as she discovers two steel shackles encircling each
  ankle joined by a short chain, so short that what steps she can take she finds
  that these are half steps. 
She looks around further and finds that she is in a tiny cell like room measuring
  about 
6 feet deep by 4 foot wide with a ceiling at 7 feet. The walls are constructed
  of what feels like solid steel and opposite Karmal is very solid steel door
  with what appears to be several locks in place.She quickly notices that with
  no window it is extremely hot in there and that a sheen of sweat is already
  formed on her body,with a slight tinge of Tequila to it.Karmal starts to call
  out and as she does she hears a series of clicks 
and she sees that two men are standing at the door as it swings open. One
  enters and as he does Karmal starts to yell� You bastards, what have you done
  with my clothes? Where am I?� The man in the cell tells her in a calm voice� All
  in good time, you will remain silent and all will become apparent very soon
  to you.� He notices she starts to say more and he holds up a hand� Silence
  now, it will go very hard on you to say anymore. For your own good, quiet!� 
Then in a deft move he slips behind her and she feels metal handcuffs being
  placed on each wrist,then. To her horror, these seem to be rigid cuffs, which
  bind her wrists together closely and tightly, and then the man releases the
  chain to her collar from the wall and leads Karmal out of the cell and down
  a long corridor with Karmal trying her best to keep up with her shackled half
  steps. As she is led along she notices all the other cell like doors and seems
  to lose count of them.A few are open and her mind reels as she sees the female
  occupants inside the few cells with the doors open as she notices not only
  the collars and chains holding them in place,but as well the vivid red whip
  marks that stand out against their pale skin. Then she is led down a flight
  of stairs and down another corridor.Karmal almost freezes in midstep in total
  disbelief as she looks down the corridor and coming towards her on the left
  side of the corridor are a line of women being marched at a fast pace by several
  whip wielding men.As they pass on her left in a very straight single file line,Karmal
  notices that each woman is totally necked and are joined together with a common
  chain running from collar to collar.her handler urges here forward then stops
  and knocks on a door on the left hand side of the corridor. 
The door swings open and Karmal almost collapses as she is led into this dark
  dungeon like room as her senses are assailed with the rich scent of leather
  emitting from the hundreds of various whips of all types hanging from the 3
  inside walls. Surrounding the interior center of this room is a variety of
  heavy metal frames and floor to ceiling posts 
all with various restraints attached to them.Karmal's attention is riveted
  onto a very well built brunette,who is on her knees with her wrists secured
  to a beam running across and just above her head.The brunette is squirming
  and trying her best to evade the attentions of the man who keeps applying a
  small crop to her enlarged nipples.Karmal notices that the brunette's pleas
  for mercy are being totally ignored by her tormentor.Then looking to the opposite
  side of the room and through a door off the main room she sees a rather plump
  blonde woman standing naked and secured with her wrists secured well above
  her head,being team whipped by several men using fierce looking black leather,multi-tail
  whips.Karmal notices that the blonde's tormentors are timing things so that
  a whip is striking her each second,emitting animal like wails of agony from
  the blonde. Two well muscled men. shirtless come over as she is led in and
  look her over carefully, then one says in a loud voice to the handler �What
  you think this is a damn cow farm farm or something?Holy Shit,that is one big
  titted female!Hell ,you take that one outside naked her damn cunt won't sunburn
  that's for sure!Look at those nipples,damn they must be 3 inchers if not more.Ah,
  well I like them big,they make easy targets for my whip!Oh wait is this the
  new arrival?�The handler affirms that she is and the man walks over and selects
  a black bullwhip from the wall.Karmal shudders as he takes it down from the
  rack as it must be at least 10 feet long and at the handle is about 3� thick
  tapering into a narrow tip about a &frac12;� wide.Making his selection the
  man nods and the handler quickly leads Karmal over to another door which opens
  into yet another room, this room is only 8 feet wide, but almost 20 feet long
  with the far end having several metal cuffs 
attached firmly into the wall.Karmal is lead to the far wall and the handler
  releases her ` 
wrist cuffs but quickly secures her wrists over her head and locks them in
  place.Then one of the men says something in Spanish and the handler then releases
  her ankle shackles only to place each ankle in a wall cuff as well, she found
  that she could move but only fractions of an inch after the ankle cuffs were
  locked in place and she had only the wall to stare at, her bare breasts and
  knees rubbing occasionally against the hard stone wall surface before here.
  Then she hears the door swing open and footsteps sound across the stone floor
  behind her. A well dressed Mexican speaking educated English addresses her 
�Welcome to our hacienda here Karmal.You my dear have been selected and purchased
  by me to be a slave here on my hacienda and for right now I have decided to
  try you out as a torture slave. At sometime in the near future I may offer
  you some other position, but only when and if I decide to do so. When I do
  ,you may want to consider this alternative as the experts here will have you
  begging for alternatives. While they are going about these tasks, your status
  here will be explained to you and you will be given opportunities to acknowledge
  these terms and conditions as they proceed. I suggest you take these when offered
  to make your acknowledgements as frequent refusals will result in longer intervals
  between acknowledgement inopportuneness's for your first session I have directed
  Alhendro,my most expert whipmaster to introduce you to his custom made whip
  which is called the Black Cobra.Alhendro is a very precise craftsman as you
  are about to see with a little demonstration of his skill.� 
Suddenly Karmal hears a loud whoosh as if something is cutting through the
  air 
at high speed then a millisecond later the fires of Hell explode across the
  backs of her thighs, just above the knee, a pain so intense that she loses
  her breath for a moment and only the stone surface of the wall pressing into
  her nipples and knees revives her. Before she can fully recover another whoosh
  sounds behind her and the whip's long tail explodes across the middle of her
  back thighs, but inches above the first one.Shaking, straining against her
  restraints, she finds her body bathed in sweat as it seems to have gotten sticky
  hot in the room. Another whoosh and this time the lash lands just below her
  butt, leaving another cheering, pulsing lash in its place. Then one of the
  men calls out� You are about to be given a chance to acknowledge that you are
  a slave, so think carefully! If you acknowledge we go to something else or
  we can keep this up.� Then again the dreaded whoosh and this time Karmal's
  butt explodes in a fiery ribbon across both cheeks and has her shrieking in
  total agony. Then several more ashes, each moving up higher on her body. hanging
  from the wrists restraints near collapse she hears� Do you acknowledge your
  status as our Slave?� She thinks a moment then blurts out a weak � Yes,anything
  you want,yes� 
Karmal is awakened by the flight attendant who says�Ms.English, are you alright?�Karmal
  sits up and looks around for a moment and says �Oh, sorry I had a bad dream
  I guess�The 
flight attendant smiles and says�Oh, no problem,flying seems to do that to
  lots of folks.If you like I will be glad to bring you your lunch now,plus I
  have something Mr.Steele 
asked me to give you.�Karmal again thought of how polite and deferential all
  these employees had been to her and contrasted it to the place she had just
  revisited in her dreams where the extreme opposite was true. 
Chapter 3 
Karmal finished the last of her lunch,then the flight attendant returned to
  take her tray and handed Karmal an envelope with the W_S-T_N logo on the front,with
  her name had written across the address section.Opening she finds a memo form
  inside and reads�Karmal, 
I forgot to tell you but there will be a $5,000 signing bonus waiting for
  you when you get to corporate headquarters.You will be able to pick this up
  late this afternoon in room 225. 
You may want to go ahead and take care of the paperwork and do the medical
  exam first, then go by and pick your bonus up as it is in the form of traveler's
  checks which you will need to sign.So glad to have you aboard!-Steele. 
�Oh how nice.� Karmal thinks to herself and the contrast between her first
  day with this company versus that of her first work day with the slavers in
  Mexico again sets her mind racing and the anger wells up in her again at the
  thought of how she was treated by the overseer on her first work assignment.Karmal's
  mind starts to replay the details as she starts to doze again as the hum of
  the jet engines, combined with the big lunch lull her 
into another dream state. Karmal had been awakened at 4 A.M. for her first
  day as a labor slave and after being allowed a few minutes in the bathroom
  and breakfast on the run, she was led into a small room and was given a �uniform� of
  sorts. 
Her uniform� consisted only of a pair of low cut boots and a pair of heavy
  socks to protect her feet. Except for the collar around her neck and the boots
  she was informed she 
would work totally naked. After putting on the boots she was taken out to
  the timber yard where the overseer there went over her assignment and his expectations. 
Leading her down past many stacks of Red Oak logs he leads her to a clearing
  in front of a huge stack of logs, then explains� We import Red Oak logs in
  as they seem to give the most even heat in the tile kilns. These logs come
  in by railroad and have to be cut 
into 3 foot sections and then we stack the 3 foot sections so that will dry
  evenly. 
You have several things to do here in this process; first you will retrieve
  each log with this 
hand powered winch and place each log on the saw rack. Then you will need
  to mark a 1 foot section on each end and then measure your three foot sections
  from there, using this measuring stick. We have found that these extra 1 foot
  cuts give us the best interior wood and it heats better. That's a lot of extra
  work, but since we use slave labor, it makes no difference to us. Then you
  take this single crosscut saw and make your cuts .Once you have the sections
  cut you use the winch again and stack the sections as you see these drying
  stacks over to the left here are stacked. We let the sections dry for 2 weeks
  then we will have you return and split these 
sections into halves then quarters.� 
Now I will let you do your first one while I watch so you get things right.
  I will also watch how you work then set your quota for the day. Now you got
  any questions?�Karmal thought for a minute and then asked �How many of us are
  going to be working on this?� 
The overseer chuckled and said�How many? Well that's an easy one, help, hmm
  you don't get any help with this! Now, take the cable and winch your first
  log off the stack. 
Karmal, took the heavy cable and climbed up to the top of the log pile and
  attached the cable to both ends of a huge log, then climbed down and went over
  to the winch, which she found was indeed hand powered. A large handle extended
  from the main pulley 
she grasped the handle and began cranking the winch, which took all her strength 
In her back and chest muscles, Finally the log clears the pile and Karmal
  has to pull 
to the winch to the left and position it over the saw rack.Then, the overseer
  shows her how to reverse the winch and Karmal carefully lowers the log into
  place.Then, taking the measuring stick she carefully marks the 1 foot cut at
  the base end of the log and than marks the other sections, noting that with
  the extra 1 foot cuts this log will require 6 cuts. 
She picks up the saw and starts the first cut and soon finds that sawing is
  probably the hardest part of the job as the saw makes its slow progress through
  the dense Oak, she pauses to catch her breath and the overseer orders� Don't
  ever stop once you start a 
Cut, it's too much effort to get the cut started again and you need to cut
  faster.� 
Karmal starts the cut again and tries her best to speed up the saw putting
  all her effort into it ,finally the 1 foot section falls free and she moves
  to the next cut and starts the process again. Half way through this second
  cut her muscles are screaming for relief and she tries to work through the
  pain, willing her arms to push and pull the saw. Despite her best efforts the
  overseer is not pleased� All right Miss big titty flab queen, lets double up,
  see if you can double the pace on the next cut, in fact I think you need a
  little motivation.� 
Moving to the third cut the overseer moves behind Karmal and watches her effort
  and says� Faster damnit, I said double the pace!� Then Karmal feels a sting
  of fire across her back as the overseer uses a small multi-tail whip to motivate
  her. Somehow she gives him the pace he is demanding and he backs away. The
  next cuts go quickly and finally the last cut falls to the ground and Karmal
  stops to survey her work. The overseer orders�Now, these first ones you can
  roll over to form the base of the stack, but after the next two logs you will
  need to winch each one in place.� 
Karmal,rolls each section over to the section the overseer indicates and then
  he inspects her work and says� You got the method down, but you have to work
  a lot faster than you just did, as it took you over an hour to do that one
  log. What I need is for you to complete 
4 logs per hour, but it being your first day I will modify that some, but
  only this first day. 
Checking his watch he says�Alright its 6 AM, so that leaves you 14 hours today,
  so by 
8:00 PM you will have done 42 logs. I'll send the water wagon by here in about
  two hours, in the meantime you had better get your ass in gear, because I will
  be by from time to time to check on you.BTW, I know the thought has crossed
  your mind already, but don't think you can escape from here, there is a 100
  miles of desert in all directions surrounding our place here and without any
  water to take with you, you won't make it very far, and we control who gets
  water when. Plus there are lots of Sidewinders, Scorpions and banditos out
  there.� 
With that he leaves and Karmal starts on her daunting task, winching the next
  log into place and then as she starts marking and sawing, the Sun finally starts
  shining down on her work area and soon waves of heat rise up around Karmal
  and this only exacerbates her growing thirst as the waves of heat cause her
  to sweat even more profusely as she saws 
away at the cuts in the log. 
Finally as she is winching the cut 3' sections into place she looks up to
  see a brown haired, muscular female pulling a large cart behind her. Spotting
  Karmal the female turns in her direction and 
and stops the cart beside the winch,announcing�Water Break� in a loud voice.Karmal
  climbs down from the winch and the female hands her a bottle of spring water,
  which she quickly consumes. Looking about the female asks� Where are the others?� to
  which Karmal replies� What others, the overseer told me that I wasn't getting
  any help.� The female turns and looks at Karmal and replies�Oh no, don't tell
  me they are having you do all this by yourself!�Karmal then explains her instructions
  from the overseer that morning and the facts that he had walked her through
  all the steps necessary to cut the logs in three foot sections and then stack
  them for drying. She also explained that she had specifically asked about the
  what help she was going to get and repeated the fact that the overseer indicated 
she was not going to have any help. 
The female handed Karmal another bottle of water and then indicates that she
  take a seat. 
�I am afraid I have some things I had best tell you.� the female states as
  she too takes a seat in the shade of the cart� I have been here for over a
  year now and the assignment the overseer has given you to carry out is normally
  carried out by a 4 woman team. In fact they have to team up and coordinate
  their efforts in order to meet their daily quota.� she pauses and then asks
  Karmal�What quota did the overseer give you this morning?� Karmal replied �42
  logs by 8PM tonight is what he told me, but I don't see how I am going to meet
  the quota as there is so much to be done to each log.� The female looked at
  Karmal in disbelief as she said�42 logs in 16 hours!Oh honey they are working
  you hard, 
You see normally the quota for a 4 woman crew per day is 50 logs cut and stacked 
and they achieve that by putting 4 logs at a time of the saw rack and then
  the pairs 
push and pull them in concert.� she points to the saw rack and says�See it's
  wide enough to take 4 logs at once and as the logs are winched in place by
  the other 3 women, the fourth one is marking the logs as they are put in place.� she
  then asks �What kind of saw did they give you to use?� Karmal gets up and retrieves
  the saw and returns with it and hands it to the female. She looks it over and
  says� In all the time I have been here I have never seen one of these single
  saws, most saws are 10' or 12' in length with a handle on both ends.� She then
  points to the saw teeth on the blade and says� Look here every other toot on
  this blade has been flattened very precisely, causing you to have do twice
  as many strokes than if they were all sharp.� 
Karmal absorbs this news for a moment, then asks �What happens if I don't
  meet my quota each day?� to which the female replies �A variety of things,
  the overseer may increase your hours or you may have other tasks waiting on
  you when you finish here 
Each day, it all depends on how much quota deficit you have at the end of
  the week. 
One fortunate thing is they are not as strict here in the log yard about missing
  quotas as they are in the Clay Mines and Sand Pits.� the female pauses and
  then explains� See 
Most of us are sent here to the log yard for a few months as this gets us
  in condition 
for the work in the Clay Mines and Sand Pits, now those two are where the
  real work takes place and will make what you are doing here seem like an easy
  stroll in the park.� She stands and says �I need to go, hand me your empty
  bottles as I have to turn them in at the end of each run and account for them.
  I will be back in two hours and we will talk some more.�Karmal asks as the
  female starts to leave �Will you bring any food next time?� 
And the female replies�No, that's the trip after this next one.� And with
  that she trots off 
in the distance as Karmal wrestles with the news she has just learned. 
She awakens again as the flight attendant advises her that the plane is only
  20 minutes from the airport and tells Karmal that if she looks to the left
  in about 10 minutes she will begin to see the island that corporate owns and
  uses for it's headquarters location. She looks below and sees miles of ocean
  below and several small islands come into view first, and then what must be
  the corporate island fills the view as the plane descends.Karmal 
sees what is apparently corporate headquarters, a compound of ultra-modern
  looking buildings which is centered inside a series of 6 fences, which seem
  to grow outward from 
the compound. The plane lands and then taxis and comes to a stop and the flight
  attendant 
opens the door as a stairway is wheeled to the forward passenger door.Karmal
  says bye to the flight attendant and two men in coats and ties are at the foot
  of the stairway. 
�Ms.English? How do you do I am Bob Connors and this is Bill Wilkinson.Welcome
  to 
Headquarters and also welcome aboard the company as well.�Karmal replies� Thank
  you, I am certainly glad to be here. I didn't realize the island was as big
  as it is the brochure Mr. Steele showed me just doesn't do it justice.� Both
  men laughed and agreed with her 
as they lead her over to a Mercedes SUV.Wilkinson holds the front passenger
  door open for her and tells her her bags are already off the plane and on the
  way to her 
suite in the company hotel. 
Connors takes the wheel and cranks up and starts driving and Karmal notices
  about a dozen private jets parked on one side of the airport, all with different
  colors and several bearing Arabic writing on the tail and body.� Does the company
  own all these jets?� 
Connors replies� I wish we did, it would sure beat having to wait for one
  of our jets to show up. No, actually, these jets are owned by some of out clients,
  including several from our clients in the Middle East. Those oil sheiks seem
  to get more paranoid as they get richer and they hire us to beef up their protection.
  We have a special event coming up 
With some of our better customers starting tonight and that's why all the
  private jets. 
Wilkinson then adds� Matter of fact that will be part of your training ,as
  you will get to meet some of these client's and in turn this will give them
  a chance to meet you and some of other new employees as well.� 
The SUV approaches a gated entrance and the gate opens automatically and then
  this process is repeated several times as they pass through the 6 fences Karmal
  saw from the air.Karmal asks� Why so many fences, I saw six from the air?� Connors
  replies&quot; Well it keeps intruders of any sort out and on several occasions
  we have had client's come here 
for protective custody. The fences are not the only measure we have as each
  square inch 
of ground inside the fences is monitored by motion sensors, infra- red sensors
  and closed circuit TV as well. Biggest problem we have with this is these sensors
  pick up every lizard that comes to visit at 3 AM.!� This brings a round of
  laughter from them all. 
Finally clearing the last gate, the SUV pulls up to the Headquarters entrance
  and Karmal 
is met by a woman at the front door and introduces herself as Ivy Goodwin.
  Like Connors and Wilkinson,Ivy also is very welcoming and then leads Karmal
  through a series of 
doors,each requiring that Ivy place her thumb on a scanner.They finally reach
  Ivy's 
office and Ivy says� I know you have had a long trip on the plane and if you
  need to freshen up, please do.Karmal replies�No, actually I slept most of the
  trip and freshened up on the plane. To which Ivy replies with a smile�Alright
  then, well we have time today to get your medical exam completed then you can
  tackle all the paperwork in the morning if you like. The medical exam does
  not involve much as most of it consists of a full body open MRI, which is about
  as easy as standing in a phone booth.� With that Ivy picked up 
The phone and punched in a number�Hi this is Ivy, Karmal English just arrived.Can
  I bring her down now? You do how many? 6, ok well we don't want to keep her
  waiting, she is on the executive list .Alright, be there in a minute.� 
Ivy hangs up the phone and gets up from her desk� Lets walk down there, there
  are several new hires waiting, but they will take you back as soon as the next
  nurse is available to assist you. Rank has its privileges!� she said with a
  smile. They pass through several 
gates all requiring Ivy to place her thumb on the scanner and Karmal says� I
  guess it is 
as hard to get out as it is to get in this place with these scanners on the
  doors.� Ivy replies 
�Well you would think so, but thank goodness they are designed otherwise.� Ivy
  pauses at an elevator and again places her thumb on a scanner and the elevator
  doors open and they start downwards finally stopping at the lowest floor where
  they walk down a corridor and into a plushly appointed lobby type office. Ivy
  walks to the desk and speaks to the receptionist who looks up from her work
  and then smiles at Karmal�Ms.English ,I apologize but you may have to wait
  just a few minutes and then as soon as one of the nurses gets through she will
  take you right back, may I get you anything while you wait?�Karmal replies
  that she does not require anything at the moment and the receptionist indicates
  a seat for her and then deferentially adds� please let me know if I can do
  anything to make you more comfortable.� Ivy then says� I am going back to my
  office, just dial 05 in any phone to reach me when you are through and I will
  come back for you.� 
Karmal then takes a seat and notices the 6 other women waiting as well ,as
  two leggy brunettes are chatting with each other and a woman with reddish blonde
  hair is reading an Engineering Journal, beside her is a heavy set read head
  who appears to be dozing, and to her left are two frowning women with brown
  hair. In another minute a nurse enters and walks up to Karmal and says�Ms.English,
  I am Lynn Dobbs and I want to apologize for your having to wait. If you will
  follow me we can have you out of here in a half an hour or so.�Karmal follows
  her into a medical exam room and then the nurse has her to take a seat on the
  exam room table.She then takes Karmal's blood pressure and checks her pulse 
and carefully records each measurement. She then says�Ms.English ,most of
  our medical exam will be conducted using a full body scan MRI.In order to do
  that I will need for you to fully disrobe and remove all jewelery.We will have
  to take a short walk down the hall 
to the MRI room and here is a paper garment for you to wear until we get to
  the MRI chamber itself. I will step outside now, please come out when you are
  ready. Your clothing and jewelry will be safe here as I will lock the door
  after you come out.� 
Karmal starts to undress and a small shudder runs through her as getting naked
  again brings back echoes of Mexico. But she thinks, these folks have been treating
  me like royalty since I came in and they do provide this paper dress to wear
  down the hall. She slips the paper dress over her head and she sees it does
  cover things quite nicely.Karmal then opens the door and the nurse smiles and
  locks the door and then leads Karmal down the hallway 
and through another thumb scanner controlled doorway. She then stops and opens
  a door 
labeled �MRI-6 and she Karmal enter the room and the nurse closes the door
  and says 
�Now Ms.English, the first part of the scan will be for you to walk forward
  and stand 
between the two red lines indicated, this is not the actual MRI but a scan
  to insure 
That you don't have any perfume or other substances that might interfere with
  the scan itself, we have found this saves a lot of having to come back for
  a rescan. I also need your dress off before we begin.�Karmal removes the dress
  and then a walk to the spot between the two red lines and the nurse then says�Alright,
  raise your head and stare straight ahead, that's fine.�Karmal hears a click
  and then is told to turn facing left, then facing the 
back wall, then a quarter turn to the right, each position followed by a metallic
  click. 
The nurse then says now lets step into the MRI chamber itself as she opens
  a door just beyond the red lines.Karmal enters and the room is actually quite
  spacious with a contoured scanning table in the center of the room. The nurse
  has Karmal to sit and then lie back on the table itself and then directs her
  to place her arms well above her head 
and her ankles about 18� apart .The nurse then says I will step outside now
  and in a moment the scan will begin, you will hear a slight humming sound and
  it is important that you not breathe or move during the scan.� With that the
  nurse leaves the room and Karmal waits for the scan to begin. 
Then she hears a low hum and holds her breath as the table seems to vibrate
  slightly then in the blink of an eye and before she can react she her wrists,
  neck, thighs and ankles are secured in steel restraints.Her heart pounds as
  she struggles helplessly to get free of the restraints and then she screams
  as her mind tries to comprehend the reality of the moment. 
Then the door opens and a man walks in and looks her over slowly.� What is
  this? This isn't part of the scan is it? What is this some kind of joke?� Karmal
  asks, desperate for answers and near panic. The man pauses as if thinking then
  says �No, this is no joke.� 
In reply Karmal says well I need to be let go. I have all sorts of things
  I have to do 
for my new job!� The man then says�Job?Oh that, you fell for that hook, line
  and sinker my dear. Let me ask you do you know what the letters W_S-T_N stand
  for? Karmal replies 
�Yes, Mr.Steele said it stood for We Stop Terrorists Now� The man laughs and
  says 
�Steele, he does get creative with these letters.� then the smile leaves his
  face and 
Karmal's blood runs cold as the man says� Actually, W_S-T_N stands for White
  Slave Traders Network and you are our newest acquisition!�In just a few hours
  you will be marched totally naked and in chains to the auction block and sold
  to the highest bidder and with those tits my dear we will make a very,very
  nice profit on you. 
Chapter 4 
The man that has been talking to Karmal steps out of the room after a rapid
  knock sounds on the door of the chamber Karmal finds herself confined in and
  left she alone continues to try to wriggle free of the steel restraints that
  are holding her immobilized on the so called �MRI� table.Finally after a few
  minutes of struggling,she finds that she is no closer to escaping her steel
  restraints,than she was when she first started and the all too familiar feelings
  of a total lack of control over anything wash over her again as they did on
  a far too regular basis in Mexico.She thought to herself� Fairness, nope not
  there and I bet not here either.� her thoughts are interrupted as she hears
  from the next chamber to her left�Noooo!What is this?� then a few moments later
  she hears another voice in a lower explanatory tone which is interrupted again'But
  I am a engineer and they hired me to head their engineering department!� Karmal
  thinks back a moment and then figures out that the reddish blonde woman has
  just been given the news about the true nature of her new employer.�Come to
  think of it,I did notice she was holding that Engineering Journal out a bit
  so she could read it.�Recalling the latest victims rather large,full bust.Then
  through the wall to her right she hears an almost operatic voice call out in
  sheer panic�No,what are these,let me go! Again Karmal hears the
  male voice in the same tone of voice explaining the latest victim's newly revised
  employment position'White Slave Traders!No.my God You Can't��.Karmal guesses
  this is the rather heavy set redhead reacting to the news. 
Karmal continues to wait and wonders what is next and how long it will be
  before the auction starts.Then she almost tries to sit bolt upright but feels
  the restraints again�My god those private jets,those are the buyers.�Recalling
  that many of the planes are from the Middle East a real sense of dread washes
  over her as she had heard stories over the years about how the Arabs treat
  their wives and other women like they are animals and slave women are treated
  even worse than that making her years in Mexico seem like visting an ultra-luxurious
  resort by comparision. 
The door opens again and the same man enters the room,returning a small cell
  phone to his shirt pocket as he walks back over to Karmal�Well,a reprieve for
  you.It seems the auction has been postponed.�Karmal asks�You mean you are going
  to let me go?�The man pauses and then replies�Well yes, you will released from
  these restraints in just a few minutes.�Karmal sighs in relief at this news
  and just as quickly her hopes are dashed as he continues�But just as soon as
  you are released from these restraints,you will be placed in a another set.We
  are not letting you go if that is what you meant.We will just have to confine
  you in our holding area until the next auction can be held which may be a few
  days or a week,it all depends on the clients all getting here.The delay this
  time was caused by bad weather over the Western Carribean ,it has caused several
  of our clients from Columbia and Mexico to cancel their flight plans and those
  are some of our more lucrative clients.� Karmal puzzled asks�Lucrative?�The
  man grins and says�Yes they always pay top dollar for what they want and let
  me ssure you we give them what they want.� 
A shudder runs through Karmal as the thought of returning to Mexico is the
  last thing she would ever want to do given her experiences over the past few
  years.Then another thought crosses her mind�What if the Tile factory owner
  is part of this and on the client list?� as this possibility occurs to her
  the fingers of cold fear grip her insides,envisioning the treatment she would
  receive for her escape.The chiming of the man's cell phone breaks her chain
  of thought and the man steps outside while answering it.He closes the door
  behind him but Karmal can hear him talking just outside the door catching the 
occasional few words as she strains to overhear his conversation as he seems
  to be pacing as he talks.'Yes�.well I am right in front of MRI-6��..yes,I looked
  her over closely���.no not an ounce of flab on her,looks like she is a weightlifter,did
  you see her nipples�at least 3���see,I told you the picturesets via e-mail
  would work����..yes,well the fun part is they have no idea we took these���yes
  we had to sedate two of them���yeah ,the reddish blonde engineer ,Steele called
  her the big boobed hillbilly from West Virginia,he is right about them,yeah
  40 DD I'd say�.. 
yeah,and that tall brunette with the long hair,yeah Steele found out about
  her casino problem from one of his casino contacts�..yeah offered her a way
  out�oh she kept screaming that she was a bank president's wife�oh we will have
  her sign a dear john letter,you know I caused too many problems for us etc��.yeah
  I thought she was too skinny too �.well she must be big into diet and exercise�..go
  back and look at her pics those are premium puffies as in top dollar��..ok
  well I need to get these transported to holding ,call me when the prelims start
  coming in�6 more in the waiting room�..the fun never ends breaking the news�well
  got another call�ok�Karmal again strains as the man takes the second call� sorry
  the weather delayed you�.oh we have a stable full��yeah business is very good� �.How
  is the Tile business�Hold on I will go check���Then the man fades out of earshot
  and Karmal's heart pounds as she tries to comprehend all that she just heard
  especially the part about Mexico and the Tile business. 
�My God could it be after all!� then she relaxes as the thought occurs to
  her�But there again they have no idea I am here.� then another thought�But
  what if the Tile owner is at the auction.?�Karmal's thoughts boil as she has
  little to do but think as her restraints prevent her doing anything else and
  again the feelings of totally lacking control wash over her as she is compelled
  to wait with no means of influencing events in the least,just as it had been
  in Mexico . 
Her short time of freedom these past few months had delighted her as she readjusted
  to her life in freedom and she thought how wonderful it was to be able to have
  the most basic things like clothing and the luxury of being able to decide
  when and where these were taken off and then in a totally private setting.She
  had also enjoyed the fact that she could eat or drink things when she wanted
  them,rather than this being decided for her.Her two biggest adjustments had
  taken several days to get through as at first she still tended to wait for
  permission to talk and finally got used to the fact she could talk as needed,rather
  than being granted the privilege of being able to speak.The permission to speak
  often came with the stern admonition that she should use as few as words as
  possible.Then she thought of the explosion of information available to her
  via TV,Radio and Newspapers,as the slavers had virtually cutoff all access
  to any reading matter or electronic media as another element of their total
  control.She then thought back to the few occasions when a weeks old newspaper
  would show up in the compound and get carefully passed around,although often
  this was news she or the others didn't want to read.She well recalled her horror
  at reading articles about female slavery being legalized in Mexico,along with
  articles regarding court rulings that often dictated that female slaves had
  no rights or remedies under Mexican law and the one that caused the most horror
  was the Female Slave extradition treaty that the U.S. had signed with Mexico
  as part of a trade pact.Karmal soon after returning to the U.S. with a fear
  of extradition hanging over head soon found out these articles were all clever
  propaganda from the slavers. 
Then the man's voice drifts back into range and Karmal again hears fragments
  of his side of the cell phone conversation�Well I have 7 that are still waiting
  to be transported��.. 
�well I know the are designed for one,but we may have to put two per cell��well
  just for the night I know they will talk to each other,can't be helped�.well
  by then the crew can have those temporary cages setup��or we could hold them
  at the training facility 
instead of setting up the temporary cages�..yeah I know you guys call them
  kennels�.. 
�the prelims are back�.great�hang on let me get my pen��ok �..and you thought
  she was too skinny lordy those lezdoms have some deep pockets 975,000 average
  not bad,ok next��well I guess her engineering skills and the 40DD's added up�..1.25
  mil�wow�..the redhead��the Arabs do like them on the hefty side 725,000�..ok
  and the other brunette��that's the short haired one�..575,000 hmm that's about
  right 
and what about those two brown haired ones��..oh no one has given their estimated
  bid on them���yeah but why Steele always sends these types down here�� 
ok and last but not least our brunette treasure in MRI-6�.Wait!say that again?.......how
  much? 3.7 million�wait is that the highest bid estimate�or the average?....it
  is the average�..damn�..who submitted estimated bids on her��ok yeah know that
  bunch 
he is a broker for the pain slaver market,he must have a client hot for her..yeah
  well he marks them up and resells them after he pays us�..must have at 5 mil��.ok
  next�.. 
�oh lord yeah that's another broker for the bdsm video makers he definently
  has a client looking for her type...I know so �Hell he never bids above 1 mil
  usually��he likes his markup too much and at 4.8mil��.ok next�..oh yeah just
  talked to him that's the Mexican tile magnate��2.5 and that's high for him
  to...yeah,and he just called again� 
�oh he has this big clay mine and he just told me he is opening a new salt
  mine as well��no most of his labor types he buys from the border trade �.yeah
  he says 5 g's is big money in that market�.ok and who was next��.oh yeah �hmmm�.our
  friend the sheik at 1.5 mil�..yeah he has this big rock quarry and works them
  by day and then torments them by night�.yeah been there before,you oughta see
  the damn dungeon he had built��.ok and #5?Yeah he is the broker for another
  network of pay for pain operations�.well at 1 mil �they the ones that are going
  to hurt�..you run this by the boss yet cause you know when we get one like
  this one���.yep put her through the training course�yeah well it would take
  the full course�start with breaking her will and spirit and then go from there�hell
  yes she'd bring more after training�..about double I'd say and also we may
  have to put the reddish blonde engineer in training too�.. 
hey did a purse dump and got to checking further�..one of those fast track
  executive types�..you always have to bring them down a few notches. 
The door to Karmal's chamber opens again and Karmal looks at wide eyed at
  the man as he enters,he then stops bends his head slightly and then looks back
  at the door then back at Karmal�Oh been eavesdropping have you?�Karmal tries
  to look away and then sighs and says �Yes I have,but I really couldn't help
  it.�The man laughs and says'You have a point.Plus I am just about certain you
  have been trying to figure out all you heard?� 
Karmal replies �Yes I have� the man thinks for a moment and then says'Well
  I don't usually explain things to women in your situation,but while we are
  waiting for my long lost transport crew to arrive,I will.What you just heard
  me discussing was the results of our bid estimate ,we e-mail the pictureset
  of each female that comes in here and those clients that are interested submit
  an estimated bid on those that they are interested in.� 
Pausing he notices Karmal's puzzled look as she asks�What pictures,no one
  has taken my picture here or at at Steele's office.So where did you get these
  pictures.?The man replies �Oh we took your pictures alright,you recall the
  preliminary scan you did and having to turn in different directions?Well there
  is no preliminary scan,we use that story to obtain completely nude front,back
  and left and right profiles of each female that comes in here.� 
Karmal,blushes with humiliation at the thought of these pictures being taken,she
  had been photographed extensively and then made to perform in numerous videos
  in Mexico and totally hated the whole experience.She then has another horrible
  thought�Wait you said you e-mail these to your clients,you mean my pictures
  are floating around on the Internet?�The man smiles and sees a real chance
  to totally humiliate her as her question brings out his cruel side�Yes indeed
  we e-mailed yours along with several others,not quite a minute after they were
  taken,in fact about the time the restraints were locking in place on you,your
  pictures were arriving at our client's e-mail boxes ready for viewing.�Karmal
  squirms as her body reddens more�But that
  is the only ones these pictures go to,just your clients?That can't be that
  many can it?�The man thinks to himself �Oh this is getting to be much too much
  fun.�he then replies to her questions ��Well yes initially they go to our clients
  which number well in excess of 10,000 e-mail addresses.Problem is we aren't
  able to control what the client's do with the pictursets after they receive
  them .Karmal stares at him transfixed with her feelings of total humiliation
  evidenced by her entire body turning a deep.crimson red.Karmal thinks�Well
  at least the Mexican Slaver had these pictures and videos sold in a chain of
  adult stores,this asshole is giving my pictures away for free.God knows who
  will see them!Then she has another thought born of panic�These pictures
  will look voluntary,no one will know where I am otr hat the slavers have me
  again!�The man continues �See many client's forward these to their friends
  who then pass them on to their friends and eventually these pictures wind up
  on various websites,the Usenet and other places. 
Now granted the client's who do share with their friends represent a very
  small per centage of out total clients,but like many things on the Internet,they
  do have a tendency to spread in a very short time.We estimate that only 2.5
  per cent of our clients share these picturesets,but those that do we have found
  that they forward these to 10 of their friends and that on average constitutes
  2500 of these friends receiving these pictures,if half of these friends share
  these pictures with only 5 of their friends then the pictures are being viewed
  by 12500 additional users and any of these can forward to still more friends.Karmal
  digests these news and then a welling of anger arises in her,which the man
  notices and he quickly points out'There is absolutely nothing you can do about
  it now and if you wish to call me names,go ahead,but once you do I can really
  add to your experience by either having a photographer with a digital cam to
  come in here and take all sorts of pics of you as you are now,plus numerous
  close-ups of your tits and your cunt being spread wide open and I can also
  have a webcam brought in and you will be webcast across the Internet within
  seconds with the first title being �A Live Tit Whipping� 
Karmal wide eyed considers these threats and then,thinking of some of the
  videos she was forced to make in Mexico,sighs in resignation and holds her
  tongue knowing that she is now totally under his complete and absolute control,both
  physically and mentally. 
He then makes her feel even more controlled and degraded as he tells her as
  he turns to leave the chamber�Oh and by the way,you had the highest estimated
  bid of all your group, that is you and those 6 women you saw in the waiting
  room.Your average was 3.5 million,with a broker for some pain slavers submitting
  the highest bid,#2 highest was a broker for a bdsm video producer and number
  3 was a Tile factory owner in Mexico.� 
The mention of the #3 bidder causes an involuntary �Ohhhhh Noooo� from Karmal
  and the man says�Oh and there is more news,you are being considered for slave
  training in our training facility here on the island,rather than being offered
  at the next auction.�With that he leaves the room which Karmal views with some
  relief as each time he has come in,he has somehow managed to only deepen her
  feelings of being totally humiliated and highlighting the fact that she is
  totally helpless to do one thing about it. 
Her mind races to digest all that he has told her in his last few visits and
  her first concern is the fact that the number 3 estimated bidder sounded way
  too familiar�Does he know that I am here?My God if he does,he will spare no
  expense to get me back on his hacienda again.And he will stay up nights thinking
  up things to do to me to show the others what happens to a returned escapee.Lord
  knows if anyone in this world knows how creative the Tile guy can be with these
  penalties�.�Karmal's thoughts almost stop as she another horrifying thought
  wells up inside her�What goes on in this training course?Oh my God if they
  give me something to make me talk they will know all about Mexico then!� Anger
  replaces fear as she thinks back to all she had to endure based on the word
  of one of the Mexican's handlers,who in a nutshell exercised his total authority
  over her for his own pleasure,then totally lied about 
his misuse of her.These lies of his caused her owner to sentence Karmal to
  18 months of living Hell on Earth.She thinks again of the 12 months of unedurable
  physical pain coupled with being totally humiliated and degraded mentally in
  the Punishment Unit followed by 6 months of gruelling labor in Mine #48 aka
  the Hellhole Mine. 
Chapter 5 
Karmal struggled to turn the rowing type handle that drove the auger into
  the face of the clay seam at the end of the mine she had been assigned to work
  in and as she did the sweat dripped off her naked body and formed puddles around
  her on the metal platform 
below the handle of the auger,a product of the sweltering 106 degree heat
  and nearly 100 per cent humidity of the #48 mine she had been sentenced to
  work in.As she worked she felt the grit of salt forming on her body .She had
  discovered early on that no matter how much she sweated the heat and humidity
  simply did not allow her sweat to evaporate,rather it formed a thick layer
  on her body and what drying occurred,gave rise to the fine layer of salt on
  her body.The salt was particularly irritating as it was highly abrasive to
  her underarms and the inside of her thighs. 
The # 48 mine had been nicknamed the�Hell Hole�mine by one of the mine overseers
  as it was the only mine out of the many mines on the hacienda that did not
  have a ventilation tunnel to allow cool,fresh air to flow as did the other
  mines.The overseer pointed this fact out to Karmal as he lead her through the
  entrance to the #48 mine for the first time and noticed her reaction to the
  moist heat after walking just a few feet into her assigned mine.The overseer
  had gone onto explain that #48 lacked a ventilation tunnel due to a number
  of factors that were discovered during the initial days of mining #48(1)the
  clay seams in this mine were extremely dense and unlike clay from the other
  mines tended to be the heaviest,densest clay which required an extra heavy
  auger bit. 
(2) After drying this mine's clay yielded the least dried weight of any other
  clay despite being 20 per cent heavier when mined and transported�wet�(3) This
  particular mine due to its location on the edge of an ancient fault occasionally
  had limestone boulders hidden in the clay seam and these required having to
  dig the clay from around them and then the boulder had be fractured with a
  sledge hammer and the resulting fragments had to be,loaded and hauled out of
  the mine before the clay boring could resume. The overseer indicated that the
  last 2 boulders removed from the mine both yielded about 5 tons of rock prior
  to the mine being closed and the ventilation tunnel being cancelled.He pointed
  out to Karmal that she was, according to the owner, going to be the one to
  clear any such boulders discovered while boring the clay seam. 
Karmal fumed more over the series of events that led her to being sentenced
  to work in the #48 mine and the harsh conditions the owner had imposed upon
  her as part of her sentence.She continued to turn the handle of the auger and
  as it bored deeper,the dense ,wet clay came poring out of the horizontal bore
  hole,in thick,ropy chunks,all of which Karmal will soon have to stop and then
  shovel into the mining cart and then she would have to push the mining cart
  along the small rails that were centered in the center of the steeply graded
  mine passage.Karmal was not sure if it was a blessing or a curse but the ball
  bearing equipped wheels and the tracks allowed her to get the mining cart ,which
  held 1200 lbs of wet clay, moving and as the overseer explained to her�if it
  will roll.it will move.The speed is up to you.�Getting
  the cart up the steep grade out of the mine required Karmal's pushing the cart
  and getting a running start at the level floored bottom of the mine with the
  cart's momentum allowing it it to travel up the first 100 feet or so up the
  500 foot 
10 per cent grade out of the mine.Karmal discovered on her first trip that
  the cart had to be steadily pushed forward the last 400 feet and that by digging
  her boots in between the cross ties allowed her to finally get the cart out
  of the mine. 
Clearing the mine she then had to push the cart up a small grade up to the
  main track, 
And then carefully setting the brake on the cart,she has to throw the rail
  switch in order to get the cart onto the main rail,then pushing the cart onto
  the main rail ,she again sets the brake and returns the switch to its main
  position.It only took her once that first morning for her to forget the brake
  on the cart and it rolled back at high speed to the bottom of the mine,dumping
  its contents after jumping the rails at the end of the rail.Karmal unassisted
  had to wrestle the cart back onto the rails and then reshoveled the clay and
  then fought the grade once again. 
Karmal then has to push the cart 1000 yards down the main track and then arriving
  at the unloading hopper,she secures the mining cart wheels to the dump rails
  and tips the cart's contents into the hopper,then placing the cart on a small
  siding track she then mounts the platform that is to the left of the bottom
  of the hopper and she starts turning the handle that powers the cutter heads
  to separate the clay into smaller pieces to facilitate drying. 
This effort is even more strenuous than than the auger,as the cutter heads
  themselves are several times heavier than the auger head,Karmal also discovered
  early on that the Mexican sun shined directly on this platform and removed
  any hope of cooler work. 
Karmal then descends to the cart that is prepositioned below the hopper and
  pushes the cart to the drying yard.Karmal then has shovel the processed clay
  onto the large metal sheets that cover the floor of the drying yard ,the metal
  sheets reflecting the `suns rays back upwards,makes this part of the task the
  hottest part of the job as the temperature reaches 120 degrees most days.Once
  she finishes shoveling her latest load,she checks her earlier loads to see
  if they are dry enough to deliver and finds the first load and part of the
  second have dried completely and are ready to be delivered and weighed at the
  factory. 
Karmal shovels this dried clay into the cart and then pushes the cart up a
  slight grade out of the drying yards and then has to switch the track again
  ,then she pushes the cart another 600 yards to the weigh station,Karmal is
  thankful in one way that the dried clay is much lighter than the wet clay she
  has to haul out of the mine,but she fumes at the fact that the delivered weight
  of the dried clay is the one that counts for her daily quota,this despite all
  her efforts with the heavy,wet clay. 
As she approaches the weight station she sees that there is a line of female
  slaves all waiting with their carts for their weight ticket and she fumes again
  as each cart is being pushed by two slaves who are part of of a six slave team
  assigned to other mines.While these two are delivering,the other 4 are augering
  and loading other carts,while Karmal has to perform each and every task herself
  and meet a quota way out of reason for one person.Finally she pushes her cart
  up to the scales and the overseer hands her her weight ticket, which she must
  turn in at the end of the day.The overseer says as he hands over her ticket�680
  lbs you are about 4 loads behind if you want to meet quota today.Looks like
  extra hours for you today� Then the cart is dumped and
  Karmal runs to retrieve her cart at the hopper and return to the mine as quickly
  as possible. 
She continues to fume at the unfairness of it all as she runs to the hopper,thinking
  how harsh the sentence was her owner handed down after her'hearing.,�Hearing
  right,no one heard me during all that.'As she thinks back to his words reading
  out the sentence sending her to the punishment Unit and then sending her to
  the Clay Mines with special conditions . She feels a special hatred for the
  handler that got her into this situation.She knew she would wind up in the
  Clay Mines eventually as she was able to handle far more work in the log yard
  as she shed flab and this was replaced with lean muscle,the only drawback to
  all this was the log yard overseer observing this change had continued to raise
  her quotas for both cut logs and delivered cordwood. 
While working in the log yard,she had often been told by others how much more
  demanding the Clay Mines were and the common thread repeated by many that this
  mining had to be the hardest work on Earth. 
She had trouble comprehending how this could be true, as her toils in the
  log yard took every ounce of her physical and mental strength to meet the ever
  higher quotas 
set by the overseer of the log yard, combined with a relentless schedule that
  had her 
toiling away in the log yard 16 hours a day, 7 days a week. Failing to meet
  these quotas 
resulted in her spending many an 18 hour day in the log yard with portable
  lights being brought in so that she could continue her labors up until 10 PM
  at night. The log cutting in her first days had proven to be the hardest work
  she had ever done up to that point. Then after several weeks of cutting, she
  was introduced to the even more demanding task of going back and taking the
  dried 3�foot sections she had cut and stacked earlier and splitting each 3'
  section into quarter sections. This splitting was accomplished with her using
  a 9 lb splitting maul and each 3' section required being placed into an upright
  position, then most sections required at least 3 strokes with the 9 lb maul.Karmal
  then had to stack the quarter sections on a flatbed cart which when filled
  to capacity held a &frac14; 
of a cord of this split Oak which weighed out at an average1200 lbs.Karmal,then
  had to pull each 
filled flatbed cart to the lumber racks just behind the kilns which was a
  trip of a &frac12; mile one way.Once Karmal arrived with her load ,she had
  to pull the cart onto a scale and each load was weighed and recorded with the
  net weight of the load adjusted with the weight of the cart deducted.The overseer
  was often around when she weighed in with a load and took every chance he could
  to humiliate her with remarks like�You are running way behind quota,you lazy
  bitch,I will keep you out here til I get 12 tons delivered!� The overseer required
  her to unload each piece by hand and stack it in one of the lumber racks. Then
  she had to trot back pulling the cart in order to start another load quickly
  as she could, as she calculated the fact that the 12 ton quota was going to
  require 20 round trips! 
Her only relief all day from her toils was the brief few minutes she was allowed
  to take a 3 minute water break and sometime after midday she was allowed a
  10 minute lunch break as well. These breaks she really looked forward to as
  the female assigned to 
Deliver the water and food also served as the only person that would talk
  to her 
and was Karmal's source of information and news. That situation changed after
  a few weeks when the her female friend was reassigned elsewhere, this after
  the overseer 
found out that this female was talking way too much and was even carrying
  messages 
between some of the females who were planning an escape. 
After this fact was discovered some of the male handlers took over the duties
  of escorting the female's replacement as she pulled the water cart from location
  to location.Karmal became aware of this new arrangement one morning when she
  spotted the water cart 
approaching in the distance and noticed it was being pulled by a very overweight
  woman with brown curly hair and walking beside the cart was one of the male
  handlers.As they grew closer Karmal noticed the female had a metal gag inserted
  into her mouth and was in fact blindfolded 
as well ,with the male handler guiding her as she pulled the cart. The handler
  told Karmal that the other female that delivered the food and water was caught
  talking too much and had been involved as a messenger in an escape plan and
  that her replacement was fitted out so that she would not be able to see anything
  going on or speak.�Plus,her ears are plugged as well and the owner wanted to
  sweat a few pounds off of her and get her fit enough to work in the log yard
  here.�he paused and then said �Thats gonna take awhile though, as about the
  only exercise she has been getting is running from the refrigerator to the
  couch and back.she really blew it as she was a very well kept ,rich guy's plaything 
who kept ignoring him about losng weight,then he caught her in a swinger's
  club after he returned early from a business trip.Hell he about paid the boss
  to take her off his hands.� 
Karmal looks and sees that the brown haired womn is paying the full price
  for her misdeeds as she notices the rivulets of sweat running off her huge
  breasts and huge stomach,along with her labored breathing and the twitching
  of her thigh muscles as the handler hobbles one of her too large ankles with
  a chain secured around her ankle and the other end secured around an oak log. 
Then Karmal notices the handler looking her own body over and fears what is
  coming 
next as the handler asks �I suppose you're ready for some water?� Karmal replies
  she is indeed and the handler grins and says �New policy, you get water the
  old fashioned way, you have to earn it!� with that he unzips his pants and
  Karmal gasps at the size of his already stiff cock.He orders her to her knees
  and then orders her to start sucking him.Naked,sweaty and on her knees in the
  dirt she begins and as he gets to close to climax he warns her to swallow it
  all� You waste one drop of it and its no water all day for you!� Finally he
  explodes and she desperately swallows all as her mouth and throat 
are flooded with the handler's cum.He then orders her to clean his dick up
  with her tongue and cheeks red with humiliation Karmal does as he orders. Then
  he lets her drink three bottles of water and as she drinks he tells her� You
  keep me happy and you will have all the water you want and extra food as well.
  I will have some more things I want you to do for me ,but that's enough for
  today.� 
In the days following this first incidence of having to earn her daily food
  and water, the handler would demand different things from Karmal and helpless
  and with no other options she complies with whatever he wishes, no matter how
  humiliating and degrading 
it made her feel. She was particularly humiliated when the handler brought
  some other men along and they all stared at her as he recounted her skills
  at such things as sucking his cock and gobbling down his cum.He also told them
  that her ass was nice and tight 
and assfucking her was a real trip to Heaven.Karmal soon found herself, bent
  over a large oak log with a dick her mouth, while the other men took turns
  fucking her in the ass, to add to her humiliation the men waiting their turn
  all took turns playing with her breasts, 
with several enjoying making her squeal with pain as they pinched her nipples
  as hard as they could and this soon turned into a contest to see who could
  make her squeal the loudest. Finally she protested that she had to get back
  to work and the handler told her 
to get quiet or else he would handcuff her to the winch and leave her there
  for several hours and really put her behind on her quota. Finally with all
  the men satisfied in one of several ways they leave.Karmal realizes that whenever
  they come back she will have to do whatever they want and she still will have
  to make up for lost time in meeting her quota. 
Several weeks went by and at least once a week the handler would bring his
  friends with him and Karmal would have to satisfy each of them in any way they
  designated. She dreaded these group visits as they all seemed to occur in the
  middle of the week, a day 
that was traditional for the overseer to raise her quota to even more poundage.
  The overseer started taking notice that Karmal was missing her quota on the
  same day of the week and decided to investigate the matter himself. The following
  week he watched from a concealed position and then saw the handler approach
  Karmal's work area with several other men and two women, with the much restricted
  overweight brown haired female pulling the water cart. Watching with binoculars,
  the overseer observes Karmal in a variety of activities satisfying the men.He
  then watches transfixed as Karmal is seen entertaining the men with a lesbian
  daisy chain with the two women ,as the men watch.� So that is what she is doing
  rather than splitting wood� he thinks to himself.� Well if that is what she
  wants to do I will see to it she gets plenty to keep her busy.� The overseer
  then leaves and heads back towards the Tile factory with ideas already forming
  in his head.
Sure enough Karmal fails to make her quota for the day and the next morning
  she is awakened at 4 A.M. but instead of being taken to the log yard, she is
  taken downstairs 
into the dungeon section where she was so severely tormented her first day
  there. 
Her handler leads her into a room and seated around a table are the overseer,
  and her owner-the well educated Mexican and to his left the handler from the
  water cart. 
Her owner orders her to stand quietly and reminds her she must not speak without
  first being given permission. Then he turns to the water cart handler and says� So
  she offered you sexual services in return for more water and food?� the handler
  replies� Yes she did 
and she told me that she was not getting enough sex of any type and that if
  I wish to bring some other men or women, then by all means. So I started bringing
  some of the men and once two women from the next hacienda, the ones, that is
  that helped us out with the brush fires last year and helped save the Tile
  factory. The Mexican nods and says �Well I cannot fault you for rewarding our
  friends like this and I have never minded you handlers having access to women
  like this 
as most of them are such whores anyhow.� He then turns to the overseer and
  says 
�Is Wednesday the only day she has been missing quotas?� band the overseer
  replies 
�Yes, lately just on Wednesdays. She of course missed many quotas her first
  few weeks out there, but there again I was following your orders and assigning
  her the work that 3 or 4 women in would do in a day. And of course we fed her
  as you instructed, keeping her just above a subsistence diet.� Her owner replies
  yes I see that, she has shed a few pounds over these past few months.� the
  overseer replies �Yes she has, I have really worked the flab off of her and
  what you see now is lots of lean muscle.� then snapping his fingers and indicating
  a point in front of the table, Karmal quickly complies and is standing across
  the table in front of her owner and stands up and feels her breasts and then
  has her turn around as he grasps her buttocks.�Ah yes, I see very firm in fact
  her breasts are not drooping anymore and her ass is like steel.� Then he asks
  so how much of this flab have you worked off of her so far?� consulting his
  notes the overseer says� The day she was brought in here ,she was at 155 lbs
  and now weighs 121 lbs.�. The owner thinks for a moment and then says �Very
  good indeed. However this offering sexual services business is disturbing and
  something I am not going to tolerate. She has no right using her body which
  I bought and own for her own personal gain.Alright we need to investgate further
  and then I will decide what penalties I will levy for these transgressions
  of hers.� He then calls for Karmal's handler and says take her back to her
  cell and await my call for her return. Also when she is brought back here,
  I require that she be collared, cuffed and shackled.� 
Chapter 6 
  
  The handler leads Karmal back to her cell and she slumps to the floor in
  total resignation. &nbsp;She thinks to herself, &quot;He didn't even bother to ask
  me about my version of events, and I had no right to speak. There again he
  would have taken the word of the handler over mine anyhow.&quot; She then rests
  as the minutes turn into hours. 
  
  Karmal blinks awake as the handler returns and restrains her much more securely
than she had been on the first day she was brought in. &nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Your
  owner ordered these extra restraints to be placed on you, and it has been almost
  six hours. &nbsp;It sure sounds like a long list of penalties for you!&quot; &nbsp;With
  that he places the 3-inch collar around her neck and secures both locks. &nbsp;He
  then has her turn around and, instead of handcuffs, her wrists and arms are
  secured in multi-strap arm binders; each strap having its own lock. Karmal
  feels each strap being tightened and counts six straps encircling each of her
  arms and wrists. Several of the straps press into her back, causing her to
  arch backward. &nbsp;This causes her some discomfort, as she knows that it
  now appears that she is thrusting her breasts forward. The handler secures
  sets of large shackles just above her knees and and around her ankles. 
  
  Karmal is startled when he orders her to open her mouth, and a large penis
gag is inserted and tightly secured. &nbsp;She almost gags as she adjusts to
  the size of this new restraint, which fills her mouth due to its length and
  diameter. The length extends just short of her throat. 
  
  He then takes the chain to her collar and leads her down the corridor and
  into a totally different room from the one she was taken to before. &nbsp;As the
  handler opens the door to this room, she hears the murmur of voices as if a
  large number of people are carrying on many conversations. She enters, lead
  by the trainer. &nbsp;She sees her owner, the overseer, and the water cart
  handler all seated behind a large table. She then flushes in embarrassment
  and humiliation as she sees over a hundred other people all seated about the
  room and realizes she is totally naked in a room full of clothed people. &nbsp;Instinctively,
  she starts to cover herself with her hands. As she does so, however, the straps
  of her arm binder dig into her back, forcing her to thrust her breasts out.
  She flushes red with embarrassment, causing her nipples to darken and the tips
  protrude outwards as she feels every man in the room staring at them. 
  
  Karmal is made to stand in front of the table approximately six feet away.
Once she is positioned, her owner proceeds to read, from a document in his
hands, the details of her transgressions of swapping &nbsp;sexual favors for
  extra food and water. She almost faints as he reads that a careful count was
  made, and that the other men and women present were consulted. Each sex act
  of any type counted as a major violation and entered into the penalty formulation.
  Her handler has to steady her as her knees weaken, as the numbers are detailed. &nbsp;&quot;She
  performed 78 acts of oral sex, 42 acts of anal sex, 86 acts of vaginal intercourse
  and 146 acts of allowing her breasts to be handled. &nbsp;This, in addition
  to 38 acts of lesbian sex. Any one such violation by itself calls for a severe
  penalty, and here we have 390 violations! &nbsp;In addition, due to her missed
  quotas, two kilns had to be shut down, resulting in production delays and cancelled
  orders. &nbsp;This caused a financial loss of $86,000 to the factory.&quot; 
  
  Looking up from his paper, he stares at Karmal with a glare that causes her
to hang her head in total shame. &nbsp;He then speaks again. &nbsp;&quot;Clearly
  I will not tolerate this behavior. An owned slave of mine decides, on her own,
  to share what is (in this province) my legally owned property, without my knowledge
  or consent! &nbsp;You other slaves take a lesson from this and note it carefully,
  as you will soon see that this one is going to get the fullest penalties for
  each and every violation we have counted here. &nbsp;She could have received
  worse penalties ONLY if she had escaped and then been recaptured and returned.&quot; &nbsp;
  Karmal looks up in shock and spots several female slaves watching, transfixed,
  from two rows of seats to the left. &nbsp;These slaves were all wearing clothing
  and apparently sent to observe and spread the word after the owner handed down
  his very harsh penalties. 
  
  The owner then continues his comments, which causes Karmel to scream inside
her mind with total agony and anxiety, &quot;Damnit, get on with it asshole!&quot; (A
  statement she would have blurted out had she not been so well gagged.) &nbsp;Her
  thoughts scream on as he continues addressing the audience about the fact that
  the only worse set of penalties he could impose here was in the case of a returned
  escaped slave.&quot;Get on with it damnit! &nbsp;Lordy how long is it going
  to take to announce I will be taken to the whiproom for a hundred lashes?&quot; (This
  is the penalty Karmal thinks is her most likely punishment.) &quot;Shit, this
  asshole is going to do what next? &nbsp;Read poetry?&quot; Her cockiness is
  a defense mechanism against the stress of not knowing what is on the stack
  of numbered sheets &nbsp;in front of owner. &nbsp;
  
  The owner then proceeds to announce Karmal's penalties as she hears her name
followed by &quot;hereinafter referred to as the slave.&quot; He then continues
  as he picks up the first penalty sheet and begins to read. 
  
&quot;The Slave will, at the conclusion of this sentencing, be conducted to the
Punishment Unit for a term of twelve months with the following terms and conditions...&quot; 
  
  (Karmal, had she not been gagged, would have joined the audience in the room
  with the collective outcry of shock that erupts at this announcement. The twelve
  month sentence apparently being a far longer sentence than any recent sentence. &nbsp;Several
  other slaves had told Karmal that it was the last place she would ever want
  to be. &nbsp;They had related stories of the total isolation within the unit
  and the endless torment combined to make time seem to stand still. &nbsp;The
  Punishment Unit was a sinister looking building that stood completely separated
  from the rest of the buildings in the hacienda compound. &nbsp;&nbsp;Its main
  features were the razor wire topped walls surrounding it and the windowless
  design of the exterior walls.) 
  
  The owner continues reading: 
  
&quot;(1) &nbsp;Cell - The Slave will be assigned to one of the maximum security
cells and, to avoid any possibility of escape, a titanium cage will be constructed

will remain outside the door of her cell and will, at random times, utilize the
peephole to insure her whereabouts.

  under the strictest conditions of security, will be transported to select adult
  clubs and will be required to perform on stage before live audiences with the
  express purpose of demonstrating the results of her training in the Position-Posture-Display
  Room. &nbsp;The members of the audience will be allowed, after these performances,
  to conduct hands-on inspections of any part of the Slaves's body. &nbsp;The
  Slave must answer any and all questions put to her by the audience members. 
  Failure to satisfactorily comply with any of the above will be cause for the
  Slave to have an additional six months added to her time in the Punishment
  Unit.&quot; 
  
  The owner then continues reading, after pausing for the crowd to quiet down
  as they react to the very exacting terms he has dictated for Karmal's time
  in the Punishment Unit. 
  
&quot;Now part two of the sentence: 
1. &nbsp;Commencing at precisely 4 AM  the
  morning the slave completes her term in the Punishment Unit, she will be delivered
  to Mine #48 and will be solely responsible for all clay production resulting
  from her labors in this mine.&quot; 
  
  (At this, the audience's reaction is one of collective shock at the very
  mention of Mine #48, and Karmal hears several mutter something about the &quot;Hell
  Hole&quot; mine.) 
  
  The owner continues. &nbsp;&quot;Her period of service in this mine will
    be for six months and she will be delivered to this mine to commence work
    at 4 AM , seven days per week, with her work hours being at least
  16 hours per day. &nbsp;The Overseer of mines is hereby authorized to extend
  these hours to a maximum of 20 hours per day to in order to avoid quota failures. 
  
  Conditions: 
  (A) &nbsp;The Slave will perform all tasks related to mining clay without the
  assistance of the normal complement of five other slaves. &nbsp;She alone will
  perform the boring, shoveling, transport, processing, drying. and final delivery
  tasks. 
  
  (B) &nbsp;Quota - The normal quota for a mining crew of six is 24,000 pounds
  of wet clay per sixteen-hour day. &nbsp;The Slave's delivery quota will be
  set at 4,200 pounds of dry clay &nbsp;per day &nbsp;which will require her
  to deliver to the drying yard 7,000 pounds of wet clay each day. 
  
  ( C) Motivation - The overseer of mines is authorized total authority to
  use whatever methods of motivation deemed necessary to insure a total effort
  by the slave to meet the above referenced quota. &nbsp;This includes but is not
  limited to the use of whips or crops either on a periodic basis (i.e. before,
  during or after the workday) or as deemed necessary by the overseer. &nbsp;The
  slave may be monitored and motivated during the entire 16-hour day by an assigned
  handler. &nbsp;No limit is imposed on the use of whips or crops in this instance,
  but I recommend that only those lashes necessary to accomplish the quotas be
  used . 
  (D) Food and Water - &nbsp;The slave is to receive adequate water every two
  hours during the day, and food after the completion of the first eight hours
  of duty. &nbsp;The overseer of mines is authorized to adjust the type and quantity
  of food allowed the slave during the meal period. &nbsp;Water breaks will be
  five minutes in length and the meal break will last for ten minutes. 
  (E) &nbsp;Rain - In the case of rain interfering with the drying of clay, the
  overseer will transfer the slave to the factory overseer, where she will (at
  his discretion) be assigned to perform work in the kiln room, the stacking
  room, or to any other task deemed necessary by the factory owner. 
  
  Karmal barely recalled being carried to the Punishment Unit by two handlers
  as she finally fainted after hearing the terms and duration of her sentence. 
  
  Just then Karmal is jolted back to her present situation as the door to the
  chamber swings open and the man who has been talking to her all along enters,followed
  by four men all wearing black jumpsuits.These four station themselves around
  the MRI table and Karmal then is able to see that they have a variety of restraints
  with them.The man in charge tells them 
�Secure this one real well and then take her to the auction prep rooms.� 
One of the men asks�I thought this one was headed for the Training
    Course?�The man replies�Well the higher ups decided to put her on the block
    at the next auction and offer 12 months of training as part of her purchase.That
    way we get the money a lot faster and her new owner can dictate whatever
    they like for her training program,if they choose to have her trained.�
