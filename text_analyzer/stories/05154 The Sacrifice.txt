Warning this story gets rather gorey
at the end.

&nbsp;

Author�s note: This was a short story request sent to me
by a reader.� The actual request was for
a vulture, but as vultures only eat dead flesh, I modified the concept slightly
to a giant eagle. To the reader who requested this story, I hope you enjoy it.

The Sacrifice

&nbsp;

&quot;You have been chosen.&quot;

&nbsp;

The words echoed in Choya's ears
as she was pulled from the crowd onto the platform in the middle of the
village. &quot;Choya has been chosen as this year's
sacrifice to protect our village!&quot;�
The priest raised his arms high above his head as the crowd cheered madly,
clapping and shouting encouragement to the teenager as several acolytes guided
her from her mother's side up to stand beside the priest.

� 

&quot;She will be honored in the afterlife as one of the
Chosen, a queen who braved death to protect her people and make the fields
fertile for another year!&quot;� 

� 

Again the crowd screamed and roared, while the acolytes
guided Choya to kneel before the priest, who made a
mark on her forehead in charcoal, then anointed her with fragrant oil.

&nbsp;

&quot;The time has come!�
We will guide the queen to the sky, where the gods will welcome her
home!� The giant eagle will� east tonight!&quot;

� 

Choya's mother covered her face
and wept as her daughter was stripped of her clothing, the soft leather skirt
and moccasins she had so painstakingly sewn were tossed to the crowd, who
quickly ripped them to shreds, each person wanting a piece of the leather worn
close to their queen's body as a personal talisman against evil.

&nbsp;

Shivering in the cool mountain air, Choya
tried to cover herself with her hair as the acolytes lifted her onto a chair
and carried it up the mountainside, chanting the entire way. It was a long trip
to the temple, where Choya would be prepared as a
human sacrifice to the eagle god who lived on the mountain.

&nbsp;

Once a year, the most beautiful girl in the village was
chosen to fill this position.� It was
considered a great honor, both to the girl herself,
and her family, but Choya could not help but
weep.� She'd had so many hopes and dreams
for her life, and now she'd never fulfill them. She had no choice but to walk
proudly to the eagle's eyrie and lay herself down to be his meal.

�

Arriving at the temple, the priest held out his hand to her
and smiled gently at her.� &quot;You are
to be honored, Choya.�
You will be a messenger to the gods, and will be honored as a queen to
them. Come, let us begin your preparations.&quot;

&nbsp;








It began with a bath, a long, hot soak in the hot springs
that bubbled right outside the temple door, during which she was scrubbed until
her skin glowed.� Then Choya found herself kneeling on the ground before the
priest while he again annointed her with oil and drew
designs on her naked body, dipping his fingers into red paint while she
shivered in the chilly mountain air. Finally, he took her by the wrist and
dipped her hand in the paint, then pressed it to a wall literally covered with
similar handprints.

&nbsp;

&quot;Now, as a messenger to the gods, you must take the
seed of each of the priests to the gods, so that they may remember their
faithful followers and guide us to the afterlife.� Once there, the priests become guides
themselves, guiding their people to the Valley of Eternal Summer, where the
great eagles watch over us.� Are you
prepared to fill this duty?&quot;

&nbsp;

Choya nodded mutely, and the
priest led into a large room with only a stone slab in the middle, and guided
her to bend over it.� Gently, he nudged
her legs apart with his hands, and Choya shuddered
when he poured more oil over her backside, watching it drip between her
muscular thighs, then onto the ground in� a puddle.

&nbsp;

In the Temple of the Great Eagle, there were three priests,
and they entered the room now, chanting in a low monotone, while the acolytes
quickly closed the doors behind them, so that true silence could be observed
during the ceremony. This was done to avoid sending any bad messages to the
gods.

&nbsp;

The youngest priest approached Choya
first, gently rubbing a hand up and down her slit with one hand while he freed
his organ from his ceremonial robes with the other. Quickly, he slid inside the
naked and shivering girl while she whimpered and cried on the slab.

&nbsp;

Choya knew it was a great honor to
be chosen, and she knew she would have to endure this, but to have her
virginity taken by a priest on the very day she would die was too much, and she
burst into tears as pain blossomed between her legs while the priest pumped
away, quickly blowing his load and stepping away with deep bows of gratitude to
the girl bent over before him.

&nbsp;

To keep the priest's seed inside her, a wooden ball was
pushed into her sex, then a long, sharp needle was brought forth, and the
orifice was sewn shut by the priest whose seed was contained inside while the
other two helped Choya remain still.

&nbsp;

It was over with quickly, but to Choya
it seemed to last forever, and even after the x&#8209;shaped stitches were in
place, her pussy still burned like fire.

&nbsp;

The next priest again stood behind her, and carefully
inserted a finger into her ass, wriggling it around a bit to loosen the
opening, and Choya whimpered, fearful of what would
come next. This priest was the eldest of the three, and the most experienced in
this matter, though not an old man by any means.� Gently, he loosened her ass with his fingers,
then slowly he slid his cock in, inch by inch, letting
her relax and accept him.� Once he was
fully in, he kept very still for a few moments, gently rubbing her lower back
with one hand, teasing her clit with the other. When Choya
began to respond favorably to his ministrations by sighing softly and pressing herself subtly closer to him, the priest slowly pulled his
cock almost completely out, then equally slowly pushed back in, letting her
adjust to the strange sensations.

&nbsp;








Choya gasped when the cock pulled
out of her ass, then groaned as it slid back in, resting her head on her folded
arms and waiting impatiently for him to repeat the action.

&nbsp;

He did, this time faster, enjoying the sensation of her
tight, tiny asshole around his cock. +

&nbsp;

Again, Choya gasped, then groaned,
this time, though, she pushed back at him, encouraging him to move faster.� With that cue, he did, fucking her ass hard
with one hand braced on her lower back, the other kneading her round buttcheeks while she moaned and groaned, biting her lips to
avoid saying any actual words. She came as he did, tossing her head back and
groaning loudly through gritted teeth as the priest dug his fingers into the
soft flesh on her backside.

&nbsp;

Quickly, he pulled out, and another wooden ball was inserted
into her ass, then her limp, relaxed body was held still by two priests while
the third stitched the hole shut, keeping his fluids
inside her body.

&nbsp;

The pain of the stitches in her private parts had, for a few
moments, receded as Choya's orgasm burst upon
her.� In the afterglow of pleasure, she
had hardly noticed the sharp needle stitching her asshole shut.� Now, however, she felt the burning pain of
the leather thread that held her most personal areas shut, and the strangeness
of being unable to expell the fluids and objects
contained within.

&nbsp;

She was guided to her knees as the final priest stood before
her, studying her face a moment before placing his hand on her forhead and pushing back, forcing her to open her
mouth.� Quickly, he placed his cock
inside and indicated that she should close her lips around him. The taste of
his cock was strange, but she dutifully held her lips shut around it, forming a
tight seal by sucking just slightly.� He
gripped her head and moved his hips around a bit, and her mouth was suddenly
filled with bitter, tangy fluid.� Jerking
her head back, she instinctively tried to spit it out, but a strong hand
clamped over her mouth and a second pinched her nose shut.� Quickly, Choya
swallowed the nasty stuff, making certain that none remained in her mouth.

&nbsp;

With the seed of all three priests now safely contained in
her body, there was no need to sew her mouth shut, and Choya
was led out of the room and placed upon a litter.

&nbsp;

The acolytes lifted her, chanting in their deep monotone all
the while, and she was carried out of the temple and up the mountain, high into
the clouds, until they reached the sacrificial rock.� 

&nbsp;

Glancing at the sun, the priests all smiled; it was the
perfect time of day for a sacrifice.

&nbsp;

Choya stood in the middle of the
rock, holding stock still while multiple messages to the gods were marked on
her bare flesh with fingers and blood to complete their artwork. With a few
final instructions from the priests, Choya was left
alone on the sacrificial rock, while the priests and acolytes retreated down
the mountainside to watch with the villagers. Far below her, she could hear her
people chanting and singing, and found herself
recalling all the times she'd stood below and joined in the music joyfully
while another girl had been facing her death above.

&nbsp;








Sniffling, Choya moved gingerly to
the middle of the rock and stretched out on her back, careful of her tender
privates, but determined to bask in the sun one last time. Smiling blissfully,
she actually dozed off for awhile, awakening when she found herself shivering
from the cold mountain air.

&nbsp;

At first, Choya thought it was
dark and the eagle had chosen not to appear this year.� There was always that chance,
that the great eagle would not accept her as a sacrifice and another
girl would have to be chosen.� It had
happened once, and the girl chosen had been sent home to her parents.� Sadly, the rejected girl had never recovered
from her humiliation and ended her life a few days later by flinging herself
down a well.

&nbsp;

As the seconds ticked by, Choya
came to the realization that it was not dark at all, but something massive was
blocking the sun.� Something
massive and feathered.

&nbsp;

Choya sat up with a jerk, staring
into the giant eagle's golden eye as she fearfully scooted away from him on her
backside, until she reached the edge of the boulder overlooking the crowd
below.

&nbsp;

The huge bird was larger than any animal Choya
had ever seen, big enough to easily tear her to shreds.� Gulping, and hoping death would come quickly,
Choya squeezed her eyes shut tight and clenched her
fists. With stunning speed, the giant eagle snatched her up in one massive claw
and took off in flight, spraying the sacrificial boulder and the crowd below
with Choya's blood.

&nbsp;

Groaning and crying in pain, Choya
struggled as the eagle carried her away from the rock.� His massive talons were embedded in her
shoulders, and had left deep, burning cuts along her ribcage. Blood from the
wounds trickled down her body and landed on the rocks below like gory rain.

&nbsp;

After what seemed like years to Choya,
but was likely no more than several minutes, the eagle landed onto a rocky
outcropping, a mile away from where he found her.

&nbsp;

Pinning her down with massive foot, the giant bird regarded
her with one beady eye in curiosity.�
Losing all sense of duty and religious fervor, Choya
beat upon that foot as she tried to squirm free.� With no warning, the eagle dipped his head
down and grabbed one of Choya's flailing arms in it's beak, then yanked it off in a single, twisting motion
that left the poor girl screaming for mercy and struggling like a rabbit caught
in a snare. Swallowing the arm whole, the bird dipped it's head down again,
this time the razor sharp beak latched onto one of Choya's
full, firm breasts and yanked the entire thing off her chest, swallowing the
tender flesh without lifting it's head. Now deep in shock, Choya�s
struggles slowed, the ceased, as the bird continued to tear her flesh from her
body, ripping her soft belly wide open as it feasted. 

&nbsp;

Her last impressions were of the clouds floating peacefully
above as she slid gratefully into darkness.

&nbsp;

Far below, the drums stilled as the great eagle devoured Choya's helpless body.�
The rains would come this year, and the gods would smile upon the
village once again.

&nbsp;








Finishing it's meal, the eagle
spread it's massive wings and took off in flight while below a pair of wooden
balls bounced down the side of the mountain toward the temple.
