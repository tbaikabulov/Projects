Wicker's Pub, London, 8:30 pm. April 1947.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You do know that India is half a world away, your father might be a powerful man her in England, but he can't help you if you ship off to Bombay". Said a handsome British officer sitting at the table. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mary Kelly Thatcher is a 20-something English woman, had wanderlust in her heart and a boyfriend (of sorts) in the British military that could make her desire a reality. Mary was born into the upper echelons of British society. Her father is a member of the Parliament (as was his father before him) and her mother is the granddaughter of a doctor who made an important scientific discovery, but enough about all that. Mary has always wanted to see India and she intended to pay her way there by being an English teacher. She felt it was a wonderful way to see more of the British Empire and discover her own independence. Her father of course was protective of his "little princess" and forbid her to go. So, opportunity knocks in the form of Daniel, an English officer who is leaving to India in less than 3 days. Mary is a smart girl; she knows how to use her feminine charms to get what was coming to her. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I don't need my father to protect me. I have spent my whole life living in a gilded cage, never allowed the chance to see the real world.&nbsp; I am going to be an English teacher in India, I am going to help the subjects of her majesty's empire." Said Mary.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Daniel gave Mary a knowing look, tried to suppress a smile and then chuckled.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You've hardly ever worked a day in your life, and you talk as if teaching is your second nature" said Daniel.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh don't look at me like that. So what if I want to be in parliament some day. I can't join the military as a proper soldier, so I'll serve my country abroad. Who knows, maybe I'll become England's first female prime minister, and how can I do that if all I do all day is play piano and have tea with mum and her friends while they gossip about their daughters getting married and mum giving me shameful looks". Said Mary.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Enough said. Lets just have a round shall we?" said Daniel.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mary had meet Daniel about 3 months ago. Daniel had just graduated from officer candidate school. Mary and Daniel happened to be at the same party. Daniel had just learned that he was to lead a company of soldiers into India to prevent any more anti-colonial activities. Members of Parliament and their families were at the graduation ceremony and party reception to show their support. Mary usually found military graduations boring, but she already had a plan in mind, so she surprised her father when she asked to go. Mary spotted a handsome officer and introduced herself to him. The two started having a chat, and it wasn't long before Mary starting hanging around Daniel and the two became a couple. Daniel already had a girlfriend, but it couldn't last, he was about to be sent overseas for god knew how long. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"A pint of ale and a red wine for the lady" said Daniel as the waiter came by to take their order.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The drinks came and the drinks were downed. Mary did something bold, something to send a message to Daniel. She unbuttoned the top button on her blouse. This got Daniel to raise an eyebrow. In one fluid motion, Mary leaned back, slipped a foot out of her heel and slipped it ever so slowly, but confidently between the officer's knees, massaging the inner thigh and pressing the foot a little farther forward, stopping at about half thigh. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Shall we?" asked a coy looking Mary.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Daniel stood up straight, fetched more than enough money to pay for the drinks out of his pocket, and tossed it onto the table. Daniel stood up, stepped next to Mary and offered her his hand.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Shall we?" asked Daniel.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Room 301, The 3 Sister's Inn, 30 minutes later.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Daniel fumbled with the keys. He had a girlfriend named Alice, but with Alice being busy with nursing school (not to mention committed to waiting until after marriage for sex for religious reasons) and he with the military academy, they were apart more often than together. He was about to be sent to a country he had never been to and was not even sure if he would fancy Indian women. Tonight he has a fetching young lady fishing in his pants, who is he to complain.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mary led Daniel to the bed, gave him a peck on the lips and gently pushed him onto the bed. She started with a little strip tease. She took her time unbuttoning the blouse, even slower with lowering the skirt. She worked hard to look good for him and he was going to appreciate it. Mary Thatcher grew up never knowing a hard life. Sure, she had a few scares during WW2, even having to stay in the cellar during the worst of the Nazi air raids. She looked good, real good, like you could eat-her-with-a-spoon-good. She had smooth skin, baby soft hands, nice firm tits from being able to afford the best undergarments (even when much of England had to forgo many luxuries during the war) and her cute face was framed with flowing golden curls. Daniel was use to dating working-class women who wore patches on worn overalls and had rough hands from days of hard work. Mary was a shiny shilling, among so many wooden nickels.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mary removed her undergarments and tossed them across the room, not even caring where they landed. Daniel was already stripping his cloths off. Mary stepped close to Daniel and pressed his face to her breasts, they were soft and perky. He breathed in her intoxicating perfume. Daniel was reaching for his penis, to rally his trooper. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Allow me officer," said Mary seductively.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mary bent down and gave the officer four kisses on the tip of his cock. His little soldier rose to full salute and was more than ready. Mary took Daniel's cap and put it on. Mary put her hands on her hips and did a little cabaret dance.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Will you take this fine young lass to India" sang Mary in a singsong voice.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh Bloody hell, now is not the time to discuss that," said Daniel, standing up.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Then off, off I go, and good luck getting into the knickers of your virgin nurse," sang Mary.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Fuck it, alright. I'll get you aboard, I'll say you're my fianc�" said Daniel.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mary took the cap off her head and held it over her bush, swinging her hips side to side.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Damn right you will soldier boy" said Mary with a wink.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mary threw the cap aside and jumped into Daniel's arms and wrapped her legs around his waist. Daniel took a few steps back and when he made contact with the bed, landed on his back on the well-used mattress. Kelly got up on her knees and was leaning forward with her open palms on his chest, not unlike a tigress pose. Kelly leaned back letting her nails slide against his abdomen. Mary's butt stopped its slide when it tapped Daniel's boner. Mary put a hand to her lips and had a mock surprise look on her face. She dropped the charade and gave Daniel a seductive look.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mary lifted herself and then impaled her womanhood onto Daniel. She rode him, changing her pace to stretch out what turned out to be a great fuck. Mary had a earth shattering orgasm and then she collapsed beside Daniel. The couple was spent, but Mary was far from done. She got back on her knees and stuck her tongue out. She moved her head until the tip of her tongue landed just beneath Daniel's Adam Apple. She crawled backwards so that her tongue left a nice wet streak right between where she slid her nails about 8 minutes ago. Mary moved in a slow reverse until her breasts were on either side of Daniel's now flaccid penis. Mary used her tits to massage the penis, allowing her nipples to tickle his pubic hair. It wasn't long before his trooper was ready to fire again. Mary lowered her head and swallowed the whole cock. She pulled her mouth out, tilted her head to the side and did a maneuver Daniel had never seen before, it was if Mary's tongue was a dancer and his penis was a prop. Daniel shot his second load, some got in her hair, but mostly it got on him. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What the hell do you call that?" asked Daniel.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I call it 'what I can do for you in India' if you make arrangements for me to stay in the officer apartments" said Mary.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Daniel paused for a second, contemplating the repercussions if the military were to find out that he lied about Mary being his fianc�, allowing her to stay in the officer apartments (much nicer, than say what a English teacher could get on her own, in such short notice) and yet the whole fianc� story being a fabrication.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Next time we do this, I'll swallow your load" said Mary seductively in his ear.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Daniel settled in by grabbing some smokes from his jacket. He lit up and considered what was being offered. He loved being an officer in the British military and he wanted nothing more than to do his duty, but what about his needs? It would be one thing to say that she is his fianc�, and if she wanted to split and carry on by herself, that's fine. He could say she ran off. But now she wants to stay in the officer apartments, but what if his mates caught on that its all a sham? He could get a dishonorable discharge. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Tell you what I'll do, the men that can afford to bring their wives or girlfriends with them, are putting them up in a rather nice apartment in Bombay. It's as comfortable as an apartment as your going to find, and you won't be disturbed by drunk soldiers and half of the British army trying to spy on you while you take a bath" said Daniel.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Your such a smart bloke. Don't worry, I'll pay you back the rent with my teacher salary" said Mary.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"And what will you tell your parents? That you just decided to piss off for a year?" asked Daniel.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"No, I already told them I'll be studying abroad, in America," replied Mary.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"And why did you tell them a load of rubbish like that?" asked Daniel.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"So that my father will give me an advance of my trust, to pay for my little trip. Plus I've been pretending to have an interest in American art, so it seems natural I'd want to go to the USA" said Mary.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"And how do you know you'll even be able to find a teaching job in India?" asked Daniel.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"One of my lady friends is teaching there now. I've been corresponding with her. She says there is an opening now for a teacher. Plus name dropping never hurt anyone," said Mary.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Daniel took a puff from this cigarette. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"You have this thing all figured out don't you?" asked Daniel. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I sure do" said Mary.

 Military harbor in South England. Pier 14 HMS Wellington. 2 days later. 2:00pm

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Daniel and Mary had arrived at the pier. Daniel looked all the bit of the dashing officer and Mary had just a hint of a fianc� with a forged document. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Are you ready to do this, its not too late to back out now?" asked Daniel.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"It's no use trying to talk me out of it now" said Mary.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Daniel bent over and gave a Mary a peck on the cheek. Daniel reached into his pocket and handed Mary some documents. It was her boarding pass and the necessary papers to verify they were in fact engaged. Mary even had time to buy them both engagement rings so that they looked the part. Daniel called over a young soldier who bore the same insignia that Daniel wore, indicating that they were part of the same platoon, and the rank badge identified the young man as a private.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"My good man, be so kind as to carry the ladies luggage, she'll be traveling with me" Ordered Daniel to the soldier.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The soldier turned to Daniel, recognized him as his superior officer and obliged. Mary turned to Daniel and smiled, she appreciated the service she was getting. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I'll take this as a sign, that going to India will be the best decision I've made yet" said Mary. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The HMS Wellington was a large ship and gave a pleasant cruise to India. Mary Thatcher was part of a exclusive group of ladies that were attached to officers (the only ones that could afford to bring their ladies with them in a proper fashion) and got the pleasure of not only seeing another part of the world, but were guaranteed a certain standard of living, as they were seen as primarily British citizens and ambassadors of good will. If an officer brought a lady with him, she stayed in first class accommodations and got to eat fresh fish for dinner on the first night. If a soldier of lower rank brought his girlfriend with him, she was assigned some duty, such as kitchen work as a means to pay for the passage. Mind you, if this were a true war, women would not be going along. This is closer to a police action, soldiers being sent to the Indian colony, to suppress some rabble-rousers that want Independence. Rumors were going around that there was some chap named Ghandi and he is trying to lead the Indian people to Independence. Kelly was too busy playing shuffleboard and sipping wine to care about politics. A few days slipped by and the Wellington made port in Bombay harbor. 

Bombay, West India. A week later.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mary Kelly had settled nicely into her new apartment (It was about as close to a middle class apartment in London as one could get out in India). On her second night, Mary had dinner with her friend who was already living and teaching In India. Mary landed the teaching job she desired. She attended a few information sessions, was given a tour of the school she'd be teaching at. Mary's sixth day In India was going to be her first day of teaching. She had written a letter to her parents, saying how wonderful it was to be in America (she cleverly wrote a return address with a fake America address). She sealed her letter and was going to drop it off on her way to class. She had the letter in hand and a bag of teaching supplies in a bag slung around her shoulder. Mary left her apartment, locking the door behind her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mary walked to the receptionist of her apartment building and made eye contact with the man behind the counter.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Excuse me, I'm afraid I'm not familiar with the postal system in India. Would you be so kind as to drop my letter off for the postage?" asked Mary.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;An overweight man with a black mustache grinned at Mary, with his eyes almost popping out. Mary was sure she did not like how this man was looking at her, as if she was tonight's main course.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Of course, leave it with me, and I will take care of it" said the man.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mary noticed the man's nametag. It said "Novi". Mary held the letter out. Novi reached out, gently grasped her slender wrist for just a second and then proceeded to retrieve the letter by sliding his hand from her wrist to the letter. It was quite the uncomfortable experience. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"One more thing, ma'am" said Novi.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes? I am in a bit of a hurry". Asked Mary.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"My name is Novi, may I ask your name?" asked Novi.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"......My name is Kelly, does that satisfy you?" asked Kelly.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"It does, good day Ms. Kelly" said Novi.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mary waved good-bye, left the apartment building and caught a ride on a bike drawn taxi and rode for 5 minutes, she had the pleasure of her apartment being near the school she taught at. She was looking forward to teaching her first class. Mary would be teaching English and Poetry in a class of pupils ages 15-17 in the morning. The school campus was spotted with white buildings and a tall flagpole in the center courtyard, with the British Flag, of course. Mary had the radio tuned to a British station while she was getting dressed this morning. There was more talk about the pro-independence movement and how more Indians were resisting the British occupation of India. Mary dismissed it as a bunch of rubbish and thought about polite school children and the sound of reciting poetry.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mary went straight to her classroom, she arrived 5 minutes early and some of the students were already there. Mary took her seat at the desk at the head of the room and pulled some grammar books out of her bag. The rest of the students came in before the bell rang to announce the first class of the day. Mary's classes went swimmingly. The students were polite and she felt she was connecting with her students. However, two weeks into the term she had a problem with one student. A young man who sat off to the side had not participated once in class since the start of the semester. She asked the student what his name was. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"His name is Sandeep" said the girl sitting next to Sandeep.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Thank you, but I would like Sandeep to speak" said Mary.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mary asked the boy again what his name was, and he said nothing. Mary walked over to Sandeep and leaned over him, repeating her question. He said nothing and the class laughed. Mary realized if she didn't do something, she was about to lose the respect of the classroom. Mary told Sandeep that as punishment for not participating in class, he was to stay after so she can speak to him about the importance of proper behavior. Sandeep did something no one was expecting (except for maybe Sandeep himself) he slapped Mary across the face, the sharp sound of the slap echoed in the silent room. Everyone except Sandeep had a surprised look on his or her face. Mary grabbed Sandeep by the shoulder.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"What is the meaning of this?" asked Mary. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sandeep said nothing. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"The class is in recess for 15 minutes, during that time all students must stay on the campus. Sandeep, you must come with me" Said Mary.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mary escorted Sandeep to the administration office. Mary explained to a clerk what happened and requested the phone number of Sandeep's parents for the purpose of arranging a teacher-parent conference. Mary got the phone number and used the phone and called Sandeep's house and his mother picked up the phone. Mary was not sure if she should convey her anger over the phone, or if it would be more effective to keep her professionalism so as to come across sincerely. Mary was filled with anger, but there was something about speaking to Sandeep's mother that calmed her down. She spoke confidently and agreed to meet Mary for a teacher-parent conference tomorrow at 6pm. Sandeep's mother suggested she drop by Mary's apartment, which caught Mary by surprise, but was put into a corner when Mrs. Javi (Sandeep's mother) reminded that Mary requested the meeting and felt that the privacy of an apartment was more appropriate that the prying ears of students and teachers at the school. Mary agreed, at least this way she can get the mother on her side. The conversation ended and all seemed well.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mary led Sandeep back to the classroom. The students came back within the time they were given and class continued. Mary finished that class, taught another class (a different group of students) then it was lunchtime. Mary found a nice little bistro near the school to eat at. Mary taught two more grammar classes by the end of the day. Mary's head was spinning by 3:45 pm. She was overwhelmed, a lot happened on this particular day. The last group of students had left and Mary was sitting at her desk making plans for tomorrow's lesson, she was alone. Just before 4 pm Sandeep and three other young men walked in with him. Mary noticed the boys were tall and strapping, perhaps they excelled at sports? 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Can I help you?" asked Mary.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sandeep stood near Mary's desk and one of the other guys retrieved the Union Jack that was hanging on the wall and dropped it in the trashcan.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Excuse me? Do you think this is funny? Pick that up and put it back where it belongs." Said Mary walking over to that boy.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"But it is where it belongs" said the boy who dropped the flag in the trash.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mary repeated her demand and the young man just stared at her. Mary raised her hand to slap the boy, but another one of the boys grabbed her arm in mid back swing.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mary is a more petite than average woman, whereas Sandeep and his 3 friends were strong young men, they all appeared to be about 16-17-ish. Mary was slightly intimidated; any of these men had more muscle mass than she and was clearly outnumbered. Out of the corner of her eye, Mary noticed that Sandeep nodded toward Mary and snapped his fingers, as if he was speaking in code. Two of the young men, stood on either side of Mary, grabbed and arm, led her to her desk, and then pinned her down. Mary was now on her stomach, her arms firmly pinned on either side of her and her short legs were hanging a few inches above the floor. Mary tried kicking furiously, but to no avail, she was at the mercy of her boy captors.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sandeep shut and locked the classroom door. Mary was swearing at Sandeep, demanding that he either let her go or she'll yell for help.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well, I don't want you doing that, we'll remove your socks and stuff them in your mouth" said Sandeep.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It dawned at Mary, she was in a real predicament. Wait a tick. She was the authority figure here. Mary let out a scream, but Sandeep was already facing her, and he cracked a hard slap across Mary's face, this time leaving a bright red mark. Mary was seething with rage. She had to figure a way out of this situation. Sandeep walked to the front of the desk, near Mary's legs, took off her shoes and then socks. He balled the socks up, walked back to face Mary and then stuffed them into her mouth. Sandeep pulled open a drawer, found some adhesive tape. He wrapped tape around Mary's head, to hold the sock in place. Even if Mary could scream, all the teachers had left some time ago. Some of the teachers had second jobs or had to do shopping for supper. Mary was the new teacher, so no one even noticed she was still at the school. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Mary, you are here by charged for crimes against India. You are found guilty of being an imperialist pig of the British Empire. The evidence against you is your pathetic charade as an English teacher and the fact that it is nothing more than a disguise for your own selfish desire to white wash India. You will also be punished for attempting to slap an Indian student. How do you plead?" asked Sandeep.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mary muffled something. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Ah, the accused admits her own guilt and accepts the justice of this court," said Sandeep.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mary muffled a very loud protest, as load as one can protest with 2 socks and tape in their mouth. The socks on Mary's mouth were particularly sweaty and were making Mary both very thirsty and a little sick from both the foul taste and the humiliation she was feeling. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"The court hereby determines that your punishment will be 339 spanks, one for each year the British Empire has controlled India. Do you willingly accept the judgment of the court?" asked Sandeep.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mary tried to yell again, this time kicking her legs as hard as she could. Her knee made particularly hard contact with the desk, hurting her knee and causing her struggle to become meeker. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"The defendant accepts the wisdom of the court and recognizes that she does indeed deserve the punishment that is about to delivered," said Sandeep.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mary's eyes grew wide. Were the boys really about the give her 339 spanks? 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Vamsi, please begin spanking Ms. Mary Thatcher" said Sandeep, referring to the young man that was currently unoccupied. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Vamsi stood behind Mary. He got a hold of the waistband of Mary's skirt and panties. He slowly pulled them down. Mary shivered when the cool air touched her white bottom. Vamsi pulled them down and let them to rest when the waistbands were settled at Mary's knees. Mary tried to fight, she was so scarred that she fought for a whole minute, her butt in the air. She was helpless and now very tired. Vamsi slipped on a leather glove on his right hand. Vamsi called out the spanks.

1...2...3...10....15...20...32....40...50...&nbsp;&nbsp; Vamsi took his time with each spank, making sure that each blow landed solidly. Mary's butt jiggled a little with each slap.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Make sure to spank all of her ass. You have 339 spanks total, there is no reason her whole ass shouldn't be red," said Sandeep.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It took 12 minutes to deliver all 339 spanks. Mary made eye contact with Sandeep up until spank 199. At that point, Mary was crying from the pain and had lowered her eyes shame. Sandeep wasn't satisfied with Mary looking helpless, she needed her to feel helpless. Long before Vamsi reached spank number 339, Mary's body laid limp as a fish. Sandeep got excited watching the spectacle. While the other boys agreed to help Sandeep because they liked the idea of hazing a British person who occupied India, Sandeep got turned on by the whole experience. Vamsi took his glove off and sat down to rest his arm. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sandeep looked up at the clock, it was 4:17pm. Sandeep and his friends agreed it was time to go and they did. 
Once the boys left, Mary feebly got up. Her ass was sore. She was spent and had little strength left, so she laid on her desk and rested. She managed to slip her panties and skirt back in place. Mary slowly lowered her ass, but afraid to put too much weight on it; still red hot from the bombardment of spanks. She worked furiously to remove the tape. Once she did, she pulled the socks out. And then she just laid there, for about another 10 minutes to regain herself. Mary felt just like the Union Jack that was tossed into the trash, manhandled with extreme prejudice. 

5:10 pm

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mary soaked in her tub. She was sobbing slowly to herself and scrubbing herself off. She was physically abused today and yet there were no witnesses to defend her, but there were four boys who could play innocent about their crime. Mary struggled to settle her sore bum into the tub. Each time her arse made contact with the floor of the tub, she felt a sting of pain instantly. She felt something else. Mary felt an itching in her womanhood, something burning inside. She started by massaging her breasts and it felt good. This gave her the comfort to settle into the tub. She played with her nipples and closed her eyes and the pain in her ass went away. Her hand slid down the front of her abdomen, and slipped between her inner thigh, and she let her fingers flirt around. Mary let out a sigh of relief and soaked in the erotic pleasure, and then she had a rude awakening. How could she be so turned on? Earlier that day she was spanked and humiliated and now she was turned on. She felt guilty for feeling pleasure when not long ago she was ravished. Shame on her for feeling this way. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mary held onto her anger as long as she could, but then she felt herself relaxing, feeling aroused. She gave into her carnal desire and masturbated. She was turned on by Vamsi's firm hand, she let out a sigh thinking about how she laid there helpless as Vamsi pulled down her skirt. Mary didn't know why she felt this way, but she didn't care. Admitting she was strangely but potently aroused at the moment helped her relax and enjoy a nice orgasm. Mary finished cleaning herself, dried off and put on a robe. Mary made herself a stiff drink and stayed up reading a novel before going to bed.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mary woke up and greeted the morning with a stretch. She managed to get dressed, reminding herself that this evening she was going to be meeting Sandeep's mother. She still wasn't sure how to tell the mother of one of her students, that Sandeep had abused her. How could a mother ever comprehend their own flesh and blood had committed such an act. What's done is done, if Mary cannot get through to Mrs. Javi, Mary might have to consider teaching at another school, and she didn't think she could bring herself to teach at a school with such negative memories.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mary grabbed her teaching supplies, left her apartment and got as far as the receptionist desk.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Excuse me Ms. Kelly, are you alright? Yesterday afternoon, you were walking funny, I wanted to ask if you were okay then, but you looked like you were in a hurry to get to your apartment" said Novi.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mary stopped in her tracks and looked over at a sheepish looking Novi. She figured he meant well, but she really didn't want to make friends with Mr. Novi. He was overweight and his breath smelled of fried food and warm beer. He wore a white shirt that had obvious sweat stains under the arm pits and Mary could not tell if his mustache was over grown or if that was just the style for men his age. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I'm fine now, thank you for asking," said Mary.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mary spotted the letter she had asked Novi to send out two weeks ago.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"That's my letter, why has it not been sent out?" asked Mary.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Novi picked the letter up and offered it back to Mary.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"The letter had the incorrect return address, I thought about returning it to you, but it had your perfume scent on it" said Novi while sniffing the envelope and then handing it to Mary.


 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Bloody hell, two weeks go by and my letter has not been sent out, because the receptionist is too busy wanking to my perfume scent" Mary thought to herself. She'll just have to find a post office to send it from. No worries. Mary took the letter from Novi. Once the letter was in Mary's hand, Novi reached out and gently caressed Mary's hand. For a moment, the two stood there. Mary blushed crimson while her thin wrist was enveloped by a snarl of Novi's hairy fingers. Mary blushed because she almost....no she did enjoy it, but that's impossible Mary thought to herself, she sees him as a ugly oaf of a man. She had to focus to pull her hand away, giving a deliberate sour stare toward Novi for his actions. His response was to grin back. Mary did and an about face and marched out of the building at off to work. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mary taught her classes and the day went without a hitch. She didn't see Sandeep in class today, or at least did not notice him. She almost missed him, as if you saw someone who you thought was an old friend from a distance only to get closer and realize it's a stranger. Why was she missing him? She gave her own arm a squeeze to remind herself that she should not be feeling that way. When lunchtime rolled around, she bought her meal from the local market and found it tasty. After lunch, she taught her last classes of the afternoon. She didn't feel like sitting around her apartment waiting for Mrs. Javi to show up at her apartment, so she decided to walk around the campus. She toured the library, she spoke with the other teachers, and she spotted some students reading under trees and asked about what they were reading. She felt good again; Mary was once more the captain of her own destiny. She realized she had worked up a sweat with all the walking about and decided to take a shower in the female locker room.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mary found the locker room to be pleasantly unoccupied. Mary smiled when she noticed the clean towels and bars of soap sitting near the shower entrance. How civil of them she thought. She undressed, put her things in a locker and stepped into the shower. Mary felt good, the cold water rinsing off the stress of the day, the soap washing away an unwanted stench caused by walking up too many steps on the school campus. When Mary's shower was over; she stepped away from the shower stalls, grabbed one towel and started to dry herself off. She sat down on the bench near her locker and started getting dressed. Her solitude was interrupted when two young women walked in who were gossiping to each other. They walked to another part of the locker room, and seemed to hardly notice Mary. One of the ladies lit a cigarette and started talking.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Did you hear? Sandeep and his friends spanked one of the teachers, I think it was a British woman." asked the smoking woman.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Oh, I did hear he had plans to do it, how do you know he really did it?" asked the other girl.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well, remember when we were walking down the hallway yesterday, and we saw Sandeep shutting that classroom door and lock it? That was because they were spanking that British woman," asked the smoking girl. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The two girls laughed, they tried to muffle their mouths with their hands, but they definitely found the story funny. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Have you told anyone about this?" asked the non-smoking girl.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Of course I did. I was just telling a group of my classmates about it right before I meet up with you." Said the smoking girl. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mary heard enough; She grabbed her bag of teaching supplies and ran out of the locker. She was so mortified, she didn't even bother to call a taxi, she just walked and sulked home. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The time for Mrs. Javi appointment arrived and there was a knock on the door. Mary answered it. She saw an attractive, Indian woman with Sandeep, who was carrying a large bag. Mary was happy to see the woman, but her smile faded away when she said hi to Sandeep, her day was going so well.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well, of course I had to bring my son, how else would you know I am really Sandeep's mother? Aren't you going to ask me in?" asked Mrs. Javi.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Of course, of course" said Mary, backing up to allow Mrs. Javi to enter.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mrs. Javi filled the room with confidence. Mrs. Javi is an American educated lawyer, she had to take time off for maternity leave when she was pregnant with Sandeep, but as soon as Sandeep was in school; she was able to quickly regain her status in the top of her field. Mrs. Javi was perhaps short in stature, but she was sharp and a giant of an intellectual. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mary led Mrs. Javi and her son into the small living room and they all took a seat (there happened to be the exact number of chair necessary).

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I want to thank you for coming to see me, I'm sure your busy, so I hope you don't mind if I get straight to the point." Said Mary.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Not at all" said Mrs. Javi.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mary smiled and opened the conversation about she felt that Sandeep seemed uninterested in class and how she was concerned with his behavior. Mrs. Javi listened politely. Mary was in the middle of talking, and noticed that Mrs. Javi nodded toward Sandeep. Mary felt d�j� vu, was that nod some kind of communication, like a code for something?

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Excuse me, is everything alright?" asked Mary.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mrs. Javi turned to Mary and smiled, giving Mary her undivided attention once again. Mary spoke more assertively so as not to lose Mrs. Javi. Mary did not notice that Sandeep has walked behind Mary, took a cloth and a bottle of chloroform and poured some chloroform into the cloth. Sandeep used one of his strong arms to put Mary in a headlock and used the hand on the other arm to press the chloroform soaked cloth to Mary's face. Mary kicked and struggled, but this only made her breath more rapidly and therefore inhale the chloroform all that much faster. Mary was knocked out before long. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mrs. Javi and Sandeep worked quickly to carry Mary's unconscious body to her bedroom. Sandeep went to work with a knife to start cutting through her clothes, stripping her bare. Mrs. Javi took out and set up a tripod and camera in the middle of the bedroom. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I'll go get the others, I'll be waiting outside the door" said Mrs. Javi, taking notice of Mary's very sexy body.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mrs. Javi new about what Sandeep and his friends did to Mary Kelly yesterday and she approved. Mrs. Javi hated the British that occupied her country and loved the idea of one of their own being humiliated. Mrs. Javi stepped out of the apartment and gave the thumbs up to the ten young men standing in the hallway. Sandeep decided to invite some of his friends along; they waited outside the building and then moved into the hallway fifteen minutes after Sandeep and his mother walked into the building. Ten young men, schoolboys between the ages of 15-18 eagerly walked into the apartment and went straight toward the open bedroom door. The smiled when they saw a very naked and very unconscious white woman on the bed. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Her she is boys, if you want to shag this bitch, it'll cost you three days worth of lunch money" said Sandeep.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That's right. Not only was Sandeep going to bring his teacher down a notch; he was going to make some money in the process. Ironically, as much as Sandeep hated the British for occupying India, he loved British music. He already had plans to buy a London Orchestra record. 20 years later he would become a fan of the Beatles, and be a British educated lawyer.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One boy came into the room at a time and shut the door behind him. Each boy handed Sandeep some money, undressed and, well, call it rape, call it fucking a sleeping woman, call it whatever you want, but it was sex as far as these boys were concerned. Mary's unconscious body flopped around during each sex session. Some of the boys were particularly well hung and Mary grunted when the big cock was shoved inside her.&nbsp; Sandeep was taking pictures with the camera. The boys hardly cared that their pictures were being taken, one of the boys asked if he could get a print for himself, Sandeep assured him he would. Some of the boys only bothered to take off their trousers and kept their school uniform shirt on when they fucked Mary. This meant that the school logo on the shirt would be visible in the picture. All eleven boys got to fuck Mary. Sandeep fucked her last, but no one took his picture. Sandeep got dressed and called all the boys in, he would have one or two of the boys get into the room, sometimes standing Mary up on her knees, or posed to be kneeling and bending at the waist, like giving a blow job, Mary looked like she was participating in the act. Sandeep noticed that Mary had a distinct birthmark on her left shoulder blade, and made sure the camera got a clear shot of it in many of the pictures. The boys would make "oh my god" facial expressions to be silly and this made it look as if they were forced into bed with Mary against their wills in the photos.&nbsp; Many pictures were taken. All of which were incriminating snap shots. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The orgy was done and everyone was patting each other on the back. Sandeep made a good chunk of change and eleven boys were made into men. Sandeep's friends left the apartment and thanked Mrs. Javi on their way out, as if leaving an innocent birthday party. Sandeep gathered up the remaining shreds of the clothes that Mary was wearing that evening. Sandeep went to the receptionist desk and thanked Novi for asking people not go near the hallway where Mary's apartment was (Sandeep spoke to Novi just before he went up to Mary's apartment). Sandeep gave Novi Mary's torn clothes as a reward
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mrs. Javi went into Mary's bedroom and Sandeep joined her. The two of them got the rope out of the bag. Mrs. Javi and Sandeep went to work tying Mary up, real tight. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Let's get those pictured developed right away" said Sandeep.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Absolutely, and then deliver a copy to the police" said Mrs. Javi.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mary woke up about two hours after Sandeep and his mother tied her up. The first thing she noticed was that she was naked, second bound in tight ropes. Her hair was matted to her face with some sticky substance, but could not tell what it was. The last thing she remembered was that she was talking to Mrs. Javi and then she was knocked out. What happened? She remembered a cloth being pressed over her face. But why was she naked and tied up? Where was she? The room was dark because no one left a light on and the curtains were closed. Her eyes adjusted to the dark and she realized she was in her bedroom. She tried to scream, but her long and matted hair was clumped in her mouth and her hands were not free, so she had to way to clear her mouth. Mary pathetically tried to struggle to get out of the ropes.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sandeep and his mother took the camera to a nearby photography store; Sandeep bribed the technician to make his film a priority. Sandeep got the first set of prints in less than two hours. Mrs. Javi thanked the technician, put the photos in an envelope and took them straight to the Indian police. She made sure not to go to the British police, as they would have sympathy for Mary. Sandeep stayed behind at the photo store to order three more sets for himself and his friends. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mrs. Javi is a well known attorney, so the police did not question Mrs. Javi when she showed up with an envelope of pictures depicting a British teacher having sex with schoolboys, her own students no less (a police investigation quickly proved that the boys in the pictures were indeed enrolled in Mary Kelly's class, and the school logos on the shirts were further proof of this). The police were shocked, not just because the crime was sexual in nature, but the sheer audacity of it. A British teacher corrupting her own students, the police knew the British could be rude, but this was unheard of. The police wasted no time in speaking with the boys in the pictures. The police knew that the boys might be embarrassed if they were confronted directly about being sexually abused by their teacher. The police officers spoke to the boys at school the next day. An Indian police officer asked each boy if they were sexually abused by Mary Thatcher, and each one said they were. The officer thanked the boy for their honesty. The next step of the investigation was to talk to Mary, but she was not at the campus. The police did an investigation into the records department for a British teacher named Mary Thatcher that arrived from England during the year. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The police found Mary in her apartment, still tied up a day later. She was tired, dirty and very thirsty. She was grateful to be untied and allowed an hour to take a shower, get dressed and have some tea before she was escorted to the police station. The police found it suspicious that Mary could not recall who tied her up and how she seemed to conveniently forget all the events of the last 24 hours. The police never told Mary why they came to her apartment, rather she expressed that she believed that they were there to look for the person who tied her up, and they allowed her to believe that until they got her down to the police station. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Thank you so much for rescuing me from my unfortunate situation" said Mary.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"And Thank you for coming down to the station so that we can ask you some questions" said the Indian officer, sliding an envelope toward Mary.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mary picked up the envelope and took its contents out; She could not believe her eyes. Mary's mouth dropped when she saw photos of herself, naked and in bed in sexual poses with boys, some wearing the school uniform shirt of the school she taught at.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Tthhaaaats impossible, this is not me. I would never have sex with school children, not in a hundred years. This is a scam! Who did this? Are you looking for the pervert that tied me up?" asked Mary hysterically, pounding her fists on the table.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"There is no point in denying anything, you are without a doubt the woman in these photographs. The police noticed a very peculiar shaped birthmark on your left shoulder when they found you in your apartment and it matches the birthmark in the photo. How do you explain that Mary Thatcher?" asked the officer.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mary stood up, shoved the photos off the table, and yelled accusations at the police department for framing her and for being too incompetent to catch the individual that tied her up. The officer asked Mary to control herself, but Mary carried on with her ranting and raving. Two other police officers carried the hysterical Mary Kelly away to a holding cell. The officer that was just talking to Mary calmly picked the photos off the floor and started to file the paperwork for charges against Mary Kelly. Mary was being charged with abusing her position as a teacher to corrupt her students. A thorough police investigation discovered that the documents she used to get into India were forged and she was never the fianc� of a British officer. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;In better times, Mary would have received a quick and fair trial, however India was in the midst of an Independence movement and most Indians, including court officials were busy with politics and getting involved in the struggle for Indian sovereignty from the British. The British Empire were rapidly losing control of India, so its understandable why it was quite some time before anyone had time to deal with a British teacher who not only sexually abused her own students, but had also used forged documents to come into India. British officer Daniel was given a dishonorable discharged from the military as soon as it came to light he lied about being engaged to Mary Thatcher and assisted Mary in acquiring false documents. Daniel didn't even know that Mary was in jail. He didn't want to embarrass himself and tell her he was discharged, so he caught the first ship to England without attempting to say bye to Mary. &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

Bombay. September 1947. One month after India becomes independent from England.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mary had spent less than six months in her jail cell. It was a 6' X 8' stone cell with iron bars. It had one small 8-inch square window with bars. Last month Mary looked out of it and noticed that the courthouse across the street lowered the British flag and raised the Indian flag. That was all Mary needed to see. She was a citizen of the British Empire; she had rights as long as she was within that empire. Mary was in India, far from the British Empire. Mary knew something was wrong when she asked to see a lawyer twice a day and the few clerks and officers in the police station just ignored her, as if she was just a throw away criminal. It didn't take the lowering of the Union Jack to tell her that England was no longer the lord of India. She was at the mercy of Indian law. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mary Kelly got her day in court. She was the defendant and the prosecutor had several charges against her. Mary did not know legal jargon and felt confused during the trial. Mary was put on the stand and the prosecutor asked her if she had sex with any of her students, she of course said no. The lawyer quickly put copies of the photos of her having sex with boys in front of her. Mary tried to deny it, but the lawyer made some argument with her with more legal jargon. Mary got silent and said she was done. Ten boys were put on the stand, one at a time. The prosecuting attorney asked each boy individually as they were put on the stand if they had sex with Mary Thatcher, the questions were phrased to suggest they were forced against their wills, and of course each one said yes. When the prosecutor asked each boy (individually) could identify the woman that abused them, they pointed at Mary Thatcher. The whole courtroom gasped each time. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mary did not know that Daniel had left India nor was any longer a British officer. Mary asked to have Daniel talk in her defense. The next day, in trial, Mary repeated her request and the judge informed Mary (and to the entire court room, so he didn't have to repeat himself later) that he inquired about her Daniel, the judge discovered that he had been given a dishonorable discharge from the British military and had left India several months ago. The jury laughed when they heard this. Mary's lawyer made a heartfelt argument in her defense, but dodged crucial issues like the photos and the schoolboys testifying against Mary. It was doubtful that Mary's lawyer could say anything that would win her favor with the jury. 
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To no one's surprise, Mary was found guilty on all charges, including: ten counts of sexual abuse, ten counts of abusing her position as a teacher for personal reasons and one count of a forged documents. The jury only needed 25 minutes to reach a guilty verdict. After the judge read the guilty verdict, the judge said that since a crime like this is unusual, she would be held in her cell until her punishment could be decided. Court was adjourned for the day. Mary and her lawyer came back to the courthouse 3 days later to hear the judge read off her punishment. The judge said it was difficult to properly asses the crime, since nothing like it has happened in recent history, there was also the issue of whether a teacher that violates her own students can ever be rehabilitated to the point where she can live in society as a lawful individual. There was also the issue of entering India with false documents, which is considered a border security issue. The judged sentenced Mary to seven years in prison. Mary was dumbfounded when she heard the verdict. She asked if she could write a letter home, asking for legal help from England. The judge denied her, on the grounds that India could not afford to agitate the country it just won its freedom from, in other words, the peace of mind of Indians was more important than a British criminal getting legal help from a country that India wanted to have relatively little to do with. Mary cried when she was taken back to her cell. Seven years would pass before Mary would send her first letter home.
 
Bombay 1954.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Mary sat on a bench outside of the courthouse, looking at her reflection in a puddle. The once beautiful and young woman was now ugly and beat up. The female inmates and the guards had abused Mary while she was in prison. The Indian woman in prison hated the British just as much as woman on the outside. Mary now has a black eye on her once perfect face; her once golden curls of blonde hair were now stringy and dirty (no shampoo in seven years). Mary had scars all over her body from the fights she was in; this motivated her to cover as much of her body as she could. Mary often volunteered for kitchen duty to avoid her abusive cellmates, at least for a while. Mary would spend two hours a day scrubbing pots and pans. Mary got a few burns on her arms and hands from cooking, and her nails were jagged and ingrown from digging dried food off pots. Mary couldn't see herself very clearly in her reflection in the muddy puddle; just as well, she didn't want to see what she looked like anyway. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Daniel never went back or even wrote to Mary at all. Mary never told anyone in England where she was really going off to except Daniel, and he kept that piece of information to himself. As soon as Daniel got off the ship at England, it occurred to him it made the most sense to move to the countryside and live a simple life, somewhere no one knew he was given a dishonorable discharge. He now lives in rural England.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When Mary was released from prison this morning, an officer suggested that she check into a half way house and she could possibly find work in a hotel kitchen. Mary thought it was actually a good idea, because she needed to raise a little money for stationary so she could send letters to her parents and ask them to collect her. Mary's parents were worried sick after the first year she was gone. They put out a reward for any leads to Mary's whereabouts, but nothing came of it. Mary checked into a half way house and works part time in a hotel kitchen. Mary's job pays very little and room and board is a lot higher than it was seven years ago. Mary writes letters to her parents every week, and they have received all of them. The problem is, they think the letters are a scam. Mary's parents never learned that their daughter went to India on her own and think the letters (with a Indian return address and stamp) is someone's idea of a joke. Mary broke a finger on the hand she writes with while she was in prison, it affected her writing style so much so that her parents think it's someone other than their daughter. To this day, Mary's parents still believe their daughter is somewhere in America. On a good note, England did eventually get a female prime minister in Margaret Thatcher (no relation to Mary Thatcher).
