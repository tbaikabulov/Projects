Part I

&nbsp;

�My gracious, what is that you are wearing?� Caroline
Hastings stared at the young woman who had just entered her parlor.

&nbsp;

Harriet Stewart looked down at her dress. She was confused
by the welcome from the older woman. She had been forced to come to this house
following the death of her beloved father and was still devastated. She
fingered the well-worn cloth nervously and tossed her long blonde hair out of
her eyes. �It is my best dress, cousin,� she answered.

&nbsp;

�Well, I can�t have you wearing something like that in my
home. Take it off,� Caroline demanded.

&nbsp;

�I beg your pardon,� Harriet began.

&nbsp;

The dark haired woman threw back her head and laughed. �Oh,
you will beg before I�m through with you.�

&nbsp;

Harriet looked aghast at her older cousin. �What are you
saying?��� 

&nbsp;

�It�s simple, really. You came here at my mercy. If you wish
to stay here, you will obey my commands and carry out my wishes.� Failure to do so will have you back out there
on your own.� Caroline pointed dramatically out the French windows that faced
the drive. �Surely, the solicitors explained all this when they told you of my
offer of a place to stay.� She looked at her cousin and raised a pencil thin
eyebrow. �Do you have any questions?�

&nbsp;

�I can�t believe that you would treat me this way.�

&nbsp;

�What way is that, my dear? As a penniless
freeloader? Or, perhaps, like a tramp like your mother?�

&nbsp;

�My mother was no tramp!�

&nbsp;

�She slept with my Uncle without the benefit of marriage.
What would you call that except a slut?�

&nbsp;

�They loved each other deeply.�

&nbsp;

�He was trapped into the relationship by your mother�s quite
timely pregnancy with you and even more timely death at your birth. In fact,
I�m not even positive that you are my Uncle�s child.�

&nbsp;

�How can you say that? My father loved me.�

&nbsp;

�That carries little weight now that he is no longer with
us.� Caroline picked at a thread on her bodice. �What matters now is that you
are out of options. Do you agree to my terms?�

&nbsp;

�I don�t really have a choice, do I?� Harriet said bitterly.

&nbsp;

�No,� her cousin replied. �Isn�t it delicious?�� When Harriet did not reply, Caroline�s gray
eyes hardened. �Now, why don�t you do what I asked?�

&nbsp;

Harriet turned her tear-stained face to her and asked, �I�m
sorry, I don�t remember the question.�

&nbsp;

�I said take off that horrible dress.�

&nbsp;

�You can�t be serious.�

&nbsp;

�Listen very carefully, little girl. I am very serious and
the sooner you realize that, the better.� She glared at the younger woman. �I
am not in the habit of repeating myself.�

&nbsp;

Slowly, Harriet forced her hands to lift. Her fingers
fumbled at the numerous buttons at her throat and wrist. Once it was off, she
held it in front of herself like a shield.

&nbsp;

�Better,� her cousin observed, ringing for the housekeeper.
�Why don�t you take the rest of those rags off now?�

&nbsp;

Harriet started at the appearance of the servant. She
clutched the dress tightly to her body.

&nbsp;

�Martha, bring up the fire and then take these items from
Miss Waltham and dispose of them. I would recommend burning them.�

&nbsp;

The older woman dropped a quick curtsey and hurriedly obeyed
her mistress. She had to tug at the dress to get it from Harriet and then stood
there waiting for the rest of the clothes. Harriet looked appealingly at her
cousin but began taking off her chemise at the cold look she received. 

&nbsp;

�And Martha, send a note to Mr. Chambers to call on me
tomorrow to measure her for her new things.�

&nbsp;

Once Harriet was naked, the housekeeper left the room with
her clothes held at arms length. Caroline took her time, studying the slightly
overweight body before her. Her cousin was well proportioned with long legs and
trunk. Her breasts were the size of ripe pears and her pubis was slightly
darker than the golden hair on her head.

&nbsp;

Growing uncomfortable under the implacable gaze, Harriet
raised her arms.

&nbsp;

Before Harriet could cover her charms, Caroline held up a
hand. �NO! I wish to see what I possess.�

&nbsp;

�I�m a person not a possession.�

&nbsp;

�Strange, I could have sworn that you agreed to live here at
my discretion and to obey my commands. Sounds to me like I
own you.�

&nbsp;

Harriet stood there in shock, her hands falling to her
sides. Her head was spinning and she could hear the blood pounding in her ears.

&nbsp;

�Come over here and kneel at my side.�

&nbsp;

Harriet glanced over at the couch.

&nbsp;

Caroline laughed at her look. �I can�t have you sit like
that on my furniture. I won�t have you ruin my things. Now come here.�

&nbsp;

It was hard to begin walking but she had no choice. She
knelt, her hands folded across her breasts. 

&nbsp;

�No, not like that.� Caroline
ordered, �Your arms should be behind you, clasping the opposite forearm. Spread
your legs apart. Wider. Good. That is how you sit from
now on unless I tell you differently. Do you understand?�

&nbsp;

�I don�t know why you are doing this to me?� Harriet cried
piteously.

&nbsp;

Caroline smiled wolfishly, �Because I can.� She sipped from
her cup of tea for a few moments while studying her young charge. �I wrote the solicitors
that I had a job for you. Do you want to know what it is?�

&nbsp;

Harriet nodded.

&nbsp;

�That is not acceptable. You are better than a simple animal
that can only shake its head.� Not much
better but enough. You will answer me with yes, ma�am or no ma�am.�

&nbsp;

�Ye�yes, ma�am.� Harriet stuttered.

&nbsp;

�Answer me completely.� When Harriet stared at her in
confusion, she shook her head, sadly. �You really are a simpleton. I asked you
if you want to know what work you will be doing. The correct response would
be��

&nbsp;

Harriet was panicking. �Um. Yes,
ma�am. Please tell me what my job will be?� She stared hopefully at the older
woman, hoping that she had phrased the question correctly.

&nbsp;

Reaching out her hand, Caroline patted the top of the
kneeling woman�s head. �Very good. See, I knew you
could get it.�

&nbsp;

Feeling uncomfortably relieved at the praise, Harriet
listened intently as her cousin spoke.

&nbsp;

�As you know, my father traveled extensively around the
world. While his main purpose was to increase trade, he was also able to
indulge his appetite of collecting. He was most intent on amassing the finest
collection of erotica in the known world. He has original texts from India,
Japan, and Russia. He has notebooks filled with the oral stories from the
tribes of Africa, South America, and Mongolia. What I want you to do is help me
get the individual works ready for publication.�
That means transcribing the materials into neatly, typewritten
manuscripts.� She continued to stroke the blonde head. �You can type, can�t
you?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, ma�am. I can type.�

&nbsp;

�Excellent. Well, I�m sure that you are tired from your
travels. We will start first thing in the morning.� Caroline called for the
housekeeper.� When Martha arrived,
Caroline said, �Please put Miss Harriet away for the night.�

&nbsp;

�Put me away?� At the older woman�s glare, Harriet dropped
her eyes and tried again. �Please, ma�am. What do you mean by put me away?�

&nbsp;

Nodding, the other woman smiled. �I�m glad to see that you
are capable of learning. Yes. Remember, you own nothing anymore. I own it all
and that includes your body. I can�t have you touching yourself at night.�
Caroline looked at her property. �I just know that you�ll be up there in the
dark, doing all sorts of nasty things to your body.�

&nbsp;

�Oh, I won�t do that.� Harriet found herself blushing again.
She had never been bold enough to stroke herself to pleasure before.

&nbsp;

�I can hardly trust your word now, can I? Especially knowing
what I do about your mother.� She put down her teacup. �Now, go with Martha.
You had better obey her, I don�t want to get a poor
report from her tomorrow morning at breakfast.�

&nbsp;

�No, ma�am.�

&nbsp;

�Good, girl.� She watched in
satisfaction as the naked body of her cousin walked away from her. The glorious
round globes of her ass, swayed tantalizingly back and forth. She was going to
have a wonderful time getting to know her. Laughing with delight at the
pleasures that awaited her, she headed to her own bedroom suite on the other
side of the house.

&nbsp;

The housekeeper led Harriet to a beautifully apportioned
room on the second floor. She directed her to do her business in the bathroom
and return.� �Don�t take too long, missy.
I�ve got other chores to do tonight and can�t be wasting my evening putting you
away.�

&nbsp;

Harriet�s hands were shaking as she washed her face and hands.
This day had been the most stressful of her young life. Not in her wildest
dreams had she expected that the death of her father would result in such a
change of her fortunes.

&nbsp;

When she came out of the bathroom she was shocked to see the
bed stripped and four black straps attached to each of the bedposts.

&nbsp;

�What?�

&nbsp;

�You must be secured. Now, come here.�

&nbsp;

Dazed, Harriet approached the bed. She was made to lay on
her stomach with the pillow that would normally have been under her head
lifting her hips off the bed. 

&nbsp;

�Give me your arm.� 

&nbsp;

The cold voice of the housekeeper broke through her swirling
thoughts. She reached out her hand and it was tied to the bed. Martha moved
around the bed, making sure that her young charge was safely put away.

&nbsp;

�Um?�

&nbsp;

�What is it, dearie?�

&nbsp;

�Could I please have a cover?�

&nbsp;

�Well, I don�t suppose it could hurt.� Martha picked up the
quilt. �Here you go. I�ll be here in the morning to supervise your morning
routine.� 

&nbsp;

The housekeeper turned the light off as she left, leaving a
very confused young woman on the sheets. Harriet tried to shift and found that
there was little give in the leather ties.�
With a sigh, she tried to relax but her mind was whirling.

&nbsp;

She tried to understand the feelings that were churning in
her body and brain. The whole afternoon had been a nightmare but the little
stabs of pleasure between her legs confused her. Why did her nipples ache so
when her cousin had praised her, or touched her, or looked admiringly upon her?
Dazed and without any answers, she slowly slipped into a sleep that was filled
with vaguely disquieting dreams.

&nbsp;

The next morning, Harriet was woken when the housekeeper
came in and opened the curtains. The sunlight was most welcome, as the thoughts
that had plagued her all night had not been very restful. She was concerned
when Martha went into the bathroom without making any attempt to release her.

&nbsp;

�Please, may I get up now?�

&nbsp;

�Not quite yet. The lady wants to make sure that you are
clean each day.�

&nbsp;

�If you let me loose, I will be able to bathe.�

&nbsp;

Martha pulled back the covers. She was carrying a strange
bag in her hand. �I don�t think you understand quite how clean you are to be
kept.� Without another word, she stuck the lubricated nozzle of the enema bag
into the young woman�s rectum.

&nbsp;

�Eww,� Harriet shrieked. �What are you doing?� Harriet
couldn�t understand the feelings, especially as the liquid began to fill her.
�Stop, oh, please stop.�

&nbsp;

�Hush, girl. I�m not hurting you. You just lay still and
take the entire bag.� I�ll let you up to
expel it in a few moments.�

&nbsp;

Harriet could not help squirming, hardly noticing when the
grinding pressed her sensitive clitoris against the bed. It was only that
distraction that made her able to tolerate the entire bag of liquid.

&nbsp;

Martha noticed and she nodded in satisfaction, as the
warning that Mistress Caroline had given her about the young woman�s appetites
was proven right.

&nbsp;

She pulled the tubing out of the nozzle and left the end of
nozzle in as a plug. She then slapped Harriet on her white ass. �You stop that
nasty rubbing right now. You are being cleaned. This is not an opportunity for
you to act lasciviously.�

&nbsp;

In horror, Harriet became aware of how she must look to the
older woman.� She was also amazed at the
feelings of pleasure that she was experiencing between her legs. �Oh, I�m
sorry,� she babbled. The cramps had started and she had to use all her strength
to hold herself still.

&nbsp;

Martha undid her right hand. �You reach around and hold that
plug inside. I�ll be very upset if you make a mess of this nice room.�

&nbsp;

Numb, Harriet obeyed while she waited for the other ties to
be released. Finally, she was allowed to stand. Once she scurried into the
bathroom, though, Martha made her wait for a moment before giving her
permission to empty her bowels into the bowl.

&nbsp;

With a critical eye, Martha oversaw the rest of her morning
ritual. She even went so far as to make Harriet bend over and show her that her
ass was completely clean and open her mouth to reveal shiny teeth.

&nbsp;

Once she was satisfied, she announced that the Mistress was
waiting for her in the breakfast room and quickly left. Harriet had not gotten
a tour of the house yesterday and did not know where to go. When she stepped
hesitantly out of the room, she saw no one she could ask. She crept downstairs,
very mindful of her nakedness. She peered into several rooms before she found
Caroline. Standing beside her was Martha.

&nbsp;

Caroline wiped her mouth and said, �I don�t like being kept
waiting.�

&nbsp;

Harriet tried not to cry. �I�m sorry, ma�am.�

&nbsp;

�You don�t even have an excuse. Martha gave you plenty of
time to get down here.�

&nbsp;

�I��

&nbsp;

�Silence. Since you can�t be
trusted to get from one room to the next, I will have to make sure that you are
helped. � Caroline leaned back in her chair. �Martha,
be sure and inform all the servants that Miss Harriet is to be escorted to and
from every room. She is not to be allowed to roam on her own. To make sure that
she obeys, the staff is allowed to use the three point hold.� She waved off the
housekeeper and turned back to her plate.

&nbsp;

Harriet didn�t know what the special hold meant and she was
too mortified to ask.

&nbsp;

�Sit down, Harriet. Because of your dawdling, I started
eating without you. You need to hurry up and eat so that you can get started on
my father�s papers.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, ma�am.� She walked over to
the brocade chair and hesitated before putting her bare butt down.

&nbsp;

�What is your problem?�

&nbsp;

�I�m not dressed.�

&nbsp;

�And whose fault is that?�
Your father�s for failing to plan better? Mine for not wanting your
filthy clothes to touch my fine things? Or could it be yours?� The words were
cold and cruel and Harriet did not know how to respond.

&nbsp;

�Oh, just kneel here and I will feed you.� Caroline pointed
the floor beside her. Once Harriet had settled she fed her several bites of
fresh fruit, making the young woman lick her fingers clean between each bite.
She went back to reading her paper while she did so, hardly sparing a glance to
the naked girl at her feet.

&nbsp;

At the conclusion of the meal, Caroline rang for a servant.
It was a different young woman, Sarah, who answered the bell.

&nbsp;

�Yes, Mistress. How may I be of
service?�

&nbsp;

�I want you take my cousin to the study. You were informed
about how she is to be escorted?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, My Lady.� Sarah crooked her finger at the naked woman.
�Come here.� She directed her to the wall near the door. �Lean forward and
spread your legs,� she ordered.

&nbsp;

�What?�

&nbsp;

�Don�t be tiresome, Harriet. Obey the girl. Your dallying
only serves to irritate me. Too much irritation and I will be forced to punish
you,� she finished ominously.

&nbsp;

In confusion, Harriet leaned forward and braced her hands
against the wall. She was shocked when the servant proceeded to insert her
thumb into her virgin ass and two fingers into her pussy. She squealed.

&nbsp;

�Quiet, miss,� Sarah warned. �It�s for your own good.� She
lifted her hand slightly and Harriet went up onto her toes. �Good girl. Now,
march.�

&nbsp;

It was most uncomfortable. The girl didn�t give her verbal
directions, she just moved the hand impaled in Harriet�s holes when she wanted
her to turn. Most shocking at all was when she stopped to speak to another
servant and had an entire conversation where the two servants managed to ignore
the naked female standing there. 

&nbsp;

At the conclusion of their talk, Sarah wiggled her hand.
�Come on, miss.� She opened the door to the study and escorted her charge
inside. �Bend over.�

&nbsp;

Overwhelmed by the sensations, Harriet obeyed without
question. The servant removed her fingers and pointed to a bell pull beside the
door. �If you need to leave this room for any reason, you must call for someone
to escort you.� 

&nbsp;

Turning swiftly, she was gone to continue with her regular
duties. Harriet was left alone in the dimly lit room. She stumbled over to desk
to see piles of papers strewn across the top. Leafing through them, she became
engrossed in the writing on the pages.

&nbsp;

�I�m glad to see that you are eager to get started.�

&nbsp;

Harriet jumped when she heard her cousin�s voice. She turned
to see her wave a male servant forward. He was carrying a strange looking chair
and he put it down beside a table that contained a black typewriter.

&nbsp;

�Come closer and let me get you started.�

&nbsp;

Walking over, Harriet watched her cousin rummage through a
box. �Please, ma�am. What am I supposed to do?�

&nbsp;

�Well, I�m told by your handler that you are quite tight.
I�m going to work on loosening you up and on improving your posture.� She
frowned at the younger woman. �I expect you to stand proudly, I mean, you have the blood of a Hastings running through your
veins, after all.�

&nbsp;

She reached down and affixed a small rod to the odd looking
chair. It had no back, just a forward leaning seat and two places for one�s
knees to lean against. Caroline opened up a small tin and coated the rod with a
slick substance. �Sit, down.�

&nbsp;

�How am I sit, ma�am?� Harriet asked, genuinely puzzled.

&nbsp;

Caroline took her arm and pulled her forward. �Place your
legs here and rest your knees on these pads. Good, now ease back.� Harriet
stopped when she felt the pressure on her back door. �Keep going, you�re doing
fine.� 

&nbsp;

�How?�

&nbsp;

�Press out slightly as you press down.�

&nbsp;

With steady encouragement, Harriet eased herself onto the
anal plug. Feeling strangely full, she glanced up at the woman standing over
her. 

&nbsp;

�Such a good girl,� praised her cousin. She pointed at the
stack of blank pages and the pile of loose papers. �Start with this tale from
Thailand. I expect your work to be perfect. I will be forced to punish
mistakes.� With those ominous words, the Lady of the Manor walked out of the
room. She went directly to the stables to ride one of her prize stallions as
she had a deep need to have something strong between her legs.

&nbsp;

Hours later, Caroline stepped silently into the study.� She had returned from her ride in high
spirits and wanted to check on her newest acquisition. She watched the hunched
over form of Harriet as she typed from the manuscript. 

&nbsp;

�Sit up straight,� she barked. �I thought that plug would held improve your posture. You must need a larger one.�

&nbsp;

Jumping painfully when her cousin came in, Harriet blanched
at the thought of something even bigger in her rear passage. �Oh,
no, ma�am. I�ll do better.�

&nbsp;

�You better. Now, show me what you�ve managed to do this
morning.� For the next while, she read over the work that Harriet had done. She
glanced up at the knock on the door. �Yes?� she called.

&nbsp;

One of the maids stepped into the room. �Ma�am, Mr. Chambers
is here for the fitting.�

&nbsp;

�Excellent.� Caroline set down the papers she was perusing.
�Where did you put him?�

&nbsp;

�In the parlor, ma�am.�

&nbsp;

�Fine. You bring Miss Harriet with
you.� Caroline turned to the poor unfortunate. �Don�t lag to
far behind this time.�

&nbsp;

Harriet�s face burned with shame as she forced herself off
the intrusive plug and bent slightly to allow the maid to penetrate her
loosened ass and cunt.

&nbsp;

�Oh, ma�am,� the servant gasped.

&nbsp;

�What is it?�

&nbsp;

�You should warn the other staff of the barrier, if you mean
to keep it intact.�

&nbsp;

Caroline�s eyes lit up. �Really?
How very lovely. I never would have known that she was untouched.� She walked
back over to the blushing young woman. �You�ll give me that too, soon enough,�
she promised.

&nbsp;

�What?� 

&nbsp;

�I see that we�ve forgotten how to address me.�

&nbsp;

�I�m sorry, ma�am. What do you mean?�

&nbsp;

Stroking her fingers over Harriet�s face, she answered,
�I�ll take great pleasure in introducing you to womanhood.�

&nbsp;

Turning, she led the way out of the room. They entered the
parlor and saw that the leather merchant had already set up a small stage. 

&nbsp;

Harriet crossed her arms over her chest but dropped them at
the glare from Caroline. The servant led her to the edge of the stage and
almost lifted her onto it before releasing her grip and leaving the room.

&nbsp;

He measured her everywhere, calling out the numbers to his
assistant. The tape went around her wrists, thighs, chest, hips, ankles, neck,
and head. He even measured the distance of her perineum and between her
nipples.� He was finally finished when
one of the servants came in with tea.

&nbsp;

�Oh, how wonderful. You are so
generous, my dear.�

&nbsp;

�Nothing but the best for you, old
friend.� Caroline waved to the chair across from her. �Please, have a
seat.� She glanced up when Harriet made move to climb down from the small
platform. �What are you doing?� she asked.

&nbsp;

�I thought��

&nbsp;

�That is your problem, my dear. No more thinking for you. I
will do it for you from now on.�

&nbsp;

Harriet stood on the small platform. She found it very
difficult to stand without fidgeting while the two other occupants of the room
discussed her attributes and the weather in such bland tones.

&nbsp;

�So, when I can expect delivery?�

&nbsp;

�A month, maybe two.�

&nbsp;

�That is not acceptable.�

&nbsp;

�These are individually handcrafted items, Lady Caroline.�

&nbsp;

�It�s not like your own hands are making them,� she
responded. �I want them by the end of this month.�

&nbsp;

The two of them haggled through the tea service and ended
with an agreement for certain items for two weeks and the rest over the course
of the next six. Harriet was most relieved when the leather merchant was
finally showed the door.

&nbsp;

With resignation, she bent for the maid to take hold and
returned to the study to complete her morning�s task. Her belly rumbled, as she
had only had a small portion of fruit to break her fast but she knew better
than to complain.

&nbsp;

In no time at all, she had lost herself into the story of a
rich merchant and the family he enslaved. There were words in Thai that she had
to consult a tattered dictionary for and some that she could not find at all.

&nbsp;

It was several hours later when Caroline entered the study.
She came to stand slightly to the side of her cousin where she can touch her
cousin and see her work. She read the page in the typewriter and casually
stroked Harriet�s back. �Not bad. Let me see what else you�ve done today.�

&nbsp;

Her hands trembling slightly, Harriet handed her the
paperwork. She watched the older woman walk over to a wingback chair and make herself comfortable. Her cousin caught her looking and
Harriet quickly dropped her eyes and blushed.

&nbsp;

Caroline sat and read the morning�s output and found two
errors.� She brought the two sheets over
to Harriet and pointed at them with a sharp nail. 

&nbsp;

Gulping, Harriet could only sit there in dreaded
anticipation.

&nbsp;

�I wonder the best way to teach you the lesson.� Caroline
stalked around the desk. �I know, since you obviously had no discipline as a
child. I will have you spanked.�

&nbsp;

�No, ma�am, I don�t��

&nbsp;

�Be very careful how you finish that sentence,� Caroline
interrupted. �You don�t have a say here.�

&nbsp;

Resigned, Harriet bowed her head. �Yes,
ma�am.�

&nbsp;

�Glad to hear that you agree with me.� Looking around the
room, Caroline spied an ottoman in the corner. �Get up and bring me that
stool,� she ordered. She sat down on the settee. �Place it right here in front
of me. Good. Now lay over it, facing me.� Reaching over, she rang for a
servant. �Please send Max in and have him bring the paddle.�

&nbsp;

�Now, I believe that for you to learn, you will need to
receive ten strokes for every error. Don�t you agree that is fair?� she asked,
using the toe of her boot to tap on the prone woman�s chin.

&nbsp;

Harriet lifted her head and stared into the cold eyes. �Yes, ma�am. I think that ten strokes for every error is fair.�

&nbsp;

�So very smart,� cooed Caroline, as she replaced the boot
with her hand. She leaned close to her cousin and smiled at her. �I know that
you want to make me happy, so I want you to count each blow and thank me for
it. Can you do that for me?�

&nbsp;

The cool gaze transfixed Harriet. �Yes,
ma�am. I will count each blow and thank you.�

&nbsp;

�Excellent. I want you keep your eyes on mine the entire
time.� Caroline looked up. �Ah, Maximillan. I need
your strong right arm to deliver 20 blows. This is her first punishment
session, so I would like you to use two thirds your usual force.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, ma�am,� the liveried man intoned. �Shall I begin?�

&nbsp;

�Please.�

&nbsp;

For the next twenty minutes the smack of the paddle into
flesh, the whimpers of pain and the increasing breathless voice of Harriet
counting off the blows and thanking her mistress for them interrupted the
silence of the room. At the end of the session, Caroline bid her to kiss the
instrument of her instruction before dismissing the servant.

&nbsp;

She sat in the chair and watched Harriet regain control.
Lifting her foot, she gently placed it under the younger woman�s chin. Raising
it up, she smiled into the red, tear stained face. �Have we learned our lesson?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, ma�am.�

&nbsp;

�You may return to the desk and correct those errors. When
you are finished, ring for the servant and join me for high tea.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, ma�am.�

&nbsp;

�I�m feeling generous, so you have my permission to apply
lubricant to the plug.�

&nbsp;

�Thank you, ma�am.�

&nbsp;

Harriet was almost grateful for the strange chair, since it
didn�t put any pressure on her hotly hurting derriere. She was almost used to
the feel of the slender rod in her rectum and was able to quickly retype the
offending pages.

&nbsp;

The young maid from the morning answered her ring and
escorted her to the parlor.� She rubbed
her hand over the reddened flesh as they walked. �Ooh, miss. That Max sure can
tan a hide, can�t he?� 

&nbsp;

Before Harriet could formulate a proper response, they
reached their destination.

&nbsp;

�Oh, good. You�re here.� Caroline
smiled. �You can pour.�

&nbsp;

Her hands still trembling slightly, Harriet moved to the tea
service and bent over.

&nbsp;

�No, no. Keep your legs straight. Bend your back only.�


She obeyed the instructions and lifted the sterling silver pot. She poured out
the hot liquid and lifted the delicate cup and saucer. �Ma�am, would you care
for lemon, sugar or milk?� she asked.

&nbsp;

�I take my tea with lemon only.�

&nbsp;

Using the silver tongs, she placed a wedge of lemon on the
saucer and held it toward the older woman.

&nbsp;

�No. I want you to hold it in both hands. Go to your knees.
Gracefully, my dear,� she chided. �You should be close enough for me to easily
reach but not so close you�re in danger of falling on me.�

&nbsp;

Watching her cousin carefully move herself into position,
Caroline nodded. �Now, hold it up until I take it.�

&nbsp;

Harriet looked longingly at the plate of sandwiches and
cookies on the tray. She had not eaten since her cousin fed her for breakfast.

&nbsp;

�Eyes down, dear. I will not tolerate
your begging.� 

&nbsp;

She sighed but obeyed. 

&nbsp;

�I have your best interests at heart, Harriet.� Caroline
said after sipping in silence for a while. �Your parents
failure to discipline you has resulted in you carrying too much weight. We will
reduce your food until your shape is once again pleasing to the eye.�

&nbsp;

Caroline read through her magazine, occasionally asking her
cousin for a refill. When she finally finished, she sent Harriet back to work.

&nbsp;

It was growing dark when the maid who came to turn on the
lights ordered her to take the position. Harriet bent over for a return of the
humiliating grip and another trip through the house.

&nbsp;

The maid left Harriet in the dining room. She looked around
fearfully until she determined that she was alone. Using the time to her
advantage, she wandered around the richly appointed room. She couldn�t help
marveling at the casual display of wealth. It was not just that presence of a
twenty person sterling service but that each piece gleamed from regular
polishing. She lost herself in exploring the beautiful things.

&nbsp;

�Where is that damn girl?�

&nbsp;

Harriet quickly dashed over to her cousin and dropped to her
knees. �I�m sorry, ma�am.�

&nbsp;

�What were you doing?�

&nbsp;

�Uh, just looking around, ma�am.�

&nbsp;

�What should you have been doing?�

&nbsp;

Shaking her head, Harriet could feel tears gathering in her
eyes. �I don�t know, ma�am. I can�t think what��

&nbsp;

�And that�s your problem.� Caroline tsked at her. �You need
to stop with that wasteful thinking.�

&nbsp;

�But��

&nbsp;

�You�re here for me. Your only thoughts should be on me and
my needs. You have no other function but to please me.�

&nbsp;

Harriet felt the tears fall.

&nbsp;

�Now, now.� Stepping closing,
Caroline pulled Harriet�s head to rest against her taut stomach. �This is so
much easier than what you would be doing in a factory or some other work. I�ll
do all your thinking for you and you concentrate on making me happy.�

&nbsp;

Harriet nodded. �Yes, ma�am. I�ll
try.�

&nbsp;

�No. There is no try. You will do this or you will be
punished. I just thought you were smart enough to make the right choice. Was I
wrong?�

&nbsp;

�No, ma�am. I�ll work to please
you.�

&nbsp;

�That�s what I want to hear. Eager
obedience.� Caroline stroked her head a final time and stepped over to
the table. She rang the foot bell and pointed to her side. �Take your position,�
she ordered.

&nbsp;

�Yes, ma�am.�

&nbsp;

�Say it.�

&nbsp;

�I�ll be on my knees beside you.� She gulped and continued,
�This is where I belong, ma�am.� She couldn�t help the blush that stained her
cheeks but the continuous throb between her legs, told her that she must be
doing something right.

&nbsp;

�Very good.� Caroline arranged her
skirt as she sat and rang for the first course to be brought into the room.

&nbsp;

The second meal passed with Harriet on her knees, receiving
all her nourishment from the fingers of her cousin. The servants moved around
her as if there was nothing odd about a nude women being hand fed at the table.
That was the beginning of her new life. 

&nbsp;

The next few days passed in a blur. The household followed a
usual routine and, soon, Harriet�s strange treatment seemed almost normal. She
was restrained each evening, escorted around the house with fingers up her ass
and cunt and spent her days typing. 

&nbsp;

The work on the manuscript was disturbing to the sheltered
young woman. At first, she didn�t quite understand the terminology that was
being used. She confessed this to her cousin one morning.

&nbsp;

�Please, ma�am. May I ask a question?�

&nbsp;

�You may.�

&nbsp;

�What does cunnilingus mean?�

&nbsp;

�Have you not heard that term before?� she asked.

&nbsp;

�No, ma�am.�

&nbsp;

�Well, we need to correct that immediately. You�ll do a much
better job if you comprehend what you are doing.� Caroline sat in the wingback
chair and tapped her lips with her index finger. This was just the opportunity
she had been looking for�finding a way to further humiliate her charge while
increasing the sexual tension. �After lunch we will have lessons.� 

&nbsp;

At the appointed time, Harriet followed her into the parlor.
The small stage was set up again. The servant, Max, and the maid who had
brought her there both took their places on the stage and faced Caroline and
the kneeling Harriet.

&nbsp;

On Caroline�s order, Max stripped and rotated slowly. His
penis was long and hung loosely before him. Caroline walked closer, holding a
pointer. She directed Harriet to crawl closer to the man.

&nbsp;

�This is his penis. He is uncircumcised. His foreskin covers
the head of the penis. Other names for penis are cock, rod, and dick.� As she
spoke of each item, she tapped the area. Using the wooden stick, she lifted the
penis and reveled the large, hairy sacks behind them.
�There is the scrotum. They are called balls. Come closer and feel them.�

&nbsp;

Harriet instinctively backed away. She realized immediately
that she�d made an error, as Caroline whirled and brought the thin, wooden cane
down on her unprotected breasts. She hunched over and her cousin easily
transferred her target to the shapely rear.

&nbsp;

�Oh, please, ma�am. I�m sorry.�

&nbsp;

�You do not disobey me.� Caroline spat out each word with a
strike from the cane.

&nbsp;

�I�m sorry.�

&nbsp;

Halting the correction, she smoothed the few hairs that had
strayed from her careful hairdo.� Turning
to glare into the eyes of the sobbing young woman, she declared, �I won�t
tolerate rebellion. Return to the position in front of Max.�

&nbsp;

Harriet crawled back and squinted slightly as her fingers
made contact with the man�s skin. After a brief exploration, she became bolder.
Her hands and fingers touching the man�s pubic hair and skin,
marveling at how the texture differed from her own. She was still a
little tentative and Caroline was almost gentle as she spoke about male
emission.

&nbsp;

She was forced to open the man�s ass cheeks and examine his
puckered opening.� When she came back
forward, her cousin stroked the servant�s penis until it became erect. Waving
the maid forward, she bade her to give him a blowjob.

&nbsp;

Caroline kept up a running commentary throughout the
fellattio session. She even went so far as to have the maid hold the copious
cum in her open mouth to show the wide-eyed Harriet.

&nbsp;

The lesson was repeated on the maid. Caroline bade her to
lie on her back so that Harriet could examine her anatomy easily. After the
previous whipping, the young woman obeyed her cousin�s directives to touch the
clit, the labia and even penetrate the vagina and anus gently with a single
finger.

&nbsp;

Then, her cousin had her back up so that Harriet was
kneeling directly in front of her. Legs strong from riding horses pinned her on
either side. Caroline settled her hands on the younger woman�s shoulders and
directed Max to repay the maid�s earlier actions and bring her to orgasm with
his mouth. 

&nbsp;

�Now, that is cunnilinguous.� She stroked her cousin�s
shoulders and ran her fingers through the brown hair, noting as Harriet�s pulse
quickened and breath grew rapid. �Do you like what you see? Do you have any
questions?�

&nbsp;

Numbly, Harriet could only shake her head as she watched the
maid�s skin flush and her body quiver through its release. She had never seen
such a thing before. She felt a stirring between her own legs as she watched
the man clean the copious fluids from the dark nether hair.

&nbsp;

Both of the servants thanked their Mistress for her kindness
of allowing them release.� She dismissed
them to continue with their duties.

&nbsp;

�Did that arouse you?� asked Caroline. �Are you wet between
your legs?�

&nbsp;

Blushing, Harriet nodded.

&nbsp;

�That is a completely natural reaction for a slut like you.�

&nbsp;

Her eyes flashing, Harriet said, �I�m not a slut.�

&nbsp;

�Mind your manners, girl.�

&nbsp;

Not dropping her head, she repeated, �Ma�am, I am not a
slut.�

&nbsp;

�Of course, you are. You�re the daughter of a slut and your
body betrays you. Don�t think the maids haven�t told me that you juice up when
they are escorting you.� She looked sternly at her charge. �Surely, someone who
was not a slut would not react like that.� Caroline bent down and drew her
fingers through the dew that had gathered between her younger charge�s legs.

&nbsp;

Harriet jumped, �Oh, please, ma�am.�

&nbsp;

�See? Your juices overflow.� She held the fingers to her
cousin�s mouth. �Lick it off.� When Harriet was slow to obey, Caroline grabbed
her chin and pulled her face around. �It is your essence. Now get it off my
hands.�

&nbsp;

Tentatively, Harriet opened her mouth. After a moment,
Caroline removed her fingers and drew them between her cousin�s legs again
before bringing them to her mouth. They repeated this motion until Harriet was
squirming and moaning, sucking on the fingers in her mouth with abandon.

&nbsp;

Finally, Caroline stood up. She smiled cruelly down at the
writhing young woman. �Truly, you are a slut.�

&nbsp;

Through her heavy breathing and the reaction of her flesh,
Harriet had no way to deny the truth of her cousin�s words.

Part II � Caroline�s Realm

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Caroline left Harriet to her thoughts for the rest of the
day. Her plans of molding the young woman into a purely
sexual being was well on the way.�
As she busied herself with managing her estates accounts, she could not
help but notice that she was dripping wet.

&nbsp;

Ringing the bell, she smiled when Martha came to the library
door. �Martha, I need some relief. Who do you recommend?�

&nbsp;

�I believe that Sarah has been doing particularly well these
past few days. Shall I send her here or do you want her prepared for your
room?�

&nbsp;

�Oh, I�ve too much to do today. Send her here and then keep
her in rotation for a trip to my room at a later date.�

&nbsp;

�Of course, My Lady.� Martha
dropped a curtsey, even though her mistress�s attention was back on the papers
before her. She quickly searched the lower levels for the lucky maid and sent
her to the library after a quick scrubbing of her hands and face.

&nbsp;

�Uh, My Lady. You wished to see
me?�

&nbsp;

Caroline glanced up. �No, dear. I
don�t wish to see you at all.� She pushed back from her desk. �Come here and
get busy.�

&nbsp;

Sarah blushed and hurried over to the desk. Lowering herself
to her knees, she crawled the final feet until she was under the heavy oak
piece and facing her employer.

&nbsp;

Moving back, Caroline rapped smartly on the top of the desk.
�Lift my skirts carefully, I don�t want there to be wrinkles.�

&nbsp;

Sarah mumbled, �No, My Lady. I�ll be careful.� 

&nbsp;

Starting at the slim ankles, she lifted and folded the cloth
until she revealed Caroline�s creamy thighs. She took extra effort to make sure
that her hands never touched skin. Taking a deep breath, she leaned forward and
placed a chaste kiss on her mistresses� mound.

&nbsp;

�Good girl. You may begin.�

&nbsp;

Using her nose, lips and tongue, Sarah worked first to get
through the damp hair that covered her mistresses� nether lips. In time, she
was able to run her tongue along the furrow and tickle the hardening nub. She
loved the tasted and spent much of her time, lapping from the source. Sarah
could not help smiling when the first tiny shudder went through her mistress.
She stabbed her tongue into the gushing tunnel and felt the throb as Caroline�s
inner muscles tensed.

&nbsp;

Caroline hardly made a sound or move as she was pleasured.
She had to admit that the maid was very good at what she did. For that reason
alone, she allowed Sarah her smile of victory, knowing that her maid�s work had
only just begun.

&nbsp;

Keeping her attention tightly focused, even as her jaw and
mouth grew tired, Sarah stayed under the desk for hours. Her tongue felt too
swollen to speak when her employer finally pushed back and stood up.

&nbsp;

�Well done, Sarah. I�ll have to have you back again soon.�
Caroline spoke as she straightened her clothes. �You have my permission to rest
until supper.�

&nbsp;

�Thank you, My Lady.�

&nbsp;

Caroline nodded absently as she gathered up the items to be
mailed. She called for a small plate of cheese and bread and took it to her bed
with a new novel by Susan Ferrier. She had heard that it was as racy as her
last and she could not wait another day before reading it.

&nbsp;

It was quite dark, when Harriet startled awake. She lay
bound in the dark room wondering way had awoken her. Then, she heard again the
sound of something or someone moving across the carpet toward her. Her pulsed
raced. In her current situation of being spread eagle on the bed, she couldn�t
defend herself. She shrieked when she felt the covers being pulled down.

&nbsp;

�Shush!� Whispered a voice as she was
slapped on her bare ass.

&nbsp;

�Please, don�t.�

&nbsp;

�Quiet, you. You think you�re so
high and mighty but it�s you with your bum in the air, isn�t it.� The young
maid, Jenny, slapped Harriet�s buttocks with her hand.

&nbsp;

�Ow, please don�t.�

&nbsp;

�Why not? I should punish you for
what you put me through today.�

&nbsp;

�Why?� Harriet wailed. �I thought you enjoyed it?�

&nbsp;

�Oh, I got pleasure from his tongue but that doesn�t help
where my mouth had to be.�

&nbsp;

�You don�t like fell...fellatio?�

&nbsp;

�No, I don�t like giving blow jobs.� Jenny spanked her
again. She liked the way the flesh trembled and turned red so much that she did
it again and again. She was so lost in her actions that she didn�t hear the
door open behind her.

&nbsp;

�Well. What do we have here?�

&nbsp;

Jenny whirled and then dropped to her knees. �Oh, My Lady. I...�

&nbsp;

�Silence.� Caroline walked forward
and placed her cool fingers on the well-marked derriere. �You�ve done quite a
job here, Jenny.�

&nbsp;

Wisely, the maid held her tongue.

&nbsp;

�However, I don�t recall instructing you in this endeavor.�
She glared down at the cowering woman. �What do you have to say for yourself?�

&nbsp;

�I�m sorry, My Lady. I was angry at her and��

&nbsp;

�Angry? Whatever did she do to you?�

&nbsp;

�The, uh, the instruction today.�
Jenny blushed furiously. �I shouldn�t have had to blow him.�

&nbsp;

Caroline reached down and grabbed Jenny�s chin. �As long as
you take my money, you�ll take my orders. It was my order you followed and not
Harriet�s doing. Do I make myself clear?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, My Lady.�

&nbsp;

�Now, you�ve abused my property and you�ll be punished for
that.� Caroline released her hold on Jenny and paced the room while she thought
of the most appropriate way to put the young woman in her place.

&nbsp;

She came back to the bed and sat down beside her still bound
niece. A part of her had to admire that Harriet had kept quiet since her
arrival. Caroline amused herself with stroking her nails down the taut
stretched back. Since her arrival at the manor and the strict diet she was
following, Harriet was becoming even more comely.



�All right, Jenny. You obviously need an opportunity to
reassess the use of your mouth. Toward that end, you will begin each day for
the next fortnight on your knees in the larder. You will welcome each member of
the household who wishes you good morning to a climax. We will check with the
staff to make sure that you are attending to your duties with alacrity. Failure
to provide satisfaction will result in an additional punishment. I�m thinking
about something in the stables.� Caroline smiled with no warmth. �Do you have
anything to say?�

&nbsp;

�No, My Lady.�

&nbsp;

�Really? You don�t want to thank me
for being so generous?�

&nbsp;

Jenny could not raise her head. �Thank you, My Lady,� she
whispered.

&nbsp;

�Much better. Now, don�t you think
it would be nice if you kissed the flesh you injured while telling her how
sorry you are?�

&nbsp;

Knowing that there was really no point in what she thought,
Jenny rose up and placed a kiss on Harriet�s butt. �I�m sorry,� she murmured.

&nbsp;

�Surely, you can do better than that?�

&nbsp;

Putting her back into it, Jenny placed several fervent
kisses on the still rosy behind. �I�m truly sorry. Please believe me. I�m
really, really sorry for spanking you.�

&nbsp;

�Good job. I�m sure that you need to get a good night�s
sleep so that you can be bright eyed tomorrow morning to start your penance.
You�re dismissed.�

&nbsp;

Jenny shot upright and dropped a quick curtsey before
rushing from the room. 

&nbsp;

For a moment, after the echo of the closing door faded,
Caroline continued to idly run her fingers along Harriet�s arms and flanks.

&nbsp;

�Now, what are we going to do with you?� she finally asked.

&nbsp;

Harriet jerked. The soft touches had been soothing after the
trauma of the night and she�d nearly fallen asleep. �I�m sorry, ma�am. What do
you mean?�

&nbsp;

�I can�t have you antagonizing the servants. It�s so hard to
find good help these days and I�ll not have you be the cause of their
desertion.�

&nbsp;

Taking a breath, Harriet stopped herself from speaking out
about unfair things were. Instead, she said, �No, ma�am. I�ll do better to keep
you pleased.�

&nbsp;

�Excellent. I�m so glad that we�re on the same page with
this. Hopefully, the corset should arrive first thing tomorrow but, if it
doesn�t, I�ll still expect you to be by my side.�

&nbsp;

Resigned, Harriet sighed. �Yes, ma�am.
I�ll be happy to be with you.�

&nbsp;

Caroline patted her on the behind and rose from the bed. �Fine. You rest now. I�ll keep the door locked and give only
Martha the key. You will not have to worry about any more late night visits.�

&nbsp;

�Thank you, ma�am,� Harriet said. She was again strangely
grateful for how well she was being taken care of by her cousin.

&nbsp;

At breakfast the next morning, Caroline had just put her
plate with the rest of the scrambled eggs on the floor for Harriet to lick when
Martha entered the dinning room.

&nbsp;

�Mr. Chambers and his staff have arrived, My Lady.�

&nbsp;

�Good. Take Harriet in when she�s done here and fetch me
when he�s ready to present her.

&nbsp;

Harriet was hungry and she thought little of lowering her
face to the plate for the remaining morsels of food. She stood up when the
plate was clean. 

&nbsp;

�Oh, you�re a right mess,� Martha laughed as she pulled out
a large napkin and wiped Harriet�s face off. �Come along now. We shouldn�t keep
everyone waiting.� With the expertise of long practice, she inserted her
fingers and thumb into the girl and led her to the
small room adjacent to the parlor.

&nbsp;

There, she handed over Harriet to the two assistants. These
young men were professionals and hardly batted an eye when the naked woman was
presented to them. The first one held up a single piece of leather that went
from her pubic area to just under her breasts. The other assistant began lacing
up a second piece along one side. Once that was laced, he went to the other
side and laced up that side.� Both the
sidepieces were high up on her hips and ended well below her armpits.
Completing that side, the assistant moved to the back and began securing the
entire outfit together.

&nbsp;

During the entire operation, they had not bothered to speak
one word to her or to each other.� They
continued to work in silence as they concentrated on tightening all the straps
until her breath was short. After they finished, they stepped back.

&nbsp;

When Mr. Chambers stepped up, Harriet began to tremble. If
possible she almost felt more naked in these three pieces of leather than when
she was completely nude. Her smallish breasts seemed prominent as they sat
perched on their new shelf. 

&nbsp;

He gazed at her with a critical eye before turning to his
assistants. �Well, done boys. I think we�re ready to show her Ladyship the
final product.�

&nbsp;

Sending for one of the maids, they all waited anxiously for
Caroline to get herself situated in the parlor. At the signal, Mr. Chambers led
the way in with Harriet right behind him. The two assistants led her over to the
small stage and backed up as soon as she was set.

&nbsp;

�My Lady, I hope that it meets with your approval.� Mr.
Chambers buffed a small section with his handkerchief. �Of course, had I known
that she was going to lose weight, I would have made the necessary adjustments
before my arrival.�

&nbsp;

�Oh, you�ve done a marvelous job. Turn
about, Harriet. I want to see it all.�

&nbsp;

The corset was crafted from beautifully burnished black
leather and it was molded against Harriet�s body.� The back curved over each buttock and had a
lip over her crack that drew attention to her assets. In front, the young woman
finally had cleavage. There was the addition of a small, specially
hardened area over the clitoris.� 

&nbsp;

Caroline clapped delightedly. �Well, done. I can hardly wait
for the rest of the pieces.�

&nbsp;

�It was my pleasure.� Mr. Chambers bowed slightly and took
his leave. 

&nbsp;

For what seemed like an eternity, Caroline admired her
beautifully attired cousin. Shaking herself from her daze, she stood up and
made her way to the door. �Come on, Harriet. Remember your promise from last
night to stay close.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, ma�am.�

&nbsp;

Harriet hurried to catch up and tried not to think as her
cousin led her around the house and grounds in her weekly inspection. They went
through the stables and gardens and Caroline seemed to think nothing of
discussing the mundane affairs of the estate while her more
nude than dressed cousin stood submissively by her side.

&nbsp;

The many workers on the estate were glad for the bit of eye
candy that they were given. Of course, they were careful to make sure that
their primary attention was on the Lady of the Manor. She tended to ask very
pointed questions and woe be any of her staff that
were not prepared for anything she wanted.

&nbsp;

Harriet found herself aroused every time she made a move.
The piece that cupped her so gently in front also pressed just right on her
clitoris. Walking was difficult but even standing still was a chore. She was
torn between relief and anguish when Caroline led her into the study and bade
her to work while she read the letters that had arrived in that day�s post.

&nbsp;

As Harriet typed the stirring words, she shifted about,
shooting sparks of pleasure through her center. She was unable to keep still.
Unbeknownst to her, Caroline watched her sinuous movements avidly. Her plan of
turning the young innocent into a sexual demon craving release was becoming a
reality.

Part III � Caroline�s Realm

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

�Enough, Harriet. I think you�ve
had enough excitement for the day.�

&nbsp;

Harriet looked up in surprise. She had been so engrossed in
her work that she did not notice her cousin�s approach.

&nbsp;

Smiling, Caroline stroked a hand down Harriet�s back. �It
looks like you�ve worked up quite a sweat.�

&nbsp;

Harriet shivered at the touch and then blushed furiously.
She knew that all day she had been on edge but she didn�t realize quite how
apparent it was to anyone else.

&nbsp;

�Don�t worry,� Caroline laughed. �I think it looks quite
good on you. You know, all glowing from awareness of your essential nature.�

&nbsp;

�My nature, ma�am?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, you�re a born slut. You�ve only just now begun to
embrace it.�

&nbsp;

Harriet wanted to argue with her cousin. However, as she
stood up from her stool, she was damp on both thighs and there was a slick of
her juices on the stool. 

&nbsp;

�Yet another reason why I�ll be keeping you off the furniture.� Caroline shook her head. �Well? What are
you waiting for? Clean it up.�

&nbsp;

Looking around, Harriet could not see any napkins or cloths
that she could use. �What should I use, ma�am?�

&nbsp;

�Honestly, do I have to tell you how to do everything?�

&nbsp;

�I�m sorry, ma�am.�

&nbsp;

�Use your tongue.�

&nbsp;

Harriet felt faint. Just the other day, she had tasted
herself for the first time after her training session with the maid and
manservant. Then, she had to lick herself off her cousin�s hand that had
trailed between her legs. This time, she would have to bend over and lick
herself off the leather.

&nbsp;

�We don�t have all day,� Caroline stated as she began
tapping her foot.

&nbsp;

�Yes, ma�am,� replied Harriet. She lowered herself to her
knees and leaned forward. The leather was warm beneath her tongue and she soon
lost herself in the slightly acrid and salty taste of herself on the hide.

&nbsp;

�My, my,� gloated Caroline. �It looks like I�ll have to give
you more chances to indulge yourself.�

&nbsp;

Harriet pulled back, her face flaming in embarrassment.� She hadn�t realized that she was licking well
beyond where her juices had touched. �What do you mean, ma�am?�

&nbsp;

�You obviously love the taste of leather. I have many pairs
of shoes that could use a good cleaning.� Caroline petted her on the head. �In
fact, I think I might have you start tonight.� She laughed and tugged slightly
on Harriet�s hair. �Come along now.�

&nbsp;

Not knowing whether her cousin was being serious or not,
Harriet rose to her feet. Her head couldn�t seem to stop spinning. The way that
her body was reacting to everything that was happening

&nbsp;

Caroline did not bother to wipe the smirk from her lips as
she walked down the passageway with her ward.�
Things were moving along rather nicely and she could hardly restrain
herself from claiming the younger woman�s virginity that very minute. She knew,
however, that a little more time for Harriet to wait while her sex marinated
from the constant stimulation would make her all the more malleable.

&nbsp;

It was a good thing that she did not need to deny herself.
She intended to take at least two of the maids to bed following the meal break.
She just had to figure out what to do with Harriet in the hours before
eventide.

&nbsp;

Dinner that night was a roast lamb with mint jelly. Caroline
enjoyed having Harriet�s soft tongue clean her fingers of juices and she was
startled when her head groom coughed from the doorway.

&nbsp;

�Yes, Sean?�

&nbsp;

�My Lady, I think its time. Both of the mare�s
are ready to be covered and Fire Master is raring to go.�

&nbsp;

Caroline�s eyes lit up. �Perfect,� she cooed. This would be
the best thing possible for Harriet�s continued education. �I want you to take
my cousin down to witness the event.�

&nbsp;

�You don�t want to be there, My Lady?� 

&nbsp;

�No, I�ve got other plans.� She reached down and grasped
Harriet�s chin. �You�ll go with them and do what they say. I�ll expect a full
report when you return.� She took note of her cousin�s pale face. �Don�t worry.
None of the grooms or hands will touch you.�

&nbsp;

�Thank you, ma�am,� Harriet whispered.

&nbsp;

�Take her down and have someone bring her back when
everything is over.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, My Lady.� Sean waited for Harriet to rise and go over
to him. �Shall I use the special hold?�

&nbsp;

�No, I don�t think it�ll be necessary. She�ll obey you.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, ma�am,� Harriet agreed. �Thank you,
ma�am.� Harriet was uncommonly grateful for the concession and she made
sure to stay right beside the groom as they left the room.

&nbsp;

Caroline rang the bell. She smiled at Martha. �Tell Cook
that dinner tonight was exemplary.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, My Lady. Will that be all?�

&nbsp;

�No. I want two of the more flexible young women up in my
room by the time I get there.�

&nbsp;

�Any preferences?�

&nbsp;

�Not Jenny. I don�t think she�s earned the privilege of my
bed.�

&nbsp;

�You�re right, of course, My Lady. It will be done.� Martha
nodded once before hurrying off on her mission. She found the perfect choices
polishing silver in the anteroom to the kitchen.

&nbsp;

�Claire and Sarah, go quickly to
the laundry room and give yourselves a good scrubbing. Her Ladyship wants you
upstairs on the double.�

&nbsp;

Both young women flushed and dropped their eyes from the
knowing looks of the other servants in the room. 

&nbsp;

Martha followed them in and watched with an eagle eye while
the women stripped and began to clean themselves. Claire was a ginger haired
young woman with a dusting of freckles covering most of her body. Sarah was a
pale blonde, who was twice as well endowed as her fellow maid.

&nbsp;

�Everywhere, girls. I want you to
get behind your ears, too. Remember, this is for the lady of the house.�

&nbsp;

�Should we clean our insides?�

&nbsp;

�Good idea.� Martha moved to one of the lower shelves and
pulled out an enema and douche bag. Handing it off to the girls, she said,
�Take turns doing one another. One round should do it and then you should get
yourselves upstairs on the double. You know how she likes you.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, ma�am,� they answered, filling the bags with a bit of
warm, soapy water.� They looked at each
other silently before Claire shrugged.

&nbsp;

Claire bent over first to receive the warm liquid in her
bowels and birth canal. Neither woman was unfamiliar with the
other and they giggled as their touches tickled the other. 

&nbsp;

�Don�t go too far. Your pleasure is hers this evening.�

&nbsp;

Both maids bowed their heads and finished their tasks. With
a final inspection, Martha let them dress again and directed them upstairs.
Shaking her head, she returned to the kitchen to oversee the remainder of the
cleanup.

&nbsp;

Caroline opened her bedroom door and stood for a moment
admiring her view. The two comely maids were standing at the end of her bed,
their arms about each other�s waist.

&nbsp;

Stalking closer, she ran her fingers over the small bits of
exposed flesh before her. Running a finger along one girl�s wrist and then
tickling across the other�s chest. She tugged on Claire�s hair and then kissed
the exposed throat.� Grabbing hold of the
back of Sarah�s neck, she kissed her hard. Releasing her hold on both girls,
Caroline stalked over to the mirror and held out her arms.

&nbsp;

The maids rushed over and began to remove her clothes. As
each item was removed, they folded or hung it carefully. Just being in the
proximity of their powerful employer excited them both.

&nbsp;

When Caroline was naked, she sauntered to the bed and
situated herself on the fluffy pillows against the headboard. �Strip yourselves,� she ordered.

&nbsp;

The maids quickly complied. They treated their own clothes
with less respect and merely dropped them where they were standing.

&nbsp;

�Come to me, my girls. Honor your mistress.�

&nbsp;

The two women climbed on either side of the bed and with
light touches of their lips began their obeisance. Starting at her feet, they
moved upwards, making sure their breasts and nipples were in constant contact
with their mistress. It was torment for them and her but one Caroline allowed.

&nbsp;

Caroline spread her arms wide and enjoyed the double
attention. Her breathing deepened as the women skipped over her mound and moved
to her luscious breasts. Their tongues danced over the pliant flesh before
sucking her erect nipples into their mouths to suck and scrape with teeth.

&nbsp;

Almost moaning out loud, Caroline reached out to hold
Sarah�s head to her breast and to push Claire down between her legs.

&nbsp;

Claire quickly obeyed the pressure and kissed her way down
Caroline�s body. She marveled at the textures of her Mistresses body. Her skin
was so soft from the beauty treatments but the kinky hair between her legs. 

&nbsp;

Offering a kiss to both inner thighs, she mouthed Caroline�s
mound. As Caroline�s legs relaxed open, she licked her way from top to bottom. Claire
swilled her tongue in the copious fluid and then opened her mouth to suck
Caroline�s clitoris into her mouth. Keeping up the pressure, she flicked the
tiny bud until Caroline finally pushed her head away.

&nbsp;

Caroline rose from the bed and stretched. She murmured in
pleasure as she looked down at her eager servants. That one climax was lovely
but she required more.

&nbsp;

�Sarah, kneel at the foot of the bed and lean your head
back.� 

&nbsp;

Obeying, Sarah slid her legs beneath the frame as she
watched the approach of Caroline, she was glad for the support for her back and
neck.

&nbsp;

Smiling at the quick compliance, Caroline stepped forward.
Her hungry cunt was at the perfect height for Sarah�s mouth to reach.� When Sarah opened her mouth in anticipation,
she said, �Good girl. Start gently, I�m still sensitive.�

&nbsp;

Any response from Sarah was muffled by her mouthful of dark
hair. She started by sucking the drops of liquid essence from between her
Mistresses legs. She then began to trail her tongue in the dark furrow, keeping
clear of the hard bundle of nerves for the time being. 

&nbsp;

With the awkward position of her neck, it was difficult for
Sarah to breathe but she was not complaining. She clenched her thighs together
rhythmically and just moaned, �please,� as she licked
and sucked fervently.

&nbsp;

�Claire,� demanded Caroline. �Get behind me and tongue my
rosebud. I want to hear you back there.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Mistress,� Claire mumbled as she got into position.
She had been feeling jealous as she watched her fellow maid�s head bob up and down.

&nbsp;

Claire enjoyed serving her Mistress but wished that she
could be the one with her mouth full of pussy instead of having to wipe her
tongue over her ass while being sure to sound appreciative for the opportunity.


&nbsp;

Quickly, though, she was panting and moaning for real.
Keeping her hands grasped behind her back less she inadvertently touch the
beautiful body with them, Claire worked her nose into the crevice of Caroline�s
ass cheeks and her tongue in and out of the tight ring. As usual, except for a musky
scent, her Mistress was clean and there was plenty of natural lubricant from
her earlier orgasm to ease her tongue in and out.

&nbsp;

Caroline stood tall and proud as she was pleasured front and
back. It took all of her self-control to continue standing as the orgasmic
waves flowed from her center. Her nipples became even more erect and her toes
curled as her climax peaked, ebbed, and peaked again.

&nbsp;

�Enough, my pretties.� Caroline
moved back and looked at the two maids.

&nbsp;

Their hair was askew and the eyes were bright. Both their
light coloring showed up the blush that painted their chests and cheeks.

&nbsp;

�You�ve both done well. Would you like to come yourselves?�

&nbsp;

�Oh, My Lady,� Claire whispered.

&nbsp;

Sarah responded, �If that should please you, My Lady.�

&nbsp;

�I wouldn�t have offered otherwise.� Caroline reclined onto
the bed and rearranged the pillows behind her back, so that she was sitting
partially up. She bent both her legs and indicated for Sarah and Claire to
place themselves in position. Crossing her hands
across her stomach, she relaxed in post-coital bliss.

&nbsp;

The maids clambered onto the soft mattress and set
themselves on their knees with their Mistresses� long legs between their own.
There were twin gasps as they pressed their throbbing flesh against Caroline�s shins.

&nbsp;

After a breath, Sarah asked, �May we take hold?�

&nbsp;

�You may.�

&nbsp;

Their legs braced wide, they grasped her thighs and thrust
against her shins. Both women shuddered as they tried to stay still and wait
for permission to move.

&nbsp;

�Begin,� Caroline said.

&nbsp;

The maids humped her legs with greater and greater
enthusiasm as their own long delayed orgasms approached. They struggled to kept
their eyes on their Mistress and hold back their orgasm until she gave them
leave to succumb.

&nbsp;

�Come now,� ordered Caroline. She watched as the two women�s
smooth movements became erratic and jerky as they climaxed. Allowing them a
minute to regain their composure, she moved her own legs and was rewarded by
another shudder running through their bodies.

&nbsp;

�Well done.� She patted the tops of their down bent heads.
When they looked up to her in gratitude, she smiled. �I know,� she said. �Now,
clean me off.�

&nbsp;

The two maids scooted back and began to lick her legs clean.
As they finished her shins, they moved upwards and soon, all three were
laughing as they competed for space in the narrow area between Caroline�s legs.
The maids soon found a way to fit both so that both their tongues could duel to
see who would bring their Mistress to the third climax of the evening.

&nbsp;

Finally sated, Caroline brought her legs together. The thrum
that ran through her veins was a welcome relief after the day�s tension. She
started when there was a knock at the door.

&nbsp;

Not bothering to cover herself, she called out, �Enter.�

&nbsp;

The door slowly opened and the blonde head of her cousin
peeked around the door.

&nbsp;

�Ah, Harriet.� Caroline waved at
the two maids and they quickly leaped from the bed and grabbed up their
clothes. With a final curtsey, they dashed from the room without bothering to
dress. 

&nbsp;

�Harriet?� Caroline called again when her cousin failed to
respond.

&nbsp;

Harriet pulled her eyes from the empty doorway. She had been
transfixed by the view of the two naked women.�
�I�m sorry, ma�am. What did you say?�

&nbsp;

Grinning, Caroline stood up from the bed and slowly reached
for her robe. Sensuously, she pulled the silk up to drape over her body. She
knew that her body was well maintained and that many of her lovers had
commented on her beauty. The look in Harriet�s eyes was yet another validation
of her continued ability to captivate.

&nbsp;

�Close your mouth, Harriet.�

&nbsp;

Harriet snapped her mouth closed and tried to get her
panting under control. She was almost at the limits of her ability. All day,
every move had stimulated her and she had just spent two hours in the highly erotically
charged atmosphere of the breeding sheds. Now, she had her breath taken away by
the vision of her dark haired cousins wonderful body.

&nbsp;

Caroline had dark hair on her head and between her legs. Her
legs were strong from the years of riding and her bosom had no sag, despite
their size and her years. There was still a hint of cleavage from the loosely
closed robe and Harriet forced her eyes away from the tempting sight.

&nbsp;

�Ma�am, you wanted a report?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, I do.� Caroline seated herself in a wing-backed chair.
�Come over here and kneel before me and tell me all about it.�

&nbsp;

Harriet obeyed and was immediately distracted by the long,
bare legs before her. Knowing this, Caroline crossed her legs and extended one
well manicured food to tap Harriet�s chin.

&nbsp;

�Focus, young woman. You wouldn�t
want to disappoint me.�

&nbsp;

�No, ma�am.� Harriet crossed her
arms behind her back and cleared her throat. �We went to another building than
the one that we visited today. It had two large rooms and a wide hallway and
the floor was very soft.�

&nbsp;

�I know what my breeding shed looks like. Tell me about the
process.�

&nbsp;

�Of course. They brought the mares
in first. They each went into their own room and had their tales wrapped. One
of the men wiped them down.� He was, uh,
very thorough.� She coughed. �After that, they tied their heads to the wall and
put blindfolds on them.�

&nbsp;

�They are both experienced mares and don�t need breeding
hobbles but Sean was wise not to take chances with them getting skittish.�

&nbsp;

�Then the stallion came in. He was very excited and made a
lot of noise.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, he sounds when he gets the scent of a receptive mare
in his nose.� Caroline trailed her fingers down her throat and chest and smiled
when Harriet�s eyes followed every move she made. �Do go on,� she purred.

&nbsp;

�One of the boys, uh, handled his, uh��

&nbsp;

�The stallions cock, dear. Do use the proper terms.�

&nbsp;

Harriet took a deep breath. �The boy washed the cock with
soap and water.�

&nbsp;

�That�s called teasing. It keeps the stallion from wasting
too much energy mounting before he�s really ready.�

&nbsp;

�It�I mean the cock got really large.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, that�s called belling of the penis. It is quite a
sight. Go on.� Caroline squeezed her legs together. It was just too precious
that she was able to vicariously relieve the breeding while her embarrassed cousin struggled to find the terms. �Pray
continue,� she said.

&nbsp;

�The stallion was led first into the room with the chestnut
mare. He was gentle at first, nuzzling against her. They kept pulling him away,
though, when he wanted to, uh, get on the mare.�

&nbsp;

�That�s called mounting. They were doing more teasing, too.�

&nbsp;

�One of the boys finally moved the mare�s tail out of the
way and let him mount. It was pretty quick for him to go from all tense to
completely relaxed.�

&nbsp;

�That�s a man for you.� Caroline winked at her cousin. She
nearly laughed as Harriet paled. �That�s right. You have no experience with the
male of the species.�

&nbsp;

�They scare me,� Harriet admitted in a quiet voice.

&nbsp;

�They can be intimidating to the unitiated. With my guidance,
you won�t have to worry about them taking any liberties with you for a while.�
Caroline moved her foot up to stroke Harriet�s face. �As I told you before,
I�ll be the one making a woman of you.�

&nbsp;

Harriet swallowed. After what she had witnessed this evening,
she was terrified about what her cousin�s promise meant for her.

&nbsp;

�Don�t worry, poppet. I�ll make sure that every inch you
take you�ll be begging for more.�

&nbsp;

Harriet did not know whether she should thank her cousin for
that comment or not. Deciding to go back to the somewhat safer topic of her
evening�s experiences, she nodded, rubbing her cheek against the sole of her
cousin�s foot. Taking a breath, she said, �After he dismounted, they led him
back into the hallway. One of the boys washed him off again and then put some
jelly on his cock.�

&nbsp;

�That�s to make sure there is no spread of disease and the
lubricant is sometimes necessary for intromission.�

&nbsp;

�Intromission? What does that
mean?�

&nbsp;

�The insertion of the penis into the
vagina.� She paused. �What else would those be
called?�

&nbsp;

�The cock and cunt, ma�am.�

&nbsp;

�And the insertion?�

&nbsp;

�Fu�fucking, ma�am.�

&nbsp;

�Very good. Were there any problems
with the second covering?�

&nbsp;

�No, ma�am. He was all sweaty and
they soaped him off and walked the mares around.�

&nbsp;

�They weren�t torn were they?�

&nbsp;

�Torn?�

&nbsp;

�Sometimes the stallion is so large that he can tear the
channel.�

&nbsp;

�No, ma�am. There wasn�t any
bleeding that I could see.�

&nbsp;

Caroline nodded. �Excellent. When I take you, I�ll make sure
to start small. Other than your maidenhood�s puncturing, there won�t be any
bleeding your first time.� She stood up and moved close to her kneeling cousin.
Caroline knew that tonight�s earlier activities and their conversation had had
aroused her again and that her scent would be tickling her cousin�s nose.

&nbsp;

�I�m looking forward to tomorrow,� Caroline said. �I think
that instead of transcribing my father�s work in the afternoon that we�ll
reserve that time for your deflowering.� She brushed Harriet�s bangs from her
eyes. �Won�t that be something to look forward to?�

&nbsp;

Harriet�s mouth was suddenly dry. Her heart started racing
and black spots appeared before her eyes.

&nbsp;

�Breath, Harriet.� She went down on one knee and, holding
Harriet�s face in both hands, spoke slowly and clearly. �I�ll be introducing
you to unimaginable pleasure, not damaging you in any way. Believe me, you�ll
never be the same and you�ll never want to go back to the way things were
before.� She smiled. �Now, let me ring for Martha to come and put you away.
You�ll need to be well rested for tomorrow.�

&nbsp;

Part IV � Caroline�s Realm

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Harriet would have tossed and turned all night if she had
any freedom of movement.� Martha did her
usual thorough job of securing her to the bed. Each wrist and ankle was
encircled by soft leather and then tied to the each of the four posts. 

&nbsp;

She was also nude again. Upon their return to her room,
Martha had unlaced the corset and ordered her to clean it with a lightly damp
cloth. While it was nice to breathe freely again, she was super conscious of
the way that the breeze from the open window moved across her bare flesh.

&nbsp;

The pillow beneath her belly kept her from being able to rub
her mound against the bed, as she desperately wanted to do. All day, she had
been immersed in arousal and her body hummed with need. 

&nbsp;

It was a need that she could not yet fully understand. She
knew from her cousin�s last words to her that the new day would be a learning
experience for her. While she was scared about what tomorrow would bring, she
trusted Caroline would look after her. Finally, she fell asleep with the vision
of her cousin�s body in her mind�s eye.

&nbsp;

�Rise and shine, young Miss,� Martha trilled as she came
into room. She flung open the curtains to let in the sunshine. Marching over to
the bed, she pulled the cover off Harriet�s hips and to the end of the bed.

&nbsp;

Harriet startled out of her erotic dream and shuddered as
the cloth slid down her body. Every inch of her skin seemed more alive than
ever before.

&nbsp;

�We�ll be cleaning you completely today in preparation for
today�s big event.� Martha calmly walked around the bed while she released
Harriet�s bonds. Slapping her lightly on the bum, Martha said, �Get into the
bathroom, now.�

&nbsp;

Harriet quickly obeyed. She shifted from foot to foot as she
waited on the cold tiles for Martha to fill the enema bag. She wanted to
complain or even to ask to do it herself but she stayed quiet.

&nbsp;

�Bend over, dear, and spread yourself.�

&nbsp;

Complying, Harriet tried to relax as the nozzle entered her
ass. The warm water filling her bowels was still an experience that she could
not decide if it was more pleasurable or painful. She just knew she was
uncomfortable as the cramps began.

&nbsp;

Martha made her keep the liquid inside for five minutes.
Once Harriet expelled it, she was filled again. Finally, Martha declared her
clean. She then made Harriet get into the tub and soak in lavender scented
water.

&nbsp;

It was the first time since her arrival that she had been
able to bathe. She relaxed in the warmth until Martha ordered her to stand up.

&nbsp;

�It�s time to get clean,� Martha explained, as she lathered
up a soft cloth and began to run it over Harriet�s body.

&nbsp;

The experience was exquisite. Her muscles were relaxed but
all of her new found erogenous zones were wide-awake by the time Martha told
her to rinse off. The freshly heated towel rubbed over her body caused her
entire body to goose bump.

&nbsp;

�Someone certainly likes this,� chuckled Martha. 

&nbsp;

Harriet blushed as she saw that the housekeeper was staring
at her erect nipples.

&nbsp;

�Her Ladyship was quite right about you,� Martha said as she
directed Harriet over to the dressing table. �Now, let us do something with
your locks.�

&nbsp;

Martha brushed her hair for almost twenty minutes and it
shined when she finished putting it up in a twist. Harriet turned her head from
side to side as she looked at herself in the mirror.

&nbsp;

�I�m beautiful,� she said in awe.

&nbsp;

Martha looked down at her in shock. �Of course, you are. Not
only are you well proportioned, you are positively glowing.� She tapped Harriet
on the shoulder to get her to stand up and get dressed in the corset.

&nbsp;

Stepping into the cool leather, Harriet trembled slightly.
She tried to stay still while Martha laced her tightly.

&nbsp;

When finished, Martha led her over to the oval mirror. �See?
There is nothing in the world that can make a woman more beautiful as when she
awakens sexually.� She patted Harriet�s bum and smiled. �I can hardly wait to
see you tonight. You�ll be a sight to behold.�

&nbsp;

Harriet blushed and bent slightly for the usual hold. Martha
brought her directly to the dining room. She jerked upright when she heard
clapping.

&nbsp;

�Bravo, Martha. She looks good enough to eat.�

&nbsp;

�You�re welcome, My Lady, although I must say that you�ve
done wonders with her yourself.�

&nbsp;

�I do try,� Caroline sighed. She ran a cool hand up
Harriet�s leg. �It is nice when a plan comes together.�

&nbsp;

Harriet shivered from the contact. She wanted more but was
embarrassed at how her body was reacting. Involuntarily, her hips moved as
Caroline�s hand continued to roam over her legs.

�

Smiling to herself, Caroline removed her hand and pointed at
the floor.

&nbsp;

Harriet had to bite to lip not to ask for her cousin to
continue touching her. In resignation, she sank to her knees.

&nbsp;

�Look at me,� commanded Caroline.

&nbsp;

Lifting her chin, Harriet raised her eyes. She was surprised
at the genuine affection she could see in Caroline�s gaze.

&nbsp;

�I�m very much looking forward to this afternoon. Now, have something
to eat. We�ve got to keep your strength up.� Saying this, she fed Harriet bits
of sausage and toast.

&nbsp;

After breakfast, Harriet spent the morning following
Caroline around the house as she spoke to Martha about the upcoming ball and
the necessary chores that went into getting ready.� Hearing about the crowds of folks that were
to be expected, Harriet felt her heart pound. She just knew that her cousin
would have some diabolical plan for her that would involve more humiliation
than she had so far had to endure.

&nbsp;

Caroline hand fed her a light snack for lunch and then had
her escorted up to her bedroom. She had Claire and Sarah take her upstairs.
They removed the corset and wiped her down with a soft chamois cloth before
brushing her hair. Giggling, they finally left her kneeling on the floor before
a three-panel mirror.

&nbsp;

Harriet knelt on the wool rug and tried to keep from
fidgeting. She kept taking surreptitious glances behind her. She was fascinated
by the multiple views of her naked body. She was not entirely sure where the
beautiful creature she saw had come from but knew, instinctively, that she owed
it all to her cousin.

&nbsp;

Like a mouse mesmerized by cobra, Harriet swayed slightly as
Caroline entered the room and strode across the floor toward her. �Her cousin�s grey eyes held her in a spell. As
Caroline began to undress, she had to run her tongue over suddenly dry lips.

&nbsp;

�You�ve already learned the first lesson of the day.�
Caroline spoke softly, so that Harriet had to listen intently. �Keep your entire
focus on me. While you will enjoy what will happen to you here in this room,
your pleasure is not the point. What I do, I do because it entertains me.�

&nbsp;

As she spoke, she shrugged her chemise off her shoulders and
shimmied out of it. The silky cloth puddled at her feet and she braced her
fists on her hips. �Take a good look, girl. I am your owner and you will
worship this body before the night is out.�

&nbsp;

Harriet gulped and obeyed. Her eyes trailed from Caroline�s
eyes down to her toes. It was the first time in her life that she had the
luxury to actually study the female form. Except for inadvertent glances as she
bathed, she had never even seen herself so revealed until she entered her
cousin�s service.

&nbsp;

�Stand up,� ordered Caroline. She stepped toward Harriet and
flicked a finger over her erect nipples. �My, but you�re eager to get started.�

&nbsp;

Harriet had not thought she could be any more embarrassed.
Standing for her cousin�s perusal fueled a sense of shame while it deepened her
sexual excitement.

&nbsp;

Except for the sounds of Harriet�s breathing, the room was
quiet. Caroline walked around her and then squatted behind her. With a feather
light touch, she ran her fingers up the back of Harriet�s legs.

&nbsp;

Harriet wanted to escape the sensations that were shooting
through her body while at the same time she desperately craved a stronger
touch. She dug her fingernails into the palms of her hands as she tried to
regain some control.

&nbsp;

Her efforts were in vain as Caroline brushed her hands over
and around her legs. She occasionally pinched but she concentrated her efforts
on slowing ratcheting up the tension.�
Harriet found the touches too exhilarating for coherent thought.

&nbsp;

Continuing to stroke the trembling skin of her prey,
Caroline circled Harriet. She moved upward, skipping over her mound and breasts
but trailing her fingers over every other inch. Sometimes she used her
fingernails to lightly scratch and other times, she used the pads of her
fingers. 

&nbsp;

Harriet believed that she could feel every ridge on
Caroline�s fingertips. Her breathing became irregular and she moaned when
Caroline circled the base of her breasts. But Caroline didn�t touch her
crinkled nipples. Instead, Caroline continued to stroke upwards. She rubbed her
shoulders, brushed Harriet�s hair behind one ear and drew her fingers over the
parted lips and closed eyelids.

&nbsp;

With a cruel smile, she reversed direction and just as
deliberately caressed her way back down Harriet�s body. The trip downwards took
almost twenty minutes. As she bent down to tickle Harriet�s feet, Caroline
could smell her cousin�s arousal. 

&nbsp;

Walking behind Harriet, Caroline turned her so that she was
staring at herself in the mirror.�
Harriet�s arms twitched as she thought of covering herself but she
resisted the urge. She had never felt so vulnerable, so exposed, so alive.

&nbsp;

Placing her hands on either shoulder, Caroline leaned
forward and gently bit down on the lobe of Harriet�s ear. �Can you feel how
your slut juices are just pouring down your legs?� Caroline whispered. She
watched Harriet stare at herself. �You were mine from the day you came into my
house but, tonight, I�ll own you completely.�

&nbsp;

Reaching for Harriet�s hand, she led the younger woman to
the bed. Pushing back on her shoulders, she forced Harriet to lie on her back.
Caroline grinned as Harriet writhed on the sheets. Caroline knew that the
erotic sensations coursing through Harriet�s body would overload her brain.

&nbsp;

Straddling her, Caroline continued her sensuous torture. For
the next two hours, she fondled Harriet to the brink multiple times. Based on
Harriet�s reactions, she fine-tuned her actions until Harriet was begging.

&nbsp;

Harriet was stuttering as she pleaded for something,
anything more. She was uncontrollably undulating, just aching for further
contact.� Her clitoris seemed to throb in
time with the beat of her heart.

&nbsp;

Suddenly, Caroline stood up and moved to the bell pull. At
Harriet�s mewl of distress, she leaned back over the
bed. �Don�t worry. We�re just taking a short break.� She poured a glass of
water and shared sips with Harriet as they waited for new sheets to be put on
the bed.

&nbsp;

When they were alone again, she ordered Harriet back onto
the bed. Harriet watched, fascinated as Caroline then donned a leather
contraption and buckled it about her waist. From an ornately carved box,
Caroline removed a darkly white rod about two inches wide and six inches long.
Carrying it in both hands she sashayed over to the bed.

&nbsp;

�My father brought this back from China. It is a solid piece
of ivory and I will be using it to take your maidenhood.�

&nbsp;

Harriet swallowed. Her toes were still curling from the
earlier activities but she was filled with trepidation at the thought of losing
her virginity.

&nbsp;

�Kiss it. Good, now lick it.� Caroline allowed Harriet to
become familiar with the instrument of her further education.

&nbsp;

Placing the rod in the contraption, Caroline moved between
Harriet�s legs. With small movements of her hips, she stroked the phallus
gently through the matted curls. Teasing Harriet with micro-thrusts, Caroline
kept going until Harriet was moving in unison with her.

&nbsp;

�Just relax,� Caroline warned as she drove forward, impaling
the younger woman in one smooth motion.

&nbsp;

Harriet took a breath to cry out in pain but let it out in a
breathy sigh as Caroline withdrew and then thrust again. She raised her legs to
coax Caroline deeper inside her. �Yes, yes, yes,� she cried as she was plowed.

&nbsp;

Caroline growled in her ear, �You�re mine, mine. Say it. Say
you�re mine.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, ma�am. I�m yours. Only
yours,� wailed Harriet as her long denied orgasm washed over her. The
sensations were astonishing. It felt as if the top of her head had blown off.

&nbsp;

Blearily, she blinked the spots from her eyes. Harriet
focused on Caroline who was poised above her. 

&nbsp;

�We�re not done yet,� Caroline promised with a smile. She
began to move again, slowly building up the pace as she approached her own
climax. �Take it. Take all of it.�

&nbsp;

Harriet gasped as she opened herself to the compelling force
of her cousin. She could not understand how her body was craving more after all
she had already experienced.� But she was
and so she moved with increasing desperation.

&nbsp;

Their tandem movements disintegrated as Caroline came.� Holding herself still, she reached down. With
a couple of quick strokes on Harriet�s clitoris, Harriet cried out in rapture.

&nbsp;

Once Harriet calmed down, Caroline eased herself out and
rolled onto her back. �Harriet,� she said. �I want you to clean yourself off my
tool.�

&nbsp;

Harriet looked at the rod, almost expecting it to be covered
in blood. It wasn�t, though. Instead, it glistened in the low light.

&nbsp;

She crawled down the bed and licked it like a lollipop. At
Caroline�s urging, she took it into her mouth and sucked until her taste was
removed.

&nbsp;

With both hands, Caroline stroked her breasts and pulled on
her nipples. The pressure of Harriet�s mouth was pressing the base of the dildo
into her. Fully recovered from her release, she was ready to go again. Reaching
down, she moved it aside to allow Harriet access to her skin.

&nbsp;

Caroline put her hands on Harriet�s head, guiding her to
exactly where she wanted Harriet�s mouth. With a few words of encouragement,
Harriet tasted every part of her cousin with her tongue. Her lips were finally
directed to find purchase on the hard bundle of nerves at the top of Caroline�s
furrow.

&nbsp;

Finally, Caroline exploded in orgasm and Harriet hungrily
sucked down her wetness. Her own pleasure had been mounting as Caroline danced
on her lips. She was panting as Caroline pushed her head away.

&nbsp;

Feeling Harriet squirm as she beside her in the bed,
Caroline thought about how best to continue to lessons. Lying with the phallus
sticking up in the air, Caroline smiled to herself as she had an idea. 

&nbsp;

�Climb up, Harriet. I want you to ride it this time.� She
jerked up on down on the rod a couple of times and shivered from the
aftershocks.

&nbsp;

Harriet balanced precariously on the bed and lowered herself
onto the rod. Her legs were shaking by the time it was sheathed within her and
she was only able to breathe in short gasps.

&nbsp;

�Now, up and down.�

&nbsp;

Obeying the order, Harriet raised up. The sensation was
strange; she had to think about squeezing and releasing her inner muscles while
flexing her legs. The intense feelings from earlier stayed
just out of reach. 

&nbsp;

She lifted and lowered herself for what seemed like hours.
Her arousal built but would not crest. No matter how hard she tried, she could
not bring herself off in this position. 

&nbsp;

She cried out, �Ma�am, help me, please.�

&nbsp;

�See, you can�t get pleasure from the superior position. You
need to be on the bottom.� Caroline rolled them over in a single motion and
began to thrust. In no time at all, the increased friction and pressure brought
Harriet to her much needed release.

&nbsp;

�Thank you. Oh, ma�am, thank you so much.� Harriet could not
stop babbling as her body shook again and again.

&nbsp;

Caroline slowly pulled out of Harriet�s spasming pussy. She
unbuckled the harness and dropped it off the side of the bed. Rolling back
over, she watched Harriet come down from the height of ecstasy.

&nbsp;

�How do you feel,� she asked.

&nbsp;

Almost sobbing, Harriet mumbled, �I can�t feel my hands.�

&nbsp;

Caroline laughed. �I�m glad you enjoyed it. That will be the
last time you climax without my permission. You�ll be punished if this happens
again.� Caroline brushed the bangs out of Harriet�s eyes. �I am pleased,
though, that you remembered to thank me. I�m going to ring for some nibbles.
Why don�t you go and get a basin and water and come back and tend to me.�

&nbsp;

Nearly stumbling as she made her way across the room. Her
bones were jelly and she was still shaking from her last orgasm. She filled a
bowl with warm water and, after glancing around at the oils and unguents,
decided to add a few drops of rose essence. She put a washcloth and towel over
her arm and then carried it all back into the bedroom.

&nbsp;

Martha was in the room, directing Jenny in remaking the bed
for the second time that evening. She glanced up and smirked at Harriet, nearly
causing her drop the bowl. Harriet lowered her eyes to the patterned rug and
scurried over to kneel down before Caroline.

&nbsp;

Caroline was reclining in her chair. She held a silver
platter on her lap and was smiling down at Harriet.

&nbsp;

�I had Martha bring us up a little something sweet to snack
on, as your sexual training took us right through supper.�

&nbsp;

Harriet could feel the tips of ears burn from embarrassment.


&nbsp;

�Don�t you have anything to say?�

&nbsp;

�Thank you, ma�am,� Harriet replied. Glancing over into the
bright eyes of the housekeeper, she ducked her head and muttered, �Thank you,
Mrs. Sims.�

&nbsp;

�You�re welcome, Miss. I know that the flavor won�t be as
good as the taste of your Mistress but I�m sure you�ll enjoy it.�

&nbsp;

Caroline laughed. �You�re sweet to say so. I can hardly wait
to get started on teaching her to appreciate and discern a variety of
vintages.�

&nbsp;

�Oh, My Lady. You don�t have to
worry. Believe me, she�ll never forget her first.�
Martha waved Jenny out of the room and took her leave with a slight bow.

&nbsp;

Dipping a slice of mandarin orange in the melted chocolate,
Caroline held it down for Harriet to take in her lips. She fed herself and
Harriet bites of orange and chocolate until the bowl was empty.

&nbsp;

�That was good, wasn�t it?� Caroline asked as she held her
fingers out for Harriet to lick clean.

&nbsp;

�Yes, ma�am. Thank you.�

&nbsp;

�You�re welcome. Now, then, wipe me down.�

&nbsp;

Caroline relaxed as Harriet wiped her body down with the
damp cloth. It was nice to have the evidence of the evening�s exertions cleaned
away. She knew that she would sleep so much better now.

&nbsp;

Leaning back in her chair, Caroline sipped from her snifter
of brandy. The rich taste coasted her tongue with her second favorite flavor.
She partially closed her eyes and watched Harriet in the soft glow of the
lamps.

&nbsp;

Harriet was on her knees before Caroline�s chair. She had
finished bathing Caroline�s body and was now working on her feet. At Caroline�s
suggestion, she was massaging scented oil into her flesh. Harriet was still in
a dream state from the days events and was not even
aware at how gently she fondled and caressed her cousin�s feet.

&nbsp;

�You may kiss them, if you want.�

&nbsp;

Caroline�s voice broke her out of her daze. 

&nbsp;

�Excuse me, ma�am?� Harriet asked.

&nbsp;

�I said you may kiss them.� Caroline languidly waved her
hand at the tender way Harriet was stroking her foot against her breasts. �You
very much look like you want to make love to them.�

&nbsp;

Harriet blushed. She had to confess that bathing her
cousin�s body and moisturizing her feet had rekindled her arousal. She actually
did want to taste her cousin�s skin again.

&nbsp;

�If you want this,� Caroline said, spreading her knees
slightly. �You�ll start there.�

&nbsp;

For a moment, Harriet studied the foot in her hand. She knew
it was freshly clean but she was still a little tentative as she puckered her
lips and placed a chaste kiss on the arch.

&nbsp;

�Mmmm,� murmured Caroline, appreciatively. �That does feel
good.�

&nbsp;

Encouraged, Harriet kissed the top and bottom and even
sucked each toe into her mouth.

&nbsp;

Slowly, Caroline exerted pressure to lower her foot to the
rug. Harriet followed the motion and was soon in a kowtow position so that she
could keep her lips in contact with Caroline�s flesh.

&nbsp;

�Now, give some attention to the other one.�

&nbsp;

Harriet obeyed without thought. She was soon licking and
sucking Caroline�s other foot and getting more excited herself as her nipples
dragged along the wool rug as she moved to lavish care on every inch.

&nbsp;

�Excellent. You�re making me feel very good.�

&nbsp;

Flushing with pride, Harriet glanced up into her cousin�s
eyes. 

&nbsp;

Caroline winked at her and asked, �Why don�t you work your
way higher?�

&nbsp;

�Thank you, ma�am,� breathed Harriet. She began to lave the
silky skin of Caroline�s ankles and calves with her tongue. 

&nbsp;

Caroline opened her legs and shifted slightly on the chair
to allow Harriet greater access. She was astounded at how quickly Harriet had
taken to carnal activity and secretly pleased at how well suited the young
woman was to sexual slavery.

&nbsp;

She lightly touched the blonde head that was nestled into
the apex of her legs and Harriet responded with pressing a kiss to her mound.
Biting her lip to suppress a moan, Caroline whispered, �Oh, yes.�

&nbsp;

Harriet had to pause a moment after her tongue made contact
with the rich nectar. She felt a shudder pass through her body as she savored
the flow of juice. 

&nbsp;

Not able to contain herself any longer, she began to dig her
tongue deep into Caroline�s channel as she sought the liquid at its source.
Quickly, her entire face was coated in Caroline�s essence and she moaned into
the damp folds of flesh. The feel and taste of her cousin under her tongue was
the most wonderful thing that she had ever experienced.

&nbsp;

She heard Caroline�s breathing increase as she flicked the
tip of her tongue furiously against Caroline�s hard clit. Harriet felt an
echoing throb between her legs and under her mouth as Caroline�s thighs tensed
about her head.

&nbsp;

Caroline glanced down in shock as she registered the shudder
that passed through Harriet�s body at the same time as her own climax.� She had never had a simultaneous orgasm with
a submissive before. Once again, her young charge had amazed her with her
facility for passion.

&nbsp;

�That was very interesting,� Caroline said as she stroked
the damp hair at the base of Harriet�s neck. �I am flattered that you came from
touching me but I did tell you what was going to happen if you came with
permission, didn�t I?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, ma�am.� Harriet�s voice
quavered as she tried to slow her panting and pulse. �You said I was to be
punished.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, I did. But you pleased me so well, that I�ll have to
defer it until tomorrow.� Caroline stood on shaky legs and walked to her bed.
She loosened the bed sheets at the bottom and waved Harriet over.

&nbsp;

�You may lay here at the foot and keep my feet warm.� I�ll let you know tomorrow what your
punishment will be.�

&nbsp;

Crawling between the cool sheets, Harriet felt a lassitude
creep over her body. She cradled Caroline�s feet against her belly and drifted
toward sleep. Her last thoughts before sleep stole her away were that once
again, her cousin was right. Harriet knew that she would never be the same
again.

&nbsp;

Part V � Caroline�s Realm

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

�Oof,� Harriet mumbled as something hard poked her in the
stomach. She blinked her eyes opened and was confused by the darkness
surrounding her. As she came more awake, she realized that she was still under
the covers of Caroline�s bed. The hard thing poking her must be Caroline�s
foot.

&nbsp;

�Uh, yes, ma�am?� she asked.

&nbsp;

�Crawl up and pleasure me.�

&nbsp;

Harriet obeyed with alacrity. The strong smell of Caroline�s
pussy made her mouth water. She was amazed that it damped after only a few
touches of her tongue. The taste of Caroline�s essence awoke her completely and
she focused all her attention on using her newfound skills to pleasure her
Mistress.

&nbsp;

�Good enough,� Caroline finally said. She tossed back the
edge of the covers. �Go with Martha for your morning absolution.�

&nbsp;

Crawling out, Harriet flushed when she saw the empty pot of
tea on the lacquer tray. While she had been busy under the covers, the
housekeeper had been in the room doing her morning duties. She ducked her head
and bent over by the door for Martha to take her to her room.

&nbsp;

�Oh, discontinue the three point hold until I say otherwise,�
Caroline called. �I�ve still got to punish her for coming without permission
and I wouldn�t want anything to send her over the edge.�

&nbsp;

�Got a hair trigger, does she?� Martha quipped as she took
hold of Harriet�s upper arm. �I�ll be careful.�

&nbsp;

Martha rarely spoke to her during the morning routine and
today was no different. Harriet obeyed the gestures and tugs and was quickly
made presentable. Martha did not make any attempt to dress her.

&nbsp;

When Harriet raised the corset from its stand, Martha shook
her head. �Your not to wear anything today.� Martha put down the brush and
asked, �Do you think you can make it to the dining room on your own? I�ve got
to get into town and I don�t have time to take you.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, Mrs. Sims.�

&nbsp;

�Don�t dawdle. You wouldn�t want to make her any angrier
than she already is.�

&nbsp;

Harriet swallowed. She had hoped that the orgasm she brought
Caroline to this morning would make up for the one she had without permission
last night. With her heart pounding in her throat, Harriet quickly walked to
the dining room.

&nbsp;

�Oh, good. You�re here,� Caroline called out as she took the
morning paper from Max. �I�ve decided on an appropriate punishment. Since you
came without permission, I think for today we�ll work on your control.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, ma�am. I�m sorry that I, uh, disobeyed you,� Harriet
apologized.

&nbsp;

�Well, you�ll learn better over the course of the day. Get
up on the table.�

&nbsp;

Harriet awkwardly clambered up and looked to her cousin for
further orders.

&nbsp;

�Now, come closer and kneel here before me. Spread your
knees wider. Wider. Good.�

&nbsp;

Harriet was completely exposed in this position. Her juices
were already visible coating her upper thighs. She had no idea what to do with
her hands. This was remedied with Caroline�s next command.

&nbsp;

�You are to touch yourself until I tell you to stop. Under
no circumstances are you to climax nor are you to beg for release.� Caroline
spread some preserves on her scone. �Begin now.�

&nbsp;

Before arriving at Hastings Manor, Harriet had never had the
nerve to touch herself. Since her arrival, she had never had the opportunity.
Now, she was expected to bring herself off while displayed for all to see in
the middle of the dining room. 

&nbsp;

Harriet was almost too petrified to begin. With a slight
whimper, she tentatively brought her right hand down over her mound and tickled
her fingers through her damp hair.

&nbsp;

She felt foolish, squatting on the table and running her
hand through her folds. She was surprised at how damp she already was.� Using two fingers, she even dared enter
herself. Harriet felt so humiliated that she was in such a position yet so
desperate to come.

&nbsp;

She was helpless as a wave of pleasure swept up from her
center.

&nbsp;

�Stop!� Caroline hardly looked up.� She rang for the maid. �Oh, Jenny. Please
bring me a towel. I need to protect my table from her slut juices.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, My Lady.�

&nbsp;

Her face flaming, Harriet wrapped her arms around her chest
and ducked her head to hide behind her bangs. 

&nbsp;

�Oh, since you seem to be forgetful about my directions
about you hiding yourself from me, why don�t you start this time by playing
with your breasts?�

&nbsp;

�Ma�am?�

&nbsp;

�Stroke yourself and pull on those slut nipples. You seemed
to enjoy my attention on them last night.�

&nbsp;

After a few minutes, the first jolts of pleasure were
shooting from her breasts to her cunt. She paused when Jenny returned with a
tea towel that she folded and put in place. Jenny was very careful not to touch
Harriet as she performed her task. Her time in the larder servicing the other
staff was still very fresh in her mind.

&nbsp;

�Open yourself,� Caroline requested.

&nbsp;

Harriet eagerly moved her left hand to display herself at
her cousin�s command and used her other hand to rub herself briskly. 

&nbsp;

Her arousal level quickly built and she was panting and
thrusting her hips into her hand in no time at all. It took everything she had
to obey the order to halt. Caroline directed to her begin again as soon as she
stopped panting uncontrollably.

&nbsp;

She was a shaking mess by the time Caroline finished her
meal and directed her to take her usual position in front of the desk. Harriet
had a terrible time concentrating on her typing. The burning need between her
legs had her ripping page after page from the carriage with numerous
misspellings.

&nbsp;

For a while, Caroline found the display amusing. Eventually,
the obvious signs of arousal triggered her own. Calling Harriet over, she
lifted her gown.

&nbsp;

�Get busy, Harriet. You need to get back to work. I�m still
expecting fifty perfect pages by the end of the day, you know.�

&nbsp;

Harriet was torn. She wanted so badly to pleasure her
demanding Mistress but her need and her fear about completing her day�s task
fractured her concentration. A sharp tug on her hair brought her attention back
and she was able to sigh in relief as Caroline sent her back to her desk.

&nbsp;

That day and next several seemed to fly by. Harriet spent
the time in a haze as she was trained sexually. Caroline gave her plenty of
lessons on how best to give her pleasure. Harriet passed many a happy hour on
her knees worshipping at the altar.

&nbsp;

Unfortunately, she also passed many a not-so-happy hour
aching with desire, as she continued to disappoint Caroline with climaxing
without permission. Slowly, she learned ways to hold off her own pleasure until
Caroline allowed her to experience it.

&nbsp;

Finally, the week was at an end and Harriet was waiting for
Caroline to do a final read through of her typing of an Indian tale of lust and
power between a woman Raj and her consorts. She was lightly stroking Caroline�s
ankles with her fingertips.

&nbsp;

�That feels good and reminds me of something,� Caroline
said, ringing the bell. She asked Martha to send Claire up to her room.

&nbsp;

�What? Why?� asked Harriet.

&nbsp;

�She gives excellent foot massages with her tongue.�

&nbsp;

Harriet asserted, �I can do better.�

&nbsp;

�How quickly you forget your place,� snapped Caroline. �Have
you forgotten how to address me?�

&nbsp;

�I�m sorry, ma�am. But what did I do to deserve this?�

&nbsp;

Caroline glared at her in disbelief. �You deserve nothing
but what I give to you.� 

&nbsp;

�Are you unhappy with what I�ve been doing? Am I not enough?�

&nbsp;

�It pleases me to have Claire�s head suck my toes and then
to work me between my thighs.�

&nbsp;

�I want to please you,� demanded Harriet.

&nbsp;

�Harriet, I see that I�ve been remiss. You will go find
Martha and tell her that I want you restrained by the window in my bedroom. I
will be up in a bit.�

&nbsp;

She wanted to argue but knew how futile it would be when
Caroline used that particular tone. Dropping her head, Harriet mumbled, �Yes,
ma�am.� 

&nbsp;

She wandered through most of the downstairs before she found
Martha berating one of the staff on the proper maintenance of the many ivory
netsukes. Caroline�s father had brought them home from a trip to Japan and
Harriet still blushed to see the many erotic poses of the figurines. 

&nbsp;

Harriet waited for Martha to finish and then stuttered out
Caroline�s wishes.

&nbsp;

�Ooh, you�re in for it now,� Martha chortled as she led the
way upstairs.

&nbsp;

She bade Harriet to strip and then come to the large picture
window. Pulling out a long cord from the wall, she attached cuffs to Harriet�s
wrist and then clipped her cuff to the cord. She repeated this with the other
arm.� She then cuffed both ankles and
secured a bar between them to keep her legs spread wide apart.

&nbsp;

�The gardeners sure have a good view today,� Martha told
Harriet, as she made sure that the sheer curtains were held open. With a final
pat on her derriere, Martha returned downstairs to her work.

&nbsp;

Harriet hung there for what seemed like a long time. She
tried tugging on the cords but they were well hung and allowed little play. 

&nbsp;

She straightened when Caroline entered and glowered when
Claire followed close behind her into the room.

&nbsp;

Caroline ignored her for a moment or two, while she removed
her jewelry and took down her hair. Finally walking over to the window, she
stopped and stared at the restrained woman. With a sigh, Caroline began to
speak in a low voice. �While I will allow you to feel proud to be owned by me,
do not think for a moment that it is acceptable for you to take personal pride
in the performance of your duty.�

&nbsp;

She began to pace. �You made several errors this afternoon.
You failed to address me properly. You addressed me in a disrespectful tone and
you questioned me. It is that last one that we will address first.�

&nbsp;

Coming to a stop before Harriet, she emphasized each word
with a poke from her finger. �Where, how, and who I take pleasure from is none
of your business,� she said. Holding out her arms, she demanded, �Claire,
undress me.�

&nbsp;

Harriet had to watch helplessly as another removed every
article of clothes from her owners person. She gnashed her teeth as Claire
gracefully lowered herself to the knees and kissed Caroline�s feet. Claire made
a noise production of her enjoyment of the task and every slurp was like a stab
to Harriet�s heart.

&nbsp;

Caroline sauntered over to the bed and bade Claire to join
her. Caroline lay on her back and enjoyed herself while the maid brought her to
climax. She shuddered slightly and then had Claire climb up and lavish
attention on her breasts while she recovered.

&nbsp;

Claire made sure to keep eye contact with Harriet as she
flicked Caroline�s erect nipples. Soon, Claire was smirking as Caroline pushed
her head back down between her legs.

&nbsp;

Yanking helplessly on the bonds, Harriet was in tears when
Claire was able to bring Caroline to her fourth orgasm. Caroline allowed her
maid to kneel beside the bed and masturbate to orgasm.

&nbsp;

�Oh, thank you, My Lady,� Claire hissed as she released.

&nbsp;

�You�re very welcome. You may return to your usual
assignments now.� Caroline dismissed the maid and rolled on her back to take a
small nap.� It was a warm afternoon and
she did not bother to pull up the covers. 

&nbsp;

Harriet could not take her eyes off her. As the light faded
from the sky and the room grew dark, she strained to affix the lovely sight in
her mind.

�

It was full dark when, well rested and relaxed, Caroline
stretched and rose from the bed. She washed her hands and then walked over to
Harriet.

&nbsp;

�You need to remember that my pleasure is paramount. If it
pleases me to have a baboon as a lover, you would do best to help me procure
one.�

&nbsp;

Her voice hoarse, Harriet answered, �Yes, ma�am.�

&nbsp;

Caroline released Harriet from her bonds and eased her to
her knees. 

&nbsp;

Harriet fell to her face and sobbed against her bare feet.
�I�m so sorry. Please, ma�am. Forgive me.� She covered them with sloppy kisses
as she begged.

&nbsp;

�That�s enough. I don�t want to ever have to revisit this
issue again.� 

&nbsp;

�No, ma�am. I�ll be good,� Harriet promised. She made no
complaint when Caroline brought her downstairs for a spanking delivered by Maximilian.
She gladly counted and thanked her cousin for each blow to show her how
repentant she was for her earlier lapse.

&nbsp;

Harriet was finding that disappointing her cousin had
terrible consequences for her flesh and her soul. That night, she spent the night
with an ache in her heart, as well as her ass.

Part VI � Caroline�s Realm

&nbsp;

The morning of the ball dawned crisp and clear. Harriet
could hear the excited voices of the servants as she followed her usual routine
morning routine. It almost disturbed her at how blas� she was about her
continual nakedness and near constant arousal.

&nbsp;

Right now, she was more concerned about the evening�s event.
Her cousin had not mentioned anything about the affair to her. Harriet was
growing increasingly concerned about her role and even more so about what she
would be allowed to wear.

&nbsp;

Mr. Chambers had delivered the last of the specialty crafted
leather yesterday but she had been given nothing further to put on. In fact,
the boxes had sat unopened in a corner of the parlor all day. 

&nbsp;

Several times, while she was on her knees after servicing
her cousin, Harriet had come close to asking about them. She�d managed to
contain herself so far but her eyes were constantly drawn in their direction.

&nbsp;

�Looking for something, pet?�

&nbsp;

Harriet glanced guiltily up into Caroline�s eyes. �My apologies, ma�am.�

&nbsp;

�Why?�

&nbsp;

�Excuse me, ma�am?�

&nbsp;

�Why are you apologizing?�

&nbsp;

�Because I was distracted.�

&nbsp;

�I guess that you�re really looking forward to finding out
their secrets, right?�

&nbsp;

Harriet was not sure exactly how to answer her. 

&nbsp;

Caroline stood up and pulled a small dagger from a sheath on
her thigh.� She grinned when Harriet
audibly gulped.

&nbsp;

�Oh, this is just to cut the twine on the package.� Caroline
crossed the room over to the box and snapped her fingers once.

&nbsp;

Harriet quickly crawled over to join her. She peered over
the edge of the box and saw lots of leather straps.

&nbsp;

�Give me your right paw.�

&nbsp;

Harriet cocked her head quizzically. She held out her right
hand and received a quick smile from Caroline.

&nbsp;

�Good.� Caroline put a strange sort of glove on her hand.
When she finished with both hands, she sat back and watched Harriet examine
them.

&nbsp;

The gloves had no fingers and the leather itself was very
tough, especially on the bottom. With the wrists buckled, Harriet had lost the
use of her fingers. She looked up into Caroline�s happy face.

&nbsp;

�I see that you need a little more help before you
understand how you�ll be presented at tonight�s event,� Caroline said. She took
out a handful of straps and set them out according to length.

&nbsp;

Without another word, she began to bend and shape Harriet
into the shape of a dog. After pads were put on her knees, she strapped Harriet�s
lower legs to her thighs. Then, she tied Harriet�s big toes together across her
buttocks. She even attached Harriet�s wrists to her legs. 

&nbsp;

Finally, Caroline was done. She stood for a moment admiring
her creation. �There is something missing,� she mused. With an �Aaha!� she went
to her desk and pulled out another bit of leather.

&nbsp;

She held the inch wide piece of black down near Harriet�s
nose. �Now, Harriet. Most people would have a big, elaborate ritual when they
offer the collar. However, you haven�t completed all your training and so,
technically, this is only a temporary collaring.� She leaned down and took
Harriet�s chin in her hand. �I expect good things of you. Don�t fail me now.�

&nbsp;

Harriet shook her head. �I won�t, ma�am. I swear.�

&nbsp;

�Thank you for your reassurance. You are a dog now,
though.� I don�t expect to hear any human
noises from you until this costume is removed. Understand?�

&nbsp;

Harriet nodded and, then seeing the raised eyebrow, she
barked.

&nbsp;

�Very nice,� Caroline said as she petted her. She buckled on
the collar and felt a certain rightness to her action.
She thought that sometime soon, Harriet would be able to earn one. She
certainly seemed to be falling naturally into her role.

&nbsp;

Clipping on the leash, she saw Harriet shiver delicately.� Her cousin was reveling in each further act
of submission. As a reward, Caroline used her fingernails to scratch the back
of Harriet�s neck.

&nbsp;

For the next hour, Harriet was put through her paces until
she could act like a dog. A very obedient dog who responded
instantly to hand and voice commands to sit, beg, heel and fetch. She did this
all on her hands and knees. 

&nbsp;

She was fed a light lunch of roasted meats and vegetables
from a bowl on the floor. She was also given water to drink in another bowl. As
she made a mess of her meal and her face, Caroline laughed and told her that
they would go back to hand feeding as soon as she learned to eat properly.

&nbsp;

Martha wiped her off and handed her leash to Jenny to take
her for a walk. Harriet balked when Jenny tried to lead her onto the short
grass near the garden.

&nbsp;

�Miss Harriet, I know we got off on the wrong foot and I�m
sorry,� Jenny said. �I was wrong to abuse you. Please forgive me.� 

&nbsp;

Harriet nuzzled Jenny�s hand.

&nbsp;

�Oh, thank you. Miss, you have to listen to me now. They
expect you to relieve yourself out here. You don�t want to miss this
opportunity and have an accident in the house later. Trust me on this.�

&nbsp;

Harriet looked into the sad eyes and, then dropped her head.
She wandered onto the grass and, after a moment of pacing around, squatted
uncomfortably. She had to close her eyes and think about rivers and waterfalls
before her muscles relaxed enough for her pass water.

&nbsp;

�Good girl,� Jenny praised her. She led her over to the hose
and gently wiped Harriet between her legs. �There you go. Now, back inside. Try
and find me if you need to go out again later.�

&nbsp;

Harriet licked Jenny�s hand and followed the young maid back
into the house. She was happy when Jenny returned her to Caroline. 

&nbsp;

�Was she a good girl?� asked Caroline.

&nbsp;

�Yes, My Lady.�

&nbsp;

�Thank you for walking her. I do appreciate your new
attitude.� Caroline winked at the maid before bending down to stroke down the
length of Harriet�s back. She smirked at the shivered response under her
fingers and from the maid standing beside her.�
�I think someone is liking this very much.� 

&nbsp;

Jenny stammered, �Yes, My Lady.� She then blushed when she
realized that Caroline had been addressing her comment to Harriet.

&nbsp;

�My, my. I think it may be time for
me to get to know you better.�

&nbsp;

Nearly swooning that she would be able to serve her
Mistress, Jenny curtseyed deeply. �Oh, thank you, My Lady.�

&nbsp;

�Go on, then. I�m sure you�ve got other things to do.�
Caroline watched the pert behind of the maid as she made her way out of the
room. 

&nbsp;

�You�re taking very well to your new role, pet. If I did not
know any better, I�d think your aptitude as a doggie suits you.�

&nbsp;

Even if she had been allowed a verbal response, Harriet did
not know if she could articulate how, as a dog, she found it easier to accept
the petty humiliations. It was almost as if she responded like a simple animal
because she was one. Dogs weren�t embarrassed and she shouldn�t be either.

&nbsp;

The day wore on and everyone in the house seemed to be
working themselves into a frenzy. Everyone
but Harriet who had no other task but to be a faithful companion to her owner.
She was even able to nap at Caroline�s feet for a brief period.

&nbsp;

Finally, it was time. Collared and leashed, Harriet sat at
Caroline�s heels as she stood on the receiving line. While most of the guests
were in fancy dress, there were a number wearing collars and in various stages
of dishabille.

&nbsp;

Harriet worked on keeping her eyes down and her ears open.
The looks in the eyes of Caroline�s guests was terrifying. She could see them
calculating the possible uses of her flesh and none of the answers boded well
for her.

&nbsp;

�She�s your cousin? How divine,� cooed a small woman. �I had to go with a savage, as none of my relations
is nearly as pretty as yours.� She glanced at the Nubian beauty standing two
paces behind her. �I was so lucky when Freddy brought her back for me.�

&nbsp;

�Oh, where was she captured, Lady Mallory?�

&nbsp;

�I don�t know.�

&nbsp;

�Does she speak English?�

&nbsp;

Lady Mallory twittered. �She understands it. I don�t see any
reason to allow her to mangle it, though. Her eyes speak volumes, though.�

&nbsp;

�How about yours? Is your puppy
housebroken?� she asked Caroline.

&nbsp;

�We�ll see.� Caroline glanced down. �Pet, greet my guest.�

&nbsp;

Harriet cocked her head in confusion. She did not know how
she was supposed to greet someone when she was not allowed to speak. Whining
softly, she gazed up at her cousin.

&nbsp;

Shaking her leash, Caroline tsked. �How do dogs act when
they meet new people?�

&nbsp;

Harriet thought for a moment and then crawled forward. She
pushed her face into the apex of Lady Mallory�s legs and sniffed. Backing up,
she looked anxiously up at Caroline.

&nbsp;

�Good. Now, how do dogs greet another animal?�

&nbsp;

Harriet swallowed before crawling around behind Lady
Mallory�s slave. She sniffed delicately near the firm buttocks.

&nbsp;

�You can do better than that. Really root around in there,
girl,� Lady Mallory called loudly.

&nbsp;

Squirming her nose between the flanks of the ebony skinned beauty, Harriet took several deep breaths of the musky
scent. A short tug on her collar brought her head up.

&nbsp;

�Well done, bitch. Go back to your owner.�

&nbsp;

Obediently, Harriet moved back to the relative protection of
Caroline�s presence. She felt slightly queasy and it wasn�t until she felt the
gentle touch of her cousin�s fingers through her hair that she was able to calm
her pounding heart.

&nbsp;

Instinctively, she rubbed her cheek against Caroline�s leg.
This physical contact between her and her owner was enough to help her regain
her equilibrium. She still wasn�t entirely enjoying being an object and
plaything but she would do what she had to in order to please her cousin.

&nbsp;

Soon after the last arrival, the musicians began playing.
Caroline wandered the room, speaking to each of her guests and sipping from her
quickly refilled glass of champagne.

&nbsp;

After a couple of hours, her leash was handed to Maximilian
and she was led up to her room. Waiting in the room was Sarah, who quickly
unbuckled everything and allowed Harriet to stand up for the first time in
twelve hours.

&nbsp;

�Do you need to relieve yourself?�

&nbsp;

Harriet nodded. She didn�t know if she was allowed to talk
yet.

&nbsp;

She was sent into the bathroom to do her business and then
returned to stand before the maid to await her next order.

&nbsp;

�Here.� Sarah handed her a blood red leather half corset.� It covered from her hips to the underside of
her breasts. �Put this on.� 

&nbsp;

Harriet wiggled and shimmied her way into the tight costume
and stood still while Sarah made it even tighter.� She was then directed to pull on a pair of
silk stockings and attach them to the garter straps hanging from the front and
back of the corset. Sarah made sure that her seams were straight and then
picked up the leash.

&nbsp;

Sarah pulled her back downstairs and handed the leash to
Maximilian the next time he passed near the open door to the ballroom. She was
really struggling to remember how to walk in heels and it didn�t help that he
hardly looked to make see that she kept up when he pulled her through the crowd
toward the bright center. 

&nbsp;

Things had changed greatly.�
Chairs had been brought in and the women in the center of the crowd were
all comfortably arranged in a circle. The number of guests was down
significantly from before. Most of those left had slaves kneeling or standing
beside them. 

&nbsp;

Caroline smiled as she received the leash. �Thank you, Max.
Would you like a sip of bubbly, my dear?�

&nbsp;

Nodding gratefully, Harriet took a sip from her cousin�s
glass. At the raised eyebrow, she curtsied and then lowered herself to her
knees.

&nbsp;

�She�s very beautiful,� said one of the guests.

&nbsp;

Another added, �Yes, it was hard to tell as a dog but she is
quite a bonny lass.�

&nbsp;

�Why, thank you. She needed a lot of help when she arrived
in my household but, with effort, she�s managed to turned
out well.�

&nbsp;

�You do have a way with the making of sluts, Lady Caroline.�

&nbsp;

�I can but work with what I�m given.� Caroline smiled
depreciatively.

&nbsp;

�Will she perform for us?�

&nbsp;

Harriet�s head snapped up to catch the eye of the
questioner. Lady Mallory looked particularly cruel in the soft light with her
fist full of dark skin.

&nbsp;

�If she knows what�s best,� Caroline answered confidently.
�Have we got suggestions?�

&nbsp;

Lady Mallory released the breast she had been groping and
gave her slave a shove. The African beauty fell to her face and quickly turned
to lavish attention on her owner�s tiny shoes.

&nbsp;

�Have her pleasure this.�

&nbsp;

Harriet looked across the circle in shock. Surely, they
couldn�t be serious. How dare they think she would rut with a commoner and
foreigner at that? She sniffed at the very idea and waited for Caroline to set
everything to right. 

&nbsp;

Caroline�s words were like a dash ice water.

&nbsp;

�Excellent idea, my dear. Would you have them both naked?�

&nbsp;

Harriet could not help the small gasp that escaped her lips.
When Caroline turned to face her, Harriet shook her head.

&nbsp;

�No.�

&nbsp;

�Excuse me?�

&nbsp;

�Please, ma�am. You can�t ask that of me.�

&nbsp;

�I can ask anything of you. Now be silent and obedient.�

&nbsp;

�No. I won�t do it.�

&nbsp;

Caroline�s voice was icy when she spoke. �You dare say you
won�t to me?� she asked.

&nbsp;

�Ma�am, I�m begging you.�

&nbsp;

�Enough. We�ll deal with your defiance later. Right now, you
will crawl on your belly to the center of circle and do your damndest to bring
that slave off before you cum yourself.�

&nbsp;

Harriet was trembling as she considered the consequences. Her
voice quavered as she shook her head. �No, ma�am. I
won�t service a slave.�

&nbsp;

For the space of two breaths, Caroline was silent as she
stared at her disobedient cousin. Raising one hand, she snapped her fingers for
Maximilian.

&nbsp;

�Take her upstairs. I�ll be up later.�

&nbsp;

Caroline did not even turn to see if her order was carried
out. Instead, she raised her voice to speak to the entire room. �I apologize
for the interruption. I�m afraid I over estimated how well the training had
been going.�

&nbsp;

�Don�t worry, dear,� Lady Mallory simpered. �Whoever would
have guessed that she had the spine to mutiny?�

&nbsp;

�Well, the Queen�s navy has a single response for that crime
and I�m in complete agreement with it.� Caroline laughed, shortly. �Now, who
else would like to take Lady Mallory up on her offer of the use of her slave?�

&nbsp;

Harriet heard nothing else as she scurried after Max. He had
a tight grip on the leash and her neck quickly ached from the uncomfortable
angle that she had to walk to keep up with him.

&nbsp;

�Idiot, girl.�

&nbsp;

�What?�

&nbsp;

�I said that you�re an idiot.� Max shook his head in
disgust. �If you don�t have a death wish, you�d do well to do everything in
your power to erase your recent actions from her mind.�

&nbsp;

�But��

&nbsp;

�No buts. Only your total obedience will put you back in her
good graces.�

&nbsp;

Harriet was silent for the rest of the trip upstairs. She
only nodded when Max pointed at a spot on the carpet and told her to stand
there.

&nbsp;

�Don�t move until you�re told otherwise. Her Ladyship will
be up here when she pleases and she�ll deal with you then.�

&nbsp;

Alone in the dark room, Harriet had plenty of time to regret
her refusal. She was still astounded that her cousin would put her in such a
degrading position. She had never been asked to pleasure any of the servants in
the house; how could anyone expect her to do so to a slave?

&nbsp;

She was stiff from standing in the same position when the
door to the bedroom creaked open. Her heart sped up as she watched her cousin
enter the room.

����������� 

�You know I was waiting for a spark of rebellion.� Caroline
said coolly. She stalked into the room and slowly pulled off her gloves, one
finger at a time. �I just hadn�t considered the possibility that you would have
the audacity to embarrass me in front of my guests.�

&nbsp;

Harriet wanted to plead that Caroline�s embarrassment was
nothing to her own but knew that she was in enough trouble.

&nbsp;

�You obviously are under the mistaken impression that you
have some sort of say over the use your body it put
to. You are wrong.� I own you. Nothing
happens to your body but what I choose!� Caroline�s voice had been rising while
she had been speaking. She was shouting by the last word.

&nbsp;

Harriet trembled.� She
had never been so afraid.

&nbsp;

Caroline snatched up a rattan cane and tapped it against the
side of her boots as she prowled the room. She knew that she needed to calm
down. Discipline needed to be done with cool head. She did not want to risk
doing serious damage to her property in her anger.

&nbsp;

After taking several deep breaths, she shook out her hands.
Walking to the bed, she took a couple of practice swings and grimaced at the
small cloud of dust. However, that was something that would have to be
addressed at another time. She had something else to tend to at the
moment.� 

&nbsp;

Caroline took another cleansing breath. Whirling to face
Harriet, she ordered, �On your knees.�

&nbsp;

Harriet dropped like a stone.

&nbsp;

�I am very disappointed, Harriet,� she said. �Your behavior
is a reflection on me and tonight, it was very poor showing.�

&nbsp;

Without a further word, she laid ten strokes against Harriet�s
ass and upper thighs.

&nbsp;

Harriet was sobbing by the second blow and could hardly
breathe through the pain by the fifth. She fell forward catching herself on her
hands as the rest of the blows fell on her quivering flesh. 

&nbsp;

Finished for the moment, Caroline stalked around to stand
before Harriet�s bowed head. She carefully set the cane down on the floor in
front of her cousin. Caroline grabbed hold of Harriet�s hair and wrenched her
head up.

&nbsp;

�I�m going back to the party. You�ll stay here and reflect
on your actions this evening and your level of remorse.� You are not to move one, single, solitary
millimeter.� She reached down and tapped the cane. �Keep your eyes here. When I
return, you will ask me for the rest of your punishment. If I find it sincere,
I�ll accept it.�

&nbsp;

Rising to her feet, Caroline whispered, �If you give me
reason to doubt the genuineness of your repentance, you�ll face more than a few
love taps.�

&nbsp;

Harriet sobbed and her tears fell, unchecked, onto the
carpet. She did not date lift her arm to wipe her eyes. As the time passed, she
felt horrified at her refusal and was terrified that Caroline might find it a
sufficient reason to turn her out of the house.

&nbsp;

When Caroline finally returned, Harriet fell abjectly onto
her belly and slobbered over her shoes. �Please, ma�am,� she cried. �I�m so
very sorry.�

&nbsp;

�I knew you were sorry the day you walked into my home. Now,
what do you think your behavior has earned?�

&nbsp;

�I�ll take anything, ma�am. Do whatever you want to me. I
deserve it all.�

&nbsp;

�Very prettily said but I want numbers. What would be
sufficient?�

&nbsp;

Harriet knew that the blows from earlier had already come up
in bruises. She really did not want to experience the cane again but knew that
her suffering was necessary.

&nbsp;

�Ma�am, I think that fifty blows would be a start.�

&nbsp;

Caroline was surprised. �Fifty? Do you really think you can
stay still for that many? Because I won�t allow you the
benefit of restraint for this punishment.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, ma�am. If it pleases you, I
can take it.�

&nbsp;

�All right. Prepare yourself.�
Caroline retrieved the cane and surveyed her target. She would only have asked
for fifteen more strokes but she knew that the receiving of the full amount
would be necessary for both of them to move forward past this incident.

&nbsp;

A strict but not cruel Mistress, she only hesitated for
another moment before she began to methodically carry out the punishment. On
the count of twenty Harriet fell to her belly but she was able to get back into
position before Caroline could chide her. The rest of the strokes were finished
with the smack of wood on flesh nearly overwhelmed by wails of pain.

&nbsp;

Caroline left Harriet sobbing on the floor while she fetched
a dampened cloth from the bathroom. �Wipe your face. We�re not done yet.�

&nbsp;

She gave Harriet time to regain her composure. When the
hiccups had lessened, she tossed a blindfold onto the floor. �Put that on.�

&nbsp;

Harriet sniffed back her tears and slid the soft cloth over
her swollen eyes.

&nbsp;

�Open your mouth.�

&nbsp;

Blindly, Harriet obeyed. She nearly choked when something
was shoved into her mouth. She started to suck on the three-inch projection as
Caroline buckled a harness behind her head.

&nbsp;

�Back on all fours.�

&nbsp;

Harriet could sense Caroline moving around her. She startled
when something cool was dripped on crack in her ass.� She tried to relax as a plug was inserted
into her anus. She nearly cried in abandonment as she felt Caroline move away
from her.

&nbsp;

For a long time, she was left there in the dark with a
throbbing of her backside and things penetrating in her butt and her mouth. It
gave her a lot of comfort to suck on the plug.

&nbsp;

Harriet felt Caroline moving behind her and she tried not to
tense. She could not help but squeal into the gag when she felt something
slamming into her cunt. 

&nbsp;

Holding herself still after burying her phallus into
Harriet, Caroline pressed against Harriet�s bruised buttocks. Leaning across
Harriet�s back, Caroline whispered,� �You are completely filled. I�ve taken
away your sight so nothing can distract you. I have filled all your holes.�

&nbsp;

Caroline withdrew slightly and then drove back in to the
hilt. �I�m going to fuck you now and I will continue to fuck you until you
recognize what you are.�

&nbsp;

She put deed to word. Caroline continued to speak in a low
voice as she thrust in and out. �You are my slut. You exist solely for my
pleasure.�

&nbsp;

As she pounded into Harriet, she kept talking. �There will
be nothing in your mind but my ownership of you. Your body is just for my use.�

&nbsp;

Behind the blindfold, Harriet was seeing stars.

&nbsp;

�Feel
me filling you, taking you, using you.� Caroline�s voice and actions were
relentless. �I�ve taken your voice from you because there is nothing for you
say. You can�t even beg for more. All you can do is serve my pleasure. All you
need is my use of you.�

&nbsp;

Her
thrusts increased in pace and her words seemed to drop directly into Harriet�s
brain. �You are nothing and nothing exists but my pleasure. Dedicate yourself
to my service, my pleasure.�

&nbsp;

�Embrace
your role. I can feel you cresting. As you cum, you�ll know the truth.� Caroline
timed her final words with three deep thrusts. �You. Are. Mine.�

&nbsp;

The
gag muffled Harriet�s scream. Her entire body convulsed when the power of her
orgasm washed over her. Her consciousness faded and she sprawled senseless on
the floor. 

&nbsp;

She
didn�t regain consciousness when Maximilian carried her to her bed. Nor did she
awaken, when Caroline tenderly spread arnica oil over the mottled skin of her
buttocks and upper thighs. She even slept through the kiss her cousin pressed
to her lips and never heard the whispered, �Sweet dreams.�

&nbsp;

It
must have registered on a subconscious level, though, because Harriet enjoyed a
remarkably blissful rest that night considering the trauma of the evening.

Part Seven � Caroline�s Realm

&nbsp;

Harriet jerked awake. She felt a feather light touch on her
backside and shivered as she remembered what happened the night before. She
turned her head and saw Caroline standing over her.

&nbsp;

�Good morning, Harriet.�

&nbsp;

Harriet had to clear her sore throat. �Good morning, ma�am,�
she answered. Her voice felt thick from her tears and crying.

&nbsp;

�I trust you slept well.�

&nbsp;

�Better than I deserved, ma�am.�

&nbsp;

�Nonsense. You slept as you did
because you had been cleansed of your folly.�

&nbsp;

�What do you mean, ma�am?�

&nbsp;

�By cleansing? Let me start by
saying that I believe in progressive punishments, Harriet. Each subsequent
infraction results in more strict discipline.�

&nbsp;

Harriet shuddered. She was not sure she could stand anything
worse than yesterday.

&nbsp;

�But I also believe in wiping the slate following a
punishment.� Once you�ve been
disciplined, there is no need to dwell on the offence or to rehash the
incident. It is over unless you err again.�

&nbsp;

�I�m sorry I failed you, ma�am.�

&nbsp;

�You should be. However, you only failed one of my two tests
yesterday, so I am not completely dissatisfied.�

&nbsp;

�Two, ma�am?� Harriet questioned.

&nbsp;

�Yes. You responded perfectly as a dog. Your reaction after
you returned to humanity was duly dealt with.� As she spoke, Caroline scraped
her fingernails over Harriet�s exposed buttocks. 

&nbsp;

Trying not to squirm, Harriet nodded quickly. The touch
awakened her bruised nethers and she blinked back tears.

&nbsp;

�I would also think that our experiences
following the punishment has resulted in a deeper understanding of one
another.�

&nbsp;

Stretching the full length of her bonds, Harriet was able to
place a kiss on Caroline�s knee. �Yes, ma�am,� she avowed. 

&nbsp;

�Good.� Caroline looked up as Martha entered the room.
�You�re to stay in bed today. Martha will give you a sponge bath and a rubdown
with a healing ointment. You�ll be fed a light broth at mealtimes. I want you
to spend the day in rest and reflection.�

&nbsp;

�Thank you, ma�am.� 

&nbsp;

Harriet was not quite sure what she had done to earn the
pampering but she felt almost liquid when Martha completed washing her and
giving her a massage. 

&nbsp;

�There you go, dear. Now, try and sleep for a while. I�ll
send one of the girls up with something for you in an hour or so.�

&nbsp;

�Thank you, Mrs. Sims.� 

&nbsp;

Harriet closed her eyes and willed herself to relax. As any
tension in her back caused the bruises to throb, she tried to stay still. She
soon drifted off.

&nbsp;

�Ooh, those must hurt,� Claire said as she brought in a
tray. 

&nbsp;

Harriet was disoriented as she woke for the second time that
day. �Pardon?�

&nbsp;

�I said those marks look horrible.� She put a pillow under
Harriet�s head. �How many did she give you?�

&nbsp;

�I asked for fifty.�

&nbsp;

�Fifty? Gracious, no-one in the house has ever taken so
many.� Claire stared at her in awe before shaking herself and offering Harriet
a spoon of chicken broth.

&nbsp;

Harriet swallowed the unseasoned liquid and felt it warming
her from the inside out. When the bowl was empty, Claire wiped her mouth and
removed the pillow.

&nbsp;

�Mrs. Sims says that I�m to offer you the bedpan.�

&nbsp;

Blushing, Harriet shook her head. �No, thank you.�

&nbsp;

�It�ll be the last time someone will be here until dinner.�

&nbsp;

�Oh.� Harriet resigned herself to relieving herself in front
of the maid. �I guess I need it then, if you don�t mind.�

&nbsp;

�All right.� Pulling out the pillow
that raised Harriet�s hips, Claire slid the smooth enamel between the bound
open legs. When Harriet didn�t release right away, Claire slid her hand under
the young woman and gently palpitated her bladder. �Go ahead. Just let go.�

&nbsp;

The words had a strange resonance in Harriet�s head. Her
brow furrowed as she repeated them to herself, �Just let go.� As sound of her
urine splashing in the bedpan echoed in the room, she suddenly remembered every
word that Caroline had said to her the night before.

&nbsp;

�I am hers,� Harriet whispered.

&nbsp;

Claire laughed as she swiped a damp rag between Harriet�s
legs. �You�re only now realizing that?�

&nbsp;

�I know it now. I really know it.� Harriet pulled slightly
against the bonds that held her to the bed. �Please, you need to release me so
I can go to her.�

&nbsp;

�No, I don�t. You�re to stay in bed all day. I heard her
Ladyship tell Mrs. Simms that herself.�

&nbsp;

�But��

&nbsp;

�Trust me, Miss Harriet. That she owns you will be one of
many revelations you will come to today.� She patted Harriet�s shoulder. �Just
leg go and they�ll come to you.�

&nbsp;

Harriet sighed and tried to calm down. 

&nbsp;

�Good girl. Now, someone will be back with dinner.�

&nbsp;

For a while after she had been left alone, Harriet twisted
and shifted restlessly. She wanted to be downstairs with her owner, not up
here. Eventually, she responded to her recovering body demands and she fell
asleep. 

&nbsp;

It was an uneasy rest. She was plagued with a number of
dreams. In many of them, Caroline was standing over her, repeating again and
again, that she was very disappointed. A few had her lost in the darkness,
trying to locate the voice that called her to service.

&nbsp;

Harriet finally pulled herself awake after a particularly
disturbing dream of her standing over a bound Caroline. Harriet saw her
dream-self holding a bullwhip. Caroline had yelled, �Nothing could hurt me as
bad as your refusal to obey.�

&nbsp;

Stunned, Harriet lay on the sweat soaked sheets and cried.
She realized that her disobedience did not just result in a set of spectacular
bruises. She had damaged her relationship with her cousin. 

&nbsp;

When she arrived at Hastings Manor, she had simply obeyed
her cousin in exchange for a place to stay. Now, she knew that submitting to
her powerful cousin was essential for her well-being. 

&nbsp;

The fucking she received last night (and she blushed as she
thought the word) affected her more profoundly than the beating. With the cane,
Caroline had exposed the false pride that hid her true heart. It was with the
phallus, though, that Caroline had plumbed her depths.

&nbsp;

Harriet lay quietly, thinking over her actions of the past
several weeks. There were many times that she had balked. It was as if she had
been a child, testing the limits of parental control. Last night�s outright
refusal had been her most egregious but there were many other small acts of
defiance that Caroline had had to deal with.

&nbsp;

Like a parent, Caroline had not withdrawn her affection
because of Harriet�s rebellion. From her actions in the room today, Harriet
knew that her cousin had forgiven her. Harriet was extremely grateful for her
cousin�s continued affection and support. 

&nbsp;

The hours passed as she mused about her situation and
Harriet was startled out of her reverie by a knock on the door.

&nbsp;

�Yes,� she called.

&nbsp;

A young maid entered the room. She bobbed a curtsey and set
the tray down with shaking hands. She fed a bowlful of broth to Harriet without
speaking a single word. Several times, Harriet caught the young woman�s eyes
staring at her backside.

&nbsp;

As quietly as she arrived, the maid packed up her tray and
left. Harriet fell asleep again. 

&nbsp;

Martha came into the darkened room and roused the slumbering
Harriet. �Do you need the bed pan?�

&nbsp;

Dazed but utterly compliant, Harriet said, �Yes, please.�

&nbsp;

She had just been cleaned when she felt the air change in
the room. Turning her head, she saw that Caroline had entered. She could not
help the smile that blossomed on her lips.

&nbsp;

�Hello, Harriet. Have you had a productive day?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, ma�am.� Harriet could not
find the words to convey how pleased she was to be in her owner�s presence.

&nbsp;

Caroline inclined her head in recognition of the intense
emotions. �Excellent.� Leaning over, she examined Harriet�s back and legs.
�Martha, could you bring me the arnica?�

&nbsp;

Harriet nearly swooned when Caroline began applying the cool
oil to her butt and upper thighs. �You are healing quickly but I think another
day of bed rest will do you good.�

&nbsp;

�Oh, no, ma�am,� Harriet replied. �Please, let me serve you
or just be with you. I don�t think I could stand another day.�

&nbsp;

�You�re not going to get into the habit of saying no to me,
are you?�

&nbsp;

Harriet blanched.

&nbsp;

�I�m just making fun, dear Harriet. I will agree to let you
up tomorrow but I don�t want to hear a single word or sound of complaint.�

&nbsp;

�Of course, ma�am.� Harriet
breathed a little easier.

&nbsp;

�Go to sleep now and I will see you in the morning.�

&nbsp;

�Good night, ma�am. Thank you.�

&nbsp;

Caroline dropped a quick kiss on Harriet�s temple. �Good
night, Harriet.� She left the room and seemed to take all the light with her.

&nbsp;

Harriet felt a prickle of tears but comforted herself
knowing that she would not be alone when tomorrow dawned. She fell asleep with
a smile on her face and it was still there when Martha came in to rouse her.

&nbsp;

�Up we go.� Martha very gently coaxed her out of bed. She
kept Harriet from having to put much weight on her still tender backside and
helped her into the bathroom.

&nbsp;

Harriet was anxious to complete her morning routine and to
be allowed downstairs. Martha had to reprimand her to brush all of her teeth
but soon the two of them were walking downstairs. Martha in
her crisp black uniform and Harriet wearing nothing at all.

&nbsp;

She nearly ran across the dining room toward Caroline.
Flinging herself to her knees, she kissed both of her cousin�s shoes before
sitting back. She winced slightly when her buttocks came in contact with her
heels but uttered not a word.

&nbsp;

�Good morning, Harriet. I�m glad to see you looking so
bright eyed today. After breakfast, I want you to work on finishing the last
chapter of the Eastern tales. I�ve got a publisher interested in looking over
them and I want to send them off tomorrow.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, ma�am. I only have about
fifty pages left to copy.�

&nbsp;

�Good.� Caroline set a plate of eggs on the floor with a few
pieces of bacon crumbled in them. �I believe these will go down nicely after a
day of only broth.�

&nbsp;

Harriet eagerly bent her face to the plate and lapped up
some of the still warm food. �Oh, ma�am. It is
delicious,� she replied. 

&nbsp;

�Don�t speak around a mouthful of food. You�re not a
savage.�

&nbsp;

Blushing, Harriet slowed down and swallowed. �I�m sorry,
ma�am. I forgot myself.�

&nbsp;

�You should endeavor not to let that happen. I allow you
some leeway because you unfortunately have bad blood running in your veins. You
should never forget that you also have my blood circulating in your system.�

&nbsp;

Harriet nodded. She was so pleased that her cousin
acknowledged kinship that she did not bristle at the dig to her mother.

&nbsp;

�Are you through?� Caroline asked. �Let�s go into the study.
I think I�ll have you work in here today.� 

&nbsp;

Eagerly, Harriet followed her down the hallway. She was very
stiff and sore but none of it meant anything if she could be beside her owner.

&nbsp;

Throughout her mornings work, Harriet would squirm slightly
on her perch and glance at Caroline. Her cousin was busy with her own work and
ignored the naked young woman impaled across the room.

&nbsp;

It was nearing high tea when Harriet announced, �I�m
finished, ma�am.�

&nbsp;

�Very good. Bring the pages to me.�

&nbsp;

Harriet rose up and looked longingly at her chair. Not that
she would admit it but she was starting to miss it when there was nothing
penetrating her rear opening. She carried the typed pages over and knelt beside
Caroline before offering them to her.

&nbsp;

She was content to lightly run her fingers over the hem of
Caroline�s skirt while her cousin read over her work.

&nbsp;

�You�ve done a good job, Harriet,� said Caroline, reaching
down and stroking Harriet�s golden hair. �I�ve got something for you.� 

&nbsp;

She reached to the table beside her chair and picked up a
leather bound volume. It looked like one of the books that she had been
transcribing from. Harriet took hold of it and glanced up.

&nbsp;

�Do you want me to start on this one next?�

&nbsp;

Caroline laughed. �Open it, silly.�

&nbsp;

Doing so, Harriet saw that all the pages were blank. She
glanced quizzically up at her cousin.

&nbsp;

�I want you to begin keeping a journal of your experiences.
I think that your development has wroth numerous changes in you. The action of
writing them down will be helping in reconciling your mind with what your body tell you.�

&nbsp;

�My body, ma�am.�

&nbsp;

�Yes. Your quick responsiveness and your carnal nature are
proof enough. You�re a natural slut.�

&nbsp;

Harriet blushed hotly and glanced down at the book. She
thought for a moment. �This will help, ma�am?�

&nbsp;

�I believe so. I only want you to live up to your
potential.�

&nbsp;

�Then, I�ll do it, ma�am.�

&nbsp;

�Very good. I want you to take it upstairs
and start by writing your thoughts from yesterday.�

&nbsp;

Harriet started to rise.

&nbsp;

�However, first I have a task for you.� Caroline smiled down
at her. �I want you to give me pleasure.�

&nbsp;

Almost fainting with anticipation, Harriet reached for
Caroline�s skirt. She was surprised when Caroline reached out and held her back
with her foot.

&nbsp;

�It will please me to see you couple with another.�

&nbsp;

�Ma�am?�

&nbsp;

Caroline rang the bell and sent the servant who responded to
get Jenny. She watched Harriet caress her foot as she stared up at her.

&nbsp;

�You�ll do this for me, won�t you.�

&nbsp;

Swallowing, Harriet nodded. At the raised eyebrow, she
stuttered. �Yes, ma�am. Whatever you
want.�

&nbsp;

�I�m glad to hear that.� Caroline looked up when Jenny came
diffidently into the room.� �Both of you
stand before me.� She smiled at the quick response. �Strip.�

&nbsp;

There was a little hesitation before they obeyed. In short
order, both women stood uneasily for Caroline to visually inspect them.

&nbsp;

Harriet cut her eyes over to the maid and could not help but
to admire her form. �What is happening to me?� she wondered. �I�m ogling
another woman!� She dragged her attention back to Caroline and met her amused
eyes.

&nbsp;

�You want to touch her, don�t you?�

&nbsp;

Harriet blushed but would not have been able to deny how the
pulse between her legs quickened at the thought. She jerked her head up and
down.

&nbsp;

�Turn towards each other and kiss.� Caroline watched as the
two beauties before her obeyed her orders. Soon the kissing led to fondling and
the two amorous women could not keep their hands off one another.

&nbsp;

�Very nice. Remember, though, that
you�re performing for me. It pleases me to see you both enjoying yourselves but
I should be the one that you burn to arouse.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, ma�am,� answered Harriet and Jenny
in unison.

&nbsp;

As they went back to kissing and touching, they made sure
that as their lips touched and their hands moved, that
Caroline�s view was unobstructed. Soon, both of them were shaking from their
mounting arousal. 

&nbsp;

Harriet could hardly stand upright and she was grateful when
Caroline ordered them to onto the floor.

&nbsp;

�I know that your ass is still painful, Harriet, so you are
to be on top. Jenny, I want you to lay down on your
back with your head toward me.�

&nbsp;

There was an awkward few moments as the two women got
themselves into a classic 69. Harriet shivered as she felt Jenny�s breath on
the dampness between her legs.

&nbsp;

�Start slowly. There is no need to rush.�

&nbsp;

Caroline had a wonderful view as the two women tentatively
began kissing and licking one another. She nearly laughed as Harriet�s arms
buckled at the first contact of a tongue on her clit. She knew that Harriet
finally understood the fullness of cunnilingus. When she saw Harriet�s head
bobbing stop as she enjoyed the caress, she called out. �Harriet. Don�t forget
that your partner is aching as much as you are.�

&nbsp;

Immediately, Harriet pressed an apologetic kiss on Jenny�s
inner thigh. She then turned her focus on putting all the lessons she had
learned on her knees before her cousin into place for the maid lying beneath
her.

&nbsp;

�I want to hear you.�

&nbsp;

At Caroline�s request, the two women released the moans that
they had been stifling. They also before to allow their lapping and slurping of
the other�s cunts to be

&nbsp;

Harriet�s head was swimming. She was so close to coming but
she knew that she had not been given permission. She twisted and arched to get
away from Jenny�s maddening tongue.

&nbsp;

Relaxing in her chair, Caroline passed a hand over her stiff
nipples. She admired the erotic struggle as both women tried to hold off their
orgasm. Knowing that Harriet was near to bursting, she relented. �Now, my precious. Come for me.�

&nbsp;

Within two tongue swipes of the command, the women climaxed.

&nbsp;

�Don�t stop now,� Caroline called.

&nbsp;

Through their shudders of pleasure, Harriet and Jenny
continued to tongue fuck each other.�
They writhed and sweated through two more climaxes before Caroline
clapped.

&nbsp;

�Well, done. No, you�re not done yet,� she warned when they
would have moved apart. �Clean each other.�

&nbsp;

Harriet bent her head and began to clean off Jenny�s essence
from her damp hair and where it had dripped between her ass cheeks. She could
feel herself flushing when she realized that Caroline was kneeling beside her.

&nbsp;

�That�s it. Get your tongue all the way in there.� Caroline
patted her rump gently, mindful of the bruises. �Doesn�t that just feel so
naughty? Your nose and tongue are filled with the basest of scents and tastes.�

&nbsp;

Harriet felt her heart beat speed up. Her womb was still
clenching from the aftershocks of her orgasm. With her tongue deep in the
crevice of Jenny�s ass, she felt conflicted about her urges.

&nbsp;

Seeming to read her mind, Caroline whispered,� �Listen to your
body,� Caroline whispered. �You want to do this. Your body knows the truth of
who you are.� She leaned closer and ran her tongue along the shell of Harriet�s
ear. �I can hardly wait to have your tongue bathe me there. Can you?�

&nbsp;

More than anything else, the promise in that tone convinced Harriet to work her way deeper until her
tongue made contact with the tight ring of muscle guarding Jenny�s innermost
secrets. She nearly whined when a hand in her hair pulled her head back from
her goal.

&nbsp;

�Thank you, Harriet,� her cousin said. �Now, I want you to
go upstairs and begin work in your journal. Jenny, you can continue your
chores.�

&nbsp;

Standing on rubber legs, they both thank Caroline for their
pleasure and she sent them off. Harriet carried her book to her room. She
chewed on her pencil end for a moment but when she began to write about her
feelings, the words seem to flow onto the pages. She wrote for an hour before
her tiredness caught up with her and she fell asleep on top of the covers.

Part VIII � Caroline�s Realm

&nbsp;

While Caroline felt stirred after witnessing her cousin and
the maid coupling, she had too many things scheduled that afternoon. Instead of
indulging herself, she turned her attention back to the reports from her
bankers about the status of her investments.

&nbsp;

She had financed several expeditions into Africa for gold
and diamonds and was anxious to find out the results. Her head was deep in
numbers when a racket at the door disturbed her.

&nbsp;

Maximilian�s voice could be heard getting nearer arguing as
a sizeable force overwhelmed him. He apologized as the mob broke into the
study. 

&nbsp;

�I tried to stop them, My Lady.�

&nbsp;

Caroline did not even bother to rise to greet her uninvited
guests. �What is the meaning of this invasion?�

&nbsp;

A skeletally thin man with a shock of white hair stalked
across the room toward her. �We have come to save your soul and the souls of
those you are leading into wickedness.�

&nbsp;

�Who are you?�

&nbsp;

�I am the Right Reverend Scruggins of the Plymouth
Brethren.�

&nbsp;

�God himself is not welcome to barge into my home without an
invitation.� Caroline turned her attention to a portly man in a dark blue
uniform. �Constable Harper. By what right do you bring these men into my house?

&nbsp;

�This warrant gives me the right.� The Reverend Scruggins
rubbed his hands together as he gloated. �I�ve wanted to close this den of
iniquity since your father�s days.�

&nbsp;

�Den of what?� Speak plain, Sir, what are you talking
about?�

&nbsp;

�You made a costly mistake when you enslaved a free woman.�

&nbsp;

�I beg your pardon?�

&nbsp;

Reverend Scruggins turned to one of his men. �Bring her.�

&nbsp;

�You�re bringing in yet another person to my house without
my permission?�

&nbsp;

�Yes. See, we had heard about your fornication ball and, so,
we sent in a young woman to seek the truth.� He turned and waved forward a
teenager. �She reported to us what you�ve done.�

&nbsp;

�I don�t recall ever seeing that woman before in my life.�

&nbsp;

�Erm, ma�am?� Maximilian
interrupted. �She is a temporary maid we hired for three days. We needed extra
help before, during and after the ball.�

&nbsp;

Caroline glared at her faithful servant. �And you did a
truly wonderful job of vetting her,� she snapped. She turned back to the
minister. �So? What does the word of this girl carry over that of a peer of the
realm?�

&nbsp;

�Don�t try that tone with me. Not even your high powered
friends can protect your from the repercussions of your perversions.�

&nbsp;

�Perversions?� Caroline spat. �It
is your abuse of Scripture that is the real perversion.�

&nbsp;

�Blasphemy! How dare you speak of
scripture? You�re a harlot.�

&nbsp;

�If I recall, Jesus had a special place in his heart for
whores.� Caroline shook her head. �Not that I am a whore.� I am a simple woman who has no idea why my
evening is being disrupted in this manner.�

&nbsp;

�You�ve enslaved and abused a free woman.�

&nbsp;

�What are you talking about? Everyone in my service is here
of their own free will.�

&nbsp;

�Really? Then how do you explain
this?� he asked, pointed at two of the men who entered the study with a dazed
Harriet in tow. 

&nbsp;

She had been sound asleep when they had burst into her room
and proceeded to drag her downstairs. They had not even bothered to cover her
in their haste to return with their prize to the study.

&nbsp;

�Oh, you poor, poor child.� The
Reverend moved forward and put his own jacket on her to cover her nakedness. 

&nbsp;

�What? Ma�am?� Harriet asked. She
tried to remove the coat and move over to her cousin but was held fast by the
men.

&nbsp;

�We�ve come to release you from bondage.� 

&nbsp;

Harriet looked to Caroline. �What�s going on? Are you
sending me away?�

&nbsp;

�No, I��

&nbsp;

�Silence,� he roared as he interrupted Caroline. �We are
here to rescue the perishing. You are coming with us, child.�

&nbsp;

�But I don�t want to leave.�

&nbsp;

�You know not of what you say.� Shaking his head in pity, he
smiled at Harriet. �Don�t worry, child. We�ll soon have you back on the path to
righteousness.� 

&nbsp;

�I belong here!�

&nbsp;

�You are a lost lamb who belongs with God. Don�t worry,
we�ll protect you.�

&nbsp;

�I don�t need protection.�

&nbsp;

�Oh, really? Then how do you
account for those marks on your backside?�

&nbsp;

�I needed correction.�

&nbsp;

�The only correction you need is found by accepting Jesus
Christ as your Lord and Savior.� He waved at his henchmen to take Harriet out
of the house. 

&nbsp;

�Noooo,� Harriet wailed as the men dragged her out. Her last
view of Caroline was her standing regally on the far side of the room. Her
bright green gown was in stark contrast to the somber black of the Reverend and
his men.

&nbsp;

The Reverend turned to follow them out of the house. �I�m
not going to rest until I save the others in the household.�

&nbsp;

�My staff is here of their free will. As
is my cousin.�

&nbsp;

�We�ll see if she says the same after we�ve saved her from
your perfidious influence.� The Reverend snarled,� �I only wish I had a warrant for your
arrest.� He waved his congregants out of the room.

&nbsp;

�Constable,� Caroline said in a deceptively mild tone.
�There will be a reckoning for this.�

&nbsp;

The uniformed man blushed. �He got a judge to sign the
warrant. That�s who you need your concerns to. I just carry them out.�

&nbsp;

�I�ll remember that.� Caroline crushed the heavy paper in
her fist and listened until the sound of the carriages had faded into the night.

&nbsp;

The three carriages hurtled down the drive as if the
driver�s wished to flee the grounds before anyone else was led into
temptation.� Above the hoof beats, rose the sound of singing.

&nbsp;

Harriet was in the middle carriage and she was sandwiched
between two large women. They had thrown a blanket over her naked legs when she
was thrust aboard but had refused to talk to her. They just sang hymns for the
duration of the trip.

&nbsp;

Finally, the carriages slowed and then stopped. Harriet was
led out of the carriage and taken into a church. The women who had shared her
carriage were joined by several others who took Harriet into a basement room.

&nbsp;

Unceremoniously, they stripped away the blanket and jacket
covering her. Harriet tried to pull away but the women kept a tight hold on her
arms.

&nbsp;

�What are you doing to me?� Harriet asked.

&nbsp;

�You must be cleansed before you can be welcomed back into
the fold.�

&nbsp;

�I�m clean. I took a bath this morning.�

&nbsp;

�We must wash the filth from that place from you.� The
largest of the women pushed her into a pool and began to scrub her thoroughly
with lye soap. The other women joined her and Harriet felt like the first layer
of skin was gone before they allowed her to rinse off.

&nbsp;

Once she passed inspection, they forced her into a white
robe and dragged her back upstairs. Harriet looked around at the dimly lit
knave. The dark stone and shadows were scary but it was the silent gaze of
those filling the pews that truly frightened her.

&nbsp;

Reverend Scruggins stood up and
began to preach. He gripped the edge of the lectern and leaned toward the
congregation. �We are
here today to witness what happens when there is a glorifying the homosexual
lifestyle. We should be worried and we should be concerned about where this
will lead.�

&nbsp;

Harriet felt the blood leave her face in a rush. She peeked
out of the corner of her eyes at the others in her pew to see if anyone is
staring at her.� Quite a few of the
congregants were.

&nbsp;

�Our nation is facing a disaster of great proportions! Of
that we can be sure. God said the land would vomit out its inhabitants for
lesser violations than what we saw today.� He struck his palm down sharply.
�Sexual abnormality is like a cancerous tumor on the society. If you let a
cancer spread, it will kill the host. We cannot allow that to happen.�

&nbsp;

Her fists clenched in her lap, Harriet realized that she was
hyperventilating. She tried to slow her breathing but his next words almost
made her retch.

&nbsp;

�You cannot believe the depravation we witnessed,� he
declared. �To know that a Lady is involved is another sign of how far we�ve
fallen as a nation. Is this the future we want? Or the hell
that we can avoid?�

&nbsp;

It seemed like the preacher was asking the question directly
of her. 

&nbsp;

He said, &quot;What these people need, who
live under the slavery of sexual immorality, is an abundant grace. It exists.
Therefore, we will encourage those who live in this manner to look at the grace
of Jesus Christ.� He pointed directly at Harriet. �We have rescued one such
unfortunate. Join me now in songs of praise for her release.�

&nbsp;

Harriet could not believe that the things he was saying
could in any way apply to her. The heights of passion that she had experienced
with her cousin must be too glorious to lead down to the depths of hell. It
could not be wrong to feel so good.

&nbsp;

The service continued on for hours and Harriet was bored to
tears long before the women dragged her to her feet and to the baptismal pool.
Before she could say a word, she was dunked under the water several times.

&nbsp;

Gasping for breath, she was then made to stand in front of
the congregation with the dripping gown plastered to her body. She could feel
the stares of the congregation on her barely concealed skin. She felt even more
naked in the thin and soaking shift than when she had been completely unclothed
in her cousin�s home. 

&nbsp;

The Reverend continued to rant about the desecration of the
body that she had endured. Harriet was cold and tired and she had developed a
terrible headache. She wanted to speak about what she was enduring now but the
dour faces staring at her kept her silent.

&nbsp;

The sun was rising on a new day when the service finally
ended. Harriet was put into the care of a severe looking matron. Entering the
woman�s home, she was directed to put on a dark and heavy skirt. She was also
handed a heavy wool sweater to pull onto her cold body.

&nbsp;

�I�m hungry,� Harriet said.

&nbsp;

�You�ll eat when I say.� The woman glared at her. �You�re
more trouble than you�re worth.�

&nbsp;

�Then let me go.�

&nbsp;

�Oh, you�d like that, wouldn�t you?� She dished up a thin
gruel and slammed the bowl on the table. �Don�t worry you�ll be going soon
enough.�

&nbsp;

�Good. I don�t want Caroline worrying about me.�

&nbsp;

�You won�t be returning there, dearie. You�re off to China
to repay the gift of life the Reverend gave you with service.�

&nbsp;

Harriet made a face. �I don�t want to go to China.�

&nbsp;

�You should be grateful that you�ll be given this chance at
redemption. You could have been left to suffer and then die and then suffer
some more.� The woman seemed upset that Harriet would no longer get that fate.
�Come with me,� she suddenly demanded.

&nbsp;

Harriet slurped the last of her soup and followed the woman
to a small cell like room. The flimsy mattress was a far cry from the one she�d
enjoyed in her cousins house and even less that what she slept on when her
father was still alive.

&nbsp;

�You�ll stay here until they come for you.�

&nbsp;

Harriet got into bed and rolled onto her side and pulled her
knees up to her chest. She felt a prickle of tears behind her eyes. Slowly, she
wiggled one hand between her legs to cup her mound. She didn�t stroke herself
because even in this place that was far from Hastings Manor, her orgasm still
belonged to Caroline.

&nbsp;

Except for meals and thrice daily trips to the loo, Harriet
stayed in the room for four days. On that day, she was given heavy woolen
stockings and clunky shoes and told to dress in the outfit she had been given
when she arrived.

&nbsp;

Harriet was led to the door where a carriage waited for her.
Once she was inside, the door was locked from the outside. Forlornly, Harriet
was able to peer through a chink in the wood as the carriage took her farther
and farther from Hastings Manor.

&nbsp;

She was finally let out into a scene of pure chaos. A group
wearing stiff, dark clothes was waiting for her. She could see a number of
ships before her and the sights and smells of the port were nearly
overwhelming.

&nbsp;

�Finally, you�re here. Our ship leaves within the hour. It
was not very considerate of Reverend Scruggins to send you with so little time
to spare.� 

&nbsp;

�Are we really going to China?�

&nbsp;

One of the men nodded. �Yes, sister.� Are you ready to spread the Gospel to the
natives?�

&nbsp;

�Uh, sure. I mean amen.� Harriet
looked at the group. None of them were looking at her with the disdain of the
Reverends flock. They seemed eager to get on their way and expected her to feel
the same.

&nbsp;

This was the perfect opportunity. None of them seemed to
suspect that her heart was committed elsewhere. Harriet waited until the first
members of the group began to board, she then told one
of the women that she simply must be allowed to relieve herself before she
could possibly get onto the ship.

&nbsp;

�I really have to go now.�

&nbsp;

�Oh, all right. There is a lavatory in that guesthouse. Go
quickly and join us on board.�

&nbsp;

�Yes, ma�am,� Harriet answered. 

&nbsp;

�The Captain is already upset that we�ve delayed this long.
You must hurry since you don�t want to be left behind.�

&nbsp;

Being left was exactly what Harriet intended. She walked
slowly to the indicated building and turned to wave at those on the gangplank
before opening the door. Quickly, she walked down the dark hallway. Opening
another door, she passed through the common courtyard to the next building. It
was a public house and she scurried quickly through and out the door.

&nbsp;

She was on the next block away from the ship. Hoping that the
carriage had not taken too many turns, she turned to go left down the street.
She walked as quickly as she could eastward. As Harriet hurried, she had to
duck the busy sailors and dodge the many horses that clogged the streets.
Several times she nearly lost her footing on the slick cobblestones but she was
so desperate to get away that she quickly regained her balance and moved
onwards.

&nbsp;

After walking all day, she reached the city limits as the
sun was going down. She hid under a bridge the first night and stole some
apples from a bin to break her fast the next day. She stayed to the side of the
roadway and walked only at night. She hunkered down in the tall grass whenever
people or carriages came down the road.

&nbsp;

After three days of walking, her feet were in terrible shape
from the uncomfortable shoes. Angrily, she tore them off her feet and hurled
them into a creek. She would do the rest of the miles barefoot. 

&nbsp;

She slept fitfully during the day under trees and bridges
and limped ever onwards when darkness fell. She was cold, tired, and hungry
when the manor house finally came into view. She stumbled to the back door and
entered through the kitchen. The scents of the food nearly make her swoon but
she ignored them and the excited cries of the servants.

&nbsp;

�What on earth happened to you, Miss Harriet?� Martha asked
as she stood before the pale figure.

&nbsp;

Harriet did not know what to say. There was just so much
that had happened to her but, right now, she had something more important to do
than rehash her past.

&nbsp;

�Where is she?� she demanded.

&nbsp;

�In the study but she doesn�t want to be disturbed.� Martha
shook her head, sadly. �She hasn�t wanted anything since you were taken from
us,� she confessed.

&nbsp;

Her mind clear, Harriet began to strip in the hallway. She
ripped the hated clothes from her body and flung them to the floor. Once she
was naked, she asked, �You can dispose of these, right?�

&nbsp;

�Of course I can.� Martha smiled. �Good luck.�

&nbsp;

Harriet walked proudly to the study and let herself in
without knocking.

&nbsp;

�I told you not to bother me,� Caroline spat out, hardly
looking up from her position by the French doors.� 

&nbsp;

Standing for a moment in the doorway, Harriet swayed and
swallowed. She had almost forgotten how powerfully her cousin�s presence
affected her. Even now, when Caroline was wan and pale, Harriet felt her heart
pounding from the beauty before her.

&nbsp;

Caroline was wearing riding breeches and knee-high boots.
The trousers accentuated her feminine figure by hugging all her curves and the
boots made Harriet�s pulse race. She wondered, fleetingly, if her cousin�s crop
was near to hand.

&nbsp;

Steeling her nerve, Harriet took a step into the room.
�Please, ma�am,� she begged. �Please let me come home.�

&nbsp;

Startled, Caroline whirled from the window and stared across
the room. �Harriet,� she breathed.

&nbsp;

Dropping to her knees, Harriet crawled across the room until
she was at her cousin�s feet. She pressed a kiss to the leather and knelt there
with her head down, praying that she would not be sent away.

&nbsp;

Caroline reached out a trembling hand and lightly touched
the golden hair. �I thought you were gone forever.�

&nbsp;

�No, ma�am. I could never leave
you. I belong to you.�

&nbsp;

�Are you sure?�

&nbsp;

�I�ve never been more sure of
anything in my life.� Harriet sat back on her heels and looked up into
Caroline�s eyes. �Nothing was right until now and I am back here, before you,
on my knees.�

&nbsp;

�But you could have had a normal life with the Reverend and
his flock.� Caroline looked concerned. �Speaking of that, where is the Right
Reverend Scruggins?�

&nbsp;

�I ran from them.�

&nbsp;

�So, they�ll be here at any moment to take you again.�
Caroline crossed her arms across her chest. It hurt to know that she was going
to lose Harriet as soon as the Reverend mounted another attack.

&nbsp;

�No, I waited until they had turned me over to a party of
missionaries heading abroad. They were going to take me to China.�

&nbsp;

�China?� Carolina repeated in disbelief. �That
bastard.� She looked down at Harriet with tears running down her cheeks
and thought that the girl had never looked more beautiful. She could see
Harriet�s need in the tension of her body.

&nbsp;

�Come closer,� Caroline ordered. She extended one of her
boots between Harriet�s legs and exerted gentle pressure. In seconds, Harriet
was writhing against the leather.

&nbsp;

�Oh, thank you, ma�am.� Harriet tried to maintain eye
contact but the pleasure from being fucked by her Mistresses boot made it
difficult to focus.

&nbsp;

�You may hold on.�

&nbsp;

Gratefully, Harriet clutched behind Caroline�s knee. She
rested her cheek against the soft fabric of her cousin�s slacks and lost
herself in ecstasy. She had missed this so very much.

&nbsp;

As she neared climax, she looked up into the stern but
loving eyes. �Please, ma�am. May I come?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, my darling slut. Come for your owner.�

&nbsp;

Harriet obeyed and shuddered repeatedly as she spent
herself. She kissed the fabric-covered knee and tried to catch her breath.
Caroline pumped her leg and Harriet came again.

&nbsp;

�Clean yourself off my boots.� 

&nbsp;

Immediately, the young woman had backed up enough to get
busy following the order. She was beginning to love the taste of herself mixed
with the leather. She also loved that these boots were thin enough for Caroline
to feel every swipe of her tongue.

&nbsp;

Placing a final kiss on the toe of the boot, she sat up on
her heels. Harriet�s eyes were clearer as she gazed up at Caroline. �Thank you, ma�am.�

&nbsp;

�You�re welcome.�

&nbsp;

�May I serve you? Please,� Harriet begged.

&nbsp;

�Later. You look very tired. How far have you come?�

&nbsp;

�I had to wait until we reached Portsmouth and they were
boarding the ship before I could make my escape.�

&nbsp;

�Portsmouth? That�s over a hundred miles. How did you get
back here?�

&nbsp;

Harriet shrugged. �I walked,� she admitted.

&nbsp;

Staring down at awe, Caroline asked, �But why?�

&nbsp;

�Please, ma�am.� It
wasn�t my choice to leave but it was certainly was my choice to return. If it
pleases you, I�d like to have no more choices but what you permit.�

&nbsp;

Caroline extended a shaky hand to pull the bell. Before she
could, the door opened and Martha entered with a strap of leather in her hands.
Her eyes were shining with tears as she held the collar out. �You�ll be wanting this, My Lady.�

&nbsp;

�How did�oh, never mind.� Caroline waved off the
impertinence. With the slim leather warming in her hand, she felt muscles that
had been tense for days finally relax. She straightened to her full height and
felt the joy of control running through her veins.

&nbsp;

�I
think you�ve earned this, now.�

&nbsp;

Harriet�s
eyes swam with tears. �Oh, thank you, ma�am.�

&nbsp;

�By
accepting this collar from my hands to your throat you acknowledge that you
willfully give up your personal rights and freedoms and grant to me the full
usage of your body and mind to do with as I see fit. You offer to me your
devotion, loyalty and complete obedience. I expect you to trust, respect and
honor me in all your actions. Do you understand and accept my terms?�

&nbsp;

�Yes,
ma�am.�

&nbsp;

�Once
I have placed this collar on my property, it may not be removed except by
me.&nbsp; It is not for the you to decide when and
where the collar shall be worn.�

&nbsp;

�I
understand. I won�t ever take it off.�

&nbsp;

�Welcome home, pet.�

&nbsp;

Harriet bent her head to receive the collar and then grabbed
Caroline�s hands after they had secured it around her neck. She placed kisses
on both palms and then dropped to kiss her feet. �Thank you,
