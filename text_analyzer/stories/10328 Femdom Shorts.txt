Summertime With Femdom

She bumped the double fold of her cunt against his crotch, feeling the comfortable tautness in her thighs as she straddled him, kneeling and squirming on top of his supine body. Somehow, in the bump and crash of stripping and making out between the door and the bed, they&#8217;d ended up that way, him on the bottom the way she liked.
He was naked, except for the black band of the collar at his throat and one sock, and she was stripped down to her skin, smooth, sticky with summer sweat but clean. They were both touched by the heat, his short hair in spikes, her longer hair haloed by summer curls. The fan turned its face like an indecisive sunflower, fighting the early August weather and failing to cool anything off.
His hands reached for her hips, and were captured by the wrists before he could do more than brush his fingers against them. She slammed them down against the mattress, even though his strength could easily brush her away like a gnat. But she wanted him there, and wanted him to feel at her mercy.
�Fuck me, bitch.� She hissed it, daring him. �I&#8217;ve been wet all day, waiting for you. On the bus, thinking about your cock. Craving it. So, fuck me.�
He bucked his hips, feeling the slickness on the head of his cock, the tight curls on her labia. It was a natural trick of anatomy that, rubbed together, things fit. Inexorably, all the wriggling, their struggling and then he fingers seeking the painful places on his body where he could be hurt worked to couple them together.
Inside her, his cock made itself a space, nestled up so the hardness was engulfed. She grunted, feeling its presence, making herself clamp down so the ringed muscle inside drove a tingle through her. She raised herself to a squat the planted her feet on his upper arms, still trying to trap them, and he looked up at her, seeing the stretch and shift in her torso, the way her breasts moved with her and the impacts. Balance made her release his arms so she could make their pelvises kiss better, but he kept his arms still.
�Lazy, fucking, slut.� She panted between thrusts. �Help me.�
The bed slid a bit, badly anchored as he added the bounce of his hips. She kept talking, low, her voice holding a little edge of loving malice, �Give me your fucking cock. Harder. Harder bitch. Harder, you little whore��
Her slap was clumsy, but she followed it with more clever pain, fingers jabbing armpit, finding the tuck into the collar bone, and skittle coloured painted fingernails leaving white scraped lines and fast puffing rose runnels. �You made me wait all day for this. I wanted you in the morning, but lazybones. You fucking slept in, you little bitch.�
�Ah, ma&#8217;am!�
�Shit. The thrusting got clumsier when she found her clit, and he was the sole lifting force in their fucking. �Don&#8217;t you dare wimp out until I cum.�
His forehead beaded up with sweat, but he forced himself to please her until she dug her orgasm out, between fingers flicking and the stretching and stuffing and devouring of her cunt, her words getting less and less coherent until they dissolved into lingering curses. �Ah� fuuuck!�
Her cunt homed and hilted on him as she came, hugging around the shaft, but it was just as much the rawness in her thrown back face, the flush and the open mouth that fired his balls. �Ma&#8217;am?�
�Fuck. Yes. Cum.� She sort of sagged, the sex tension pulled from her, her loose hair hanging in her face as she gave him permission to finish.

Slap
He&#8217;d spent forty-five miserable minutes sitting on the couch while she paced and slammed cabinet doors harder than she needed to, and got herself under control, and now it was time for the reckoning. The anger was gone, and it its place a certain sort of stern-hurt. In some ways he preferred the anger, but she never, ever punished in those rare moments when her temper surfaced, making him wait.
�I know you&#8217;ve though about what you said, and contrite as you are, you don&#8217;t really mean to take it back. Not yet. So I&#8217;m going to punish you.�
�Yes, Mistress.�
�I want you to stand for this. And think about what you said to me and why it was wrong.�
�Yes, Mistress.�
�Now relax your jaw a bit.�
She waited, watched to see he did as bid and her palm swung out and caught his cheek. �What you said was unacceptable.�
�I&#8217;m sorr��
�Not another fucking word, you little cunt.�
For her there was a sort of dreamlike drift, her hands batting into his face, alternating cheeks: right, pause to see his jaw and neck were alright, left, pause, right, pause, left pause.
She could see he was contrite, but still stubborn, saw the hurt in his eyes and felt the slight sting in her palm. He thought she was being kind and didn&#8217;t understand why she was insulted and hurt, �Do you even know why you are being punished?�
�Because� I said a bad thing, Mistress? I won&#8217;t do it again if it bother you.�
�If it bothers you?� She echoed. �Bothers?�What was it you said? You can never be what I want? You&#8217;re a loser, that I&#8217;m so together and I know what I&#8217;m doing while you will just fuck everything up? What sort of fucking bullshit is that?� She spat the words out like they were bullets.
She saw his head was still disagreeing, that he would lie to please her and reached out.��You are special.� Slap. �And beautiful.� Slap. �And mine.� Slap. A handful of hair on the back of his head made the handle she used to drag him into the bathroom, in front of the mirror. �What do you see?�
�It&#8217;s me, Mistress?� His reflection showed back a face strained with pain, his cheeks blushing from the slaps.
�Who does that� person in the mirror belong to?�
�You, Mistress?�
�Good. And do you say shit about anything else I own in my life?�
�No, Mistress, but��
�Who accepted your submissive self?�
�You did, mistress. I&#8217;m really grateful that you��
Her grip on his hair tightened again and her voice got loud in the small confines of the bathroom. �I&#8217;m not running a fucking charity. I don&#8217;t own you to martyr myself. I own you because you are special and precious to me. I don&#8217;t mind humiliating you. I like it. �But don&#8217;t you ever think for one minute you&#8217;re some burden I shouldn&#8217;t have.�
He was shocked out of further speech.
�Now you listen to me. No matter how bad it gets, I&#8217;m here for you. �and if you&#8217;re really grateful to be my slave, the least you can do is respect my authority on what I do and do not want. And we&#8217;re going to train you until you can honestly say you feel as worthy as I judge you to be.�
�Yes, Mistress.�

Pent Up
When they went to the couch, he automatically took a place with his head in her lap, his favourite spot. And her fingers combed through his hair, before setting in a curl that rubbed the sensitive spot at his hairline. In the kitchen, the dishwasher swooshed and squirted, cozy evening noises after dinner.
He was naked, but she was not, and he scrubbed his face happily into the velvety corduroy ribs of her pants. His cock was spending a lot of time erect this week, but the thickness had resolved itself at half mast after dinner&#8217;s teasing session.
Under the table, her feet had wandered, bare and squirmy, into his lap and she&#8217;d rubbed and teased just enough to get his attention. It was a particular kind of torture because he wasn&#8217;t allowed to talk about it. No begging, not even a thank you, not since Monday. It was Sunday now and she&#8217;d been keeping him from coming all week long.
It wasn&#8217;t the first time they&#8217;d done denial games, and even when he was free to touch and rub himself as much as he liked, she loved to find ways to tease him. She knew he loved the look of her in cotton panties, so she was always finding reasons for him to see up her skirt, sliding his hand up there or even, memorably on Thursday night, leaving a pair at the bottom of the lunch she made him for work, neatly ziplocked in their own bag under the snacking cucumber and ham sandwich on rye. And he hadn&#8217;t even been allowed to take them into the bathroom and edge himself to almost there. Or even text her the frantic feelings that had popped up as surely as his cock had started shoving against his khakis.
She brought a novel to the couch, but although she opened it to her place from last time, �Hard to believe that it&#8217;s been a week, hasn&#8217;t it?�
�Mmm?� He pressed his lips together, remembering how firmly she had told him not to comment. She told him she&#8217;d liked watching the struggle in his face.
�You may talk about how much you want it.� She laughed, �It&#8217;s printed in your eyes. But you know, I almost sort of miss seeing the way you usually grope and touch yourself. So, stand up!�
The instruction was punctuated with a nudge from her thigh, hinting he needed to get off the couch. He was up and in front of her, hands hesitating, his whole posture begging to touch. He hadn&#8217;t been allowed to for any reason but hygiene, and since they showered together a lot of the time it meant she&#8217;d been taking over even the opportunity for something furtive had turned into another tease from her he had to moan and squirm his way through without saying a word
But now her hands reached out, cupped his balls, balls that had ached to empty, and looped her index finger and thumb around the root of his cock&#8217;s shaft. After many months of cohabitation fuelled sex romps, she&#8217;d gotten really good, stroking and tugging in ways that could stretch the delicious torture out until his voice was pushed high up out of its normal range in desperation.
�Miiiiiisssss!�
She liked the velvety feel of his cock in her hand, liked the man-musk-smell, clean but deep and heady, and loved the slippery precum that beaded up. There&#8217;d been a lot of precum this week. Her smile widened, giving that little wrists twist that she knew he liked, letting the hood of his foreskin slide, slippery against the head of his cock.
�Miss! Miss! Please! Miss!� He was getting increasingly more incoherent, no longer able to keep his knees unbent.
�That&#8217;s it, kneel down, slut,� she said with mean-affection wrapping her voice into a purr. To get closer to her work, she was off the couch now, novel somewhere on the floor. �Go on, come for me!�
The hoarse burst of a thank you marked the end of coherence, as her hand tightened just enough to drive him over the edge and past the point of no return.
Hot cum, pent up, milky, half clear and half opaque, in glistening ropes shot up. It struck her chin and startled, she did react more than to turn her head as the second pulse landed half on the corner of her mouth and half above it. She laughed.
�Come kiss me, slut.�
