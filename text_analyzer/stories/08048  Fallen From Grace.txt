�What&#8217;s the master doing back home? He&#8217;s supposed to be away for several months,� Tom thought as he carefully dead-headed the roses, �And why has he come in the back way and in Lady Devereux&#8217;s carriage? She&#8217;s with him too. Oh, lor, he&#8217;s beckoning me over. Am I in trouble again?� Tom tried to stand upright and walk normally but the pain in his arse only allowed him to hobble in short steps. As he approached the closed carriage, his surprise deepened for inside were the cook, the head housekeeper and Betty the maid. All three had left his lordship&#8217;s employment nearly a fortnight previously, Betty having received a birching almost as severe as the one he received.
�
Worried at the angry expression on the master&#8217;s face, Tom respectfully doffed his cap and greeted them, �Good day M&#8217;lord, ladies.�
�
�Have no fear Thomas, it is not you who is in trouble. Know you the whereabouts of my daughter?�
�
�Her and Miss Juliette went riding in the Long Wood not an hour since, Sir. They are usually away for two hours or more Sir.�
�
�Thank you Thomas, now here&#8217;s what I need you to do.� 
�
�
�Oooow!� Jimmy the stable boy stood and rubbed his arse through the thin fabric of his breeches and felt the welt beginning to rise.
�
�Now perhaps you&#8217;ll learn to be a little more adept at your job, if not perhaps Danvers will offer you some encouragement like he did that gardener boy the other day.� 
�
�He ought to have another on the bare for such incompetence,� Juliette exclaimed, �A real hard one.�
�
Victoria turned and smiled at her friend, �You are right of course dear, he probably hardly felt that one through the cloth and we should see the effect it has.�
�
Jimmy&#8217;s protests went unheeded and he knew her threats to have him birched were very real even though he&#8217;d done nothing wrong. The master had left his daughter in charge of the estate and she had deliberately thrown her horse&#8217;s reins where he couldn&#8217;t catch them and waited until he stooped to pick them up before lashing his bottom with her riding whip.
�
�Drop them boy or you&#8217;ll end up on the whipping bench for a session with the birch for your insubordination� Victoria ordered again. Reluctantly and blushing, the fifteen year old boy did so. Sliding adroitly from their mounts, the two girls walked around him and commented on the small size of his pego before ordering him to bend over and spread his legs.
�
HISS, TWHACK, the riding whip cut deeply into Jimmy&#8217;s bum. He screamed and howled, and tenderly touched the deep, raw welt. The girls laughed and remarked on the prominence of the welt as compared to the earlier the one inflicted through the cloth.
�
�Send luncheon to my room in ten minutes and make sure it is properly prepared,� Victoria yelled at Gwyneth, the temporary cook when the two girls entered the mansion. They smiled at each other as they climbed the stairs, knowing that ten minutes was far too short to prepare much food and they could have some sport with whoever brought it. So it proved.
�
Fifteen minutes later she vigorously rang the service bell and shortly after Mary, the newly appointed young maid appeared with a tray of sliced meats and bread. �What took you so long girl? And why is the food laid out in such a disgusting way? And where&#8217;s the wine?�
�
�I&#8217;m sorry Miss, that&#8217;s how cook told me to do it and I&#8217;ve to go back for the wine Miss.�
�
�Why didn&#8217;t one of the others bring it with you?�
�
�I don&#8217;t know Miss. No one else is around. I&#8217;m sorry Miss, I&#8217;ll try and do better next time.�
�
�You most certainly will after you&#8217;ve had a session on the whipping bench. There are always servants on hand so that story is a pack of lies. I daresay the others are off somewhere and you are trying to protect them. We&#8217;ll find out later. Go fetch the wine and tell Danvers to prepare the bench in half an hour and to have you stripped and fastened down. We&#8217;ll be down to witness your chastisement later.� She planned to leave the poor girl tied naked to the bench for at least an hour before the birching began.
�
�
Paul Danvers wouldn&#8217;t birch anyone working at the establishment in future for at that moment he lay naked and tied hand and foot to a post in the barn. Earlier Lord Henry Meershant secretly entered his home and ordered the head footman to gather his staff and to overpower the butler and get him into the barn without his daughter knowing. By then most of the men of the outside staff, following the instructions he had given Tom, had assembled and they made short work of stripping the man they all disliked and securing him tightly to the post.
�
Mary entered. �The girls have finished eating Sir, and I&#8217;ve been ordered to the whipping bench because the meal presentation was &#8216;totally unsatisfactory and barely edible&#8217; and for lying when I said there was no one else to bring the wine to them. They locked the door to their room when I left after I&#8217;d taken the wine in and returned with different wine glasses, so they might be on the bed and doing things, Sir. They said they were going to rest Sir and would be down to see my birching in an hour.�
�
�Are all the room keys in the kitchen?� On learning they were, he sent cook and six men into the house. �Unlock the door Cook and let the men in. Don&#8217;t knock or warn the girls. Men, go straight in and bring them down here in whatever state of dress they&#8217;re in. Use such force as is necessary to bring them here and ignore all their protests and threats and don&#8217;t mention that I&#8217;m here. Let that come as a shock to them.� Turning to Lady Caroline Devereux he went on, �Those two ladies are going to receive the comeuppance they deserve. I sent word to Sir Robert Carter-Symes and his wife Elizabeth concerning their daughter Juliette and they&#8217;ve just arrived. Like me, I expect they&#8217;ll be disgusted and infuriated with the behaviour of the two girls. Had it not been for your generosity and thoughtfulness in sending the courier to me, their reign of terror would still be going on and I&#8217;d have returned to a very depleted household.�
�
Yells and screams heralded the arrival of the girls, carried ignominiously over the shoulders of two gardeners. Seeing his Lordship and the assembled staff in barn, both girls quickly realised they were in serious trouble. �What is the meaning of this father? Tell these oafs to set us free and punish them,� Victoria demanded.
�
�My father will demand an explanation Sir and redress for the indignity you have caused me,� Juliette added but her words only brought a smile to his lordship and to her father standing in the shadows. 
�
�Your mother and I are already here Juliette and we&#8217;ll hear your explanation after we hear from the maids and the men you&#8217;ve watched being punished. We are given to understand that you actively encouraged Victoria and Danvers to brutally thrash them for trivial offenses,� Sir Robert Carter-Symes answered.
�
�They&#8217;re only servants,� Juliette retorted and then realised the remark in front of all the assembled staff, was less than tactful and only fuelled his Lordship&#8217;s anger. 
�
�They are loyal members of my staff who normally need little correction. They are not animals with thick hides and no feelings.� Turning to the men who still held the girls he ordered, �Strip off what little clothing they have, tie them to a post and wrap a cloth around their mouths until we ask them to speak,� instructed Lord Henry, �Tis fortunate they are wearing so little.� He couldn&#8217;t keep the anger from his voice as he went on, �In my absence of a little more than a month, you have caused the birching of three girls, and one of the gardening staff over whom you should not have any control and had to resort to trickery to do so. Only an hour or so ago you personally whipped the stable boy purely for your amusement, but I will get them to tell their stories and show us the injuries you caused to be inflicted.� He paused and stared in anger at his daughter and her friend before going on, �Betty, I gather you were the first to receive a birching and I know you&#8217;ve already told me the story but I would like for all here to hear it and to witness the state of your buttocks after they&#8217;ve healed for nearly a month.�
�
Shyly Betty went to the front of the gathering. �Sir, you had not been gone a week when Miss Victoria summoned me to her room on her return from riding. Miss Juliette sat with her and both had twigs and cleavers in their hair as though they&#8217;d been lying in a mown meadow. Miss Victoria ordered me to comb them out and accused me of deliberately hurting her by pulling her hair but everything being entangled made it difficult to remove them. Miss Juliette did the same Sir when I had to do hers and both then said I had caused them physical harm and they would have me punished. They didn&#8217;t listen to my pleas and sent for Danvers. I expected to get a few strokes of the strap even though it wasn&#8217;t my fault but I knew to expect worse when, on Miss Victoria&#8217;s instructions, he stripped me and fastened me to the whipping bench. They left me there naked until all the inside staff were assembled so they can all bear witness to the truth of what happened. I nearly fainted when Miss Victoria ordered, �Two dozen with the birch Danvers, and lay them on good and hard. We need to teach this useless girl that she cannot harm her betters and get away with it.� Danvers laid the birch on terrible hard Sir and the two Misses kept urging him to hit harder still. I did faint away a little afore the end but my ordeal wasn&#8217;t over. Miss Juliette must have noticed the bulge in Danvers&#8217;s breeches because she said for him to relieve himself in me. In front of all the others, Danvers fuck� rogered me. Mrs. Coley and Miss French treated me as best they could but I could do little for nigh on a week. When, later on, they decided to leave and Carol had a birching, I decided to leave too and fortunately Lady Devereux took us in temporarily.�
�
With a little prompting, Betty lifted her skirt and to everyone&#8217;s horror, showed the welts and bruises that still decorated her arse. Lord Henry asked her to show the now tearful girls but didn&#8217;t remove the gags for their comments. �Would you say Betty&#8217;s account of what happened is accurate Mrs. Coley?�
�
�We cannot say what happened in the bedroom Sir, but Betty has always been a caring and careful girl and I doubt she would harm a soul, but her account of the birching is mild compared to what happened. Her buttocks were torn and bleeding and as you saw, will take a long time to heal properly. She couldn&#8217;t stand for several days and could only hobble for a week or more.�
�
Lord Henry expressed his sorrow at the way she suffered and promised to do all he could to make amends. �Carol, I believe you were birched next.�
�
�Yes Sir, and I still believe Miss Juliette did it deliberately. I served dinner that evening and went to pour red wine into her glass when she lifted the glass and knocked the decanter from my hand and the wine spilled over her dress. The called me a lot of names and ordered Danvers to put me on the bench. I protested and struggled but in the end he overpowered me even when the footmen refused to help. My birching followed a similar pattern to Betty&#8217;s and he raped me afterwards as well. Again, Cook and the housekeeper treated me for a few days and then they decided that life at the manor wasn&#8217;t worth staying and left and Betty went with them. I&#8217;d nowhere to go and prayed I&#8217;d not get into any more trouble. I did enquire about other positions Sir, but none were available and I wasn&#8217;t in a fit state to work properly. I still find it difficult to walk or bend down but Miss Gwyneth gives me light work.� She showed her raw buttocks to everyone and provoked outbursts of disgust.
�
Peggy&#8217;s story followed the same lines. She&#8217;d accidentally bumped into Victoria in one of the corridors and been accused of deliberately trying to knock her over. Shaking with fear, the young girl fell to the ground and passed out and only came round when she&#8217;d been fastened to the bench. The fact that she passed out after the first stroke of the birch and several times afterwards, annoyed Danvers and he raped her hard in both holes before leaving her into the care of Carol and another maid. With only a little over a week to heal, Peggy&#8217;s buttocks were still in a terrible mess and his Lordship had to use his authority to prevent the men harming his daughter and her friend. Both girls were now extremely frightened and sobbed as though regretting what they had done but most onlookers thought they were only crocodile tears.
�
�Thomas, your story I believe, differs slightly from the others but you still ended up being severely whipped.�
�
�Yes Sir. During the day when we outside men need to pee, we go discretely behind a bush. I&#8217;d just started and was in good flow when Miss Victoria and her friend appeared. I think they waited for me to go there and I didn&#8217;t notice them until they started yelling at me for being indecent and for displaying my pego in front of them. They asked father in his position as head gardener to whip me, but he refused. Miss Victoria threatened to sack him but he pointed out they didn&#8217;t have the authority to do that.
�
Some days later a scullery maid brought a note asking for a fresh supply of carrots and beans to be taken to the cellar. The note surprised me as usually one of the kitchen maids comes to the garden, rings the bell and tells me what they require but I assumed the scullery maid to be a bit slow and wouldn&#8217;t remember the instructions. It&#8217;s not often I take them to the cellar and only do so if the load is heavy but I didn&#8217;t suspect anything to be wrong until something hit the back of my head and knocked me down. Before I recovered, Danvers tied my hands and feet and dragged me to the cellar and fastened me over a barrel. Had I seen him before he hit me, I doubt if he would have got away lightly but I didn&#8217;t and once my hands were tied, I was helpless to resist. He gagged me to prevent my alerting the other staff while he went and fetched the two ladies. 
�
�Give him two dozen Danvers,� Miss Victoria ordered.
�
�Make it three dozen as he&#8217;s a man and can take more,� Miss Juliette upped the number. In the end, that&#8217;s what he gave me and spoilt two birches in doing so. Like the maid, he raped me afterwards and the two ladies kept insisting that he fucked me harder and pull completely out every so often in order to cause me the maximum amount of pain. Danvers untied my wrists when he finished but not my ankles and the three of them left. Gradually I found the strength to release myself and make my way back to the garden. Father and the men were furious and almost stormed the building but old Jethro counselled caution as said to wait until he emerged from the house and into our territory where we could deal with him without witnesses. He must have known because he never came out of the house. With mother&#8217;s help I&#8217;m beginning to heal and today I went back to work for the first time but I cannot bend easily and can only do light work. My arse is a mess and I daren&#8217;t sit on it.�
�
By the end of Tom&#8217;s tale, the staff were almost in a lynching mood but fortunately the master kept control of the situation and asked Jimmy to give his account of the whipping this morning. Although not as severe as the others, it added weight to the demands that the girls and Danvers be severely punished.
�
Lord Henry held up his hand for silence. �I&#8217;ve known the outline of what happened since I arrived back from France last night so I&#8217;ve had a little time to consider what to do with my daughter and Danvers. Juliette Carter-Symes is her father&#8217;s responsibility and he will deal with her in his own way. Danvers is a relatively easy decision. A flogging like he&#8217;s given to others and dismissal without references. I&#8217;ll also have a word with the local constable to see that Danvers leaves the parish. That my daughter should abuse her authority to cause so much hardship and pain just for the pleasure of seeing the girls and boys cry out, causes me much grief and anger. I felt that a simple thrashing would not make amends for her gross misdeeds. The whippings she ordered were so severe, they will bear the marks for a long while, if not for the rest of their lives but would giving Victoria a similar punishment make amends or have a lasting effect. I thought, no. That she deserves a good hiding so she can feel some of the pain she&#8217;s inflicted on others, is not in doubt but I have also decided to demote her to servant status. After her punishment she will be taken to the kitchen and the staff quarters and you will treat her as another servant, another maid. Make her work as soon as she is able and give her the menial tasks you normally give a newly indentured servant. Although I have no doubt that many of you will wish to do so, she will not be raped afterwards.� 
�
He turned to Victoria who shook her head vigorously from side to side, �You will receive a dozen strokes of the birch from each of the unfortunate ladies you had beaten, thereafter you will be treated by the kitchen staff and you will take up whatever duties they give you. You will of course be free to leave and seek employment elsewhere like any other servant. Your erstwhile possessions are forfeit and your room is completely out of bounds. The staff will find you suitable clothes and a place to sleep for as long as you remain here.� 
�
When the murmurs of approval died down, he turned to Sir Robert Carter-Symes and his wife Elizabeth sitting alongside him. �Sir Robert, do you have in mind to punish your daughter and if so, by what means Sir?�
�
�My Lord, I feel my daughter is as culpable as yours and like her, ought to feel some of the pain she caused, however, instead of the birch, I would ask the boy (Jimmy was it?) to use the whip she was so keen to have used on him. She should be strung up for two-dozen strokes across the back and buttocks. I would ask that he try not to cut her too badly but the welts should be clear and strong like the one across his arse, for I too am angered and disgusted by our daughter&#8217;s behaviour especially as it seems the object was to give them a sexual boost for their activities afterwards.�
�
�May I add to that dear?� his wife broke in and on receiving his assent, continued, �Victoria has to serve as a servant after her punishment. We had high hopes of wedding Juliette into a good position but when this gets known and her womanly activities become common knowledge, as I&#8217;m sure they will now that all here know, her chances of a worthwhile match will be dimmed. We also learned from their dress when brought in and from Mary&#8217;s comment, that the girls were misbehaving themselves with each other at the thought of watching another girl being punished. I would suggest that after her whipping, Juliette be given to the boy to assist in his work and to train for her wifely duties. I&#8217;m sure it would cost us far less to pay her wages here than to keep her at home. Does the boy have his own room or live in a dormitory Milord?�
�
�If he doesn&#8217;t it can be arranged and I&#8217;m sure Jimmy will only be too glad to keep her under control.� Juliette tried to protest but the gag nullified her efforts.
�
�The afternoon is rapidly passing and I would like the staff to return to their duties so we&#8217;ll get on with the punishments. Danvers first. Secure him on the bench and when he is ready, remove his gag and perhaps Thomas, you would like to return the injustice he gave to you?�
�
�M&#8217;lord, with the difficulty I have moving my body, I doubt I would do justice to the task, could I ask that my father be appointed in my place?�
�
�Certainly, that&#8217;s a wise decision, step forward Bert Ward and do your duty as I&#8217;m sure you will.�
�
Bert laid the strokes fast and furiously using all the power of his tall, broad-shouldered body. Starting at the back of Danvers thighs he worked the birches along the man&#8217;s body to his shoulders and then concentrated the last dozen on his arse. Danvers cries were at first loud and protesting but towards the end, they became hoarse and pitiful and his flesh became ever more welted and bloody. Finally Bert tossed the second broken birch aside and said to the Lord, �Thank you Sir, for allowing me the privilege of revenging my son&#8217;s and the maids past treatment at the hands of this scoundrel. I only wish he were here a little longer so I could treat his front in a similar fashion.� 
�
�Enough is enough Bert. Have him taken outside and laid on the grass until we&#8217;ve finished with the others, then perhaps Mrs. Coley will apply some unguent and with the men, can check he takes nothing that belongs to the house when he leaves. Jones can take him in the cart to the crossroads and see him on his way.� With much yelling and cursing, Danvers managed to get to his feet and, half supported by men on either side, made his way outside.
�
�Juliette, it is your turn next and your father decreed you are to be punished by Jimmy our stable boy, who you know well but have treated badly. Twenty lashes with your own whip and then you&#8217;ll be turned over into his care for an indefinite period and he will keep you as though you are his wife. That we hope will end your woman to woman relationship with Victoria.� Lord Henry turned and asked Mary to run and get the whip while they set a rope over the rafters ready for Juliette. 
�
Soon all was ready and Juliette stood naked, her arms high above her head and her feet flat on the ground. All saw the attractive young girl but none more so than Jimmy, who stood close with the whip now in his hand, and admired her firm round breasts, her full arse and the dark mound that matched her hair but hid her cunnie. He still couldn&#8217;t believe this beauty, only two years older than he, had been given to him as his woman, a woman he could use for his pleasure. First though he had to punish her and that put him in a dilemma; he wanted his revenge but didn&#8217;t want to hurt her so badly she would be useless to him for weeks. His Lordship interrupted his thoughts.
�
�Are you ready Jimmy?�
�
�Aye Sir.�
�
�Remove her gag and begin. Remember the welt you had this morning and try to give her something similar.�
�
As soon as the gag freed her mouth, Juliette begged, pleaded and promised but Lord Henry and her father ignored them and nodded to Jimmy to start. The first welt cut low into her buttocks and Juliette cursed him enough to raise his temper and lay the following strokes on much harder until she screamed in agony as the welts criss-crossed their way up her back. Intending to carry her outside, Jimmy lifted the girl on his shoulders and started out but a command from the master stopped him. �I know you wish to take care of your new possession Jimmy but wait a while for I wish her to see her companion&#8217;s punishment and then I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;ll realise that you treated her with a great deal of reserve.� He spoke to the men who&#8217;d brought Victoria to the barn, �Release her from the post and fasten her to the whipping bench. Betty, you will take the first turn to start the decoration her bottom. Lay them on as hard as you will for I shall not stop you. I no longer regard this wicked girl as a daughter of mine and will not have her in my presence as such at least for a very long time and until I see genuine remorse and a suitable improvement in her behaviour, that is if she stays and performs her work as a servant.� All could hear the anger in his voice.
�
Betty barely shook the brine from the birch before bringing down with all the force she could muster on the unfortunate Victoria&#8217;s arse. Even that first stroke brought forth dribbles of blood where the tips and buds on the rods bit deeply into her tender flesh. Again and again, Betty thrashed the rods down eliciting horrific screams but few cared. They&#8217;d seen the way she&#8217;d treated others and believed she deserved it. By the time she&#8217;d finished her allocation, Victoria&#8217;s arse bled profusely and looked a vividly bruised mess. A pail of water washed some of it away only to reveal more of the deep welts.
�
Carol stood on the other side of the bench and spread her strokes over a wider area but her victim didn&#8217;t stay conscious the whole of the time. They revived her at the end and most thought the lord would curtail her punishment at that point and he must have considered it, but instead he called for a five minute break to allow the wounds to be cleaned a little, although with the blood flowing freely, the task proved difficult. 
�
Peggy, still in pain herself, laid her quota on with only moderate force but even so, Victoria passed out long before the end.
�
�Mrs. Coley and Miss French, I trust you will treat her as you would any other servant that has been severely punished, indeed as you did to those she abused. Allow her to rest for a day and then start her on such duties as she can do. Send Mary to her room to find suitable work clothes for her and then I will have the room locked for three months after which the clothes can be given away unless by then she has returned to grace or she is taken by some man as his wife and she then needs the garments. Remember she is now one of your staff and as such is free to leave should she wish to do so. You will pay her the same wage as the others and any money she has in her old room I will put into safe keeping. The clothing Mary and whoever you deem honest enough to help her, finds necessary for a servants work, are all she owns until she earns enough to buy more.�
�
Three days later, Victoria sat crying in a corner. The staff had given her tasks she&#8217;d have found difficult to perform had she been fit, but almost unable to walk, she found them impossible. No one helped her but ordered her to do better and berated her when she couldn&#8217;t, frequently suggesting that if she couldn&#8217;t do the work, she should leave. They wanted the hated bitch to leave and did all they could to promote it. That night she decided leaving would be the best option and if she died on the way to town, so be it. She&#8217;d have peace and a respite from the pain and torture of living.
�
Juliette&#8217;s life with Jimmy proved a little better even if his motives were selfish. He cared for her in order for her to satisfy his lust and fucked her regularly disregarding the pain he caused in doing so. During the first evening, he moved his meagre belongings from the bunk house into a new room and after washing her welts and cleaning her tearstained face, went to the cook and persuaded her to give him the salve she made and a little of the &#8216;blue bottle medicine&#8217; that would ease the pain. Having put the salve on and allowed a little time to elapse for the medicine to take effect, he ordered his charge to bend of the side of the bed. �Open your legs more Julie for you know what I intend doing and this should be the least painful way for you, not that it really matters except that I may enjoy it more if you are not yelling and screaming all the time.�
�
�Please don&#8217;t, I&#8217;m not really your wife an I don&#8217;t want to be your whore either. Leave me be, I&#8217;m still in too much pain�� A gentle smack caused her abrupt ending and she yelled again when Jimmy&#8217;s prick entered her cunnie and he began fucking his new &#8216;wife&#8217; with some vigour. Fortunately for her, he didn&#8217;t last long. He fucked her again before going to bed and again first thing in the morning before he headed off to the stables. She&#8217;d need clothing before she could work with him but one of the maids solved that problem by bringing the riding clothes, left in Victoria&#8217;s room. Not the most suitable attire for a stable hand but it would do until he could get something better.
�
�
Tom paused in his clipping of the box hedge and watched the girl hobble one or two steps at a time towards the woodland path that led to the small town five miles away. Since the day in the barn, he&#8217;d thought a great deal about her and his thoughts were pulled both ways; that the punishment was necessary to prevent her becoming ever more tyrannical and conversely that he hated to see a woman hurt so badly. He knew from the maids that came for flowers or vegetables, they hadn&#8217;t looked after her properly since then. �She&#8217;s never going to make it into town in that state and this late in the afternoon,� he thought but from the way she averted her eyes, he knew she didn&#8217;t want anything to do with him. She stumbled and almost fell. �I&#8217;ll get her a stick, at least that will help her walking.� 
�
When Tom approached carrying a long bean pole, Victoria screamed thinking she would get another beating but he spoke calmly, �Here, take this, it will help you to walk. The track gets rougher later and I think it might rain before long by the look of the clouds so you may wish to shelter in the sheep hut.� Victoria turned her face away from him and didn&#8217;t reply but gripped the staff and leaned on it with out moving for a few minutes. Tom wondered if she would even make it as far as the hut but when she refused to even acknowledge him, he went back to his work. With his mother&#8217;s tender care, his arse had healed enough for him to walk reasonably well but not to do heavy work; she could hardly put one foot in front of the other.
�
An hour later the rain came, first as drizzle and then a downpour when it neared packing up time, he called it a day and headed home but much as he wanted to, Tom couldn&#8217;t get the girl off his mind and turned down the woodland path. She&#8217;d only gone a few hundred yards and lay almost motionless and soaked through in the wet grass. �I can&#8217;t leave her here to die, as she surely will if she doesn&#8217;t get some warmth and attention to her welts,� he thought. �Can you stand?� he asked. Her eyes barely fluttered. �Very well Miss Victoria, I&#8217;m taking you home. I&#8217;m not going to hurt you, at least I will try not to but I will have to carry you over my shoulders. First I need you on your feet.�
�
�What on earth have you been up to Thomas? Who is she? What&#8217;s happened to her?� Violet Ward asked a series of questions without waiting for an answer.
�
�It Miss Victoria only we don&#8217;t have to call her Miss now that she&#8217;s a servant,� Tom&#8217;s father answered for him, �Where&#8217;d you find her? I heard one of the maids say she&#8217;d left the house. Have you taken leave of your senses to bring her here? The master will be mad if he finds out.�
�
�I wasn&#8217;t about to leave her to die and she needs treating and warmth. Mother, please give me a hand to get these sodden clothes off her and then perhaps you&#8217;ll see to her like you did me.�
�
�Take me back, let me die in peace�� For the first time Victoria spoke, her voice strained and very weak.
�
�No!� Tom and his mother said together and set about removing her clothing and examining the festering welts. Put her on your bed Thomas for that&#8217;s where she&#8217;ll have to lie, there is nowhere else in this small place. Get a bowl of warm water and put a little carbolic in it while I make a draught of the morphine to ease the pain and make her sleep.�
�
Presently, while the family ate and Victoria lay peacefully in a drugged sleep, they discussed what to do with the girl. Bert understandably worried over his Lordship&#8217;s reaction but had to agree with his son that he could not leave the girl to die. �We&#8217;ll have to keep her out of sight until she&#8217;s well enough to go on,� he stated. He had no desire to keep the girl on his property.
�
�Maybe we should keep her and let her work for us. It will just be a change of position for her and she&#8217;ll still be a servant if we take her on as one of the gardeners. She can be my apprentice,� Tom stated.
�
�We don&#8217;t have girls or women in the gardens, you know that well enough.�
�
�Only by tradition. There no rules as far as I know and I would keep an eye on her.�
�
�She won&#8217;t be fit enough to go anywhere for a while,� Violet chimed in, �And I&#8217;ll have another mouth to feed without any more money coming in. I doubt if she&#8217;ll be of much help around the house even when she&#8217;s better. Probably best if we make her well enough to get into town and find herself a position somewhere else.�
�
Bert still wasn&#8217;t convinced on the wisdom of having the girl at all, but agreed to keep the girl until well enough to move on and to make a decision then. �You&#8217;ll have to look after her Tom, you&#8217;ll need to be the one to keep her under control because you know what she&#8217;s like. Even though you&#8217;ll sleep in the same bed, you&#8217;d best keep your prick out of her too because the master didn&#8217;t want her raped and we don&#8217;t need further trouble. She&#8217;s going to be your responsibility Tom, so you best be prepared to show her you are in charge of her, not the other way round.�
�
�She certainly won&#8217;t be the one in charge of my kitchen,� Violet added with fervour, �Now Son, I&#8217;d better check you didn&#8217;t damage your welts carrying her home.� Tom had indeed opened up several of his wounds but not too seriously.
�
YEOWWW! �Shush Vicky, you&#8217;ll wake the whole house, you&#8217;re safe, you&#8217;re warm and you won&#8217;t be harmed.�
�
�Where am I? Am I dead?�
�
�No, you&#8217;re not dead.� Tom grinned at the thought. �You&#8217;re staying with us, the Wards, for the time being and we gave you something to ease the pain and cleaned your wounds because they were festering and making the pain worse. It should ease for a while yet. Try and get to sleep again until it gets light. You&#8217;re safe and won&#8217;t be harmed,� he repeated. Victoria wasn&#8217;t so sure but for the first time for days, she felt relatively free of pain and snuggled in the warmth of a bed with a thick feather mattress.
�
The low slanting rays of the early morning sun shone through the window when they next woke and Tom winced when he tried to get out of bed. As usual the welts stiffened overnight and carrying Vicky had set the healing back a few days. Vicky watched fearfully as Tom eased himself up and she saw the welts and bruises on his arse and then his erect prick. He pissed in the chamber pot but didn&#8217;t bother to put on his trousers. �You&#8217;d better get up now too Vicky��
�
�Victoria!�
�
Tom put his fingers across her mouth, �No, while you are here and part of this family, you are Vicky. We left Victoria to die in the woods. Here Vicky gets fed and her arse treated but in return she has to learn to live with us and under our rules. Nothing difficult, but you&#8217;ll be expected to work and help mother until you are either fit enough to leave or able to help me in the garden. Now get up, I know it will hurt, I always do when I start to move but it gets better as the day goes on. Have a piss and then we&#8217;ll go into the kitchen, Mum will have made the porridge and we can eat breakfast. You&#8217;ll need food to build up your strength and help you recover. Dad goes to work soon after and Mum usually treats my welts and she will do yours too now. I go to work then and you can help mother in whatever way you can.�
�
�I&#8217;m still in too much pain now that I&#8217;m up and its all come back.� She shed a few tears but Tom knew exactly what the pain felt like and guessed she tried to exaggerate to save her from working. 
�
�Vicky, don&#8217;t try it on with mother or me. She won&#8217;t expect you to do anything difficult but you will have to help her and in doing so you will be helping yourself, although you won&#8217;t know it yet. Use the po and come into the kitchen. Don&#8217;t worry about having no clothes, we&#8217;ve seen everything you have.�
�
�You&#8217;ll find it easier to turn the chair backwards and kneel on the seat and rest much of your weight on the chair back like Thomas is doing,� Violet suggested. That they had thought of it and told her brought tears to her eyes. In the house they&#8217;d forced her to sit on a wooden bench seat.
�
They ate in an uneasy silence until Bert left and Violet ordered her son to lie on the bed. �Come here and watch Vicky, because this will be one of your jobs in future. To keep the skin as supple as possible we need to rub this clear white oil in but it must be done gently to avoid knocking off the scabs until they&#8217;re ready to fall off. In a day or two, he&#8217;ll do yours but at the moment, we need to keep the open wounds clean and get rid of the puss that&#8217;s formed. We don&#8217;t want the poison spreading as it surely would if we hadn&#8217;t treated you last night. Hold your hand out so I can pour a little oil on and then you can smooth it into his skin.� For a moment she thought to refuse but quickly realised it wouldn&#8217;t hurt and could get her thrown out. 
�
�Tom&#8217;s skin, where it isn&#8217;t welted feels much like Juliette&#8217;s� she thought and then remembered Juliette&#8217;s whipping. �I wonder if my bottom with go all scabby like this, or maybe worse?� but by then she&#8217;d been ordered to change places with Tom and after closely examining her, decided they&#8217;d have to wash her again with the carbolic water and without the morphine it would sting. Violet explained this to her but insisted on the necessity of doing it and said too much of he morphine wasn&#8217;t good for her and in any case it was expensive.
�
When Tom left for work, Violet kept Vicky busy first washing the dress she&#8217;d soiled lying in the mud and then with other chores, necessary or otherwise. At one point, Vicky rebelled and told Violet that she just couldn&#8217;t do any more.
�
�Then there&#8217;s the door, there&#8217;s your wet dress, put it on and go. I know what you can and cannot do and I&#8217;ve probably given you far less difficult tasks than you had in the house. Yes, some things cause you a little pain but that is necessary in order to keep the muscles working and will help the healing. After what you caused to be done to my son, it is of considerable wonder to me that I even allowed you into our home. Indeed, I almost had Tom throw you out into the wet again but I felt you were a person, a human being that needed my help and I was probably the only one around that could give it, and so I did, even if it incurs Lord Henry&#8217;s wrath. We&#8217;re taking a considerable risk having you here so either you cooperate with us or carry on to whatever fate is in store for you.� Vicky bowed her head but said nothing. She felt she ought to apologise but apologies didn&#8217;t come easily to her.
�
�Tom&#8217;s been told not to rape you and we know you&#8217;re not in any condition to have a man inside you for a few days, not like that Julie. We hear that Jimmy has his way with her several times a day and spanks her if she doesn&#8217;t perform but her skin isn&#8217;t broken like yours and her father and mother gave him permission to treat her like a wife. Like last night, Tom will sleep with you and you will no doubt feel his manhood against your body, and I&#8217;m sure when he feels you are ready, he will make a woman of you. Again, if you do not wish that to happen, leave and make your own way in life for we can do without all the trouble you could cause. Now, enough of this idle chatter, we&#8217;ve potatoes to peel.�
�
�
Jimmy stopped work and rushed outside when he heard the fast approaching hoof beats and his spirits sank when he saw the rider. Had Sir Robert Carter-Symes come to take his daughter home? �She&#8217;s beginning to respond and I&#8217;ve only spanked her twice and a week is nowhere near long enough to train any one, especially a girl who doesn&#8217;t want to be trained,� he thought.
�
�Good day to you Sir,� he greeted the man as he deftly caught the mare&#8217;s reins while the ex cavalry officer leapt from the saddle.
�
�Good day Jimmy, is not your apprentice around?�
�
�She cleaning the number three stable at the moment Sir.�
�
�Can she cope with rubbing down my mare while I have a few words with you and then I need to see Lord Henry.�
�
�I&#8217;ll have to take the saddle off because lifting still causes her a lot of pain, otherwise she is very good with the horses but then she&#8217;s been used to them since childhood.�
�
Juliette, hearing her father&#8217;s voice, rushed out and fervently begged him to take her home. �Maybe we&#8217;ll consider it when you&#8217;ve finished your apprenticeship, both as a stable boy and a wife,� her father smiled, �Now take Karmoon out of the wind and give her a good rub down. I&#8217;m assured that you can do that.�
�
Tears flowing at the rebuff, Julie led the mare around the side of the stables out of earshot of the men. She knew they would discus her. �How is she doing then Jimmy?� 
�
�She does what she has to do but without much enthusiasm and only because of the threat of another spanking like I&#8217;ve given her twice so far. I didn&#8217;t do it hard as she is still suffering the effects of the whip but it caused her to cry out and she&#8217;s worked better since. I bed her most nights and mornings and the last couple of times, she began to respond but stopped when she caught herself doing so.�
�
�What about the stable work?�
�
�We have a problem there in that she doesn&#8217;t have suitable clothing. All she has is the riding gear she had on when she came to the manor Sir, and it will be weeks before she earns enough to be able to buy any. The housemaids don&#8217;t have anything suitable and are reluctant to help her anyway.�
�
�I presume you go to Browne&#8217;s in town for your clothing?� and when Jimmy nodded, he went on, �I&#8217;ll make arrangements for them to outfit her. Buy good quality stuff so that it will last.�
�
�
�Good Morning Henry, nice to see you in less unpleasant circumstances.�
�
�Good morning Robert, and you too. To what do I owe the pleasure of your company? Not that you aren&#8217;t welcome at any time.�
�
�I&#8217;m more my wife&#8217;s messenger this time but I wanted to see how Juliette fared. Seems the boy is keeping her under control and she&#8217;s behaving herself, if not willingly. How&#8217;s Victoria coming along?�
�
�That&#8217;s a great worry to me. Seems she decided to leave the house and headed for town but no one has seen her since. I sent word to the local constable to keep his eyes open for her, but so far there&#8217;s been no sightings. I don&#8217;t want to send a search party out because she may well have gotten a ride on a cart in a different direction but apparently she wasn&#8217;t walking very well when she left. Perhaps you might keep your eyes and ears open too and discretely let me know of her whereabouts. I worry that some ruffians may have found her and she&#8217;ll end up in some den of iniquity. But what did Elizabeth want of me?�
�
�She asks for you and Lady Caroline to attend a soiree at the manor house at the weekend. Can I say you will try to attend?�
�
�Of course my friend, if I can get Caroline to agree.� They spent an hour discussing estate matters until Sir Robert took his leave, promising to let his friend know if he heard of any sightings of Victoria.
�
Jimmy, on the instructions sent by the boot boy, had Karmoon saddled and ready and Julie held the reins and kept the horse calm. Once again she pleaded for her father to take her back but received the same reply as earlier. �I&#8217;ve told Jimmy to take you to Browne&#8217;s to get work clothes and to buy good quality stuff that will last. He&#8217;ll take you in the next day or two and then you&#8217;ll fit in fine as his apprentice.� Julie wept fresh tears, knowing that if he paid for clothing that would last a long while, she would be wearing them for that time.
�
�
�What is the meaning of this Thomas?� Lord Henry enquired loudly.
�
For the first time in over a week, Vicky ventured outside the hut and tentatively clipped the hedge alongside Tom. They knew they wouldn&#8217;t be able to keep her presence in his home secret for much longer and decided to start her working at her new and, as yet unpaid, job. Obviously word quickly reached the master and he&#8217;d immediately walked into the garden to see for himself. By now Vicky&#8217;s body had healed sufficiently for her to do light work and, although very afraid at the reception she might receive from other workers and staff, she reluctantly agreed to go with Tom, indeed his mother almost insisted on it.
�
For the past week she&#8217;d treated the girl kindly but without any great liking for her. She remembered all too well the pain and suffering Vicky caused her son and it would take a long while before she would forgive her. On the other hand, Tom had developed an affection for the girl, probably deepened by the way they lay naked in bed at night and by their mutual massaging of oils into their welts. At first Vicky resisted when, under the blankets and in the dark, Tom&#8217;s hands roamed over her breasts and between her legs and she felt his hard prick tight against her thighs but for the last two nights she&#8217;d even opened herself to him like she&#8217;d done with Juliette but so far, they hadn&#8217;t fucked.
�
In the early hours of the morning she lay awake trying to decide what to do. The previous afternoon, Violet quietly told her to either continue on her journey or start working on the land with Tom, if his Lordship allowed it. Vicky thought back to her previous life but knew that would never return and she reviled herself for the suffering she&#8217;d caused. Her own pain brought home to her, just how much suffering she&#8217;d inflicted on innocent people for her brief pleasure. Twice she&#8217;d woken at night crying out as she relived the terrible thrashing the maids had given her, only to find herself wrapped in Tom&#8217;s arms and his voice soothing her. She wondered at his motives especially after the way she&#8217;d treated him. �Does he really like me or does he just want to fuck me as soon as I&#8217;m healed enough? Or does he want me as a wife? A real one or a temporary one like they say Juliette is now to that stable boy? Tom heard that Jimmy fucks her several times a day. Should I allow Tom to do that? Maybe I should leave and walk into town and see what fate awaits me there. What would life be like if I have to try and find work or sell my body for money? Would anyone want it now that it is so badly scarred? Life could be far worse than with Tom and while I&#8217;m here, father might see me and relent. I&#8217;d better stay even if I do have to take that big prick of Tom&#8217;s. Maybe that won&#8217;t be so bad; Juliette used candles almost as large and it is not as though I have my maidenhead even if I haven&#8217;t had a real man&#8217;s prick inside me.�
�
She stood slightly behind Tom as he greeted her father with the usual doffing of his cap and �Good morning Sir.�
�
�What&#8217;s that girl doing on my estate? I thought I ordered her to either work as a servant or leave.� Lord Henry&#8217;s angrily shouted although inside he felt a great relief in the knowledge that his daughter was safe and knowing the Wards, believed she would be cared for.
�
�She is still a servant Sir, albeit unpaid. We are giving her a trial to see how she takes to outside work seeing the work in the kitchen so nearly caused her death.�
�
Lord Henry looked at him quizzically but Victoria took up the story. �Father, you must have known how much the kitchen servants hate me and didn&#8217;t heed your orders to take care of me like one of them. I suffered not only the effects of the birching but from the work they forced me to do until I thought death preferable to living there and decided to leave and let my fate be in the hands of God. When I left the house, I could hardly walk and from the treatment I received my body became filled with the poisons from my infected welts. Not one of the staff bothered to clean them and they gave me the dirtiest of work. By then I resolved to seek a quiet place to die and started out but soon found I could barely walk and when the rain came I lay down in the mud and decided to just lie there until my life ended. Tom had seen me enter the woods and searched for me and carried me to his home even though it broke open his own scabs. Against his father&#8217;s wishes, Tom and his mother cleaned me and treated me with medicines they can ill afford. They&#8217;ve fed me and Violet gave me one of her old dresses, the one I&#8217;m wearing because I have nothing better. In return I&#8217;ve had to help with the house chores but they never set me impossible tasks like the kitchen staff, so when last night they gave me the option of staying or continuing on my way, I decided to stay and Bert intends to see the estate manager to put me on the gardening staff at least then I will be able to contribute to their funds. I know this dress might seem out of place here but this and the torn one I left in, is all I have. For once, perhaps you will look kindly on me also and allow me to stay until such time as you might consider me as a daughter again.�
�
Taken aback by his daughter&#8217;s outburst, Lord Henry glared for a moment and said, �Thomas, I am not pleased that she is still on the estate because it reminds me of all the evil she perpetrated on innocent young people, you included. When I heard she&#8217;d left, I had hopes she would find a position as a maid and would find out first hand, just what it was like to be a serving girl but at the time, I didn&#8217;t know how uncaring the staff in the house were towards her. I am pleased that you and your mother saved her from probable death but it will be a long while before I consider taking her back into the house and I will have to consider carefully whether or not to allow her to stay on the estate. Before I make that decision, I will talk to your mother because the pair of you will be living under her roof for the time being. I will also talk to Lady Devereux and get a woman&#8217;s opinion. Until then she may work alongside you and I will wish to see you alone in the house before dinner tonight.�
�
�Thank you Sir for considering it but I would also add that if she goes, I go too. Having saved her once, I will not let her go without some protection.�
�
�Direct me to your mother Thomas,� he ordered abruptly.
�
�Good Lord, Sir, what has happened? Has she harmed him again?� Violet asked.
�
�No indeed, Mrs. Ward, but they asked to stay on the estate and somewhat against my better judgement I&#8217;ve agreed to think about it. What is your opinion of the girl and their relationship? Thomas has threatened to leave too if I send the girl on her way.�
�
�I cannot say I like her Sir but she&#8217;s behaved well enough here and seems to appreciate the time and trouble we took to free her body of the festering poison. Her bum is swollen and the welts are scabbing nicely but the fiery redness has disappeared. Really Sir, I am not surprised that Thomas wants to be with her as she is the first girl he has been close to and, perforce, have to sleep in the same bed but I don&#8217;t believe they&#8217;ve mated yet. I have no wish at the moment for her to be his wife but for the time being, rather than lose my son, I would prefer she stayed until he finds someone more suitable and she is healed enough to work properly or find a position elsewhere. No one will employ her until her body is healed.�
�
Before he left they discussed in detail the state of his daughter when she arrived and the treatment she&#8217;d applied and the extra expense caused. Finally he took his leave of her and later rode to see his lady friend.
�
�Come in Thomas,� Lord Henry invited the boy, �I have reservations on doing this, but your mother and Lady Devereux are agreed that for the immediate future I should allow Victoria to stay in your care. You are to be fully in charge of her and responsible for her behaviour. At the moment, with the pain she is in, the task shouldn&#8217;t be difficult but when she is free of it, then she may well try to return to her old ways. You must keep a firm hand on her and chastise her when necessary. Can you do that?�
�
�Yes, Sir. Father said much the same thing the other day.�
�
�I have contacted the estate manager and told him of her employment and he will pay her the same as other apprentice gardeners even though she is a woman. That brings me to another point. A young girl amidst the men could lead to trouble especially as many have no liking for her, so she will work with you or your father at all times.�
�
�I&#8217;m sure we can arrange that Sir.�
�
�In my talk with your mother, I learned of the expense your family went through to provide medicines for you and Victoria and I also learned she has no clothing suitable for her new life. In her room, I found a considerable sum of her money that I have kept safe. I have no wish to steal from her but I shall continue to keep that money until such time as I think she can use it for a proper purpose, but for now, I will give you ten guineas to buy suitable clothing for her and five guineas for your mother as payment for the care and medicines she&#8217;s provided. The money is for her to do with as she wishes, but the ten guineas is only to be spent on necessities for Victoria to equip her for the tasks she is to perform.�
�
Elated and having more money in his pocket that ever before in his life, Tom returned home.
�
�
�Juliette, what are you doing here?� Vicky exclaimed as she entered Browne&#8217;s shop.
�
�Same as you, I expect, getting clothes for a life of drudgery. Shovelling horse shit instead of riding the beast.�
�
�I&#8217;ll be shovelling some of it too when we have to put it around the plants. How is your back healing?�
�
�Getting better if Jimmy doesn&#8217;t spank me again.�
�
�Ladies, shall we finish getting you kitted out and then go to the inn for a glass of ale and a pie. Mother gave me two shillings and that should be enough,� Tom cut in.
�
In a quiet corner they talked about their new lives and Vicky at last began to realise her life wasn&#8217;t as unpleasant as her friend&#8217;s. Jimmy proudly boasted of his prowess and how Julie took his prick at least twice on most days and in all her holes. �She&#8217;s received two spankings so far for not opening her legs when told and will get more if she doesn&#8217;t work a bit harder,� Jimmy said proudly. She thought of how Tom did it for the first time the previous night because before then her bottom was far too swollen to think about lying on my back. He&#8217;d done it carefully and even though she wasn&#8217;t really willing, she began to enjoy it before he climaxed.
�
�
Three months later.
�
�I can&#8217;t help being sick in the mornings, can I, Jimmy? It&#8217;s your damn fault that I&#8217;m pregnant with a bastard baby.�
�
�I&#8217;d marry you if you&#8217;d agree to it and then you&#8217;d really be mine.�
�
�Like hell, I&#8217;ll never agree to be tied to you for the rest of my life. As soon as I can get out of this apprenticeship nonsense, I&#8217;m off to find someone with a bit of money so I don&#8217;t have to live in a hovel with a boy who only thinks about his prick. You&#8217;re not even a good fuck, much as you think you are.�
�
�Julie, we get on okay��
�
�You may think we do and that&#8217;s only because when we disagree, I get my arse spanked, like I probably will now but at least I&#8217;m now fit enough to fight back, as you well know.�
�
A day or two later her father arrived on a visit to Lord Henry and caught her being sick. �You&#8217;ll just have to marry the boy, I presume it is Jimmy&#8217;s.�
�
�That&#8217;s something I won&#8217;t do father, not for you or his Lordship. If you force me into church I&#8217;ll scream the place down and refuse to say &#8216;I will&#8217; or sign the register.�
�
�What about you Jimmy, are you willing to wed her?�
�
�Yes Sir. I think things will settle down again when she gets over this sickness period.�
�
�Then we&#8217;ll make the arrangements.�
�
Juliette knew they would force her into marriage unless she got away. �I&#8217;ll have to do that soon, before the baby really starts to show and if I&#8217;m to get a goodly distance from here before they discover I&#8217;m missing, I&#8217;ll have to leave late at night and walk to the town and get a coach from there. I&#8217;ve a little money saved but that won&#8217;t get me far. I&#8217;ll have to tie Jimmy up so he can&#8217;t raise the alarm and I doubt anyone will worry until he doesn&#8217;t get to work in the morning. When he sits in the chair in front of the fire, I&#8217;ll loop a horse belt around him and fasten him to the chair and then tie him more securely.�
�
Juliette&#8217;s plan almost worked but she wasn&#8217;t quite quick enough in tightening the belt and she had to face a very angry Jimmy. His hand slapped her face but she fought back ferociously and in doing so took a hard punch to her stomach. Out of breath and her strength beginning to fade, and knowing she knew she&#8217;d have to get away or Jimmy would give her a heavy dose of the strap, she managed to grab a heavy pan and knock Jimmy down. Seizing the opportunity she fled into the darkness. �They&#8217;ll all be looking for me before long and he&#8217;ll string me up for another whipping. I can&#8217;t take another like the one a few months ago and I don&#8217;t want his bloody baby either so I might as well finish it all.� Running until her breath came is short gasps and feeling the pain from the punch to her belly, she hurried along the woodland bridleway she remembered from her riding days with Victoria and headed for the river bank and in the near darkness hardly saw the drop into the water. She&#8217;d never learned to swim and the swiftly flowing water carried her down stream and into a little bay. Her resolve to die faded when in the cold water but her splashing and kicking made little difference to her plight.
�
Coughing and spluttering she opened her eyes and closed them again from the bright light of the lantern. �Where am I?� the words came out between bouts of coughing and water spewing from her stomach.
�
�At the moment you are on the beach at Kelsy Bay, Juliette, but now you&#8217;re awake and I have pumped some of the water from your lungs, I&#8217;ll get you over the horse and take you to the lodge and get you dried out before you get a death of cold. Lucky for you I was night time trout fishing.� The voice sounded vaguely familiar and he knew her name but weary, wet and shivering, Juliette didn&#8217;t try to recall it.
�
�George DeVries?� she exclaimed between coughing and retching as she lay on a blanket by the fire in the lodge. Slowly she came to her senses cried out as her stomach convulsed with pain. 
�
�I&#8217;ve sent Lockheart for the doctor George,� an elderly man she recognised as Ralph DeVries entered the room followed shortly by a middle-aged woman in servant clothes.
�
�We&#8217;ll need to get those wet clothes off her Sir and please get Millie to bring towels.� Although only the housekeeper, Clara took charge of the situation and proceeded to undo the fastenings to Julie&#8217;s blouse and breeches and with help from George and Clara quickly undressed her. �Go stir up the fire in the kitchen Millie and get a big pan of water on to heat. This one&#8217;s pregnant and from the way she&#8217;s holding her belly, she may not be for much longer. You know who she is Sir?�
�
�Of course I do Clara,� George answered, �And if didn&#8217;t, those whip marks across her back would identify her.�
�
George and the two women worked on drying Juliette and rubbing life and warmth back into her body with towels and when her retching finally stopped, they added a pillow under her head. Ralph watched for a while and then left them. �Do you want to tell us what happened?� George asked by wearily and crying in pain, Juliette shook her head.
�
�I don&#8217;t know if you&#8217;ll wish to stay Sir,� Clara spoke to George, �I think she will have a miscarriage at anytime now and that could be embarrassing for you and her. I had one a few years ago and it could get messy.�
�
�I&#8217;m staying,� George affirmed.
�
By the time the doctor arrived, Juliette had aborted the foetus and the women had began cleaning the blood from her body and removing the towels. Through it all George held her hand and supported her back.
�
The doctor didn&#8217;t stay long and gave Juliette a sleeping draught. �She should recover without too many problems if you keep her warm and clean the cuts and scrapes regularly so they don&#8217;t fester.�
�
�Shall I put her in a guest room Sir?� Clara asked.
�
George&#8217;s reply surprised her, �No, put her in my bed, the room is already warm and I will help to warm her too.� 
�
By the time the effects of the sleeping draught wore off, daylight flooded the room and George stood shaving at the washstand. �Good morning Juliette, how are you feeling now?� he greeted her. 
�
Slowly she looked around and shook her head before answering, �Sore. I hurt and ache all over. Where am I?� 
�
George explained all that happened and asked how she came to be in the river. �You&#8217;d better stick with the story that you didn&#8217;t see the edge of the bank and fell into the water and say nothing about a suicide attempt. I&#8217;ve already sent word to Lord Henry to say you are here and will be staying here until you are recovered. Do you wish your father to be informed?�
�
�No! He&#8217;ll only send me back to Jimmy even though there&#8217;s no baby and I&#8217;ll get another whipping.� 
�
�Lord Henry will tell him anyway so we&#8217;d best plan how to keep you here, that is if you want to stay.�
�
�Why would you want me to stay? You know about my past and what they did to me, and my disfigured body, and the way they forced me to fuck with a stable boy and��
�
�Enough Juliette. I liked you before you met up with Victoria but then we were both too young to think about a boy / girl relationship. Maybe it won&#8217;t work out between us now, but I wouldn&#8217;t mind giving it a try for I too am being persuaded to get engaged to be married to a girl I&#8217;ve no liking for and it would serve my purpose too, to have you here and in my bed. If it doesn&#8217;t work, you&#8217;ll be free to leave and I&#8217;ll be free of Suzanna because she won&#8217;t want me after I&#8217;ve bedded you. �We&#8217;ll take precautions against you becoming pregnant again.� Juliette didn&#8217;t take long to make up her mind to stay. The DeVries might not be as wealthy as her father, but they were a well to-do family and her life would certainly be a far better one than she&#8217;d had for the past nearly four months and even if she slept in his bed, by now she was well used to fucking in all her holes and could use that to her advantage in persuading George to keep her at least until she found someone better.
�
�
Victoria led a far less dramatic life. At Violet&#8217;s insistence, after the first time, she&#8217;d had to insert a sponge each time they fucked during her fertile period. While Violet&#8217;s attitude to Vicky softened over the three months, she had grave reservations as to whether the girl had really changed or whether she just pretended in order to have somewhere to live and people to care for her, and Tom certainly did that. He treated her as though they were a genuine married couple and while they fucked most nights, he didn&#8217;t force her to do anything she strongly objected to and spent a long while kissing and cuddling and playing with her body before inserting his prick. Unlike Jimmy, he never used her bottom hole but did enjoy her mouth around his prick. She didn&#8217;t mind that and took a delight in the control she had over it. 
�
In general she enjoyed, or at least, didn&#8217;t mind her work in the gardens and they quickly found her adept at handling tiny plants. Not all the work was to her liking though. One wet and windy day they had to move the manure from behind the stables and to make matters worse, it coincided with her woman&#8217;s curse. Tom tolerated her grumbling while the fetched the first load but when she threw a tantrum at having to go back for more, he pulled her screaming from the cart, took her to a secluded place and spanked her. He didn&#8217;t do it hard but on top of the welts that remained, his hard hand hurt. �Vicky, we have a job to do and the sooner we get it done, the sooner we&#8217;ll get back and do some shed work. You may not like what we have to do, I don&#8217;t like this job either but it fell to our turn today. Now, no more nonsense and get back on the cart and lets finish this job.� Sullenly she complied and only later by the warmth of the fire did her spirits return.
�
Sometimes at night nightmares of her thrashing would plague Vicky and after Tom had comforted her, she remained awake and would take stock of her life and wondered what she would do if and when her father relented and allowed her back into his life and home. �Would I be any better off?� she asked herself, �Money-wise, yes but I&#8217;d be in a house with servants I know still despise me. The work in the gardens isn&#8217;t overly stressful and the other men have accepted me as a worker like them, even when they tease me for not being strong enough to carry the loads they do. We always get Sundays and Saturday afternoons off, unlike Juliette who has to work at any time there are visitors. My arse, yes I use peasant terms now that I&#8217;m one of them, is healing but the welts and scars remain and probably always will, which makes me doubt that any man of noble birth will take me into his life. Would I even want it now? Would I be able once again to become involved in all the petty intrigues? Would society allow me back into their circle knowing that I&#8217;ve lived and worked as a peasant? I doubt it. Maybe I will stay with Tom and marry him at some future date even if his parents disagree and we have to wait until we are twenty-one before we can do so.� Many times she looked at alternatives but nothing would give her a more fulfilling life.
�
The news that Juliette had run away and would probably be found dead much further down the river, grieved her greatly. They didn&#8217;t see each other often, mainly when the heap of horse manure at the back of the stables needed moving by horse and cart to the compost heap at the bottom of garden. At one such time Juliette confided that she&#8217;d missed her monthly bleeds and with the morning sickness upon her, confirmed her pregnancy. She knew Juliette hated Jimmy although she mostly hid the fact to avoid punishment, but didn&#8217;t expect her to run to her death. In her mind she knew her friend had deliberately tried to kill herself and when the news reached her that she had been rescued by George DeVries, her spirits rose and hoped the boy she knew from ballroom soirees, would keep her and that no one would insist on her returning to Jimmy. Little did she know that she would be involved.
�
On Sunday morning George DeVries paid them a surprise visit. �Victoria, your father and the boy Jimmy, both wish Juliette returned to the estate and are threatening to force me to comply. We wondered if you would have a word with your father and try to change his mind.�
�
�I presume Juliette told you that I have not spoken with him since he found me working in the garden and that he avoids all contact with me?�
�
He knew but wondered if the time had not come for a change in attitude and for an hour went on to explain the circumstances that led to Juliette running away and her present situation. �We are not admitting that she tried to take her own life but that she failed to see the bank before she plunged over the edge.� 
�
�He should be back from church now, perhaps it is a good time for me to go. I will do as you ask George but you have to risk that my presence will have the opposite effect to that you desire.�
�
�I will come with you Vicky to ensure you come to no harm,� Tom stated.
�
Hand in hand and ignoring the servants who tried to stop them, they walked boldly to her father&#8217;s study, knocked on the door and waited for the command to enter. Lady Devereux sat with him. �What is the meaning of this intrusion girl? I gave orders that you were not to enter this house.�
�
�Let her speak Henry,� Caroline interrupted, �She would not have come had it not been important and Thomas would not have ventured in either. Let us hear what she has to say.�
�
�I come on behalf of Juliette and George DeVries. Have you any idea how badly Jimmy treated her in the few months she&#8217;s been forced to live with him? Did you know that the doctor believes that it was his punch that caused her to abort the baby and not her being in the water? No? I expected Jimmy said how wonderfully he acted as her husband and how proud he was to be a father. I know we were both given to our men because of our behaviour and you expected them to correct us, but he corrected her unduly and too frequently and more or less treated her as his unpaid whore, so much so that she planned to run away that night. Did Jimmy tell you that?�
�
�We heard she attacked him with a pan and beat him about the face with it while he rested in front of the fire,� Lord Henry answered.
�
�And is it true that he punched her stomach and caused the death of her baby?� Caroline asked.
�
�George DeVries says the doctor believes so and said to check with the medical man.� They discussed the matter for a while until Victoria asked, �For once in your life father, can you not forgive a little and let her stay with a man who appears to want her and is caring for her? I&#8217;m not asking this for myself, or even asking to be allowed back in here, but Juliette is a friend of mine and despite what we did, I feel it is time she should be allowed to make her own life. Again George believes her father and mother will agree but says she is your apprentice. You gave me the chance to leave, why not give her the same chance? Her life with Jimmy will be hell if she returns especially as he will exact a severe retribution for harming him. As I said, I am not asking for anything for myself, only to save her from more misery.�
�
�And I am willing to keep Vicky with me,� Tom spoke for the first time, �And maybe one day we may join as a proper man and wife.�
�
�Perhaps it would be sensible for the two of you to wait outside while Henry and I discuss what you have said,� Lady Caroline suggested.
�
Fifteen anxious minutes later, the door opened and her father caught Tom hugging his daughter as tears fell down her face. They returned to the study.
�
�It was most fortunate for you that my dear Lady Caroline had joined me this morning and added a more compassionate view than mine. She argued strongly that Juliette be allowed to stay with the DeVries&#8217;s and in the end I capitulated and have agreed.� Lord Henry stated.
�
�Thank you Sir, I&#8217;m sure you won&#8217;t regret it.�
�
�We also discussed your future. I&#8217;ve had words the estate manager over these past weeks and I know he has spoken to your father Thomas as well as other men working in the gardens and they all gave satisfactory or good reports of your work. Your father said the he and your mother still retain some reservations over your continued good behaviour but these reservations appear to be diminishing. Caroline wished me to absolve you from your apprenticeship too but I have decided to leave any decision on that until the first of the New Year. By then you will have been together for eight months and should you be in a stable relationship at that time, I will not stand in the way of your becoming man and wife and will hand over the funds I have of yours. However, I will not welcome you back into my home for I remember too well the sight of those poor girls bottoms, and yours too Thomas, and I would worry the temptation would resurface if you once again, have servants in your care.�
�
�Thank you Father but you need have no fear of that happening. My remembrance of the thrashing I received is more than enough to stay my hand on any whip, even on a horse. The funds if sufficient, I would put to the purchase of a house where Tom and I could live and raise a family but now I think we should return and impart the good news to George for I&#8217;m sure he is waiting anxiously for our return.�
�
�Just one more thing,� Lady Caroline hesitated before going on, �If our paths should cross in the gardens or elsewhere, do stop and have a few words. I know only too well of your past but still consider you part of Henry&#8217;s family.� Tears flowed down Vicky&#8217;s cheeks when Caroline clasped her and then shook hands with Tom. Although not forgiven, her family was partially restored to her and perhaps in a deeper relationship than before and she had the New Year to look forward to and plan for.
