 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Livia sipped her latte while she leaned against the building's wall and stared straight ahead, focusing intently on a couple sitting together at a diner across the street.&nbsp; Livia's glare followed every single action of the woman, trying to read the subtleties of her every move.&nbsp; She paid little attention to the lecherous glare's from every man and boy that stared at her black lace bra through her semi-transparent blouse.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The unknown woman smiled and laughed at everything Livia's boyfriend uttered.&nbsp; The woman reached across the table and grasped Robert's hand. As the conversation continued, Livia's contempt for the treacherous whore grew and grew. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The moment the secret lovers kissed, Livia knew she would get revenge against them both.

--------------------------------

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Livia Olivier stumbled through the garage door of her house in a blind rage and yelled at the top of her lungs, "How dare he cheat on me?&nbsp; How dare he!�, her voice full of unbridled rage.&nbsp; The thought of Robert cheating on her after dating for three years was incomprehensible, at least until his attitude towards her changed suddenly two weeks ago. Her deepest fears were now confirmed.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She rushed upstairs to her bathroom and began to cry.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How could he do this to me?&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She looked up and stared at herself in the mirror.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How could he not love this face?

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Livia was proud of her physical appearance.&nbsp; She ate healthy, worked out, and took perfect care of her white skin and long black hair.&nbsp; The constant stares from men of all ages fueled her ego, and she was long used to bagging every man she desired.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;However, Robert was different.&nbsp; Robert, the 6'2", muscular, tan, power-lawyer with short brown hair was the first man that Livia had to actively pursue.&nbsp; Sultry glares were not enough, and she had to go out of her way to be nice to him before he would pay any attention to her.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The chase was what made him special.&nbsp; The fact that Robert chose Olivia of all women soothed her fiery soul.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Now, unfortunately, the soothing effect was gone, and Livia burned with revenge against both Robert and his unnamed whore.&nbsp; Livia would teach both of them a lesson that would damage them for the rest of their lives.&nbsp; All Livia needed to do was recruit some help and figure out the woman's identity.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She picked up the phone and dialed her friends.

-------------------------------

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It didn't take long to figure out who Robert was cheating with.&nbsp; Her name was Korin Laurence, a secretary at his law firm.&nbsp; From the photos taken by Livia's friends, she knew that Korin was 5'7", blonde, with 34C breasts.&nbsp; In each of the photos, her round face wore little, if any, makeup, in stark contrast to Livia's crimson lipstick and heavy blush. The woman always seemed to show the same goofy smile, hinting at the type of perky, flirtatious attitude that Livia loathed.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Livia&#8217;s twin blonde friends did little to persuade her from one scheme to another, but after hours of planning and plotting with Jake and Hank she decided that there were more effective ways of punishing the whore than outright murder.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As Livia relayed the plan to Jake and Hank, all three members of the sadistic trio grew excited.&nbsp; The twins were willing to follow Livia's scheme, no matter how dark, as long as they got a piece of the action.&nbsp; Livia was tempted to fulfill her urges, then and there, but she stopped herself. The era of their m�nage-a-trois was long passed, and Livia prevented herself from falling back into the blissful and mindless lust.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Livia called Robert and scheduled a date for 8:30 Friday night at their favorite restaurant.&nbsp; She eagerly anticipated her moment of triumph over those that wronged her.

---------------------------------

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Friday night came, but Livia was nowhere near the restaurant at which Robert was waiting.&nbsp; Instead, she was fourteen miles away, sitting in the passenger&#8217;s seat of Jake's SUV.&nbsp; They watched for signs of activity inside of Korin's Cape Cod style house, as they had been for the last two hours. At 8:43 PM, the lights of Livia's bedroom turned on, and her silhouette could be seen from the street below.&nbsp; It was time for the trio to make their move.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Livia made way to the front door.&nbsp; Her friends flanked her sides.&nbsp; She looked through the window set into the top of the front door and saw that no lights on in the house, save one coming from Korin's bedroom and illuminating the second floor landing.&nbsp; She leaned against the frame of the door and rung the doorbell.&nbsp; Through the window, Livia saw Korin stumble out of her bedroom, half-dressed and buttoning up her white blouse.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As Korin walked down the stairs in her pantyhose, skirt, and blouse, she yelled "Who is it?"

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Livia smiled.&nbsp; "I think you accidentally took something of mine!", she answered, trying to sound like a neighbor that's lost something.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Korin opened the door and glanced at Livia and her two friends.&nbsp; Livia returned the glance with a smirk on her face.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Yes, you've definitely taken something of mine."&nbsp; Livia eased her foot inside the doorway.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Korin politely responded, "I think you have a mistake.&nbsp; Good bye."&nbsp; She tried to close the door, but it was too late.&nbsp; The door bounced off of Livia's shoe, and the trio muscled their way in for the capture.

-----------------------------------

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The trio returned to Livia's house with their bound and gagged prisoner in tow and began the interrogation.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Livia pushed the adulterer onto the carpet of the guest bedroom with her heel.&nbsp; Korin let loose a grunt of pain as she fell onto the floor face first.&nbsp; Her hands were chained behind her back by the same padded leather wrist cuffs Livia and Robert had used dozens of times. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The scorned lover stood over her captive, a cool malice controlling her actions.&nbsp; "What made you think you could steal my man from me?"&nbsp; She dug her heal into Korin's back, and the gagged woman squealed.&nbsp; She bent down, grabbed Korin's hair, and yanked her head up she they could look each other in the eyes.&nbsp; "Tell me, and be honest."&nbsp; She reached out and tore the tape off of Korin's mouth.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Korin Laurence gasped for air and closed her eyes, savoring the opportunity to breath freely once again.&nbsp; "Did you know he was planning to leave you?" she asked.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Rage burned inside Livia's soul.&nbsp; She slapped Korin across the face with all her might, sending the blonde girl back down to the floor.&nbsp; "Liar!&nbsp; That was just what he told you so he could get in your pants."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Korin flipped into her side.&nbsp; "No, its true.&nbsp; He called you a crazy bitch that he couldn't wait to find the moment to break up with. He was just waiting for the opportunity.&nbsp; Honest."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Livia yelled in frustration and approached her captive and pressed her foot against the side of Korin's face, contemplated crushing the bound woman&#8217;s skull.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No, the original plan is best.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She bent down and reattached the tape to Korin's mouth and left her with Jake and Hank while she went downstairs and called Robert.&nbsp; He answered on the third ring, just like usual.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Hey, Livia?&nbsp; Where are you at?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I'm at home.&nbsp; Sorry I didn't call. I got hung up at work.&nbsp; How about you just come here and we can skip right to the fun?"

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Robert paused, reaffirming Livia's fears that Korin was speaking the truth.&nbsp; He normally jumped at the offer of sex, the slight delay signaling that their spark was truly dead.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Sure, I'll be there in twenty minutes."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Livia closed her phone and waited for the prey to enter her trap.

--------------------------------

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Robert knocked on Livia's door, exactly on time.&nbsp; The lovers kissed in a passionate embrace that Livia knew would be their last.&nbsp; Rather than heartbreaking, it was satisfying; she looked forward to the torture she had planned.&nbsp; Livia grabbed his hand and led him upstairs, tearing off his clothing as they ascended.&nbsp; She unzipped his pants as they passed the closed door to their guest bedroom.&nbsp; Livia thought she heard a grunt coming from the room as they passed, but Robert paid no heed.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Livia pushed Robert onto the mattress in her bedroom and pounced on him with unusual aggressiveness.&nbsp; She straddled him and caressed his chest, his shirt unbuttoned, revealing his hairless well-toned chest.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Robert looked at her, puzzled, and asked "What's gotten into you?"

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Livia placed her right index finger against his lips to and shushed him quietly.&nbsp; She ran her red fingernail playfully across his lips and leaned closer. She stared him in the eyes, and said, "Let's just have some fun tonight, okay?"&nbsp; She leaned further and kissed him.&nbsp; Their lips locked and her tongue explored his mouth, but she could tell Robert was not as into it as he normally was.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He's really been stolen from me, hasn&#8217;t she.&nbsp; Well, I guess there's nothing left for me to do except this.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She reached into her nightstand and pulled out four pairs of cuffs.&nbsp; Robert raised his arms above his head like a well-conditioned pet.&nbsp; Livia grinned at him and cuffed his hands against the bed posts and his ankles to the far corners.&nbsp; She placed her hands on the sides of his clean-shaven face, still as smooth as he was every day.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I have a surprise for you, Robby.&nbsp; I know you'll love it." She yelled for her friends.&nbsp; Moments later, they arrived, their captive in tow.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Roberts eyes went wide when he saw his lover, bound and gagged, being roughly pushed by Livia's friends.&nbsp; He yelled, "Korin! Livia, what the hell are you doing?"&nbsp; He struggled against his handcuffs, their metallic frame cutting into his wrists.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Livia laughed in glee, "Hahahaha, I know all about you and this whore, Robert.&nbsp; Did you think you could slip it by me?"

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Let her go, you crazy bitch!&nbsp; This is the sort of shit that made me want to leave you in the first place."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"We wouldn't be here right now if you had just broken up with me rather than messing around behind my back."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"I was going to break up with you tonight."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Well, consider us broken up," said Livia, "but why don't we have a little bit off fun one last time?&nbsp;&nbsp; I know how much you love the rough stuff, but does your little whore feel the same way?".&nbsp; She turned her head towards Jake and Hank and nodded.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hank let loose a sign of satisfaction.&nbsp; "Finally.&nbsp; I thought you were going to let her go for a moment."

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jake chimed in, "What are the limits?&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Livia laughed. "There are none."&nbsp; She looked the tearful captive straight in the eyes, and smirked.&nbsp; "Have fun."&nbsp; Livia reached over to her nightstand and grabbed her roll of tape, tore a piece off, and placed it firmly over Robert's mouth.&nbsp; He screamed and tried to buck off his former lover.&nbsp; "Oh, Robert, can't you just relax for once?"

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The twins went to work on Korin, with Jake in Front and Hank at her rear.&nbsp; Hank reached around and wormed his hands insider of her blouse.&nbsp; The buttons burst off and fell softly to the carpet floor from a single tug. He grabbed a hold of each side of her bra and pulled, which he tore through with little resistance.&nbsp; Korin let loose a gasp, finally accepting what was about to happen to her.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hank rolled up her short skirt and tore at her pantyhose.&nbsp; He reached out with his right hand and rubbed his finger hard against her panties.&nbsp;&nbsp; "Oh, a nice little bow on your panties.&nbsp; Cute."&nbsp; He tore the thin piece of fabric and it fell to the floor.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;"Mrrrfffff!" Korin yelled against the tape that locked her lips together.&nbsp; The tears flowed faster.&nbsp; Her assailants unzipped their pants and pulled out their eight inch cocks.&nbsp; Hank grasped her thighs while his brother grabbed her in a bear hug.&nbsp; His arms supported her and his hands grabbed her tits.&nbsp; In unison, they lifted her into the air and penetrated her holes with their cocks.&nbsp; A pained squeal escaped her throat as the pounded her from front and back.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Livia rested beside her former lover, stroking his chest as they watched the fruits of her revenge.&nbsp; She noticed that his previously flaccid penis was slightly erect. "Oh?&nbsp; Watching your new girlfriend get raped is turning you on?&nbsp; I wonder if you ever had that same fantasy about me..." She kneeled on the bed and caressed his cock and balls with her hands.&nbsp; He grew more and more aroused as she did her work.&nbsp; He closed his eyes and began mumbling to himself, but it did nothing to subside his arousal.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It did not take long before he was ready for action.&nbsp; Livia slid off her panties while still wearing her skirt, bra, and fishnet shirt.&nbsp; She mounted Robert and accepted his cock into her cunt and began using her former boyfriend's body like a piece of meat.&nbsp; He resisted the entire time, but was helpless against Livia's control.&nbsp; She bounced up and down on his defenseless body.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She continued to use and abuse his body, coming to climax after climax, enjoying the final dance with her boyfriend.&nbsp; After hours of abusing him, she collapsed in exhaustion and rested aside Robert.&nbsp; Tears streamed down his face.&nbsp; It was the first time that Livia had seen him cry.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hank and Jake were finished with their prey too, at least for the moment.&nbsp; She sat on the floor, leaned back against a dresser, her face flush with tears that streamed down her cheeks and across her tape gag while cum dripped from her holes.&nbsp; Hank and Jake were beside her, sprawled on their backs, enjoying the moments rest after coming the same way they did pretty much everything-- in unison.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Livia Olivier stood up off of her bed and looked over the four exhausted bodies in front of her and accepted a simple truth, that &#8216;all good things most come to an end&#8217;.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;However, then was not the time.&nbsp; Livia still burned with contempt for the cheating boyfriend and his whore, and they had all weekend to learn their lesson.&nbsp; She headed to her closet to get more toys, and exited with a dildo in each hand.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There were many more lessons for her to teach.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was fun while it lasted.&nbsp; 

The first week was a near unending orgy of vengeance against Robert and his lover Korin.&nbsp; Livia savored every moment of their tears and cries 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I&#8217;m sorry, Livia!�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�He said things were over between you two, I swear!�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She didn&#8217;t believe either of their protests, but she appreciated their absolute relentless to escape their deserved fate.&nbsp; Through the whippings, wax play, ravishment, they never ceased to come up with new excuses.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�We won&#8217;t tell anyone!�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Just let her go, please!�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Robert&#8217;s cries only deepened the wound of his rejection.&nbsp; He would have never said anything so selfless for Livia&#8217;s sake.&nbsp; No matter how hard she tried, she could never attain that special place in a man&#8217;s heart to be held and protected forever.&nbsp; Livia&#8217;s only appeal was a sultry lasciviousness, and never had she allowed a relationship to go on long enough for her to be the dumped.

&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;After the first night, the captives were transferred to the twins&#8217; place, for Livia knew there would be an investigation.&nbsp; She had no problems lying to police, and did so convincingly.&nbsp; They did a brief inspection of her house, found nothing, and moved on, believing Livia&#8217;s notion that they had ran off together.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Not for a single moment did the horrifying crimes faze Livia Olivier.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The twins &#8216;took care&#8217; of them, they said.&nbsp; Livia didn&#8217;t know exactly what they meant, but she suspected that they hawked them onto some of their shadier friends.&nbsp; The mere thought of her former boyfriend and his whore of a mistress spending the rest of their days in some filthy basement in the ghetto made her wet.&nbsp; Or better still, trained slaves in some rich couple&#8217;s dungeon.&nbsp; Either would be a fitting life for those who crossed her.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She didn&#8217;t care, either way.&nbsp; If the twins profited, it was fine by her, and if they were dead, it was only a slight waste of potential.&nbsp; From the moment Robert and Korin crossed Livia Olivier, their lives became meaningless.

--------------------------------

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The next few months passed without the slightest hint of danger.&nbsp; Without Robert around, Livia turned to anybody she could find to sate her desires.&nbsp; Dozens of random men got what they wanted, and so did she.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It never crossed her mind that, maybe, she was getting taken advantage of.&nbsp; There was a lesson waiting to be learned.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

-----------------------------------


 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The twins arrived unannounced one Saturday night, just as Livia was putting on black lipstick.&nbsp; She found it to be a great way to draw attention and flirtations.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What are you two doing here?� she asked as they stood at her doorstep.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m on my way out for the evening.�&nbsp; It was after nine o&#8217;clock, and her growing lust was already clouding her thoughts.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No, I don&#8217;t think you are.�&nbsp; Jake stopped forward and batted the door back with his right arm.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Livia stumbled backwards, stunned. �What?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hank followed behind his twin brother. �We&#8217;re taking back something that once belonged to us.�&nbsp; The door slipped shut behind him, and he slid the deadbolt in to place.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It had been years since their house of three had ended, and not a single blip of remorse had been shown among them.&nbsp; Livia never noticed their glares, believing the era to true be forgotten.&nbsp; But now they moved with determined lust in her eyes.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She had to escape, no matter what it took.&nbsp; Her feet barely touched the ground as she fled for the back door.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was locked, and the time spent fumbling with its mechanism was enough for the twins to catch her.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�There&#8217;s no breaking up with us this, time Livia.�&nbsp; Jake grabbed her by her waist and threw her to the floor.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hank pounced on his brother&#8217;s prey, grabbing each of her wrists and hoisting her just slightly off the ground.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Before she realized precisely what was happening, Jake&#8217;s pants her off, and his stiffening cock stared at her.&nbsp; Her short black skirt and fish net stockings offered no protection.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For the briefest moment, she wished she had worn panties, if only to delay his attack by just a few more seconds.&nbsp; With her thighs held tightly beneath Jake&#8217;s arms, her own descent into hell began.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She wasn&#8217;t ready.&nbsp; Though they had made loved thousands of times, it had always been on her terms, whenever she was ready.&nbsp; She wished she could unclench her muscle, slacken her body, and wet herself, anything to make the hurting stop

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But that wasn&#8217;t what the twins wanted, and she knew it.&nbsp; They wanted to cause her pain.&nbsp; �Why?� she asked, but they only smiled and laughed.&nbsp; Hank pulled one way, and Jake the other.&nbsp; She was defenseless to their ravishments with her body stretched to its limits.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He spared no mercy in his attack.&nbsp; He rammed his cock in hard and deep

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tears welled in her eyes.&nbsp; �Why?&nbsp; How could you do this to me?!�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His warmth emptied inside of her, and the other twin took his place.&nbsp; She still resisted, but it was only a token defense, her body growing too weak to be useful.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The inexplicable abuse continued.&nbsp; Livia Olivier, the cruel and heartless bitch that raped and sold her former lover, had no choice but to suffer the same indignation and disgrace at the hands of her own former lovers.&nbsp; Years ago, soon after her parents died and left her a sizeable inheritance, she let the twins move in with her.&nbsp; 

It was meant to be a temporary stay at first, but weeks turned into months of unending fucking, their cocks the only thing that could fill the holes in her soul.&nbsp; But just like everything else in her life, she grew bored and cut them off.

But now they were back, taking back what was once theirs with no sign of gentleness or mercy

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Sometime after the fourth fucking, she realized something unusual about their behavior.&nbsp; The twins had never been so vigorous before.&nbsp; Though perverted, they almost never had sex less than hours apart. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Drugs.&nbsp; It must have been drugs.&nbsp; They had gloated before in the past about having connections.&nbsp; That&#8217;s what it was.&nbsp; Their thoughts were clouded.&nbsp; Eventually they would come to their sense and free her.&nbsp; She was certain of it.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But their attitudes didn&#8217;t change.&nbsp; They attacked her with sadistic glee, filling her holes in tandem with smiles, offering not the slightest hint of why they were raping her other than to see her suffer.&nbsp; What pleasure could they get from shoving their dicks in her mouth?&nbsp; She barely moved a muscle as they pushed her head back and forth.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hours passed.&nbsp; Cum caked her cheeks and thighs and the strength to fight back had long since been torn from her.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A moment&#8217;s rest came, neither twin ready to take a place between her legs.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�So are you done?� Hank asked.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�For now,� Jake answered.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Let&#8217;s get her ready for bed, then.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The twins picked her up from the sweaty and sticky kitchen floor and carried her up to her bedroom.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Let me go��

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Not just yet.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They laid her to rest on her king-sized bed and dug up a pair of bondage cuffs from beneath it.&nbsp; They locked them tightly around each of her wrists and chained them to corner bed posts.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Please��

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hank laughed and looked to his brother.&nbsp; �Should we tell her?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Let&#8217;s.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hank crawled into bed beside Livia and placed his left hand across atop her sore and swollen left breast.&nbsp; He stroked it gently while he delivered news of her fate.&nbsp; �We left some� presents with an associate of ours.&nbsp; Evidence.&nbsp; If we go missing or end up dead, they have orders to open it up, and what they find�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�� would be quite horrible for you.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She understood immediately what they intended.&nbsp; It was blackmail.&nbsp; If she spoke up about her own rape, she would go to prison for the ones she committed.&nbsp; She closed her eyes, and mustered what little strength she could. �Then why don&#8217;t I just go to the police right now?&nbsp; You&#8217;re the ones that actually got rid of them.&nbsp; That&#8217;s far worse in the eyes of the law.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jake stood tall and flexed his muscles.&nbsp; �I think we can take care of ourselves in prison.&nbsp; But you?�&nbsp; He chuckled.&nbsp; �You&#8217;re going to get torn apart, either by prisoners or horny guards.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Their words rang true.&nbsp; Her blood ran cold as their treacherous bondage encircled her soul.&nbsp; She was caught, and there was little hope.&nbsp; Their words and schemes were the product of sound minds, not addled by drugs like she had hoped.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Did they plan this from the very beginning?&nbsp; Thinking back, they always seemed eager to help in Livia&#8217;s schemes.&nbsp; They assisted in the kidnapping, abusing the victims, and disposing of them when they were finished.&nbsp; Had they been collecting evidence the entire time, to reclaim Livia&#8217;s body as their property?

The sadism that they demonstrated would not fade like a brief high.&nbsp;&nbsp; It would be permanent.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�We&#8217;re moving in.&nbsp; The good old days are back to stay, Livia.�
