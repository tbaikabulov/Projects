The True Valedictorian

By Razor7826

&nbsp;

So this is how life as I know it
ends.

&nbsp;

I haven�t truly slept in what feels
like weeks, the men here constantly interrupting the brief moments of shut-eye
to rape and violate my body.� I spend
every moment of every day collared and chained to the wall of a stone and metal
dungeon, arms bound behind my back with leather wrist cuffs.� I�ve long since been trained away from trying
to bite down on any stray penises, since the one attempt led to a severe beating
that I dare not repeat.� While I may be
filled with malice for my assailants, my behavior is still tempered by dread
that things could be worse.

&nbsp;

I, Natalie Tweed, should have known
better than to mess with Sarah Sloan.� A total shark, we battled it out for over three years to see
who would be the valedictorian.� More
than once she pulled ahead with an extra A+ on her report card, trumping my
traditional A�s.� None if it made sense,
though.� Her work was no better than
mine, nor were her test scores, by both my judgment and that of everyone else
in my class.

&nbsp;

Sarah Sloan was the stereotypical
prim and proper upper-class temptress, the sole heir to the vast fortune of her
elderly father and deceased mother.�
While clearly devoted to her school work, nobody respected her intelligence.� I, on the other hand, was the nerdy genius
type.� Rarely a class period went by that
I didn�t have my nose in an extracurricular book, knowing that even if I didn�t
pay attention I could get the grades I needed.�
The honest truth was, that, until I started
applying to colleges, I didn�t really care about my GPA, my minimal effort
existing only to appease my parents.� I
wasn�t even particularly social.� While I
had a nice white complexion and lithe body, I always hid it behind comfortably
sweat shirts and the such, valuing comfort over style.

&nbsp;

My academic outlook changed as a
stared down the huge financial burden of higher education.� The beginning of my senior year was marked by
obsessive compulsive tendencies on everything that pertained to school work.� Frequent all-nighters, a shunned social life,
and a total disregard for the things I used to love were the prices I had to
pay to cover those last few grade points.

&nbsp;

Yet still Sarah Sloan bested my
GPA.� How was that possible?� I was way smarter than her, and far more
capable of producing great work, something that was proven over and over and
over.� Something was not adding up.

&nbsp;

So, I began to pry, a mistake that
would cost me both my freedom and my innocence.�
I followed her, asked around.�
Nobody thought anything was suspicious about her achievements but me.

&nbsp;

Eventually the following paid
off.� One night in February I was at the
school library late, finishing up research for an English paper.� On the way out to my car, I noticed that
Sarah�s car was still there.� What could
this mean?� She had no reason to be here
this late, so I decided to look around.

&nbsp;

A few minutes into my search, I saw
Sarah walking down the deserted hallway, heading for the main office.� Her back was turned to me, but I could
recognize her meticulous hair from a mile away.�
I followed her, making sure she never noticed me.� Looking around, she entered the main office
and knocked on the Principal Sola�s door.�
The door unlocked and opened up, and Sarah disappeared behind the door
before it locked shut.� Things were
starting to get interesting.

&nbsp;

I quickly made my way to the door,
where I crouched down and put cupped my ear against the wood.� On the other side, I could hear slurping
noises, and as I began to understood the secret to
Sarah�s success, I let out an audible gasp.�
Realizing my mistake, I covered my mouth, but it was too late- the
mistake had sealed my fate.� The slurping
noises stopped at the door opened.� In
front of me stood the principal, hastily dressed, his shirt untucked.

&nbsp;

�Ms. Tweed, what do you think we
are doing?� Are you trying to spy on
us?�� Principal Eric Sola was an
intimidating man.� Tall, dark well-kept
hair, and in his early thirties, he rose through the administrative system on
the strength of his no bull-shit attitude.�
I looked down and saw Sarah peeking up from the other side of the
principal�s desk, her bare shoulders telling her tale.� �Why don�t you come in.� We need to have a little talk.�� He then grabbed my arm and helped me up,
though he showed no aversion to being a little rough with me.

&nbsp;

Inside the office, Sarah was busy
redressing, trying her best to stay out of sight.� Fumbling around out of site, she eventually
realized that there was no use attempting to hide what they were doing.� As was my usual approach, I decided to just
be up front about what I knew and what I was going to do with that
information.� �I know you two were having
sex, and I�m not going to keep it a secret.�
Now I know how her grades ended up higher than mine.�� I turned to the door and started to leave,
but the principal grabbed me by my collar and yanked me back into his office.

&nbsp;

�Shit!� Why the hell did you have to go and say all
that?� Sarah, what should we do?�

&nbsp;

The pampered princess finished putting
her clothes back on and smiled at her illicit lover.� �Some business associates of my father would
love to work with a girl like her.� Let
me place a few phone calls while I organize things.�� She pulled her cell phone out of her purse
and dialed one of the numbers in her phonebook.�
Meanwhile, the principal held each of my wrists so hard they hurt.

&nbsp;

�What are you doing, Dr. Sola?� Don�t make things worse than they already
are!� I yelled, sounding like a shameless do-gooder.� He merely smiled back at me.

&nbsp;

�I believe you are the one that
should be worrying about how bad things can get.�� What he said started to get me worried.� What were they planning to do with me?� Obviously they were none too happy with my
honesty.� I tried screaming for help, but
Dr. Sola merely removed my right shoe, took off my sock, and then crammed it
into my mouth.� I continued to struggle,
but the futility quickly became apparent and I gave up, instead waiting for a
more opportune moment to attempt escape.

&nbsp;

Within fifteen minutes, Sarah�s
friends showed up, a group of men all in their twenties.� Their leader, a bald Italian man, asked Sarah
what they wanted to do with me.� �Take
her to the factory.� Use her as a cum dump for all eternity, as far as I care.� As long as she spends the rest of her life in
misery and can never relay what she saw her today, I don�t give a damn.�� The men smiled as they took me away.� As I was tossed into the men�s van, I saw one
of them take the keys out of my now stolen purse and drive away in my car, probably
to be cubed at some shady junkyard.� My
long term prospects were not looking good.

&nbsp;

When we reached the destination,
the men took Sarah�s request literally, which is how I ended up in the horrible
situation with which I began my story.

&nbsp;

I have no freedom to speak of.� Just a few feet of slack between my chain and
the wall, my entire body always resting in what amount to just a giant
toilet.� A handle on the wall flushes my
little pen with water, sweeping away all cum, waste, and tears, leaving me clean
and ready for further assault.

&nbsp;

They don�t let me sleep, and I�m
starting to lose my mind because of it.�
Who knows how much time has passed.�
Days?� Weeks?� Months?� 

&nbsp;

The life I once had is over.� I was the smartest girl in my school,
destined to a life of success, but because I poked my nose where it didn�t
belong I�ve lost everything.� My entire
life now consists of nothing but endless rape, a stream of men using me for
both their physical pleasure and for the fulfillment of their mental sadism.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

What felt like years later, the
initiator of the crimes against me paid a visit.� Sarah Sloan wore an expensive black dress,
with a fur coat over it.��� Her hair was
still as elaborate as usual, her skin completely without blemishes, and body
fine and trimmed.� She walked over
towards and deg her high heel into my stomach, until she was certain that I was
paying attention.� �Hello, you dumb bitch.� Don�t you feel kind of stupid for trying to
spy on me?� For all the kinds of genius
you thought you were, couldn�t you tell that crossing the daughter of a mob
family would be a bad idea?�� I really
had no idea she was mob connected, but I guess I should have seen the
signs.� �You tried ruining everything,
you fucking cunt.� Fortunately,
everything got packaged away nicely.� We
made it look like your car went into the ocean while you took a scenic route
home, and your body was never recovered.��
I could hear what she was saying, but I was unable to comprehend it all
in my exhausted state.

&nbsp;

�My dear father passed away last
week, leaving all of this under my control.�
Perhaps someday I�ll let you go, but for now I think your presence is
required to keep my employees happy.�
Farewell, Natalie.� I guess you
weren�t nearly as smart as you thought you were.�� Sarah watched in glee as one of her
subordinates mounted me and began fucking my ass.

&nbsp;

Every moment, I hope and pray that
these men will get bored of me and just let me rest, but there are just too
many different men for such a thing to be a possibility.� I know that for the rest of my life, I�ll be
kept like this. 

&nbsp;

The events leading up to my capture
run through my mind constantly.� If I had
done any number of things differently, I could have escaped this fate, but I
failed.

&nbsp;

This is the price of my error.

Corin�s Dream

By Razor 7826

&nbsp;

(Note: This chapter is taken from one of the many possible
outcomes in my story �The End of the World As We Know
It� at CHYOO.com)

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

I know that I'm not the most liked
girl in school, but I only want to help the teacher so everybody gets the most
out of their education. In this spirit, I appointed myself Miss Smith's
assistant during this time of crisis.�
Several days ago, we believe full-scale nuclear war broke out, isolating
our small private college at a time when the school was mostly deserted, just a
few days before the end of Christmas break.

&nbsp;

I had just witnessed the gang of
boys leave the school without Teacher's permission, and reported their horrible
behavior to her. She didn't seem to think there was anything
she could do at this point, so she let their disobedience slide. Still wanting
to help out the teacher, I stayed close to her in case she needed
anything.� After about an hour, I offered
my help.

&nbsp;

&quot;Teacher, do you need any
help.&quot; I perkily said.

&nbsp;

&quot;Um... Sure, Corin, help keep
an eye on the other girls.&quot; I happily agreed.

&nbsp;

For the next few hours, I kept
track of where all the girls were. Rachel went up to the bathroom, but thirty
minutes later she still hadn't returned. I ran up to tell Miss Smith about the
missing student. &quot;Teacher, Rachel's been gone for a half an hour!&quot;
Miss Smith seemed to be contemplating what to do.

&nbsp;

Miss Smith thought for a few
moments before deciding what to do.�
&quot;Kim, would you be willing to go check on Rachel? She went to the
women' bathroom on the first floor.&quot;

&nbsp;

&quot;Uh, sure Miss Smith&quot;
responded the tiny Asian girl. She walked up the stairs with a confused look on
her face.

&nbsp;

Fifteen minutes passed without Kim
returning. I started to shake in fear. What on Earth could they be doing?� I could see Miss Smith starting to worry as
well. She turned to me and said &quot;Corin, could you please go upstairs to
look for them?&quot;

&nbsp;

I was still shaking, but I wanted
to be strong for Miss Smith. But honestly, was I strong enough to investigate
the disappearance of two of my classmates?�
It didn�t matter, I would do anything to
impress Teacher.

&nbsp;

&quot;Sh... Sure
thing, Teacher.&quot; I really wanted to impress Miss Smith, so I went
against my better judgment and headed up the stairs to find Rachel and Kim.

&nbsp;

I was incredibly scared as I
wandered into the bathroom. There were no signs of the girls. I walked back
into the first floor hallway. &quot;Rachel? Kim? Are either of you there?&quot;
Still no response. I decided to check the second
floor. There was no sign of them either, but I thought I heard a noise from one
of the classrooms down the hall. I went to investigate and saw one of the most
disgusting things I've ever seen. Near the center of the classroom, Frank and
Micheal were fucking both little Kim's mouth and vagina.

&nbsp;

&quot;Hmmpph.
mmmmm!!!!&quot; The muffled screams of protest from Kim filled the room,
obviously unhappy with her current situation. Her face was covered in tears and
man juice.

&nbsp;

It was then that I finally noticed
the events in the other corner. Cain was shoving his penis back and forth into
a girl's mouth, and I assumed that girl was Rachel. I could see her arms with
cuffs on her wrists, and chains holding her thick arms up and to the sides.� The long blond hair flowing to the sides of
her head assured me it was her.

&nbsp;

What did Miss Smith send me into?

&nbsp;

I felt a quick shove from behind
and stumbled into the room. I turned around to see Tony pull the door shut,
then leapt on top of me.

&nbsp;

&quot;Get off of me, you fat
bastard!&quot;, but Tony continued with his work. The ogre started tearing off
my school uniform. Both the over vest and skirt were torn off easily, leaving
me in just my panties and bra. Those didn't last much longer. I was naked
underneath him, bawling my eyes out, fearing my inevitable rape. Was this the
way my virginity would go?

&nbsp;

&quot;Please... don't rape me&quot;
I uttered. Cain stopped ramming Rachel's mouth and walked over to me, his penis
still erect. 

&nbsp;

&quot;Oh, you don't want us to rape
you? Well, then, I have a better idea. Tony, chain her to the teacher's
desk.&quot; Tony complied with Cain's orders and fastened wrist cuffs to each
appendage of mine. He slammed me down on the desk, knocking the wind of out of
me, just before he fastened a ball gag around my mouth. I was now chained to
the desk, as Tony exited the room and Cain joined Frank and Michael in raping
Kim. It wasn't long before Kim passed out in pain.

&nbsp;

About half an hour later, Miss
Smith peeked into the room and saw the horror show. Shocked, she looked around,
and I started screaming to get her attention. By the time her eyes reached me,
Tony was sneaking up behind her. I tried to warn her, but my attempts failed as
the brute incapacitated her with a stun gun. I started to cry, realizing that
my only hope had just been taken down.

&nbsp;

For the next ten minutes or so,
Cain guided them in dressing the limp body of Miss Smith knee-high leather
boots, a large ball gag, ankle and wrist cuffs, a leather corset, and long
leather gloves. Lastly, they put on a pair of panties that had a gigantic dildo
sticking out the front. While Cain was putting on the finishing touches, the
others moved me to the center of the floor, and chained my arms and legs
tightly in four different directions. Once Teacher's legs were chained together
and her arms were linked behind her back, Cain started slapping Miss Smith's
face. She eventually came to see the monsters standing above her, grinning.
Miss Smith tried to stand up, but realized how she was dressed.

&nbsp;

&quot;Oh dear Teacher, it looks
like we have you in quite the predicament&quot; gloated Frank. &quot;We always
knew you and little Corin were particularly close to each other, but now we're
giving you the perfect opportunity to show your love. Make love to little Corin
here, or we're going to have to kill these two over there.&quot; Cain pulled
out a knife and walked towards Rachel and Kim, who were now chained together,
back to back. I started to cry, begging Miss Smith not to rape me, but I knew
she couldn't hear me. 



Miss Smith started to cry as well.
She is really a beautiful woman. Her hair is pulled back behind her hair and
held with a scrunchy. Her glasses sit on her perfect nose, and the ball gag
barely interfered with her beautiful mouth. Seeing her cry at her dilemma hurt
me deeply, but I didn't want her to rape me. I was scared. I could hear the
muffled screams off my bound classmates, and I could understand why they wanted
to see me get raped, but I'm a virgin!

&nbsp;

&quot;So, Teacher, are we going to
have to get violent?&quot; taunted Cain.

&nbsp;

Miss Smith closed her eyes, then stumbled towards me. She knelt between my legs with
that monstrous dildo sitting just outside of my virginity. At that point, I
lost it. I started screaming and flailing around madly.

&nbsp;

The truth is I love Miss Smith with
all my heart. I'm a lesbian, but up until now, I've been suppressing it. My parents
are fundamentalist Christians, and they would disown me if they knew I was a
lesbian.

&nbsp;

I love Miss Smith, but I don't want
it to be like this.

&nbsp;

With a pained look on her face,
Teacher finally shoved the dildo in to me.

&nbsp;

&quot;MMHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH&quot;

&nbsp;

Back and forth, she thrust into me,
while the boys grinned and laughed. This was the worst thing that ever happened
to me, and I felt my mind just breaking away, no longer able to deal with my
horrible reality.� The dildo tore into
me, repeatedly and rhythmically, filling my body with a pain I never imagined
could exist.� The woman I loved was
raping me.

&nbsp;

Why did my life have to end up like
this?

&nbsp;

Why?

Why?

Why?

A Mother�s Life Lessons

By Razor7826

&nbsp;

(Based on the Hentai game, Kyouhaku 2)

&nbsp;

�I do.�� With those words, Christine Ono married her
second husband, Snow Inoue, with only her two daughters as witnesses.

&nbsp;

Sarah, the twenty year-old luscious
blond, and Maya, the nine-teen year old brunette, looked at each other, sadness
and worry in their perfect green eyes.�
Unbeknownst to Christine, Sarah and Maya had been blackmailed into
horrible sex acts by Snow, using the double leverage of Sarah�s illicit
relationship with a professor and Maya�s latent incestuous lesbian fantasies for
her older sister.

&nbsp;

The last month of summer break had
been hell for the girls.� Many nights
were spent in room 309 of a local love hotel, where the girls would be violated
in unimaginable ways by Snow�s friends.�
Strangely absent during the nightly assaults was Snow, who later proved
to be wining and dining their widowed mother.

&nbsp;

The assaults had ended since the
engagement announcement one week ago.�
Now the sisters watched their mother make a terrible mistake, both
wanting to scream the truth of his horrible but actions, but both also fearing
the power held in Snow�s blackmail.� The
uneasy glances continued between the sisters all throughout the ceremony and
the celebratory dinner at a fancy restaurant.�
All Christine saw on Snow�s face were smiles, but to the girls he gave
gloating grins, indicating his sense of triumph.

&nbsp;

That night began like all the
nights since the couples wedding announcement, with the buxom Christine making
no attempts to muffle her moans of pleasure.�
Her screams echoed through the house as her two daughters gathered in Sarah�s
room, which shared a wall with her mother�s bedroom.� Sarah and Maya sat in each other�s warm
embrace, fondling each other through their pajamas as Maya gently sucked on Sarah�s
lips.� While the blackmail and rapes of
the previous month had been truly horrific, the experience brought the two
sisters closer.� The taboo against incest
had been shattered and removed through the horrible games their tormentors made
them play with each other.� Now, their
love for each other was all that kept them going.� In each other�s embrace, they felt safe from
the monster in the next room.

&nbsp;

The girls would soon learn that
Snow was not the only monster in the house.

&nbsp;

As their arousal increased, the
girls leaned onto their bed and pulled out the same type of U-shaped double
dildo that was used so effectively in their torments.� Now Sarah rested on top of her younger
sister, her vibrations pleasuring them both as they wrestled with their
tongues.� They had no idea how loud their
moans were, nor did notice when the moaning stopped from the other room.� It was several more minutes before they
noticed Snow looming over them in his boxer shorts.� When Maya realized their incestuous love was
being watched, she let loose a yelp.� �Aiiii!�

&nbsp;

����������� The sisters
scrambled to cover their naked bodies with Sarah�s bed sheets.� They stared at the ground, unable to hide
what they were doing.

&nbsp;

����������� At that
point, Chrstine came in, wearing fine red lingerie and a see through gown, and
let loose a shocked gasp as she realized what her daughters were doing
together.� �Sarah! Maya!� I can�t believe you two!� Do you have an explanation for this.. this� abomination?�� Their mother, an American, was born a
Christian and had difficulty deciding which to be more appalled by- the rampant
lesbianism, or the incest.

&nbsp;

����������� Sarah
quickly jumped on the defensive.� �Mom�
we need to tell you something about what Snow did to us.�� Snow was noticeably getting afraid, knowing
that his secret was about to get blown.�
�He raped both of us before he ever even met you.� He was just using you to get closer to us.�� Mom� he�s a monster!��� Sarah started to cry.� �Don�t listen to what he says� mom�
please��� Looking at her crying daughter,
Christine began to feel like she had made a terrible mistake.

&nbsp;

����������� �Snow� is
it true?� asked Christine, staring at her husband.

&nbsp;

����������� Snow looked
down at the floor and smiled.� �I guess
all good things must pass.�� For reasons
then unknown, he walked to the bedroom window and rotated the vertical blinds
open and shut a few times.� The dumb little girls don�t know what the hell
they are talking about, Snow thought to himself.� No huge loss, though.� The things would just have to move a little
bit ahead of schedule.

&nbsp;

����������� �Christine,
I think these girls misunderstand my true intentions.� I truly do love you, and the other
accusations aren�t quite true, but I guess that doesn�t matter anymore, either.�

&nbsp;

����������� �What does
that mean?� asked Christine, not hearing the front door open and a pair of
footsteps walk up the stairs.� She stared
at her daughters and husband struggling to figure out what to do.

&nbsp;

����������� Snow made
up her mind for her.� Two large men snuck
up behind her.� The larger of the two
gave her a shove, forcing her to stumble to the ground.� Maya and Sarah recognized as the men that had
helped Snow rape them so many times over the last month.� Before any of the women realized what was
going on, Snow and his friends had the three women handcuffed.� They struggled with the men to no avail as
they were dragged down the hall into the master bedroom.� The three women were thrown onto the king
sized bed, face down and in a row, the mother flanked
by her grown daughters.

&nbsp;

����������� Sarah and
Maya both cried, fearing that their lives would once again be consumed and
defined by the sex forced upon them.�
Between them, Christine was a more complex mix of emotions.� She was certainly sad that her daughters were
so miserable at having the sex forced upon them, but there was more going
on.� Deep inside, Christine could feel
her dormant lust revive.� As her
daughters screamed in pain beside her, she began to remember the wild orgies of
her youth.

&nbsp;

����������� Those days,
so long ago, were happy and care free times.�
Even if she was known as a slut, she was free, doing whatever she
wanted, whenever she wanted.� As she
neared thirty, those days slowed down and she had children, but she always
longed for those care free days.

&nbsp;

����������� How could
her daughters not love it as well?� The
warmth inside of her drover her mad, but it seemed to be bring
nothing but pain to Sarah and Maya.�
Christine felt more sympathy over their aversion to sex than she did
over their painful rape.� 

&nbsp;

����������� �Aiiii! Please.. stop
it�.� Cried Maya to Christine�s right.

&nbsp;

����������� �Mother�
sister... I can�t take it anymore�� screamed Sarah from Christine�s other side.

&nbsp;

����������� Christine,
on the other hand, enjoyed the way she was being handled. During all previous
sexual encounters, Snow had been nothing but gentle to here.� Now, Snow slapped her ass and pulled her long
blonde hair, and Christine loved it.

&nbsp;

����������� �Yes!� Yes!�
Give it to me harder! Ah.. ah�.�

&nbsp;

����������� �Mom� what�
are you doing?�� cried
Sarah, startled at her mother�s behavior.�
How could she possibly like what was being done to them?

&nbsp;

����������� As Christine
orgasmed, a change came over her.� It may
be impossible to state the cause for the change.� Perhaps it was dread and fear of the power
Snow now held over the lives, or perhaps it was the reason that she told
herself.� Either way, Christine Ono had
resolved to fully devote herself to making sure her daughters make the most of
their youth in the same way Christine herself had.

&nbsp;

����������� Even if they didn�t want to.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

-Two days later-

&nbsp;

����������� Christine
walked into her bedroom, phone and phonebook in hand.� She quickly found the number of her
daughters� community college and dialed the enrollment office.

&nbsp;

����������� �Hello,
this is mother of Sarah and Maya Ono.�
Yes, we�ve decided that they should enroll in a different program
somewhere else.�

&nbsp;

����������� �MMMMmmfffffff!�

&nbsp;

����������� �No, there
wasn�t anything your school did incorrectly.�
Just a change in life goals, that�s all.�

&nbsp;

����������� �Ngggggg!�

&nbsp;

����������� �Ah, yes,
their Social Security numbers are��

&nbsp;

����������� �Mmmmmm�.
Mmmmm��

&nbsp;

����������� �No, we
won�t require any transcripts at this time.�
Thank you very much.�� Christine turned
off the phone and smiled at her two daughters.�
Sarah and Maya laid on Christine�s bed, side by side, their arms pulled
above their head and handcuffed to the brass headboard. Duct tape covered their
mouths and muffled their moans as Snow�s two friends worked their lower bodies.

&nbsp;

����������� Part of
Christine knew the discomfort her girls must be going through, but it was a
small price to pay for the fulfillment of her dream.� Sarah and Maya would grow to love the
fulfillment that could be found in a man�s cock, even if the road to pleasure
traversed weeks, or even months, of pain.�
Their lesbianism and sexual reticence would be plucked away- the gift of
a caring mother to her grown daughters.

&nbsp;

����������� Snow stood
in the entrance of the bedroom and gazed at his wife, shocked and amazed at how
cold she could be.� Sarah was right; the
marriage was originally just a sham, but instead he found an accomplice to his
sexual perversions.� In his eyes, Christine
was the perfect wife and mother.

Or Else

&nbsp;

Be at the men�s
bathroom tonight at 5PM� or else.

&nbsp;

����������� Alice reread the note on
her �special� pager.� A sinking feeling
filled her stomach as the soles of her feet carried her towards Central Park.� How
had she gotten into this mess?

&nbsp;

����������� Three weeks
ago, Alice
found a mysterious envelope in her school locker.� It contained discreet photographs detailing Alice�s frequent
masturbation in inappropriate situations, including one her obviously fingering
herself during Senior Math.� Along with
the incriminating photos was an unsigned note, with the cryptic warning, �Come
alone to the men�s bathroom in Central Park,
10PM tonight.�� In those juvenile and
innocent days, nothing seemed worse than those photos being made public.

&nbsp;

����������� Now her
problems went far beyond simple photographs.

&nbsp;

����������� That first
night in the bathroom, Alice
had been subject to near uncountable violations by her Japanese classmate
Tomoko and her friends.� As she laid in a
stall, dripping cum into the toilet, Tomoko threw a pager to Alice�s feet.�
�You�ll come when we call for you, or else��

&nbsp;

����������� Alice always thought the
�or else�� pertained to the photographs, but she would eventually learn that
the punishment for defiance was far worse.�


&nbsp;

����������� For a
month, Alice
followed all of her tormentor�s demands.�
She went from an innocent 19-year old virgin to having done nearly
everything in the book.� Even worse, she
dragged her friends into the mess as well, all to save her own skin.� Corin thought her
friend Alice was brining her to cool club, but instead she was traded into
slavery.� Alice
knew what she was doing was horrible, but she also knew that every time they
fucked Corin would amount to one less assault against
Alice.� 

&nbsp;

����������� Corin�s disappearance raised lots of questions around
school, but fortunately for Alice and the nerdy girl�s captors, she was
classified as a runaway.� Alice knew the truth,
though; Corin was chained to a bed in some low-grade
brothel, violated in every orifice for the profit of her owners.

&nbsp;

����������� Sadly, with
Corin out of the way, the
gang returned their attentions to Alice,
their rapes becoming ever the more brutal as they grew tired of their traditional
perversions.

&nbsp;

����������� Alice looked back at the
pager and, for the first time since her trials began, truly contemplated her
actions.

&nbsp;

����������� There was
just no way she could go through with it anymore.� In a fit of rage, she took the pager and
threw it into the street.� Alice watched in glee as
the cursed pager crunched under tire after tire.� Then, with a false sense of security, Alice turned away from
the park, never to return.

&nbsp;

����������� For hours, Alice wandered the city, a
false sense of triumph pervading her thoughts.�
She thought the solution to her problems was so simple, though she was
unaware of the dire price she would pay for denying her responsibilities.

&nbsp;

����������� At 9pm, Alice returned home.� That�s
strange, she thought, noting that the front light was off.� Normally her mother turned it on when she was
waiting for her daughters to come back.�
Stranger still was the locked front door.� Alice
fumbled around in the dark with her key and entered her home.

&nbsp;

����������� The horrors
she saw made her regret ever defying her blackmailers.

&nbsp;

����������� In the
middle of the room was her older, prudish sister Gertrude, forcibly mounted on
one of the men that Alice
had so painfully become familiar with over the last few weeks.� One of the rapist�s cohorts pushed down on
Gertrude�s shoulders, keeping impaled on the man�s cock. �Alice
could see that her sister was crying, covered in cum, and completely unable to
defend herself against the sexual attacks, her mouth and arms bound with reams
of packing tape.� Alice gasped in shock, immediately realizing
that this was the outcome of her defiance.�
She stumbled closer and closer to her sister, not realizing that another
one of the men closed the door behind her and bolted it shut.

����������� 

����������� Alice kneeled on the
ground and reached for her sister, her blue pleated skirt pulling and revealing
part of her smooth thighs.� �Big sis�
what have they done to you?�� Alice�s mourning over the
fate of her sister was interrupted by a garish scream from upstairs.� Realizing there the voice belonged to her mother, Alice
sprinted up the stairs, losing one of her shoes along the way.� 

&nbsp;

����������� Alice found her mother in
the master bedroom, her screams now muffled with a blue ball gag fastened
tightly around her head.� Her Japanese
style Kimono was open, revealing the leather straps that bound her arms to her
torso.� A large dildo was crammed painfully
into the mother�s cunt, causing the black-haired forty-five year
old to writhe around on the floor as she tried to shake it loose.� Tomoko stood above the woman, wearing her
trademark fur coat.

&nbsp;

����������� �Alice, I thought we had
an agreement?�

&nbsp;

����������� �How� how
could you do this?� My mother and sister
did nothing to deserve this?�

&nbsp;

����������� Tomoko
laughed at Alice.� �Haha, the men are
going to get their release, one way or another.�
If you aren�t there to help them, I guess your mother and sister will
have to suffice.�� Tomoko walked closer
to Alice as two
of her men flanked her.� With Alice�s newfound defiance,
she and her family would have to be sold to the same traders that had bought
that brat Corin.� The two girls would certainly be sold to a
brothel or private owner, and perhaps even the mother, though her advancing age
made it increasingly likely that she would just be sold for parts.

&nbsp;

����������� The grim
fates of her captives didn�t concern Tomoko, though.� She would be getting paid either way, and
until then�

&nbsp;

����������� It was
going to be a fun night.

Equal Trade

&nbsp;

�So I take it you understand the
terms of our business?�

&nbsp;

�Yes, I believe so. You guys make
it look like we�ve been a horrible accident where it is likely there would be unrecoverable
body, and you get to keep her in trade.� �Eric Johnson

&nbsp;

�That sums it up quite nicely.� Does anyone know that you both came here?�

&nbsp;

�Not at all.� I just told her I had a job interview downtown,
and since I don�t have my driver�s license yet, she had to drive me.� I memorized the directions from the email, then deleted it, so there�s no paper trail.�

&nbsp;

�Excellent.�� The businessman smiled at another transaction
well on the way to being finalized.� �Now, I just want to make one thing
clear.� After today, you will never be
able to see your mother again, and I assure you her fate will be most
unpleasant.� What makes you hate her
so?�� The businessman always asked a
question like this, to ensure that the justification for the trade was
strong.� Any weak answers would reveal
great risk that the client could reveal the deal to police.� Not like that mattered, though; the firm had
a �one location, one trade� policy.� The
client�s mother sat at what appeared to be the reception desk of �Wentler and Sons Law Associates�,
it was actually just a rented two room office, hastily decorated to allay
suspicions.

&nbsp;

Eric Johnson looked the businessman
in the eye and showed his burning hatred for the woman that raised him.� �That overprotective bitch has done nothing
but cripple my life.� I�m 19 years old
and she still won�t let me get my driver�s license.� Crushing curfews, strict
rules, and she�s never even home to cook a goddamn meal.� I know her law firm has a huge insurance
policy set up for her family, so she is honestly worth more to me �dead� than
she is alive.�

&nbsp;

The businessman could tell that
Eric�s hatred was true.� �Would you like
to say goodbye to your mother?�

&nbsp;

Eric thought for a moment.� �No.�
Just give that bitch my worst regards and make sure she knows that
everything you do to her is because she was such an overprotective cunt.�� Harsh words from a supposed love one.� The businessman liked that.

&nbsp;

�Now, let us just take care of the
product and we can get you on your way.�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Rachel Johnson sat in reception
area with her slender legs crossed below the knee. She had worn her usual
business attire of a tight knee-high skirt and fine silk blouse, one size too
small to accentuate her bust.� For a
moment, Rachel lamented the difficulties of single motherhood.� Six years ago, her husband Jacob died in a
car accident, leaving Rachel to raise their son alone.� Now, Eric was nearly a grown man, but the forty-year
old mother was still unable to let her son be a true individual.� The very thought of him driving a car
horrified her, bringing back painful memories of the accident that claimed her
husband�s life.

&nbsp;

Her fear had led her into the
current situation.� The desire to see her
only child succeed but the inability to accept her son�s independence left
Rachel Johnson with only one real option.�
Rachel was too caught up in her own fear to see that her son was slowly
starting to reach the breaking point, until finally he snapped.

&nbsp;

Today was the day Rachel Johnson
paid for her sins.

&nbsp;

Eric watched his mother in the
reception area via a small TV in the backroom.�
The agreement was finalized with nothing more than a handshake; any
paper trail here could prove to be disastrous. The plan was rather simple; the
businessman would arrange for a car accident off of Pacific Coast Highway.� Eric would walk away from the accident unscathed
in any severe manner, while his mother�s body would be presumed washed to sea,
never to be seen again.

&nbsp;

The reality, though, was much more
pleasing for the business.� Rachel
Johnson would be removed from her son�s life, permanently, while the business would
receive the rights to her body for years to come.� Both parties were thrilled with the
transaction, making it a truly equal trade.

&nbsp;

The two men nodded at each other,
and the businessman entered a code into his laptop.� Through the monitor, Eric could see a wispy
gas filling the reception area.� His
mother noticed the pervading and began to cough, not yet realizing the
resultant dulling of her senses.� She
stood up and dropped her magazine and purse as she made a made dash for the
front door, but it was remotely locked.�
She banged on the door, but her physical strength was already
sapped.� Weaker and weaker she grew,
until finally she slumped against the door and passed out.� With their victim subdued, the businessman pressed
another button, and the toxic gas cloud retreated from the room.

&nbsp;

�Thank you for your business,
Eric.� An associate will be with you
shortly to set up the accident.� I�ll be
taking the woman off your hand now.��
Eric smiled back at the businessman, knowing that, between his mother�s
life insurance and their accumulated wealth, he would never have to work
another day in his life. As far as he was concerned, he got the much better end
of the trade.

&nbsp;

The businessman, on the other hand,
thought he had received the better end of the deal.� Attractive women aren�t cheap, and car
accidents are easy to fake.� A quick
glance over the defenseless woman gave the businessman a good idea of her type.
�She was clearly a traditional tease,
wearing tight shirts and short skirts, but never putting out.� At the very least, she would need to be
broken of her sexually conservative nature, and the businessman knew exactly
where to start.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Several hours later, the effects of
the gas started to clear from Rachel Johnson�s mind.� She could tell she was somewhere she had
never been before, the combination of sounds and smells entirely unique in her
mind.� As she returned further and
further into full consciousness, she began to realize the horrors of her
situation.� To either side and across the
room, she could see naked women bound and ball gagged, hanging above and
against wall-mounted urinals.� The chill
wind Rachel felt across her flesh made her realize that she too was bound in
such a position.� A
closer look at the other women made Rachel realize what that smell was;
human cum, which caked each and every one of the women in the room. It dripped
from their mouths, tits, and cunts.� It
encrusted their thighs, and puddle on the floor.� These women were clearly used for nothing but
sex.

&nbsp;

�Nrrrrgggfffff�
moaned Rachel as she tried to free herself, but her bindings held.� As she struggled futilely, a man in a
business suit walked up to her.� 

&nbsp;

�Rachel Johnson, I have a message
from your son.�� Rachel perked up and
paid attention.� What were these monsters
doing to her son?� �He just wanted to let
you know that he is the one that did this to you, as payback for your insane
overprotective nature.�

&nbsp;

Rachel couldn�t believe what she
was hearing.� Eric� set her up?� How was that possible?� Her sense of betrayal was interrupted by the
now stripped man.� With one swift motion,
he shoved his erect penis into Rachel Johnson, former wife, former mother, and
former power lawyer.� She winced in pain
as she forcefully began her new life as a sexual toilet.

Bad End

Ending #6

Women of God

By Razor7826

&nbsp;

����������� �Mr. Wilson,
this is the last straw.� With Father
Crick on sabbatical, I finally have to chance to rid this academy of your
blight.�� Sister Mariana stared at the
problem student from across the head master�s desk, flanked to her right by Loraine
Klaut, senior girl�s prefect.� The two
women turned to each other and smiled, deeply satisfied that they had finally
nailed their nemesis. 

&nbsp;

One hour ago, Loraine ran into the
head master�s office with a huge grin on her face, digital camera in hand.� She was unusually excited as she relayed her
story to the temporary Head Mistress Mariana, who had been placed in charge of
the Righteous Hand
Academy while Father Crick was
visiting a mission in Brazil.� Sister Mariana had long wanted to kick Tom
Wilson�s pampered ass from the academy, but Father Crick practiced a far more forgiving brand of Christianity than the fire and
brimstone style that Mariana and Loraine followed.� No matter how severe Tom�s transgressions and
no matter how much Mariana pleaded with Father Crick, Tom was always given
another chance.

&nbsp;

But now Father Crick was gone, and Loraine
finally had truly damning evidence.� 

&nbsp;

The photos on Loraine�s digital
camera clearly showed Tom Wilson smoking a large blunt in the men�s bathroom on
the second floor.� Only the back of his
accomplice�s heads were shown, but it was obvious that they belonged to Alex
Wygriff and Zacharias Brown.� Loraine
knew that the photos would not be enough to reprimand those two, but Tom was as
good as gone.� Getting the leader of
heathen�s would be enough; without him, Alex and Zach would be completely
harmless.

&nbsp;

The Righteous Hand
 Academy, despite being a
Christian high school, was known as one of the best schools in the region.� As a result, the school halls were filled
with an interesting blend of Christian faith seekers and heathen brats.� Tom�s gang was the worst of them all, but
now, three weeks before graduation, she finally had the leverage to purge the troublesome
non-believers.

&nbsp;

Tom Wilson was ignoring pretty much
everything the women said, instead using his vast mental powers to imagine the
prudish women naked.� Both the eighteen
year old prefect and the twenty-seven year old nun were religious hardliners to
the extreme, quite uncommon among women their ages, but Tom loved imaging that
they loved the cock.� He knew that wasn�t
true, though; both were undoubtedly virgins, a huge loss to mankind.� Loraine was actually pretty damn hot in her
school uniform.� The tight grey coat and
ankle length skirt were designed to be very modest clothing, but the tight fit
made it clear that Loraine Klaut was packing a hot body.� Finishing the image of the pristine and
haughty bitch was her sculpted blond hair and thick rimmed glasses.

&nbsp;

Sister Mariana was potentially even
hotter, but her red habit hid her beauty.�
Regardless, Tom never failed to notice the moments when the robes
pressed back against her skin, revealing the curves of her unfortunately unused
body.

&nbsp;

�Mr. Wilson, are you even listening
to us?�� Tom snapped back into
reality.� �This is it, you�re being
expelled.�

&nbsp;

�But my father will kill me!�� Tom�s father was the CEO of a Fortune 500
company, and allowed little room for failure.

&nbsp;

Sister Mariana and Loraine smiled
at each other.� �You should have thought
of that before you brought the devil�s weed into this academy.�� Sister Mariana looked absolutely gleeful at
her chance to get rid of time, spurring a newfound burning hatred deep inside
of him.� Tom watched as Sister Mariana
updated his computer file with the transgression and punishment.� �Now, if you�ll both excuse me, I have a
previous appointment I must attend to.���
It was nearing 6pm on Friday night.

&nbsp;

Tom and Loraine left the head
master�s office, with Sister Mariana following close behind.� Down the hall, Tom could see Zach and Alex
waiting for him, barely in view.� Mariana
grabbed Tom�s arm and gave him a final warning, one that would prove to be the
impetus for the events which would destroy her life.� �Tell your little friends over there that
they are next.� None of you will graduate
as long as I am head mistress.�� Tom
shook away and gave the nun a gaze of pure loathing.� She smiled and turned away, returning to a
discussion of religious importance with her prized prefect.

&nbsp;

The gang was shocked to hear of
Tom�s expulsion and the imminent threat facing his friends.

&nbsp;

�I think your dad is going to
honestly kill you,� responded Zach.

&nbsp;

�We have to do something,� stated
Alex, fearful of his friends� fate as much as his own.� �Perhaps we can encourage Sister Mariana to
change her mind.�

&nbsp;

Alex turned to him and said, �How
the hell do you expect us to do that?�
She seems pretty intent on fucking us over.�

&nbsp;

�Hmm��� Tom was lost in thought.� �Alex, your father is out of the country for
four more months, right?� We could bring
that cunt there for a while to see if we can convince her otherwise.�

&nbsp;

Alex contemplated the offer.� �But what about Loraine?� If Mariana goes missing, that fucking bitch
will suspect us first!�

&nbsp;

�Well, that is why we take her, as
well.�� Tom was starting to fantasize
about what sort of persuasive techniques they could use against the
sister.� 

&nbsp;

�What happens if we don�t change
their minds?� Alex just seemed to be raining on all the good ideas.

&nbsp;

Tom looked at his friends sternly
and said, �Then we can come up with a more permanent solution, whatever that
may be.�

&nbsp;

Alex started to freak out.� �You�re not saying what I think you�re
saying.� You mean��� He finished the sentence by mouthing the
ultimate sin.

&nbsp;

�No, not
necessarily that.� That is just
one of several ways to silence people, but we don�t have to make that decision
for quite a while, as long as we can use your mansion.�

&nbsp;

Zach hopped on board with the idea,
but Alex did so reluctantly.� After a few
more minutes of prodding in those deserted school halls, Alex saw the light of
the plan, knowing full well that unless the problem was dealt with now, he
would be next to fall against Sister Mariana�s unchecked vengeance.

&nbsp;

����������� Tom laid
out the plan, and stated a final note �We have to do this NOW, tonight, before
either of them formalize the expulsion or tell anyone of their intent.�� The first step would be to find out where the
two women were at, a task which was not particularly difficult.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

����������� On the outskirts of the Righteous
 Hand Academy,
near the woods, rested a small chapel.�
At this hour on a Friday night, and with Father Crick away, the school
was deserted sans those previously mentioned.�
In the front pew of that small, secluded chapel knelt
Sister Mariana and Loraine Klaut, her star pupil.� If Loraine could continue to forego the
vulgar sins of modern life, she too could grow up to be a woman of God.� Together, the women prayed- for family, for
friends, for sinners, and for their own weaknesses. Neither woman thought they
were perfect, and God knew the sins that they had committed, but through faith
they believed absolution was possible.� 

&nbsp;

����������� The focus
of Mariana�s prayers was the absolution of her lust.� For her entire life, she had never fulfilled
her sexual desires, but lustful thoughts, too, were a sin.� Despite Father Crick recently having turned
forty years old, something about his presence made Mariana�s heart sing.� The highlight of her days, weeks, and months
were all the brief moments where she had light hearted discussions with Orson
Crick. Sister Mariana was in love with Father Crick, a simple fact that Mariana
tried to deny her spirit.� Nuns were
married to God, and were not allowed to love another man. Mariana prayed for
her sins and for the strength to overcome them.

&nbsp;

����������� Next to
her, Loraine prayed for her own sins.�
Three months ago, Loraine began exploring her body in ways forbidden by
the Christian faith.� For so long, she
had denied her sexual awakening, so the slightest stimulation to her erogenous
zones felt like the greatest thing in the world.� Every day in the shower, she would play with
herself, making her enjoy life, but every night she hated herself for her
weakness.� Loraine prayed for her sins
and the strength to overcome them. 

&nbsp;

Unfortunately, God�s favor would do
them no good.

&nbsp;

����������� Tom Wilson discreetly peeked into the
windows on the front doors and spied the sister and prefect performing rosaries
as they sat in the front pew.� The men
knew that, as long as the women were in the chapel, their plans could
wait.� Crimes always leave less evidence
when performed outside.� By the looks of
it, the women had quite a few beads left on the rosaries, and Tom was certain
neither would quit before the entire task was through.� That gave them quite a bit of time to get set
up.

&nbsp;

����������� By the time
the girls finished, there were only two cars left in the parking lot-� Alex�s van and
Sister Marian�s Volvo, parked near the rectory.�
As usual, the nun intended on giving Loraine a ride home to her waiting
parents, but Tom knew if he allowed that to happen, it would all be over.� The men parked the van out of sight around a
corner, to give the appearance that they had left the school.� 

&nbsp;

����������� Around 8pm,
the two women left the chapel and headed for the Volvo, though they did not make
it into the car.� Tom and Alex grabbed
them from behind, one arm around their torso and one hand across their
mouths.� Zach pulled up and slid the side
door of the van open, and the two women disappeared into the side, never to see
the outside world again.

&nbsp;

����������� Neither of
the women offered fruitful resistance, succumbing to the groping hands and
rolls of packing tape within minutes.�
Both were scared for what was to happen to them, but their faith in God
reassured them that things would turn out to be okay, even as Tom took
Mariana�s car keys to hide the one sign that would reveal their abduction.

&nbsp;

����������� Fifteen
minutes later, the Volvo and the van parked next to each other in the garage of
Alex�s secluded mansion.� The malicious
nun and the bitchy snob were dragged into the basement, where they were
immediately taped and bound to two chairs in the center of the private
theater.� Tom then started the
persuasion.

&nbsp;

����������� �I need
both of you to listen to me, and I need you to listen well.� We won�t allow you to expel me or my friends,
and we WILL do whatever is necessary to ensure that we graduate.� Now, before we resort to more drastic
measures, I�ll give you one last chance.�
Do you still plan on expelling me?��
He stared at the captives with a look of shear determination.� 

&nbsp;

����������� Sister
Mariana stared back, every bit as determined as he was.� �I am a woman of 

God, and I cannot ignore the sins
that you have committed, nor can I bear false witness and pretend that it never
happened.� Do what you must, but nothing
can overcome my beliefs.�

&nbsp;

����������� Beside
Mariana, Loraine was not as resolute in her faith, fearful of what these mere
boys would do to her.� She began to pray
for protection.

&nbsp;

����������� Tom tried
to pretend to be displeased with the women�s defiance, but it was clear that he
anticipated what he would have to do.� �I
guess you�ve left us with no choice.�
Zach, I think we�re going to have to keep them here for a while.� Want to run some errands for their stay with
us?�

&nbsp;

����������� �What do
you mean?�� Tom whispered a few items to
Zach, who was clearly shaken with the strange requests, but also a little
turned on.� �Okay, I�ll be back in a few
hours.� Don�t wait up for me.��� Zach left the garage in the van, leaving his
two friends to begin the problem solving process.� Both men agreed that Loraine should learn
here lesson first.

&nbsp;

����������� Tom quickly
undid the tape that kept Loraine in her chair while she continued to pray for
divine intervention.� Her quiet prays
were interrupted with heavy sighs and gasps as Tom and Alex fondled her
underneath her tight school uniform.� Her
body met all of Tom�s expectations and more, the tight coat and long grey skirt
clearly hiding a fantastic, and sadly unused, body.� But God�s gift to men would not go ignored
for much longer.

&nbsp;

����������� Alex gently
pushed Loraine to the ground, her arms still taped together behind her
back.� Tom rested on her thighs and took
another look at the snotty prefect.� She
was starting to cry now, tears flowing from beneath her black-rimmed glasses,
down her flawless white cheeks. Even in their sexual innocence, Loraine and
Sister Mariana knew what was going to happen next.� While the fear froze Loraine, Mariana went on
the defensive, attempting to free herself of her binds.� �I will not allow you to rape one of my
students.� Let us go, this instant, or
the consequences of your actions will be far worse than they already will be.�

&nbsp;

����������� �You�ve
already said you were going to expel us, so we have nothing to lose.�

&nbsp;

����������� �Then you
will never receive forgiveness in the eyes of God.�� Tom ignored Mariana�s rationalist warnings
and returned his attention to Loraine.�
He grabbed each side of her button down coat and tugged, spraying the
buttons across the basement, revealing Loraine�s clear white and
slightly-transparent undershirt.� Her
nice tits were covered with a black lace bra, a surprisingly risqu� for a girl
that wanted to be so pure.� Another tug
destroyed the undershirt.�� Her bra was
now exposed.� Tom grabbed each of her
tits in one of her hands and squeezed them, her only response being louder
sobs.

&nbsp;

���������� Alex stood
off to the side.� Until this moment, he
was unsure if he would be able to go through with the plan, but seeing Loraine
partially naked and in tears caused something to awaken inside of him. �While Tom worked over Loraine, Alex sat behind
Mariana and began groping his teacher and nun.

&nbsp;

����������� The nun
continued to protest as Alex fondled here, slowly beginning to remove her
clothing.� Meanwhile, Tom was slowly
eliciting the biological response from Loraine that he had hoped, despite her resistance.� He curled up her long grey skirt and tore off
her black panties.� 

&nbsp;

����������� �Please
God, Please God, Please God�� Loraine begged.�
No salvation came, and Tom quickly pulled down his pants and grabbed
each of her white thighs beneath his arms.�
She feared and loathed the prospect of being raped, but Tom�s thorough
manipulation of her body left her ready to accept him, and accept his cock she
did, losing the virginity that she intended to hold onto her whole life.� She continued to cry and pray for salvation
as Tom pounded away at her.

&nbsp;

����������� Nearby,
Alex had torn the Sister Mariana�s robes to shred, leaving her wearing nothing
but bulky white undergarments.� On the
verge of being raped, Mariana reflected on her life of repressed
sexuality.� 

&nbsp;

With the death of her mother on the
eve of her fourteenth birthday, the formerly cheerful Mariana began a long and
brooding phase of her life that until well after high school.� During those dark years, religion consumed an
increasingly large portion of Mariana�s life, part of coping with the loss of
her mother.� She wanted to believe that
her mother was still out there, regardless of the form.

&nbsp;

Along with religion came chastity
and a disdain for all things sexual.�
Once popular, the young Mariana became a social outsider, staring at the
culture of lust with contempt.� As
religion became more important and her social life became less so, Mariana knew
that she wanted to be a nun, just like the ones that had consoled her during
her time of loss.� The belief in her
righteous path never faltered, until she accepted her position at the Righteous Hand Academy
and met Father Crick.� The path that once
seemed so clear began to muddle as she grew closer and closer to the first
important man in her life.

&nbsp;

Now, none of it mattered.� The defiant Mariana finally broke down and
began to cry as Alex entered her, stealing the purity that had defined her
life.� Both Mariana and Loraine
experience a pain unlike anything they had felt before, and it was far from the
last time they would experience it.�
Soon, Zach returned, and the violations continued well into the night.

&nbsp;

When the men were too exhausted to
continue using the nun and prefect�s bodies, they got the �supplies� out of the
van.� The many items included months worth of birth control pills, freakish and bizarre
sex toys and bondage gear, and two padded dog cages.� The final symbolic act of capture was when
Tom locked dog collars around the necks of the two women and led their cum-encrusted
bodies into the dog cages.� The nun and
the prefect were left alone in the darkness.

&nbsp;

The two women sat in silence for
half an hour before Loraine broke it with painful screams.� �What did we do to deserve this, God?� Why?�
Why?� We were so faithful, but we
were both raped so horribly��
why have we been forsaken?�

&nbsp;

Mariana tried to think of an
answer, but could not, her own faith being tested by the horrors.� �God has a plan for us all, Loraine.� We will be free of this pain someday.�� She was wrong.

&nbsp;

Over the next several months, the
women had plenty of time to rest in their cages and contemplate the causes for
why such atrocities were being visited upon them.� Each of them blamed their own sexual and
lustful indiscretions for their fate, Loraine believing this was all God�s
punishment for masturbation, and Mariana thinking that it was divine
retribution for sexual thoughts of a priest.

&nbsp;

Over and over, for months and for
years, the nun and the prefect were used in formerly unimaginable ways.� Their insistence on the expulsion of Tom
Wilson ensured that they could never go free, and so, Sister Mariana and
Loraine Klaut were forced onto decidedly different career paths.� Instead of chaste servants of faith, they
would spend the rest of their days as unwilling sex toys, the forsaken women of
God.

A Lover Scorned

By Razor7826

&nbsp;

Kelly Hill knocked on the door of apartment 318B of
the Shaded Meadows apartment complex.� As
usual for these special days, the twenty-three year old lawyer wore a shawl to
cover her bobbed black hair, as well as sunglasses to cover her large green
eyes.� Specializing in family law
required that she keep much of her social life hidden from the public, most of
all her deviant sex life.

&nbsp;

The door opened, and a beautiful
woman in her thirties led Kelly into the apartment.� The older woman, Rachel Edwards, grabbed
Kelly in a strong hug against her sleek red dress and gave her a long and deep
kiss.� Kelly returned the affection.

&nbsp;

For the last three months, Kelly
and Rachel were in a secret relationship.�
While Kelly was out to her family and friends, her professional life
required secrecy with regards to her sexuality, for
word of her lesbianism could destroy her practice.

&nbsp;

Rachel Edwards was the perfect
woman for Kelly Hill, and the two women were quickly growing close to each
other.� She understood Kelly�s
professional situation, and was willing to keep their relationship quiet, as
long as she knew that Kelly�s heart belonged to her.� Not only were they growing more intimate, but
they both had a completely trusting giving sex life, each woman willing to do
whatever was necessary to please the other.

&nbsp;

Their recent encounters took a turn
to BDSM, with their current interests falling on sexual bindings.� Both women found it incredibly hot and
satisfying to bind the other woman�s limbs with bandages, then
fuck them with a strap on dildo.� 

&nbsp;

Rachel reached her hand out to
Kelly�s chin and grinned.� �Today is my
turn to tie you up, teehehe.�� She was
playful, as usual, and Kelly would be happy to oblige.� Both women grinned with anticipation as
Rachel led Kelly into her bedroom.

&nbsp;

That�s
strange, Kelly thought, as she noticed the room to Rachel�s other bedroom
was closed.� She dismissed the thought as
unimportant, and in the master bedroom she began the foreplay.� For today, Kelly took on a more submissive
roll, letting Rachel slowly disrobe her.�
Once she was fully naked, Rachel pushed her down onto the bed and began
the binding.� She bent each of her limbs
at the elbows and ankles, where Rachel was ready to encase them in layer upon
layer of cloth bandages.� By the time the
bindings were complete, Kelly looked like she had no hands or feet, the
bandages giving the impression that she was a quadruple amputee.� Rachel could see that Kelly was hot and
ready, but instead of pulling a dildo from her nightstand, she pulled out a
manila envelope.� 

&nbsp;

�Kelly, before we continue, I have
something important to ask you.�

&nbsp;

�What do you need, honey?�

&nbsp;

Rachel pulled photographs from the
envelope and held them in front of her girlfriend�s face.� The photographs clearly showed Kelly fucking
a man, and she looked like she was having the time of her life.� �Did you think I wouldn�t find out.�

&nbsp;

�I can explain... please� it was a
one time thing.�

&nbsp;

�That is also a lie. I have photos
of two separate occasions.�� The lie was
exposed.� Kelly had been seeing Mark, one
of her superiors at her law firm.� While
there were the career incentives the activities, Rachel was right- she did
enjoy the sex.

&nbsp;

�I� I love you, Rachel.� Mark doesn�t change that.�

&nbsp;

�Fuck you, you lying bitch!� Whatever the hell you are, you�re not a
lesbian, and you�ll fucking pay for leading me on like
this.�� Rachel was furious, but she also
began to cry, the pain of Kelly�s infidelities clearly tearing at her
soul.� The older woman reached into her
night stand and pulled out a ball gag, which she quickly fastened around
Kelly�s head.� Kelly tried to resist, but
it was no use, the bindings leaving her completely helpless against a woman
that just moments ago she had placed her complete trust in.

&nbsp;

With her former girlfriend bound
and gagged, Rachel left the room and Kelly�s line of sight.� Kelly could hear voices outside, and a few
moments later Rachel returned with two unfamiliar, naked, men behind her.� �Alex, Zach... do
whatever you want with her, I don�t care.��
Rachel left the room, and the two white men approached the defenseless
captive.� She tried to bat them off were
her stub limbs, but her attempts proved useless as each of the men grabbed two
of her stumps and held her in the air.�
The positioning of her legs gave no defenses as the men shoved their
stiff penises into her asshole and pussy.�
Never before had she been double penetrated, and the pain was almost
unbearable.� She screamed and screamed
into the gag as the men raped her repeatedly, but her muffled moans drew no
saviors.

&nbsp;

Later that night, the two men
finally tired of the prone, cum covered sex toy. Rachel returned to the room
and looked over her former girlfriend, still unsatisfied with the punishment
visited upon her. ��Get that fucking
bitch out of my sight.� You guys can keep
her.�

&nbsp;

Alex turned to Rachel, �You know
what we�ll end up doing to her� right?�

&nbsp;

����������� Rachel knew
exactly what they would do.� �Yes, I am
aware.� I want that bitch to suffer for a
long, long time.� Take her car,
too.�� Alex got dressed and went out to
his van, and returned with a large tote bag.�
With some help from Rachel and Zach, he managed to fit Kelly into the
bag, which he zipped up almost all the way, showing some concern for her
breathing.� Rachel barely gave it a
thought as the men carried Kelly Hill out of her life, the anger over her
infidelity still tearing at her mind.

����������� Over the
following weeks and months, Rachel Edwards had brief moments where she
regretted giving Kelly away to be sold as a sex slave.� Finally, she saved and approached her
friends, asking if she could do anything to get her friend and lover back,
realizing that Kelly truly was special to her.�
Unfortunately, her friends told her it was too late, that no records of
any kind were kept beyond the first buyer.

&nbsp;

Sister
of Two

By
Razor7826

&nbsp;

��������� With tears in her eyes, Juliette
Cummings pled with Dr. Klaut.� �Is there any alternative?� Please, you have to help us out, doctor.� Please��� Juliette trailed off and began to cry.� Klaut shrugged in
dismay, at a total loss with how to console the sobbing twenty-two year old
woman.

&nbsp;

��������� �I�m sorry, I truly am, but Terrance�s
cancer is too far advanced for chemotherapy to work.� This surgery is the best option, and it needs
to be done soon.�� It wasn�t that the doctor
enjoyed telling her that her little brother was as good as dead, but he did
have a bit of a thing for crying women.�
Phillip Klaut felt himself starting to smile,
but suppressed his sadistic glee before Juliette noticed, her vision still
muddled with tears.� 

&nbsp;

��������� �Suzie�s condition has already wiped
out our inheritance!� There�s no way we
can afford the surgery��� How could things have gone so wrong for us? Six
months ago, the parents of Juliette, Susan, and Terrance Cummings were killed
in a bus bombing during a trip to Israel, leaving Juliette in charge
of the twin siblings, ten years her junior.�
Juliette sacrificed everything for her family, both dropping out of
medical school and breaking up with her boyfriend, Tony.� Tony did everything he could to help the
Cummings, but Juliette was simply too damaged by the loss of her family and her
newfound role as guardian.

&nbsp;

��������� Then came the
double blows of Suzie�s weak heart and Terrance�s cancer.� Before Juliette realized how dire things
were, the money was gone, leaving the college drop-out struggling against
mounting bills.

&nbsp;

��������� Now, after a month of chemotherapy,
Terrance�s cancer had only spread further, his only hope an expensive and risky
surgery.

&nbsp;

��������� The risk didn�t even matter; without a
quick flow of cash, Terrance and Suzie would be dead with in months.� Juliette continued to cry as Dr. Klaut suppressed his smiles.

&nbsp;

��������� �I�m sorry Juliette, but Terrance
needs the surgery.� I�d recommend you do
whatever you can to gather the funds, quickly.��
That�s it, Phillip, salt the
wounds, exaggerate the problem.� This
girl would be a perfect candidate for the club.�
All I have to do is bait her along, and we can con her into giving us a
show.� �Now if you�ll excuse me,
Juliette, I have other patients waiting.��
Phillip walked out of the examination room and into his office, making
sure that the door was locked behind him.�
From his lower right hand drawer, he pulled out a slim black disposable cellphone and called the number he was told to commit to
memory.� �I think I have another girl we
can use...�

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

��������� 

��������� One hour later, Juliette waved goodbye
to her little brother in front of Parker
 Brown Elementary
  School.�
�Bye, big sis!��� Terrance was all
smiles, unaware that he would be dead within months.� Juliette waved back at him, turned away, and
renewed her sobbing.� She had told him
that everything would be good after the chemo, and she couldn�t bear to tell
him that he was going to die.

&nbsp;

��������� There�s
still hope.� Maybe I can get a loan.

&nbsp;

��������� An afternoon full of bank visits
crushed that glimmer of hope.� Two
bounced checks was enough to seal the fate of her and
her siblings.� Crushed and dispirited,
Juliette wandered around the financial district, pleading with every bank
imaginable, the answer always a no.� Little did she know, there was still somebody
out that would tell her everything she wanted to hear.

&nbsp;

��������� Exhausted, Juliette made her way
through the parking garage to her beater of a car, her long red hair standing
out in the darkness.� Her hair was
everything Jon needed to identify her from his Lexus.� That�s
her, all right.� Time
to lay the bait.� The
thirty-seven year old lawyer opened his car door and silently stalked the
club�s unknowing prey.� As the red-head
fumbled with her car keys, Jon finally laid the trap.

&nbsp;

��������� �Juliette Cummings, I have a way for
you to get the money that you need.��
Juliette froze for a moment, then began to
think about what the man was saying.� She
slowly turned around, leaving her keys in the door.

&nbsp;

��������� �What do I have to do to save my
brother and sister?� I�ll do anything you
ask.� Please, tell me!�

&nbsp;

��������� Jon knew that Phillips judgment was
spot on; this na�ve young woman was the perfect candidate for the games.� �My name is Edward Kingsley, and I represent
a certain� entertainment venue� that we need to keep underground for legal
purposes.� Now, I don�t mean to offend
your suburban sensibilities, but the games we play there involve a little bit
of wrestling, a little bit of gambling, and a little bit of nudity.� I need to be sure you are a woman of your
word before we discuss these things any further.�

&nbsp;

��������� Juliette gave but a moment of
consideration before responding with an enthusiastic �Yes, I can keep quiet
about this.�� She knew where this was
heading- naked lesbian wresting- but it didn�t bother her.

&nbsp;

��������� �You�ll be playing a little bit of
strip-wrestling against women just like you.�
Ten thousand dollars per match, and five times that if you manage to
win.� If you are still interested, come
to this address alone tomorrow night at ten, and somebody will arrive to pick
you up.�� Jon handed Juliette a business
card, which listed a small club on the outskirts of town.� �Don�t tell anyone where you are going.� We need to keep this little operation under
wraps, and if we even suspect that you�ve told anyone, the deals off.�� Jon left out a few important details, but as
long as Juliette kept quiet, none of it mattered.

��������� Juliette put the business card in her
purse, but before she could thank �Edward� for the opportunity, he was gone.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

��������� The next night, Juliette tucked her siblings
in at nine o�clock, the went to her bedroom to
change.� Anticipating a simple wrestling
match, she dressed in clothes that would put her at the least
disadvantage.� A simple tube-top and
tight denim jeans would give her opponent little to grasp, and the lack of
jewelry would ensure that there were no dirty tricks.� On her way out, Juliette looked at her
siblings and smiled, then quietly slipped out the front door.� I�ll be
back before they even know I�m gone, she thought to herself.� I�m
young and in the best condition of my life.�
A few nights of winning and everything will be taken care of.� She drove to the given location, still
with a smile on her face, a sign of the newfound hope that fueled her
body.� Things were finally starting to
look up for the first time since she dropped out of medical school.

&nbsp;

��������� The parking lot at the address was
empty.� Strange.� ��Juliette opened her car door, climbed out,
then looked around.� No more than ten
seconds later, a black limo pulled up right next to her.� One of the tinted windows rolled down and a
gray haired gentleman in a tailored suit looked Juliette over.� �I take it you are Miss Juliette
Cummings?� Come on in, we have quite the
crowd waiting for your match.�� The man
opened the door, and Juliette stepped into the limo.� �May I ask that you turn off your cellphone?� We prefer
that nobody be able to track our location.�

&nbsp;

��������� �Sure thing.�� Juliette turned off her cellphone,
not thinking about the absurdity of the request.

&nbsp;

��������� So
na�ve... I�m going to love the look on her face when she realizes what she�s
gotten herself into.� Wonderful body� I
hear she�s smart, too.� Makes things much hotter.

&nbsp;

��������� Juliette paid no attention to
the car�s surroundings as it wove it�s way through the
outskirts of town, expecting her to just be safely dropped off at her car once
the match was over.� Her expectations
blinded her to the suspicious designs and d�cor of the venue.� An elevator warehouse brought her down twenty
floors to a long hallway.� Doors lined
the sides, and at the end of hallway she could see thick double doors.� Men and woman of all ages and races walked in
and out of the doors, and, based on their clothing, Juliette could see that
they were all rather wealthy. 

&nbsp;

��������� �You�ll be going straight into the
ring, as we�re a bit behind schedule.�

&nbsp;

��������� �What are the rules, exactly?�

&nbsp;

��������� �You�ll hear those in the ring.�� You�ll
also be quite surprised by them.� �Now
just hurry through those double doors up ahead and the MC will start the match.

&nbsp;

��������� By now, Juliette was at least starting
to get slightly suspicious.� Her handler
was being exceptionally vague about everything, but she was willing to put up
with far more for the money she was getting paid.� The doors opened up as she approached them,
and the twenty-four year old walked through into the arena.� All around her were darkened panels of a
geodesic dome enclosing a small wrestling arena.� Near the door opposite Juliette was another
woman about the same age, wearing a long dinner dress and short, bobbed black
hair.� She looked worried about
something.

&nbsp;

��������� Once Juliette was completely through
the door, it slammed shut and locked.� Why do they need to lock the door?� The raspy voice of the announcer came
through the speakers and answered her question.

&nbsp;

��������� �Ladies and Gentlemen, our main event
is about to begin. Tonight, we have two sweet and innocent first timers, each fighting
for money and freedom! In the blue corner, Misses Kim Lane, twenty-three year old
law school student, hoping to repay all those student
loans.� In the red
corner, Misses Juliette Cummings, fighting for the survival of her two younger
siblings.� Both of these women
have their eye on the fifty thousand dollar prize, though neither has been told
what happens if they lose.� To ensure the
brutality that you all love, we have to let these two hot young ladies the truth.�
Not only is money on the line, but so is their freedom!�

&nbsp;

��������� Juliette looked up, as did her
opponent.� What does he mean our freedom?

&nbsp;

��������� The announcer continued,
sadistic glee evident in his voice.�
�Only the winner will leave this arena, while the loser gets to spend
the rest of her life servicing our perverted clientele!� So go at it, our little sweeties!� The loser is the first to go limp, no other
rules, at all!�

&nbsp;

��������� Both combatants turned back towards
their respective doors and tried with all their might to break free, but to no
avail.� Juliette continued to pound and
the door and scream for help.� �Let me
go!� You lied to me!� I don�t want to do this anymore?�� Her pleas were met with silence from all
around.

&nbsp;

��������� On the other end of the ring, Kim had
realized that she didn�t have a choice.�
Even if this Juliette woman had a better reason to fight for the money,
the punishment for losing was too great to accept.� She would kill Juliette if she had to, and
the longer the red-head spent pounding on the door, the better the chances of
Kim surprising her.� The lawyer removed
her high-heels and began to run towards Juliette, who was still clawing against
the door, trying to break free.

&nbsp;

��������� �Please!� My brother and sister need me or they�ll
die!� I can�t stay her� no� no��� Juliette slid down onto her knees and burst
into tears.� All she wanted to do was
save her family, but now she was participating the
sadistic games of wealthy perverts.� Why is this happening to me?

&nbsp;

��������� Her sorrows were interrupted as
Kim tackled her to the floor and began slapping her in the face.� The fight for freedom had begun.

&nbsp;

��������� �You bitch!�� Juliettte began to
fight back with her tiny clenched fists, landing one good blow to the side of
Kim�s head, causing her to loosen her grip in Juliette�s arms.�� Juliette pounced on the opportunity and
pulled a reversal, now on top of Kim pinning her arms to her sides.� Juliette was a bit meatier than the lithe
Kim, so the she had Kim immobilized.� Now
the problem was how to actually win the fight.�
All of Juliette�s limbs were in use restraining Kim, but there was no
way to knock her out.

&nbsp;

��������� �UNrrggghhhhhhhhhhh!�� Kim tried to free herself, but her skinny
arms and legs were too weak to break Juliette�s hold.� There was only way way
for her to free herself.� Surging her
head upwards, she landed a crushing headbutt to
Juliette�s nose, forcing the red-head to stumble backwards, clenching her nose
in pain.� 

&nbsp;

��������� �Ahhh,
my nose!� I think it�s broken!�
screamed Juliette, forgetting the higher stakes that were on the line in this
game for one fatal moment.� Kim pounced
on the moment of Juliette�s distraction to force her into a choke hold from
behind, one arm around her forehead, the other around her neck.� Before Juliette even understoodd
the predicament, the pressure that would lose her the fight was being applied
to her carotid artery.� Her vision
started to blur, fields of black interceding her vision.� She knew the end was near, but memories of
her family gave her a second wind in a last ditch effort to triumph over Kim
and save her young brother and sister.

&nbsp;

��������� It was too late, however, the strength
already robbed from her limbs as she weakly pounded on Kim�s heid with her flailing arms.

&nbsp;

��������� She failed her family, and she failed
herself.� For who knows how long,
Juliette flickered through states of being barely conscious.� She could barely make out the sounds of the
announcer, then felt Kim loosen the chokehold. Juliette could see Kim exit from
a side door, and a group of men wearing leather masks entered the arena in her
place.� A wave of terror overcame her as
she could see that each man was naked except for small loincloths that were
doing very poor jobs of constraining their stiffening cocks.

&nbsp;

��������� Oh
my god oh my god, they�re going to rape me!�
You can get out of this if you try hard enough.� Now, move!� Juliette flopped around and tried to crawl
away, but her strength was still robbed by the long choke hold. As the men
stumbled closer and closer, more and more of Juliette�s strength returned,
until, at last, she stumbled up onto her feet and ran forward, making only a
few steps before she was finally overtaken.�
The burly men took no time at all to snap and lock leather cuffs to her
wrists and ankles, and a spider-gag into her mouth.� 

&nbsp;

��������� �eeeehhe
ettt eeee� gooooooooo! Eeee�.�� Juliette plead for her salvation, but her gagged mumblings brought
nothing but laughter from her assailants.�
Four pairs of grasping handss began to firmly
fondle her body, slowly weaseling their way down her tubetop
and tight pants.��� The groping hands
probed her body, pinched her nipples, and squeezed her tits, all while she
flailed around in their grasp, knowing that the end was near but struggling for
freedom no matter how slight the odds.� 

&nbsp;

��������� A new wave of fear overcame her as the
masked men tore free her tubetop and wrestled off her
pants, leaving her only in her plain white panties, which lasted no more than
three seconds and quick tug from even the scrawniest of her rapists-to-be.� In one swift motion, the largest of the man
rammed his cock into Juliette, her round tits swaying with the impact.

&nbsp;

��������� Juliette�s cries echoed through the
domed arena, and in a moment of clarity amid her horror, she realized the
nature of the arena.� Behind each of
those black panels of glass that comprised the dome was some wealthy spectator
in a private booth, so amorally twisted that they would pay untold sums of cash
to watch the kidnap and rape of pure innocent women, just like Juliette. In all
likelihood, the kidnappings had been going on for years, and would continue to
do so until a victor like Kim told the truth to the world.

&nbsp;

��������� Unfortunately, that was not meant to
be.� Behind the arena door, Kim consulted
with the same man that had approached her on the way home from work three days
ago.� She collected her cash and began to
make her way out of the arena, thrilled that she would be able to repay her
loans.� 

&nbsp;

��������� Sadly for her, the announcers
promise of freedom had been but a carrot on a stick, mere bait to ensure the
woman gave the brutal fights the clientele loved paid for.� Out of site from the main audience but
recorded by hidden cameras from many angles, Kim Lane befell the same terrible fate
that Juliette was suffering outside, her screams muffled by the thick metal doors.

&nbsp;

��������� Back in the arena, Juliette was
experiencing a new world of pain that she had hardly imagined.� Echoes of flesh slapping across her ass and
face filled the arena as the masked men pounded all of her holes.� Long drained of energy, Juliette merely let
her arms and legs hang to her sides limply, the men triple teaming her as she
laid down, impaled on one of their members.�
For hours, her assault never ended, the men clearly fueled by drugs to
keep them going and going after they dumped their wretched seed into her.

&nbsp;

��������� Oh
God, why is this happening to me?�
Why?� Please� watch out for my
brother and sister.� The rancid taste
in her mouth and the splitting pain in her ass and cunt damaged not only her
body, but her mind, slowly twisting her into accepting that this was her life
now; she would never see her dear siblings again, leaving them all alone in the
world.

&nbsp;

��������� Finally, the men stopped raping
Juliette and dumped her onto the ground with a thud.� �Ughhh��� Juliette writhed on the floor in agony, her
entire body sore and overflowing with cum.�
Once again, she broke down into tears from both the pain and
sorrow.� Her stomach began to rumble,
uneasily filled with the seed of her rapists.�
�*cough* *cough*� It was starting to come up, and finally, Juliette spat
forth a mouthful of cum which oozed off the sides of her face, down her cheeks,
and into her red hair.� The men returned
a few minutes later with a hose and began to rinse Juliette down, making sure
to shove the head into each of her holes to fully clean her out.� At
least I won�t get pregnant, though these monsters probably already had a plan
for that.

&nbsp;

��������� Once the new slave was rinsed
clean, one of the men snapped her wrist and ankle cuffs together behind her
back, leaving her virtually hogtied.� He
then picked up the dripping Juliette over his shoulder and carried her out of
the arena, where a serving cart was waiting.�
The man slammed Juliette down onto the metallic cart and walked away,
knowing that their newest fucktoy was in no position
to escape.� 

&nbsp;

��������� Within a minute, an Asian woman in a
red dress took control of the metallic cart and led it towards an
elevator.� Once the two were alone in the
elevator, the woman addressed Juliette.�
�Things are just getting started for you.� I�ve helped hundreds of women into their new
role, and I can tell that you are going to be quiet popular here, especially
once people start hearing your little sob story.� Our clients love despair, and they are sure to get a nice kick out of the fact
that your failure here tonight will lead to the deaths of your sweet little
brother and sister.�

&nbsp;

��������� �ooo
cunt!�� Juliette began thrashing around
on top of the serving cart, but in her bound state, the woman easily got her
under control.� 

&nbsp;

��������� �We have a little gift for you.� A little memento so your clients will know
who you are how you failed.�� The woman
attached a thick leather collar around Juliette�s neck and padlocked it shut in
the back.� A small dog tag hung from the
front, and the Asian woman bent over and read the inscription to Juliette.

&nbsp;

Juliette

Sister of Two

Fought for their lives, and failed.

&nbsp;


��������� The doors of the elevator opened
up, and the woman pushed the cart down the hall with a smile on her face as
Juliette continued to cry.� Through her
tear blurred vision, she could see a row of doors on her right side, guessing
that the doors led to the private rooms for those sick and twisted clients that
watched her fight and rape.� At the third
door, the woman knocked and said �Room service!�

&nbsp;

��������� The door opened up, and three women
answered the door.� The asian woman pushed the cart into
the room and left Juliette to her fate.

&nbsp;

��������� In the darkness, she could see the
three young women, no older than twenty, put on strap on dildos.� She let loose a yelp as she was brutally
yanked from the cart, and her assault began over again.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bad End #9
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Unwanted Daughter
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;By Razor7826
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Damnit, still no ransom.&nbsp; Maybe we should start sending parts of her back to her father.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Her dazed stupor dissipated in an instant.&nbsp; From her fetal position on the basement floor, she looked at George and I with a desperate smile and tears welling up in her eyes.&nbsp; �Do� don&#8217;t do that, guys.&nbsp; You love me just as I am, right?�&nbsp; She uncurled her legs from against her chest and kneeled, spreading them and arching her back to remind us of why we kidnapped her.&nbsp; �You know that I&#8217;d do anything for you.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;George laughed.&nbsp; �You&#8217;ve gotta work on your sales pitch, honey.&nbsp; You&#8217;re not just some hooker trying to get some cash.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I&#8217;ll never forget that expression.&nbsp; She looked so taken aback, her mouth slightly open and slack jawed, as if she couldn&#8217;t even begin to comprehend what George found funny in her torment.&nbsp; However, she shook off the puzzlement and slid both of her hands down to her snatch.&nbsp; She pressed her palms against its sides and pulled, spreading her cunt open.&nbsp; �Is this a better sales pitch?� she asked, her voice emulating confidence but noticeably shaky. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I smirked.&nbsp; �Sorry, but we&#8217;re in this for the money, and you&#8217;re not nearly talented enough to forego payment.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She began to sweat.&nbsp; �I� I&#8217;ll try harder, I promise!�&nbsp; Our eyes met as tears welled up in her eyes.&nbsp; �Please, give me another chance?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I don&#8217;t know��

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Please, sir?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Haha, I love it when you call me sir.&nbsp; Come on, George, let&#8217;s give her another chance.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He shrugged.&nbsp; �Fine,� he said, �but she better be worth it.&nbsp; I&#8217;m beginning to think that Mr. Andrews doesn&#8217;t care about his oldest daughter.&nbsp; Maybe he thinks she&#8217;s replaceable��

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She hesitated at his words, but did an admirable job presenting a fa�ade of strength, despite her circumstances.&nbsp; Less than two weeks ago she was a seemingly happy college student in her first semester away from home.&nbsp; However, George used his job at the student health center to spy on her, and, lo and behold, little miss Valedictorian was a nervous mess that spent every single moment worrying about something, be it grades or peer acceptance.&nbsp; The latter neurosis would prove to be a great help for her new life.

We both stripped and took our spots in the bean bag chairs I had brought down to the basement.&nbsp; She accepted my cock in her mouth and sucked like a vacuum cleaner while working its base with her right hand, while at the same time vigorously jerking off George, just as we had trained her to do.

�Damnit, Erin, you&#8217;re getting good at hand jobs,� blurted out George.

My eyes darted to his, but he just smiled.&nbsp; What an ass.&nbsp; I hoped that the girl didn&#8217;t hear his reckless praise, lest it undo what we had strived for.&nbsp; I pushed her head down further onto my cock and coaxed, �suck it harder.�

On command, her sucking and tongue work went from a three to a five, bringing me to a quick orgasm.&nbsp; She pulled back and I could see the cum dribbling from her mouth.&nbsp; I could tell that she hated the taste, her eyes squinting in disgust.&nbsp; She turned towards the drain to spit.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Hey, hey, I want you to swallow this time.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Uh?� she asked, the translucent white fluid pooling in her mouth.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I said, &#8216;swallow.&#8217;�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She looked at me with that puppy-dog look in her eyes, then closed her mouth and gulped. �Did I do good?� she asked, a meager smile creeping across her face.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I could tell she didn&#8217;t enjoy it the slightest bit, but she was trying to please me, and to a face like that, how could I say no?&nbsp; �You did good, Erin.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Thank you, sir.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;George and I dressed and motioned to leave the basement chamber.&nbsp;&nbsp; However, just before I left, she spoke.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Could you please ask my father for ransom again?&nbsp; I� I know he has the money.&nbsp; I&#8217;ve seen his bank account.&nbsp; Please, please, I know he&#8217;ll pay.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Something about her naivet� made my heart sing.&nbsp; There she kneeled, a nineteen year old, intelligent, red-headed beauty that was ready and willing to do anything I asked.&nbsp; Perhaps, if George and I had not walked down this path, things could be different between us.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Sure thing.&nbsp; He&#8217;ll answer, eventually.&nbsp; I&#8217;m sure the payment is coming any day now.&nbsp; Could even be tomorrow, sweat pea,� I lied as I exited the basement and turned off the light.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There would never be a ransom because we never asked for one.&nbsp; She would be mine until I saw fit for her disposal, and, until then, may she live her life believing she is an unwanted and unloved piece of trash.&nbsp; That&#8217;s not true, of course.&nbsp; Not in the least.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That was a huge mistake, puta.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Excuse me?� I asked, shocked by the young punk&#8217;s gall.&nbsp; I never imagined that a lowly piece of trash like him would prove to be so right.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Puta,� accentuated the low-life thug besides me.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The bartender leaned forward, supporting himself against the bar with his built and hairy arms.&nbsp; �Don&#8217;t treat my customers like that.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Go to hell, jag-off,� hissed the gang banger.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Okay, that&#8217;s it.&nbsp; Get the hell out of here before I call the cops.�&nbsp; The bartender pointed to the door.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The thug raised his hands in the air and yelled to the entire bar, �Fuck you, asshole, and fuck you, you dumb cunt.&nbsp; You have no idea what you&#8217;re missing out on.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I glanced down at the bulge in his pants, and exclaimed to the bar, �Not much by the looks of it.�&nbsp; Childish calls erupted from the crowd.&nbsp; Score one for Elaine Vesuvia.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He raised his hand threateningly, but lowered it as one of the bartenders put himself between us.&nbsp; �Fine, fine, we&#8217;ll go.&nbsp; Bitch, you have no idea what kind of mistake you made.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I turned back to the bar and finished the drink he had bought me, not even paying attention as they stormed noisily from the bar.&nbsp; Stupid men were always hitting on me at these filthy city bars, but these drunken evenings had brought me enough worthwhile one-night stands to justify my continued patronage.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Sorry for the trouble, Miss,� apologized the bartender. He returned to his side of the counter and pulled out the vodka and cranberry juice.&nbsp; �Have a few on my house.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I smiled flatteringly, batting my eye lashes and giving him a nice toothy smile. �Thank you.&nbsp; I love chivalry in my men.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He laughed as he poured me another drink.&nbsp; �No problem, ma&#8217;am.&nbsp; That&#8217;s half of what this job is.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I feigned laughter.&nbsp; His jokes weren&#8217;t nearly as great as his body, but it was getting late.&nbsp; If I didn&#8217;t act soon, I&#8217;d be alone for the twenty-second night in a row.&nbsp; �I don&#8217;t like dirty men like that.�&nbsp; I leaned closer on my stool.&nbsp; �Are you dirty?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He grinned and responded, �Dirtier than you think.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Not quite the answer was hoping for, but I bit, carrying on the little game until closing time.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�So, you interested in coming to my place for a few drinks after closing?� I asked, thrusting my chest out as bait.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No, no, you have the wrong idea.&nbsp; I have plans with my boyfriend over there.�&nbsp; He gestured with his head towards the far corner.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I turned my head to see a hefty, bearded white guy sitting alone in a booth, pouring himself a glass of red wine.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Wait, what?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Sorry if I misled you.&nbsp; I was just trying to be friendly with a customer.�&nbsp; He seemed genuinely apologetic, but I was too damn embarrassed.&nbsp; I threw out two twenties onto the bar, grabbed my purse, and made a direct line for the door.&nbsp; That wasn&#8217;t the first night I spent hitting on a gay guy, but that didn&#8217;t make it any less shameful.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The cold air of the city street hit me like a bucket of water and snapped me back to my senses.&nbsp; How much had I drunk?&nbsp; Seven glasses?&nbsp; Eight?&nbsp; More, probably.&nbsp; Regardless, I was only two blocks from my apartment and close enough to walk.&nbsp; Crime was rarely an issue in this part of town.&nbsp; I pulled my coat tighter and stumbled along the sidewalk.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Half a block away, my stomach started to rumble.&nbsp; Too much alcohol, yet again.&nbsp; I turned to the gutter just in time to purge the bar food and booze that had been my only sustenance of the evening.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Awwww, look at the snooty cunt puke up her liquor.�&nbsp;&nbsp; A chorus of laughter erupted behind me.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I recognized the voice.&nbsp; It was the same sleazy banger that had hit on me in the bar.&nbsp; I turned.&nbsp; �I thought I told you to go away?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�We did, we did, honey, but that queer ain&#8217;t here to protect you no more.�&nbsp; He stepped out of the darkness of the alley while his friends lingered to the sides.&nbsp; �Looks like you&#8217;re wasting that drink I bought you.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Still not interested,� I said, looking down the street.&nbsp; It was empty.&nbsp; I wiped my lip with my sleeve and started walking towards the corner deli.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Hey, were not done talkin&#8217;.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I ignored him and picked up the pace, but my escape was halted when a hand grasped my arm, pulling me backwards.&nbsp; �Hel�� I began to scream, but another hand covered my mouth as another man flanked my side, pulling me into the darkness of the alley.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The goon held me tightly, both arms squeezed beneath my lower chest, pinning my arms to my sides, while another forced his hand against my mouth, muting my now persistent screams.&nbsp; Together, they carried me deeper into the alley and around a corner until I was face to face with the same crimson-bandana wearing hooligan from the bar.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He walked up to me and leaned closer.&nbsp; I could smell the alcohol on his breath.&nbsp; �I told you what a mistake it was to turn me down.&nbsp; You could have spent an evening riding El Grande Perro, but instead you had to be a high-and mighty cunt.�&nbsp; He slid his hand up my short black skirt and groped me.&nbsp; �Consent only matters when there are people around that actually care.�&nbsp; He squeezed my crotch hard, making me cringe.&nbsp; �Tape her up.&nbsp; She&#8217;ll regret the day she crossed me for the rest of her life.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;One of his lackeys began to tear off some packing tape.&nbsp; The first piece landed squarely across my lips, ensuring that the rest of my cries for help would remain silent, regardless of how pained they were.&nbsp; I could only stare helplessly as he wrapped the tape in layers around my torso, binding my arms to my sides.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The brute that held me kneeled on the ground and slid his hands down to my thighs.&nbsp; He grabbed the hem of my skirt and pulled, revealing my black panties to his four friends.&nbsp; They bickered among themselves until the shortest member kneeled down between my spread legs.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll never forget his sadistic grin as he stared at me, not as a person, but as an object of pleasure

He pulled a switch blade from his pocket and sprung it open.&nbsp; With two swift motions, he slashed through the front of my crimson red turtle neck and black lace bra, exposing my 36C tits to the cold night air.&nbsp; My panties were next, clipped on each side so the center unfolded onto the dirty alley floor.

From there, everything went downhill.&nbsp; He unzipped his pants, flapped out his cock, and rammed it into me, his friend leaning backwards so my pussy was readily exposed.&nbsp; 

Pain wracked my body with each thrust as I was slammed onto his cock in rhythm.&nbsp; Weakened by the alcohol and severely outmatched, I could do nothing but experience their darkest desires.&nbsp; Back and forth, he thrust into and impaled my dry hole.&nbsp; I&#8217;d never been fucked so hard, nor was I ready for the man beneath me to unzip his pants and join in.&nbsp; Sandwiched between the two men, doubly violated, I thought I was going to die.&nbsp; The other two gang members laughed at my screams and tears as they cheered on their friends.&nbsp; Their impunity hardened the fact that they were on their home turf--&nbsp; nobody would come to save me, no matter how close to home I was.

When the man on top came inside me, all I could think about was getting pregnant, but those fears slipped to the back of my mind as his place was taken by another� and another, and another, the four scumbags rotating the use of my holes.

Through the early hours of the morning, those filthy gang banging lowlifes owned my body and took sadistic pleasure in abusing me.&nbsp; They all came in me, and on me, until all I could smell was the warm, putrid scent of their filthy spunk as it covered my bruised tits and nipples.

Beaten and battered, they threw my cum-covered body into the dumpster.&nbsp; I fought against them with all my might, but they just laughed.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Dumb bitch.&nbsp; Shouldn&#8217;t have mocked us.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I hated them for defiling me, but I took solace knowing that I remembered each and everyone of their faces.&nbsp; They&#8217;d be arrested, and I would take absolute pleasure identifying each and every one of them to aid in their sentencing.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;However, it was at that moment I realized the horror of my situation.&nbsp; I struggled among the garbage bags, but my arms and legs were bound with tape.&nbsp; I tried to scream, but my mouth was sealed with that wide strip of brown packing tape.&nbsp; How could I get somebody&#8217;s attention to escape the dumpster before�&nbsp; before�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Trash pick-up.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I struggled harder and fiercer, screaming louder and louder as I thrashed about wildly.&nbsp; Tried as I might, I only sunk deeper beneath the black trash bags that filled the metal coffin.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Down the street, I could hear the slow mechanical hiss of a garbage truck. It drew closer, stop by stop, until it just outside the alley.&nbsp; It backed towards my coffin with a frightening roar.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The metal bars scrapped into the notches along the dumpster and lifted.&nbsp; With all my willpower, I strained my lungs and vocal chords, freeing the tape from my lips and allowing a shriek of terror to echo through the alley, just as I fell into the rear of the dump truck, garbage bags filled with waste piling onto my back.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Help me, please!� I screamed.&nbsp; �Stop! Stop!&nbsp; Don&#8217;t crush me!&nbsp; Please!�&nbsp; Over and over I yelled as the hydraulic pumps closed the truck and begin closing in on itself.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll never forget that horrifying noise of the metal walls scrapping in their grooves and crunching the trash beneath them.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Stop!� I yelled, with every ounce of air in my lungs.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The march of the walls continued.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Knowing it would be my last chance, I took a giant gasp of air, saturating my body with all it could handle.&nbsp; And then, I screamed in one horrific roar, for my life truly did depend on it.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And then, the noise stopped.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I had survived.&nbsp; Now, how to explain this to the garbage was a new crisis�
