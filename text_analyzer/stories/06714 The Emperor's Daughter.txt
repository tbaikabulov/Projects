The Emperor&#8217;s Daughter
Part One
Gang Rape

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

&#8216;What goes around, comes around&#8217;, my father used to say, may he rest in peace. Despite what the peasants may claim, Daddy was a smart and gentle man, even if he had his bloodthirsty moments.&nbsp; I know that he killed a lot of people, but, let&#8217;s face it; the vast majority of them deserved it.

I stood by my masked lawyers in the spacious and historic courthouse as the jury handed down their verdicts.&nbsp; Though I kept a calm demeanor as the foreman announced &#8216;Guilty&#8217; after &#8216;Guilty&#8217;, I burned with rage on the inside.&nbsp; My eyes slid from juror to juror as I memorized each of their faces, and determined what fates they would have.

Guilty on each and every one of two-hundred-and-seventy-three counts of murder, assault, imprisonment, theft, rape, and whatever other personal vendettas the prosecutors wanted to fulfill.&nbsp; Half the charges were bullshit, but when you&#8217;re the daughter one of the most hated men in history, few people are going to view your accusations with an open mind.&nbsp; I knew things were hopeless from the moment that every lawyer in the city denied my case, leaving me with just these masked public defenders.

The entire trial was a charade.&nbsp; Every last bit of it was absolutely meaningless, except towards formalizing my imprisonment.&nbsp; No witnesses would stand for the defense but myself.&nbsp; I did not deny what I had done, though the prosecutors and I disagreed on legality.&nbsp; I am the Emperor&#8217;s Daughter, I said, and that made my actions legal.&nbsp; They all laughed at me, no longer afraid of father&#8217;s wrath&#8212;or my own.

They transferred me that evening.&nbsp; No longer would I be held in the central building of the new government. Instead, I would be brought somewhere more secluded.&nbsp; Somewhere quiet and isolated for me to live out the rest of my life, as my lawyers told me.&nbsp; They lied.

When Maria Plaza came into sight through the tiny window of the transportation truck, I knew precisely where they were taking me.&nbsp; My own private prison&#8212;Laura&#8217;s Center for Behavioral Modification.&nbsp; Daddy had given it to me over five years ago. I managed it until his death, when I went into hiding.&nbsp; It was saddening how the new monsters in charge had let it go to shambles.&nbsp; 

I took the fountain pen at the front desk and signed my name, Laura Maria Kampf, with my characteristic flair.&nbsp; Though the transition was from only from one prison to another, my conviction had removed the last of my rights.&nbsp; If the law had its way, I would remain inside that hole for the rest of my life&#8212;or just the next one-thousand-two-hundred-and-twenty-seven-years of it.

However, I didn&#8217;t understand what that life would entail, outside of the usual boredom of confinement.&nbsp; That is, until I saw him standing there, just on the other side of the first set of iron doors.

Gregory Flint.&nbsp; Leader of the People&#8217;s Movement for a Free Garlin and General of the new government.

--------------

The woman, not much older than Laura, shook visibly as the Emperor&#8217;s Daughter entered the tiny prison cell.&nbsp; Besides her wrist and ankle manacles, the specimen wore only a set of thin brown shirts and shorts, and Laura knew there was nothing underneath it.&nbsp; Peasants didn&#8217;t deserve undergarments.&nbsp; No, they weren&#8217;t worth the resources.

�Up,� commanded the Emperor&#8217;s daughter.&nbsp; She swung out her riding crop and pressed it gently against the prisoner&#8217;s chin.

�Won&#8217;t anybody help me?� she whimpered to herself, still clenching her legs defensively.

�Stop your sniveling, girl,� commanded the mistress.&nbsp; She pulled the crop back and swatted it forward, eliciting a bodily spasm from the slave girl.&nbsp; �Do you even know why you&#8217;re here?�

The girl continued to look at the floor.&nbsp; �Please��

�You&#8217;re here because of your father, Miss Flint.&nbsp; His rabble-rousing has caused nothing but problems for my Daddy, but arresting him would have too many unintended consequences.�&nbsp; She tilted her heads towards the door and said, �Guards, please.�

Within seconds, an imperial soldier wearing entered the cell, pushing a cart in front of him.&nbsp; All three shelves were filled with a menagerie of torture devices, laid out methodically like a surgeon&#8217;s tools.&nbsp; Clips, batteries, hammers, dildos, knives, pliers, and dozens of others, each varying shapes and sizes to ensure that the Emperor&#8217;s Daughter would have exactly the tools for her job.

�Tell me, peasant: are you a virgin?�

The girl did not respond.

�Are you going to tell me, or am I going to have to check myself?�

She was.

�Give me your hands.�

The girl clenched them tighter, though her resistance waned when the tip of the riding crop slashed across her cheek.&nbsp; It took only seconds for Laura Kampf to grab the girl&#8217;s wrists, then clamp and lock them to eyebolts set into the dungeon wall.

�Perfect.�&nbsp; Laura grabbed the first of her tools and descended on her prisoner.&nbsp; Tens of tiny metal clips filled her hands.&nbsp; One by one, she grabbed them by their grips, squeezed to open them up, and snapped them onto the slave&#8217;s young flesh.&nbsp; Her nipples, clit, cheeks, ears, thighs, and lips, all over her most erogenous spots to ensure she&#8217;d feel the pain and disgrace.

�Stop! Stop!� the prisoner screamed, but Laura continued silently with a smile on her face.

�There, that&#8217;s a start,� she said once all forty-eight clips littered the girl&#8217;s body.&nbsp; �Now what shall I do next?�

�Let me go!�

�Sorry, Miss, but you haven&#8217;t yet paid for the sins of your father.�

�What does he have to do with it?�

�What an idiotic and childish question.&nbsp; You already know, and I&#8217;m not going to waste my time repeating it.�&nbsp; Laura returned to the cart full of sensual torture devices.&nbsp; So many fun objects strewn in front of her, but she chose the old mainstay of erotic torture&#8212;a red strap-on dildo.&nbsp; She curled up her skirt and pulled the toy up around her waist.&nbsp; 

The slave trembled.&nbsp; �Please, I&#8217;ll tell my father to stop what he&#8217;s doing.�

�Oh, come on.&nbsp; If I let people go without punishment, what&#8217;s the point of deterrence?&nbsp; Sorry, you&#8217;re here to set an example.�&nbsp; Laure kneeled down between the naked girl&#8217;s legs and supported herself against the wall with her right hand.&nbsp; With her left, she grabbed the phallus and guided it against the entrance of Melissa Flint&#8217;s sealed pussy.&nbsp; With one thrust, Laura broke through the hymen.

Melissa screamed a pained howl.&nbsp; It didn&#8217;t bother Laura&#8212;she was used to the noise.&nbsp; 

She pushed in further and leaned her clothed body against the writing and screaming mass of her prisoner.&nbsp;&nbsp; Melissa&#8217;s tits pressed against Laura&#8217;s own and caused friction across her breast and nipples.&nbsp; It was pleasing.

Laura pressed in harder until only thing separating their bodies were the layers of precious pink and black silk that comprised her entire outfit.&nbsp; All the while she thrust back and forth with her pelvis in a motion she had spent years practicing.&nbsp; 

Melissa screamed the entire and violently shook her body in a vain attempt to buck her violator.&nbsp; Her wailings bespoke a pain she had never felt before, but Laura could hear the subtle undertone of her voice.&nbsp; It was pleasure.&nbsp; As much as Laura was hurting her new slave, there was also pleasure.&nbsp; The Emperor&#8217;s Daughter took it as a compliment.&nbsp; Her victims always grew to like their torture, even if only the tiniest amount.

It was long after Melissa&#8217;s voice halted that Laura stopped.&nbsp; Satisfied that she had set the girl well on the road to redemption, she stood, unstrapped the dildo, placed it neatly on the tray, and walked to the door.&nbsp; She knocked three times in quick succession and announced, �I&#8217;m finished here.&nbsp; Open up.�&nbsp; The door opened and strolled past the guards, her head held high with pride at a job well done.

Still looking ahead, she announced, �You may do with her as you see fit.&nbsp; Just don&#8217;t remove any of her jewelry.&nbsp; I&#8217;ll be back in the morning to check in.�&nbsp; With that, the Emperor&#8217;s Daughter left Melissa Flint to the guards.

Just as she reached the end of the hall and gate to her private residence, screams began to echo through the prison complex.

She ignored them, entered her home, and went straight to bed.

---

Laura Kampf returned to the prison wing of the centerr just before noon the following day.&nbsp; She nodded to the guard standing watch and was let into the prisoner&#8217;s cell.

Melissa Flint was exactly where Laura left her the previous night&nbsp; However, the girl that sat in the corner with her arms and legs bound to the wall was not the same; her eyes returned a vacant stare as one of the guards continued to thrust in and out of her cunt, as if her soul was hiding from the evils being visited upon her flesh.&nbsp; A guard continued to thrust into her cunt, and her body shook with each slap of skin.

�Can she speak?� asked Laura.

�Yes.&nbsp; Well, sometimes, at least.&nbsp; It&#8217;s been about an hour or so.�

�Good.&nbsp; I want her father to know why we had to put his daughter through hell.&nbsp; Clean her, but don&#8217;t bother giving her clothes.&nbsp; Drop her off on her father&#8217;s doorstep.&nbsp; That will solve the problem with Gregory Flint.&nbsp; I am certain of it.�

Laura Kamp would pay dearly for her moment of compassion.

--------------------

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�She told me everything, you know.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I looked up into Flint&#8217;s eyes and lied, �I have no idea what you&#8217;re talking about.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You&#8217;ll remember soon enough.�&nbsp; He turned towards his guards and gave them orders, just out of my earshot.&nbsp; �And be rough.&nbsp; She deserves it.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The two guards flanked me.&nbsp; Though they were each well over a foot taller than me, I continued to stand proud.&nbsp; They would not break me.&nbsp; They couldn&#8217;t, for I knew the strength of my blood.&nbsp; I would remember that, always, no matter what they did to me.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Their next action gave me true insight into just what they had planned.&nbsp; First, they freed my wrists from the painful handcuffs, but replaced them with the same type of thick, metallic manacles I had forced onto my prisoners when I was in charges of this place.&nbsp; The cold iron weighed heavily on my arms; I was not used to exerting myself, for there were always servants to do my bidding for me.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The collar worried me more.&nbsp; It was an inch thick of stainless steel, both in height and thickness and locked shut around my neck, a fit that left little room to breath.&nbsp; I had never realized how heavy those things were.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�How does it feel, you filthy bitch?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I turned my head towards the black man.&nbsp; �Don&#8217;t talk down to me, you filthy peasant.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What did you call me,� he yelled back. My coaxing had work.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Calm down, Eric,� said his friend.&nbsp; �She&#8217;ll pay soon enough.�&nbsp; He reached around behind me and grabbed my breasts in both of his hands.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m so glad General Flint picked us for this mission.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Geez, man, calm down,� responded the black man.&nbsp; �Even I can keep my dick in my pants better than you.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They laughed together then pushed me down the halls.&nbsp; My prison gained a frightening new appearance from the perspective of an inmate rather than a master.&nbsp; That some row of cells, once filled with joyful play things, filled me with an impression of dread, that they would bring nothing but suffering and death to me.&nbsp; All I had done with my life, from my first cruel mistreatment of servants to the outright rape and torture of my enemies, had culminated in this.&nbsp; The roles were reversed, and I would suffer my own punishments.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was the same cell that I had used to destroy Flint&#8217;s daughter.&nbsp; The goons pushed into the cell and I collapsed onto the floor, smacking my face against the metallic floor.&nbsp;&nbsp; I cursed aloud, but they only laughed.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The bondage felt strange against my skin.&nbsp; Never had I been so thoroughly bound or manipulated.&nbsp; Never had I ceded power to another.&nbsp; Never had I been so utterly helpless.&nbsp;&nbsp; Strung up against the corner, my legs spread, my sex exposed, I began to cry.&nbsp; That is what it had come to?

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The men started just as I had.&nbsp; They tortured me, and they enjoyed every minute of it.&nbsp; First came the clamps, stuck not only to my clit and nipples and but also my pure and unmarked skin.&nbsp; I screamed and swore as I felt the alligator clips cold metal teeth defiling my flawless skin.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�How does that feel, Missy?� taunted the taller thug.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Let me go!&nbsp;&nbsp; This is your last warning.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh?&nbsp; What are you going to do if we don&#8217;t?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I still know powerful people.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The shorter man laughed.&nbsp; �Powerful people?&nbsp; That&#8217;s a laugh.&nbsp; All of your daddy&#8217;s biggest supporters have already been executed.&nbsp; There&#8217;s nobody left to turn to.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I looked away in an attempt to hide my disappointment.&nbsp; That evening at Holsborough Manor, when I was wrested violently from that basement hideaway, I saw the capture of many of my supporters.&nbsp; They wanted me to be the new empress, for me to carry on my father&#8217;s reign.&nbsp; I shared his ideals, they said, but I knew they wanted me as nothing more than a figure heard.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But now they were gone.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The taller man spared little time.&nbsp; He kneeled between my spread legs and began tearing at my red coat and skirt.&nbsp; His attack came in quick slashes&#8212;first, a tear from my collar down, then my skirt out, then my bra, my panties, my stockings.&nbsp; The final amenities that they had allowed me during my incarceration were being forcibly torn away.&nbsp; Without my ornate custom clothing, I was nobody.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He raped me like a common piece of trash.&nbsp; In and out he thrust with his cock, over and over as I screamed and cried for the first time since my father&#8217;s suicide.&nbsp; They grabbed and pulled my body as if I were a ragdoll, or worse, a commoner.&nbsp; Street whores and rebels deserved this sort of fate, but not me.&nbsp; However, the pieces of shit that violated me over and over that night did not share my same philosophy.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Dirt.&nbsp; Whore.&nbsp; Trash.&nbsp; Bitch.&nbsp; They called me everything in a clear attempt to not just break my body, but my spirit.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hours later, Gregory Flint returned.&nbsp; In his hand, he carried the same brown sacks used as prison uniforms for my former pets.&nbsp; �Is she alive?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes, sir.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good.&nbsp; We wouldn&#8217;t want her taking the easy way out.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What shall we do with her, sir?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Leave her be.&nbsp; There is a lot more in store for her&#8212;I understand I was not the only person to want revenge against the Devil of Garlin.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Should we leave her chained up?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No, no, just cuff her hands behind her back and dress her properly.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They didn&#8217;t even bother to clean me.&nbsp; I had to sleep on my side, my arms painfully chained together with cuffs behind my back.&nbsp; The burlap clothing was nothing more than a simple skirt held up by string and am open vest.&nbsp; They offered neither protection, nor warmth, and only served to remind me of my role as defenseless prisoner.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It&#8217;s been days since that first encounter, and nobody has come to rescue me.&nbsp; I cry out into the darkness, but nobody answers.&nbsp; Sometimes I hear laughter from the other side of the door, and I know I am the subject of their jesting.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Am I going to die?&nbsp; What do these monsters have in store for me?&nbsp; I� I never understood how brutal my own punishments against my slaves were.&nbsp; Torture, defilement, gang rape, dehumanization&#8212;all my tools were being visited upon myself.&nbsp; How long can my frail and young body last?

And if they intended to emulate my own strategies, there is a lot more heading my way.&nbsp; Unspeakable acts that transcend simple sadism.&nbsp; Acts that I once thought of as necessary to rule the world may end up used only to make me suffer, to make me pay for my sins against the people.

But, no matter how much it hurts, no matter what these punishments do to me, I feel no regret.

The Kampf Empire will live forever.&nbsp; There are hundreds, thousands, perhaps millions of followers that still believe in our ideals 

But, as I cry myself to sleep in my cell, night after night, all I can do is plead with the darkness.

Won&#8217;t somebody save me?&nbsp; Anybody?&nbsp; 

Please?

The Emperor&#8217;s Daughter
Part Two
Cum Dumpster
By Razor7826 (Copyright 2008.&nbsp; This is a work of fiction and in no way represents the author&#8217;s view).

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For all their claims of fairness and morality, the Democratic Republic of Garlin spared little time in sinking to the ill reputed tactics of my father&#8217;s empire.&nbsp; Even from my position, chained to the wall of my private cell, I could hear the cries of men and women.&nbsp; Were they former allies of daddy?&nbsp; Or, were they common criminals sentenced to what used to be my private playground?

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They cried for mercy all through the day and not.&nbsp; Men and women of all ages begged for release and proclaimed their innocence, but just as I never listened to my captive&#8217;s pleas, so too did the new captors.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It had been days since I left my cell when a new wave of guards arrived.&nbsp;&nbsp; I clenched my thighs together, but that was not their intent&#8212;yet.&nbsp; They attached a leash to my collar and dragged me from my cell, my feet barely able to support my weight after weeks of being fucked where I lay.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;When those cast iron bars receded into the ceiling and the doors of the prison slid open, I knew exactly what new torment awaited me.

-

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Laura Kampf walked along the deserted prison hallway followed only by her most recent acquisition.&nbsp; In one hand she held the leash that dragged along her collared slave; in the other, a wooden sign. A strange metallic necklace glittered around her neck. The pitter-patter of the slave&#8217;s bare feet was barely audible above the clap of Laura&#8217;s heels. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A chain encircled the young woman&#8217;s hips, tight enough to press into her skin.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Hurry along, Tracy� commanded the Emperor&#8217;s Daughter.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�But, I&#8217;m��

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Laura pulled harder.&nbsp; �Do not question my views, you rebellious cunt.�&nbsp; .She had to put all her weight against the polished metal to pry it open.&nbsp; It led into a larger chamber, with a row of bars separating its two halves.&nbsp; Five guards were spread across the room: two by a huge set of double doors, one at middle partition, and one each by its two side doors.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good morning, Mistress.&nbsp; Will you be going outside today?� asked the guard from the central barrier.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes.&nbsp; I request a guard to watch the prisoner for the day.&nbsp; We will be in the plaza.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Right away, Mistress.�&nbsp; The guard walked to a console built into the wall and slid a key inside.&nbsp; With a turn and taps of three buttons, the prison bars ascended into the ceiling.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The guards beside the central door moved to the center, grasped the cast iron handle, and pushed.&nbsp;&nbsp; A sliver of light darted across the floor and expanded until the entire entrance hall basked in morning light. Laura tugged on the prisoner&#8217;s leash and walked into Maria Plaza.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was pristine, just as she liked it.&nbsp; The plaza, along with Laura&#8217;s Center for Behavior Modification, were gifts from her Father on her eighteenth birthday.&nbsp; The central fountain was surrounded on all sides by innate carvings into the floor, all made of white stone.&nbsp; She did not know what kind of stone, exactly, only that it was polished and maintained by an armada of slave labor and lower class workers.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Laura led the slave to the metal pillars that rose from the ground in a circle around the fountain.&nbsp; They were polished steel, added months after the plaza was first created&#8212;an addition of Laura&#8217;s own sadism.&nbsp; She forced the prisoner to her knees.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Please, not this!� the prisoner yelled.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Laura pulled back her riding crop and slashed the girl across her cheek.&nbsp; �You have debts to pay, Miss Frum.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I didn&#8217;t do anything wrong!�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Laura laughed.&nbsp; �Guilt by association.�&nbsp; She forced the girl&#8217;s wrists and ankles into the manacles at the top and bottom of the pole.&nbsp; Then, she grabbed the dental gag that dangled around her own neck and crammed it into the girl&#8217;s mouth.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The girl screamed and begged, but Laura ignored her. Men were already lingering at the edge of the plaza, but none dared enter until Laura was gone, lest she pick men out of the crowd to be her personal playthings.&nbsp;&nbsp; With the girl bound and prone, Laura placed the sign around the girl&#8217;s neck by a heavy length of the chain.&nbsp; The sign only had two words:&nbsp; Cum Dumpster.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Look at them, Elizabeth. Don&#8217;t they look hungry?�&nbsp; She bent over and grabbed the girl&#8217;s cheeks in her hands and tilted her head, forcing the girl to look at the dozens of men waiting for Laura to leave.&nbsp; �Though you may have done nothing explicitly wrong, you could have turned in your family.&nbsp; However, you failed to do what was right for the Empire.&nbsp; Enjoy your punishment.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Laura retreated back into the prison doors.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�How long will she stay out there?� asked one of the guards.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Until the same time tomorrow.&nbsp; Make sure that the people use her exactly as specified.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Will do, Mistress.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Laura returned to her quarters.&nbsp; They were situated directly above the central entrance, four stories up.&nbsp; The prison was a narrow building; halls of cells on the ground floor, then a tower of a residence for the woman in charge.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She walked to her balcony.&nbsp; The girl was already being used.&nbsp; A line of men extended past the fountain, and it was growing faster than the men could dump their loads inside her mouth.&nbsp; The less patient men bypassed the line and rubbed their cocks against her skin, shooting their loads into her black hair and across her fair white skin.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Emperor&#8217;s Daughter watched the scene below and savored every minute of it.&nbsp; Though the same punishment had been handed down to countless women, Laura never got tired of it.&nbsp; She leaned against the marble railings of her balcony and slid her left hand down her skirt.&nbsp; The hours passed as she fingered herself to the scene of endless brutality.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Not once did the men below dare make eye contact, lest they catch her attention.

--

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was awoken sometime after two in the morning.&nbsp; The guard dragged a middle aged woman behind him with a leash and collar.&nbsp; Her arms were manacled behind her back, and tears streamed down her face.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�We found her trying to free the prisoner.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes.&nbsp; She claims to be the girl&#8217;s mother.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Set her up at a pole next to her daughter, and let them both rot for another day.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes, Mistress.�&nbsp; The guard left her room.&nbsp; Five minutes later that some guard exited out the front door holding the mother&#8217;s arm in one hand and a sign in the other.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Without warning, a shadow sprinted from the nearest alley, brandishing a sword over his head.&nbsp; He screamed and yelled like one of the savages that the Emperor had suppressed years ago.&nbsp; He did not reach the guard, did not free the woman that he had clearly intended to free. A bullet pierced his chest, another, his head, and he collapsed to the plaza floor in a lifeless heap.&nbsp; The mother and daughter screamed&#8212;they knew who he was, it would later be proven.&nbsp; He was a family member that couldn&#8217;t stand seeing the women used as such.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The guard turned around and gave a thumbs up to the watch tower, from which the saving bullets had been shot from.&nbsp; He returned to his task and forced the Mother to kneel at the pole&#8217;s base.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Laura fell asleep again without giving the mother and daughter further thought.

---

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Emperor&#8217;s Daughter returned to the plaza the following morning to survey the damages wrought unto the rebellious family.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The daughter had been used significantly more than the mother.&nbsp; She stared at the ground, her entire body limp and dragging against the chains and manacles. Cum dribbled out of her mouth, and Laura&nbsp; could still see some that puddled behind her teeth, as if the slave did not even have the strength left to expunge it from her mouth.&nbsp; If not for the slight movement of her chest as she strained to breath, Laura would think the prisoner was dead.
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
The girl&#8217;s body, too, was covered in cum.&nbsp; Some of it was dried; some of it still gleamed as a liquid.&nbsp; Her tits were especially drenched, and her nipples looked bruised.&nbsp; Apparently, some of the men had taken the opportunity to inflict direct harm to the cum dumpster.&nbsp; Curiously, the way in which the girl clenched her thighs together made it pool between her legs, just outside her cunt.&nbsp; Laura wondered if it could result in a pregnancy.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It would be the ultimate insult.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The mother was much the same, but less worse for the wear.&nbsp; She still looked at Laura with her eyebrows arched in contempt, but she spoke not a word.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Emperor&#8217;s Daughter returned to the prison and announced the women&#8217;s final fate.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good.&nbsp; They are free to go.�

----

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;We exited into the central plaza.&nbsp; Though pristine during my father&#8217;s reign, it had fallen into disrepair and filth over the last few months.&nbsp; The new government did not have the same reverence for art that my Father did.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Weeds slipped up through the cracks and covered the fine details etched into the bricks.&nbsp; When viewed from proper heights, the plaza represented a giant mural detailing the founding of the city.&nbsp; It was a magnificent work of culture and art, and one of the greatest architectural masterpieces of the modern world.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And they, they-- the filthy people that killed my father and destroyed his empire--ruined it.&nbsp; They took a productive economy and peaceful society and ran it into the ground over a slight difference of perspective.&nbsp; They could not see the great empire for what it was and tore it down, slowly at first but already teetering on the edge of the abyss.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Even in prison, I could get the newspaper or hear the guards&#8217; gossip.&nbsp; Everything was in shambles, and the new leaders did not have the resolution or vision necessary to control what my father created.&nbsp; Things were getting worse, but there was no longer a solution.&nbsp; They had killed their only hope.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And now, months after they pushed my father to take his own life under the threat of prosecution as a war criminal, they were resorting to the same tactics.&nbsp; The guards stripped me of my brown garments and pushed me to my knees before fastening me to the one remaining pole, just as I had done to my prisoners in those better times.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I knew what was coming.&nbsp; One of the guards shoved the dental gag into my mouth; I resisted with all my might, but it was not enough, and soon I was every bit as prone a victim as the poles were designed for.&nbsp; However, there were two differences.&nbsp; Not only did they not hang that cum-encrusted sign across my bare breasts, but they blindfolded me.&nbsp; I knew why-- few would dare cross me if I could identify and avenge the sinners.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Soon after the guards left me to my fate, the footsteps of dozens or hundreds of my former subjects approached.&nbsp; They whispered to each other in hushed tons, as if fearful I might hear.&nbsp; They were right to be afraid.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I could feel them block the sun from my skin.&nbsp; They were close, all staring at me, wondering what to do with my body.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t bother to speak, for I knew it served no purpose.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Fuck it, I&#8217;m going in,� announced one of them.&nbsp; His belt buckle clattered to the ground and he approached.&nbsp;&nbsp; He held my head firm with both hands and slid his cock into my immobile mouth.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was disgusting.&nbsp; I had tasted only a few cocks before in my life, but his was the vilest.&nbsp; It reeked of sweat, cum, and lord knows what else this peasant used it with.&nbsp; I shook and screamed, trying to shake that filthy thing from my mouth, but he held tight.&nbsp; The others laughed at my plight, my misery fueling their own sadistic pleasures.&nbsp; They were no better than me, no more peaceful or moral.&nbsp; Just a bunch of selfish ignoramus&#8217; fulfilling whatever desires they could get away with.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The man&#8217;s cum shot and the back of my mouth and splashed down my throat.&nbsp;&nbsp; I thought I would wretch, but I suppressed the urge, knowing that nothing could be more unbecoming of the Emperor&#8217;s Daughter than to puke in public.&nbsp; I would endure in my own way, above base bodily reactions.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Another man took his place, and another, and another.&nbsp; I wanted to see their faces, to know whom to hunt down and torture, but the thick black blindfolded made that an impossible task.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Or almost impossible, I should say. The pole was dented from whatever weaponry had destroyed each of the other poles, and it was at the perfect height of the blindfold.&nbsp; I leaned back and maneuvered my head, hoping to snag it off. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It worked.&nbsp; The blindfold fell to the floor and the men and women that surrounded and abused my body froze in their tracks.&nbsp; I stared at each of them in turn for a brief moment to memorize their face and pass judgment.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They fled in panic before my stern gaze. I still had it&#8212;the power to terrify anybody with a glance, the perfect tool for any leader.&nbsp; I would have been a great successor to my father someday.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My victory, however, was short lived.&nbsp; Gunshots rang out across the plaza.&nbsp; The guards were returning.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was Flint.&nbsp; �Nice work, Ms. Kampf, but that is not what we intended.&nbsp; Guards, bag her.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I didn&#8217;t know what he meant until one of the guards a tiny burlap sack of my head and fastened the cord far too tightly around my neck.&nbsp; His companion held my head still, just long enough for him to pierce a mouth hole with his knife.&nbsp; I was once again ready to be used, this time with no hope of seeing my attackers.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How many hundreds of men used my mouth?&nbsp; Everybody knew the horrors I committed during my father&#8217;s reign, and almost all of them must have known one of my victims.&nbsp; There was no shortage of former subjects that wanted to see me raped, tortured, violated, or murdered.&nbsp; And now, they had the chance, and from the feelings of it, most used the opportunity.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Never underestimate the human capacity for revenge.&nbsp; Though most claim to be good people that speak with disdain for the horrible deeds committed daily in the world around them, nearly every single man and woman will jump at the opportunity to murder, rape, or maim a person they hate, given the promise of no legal recourse.&nbsp; I was living proof.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How many days did they leave me there?&nbsp; How many men tore at my body, pierced my holes, and filled me with their filth?&nbsp; It felt as if every inch of my body were caked with cum, some dry and crusted, the rest still moist.&nbsp; It pooled in my mouth and dribbled out, and so many times I thought I would drown in it.&nbsp; I hacked and coughed, but still it wasn&#8217;t enough.&nbsp; I was forced to swallow so much that I was never hungry.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And the women.&nbsp; When I offered meat to be used by the city folk, only men took the offer, but my own torture included women.&nbsp; Mothers, sisters, or victims themselves, all taunting and cursing me as they forced me to lick their cunts or peed in my face.&nbsp; They reminded me how much I detested women, especially those of the lower class.&nbsp; If they weren&#8217;t pregnant, they were useless.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But for all those monsters did, they did not kill me.&nbsp; My captors would not allow it.&nbsp; They had other plans for me.&nbsp; They left the bag on my head until we were back in the prison and did not even allow me a shower before leading my back into my cell.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I retreated to my corner and huddled up against the wall.&nbsp; However, I quickly pulled away, shocked by a strange sense.&nbsp; Something had pricked the skin of my shoulder.&nbsp; I turned around.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was a piece of paper jammed forcefully into a crack in the wall.&nbsp; I pulled it out and unfolded it.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Dear Empress Laura,

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your loyal followers are watching you.&nbsp; Some day you shall be free, so that you can lead our people in reclaiming what was stolen.&nbsp; Hold out as best you can until we get an opportunity.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Signed,
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Your Loyal Subjects

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;P.S.&nbsp; Dispose of this letter so that the guards do not discover it.&nbsp; Secrecy is our only weapon.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I smiled.&nbsp; Perhaps I would someday escape this life of misery.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No, not just perhaps.&nbsp; Definitely.&nbsp; Whatever these monsters inflict upon me will be returned ten fold.&nbsp; Someday&#8212;maybe not soon, but someday&#8212;The Emperor&#8217;s Daughter will regain her father&#8217;s throne. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;None will be safe from my terror.&nbsp; None.

The Emperor&#8217;s Daughter Part Three
Dehumanization
By Razor7826 (Copyright 2008)


 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I didn&#8217;t even notice Gregory Flint until he kicked the dildo deeper into my cunt.&nbsp; Has my mind eroded that far, that I don&#8217;t even notice those around me?&nbsp; Or had I fallen asleep without knowing it again?&nbsp; How have I let things reach this point?&nbsp; Day in, day out, I am raped, violated for the perverse pleasure of the prison guards.&nbsp; Was the note from my followers but a cruel joke, only to further crush my spirits?

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Wake up, Laura.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I mewed into the ball gag.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Wake up, Laura.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I mewed louder.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That&#8217;s better.&nbsp; One of your old friends wanted to visit you, and we decided to be nice and give you the opportunity.&nbsp; I understand how exhausting the last month has been on you.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Had it already been that long?&nbsp; I had not seen daylight since that week I was forced to survive on nothing but cum in my plaza.&nbsp; When your life is defined by nothing but an unending stream of violation, time slips away.&nbsp; One moment blurs into the next blurs into hours later.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And Friends?&nbsp; Last I heard most of the generals&#8217; sons and daughters were killed or in exile.&nbsp; Was there somebody I didn&#8217;t know about?

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then I realized the cruelty of his joke.&nbsp; Though the girl before she was once a friend, I had burned that bridge years ago.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Alisha Silverborough--&nbsp; Daughter of the former finance minister and one of the most prominent women of the upper class.&nbsp; Well, at least she was until I destroyed her for speaking ill of me in public.&nbsp; Though anyone that crossed my father warranted personal destruction, it was little compared to anybody that went after me.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Of all my prisoners, none filled me with more glee than her.

-

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Not a sound echoed throughout the prison wing except for the fleshy flaps of kneels and hands against the metal floor.&nbsp; Atop the horse-girl&#8217;s back rode The Emperor&#8217;s Daughter, wearing the tight black pants and fanciful riding coat that her father had bought her several months prior.

�You&#8217;re too heavy!� screamed the girl as she crawled forward on all fours.&nbsp; Her back arched under the weight of her rider, and she struggled with each step forward.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Emperor&#8217;s Daughter swung out her feet then back towards the teenager&#8217;s chest, digging the heels of boots between the girl&#8217;s ribs.&nbsp; �I didn&#8217;t ask for your opinion, mule.�&nbsp; She reached over with her pair of pliers and pinched the girl&#8217;s ear.&nbsp; �Now, how are we going to do this?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She stumbled another step forward, followed by another and another until the duo entered the prison lobby.&nbsp; Seven guards saluted her at first sight, but she didn&#8217;t even acknowledge their presence except by command.&nbsp; �Open up.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The bars receded into the floor and ceiling.&nbsp; The commander stepped out Laura&#8217;s path.&nbsp; �Will you need any assistance, Mistress?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Just notify the city patrol of my stroll.&nbsp; I love it when they try to show off.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Right away, madam.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Laura and her mount strode into Maria Plaza in the March sun.&nbsp; It was an unusually warm day, but far too cold for the prisoner&#8217;s bare skin.&nbsp; Her large tits dangled her arms, her nipples quickly hardening.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It&#8217;s cold!�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�So?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�My� my hands are freezing��
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;
 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Laura laughed.&nbsp; �Then crawl faster.&nbsp; It will keep generate warmth.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Alisha crawled faster

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Emperor&#8217;s Daughter righted herself as the pair entered the main avenue, swinging one leg across her prisoner&#8217;s back such that she strode her triumphantly.&nbsp; The city patrol watched them pass slowly, holding a statue-like salute with their own prisoners bowing at their feet in reverence and fear.&nbsp;&nbsp; Laura waved back flashing her perfect toothy grin that she so rarely offered to the public.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Alisha struggled to make her way up the first of many hills, stumbling about as if on the verge of collapse.&nbsp; However, despite her shakes of weakness, she continued the ascent with the supportive and prodding thwacks of Laura&#8217;s riding crop.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They had barely entered the commercial district when a woman not much older than Laura stumbled into their path.&nbsp; Tears streamed down her face and smeared her makeup.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh my God, Alisha, you&#8217;re alive!� screamed the woman, her voice distorting in hyperactive enthusiasm.

  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Laura and her mount came to a stop.&nbsp; Alisha looked up at the obstructer, but did not speak a word.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Please, please, tell me you&#8217;re okay?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Emperor&#8217;s Daughter lashed out with her riding crop and thwacked the interference&#8217;s cheek.&nbsp; �Get out of our way, you filthy sow.&nbsp; This is your first and last warning.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The woman continued her ramblings.&nbsp; �Alisha, Alisha, your mother is a wreck.&nbsp; Where have you been?&nbsp; What has this woman done to you?&nbsp; You&#8217;re naked?&nbsp; What?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Laura scanned the city street for the nearest patrolman.&nbsp; Their eyes locked briefly and she nodded.&nbsp; Within moments, the officer was atop the crying woman with his nightstick.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Thank you, officer.&nbsp; Once you&#8217;ve taught that hysterical bitch a lesson, please, stop by the prison for an award.&nbsp; You may use whatever tactics are necessary in subduing her.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The officer grinned and continued to beat the woman, now aiming at her tits and ass.&nbsp; His free hand grabbed at the collar of her vibrant pink coat and tore at its buttons.&nbsp; Laura only smiled as her ride continued, 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At last, they reached their destination: The noble district, center of the former aristocracy that had virtually destroyed Garlin with their petty squabbles and feckless arrogance.&nbsp; The streets were empty, as they had tended to be in recent years.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Laura and Alisha strode deeper into the noble district.&nbsp; Little by little, the streets populated, the crowd ever growing but perpetually silent.&nbsp; It was one of their own on display this time, and each and every noble stared at the display with empty expressions.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The duo stopped at the intersection of the two main thoroughfares.&nbsp;&nbsp; She demounted and stood above her prey, her back arched backwards to accentuate her bust.&nbsp; She left the pliers on Alisha&#8217;s back and stroked her left hand through her long and perfectly kept blond hair.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Do you see this, noble trash?&nbsp; Do you see your proud daughter?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;There was no response.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Miss Silverborough.&nbsp; Pee.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Laura slapped her riding crop against the slave&#8217;s bottom.&nbsp; �You heard me.&nbsp; Pee.&nbsp; Raise your leg like the dog that you are and mark your territory.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Alisha&#8217;s face turned flush red, but she complied with the command.&nbsp; She lifted her left leg and paused briefly before the stream of yellow rained down on the cold cobble bricks of the noble district.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good.&nbsp; Now let us continue.�&nbsp; The Emperor&#8217;s Daughter returned to her position and ordered her mount to return them to the prison.

---

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Never in my life had my punishments been more effective than on Alisha Silverborough.&nbsp; Not only did I destroy the carefree innocence that had filled her life until that day, but I demoralized the nobility in a way that they never recovered from.&nbsp; When the rebellion came, it was from the peasants, not the top.&nbsp; Perhaps that is why we never saw it coming, but I took solace knowing that the lower class would eventually squander the gift of an Empire that my father had left them.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You&#8217;ll get your payment soon enough, Mr. Flint.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t want to get in the habit of letting these things slide.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Father will send the cash in the morning.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I couldn&#8217;t help but think about how much she had changed.&nbsp;&nbsp; We were classmates in the years before my father seized power, and she had a reputation for being perpetually cheerful and energetic.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Just as I had treated her like a dog, she treated me the same.&nbsp; Stripped naked and led by leash, I walked on all fours through the decaying plaza and shuttered side streets until we reached our destination.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Do you recognize this area?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I looked around.&nbsp; Despite the peeling paint, broken windows, and cracked walls, I recognized it immediately as the noble district.&nbsp; However, the men and women that flooded from most of the houses were most certainly not their original habits.&nbsp; No, they were squatters that filled in the gaps after Daddy&#8217;s purge.&nbsp; From the looks of it, not even the new government was interested in freeing most of the nobility from the Northern Camps.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Now, pee.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I would have stood and fought for my dignity, but I knew what the orders for our entourage were.&nbsp; Knowing I was defeated, I raised my leg and let loose.&nbsp; When was the last time I had peed?&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t remember&#8212;when you spend your days strapped to a wall with dildos or cocks filling your holes, you tend not to pay attention to the little things.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good girl.&nbsp; Now, unless I&#8217;m mistaken, this still isn&#8217;t like how it went last time, was it?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I knew what was coming, but I shirked away.&nbsp; She was over a foot taller than me and proportionally heavy.&nbsp; It worked fantastic the original way, but this?&nbsp; No way.&nbsp; I tried to stand, to run, to save my body from her weight, but she crushed me down.&nbsp; One army on a shoulder blade and the force of her weight behind it was enough to force me 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My left arm was the first to collapse.&nbsp; Was it broken?&nbsp; I still can&#8217;t say, but I know that it had never been forced to bear that much weight.&nbsp; My shoulder blade crashed into the hobble brick followed by other.&nbsp; I winced in pain as my knees slid back and scraped against the cobble bricks.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She continued to sit on me and laugh. I was broken and defenseless for the entire world to see.&nbsp; It was the most shameful moment of my life and all I wanted to do was crawl into a hole and die.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I knew my captors would never allow it.

---

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They allowed me to shower that night for the first time in ages.&nbsp; The guard watched me lecherously, but I did not care.&nbsp; I scrubbed myself furiously as if I could undo the taint they had spread across my body.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As I dried, the guard approached and grabbed me from behind.&nbsp; He grabbed my right tit in his hand and whispered in my ear...

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Our plans advance, Empress.&nbsp; Soon��

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His voice trailed off and he pushed me away, revealing that his lechery was but a ruse.&nbsp; My followers had not forgotten.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But, as I returned to my cell, how soon was soon?&nbsp; How much would these people ravish my mind and body before I could be rescued?

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And, most terrifying of all� would there even be anything left worth saving?

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To be continued�









The Emperor&#8217;s Daughter
Part Four
Rape Machine
By Razor7826 (Copyright 2008)

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My arms distended painfully as I dangled from the ceiling of my cell.&nbsp; Whip marks discolored and rose above my sore and naked body.&nbsp; As usual, cum caked my inner thighs and stuck them together, a constant reminder of the recent months spent as a sexual object.&nbsp; I cried for help into that black rubber ball gag, but no help had come.&nbsp; Months as a toy, raped almost endlessly, and not a single one of my followers had done anything to alleviate my torment.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gregory Flint entered with an entourage of women following closely behind him.&nbsp; All of them walked up with their backs straight, perfect and proud posture of their newfound superiority.&nbsp; Though they each looked far different than when they were still under my care, I recognized them all.&nbsp; They were all my victims from a single disastrous attempt at discipline.&nbsp; Visions of that day still haunted my memory.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The women wore elaborate and tight clothing that covered them from neck to wrist to ankle, while makeup masked their faces.&nbsp; I knew the reason for such conservative clothing.&nbsp;&nbsp; They were from the days of experimentation, when were still testing the interrogation equipment that Daddy had sent me.

-

The Emperor&#8217;s Daughter ate breakfast in bed while her new commander of operations went over the daily essentials.&nbsp; Prisoner count was up, revenue was up, and her father&#8217;s newest set of equipment had been successfully installed.

She asked, �How did the test runs go?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The commander looked away, disappointed.&nbsp; �The lubricant pump failed mid-run.&nbsp;&nbsp; The suspect was damaged far more than intended, and the doctors say it may take months for her to heal.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That won&#8217;t do.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Of course not, Mistress.&nbsp; We will tone down the settings to prevent such damage to their bodies.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Laura sighed and put down her glass of orange juice.&nbsp; �Is that the only way?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What do you mean, mistress?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I mean the settings.&nbsp; I understand the desire to spare their bodies from permanent damage, but do you really have to go gentler on her?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The commander paused to ponder Laura&#8217;s request, but she continued.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�If the damage is as severe as you say it is, then there is something wrong outside of the original operating parameters.&nbsp; Shouldn&#8217;t we fix those problems explicitly?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�But, mistress, who knows how much damage will be wrought as we experiment adjust the equipment�?

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That is not my problem.&nbsp; Make it so.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes, Mistress.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Emperor&#8217;s Daughter returned her attention to the morning&#8217;s newspaper.&nbsp; As usual, it abstained from presenting news of the recent rebel attacks and subsequent crackdown that had shattered dozens of notable families and filled her prison.&nbsp;&nbsp; Her father had given her a mission personally in a rare face-to-face meeting between Father and Daughter:&nbsp; make an example of these women, at any price.

--

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Laura did not care to check on the mechanics&#8217; progress until after dinner.&nbsp; By the time she arrived in the engineering bay, the tests were already entering their twelfth hour.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Eight women, each strapped to what at first glance appeared to be black leather chairs, circled the room.&nbsp;&nbsp; Only on further inspection could their sinister purpose be perceived.&nbsp; Black straps locked their ankles, thighs, wrists, and forearms firmly into place.&nbsp;&nbsp; Tangles of multi-colored wires and tubes trailed from the distant corners of the hall to the women&#8217;s breasts, latching on to their nipples by transparent suction cups stained white from the unending lactation.&nbsp; Beneath the chairs and visible between their spread legs, pairs of dildos reamed in and out of their cunts and asses.&nbsp; The patterns were erratic, sometimes simple up and down, back and forth, but frequently swaying from side to side or rotating.&nbsp;&nbsp; Fluids splash from their bottoms, a mixture of bodily fluids and the excessive lubricant warranted by the chair&#8217;s designers.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;However, two of the women stood out from the rest of the pack.&nbsp; Their faces betrayed not pain and suffering like the others, but shock; no fluids splashed from beneath their chairs.&nbsp; They were victims of the lubricant malfunction that the commander had spoken of.&nbsp; Pained gasps escaped their lips and blood trickled from their holes, the dildos pulling back and forth ferociously without lubricant save for whatever the women could offer.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was not enough.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Two of them appear to be broken.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�We&#8217;re still working on that, Laura.&nbsp; We should have it fixed within a few hours; some of the tubes dried and cracked during shipment, but we should be getting the replacement parts within an hour.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh, I was referring to the women, but that&#8217;s good.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What should we do with the milk?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Laura paused for a moment before coming up with an idea.&nbsp; �Bottle it, label it, and send it to their families.&nbsp; Send guards to make sure that they drink it.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The guard squirmed upon hearing the demands, but nodded and exited the room, leaving Laura to peruse the gallery of prisoners.&nbsp; There were eight of them, all upper-class nobles from both Garlin and the neighboring city states.&nbsp; Or, more precisely, former city states.&nbsp; They were all part of the Kampf Empire now, despite the works of the rebellious women in front of her.&nbsp; She savored in their misery before leaving.

----

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Emperor&#8217;s Daughter was woken just after midnight by a pale faced commander.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�There&#8217;s been a widespread malfunction.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�A power surge, we suspect.&nbsp; It damaged your father&#8217;s equipment.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She sprinted from the room to survey the damage, afraid that she had managed to destroy her father&#8217;s gift in only a day.&nbsp; However, Laura soon realized that the equipment was not the source of her commander&#8217;s worry.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The eight noble women were being led from the torture chamber on stretchers.&nbsp; Though white sheets covered their bodies, trickles of blood soaked through.&nbsp; Six of the woman cried, while two stared off into the ceiling, appearing lifeless save for the subtle heaving of their breaths.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Well, looks like they need some more maintenance.�&nbsp; She gave her orders than returned to bed, not even phased by the horrible sight she had just witnessed.

----

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�No, no, no!� I screamed at the top of my lungs.&nbsp; Of all the indignities and tortures my captors had put me through, none were as terrifying as these machines.&nbsp;&nbsp; I had saw what they did to the women forced to use them, and even the slightest possibility of ending up like those mentally ruined and destroyed lumps of bruised and cut flesh terrified me to my bone.&nbsp; I sprinted to the side and huddled in the corner, but the guards grabbed my arms and carried me towards one of the chairs.&nbsp; They pushed me into the rape machine as I thrashed and squirmed, but they held me down limb my limb and fastened the numerous straps tightly.&nbsp; The thick leather wrapped against my ankles, thighs, wrists, elbows, forearms, neck, and forehead held me tightly in place.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Please, don&#8217;t do this!� I screamed.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gregory Flint&#8217;s laugh echoed throughout the high-ceiling chamber.&nbsp; �So now you beg?&nbsp; After all we&#8217;ve done to you, now is the time at which you finally take a stand like the childish girl that you are?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The machines&#8217; previous victims stared at me.&nbsp; Vacant eyed and sorrowful souls with scars covering their body from punishments I demanded.&nbsp; �I&#8217;m� I&#8217;m sorry!�&nbsp; I yelled.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Oh?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes, yes, I&#8217;m sorry for everything I ever did to my prisoners, sorry for everything my father did.&nbsp; Please, please, please, don&#8217;t do this to me!� &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The guards pretended like I spoke not a word and continued the preparations.&nbsp; They stuck the clear plastic cups onto my nipples and flipped a switch, creating enough suction for them to stick but not enough to pry milk from my breasts.&nbsp;&nbsp; They reached underneath the chair and adjusted the dildos&#8217; positions, placing them just outside my cunt and anus.&nbsp; I could feel the rounded tips of the simulated penises and imagined them gouging my insides like they did to 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Please��

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gregory Flint kneeled in front of my and placed his hand on my thigh.&nbsp; He stroked it gently in a way that he never touched me before.&nbsp; It sent a chill down my spine.&nbsp; �Laura, let me ask you a question.&nbsp; In all your years as ruler of this hell on Earth, how many prisoners did you spare?&nbsp; How many did you let go without some horrific lesson?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I didn&#8217;t even need to think back.&nbsp; The answer was none.&nbsp; Not a soul was spared from my brutality.&nbsp; But� there were some exceptions.&nbsp; Some cases where I held back.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I� I let your daughter go after a single night.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;His face contorted with rage.&nbsp; He pulled his hand back, clenched it into a fist, and punched me in my lower stomach.&nbsp; �A single night?&nbsp; She killed herself a month later because of what you did.&nbsp; Do you not understand what impact rape can have on a person?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I understood completely.&nbsp; I had endured months of suffering at their hands, every bit as brutal as what I had inflicted on my own prisoners.&nbsp; But I was still sane.&nbsp; I was still able to think, to reflect on my surroundings, to wish for revenge and hope for my rescue.&nbsp; I was strong willed.&nbsp; The other women were just weak.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�We have nothing more to say, Laura.�&nbsp; He turned to his guards.&nbsp; �Men, try to make sure she doesn&#8217;t die, though if you fail, I won&#8217;t really care otherwise.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For the first time since I was a little girl, I prayed.&nbsp; I prayed for salvation, from this torture and all others.&nbsp; The equipment hummed to life, and my days of hell began.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A squirting noise and cold splash against my bottom signaled my lubrication.&nbsp;&nbsp; The dildo began spinning and pushed inside, and I screamed in pain. I tried to buck them from my body, but I was so thoroughly bound that I couldn&#8217;t even move an inch.&nbsp; For the first time in my life, I was at the complete mercy of a machine.&nbsp; The objects pushed, prodded, turned, and pulled at my insides, the lubricant not nearly strong enough to prevent pain.&nbsp; The friction hurt, but I knew it could be worse.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Soon the suction cups sprang to life.&nbsp; The first splash of milk clouded the clear plastic.&nbsp;&nbsp; The second splash deepened the shade of white, and the rest passed pass without visible hue.&nbsp; My back arched and my tits bounced with each painful pull as they forced lactation.&nbsp; It hurt far more than I imagined.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;How many days did they leave me like that?&nbsp; I drifted in and out of consciousness as the dildos rammed my insides and pushed in as far as possible while those cups suctioned away.&nbsp; I thought it would get better.&nbsp; I thought I would get used to it, but I was wrong.&nbsp; My health deteriorated, my breasts ran dry.&nbsp; Soon, the sucking on my tits faded to burning pain and my lower regions began to bleed. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Though alone, I begged for mercy in my hoarse and weak voice.&nbsp; I apologized for all that I ever did, but the torture continued without an end in sight.&nbsp; Gregory Flint shook me awake numerous times to check my progress and rub in his victory, while the guards fed me trace amounts of water.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I awoke back in my cell.&nbsp; Gauze bandages encircled my thigh and waist.&nbsp; My joints ached from thrashing against the restraints.&nbsp; My tits were sucked raw.&nbsp; And, worst of all, I didn&#8217;t know if I&#8217;d ever desire to have sex again.&nbsp; But, for all my suffering, there was a silver lining.&nbsp; My prayers were answered, and I was eternally thankful that the machines worked properly, knowing full well what would happen if any number of parts malfunctioned.&nbsp; It was as if there was a higher power that wanted me to survive, so I could get revenge against the monsters that defiled me.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Hours later, when I was once again hungry, the hatch opened and a small tray was carefully slid inside.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was a dish of milk.&nbsp; My milk.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I retreated back into the corner.&nbsp; Though those monsters had stolen much from me, I retained my dignity.&nbsp; I was the Emperor&#8217;s Daughter, future heir to his empire, and I would not play into their sadistic games unless by force.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The hours dragged by, and as my hunger and thirst grew my eyes kept returning to that little tray.&nbsp; I was tempted to flip it over and spill it into the drain to remove the possibility once and for all, but each time I grabbed it in my hands, I placed it gently down, knowing that I would eventually need to drink it to survive.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;And that moment soon came.&nbsp; I grabbed the dish with both my hands and held it to my mouth.&nbsp;&nbsp; It was disgusting&#8212;lukewarm and thin.&nbsp; I tilted it back and drank it down, suppressing my gag reflex.&nbsp; I returned to the corner and cried myself to sleep.

-----

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I awoke to a commotion in the hall.&nbsp; Pained screams echoed through the prison.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The door opened and my eyes accustomed to the light.&nbsp; In its path was a silhouette.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�We&#8217;re here, Empress.&nbsp; You&#8217;re finally free.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Other shadows joined his sides and echoed, �Hail the Empress!�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was time to retake my throne.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;To be continued�

The Emperor&#8217;s Daughter
Part Five
Impregnation
By Razor7826 (Copyright 2008)

-

The Emperor&#8217;s Daughter and her prey sat across from each other in her private chambers.&nbsp; �Hopefully this will suffice,� said Laura as she placed the tray in the coffee table between them.&nbsp; �It&#8217;s been years since we last met, and I&#8217;m afraid I don&#8217;t have anything special to mark the occasion.�

�Thank you, Laura.&nbsp; I&#8217;m happy to of assistance to your father&#8217;s cause,� answered the visitor as she took sipped from her glass of tea.&nbsp; She wore a high collared, tight, light blue dress that defined the shape of her breasts.&nbsp; Her hair dangled down in her shoulders in wide, auburn coils that gleamed lightly, a sign of the meticulous care the woman put into them.&nbsp; She held her back straight and proud but spoke to Laura with timid deference. �It isn&#8217;t too often that the nobility has been given a chance to get back in the Emperor&#8217;s good graces.�

�Oh, think nothing of it,� said Laura, doing her best impersonation of a polite and chatty socialite.&nbsp; She utterly despised playing coy, but it would not be much longer.&nbsp; She watched intently as the guest took another sip.&nbsp; �I never got a chance to thank you for how you treated me back then.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The guest froze.&nbsp; She lowered the cup from her lips and eyed it suspiciously.&nbsp; �Thank� me?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes.&nbsp; Your arrogant bitchiness taught me a valuable lesson about life.&nbsp; Remember all those times you called me a half-breed, a mutt, or peasant?&nbsp; How many times you left me crying in the corner of the schoolyard?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Laura, I�� said the visitor as she swayed back and forth, falling to one side and overcorrecting to the other.&nbsp; The tea cup slipped from her hand and shattered on the floor.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Laura watched with a smile as Josephine Smith teetered back and forth before collapsing onto the sofa.&nbsp; Knowing that victory was hers, she called in her guards.&nbsp; �She&#8217;s ready.�

--

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Emperor&#8217;s Daughter stood in the corner of the prison cell, her eyes intently focused on the defenseless body of Josephine Smith.&nbsp; Though still clothed, the pompous noble was strapped to two metal posts, at her waist and just below her shoulders.&nbsp; She was still clothed except for her panties that lingered around her right ankle.&nbsp; She stirred, and Laura took three steps over.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Where am I?� She asked with a calmness completely unfitting of her predicament.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You&#8217;re in a breeding stand.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What?� Josephine arched her back and flexed her arms, but the leather straps and cuffs kept her in place.&nbsp; �What are you going to do to me?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Going to do?&nbsp; It&#8217;s already happening.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They both went silent, bringing attention to the violently slapping that echoed in the stone chamber.&nbsp; A ripple of flesh traveled across Josephine&#8217;s body with each slap.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What is...�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�We&#8217;ve given you some anesthetics, to make it less painful.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The color drained from Josephine&#8217;s face.&nbsp; �No��

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes, Josephine.&nbsp; You&#8217;re being raped.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She thrashed harder in her bindings, but it served no purpose.&nbsp; She was bound, and would remain that way until long after Laura&#8217;s objective was complete.&nbsp;&nbsp; �Please��

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Please what?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Please, let me go!�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Don&#8217;t worry, I won&#8217;t let you feel any physical pain.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Why are you doing this to me?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Emperor&#8217;s Daughter turned to look at the naked slave that was plowing the noble.&nbsp; �It isn&#8217;t what you think it is.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Laura, I&#8217;m sorry for everything I did to you, all the nasty names we used to call you!�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It is far too late for mere words like that.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Why? Why are you doing this to me?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Why, you ask?&nbsp; To get you pregnant.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Josephine stared at the ground.&nbsp; �You&#8217;re doing this� to impregnate me?�&nbsp; The man at her rear dumped his load inside and pulled out, but she didn&#8217;t notice, the local anesthetics having done their job flawlessly.&nbsp; Another man took his place while the conversation between the two women continued.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Not just pregnant, but pregnant with the child of an untouchable.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What?!�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I had them imported from one of daddy&#8217;s other prisons, just for you.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Why me?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The Emperor&#8217;s Daughter laughed manically, and each and every guard stopped to watch.&nbsp; �Don&#8217;t you understand the beauty of it?&nbsp; Your child will be a half-breed mutt, a reject that you can never accept.&nbsp; That is the true flaw of the nobility&#8212;you&#8217;ve segregated society based not on the abilities of an individual&#8217;s blood, but by family name.&nbsp; Not all nobles are born equal, nor are all peasants.&nbsp; It is the individual parentage that matters, and not some insane categorization of blood.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Tears streamed down Josephine&#8217;s cheek.&nbsp; Her body shook with each violent thrust, but she spoke not a word.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;For hours Laura watched with sadistic glee until she grew tired and returned to her chambers.

---

After the first month, it was virtually certain that Josephine was with child.&nbsp; However, Laura demanded that the men share a cell with her, just to be sure.

----

We still traveled off the roads, clinging to the marshes, trusting nobody.&nbsp; I know that people still support my father, but I was not willing to place trust in others so easily.&nbsp; Especially after last time.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was that sort of misplaced trust that had led to my capture, a betrayal that would soon be avenged.&nbsp; The search dogs barked in the distance and car-mounted search lights flashed through the bog, but our counter measures held true.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He was waiting for us at our destination.&nbsp;&nbsp; Gregory Flint and his guards stood in the drive of Holsborough Manor, arguing heatedly over topics I could not discern.&nbsp; He was even more formidable when dressed in his military fatigues.&nbsp; Though he had personally overtaken my punishment and captivity, his real job was as a general, appointed by the new government after my father&#8217;s downfall.&nbsp; If there was anything in the way of reclaiming my throne, it was him.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What should we do?� asked General Troy.&nbsp; Though only a lieutenant in my father&#8217;s army, his brave raid on the correctional facility warranted an instant promotion&#8212;my first act as Empress.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�How many are there?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Twenty, thirty.&nbsp; I don&#8217;t know why there is such a small detachment.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Can we ambush them?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes, but there will probably be some casualties.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;That was none of my concern.&nbsp;&nbsp; Any sane soldier should be happy to die for their Empress.&nbsp; I gave the command, and our battalion encircled the manor.&nbsp; The General escorted me deeper into the woods, to avoid any stray bullets.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;At exactly 1:30 AM, the sky filled with the sound of gunfire.&nbsp; It lasted only a minute.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;A messenger soon returned.&nbsp; �They are defeated, Empress.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good, good.�&nbsp; Though exhausted, I held my back straight.&nbsp; I was their leader now, and I had to show strength at all times.&nbsp;&nbsp; 

Troy and I returned to the manner to find its inhabitants being dragged out into the driveway by gunpoint.&nbsp; At their feet was Gregory Flint, bleeding profusely but still alive.&nbsp; I kneeled at his side and placed my hand against his forehead.

�Hello, Flint.�

�B� Bitch�� escaped his lips as he gasped for air.

I stood and turned to the general.&nbsp; �Give me your gun.�&nbsp; He handed it to me without question or hesitation.&nbsp; �Farewell, Flint.&nbsp; May you see your daughter in the other world.�&nbsp; I pointed the gun at him and finished the job that my soldiers failed to do. 

Numerous members of the Holsborough family freaked out when they saw me with the gun.&nbsp; They, their maids, and their butlers begged for mercy, but they misunderstood my intentions.&nbsp; �I won&#8217;t kill any of you,� I proclaimed.&nbsp; �You have other uses.�&nbsp; I handed the gun back to Troy and approached the young man at the center the lineup.&nbsp; �Hello, Joshua.�

�Laura, please don&#8217;t do this�� he muttered.&nbsp; He had no idea what was coming to him.

�Your family betrayed me, Joshua.&nbsp; I turned to you all for protection, and you turned me over to him.�&nbsp; I nodded towards Gregory Flint, the man that had spent months raping me, personally or in proxy.&nbsp; �That is not a sin I can let slide, though not all of you will share the same fate.�

-----

We used the Holsborough family&#8217;s motorcade and the remnants of Flint&#8217;s convoy to escape.&nbsp; I shared the hull of an armored troop carrier with Joshua.

�It&#8217;s been a while, hasn&#8217;t it?�

�What are you going to do with us?�

�I can&#8217;t let your parents get away with what they did.�

He turned his head away to hide his tears.&nbsp; I understood his disappointment, but they had betrayed.&nbsp; If they lived, I would be able to claim no authority.&nbsp; �Don&#8217;t worry, Josh.&nbsp; Your sisters will be spared, as will your servants.�

�Thanks,� he said, but he didn&#8217;t mean it.

�You, on the other hand��

�Laura?�

I grabbed his collar and guided him onto the floor.&nbsp; �There are bigger things in store for you.�&nbsp; I looked at him seductively as I unfastened his belt buckle.

It didn&#8217;t take long to get the response I wanted.&nbsp; His cock was soon raging hard.&nbsp; I unwrapped the bandages and descended onto his cock.&nbsp; It hurt, but I had a job to do.&nbsp; With my right hand, I reached to his base, near his testicles, and pressed.&nbsp; I stroked it as I bounced up and down.

He panted faster and faster as I skillfully applied pressure in the perfect position, and he soon shot his load inside me.&nbsp; I felt little please, both from his brevity and the desensitization that had occurred over the previous months, but that was not its purpose.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I wanted his child.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It had nothing to do with nobility.&nbsp; I could have taken anybody in the empire to be my mate, but I chose him.&nbsp; Not out of love or duty or lust, but out of a desire to make a perfect heir, born from myself with the seed of a truly admirable person. Josh was a prodigy in any number of ways: a musician, scientist, athlete, and nobleman.&nbsp; Though his parents may have betrayed me out of their own self interest, he was a pure and noble soul, a perfect father for my heir.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Was I pregnant?&nbsp; I did not know, but Joshua Holsborough would be my personally plaything until that time, and long after.&nbsp; We retreated into the mountains, to my father&#8217;s bunker, where we would make our stand.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Already, my army was rising.&nbsp; My supporters dropped everything to rejoin the Imperial Army, all knowing that I would triumph.&nbsp; The Kampf Empire would be born again.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I am the Empress.&nbsp; I will destroy my enemies and leave their shattered remains beneath my feet.&nbsp; And those that live will spend the rest of their days wishing they died.&nbsp; I do not show mercy for those that defy me.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The End
