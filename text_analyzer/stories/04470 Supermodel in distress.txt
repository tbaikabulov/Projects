Synopsis: Certainly not based on a
true story, a supermodel is arrested on her way to a job. This story tells what
she must endure in order to return to Denmark.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

1.
On the flight

&nbsp;

Ann August is model and has been one
for 5 years. Her height was 179 cm and she was weighing 48 kg. She came from a
poor fisherman family in Jutland but was discovered by a photographer in Copenhagen on a family holiday when she was 16. She was success almost at once and
now her friend called her �Lucky Ann�. She worked all
over the world but did not forget her upbringing and whenever she had a few
days off work she returned to her hometown.

&nbsp;

She had just received a new
assignment where she was going to pose in summer clothes for a purse company.
It is different job considering that she normally posed in fur coat. But animal
activists have bothered her a lot in the recent year and now it is time for her
to lay low regarding her being portrayed in fur coats. A few years ago, she was
even sprayed in her face in Paris with tear gas.

&nbsp;

Ann is a busy girl and she has
worked around the world. She has no boyfriend and even tough she often is
written about as a party girl in the newspapers, it is actually very rare she
was in town. She did literally living just with work and sleep.

&nbsp;

Now she was on her way to a beach in Malaysia
where she is going to have a few days off before returning to Denmark.
She was flying with MartyAir � a low price company because SAS didn�t have a
direct route to Malaysia
from Copenhagen.

&nbsp;

After some talking over the phone in
the plain with her agent in Copenhagen, she went to sleep. She always uses her blindfolds, because she needed
dark to sleep.

&nbsp;

Suddenly she felt someone moving
very close to her face. She panicked and immediately pushed whomever away
before she took her blindfolds off and discovered that it was the flight
attendant trying to adjust her chair.

&nbsp;

�Relax madam� he said a little
angry. She hold her hand in a way to signal �I am sorry� and went back to
sleep.

&nbsp;




2.
Arrival in Malaysia

&nbsp;

Ann was sleeping when the flight
landed. She had worked 9 hours before flight. Suddenly she was pulled up from
her chair still with the blindfolds on. Two police officers were standing in
front of her.

&nbsp;

�You are under arrest!� Ann was
confused and sleepy. Her arm was yanked behind her and she turned in order to
release the pain. �Resisting arrest. Cuff her�. Ann
was now panicking and shouting. One of the officers lifted her up and forced
her down the floor on her stomach.

&nbsp;

He produced a pair of handcuff and
cuffed her hands on her back. �Aaaugh.� She screamed.
She was then pulled up on her feet again. They took her under her shoulders and
carried her off the plane.

&nbsp;

When they came to the airport
building she was taken to a cell. Inside they released her from her handcuffs
and left her. She was banging on the door demanding an explanation of why she
was arrested. After a while she calmed down. It was of no use. �What have I
done? Why am I arrested?� She was questioning herself. Ironically she also
thought about the film crew waiting without her having a chance to inform them
of why she would be late.

&nbsp;

After a while � it felt like hours
but it turns out to be only 15 minutes the door opened and an officer was
entering the cell. �Why am I arrested?� The Officer replied, �I am here to
inform you that you are charged with battery against the flight crew and
resisting arrest. We are also suspecting you of abusing drugs due to your
erratic behavior.�

&nbsp;

�But that is not true. I have not
beaten anyone.� �Your actions are speaking for themselves. You were resisting
our officers and shouting in the plane. We are going to perform a drug test,
which would be taken as evidence of your abuse. Get ready to be transported.�

&nbsp;

Two female officers came inside the
cell and the officer went outside in the hall. �I am going to wait here while
the officers prepare you for your trip to the hospital.� He closed the door.
�Undress madam. We have fresh clothes here. You have been sweating in your old
clothes and some parts are tore due to the violent arrest you have called for.
All the clothes including the underwear � please.�

&nbsp;

Ann was not going to take a chance
of going against these people. They meant business. She took all her clothes
of.

&nbsp;

The officers gave her fresh
underwear and then an orange boiler suit. �We are not going to risk a fight
during the drive just because you are on drugs. We have to put you in
restraints.� First they took out a wide leather belt, which are closed on her
back. D-rings were attached in the front. A pair of leather cuffs was put on
her wrist and they were connected to the belt. One of the guards put a
restraint harness over and under the shoulders. Then they connected the
restraint to the belt by the use of a leather strap.

&nbsp;

�Madam. I am going to secure the restraint on your back. I have to make it
tight just so you don�t get surprise if it hurts a bit.� She pulled and Ann
grunted. It was very tight. Finally they put a second pair of leather cuffs on
her upper arms and connected them to the restraints harness on her back. She could
not move an inch.

&nbsp;

�Comfy? It is actually the same kind
of restraints we are using when we hang people. If it is going to be your
destiny, the drug test will tell. Excuse us. We are going to finish your
restraints.�

&nbsp;

She took two leather cuffs and put them
on her feet. They connected them using a short chain. �Now you are ready. Be
careful when you walk. Only take small steps.� The officer, who had waited
outside all the time came in. �Follow me.�

&nbsp;

She was taken down the hall and into
a truck, which waited outside the airport building. After a short drive they
came to a hospital where a nurse was waiting for them. In the examination room
they told her to lie down on a bed and then the nurse took a blood sample.

&nbsp;

The nurse turned to the officers.
�She is an European and your cell are very hot. She
could need a drop so she would not dry out.� A needle was put in her arm and
fluid was beginning to enter her body. The guards took three wide leather
straps and strapped her to the bed. She could not move. The nurse took out a
syringe and stuck it in the drip. �What are you doing?� Ann was confused. �Because you are upset and obvious under influence of some kind of
drug as told to me by the officers I am going to give you some anti-drug to
relax you.� �But, I have not used ����. Ann
went black at once. The last thing she heard was one of the officers stating
�Another supermodel on a rampage.�




3.
Returning to prison

&nbsp;

The next day she woke up feeling
like she had boxed 10 rounds with the best heavy weight champion the world had
ever known � Brian Nielsen.

&nbsp;

The nurse and a guard came in the
room. �Sit up. We are going to release you from the straps so you can get
something to eat.�

&nbsp;

She sat up in the bed with a little
help after the straps was removed. It turned out that she was not able to eat
by herself so a student nurse came by and fed her. It was humiliating being fed
like a child but she knew the consequences of protesting. �Can I call a
lawyer?� �You may call a lawyer and the Danish embassy when we return to the
prison.�

&nbsp;

Half an hour later she was lead to
the truck and driven to the central prison. Here she was put in a holding cell
together with 2 other women. They were not cuffed. �We are going to collect you
in an hour so you can get your phone-call�.

&nbsp;

The guards went away. She moved
slowly over to a bed and sat down. �What have we here.�
One of the other prisoners went over and pushed her on her back in the bed. The
other prisoner came forward and restraint her legs. �We are going to have some
fun until you are going any further.� The first one said. She took off her
panties and placed her cunt on Ann mouth. �Lick. I am
a convicted robber and I would kill you if you don�t do as I say.� Ann licked
as well as she was able to. She has never licked a woman before. The smell from
the woman cunt reminded her at her mothers work in a fish factory. �Ohhh. You are good. Continue.� After 10 minutes the woman
came and the two prisoners exchanged places. Ann�s face was covered with fluid
from the first woman and it turned out that the second woman was becoming even
wetter. When she came Ann felt in as like she was in a shower.

&nbsp;

�Now you have satisfied us. We are
going to return the favor.� �But, wait you don�t �� The woman unzipped the
boiler suit at the bottom and began to use her tongue on Ann. Warm feelings
began to rise trough her body. It was so nice. She
moaned. Suddenly she came. It had been so long. All this work had made it
impossible for her to have sex for more than two years. The women zipped her
again and sat on another bench and began to play cards.

&nbsp;

She was lying exhausted on the bed
when the guard returned. Noticing the wet spot on her suit and her face covered
with the drying fluid from the two women, he noticed: �Enjoying yourself. You
should take your situation more seriously. Drug use means a severe punishment
in our country.�

&nbsp;

He helped her to her feet and led
her down to a holding cell where a female guard freed her from all her
restraints. Ann�s arms were sleeping from all the hours in restraints and she
was shaking her hands when the guard came with a phone and plugged it in the
wall. She also had a note where the phone numbers on all embassies in Malaysia was listed. Ann rang the Danish embassy and sat down on a chair after
being reassured that help was on the way. She was actually searched for because
her firm was worried when she did not show up for the photo shooting.




4.
First meeting with the lawyer.

&nbsp;

Ann sat in her cell and worried.
�What is becoming of my job? What would my family think? What if the drug test
is faked?�

&nbsp;

It had been two hours since she had
the Danish embassy on the phone. Suddenly she heard steps in the hall. The
guard opened and two men came in. �I am Mr. Jensen and this is Mr. Jones. I am
from the embassy and Jones is a lawyer hired by your firm in Denmark. He is rather expensive and very good.� Ann greeted the men and the sat
down and talked about the whole incident. After Ann had told her story the
lawyer summoned up.

&nbsp;

�If the drug test is negative
because you don�t use drug then we have only one problem. We have investigated
and we have proved that the flight attendant was in fact an animal activist in
his spare time. He had recognized you and when you pushed him away he got in
the mood of paying you back, so he called the pilots and told them that you had
slapped him in the face. Living in 2006 after 9/11 such charges are always
taken serious. The pilots called the police and in order to get their attention
they colored the story a little.� 

&nbsp;

�I was framed.� Ann was in shock.

&nbsp;

�Yes, but regrettably you
contributed bringing the most serious charge against you, when you did not do
as the officers said on the plane, when they was
arresting you. Resisting arrest is considered very seriously. It is not like in
Denmark where running away from the police is not resisting arrest. It does not
matter if the other charges turn out to be false or fabricated. It is unjust
but it is the law.�

&nbsp;

�Well, I will see what I can do. I
know the judge and perhaps we can fix it so you don�t have to serve any time.
The pre-trail is tomorrow and the result of the drug test should be known. You
will have to stay here for tonight. I have arranged that you would get an
isolation cell so the other prisoners don�t take advantage of you.� Then the
men left. A female guard took her to her new cell where she immediately went to
sleep.




5.
Second night in prison.

&nbsp;

About 10 p.m. the door opened and a guard told her to stand up. Two of the guards
came with the leather restraints and she was soon restraint securely. �What is
going to happen?� Ann was a kind of nervous. �We are going to educate you about
the end of the road for drug users.� �But, I am not a drug user.� �Hush. Not a
word. Gag her.� A ball-gag was stuffed in her mouth before she could protest.

&nbsp;

They took her down the hall and into
a chamber. �Stand there at the mark�. When she was positioned one of the guards
links the cuffs on her feet together so she could not move. The other guard
came with a head harness, which was strapped around her head. The first guard
pushed a control panel on the wall and a hook was lowered from the ceiling. The
D-ring at the top of the harness was connected to the hook. �Look now we can
hoist you by remote control.� He pushed the bottom and Ann was lifted on her
toes. �You are not going to strangle. You are here to enjoy the show.

&nbsp;

The door opened and another male
prisoner was lead in. His head was covered with a leather hood. He was lead to
another mark on the floor. The guard pushed another bottom and a similar hook
line Ann�s was lowered. Instead of a head harness a noose was put around the
prisoner�s neck. The control panel was activated once more so the slack of the
rope was pulled up. The prisoner was forced on his toes. It was a cold night
and Ann could see the bag moving forth and back as the prisoner breathed
heavily. Ann waited. What was going to happen?

&nbsp;

Suddenly the hatch in the floor
opened and the prisoner plunged trough. Ann got such a shock that she peed
herself. Some coughing followed from a rasping sound was heard from the hole
and the rope quivered a little. �It is time for your education� The guard took
the remote control and used it to pull Ann of the floor. She hung in her head
harness.

&nbsp;

Then he pushed the bottom so the
hatch in the floor was opened. Ann was then lowered slowly down into the pit.
When she was just a few inches if the ground, she was stopped. They were not
alone. A doctor and a guard watch for signs of life of executed prisoner. �13 min and 20 second to the record. He has passed on.�

&nbsp;

The guard made a sign to a man at
the on the top and the executed prisoner was hoisted up. Then the hatch was
closed.

&nbsp;

Ann thought. �What about me?� The
doctor and the guard sat at a bench ignoring her. The guard had a lunch pack
and he began to eat while the doctor obvious had some forms to fill out.

&nbsp;

15 min. later Ann�s neck and chin
was hurting because it had to carry the weight of her entire body. Because she
had wetted herself earlier her legs was irritated. She was sobbing quietly and
tears were running down her chin.

&nbsp;

Some noise was heard from above. It
caught the attention of the two persons in the pit and they stood up. Suddenly
the hatch flew open and another body plunged trough the hole. It was a woman.
Her body was brought to a stop by the noose and it began to shiver. Again
coughing sounds was heard from inside the hood. The doctor approached the body
and took out his stethoscope and waited. 10 minutes later he unzip
the woman�s suit and listened. �She is not deceased yet. I will give her a few
minutes more.� Two minutes later a flow of urine began to appear below the
woman. The doctor checked her once more. �Now she is finished.�

&nbsp;

Ann felt her body being pulled up by
the harness. When she was on back in the room above the hatch, it was closed
below her. The guard releases her from the head harness and her legs was
disconnect so she as before could walk with small steps. When she returned to
her cell she was released from her restraints and the bag-ball. �You can wash
in the corner. You will find a shower there. What have you learned in today�s
class?� Still store in her chin Ann could only with difficulties utter her
reply: �That I would not end up at the end of your noose because I don�t use
drugs.� The guards left the room shaking their heads. Ann took a shower. Never
had she felt so dirty. She realized that she never would be able to wash the
events of the evening away. So she decided to go to sleep at last.




6.
Day in court

&nbsp;

10 a.m. the door opened and two female guards entered. �Madam.
You are going to court today. Here are some fresh clothes.�

&nbsp;

Soon she was dressed in a fresh
boiler suit and her restraint was put on. They took her to the truck and they
began a drive downtown to the courthouse.

&nbsp;

Well arrived she followed into a
courtroom where her lawyer and the representative from the embassy was waiting.
They hugged her. She was not able to return it because of her restraints. The
helped her to her seat where they waited for the judge to appear.

&nbsp;

The judge entered and asked the
prosecutor to present its case.

&nbsp;

�First we have to regret that the
primary charge of battery have been redrawn by the airline company. They had
made their own inquiry, which has shown that there was no battery. It was just
a bitter employee and a simple head butt made by a woman which suddenly was
woken from her sleep.�

&nbsp;

�The second charge we also would
like to redraw. Research of the drug test has so far not shown any sign of an
illegal drug. It is unlikely that the test would end up being positive.�

&nbsp;

�But she resisted arrest and that
means jail time for a month. This charge we would be upheld.�

&nbsp;

Ann�s lawyer protested: �But that
charge would not have arisen if the false charge of battery would have been
introduced in the first place.�

&nbsp;

The judge said: �I have to think
about it. I have to read about similar cases. This court would take a rest
until 2 p.m. Then I would rule on whether the third charge should be upheld.�

&nbsp;

The three of them went to a small
room. �We have difficult case. The police seem not in the mood of dropping the
last charge. The airline company has made them look like a fool. If I know my
law book, they also would be lucky to achieve a verdict in their favor. It
would mean a month in prison.�

&nbsp;

Ann was in despair. How could have
come to this?

&nbsp;

The door opened and a man came in.
�Hello. I am Mr. Nelson. I am the manager of the purse firm. I think that you
had a photo shooting to attend. What is the problem? We are loosing a lot of
cash with a crew without a model.� The manager was brought up to date. �It does
not look good. Can we reach a deal with the judge? We need Ann out to the shoot
tomorrow.� �I must think� the lawyer replied.

&nbsp;

At 2 p.m.
they were back in the courtroom. Soon after the judge
entered. �First I will role on the charge of resisting arrest. I will
uphold the charge. I would also like to pass a verdict today. May the lawyers
approach the bench?�

&nbsp;

Ann�s attorney was first. �Miss. August is needed at a photo shoot. We all know how much our country is
depending of tourist income. I have also learned that Miss. August is quite known around the world. Every major newspaper and
TV-stations all have the story of her arrest. It would be a threat to our
production of computer keyboard where we are the leading nation in the world.�

&nbsp;

The prosecutor came with an outburst.
�But we can not just allow her to leave. She had committed a crime. If we let
her go, the morale of this country would fall.�

&nbsp;

The judge said: �Who is the new guy
at her side.� �It is the manager from Denmark, whom she is working for at the present.� �Call him up here.�

&nbsp;

The manager approached the bench. He
was asked what kind of pictures which they were going to take. The judge came
with a suggestion. �I would pass a verdict of corporal punishment but only if
she accept it in advance. Otherwise the verdict would be imprisonment of 30
days. It is her choice.�

The lawyer came back to Ann and she
was told of the two choices, she could decide between. �What does corporal
punishment mean in this country. We don�t have
something like this in Denmark.� �It means blows to your buttock by the use of a rattan cane. It is a
very severe punishment. 2 blows are often measured alike with a month of
prison. We have however agreed that because of your appearance in the
advertisement, you would not be exposed to the full force of caning. The caning
officer must keep his arm still, while he serve you
the blows and only use his wrist. We call it Syariah whipping.�

&nbsp;

�I would take the corporal
punishment. I am ashamed that I led my job down. We need to finish the photo
shooting. Inform the judge that I take the choice of corporal punishment.�

&nbsp;

The lawyer went back to the judge
and he read the verdict. �Miss. Ann August. You have been found guilty of resisting arrest. You sentence is to
receive 6 blows from the rattan cane in a Syariah manner. When the blows have
been passed, you have paid your debt to our society. Take her away.�

&nbsp;

Ann thanked the judge for a fair
ruling. When the guards came for her, the manager asked if he and the man from
the embassy could follow her to the prison and be present when the sentence
would be passed on. It was no problem.

&nbsp;

When the judge came back into his
office, he sat down and took a deep breath. It had been a difficult trail. The
totally messed-up case from the prosecutor could have made it impossible to
hand out a fair verdict, which would have put enormous pressure on the country.
This is best for all parts.




7. The sentence.

&nbsp;

They were followed out to the truck.
�We are going direct from the prison to the photo shoot, so we can avoid the
journalists. There are a lot of them just waiting for a good story. But the
police had managed to keep your whereabouts a secret.�

&nbsp;

They arrived at the prison and were
followed to a waiting. Ann was released from her restraints and told to
undress. Instead a funny kind of clothing was produced. �Take this on!� When she was dressed so experienced that it was made of some padded
canvas, which covered her entire body like a long coat. But there was
cut a square in the suit so her buttock was fully exposed. �How is this going
to work?� �The canvas is going to protect your kidneys and other vital organs.
The caning officer is an expert. Every blow would be served precise so the same
spot would not be hit twice.� They sat down and waited.

&nbsp;

The door was open and two guards
came inside. �Madam. It is time for your punishment.
Follow us.� The manager took her hand and said: �We would be right at your side
to the finish.� They all followed the guards to a large hall.

&nbsp;

In the center of the hall there was
a large A-shape frame. Ann was led to the frame and told to place her hands
near some leather cuffs at the top of the frame. Her hands were soon fastened.
Also her legs were cuffed. A man approached and presented himself as a doctor.
�I am going to check up on your health after the punishment. A have this
bit-gag I would like of offer you while the sentence
is served.�

&nbsp;

Ann took the gag. �Place your head
under this padded beam. You don�t want to see the blows coming.�

&nbsp;

Ann waited. Then she heard someone
moving behind her. She was beginning to sweat a lot and became nervous. 

&nbsp;

�1!� Suddenly she heard swishing
sound. CRACK!!. She peed by surprise. After a second
her bum began to sting. �I am going to die.� She tried to say but only mumbled
sounds were heard due to the gag.

�2!� Soon after
the second blow came. 

�3!� Then the
third. Her body was now shivering. She was in some kind of trance. 

�4!� The blow brought her back to
reality.

�5!� She could not feel her behind.
The pain was intense and all over body. The doctor said �Hold on. You are
almost finished.�

��6!� Her punishment was over. She passed out.




8. The photo shoot

&nbsp;

When Ann woke she was lying on her
stomach. The doctor was applying some kind of ointment to her behind. It hurt
so much. Her manager took her hand. �Relax. The skin is not broken in any
places. There are purple stripes but these we can handle with our computer
programs.�

&nbsp;

Ann was helped on her feet. �It
stings. I would not be able to sit.� The guard came with a box. �Madam. We have a some new clothes
provided by your work, so you can be smuggled out in the laundry truck.�

&nbsp;

Ann said goodbye to the guards and
lied down on the floor in the back of the laundry truck. They left the prison
and the truck drove outside the town where it stopped at some point. �We have
arranged for a meeting with one of our own cars.�

&nbsp;

As they took their seats in the car,
Ann complained as she sat in her seat. She has never been disciplined as a
child, so she was unfamiliar with having a sore buttock.

&nbsp;

Well arrived at the place for the photo
shoot, she took a bath and began to dress for the job. �She is so professional.
When one thinks of all these thing, she had endured,
it is remarkable that she just can go on.�

&nbsp;

Soon all the photos
was in the box and Ann was told that she could have the rest of the week
of, so her sore buttock could bare the long journey back to Denmark. Sitting down 10 hours in the plane demanded some rest before she could
handle it.

&nbsp;

Ann took the whole week on her
stomach before returning to Denmark. When she was leaving the country, she flew back on a different
airplane company. She would never once again fly using MartyAir.




9. Aftermath

&nbsp;

Well returned to Denmark, she discovered that a lot of work was needed restoring her reputation.
She attended numerous TV-show explaining of the
negative drug test and false accusations of battery made against her. Everyone
seems to compare the life of a supermodel with cocaine use.

&nbsp;

Eventually she gave up her career
and moved back to her birth-town. Her story would become an example for young
Danes making it an example of what could happen to a young Dane if he/she would
seek a career outside Denmark.

&nbsp;

In Denmark as a civilized society ones upbringing and social status does have quite a significance of how one person are treated when some
charges are made against one. Danish courts are fast ruling that the name of
the defendant cannot be named for legal reasons if the defendant belongs to the
upper class. Often the entire verdict would become a secret for all time
including that the name of both victims and defendant must not be mentioned
ever in such cases.

&nbsp;

However in the defendant belongs to
the lower classes they must endure that their name would be dragged trough dirt
during trial and often endure prison in isolation for months making them so
sick that is does not matter if they ends up being found guilty or not. This is
the very factor, which makes Danes work so hard and intense comparing with
other countries.

&nbsp;

Ann learned her lesson and took up a
job as a secretary in a local factory. She does however still model part time
but only in Denmark.
