Barbarian Queen:

Captives of Lord Arrakur

&nbsp;

A story set in an alternate universe.

We all know, that Amethea and her friends overcame all
the trials and hardships. They triumphed over suppression, injustice, rape and
torture.

They defeated Lord Arrakur and ended his merciless
rule.

&nbsp;

But what if...

&nbsp;

They failed?

&nbsp;

What if the capture of Taramis,
Estrild, Tianara and Amethea was not the rebellions darkest hour, which
preceded the dawn of victory?

&nbsp;

What if this was the beginning of a different kind of
tale.

A tale of four woman-warriors, who fell into the hands
of a ruler of utter cruelty and recklessness. 

A ruler with a fondness for inflicting pain, dealing
out suffering and crushing women beneath his heel.

&nbsp;

Now hear a tale of suffering unheard of...

Of tortures untold of...

Of cruelty undreamed of...

Hear the tale of proud Amethea

The bravest of all...

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Captives of Lord Arrakur 

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Chapter
One

&nbsp;

The
Tools of Pain

&nbsp;

Amethea couldn't move.

As much as she tried to, she couldn't.

The iron shackles around her wrists and ankles were
tightly and secured her beauteous form on the rack.

Her body was covered with sweat, glistening in the
lights of the torches at the dungeon walls.

In addition she wore an iron collar around her neck.
It wasn�t connected to the rack itself, although
there were four iron rings attached to the collar - two at his side, one in
front and the fourth at the back of it. Right now, the only purpose of the
collar was apparently to make breathing a bit harder for her.

The rack was positioned at the far end of the spacious
chamber. Since the apparatus was standing almost upright, keeping Amethea in an
almost standing position, the warrioress had a good
view of the chamber.

What she saw made her skin crawl and her heart sink.
Of some of the devices she saw, she had heard of before. 

There were pillories and thick wooden poles set in the
ground, with iron cuffs attached to them. Chains were hanging from the stone
ceiling, swinging in the air and making a continuos
clanking sound. There was an odd, T-shaped wooden table with iron cuffs on its
surface as well. There were braziers, some of them filled with heated coals.
And there was a seemingly endless variety of whips, clubs and tongs hanging all
over the walls.

And there were more devices, which Amethea had never
seen or heard of before in her life.

But no one had to explain the purpose of those strange
objects to her. Everything around her served one, and only one purpose.

To inflict pain.

And it had been made clear to Amethea, that she had
much... very, very much pain coming to her.

Amethea had fought many battles before in her life and
everyone had seen her as the winner. But she knew, that she was about to fight
the most terrifying and powerful enemy of all - pain. 

Amethea had been brought down here for torture. 

Arrakur had given her the choice. Telling him about
the rebels and become his newest whore... or finding out, how painful it was to
oppose him. 

She chose the latter, fought him, and even wounded
him. 

Alas, the joy of this small victory faded quickly, as
four guards dragged her fighting, spitting and cursing down the stairs to the
lower dungeons beneath her cell.

For as brave as Amethea was, she knew that there was
nothing worse that men could do to men, than to torture them.

The guards had knocked at a small wooden door, belying
the vastness of the torture chamber behind it and a low voice has told them to
come in.

They had done so and Amethea had had her first look at
the chamber and its horrors. She had also had her first of many hateful looks
at the master of this evil domain.

A tiny, humpbacked man, wearing a flat leather hat and
a strange set of glasses on his nose. He had let his gaze wander up and down
her body, hovering over her naked breasts for a while.

Then he had looked into her eyes, meeting her defiant
gaze with a wicked smile.

&quot;Hmmmmm... a feisty
one. What does Lord Arrakur want to know from this one?&quot; he asked one of
the guards.

&quot;A rebel, Master Zohar.&quot; One of the guards
replied.

&quot;Lord Arrakur wants to know where the rest of
that rebel scum is hiding.&quot;

Zohar�s eyes wandered from Amethea�s face back to her exposed breasts and sighed.

&quot;Almost a pity. For a moment I hoped, this one
was... ah well. Tie her to that rack, there!&quot;

The guards complied and fastened the struggling woman
to the vertical rack at the end of the torture chamber.

After Zohar had checked the bonds and convinced
himself of that Amethea could not free herself from them, he dismissed the
guards.

Amethea was now in chains in front of the tiny man.
Due to her struggles, her leather brassiere and her loincloth has been ripped
from her. All that stood between her and total nakedness was a tiny, black
crotch-strap she wore.

&quot;Hmmmm!&quot; Zohar
purred, savoring her beauty.

&quot;A feisty, lovely rebel-whore! I don`t suppose you will tell me what we want to know just
yet. Don`t you?&quot;

Amethea did not even look at him. She stared at the
ceiling, instead.

&quot;No, I suppose you wont!&quot; the torturer said.
He stepped closer and Amethea could feel the heat of his ridiculously shaped
body against her leg, felt his hand tenderly caressing the inside of her thigh.


The sensation of his fingers on her made her skin
crawl and she struggled against the cuffs and chains holding her in place. Her
instincts yelled at her to kill that little pig right now. But the bonds
condemned her to endure his sickening touch.

&quot;Three kinds of people get send down here.&quot;
He said.

&quot;And I hoped for a moment, you would be one of
the third kind. Would you like to know why?&quot;

Amethea did not answer.

&quot;What a tight-lipped little slut you are. No
matter, I will tell you anyway: I love pain!&quot;

For a second, Amethea could not help giving him a
quick, wondering look.

&quot;Oh, not my own, mind you!&quot; the torturer
said, chuckling.

&quot;That would be rather sick, don�t
you think?!&quot;

&quot;Oh no, its the pain of others, that I adore. And
I thoroughly enjoy causing pain. Inflicting pain. You will find out all about
that any minute now.&quot;

Now, a thin layer of cold sweat was transpiring on Amethea�s forehead. 

&quot;How does my fondness for inflicting pain relate
to the three kind of prisoners being send down here? Well, I�ll
tell you, my sweet.

The first kind are those, who do have secrets Lord
Arrakur wants to know about and sooner or later tell me everything they know. 

It is enjoyable to make them talk, of course. But as
soon as they have given up, they usually get executed quickly at the town�s square. You might belong to that kind, but I would
be somewhat disappointed.&quot;

His breathing deepened somewhat, as his hand began
kneading her thigh with increasing force.

&quot;The second kind, now. They are a lot more
interesting. And I would welcome you being one of them. So please, don�t disappoint me!&quot;

He smiled at her, a smile bereft of any kindness
whatsoever.

&quot;The second kind are those, who are suspected to
know some secrets Lord Arrakur whishes to learn about - but are totally
innocent. For that means, that I can torture them, for as long as Lord Arrakur
remains suspicious of them and orders the questioning to continue.&quot;

He moved even closer and, to her horror and utter disgust,
Amethea could feel his hard, erected member through his breechcloths on her
naked thigh.

&quot;Ooooohh... and you can
believe me, my pretty one: If you don�t know
anything, if you can�t tell me anything that could
satisfy Lord Arrakur�s curiosity... then you will
spend days, perhaps weeks in my capable hands until I have broken you so
completely, that there will be nothing left of your will or strength.

Oh yes, I do hope that you don�t
know anything!&quot;

He had begun rubbing his hard manhood against her
thigh, as he already contemplated the ordeals his newest captive would be going
through.

&quot;Alas, being suspected as a rebel, you are no
prisoner of the third kind. Those are my favorite trait. Can you guess
why?&quot;

Amethea had closed her eyes and tried to block out the
vile creature�s voice, tried not to comprehend the
words he spoke. But she failed in both.

&quot;The third kind are those, whom Lord Arrakur had
sentenced to death. Sentenced to be tortured to death. And you can believe me:
there can be no slower death than here in my chamber. Such a feisty one as you,
I could surely torture each and every day and still keep alive for even a
month.

Oh, I wonder when would you pride dissolve? After a
week? Yes, even you would beg for mercy after a week. And when might you start
to beg for death? Two weeks? Three?

How I would love to find that out.&quot;

Amethea�s mind was numbed with
horror. Oh yes, she knew about torture. Although she had been spared it so far,
she knew what torture meant. 

But nothing she knew could have prepared her for this
nightmarish ordeal awaiting her.

What worse could possibly have happened to her than
this? With a sting of panic she realized, that she was about to be tortured by
a merciless bastard, who felt &quot;that&quot; pleasure when inflicting pain.

If the devil would choose a hell for women, he would
choose this.

&quot;Now!&quot; the humpbacked Zohar said, stepping
away from his newest prey and looking at her trough slit eyes.

&quot;It�s about the time,
the two of us get started. Since you are not the third kind, I expect you to be
the second kind, at least.&quot;

He lifted his right hand, his forefinger pointing in
the air like a teacher lecturing his pupil.

&quot;Don�t you dare
disappoint me, whore! Don�t you dare to talk!&quot;

He kept giggling, as he started to work on the rack
and Amethea kept staring in the air, her check-bones working underneath her
skin.

She heard a winch screeching and from above she saw a
strange object attached to a chain descending down on her. It resembled a metal
glove, shaped like a fist. The forefinger of the glove, however, pointed down
at her. 

As the device continued it`s
descent, Amethea saw that the glove�s forefinger
ended in a very sharp needle.

Amethea also realized that the glove was descending on
her unprotected chest, aiming for her naked, exposed breasts.

She swallowed and wondered, how long she would hold
out.

&nbsp;

&quot;I�m not here to
torture you. We have a man, who does that!&quot;

Tianara felt the heat of the torch held closely to her
face changing it�s position from her left cheek to
her right one, forcing her to turn her head from side to side.

Kaltar, the fat general of
Lord Arrakur�s guards smiled mischievously and
lowered the torch. Not to give his prisoner some relief but merely to let the
torch travel over her barely covered bosom. 

Not burning her... yet. Just letting her feel the fire�s heat and let her wonder just when he would let the
torch kiss her young flesh.

&quot;We have a man, who does THAT. And I am trying to
keep you from having to meet him.&quot;

He moistened his dry lips with his tongue as he watched
the black-haired girl struggle against her bonds, pushing herself against the
pole at her back in a hopeless attempt to escape the heat of the torch.

&quot;I just want a little information.&quot; He said.

Tianara stared back at him over the dancing flames of
the torch hovering over her breasts, almost singing her mammal flesh with
fierceness in her eyes.

&quot;Other lives are more important then mine!&quot;
she replied proudly.

She knew, that there was little left for her to do
than to display her bravery to her captors. She and her friends have entered
the very lair of their enemy in their quest to save their people. They had
gambled... and lost. Now, all there was left to do, was to stand up against
them and protect their allies, the rebels hiding in the catacombs beneath the
city, by taking their secrets into the grave.

&quot;It�s not death that
you face.&quot; The captain said, relishing in his domination over this
beautiful wench. 

&quot;It�s a great deal of
discomfort, while you are still alive. You really don�t
want to get sent downstairs... believe me!&quot; The last words, he almost
purred.

He knew of the things, which could and surely would be
done to this one. He very well knew of Lord Arrakur�s
cruelty and the inventiveness of his torture-master, Zohar. And he most
certainly shared their adoration for seeing helpless captives suffer.

He often thanked the gods for including pain into the
creation of humans. Pain caused fear. Pain caused obedience. Pain caused
captives to break down... to betray their comrades.

And pain caused pleasure.

In fact, he knew of no greater pleasure then
dispensing pain. It always caused his belly to churn and his member to harden.

Just like this one in front of him supplied him with a
feeling of gratification and raunchiness at the same time.

Just a few hours longer, and he could conscientiously
report to Lord Arrakur, that the black-haired slut was as stubborn as the
fair-haired one. Surely his master would order the torture of this one. And if
he were lucky, he would be commanded to carry out the questioning in the lower
dungeons for himself - since Zohar would surely be busy with the fair-haired
whore.

Yes, he mused, watching the panting, sweat-glistening
captive in front of him...

Life is good.

&nbsp;

The needle-sharp end of the metal glove dug into Amethea�s left teat.

A sharp, piercing pain shot through her breast and
made her cry out.

Involuntarily she tried to move her breast away from
the needle, digging into her breast. And instantly her body was stretched a
little more.

The rack she was trapped on was an ingenious device
indeed. 

Her ankles were fettered to the lower end of the rack
with thick, heavy leather cords. Each ankle at the opposite edge of the wooden
table-like device, she was laying on, which caused her legs to be spread wide
open. Her wrists were manacled with similar leather straps to a heavy chain at
the top of the rack. This chain went over a slick-oiled metal cogwheel at the
top of the table. From the other end of the chain, behind the rack, there hung
a huge boulder of some 250 pounds pulling at the chain with all it�s weight.

The boulder�s weight would
cause the cogwheel to spin and thereby pulling the chain tighter and tighter.
Since Amethea was tied to that chain, her body would be drawn tight as well, as
if her body itself was a link in the chain carrying the monstrous, heavy
boulder. The weight would have strained her body far beyond the snapping point,
of course. Literally tearing her flesh, tendons and muscles apart in an
instance. 

But a tiny detail prevented her from being torn apart.
Which were two steel rods, both attached to the top of the rack and arching
down on the gearwheel, their sharp ends infixing themselves into the teeth at
each side of the cogwheel. As long as both were holding the cogwheel, the wheel
was carrying the weight of the boulder.

Unfortunately the rack-table was laying on a huge
steel axis, making the table teetering slightly, unless Amethea held herself
absolutely still on the table. As soon as she made the slightest move, the
rack-table waggled and the steel rods at the top lost their grip on the
cogwheel. 

With a number of menacing clicking sounds, the chain
was drawn tighter by the boulder�s immense weight and
Amethea was stretched and racked a little more. 

Already her body was stretched painfully tight.
Muscles and tendons screamed in protest against the strain put upon them. But
if she managed to keep the rack in balance, she avoided the strain to increase.

But Zohar was not about to allow her this respite. The
last detail of this percular torture was the metal
glove, hanging from a chain above her breasts. It was positioned exactly over
her left breast and the sharp needle protruding from it�s
metal forefinger was thereby positioned exactly over her left teat.

Now all Zohar had to do, was to lower the metal glove
by giving the chain it was attached to some slack and the needle would prick Ametheas nipple.

However regal in her determination not to move, the
jabbing pain would cause her to wince and thereby trigger the apparatus`
horrible assault on her tender body.

Cold sweat covered her forehead and her breathing came
through clenched teeth. Arms and legs quivered from the strain and her belly
felt like being torn apart. Still she had neither spoken a word nor given voice
to the true amount of her suffering. 

Only short grunts and sobs of pain escaped her throat
regularly, as her breast were stabbed again and again. 

Her torturer watched her suffering with keen interest
and visible delight.

And as if he needed to make up for Amethea�s
contempt-filled silence, he spoke to her constantly.

&quot;You must learn not to struggle!&quot; he said,
as if lecturing a dim-witted child. 

&quot;If it hurts, you have only yourself to
blame.&quot; 

Even if Amethea would choose to talk to her tormentor,
she would never grace that infamous remark with an answer.

&quot;Everytime you move,
the machine tightens. So you don�t want to move
anymore than you have to.&quot;

He gave a sigh of satisfaction and regarded the
interior of his torture chamber,�
inspecting his horrifying collection of instruments and devices.

&quot;I made that all myself!&quot; he pointed out
with pride. &quot;It�s very ingenious, don�t you think?&quot;

All Amethea did in response was to look at him with
utter contempt. 

&quot;Oooh! You don�t look like you appreciate science.&quot; Her torturer
said in his maddening high-pitched tone. He approached her with a mug filled
with water. He held the mug teasingly before Amethea�s
dried lips.

&quot;Drink some.&quot; He offered his captive. 

The warrior woman hadn�t had
something to drink since this morning, when she and her friends entered the rebel�s hideout. She was thirsting badly and involuntarily
tried to reach the sweet wetness inside the mug by raising her head. She even
managed to move her head without triggering the rack but Zohar rewarded her
effort by pulling the mug away. 

&quot;Say please!&quot; he requested, depriving
Amethea the relief of quenching her thirst.

Amethea�s head fell back on
the surface of the rack and she turned her face away determined not to beg for
the water.

&quot;No manners at all!&quot; Zohar complained.
&quot;Well�I�m not one who tortures somebody.&quot;
He moved the mug back within Amethea�s reach. Despite
herself, she raised her head again�her lips almost reaching the edge of the
mug, almost tasting the sweet, clean liquid inside.

Grinning viciously, Zohar twisted the mug. He slowly
spilled the water on the woman�s chest, making her
groan in frustration as not a single drop of the water had reached her lips.

Why do you do that? Amethea admonished
herself. Hurting you already gives him pleasure. Do not add to this swine�s gratification by degrading yourself before him!

&quot;You must learn to say please!&quot; her
tormentor said in a donnish cadence. 

&quot;You must learn to say all sorts of things.&quot;
Zohar continued. &quot;Like how you got into the city. And what you came here
for. And where your rebel friends are.&quot;

NO! Her mind cried out. Hold
on! Don�t tell him anything. Fight it and find a way
to get out of this hellhole. That�s the only chance
we got, if we want to survive this.

&quot;Ahem�please let me interrupt.&quot;

This wasn�t the voice of her
tormentor. The door to the torture chamber had been opened and Arrakur had
entered. Amethea couldn�t help wince as she saw him
in the company of her sister Taramis. She was
scantily dressed, as it was becoming for a slavegirl
of Lord Arrakur. And Amethea had no doubt whatsoever, that her sister has
served as a female slave in that monster�s bed.

Zohar cranked a winch at the side of the rack and with
a sickening cracking sound the cogwheel was revolving half a turn before
stopping. The boulder�s weight was pulling Amethea�s body another inch apart and making her cry out in
terrible pain - for the first time since the torture had started.

Arrakur knew, that Zohar intended to demonstrate his captive�s suffering for his master. Partly for showing his
own effort in making this whore talk, partly because he knew that Lord Arrakur
was just as fond of watching a woman suffer as he was.

And indeed, as Arrakur had entered the torture
chamber, the sight of Amethea, almost nude, tied to that rack had generated
that well known pleasure in his belly he felt when watching a defenseless
creature suffer at his command. And although he had spend himself inside his
newest whore quite thoroughly, he felt his cock rising behind his gown yet
again as he listened to her agonized scream.

&quot;She still has nothing to say to us?&quot; he
said, taking a step closer.

&quot;She is a strong one.&quot; The torturer
conceded. And Amethea proved that fact by suppressing any further breach of
self-control. By suppressing any more sounds of pain escaping her throat and
glaring at Lord Arrakur with utter contempt.

The tyrant merely smiled knowingly at the impotent
fury of his captive.

&quot;You have broken stronger.&quot; He noted.
Casually he turned to his newest pet-whore a bit suspicious.

&quot;You don�t know her�do
you?!&quot; he asked Taramis. The dim-witted girl
looked back at him fearfully, her gaze briefly shifting to her tortured sister
on the rack. When she looked back at her master with all the credibility of a
child not lying to her father.

&quot;No.&quot; she said, chewing at her thumb.

Satisfied by this Arrakur addressed his torture-master
again. 

&quot;I expect answers in the morning!&quot; he said
turning about his heel and leaving the chamber. Taramis
looked briefly at Amethea. Her sister returned her gaze and Taramis
was not sure what to read in it. She did not understand all of what was going
on around her but she understood this much: her sister was being hurt terribly.
And if the man, whom�s bed she shared, found out of
her being Amethea�s sister she would also be hurt.
And Taramis did not want to be hurt ever again.

So she left her sister without another word, hurrying
to catch up with her master.

Amethea fought hard to suppress the tears, which
threatened to fill her eyes.

She wanted Argan back. And she wanted to protect her
sister. And look what was happening to them. Argan was fighting for his life as
Arrakur�s gladiator. He could die any second without
her knowing. And her sister was Arrakur�s whore. She
refused to think about what that pig was doing to her in bed, while she was
down here being tortured.

I have to get out of here. I have to. Somehow, anyhow
get out of this hellhole.

Was it coincidence or a generous gesture of the Gods?
Amethea did not know and did not care so much. What she did realize was, that a
link in the chain holding both her ankles down at the bottom end of the rack
was broken.

Perhaps the link had been insufficiently forged and
probably countless victims having been ripped apart on this rack had put so
much strain on the chain that it might tear apart anytime now. The question was
whether it would be the chain or the muscles, tendons and the spine of Amethea
that would tear first.

The torturer stepped in front of her again. Zohar felt
fresh excitement, knowing that Lord Arrakur would not make another visit to the
torture chamber tonight. 

That meant the two of them would be undisturbed until
morning and Zohar had some very special plans for his captive. After all, a
slut of such beauty was seldom in his domain and he did not wanted to miss the
least bit of pleasure this whore could give him besides suffering pain. 

He was a man after all, wasn�t
he.

&quot;You heard his excellency!&quot; he purred in his
infuriating tone of disapproval. As if Amethea was a lazy pupil who was too
stupid to understand his teacher�s lessons.

As if he was saying: You dumb whore. All you have
to do is to tell us about the rebels. And then we won�t
torture you anymore. We�ll just make you a slavegirl for our master�s
pleasure. And you will serve him as long as he finds you amusing. And then�well
the gladiators` brothel perhaps. Or you will be used up as a whore for the
guards. That can�t be all that bad now, can it? But
no�you want to fight us? Then fight for all you are worth. I`ll
break you anyway in the end. You�ll have gained
nothing except serving MY pleasure!

He raised his hand to grope Amethea�s
right breast. With a snarl that evolved into a battle cry Amethea`s
head leaped forth, her teeth creaked. Zohar barely managed to get his hand away
from her breast, before she could sink her teeth in it.

A little taken aback, he quickly recovered as he noted
with satisfaction that her attack had loosened the rack once more and increased
the strain on her body even another agonizing bit. 

And he also noted with gratification that the
fair-haired whore could no longer hold back a gut wrenching sobbing of pain and
despair.

Won�t be
long until you talk�or beg for mercy, slut. He said to himself.

&nbsp;

Lord Arrakur rested on his seat in the arena and
watched the bloody battle down below in the pit.

Two gladiators were fighting against each other to the
death. The victor was selected to fight at the anniversary celebration, which
were to be held in three days.� The dead
one was carried out of the arena and another pair of gladiators entered, knowing
that only one of them would leave the pit alive. And so it went on. 

Arrakur enjoyed the spectacle. Still, he had some
regrets about leaving the interrogation of the blonde beauty to Zohar alone. He
himself enjoyed participating in the torture of his captives. Especially such a
feisty and pretty one as her. 

But in the end, the selection of the gladiators for
the celebration was as important to him. Besides, he had given Zohar specific
orders concerning that blonde whore.

&quot;Find out, if she knows anything about the
rebels. But see to it, that you don�t destroy her
beauty just yet. I have additional plans for that one!&quot;

Oh yes, Zohar would make her talk. Or ascertain, that
she does not know anything about that rebel-scum. And after that, he would take
care of her personally. He would break her completely. He�d
make her crawl at his feet and serve his every whim. And then�then he would
have her very, very slowly tortured to death.

As he watched the desperate men beneath him fighting
for their lifes, he leisurely contemplated the many
ways he would make the blonde whore suffer for his pleasure.

&nbsp;

&quot;I really am ahead of my time!&quot; Zohar mused,
regarding his arsenal of fiendish devices with pride. Amethea merely moaned on
the rack. He had secured the chain holding the boulder in the air, so that
allowed her to move on the rack as little as her bonds permitted her. The
strain on her body was still considerably painful. And Amethea was increasing
the pain to herself by pulling at the weakened chain at the base of the rack,
whenever her torturer paid no full attention to her.

He did so now, so Amethea halted her efforts again.

&quot;You must be very proud.&quot; He kept teasing
her. &quot;You are making a contribution to science!&quot; The disdain in her
eyes made it perfectly clear to him what she thought about the science of torturing
women. He merely grinned and approached his defenseless captive. Amethea tried
to steel herself against the inevitable that was about to happen. A moment
before, Zohar had ripped away the black crotch-strap she wore. Although it was
a tiny piece of garment, it still humiliated her to be deprived of it. Now she
was completely naked and her legs were spread apart sufficiently for her
torturer to gaze at her disposed and unprotected womanhood.

Unfortunately, to gaze was not enough for him. He had
taken of his breechcloths and exposed his hard and throbbing member. He moved
closer and closer, his stiff cock pointing straight up at her. He took a step
up, standing on the beam at the base of the rack, which supported Amethea�s feet as well. 

She felt her stomach knotting and bile gathering in
her throat as the tip of his penis, hardened by her suffering, touched her
labia, forcing her dry, reluctant lips aside and forcing it�s
way into her belly. 

She made an indefinable sound of utter disgust, as he
pushed his cock inside her silky depths. She doubled her efforts in tearing the
chain below her apart. It just wouldn�t give in. All
she could think of was:

Break! Break, damn you! Gods, he is inside me! INSIDE
ME!! Let me off this thing!!

Her rapist was in no hurry. Zohar took his time
sliding his cock back and forth inside her with maddening leisure. He wanted to
savor every second of this. 

Better appreciate my self-discipline, you slut! He
thought, fucking his captive slowly but constantly. After I spend myself
inside you, I intend to use some interesting toys on you - down there! You�ll beg me to put my manhood back inside you, for sure!

&quot;Just a little more, my sweet!&quot; he teased,
feeling his balls swelling and gradually increasing the speed of his thrusts. He
watched in fascination as each thrust made her breasts jiggle and listened to
her moans accompanying his each and every intrusion inside her. As determined
and feisty as she was: that sound was something she just couldn�t
suppress. 

&quot;I�m not quite there,
yet!&quot; he said. Gods, what a pleasure it was mastering this beautiful
whore. Play with her ability to feel pain, and then play with her ability to
feel pleasure. Doing to her whatever he wanted to. Zohar was in ecstasy.

SNAP!!

For the first fraction of a second, Amethea couldn�t believe it: the chain was broken. Her legs were
free. In a split-second decision, she did the first thing she could think of.
She wrapped her legs around the hip of her rapist, trapping him inside a
vice-like grip. It was amazing to her, that she could muster that much strength
in her fatigued muscles, but the desire to punish this swine fueled her will. 

Zohar stared into her baleful eyes in shock. He
realized that he had lost control over her in the passing of a second. She
began to tighten the embrace of her legs around his waist and started to cause
- pain. His cock was still inside her, but it quickly softened and glided out
of her as she squeezed his hip tighter and tighter and�tighter.

&quot;Wait�wait�.you�re
moving away!&quot; he complained, then shouted: &quot;Stop squeezing!&quot;

Amethea had to take pain and rape from him, but there
was no way in all the hells of the netherworlds that she would take orders from
him now.

Zohar felt cold sweat on his forehead as the squeeze
evolved from painful to insufferable. She would break his hips, he realized. He�d be mutilated for the rest of his life - if he�d survive her attack at all.

&quot;To tight!&quot; he wailed. &quot;To tight!! To tiiiiight!&quot;

Amethea wanted to punish him, like she wanted nothing
else in her life before. She wanted to pay back the pain he had caused her�give
him a taste of what he had done to her as long as she couldn�t
defend herself. Even the touch of his slackened member against her labia gave
her a feeling of triumph. Now she was in control.

&quot;Free my hands!&quot; she commanded, giving him
another squeeze. He screamed in fresh pain.

&quot;I�will! I will!!&quot; he babbled his trembling
hands rising towards the top of the rack.

Yes, free my hands you little maggot. And as soon as I
am free, I�ll make you curse the day you were born,
whatever vile creature gave birth to you. You raped me, you bastard. You swine.
I�ll rip it off of you. By the Gods, I swear I�ll rip it off!!

But instead of freeing her wrists, Zohar�s
hands halted on the iron collar she wore and twisted the iron ring in front of
it. He frantically turned the ring and Amethea realized to her horror that the
collar quickly tightened around her neck. The collar was choking her, quickly
depriving her of oxygen.

She squeezed as hard as she could making Zohar almost
weeping in pain, but the lack of air already pulled down her resources of
strength.

She gasped for air, as the collar got tighter and
tighter, like a fish out of the water. 

Zohar felt her grip around his waist slacking with
painful slowness. Nevertheless, the pain eased and finally her legs dropped
down as she fell unconscious. 

Zohar panted, still standing in front of her his
shrunken member pressed against her slit. He felt an outrage, he�d never felt before. That slut had attacked him.

She had caused him PAIN. HIM! 

He could simply let her die like that. Being choked to
death by the collar. She would simply not wake up from unconsciousness and die.


Of course he opened the collar again. He held his palm
against her open mouth in order to ascertain whether she was breathing or not.
She was. 

She would stay unconscious for a while, though. Of
that he was certain enough to free her hands from the top of the rack. Amethea
glided of the rack like a puppet whose strings had been cut. He watched her for
a moment. Then he pulled his booted foot back and kicked her viciously in the
belly.

She only grunted. That convinced him that he did not
need for calling the guards to prepare Amethea for the next stage of their
business. He would do so himself. 

He dragged her along on the rough floor of the chamber
towards the T-shaped wooden table. 

You think you could get away from me, didn�t you? Whore, I�ll make you
pay dearly for that. The rack was just the slightest of starts for you my
pretty one. 

Now, it�s going to become
painful.

Barbarian Queen:

Captives of Lord Arrakur

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Chapter Two

&nbsp;

Deeper into Pain

&nbsp;

Estrild
was kneeling on the cushioned floor of one of the separees of the gladiator�s
brothel. Her hands were tied behind her back with leather cords and her belly
was resting on a stool. Her sparse clothing had been ripped from her body and
she was naked except from the bracelets on her wrists and ankles, the golden
circlets on her upper arms and the bells tied into her full, brown hair.

She
had been so close. She had seen Argan at the corner of the great hall of the
brothel but before she could call for him a beefy gladiator with a bald head
and a thick black moustache had grabbed her and dragged her into this separee
he had reserved for himself and his friends. She had resisted and he had
slapped her in the face a few times. Then he had tied her hands behind her
backs and thrown her down on the floor and raped her with devastating, brutal
thrusts inside her. 

After
that his friends had joined him. Guzzling wine and offending her with obnoxious
remarks, they had forced her to dance for them. Estrild was not trained as a
dancing girl, so her performance couldn�t have been worse even when her hands
would not have been tied behind her back. But evidently, her struggles to
please were as excitingly zestful to the men as the performance of the most
beauteous and shameless dancing girl could have been.

Then
they had thrown her on the stool, spread her legs apart and started to rape
her. There were seven of them in the beginning, but to Estrild�s dismay more
and more were joining in on the sport. 

One
cock was constantly ramming into her from behind and one man was always
kneeling in front of her, his member buried inside her mouth and throat.

Her
head was bobbing frantically in the urgent attempt to bring the gladiator off,
swallowing his cum and getting the briefest of reprieve and a few full breaths
of air before the next cock was forced between her lips. Anything less then
earnest work got her a slap across the face or across her dangling breasts. So
d

Estrild
couldn`t tell how many men had raped her already and how long it had gone on.
Her labia and cunt-shaft were grated raw and her jaws ached with overuse.

Her
breast ached as well from being brutally fondled, groped, pulled and kneaded.

Her
world was reduced to an endless stream of hard members fucking her and male
hands exploring every part of her body with brutal force.

Trough
a haze of grunts and drunk laughter she heard the two men raping her cunt and
mouth exchanging a few menacing instructions while continuing their attack on
her body. Then suddenly the man fucking her from behind put his arms underneath
her armpits and closed his hands around the back of her neck. 

He
pulled her up, her mouth gliding off the cock she was sucking and held her
close to his body, his hard cock still inside her.

The
other one in front of her was looking at her exposed breasts and belly, an evil
grin on his face. His cock was still hard as well, all wet and shiny from her
saliva. 

He
slapped her breast with the palm of his hand. Then he slapped them again with
the back of his hand. He kept slapping her pain-filled mammal globes with the
cruel force of his callused hand, making them bound and jiggle on her ribcage.

Estrild
screamed in pain and begged him to stop. The other on kept rutting inside her
with even more raunchiness as before, her pain no doubt increasing his zest.

&quot;Now,
do it now!&quot; he urged his companion, as his cock began to spend himself
inside her. The other one let go of Estrild�s breasts, pushed the stool aside
and punched his fist into her belly.� She
grunted in pain. Before she could absorb the pain, he punched her again into
her pelvis, right on the triangle of her pubic hair.

He
punched her there again. And again. Each time, his fist dangerously close to
the balls of his companion, as he was shooting his hot semen into the poor
girl.

As
horribly painful as the blows to her pelvis was for Estrild, as lustful it was
for her rapist feeling her body absorbing the hits, feeling her cunt-shaft contracting
around his cock with each impact.

&nbsp;

A
flush of icy water awakened Amethea.

She
opened her eyes and shook her head, her eyelids blinking in an effort to clear
her vision. Her first cognition was that she was lying on her back and couldn�t
move. Her first sensation was a terrible straining pain in her groin.

She
managed to blink away the water in her eyes and got a look at Zohar standing at
her side, holding the bucket he�d just emptied on her face and smiling down at
her viciously.

Slowly,
Amethea realized her new predicament. 

She
was still stark naked. The only article she wore was the collar around her
neck, with which her torturer had choked her into unconsciousness.

She
had been taken down from the rack, but freedom was not granted to the warrior-woman.
Not in the slightest.

She
was now tied down on a wooden bench-like table. Her arms were tied down on the
upper end of the table, held tightly fixed by iron cuffs directly attached to
the surface of the table. Two cuffs were closed tight around her wrists, two
more around her elbows. When she turned her head, she could see the cuffs
around her elbows and realized with dismay that those were strong, thick iron
manacles, which did not allow the slightest movement of her arms. There would
be no way to break free from those. But that was by far not the worst of it.

The
lower part of the table was shaped like the top of a T - meaning the table
ended in a wooden beam of 3 meters. Amethea raised her head as much as she
could and gazed down the length of the body. The reason for the strain in her
loins became obvious. Her backside was resting on the center of the beam and
her legs were spread as wide apart as humanly possible. Two cuffs around her
ankles and two larger ones around her upper thighs secured the lower part of
her body on the table.

Virtually
immobilized on the table, her body equaled the letter T perfectly.

A
fine layer of sweat was covering her naked form, the light of the torches set
on the walls dancing on her curves.

Besides
the pain, this bondage caused her; Amethea realized of course, that this
rendered her vagina totally unprotected. She strained the muscles in her thighs
against the bonds around her legs. It was completely hopeless. Her legs
remained spread wide apart, held by those immovable cuffs on the table.

Zohar
put off the bucket and stepped closer. He was wearing his jacket, glasses and
the small hat on his head. His breechcloths were gone, however, and his
semi-hard cock was pointing directly at Amethea�s breasts. His hand came down
on Amethea�s left breast and he began kneading it brutally.

&quot;Well,
well. It seems we have that problem with your legs fixed, eh? You could have
killed me, you whore!&quot; His voice, soft at the beginning, now started to
rise.

&quot;You
HURT ME, SLUT!&quot; he cried in anger, his hand squeezing her tit as hard as
he could. 

Amethea
clenched her teeth and endured the pain in her crushed mammal flesh. 

&quot;Still
not screaming, aren�t you? Well, we can fix that, as well!&quot; He let go of
her crushed breast and picked up a whip. Amethea couldn�t suppress a shudder as
she looked at it. It had a wooden handle, wrapped in leather stripes. It had
four leather tails. Each tail contained a number of iron balls. Still she
fought to keep her stony composure of contempt although she dreaded what was to
come.

&quot;I
take it that there are a number of things you would like to do to me if our
positions were reversed!&quot; Zohar purred, running the tails of the whip over
the bound woman�s naked breasts. The iron balls were tugging at Amethea�s
nipples, promising to give rise to horrible pain. 

&quot;But
whatever you would do to me, would be child�s play compared to what I am going
to do to you, whore!&quot;

He
raised the whip high over his head and brought it down on Amethea�s breasts
with brutal force. 

Sheer
agony exploded in her mammal globes. The blow of the whip covered her entire
bosom, the leather cords biting into her flesh and the iron balls striking her
breasts like the hardest hail imaginable. Every muscle in Amethea�s body was
taut and she trembled in her herculean effort to hold back the scream of pain,
which tried to fight it�s way out of her lungs.

The
only sound that did escape in the end was her heavy, rapid breathing. Crimson,
bloodshot lines and dots appeared on her franticly heaving breasts. The pain
made her head spin and her stomach clench. She briefly wondered whether her
breasts would ever feel the same again, whether she would ever be able to
breastfeed a child after this attack on her bosom. 

Then
the second blow hit her. Zohar did not merely strike down on her breasts. This
time he rather pulled back the whip just before the tails made contact with her
fleshy globes. The result was that the four tips of the whiptails with their
iron balls were building up even greater speed before trashing into her left
breast, singling it out for a devastating blow. Amethea�s face offered a
display of suffering, which would break every sane man�s heart. For Zohar it
was just another stimulant for his twisted pleasure.

She
still denied herself the tiny relief of voicing her pain. Since she was
completely defenseless and had no way of stopping her torturer from doing to
her whatever his fancy was, she had only one pitiable small stand to make. And
that was denying him the additional pleasure of listening to her screams.

Zohar
was well aware of that. And he didn�t mind at all. Some started screaming and
begging for mercy, before he even began the torture; some started later on. 

In
the end, they all screamed for him. This one would be no exception.

&quot;My,
you are stubborn, aren�t you? You think you putting on a sword make you a
warrior? You think you are tough, don�t you my sweet? We will see just how
tough you really are, won�t we?&quot;

He
raised the whip again and brought it down with all his strength. Only this time
he was bringing it down on Amethea�s cunt. 

The
tails of the whip were crackling against her labial lips, the iron balls adding
to the impact in the most horrific way. And this time Amethea screamed at the
top of her lungs. The sound of it gave Zohar�s cock a surge of pleasure,
hardening it to it�s full size. 

&quot;Well�.&quot;
He said as the woman�s cry subsided. &quot;I guess we found ourselves a soft
spot there, wouldn�t you agree?&quot; 

He
was bending down bringing his face closer to hers, so he could observe the
tears filling her eyes more closely. Amethea spat in his face.

Zohar
got up to his full height, wiping of the saliva from his face with the sleeve
of his jacket. 

&quot;Insolence.
Why do I always have to put up with this insolence?&quot; he lamented, as if
Amethea was a disobedient pupil and he the ever-patient teacher. 

&quot;Now,
let�s see if your soft spot will make you sing for me! Surely you know some
wonderful songs I�d like to hear!&quot;

With
that he hit her cunt again. The pain was so terrible, that Amethea nearly
passed out. Unfortunately she remained conscious and screamed out in hellish
agony.

&quot;Aaah�yes!&quot;
Zohar mocked. &quot;That�s exactly the kind of song I�d like to hear from you,
my sweet!&quot;

He
hit her again. And again. 

Each
time, the whip covered all of her completely exposed labia. Each time it
brought her pain, she had never dreamed of being capable of taking. 

Her
body arched on the table - the only slight movement the bonds allowed it to
make. She was shaking her head from side to side, as blow after blow landed on
her tortured cunt. The muscles in her thighs were clenching and unclenching
frantically in a pitiably hopeless attempt to close her legs and protect her
sex against the terrible beating. And her screams filled the torture chamber,
each time following the sickening sound of leather and iron slapping against
the tenderest part of a woman�s body.

Then,
after a dozen strokes or more, the beating stopped.

Amethea
was panting, catching her breath after the screaming. Her breasts were heaving
rapidly. Tears were freely flowing down the sides of her head.

&quot;Why?!
Such a fierce warrior-woman and crying already? It seems that soft spot of
yours makes you considerably less tough then you think you are! Doesn�t it,
whore?!&quot; Zohar reached down and patted Amethea�s cunt with his free hand,
as if her sex was a dog, which had pleased his master by learning a new trick.

Amethea
managed to suffer the slapping of her now hypersensitive labia with clenched
teeth and a deep sob of pain.

Her
helplessness almost made her burst out in fresh tears. The cuffs held her legs
spread wide open, mercilessly, and there was nothing she could do to protect
herself, nothing standing between her exposed womanhood and the twisted cruelty
of her tormentor. 

Smiling
knowingly, Zohar slapped her cunt one last time with all his might. Amethea
screamed in fresh agony and Zohar giggled maliciously.

&quot;You
don�t like that, don�t you? No one ever treated that whore-slit of yours like
this, hmmm? All you knew about is being caressed there and having it filled
with the unwashed member of one of your tribe�s savage males, no?&quot;

He
began poking at her cunt with the handle of his whip. Amethea stared at him in
pure hatred and disgust, steeling herself against whatever was coming.

&quot;But
in here,&quot; Zohar said, making a sweeping gesture at his torture chamber,
&quot;that whore-slit of yours is put to quite a different kind of use!&quot;
With that the respite for Amethea ended. Zohar raised the whip for a new blow
and gave her a devastating one on her cunt.

The
woman yelled out even louder as before. One of the iron balls had hit her
directly on her clit.

Her
torturer sighed in satisfaction and lowered the whip. Amethea lay there,
trembling in pain, her eyes closed and her clenched teeth shining whitely
through her full, red lips. A tear protruding from her right eye and rolling
down her face.

Zohar
stepped back from her side and moved in front of her. He positioned himself
right between her widespread legs. The table was crafted in the exactly
appropriate height to position Amethea�s cunt at exact level with Zohar�s hard
cock. His member was fully aroused and pointing straight up.

As
it always did, when female flesh was punished.

He
watched Amethea�s sweat-glistening body for a moment � her heaving breasts, her
firm, trembling belly and her ruthlessly exposed womanhood, merely an inch away
from his erected member.

He
then took a grip on his cock, forcing it down and pushing its head against her
aching labia.

Amethea grunted in
repulsion as she felt his flesh against hers. But any attempt at resistance was
rendered totally hopeless by her bonds. Spread out like she was, she could not
offer the slightest defense against the intrusion whatsoever.

Zohar`s hard cock slid into
her wide-open pussy without any effort.

With a surge of tingling
pleasure, he felt her silky flesh covering his member as he glided all the way
in, until his pubic hairs mingled with hers and his balls pressed against her
tight ass-cheeks. 

He pulled back only to push
himself back in, making Amethea groan.

Although short in height,
Zohar�s member was quite large, as if the gods wanted to compensate his
diminished growth with a substantial tool for pleasuring women.

So Amethea felt her
cunt-shaft filled to its threshold by the intruding member of her tormentor as
it glided in and out of her in slow, casual strokes.

Each thrust made her moan
involuntarily. Those were no sounds of pleasure, of course. Her cunt-lips were
beaten raw by the whip and the friction of Zohar�s cock moving against them
caused her intense pain.

Knowing this only added to
Zohar�s pleasure as he fucked his helpless victim.

He caressed her firm belly
and groped her still pain-throbbing breasts. He put his hands around their
bases and squeezed them, turning her soft globes into two taut balls of tight
flesh.

Inside, Amethea howled in
despair as he molested her. But she fought to betray as little of the pain and
humiliation she felt as possible.

Again and again she tested the strength of her bonds, only
to realize that there was no way to escape them; that she could do NOTHING to
defend herself.

Hold
on. She told herself. Endure this�somehow. He will spend himself
inside you, he may torture you again. But sooner or later he will have to
release you, so he can do something�.different to you. And then you will kill
him. You�ll get another chance. 

�He will not torture you bound to this table
forever.

But from deeper inside her, somewhere beneath her stern
determination, there was another voice speaking to her.

Perhaps
not forever. The new voice piqued. But don�t you think he will enjoy you in this
position for quite some time? After all, he doesn�t merely enjoy hurting
you�.he obviously enjoys hurting you THERE quite thoroughly. You do understand
that it is your pain that makes his member hard, no? You do understand that it
is your pain that makes him feel THAT pleasure, don�t you? 

So
what makes you think that he will not keep you like this for the next torture?
Don�t you think he will torture you THERE again? And rape you right afterwards?
Because hurting you THERE makes him feel THAT pleasure again? Let us be candid:
you do realize that you should savor his rape of your body, no? Surely that�s
the least painful of all the inevitable things you�ll still have coming.

Amethea grinded her teeth and clenched her fists as she silently cursed
the second voice and told it to shut up.

Zohar fucked her calmly, using
up every inch of his cock and her cunt-shaft for his pleasure. He gazed down at
her.

�You want to hurt me again, don�t you? You�d like to
kill me slow! Don�t you, slut?!�

He pulled his cock back, holding just the very tip of
his member at the entrance of her pussy. Then he rammed his cock inside her
with a horrible, brutal thrust that made her cry out in pain.

He pulled back again. Again holding his cock-head just
barely inside her pussy, his hands holding tight around her slim waist.

�You�ll pay dearly!� he said and rammed his cock back
in with brutal force, making her cry anew. He relished in the feeling of her
tender, silky flesh being forced aside by his huge prong. He watched her
breasts jiggle with the force of his attack inside her with delighted
fascination.

He
repeated the act again. And again. And again.

Each
horrible, brutal thrust made Amethea yelp in pain. As much as she desired to
keep her silence, those testimonies of her ravishment were beyond her power to
contain.

After
a dozen, or so, of these perfidious and painful jabs into her cunt, Zohar
proceeded to rape his victim with normal pace and strength.

Calmly
and leisurely, he moved his cock back and forth inside her silky tunnel and
Amethea lay there and felt disdained surprise by the fact, that her rapist had
not spend himself inside her; nor that he seemed to be especially aroused by
the rape.

He
kept fucking her in complete control of his lust and showed no indication of
reaching the climax of his pleasure, anytime soon.

Amethea
raised his head and peered between her twin breasts-globes down the length of
her body. She saw her flat, taut belly and the fair-colored pubic hair of her
crotch. She could see Zohar�s thick, long member appearing and disappearing as
she felt it gliding back and forth inside her.

She
grated her teeth in new horror as she felt something, she had not felt since
the last time she and Argan had made love by the fireplace inside his hut.

A
tiny spark of pleasure came to live inside her belly, growing and growing with
each thrust of this vile creature�s cock inside her. Her neither lips began to
swell and her clit began to send tiny ripples of delightful heat into her
belly. Ripples that slowly but steadily grew into waves of lust. 

Amethea
had no intention of feeling that pleasure, of course. Just as Zohar had no
intention of giving her pleasure. But as much as she hated and despised her
tormentor, her body was designed for responding in this manner. Although her
body still was in pain from the racking and the beating, it held no memory of
the one responsible for it�s pain. Her body only reacted to the steady
stimulation of its sexual organs in that way, nature had designed it to.

And
to her dismay, the pleasure grew and grew. It began to overwhelm her senses and
seize control over her body, separating it from her mind and power of will. 

Her
breathing became heavier, her breasts began to swell and harden and her
ravaged, beaten pussy-lips began to moisten and coating Zohar�s prong.

Amethea
fought desperately against the pleasure and felt more degraded than ever before
during her captivity. Although the pain of torture was far worse for her body
than the pleasure, the rape caused her � the latter was far more painful for
her warrior soul. 

Betrayed
by her body she shook her head to and fro as her tongue gave voice to her
helpless raunchiness.

�UUUUNGGHHH�.AAAAAAAHHH��UNNGGGHH�.OOOOOHHH!!�

Zohar�s
cock moved back and forth inside her, relentlessly. He looked down at her with
a sneering smile on his face, watching her tied-down body�s squirming, the
reddening of her cheeks and chest and listening to her grunts and sobs of
helpless lust.

�Whore!�
he hissed, resuming her punishment with one horribly viscous thrust into her
cunt that made her yelp in agony.

�Slut!�
he spat and gave his captive another attack of his hard male flesh with all his
might.

He
then speeded up his ramming into her slightly. His hands came up to her chest
and he began rolling her rock-hard nipples with his thumbs. 

Amethea�s
head was spinning and her cunt and breasts were sending unbearable surges of
pleasure into her broiling, churning belly. She felt his cock ramming into her
with quick, lustful strokes. The constant rubbing of his hard member at her
clit shot wave after wave of lust through her loins. His hands caressed her
swollen, hardened breasts tenderly� only to attack them in the next second. His
fingers dug into her mammal flesh, taking a grip on her nipples and twisting
and pulling at them.

Amethea
laid there, her body squirming in its bonds just as it had mere moments before
under the pain of torture. The bindings made the lust that overwhelmed her
senses even more unbearable, denying her even the slightest relief a woman
being free of restraints could get in such heat of passion by moving her body
in harmony with the motions of her lover. No, Amethea was condemned to almost
total immobility and had to endure the lust as defenseless as she had to endure
the pain before.

She
desperately struggled against the bonds, holding her down, as her pleasure
mounted. Feelings of self-worth and hatred for her rapist were swept away by
pure, carnal instincts. Almost dementedly, she tried to push her loins up to
meet the prong ramming into her She arched her back in a mindless attempt to
push herself against her rapist, taking him into her arms, wrapping her legs
around his waist to bury his hard member even deeper into her quivering, wet
cunt.

Her
grunts of heated lust became cries of sheer, carnal bliss, which became louder
and louder with each new stab into her cunt. 

Then,
suddenly, her eyes snapped wide open and her whole body stiffened. 

�Her back arched as far as the bindings
permitted her, then her body shook and trembled with so much force it came
close to shaking the heavy oak tree table as well. The trembling went on and on
as she screamed and babbled incoherently. Zohar felt her cunt contracting
around his cock, sucking at it ferociously. 

He
gathered all his strength and power of will in order not to loose control, not
to shoot his semen into that fair-haired trollop just yet.

He
watched her convulsions ebbing down, listened to her mindless babbling
subsiding. He stood there for a moment, wallowing in his complete mastery over
her. Feeling pride in his prong having aroused this slut, even trough her pain.

Amethea
laid there, the last of her strength swept away by reaching the peek of carnal
passion. She was panting rapidly, her eyes closed and her face and her entire body
covered in sweat. 

But
as the pleasure ebbed away, she was overwhelmed with anguish and shame. She
felt ashamed, as she never has felt ashamed before in her life. And that shame
rekindled her righteous ire. She did not want this to happen! She had no say in
this! 

And
still, she felt like having given into her tormentor. Subjecting herself to his
power over her. She fought against the desperation and shame rising in her
soul. Eyes still closed, she set her jaw. Grinding her teeth and steeling her
resolve.

This
meant nothing.

She
felt a hard slap against her right breast. She yelped in pain. Due to the
beating and the sensual heat-weaves, which had ploughed through her breasts,
the two mammal globes` sensitivity was heightened indefinitely.

Her
eyes snapped open and she glared up at Zohar�s gloating face.

His
cock was still inside her. And it was still hard. He resumed moving it back and
forth inside the slippery wetness of her cunt.

�A
whore!� he hissed, backhanding her left breast. �That�s all that you are. A
wanton slut!� 

He began fucking her hard, the pacing and force of his thrusts increasing. 

�I�ll
make you crawl and beg for this!� he spat, fucking Amethea with vicious
brutality.

He
reached for her throat with a wicked grin and took hold of the iron ring in
front of the collar, she still wore. Then he began twisting it with swift turns
of his hand.

Amethea
realized, what he did to her and her eyes widened in anxiety. The collar
tightened fast, closing her windpipe mercilessly. Within seconds, the woman was
unable to breath.

Zohar
continued fucking her as he watched her eyes bulging out, her arms and legs
struggling with renewed desperation against the bonds holding them down on the
table. Her instincts howled inside her mind to free her arms in order to remove
the object at her throat as her lungs began to scream for air. 

But
it was utterly hopeless. As her arms and legs were pinned down, her trunk was
the only movable part of her body. And it writhed piteously on the table, her
stomach desperately heaving, her muscles clenching and unclenching. Her mouth
was gaping open, as if she was a fish out of water. 

Zohar
watched in delight, as her fucked her relentlessly. He felt his climax
approaching. Felt the surges of pleasure mounting inside his scrotum and hard
member. All the time he watched her agony, felt her still-wet cunt contracting
around his cock with the force of her struggle against suffocation.

He
fought against the climax, endeavored to prolong his pleasure for as long as
possible. 

Amethea
had been without air for two full minutes now, and still struggled against the
horrifying ordeal her rapist enjoyed putting her through. The pain in her lungs
was beyond description. She banged her head against the wooden surface of the
table in mindless frenzy. There was nothing left in her mind except sheer and
utter panic. Her face was darkly colored, now and her eyes were at the brink of
popping out of their sockets.

Zohar
was getting closer and closer at the edge as he watched her suffering. He felt
his hot semen building up inside his cock, shooting through the length of his
prong. Then hot gushes of white, salty seed shot into Amethea�s silky womb.

He
sighed in pleasure as more and more of his semen sprayed into his victim�s
tortured, convulsing body. 

Amethea
did not feel the final desecration of her body. She had been without air for
almost four minutes and her struggles were weakening as her mind began to slip
into blissful unconsciousness. Her vision was a dark-red haze that grew darker
with each beat of her heart.

She
felt the darkness claiming her mind, shutting down her tortured body.

Then
she felt the collar releasing its grip. 

Instantly,
she took in the most desperate breath of her life, trying to take in all the
air in the torture chamber with one gulp. The blackness retreated into the back
of her mind as she exhaled and took in another gulp of air.

She
breathed like being almost drowned.

She
hardly noticed Zohar pulling his softening prong out of her. All she felt and
knew was the sweet air filling her lungs, providing her body with life.

Zohar
came to her side, looking down at her through slit eyes.

�Well,
slut. I hope you enjoyed your little reprieve. But you kept me from our
business for quite long enough.�

He
took a grip of her right breast, kneading if brutally � and then yanking at it,
repeatedly.

�Now,
you will tell me why you came here. And you will tell me, where your
rebel-friends are hiding!�

Amethea
stared up at him with the same hatred, as mere three hours ago, when her
questioning began.

Zohar
sighed in feigned discouragement.

�Ah,
well! Not much else sense can be expected for a savage like you, slut.�

He
reached for the collar again, tightening it once more.

And
as before, Amethea writhed and trashed on the wooden table, choked by the
collar into total lack of air.

Zohar
left her like that, as he retreated into his private side-chamber to clean
himself up. And he took his time before he returned.

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Tianara
was lying in her cell.

The
general had questioned her by singing her breasts. Then he had slapped her face
and breasts. Then he had punched her stomach and rammed his knee into her
crotch. Again and again and again.

After
quite a while, he had let go of her. But only to assure her, that she was the
next to be brought down to the torture chambers, just like her fair-haired
rebel-friend. 

�You
will regret not telling me, what I wanted to know, slut!� the general spat at
her.

�Down
there you will suffer, like you never would have thought possible for a woman
to suffer. And our torture-master does not settle down for making you talk,
wench. He will make you beg for ALLOWING you to tell him everything you know!�

With
that, Tianara was hurtled into her cell, naked with her hands manacled behind
her back. 

She
tried not to think about the hopelessness of their situation. She tried not to
think of Estrild and Taramis. She tried not to envision them being raped by the
palace guards. She tried not to think about Amethea. Tried not to think about
the pain, she undoubtedly must be suffering right now. She tried not to think
about the same suffering waiting for her, as well.

Yes,
she tried hard. And yet she failed.

&nbsp;

At
dawn, Amethea was laying in her cell, as well.

She
was naked. Her arms manacled behind her back, her feet chained together as well.
Her body was surprisingly unmarked and it would have surprised the black-clad,
gloating guards, who had carried her naked and chained like this to her cell,
had they known how much pain was actually gnawing away at Amethea�s body.

Zohar
had used the collar to choke her nearly into unconsciousness several times.
Then he had beaten her belly with a small, hard-wooden paddle. Then the paddle
had danced on her breasts for several minutes. 

After
this, he asked his questions again. As she refused to talk, he focused his
attentions to her wide-open crotch again. The paddle smashed against her inner
thighs, her underbelly and against her labial lips for an hour, at least.

She
screamed, as the wood crashed against her cunt-lips but still refused to talk.

Then
he took a wooden club, half and inch wide and eleven inches in length. 

He
fucked her with it. Its hard wood filling her cunt-shaft to its limits,
stretching her elastic tube painfully out. He made the tip of the club smashing
against her cervix every time he thrust the large wood into her. 

After
that, he pulled the club out of her and produced a wooden rod, as thick as a
man`s finger. At its tip there was a hard, round iron ball of the size of an
eyeball attached. He used the rod to flog her cunt. Or, to be more precise:
each and every one of the countless blows to Amethea�s cunt drove the iron ball
smashing directly on her tender clit. Each and every one.

Despite
all her pain she had suffered, the woman managed to hold back her screams
during the first dozen blows. But after the twelfth she began to give voice to
her agony. And she remained doing so during the remaining 50 � 60 blows; Zohar
bequeathed the tenderest part of her womanhood.

Amethea
was barely conscious, as someone interrupted her torturer�s beating of her clit
by knocking at the heavy, wooden door to the torture chamber.

She
could not hear, what was said could hardly care. The world, her senses could
register, was shrunk to her body and the pain it suffered. All else was outside
her capacity. Her world was her clit and the horrendous, pulsating, nauseating
pain it send into her belly.

The
next, she knew, was her being taken from the bench by several guards. They
manacled her arms and feet and carried her lifeless, limp body like a sack of
coals outside the chamber, along a corridor and up the stairs to the prisoner�s
cells. 

Arriving
there, they threw her onto the ground of the cell.

She
lay there for long hours as the sun climbed higher outside. The pain, she felt
was devastating. Her cunt was a blazing ache, that just wouldn�t go away. Her
breasts were two hot, pulsating globes of agony. Even the most cautious
movement, she made, that caused her breasts to shift their position on her
chest in the slightest made her yelp and wince in pain.

Hunger
and thirst gnawed away at her body, as well. 

Amethea
wondered, why her torture had been interrupted. She recalled Arrakur �expecting
answers in the morning�. She was sure that she had not betrayed her allies. Had
Tianara been broken? That was possible, of course.

For
a second, Amethea felt relief that Tianara had given up the information and
their now was no more reason for her to be tortured anymore.

She
felt a pang of shameful guilt at the thought and cursed herself for her moment
of weakness and the foolishness of that idea.

She
had seen the look in Arrakur�s eyes as he watched her racked on that infamous
instrument in Zohar�s dungeon the night before. He was just like his
torture-master. A creature that felt a man�s pleasure when he caused a woman
pain.

It
did not matter, if Tianara talked. Amethea knew, that even if she herself
talked, Arrakur would still have her tortured for the pure pleasure of it.

And
she had no doubt, that it would be a long suffering for her. For if Arrakur
derived as much pleasure from the beauty of her body as he did from causing it
pain, he would have Zohar torture her in such a way, that she would suffer
indescribable pain without having her beauty destroyed, for as long as
possible. 

And
she was sure of it that Zohar was capable of prolonging her suffering without
damaging her beauty much longer, than she dared to imagine.

And
what would he do to Taramis, if he found out, that she was Amethea`s sister?
Did� Estrild get away? Or was she a
prisoner, just like her? 

Were
Argan and the others even still alive?

A
wave of despair swept over her. Amethea listened carefully, if there were any
guards patrolling the cell-corridor at the moment. There weren�t any.

So,
the warrior-woman let out a sob of anguish. A sob, that was followed by another�.and
another. 

And
soon she began to cry, her tears flowing freely, her chest heaving through her
gut wrenching sobs of misery�.sending fresh surges of pain through her
maltreated breasts.

Was
there any way out of this?

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

To
be continued in�.

Barbarian Queen:

Captives of Lord Arrakur

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Chapter Three

&nbsp;

Playthings of His Excellency

&nbsp;

�Everyone
ready?�

Argan made
one final glance at the men standing behind him, no more then twenty-eight he
counted to his grim disappointment.

Not as
many, as he had hoped for. But he remained adamant about his intention, the
goal he had set himself: at the end of this night to be either free�or dead.

He refused
to give in to the beguiling free use of Arrakur�s sleek, warm and willing
slave-girls and of Arrakur�s delicious food and wine. And he refused to pay for
those pleasantries with his freedom � his last dearest possession.

Since he�d
seen his mate Amethea die in that burning hut a few days ago, he had felt
dispirited, almost unmanned by his grieve.

But living
out the rest of his life in servitude under that loathsome tyrant that caused
the death of his love and so much suffering for his people was not the way he
wanted to end. He had decided to fight Arrakur, to make him pay.

But Argan
was no fool to lead those who felt like him and choose to follow into certain
death. Yes, they would fight Arrakur. But first they had to escape.

If Argan
had known, that his love was alive and had come for his rescue; if he had known
that Amethea�s pain-throbbing body was raped by her torturer at this very
moment�he would have chosen differently.

He would
have given every ounce of his strength to get to her. To free her from torture.
But since he did not know, his determination was aimed at avenging his
fair-haired mate instead of rescuing her or die trying. 

Fate did
seem to take pleasure in toying with the two lovers, relishing in the anguish
of their separation. One thinking the other dead, the other suffering horribly
to protect her loved one.

The joints
of the heavy door leading into the gladiator�s quarters screeched as the
massive, wooden leafs opened.

Six guards
came with a dozen fresh slave-girls for the gladiator�s pleasure.

�GO!!�
Argan bellowed and charged the guards, his followers right behind him.

&nbsp;

Arrakur
held back an urge to purr.

He was
sitting in his bed, still attired in a black night-cloak. It had been a
tiresome, yet fruitful day and he meant to collect his rewards for the day�s
work.

His reward
was bending over his cloak-covered groin. Taramis was naked except from golden
circlets enclosing her wrists, upper arms and ankles as well as a small,
delicately crafted golden chain around her hips. 

Her rounded
buttocks were thrust in the air for Arrakur to behold as her bare breasts were
flattened on his crotch. As instructed the girl gently rubbed her mammal globes
back and forth, stroking her master�s groin with her tits.

Arrakur
felt his member rising under the tender grating of the girl�s pliant domes of
warm flesh. The little slut was learning the ways of pleasing a man very fast.

The sleek,
warm sensation of her body was not new to him. 

A few days
ago, he had raped her at a river outpost, ruthlessly fucking her with viscous
force. She had screamed and cried and begged him to stop, but naturally he had
given it no heed. He had mounted her until his lust was sated and then left her
at the outpost as entertainment for the outpost�s troop.

And then,
two days later, she had come to the palace gates�begging for being allowed
inside. As Arrakur realized, that she was the girl he had raped shortly before,
his first response was one of suspicion. But the sheepish naivety of the girl
had taken the edge of his suspicions.

True, she
either had escaped from the outpost or someone had rescued her. And if he
hadn�t been as taken by her grovelling at his feet as he was, he would have
ordered her to be put to the question. Anyway, he had a scout sent to the
outpost and should he return with news of an attack on his men at the river,
the little blond slut would be made to tell them all about how she got away
from there.

Until then,
he savoured her tractable way of serving him.

He grunted
in pleasure, as his cock hardened full and poked into the squashy mammal meat
grating on top of it. His hand came down to stroke her breasts, tenderly kneading
the flesh. Her tit felt hot on his fingers. He pushed the upper part of her
body from his cock, meaning to liberate the hard, throbbing member of the cloak
concealing it.

There was
noise outside, then. A heated argument, barely audible behind the thick, wooden
doors to his private bedchamber, followed by a knocking.

�Yes!� Lord
Arrakur shouted, frowning. 

He did not
like being disturbed in his pleasures and promised himself a particular painful
punishment for the one daring to intrude on his privacy.

On the
other hand, no one would dare to disturb him right now, if it weren�t of the
utmost importance. So best to let the wretch make his report and then decide,
whether or not to hang him up by his testicles.

A guard
came in, nervously bowing in front of his lord lying half-naked in his bed with
a fully naked wench half on top of him. No servant gladly faced his master like
this, knowing that whatever the reason for this undignified meeting, it would
sit ill with the lord.

�Please
forgive my intrusion, excellency.� The guard stammered.

�What is
it, man? Speak or leave, dog!� Arrakur grumbled.

�A group of
gladiators have escaped. They took the guards bringing new girls to the
gladiator�s harem by surprise.� 

Taramis
yelped in pain. Arrakur had still had his hand at her left breast and as the
guard had started his report, his fingers had dig into her tender globe,
squeezing the tit in growing rage.

�With the
guard�s weapons, they attacked another palace patrol, taking their weapons, as
well. Before alarm was given, they were at the palace gate, hacking their way
through the men posted there and escaped into the city.�

Arrakur�s
ire rose, as he listened. Almost unaware of it, he aimed his fury at the first
best vulnerable target at hand. He crushed Taramis breast in his hand with
frightening cruelty. The girl whined and squealed, as her young tit was
mercilessly swatted in an iron grip of steel-like fingers. Tears welled up in
her eyes and dripped on Arrakur�s jiggling paunch. 

�Search the
city! I want those men found and brought back alive, you hear?!� he shouted. 

�It�s
already being done, your Excellency.� The guard gulped. 

A man was
entitled to many pleasures in service of Arrakur. The lord handed out drink and
especially women generously. But as generous as he was in those respects, as
unforgiving he was in dealing out punishments for failures.

Perhaps it
was well for the guards that were attacked at the gladiator�s harem, that they
had all died. If any of them had survived, they surely would have been put to the
question, just in case they might have collaborated with the escaped warriors.

Arrakur
grunted. He let go off Taramis�s bruised globe and brutally pushed her off the
bed. She fell down hard on the stone floor with a heart-wrenching cry of pain.

He paid no
attention to her, as he rose from his bed closing his nightgown.

�Tell
captain Kaltar to lead the search!� he ordered. �Let him tear the city apart,
if he has to. But I want those men to pay for their insolence! Let him put
anyone to the question, who might be involved. Any man, woman or child! You
hear?!!�

The guard
shifted uneasily on his feet in front of his master. 

�Your
excellency, � he stammered. �we may already have captured someone involved.�

�Oh?�

�Ahem�yes.
There was a slavegirl following the gladiators. She was screaming a name�Ardan,
Artan�or something, and pleading him to take her with him. Apparently, whoever
this Arpan was, he did not hear her in the midst of battle. The other
gladiators still true to your excellency grabbed her and turned her over to
us.�

Arrakur
hissed in disdain.

�So I can
be thankful to those drunken brutes for fulfilling the duties my warriors are
completely unable to do, eh?! Nevertheless, have that slavegirl brought to
Zohar. I want to know, what she had to do with those rebellious gladiators. I
want to know before the sun goes up! Tell Zohar; the blonde whore will be
returned to him later!

Now GO!�

The guard
saluted and swiftly left Arrakur�s chambers. 

The
sovereign paced back and forth in front of his bed, clenching and unclenching
his fists in frustration. Rebels everywhere. A plague on them!

But he
would find them. Each and every one of them. And they would pay dearly for
defying him. They would pay.

&nbsp;

Zohar let
out a heavy sigh.

He did not
mind working all night. He did not mind that at all. 

But this
night had proven a bit too tumultuous for his tastes. First he was to make the
blonde whore talk before the night was over. Not an easy assignment, but
manageable. Not nearly so difficult, that he would deprive himself from taken
advantage of the beauteous slut chained up in his dungeon. 

But as
soon, as he felt he was making some progress in picking holes in her
iron-willed defiance, he was ordered to stop the torture and start on another
captive.

Since that
other trull was of more immediate importance, Lord Arrakur had ordered the
fair-haired slut to be taken back to her cell. 

To be
honest with himself, he had taken a fancy in that strong one. Not the least
because of her hair, she reminded him of a captured lioness. A strong creature
to be broken by it�s master. In fact, he could not easily recall another whore
ever having been as enjoyable to torture, as the lioness has been. He truly
looked forward to resume working on her. 

But first
the matter at hand. 

He gazed at
the brown-haired girl in front of him.

The lioness
had left to make way for a mouse, he thought to himself.

This would
not take very long.

The girl
was sobbing and weeping although naught had been done to her, yet.

The girl
was hanging in midair. Her wrists were manacled to a chain hanging from the
ceiling. Her legs were bend back, each of her ankles tied to the corresponding
thigh with broad, blackened leather straps. Her taut, aching knees were
dangling a hand�s width above the stone floor.

Her nude body
glistened with the sweat of fear, every curve of her supple shape highlighted
by the torches�s light reflected on her shiny skin. Her large, green eyes were
filled with terror and she was quivering in fear�gaping in unbelieving dread at
the assortment of torture devices surrounding her.

She sniffed
and whimpered, watching every movement of the dwarfish torture-master with
chicken-hearted anxiety. 

Estrild had
always looked up at Tianara and Amethea. Had admired their fighting skills and
their seemingly unyielding bravery against impossible odds. There would have
been few others among her fellow villagers, whom she would have followed on
this seemingly infeasible quest of rescuing their enslaved people from those
marauders. But now that quest had led them all into captivity as well. Worse
then being enslaved, too: arrested as rebels. Even as she was mauled and raped
by the brutish gladiators, Estrild had considered herself lucky having been
taken for a mere peasant girl and put into Lord Arrakur�s flesh-pits to serve
his warriors.

Amethea and
Tianara, who had been captured coming to her aid as the guards had raped her on
the market square, had undoubtedly being put to the question by now.

Estrild
wondered, whether they had betrayed the rebels or not. Were they even still
alive? Her concern for her friends vanished instantly as the torture-master
approached her. He was holding a large wooden truncheon in his hand. Due to the
way she had been strung up, she was forced to look slightly up at the face of
the tormentor. She could see the controlled eagerness in his eyes to begin the
questioning and her heart throbbed furiously against her ribs. 

Estrild was
not among the bravest creatures and the expectation of being tortured filled
her with nothing short of panic.

�So, you
are the slut that conspired with the gladiators to kill numerous guards and run
away. To join the rebels, no doubt!�

He pushed
the tip of the truncheon against her chin and forced her head up. He looked
into her fear-filled, wide-open eyes with smug enjoyment. This one would talk
very soon, he told himself. If she knew anything, that is.

�Please�.�
She whispered. Her whole body shaking like a frightened whelp.

�Please, my
lord. I don�t know anything.�

�That is
what every other whore before you has said in here at first. Some were lying...
some were speaking the truth. Unfortunately for the latter, it takes much
longer to make sure they speak the truth. Now, let us see to which it will be
with you!�

Zohar
raised the club behind his head. Estrild began to whine in anticipation of the
first blow and tried to twist her body away. But the other hand of the man was
taking a grip on her right arm, holding her in place.

Then the
length of the wood hit her square across her abdomen. The sickening sound of hard
wood crushing into female flesh filled the torture chamber, instantly followed
by Estrild�s response.

�UUUUUMMMMPPPFFFFF!�

All the air
was driven out of her as the insides of her belly exploded in pain.

Instinctively,
she pulled up her legs and if it weren�t for her arms being chained above her
she would have curled herself up for long, long minutes to mend the pain.

Zohar would
not give her any time for mending, of course. He hit her again; this time the
tip of the truncheon embedded itself with terrific force into the tender,
mammal cushion of her left breast.

Estrild
howled in pain as her tit was squelched under the impact. The room began to
spin around her and a feeling of dreadful sickness sided itself with the
unbearable agony gnawing away at her breast. 

�Don�t
spend all of your voice at once, slut!� Zohar sneered. �This is merely the
beginning!� He raised the club anew and Estrild shook her head in helpless
denial.

�Please,
Please do not do it!! I do
not�.AAAAAAAAAAAAHHHH!!�

The wood slammed into her
right breast, sinking deep into the mammal globe as the girl�s piercing scream
of pain made the torturer�s member jump inside his breechcloths.

&nbsp;

Arrakur had broken
fast in the throne room.

His mood was grim and
neither the musicians playing in at the other side of the hall, nor the three
slavegirls serving him the food with naught to wear than silken, almost
invisible sashes flowing down between their legs, fastened with slim, golden
chains wrapped tightly around their slender waists had managed to better that
condition. After having eaten, he had ordered the three girls to dance for him
with the promise of having them soundly flogged if they failed to please him.

The sleek
pleasure-slaves had danced for him with beguiling eagerness, hips swinging,
breasts bouncing and rolling and their curves and clefts beneath displayed with
utter shamelessness. He had watched for an hour with a frown that grew deeper
and deeper. An hour during which the girls were permitted no pause and they
danced and kept dancing long after their strength had almost come to an end and
rivers of sweat ran down their naked curves, as well as tears streaming down
their sweet faces. Yet they kept on leaping, twisting, wrenching and meandering
their exhausted bodies in fear of the whip.

He got some
satisfaction from wielding his power over those wenches but not enough to make
up for the events of the night.

The gladiators had not
been captured. Even worse: not only have they escaped the castle; to make the
insult even greater they had escaped the city as well. Killed the gate-sentries
and ran out into the woods even before dawn.

He hissed in
frustration and got up. He looked at the girls, still frantically dancing their
delightfully rauncheous dance at the brink of despair and at the verge of
collapsing from the exhaustion.

�You keep dancing,
whores!� he bellowed. 

�See these guards?� he
hissed, pointing at the sentries standing at the door.

�They will watch you
dance. The first of you, who seizes to dance will be tortured to death! The
second will be branded right inside her whorish shaft! And the third will be
merely flogged on her breasts! You hear?!�

He left them, gasps of
numbing shock, wails and groans of despair and pleads for mercy accompanied his
exit.

But even their begging
for his pity did not stop them from continuing their frantic dance. 

Then, the sovereign
was gone. But the musicians played on and the girl danced with the last ounces
of strength in their cramping, tired legs and cracking bones. Each if them was
desperately hoping to make it farther then the other. Each of them was in utter
panic of being the first to fall to the floor.

&nbsp;

Amethea heard the
wooden door to her opening, the hinges squeaking.

She had been drifting
in and out of a fatigued daze during the last hours but the sound caused her to
regain her full senses instantly.

She sat up on the
bench she had been laying on, wincing at the pain her sudden movement caused
her. The hours past had not mended the aftereffect of her ordeal. Her cunt and
breasts still ached and all of her muscles felt as if she had been carrying
rocks for days without rest. 

Her heart began to
throb against her ribs as she expected to be taken out of the cell to be
tortured again. 

Three guards entered.
Their gaze wandered over her delectable, bound body. Since her hands were
chained behind her back she had no way of covering her swelling breasts from
the men�s lecherous eyes lest to turn herself away from them. But her warrior
pride forbad her to do such thing and she endured their lewd staring at her
nudeness while balefully staring back at them.

One of the guards
carried two bowls, which he put down at the farthest corner of the cell. One
other of the guards carried a strange, black iron pole. It was about one and a
half meters in length and had two manacles attached to either end. In the
middle of the pole there was a heavy, black leather ring attached, as well. A
chain hang down from the middle of the pole, clinking menacingly as the guard
approached Amethea, holding the device in both hands. 

The first guard,
having placed the bowls, joined the third man and dragged Amethea from the
bench and forced down on the scantily hay-strewn floor of the cell. They kept
the woman kneeling down in front of the guard with the device and Amethea was
to weak to put up a greater fight than a mild struggle against their strong
hands holding her down.

Sneering down at her,
the guard placed the leather ring of the pole around Amethea`s neck and closed.
It caused her difficulty breathing, but was not that tight that she might choke
to death. Then she felt the manacles around her wrists opened and her arms
forced up in the air. 

Torture, hunger and
thirst had weakened Amethea sufficiently for the guards to force her wrists
into the manacles at the end of the pole and close them. The woman�s arms were
now raised in the air, her wrists shackled to the end of the pole at the same
height as her neck. Next came the chain hanging down her spine. The guards
behind her pulled it tight making her upper body bend backwards, her full
breasts pointing up in the air. The chain was locked to the manacles around her
ankles.

As the guards released
her from their grasp, Amethea was kneeling on the cell floor, arms stretched
out to either side and her body arched backwards be the chain running from her
ankles to the collar around her neck.

�That whore does not
seem so tough as they say, eh?� one of the guards said. 

�Tough enough to kill
three of our comrades, mind you.� The other sourly replied. He stared down at
her through slit eyes. Amethea just stared back in contempt.

�You think yourself
something special, don�t you slut?!� he said. �Believe me, you are not. A few
more hours in the dungeons with Master Zohar will squeeze that insolence out of
you.�

He turned away and the
guards started to leave the cell.

Amethea blinked in
surprise. She expected to be taken back to Zohar and now she would be left in
the cell bound like this.

Before he closed the
door, the guard turned towards her for a parting comment.

�Both the bowels and
the yoke you carry, we brought you by Master Zohar�s command. He wishes you
enjoy your meal, slut!�

And with that he
closed the door behind him, leaving Amethea alone.

As she did not have to
concentrate on her contempt for the male intruders, the warrior-woman gazed at
the bowels on the floor. They were about two meters away from her kneeling
position. One was filled with gruel, the other with water. Both smelled sweetly
for the starving and thirsting woman. Her mouth watered and hunger attacked her
belly, strained by the bondage, with a frightening fierceness. 

She needed to feed and
drink so very, very badly. And as the made a hesitant move towards the bowels,
the malicious intent of her captors dawned for her.

The one and only way
she could get to the food was crawling on her belly. And the yoke on her neck
holding her arms apart would prevent her to protect her still aching breasts
from being crushed underneath her. 

Being alone, she
allowed tears of frustration and misery welling in her eyes. 

Those bastards, she cursed
inside her mind. Plainly, Zohar enjoyed hurting her, even when he wasn�t
present to savor her pain.

She cursed him again,
imagined putting a dagger into his crotch and twisting it around as he screamed
like the pig he was. 

But there was really
no choice. Despite all the pain and the hopelessness, Amethea wanted to
survive. She had not given up. She wanted to see her people free. And to
accomplish that, she had to fight. She had to endure�had to stay alive. 

So she needed the
food.

She pushed her weight
forward, swallowing anxiously as she balanced perilously on her knees. She
shifted her balance forward as cautiously and as slowly as possible.

Then she reached the
point of no return, her bound and stretched body falling towards the ground in
front of her. 

Her belly hit the
ground, knocking the wind out of her. That was painful in itself but absolutely
nothing compared to the pain she felt as her breasts where thumping into the
ground and being crushed beneath her. It would have hurt terribly if her breasts
had been in their normal condition. Having been slapped and beaten and whipped
without end mere hours ago, had made them tenfold as sensitive as they normally
would be. The agony was too much for Amethea to refrain from crying out�a cry
that proceeded into a series of sobs. 

Nausea attacked her
and she almost lost consciousness as she lay there panting, her full, tender
breasts squashed between her chest and the rough floor. 

She remained in that
position for long minutes, as the white-hot agony slowly faded into a fierce,
throbbing pain. Then, gnashing her teeth, she began to crawl towards the food.
Her grunts were accompanied by sharp squeals of pain as she was forced to grind
her mammal globes on the floor. Her bondage did not allow her to offer her
constantly crushed tits the slightest relief as they were pressed and squeezed
and dragged across the hard, rough surface of the cell. Amethea was gasping as
she forced herself farther and farther. Cold beads of sweat covered her
forehead and the rest of her body as she crawled on, the food and the water
getting closer with maddening slowness.

When she finally
reached her goal, her breasts felt like being scraped raw. She did not know,
how long she had tortured herself in order to reach the food. All she knew was
that she had reached it.

But now she realized
that there was another obstacle in front of her. There was only one way to
actually eat and drink due to the way her body was bound. 

She pushed up her head
and with a final series of frantic, crawling motions that sent new flashes of
pain through her tender mammals, she positioned her face above the bowel with
water. Straining her muscles to the limit of their endurance, she lowered her
face towards the bowel and frantically slurped down the clear liquid. 

Knowing that too much
water would cause her only additional suffering, she side-crawled towards the
bowel filled with gruel and ate it like a dog. 

After having devoured
the food she licked the insides of the bowel clean with her tongue. Then she
finished the remains of the water.

As refreshing as the
nourishment was, the cruelness of her bondage had made the consuming of it a
trying one for Amethea.

She made some
half-hearted attempts to get up, but as she had anticipated the bondage
rendered those efforts totally hopeless. All she accomplished was grinding her
breasts on the ground and sending new flashes of pain through her tortured
mammaries. Sweating, panting and sobbing in frustration she gave up and
remained in her position.

After some time, the white-hot
pain in her tits made way for a relentless ache. Then, after some more time
passed, the pain became almost bearable.

And finally, the
warrior-woman succumbed to the exhaustion of her body and her soul. She closed
her eyes and drifted into a fitful sleep, right there on the floor of her cell.

&nbsp;

Arrakur descended the
stairs leading to the dungeons of his castle.

Even his ire, born by
the gladiators` escape and nurtured by one patrol after another returning to
the city with nothing to offer than humble apologies for their failure in
finding the renegades, could not deviate from the surge of pleasure he felt
each and every time he descended into these premises.

When this castle was
built, he had made sure that the dungeon beneath it was build as spacious as
possible. Not only did Arrakur intend to hold as many prisoners as possible in
the two dozens cells below. In addition, he considered one chamber of torment
somewhat insufficient. So he instructed his architect to design a dungeon with
no less than five torture-chambers. Two general interrogation chambers, where
prisoners of minor importance were put to the question. Two larger vaults were
the domains of Zohar, equipped with those special devices the torture-master
had invented and designed over the years of Arrakur�s rule. And there was a
fifth chamber. This one was isolated from the cell and the other chambers and
only accessible through a long passage leading some forty paces downwards�even
deeper into the earth beneath the castle. This chamber was as spacious as the
other ones higher above. But this one was Lord Arrakur�s private torture
chamber. Equally equipped with Zohar�s fiendish inventions, this one was solely
intended for the Lord�s twisted amusement.�


With a regretful sigh
Arrakur forwent to descend the passageway to his private domain. Right now was
not the time. But just a few hours from now, he promised himself, he would
spend a highly entertaining evening down there. And there was not the slightest
uncertainness about, which of the wenches in his custody would have the
misfortune of providing his pleasure.

But his abdication did
not diminish the joy tickling his belly and the delightful warmth and
commencing hardening of his male flesh, which he always felt then entering the
dungeons. His joy of pain was always fueled when being here, for there was
never a moment when there wasn�t a muffled scream of pain coming from the
torture chambers. There was always a male or female prisoner put to the
question to find out whether they were rebels or not�or knew something,
anything about this mutinous scum or not. Others were merely tortured for
punishment, females mostly. If a beautiful wench resisted being raped by the
royal guards in the taverns or back alleys of the city she would surely find
herself arrested as a rebel and put to the question. On the other hand, giving
into the guards lewd demands in fear of being hurt almost always resulted in
her being arrested as a whore and thus punished by torture just as well. So
Lord Arrakur�s torturers had plenty of work to do. 

The constant muffled
screaming from the pain-chambers were accompanied by the sobbing, crying and
pleading for mercy of the prisoners in the cells.

Arrakur loved the
sound of it. There was no place in his kingdom where he felt as much an
absolute ruler as in his dungeons. He relished in the endless, relentless
suffering taking place by his decree. 

A man�s arm reached
out through the small, roughly grilled window of her cell-door, grabbing
Arrakur�s cloak. He looked at it in disdain as the man begged for mercy in a
high-pitched voice, offering him his wife and his three young daughters for his
pleasure in exchange for being allowed to die.

A guard swiftly
stepped forward and yanked the wretch�s weak arm away from his master.

�What crime did this
pig commit?� Arrakur demanded to know. He made a mental note to dispose of the
cloak as soon as possible. The guard took up a wooden plaquette from the
cell-door and read the prisoner�s record.

�Stole two apples.� He
read out loud. �Said his children were starving since his shop was closed by
your lord�s decree. Sentenced to one year imprisonment as well as a day of
torture at least once each week during this time. Ten months of his sentence
still left.�

Arrakur peered into
the dusky cell trough slit eyes. 

�Well, let�s see if we
can make the rest of his sentence a bit less solitary, shall we? Have his wife
and children arrested and tortured to death in front of him. Each of them in
turn. And make each one last a few days, so he can spend as much time as
possible with his loved ones, whom he so willingly offer as sacrifice for his
miserable life. He himself is to be tortured each second day. And if he
survives the time of his sentence�.torture him to death!�

A heart-wrenching wail
came from the cell, as Arrakur demanded the whereabouts of the slave-girl who
attempted escape with the gladiators the night before.

The guard let him to
one of Zohar�s chambers and opened the door for the lord to enter.

Except for Lord
Arrakur, of course, no one would enter one of the pain-master�s rooms in such
manner. It was well known that Zohar pleasured himself with his female
prisoners and no one wanted to be the next to suffer under his care because one
had disturbed him during one of his more intimate interactions with his victim.

Then again, Zohar knew
that his master visited the dungeons quite often during the daytime, so he
generally raped at night.

Arrakur stepped into
the torture-chamber and looked at the slave-girl hanging from the ceiling. Her
ankles and thighs were strapped together and her arms were manacled behind her
back. Which meant that her breasts suspended her in midair. A rough hemp was
encompassing the bases of her tit-globes; crushing them together and making her
mammal mounds look like deep-red, incredible taut balloons at the verge of
bursting any second. The hemp went up towards the ceiling to a winch, which
Zohar was operating by a wheel set in the wall.

The brown-haired girl
was crying and whining as the pain in her tits grew with each second they were
forced to support her entire weight.

�Your excellency!�
Zohar courted, bowing his head before his master.

Arrakur nodded. There
was no being in the world for which the warlord felt affection. But between the
lord and his torturer there was a sense of respect and understanding. Not
friendship, really, but a relationship of mutual passion, since they both
relished in the pain of other human beings. Lord Arrakur gave Zohar the
opportunity and means to honing his ungodly skills and Zohar in return provided
the lord with a variety of ingenious devices and perfidious ideas. Between the
two of them prisoners suffered tortures, no human being in the world had
suffered before, since they haven�t been invented yet. 

�So, have you learned
anything from that trollop as yet?� Arrakur demanded to know. 

�Your excellency, this
one did not take long in breaking. I think she told me all she knows, already.
Miserable, weak-kneed slut, that one!�

Arrakur pursed his
lips and stepped closer towards the woman swinging in midair.

She looked at him
through her tear-filled, green eyes, appealingly.

�Oh please!� Estrild
sobbed. �Please! I told him everything. Please�I can�t take anymore!� 

Lord Arrakur�s eyes
narrowed as he looked at her, pitilessly. Then he grabbed her hips with both
hands and lifted her up almost two inches. Then he let go of her and her body
fell back towards the ground, only to be stopped by the rough rope around her
breasts. 

Estrild shrieked in
pain and her body danced at the end of the hemp like a puppet compounding the
pain in her crushed, bloated tits terrifically.

�You will tell ME,
slut!� he barked at her. �And if there is the slightest difference between what
you told him and what you tell me, you will spend the next week strung up like
this. Now start!�

Estrild yelped in
pain. But she managed to subdue her crying and sobbing more and more in order
to give herself the breath she needed to form words.

And then she told Lord
Arrakur� everything.

&nbsp;

To be continued in�.

Chapter 4

&nbsp;

Absent Friends 

&nbsp;

Lead by Argan, the
group of runaway gladiators marched on, each step taking them farther and
farther away from their previous thralldom.

They had moved with
the utmost care, hiding in the thick green of the forests whenever Arrakur�s
patrols were nearby. It had been Argan�s careful planning of their route and
his rigorous leadership of the pack following him, that had saved them from
being recaptured. 

Not so few of the more
brutish fighters had openly vocalized their intention to plunder a few of the
solitary farms along their way for drink and food.

Argan�s harsh words
had put most of those endeavors to a halt, before they were brought into
action. Most of the time. 

One those occasions,
were words were no longer sufficient to subdue the lust for pillaging; he put
his iron fists to use. So far, they had kept the loudmouths of his company in
line.

Although he could
understand his mens` dissatisfaction to some extent, he insisted on living of
the food they hunted and slew themselves. 

As the company settled
for the night, Strymon approached Argan standing at the edge of the sorry
excuse of an encampment. 

Argan looked at his
friend. Strymon�s bearded face was mostly blazoned with a slight, good-natured
smile, as if life itself was all in all very amusing. Now his face was darkened
with concern. 

Being almost a head
taller then his life-long friend, Strymon looked down at Argan and sighed
wistfully.

�The men grow more and
more discontent, my friend. If you will not let them plunder on the farms
nearby, they may be off quite soon.�

Argan sighed as well,
gazing into the dark of night.

�I know. But I will
not have it.� He turned his head to look at his friend, his eyes blazing with
cold fire.

�Strymon, I don�t
intend to run from Arrakur�s tyranny much longer. I intend to take these men to
the mountains. Many of fled there from Arrakur. It is there I will build an
army�an army to battle this swine that destroyed our village and almost killed
all of our tribe. And if we do return, I don�t want to face a band of enraged
farmers and villages, whose crop had been stolen, whose men had been killed and
whose daughters and wives had been ravaged.�

The everlasting grin
returned to Strymon�s face.

�I suspected as much.
I thought you would let us escape slavery and leave it at that. By the gods,
Argan, I am with you. Let�s gather an army and fight back at this pig!�

Argan tipped his head,
acknowledging his friend�s consent to his plans. Then he gazed back into the
darkness and sighed again.

�I just whish, she
could be here!�

Strymon did not have
to ask, whom Argan was speaking of. He too grieved for his friend�s lover,
who�d died in battle defending their village from the marauders.

But his mourning could
not compete with the anguish his friend must be feeling. 

Nothing they did could
bring Amethea back from the dead. But they would avenge her dead.

It would take weeks,
maybe months before they would return to battle Arrakur�s tyranny. But they
would make him pay for the death of Amethea and all the others of their tribe.

&nbsp;

The squealing hinges
of her cell-door wakened Amethea as it was opened.

Four guards entered
and pulled her on her feet then dragged her out of the cell and down the hall. 

She had no idea, how
long time had passed since she fell asleep. She surmised that no more than a
few hours could have elapsed, though, since she neither felt particular rested
nor strengthened by her reprieve. The food and water had added a bit to her
amenitious vigor, but her body and mind still felt fatigued and enfeebled. 

Her unfavorable
condition was compounded by the dull, aching pain that still resided in her
breast-globes and womanhood. Amethea dimly tried to recall the feeling of her
body not aching. But the constant, nagging pain in her tits and cunt seemed to
have evaporated any other natural sensation; her nerve-endings were designed to
transmit to her brain. Each step she was forced to take, send a piercing,
stabbing pain into her beaten crotch. The slightest swaying of her brutalized
tit-cones caused them to send tiny lightings of pain through her chest. She was
tempted to yelp and gasp in pain with each and every step that she took but
managed to suffer in silence. She was determined to offer her captors as little
display of her agony as possible. Each scream unuttered, each tear unshed was a
small victory over those, who enjoyed hurting her, and she drew strength from
those puny triumphs.

And she doubtlessly
would need all the vigor she could muster since she was surely taken to the
torture-chamber for another bout with that twisted, little dispenser of pain.
Amethea grind her teeth as her hatred mounted, focusing on that dwarfish pig
awaiting her. She would not talk, she vowed. He would make her scream; he would
even manage to make her cry. This she could not prevent, she knew. But she
would not betray the rebels. They were the only chance they got.

But far back in her
mind, there was that mocking voice of another Amethea. 

Really? It whispered. My, we are brave and strong,
aren`t we? You really think you won�t talk when that swine gives you another
hell like the previous one? Your breasts still hurt, don�t they? And it hurts
down there, as well, No? Think you can take more of this, given the pain
already stored in those parts? When he tortures you down there again? Why don�t
you admit to yourself, how scared you are of any more pain and� SHUT UP!
Amethea snapped at that whispering, mocking voice and steeled herself against,
what she was unavoidably dragged towards to.

The guards stopped at
a wooden door at the perimeter of the dungeon and opened it. Amethea blinked in
surprise as she gazed into the room.

It was not a
torture-chamber. It was a spa.

In the middle of the
room there was a huge, oval shaped, wooden tub. At the tub�s side there was a
table filled up with soft towels. A huge kettle, big enough for Amethea to sit
in, was hanging over a fireplace. Another slightly smaller kettle was standing
beside it. The fair-haired warrioress could see that both gigantic cauldrons
were filled with water. The water in the heated kettle was almost boiling.

An old woman, dressed
in a simple brown robe, and two older men with similar wear were present.
Although not being a pain-chamber, Amethea found two things to be of menacing
foreboding. The hot water and four manacles, which were set in the bathtubs
upper edges, two at each side of the tub.

The guards forced
Amethea towards the huge pan and made her climb inside. They fastened her
ankles inside the manacles at the nether end of the tub before removing the
steel-yoke from her neck and thus freeing her arms�only to secure them in the
two manacles at the upper end of the tub.

Amethea was laying
inside the vat, her bottom resting on the wooden surface while her arms and
legs were pulled upwards to the edges of the tub and spread wide apart. She
growled at the guards, lewdly gazing down at her wide-open crotch and the pink
slit exposed to their raunchy merriment.

Then the guards
withdrew, two stepping outside the room to guard it from the corridor. The
other two guards remaining inside, posting themselves at the door.

Amethea felt somewhat
bewildered. But she did not let the puzzlement detract from her foremost
intention to escape. 

She pulled against the
manacles with all the strength the previous ordeals had spared to consume. But
she soon discovered, that those manacles were as relentless as any restraint
she had been held defenseless by since her capture.

Then the two men
lifted a huge wooden bucket from the floor and dipped into the kettle with hot
water. Filled to the rim with the heated liquid they carried the bucket with
united strength towards the bound woman in the tub.

They poured the water
into the vat between Amethea�s legs. She gasped in pain, as the hot liquid
sprinkled on her thighs, belly and cunt. She raised her backside of the tub�s
floor by her bound arms and legs as the hotness distributed itself over the
bottom. The men went to refill the bucket with hot water and returned to the
tub. Another dozen gallons of water joined the first and Amethea already could
no longer avoid contact with the surface of the zealous aqua. Her ass-cheeks
were stinging. And another bucket of hot water was added. Now her belly was
underneath the searing surface, as well. Then she almost screamed in pain, as
another bucket made the water rise to such level, that the hot liquid streamed
inside her open pussy-snatch. Then a bucket of cold water was mercifully added.
And another.

But the remaining void
inside the bucket was filled up with four additional buckets of hot water,
until Amethea was almost completely submerged.

Only her manacled feet
and hands and her head, from her chin upwards, was not under water. Since the
two main concerns of the tub�s design were to keep the water inside and the
prisoner secured inside the tub, as well, there was no platform of any sorts,
on which Amethea could rest her head.

She had to strain the
muscles in her neck, to keep her face above the water. As soon as she eased up
her struggle, her face would sink beneath the surface instantly.

The old maid stepped
towards the tub, a crude sponge and a piece of soap in her hands. She gestured
one of the man. He stepped closer and put a hand under Amethea�s neck to
support her head. Then the woman took Amethea�s, sloppy, fair-colored mass of
hair out of the water and began to rub the soap into it. Amethea could not help
but to let a silent sigh escape her throat, as the washing of her hair was the
first and single pleasant sensation she had had during her captivity.

She looked into the
face of the old woman but could find nothing in her hardened look that
indicated her being concerned in any way about the woman in the bathtub. 

The maid stuffed
Amethea�s hair back into the water and rinsed the soap out of it.

As she was finished
with her hair, the man let go of her Amethea�s head. Clearly it was considered
the responsibility of the warrioress to prevent herself from drowning. The old
croon then began washing Amethea�s face with the sponge. She rubbed more soap
into the swam and began to wash the fair-haired woman�s neck, then her
shoulders and arms. As the sponge traveled to Amethea�s chest, she hissed in
pain, as her still aching, tenderized breasts were grated. The old hag did not
pay the discomfort she caused any heed, though. She continued to soap Amethea`s
rib cage, her belly and then the sponge rubbed over the bound woman�s nether
lips. 

Amethea gasped, but
kept her tongue. But as the maid put the sponge away and took another item to
hand, the bound warrior-woman refused to remain silent.

The old hag was
holding another sponge in her hand. The sponge itself was cylindrical formed
and enclosed around a wooden club of no minor length and thickness. As she
lowered the soap-soaked sponge-cylinder into the water and pushed it�s tip
against Amethea�s cunt-slit, the warrioress protested in outrage.

�You won�t put that
inside me, you old croon!� she hissed.

The woman merely
nodded at the man, still standing beside the tub and having witnessed the
bathing of the beauteous female with as much indifference as the woman administering
it. He grabbed Amethea by her throat and with little effort, pushing against
her chin; he forced her head back and under water.

There was little
resistance, Amethea could offer, since the muscles in her neck were near
exhaustion from the constant effort of holding her head above the water.

The soapy fluid filled
her nostrils and made her eyes burn. This was a minor discomfort, however,
compared with the denial of oxygen. Her lungs began to burn and the lack of air
made her fight against the manacles holding her arms and legs with new, albeit
pointless, vigor. 

Her body squirmed as
much as it could inside the bath-tube, making her magnificent, wetly shining
breasts break the water�s surface and submerge repeatedly.

The man held her head
below for almost two minutes before he released the grip on her neck and
allowed Amethea to get her face above the water.

She gulped in whole
lungful of air in a frantic attempt to catch her breath, spluttering and
snorting water out of her nose. The old woman and the old man merely watched
her regaining her composure. No trace of emotion was evident in their faces.
They seemed to be neither taking pleasure nor discomfort in hurting the
fair-haired warrioress. She seemed to be nothing more to them than a thing they
were to clean up. Nothing more. 

Amethea felt the
cylindrical spoon pushing against her neither lips, again. And this time, she
did not protest.

Even as the old croon
rammed the sponge inside her pussy with much more force then necessary�no doubt
a bit of added punishment for her harsh words just before�Amethea did no more
than utter a deep grunt of subdued pain. 

She felt the sponge
move back and forth inside her cunt-shaft, as the old woman was practically
fucking her with it. She then felt the sponge being twisted around, while
moving up and down her pussy-tunnel. 

After a few minutes,
the old hag pulled the sponge out of her and Amethea sighed with relief. 

The old man reached
down and with some effort removed a huge, wooden plug at the base of the vat.
The water was gushing out and flowing along a drain set in the floor towards a
grilled hole in the middle of the room, descending into the castle�s sewers. 

Then, as the tube was
empty except of the soaking-wet and still bound nubile warrioress, Amethea�s
bath was finished by half a dozen buckets of hot water being poured out on her.

Then the guards from
outside reentered to join the two remaining, who had watched the bathing with
glee and amusement. The four of them opened the manacles around Amethea�s
ankles and wrists. Before the woman could even articulate an attempt at
fighting her way out of the spa inside her mind, the guards had her firmly in
their grasp, each holding one of her arms and one of her legs.

They carried her
towards a peculiar looking device. It was a wooden, horizontal board supported
by two iron poles. The board was in level with Amethea�s neck, as one of the
old men opened it, revealing three holes being sawn into the plank. As it
opened, it split itself in the middle, bisecting the three holes.

She did not have the
strength to fight against the four heavy-muscled guards, as they forced her
neck against the larger hole in the middle and her wrists against the two
smaller remaining holes. The plank was closed, after Amethea�s large fair-haired
crest had been pulled free of her neck. It closed tightly around her neck and
wrists, making it difficult to breath and impossible to pull her hands free.

She stood there on the
tip of her toes, her upper arms held up at the same height as her breasts, while
her forearms were pointing up in the air, pointing towards the wooden plank
encompassing Amethea�s wrists and neck.

The guards then lifted
her feet of the ground and fastened them to the iron poles, holding the plank.
Amethea growled in wordless protest, as manacles snapped shut around her
ankles. Not only were her legs spread wide apart once more; since her feet did
not support her body anymore, she had to strain the fatigued muscles in her
arms in order to relieve some of the pull on her neck.

Whereas the old men
and woman, who had bathed her, were as indifferent as before, the guards
snickered and leered at Amethea�s discomfort.

The old croon put a
stool behind the dangling warriorress and stepped onto it. Before Amethea could
begin to guess, what was to come, the old woman was starting to brush her hair.
The last day�s ordeals had left Amethea�s mane quite tangled and the old hag
began to grunt with the effort of putting the long strands in order.

The greater
discomfort, of course, were suffered by Amethea as the woman pulled and dragged
at her hair, relentlessly�sending an endless series of sharp, stinging pains
into her scalp. Amethea did not utter one sound of pain, however. She had
endured much, much worse. 

When the woman was
finished with her hair, it was drawn back completely from her face and dangling
down in wet-soaking, straight strands, almost reaching the small of her back. 

The old woman grabbed
Amethea�s hair and simply put it on the plank around her right hand. Then she
began putting perfumed ointment on Amethea�s exposed back and distributing it
on her damp flesh. She anointed the bound woman�s entire back and arms. Then
she began rubbing the ointment into Amethea�s ass-cheeks. Then her legs and
feet.

The bound woman found
her suspicions, she had held since the bath, confirmed. She may have the
opportunity for escape, soon. She was prepared to please a male. Probably
Arrakur�s groveling hound Zohar, possibly the tyrant-pig Arrakur himself.

In any case, a
lecherous man could become careless and give her an opportunity to free herself
from whatever bonds she would be subjected to at that time.

Whoever it was, she
promised herself to rip off his manhood and crush his stones beneath her foot,
before she would make her escape.

No man subjecting a
woman to the horrors she had endured, deserved to life.

The old croon was
finished with Amethea�s backside and concentrated her efforts on the warrioress
magnificent breast globes. The mere touch on her tenderized mammal cones made
Amethea wince, but she endured with her lips tightly closed as her breasts were
rolled around on her chest. Soon, her tits were shining and glistening with
sweet-smelling ointment, the two dark nipples pointing up proudly, glittering
like two brown, wet pepples.

A sight that made the
guards breathing heavier, as the old hag worked on Amethea�s flat belly, making
her way down both her legs and feet in turn. Then, she deftly rubbed the
ointment between the bound woman�s spread legs. She rubbed it into the cleft of
her ass-cheeks and all around her pussy-lips. Amethea stared down at the old
woman, harassing her womanhood with the ever-present detachment, in utter
contempt. She could not bring herself to hate her, though.

She was just a tool,
she thought. Just like the whip with the iron balls, that Zohar had used on her
pussy a mere day ago had been a tool. There was no use in hating the whip. It
was a waste of strength. But, oh, how she hated the man who had handled the
whip. How she was thirsting to hear him scream in pain. 

Soon, she told
herself. Soon.

&nbsp;

Estrild was dragged
along the row of cell-doors by two guards.

Since she had been
taken to Zohar�s torture chamber, she had been naked and now she barely
perceived her nudeness. She also barely paid any attention anymore to the ever-present
noise in the background: the sound of muffled screams of pain and sobs and
subdued, threatening voices of torturers and the high-pitched voices pleading
for mercy or swearing to not knowing anything

The guards stopped at
a door, unlocked it and pushed the dainty, green-eyed girl into the cell.
Estrild looked around in fear, apprehensive of finding any tools of torture
inside the cell and hoping to just being locked away. Amazingly to her, she
wouldn�t even mind the guards raping her that much. Just no more torture. Not
ever again.

�Well, rebel-slut!
Would you not greet your companion in treason?� one of the guards said with a
chuckle.

Estrild blinked,
trying to pierce the semidarkness of the cell. As her eyes adjusted themselves
to the twilight, she saw someone else in the cell beside her and the guards.

Tianara was hanging
from the ceiling of the cell. Her wrists were locked into a set of manacles.
Her ankles as well. To the raven-haired warrior-woman�s dismay, however, all
four manacles were closely attached to one thick chain hanging from the
ceiling. Her wrists had been bound to the chain first, and then her legs had
been pulled back and up behind her. Farther and farther they had been pulled,
until they met the chain, to which her hands were fettered. There they had been
manacled as well, making her body arching backwards and putting terribly
agonizing strain on her lithe form. She was hanging in midair like a perfectly
shaped ring of female flesh on a chain, dangling helplessly and quivering with
pain. Pain that had increased with each minute she had been kept in this cruel
bondage. She felt like her stomach splitting open at any second from the
incredible strain, her posture put on her belly. In addition, there was the
near blinding agony of her arched back, making her believe and almost wish for
her spine to break with each beat of her heart.

She moaned constantly,
occasionally yelping and crying out when a fresh surge of pain attacked her
tautened body.

Estrild looked at
Tianara with pity then new fear crept up inside her belly, as the guards pulled
her arms up and put manacles around her wrists. She looked up and saw her hands
being cuffed to a large chain hanging from the ceiling. Only two of the four
manacles being occupied by her wrists.

Before she could even
begin to plead with her henchmen, her legs were pulled up behind her and
fastened to the remaining cuffs on the chain above her head.

Estrild�s big green
eyes snapped wide open as the terrible, painful traction began torturing her
slender body.

�Noooo�please!� she
screamed. �No, please! I told you all I know. Why are you still torturing me!�
she wailed.

One of the guards
merely snorted.

�Stupid slut!� he
said, playfully squeezing Estrild�s right nipple.

�This isn�t torture.
It�s just a little something to keep you two occupied until his Excellency
decides what is to become of you. And if I were you, I would enjoy this as long
as it lasts. You will get Lord Arrakur�s attention soon enough. And as soon as
he deals with you two rebel-sluts, you will wish to be back in this cell strung
up like this again. You will beg to be strung up like this, I would say. Come
to think of it, I would predict you two will be begging to be allowed to do all
sorts of things for his excellency in exchange for a tiny reprieve from his
special tortures.�

Warming to the
subject, the guard took a good grip on Estrild�s right breast and began
twisting the entire tit-globe around. The girl screamed in agony, as her
tortured mammal flesh was brutally twisted and squashed. It would have hurt
sufficiently, if Zohar had not tortured her breasts so viciously just before.
As it was, the pain was simply unendurable.

Estrild scream faded
into a gasping and sobbing string of pleas for mercy and yelps of pain. Fresh
tears streamed down her face.

�But first, his
lordship will deal with your yellow-haired friend. And you would not want to be
in her skin right now, I can promise you that.�

The guard clicked his
tongue, bringing the image of Amethea fighting his comrades at the market
square and killing quiet a few of his drinking friends before being overpowered
and arrested.

�Being a rebel will
make her suffer under his Excellency�s special care. Being such a pretty
slut-whore will make her suffer at least five times more than what the two of
you are going to get. And being such a haughty one, from what I�ve heard�.my,
she will probably get more torture and pain than any whore in this dungeon had
ever known. So you better pity that bloodthirsty sword-slut, you sniveling
whore. Because I for one look forward to stand guard in front of his lordship�s
torture-chamber and listen to that slut�s screaming her lungs out and begging
for mercy!�

He finally let go of
Estrild�s breast and turned to leave the cell together with his comrade. Just before
closing the door, the guard took one last look at the two nude women hanging in
midair, their bodies pulled into two O-shaped forms of relentless agony.

�If you try to moan a
bit less, you may be able to hear her screaming, as well!� he chuckled and
closed the door.

For some time, the
only sounds in the cell were the squeals and moans and occasional yelps of pain
coming from the two women in torment. Their strained bodies dangling in the
air, slowly swiveling.

Then, as if she had to
gather her strength for some time before she could utter the words, Tianara
spoke with a strange mixture of frustration and sorrow.

�You told them
everything.� 

It was neither a
question, nor really an accusation. More a statement of another
heart-shattering fact in a long row of misfortunes that had haunted their lives
in the past week. The attack on their village, the killing of their loved ones,
their journey into danger on a quest to save their remaining tribesmen, their
capture�.and the raping and torturing of their bodies. 

Tianara fought down
her tears. She would not permit herself to give into hopelessness. They would
find a way out of this. She would find a way. And if not her, Amethea would
find a way. She always had before, had she not?

Tianara repeated the
words inside her head, over and over. Amethea would find a way. She would.

Then she heard
something. A sound that came from far away, yet powerful enough to overshadow
the constant noises of anguish and pain outside and the ceaseless moaning by
herself and Estrild inside their cell.

At first, she could
not fully ascertain what the sound was. But then it came again. And again.� And then, with a sinking feeling, Tianara
realized, what it was.

It was Amethea. 

And the sounds were
her long-drawn, piercing screams of agony.

Chapter 5

&nbsp;

Finally Alone

&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Shortly before,
Amethea was not yet screaming.

She was, however in
pain. The guards had put her in heavy chains after the old woman had finally
finished with the anointment of her nubile body and taken her to another room,
which was seemed to be located farther away from the main dungeon and the
cells. Inside that room they replaced the chains with four other ones. 

The new chains held
her body spread-eagled in midair, each chain linked to heavy iron manacles set
tightly around her wrists and ankles and pulled viciously taut. The other end
of each chain went to two thick, wooden pillars standing almost four meters
apart from each other. 

Between those posts,
Amethea was hanging � arms stretched out to either side of her torso and slightly
raised, so that her fisted hands were about two inches above the height of her
head. Her legs were spread apart wide enough to put uncomfortable strain on her
thigh tendons. Her feet twisted in their fetters in a vain attempt to touch the
floor, a few inches below. 

The guards left her
alone in this position and closed the heavy, wooden door behind them. As the
minutes passed, Amethea�s arms and legs began to hurt from the constant strain
put on them by the chains and the weight of her body. Pain also began to grow
in her abdomen, due to being pulled in four different directions.� 

To make matters worse,
the constant, gnawing pain inside her breasts and her brutalized cunt had not
yet decreased. 

As she looked around
the room with growing anxiety, she realized with a feeling close to
hopelessness, that those special aching body parts would not get a chance to
recover in the immediate future. This was another torture chamber.

Torches were set in
the walls all around and illuminating the frightening equipment that presented
itself to the defenseless woman.

The wooden pillars,
she was chained to, were standing at one wide corner of the chamber. The rest
of the chamber was filled with more than a dozen of strange, sinister looking
objects and devices. Tables with restraining cuffs at the edges, a wooden yoke
like the one she had been bound to in the spa and a number of other devices
made of wood or iron with restraining cuffs attached to them. In what position
a human being could possibly be restrained on those objects was beyond
Amethea�s imagination. She had no desire to find out, either, but had little
illusions she would learn about the exact functions of some of them.

There were numerous
chains hanging from the ceiling, mostly with iron rings or manacles attached to
them. One side of the chamber was covered with iron rings set in the wall. At
the opposite side was a huge table standing with large drawers. The tabletop
was covered with cuffs, whips, pincers, branding irons and many other things,
she could not or refused to recognize. 

At the other end of
the chamber, right opposite of her, there was a huge, soft bed with silken
sheets. At each of the four corner of the bed, there were chains with cuffs
attached to each leg of the bedstead.

Amethea caught herself
breathing heavily and tried to calm herself.

Despite knowing
better, she tested the strength of the chains holding her spread-eagled in
mid-air like a butterfly on a pin. Not the slightest bit of slack. Hopeless.

Suddenly, she heard
the door open. She closed her eyes briefly, taking a last deep breath. Then she
opened her eyes to stare blankly at the wall over the bed at the far end of the
torture chamber.

Steps were
approaching, but she did not take her gaze from the wall to see who it was. She
did expect to see the little piggish torture master step into her view, but was
not entirely surprised to see Lord Arrakur step in front of her.

He was wearing a
black, silken robe, which fell down to the floor. The robe was cut in front and
the upper part was open to reveal some of his hairy chest and the upper bulge
of his well-fed belly.

His gaze went up and
down her body, a cold smile around his lips. Amethea gazed back in contempt.

Nevertheless, Arrakur
clearly liked what he saw. The perfumed body-oil had given her skin most of
it�s healthy tone back, and Amethea�s magnificent, stretched body shone in the
light of the torches. Her face was still unmarked and radiated with arrogant
beauty. Her freshly washed hair was again just like a lioness` crest, framing
her pretty face and falling down over her shoulder blades and almost reaching
the small of her back.

Her body was not
completely unmarked, of course. There were some bruises on her full, taut
breasts with their brown nipples standing almost arrogantly out on top of her
perfect tit-globes. And another set of bruises barely visible between her
widespread legs. Yet, considering the amount of pain and abuse Amethea had to
endure so far, her body was in surprisingly good condition.

�Well, well.� Arrakur
said, crossing his arms on his chest. �I can see that Zohar has not damaged
your beauty while questioning you. You should be thankful for that, should you
not?�

Amethea did not
answer. Her breathing, formerly calmed down, now quickened a bit, causing her
breasts to fall and rise more prominently. 

�But
you would not know of such. You rebels are all alike: troublesome and
insolent.�

Arrakur
stepped around the left pole and began circling Amethea, letting his gaze
wander all over her magnificent, nubile body.

�Whatever
you think, I am no rebel. There is nothing I can tell you!�

Amethea bit
her lips, the moment she said those words. She knew that every word she spoke
to her captors would not improve her situation. Worse yet: everything word she
uttered could become a step into submission. Silence was the only real weapon
she had at her disposal. And as a warrior she was obliged to use that one
weapon against her enemies.

Arrakur,
slowly stepping around and facing her again, merely smiled.

�You are
lying, of course. But that is no longer of any consequence. You are not here to
be interrogated.�

He stood in
front of her, hands placed on his hips and his smile widened.

�Your name
is Amethea. You and two of your friends, who fancy themselves as warriors came
here to free some slaves I commandeered from your village. You joined forces
with the rebels, who hide themselves in the catacombs under the city. The
catacombs have been searched and quite a number of rebels have been killed. We
may have not taken care of all of them, but I am quite convinced, your rebel
friends will pose no immediate threat to me.�

Amethea
closed her eyes in dismay. How many rebels were actually killed? Was the little
girl, Dariac, still alive? Was her father still alive? In any case, the rebels
would not make an attack against Arrakur�s forces anytime soon. 

If they
ever will.

�That
little green-eyed slut told us everything. You suffered for nothing, your dumb
whore!� Arrakur chuckled.

�So, there
is no point in interrogating you anymore. Is there?�

As he
stepped closer, his hand came up and began fondling her breasts, tenderly.

�But that
does not mean, that I will not torture you, my pretty. In fact, I intend to
torture you quite thoroughly. And since this is done only for my pleasure and
not to make you talk anymore�well, there is actually no way for you to put an
end to it by giving me those information, I already have!�

Amethea
glared with absolute hatred in her eyes into his wickedly smiling face. Only a
quick movement of her larynx, as she tried to moisten her suddenly dry tongue,
betrayed the anxiety his words raised in her.

He stepped
behind her again and put both his hands on her firm, perfectly shaped buttocks,
digging his fingers into her flesh and kneading the muscled cheeks.

Amethea�s
breathing quickened some more. Partly because of the repugnance she felt as the
tyrant fondled her ass-cheeks, partly because of her worst fears having become
reality. Estrild has been caught, she had talked, and the rebels have been
defeated. And now she faced the worst fate a woman could meet.

Arrakur
went to the table, picking up a simple, wooden cane. He balanced it in his
hand, then resumed his position behind the spread-eagled, hanging woman.

The cane
sliced through the air and cracked against Amethea�s left buttock. 

She grunted
in pain, as the cane sank into her cheek. When Arrakur withdrew the switch, a
darkened welt appeared on the exquisite roundness of her backside. He raised
the cane and brought it down again, this time on her left ass-cheek. 

Again, the
blow drew a grunt from the proud warrioress` throat. The pain was bad, but not
as bad as other things, Amethea had experienced at the hands of Arrakur�s
henchmen. That did not comfort her, though. She knew that this was just the
prelude for worse things to come.

Arrakur
began to switch Amethea�s ass in earnest, letting the cane dance on her
quivering, spasming buttocks as she grunted and hissed with each impact on her
tender backside. Her subdued outbursts were accompanied by the sound of the
wooden cane cracking against her firm buttocks relentlessly.

Her
assailant felt his cock twitching and stiffening beneath his robe as he watched
her ass taking impact after impact of the switch. He wore nothing beneath it
and had to restrain himself from tearing it off his body and ram his cock
inside her. 

This wasn�t
the moment, he told himself. Not by far.

After about
three dozens of strokes the caning stopped. Amethea panted, sweat glistening on
her body and mingling with the perfumed oil making her smelling all the sweeter
to her torturer. 

Her ass was
crisscrossed with dark welts and a few trickles of blood were slowly running
down her legs. Arrakur was panting himself as he admired his handiwork. 

He put the
cane back on the table and returned with a whip. It was two meter in length and
very sturdy. Arrakur took a grip on Amethea�s hair and pulled it away from her
back. He shoved it over her shoulders, making it fall down over her breasts.
Then he took a long, appreciative look at her exposed back, the smooth muscle-tissue
working under the skin and rippling around her shoulder blades. 

�This is
not to make you talk, slut. But that does not mean you have to stay totally
silent.� He smugly passed on. �It certainly in order for you to scream. And it
will heighten my pleasure doing this to you!�

Amethea
replied with one word spoken in a low, venomous tone of voice.

�Pig!�

The first
blow of the whip cracked against her back, right over her shoulder blades.

Amethea
felt the air pressed out of her lungs by the force of the terrible impact on
her back. She inhaled sharply, making a hissing sound as she filled her lungs
again. Then she struggled with all her might against letting a furious scream
of pain escape her throat as she exhaled.

Arrakur
watched a deep red welt appearing on her back where his whip had hit her. He
drew back the whip and let it crack against the bound woman again. This time
she was hit right over her kidneys. 

Despite her
tight bondage, Amethea felt herself being pushed forward against the chains by
the force of the blow. Then her back exploded in pain. Again she fought against
the scream of pain, that desperately tried to escape her lungs and testify to
her agony. 

The whip
hit her back again. And again. 

The blows
came in regular intervals with vicious, yet not totally unrestrained force. 

Arrakur was
not about to whip her back into shreds completely. But that was a minor relief
for Amethea. Regardless of the actual restrain of her tormentor, the pain was
tremendous. 

She grunted
loudly with each blow of the whip cracking against her back. 

As Arrakur
had no more unmarked skin on her back to aim his blows at, Amethea did start to
scream with the pain of having his whip beating already blemished skin and
previously tortured nerve-endings.

He smiled
in satisfaction, savouring the triumph of having made his beauteous prisoner
scream and increased the force of his whipping.

The black
leathery lash smacked into her back again and again and again, relentlessly
throwing her forward in her chains and driving grunts, screams and sobs of pain
from her lungs. Amethea shook her head in mindless pain, twisting her dangling
feet in their shackles, fisting and un-fisting her hands in a hopeless attempt
to do something�anything to escape the beating. 

But the
chains held her splendid body hanging in midair, unyieldingly.

In time,
Arrakur was either finished, bored or fatigued by the whipping he had
administered. The woman did not care the cause, but felt relieve flooding over
her, when the last lash of the whip was not followed by the next. The relieve,
however, could not eliminate the waves of pain, the wrecked nerve-endings in
her back and ass-cheeks were sending into her body.

Breathing
heavily, Arrakur gazed at the countless welts criss-crossing Amethea�s entire
backside. He went around the bound woman towards the large table.

There was a
carafe and goblet waiting for him and he poured himself some wine. He looked at
the panting, chained woman as he slowly sipped his wine. His cock was still
hard underneath his robe and he felt the silk caressing the tip of his male
sceptre as he watched his victim and tried to decide what to do to her next.

He had so
many ways of inflicting pain on that magnificent female, that it was hard to
choose her next ordeal. He let his gaze wander around the torture chamber and
it�s devices. 

No, he
thought to herself. None of the machines. Not just yet.

He put the
goblet down and approached Amethea, standing in front of her and watching her
proud breasts rise and fall, steadily. He looked into her hateful eyes, then
redirected his attention at her full, firm mammaries.

He grabbed
her nipples with each of his hands, trapping the hard, perky buds between his
thumbs and first fingers. Amethea hissed in disgust, then in pain as Arrakur
twisted the tips of her breasts.

Her stomach
had turned to ice as soon as he had reached for her breasts. As tender as they
were to begin with, due to the previous tortures Amethea�s breasts were
basically two globes of incarnated ache. The slightest touch was enough to send
a surge of pain through them.

Now, as her
tormentor cruelly twisted her nipples, she felt as if two white-hot pokers had
been plunged into the two centres of her tits, burning them up from the inside.

She bit her
lip, trying to prevent the scream to come out. But all she managed was to
subdue it into a drawn out moan of pain.

Arrakur
grinned nastily at her and twisted her nipples the other way around. Then he
began to pull. He pulled, his fingers clamped around her nipples, trapping her
tit-tips in a vice-like grip. Amethea couldn�t help but whine in pain as he
kept pulling at her nipples.

The agony
in her breasts mounted steadily, as her two mammaries were drawn into long
cones. He kept pulling at her tits until Amethea was certain that either her
nipples would pop off her breasts or that the skin at the bases of her globes
would tear.

The pain
was so great, it made her see stars. Then it got even worse, as her torturer
couldn�t possibly make her breasts go any farther and cruelly began twisting
her nipples again.

Amethea�s
whining became a cry of agony and anguish. Then she yelped with a fresh surge
of pain, as Arrakur let go of her nipples and her breasts bounced and jiggled
on her chest and instantly resumed their natural shape.

�It�s
always the same with your kind.� He mused; watching her proud breasts rise and
fall with her quickened breathing. Then he looked into her face, meeting the
baleful look in her eyes with one of mockery.

�You and
each other whore like you put on a sword and think yourself as strong and tough
as a man. But as soon as we do a few things to these two beauties you start to
scream and cry and eventually grovel at our feet.�

He slapped
her right breast with the palm of his left hand. The sound of hard bones
impacting on soft flesh filled the chamber, instantly followed by her cry of
pain and outrage. 

Then he
slapped her left breast with his right hand. Then her right, then her left.

He went on
slapping her tit-globes with both hands, making the meaty orbs dance and shake
on her chest, the sensitive mammaries quivering under the relentless assault.

Amethea
screamed in agony as her breasts took this punishment. She twisted and jerked
in her chains, instinctively trying to turn her body and protect her
defenceless tits. But it was hopeless. All she could do was hang there and take
it.

Beating a
woman�s breasts was one of the most vicious things a man could do to her. For
one because of their tenderness, their vulnerability. On the other side it was
such a perfidious act, considering that the man was beating away on the same
symbol of femaleness that have nurtured and fed him when he was an infant.
Amethea had no illusion about her captor�s cruelty. And still the little girl
inside her, who she thought buried long ago under layers upon layers of
hardships and privations, the little girl who still believed in the general
goodness of people, cried inside her mind with baffled horror: why the
breasts, oh why the breasts, it hurts SO MUCH, why does he do that to me, why
there?!!

SLAP!!
SLAP!! SLAP!! SLAP!! SLAP!! SLAP!! SLAP!! SLAP!! SLAP!! SLAP!!

Arrakur was
enjoying himself immensely, as he kept beating and slapping the woman�s poor
tits around on her chest. He loved the feeling of his hands clashing into the
sensitive meat, feeling the fleshy orb yielding under his blow, quivering,
shaking, then trembling under the next assault. And how he loved to watch her
face twisted in agony, hearing her sobs and cries and yelps. His cock was so
hard it almost hurt.

He pulled
off his robe, baring himself in front of his victim, standing before her as
naked as she was. His member pointing straight up at her. He was breathing as
heavily as she was; as he watched her fiery red tits rise and fall through slit
eyes.

Then he quickly went
to the table and picked up something that looked like a fork, though much
bigger and made of heavy wood. 

The �fork� was about a
three foot long with three thin, wooden teeth protruding from its tip. The
�teeth� covered a grown male�s hand in width and length and were set apart with
two fingers worth of free space between them.

He threw his arm
forward, crashing the teeth across the Amethea`s right breast. The force of the
impact crushed the soft meaty orb, the teeth slapping down on the malleable
flesh with terrific force, spreading it apart, sending wads of soft meat up
between them as they dug deep furrows in the already bruised tit.� She screamed anew, a cry of utterly helpless
torment that resounded from the walls of the chamber and made Arrakur�s stomach
twist and churn in pleasure.

He withdrew the fork,
watching the pain-ravaged orb bouncing back into its normal shape, yet still
quivering from the blow. Without delay, he hit her left breast, making the
teeth of the fork digging into the tender mammary, literally dividing her tit
into four bulging waves of tormented tit-flesh oozing out between them.

Amethea screamed at
the top of her lungs as she hung in her chains, helplessly.

The pain was so
incredible it almost made her vomit. For a crazed second, she almost felt
relief as she thought off her breasts now as surely destroyed beyond repair.
Relief at the thought, that they could not possibly be used anymore to cause
her pain.

But that gleam of hope
was shattered by another blow to her right breast, which was if possible, even
more painful than the previous. Then he hit her left breast again.

Then her right. Then
her left. Then her right.

He kept beating her
poor tits with the fork, while she struggled in her chains, desperately trying
to move her chest away from the horrible punishment, her screaming becoming
more and more hoarse with each blow to her tits.

Arrakur was almost in
ecstasy as he let the blows rain on her breasts. He hit them from above and
below, then hitting them sideways, yet always making sure for the teeth to splat
down on her entire breast-meat with each and every blow. He noticed in wicked
fascination how her screams became just a little bit louder and more pitiful,
when the middle tooth of the fork managed to hit her tender nipple.

His belly felt like
being filled with warm honey as he dealt out his punishment on the helpless
female. His cock was at the brink of bursting.

Then she cried out
shrilly, as he hit her right nipple yet again, and Arrakur felt the hot semen
build up in his member beyond the point of restraining it.

He gripped his cock
and rubbed it two times before the white-hot wads of semen shot out of its tip.
He sprayed it on his sobbing captive, the thick spurts splashing against her
belly and thighs. She hardly noticed it at first, her head rolling with her
eyes half-closed. All she felt was the absence of the next blow and the
explosion of fresh pain inside her mammal globes now aching horribly and
throbbing with relentless agony.

Arrakur grunted in
brutish pleasure as his cock released the last wad of cum on his moaning
victim. He stepped back and watched his work with the usual calm after the
climax. 

Her head was resting
on her chest, the thick strands of curled hair wet from sweat. Her breasts were
slightly swollen from the beating and purple in color. 

He took a grip of her
hair and pulled her face up. It was twisted in pain and misery, tears running
down her cheek. Yet the look in her eyes hadn�t changed. It was still one of
hate and contempt, promising him a gruesome death if their positions would be
reversed.

�I�.� She began,
swallowing hard and trying to moisten her tongue so that she could continue to
speak. 

��I had taken you to
be a man of great swiftness�.ungh�in matters of that worm-sized member of
yours. You proved me right!�

Arrakur smiled, a
terrible thing to look at. Although her words did sting, he found her defiance
in face of her pain a most pleasurable thing, indeed. 

He pushed the fork
against her left breast, slightly pressing the wood of its teeth into her
beaten mammary. He heard her hissing in pain and anguish and found it as
delightful as the flicker of fear in her eyes.

�Insolent whore!� he
said. �You think this was pain? You think this was the worst that you could get
from me? Do you know, what I intend to do with you?�

He began circling the
fork on her tit, rolling the pain-pounding globe over her chest as she winced
and moaned in fresh pain.

�I will torture you
until you beg for mercy. Until you crawl before me and lick the dirt from the
soles of my boot. And when you are broken�then I will punish you for
your insolence.

Then I will have you tortured to death as slowly as
none of my prisoners before. And I will savor every second of it from right now
until the last beat of your heart. So by all means, keep up the fight for as
long as you can, slut! The longer you hold out, the greater the pleasure you
supply me with.�

He let go of her hair
and returned to the table, his formerly hard cock now dangling softly between
his legs as he walked away from his captive.

Amethea�s chin again
rested on her chest, as she tried to gather her strength for the next ordeal.
She had no idea what he would do to her next, but the scrubbing sound of iron
being dragged off the wooden tabletop made her heart pound in fresh anxiety.

Arrakur stepped back
in front of her, holding a pair of iron hoops connected with several leather
thongs in his hands.

The rings themselves
were merely big enough to allow Arrakur to push three of his fingers through,
should he wish it. Two straps connected them. One quite short, the other
considerably longer. Two additional thongs were hanging down from each of the
rings.

A fifth strap
interlocked with the shorter one connecting the two loops. This one was the
longest and had a sturdy leather belt attached to it�s end. 

Grinning wickedly, the
tyrant placed the long strap over Amethea�s head and around her neck, tucking
it away underneath the fair crest of her hair.

He barely managed to
get his hand away from her teeth, as she suddenly tried to bite him.

It did not faze him,
however.

Smiling knowingly, he
placed the leather belt around Amethea�s waist. He pulled the belt horribly
tight, making it dig deep into her belly before he closed it. 

Amethea yelped in
pain, as the cold iron rings and the taut straps pressed down on her
insufferably tenderized breasts. The rings were right on top of her nipples;
making the two fleshy buds stick out from the center of each loop, while the
straps were pressing down on her mammal globes. Having her waist compressed
this way, caused the woman�s chest to rise and fall more prominently and added
to her pain. 

Arrakur�s member had
begun to stir as he had placed the rings on Amethea�s chest. It slowly began to
swell with renewed lust, as he tightened the two remaining leather straps
around her back, forcing the rings even deeper into his captives cruelly
deformed tits. Her breasts were now literally quartered on her chest by the
leather straps, her aching tit-meat bulging out between the merciless bondage. 

Amethea tried to
steady her breathing in an attempt to ease the agony it caused pushing her
mammaries against the cruel straps and iron rings crushing them. She stared
into Arrakur�s smiling face with all the venom eating away at her soul. 

His smile, however,
widened into an almost insane grin of pure malicious evil as he placed one of
his hand on the ring on her left breast while his other hand grabbed her
strutting nipple�and began to pull.

Amethea screamed in
pain and outrage, staring on her breast in disbelief as he pulled at her nipple
relentlessly - inch by agonizing inch pulling her pain-wrecked breast trough
the tiny loop. Suppose Amethea had ever in her life been as insane as her
captors and considered doing this to her breasts, she would have deemed it
impossible. Yet, it was possible. 

But the pain was
beyond any female endurance. She screamed and cursed and spat, as the entire
length of her tit was pulled through the loop with maddening slowness. Nerves
and glances were horribly compressed while being squeezed through the tiny opening
sending shockwaves of unbelievable pain through Amethea�s breast.

Arrakur grunted with
the effort of pulling the resisting flesh through the loop. Still the joy of
her pain was overshadowing the taxation by far. He could feel her heart beating
savagely against his hand pressing against her chest. He listened to her
screams with utter delight and watched her breast oozing out in front of the
tiny ring with fascination.

He finally got all of
her tit through. He watched it for a few seconds before starting on her right
breast.

Again, Amethea
screamed and shook her head madly as her other breast was crushed and squeezed
through the other ring. It seemed like an eternity before he finally finished
and stood before her, panting with the effort, hands placed on his naked hips
and his hard cock once more pointing straight in the air.

Amethea sobbed and
wept, occasionally yelping with fresh pain. Her breasts were deformed into two
horribly taut, bloated balls. Their natural shape had been transformed into a
pair of mushroom-shaped globes of compressed mammal flesh, seemingly at the
verge of bursting under the pressure any second, the skin drawn horribly tight
around them. As Amethea stared down on them in disbelieving horror, they looked
to her more like two totally alien objects attached to her chest then her own
breasts.

Regrettably for her,
however, those objects were her breasts. And if nothing else, they were
attached to her by the constant, relentless waves of agony they send into her
nervous system. Even through her suffering, Amethea asked herself in horror how
on earth it would be possible to take the rings off again. If her tormentor was
even planning to do so.

�Well, well.� Arrakur
chuckled. �This was no easy task, I assure you. Those two seem to be as rebellious
as yourself, you slut!�

He ran his fingertips
over the incredibly taut surface of her breasts, as fascinated by the abnormal
sight of them as he was by the horrible new pain this caused his captive.

�They do look pretty
this way, don�t you agree?� he taunted, licking his dry lips. 

�Let us see, if my
improvement of their looks has heightened their resistibility, as well, shall
we?� he moved back to the table once more to return with a simple, thin wooden
cane.

Amethea shook her head
in muted denial, eyes glued to the cane in his hand.

This could not be
happening. Even he could not do this to her. No human being should be able to
even think about doing this.

She stared at the cane
being raised in the air, sobbing hopelessly.

Then the rod whooshed
through the air and hit her bloated, right breast with devastating force.

It splatted down on
her tit.... unbelievably calving her globe in half despite the mammary�s
incredible tightness.

Amethea yelled in
pain, the sound almost inhuman. Agony exploded in her tit, piling up on the
constant ache of the previous beating and the ongoing pain caused by the cruel
bondage.

Arrakur pulled the
cane away and watched her tit bouncing back, resuming it�s unnatural, painfully
bloated shape. The woman kept screaming, though.

He aimed the cane at
her left breast, hitting it as hard as he could, making the wood slice into the
agonized meat of her tit.

Her screaming went on
and on, as he grunted in pleasure. His hard cock switching with pleasure and
fuck-lust as he pulled the cane away again and hit her right breast.

Then her left. Then
her right. Then her left.

Amethea
roared in pain as he kept beating her poor tits, trashing wildly in her chains
keeping her spread-eagled in midair, providing her tormentor with the twisted pleasure
he sought for.

Arrakur was
in a state of blissful raunchiness as he watched her struggles and listened to
her pitiful cries of pain and sobs of utter despair. A fireball of pleasurable
heat was burning in his guts and his hard cock was pointing up menacingly at
the writhing nude body of the tortured woman. He loved the sensation of hitting
her breasts with the cane, feeling the resilience of the flesh being driven
inward by the impact of his blow, relishing in the knowledge of the pain he
caused her.

In time,
his beating of her tits ceased. Not out of mercy for his victim. Merely because
his arm had grown tired and her shrill screams of agony had turned into grunts
of pain.

He put the
cane aside and produced another leather strap from the seemingly endless supply
of torture items of the table. It was short and had a wide noose attached to
its end. 

The noose
was placed around Amethea�s cheek and drawn tight. It was pulling at the
corners of her mouth as it was fastened under her ears. He pulled her hair out
from under the loop and tightened it further, making it digging painfully into
her mouth. She moaned but was far to weak to offer any resistance like before
when she had tried to bite him.

The other
end of the leather thong was fastened to the straps of the breast-squeezing
harness on her back. By pulling the strap tight and fixing it there, Arrakur
was pulling Amethea�s head back, making her look up at the ceiling. 

She then
felt her ankles being freed from the chains and falling weakly to the ground.
She could not muster the strength to stand on her feet, but her partial freedom
was short-lived, anyway. 

Arrakur
pulled down other chains from the ceiling far behind the still bound torture
victim and attached them to the manacles encompassing her ankles. He then
pulled them back up by turning a lever at the wall and Amethea�s legs were
dragged into the air behind her�still spread wide apart. Still smiling with
anticipation, Arrakur operated another lever and the chains, from which she
hung by her arms, were climbing down, lowering her body towards the ground.
When it stopped, Amethea was still hanging in the air, arms wide apart, her
underbelly arched backwards and her wide spread legs splayed out wide behind
her. 

Arrakur
then stepped in front of her, licking his lips. 

She was
forced to look up at his smiling face trough bleary eyes, low moans of pain
coming through the strap in her mouth, serving as an insufficient gag. Yet the
purpose of the strap was not to gag her. It was meant to keep her teeth out of
reach. 

With a
feeling close to disbelieving resignation Amethea realized what her tormentor
intended to do to her. 

Arrakur
reached for her beaten, savagely aching breasts. They were exactly in level
with his cock, hardened by the pain inflicted on them. He crushed her bloated
tits around his cock as she screamed and whined in renewed agony. He buried his
cock inside the cleavage of her breasts and used them to rub his cock with. The
aching mammaries felt incredibly hot in his hands and around his strutting
member. 

He looked
down into her face, twisted in pain and agony, with delight as he cruelly used
her tortured breasts to pleasure himself. He dug his fingers into her taut
flesh, viciously, eager to seize every opportunity to cause her pain and thus
heightening his pleasure.

Amethea
could do nothing but endure the act, suffering the pain of his cruel hands
kneading her inhumanly tenderised breasts and using them to stroke his hard
member. The sickening male scent of his cock filling her nostrils was nothing
compared to the pain and the perfidious act in itself.

He withdrew
his cock for a moment to poke its engorged tip against her bloated
breast-globes. Groaning with lecherous delight, he rubbed the tip of his
prick-head over her nipples for a while, making the hard, wrinkled tit-tip
caress his sensitive piss-slit. He then slapped her tits with his cock, making
the hard male flesh whack against her horribly aching breasts. Even those
comparatively harmless attacks made her sob and whimper in anguish, much so to
his twisted merriment.

He then
buried his cock again between her breasts, once more crushing them around his
twitching member with his hands and misusing her tortured bosom to stroke his
cock. She sobbed and sniffed, then began to utter a long-drawn, crestfallen
wail of torment as his pleasure mounted and he rubbed her breasts up and down
his cock with more and more agitated movements.

Then his
cock began shooting wads of white semen up into the air, most of them splatting
on Amethea�s neck and face. He pulled his cock out of her cleavage and
furiously rubbed it with his right hand, shooting the remaining streams of his
seed against her tits.

�Slut!� he
hissed as the last drop of jism trickled out of his cocks piss-slit. He felt
his member softening as his lust was temporary satiated. 

He went for
another cup of wine, taking the sweet liquid in measured gulps as he watched
the moaning, silently weeping Amethea hanging in her chains. 

He found
her a most pleasurable sight, indeed. Arms chained wide apart above her head,
her lithe body arched back and her legs splayed out behind her, equally
supported by the chains. And this delicious harness relentlessly torturing her
breasts, which her hanging position in midair presented quite splendidly. The
leather-strap pulling her head back only added to her display of utter
vulnerability. 

His gaze
lingered on her purpled, bloated breasts as he stepped towards the lever at the
wall, operating the chains.

�Well,� he
said, holding his cup of wine in one hand as the other rested on the lever. 

�Those
udders of yours seem to be quite tough. And pleasurable to use, I would say. I
wonder how tough they really are.�

Without
further warning, he removed the safety hook on the levers cogwheel. The two
chains holding Amethea�s arms suddenly had leeway and with a barrage of
clanking sounds her upper body fell to the ground.

Since her
arms were still stretched up high in the air and the chains holding her legs up
were still under full strain�the only part of her body that took the full brunt
of her impact on the ground were her breasts.

With a
sickening sound they thumbed into the floor and were crushed under her upper
body slamming down. Amethea�s eyes snapped wide open and she screamed at the
top of her lungs, a long wailing cry of unbelievable torment that drained her
of air. She inhaled and continued screaming, the pain in her breasts so utterly
terrible she thought she could never in her life stop screaming again.

Arrakur
laughed heartily, belly shaking with devilish mirth. He had given the chains
just enough leeway so Amethea would fall to the ground, but not enough to
actually lower her arms. He watched her pulling mindlessly at the chains in
order to liberate her swatted breasts underneath her.

Arrakur
watched for a moment, sipping the rest of his wine. Then he turned the lever at
the wall, pulling Amethea�s upper body back up into the air. The woman was
weeping and sobbing madly in pain and despair. Astoundingly enough, her breasts
were still intact, yet their colour had changed from purple to deep blue.

The tyrant
had not been certain that her strained, bloated globes could take that impact
without bursting open like a pair of ripe melons. True, such damage would have
greatly disfigured his torture-toy at a far to early time. But giving in to a
whim, he had risked it and had been rewarded with a splendid display of
suffering. Still he felt some relief that her breasts had endured it and that
they were still available for numerous tortures once they would have somewhat recovered.

He stepped
in front of her looking down into her upturned, tear-streaked face. Almost
tenderly he rubbed his flaccid cock against her throbbing, aching tit-globes,
making her burst out in fresh tears. Gut-wrenching sobs of pain shook her, yet
Amethea did not plea for mercy.

Arrakur
felt his cock coming back to life again, stimulated by her pain and the sweet
feeling of her hot breast-flesh on his member.

He stepped
back, returning to the levers at the wall and loosening the chains on Amethea�s
ankles. Her legs fell to the ground, powerlessly. He then loosened the other
chains as well. Following a whim, he lowered her torso slowly to the ground,
giving her a chance to laboriously turning her body with the last of her
strength as she descended. She came to lie on her back, mercifully avoiding her
breasts to be crushed underneath her this time. 

She lay
there, panting, once raising one of her arms to grab the leather strap going
from her collar to the two rings still compressing the bases of her tits. Yet
her feeble attempt to rid herself of the devilish, torturous harness was
thwarted by her exhaustion. Her sapless arm fell back to the ground at her
side.

Arrakur
went to her, looking down at the sweat-covered body of his victim. He bent down
and released her iron cuffs on her ankles and wrists from the chains. He then
grabbed her wrists and pulled her slack body across the room towards a wooden
bench. Amethea grunted with pain, as the pulling of her arms put new strain on
her breast-bonds. But she was too weak to fight against her tormentor. Even if
every instinct in her yelled for her to get on her feet and kill this male
animal, she could not muster the strength. Like a life-sized puppet, Arrakur
pulled her up in the air and laid her on the bench.

It was half
a meter wide and just long enough to support Amethea�s torso and head. Her arms
and legs splayed over the sides of the bench. It�s upper end was slanted
upwards, prying Amethea�s head up, uncomfortably. Arrakur had to hold her in
order to prevent her body from slide off the side of the bench. He solved this
quickly by using two wide leather straps set into the bench�s surface. One was
fastened over her belly, pulled viscously tight and then closed. The other one
went around her throat, fixing her head to the bevel at the upper end. He then
pulled her left arm out and towards a pole at the side of the bench. The pole�s
tip was at the exact same height as the surface of the bench and a thick,
leathery cuff was attached to it. 

Arrakur
closed the cuff around Amethea�s wrist, tightly. Even in her dazed, weakened
state her warrior instincts compelled her to assert her situation. She couldn�t
turn her head, yet by rolling her eyes she could see the pole on which her left
arm was tied to. She felt Arrakur tugging at her right arm and gazed in that
direction, seeing him fastening her right wrist to an identical pole on that
side. 

Her arms
were now splayed out to either side of her torso, the strain in their joints a
mild discomfort compared to the painful tugging at her compressed tits.

She then
saw two additional poles embedded in the ground, less then one meter away from
their counterparts. Even if she had been in the position to struggle against
her captor, it would have been to late, as she realized what was to come.

Arrakur
held her right leg in a steel-like grip and pulled it up in the air. He then
twisted it in its socket and forced it down again. Amethea grunted in pain, as
her ankle was cuffed to the pole at the side of the bench. She feebly tried to
kick at him, as he seized her right leg and mercilessly repeated the act. 

He forced
her right leg down and bound it to the last remaining pole. Having finished, he
stepped back and admired his work.

Amethea
body was quite effectively immobilized�and in quite a painful way. 

Her arms
were drawn out to either side of her body, leaving no slack whatsoever.� The thick, heavy straps around her throat and
belly pinned her body down on the bench. Yet the worst was the position of her
legs. They too were pulled out to either side of her body, perfectly
paralleling her arms. In fact, her legs were spread as wide apart as humanly
possible. 

The lower
part of her body was literally forced into an upended T-shape, the strain
sending relentless waves of ache into her groin. 

Since
Amethea was forced to face front and could not lower her head, she gazed down
between her grotesquely bloated breasts along the smooth surface of her belly -
dented inwards by the strap - and at her impossibly wide-spread legs and the
trimmed mat of her fair, curled pubic hair crowning between them.

She felt
the anxiety rise inside her belly, as Arrakur stepped in front of her view,
standing naked between her legs. She was totally immobilized and her crotch was
wide open for everything and anything that monster could think off to do to
her.

She had
found herself in that same-self kind of bondage merely a day before. Obviously
the master shared his piggish servant�s taste in restraining a woman. 

She sobbed
in horror, as she doubted that Arrakur was any less inventive in the ways of
inflicting pain on her exposed womanhood. She even caught herself hoping for
rape. 

Just
rape�.please Gods!
She prayed inside her mind. Make him just rape me! It can not be too much to
ask. Please don�t let him torture me there! Just rape. He will rape me and then
he�ll be finally satiated and tired and send me back to my cell. Grant me this,
I beg off you!

She saw him
step closer, his cock once again hard as a rock and pointing straight in the
air. 

He smiled
at her wickedly, holding a pair of pincers in his hand. 

If the gods
had heard Amethea�s plea, they were either indifferent to it or as wicked and
mean as her tormentor.

The pincers
were differed from the common version, though. It�s tips were not sharp but
flat. He clicked them together, playfully. Then he lowered them towards her
unprotected pussy.

Amethea
watched in horror and tried to steel herself against the pain to come. Although
the tongs would not be able to cut into her flesh, the pincers could most
certainly be used to rip out her labial lips. 

Instinctively
she pulled at the bindings holding her body down and her legs spread wide open.
It was in vain, of course.

The pliers
were right on top of her cunt, then they closed around one�just one of her
tangled pubic hairs. Arrakur began to pull. Slowly building up the strain,
drawing the hair tighter and tighter until it finally tore loose. The pain was
mild compared to everything she had suffered before and Amethea felt strangely
elevated, that she even for a second forgot her outrage bubbling up inside her
at the act. 

The pincers
descended again, seizing another single hair of her pubes. Again it was
tautened more and more, the pain mounting slowly until it too was torn out of
her skin. She winced as he did it again. And again. And again.

Each time,
he seized one; only one of her curled pubic hairs and pulled at it with
maddening patience until it finally tore loose. He seemed to have infinite
patience with this procedure. For Amethea, it became increasingly painful. With
each new hair being pulled out, the aching mounted. Her groin slowly began to
flare up in pain. 

At the time
when Arrakur had pulled out some forty or fifty of her pubes, she was sobbing
and cursing. He kept on pulling out her pussy-hair ever so slowly, smiling down
at her.

Her crotch
ached horribly, yet when she looked at her pussy she could not make out any
difference. He must have pulled out nearly seventy of her hair and there still
remained an encouragingly uncountable number of hairs to plug out.

She closed
her eyes in misery, then snapped them open as a fresh surge of pain exploded in
her cunt. 

The pliers
had closed around her left labia and now were crushing the tender fold of
female flesh between their teeth.

�It�s high
time for this rebel-cunt of yours to learn it�s place, slut!� Arrakur purred
and twisted the pliers around, making his victim scream in pain yet again.

He let go
of her nether lip, only to crush the other labia between the plier�s tips, the
metal threatening to crush the delicate outer flesh of her sex to dust.

All the
woman could do was to scream and endure the attack, watching the cruel pliers
being applied to her wide-open genitals and doing it�s horrible work.

Arrakur
watched her face with his everlasting fascination for pain, observing the
changes in her facial expression as he reduced and increased the pressure of
the pliers on her labial lip.

Reducing
caused her tautened, pained face to relax ever so slightly. Increasing the
tension made her draw back the corners of her mouth, made her close her eyes,
thus pressing fresh tears out. Twisting the pliers made her scream and drove
her into a fit of gut-wrenching sobs.

After a few
moments, he became tired of this play and put the thongs away. In addition, he
decided that he had waited for this moment, the moment he had longed for since
he first had visited this slut in her cell merely a day ago, long enough.

The moment,
when he aimed his rock-hard cock against her pain-throbbing slit, being splayed
out defencelessly in front of him. The moment when the tip of his spear made
contact with the tortured lips of her cunt, pushing them aside and forcing
entrance into her body. The moment when his male flesh drove into her silky
tunnel, its soft walls engulfing his unwanted presence inside her womb. 

He felt his
entire inner being sizzling with pleasure, as he forced the entire length of
his cock inside her, grinding his hips against her wide-open crotch. Looking
down at her with the outmost satisfaction he began to fuck her with slow, calm
strokes, feeling�victorious. 

Amethea lay
there beneath her rapist and felt his large, hard cock moving back and forth
inside her belly, feeling her cunt-tube enclosing the invading male flesh. 

Each thrust
into her belly made her groan involuntarily. She could not prevent those, as
much as she wished for it.

There were
no words that could adequately describe the surge of loath and disgust she felt
each time his cock was inside her in it�s fullness and his tip reached as far
inside her as possible. Yet in the back of her mind, there was a sparkle of
relief. The sickening, yet perversely soothing thought that being raped meant
for her a short reprieve from more torture applied to her helplessly exposed
sex.

It was a
shaming thing to think of for her, to even consider rape being less horrible
than torture. 

Yet she
couldn�t help herself wishing the rape to continue for a while. Not in the
least for her own lust, which this violation did not supply her with in the
slightest. Just so that her torturer was occupied with her body in a mildly
less painful way for her.

Arrakur
kept fucking her for a while, savouring the terrific pleasure of the act in
full. He looked down at her with the contempt of the victor over a beaten
enemy, while he kept moving his cock back and forth inside her. He felt
powerful, fucking her like this. 

And this
triggered once more the need in him to execute that power over her in the
fullest. 

He pulled
his cock way back, almost sliding out of her � the tip of his member just
filling the entrance to her cunt. Then he plunged his male hardness forward
with a horribly brutal thrust that made Amethea cry out in pain.

He did it
again. And again. Each time he pulled his cock just barely out of her then
slammed it back into her velvet tunnel with viscous cruelty, actually rocking
the bench with the force of his thrust. Each time Amethea yelped and screamed,
her bloated tits jiggling on her chest.

Unfortunately
for her, a movement that reawakened Arrakur�s interest in those tortured
mammaries. He kept his cock deeply embedded inside her cunt-shaft and started
to slap her tits again. He hit them hard with both his hands, slapping and
backhanding the two painfully flatulent breasts without restrain. As she
screamed and cursed him, the pain in her tits made her cunt-muscles tighten
around his cock, compulsory sucking and milking this flesh-made torture-tool
inside her belly. 

Arrakur
felt his balls tighten, felt his cock engorging even more as his pleasure
mounted. He fucked the screaming woman harder and harder as he slapped and
punched her tits.

He was
almost mad with dark lust, as his climax approached. His hands rained blows on
Amethea�s face and tits.

Then he
reached for the huge leather strap fixing Amethea�s neck to the head of the
bench. With a swift motion he tightened it even further and locked it. 

Amethea�s
mouth gaped open as the collar closed her throat and made it impossible for her
to breath.

His cock
kept ravaging her cunt but the strain in her lungs became more and more
prominent as she was deprived of oxygen. Her struggles made her cunt twitch and
spasm around Arrakur�s cock even more and he felt that for him the peak of
bliss had almost come. 

He grabbed
Amethea�s taut, pain-pulsing breasts with both hands and crushed them in his
fingers as far as they would go.

�Whore!
Slut! Rebel-bitch!� he cursed her as his cock began spurting the third load of
its jism into the writhing prisoner�s belly.

Amethea
couldn�t scream as the ever-present pain in her tortured breasts mounted yet
again, couldn�t hiss in contempt as her torturer�s semen desecrated her womb.
All she could do was struggling helplessly against the straps holding her in
place as she on top of it all suffered the slow, painful process of
suffocating.

Her bulging
eyes looked up at her rapist and torturer, already glazing over, as the pain in
her lungs became way beyond endurable and darkness crept into her mind.

The last
conscious thought she had, before she glided into the merciful shade of
unconsciousness was: 

Gods, I
beg you. Don�t let me wake up again! 

End it!

EnditEnditEnditEnditEnditEnditenditendite�it�.
