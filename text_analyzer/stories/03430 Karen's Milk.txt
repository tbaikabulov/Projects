Karen eyes struggled to open, her mind in a fog, her eyelids so heavy she
  kept drifting in an out of conciseness. She thought she was dreaming as she
  struggled to move. Slowly, as her mind began to clear her memory groggily returned.
  She remembered herself in the clinic when her labor pains began, then the pain,
  and bits and pieces of the delivery. Then it was nothing but darkness, until
  now. 
As she looked about, this was not the room she had went into labor in. This
  room was different, it didn't seem like part of the clinic, and she sensed
  something was wrong. Before she could sort it out, someone entered the room. 
�Hello Karen. I see your finally awake, how are you feeling?� 
Karen looked up at the older woman's face with a look of uncertainty as she
  studied her for a moment. She looked to be in her late forty's with slightly
  graying hair pulled tightly into a bun. A stern almost snobbish, professional
  look to her, but at least the white lab coat was reassuring as Karen concluded
  she was still in the clinic. 
Karen didn't answer, she felt sore and bruised. She felt so sleepy, her eyes
  struggling to stay open. �What's happening? Where am I? How is the baby? Is
  it a boy or a girl?� she asked with tears welling up in her eyes. 
�Oh, slow down, one question at a time dear. I'm sorry Karen, but you won't
  be seeing the baby, remember? That was all part of the adoption and so it really
  doesn't matter if it was a boy or a girl. But I will tell you that the baby
  is healthy and the new parents express their deepest gratitude to you.� 
Karen began to cry. 
The woman sat down on the edge of the chair and pulled her in her arms, her
  tightly brasseried breasts poking against the side of Karen's cheek. �There
  there, it will be alright, there will be other children in your future I guarantee
  it, you'll be fine, you just need some time.� 
Karen continued to sob before finally regaining some composure. �Where am
  I? Are we still in the clinic?� 
�No, this is not the Doctor Adams clinic, this is my clinic. Do you remember
  me? I interviewed you once in your Doctor Adams office. 
�I don't understand.� Karen asked totally confused. 
I am a close friend of Doctor Adams, my name is Catherine. Doctor Catherine
  actually, but for now I think it best if you just call me Catherine.� 
�Why am I here?� 
�You see Karen you have been chosen by Doctor Adams and my colleagues for
  a rather unique project. That is why we have been preparing you for the last,
  oh, eight months or so.� 
Karen was only more confused now. �What do you mean preparing me? Preparing
  for what? I thought the adoptive parents took my baby, what more could you
  possible want for me?� 
�Karen the adoptive parents do have your baby now. But you see our interests
  were never in the baby, but in you and the changes in your body that the baby
  has caused.� 
�I don't understand.� Karen seemed puzzled. 
�Karen, you have been chosen for an experimental research program called Intensive
  Lactation Thearapy, or ILT. It is a program of designed experiments aimed at
  expanding the lactation capabilities of the human female.� 
�What are you talking about? I don't know what you mean, I just gave up my
  baby and I don't have any ah.� Karen stopped mid sentence and thought for a
  moment, and a chill ran through her. �Lactation, you mean like milk? Wait I
  never agreed to this. I want out of here right now.� 
Catherine held Karen again. �It's alright. I know this all is a little frightening,
  but I assure you, you'll be just fine.� 
Karen pushed Catherine away and tried to stand only to find her ankles were
  cuffed and fastened to the chair. �What's going on what have you done to me?
  Let me go.� 
�Calm down, this is just temporary, just relax, I'm only doing what is best
  for you. You're in no condition to go anywhere for a while dear.� Catherine
  reassured her. 
But Karen's anger continued. �Let me go, I'm leaving, I don't know what kind
  of sick ideas you may have but I'm not going to be a part of it.� 
Catherine gripped Karen tighter, pushing her back down, her ankles already
  tied, she put up little resistance in her weakened state. Before Karen even
  realized it Catherine had slipped her right wrist in a cuff similar to the
  ankle restraint and was now wrestling her left wrist into the opposite cuff
  as well. She quickly had Karen on her back fastened securely. 
Karen weakly struggled against her bonds. 
Catherine sat quietly till Karen realized it was useless and began to calm
  down. �Karen I don't think you fully understand, I can be your friend, or I
  can be your worst enemy.� 
Karen started to sob, �Why, why are you doing this�. 
�Sh, sh, let me explain.� Catherine continued. �The vitamins that Doctor Adams
  prescribed to you, you know the ones that you have been taking for the last
  seven months. They were more than just ordinary vitamins. They contained a
  mixture of hormones which have caused your body to believe that you were carrying
  more than the one baby. The reason being, in our previous research we found
  that women with multiple births such as twins or triplets have a natural elevation
  in certain hormones which act specifically on their breasts causing them to
  redevelop internally. Those changes allow them to generate the nourishment
  that the multiple babies will need when born. We studied this for quite some
  time and a few years ago we were able to develop these hormones artificially.� 
�You have been on a steady dose of these for the last seven months. Your body
  currently believes that you were carrying quadruplets, if our calculations
  are correct. It's been happening inside you and other than maybe some breast
  tenderness, I'm sure you haven't even been aware of it,� she gently rubbed
  Karen's shoulders. 
Karen could only stare blankly at the horror of what she was hearing, her
  eyes continuing to tear. 
In a few moments Catherine continued, �Now as you may know, it is not that
  uncommon for a woman to be nursing three or even four newborns, what with this
  age of fertility drugs and such, so the earlier development, although important,
  did not proved the extreme results we had hoped for, so we continued our research.
  We developed a new product based partially on the BGH hormone farmers have
  been giving dairy cows since the nineties. BGH acts on the cow's pituitary
  gland, specifically to increase the level of another hormone called prolactin.
  It was thought back then that it was the prolactin level in the female mammal
  which determined milk production, but we now know that it is much more complex
  than that. We found that it is really the milk producing cells or lactocytes
  that produce milk and that the prolactin level in the blood merely reacted
  with them to complete the synthesis cycle. Our new product increases prolactin
  but it is also aimed more specifically at these lactocyte cells. It is all
  very complex and I'm sure we will all learn more as we go. Your body and breast
  structure were carefully studied and we believe you are the perfect candidate
  for our tests, that is why you were selected. For the next few months we will
  be aggressively working at expanding the amount of milk that your body is capable
  of producing. All we need now is to start you on the medication and give you
  the right stimulation. You can think of yourself as somewhat of a pioneer if
  you will dear. If all goes as planned we will all go down in the journals of
  modern medicine.� 
�I won't do it. I won't be your guinea pig; you're out of your mind if you
  think you can get away with this.� Karen screamed. 
Catherine just smiled. �Right now you may be saying no, but I think your body
  may soon change your mind. You see, it's out of your or even my control, it's
  the hormones that are in charge now. Oh, and if you recall the paperwork you
  signed in our interview at the beginning of your pregnancy you would remember
  that you also signed a Medical Consent for Research form which in effect means,
  you volunteered for this program. I apologize if it was somewhat misleading,
  but even so it is still a legally binding contract and we have it all on video
  in case you would like to refresh you memory. So, now let's stop this foolishness
  and I'll get your first dose of medicine.� 
She returned with a glass, but Karen refused and turned her head as Catherine
  tried to feed it to her. 
�As you wish dear,� Catherine turned and left the room, but Karen's victory
  was short lived as she was back in a few moments, this time with an IV bag
  on a rolling stand. 
Karen felt panicky. 
�Karen, as I told you before. We are going to continue one way or another.
  Your only choice is if it is with your cooperation or not.� As Catherine brought
  the IV needle into view she began to gently swab Karen's arm with alcohol.
  She warned Karen. �Hold still or the needle might cause serious damage.� 
Karen felt defeated and began to sob as the needle pierced her skin and found
  its way into the vein. 
Catherine finished attaching the IV and then adjusted the bag to a steady
  drip. She then sat down on the bed next to Karen, opening Karen's gown and
  with her thumb and forefingers, started gently caressing her nipples. 
Karen blushed with embarrassment at the intimate contact. 
�You'll get over your modesty quickly as you'll soon become quite accustomed
  to having your breasts massaged and you'll see, it won't be all that bad,� then
  she increased the pressure. �Now when you decide to take the medication orally,
  I will disconnect the IV, but it is crucial that we start it now and we must
  also increase your intake of fluids to keep you from dehydrating, as most of
  the fluids in your body will soon be redirected, if you know what I mean.� Catherine
  continued her work on Karen's nipples, now squeezing and pulling them almost
  to the point of pain. She continued this for a few more minutes before releasing
  the now tingling buds. �There, that should be enough for now,� she said. 
Karen was angry and flushed. �I won't let you do this to me.� She exclaimed. 
Catherine brushed Karen's cheek with her hand. �Will just have to wait and
  see dear. Now get some rest and if you need me for anything just push this
  call button.� She placed a corded remote in Karen's left hand. �I think you
  need to get some rest and I promise I'll leave you alone unless you call.� She
  turned and left Karen alone in the room. 
Karen did feel tired, exhausted was more like it. As she lay there helpless
  she thought back to early in her pregnancy and her first visit to the clinic
  and was first introduced to Doctor Adams. She remembered how thorough he was
  with his examination, especially with her breasts and then she did recall a
  little of the interview that Catherine spoke of, but she thought that this
  woman was just like a social worker for the adoption and stuff. Now the more
  she thought about it she also remembered how after the first month or so her
  breasts had started aching, right after she had began to take those vitamins.
  When she had complained to the Doctor on subsequent visits, he seemed pleased
  and told her it was perfectly normal and not to worry even though her breasts
  at times became so tender. Thinking of her breasts they were never something
  she was proud of as she was growing up. Although they were normal sized what
  bothered her was that they weren't as firm as most girls her age. They were
  soft and loose and she could never go without a bra as it was very noticeable
  at least in her mind. But during her pregnancy they had firmed and had grown
  from a comfortable 34B to a solid 36D and were even starting to show little
  stress lines on the surface of the skin at the sides. Her areola had grown
  too and was now dark and wide and her nipples had enlarged noticeably. �Why
  had had these people done this to her?� she asked herself. Was it because she
  was single and listed no family or friends when she had checked into the clinic?
  She began to realize that running away from her parents and telling no one
  about her pregnancy may have been a big mistake. She lay there sobbing with
  all these things going through her mind, but eventually exhaustion finally
  overtook her. She drifted off to sleep, a sleep so deep she was not even aware
  as Catherine changed the IV bag several times throughout the evening. 
When Karen finally woke she was frightened. She had been dreaming that she
  could feel pains shooting through her breasts. Now awake, she gathered her
  thoughts and realized the pains were not just in her dreams. She could clearly
  feel real pain and they felt warm and hard as she began to remember why she
  was here. She quickly remembered the button and pushed it. 
In a few moments Catherine appeared and Karen told her about the pain in her
  breasts. Catherine kissed her on the cheek, �That's and excellent sign Karen,
  you are doing great. Let me get something that should help with the pain, I'll
  be right back�. When she returned she brought two steaming hot towels with
  her. �Here dear I know you're breasts are beginning to hurt and this should
  help ease some of the pain.� She placed the towels directly over Karen's breasts.
  They were quite warm though not too hot and the heat did indeed feel good as
  she felt the pain slowly began to subside. Before the towels fully cooled,
  Catherine again left the room this time returning with an electric heating
  pad. Removing the still warm towels, Karen's nipples rose immediately as the
  cool air hit them. Catherine reached over taking them both between her fingers
  as before and began to massage them, pinching slightly and gently pulling them
  away from her chest. Karen could not see, but Catherine quickly noticed that
  both nipples immediately sprouted little drops of milk and she eased up on
  the pressure now just rubbing the erect nubs wanting to stimulate but not wanting
  any milk to be released at this point. �Here I brought you this heating pad.
  This should help with your discomfort.� She said as she laid the pad across
  Karen's chest. �Now why don't you try to get some more rest, your body needs
  it. You can call me again if there's anything else.� Catherine left the room
  smiling inwardly to herself. She knew exactly what the heat would do to Karen's
  developing breasts. She knew that the heat would expand the lactose cells and
  make the milk ducts dilate, relieving the pressure temporarily and more importantly
  letting them refill even further with the milk she was beginning to produce. 
She went into the adjoining room to wait and she began to prepare the equipment
  that she knew would soon be necessary. 
Karen could feel the warmth affecting her breasts and it indeed relieved some
  of the pressure she had felt earlier. She lay still, as the warmth continued
  to spread and soon allowed her to drift back to sleep. 
Barely two hours had passed when Catherine heard the call button sound. She
  knew that Karen would be in severe pain by now, but she did not rush to answer
  the call. 
Karen again had the recurring dream about the pain in her chest, which became
  so pronounced that it had woken her. Just as before, it was no dream. It felt
  like her breasts were on fire, and she guessed that the heating pad may have
  short-circuited or something. The fire felt so deep within her as she pressed
  the button a second time. 
Catherine smiled as the call went off the second time. She knew exactly what
  was happening. 
Karen saw the door opening and called to Catherine. �Please, the heating pad,
  I think something is wrong, hurry, its burning.� 
Catherine was quickly to Karen's side and immediately removed the electric
  device and examined it. It was not hot, just comfortably warm, as she quickly
  calmed Karen. �Here see, it's not hot,� holding the heating pad to Karen's
  cheek. 
Karen couldn't believe it. She was so sure that it had been causing the heat
  she felt. Yet now even with the pad removed her breasts still felt like they
  were on fire. 
Catherine laid the pad aside and felt Karen's breasts with her hands. 
Karen instantly became aware of the pressure within them. She realized what
  was happening and she began to cry. 
Catherine comforted her by gently kissing her cheeks with one hand wiping
  the tears as the rolled down the side of her face. With her other hand she
  continued to stroke Karen's nipples, alternating between left and right, assuring
  that the both stayed erect. 
Karen's sobbing continued as the nipple stimulation only increased the pressure
  she felt within her breasts. �Please don't do this to me. Please, just let
  me go.� 
Catherine was deaf to her pleading. �It will only get worse if you're not
  milked soon Karen. Even if we stopped now, it would take a week, maybe two,
  or maybe even a month or more before your body would change and stop making
  milk.� 
Then for the first time, with tears streaming down her cheeks, she realized
  that Catherine was right. She knew that at least for now she would have to
  give into this woman. �Please I can't take anymore. Please make the pain go
  away. Please I'll do what you want, just make it stop, please.� 
Catherine kissed her again, this time on the lips, and then whispered to her, �First
  you must agree to my terms, only if you agree to obey and cooperate with me
  without question will I make the pain go away.� 
The way it was phrased scared her, but the aching that seemed to be ever increasing
  left her no other choice. �Yes, Yes, I promise, just make it go away.� 
Catherine removed the IV from her arm and released the straps holding her
  arms and legs. Karen's hands went instinctively to her breasts. They were rock
  hard and painfully swollen; just her touching them brought a gasp to her lips. 
Catherine pulled Karen's hands from her breasts. �Remember you are to do everything
  I say without question. Is that understood?� 
Karen nodded her head. 
�Then we will start with rule number one, you are not to touch your breasts,
  unless you are instructed otherwise. If I do see you touching them without
  permission, I will bind your hands to your waist. Do you understand?� 
Karen thought for a minute not wanting to answer. 
�Do you understand?� Catherine gripped her by the chin and turned it to face
  her. 
Karen felt defeated. �Yes,� she whispered. 
�Yes what? I didn't hear you.� 
�Yes Maam, I understand.� 
�Good, there will be more rules as we progress, but if you do as I say it
  will be much easier for you, you'll see.� She kissed Karen on the cheek. �Good
  girl, I think you are going to be a quick learner. Now come, we must go into
  the next room.� She helped her up. As her breasts shifted with her movement,
  the pain cursed through them again and it was all she could do not to reach
  up instinctively to support them. Catherine helped her onto her feet and with
  Karen's arm around her for support assisted her through the door and into the
  next room. 
Inside Karen saw a table much like you would find in an hospital operating
  room. She was apprehensive as she was led to it. It was different than anything
  she had seen before. It was padded in black leather and had two large holes
  cut side by side into it, about a foot and a half from the end of the table.
  It then became obvious to Karen that if she lay on her stomach that the cutouts
  were meant for her breasts. She reluctantly climbed on the table and with assistance,
  lay face down as instructed by Catherine. At this point she was not going to
  offer any resistance, as she wanted desperately for the pain in her chest to
  be relieved. Once in position her ankles and wrists were again secured with
  straps and a thick belt was brought across her back and tightened, forcing
  her belly flat against the table, her breasts hanging freely through the openings.
  She began to sob slightly at her helpless situation. 
Catherine comforted her with her reassurance. �It won't be much longer now
  you'll see just a few more preparations and when its all through you'll feel
  much better, but first I think it will help to explain what is about to happen.� 
She reached into a cabinet and brought out what looked like a large cup with
  numerous hoses running to it. �In a minute, I am going to attach one of these
  to each of your breasts. A suction will be applied which will then hold the
  cup in place. Now in the center of the cup,� she pointed to a smaller rubber
  sleeve attached to two separate hoses inside the cup. �This will encase your
  nipple and areola. It will help stimulate the area by creating a pulsing suction
  that will gently massage and squeeze your areola. Then finally the inside of
  the sleeve, which will be gripping your nipple, is what will actually draw
  the milk from you. Then through this hose, it will flow into a special container
  where it will be measured and stored. But before we get to that part there
  are still some things that need to be done, so let us begin.� Catherine pressed
  a button and the table began to rise. She then uncovered the rest of the equipment
  beside the table and began to attach the cups and hoses to the machine. She
  massaged both of her nipples until they became fully erect. Next, she placed
  the center sleeve from within the cup over the extended nipple and flipped
  a switch on the machine. The nipple was slowly drawn down into the sleeve by
  the suction, until it could stretch no further. Then Catherine pressed a second
  switch and the rubber ring at the end of the sleeve began constricting and
  locking her nipple within the sleeve. She reached into a jar of lotion and
  applied a generous amount of it to both of Karen's breasts and worked it around
  until they were well covered and then placed the outside cup into position.
  With the activation of another switch the cup firmly seated its rubber seal
  against her chest wall and began to pull her breast into the cup. When she
  had completed the task with both breasts she moved back and lowered the table. 
Catherine moved a video monitor to Karen's side and turned it on. When the
  screen came to life, Karen had a direct view of her breasts from underneath
  the table. It looked like something from a science fiction movie as she could
  see her breasts attached to the cups with wires and hoses running everywhere. 
Karen's pulse began to quicken from both anticipation and fear of what would
  be coming next. 
Catherine slid a chair up to the table so she was just inches from Karen's
  face. 
She held a remote control in her hand and with the push of a button Karen
  felt the suction in the cup increase. Within seconds her breast began to swell
  trying to expand itself into the cup. The pain she suffered before began to
  diminish slightly. The suction began to pulse going stronger than weaker than
  stronger again and the massaging effect actually began to feel good to her. 
�Does that feel a little better dear?� Catherine asked, gently stroking the
  side of Karen's cheek with her free hand. 
Karen nodded as Catherine continued. �What is happening now is that the milk
  ducts or alveoli as they are called are expanding from the suction and allowing
  the pressure from your milk to decrease just like they did with the warm towels
  before. We want to expand them as much as possible at these first milking's
  as changes in your body will take place much easier early in the program when
  its still trying to adjust to its new role. As we continue in the next few
  weeks you will see your breasts increase in size. In fact, I think as you watch
  today you will see your breasts increase by maybe even a couple cup sizes before
  were through. We are uncertain how large they may eventually grow as the weeks
  progress, but I think it safe to say you will never worry about being small
  again.� 
Karen looked over at the monitor and she could see her breasts through the
  clear plastic cups. They were bright pink and looked larger than they had ever
  been in her life. She watched in amazement and could feel them as they pulsed
  with the alternating suction. The painful pressure inside them that had decreased
  before was slowly starting to return. 
�Ohh, god my breasts are starting to hurt again, you promised that you would
  make them feel better.� 
�Yes dear I did, but remember what I just said. I'm afraid you are going to
  have to bear through some pain as we expand your vessels. It is going to be
  a feeling that will become all too familiar in the next few weeks if our tests
  are to be successful.� 
�Now the rubber sleeves inside the cups around your nipples are squeezing
  them just tight enough so that no milk can escape. Right now that is very important
  because as your external breast tissue has been expanding in the cups form
  the suction, your milk ducts have also been swelling, increasing their capacity
  to store milk which gave you the temporary feeling of relief before, that also
  relieves the pressure on the lactocyte cells we talked about earlier allowing
  them to synthesis more milk and the process continues on. If we are to be successful
  with our experiments then we have to keep the pressure on the lactocyte cells
  to a minimum in order for them to be able to produce at their maximum. This
  is a normal and an anticipated part of the process. I am afraid that we must
  continue and wait until you are fully engorged before you will get the relief
  that I promised.� 
Karen was confused as she looked back at the monitor and watched as her breasts
  grew even larger now and they turned from bright pink to red. The heat began
  to increase with the pressure she was feeling and she didn't think she could
  stand it even a few more minutes. �Please,� she pleaded. 
Catherine continued to stroke Karen's cheek. �It's alright, but as painful
  as it is, we must do this now, you will realize this in the next few weeks.� She
  dialed the remote to the next setting and Karen could instantly feel the difference.
  Her breasts were pulled even further into the cups and as the external tissue
  stretched the pressure within her breast eased up slightly. She sighed a bit
  of relief but it was short-lived, as within minutes the pains begin to reappear.
  In the next ten minutes the pain was even more intense than before and the
  monitor showed her breasts had changed to an angry dark red within the clear
  cups. She closed her eyes and sobbed trying to put it out of her mind, but
  could think of nothing but her breasts and they pain they were causing her.
  This continued on for the next twenty minutes as her breasts turned from red
  to blue, and eventually to purple. Catherine knew this was enough for the first
  session and was inwardly pleased at the results. She turned down the suction
  slightly and left the room for a moment. 
When she returned, she was carrying a large glass of milky fluid. She sat
  back down next to Karen and brushed her cheek. She moved in close to her now
  and she held the glass in her hand. �Karen, listen to me. I want you to drink
  this. It contains lots of essential fluids to keep you healthy, but I am not
  going to lie to you, it also contains the drugs that we talked about earlier.
  When you drink it, it is going to cause you to produce more milk. More milk
  than is even in your breasts right now. I don't want any misunderstanding,
  I want you to be fully aware of what this means and in full cooperation. 
Karen's tears continued. Although she feared what this might mean, she knew
  she had no choice. There was no escape from this. She knew right now she needed
  to do whatever it took to relieve the aching in her breasts. She shook her
  head up and down as a signal. �Yes, I understand�, she moaned, then, her mouth
  reached for the straw and as she continued to sob, she drank it all. Catherine
  kissed her again and then toggled yet another switch on the remote. 
In seconds the vacuum in the cups around her breasts increased to their maximum
  trying to swell them even further. Karen could see them in the monitor as they
  filled the cups completely. Catherine pushed another button and the sleeve
  attached to her nipple came to life. It pulled her nipple deep into the recess
  and began to pulse simulating a babies suckling. She groaned in pain now as
  her breasts sought desperately to release, but yet no milk was being allowed
  to escape, as her nipples were still being tightly pinched at their base by
  the secondary sleeve. She winced in pain, �Ahhhhh, Ahh, Ah, Please�. Then Catherine
  pushed the last switch and with a faint hiss the constricting sleeve released.
  Instantly milk rushed out and began to trickle down the sleeve into the hose. 
Karen watched as the clear hose showed light streams of the bluish white fluid
  and instantly she felt some relief in her still purple tinted tits. As the
  sucking of the machine continued, Catherine continued stroking Karen's cheek
  with her hand. �You see I told you I would give your relief. I am very proud
  of you. You have made a lot of progress in just a short time. Now just relax
  and enjoy the feeling.� 
Karen did just exactly that. Her eyes closed and a warm feeling came over
  her. Just as she was lulled into a comforting trance, a sudden reheating filled
  her breasts. It started from deep within her and began to spread through out
  her breast not overly hot, more like a pleasant warmth flowed throughout each
  breast and she could feel it moving toward the nipples. It was a strange but
  very pleasing sensation and suddenly she could hear a difference in the machine
  that was milking her. When she opened her eyes and looked at the monitor she
  could see the reason. The tubes connected to her nipples were completely filled
  with milk. It was like a dam had suddenly opened within her. She sighed and
  closed her eyes again as waves of these new sensations ran through her. It
  was the most pleasure she'd had felt in months. She lay there relaxed and let
  the machine do the work, hoping the feeling would never end. 
It was quite awhile before Karen came down from her high. Now as the machine
  continued to pulse, the warm feeling in her was beginning to subside. She looked
  back at the monitor and could see that the tubes were no longer full, but there
  was still plenty of milk running through them. She looked up into Catherine's
  eyes with a warm and peaceful smile. 
�The feeling you felt earlier is the called the let down.� Catherine replied. �That
  is when your breasts fully relax, allowing the milk to rush out towards the
  nipple, hence they, �let down� the milk. That is when you release the greatest
  amount of milk. Some women swear that it feels like an actual orgasm. I could
  see it in your face when it happened.� 
�It was like nothing I've ever felt before. I felt like I was floating away,
  it was so peaceful.� Karen sighed. She relaxed and closed her eyes again and
  a few minutes later actually drifted into an almost hypnotic trance, concentrating
  only on the pleasant feeling within her. 
When she snapped back, the machine was still running and Karen realized that
  her nipples were starting to get sore. �Please Maam; can we stop the machine
  now?� 
�No quite yet dear, you still have milk coming out and even when it stops
  we will continue for another ten minutes or so to make sure you are completely
  drained. We want to make your breasts aware that you have run out of milk.
  That is the way they work. It's called supply and demand. If we create the
  demand, then they will increase their supply. That is as basic as it can be.� 
By the time they were finished Karen's breasts were not only drained, but
  sore. As Catherine stopped the machine she released the cups and Karen's breasts
  were released. 
Karen looked at the monitor as this was happening and was shocked by what
  she saw. When her breasts emerged they still looked full. Her nipples were
  as thick as her thumb and hugely elongated. Catherine began to rub them pulling
  and rolling on the nipples. It felt good to Karen as it stimulated the blood
  flow back to them. 
�I can see were going to have to go up a cup size tomorrow and I think we'll
  need the next size nipple sleeve also. You are doing wonderfully dear.� She
  again offered Karen something to drink, which she readily accepted. �Now try
  and get some sleep, it's only two hours before the next milking, unless you
  feel you need it sooner. 
Karen couldn't imagine asking to be milked again. In fact she would do anything
  she could think of to keep it from ever happening again. She felt fine even
  though her position was starting to get a little uncomfortable. But she was
  still so tired that it didn't take long for her to drift off to sleep again. 
As she slept, nature continued its course. Her body began immediately trying
  to replenish the milk. The two hours passed quickly when she was awakened by
  Catherine. Just as before Catherine was carrying another large glass of the
  medicine. Even though Karen knew that it contained more hormones, she was thirsty
  and she accepted it graciously. 
Catherine smiled and kissed her on the cheek. �You're learning very quickly
  dear.� 
It was not at all unpleasant and she was indeed thirsty as she finished the
  whole glass. 
�Dear for the rest of today and tonight we will not be using the full procedure
  like before. That will be done only once a day. Normally it will be the first
  milking in the morning. Now what is important is that your milk be extracted
  regularly and completely to increase its production. We will use just the simple
  milking sleeve without the breast cups for that. After this milking you will
  be allowed to walk about and get some exercise and maybe something to eat if
  you like. Just remember to keep up your fluid intake up or dehydration is definitely
  a possibility in your condition.� 
Catherine sat down and placed her hands under the table and started to massage
  and squeeze Karen's nipples. Within minutes they became swollen and erect and
  she attached the tubes and milking sleeves to them. She pressed the operation
  button on the machine and the sleeves began to contract and suck at her nipples.
  Though Karen breasts had not been that full and she had been in no pain, the
  sucking felt good and within a few seconds' milk began to fill the tubes. After
  about five minutes of this Karen closed her eyes and sighed as her let down
  reflex again swept through her. Within twenty minutes her breasts were empty
  but were continued to be milked as before. Then the machine was turned off
  and she was released. The milking had been quite pleasant this time and Karen's
  fears began to ease, at least for now. 
As promised Karen was released from the table and allowed to stand. Her legs
  ached and she was still quite sore. It had still been less than twenty four
  hours since she had given birth. She was given a cotton smock to wear that
  covered her breasts and waist and she was led into what was to become her room
  for the next few months. It was furnished with bed, couch, lounge chair, television,
  even a refrigerator and microwave, and accept from the fact of a large covered
  object in the corner, it looked just like any normal apartment. She was offered
  food and beverage which she eagerly accepted and told she could lounge for
  the rest of the afternoon and evening. If it had not been for the two hour
  milkings she could not have asked for better treatment. She had remembered
  her instructions and had not touched her breasts even though sometimes they
  tingled and itched. 
That night Catherine applied lotion to her breasts just like before. It was
  later when Karen was ready for bed that she discovered that her bed wasn't
  quite normal either. Although one half of the queen size bad was flat, the
  other side there were the familiar cutouts in the mattress just like the table
  in the other room. She slid into bed on the normal side and she slept quite
  well even with the milking interruptions. It was towards early morning when
  she awoke with the tingling in her breasts when she unconsciously violated
  rule number one. 
When Catherine entered Karen's hands were on her breasts. She quickly ordered
  her to stand and Catherine opened a drawer and proceeded to remove a belt which
  was soon strapped around her waist. Leather cuffs were then placed around her
  wrists were then attached, preventing any further contact. She was then led
  back into the first treatment room and helped to lay face down, back on the
  table with her breasts hanging freely beneath her. She again feared this woman
  and what was being done to her but still had her wits about her and asked for
  her medicine fearing any further infractions. Catherine smiled and kissed her
  cheek and although she had planned on punishing Karen further for the infraction
  she dismissed it and was pleased that Karen had asked for the medicine. She
  would allow one more normal milking as originally scheduled before the next
  stretching session. She hooked up the machine and pumped Karen's offering.
  It was still dark outside when the milking was completed and Karen's breasts
  detached from the machine. She was left face down on the uncomfortable table,
  her wrists still fastened to her sides, when the lights were shut off. As she
  lay there, her position too uncomfortable for sleep, her thoughts focused on
  her new predicament. Here she was alone, confined to this place and this experiment
  and ironically now more or less enslaved by her own bodily needs. She sobbed
  at the feeling of complete helplessness she had allowed herself to be trapped
  into. 
Karen's progress was going better than planned. Her milk had come in earlier
  than expected and the supply was exceeding expectations. Catherine kept track
  of each milking and was pleased to see an increase in every one. The schedule
  had been enough to keep Karen's breasts from becoming too engorged, while her
  body worked overtime to try and keep up with the ever increasing demand. Catherine
  knew the next stretching would show even greater results, although it would
  surely be more painful than the first. She smiled and began to think of other
  things that she might use in the future on her helpless subject. 
When Karen awoke it was morning and the sun was up. Although she had no way
  of knowing exactly how long it had been, she knew her breasts were full. There
  was a dull aching in them and the fact that they hung through the table had
  allowed gravity to take affect. They felt heavy as they tried to stretch further
  and further away from her body. Catherine was already in the room and seated
  stroking Karen's cheek. Karen looked up with a certain submissive look in her
  eyes. �Catherine I think I need to be milked?� 
�In a few minutes dear, but first its time for your next stretching session.
  We are going to do this a little differently this time but just like before
  your breasts are going to need to become very full before they are milked.� 
Karen looked at her longingly. �Please, do I really need to be stretched anymore?
  I have cooperated with you. I've taken the medicine. Please don't hurt me anymore.� 
�Now, now, it will be alright. You don't really have a choice. Even if we
  stopped you would soon find the ducts in your breasts are just not large enough
  yet. The hormones would still continue working in your body. Soon you will
  be producing twice the amount of milk that you are right now and it is crucial
  that we make you capable of carrying that supply.� Catherine paused, as tears
  began to form in Karen's eyes. 
She frowned, �You have so much to learn my little girl,� and she reached under
  the table and began to massage Karen's nipples. She reached into the tray by
  the bed and cupped first one and then the other hand into some sort of creamy
  lotion and she began to work it into the breast flesh of Karen. When she was
  satisfied, she moved out to the nipples. Instantly they erected and began to
  drip small drops of milk. Catherine then went back to the tray and retrieved
  two rubber band type devices which she then slipped over the base of each nipple.
  The effect was the head of the nipple swelled out over the band and the band
  on the base to tight to allow anything to leak from them. �Now Karen for the
  next half hour or so I'm going to show you how important these stretching sessions
  are. What I mean is that I am going to cause a let down reflex in your breasts
  and that should feel good, but with the bands in place the milk will have no
  way out, and you will soon see what I mean by needing to increase the capacity
  within you to store all of this new formed milk. Now, the first one shouldn't
  be too terribly painful, but I am going to continue and the second and third
  let down will show you how uncomfortable you would soon become. 
As soon as Catherine started to massage the nipples, Karen involuntarily responded,
  she instantly felt the warm feeling in her breasts as her nipples were being
  manipulated. She could not believe how quickly she was becoming conditioned.
  It was within minutes she sighed and felt her breasts let down. Her sigh soon
  turned to a moan as the milk rushed in, but with no where to go, they became
  swollen and hot as they expanded. Catherine continued for a few minutes more
  than stopped. 
Tears reappeared in her eyes as her moaning continued. 
�Is it painful dear?� 
Karen clinched her teeth and shook her head signaling, yes. 
�You are going to have to accept the fact that this is necessary. You must
  realize that I know what is best for you and you must trust me with my judgments.
  Now I know you are in some pain but this is absolutely necessary. I'll let
  you rest for a few minutes before we proceed.� 
Karen lay sobbing. Her breasts aching for relief from not only the forced
  let down, but also the fact that it had been a good thirty minutes past her
  normal milking and her breasts would have been naturally filled anyway. 
The burning continued even as she began to get use to the feeling. Tears began
  to run freely again when Catherine reappeared and again she started manipulating
  her nipples. Like before it took only a few minutes when she felt the feeling
  in them building and in no time at all, suddenly another let down was forced
  from her. This time the pain was immediate. There was no where for the milk
  to go as it overfilled every duct within her breast. She felt her tits were
  ready to burst and when she glanced at the monitor she could see why. They
  had swollen immensely and had a turned a bluish hue, as the skin stretched
  paper thin, desperately trying to accommodate. 
�Look how full they have become. Soon this is how much milk you'll be making
  in a two hour period. Look, your stretch marks are beginning to show,� as she
  traced the swollen skin with the back of her fingernails. �You don't want them
  to feel like this all the time do you?� 
Karen's chest was on fire. Her sobbing was continuous now. Her face tensed,
  eyes shut and tears flowing out the corners down her cheeks. She shook her
  head no. 
�No, I didn't think so.� Catherine began to knead the fleshy part of her breasts
  between her fingers and she occasionally squeezed the hardness of them causing
  even more pain. 
Karen could see blue veins bulging through the skin and indeed could see traces
  of red stretch marks as Catherine continued. It was when she started again
  to massage the nipples, Karen realized that even more pain was about to come.
  As she continued to massage and pull on the nubs, trying to milk them as a
  farmer would a cow. 
Karen tried to stop it but she could already feel the warm familiar rush beginning
  to form and desperately she broke her silence just as the let down occurred. �Oh
  god, pleaseeeee, I can't take anymore. Please stop, oh shit make them stop
  hurting please. Karen began to scream as the pain raced through her. 
Catherine let go of Karen's nipples and moved around so she could kiss and
  stroke her cheeks. Karen's screams had diminished to sobs and she openly wept.
  Catherine continued and lovingly kissed her cheek as she reached back under
  the table to her nipples and continued her massaging. Karen's face was contorted
  in pain, her eyes wide, starring straight into Catherine's, then suddenly they
  squeezed shut and she screamed as another let down cursed through her chest. 
When Catherine released the bands on her nipples, the milk starting squirting
  out in streams without any other stimulation as the pressure inside forced
  the fluid through the openings. Catherine allowed them to leak freely catching
  the milk in two glass containers. When the streams seemed to slow she reached
  for the stretching cups that had already been prepared for the session. Karen
  did not even whimper as they were fastened into place and her nipples temporarily
  pinched closed again, squeezing off the outlets. Catherine had let her breasts
  leak on purpose. She knew as swollen with milk as they had become she could
  not apply the vacuum cups without doing irreversible damage to the tissue in
  them. As it was, she knew the stretch marks that had already formed would not
  disappear anytime in the near future. She also knew soon there would be many
  more before she was through with her. 
Now that her breasts were not as full they slid easily into the tubes that
  had been selected. The new tubes didn't seem any larger in diameter than yesterdays,
  but they were noticeable longer. This, as Karen would soon find out, would
  allow her breasts to expand only slightly in circumference but the suction
  would try to pull them down the tube away from her body. Surprisingly it was
  not at all unpleasant when the vacuum started. Karen had stopped her crying
  and almost felt at ease as her breasts had been relieved of their immediate
  pressure and now that the suction had started there was even more relief within
  them. As the pressure cycled, the sides of the tube became filled and now they
  started to be drawn down. This was a new sensation for her and although not
  initially painful, she could feel the muscles struggling as they were pulled
  farther away from her. She did not question what was happening, for she believed,
  as Catherine had said that it would be for her own good. The cycling continued
  and increased for the next hour before finally her breasts filled the entire
  tube. Her breasts hurt so bad she could concentrate on nothing else. This pain
  was more muscle strain then the fullness she had felt before, but it was painful
  none the less. They stayed that way for at least another ten minutes until
  the nipple clamps were released and her milk was again allowed to flow. This
  milking was the longest one yet and she had numerous let downs before the supply
  finally began to dwindle. She felt relieved and empty as the machine continued
  for the next half hour even though the milk barely dribbled. 
When the machine was stopped and the cups removed it had been over two hours.
  She stared shockingly into to monitor. Her poor breasts were covered with tiny
  red marks running from her chest out towards the nipple, blue veins covered
  her breast flesh like roads on a map. Her breasts looked huge but now hung
  down loosely beneath her. The nipples stuck out at least three quarters of
  an inch and were close to that in diameter. She could only imagine what they
  would look like when they again became full. 
She was released from the machine, lead back into her room and allowed to
  rest. 
When the time had arrived for her next milking, Catherine removed the cover
  on the machine inside her room. It looked like a chair that someone had customized.
  There were arm rests with some kink of cylinders attached and wires and tubes
  leading to some kind of milking machine. Catherine explained. �Now it is time
  for you to learn how to milk yourself so that I can attend to other duties.
  I want you, when you hear this chime.� A button was pushed and a pleasant tone
  was heard through the speaker system. �To go over to the refrigerator and measure
  out twelve ounces of pre-blended medicine and drink it. Then you are to sit
  here and attach the machine to your breasts. When you flip this switch a small
  suction will start, allowing the nipple sleeves to stay attached. I'm sure
  by now you know how it is done. Once they are positioned, you are to slide
  your hands into these plastic cuffs. The machine will sense your hands in the
  cuffs and after five seconds they will inflate, locking them in place. This
  will then signal the machine which will have been preprogrammed for the appropriate
  milking session. Once your wrists are in the cuffs they will be locked in place
  until the session is over. When it is over they will automatically release
  and you can disconnect yourself and go about your business. Do you have any
  questions?� 
Karen shook her head, no. 
Now let's see how you do. Karen went to the kitchen and took the medicine
  as instructed. She then sat in the chair, flipped the switch, than attached
  first one milking sleeve and then the other to her nipples. �Now, slide your
  hands through the wrist cuffs and we can begin.� Karen slid both hands into
  position and the cuffs tightened. Seconds later the machine came to life and
  her milking cycle started. 
This routine was repeated throughout the day. Karen had no way of knowing
  the time interval had been shortened. Just like the day before she found her
  breasts never got uncomfortable full with the increase in milkings. She couldn't
  help but notice that she was thirsty almost all the time and Catherine encouraged
  her drink as much as she could. 
That night Karen found it uncomfortable sleeping on her stomach, her breasts
  throbbed when her weight was on them. Unable to continually sleep on her back
  she eventually slid over in the bed and allowed her breasts to hang free in
  the cutout holes. This position, she realized, felt much better and soon it
  was the only position which afforded her sleep. The next morning Karen made
  her final milking as instructed before her next stretching exercise was to
  take place. She was not at all looking forward to it and was surprised when
  Catherine entered her room carrying what appeared to be some form of bra. She
  instructed Karen to bend over and she would help her try it on. Karen bent
  at the waist so her breasts hung freely and with Catherine's help her tits
  were fed through openings where normally the cups would be. Once it was positioned
  Catherine pulled both straps together and fastened the quad hooks into place
  strapping it fit firmly around her rib cage. The cups of the bra were missing
  but there were strong rubber like cuffs at the base. When her breasts were
  forced thru like this, it caused her them to constrict down where they formed
  at her chest and it kept them constricted out two or three more inches, like
  an old fashioned corset. Karen looked up a Catherine with a puzzled expression. 
�This isn't really part of todays stretching exercise. This has more to do
  with shaping than stretching. It is important that we try many different things
  each one helping in a different way. This may take a few weeks or even longer.
  This bra is designed with sleeves to help shapen your breasts. As they have
  grown I have observed your whole chest area has expanded to help accommodate.
  That is not acceptable as I am sure that you don't want your breasts to look
  like udders, so I think it is important that we keep your breasts well formed
  and defined. Now these sleeves will constrict the supporting tissue at the
  base. This will add definition by reducing the diameter around the chest to
  give you a shapelier, well defined bust line. You will wear this indefinitely
  and the sleeves will be progressively tightened until I feel the desired results
  have been attained. With time your muscles and tendons with atrophy and the
  change will become permanent.� 
Karen could only stare down at her breasts which hung loosely from their recent
  milking. With the base of each one constricted, the rest of the breast ballooned
  out once free of the binding making them look even larger than they had before,
  she worried what they would look like when they filled again. 
Catherine then banded Karen's nipples like she had before to keep them from
  leaking. She then showed Karen the removable cups which were to be fitted over
  the elastic sleeves, making it truly a nursing bra. They were grossly too large. 
Catherine went on to explain. �This will be today's stretching exercise. These
  cups are equipped with pressure indicators in the attachments.� She showed
  Karen something at the hooks of the cup. �When the cups began to stretch, they
  will reach a predetermined value. This disc will turn from white to green indicating
  the cups are straining on the hooks. That will happen when you're your breasts
  expand over the next few hours and they have totally filled the cups. It may
  take awhile, but based on the previous stretching sessions, eventually they
  will. That's when the bra will be removed and we will milk you in the normal
  fashion. In the mean time you are free to do as you please and we will just
  wait for the indicators to change.� 
�Catherine I don't see how my breasts will ever fill these cups. Look at them,
  they are huge.� 
�Karen, you just finished milking, that's why you appear so small now. I know
  that your breasts will eventually grow to this cup size and even larger before
  were through.� She said with a knowing smile. 
�Please, I beg you, don't make me do this.� Karen knew how painful this would
  be. �Please I can't go that long without being milked.� 
�Now don't be silly, I know you can. Now I encourage you to get something
  to eat and drink plenty of liquids. It will speed the process along, and the
  faster they fill the shorter the time you will be uncomfortable. With your
  nipples sealed and your breasts covered I will waive rule number one, in fact,
  I encourage you to try and stimulate your breasts with your hands as painful
  as it may be.� She pointed over to a pile of books she had brought in. �I suggest
  you try reading some of these as they will help pass the time and may even
  take your mind off of your current situation. 
Catherine left the room and Karen made herself something to eat and drink.
  She thought she would try and drink a lot and maybe get this stretching exercise
  over with without too much agony. She felt relieved that she was finally allowed
  to touch her own breasts, even though it was hard to feel much thorough the
  thick material of her new bra. She brought both hands to her chest and began
  to massage herself. She couldn't help but notice the difference from just a
  few days ago as her tits were noticeably larger than what she remembered before. 
Karen decided to take Catherine's advice and started looking for a good book.
  She felt uncomfortable as she scanned the selection. All the books seemed to
  be of an adult nature and some of the titles she didn't quite understand. Titles
  like �Saphho Lust� and �Mothers Slave Girl� were just a couple. None the less
  she picked an innocent looking one and started reading. 
It took less than an hour and Karen's breasts were starting to ache. The bands
  in her bra that were restricting the base of her tits were truly doing their
  job. She continued to swell and the only place her breasts could go was out
  past the restriction. Karen could still feel how loose the cups were and knew
  she had a long way to go before the bra would be filled. She brought her fingers
  into play and gently started to roll her nipples between them. She closed her
  eyes and tried to drift away as she continued to stimulate them, hoping that
  a let down or two might fill her enough to somehow complete and end this stretching
  exercise. It didn't take long and she felt the rush as the milk flowed down
  filling her breasts and then suddenly their pain increased as the milk was
  backed up against her tightly bound nipples. She looked down at her bra hoping
  to find it tight, only to be disappointed as she saw the cups still wrinkled
  and loose. 
She went back to her reading. The story was about a girl who had been befriended
  by an older woman and eventually moved in with her. Although well written there
  were definite sexual undertones. Karen could feel herself becoming aroused
  as she read on. She felt both aroused and guilty for that arousal as it turned
  into a lesbian scene, but she continued to read. 
Another half hour had passed before the pain in her chest made concentrating
  on the book impossible. She waited another five or ten minutes and again began
  to stimulate her nipples. Even though it was painful, deep down inside her
  breasts it felt good and just as before it didn't take long and she felt the
  flood suddenly release from within and surge out seeking release. Again the
  pain shot through as before, but now when she looked down she could see some
  of the wrinkles in her bra cup beginning to fade away. It gave her the renewed
  hope she needed. Karen then remembered and went back to the sink and drank
  a couple more glasses of water, knowing that Catherine said that it would help.
  When she returned she sat down and almost sadistically started to massage her
  nipples again. Though she was in pain she knew that this was her only way out. 
Unfortunately for Karen, it took four more letdowns and another hour and a
  half for the bra to become tight enough to stretch the indicator discs. She
  was sobbing and grasping at her chest when Catherine returned. 
�Karen please remove your hands from your breasts and place them at your sides.� 
She did as she was told, clenching her eyes shut in pain as her pain had become
  unbearable. 
�Until I till you otherwise rule number one is back enforce again. Is that
  clear?� 
�Yes Catherine.� Came the almost hypnotic reply. Tears flowed freely down
  Karen's cheeks. 
Catherine checked the disc on the cups and smiled as indeed both indicators
  showed green, but before releasing her from the harness she brought a chair
  up in front of Karen and sat down. She picked up the book Karen had been reading
  and began to read the next passage. She read a couple of lines and laid it
  back down. �Karen, I hope you like the selection of books we have for you.
  I'll make sure that in the next few weeks you have plenty of time between sessions
  for reading them. They are all classics and I hope you may come to appreciate
  the author's views over time.� 
Karen looked up with concern. Not quite comprehending the insinuations, but
  she found herself staring directly into Catherine's eyes. Something changed
  between them at that moment, but before anymore was said. Catherine reached
  up and grasped Karen's nipples through the fabric of the cups and began to
  massage the overly engorged nipples again. 
Karen continued the stare almost defiantly, but her tears continued to stream
  down her cheeks. She knew she would be forced to suffer through another let
  down. 
It didn't take long either as Catherine knew just what to do. But this time
  just as it began, Catherine leaned forward and with both their eyes locked
  together, she kissed Karen forcefully upon her lips. Karen moaned and as her
  let down rushed through her, she parted her lips allowing Catherine to explore
  the recesses within her with her eager tongue. When their lips parted Karen
  was in another world, almost past the part of pain. Tears' still streaming
  but some unexplainable feeling was building within her. 
Catherine reached down and with some difficulty released the hooks from the
  cups of the bra. She slowly removed the devices from Karen's breasts all the
  while keeping contact with her eyes. Karen although now engorged more than
  she had ever been before, felt a slight relief as her tits were freed. Catherine
  bent her head down and sucked gentle on Karen's still banded nipple, causing
  another moan to escape her lips. Karen felt tenderness in the way Catherine
  was handling her now. When she stopped, she leaned back and breaking eye contact
  looked down at Karen's swollen chest. As Karen too looked down, her sobbing
  increased. Her once attractive breasts were covered in deep blue veins and
  long red lengthwise marks. The bands still in place at the base of her breasts
  had kept that part from enlarging. But the area where the bands stopped had
  swollen to three times what they had been before. Her entire breast stood straight
  out, rock hard. There was not even a hint of sag as the skin could not stretch
  enough to allow it, even though the weight of the milk they contained was tremendous.
  Every muscle and ligament across the top of her breasts was now visible, stretched
  to the point of breaking. 
Catherine massaged the swollen mass, smiling triumphantly at what she had
  accomplished. �Time for relief Karen,� she said as she led her back over to
  the milking chair. �Now I am going to remove the bands from your nipples. I
  want you to attach the milking sleeves as soon as I pull the bands off. I need
  to have an exact measurement of your supply.� Karen shook her head in acknowledgement.
  Carefully Catherine fought with the bands around Karen's nipples and with difficulty
  removed them one at a time. As each band was removed Karen placed the sleeves
  quickly over each nipple before any milk could be lost, the suction in the
  outer sleeve fastening them tightly. As Karen moved her hands down the arms
  of the chair and into the cuffs, they inflated and Catherine kissed her on
  the cheek as the machine cycled on. The milking sleeves began to pull Karen's
  nipples further into the sleeve before the milking sequence began. Karen had
  what felt like a small shudder within her body as the sleeves began to constrict
  and tug on her nipples as finally her milk was allowed to flow. She noticed
  that the cycle was modified this time. Instead of short pulsing, there was
  a steadily increasing suction being applied to her nipples. It would build
  for about 30 seconds, then release for just a few, then start again and it
  was causing the milk to literally gush out of her. It felt good as it was quickly
  pulling large streams from her and was starting to provide her with the relief
  she so desperately needed. She relaxed as best as she could and closed her
  eyes. She had another letdown, but this one felt more like pleasure than the
  pain that the last one had caused. She suddenly felt lips brushing against
  her mouth again and she opened her lips to accept the long lingering kiss.
  The kiss became more aggressive as Catherine's tongue began to explore the
  recess it had entered. She felt new sensations within her and realized that
  these letdowns were like mini orgasms, only they were coming from her breasts.
  She let herself go with the welcomed sensations, moaning against Catherine's
  lips. She could hear the pump chugging and bogging down as it struggled trying
  to pull so much milk through the machines tubing. It felt to Karen like it
  would never end as the whir of the machine continued. She opened her eyes as
  the kiss broke and watched as her breasts jumped and jiggled with the rhythm
  of the machine, the tubes staying full, continuing to pull a steady stream
  of milk from her. She looked up again at Catherine and a relaxed smile appeared. 
After 20 minutes of constant pumping and god knows how many more letdowns,
  she began to feel like she was finally empty. As she looked down she could
  see the milk had slowed to a trickle. Her once bursting breasts had deflated
  like half filled water balloons, gravity and the weight of the nipple sleeves
  overcoming the swelling within them, as they now hung down loosely pointing
  towards the floor. Karen who only minutes ago had felt so relaxed and calm
  now began to cry as a feeling of guilt overcame her. She had actually enjoyed
  the feeling from the kiss and from the last few milking's. Now as she watched
  her sagging breasts she realized that she was turning into nothing more than
  a dependant cow, waiting patiently for her udders to be milked. Catherine watched
  as the emotions unfolded and could sense the change. She knew that Karen's
  spirit would soon be broken and her enslavement would then be complete. 
Two weeks had passed since Karen had given birth and she had lost track of
  the days much less the milking's. With no television, radio or any outside
  contact what was happening in here was beginning to feel normal to her. She
  was breaking emotionally and she longed for human contact and the compassion,
  and understanding that went with it. She began to look at Catherine in a different
  way too, more as a mentor, friend, but still strict authoritarian, someone
  who she continually wanted to please, she thrived on the attention that her
  milking sessions were giving her. It was the combination of these things and
  from the books she was reading, as most of Karen's free time was now filled
  reading from the room's selection of novels. As suspected they were all lesbian
  themed and almost all involved some form of submission or bondage. Karen began
  to imagine herself in some of things she read. 
Catherine, knowing what was developing, was changing her habits as well. She
  was purposely touching Karen more intimately than before. Things like stroking
  of the cheeks, the back of the neck or through her hair. And although she was
  never one who wore perfume, she now stopped using anything artificial in her
  personal hygiene as well, as she wanted Karen to become familiar with her natural
  pheromones. At the milking table she would purposely stand at the side of the
  table by Karen's head, her crotch at eye level, knowing Karen could not help
  but to smell the scent between her legs. It wouldn't be long she knew, till
  Karen would be hers. 
Karen had also been started on an exercise program and although it felt good
  to start doing things at first, it now made her breasts ache from lack of support
  whenever she began to jog or jump. She was never allowed to wear anything above
  her waist for support other than the forming sleeves which still encased the
  base of her tits and it seemed like Catherine purposely her scheduled her exercise
  program right before a milking when her breasts would be their fullest and
  also their heaviest. In those two weeks her breasts had grown from a somewhat
  normal looking 36D to something unimaginable. When they were full they ballooned
  from the sleeves, rock hard and the size of melons, but when they were drained
  they hung loosely on her chest totally soft and muscle less. It was unbelievable
  how they could change so quickly. Dark blue veins now crisscrossed each one
  starting at the aureoles and spreading out in all directions and stretch marks
  formed in deep grooves lengthwise across the top and sides as the muscles and
  skin were just not able to support the increased size and weight. Karen still
  cried at times fearing that her once beautiful figure would be gone forever,
  but the desire to please and the encouragement from Catherine easily overpowered
  those feeling. Her life now so totally focused on her milking's that she thought
  of little else. She waited anxiously for her next session for the pleasure
  and even the pain that the next stretching might bring. 
The next week brought about a change in the program. One morning she had been
  brought back into the milking room, lying face down on the table she had grown
  accustomed to, with Karen standing closely by her head. Her breasts were positioned
  into the familiar milking cups and her stretching session began. After nearly
  two hours and the inevitable pain and subsequent pleasure of her draining,
  the machine was stopped. Catherine was obviously not satisfied. 
Catherine explained, �Karen your progress seems to have stalled a bit and
  right now I think you are falling behind schedule. You are now giving almost
  a pint out of each breast per milking but have shown little increase in the
  last three days. Right now we had hoped that you would be up to a pint and
  a half or more and still increasing.� 
�I'm afraid we are going to have to modify our routine slightly to further
  encourage you along.� 
To Karen's dismay, she was assisted into another room and helped into the
  exam chair. Catherine removed the bands at the base of her breasts which had
  been on for well over three weeks now. Her breasts felt relief but it was to
  be only temporary as before she could even see or touch them, Catherine applied
  some kind of jell to each one and applied another strange looking rubber sleeve
  over them. Although it felt good to have on something different they were still
  squeezed firmly and forced to elongate within the new tube, actually even longer
  then before, but only the first few inches of the sleeve, closest to her chest
  felt tight and the rest of the sleeve seemed much stretchier. It covered almost
  her entire breast allowing only her nipple to be exposed. Karen had no idea
  what these were for and she did not see the electrical connector on the bottom
  side of each sleeve. 
With both breasts encased, Catherine explained. �We have you on the highest
  amount of hormones that I think you can safely handle so we are going to try
  other forms of stimulation, more physical in nature.� She added a belt to Karen's
  waist which contained a rectangular box with electrical wires and connectors
  at both ends. Even though Karen couldn't see past her breasts she could still
  till that Catherine connected the wires from the box to the underside of each
  sleeve. 
Catherine went on to explain. �The sleeves contain hundreds of tiny electrodes
  and are transistorized to randomly activate two electrodes at a time. Your
  breasts were coated with a conductive jell that will complete the circuit through
  your breast tissue. The idea is to stimulate the nerves and muscles in your
  breasts and to kind of put them into overdrive as far as their production go.
  I'm told it is not painful, but it will probable be a little uncomfortable
  until you get used to it. 
�Please, I'm scared. I want to please you but,� and she began to cry. 
Karen quickly held her reassuringly, �It will be alright, I'll stay with you
  the whole time,� and she kissed her on the cheek. � We have to try this. There
  is a lot of people that have put a great deal of time and money into it. Come
  now, don't disappoint me, I really want you to do this for me.� 
Through tearing eyes, Karen's lips quivered an almost silent, �Okay.� 
Now, where was I? Oh yes, the voltage is high but in short micro amp bursts,
  that do no permanent damage. The sleeves are two independent systems and are
  electrically protected so the shocks will not be going any further than the
  base of the sleeve, it won't be going across your heart or any vital organs,
  only your breasts. Once it is activated it is all automatic and the box on
  your belt is actually a small computer that computes the best program to use.
  The sleeves have additional sensors that feed back into the computer. It will
  modify the program based on your progress. Oh, and I was informed that because
  some of the subjects that this will be used on in the future may not be quite
  as cooperative as you it is important that you not tamper with the connectors
  or try to remove the sleeves or it will sense this and will give you a discouraging
  correction.� 
Discouraging correction? If she had not been afraid before, Karen definitely
  was now. She watched as Catherine took a key and knew that the device had now
  been turned on, she braced herself and closed her eyes, although she felt nothing. 
�Relax Karen, it takes a while for it to go through its self test before you'll
  feel anything. Just relax, it won't be that bad.� 
Karen couldn't relax or stop the nervousness as she could only wait in anticipation.
  Finally she thought she could feel a little sting on her left breast, then
  another on her right. They were short and quick and felt like nothing more
  than a slight twitch then stopped. She took a deep breath and settled herself,
  thinking this might just not be that bad. The slight sting was followed with
  another sharper sting on the right side in a different spot and an even stronger
  reflexing twitch, followed closely by one on the left. 
Her eyes got bigger and she had a frightened look on her face now. 
Within seconds there was another and then another, now both sides stung at
  once. The strength of the shocks was definitely going up and in the next few
  seconds she was getting multiple shocks in both breasts as she began to squirm
  about in her chair. Soon both breasts were alive with the tiny bites of electricity
  and were twitching and jerking as the muscles were electrically stimulated.
  She looked down at the top of her breasts and could see what she was feeling.
  Her breasts moved as if they were being massaged as the flesh rolled in waves. 
�Now it looks like has started nicely, will see how you do in the next few
  hours.� 
�Next few hours, oh please I can't. I'll never make it; my chest feels like
  it's on fire.� 
�You can do it, I know you can, trust me.� 
The minutes felt like hours as Karen's breasts were repeatedly stung with
  current, and the muscles in each milk duct spasmed and cramped. The milk which
  began to slowly refill into the ducts acted as an internal electrical conductor
  and helped the current penetrate deeper into the sensitive tissue. In less
  than thirty minutes Karen's breasts were filled enough to start stretching
  the flexible part of her sleeves and milk began to drip freely from her nipples.
  Catherine quickly banded them not wanting anything to escape yet. 
Soon as the pressure started to increase her breasts began to balloon out
  over the tight part of the sleeves. It became even more painful as they expanded.
  The natural muscles which had been strained to their limits almost daily, in
  one second were being stretched with her engorgement, then the next second
  zapped with the electrical current and forced to tightly contract. Unbeknownst
  to Karen, this side effect was also planned. This would stress the muscles
  beyond their capability and semi-permanently take away what little breast tone
  she still retained. 
It was one full hour of constant torture and Karen was tired and sore and
  oh so full. The stimulation had definitely worked as her breasts had swelled
  out from her chest like big round balls. 
Karen was again brought to the flat table and assumed the face down position
  with her breasts hanging freely through the cutouts. What Karen hoped would
  be the end of the session and her relief was not to be. Her breasts were not
  hooked up to the milker but instead, two large glass containers were positioned
  directly beneath her. Catherine pushed a button on the side of Karen's belt
  and the shocks stopped. She then released the bands from Karen's nipples and
  milk began to stream out into the containers. Satisfied that everything was
  positioned correctly she went back to the belt and pushed yet another button. 
Karen instantly jumped as the sleeves came back to life. Only this time the
  shocks were much stronger and longer, forcing a scream from her. She tried
  to lift herself up only to realize that at some point she had been strapped
  down and then Catherine quickly forced her wrists to the table and strapped
  them as well. As she continued to struggle the intense shocks increased. Immobilized
  Karen could only scream as the electrical fire cursed through her. 
Catherine turned back, oblivious to her cries to watch and smile as Karen's
  breasts began to constrict and shoot out thick streams of milk. The shocks
  were causing Karen to literally milk herself as the computer timed the contractions
  to squeeze the milk through the ducts like a well trained farmer milking a
  cow. It was so painful that she could not even feel the normal pressure release
  as the milk streamed from her. This was the most efficient milking that Catherine
  had ever witnessed as the nipples seemed to explode as the whitish liquid sprayed
  from her. She also knew that after today she wouldn't be able to milk her this
  way again for a least a week without totally destroying the muscles. But for
  now she watched in ah as the milk sprayed freely. 
The containers soon filled to a pint and her breasts showed no signs of slowing.
  Soon a pint and a quarter then a pint and a half as Karen was reduced to a
  shaking mass, her body still continuing to jerk with each shock. She couldn't
  see how much milk she had given, she just prayed that it would soon end. Finally
  after what seemed like an eternity the milk streams began to slow and the shocks
  began to decrease. Soon after her breasts were down to a steady drip and the
  computer stopped. She broke down and cried like never before. Her breasts burned
  and numb from the pain as Catherine released the straps holding her to the
  table and helped her to a sitting position. Karen tried to cradle her breasts
  but the rubber sleeves offered little comfort. Catherine, sitting next to her,
  moved Karen's hands away and cradled her head down to her chest, rubbing her
  cheek as she continued to cry. �There, its okay, its all over now dear, it's
  all done, you did great. I am so proud of you.� Karen's sobs began to slow
  and she began to feel better form the comforting and the reassurance. Catherine
  lifted her chin up, until their lips joined and kissed her deeply. As the kiss
  ended Karen lowered her head back down and cuddled against Catherine's breast.
  She felt a warm sense of security as she snuggled closer, inhaling deeply the
  wonderfully intoxicating scent of this woman.
