Her Last Day



I
The cell was whitewashed, harshly lit and stinking.&nbsp; Ally had been holed up in this characterless small room for three days now.&nbsp; The walls were smooth and white, the floor smooth and grey and cold.&nbsp; One end of the three-foot wide cubicle was taken up by a heavy steel door with a peephole.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Three days ago Ally had been sentenced to death.&nbsp; To hang.&nbsp; And even in this simple execution method Illakians invested a great deal of imagination and depraved cruelty.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The comely barmaid&#8217;s flat had been raided and literature encouraging a &#8216;liberal&#8217; backlash against the new even more patriarchal laws that had been introduced by the Emperor had been found.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The court had been full when the judge read out the sentence.&nbsp; �Allyson Herrada, you have been found guilty of sedition and assisting treason. You will be hanged by the neck until dead; you are now sub-human.�&nbsp; The court cheered &#8211; a traitor was always the most hated convict.&nbsp; Ally moaned in shock.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;As a sub-human, the young blonde was forced to strip off all her clothes while in the cage-like dock, forcing the 22-year-old to bear her fit and shapely body as her hands were cuffed behind her back.&nbsp; She was immediately led away and took straight to this cell in the Public Punishments and Executions Division of Grand City Justice Palace, where she had been ever since, for nearly 80 hours now.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Ally didn&#8217;t know how long though.&nbsp; She guessed she had spent the first few hours crying and wailing, not able to comprehend what had happened.

She didn&#8217;t know how long she had been in this hole.&nbsp; The dim lights were never turned off.&nbsp; She had literally been left to rot.&nbsp; The PPED staff knew that she would executed on the Wednesday, but Ally was not told that.&nbsp; The staff also knew that their only responsibility was to provide a conscious body to the executioner &#8211; other than that absolutely no money or time was to be wasted on giving a condemned sub-human any comforts, because sub-humans have no rights and have no life.

By comforts was meant anything.&nbsp; This included food, water, heating, a toilet or bedding.&nbsp; Again no-one had told her this; she had just been thrown in this cubby indefinitely as far as she was concerned.&nbsp; After she had unsuccessfully tried sleeping on the concrete floor, she felt hungry and realised that food might be in short supply.&nbsp; Another stretch of time and she was beginning to guess that none would be forthcoming.&nbsp; She was starting to get stomach cramps and crouched on the floor in hunger.&nbsp; The guards that occasionally looked unseen through the peephole laughed at the naked girl&#8217;s pain, but that door did not open.&nbsp; Her fear and confusion at her death sentence was beginning to be replaced in her thoughts by extreme discomfort.

Eventually she realised she had not visited the toilet in a long time and was now needing a piss.&nbsp; Again she tried banging on the heavy steel door but that was soundproofed.&nbsp; This turned into a desperate need and somehow her logic was functioning and it told her that standing in a corner near the door would afford her privacy from the peephole.&nbsp; Resting her hands against the wall she released a huge fountain of relief.&nbsp; She noticed how her heavily-coloured piss was running under her feet.&nbsp; She realised that the cell was built deliberately with a slight gradient in the floor so that the stinking liquid collected at the far end.

These are the conditions she had been living in.&nbsp; A prolonged exposure to this torture may harm somebody over a while, but she would be alive after four days, which was all that mattered to the PPED.

She had retaken to lying on the floor, clutching her churning stomach and crying.&nbsp; The lack of heating in this concrete cell was beginning to become a factor as well and she had been shivering, goose pimples running down her body.&nbsp; And still her body produced waste.&nbsp; After three days, her bowels were starting to scream at her.&nbsp; She had pissed herself another couple of times by then, not even bothering to shield her privacy; just resting on the floor and letting the urine cascade down her legs.&nbsp; Suddenly her bowels gave way and a torrent of sloppy shit raged from her backside, congealing a slimy puddle round her ass before slowly making its way to join the piss.&nbsp; She couldn&#8217;t control this and it happened another couple of times.&nbsp; Occasionally she retched at her living conditions, but there was nothing to throw up.

***

Bloody Drew.&nbsp; She had told her supposed boyfriend that she didn&#8217;t want those pamphlets in her flat.&nbsp; Apparently he had ignored her.&nbsp; Why couldn&#8217;t she have picked a nicer guy from all those that tried to chat her up across the bar, not the only male rebel in Grand City.&nbsp; Drew had played truant from Sunday School, like other rebels, and Ally had always put those distorted political and religious views down to that.&nbsp; The tragedy was that she was not a traitor - she loved the Emperor, she cherished Him as the Lord God in human form and would never dare in her most perverted dreams contest a holy decree from him.&nbsp; The court laughed at that.&nbsp; She hadn&#8217;t proved her innocence.&nbsp; The judge saw how deeply hated this one was and gave the crowd what they wanted.&nbsp; Drew was probably deeply underground and miles away from Grand City now, never coming to sacrifice his liberty for his supposed girlfriend&#8217;s life.&nbsp; Some lover.

Richard Longstaff was a captain of the Imperial Guard responsible for Wednesday&#8217;s midweek special performance in Justice Square.&nbsp; There was usually some public punishment or execution everyday in Justice Square, but multiple or unusual executions were usually held at weekends or on Wednesday afternoons to entertain the bigger audiences.&nbsp; Three convicts would be at the gallows on Wednesday; Ally, a prostitute caught for the third time and a thief.&nbsp; By far the most intriguing was Ally.&nbsp; The other two were poor girls from the Shacks and one could almost understand their immoral crimes because they were desperate for money; unpatriotic crimes such as sedition on the other hand seemed to Illakians incomprehensibly repugnant.&nbsp; It also helped that Ally was the better looking, the other two being tanned and skinny vagrants that are two a penny in public punishment.

He ordered Herrada&#8217;s cell door to be opened.

***

Ally thought she had been in there weeks, a month even.&nbsp; In fact it was three days and it was Tuesday afternoon &#8211; she didn&#8217;t know it, but she in the last 24 hours of her life.&nbsp; Suddenly the cell door opened.&nbsp; Her head whipped up in expectation; she had been praying for this for days.&nbsp; Were they bringing food and water?&nbsp; Instead, her first human contact was two burly guards laughing at her state, mockingly whiffing their noses and pointing at the pathetic naked girl kneeling on the floor.&nbsp; They were also appreciating one of the most beautiful girls to go through their slimy hands.

�Sort her out,� Longstaff ordered from behind and went off to other matters.

The larger guard came in and forcibly dragged her to her feet and pushed her against a wall, wrapping her wrists behind her in a tie wrap.&nbsp; She moaned in discomfort.

�Been having fun?� he hissed sarcastically, looking at the mess.

�Food� water,� Ally gasped through her parched throat.

�Did you not listen to the judge?� the guard laughed. �You&#8217;re a piece of meat with no feelings worth worrying about; you&#8217;ll really need to impress us to earn privileges like food.�&nbsp; His free hand had been greedily roaming her front torso and had now made its way to penetrating her bone-dry pussy, slipping in two fingers.&nbsp; The exhausted Ally merely grunted at the pain.

�Come on Marty,� the other guard said, �let&#8217;s get her cleaned up; they&#8217;ll be plenty of time for that later.�&nbsp; The large guard pushed her towards the door.

�Come on pigmeat.�

***

Her unexercised leg muscles failing her, she was half led, half dragged up to another room in the interminable labyrinth that was Justice Palace.&nbsp; It was deliberately designed as one huge building, making it impossible to actually get out of if a girl ever did manage to break free from her cell in any of the divisions.

She was brought into a large empty room that was tiled with a gutter running down the centre.&nbsp; This is it, she thought, her execution.&nbsp; It would be in this grubby little chamber in the middle of Justice Palace.&nbsp; She moaned and tried to resist.

The guards just laughed but to her relief did not string her up but attached her hands to shackles hanging down from the ceiling in the middle of the room.

�Please��&nbsp; She was trying to form some plea, for anything, for mercy, but the words kept sticking in her throat.

The guards had disappeared behind her.&nbsp; She jerked when she felt a jet of ice cold water hit her behind.&nbsp; She shrieked and tried to twist to see what was happening.&nbsp; The guards were trailing a hosepipe for the wall.

�Shower time,� the one called Marty leered.

Marty started to spray the water all over her body as she used her remaining energy trying to avoid the jet.&nbsp; She hadn&#8217;t thought she could have gotten colder.&nbsp; The other guard, taller, thinner and apparently more sober-minded still took get relish soaping up her unprotected body.&nbsp; Ally felt the vulnerability of her nakedness all over again, and started to weep as both guards made special attention that she was clean between her legs.&nbsp; Some of her exes had claimed she was a cock-tease; the truth was that she attracted men easily, but was never keen on sex, regarding her pussy as her most intimate and private possession, not to be given away lightly.&nbsp; Here were these two grubby perverts playing with it like she was a toy, a doll.

The next stage, apparently, was to make her a true sub-human.&nbsp; Her pussy was to be shaved.&nbsp; Again this required a lot of attention for the guards.&nbsp; Ally looked away in shame.&nbsp; Her crotch bald, a blast of icy water cleared away foam, and made her jump in her chains.&nbsp; The guards checked her armpits.&nbsp; Women in this world are not normally capable of growing hair in their armpits, but there are a small number of freaks who require shaving.&nbsp; Thankfully, Ally was not one.

�Here, have some water you gobby cow,� Marty said and thrust the hose in her mouth and let the jet fill her mouth up.&nbsp; Ally was taken by surprise; her throat hurt and most of the water dribbled back down her torso, but she managed to retain some of the precious liquid.

�Thank you,� she heard herself say.&nbsp; She couldn&#8217;t believe she was thanking them for giving her one drop of water in who knows how long.&nbsp; She felt herself losing any mental battle.

The guards entertained, they left her hanging, shivering.
