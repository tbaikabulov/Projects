Steal from Me, Never &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;



I thought it was going to be a good day. I sat down at my desk in my home which I work from, you knelling by my legs waiting to hear any command I issue. I opened the letter and started to read it. You can tell the change in my demeanor as you see the fury in my eyes, I drop the letter on the floor and say.

�Read that and tell me if they deserve to be punished.�

You take the letter in your hand and see it is from a law office, I see the expression change on your face as the meaning of the letter sinks in, I see you sigh as you read on knowing it is not you but someone else who will feel my wraith. You hand the letter back to me and say.

�Yes Sir this person needs to be punished.�

I pick up the phone and call my lawyer and tell him, he is to sue the person in the letter, and there will be no lenience. He asks for me to send the letter and I take it from the desk and fax it to him. I wait until he has read it then hear him say.

�I&#8217;ll take care of it immediately.�

You know I am angry, and I feel your body clasp to my leg. I look down you are clad in a short robe and your collar. I work on my correspondence for some time. You never move or say anything, just waiting to serve. After some time at my desk I say.

�Fetch some fruit and coffee�

I watch you rise and&nbsp; run out of the room, to do as I bid. I think to myself yes you are the right one. You return with a plate of fresh fruit and a cup of coffee. You approach the desk and kneel by it and offer the plate and coffee to me. I start to eat and drink my coffee. Not a word from you about being hungry as you kneel there. I take a piece of fruit from the plate and hold it in front of your mouth, you bite down on the fruit and eat it. The juices run on my fingers and your chin. I repeat feeding you until the fruit is gone. I hold my hand in front of your face it is dripping with the juice, and feel you lick them clean, not once have your hands left your thighs as you kneel there. I break the silence saying.

�You will help to punish this person,�&nbsp; as I take the paper and crumple it in my hand.

You say � Yes Sir�


  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I tell you to go get showered and dress as company will be coming to the house. You get up and take the empty plate and quickly leave the room. I turn to my computer and start to write my newest story. My style of writing is unique as I don&#8217;t describe submissive or use names, I have been told by submissive they can immerse&nbsp;&nbsp; themselves in the story when I don&#8217;t use she, or her but only you. The phone rings a very distraught female cursing and saying foul things about me is on the line, all I say.

�When you can show respect, I will listen.� And hang up.

I know there is no use trying to write as the phone will ring again, and all too soon the phone rings again. The woman is less historical this time, apologized, I inform her I don&#8217;t do business on the phone give her my address and tell her she will be here in two hours or my attorneys will handle it. Then I hang up the phone. I go back to writing my story after about one hour you come into the room. You have on a skirt and blouse and heels you walk up to the desk and kneel the top four button of your blouse is undone and I see the gold chain sway between your breasts. I knew at each end the clamps bite into your nipples. Around your neck is your collar. I look into your eyes and say.

�There will no shoes worn in this room today �

�Yes Sir,� you say as you reach down and take them off 

I take the shoes and place them under the desk, then get up and walk around the desk and take the lone chair that is before it, pick it up and carry it to the foyer by the front door. The only other furniture in the room is bookcases and my desk and chair. I say to you as I walk back and sit down in my chair. 

�Only you will sit in that chair today�

�Yes Sir � is your reply.

I tell you to go and fix lunch, I will be eating at my desk and you had better get something too, as you have a long day ahead of you I watch you scamper out of the room barefoot on the carpet. After about 15 minutes you return with a large salad and drink. You start to kneel, but I motion you to stay standing. I reach out and take the food and drink and tell you to hurry as company will be arriving soon and I want you seated in the chair, you rush out of the room and disappear down the hallway after 10 minutes or so I look up and see you sit in the chair. There is a knock at the door and I tell you to answer it. You open the door I hear the clicking of heels on the tile of the foyer. I see you both at the doorway as you take your seat, the woman starts to enter the room and I hear you say.

�Sir does not allow shoes in that room�

She looks down at you with disdain and marches past you, she starts to enter the room. She walks right up to the desk and throws a paper onto it demanding the meaning of it. I stand and look her over she is dressed in business attire with boots that come to mid calves a skirt and women&#8217;s suit jacket. Hair pulled back in a bun. I say


� If you cannot respect me or my house, our business is over and point to the door.�

She stammers that she just wants to know what the problem is, all I do is point to the door, she turns and walks to the foyer, Now she looks around as if trying to find something to sit down on but the only chair is the one you sit in. She turns back to the door then to the room where I stand waiting. She bends at the waist and tries to take off her boots but keeps faltering in her attempts to get them off. You hear her curse as she lowers herself to the floor and sits down and removes her boots. She gets up and gives you the look of pure hatred as she walks by you into the room. I sit back down in my chair and wait. She approaches the desk, and I know she is furious now. I laugh inside.&nbsp; She has not even begun to pay for her treachery. I let her ramble on about how I was so unfair that to threaten her with losing everything was unfair and unjust. When her rambling came to an end, I said.

�You took what belongs to me, and you will be punished.�

I watched as my words sank in, her finger clutched the end of the desk as she stammered and said how she knew we could come to an arraignment without involving the courts and lawyers. That she knew I was a reasonable man and something could be done to work thru this mess. I waited til she was done talking. Then I said.

� You may choose will the laws punish you or will I.� 

I get up from the desk and walked out to the foyer. And lead you into the room, I stop you at the front of the desk next to her and you kneel down beside her, she looks to you then to me as I sit back down and say

�You will sit there as she is and decide who will punish you me or the law,� as I point to the floor by you. She looks aghast at my words, then states she wants to know who I think I am to talk to her so. I point to where you are kneeling so proudly by her and say.

� You may stay or go the choice is yours, I will tell you when I am ready to discuss this matter.�.

She turns and looks to the door, then to me, then to you, she starts to speak and with her first words, I stand and say.

�You may leave our business is done, if you speak again.�

I watch you not a questioning look to me just head lowered and kneeling proudly there. I watch her as my words sink home. I know no man has talked to her as I am. She looks down at you as you kneel there, thighs spread a skirt pulled up around your waist. I hear her sigh as she lowers herself to the floor onto her knees and still lower til kneeling before the desk, she bites her lip as if to silence the rage she feels in doing so. I watch you sit upright and straight as if to show her the proper way. I see she has her thighs pressed tightly together, her arms folded below her breasts as if to show her defiance to me. I say.


� We&nbsp; will wait until you are seated properly, to continue our business.�

She looks over at you then at the floor, several minutes pass as she ponders what to do, as I sip my drink, I know the turmoil she must feel as I watch her lift up onto her knees and slide the skirt up to her waist, she opens her thighs and lowers to a kneeling position, placing her hands on her thighs and sitting straight up, I watch the minor competition between you and her as you both sit trying to outdo the other, you raise your skirt til it is bunched at your waist, your bare sex open and exposed to her view, she looks down and then suddenly up, I hear her sigh as she also bunches her skirt around her waist exposing the black panties she has on.

I get up from the desk and walk over to the far wall and open a concealed closet in the wall, I reach in and get the items then walk back to the desk, you both see a box in my right hand and my left hand clutching something hidden from your view. I sit down at my desk, and watch her squirm as I tap the box, then say

�Have you decided who will punish you, the law or me?�

She stammers more excuses, then states that I cannot hold her against her will, then something about blackmail, and I am not leaving her any choices, I watch her look over at you as she stops then starts again, saying how unfair I am, to make her choose. I stroke the box and say.

�Does this belong to you?� 

She looks toward the box then at the floor and says 

�No but�

I say to cut her off.�Then who does it belong to.�

�You but� she says.

�Were you not fairly compensated for the work you did.� I say.

�Yes but� she says.

� You will answer Yes Sir or No Sir to my questions, do you understand?�

�Yes Sir.� She says.

�Were my instructions that this was to be one of a kind, �I say?&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; 

�Yes Sir,� she says as she squirms in her kneeling.

�So you took it upon yourself to break our agreement, �I say.


�Yes Sir,� I see she is visible shaken by her admission as she answers.

�Then you deserve to be punished, who will it be I or the law.�

She squirms around on the floor, then gasps

�You Sir�

I get up and walk over to where you are kneeling and reach down and undo the rest of the buttons on your blouse and pull it from your skirt and to the sides. I throw the gold chain I got from the closet between her legs. I walk back to my desk and sit down and say to her.

�When you are attired as she is we will continue or you may leave the choice is yours, �as I point to you.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; She looks over to where you kneel beside her, your breasts exposed the clamps on your prominent nipples, the gold chain dangling between them, your sex bared and exposed. She turns back to me her eyes pleading, but I just sip my drink. She reaches down and grasps the chain.
Then looks to the door, then back at you. She drops the chain as if it has burnt her hand, then eyes me looking for something, some sign that she can change my mind.

I sit and watch patiently as her inner struggle with the reality of what is occurring, hits home deep within her, she looks to you for some help, anything, but you stay silent, kneeling, looking forward. I watch as she slowly raises to her knees, as she places her hands on her hips, then looks toward the door as if to flee as&nbsp; I say.

�You may leave at anytime.&nbsp; Nothing holds you here.�

She turns back to the desk quickly with my words, as if her thoughts of running out the door, has been known to me, she looks over to you again, then slides her fingers into the waistband of her panties and slowly pulls them down til they are at her knees. She covers her sex with her hand, to shield it from my view. I pay her no mind, as she draws the panties along her legs to her feet with her other hand. She works them off her feet and they lay behind her feet.

She kneels back down her thighs closed tightly together and reaches for the chain then stops and starts to unbutton her suit coat and lets it drop from her shoulders to the floor, then her blouse, her fingers have a hard time with the buttons. Finally she reaches the last button and pulls her blouse from her bunched skirt, she has a bra on, so she reaches behind and undoes the clasp then works the straps down one arm, then the other holding the bra in place.


 I turn to my computer and start to work, she lowers the bra and covers her breasts with her arm and places the bra before her. She reaches out and takes the chain and looks over to you, then takes a clamp and opens it between her fingers. She places the clamp over her swollen nipple and releases the clamp, she groans with the pain as she is inexperienced with clamps, her body moves thru her pain, then it eases and she takes the other clamp opens it and places it over her nipple, this time she eases the clamp closed, the pain is not as severe, as her movements show, as she bites her lip. When the pain has subsided, she lowers her hand from her breasts to her thighs and moves them apart. I get up and walk over to where you kneel and you stand, I walk you to the edge of the desk and say.

�Your clothes are a mess, remove them.�

You disrobe quickly the skirt is unzipped and falls to the floor, and you shed the blouse both fall to the floor. You stand there proudly your arms laced behind your back, legs apart, wearing nothing but your chain and collar. I reach down and cup your sex in my hand, you are moist and yearning as you spread your legs wider. I tell you to go back and kneel again. You do as instructed and soon are kneeling beside her, I look directly at her and say.

�You may stand to finish preparing yourself.�

I watch her get up her legs trembling, as she stands fully upright I move her by her arm to where you stood before. Then release her, her hands try to provide her some inkling of modesty. I stand and wait, as she reaches down and undoes the clasp and zipper to her skirt as she lowers it from her hips it falls to the floor, at her ankles then she sheds the blouse from her shoulders and it falls to land behind her. I walk behind her and clasp her arms in my hand and show her how to intertwine them behind her then release them, she starts to move her hand and I grasp them again holding them in place, I release her arms and she holds them in place. I walk around her til I stand before her, her legs are clasped together and I say.

�Does this excite you?�

She says �No Sir.�

 Reach over to my desk and open a drawer and retrieve a wooden ruler, then I turn to her and show her the ruler, I see her body shudder as she looks upon it in my hand. I walk behind her and gently tap the ruler to her shoulder and slowly move it down her spine when I reach her arms clasped behind her I take them and place them fingers intertwined at the back of her neck. I then work the ruler down until I have reached her right knee. I place the ruler between her legs and tap each legs the taps continue as she spreads her legs to get away from the ruler, at mid thighs I tap harder til her legs are spread shoulder length apart. I tap lightly again up her inner thigh until I am within a hair&#8217;s breathe of her sex, I stop and say.

�The punishment for lying is thirty with this as I hold the ruler before her.�

She says, �Yes Sir,� as she looks at the ruler.&nbsp; 



  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I take the ruler and place it on the desk, and as I look her directly in the eyes, I place my hand on her lower inner thigh and knead the flesh and move to the other thigh and knead it between my fingers, she closes her eyes as I move back to the other thigh and knead slightly higher I continue this working between one thigh then the other ever higher each time until my thumb brushes her sex as I knead her thigh. I stop and say.

� What is the punishment for lying?�

Her eyes fly open as she says weakly, �Thirty with the ruler Sir.�

I place my hand between her legs and grasp her sex, her body betrays her as she moans as my fingers meet her wetness, I say. 

�Did your lie,� to her as I grasp her sex harder between my fingers?

In a gasp she says �Yes Sir&#8217;.&nbsp; . 

I release her sex and show her the wetness on my fingers before I take the ruler from the desk and show it to her as I place it on her breast, she looks shocked as the ruler lays across her breast so close to the clamp on her nipple, as I raise the ruler and say.

�The only thing I wish to hear is you counting the strikes of the ruler against your skin.�

She groans and says �Yes Sir.�

&nbsp; I start at her breasts and work down her body swatting her with the ruler. When I reach her thighs the moans come in between each count as she says �Ten,� and squirms where she stands. 
I stop and place the ruler before her eyes, and say. 

�Was not my instruction&#8217;s clear, you will show respect when counting, now we will have to start over again?�

I place the ruler against her breast and raise and swat it down on her flesh, She groans and squirms, hopping from one leg to the other and says 

�One Sir�

&nbsp; I continue til I have worked mid thighs and she groans.

�Ten Sir�

I stop for two reasons, one to allow her to gain her composure, I have not swatted her hard, but just enough to sting. The second reason is I walk up to where you kneel and reach down and have you stand, We walk past her and to the other side of my desk. I sit in my chair as I do you start to kneel by it, I stop you and pull you into my lap. I take the ruler and place it in your hand. You look at me questioning with your eyes, as you clutch the ruler, take the box and open it saying.

�This was made for only you.&nbsp; This is what she stole.�
 

I see the fury in your eyes, as you look to the box then to the woman, she sees it too. You grasp the box and shaking takes the collar from the box, it was to be one of a kind yours, you had earned it, You look at her as you grasp the ruler harder in your fingers. No one else deserved it was a special gift that no one could hope to earn. You look to me then to the woman as I say.

�She is yours to punish.�
&nbsp; 
The feral groan that escapes your lips as you get off my knee and walk to where she stands, she backs up slightly as you approach you take her by the hair and pull her to the desk, you look to me and I grasp her hair so she is across the desk, We hear her say.

�Please Sir.�

I grasp her harder and watch as you move behind her and the first blow hits her thigh, as I say.

�It was not I you stole from, it was she�

Needless to say it did not stop at twenty but more like forty swats, your exertions had your skin glistening with your efforts. Soon you calmed down the only sounds from her were moans as I released her hair, and she slid from the desk to the floor, You reach down and rip the clamps from her breasts, she lays curled in a fetal position on the floor as I say to her. 

�You may leave now.&nbsp; Your punishment is over.�

You drop the ruler and come over to me and sit in my lap, you take the box and just stare at its contents and say 

�Thank You Master.�

I look down at her as she struggles to regain her composure, rising from the floor and say.

�You have thirty minutes to vacate our&nbsp; home, or she will punish you again.�


I hear her groan as she moves toward her clothes on the floor, each movement painful, there will be no aftercare for her. She starts to rise to her feet with her things and I hear you say.

�If you stand, I will beat you again� as you glare at her. 
 
All I say is.

�What&#8217;s for dinner � 

The glare leaves your face as you take your box and slide to the floor, and kneel proudly, the box between your thighs, and say

�Whatever you desire Master,� as the woman squirms on the floor putting her clothes back on.
