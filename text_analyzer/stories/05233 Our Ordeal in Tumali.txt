Prologue

�You really are a cunning, conniving and
unscrupulous bastard Ted Sullivan, I�m glad that I�m a civil servant at the
Foreign Office and not a reporter on your staff. How could you be so cruel as
to send two innocent young people to a country in the middle of nowhere knowing
they will be raped and tortured? Sacrificing them to the god of money. �
Despite the words, there was a smile on Peter Spencer�s face.

�They will neither be raped nor tortured
in my country,� Colonel Nubaro replied with mock outrage, �There is no such
thing as rape for people of their age in Tumali; all women when they get to
child bearing age are available for insemination by any male. And we do not
torture people. We use corporal punishments, that is true. Wrongdoers get
chastised with a strap or cane or even the whip where appropriate to their
crime but we do not consider that torture. It is a far better system than
incarcerating them in prisons for long periods. And more economic too.�

�From what I�ve heard Colonel, the
chastisements are pretty severe by our standards and are carried out in public
with the victims stripped naked.�

�I cannot help it if the standards in
this country are low Peter and we believe that everyone should see that justice
has been carried out and the criminal does not have any hidden protection under
his or her garments. The people of Tumali accept that and it certainly helps to
keep our crime rate down. Besides, it is part of our culture, our heritage and
our beliefs; almost a religion. Do you really think they will fall for this
false document giving them diplomatic immunity Ted?�

�They�re both shy and pretty na�ve, the
boy especially so, and I suspect they�re both virgins Colonel��

�They certainly won�t be when they return
and, unless there is something wrong with her internals, the girl will be
pregnant,� the Colonel interrupted and all three men laughed.

�The trip might help their careers too,�
Ted went on, �They are excellent writers, which from their college records is
why I took them on, but they don�t have the get-up-and-go that a reporter needs
to winkle out information. Roger particularly wants things handed to him on a plate
and someone to wipe his nose. He�s great at manipulating images on the computer
so much of the time, I have him doing the artwork for the magazines. She�s a
little better and is generally the leader of the pair but is still rather shy.
They�ve produced some great stories but not when they�ve had to do interviews
or investigations. My guess is that they will be very reluctant to go but I
will hint that their jobs are on the line so even if they are unsure about the
document, they�ll go.�

For a while longer the men sat around a
table at the exclusive London club where Peter Spencer was a member. �Well it
looks like you two get more out of it than I will,� Peter remarked. �Ted gets
an inside story exclusive for Today�s World that could run for several months
and he�ll make a packet using the material on the underground DVD�s he
produces, you Colonel get the publicity that should attract the kind of white
girls you�d like to breed for the light coloured babies that you sell but I
just get to have a few girls when I negotiate their release.�

�But the negotiations could be
protracted,� laughed the Colonel, �And I�ll try and arrange for you to have
young ones that are just coming to breeding age and are not already pregnant.�

&nbsp;

Chapter one. Elaine

�Will Roger and Elaine come into my
office straightaway please.� We both looked at each other when the announcement
came over the Tannoy but stopped what we were doing. Roger shrugged his
shoulders as if to ask what was up and I guess most of the others in the
offices wondered too because they looked questioningly at us as we walked by
their desks.

�What do you know about Tumali?� Ted
asked when we stood nervously in front of his desk.

�Not a lot Chief,� Roger admitted, �Small
country in central Africa.�

�It�s not really a country in its own
right and yet they claim it is. It is more like a self governing state or
enclave within Malawi, if I remember correctly sir,� I said. He nodded and I
went on, �I don�t really know much either sir, but I believe a tribe took over
an area of what was then Nyasaland when it was part of our empire and declared
independence long before Malawi itself became independent. Because of the
mountainous terrain and its remoteness we were never able to oust them and
eventually more or less left them alone. I think there is a degree of
cooperation between Malawi and Tumali now and a general agreement to respect
the Tumali borders. A General ran the country for some years but he died and
now his son has taken over. Most other countries don�t recognise them and I
believe there are human rights issues but as I said sir, I know little enough
about the place.�

�That�s a start anyway. Stop whatever
else you are working on, and see what other information you can find on the
country, its people, culture and stuff like that. Find out also how you can get
there, flight times etc and what you will need in the way of jabs and medicals
etc. Report back to me after lunch.�

�Are you going to be sending us there
Chief?� Roger asked. I could hear the quaver in his voice and I too had a nasty
feeling we were going to be sent there.

�We�ll see,� our editor replied
noncommittally, �Get the information and report back this afternoon. Now git.�

As our research progressed, Roger and I
became more and more apprehensive of going there, me particularly and over
lunch we discussed whether or not we should refuse to go if the assignment was
offered to us. �At this stage in our careers Elaine, I don�t think we dare
refuse,� Roger pointed out, �Not unless we plan to become novelists instead of
journalists.� I knew he was right. It was a major assignment and if we turned
it down, it would be most unlikely we�d ever advance our work and our job on
Today�s World might be terminated. Both of us had flats we needed to pay rent on
and other credit commitments that required regular payments.

At three that afternoon we printed our
report and Roger handed it to me to present to Ted. I knew he was more nervous
about such things than even I was and I guessed I would be the one fielding the
questions.

�Sit down please,� Ted invited and I knew
then we were in for a long session and my suspicion was confirmed when he told
the switchboard to hold all calls for him. �Well Elaine?� I tried to hand him
the report but he just said, �Give me the main points for now. I�ll read it
later.�

Tumali is a small country in the
northernmost part of Malawi. Most maps do not actually show it because
officially it is part of Malawi. It is roughly circular in shape about 30 miles
in diameter but the boundaries are irregular and convoluted to conform to the
mountains. It is surrounded on all sides by steep cliffs and impenetrable rain
forest, which is why it has been able to keep its independence. There is a
small airfield and fairly regular flights from Lilongwe, the capital of Malawi.
Some goods come in by steamer along Lake Nyasa and up the Songwe River and are
taken by cable car from the dock to a small station at the top and then by road
to Chapoti which is the main town in Tumali.�

�Okay, that the travel guide bit, what
about the people?�

�It�s a very feudal system sir, with
General Cumu as the head of state with supreme powers. The people are more like
serfs especially the women.� I blushed at this point and looked down at my
notes. �The women or more or less baby producers sir and see it as their duty
to keep themselves pregnant.� I paused and read from my report, �Ten days after
having her third menstrual period, the belt she wears to indicate that she is
not ready for breeding is removed and she is taken to a communal area where she
selects several men who impregnate her one after the other. In the following
days any men who desire to do so may continue to impregnate her when work and
other duties allow. No girls are allowed to refuse and indeed, if the web site
is to be believed, it seems that they want it and continue to have sex with
many men even when well pregnant. The babies are sold sir! Would you believe
that is their main export! I don�t think I would wish to be part of that
society sir.� 

I must have looked very flushed because
he turned to Roger. �Did you find out about travel arrangements and medicals?�

�Yes Chief,� he answered, �We have to
have a full medical certificate and blood tests for AIDS and STD�s as well as a
visa to permit entry. For obvious reasons they don�t allow anyone into the
country who is not medically clean. Very few visa�s are ever issued so there�s
no tourist trade.� We�d both hoped that a visa would be denied to us if we were
asked to go.

�Have you passports?� We�d both been on a
college trip to France so I nodded. �Book yourselves into a private clinic for
the tests and get them done as soon as possible. My guess it will take a week
for the results to come through and as soon as you can, book flights to Tumali.
I had lunch with Colonel Nubaro at the weekend and already have visas for you
and a special document that gives you a sort of diplomatic immunity. Colonel
Nubaro is deputy to General Cumu who, as you now know, is head of Tumali. The
Colonel is over here to try and obtain some aid and get diplomatic recognition
for Tumali but he doesn�t seem to have been successful in either respect.�

�Do�do we really have to go sir?� I
stuttered.

�No of course not but I would have
thought it could be a good start to your careers. You are only going to have to
stay there for a couple of weeks or so and report on what you see. Roger will
be with you. I wouldn�t send a girl alone to a place like that but I did want
someone who could write about it from a feminine point of view. Colonel Nubaro
told me much of what you found out at lunch, and when I expressed fears about
your safety, he gave me the certificate.�

We had several more briefings with our
editor. �Talk to the girls and find out what they feel about being sexually
subservient to men, find out what they feel when they have to give up their
babies, find out who buys them. Roger you will do the same from a man�s point
of view. Fortunately english has been the common language for all the tribes in
the area since colonial times and almost everyone speaks it or a version that
you should understand.

The clinic tests were straightforward and
the female doctor when we went for the results and certificates, suggested that
I start taking a contraceptive pill. �You never know what might happen when you
get there and seeing all the barely clad women might raise your colleague�s
hormones to a level he won�t be able to resist you,� she told me.

I was not overly concerned that Roger
might become aroused and try to rape me particularly as there had been very
little indication so far that he was even interested in me that way. We�d been
in the same class at college and we�d worked together for the last eight months
but never had he asked me out on a date. Several times I thought he might ask,
but each time he clammed up. Often at night I wondered what it would be like to
have him in bed with me but both of us were too shy to broach the subject or
even hint at it. To my mind it was more probable that it would be the natives
that did the raping even if we did have diplomatic immunity.

&nbsp;

Chapter two. Arrested

Two days later we flew London to
Amsterdam and on to Lilongwe where we boarded a forty-seat Tumali Airways plane
to Chapoti. Although the plane was full, only four other women were on the
flight, all of African origin. I was very nervous but if anything Roger was
more so. We held hands; that was almost a first for us. Although we�d been
though college together, neither of us went out much or attended parties, so we
didn�t really get to know each other until graduation and we both had honours
degrees. It came as a great surprise when we met again at the interviews for
jobs on Today�s World and as newbies on the staff we were together quite a lot.
I quite liked him but he always seemed very insecure and wanting to be
mothered. We were both teased over our relationship but it didn�t make any
difference. Now we were being thrown together in a country where intimate
sexual relationships were the norm and I constantly wondered if that would
change our association with each other.

�We are now crossing into Tumali
airspace, please fasten your seat belts.� The pilot�s voice came over the
loudspeaker.

The Tumalian stewardess came to me and I
was shocked to notice that her blouse was completely undone and her breasts were
in full view. Roger� eyes popped wide open. �Ma�am,� she said quietly, �Women
in this country are expected to show their breasts at all times. May I suggest
that it would be wise for you do so now, before we enter the terminal
building?� This was something I�d seen on the web site but deemed that surely
could only apply to native women, not white guests invited into their country.
Invited, so I�d been told, by the country�s second in command.

I turned and noticed that the other women
had opened their blouses and some sort of cup on the underside supported their
breasts and thrust them forward. They seemed proud of them or perhaps it was
the sapphire coloured broach that nestled just above their cleavage they wanted
to show. I decided, I just couldn�t bare mine. �No,� I replied as forcefully as
I could, �We are visitors and I have diplomatic immunity from Colonel Nubaro.�

A look of disbelief crossed stewardess�
face. �If you say so ma�am. On your head be it but I would strongly advise you
to conform to our rules. It can be painful if you don�t.� Deliberately I
crossed my arms over my chest and she went away. We knew from our researches
that Tumali women went around like the native Africans of former days as a
protest against the white colonialists and missionaries, but I was certain that
it shouldn�t apply to me especially as I had Colonel Nubaro�s indemnity
document.

While we waited in a small room for our
bags to be hand delivered to us from the plane I took the opportunity to look
around at the others in the terminal building. Every female did indeed have
their breasts exposed, even those too old to have more than sagging sacks.
Others looked at us. We were definitely the centre of attention but I put that
down to our being white and foreigners and I gathered from the staff at
Lilongwe that foreigners travelling to Tumali were a rare commodity. No doubt
too, my very fair skin and long blonde hair made me even more conspicuous.

The first hint of trouble came when we
presented our documents to a uniformed official. First he didn�t like the fact
that I went first, then when he�d examined Roger� papers said loudly, �Woman
you are in Tumali now, bare your tits!� All eyes turned on me as I tried to
explain that I had diplomatic immunity. He threw the paper back at me. �There
is no such thing as diplomatic immunity here, we only have diplomatic relations
with North Korea. Colonel Nubaro doesn�t involve himself in such things, the
document it a fake that you have concocted. You obey our laws or suffer the
consequences.� At this point surprisingly Roger tried to come to my aid but the
disturbance brought a senior officer to us and after a few cursory questions
called to four nearby guards to arrest us.

By this time I was very angry as well as
nervous and protested loudly. The man took it calmly and smiling through
gleaming white teeth ordered, �Guards, strip them both and take them to the
punishment area. We cannot have the British thinking they can do what they like
with us again.� I struggled and Roger protested but, outnumbered by powerful
men, soon we both stood naked and cuffed in front of all the people in the
concourse. I blushed the deepest red from the utter humiliation and I think it
was almost matched by Roger�s colour. It was the first time we�d seen each
other naked and the first time I�d had even a hint of what his prick looked
like.

By this time I�d given up complaining and
through my sobs started pleading but was curtly told to �Shut up and sit down.�
We sat on what we knew from its sturdiness and the straps was the punishment
bench while the officer opened our cases and bags and in front of everyone
examined their contents. All my bras and knickers were confiscated, as were
Roger� underpants. �These are illegal items and must not be worn here.� Turning
to a girl cleaner standing watching, he ordered, �Lift your skirt Malu.� She
did so immediately and lifted her skirt as high as it would go and proudly
showed her bare pubis and her obviously well pregnant stomach.

A cry from one of the guards searching my
hand luggage gave a shout, �Look what I�ve found sir.� He held up my pack of
contraceptive pills.

�Illegal drugs. Didn�t they tell you that
no form of contraception is allowed here? Didn�t you read the forms you signed
to get your visa?� Again I tried to explain about the immunity and he fact the
visas had been granted without us having to apply for them, but no one took any
notice. By now I was crying and desperately wanting to be home again but I
couldn�t see that happening unless this Colonel Nubaro came by personally. �You
will have to go court and be tried for this offence. That�s probably a whipping
offence and I don�t have enough authority for that.�

�Whipping offence? Birth control pills a
whipping offence?� Our researches had found pictures of whipping posts and of
people being punished on the Tumali web site but they were all small jpg�s that
didn�t show much detail. I almost passed out at the thought and then wondered
if the court would take notice of the certificate that now seemed so worthless.

�And I�ve found these in his luggage,�
another guard shouted. To my surprise he held up a pack of Mates.

Never would I have believed that Roger
would have the nerve to buy condoms but with whom did he expect to use them?
Me? The natives? Must be me, from our researches we knew Tumalian women wanted
to be pregnant. I guessed we would be in real trouble now. Roger just tried to
hide his face in shame. 

�More for the court to deal with,� the
officer went on and again turned his attention to m. �However, I can deal
directly with the other offences; the bringing in of banned items of clothing,
refusal to bare your tits; causing disruption to our services and then showing
us a fraudulent document. As it is your first time and possibly can claim
partial ignorance of our ways, I�ll be lenient and sentence you, Elaine Eves to
just twelve strokes of the strap. It is with some regret that I will not be
allowed to fuck you afterwards. Someone high up has forbidden it until the
court decides whether that is allowed.�

�NO! No Noooo!� I protested. Roger tried
to intervene too but the clapping and laughter from the crowd drowned what he
said. In any case he had his own fate to worry about.

�Roger Hart, you too tried to smuggle in
banned items of clothing and contraceptives but worse than that, you failed to
control the woman you brought with you. You allowed her to disregard our laws
and traditions. Therefore I sentence you to the same punishment. This punishment
will be carried out immediately in front of the witnesses here and afterwards
you will be chained together and taken to a holding cell until such time as a
court can be convened to try you for the drug smuggling and contraceptive
offences. Fasten him and bring me the strap.�

My body started to sag into the arms of
the guards holding me as I watched Roger, crying pitifully, being manhandled
into place and fastened securely to the bench. For the moment I was more
concerned with our expected punishment than the guard squeezing my breasts but
there seemed nothing I could do to prevent either. A girl arrived with the
strap, smiled and handed it to the officer. �My God, that will kill us!� I
screamed at the sight of the broad strip of leather but that only caused the
crowd to erupt in more laughter but I was passed caring.

The officer turned to me and with a huge
smile showed it to my face. �Lovely isn�t it? Thick but well oiled and supple,
just the thing to teach you British people how to behave. It will be a delight
to make you really squeal but in this country men take priority, even a gutless
one like the wailing specimen ready for it down there.�

Through tear filled eyes I saw his arm
lift and then the blur as the dreadful belt descended across poor Roger�s buttocks.
I heard him yell but it was almost drowned by the laughter and clapping from
the crowd. Again it rose and fell, again with the same accompaniment. Roger�s
screams suddenly ceased and his body went limp. He�d passed out after only two
strokes. Jeers followed as he was brought round and the punishment continued
but thrice more it had to be stopped while he was revived. Even through the
dread of knowing it was soon to be my turn, I felt a bit sorry for Roger when
the crowd hissed and booed at his poor showing. 

My mind reeled at the horror of it all
and my body started to fade away too just from the sight of Roger�s bottom but
strong arms gripped me under the armpits until it was my turn on the dreaded
bench. They may not have been allowed to have sex with me but they certainly
felt my opening and mauled my breasts as they fastened me down but I could do
nothing to stop them. Out of the corner of my eye as I pulled against my bonds,
I noticed Roger, crying like a baby, was being held where he could watch. Then
I heard the swish and felt the tremendous pain and the fire that flashed
through my body to my poor brain. I yelled just as loudly as Roger had done and
like him, it was greeted with applause from the onlookers.

Crack! The belt landed a second and a third
time and each time the pain seemed greater. I didn�t believe that I could take
twelve like that but I did so without passing out. Vaguely I remember being
lifted to my feet to more applause but it was a little while before I could
stand and then we were taken to a small office the officer produced a pair of
plastic cuffs connected by about two feet of chain. One cuff was fastened to my
right wrist and the other to Roger�s left. 

A girl brought our shoes and put them on
for us but we were not given any of our other clothing. �Take them to the
holding cells,� the officer ordered, �But keep your pricks in your trousers.
For some reason, a higher authority has forbidden it and in any case you are on
duty. Maybe they want first chance. Ours is not to question why.�

Slowly and painfully we trudged along a
stony track for what seemed like a mile but was really only half that distance,
to what we assumed was the prison block. The guards were in no hurry and
fortunately the sun was partially obscured by clouds due to the time of year
and especially because of the altitude so we didn�t have to worry about
sunburn; it was more the stares and jibes from people who we passed. Few would
have seen a white person before and certainly not a naked couple chained and
stumbling along with their backsides looking horribly red and sore. I tried to
hold my head up but it was difficult to keep up the pose of being proud and
British. Somewhere along the way, my hand felt Roger�s and it seemed easier to
walk like that rather than keep pulling on our connecting chain. Neither of us
talked much but every so often when we stumbled or the pain just seemed to be
too severe, we let out a cry. Even at that time Roger seemed more of a baby
than I was and moaned and cried for much of the way. Eventually we came to a
walled compound and were let in through a heavy wooden gate.

&nbsp;

Chapter three. In prison

�What is going to happen to us?� I asked
the elderly officer with sergeant stripes at the desk. Roger still wept
bitterly and had an arm around me for support so I knew I would have to be the
one to ask. He looked me up and down in a leering way and halting his gaze at
my blonde pubic hair for what seemed an age, causing me more embarrassment, and
wrote our names in a book then sifted through a pile of papers and read a sheet
of an email. �You�re to be kept chained together and no one is to fuck you
until you�ve been interviewed.� He stared at my mound again and I tried to
cover it with my free hand but one of the men who�d brought us, pulled it away.
�Pity,� the desk sergeant commented, �I would have liked to have seen if a
white cunt was any different to a black one and that wimp boy of yours doesn�t
look as if he has enough meat to satisfy a woman.� 

Roger gave an embarrassed cry and he too
blushed. His penis was the only one I�d seen and it looked big enough to me.
�Who is going to interview us and when?� I asked hoping it would be someone
like Colonel Nubaro who could sort this whole mess out and let us go. 

�Don�t know lady. Could be tomorrow,
could be the day after because tomorrow�s a holiday. Could be one of the top
men but it doesn�t say. The email came from the government office though. Read
it.� 

He tossed the paper to me. It told me no
more than he had until I noticed that it was timed some three hours or so
earlier. We�d been in the air on our way from Lilongwe then. �This must all
have been planned in advance,� I thought and passed the sheet to Roger who only
glanced at it and handed it back to the sergeant.

�Cell five.� A warder took us through two
sets of locked doors to a row of iron-barred cells that looked as if they�d
seen service in a B western movie. I quickly noticed that only the back wall
was solid and all the separating walls were open bars; we could see the other
inmates and they could see us. We would have no privacy at all.

�Make yourselves at home,� the warder
grinned and gave my tender bottom what he deemed a gentle pat but which made me
squeal again. The door slammed shut and I heard the key turn noisily in the
lock. It was all too much. I wept. Roger put his arms around me but they were
of little comfort, he was crying too and the way he held me meant his face was
in my breasts and it was more a case of me comforting him. We sat gingerly on
the hard bed despairing of ever getting out.

�No need to cry Missie, I�ve something
here that will cheer you up.� I turned and saw a local man kneeling on the bed
in the next cell with his prick out and offering it to me through the bars. It
was fully hard and much larger than Roger�s. I turned away, horrified. �You
won�t be so choosy tomorrow Missie, not after you�ve been fucked a dozen or
more times. When they unlock the cell doors, you�ll have to submit yourself to
us. That�s the law. Mummy�s boy there won�t protect you and that tiny worm of
his won�t give you much satisfaction. No doubt you�re here for a good whipping
too and then the screws will make good use of your cunt. Afterwards, if they
haven�t thrown me out, Sumala here will then get a turn at you. � 

Roger�s wailing increased and I joined in
for a while but gradually all my tears dried up and I started to take in my
surroundings. Like a baby at his mother�s breast, Roger had wormed his way
inside my arms and was sobbing and I could feel the wetness dribbling down my
cleavage. At that point I thought that he might even attempt to suck my
nipples, but he made no attempt to do so. Looking down at him, I realised what
the man in the next room said, wasn�t too far off the truth. Roger was a big
baby and if there was to be a way out of our situation, I would be the one to
find it. He would follow and pretend to help, much as he had always done in the
office although never before had we been in situations as dire as this. Whether
it was my closeness or some smell from my breasts, or for some reason I didn�t
understand, Roger had an erection. It was indeed smaller than the one next door
but, because it was Roger�s, it seemed to disgust me more. �He should be able
to control himself,� I reasoned, �Whereas you can�t expect that from natives
who are used to getting their wicked way with women.� My experience with men at
that time was such that I argued, �He�s the one still crying and yet I am the
one who is going to be raped. They can�t rape him.� Despite all my mental
arguments against it, I did find myself becoming a little wet between my legs.
I partly blamed the warmth from my strapped bottom but I guess the sight of the
black prick added to the feeling.

Pushing Roger away, I looked around and
tried to assess our situation. The cell was about ten feet square with a
stainless steel washbasin, mirror and toilet at one end, all completely open
and on view to everyone, and a single bed along one of the open barred walls.
No sheets, but one end of the mattress was padded and raised to serve as a
bolster type of pillow. No privacy whatsoever, even when we washed or used the
toilet. Each cell was a mirror image of its neighbour so next door�s bed,
Sumala�s bed, was right alongside ours. Fortunately the way we were chained
together meant that Roger would be next to the bars and from the narrowness of
the bed, he would be tight up against them. 

The sight of the toilet reminded me that
I needed to use it but yet I didn�t want Sumala to see me. I didn�t want Roger
to either but there was no getting away from that and I knew he would be in he
same situation and I could ask him to look the other way. I wondered, �How long
they will they keep us chained together? Until after the court appearance?
Longer? Will they allow us to phone the office? Will Colonel Nubaro intervene?�
Too many questions without any answers yet.

The two cells the other side of us were
vacant so I quietly asked to Roger to shield me from the man�s stares while I
peed and he did so.� I tried to do it
quietly but the stainless steel pan magnified the sound but when I glanced
around Roger, Sumala wasn�t watching. That was a small blessing. We washed our
faces and dried them with one of the few paper towels supplied and I reused
mine by soaking it with water and applying it to my tender behind.

Sumala laughed loudly when he saw this.
�What they did to you was nothing but a little tickle. You just wait until
you�re taken to the market place and caned or whipped. Wait until you�ve felt
the whip bite into your arse or tits.� His face clouded up and his arrogance
disappeared, �You�ll see when they bring Velisi back shortly. She�s getting
twenty with the cane for stealing. They�ll take me then. I�ve got forty with
the whip.� His voice almost sounded like he was bragging at first and then it
broke when he imagined the suffering it would cause him. �Drunk on illegal
booze and resisting arrest� punched a guard�not the first time.� He turned away
and for a little while sat with his back to us.

We lay down on the bunk, not talking but
each thinking what was likely to happen to us in that barbaric country. How
cruel would they be to foreigners? Was there still hatred of the British from
colonial times like the officer at the airport indicated? My mind kept churning
over the fact that the guards had been ordered not to have sex with us before
we�d even arrived. Even the officer who thrashed us knew and we�d hardly
entered the country. Someone had to have planned this in advance. My mind
narrowed the possibilities down to Colonel Nubaro who signed our false
diplomatic immunity certificate or our boss, Ted, who was so keen to send us
rather than one of the more experienced males on the staff.

�Tell your woman to back her arse against
the bars. She�ll have to do it if you tell her and then I can have a nice fuck
before they take me away.� Sumala again thrust his prick through the bars but
this time it was close to Roger�s face. He shook his head, turned away and
pressed closer to me. �So you�re a white girlie-boy,� Sumala taunted him, �When
they find that out, they�ll put you in the Mummy�s Boy camp with the other
girlie boys and you�ll get used like a woman. The General doesn�t allow them to
breed with real women. You like cocks up your arse girlie-boy? You�d get plenty
of them in the camp whether you want it or not.� I felt Roger�s prick stiffen
against my thigh and wondered if he was actually gay.

�You keep your prick in your shorts
Sumala. No one�s allowed to fuck her for the time being. Orders from Government
office,� One of the warders shouted through the bars.� Again I wondered about this but a commotion
outside and the wailing of a woman interrupted any further thoughts on this.
Velisi had returned.

The poor girl was half carried into the
cell and I could see the raised ridges of her badly welted back and bottom.
Sumala was right, by comparison our punishments were quite minor and once more
I was overcome and started sobbing at the thought that by this time tomorrow, my
bottom might be as painful as hers, if not worse. Was smuggling contraceptives
considered a more heinous crime here than stealing? Nothing in our researches
had indicated how penalties were determined.

The guards laid the wailing woman face
down on the bed and a girl in nurse�s uniform entered pushing a medical trolley
ahead of her. With a morbid fascination, I felt compelled to watch. �They
wouldn�t allow a uniform like that in St Thomas�s,� I mused. Like all other
women here, her blouse went round the outside of her full breasts and was
slightly cup shaped on the underside to support them. Her skirt was short and
when she bent down, I could see she wore nothing underneath. Roger must have
seen it too because his eyes were wide open and his prick stiffened. I wondered
if he would rape me later or if I would be able to control him and his urges.
Did the government ruling apply to him?

�I�ll leave the door unlocked until you
leave nurse. She�s not going to run away.� The warder remarked as the guards
filed out. One put his hand between the nurse�s legs but she only smiled and
said, �I�m at work. You know where to find me later.�

Our attention was momentarily distracted
from the scene by a minor struggle as the guards handcuffed Sumala and led him
away. My attention returned to the nurse. �Lie still a moment Velisi, I�ll give
you an injection that will ease the pain and make you sleepy. You�ll miss a
meal but I don�t expect you�ll feel like eating and the food�s not all that
great anyway.� The nurse appeared to my inexperienced eye, to be very efficient
and quickly administered the injection. Almost immediately the girl quietened
down and the nurse began cleaning and putting a salve on her bottom. Several
times she stopped and listened to the girl�s heart but each time she appeared
satisfied and carried on. I had the impression that she had done this many
times before and being a prison nurse, I guess she had. Roger looked pale and
very sick and I felt my stomach churning but I watched and debated whether we
would be punished in like manner.

�I�ll check on you in a minute,� she
remarked when she noticed me staring. �I�ll need to get your notes first.� Some
ten minutes later the warder let her into our cell and she introduced herself
as Nurse Muniba. Velisi lay quietly on her bed, just giving a small cry every
now and then. 

&nbsp;

Chapter four. Sexually examined

No doubt protocol dictated it, but she
examined Roger first. He, of course, was highly embarrassed when first of all
she prodded the muscles of his tender backside and then pushed his reddened
cheeks apart to look at his bottom hole. �Nothing to worry about there,� she
commented, � Minor bruising and soreness but that will soon go. No need for any
treatment.� Obviously, what to us was a major thrashing, on her scale of things
it was only a trivial punishment. Compared to Velisi�s, I suppose it was. 

Deftly she flipped him over and because
of the chain I had to move too. His erection stood straight up from his body
and when he tried to cover it with his free hand, Nurse Muniba ordered me to
hold the hand well above his head. From this position I had a good view when
she cupped his testicles, gently squeezed and seemed to weigh them. A frown
crossed her face but she didn�t say anything. I told myself that I shouldn�t watch
but did so anyway. �Better that you know what you may have to deal with in the
next few days? Weeks? Months? Or longer?� I argued in my mind. Hardly had Nurse
Muniba started examining his prick when it erupted and spewed out a quantity of
sperm.

Muniba collected a drop into a vial and
commented, �Well at least it works. In a moment I�ll nip to the office and
check whether there are living sperm in it. Would you like to lick him clean?�
Horrified, I turned my head. �Oh well, you white girls! I�ll do it this time
but you�ll have to do it in future and for any other men who ejaculate in your
presence.� The thought disgusted me but she unconcernedly took Rogers member in
her mouth and sucked it clean and then licked the remaining sperm from his body
and her fingers. �I�ll be back in a few minutes,� she told the warder who I�d
forgotten was watching us.

Neither Roger nor I felt like commenting
on what had happened in front of the man watching us. I knew Roger had been
utterly humiliated and I wondered how far the nurse would go with me. Seeing
her handle his prick and then suck his sperm, had an unwanted side effect on me
too; I was wet between my legs.

Ten minutes later, the nurse returned.
�All�s well,� she informed us, �Plenty of living sperm so he should be able to
fertilise you. It doesn�t actually say in the notes that he mustn�t fuck you
now, in fact it specifies that no Tumalians must do so. Has he fucked you
already?� I shook my head and murmured, no. �You�re still a virgin?� Her voice
showed its incredulity, �Lie on the bed and let�s find out.�

�No!� I yelled, �Not in front of
everyone.�

�You need another hand?� The warder
leered at me. 

�No!� I yelled again.

To my horror the nurse replied, �Yes,
Zulam, that would be a help. This is the first white girl we�ve had while I�ve
been here and I�ve heard they can be a bit uppity. Hold her ankles so she�s
wide open for me and then I can examine her cunt properly.� My protestations
were to no avail, Zulam positioned himself at my head and pulled my ankles back
to his shoulders. I was helpless and my most private parts were obscenely on
display. Roger would see them and perhaps get ideas about having sex with me.
Worse. Zulam�s erection protruded from the leg of his shorts right alongside my
face and I could not only see it, I could smell it as well. Nurse Muniba
laughed when she saw me close my eyes. �Perhaps we�ll let her suck it for you
later. Better still, she can suck it now. It will keep her quiet while I feel
inside her. Perhaps she�ll like a black prick better than her boyfriend�s white
one.�

�No, please no,� I pleaded. �Roger don�t
let them do it to me, please.� One glance at Roger and I knew he would be of
little help. He was cowering away from the muscular warder.

�Open up!� The nurse�s fingers pinched my
nostrils and when I obstinately kept my mouth closed she twisted my left nipple
with her other hand. As soon as I cried out, so Zulam�s prick went in and with
my head against the bolster, I couldn�t pull away. 

�Don�t try and bite Missie,� he warned,
�Biting a man�s prick is an automatic tit caning offence.� He did pull out a
little and then began short in and out movements with his loins. 

�How long will this go on? How long
before he shoots his stuff into my mouth? What will it taste like? Muniba didn�t
mind when she tasted Roger�s. His was a white man�s sperm though. Will a black
man�s taste different?� Out of the corner of my eye I saw him but he just
looked on in his helpless way and I began to wonder what I ever liked about
him.

�Have you had a good look at her cunt
Roger?� Further embarrassment. Muniba�s fingers probed my opening.

�No�no,� he stuttered. He was embarrassed
and fascinated at the same time. I rightly assumed he�d never seen a woman�s
private parts before.

�Well take a good look now. Better still
get hold of her labial lips and pull them wide apart so that I can see inside.�
I could have died when he fumbled and tried to follow Muniba�s instructions.
�Well she�s definitely a virgin,� she announced. �That�s so unusual in this
country. Most girls have birthed half a dozen babies by the time they reach her
age. Have a good look Zulam, I doubt you�ll ever see another white virgin cunt
in your lifetime.� With his prick stuffed in my mouth and the leg of his shorts
partly covering my face, I couldn�t see his reaction but I felt him lean over
to get a better look. �Do you know about a girls clit, Roger?� Muniba asked. I
didn�t hear a reply but she went on, �That�s a girl�s pleasure centre. See how
it stands out at the moment? That�s because she is sexually aroused and like
your prick gets hard, so does a girl�s clit although it is not so obvious.� She
went on the show him how a girl likes to be masturbated using me as an example
and then I felt his fingers doing it to me. I wanted to fall through the floor
and disappear.

�I�ll murder him!� I vowed but my
attention was taken by Zulam�s more vigorous thrusts in my mouth followed by
the rather odd taste of his sperm as it flooded into my throat. Muniba must
have finished her so-called examination because he let go of my ankles and held
my head on his prick.

�Use your tongue to clean me Missie and
make sure you swallow all the spunk. You are not allowed to spit it out. Not
unless you wish to have your arse warmed again.� Knowing I had no choice, I did
as I was told but I soon realised that the thought of what I was doing repulsed
me more than the actual taste.

�Turn over,� the nurse ordered and when I
lay face down she prodded my buttocks and anal opening. �Looks as if they
strapped you much harder than him,� she commented and wrote something in her
notes. She did put a little cream on my arse but not Roger�s and she only
laughed when he pleaded with her. �You don�t need it, you�ve only a few marks
and they�ll soon go.� Before she left, Muniba had a few words with us. I�d
asked what was likely to happen to us. �I don�t really know Elaine. Very few
white people visit Tumali and those that do are nearly always businessmen so we
don�t see them in this prison. Someone in high authority must have wanted you
to come here��

�Colonel Nubaro?�

�Maybe,� she went on, �I�m only a nurse.
This is only a holding prison and what usually happens is criminals are brought
here and on the same day or the next they are taken to the court and sentenced.
Depending on the time, they are punished that day and returned here. I treat
them and, unless there is some infection, they are released the following day.
We don�t keep prisoners here for long terms. In fact we have very few prisoners
in our long-term camp. If you were Tumalians, I would expect you to be taken
before the court in the morning but, as it is a holiday, that might be
postponed until the following day. You would then be taken to the market square
for punishment and brought back and released the next day. Just the same as
Vilisi. However, as you don�t have a home here or anything and there are no
hotels I�ve no idea what will happen.�

�We were supposed to have been met at the
airport and taken to someone�s home for our stay but we weren�t told who that
would be.� I paused and Muniba started collecting her stuff, �I think we are
just pawns in some game and all this was planned before we left England.� 

�You may well be right, but I can tell
you, that I am not one of the players. One thing is certain though. Sooner or
later you will be fucked and bred by the men here, so you might wish to
consider Roger as your partner first. It might be better for you to have a
white baby. How many pills did you take?� 

�Only two,�

�Then I expect you�ll still be fertile.
Think about it.�

Fortunately a simple meal arrived soon
after they left and I used the water that was with it to wash the taste of
Zulam�s sperm from my mouth although truth to tell there was very little taste
to the stuff. I guess it was more in my imagination.

Roger tried to apologise to me several
times but I refused to acknowledge him and resolutely faced away while we ate
our food. That was difficult because the length of chain was insufficient for
us to eat independently without being close but I made certain that it was him
that had to move. While I ate I again pondered on the fact that my notes said
no Tumalians were to fuck me. Another indication that this was all preplanned.

We�d hardly finished our meal when they
carried Sumala into his cell on a stretcher, his back and buttocks welted and
bleeding in places. He cried out loudly in his pain and we were appalled by the
harsh punishment he�d had. Worse, we wondered if we would be whipped too. Nurse
Muniba arrived quickly and calmed him with an injection. She didn�t say
anything to us while she did her best to treat the suffering man.

�Do� you� think� we�ll� be� whipped� like
that?� Roger broke the silence between us. Tears were again running down his
face. I tried to hold mine back just to show my superiority but it was a
difficult task.

�I don�t think so,� I answered carefully,
�I would guess the players in the game have other plans for us that won�t
involve the mutilation of our bodies. They would not have gone to all the
trouble and expense of getting us here unless they plan to use us in other ways
but I have no idea how.� My mind added, �I wouldn�t be surprised if we were
punished less severely though. Probably the strap again.� My mind tried to shut
out the thought.

&nbsp;

Chapter five. Interview with the Major

Later, Zulam took us for a cold shower
and gave us a disposable toothbrush and a comb and afterwards we lay alongside
each other on the bed. Both of turned our heads away from the sight of Sumala�s
back. He still groaned with pain and I wondered if the nurse would give him
another injection before we went to sleep. Roger tried to make a whispered
conversation but it was all speculation as to what would happen to us and why
were we chosen and by whom etc. It wearied me so much that I curtly told him to
put his thumb in his mouth and shut up. I had enough fears from my own thoughts
without his adding to them. Secretly I began to wonder at the changes in me,
and Roger too for that matter. Previously I would never have spoken to anyone like
that but now, faced with our situation and with Roger acting in such a feeble
way, I was being forced to be in charge. �Will they allow me to be in charge of
him? Men have priority in this country. Yet Muniba was in charge when Zulam was
here and none of the other women seemed completely downtrodden. They weren�t
slaves like I had imagined from reading about their lives on the web. Strange.�

Soon after the lights were turned down,
I�ve no idea of the time, my watch having been confiscated during the airport
search, Roger hesitatingly asked, �Do you think we should�we should�do it?
Would it be�better to�do it with me than a black man?�

�No,� I told him forcefully and then
cruelly I added, �I�m not a baby snatcher.� Immediately I wished I hadn�t said
that but it was too late. I didn�t really need to anger the only friend I had
in this place. After all the taunts he�d received today about his manhood, he
could have done without that. I waited to see how he�d react but he didn�t say
anything for a few moments and then came a few choking sobs. �Sorry, Roger,� I
apologised and paused before going on, �Like you I�m terribly afraid of what is
going to happen and I need you as a friend not a forced lover. It sounds as if
I will have plenty of them.� I did put my arm around him and at first he turned
away, but later he nestled into my breasts again and I felt his prick against
my thigh. 

For a long while I lay awake arguing with
myself. �Aren�t you being foolish? He would have done it with care, even love,
but you�ve opted to be raped by goodness knows how many black natives. His
bringing the condoms must mean he�d thought about fucking me. Why didn�t I let
him? You are going to be raped anyway so why bother? They�ll be more
experienced. I wonder what it will be like to have sex with a man? To be
fucked? How much will it hurt? Especially with their big pricks. Can�t be worse
than the strap. Will I become pregnant? Probably. You are in your fertile
period and the nurse said that just two pills wouldn�t be enough to prevent it.
If the game players wanted a white whore, why did they choose me? And Roger?
They could easily have bought a willing woman. What do they want with us? How
much did Ted know? Was he the brains behind this? Or did he just connive with
the Colonel?� Any answers were pure speculation. The pain in my bottom had
receded a little to a dull ache unless I sat down hard. Eventually I drifted
off to sleep disturbed by involuntary cries from neighbouring cells, exhausted
from all that had transpired and from the long journey. Could it be that only
the day previously I�d been safe at home?

Next morning when the lights went up we
were greeted with further cries of pain from Vilisi and Sumala when they tried
to move. Vilisi�s bottom looked awful but she stood and hobbled to her toilet.
Sumala yelled in agony as he clung to the bars to help him stand. Gone was his
bravado and I felt really sorry for him but I could do nothing and I guessed
that even if I spoke it would make him feel worse.

The nurse went to Sumala first and put
more cream on his wounds but didn�t give him another injection. �I�m keeping
you here until tomorrow,� she informed him, �I don�t like the look of a couple
of the welts. They cut you deeper than they should have.� He seemed to accept
it and didn�t have to be restrained when she tended him.

Before leaving she came to the bars and
asked me, �Are you still a virgin?� I nodded my head, yes, and she gave a
little smile. I wondered what that meant.

�You should be alright to go after
breakfast,� she told Vilisi, �There�s no broken skin but it will be painful for
a while yet. See Wyche and get some of her painkilling medicine. That will
help; I�m not allowed to give you any more. Try not to get sent back here, you
know it will be far worse next time.�

A cheerful young girl, who flirted with
the warder, brought our breakfast of some sort of meal that looked like dirty
porridge. I forced it down and persuaded Roger to do the same. For a while we
just sat without talking, each of us thinking of scenarios that might happen.
The uncertainly of it all made us snappy and I could tell the rift between us
was widening.

About mid morning a new warder unlocked
our cell and without commenting took us to the shower and made us wash each
other. Roger soon had a hard-on and tried to play with my clit when he washed
me but I gave him a nasty look and shut my legs. Had not the warder been there
I would have boxed his ears. �What has made you so aggressive? You never used
to be like that. Is it a reaction to this environment or something deeper?� Once
again, more thought questions with no answers. We did our teeth, dried
ourselves and I took some time combing my hair until the warder snatched the
comb away and proceeded to use it to neaten my pubic hair. He was a man of few
words but he did say, �The Major will want you looking presentable.� My further
questions were ignored.

We stopped at our cell only long enough
to put on our shoes and then were taken to the sergeant�s desk. �Take them to
Major Entembe�s office,� he said to a burly looking, hugely pregnant woman in
uniform �Use the strap if they cause you any trouble. It looks as if
yesterday�s are fading.� Fading they might have been, but our bottoms were
still colourful and mine was particularly tender and I hadn�t wanted to sit on
the loo when I got up. Roger made a great fuss over his but his stripes were
losing their colour.

�I sure will sergeant,� the woman
grinned. She made Roger hold my hand and we set off in hot sunshine at a fairly
slow pace because of her size. Rather insanely I wondered what we would do if
her water broke while we were en-route but we arrived without incident and
without having received any punishment. It wasn�t far and I had time to try and
evaluate the knowledge I�d gained to date. Major Entembe I knew was third in
command in Tumali. General Cumu was the head man and overall dictator, Colonel
Nubaro his deputy and the Major was under him. We were being taken to someone
high up in the chain of command and I wondered, �Will he have the authority to release
us? Or is he in on our abduction too?� That is how I thought of the events that
led us to being there. We had agreed to come but the conditions were not as
they had been explained to us.

A pleasant young girl showed us into the
Major�s office. By now I had become inured to seeing girl�s breasts but they
still caught my partner�s attention and noticing this, she even flaunted them
in front of his face. The Major was younger than I expected, mid-thirties I
guessed but I had little experience in judging the ages of African men and he
smiled when we entered. I noticed his eyes swept up and down my body until he
politely requested we be seated. At first he only seemed to talk to Roger,
mainly it was small talk, going over our personal details and ignoring our
treatment here.� Roger was slumped in his chair and stuttered a few answers.
His attitude and subservience to the major disgusted me. I wanted to know what
was going on and when we would be sent home. I decided to take the initiative.

�Are you one of the players in this game
Sir, or just one of the pieces?�

For a moment or two he looked puzzled and
for once gave me his attention. �Game?�

�Elaine�don�t�anger��

�Oh do shut up Roger. We�ve been sent
here for a reason and I need to know why.� I turned back to Major Entembe who
looked very surprised at my outburst and Roger�s reaction to it. �Yes Sir, the
game that is being played with us as pawns. The board was set out in England
and now the moves are being made. Are you one of those pushing the pieces or
are you on the board with us?� I knew I had shaken him with my forthrightness
and I half dreaded that he might take offence and send us to the whipping post
or whatever but he seemed a cultured man that might appreciate my analogy. I
relaxed a little when he sat back in his chair and his face lit up with a huge
smile.

�Very good Miss Eves. The reports said
you were good journalists and it seems there was some truth in them. To answer
your question. Yes, I suppose I am player but a player who is bound by the
rules of the game; rules made by others.� He stopped and I was about to ask a
further question when he went on, �However, from the little time we�ve played I
can see I will have to upgrade you from a pawn to a queen and downgrade your
partner to being a knight.�

�A knight should be there to protect his
queen.� I was beginning to enjoy this sparring match.

�You think we should take him off the
board altogether?� That floored me for a moment. Did that mean they would kill
him or send him home? In either case I would lose a companion that I could talk
and discus things with. 

�Pawns have their uses,� I answered.

�Would you object to Miss Eves, Elaine,
being in charge of you Mr. Hart?�

I thought Roger might object but he
dumbly shook his head and quietly said, �No.�

�An unexpected move, Elaine, one that
requires a slight change of strategy but not to the overall game plan.�

�And what is that Major?�

He laughed. �Patience Elaine, enjoy the
game. There is no fun if you know the outcome before you start and you may also
be able to influence the result. First though, we have to recognise your new
status.� I didn�t want to be part of any game but neither did I wish to annoy
him and destroy our fragile rapport. He buzzed his secretary, �Shelumba, get
supplies to send a bluestone here immediately and find a key for the cuffs on
this pair. Security should have one. I expect that it is standard issue� And
see if you can make a pot of tea for our English visitors.�

I must have smiled at that because he
looked questioningly at me. �Are all your English visitors kept naked and
chained?� I asked.

�It�s the best way when they are young
and attractive but perhaps not too willing.� He smiled broadly, �But that will
come later,� he added and I blushed a deep red when I not only realised his
meaning but that he thought I was attractive. �I�d better explain the meaning
of my instructions to Shelumba. Have you met any women wearing a necklet with a
bluestone broach?�

�On the plane.�

�Ah, yes the women delivering the babies.
Women who wear them are women who have risen above the rest and are given
positions of authority. They are able to make decisions and order things from
men that ordinary women can�t. They still have to make their bodies available
for fucking but otherwise they can act in much the same way as women in your
country. The exception is your partner; your pawn. While he is linked to you he
cannot demand anything from anyone. You can ask for his opinion but it will be
you that decides on the action to take. You can order him to fuck if you want
but he cannot demand your services.� Again I felt myself blushing at the coarse
language and the implications of it. �That brings me to the next point. As you
are now the dominant one, you will stand on his right side, therefore we need
to change the cuffs around. For the time being, we or rather I, as I haven�t
been able to consult those higher up as yet, will keep you linked together.
That is mainly for our amusement although it may add it a little more
difficulty to what you�ll have to do� as part of the game.� Again the winning
smile. �Ah the tea has arrived and the key too.� 

I know I blushed deeply when I stood up
and accidentally knocked my tits and made them wobble in front of the Major but
by then I was getting half used to being naked in front of others. We changed
chairs and I gave Roger a quick reassuring hug before we sat down again to
drink our tea and made small talk about our jobs in England and what led to my
reasoning as to why I�d suspected that we were set up. He seemed to appreciate
the way I�d made my deductions. Much as I wanted to ask about our future there,
I sensed that it would be wrong to do so. In any case the man in front of us
fascinated me; the man I knew would fuck me sooner or later. At last he came to
the point.

�You already know that tomorrow you will
have to appear before the court for bringing illegal materials into the
country. I�m sorry but I cannot do anything to stop the proceedings but I will
use my influence to try and get a lenient sentence. Both of you will have to do
your parts by pleading ignorance and showing remorse and repentance for your
actions. Fighting it and demanding rights that you would have in England will
most likely result in a whipping. In all probability you will only be sentenced
to a few strokes of the cane.�

�Oh no!� I cried, thinking of Vilisi,
�Please not that, the strap was bad enough.�

�Sorry, I will do what I can but it
mustn�t been seen that I have influenced a court decision. Too many already
know what happened at the airport to hide it under the carpet and the local
paper has it as a front page story. I will ensure that you get the best after
treatment. As a queen Elaine, you will just have to be brave.�

�I have no wish to be a queen sir, or be
brave, I just want to be sent home and get on with my life again. How long will
be kept here Major?� Tears filled my eyes when I asked.

�As long as it takes to complete the
game.� The wide smile appeared across his face again. God, I wished I hadn�t
thought of that analogy but he went on. �You are reporters and your boss sent
you here, particularly you Elaine, to find out what really happens to women in
this country and what they feel like, to use his words, �being used as baby
machines�. You already know that, what you weren�t told is that he has sent you
here for an indefinite period to find out first hand what it is like. When you
don�t return on your scheduled flight or maybe a few days later, he will
contact the British government to see what they can find out but the wheels of
government are slow and we do not have diplomatic relations with them so
negotiations will be via North Korea because Malawi officially doesn�t
recognise us either although we of course, have a lot of contact with them, so
I expect it will be several months before you�re returned.�

I wept when I heard that but the Major
looked unconcerned. �Dry your eyes Elaine and stop blubbering, it�s not all bad
news.� He handed me a tissue and I did indeed try to stem the tears. Roger for
once wasn�t crying so I braced myself and looked at the Major again. �As you
know the main income for this country is from the sale of babies for adoption.
Black babies command a good price but lighter coloured ones are at a premium
and we�d like to encourage more white girls to come here to be part of our
breeding programme.�

�You�re going to breed me?� I asked,
already knowing the answer.

�Yes and no. Like every other woman here
you will be fucked, usually several times a day. In the beginning we will do
all we can to ensure that you conceive. Only your cunt will be fucked and the
men�s sperm will be deposited as deeply as possible within you.� I just sat
wide-eyed at the statement. I knew that is what happened there but until that
moment, had hoped and believed that it couldn�t or wouldn�t happen to me.
�After we�ve determined that you are pregnant, you will be fucked just for our
pleasure and that can be in any of your holes.� Again I already knew that
happened to the native girls. �I have no doubt you will be returned to England,
before you are due to give birth so your baby won�t be sold and in any case all
women have the option of keeping their first baby. Probably it will be too late
by that time for you to have an abortion so you will either have to keep it or
have it adopted in England.� It took a few minutes for me to assimilate this. I
was going to be an unmarried mother with a black baby. Oh the shame of it. Then
I told myself that I would have nine months to think about what to do and the
present was more important. Extrapolating from the Major�s words I knew he
expected me or us to be in Tumali for at least five months and less than nine.
�At least it seems that we will be allowed home eventually,� I tried to
calm myself.

�What about Roger? What�s his part in all
this?�

�To be truthful, we didn�t want him along
but your boss told us you would never have agreed to come alone. We may let him
breed some local girls and he can help you with your work.�

�Which is?�

�To write the story of your life and the
lives of the women that live here. You will write in a very sexually explicit
way, highlighting the good points as well as the bad. Each week, before the
Today�s World deadline date, you will send a copy to Ted Sullivan. Your first
one will reassure him of your safety and will no doubt delay any government
action. No doubt he�ll fuck his wife with greater enthusiasm after he has read
of your experiences. Later a more explicit version will be posted on our web
site and no doubt Ted will also publish an unexpurgated version on DVD. Of
course, we will proof read your articles before they are sent, not only for
their accuracy but also that they are completely open about the fucking and
other sexual things that happen to you and the punishments you receive. No
mention must be made of the collusion between your magazine and us though, but
your first article can relate of your experiences so far; your experience at
the airport and in the prison. Write fully and in explicit detail.�

�And I�m supposed to do this in a prison
cell with a stick of charcoal with a sore bottom and a sore vagina?� Perhaps my
sarcasm was lost on him or he ignored it. Either way he gave me another of his
big smiles.

�Not quite. First though, you will use
the proper terms in your reports and in speaking to us. You have and arse, a
cunt and a pair of tits. You will not be having sex, or �be intimate� with a
man, you will be fucked. Understood? I nodded. Since being here and hearing the
terms used by others, my mind was using them even if my mouth didn�t. �You will
be given a room just along the corridor from here and your laptop will be
returned but you will not be allowed an Internet connection other than when in
the IT room and your report has been approved. You will also be sent out to
live with other sections of the community where conditions can be more
primitive.�

�Will we be given our clothes back?�
Roger butted in and speaking the first time in ages.

�Yes,� I said not wishing Roger to regain
the initiative, �Our bodies could get severely sunburned if our skin is not
covered.�

�You will be given native clothing after
any sentence the court imposes has been completed.� That reminded me again of
the caning or whipping we were likely to get and I just prayed that the Major
did indeed use his influence to get our sentence reduced or better still,
squashed. I guessed that I would have to be �nice� to the Major in order to
keep our punishment to the minimum.

A tap on the door interrupted my thoughts
and Shelumba entered bringing the bluestone broach. Major Entembe put it around
my neck and gave me a light kiss and then held my head and gave a more
forceful, longer one. At first I tried to pull away but then remembered that
this man held the key to our punishment and in any case I would be having sex �
no be fucked � by him before too long. I let him do as he wished. I felt his
prick hard against me and over his shoulder I saw Shelumba grin.

�It�s time,� the major said and carried
me into another room where there was a small divan. Roger, perforce had to
trail behind. �Are you ready to become a woman and perhaps a mother?� he asked.

�I don�t know Major, I really don�t
know.� I was again shaking with trepidation and fear. Or was it anticipation?
I�d often dreamed about have a man in bed and making love to me but not this
way.

�You can call me Tzarma when we�re alone
like this. Major is a bit formal when I�m about to fuck you.�

Roger was ordered to kneel by the side of
he divan when the Major gently lowered me on the soft mattress and I watched
with apprehension as he lowered his shorts and his black prick sprang into
view. It was almost equal in size to Sumala�s and was already rock hard. I
shuddered at the sight of it and wondered at the pain it would cause when he
forced it in to my vagina � my cunt. I needn�t have worried. Major Entembe was
careful and considerate. Gently he rubbed my clit and then tongued my cunt
until my juices flowed freely. Only then did he put his prick inside my
entrance and slowly make his way in. He paused, �I�ll bet you didn�t expect to
lose your precious virginity like this.� There was that big smile on his face
again as he thrust deeply into me, bursting my hymen and tightly filling me
with his manhood. I felt the pain as he broke through but there was also a
pleasurable feeling that I couldn�t define, a feeling that grew more intense
when he began to fuck. The strokes were slow at first but then as my cunt
adjusted they became faster and harder. My own sensations increased too and I
knew I was building up to my own climax. I tossed my head from side to side and
thrust at him but when I was nearly there he stopped and I knew he was erupting
and filling me with his sperm. I felt cheated but Tzarma didn�t withdraw and
when he�d finished impregnating me, continued to fuck me gently until I
climaxed. Even then he left it in until it was completely soft before he pulled
out.

Gradually I opened my eyes only to find
Roger staring pop-eyed but there were tears running down his cheeks as well.
Rightly I guessed he wished to be the one that had taken me; wished he�d had
the courage to take charge and forced me to fuck him the previous night. Tzarma
took a tissue and wiped the blood from my thighs and his prick. �Next time you
have to clean it,� he informed quietly as he rolled on to my right side. �Was
it like you expected?�

�No, nothing like,� I admitted, �I
expected my husband to do it on our wedding night. I expected it to be with
someone I wanted to willingly give myself to.�

�But I think you enjoyed it towards the
end.� I could only nod, yes. �Did you imagine Roger as your husband?�

That was a question I didn�t want to
answer, certainly not with Roger listening. After a long pause I replied,
�Sometimes him, sometimes other men on the staff, sometimes a film star. I�ve
never been close enough to anyone to think of marrying them.� 

We lay for a little while until Tzarma
announced that we ought to get some lunch before the canteen closed. He dressed
and Roger and I went with him to a cafeteria. �You can use this anytime you�re
nearby. They will be told to charge whatever you have to the admin account. And
you won�t be fucked in here either. Its not allowed in food halls.� Luckily the
place was fairly empty and we were able to get a fairly normal meal of meat and
salad stuff not all of which I recognised. Still it tasted fine although
spicier than I was used to. At least it was far better than the food we�d had
so far in prison. A few people spoke to the Major but not to us and they seemed
to ignore our state of nudity; my blonde hair and the bluestone broach
attracted their attention more.

We returned to the little bedroom and
Tzarma told us to rest there until he was ready to fuck me again. Roger was
warned, on pain of castration, not to fuck me until I received another full
load of the Major�s sperm and then only if I gave him permission. No doubt he
wanted to ensure, my future baby was his.

&nbsp;

Chapter six. Sentenced

�You really are a whore underneath that
innocent fa�ade,� Roger spat at me as soon as we were alone. �You�re nothing
but a dirty little whore who has been prick teasing me all this time.�

For a while I did not know how to answer.
It was now so obvious that he had desired me for a long while and had been too
shy to even ask for a kiss. �Roger,� I started quietly, �Roger, you may well be
right in that I am a secret whore but that is something I have only just found
out. At first I gave myself to him in the hope of getting an easement of our
punishment for tomorrow but after we got going, I really wanted him and wanted
him so badly. I�m a woman Roger and I only really found that out such a short
while ago. As for being a prick tease, when have I ever given you the smallest
hint that I would take you in my body? Never. Maybe that will change. I don�t
know.� He resisted my attempts to cuddle him and I lay there wondering if it
was really the fucking that upset him or my taking over as the one in charge or
perhaps his feelings of failure and inadequacy at his inability to protect me.

It was after five by the bedroom clock
when Tzarma returned. Roger and I had hardly spoken except when he needed to
find a toilet. Tzarma beamed a smile when he came in saw me lying on my back.
Roger immediately slid off the bed and turned his head to the wall. �Are you
sore there?� Tzarma asked as his hand cupped my cunt.

�A little.�

�Get the nurse to give you some lotion.
I�m lifting the ban on others having you from the day after tomorrow. I should
have inseminated you again by then and my sperm should be well established and
hopefully you will be ensconced in your room here.� He took less time over the
preliminaries this time and soon his prick was fully embedded in my cunt and
with my juices flowing well I was able to match each of his thrusts. This time
I noisily orgasmed long before he did and was well on the way to a second when
he stopped and pulsed his second load into me, �to make sure it all stays in
the right place� he informed me. This time he offered his soft prick to my
lips. I could see and smell our combined juices on it and hesitated. �Get used
to it Elaine, you�ll have to do it almost every time you are fucked.�

�It can�t be worse than Zulam�s,� I told
myself and gingerly started sucking it. Gradually more went into my mouth and
when I was ordered to lick his balls, I did so and was surprised when his cock
started to harden again. Knowing that Roger was surreptitiously watching, I put
on more of a show than necessary just to annoy him and confirm his statement
that I was a whore.

We were treated to dinner in the
cafeteria again and this time it was crowded, mainly men but a good smattering
of women too, all dressed albeit scantily. Many stared at us but still I didn�t
know if it was because of our nakedness or the whiteness of our skins or my
blonde hair. Two of the bluestone women I recognised from the plane came in and
did a double take when they saw me. �Congratulations, you�ve made it up the
ranks extraordinarily quickly,� one said as she planted a kiss on my cheek and
then gave Tzarma a knowing look, �I�m Uvala and this is Culmin.� We exchanged
pleasantries for a few moments and then they went to collect their meal.

Two guards were detailed escort us back
to prison and by then it was dark and cold enough to raise goosebumps on my
skin but it wasn�t far and I insisted that Roger held my hand. At one time I
wore a cross around my neck but the sensation of the bluestone bouncing on my
naked cold breasts � sorry tits � was quite different and made me notice them
even more. Fortunately it was too dark for our escorts to notice.

Sumala lay face down on his bed when we
arrived. His back and buttocks were a dreadful sight and once again I wondered
just how badly we would be punished. He looked up as we entered and tried to
smile but his face was distorted with the pain. �How can they justify such
barbarism,� I commented to Roger and he seemed as upset as I was. �We must put
that in our writing.�

�And get ourselves a similar whipping,�
Roger replied sourly. I knew he was still hurting from the earlier events.

Nurse Muniba came to treat Sumala again
soon after and I asked her if it was common to whip a person as badly as this.
�No,� she answered carefully, �It is rare for a court to order so many strokes
but it was his third time and he did hurt the other man rather badly too.
Unfortunately the man wielding the whip was a friend of the injured man and so
Sumala got it rather harder than normal. I�ve put in a complaint to the court
but I doubt it will do any good.� A few minutes later, she stopped applying the
salve and asked, �How was your day? You were away a long while and you come
back with a bluestone badge. It can�t have been too bad.�

I wanted to tell her but I was almost too
shy to. �I�ve to ask you for some lotion for��

�You did it!� she exclaimed, �And with
one of the top men too I guess. Are you free for everyone now?�

�She�s a whore!�

�There�s no such thing as a whore in this
country Roger. Our purpose here is to produce babies. There is no choice. It is
the only export we have and the only thing that keeps us in a reasonable
standard of living. Don�t ever forget that Roger.� Muniba�s voice showed her
contempt for his words. �I doubt that she had much choice and if she enjoyed
it, so much the better. Most women do. In any case I advise you not to take
your bad feelings out on her; while she wears that badge of authority, she
could demand the sergeant loan her a strap to put across your arse.� Roger
looked suitably shocked and I hadn�t realised I had so much power over him now.
I didn�t intend using it that way, but the threat might come in useful.

�You didn�t say if you are free for any
man now? Though I doubt this one will be wish to poke you through the bars
anytime soon, will you Sumala?�

�Maybe later,� he groaned. We could tell
he was trying to put a brave face on his pain and I unwittingly contrasted his
stoicism with Roger�s. 

�Not for another couple of days. Major
Entembe seems to want his sperm to inseminate me. He wants me to have his baby.
Oh what will I do when I get back? How will I live it down?� My voice broke and
I lost the bravado I�d experienced with Tzarma. I sat on the bed and cried. To
my surprise Roger sat close beside me and gave me a left-handed hug.

�If we write about it like we�re supposed
to, then everyone will know and hopefully they�ll understand.�

A short while later, Zulam came by and
thrust a local newspaper through the bars. The front page featured a large
colour picture of me lying naked on the punishment bench, receiving a
strapping. It was taken from an angle that showed my open cunt and by the looks
of things, I had already had most of the stripes. I was mortified. The story
went into great detail into the reasons for the punishment and also Roger�s
reaction. �The whole country will know about us now,� Roger wailed when he read
it. I knew he really meant the whole country would know about his cowardice
although I began to see that this was really just part of his physical make up.

Zulam passed the paper to Sumala when I
returned it but although he read it several times, he didn�t comment on it.

Later that night, when the lights dimmed
and Sumala quietly snored from the effects of whatever the nurse had given him,
Roger apologised. �I�ve often fantasised that I would be the first one to make
love to you; make love, not just fuck you like today and when I had to watch
him do it, I felt so sick. So sick that I could have easily murdered him if I�d
had half a chance. Then when I saw you actually enjoying it all, I flipped even
more. I�m no he-man, I know that, I�m not like most of the men here, brave and
courageous but ever since we met, I�ve wanted you as my girlfriend�� He broke
into a little sob. I couldn�t see how I could possible love such a weak man but
I didn�t wish to destroy his self esteem any more so I just cuddled him and
felt his mouth nibble my breast.

For a long while I lay awake, rehearsing
a speech that I hoped would convince the judges to be lenient with us but with
no prior knowledge of what might evoke their sympathy, I just had to try and
overcome my residual reticence and live up to my bluestone status.

Neither of us wished to eat the unsavoury
looking breakfast; both of us worried about how we would fare at court and what
sentence they would impose. We agreed to do as the Major suggested and plead
ignorance of their laws and beg for forgiveness but neither of believed that we
would get away scot-free. That didn�t fit the game plan. Fortunately, we had an
early appearance so we had less time to fret and worry. It was a strange
courtroom, not much more than a room really. Three men sat at a table and we
were led in handcuffed to a guard on each side who also had to support us.
Tearfully I looked around but in this courtroom there was no jury, no
witnesses, no council; just the guards, the judges and us.

The charges were read out by the judge in
the centre chair who went on, �I understand that you are pleading guilty to
these charges and that you Miss Eves are pleading on behalf of both of you.� 

�Yes Sir,� I answered, my voice already
wavering and I hardly made it through my prepared speech before I could no
longer control my emotions and wept bitterly. It must have had some effect on
Roger because he was crying too but the judges, the men that mattered, seemed
unperturbed and curtly told me to stop babbling and sit down while they
considered their verdict. 

After only a few minutes whispered
conversation, the head judge stood up and bade us stand again. I knew then that
my pleading and tears had counted for nothing. It had all been cut and dried
before we even entered the courtroom. Elaine Eves and Roger Hart you have both
confessed to importing items and substances that are illegal in this country.
Miss Eves, you made a very impassioned plea for clemency and to try and
minimise your guilt but I�m afraid, that does not alter the fact that you
knowingly tried to bring these items into the country and you failed to heed
our laws concerning your dress even after being requested to do so by the
stewardess on the plane. Mr. Hart you were then the dominant male and should
have been in full charge of your woman, yet you did not take any steps to
prevent her bringing in these items and indeed you brought in items of your own
and therefore, despite your being recently downgraded in status, you must be
considered equally guilty and punished with equal severity. It is our opinion
that to allow your pleas would or could lead to others trying to flout our laws
in a similar way. The normal punishment that we would consider for these
combined offences would be twenty or more lashes with the whip.� My mind reeled
at the thought and the pull on my left arm indicated that Roger had fainted.
The guard on his side pulled him to his feet and my guard had to hold me
steady. It was only when he whispered, �Calm yourself, he isn�t finished yet,�
that I regained some semblance of control over my body.

The judge started to speak again, �Twenty
lashes with the whip is the punishment you deserve and is what we would have
awarded had not we received a communication from Major Entembe himself. He pointed
out that the pair of you are required to work in the government offices with
immediate effect and in fact were recruited by Colonel Nubaro to do the work.
He respectfully suggests that any punishment we award be of a nature that does
not require a lengthy period of rehabilitation. The government would like you
both to be able to take up your posts and start work in the next day or two at
the latest but he hastens to add that any such leniency is entirely at our
discretion. We have carefully considered this and have decided that we would
not wish to unduly delay whatever plans government office has for you but both
culprits must pay the price of their misdeeds, misdeeds that so many
witnessed.� He paused and looked straight at us. I had no idea what he
intended. How could they have �carefully considered this� when they�d only had
a short whispered conversation? It was all pre-arranged. First it looked as if
we were going to suffer a flogging that would maim us for life, then we might
almost be let off but now a severe punishment was on the cards again.

The wait seemed to go on forever and once
again I felt myself shaking and being supported by the guard. Without looking I
knew Roger was only on his feet because his guard was holding him up. �Elaine
Eves and Roger Hart we sentence you to ten strokes of the leather strap
followed by ten with the rattan cane. All to be delivered at the whipping post
in the Market Square in one hour�s time��

�No! That will kill us,� I shrieked
before I slid to the floor.

�Further,� the judge went on when we�d
regained our feet, �You will detained in Tumali until General Cumu exercises
his discretion and grants you a pardon to allow you to leave.�

&nbsp;

Chapter seven. Punished

It appeared that we were expected to walk
from the courtroom to the Market Square, a distance of about half a mile, maybe
a little more but both of us were in such a state that we could hardly stand,
let alone walk. I couldn�t control any of my limbs and my whole body shook
violently. It was only after I was given a drink of a bitter liquid that I
regained some of my composure. �Come along Miss,� my guard spoke quite kindly
to me, �You don�t want to annoy the flogging master by keeping him waiting.
Start walking. The sooner we get there, the sooner it will be over and done
with.� I knew he was trying to help but I could hardly put one foot before the
other. Nevertheless with his help and with his mate helping Roger we slowly
made our way to the square where crowds of people had already assembled. Once
more I knew that this had all been prearranged.

We waited for a few minutes at the end of
the track leading into the square and I could see how they arranged for each
punishment to become a public spectacle. In the centre of the square stood a
stout upright post with ropes passing through a pulley near its top. Around the
post and several yards away, surrounding it in a semicircle on three sides were
tiered stands. Already they were filled with people, men and women, all noisily
eager to watch the punishment being carried out. The scene reminded me of The
Tale of Two Cities where the townspeople came to watch the aristocrats
beheaded.

I murmured, �No, no, no. No further, I
can�t go on,� to the guard but he simply half carried me into the square. The
crowd greeted our arrival with a huge cheer and the guard put me on my feet
again. 

�Walk proud like you really are a
bluestone.� I would have cheerfully thrown the bloody bluestone at the crowd if
I had thought it would release me. I glanced at Roger. He like me had tears streaming
down his face and was only standing with support. �Stand and walk,� my guard
ordered. Like a zombie I did so. At last something clicked in my brain. It
mattered not whether I was dragged screaming and bawling to the post or whether
I walked with some dignity, either way I would receive the same punishment. I
started to walk but was stopped by Roger resolutely sitting down in the dirt.
My guard undid the chain between us. �Walk on,� he said again and like a horse
obeying his master�s order I did so. Naked and in front of everyone, I made my
way slowly to the post. �Well done,� he said when I reached it. The crowd
seemed to appreciate my supposed bravery because they clapped and cheered. I
didn�t feel at all brave. Numbly I allowed my wrists to be bound and soon my
arms were hoisted aloft.

Odd how some things pass through your
mind at a time like that. The hot sun burned my back and I remembered that I
hadn�t brought any sunblock. Sunburn was the least of my worries! My tits
pressed against the post and I was concerned about getting splinters in them
but these irrelevant thoughts were quickly chased away when someone in a loud
voice read out my punishment. �Elaine Eves you are to receive ten strokes with
the leather strap and ten with the rattan cane, all soundly applied.� I started
to sag in my bonds but I couldn�t move far. Out of the corner of my eye I saw
the hooded flogging master pick up the strap but it seemed an age before he
stood to one side of me and waited for the crowd to quieten down.

�SLAAAPP!!� The most horrendous pain that
I had ever experienced erupted across my shoulder blades. I screamed but it was
largely lost in the crowd noise. �How could they be so cruel to a girl? This
may have been the norm to them but to me�� �SLAAAPP!!� I screamed again as the
second blow landed. Another wait while I howled and screamed but before long
the third stroke bit into my sore shoulders. The whole area burned with a
raging fire. �I cannot take any more. I must try and pass out.� Another blow
and still I didn�t fade into unconsciousness. Nor did I after the fifth. This
was far worse than the strapping at the airport.

A longer wait. �SLAAAPP!!� The next
stroke went right across my arse, low down and only a little above the crease.
My cries were now very hoarse and two more strokes went across my arse in
fairly quick succession. Perhaps the flogging master noticed that I was fading.
A wait then two more. I knew that my whole back and arse was one huge blister
ready to burst open and spill my blood over the soil. I could feel it trickling
down my legs and then realised that I was pissing. The laughter from the crowd
should have embarrassed me but all I could think of was the pain. Pain, pain
and more pain. The flogging master must have been skilled at his job because
later I found that not one of the strokes had landed on top of another. In a
few days, the whole of my upper back and all of my arse blossomed into a huge
extremely painful, purple bruise with very little space between the stripes.
�How am I going to survive this? Why did they send me to this godforsaken
place? Why were we set up?� I was becoming a little delirious and we were only
halfway through my sentence and the worst was yet to come. I began to fade.

Suddenly water sprayed over my body and
my head. It felt cool but it woke up my senses again. The water drenched my
hair and ran over my face and down between my tits. It was refreshing but at
the price of restoring the feeling of the terrible pain. I yelled and pleaded
with them to free me and send me home but I doubt anyone heard my words.

The crowd quietened and I sensed my
punishment, my flogging; my mediaeval barbaric torture, was about to begin
again. The cane bit into my already blistered and swollen shoulders. The force
of the blow knocked me hard against the post and my breasts splayed either side
of it. My cries should have awakened all the spirits in their world but none
came to save me. Four more times that dreadful piece of cane caused me the utmost
pain and I had no doubt that I really was bleeding and that I had deeper welts
than those Vilisi suffered. Blackness started to overcome me and I felt a
little relief from the pain but soon the hose returned me to my suffering.

�Only five more,� I heard someone shout.
They, of course would be across my arse. Across flesh so puffed up and wet that
I surmised the cane would hurt even more. I really don�t know if it made any
difference. I was almost out of it after the first stroke landed and the remaining
ones were little more than a blur in my mind. I know I kept yelling and
screaming but at last it all ended. The hose played over my body again and
hands held me under the armpits while my wrists were untied. I collapsed into
someone�s arms and I was turned so the all sections of he crowd could see the
result of my flogging. At last a sheet was wrapped around me and I was lowered
on to a blanket on the ground. I lay face down in the utmost pain, wishing the
world would end and take me with it. I closed my eyes and I know I mumbled
incoherently until my thoughts were once again brought into focus by the
shouting and screaming that came from Roger as they fastened him to the
whipping post.

At the same time a middle-aged woman, a
complete stranger, scrambled down over the seats and knelt beside me. She said
something to the guard in the local language and he nodded. �Kneel dear. Get up
on your knees like this. Hold on to me.� I didn�t want to move at all as each
twist of my muscles sent bolts of pain through me but she was insistent and
soon I knelt unsteadily in an upright position with my knees and forelegs on
the blanket. �I�m placing my cushion on the back of your legs dear so if you
need to sit a bit it will take some of the pressure and I�m sure you�d like a
drink.� I did indeed. My throat was parched from all the yelling and I must
have lost a lot of water from crying let alone from the heat. I think I stopped
muttering about that time but I know I didn�t reply. She didn�t seem to want
one. Opening my eyes a little more I saw her pour some liquid from an
earthenware pitcher into a paper cup. �It�s only water with some herbs and
spices,� she informed me but at the time I didn�t care what it was. She put the
cup to my lips and I tried to gulp the liquid down but she reprimanded me in a
motherly way. �Sip it slowly dear. Keep it in your mouth a moment or two before
swallowing.� Her kindness almost overwhelmed me and I slumped down only to find
that putting my backside on the cushion was not a good idea. Lifting myself up
slightly and clinging to my benefactor�s shoulders, I found that I could take
in the scene in front of me although it appeared blurred and out of focus. My
heart pumped faster than normal and it was with great difficulty that I heeded
the words of the women to calm down. �How can I calm down when I am in such
agony,� I thought but just her soothing presence was reassuring.

My eyes were so wet with crying I still
couldn�t see properly but I saw what was almost a silhouette of the flogging
master take up his position and wait for the crowd to hush and for the sentence
to be read out. My instinctive reflexes winced as I watched the belt fly in a
wide arc and land across Roger�s shoulders. He immediately hung limp from his
wrists. There were boos and groans from the crowd much like at the airport and
my sympathy went out to him. In a way I wished that I could have done the same.
It seemed to take an age for the hose to revive him but the same thing happened
at the next stroke and after the third, Roger took so long coming round that I
thought he�d died. The flogging master threw down the strap in disgust and then
picked it up again and let fly the remaining strokes without stopping and
without much power and not waiting for Roger to recover. How I wished I could
have closed my senses down in that way. 

It took long minutes and something held
under his nose before Roger regained consciousness and again I worried that
they might have killed him but a doctor looking man put a stethoscope to his
chest and listened. Seemingly he couldn�t find anything amiss and shrugged his
shoulders to the crowd and had a few words with the flogging master. Again
Roger only took one not too hard a stroke of the cane before sagging in his
bonds. The crowd, unhappy at the poor showing started shouting and throwing
fruit and nuts until the guards stopped them. Still lifeless, he hung there
while the flogging master delivered a further nine token strokes. Finally he
was released and he moaned pitifully when he came round. In one respect I was
pleased that he wasn�t that badly hurt, in another way I was disgusted at his
poor showing but even at that time I knew Roger had no control over the way his
body reacted.

�They�ll take care of you now dear,� I
heard the woman say and I must have muttered some sort of thank you because she
gave me a big smile and kissed my forehead. Of the next few minutes I remember
very little. Two men came and placed me face down on a stretcher and although
they tried to be gentle, the movements hurt me terribly so the next thing I
really remember is lying on my bed in the prison with Nurse Muniba standing
alongside with a syringe in her hand. I didn�t even feel the needle go in but
the relief it gave was nearly instantaneous. 

�Lie still Elaine, I need to clean your
back and arse and put antiseptic cream on. I�ll be a gentle as I can but you
shouldn�t feel too much pain for the next few hours.� Muniba washed my back
with a liquid that had an aniseed smell and several times when I caught a brief
sight of the sponge I saw red patches and I knew the cane had cut through my
skin. Muniba dabbed me dry and gently rubbed in a cream. Suddenly it came to
me; I wasn�t chained to Roger.

�Where�s�� Talking seemed terribly
difficult.

�In the next cell.� I turned my head only
to see Sumala watching me.

�He didn�t need to spoil you like that,�
he said bitterly. �You were so beautiful.� Although his tone was sympathetic,
his words caused me a great deal of agitation. �Was I going to be scarred for
life?�

Muniba must have read my mind. �You�ll
heal fine. All the men will be thirsting for you soon.� That wasn�t the
reassurance I wanted. �And Roger�s in the Vilisi�s cell. I�ll give him his
injection in a moment.� She moved slightly so I could see past her to where
Roger laid groaning and crying out and when he saw us turn towards him the
volume of his cries rose to a pathetic level. �I better give him something to
shut him up otherwise there will be no peace for anyone in this building.� The
nurse grinned and so did the warder and Sumala.

For a while I lay on the bed in
comparative ease. The injection had reduced the pain to a dull ache and,
although awake to my surroundings, I felt drowsy as if I was not really in my
own body. My mind floated near the ceiling and I looked down on the scene below
without being part of it. A hand gripping mine brought me back down again and
when I opened my eyes I saw Sumala�s face the other side of the bars. It showed
a surprising concern for my welfare. He gave a small smile and whispered,
�Sleep a little Ellie. You�re exhausted.� I didn�t even attempt to pull my hand
from his; I even clutched one of his fingers tightly just like a baby. It
brought me a little comfort.

Some time later, the sound of the cell
being unlocked and hushed but familiar voices woke me. Major Tzarma Entembe in
full uniform entered the cell accompanied by the nurse, the sergeant and
several other men. I closed my eyes again and pretended to sleep; I didn�t want
to speak with him. He, I was sure, could have prevented my punishment.

�By all the spirits nurse, that looks an
overly severe punishment. You are doing everything possible for her?� Tzarma�s
voice was grave.

�Of course we are Sir. I do what I can to
treat all those who are punished whatever they have done.� Muniba sounded
affronted that he should even suggest that she did otherwise. �Yes Sir, her
punishment was far more severe than I expected for the sentence she received. I
would guess the flogging master didn�t take into account that she is a white
girl and her skin in thinner than ours and he�s broken through it in a number
of places as you can see. The whiteness also shows the marks much more
vividly.� She hesitated as if deciding what to say, �Sir?� You might wish to
consider reprimanding the flog master. This is not the first time he�s
overstepped the mark. Sumala there should have been released today but his
wounds are too bad for me to sanction it.�

Sumala tried to pull his hand away but I
kept a tight hold on his finger. Whether Tzarma reacted to this I couldn�t tell
because I didn�t wish to open my eyes and face him.

�Ellie�s body should not have been
spoiled like that Sir. She looked like an angel before and now��

Tzarma seemed to ignore Sumala�s comment
but I have no doubt he reacted to it inwardly. �Will she be scarred nurse?� I
flinched at his question and I guess they knew that I was awake and listening. 

�I don�t think so Sir. I�ll do everything
possible to prevent any scarring. The wounds are not too deep but they may take
a long while to fade and if the bones are bruised the pain will take a long
while to disappear.�

�Open your eyes Elaine � or is it Ellie
now?� 

�Whatever�Sir,� I managed to croak.

�It�s okay, I like Ellie and I won�t ask
any more questions. Rest now. You certainly earned your bluestone today. I saw
the film of it.� No apology but I detected a caring note in his voice. �Where�s
the other one? The one she was chained to? The one who only took a fraction of
his punishment?�

�He�s in a cell at the other end of the
corridor. We moved him because he caused too much disturbance and was calling
Miss Elaine the most outrageous names. You can order them to be chained again
Sir but she really needs a bed of her own for a few days and in his own way,
Sumala is a comfort to her.� Tzarma lifted his eyebrows. �No Sir, he hasn�t
fucked her or even tried to. He�s still in too much pain to do anything at the
moment. In any case the ban on fucking her hasn�t been lifted yet. I think it
is just his male presence that is giving her a little strength.�

�I�ll consider the chaining option when
she�s recovered sufficiently and they have to work together. I want them moved
into the flat in the offices as soon as possible.�

�I would respectfully suggest Sir, that
she is kept here for a few days where we can keep a better eye on her and I am
more or less immediately available.�

�We�ll see how well she responds to your
treatment.� The Major�s words were quite abrupt.

When I next woke the lights were dim but
my hand still gripped Sumala�s finger. My movement must have disturbed him too
because he opened his eyes and I found myself staring directly at him. �Would
you like a drink?� he whispered, �Muniba left some for you.� I nodded and felt
a great sense of loss when he released my grip to pour some into a cup for me.
I mumbled hoarse thanks and sipped the drink slowly and passed the cup back.
The pain was returning but it wasn�t horrendously bad but it was enough to
cause me to wince. I desperately needed to pee and tried to lift my body from
the bed but I didn�t have the strength to overcome the weight and the pain.
�You need to piss?� How did he know? What could he do anyway? �I have a ladies
piss bowl.� Presumably the nurse had left it with him. I noticed that he was
still in considerable pain when he moved but he never moaned or mentioned it. 

Instead of just passing me the utensil,
he reached through the bars and placed it between my legs. It must have been
designed for girls lying face down because it moulded itself to me but even so
it took some time before I released my flow. All the time Sumala kept it
pressed against me and spoke quietly until I finished. Carefully he removed the
container and emptied it in his own toilet. Once my mind went back to a few
days ago and thought how I would have been highly embarrassed to even have a
man in my presence when performing such a simple bodily function, but with the
pain and all that had happened in the previous few hours, I was past caring. He
forgot to wipe but I could forgive him that. He was a man. I had someone who
was strong enough and caring enough to help me was all that mattered. Clasping
his hand again I shut my eyes and went over things in my mind. 

�Why did I now appreciate the man I held
when I�d found him so abhorrent at first? Was it because I was no longer a
virgin? Because I had taken a man�s prick inside me? Why was I so disgusted
with Roger�s behaviour when I knew that he couldn�t help being like he was? He
couldn�t help becoming unconscious at the least pain could he? Did he keep his
pathetic moaning and complaining just to get my attention? Or did he really
want someone to mother him? Why had he turned against me and called me those
vile names?� I drifted off into a troubled sleep again.

Next thing I remember was the sound of my
cell being unlocked and Muniba checking me over. She didn�t look too pleased
and even her gentle prodding caused me pain. �I�m going to give you another
injection. Not the same stuff but it will help ease the pain a little. I
mustn�t give you too much of the drug you had yesterday.� I felt the needle
prick my skin and we waited for it to take effect. �A shower first young lady
and then I�ll treat the wounds. Do you need to piss?� I nodded. �Bring the piss
bowl in here please Sumala. You seem to know what to do and then help her to
the shower. And you have one too and keep your prick out of her while you�re in
there.� 

�I won�t hurt her or fuck her until she�s
healed. I�m not that much of a bastard.�

�I know you won�t Sumala, that�s why I
asked you,� Muniba laughed. She�d already examined him and left his cell
unlocked. �You can both appreciate the other�s pain so it might be better for
you to help each other rather than ask the warders.� It took two men though to
get me on my feet and a minute or two before I was steady enough to cling to
Sumala�s arm and hobble with him to the shower room.

We passed Roger�s cell on the way. He lay
on his bed moaning. I could see his back and arse were pretty colourful and I
wonder how mine compared. �You whore!� he yelled when he saw me clinging on
Sumala�s arm, �You just want all the black prick you can get!� Sumala stiffened
and for a moment I thought he might react but the pain of moving and holding me
preventing him doing anything rash. When Roger got up from the bed and came to
the door unaided, I knew he wasn�t that badly hurt. He walked stiffly but
definitely he was not in severe pain. My distain for him multiplied but I just
urged Sumala on and tried to ignore the taunts and wicked aspersions as to why
I was with Sumala. I hoped I could persuade Tzarma not to chain me to him again
but if we were again linked I decided that he would be the underdog all the
time and I would use my bluestone status to force him to do the most menial
tasks. I could tolerate him being a wimp but not his spitefulness. Our
relationship deteriorated further when he saw that on our return, Sumala had a
partial erection.

Muniba must have decided to take some
action against him. �Muniba, isn�t it time you came and treated me?� he
shouted. 

�Yes,� she called back, �Just as soon as
I have finished treating this man.� There was another prisoner who had been in
for several days before we arrived and was due for discharge. He�d been
punished a week or so ago and his stripes were healed enough to leave, but the
knife wound he�d sustained as part of the fracas had turned sceptic and Muniba
was treating that. 

�But I�m in serious pain and need an
injection. Now!�

Finally Muniba finished what she was
doing and went to Roger�s cell. �I�m not going in there until he is properly
restrained and silenced,� she quietly told the warder, �You may need to get
help.� She came back to us to wait.

�Is my back and bottom, really worse than
his?� I asked. The nurse looked grave but she nodded, yes. �Can I see it?�

�Not for the time being, now lie down and
let me put the cream on. You�d better go back to your cell Sumala and I�ll
treat you next, the shower has washed off the cream I put on earlier.� My
imagination ran riot with the thoughts of how badly mutilated I was. While I
was being treated I heard some scuffles and crying and screaming from Roger but
quite suddenly it went quiet except for some rattling of metal on metal. �Rest
for an hour Ellie, and then I want you to walk the length of the corridor both
ways. It will hurt some but I don�t want the muscles to become so stiff they
will be difficult to move later. I will ask Zulam who is on duty again, to let
you and Sumala out so you can both walk together.�

When we walked by Roger was still restrained,
shackled to the bars at the head and foot ends of the bed, but I didn�t say
anything to him and the gag prevented him saying anything to us. Sometime later
a man came and photographed my back and Sumala�s too but the reason wasn�t
divulged. I suspected it was due to the flogging master being reprimanded.
Copies of the photos later ended up in my file in the IT office. I almost
vomited when I saw them.

Major Entembe visited during the
afternoon and seemed shocked at the colour of my flesh. Muniba repeatedly
assured him that it was only the bruising coming out and I was making
satisfactory progress but it would be a slow process. He had a long
conversation with her out of my hearing and they visited Roger�s cell but
didn�t go in. He�d been released from the restraints that held him to the cell
bars but had been kept handcuffed and was warned that the gag would go back in
if there were any further outbursts.

&nbsp;

Chapter eight. Our roles defined

Four days later I was able to walk
unaided if my shuffling along like an aged woman could be considered walking,
and the nurse told me that I would be released that afternoon. �I wanted to
keep you here longer but Major Entembe insists that it is time for you to take
up your duties; your journalistic duties and your womanly ones. He rightly
pointed out that your accommodation and the food in Government House is far
superior to here and you can no doubt guess it will make it more convenient for
him pop in to fuck you. I�ve pressured him into agreeing not to make you lie on
your back when he does so and has agreed to use other ways until such time as
you are healed sufficiently. The ruling will apply to any male that is allowed
to fuck you and I suspect that after tomorrow when the Major has filled you
with his sperm again, that will apply to any male.� I started to ask questions
but she bade me wait until she had finished. �He will explain all the necessary
rules. I am to visit you each morning to check on your condition. That�s
perhaps the good news. The down side is that, while Roger is not going to be
linked to you for the time being, he is to stay by your side at all times just
as though he is again physically connected. He will go to the toilet with you,
stay by your bed when a man is fucking you and be totally subservient to you at
all times. If he doesn�t behave, you may use the strap to punish him. If that
is insufficient incentive, he can always be sent back to the flogging master
who might try other methods of keeping him awake. The Major wanted to chain you
like you were before but I managed to get the concession on the grounds that
any serious pull on your arms could easily open up your wounds on your back
again. I also thought that you might prefer it that way.�

&nbsp;

�Are you sure you don�t know why I�m
being taken to the Major�s office with you Ellie?� Sumala asked as the three of
us stumbled along the uneven path to Government House. �Am I in trouble?�

�I have no more knowledge than you Suma.
The Major�s not mentioned you much in his visits and you�ve been listening
through the bars anyway. I haven�t seen him for two days but it seems he
visited Muniba more recently. I told you what she told me before we left. I had
no idea you were coming. I even said good-bye. It wasn�t until the guards came
and collected you as well as us that I knew.� 

�She wants you on hand to�� Roger started
but stopped when I turned and glared at him. He didn�t need a verbal reminder
of his position.

Roger and I were still naked but after a
week without wearing clothes, that had ceased to worry me. None of the
Tumalians we met were overly concerned about it and didn�t even make rude
comments. All seemed concerned at the state of my back though. Sumala wore his
shorts for the first time. For my part, I was dreading the day when I would have
material chafing the welts, welts that were now scabbing over and no longer
open but I knew I would need them when I was fit enough to go outside.

Inside the building we were quickly shown
into Shelumba�s office. �Sorry.� She apologised, �You�ll have to wait for a
little while, the Major has a visitor. He said you might need this.� Shelumba
handed me a soft pillow. She, like all those we�d passed in the building looked
horrified at the state of my back and they even commented on Sumala�s too. �I�m
sorry, no one thought your punishment would be as severe as it was. We�ll do
all we can to help you in the next few weeks.� I asked about Sumala but she
said it would be the Major�s task to explain. We chatted for a few more minutes
and then she said, �Perhaps I ought to warn you, when the Major�s visitor comes
out, stand up straight and bow your head until he has gone. You don�t need to
get into any more trouble because of your ignorance of our etiquette.� 

By the end of ten minutes, even with the
pillow, the chair was becoming uncomfortably hard and several times I had to
lift myself up. Fortunately the office door opened and when Shelumba stood the
others and I copied her, albeit at a much slower pace. I caught a glimpse of
the man�s face and recognised it from photographs on the web; Colonel Nubaro.

Unexpectedly he stopped and looked at our
group. �So you�re Ted Sullivan�s reporters. Look at me please.� I lifted my
head and saw that he was smiling. I wanted to ask about the immunity document
but I knew this was not the right time and questioning him now could land us in
a worse situation. �I hear you managed for fall foul of our laws already. That
was unfortunate but it will give you something to write about. Turn around
please, Miss Eves.� I did so. �It was never our intention to have her punished
like this Major. What happened?�

�An over zealous flogging master Sir.�

�Have him flogged in a similar way.�

�The matter is already in hand Sir.

�And the boy?�

�Passed out at every stroke Sir.�

�Unusual. Still we only accepted him as a
makeweight but it might be interesting to put him in the Mummy Boy camp and see
what happens. I see you�ve put her in charge now. They�ll have to stay until
her stripes have faded but at least Ted will get his money�s worth out of her.
I think we should send Ted pictures of her stripes. That will help sell the
magazine and increase interest in our country and it will raise the profile of
our negotiations with the British government.�

�We already have pictures of her Sir, and
pictures of her in the customs hall at the airport and a number of her at the
whipping post. The Chapoti Post has also printed pictures and run a story on
them. Ted will probably sell them to the TV companies in England.� 

�I was utterly shocked at the news and
found myself becoming feint from standing in the one position and hearing the
conversation. A moment later I found myself held in Sumala�s arms. The Major
was showing his visitor out. A glass of water revived me and I had a few
moments to go over some of the Colonel�s remarks. 

�It was never our intention to have her
punished like this.� They�d planned our punishment in advance. Why? Sounded as
if Ted knew about it too so it must have been worked out even before we left
England. Now they wanted the magazine readers and indeed the whole world when
it was put on the web and TV, to gloat over my misfortune; our misfortune. I
would be shown naked and being beaten. How would I ever live it down? Could I
ever return to work in England again? And then Nubaro said, �We only accepted
him as a makeweight.� Did Ted suspect Roger would be useless in this situation?
Or was it that I would never have come on my own? I wonder what Roger thought
of that? It won�t have helped his self esteem at all. Nor will the bit about
being sent to the Mummy Boy camp. By then the Major had returned and I�d
finished the water. Shelumba ushered us into his office and even brought the
pillow for me to sit on.

There were only two chairs and my pillow
was placed on one and after the Major indicated we should sit, I ordered Roger
to kneel on the floor beside me. I was rewarded with a smile from the Major and
a scowl from Roger.

At first the Major reiterated what Nurse
Muniba had told me but he went on, �For the rest of today and all tomorrow, I
am keeping you for my exclusive use. After that, others will be free to fuck
you outside working hours and outside the restricted areas like the cafeteria.
No one, not even me, is allowed to enter your bedroom without your express
invitation. If a man asks to come to your room, you are within your rights to
say no. If he asks to fuck you in a recreational area, then you must allow it.
Is that clear Elaine? Shelumba has a typed list of all this and will give it to
you afterwards.�

�Yes Sir.�

�Roger, as I said earlier, you must keep
close to Elaine just as though you were physically connected. You may only fuck
her if she requests it and you may only fuck other ladies, if Elaine permits
it. During the day you will help her with the journalistic work you came here
to do. At those times you can advise, suggest and debate the best way to write
the articles but at all other times and in all other matters, you will be under
her strict control. Your pathetic behaviour in the last few days almost caused me
to send you on your own directly to the Mummy Boy camp where they would
certainly have used you like a woman.� I looked down at Roger kneeling at my
side and noticed his prick was hardening. The Major must have seen it too but
he didn�t comment. �However, I see from your file that in the office the pair
of you bounced ideas off each other and produced excellent articles under a
dual by-line. If that doesn�t work here, then for the rest of your time in this
country, your arse can serve the needs of the queer pricks that are not allowed
to produce babies. Do you think he will be able to handle a situation like that
Elaine?� 

Roger hung his head but I couldn�t tell
if he was pleased or disappointed that he wouldn�t be sent to the homosexual
camp but the question was directed to me and not him. �Maybe he will Sir, but
he will have to come to terms with the fact that I am not the innocent shy girl
he knew in England. I have the same brain and the same ideas but my inner
feelings have been drastically changed. They are not to his liking but I�m not
going to change back. If he doesn�t accept me like this, then perhaps a spell
in the camp will do him good and we could do an article on it.� I waited a
moment and then asked, �Are there camps for lesbians too?�

�No, there are no bans on lesbians but as
all women have to allow themselves to be fucked regularly, lesbians are baby
producers too. We do have women that live together like Uvala and Culmin who
you�ve met but they are mated like every other woman of child bearing age.� I
wondered what it would be like to have sex with a woman but my arse was
beginning to feel the effects of sitting and I shifted slightly in the chair
and the Major continued with his speech.

�Sumala I have no doubt you are puzzled
over your role in this and even what you are doing in this building. You have a
record of violence and for the use of illegal beverages but Nurse Muniba and I
noted how gentle and caring you were with Elaine. Your records also show that
you know your way around the mountains here and you are known in many of the
encampments. When Elaine is fit we will be sending her on assignments to visit
various communities and it will be your job to keep her out of real danger and
to introduce her to those people who can help with her work. With her you will
be subject to the same limitations as other men; no fucking during work time
and no entering her bedroom without permission and the term bedroom can
encompass anything from her room here, to a sleeping bag out in the wilds. It
will be a few days yet before you too are fit enough to go far but you can use
the time learning some of the new services a journalist will require of you �
and I don�t mean the sex services. You must be able to use a camera or digital
recorder and to capture her images and dialogues so that she can produce
accurate articles. Do you accept the position?� 

Sumala seemed stunned by the proposition
and I learned later he�d never had a proper job and certainly not one which
required him to escort a white woman but he stuttered a yes.

�All three of you will be paid at civil
servants rates and you will be given an advance on your pay as soon as Shelumba
arranges it. Your wages in England will also continue to be paid into your bank
accounts so you should be financially well off, particularly as your expenses
here will be minimal. Suitable uniforms will be provided but for the next day
or two, Elaine you would be better off without them. As you�ve probably already
noticed, no one here will be concerned about your nudity. I think that�s about
all I need to say for now; Shelumba will give you more details of your living
arrangements. Elaine, I trust you will accompany me to dinner tonight.�

The interview ended abruptly and I knew
this was to prevent us asking questions. Shelumba handed me a sheaf of papers
and showed us to our rooms, Sumala�s was just a few doors away from ours. He,
like us, had a double bed and I wondered with a twinge of jealousy, if he would
be taking other women into it. I doubted he would tonight but he had every
right to do so. Tumali was not a monogamous country and I had only a vague idea
how the family system worked. Finding out was a project for later. I needed to
rest. Shelumba saw this and suggested, �Elaine, it is over an hour before the
cafeteria opens so may I suggest that you lie down for a while and after lunch
I�ll take you to your work area and introduce you to the IT people. You won�t
be expected to do much for the first few days. Your belongings, except for the
illegal items of course, are in your room and Muniba has provided a large pot
of the cream for your back and bum. You have cream in your bathroom too Sumala.
You will be allowed to fetch your belongings from your home later.�

We found everything just as she said.
Even my laptop and digital camera were in a drawer. Nothing, not even the
smallest coin, was missing. There were also Tumali style blouses and skirts in
the wardrobe but I didn�t feel like even trying them on. They had also provided
a short leather belt that I showed to Roger but he only shrugged as if to dare
me to use it. I really didn�t want to either but I knew that it might be the
only way to keep my control over him. He continued to play the sulky teenager
and barely spoke to me. His resentment surfaced when I asked him to apply the
cream to my back. He did but so roughly that I cried out with the pain. Moments
later Sumala appeared in the doorway and seeing the situation, grabbed Roger
and tossed him heavily to the floor where he lay crying like a baby. Had he
been fit, I think Sumala would have hurt him more.

�Thanks Suma, leave him now,� I tried to
calm the situation, �Please will you put the cream on for me and I�ll do the
same for you.� Sumala�s gentle massaging of the cream into my sore skin did
ease the pain considerably but he didn�t stop at the places that had been
whipped, he carried on massaged the area between my legs. Unashamedly I opened
my thighs to give him better access and soon my juices were flowing so that
when he expertly rubbed my clit, I came almost immediately. My shame came when
I realised that he had done this for me but I hadn�t done anything to ease his
suffering and I knew that he did suffer even if he didn�t show it outwardly.

�My turn!� I lethargically got out of bed
and was faced with his prick jutting out hard and straight from his body. After
being so aroused I wished that I could try and take it in me but it wasn�t
worth the risk at this stage. I did hold it for a few moments though and then
made Sumala lie face down on the bed. My juices still flowed as I rubbed cream
into his whip marks, first those on his back and then the deeper ones on his
arse. I could clearly see how much more ferocious the whip was compared to the
cane and I knew just how bad that was. His scars would be permanent.

Finishing the massage, I took a leaf out
of his book and slipped my hand under his body and gently rubbed his prick. He
turned on his side. �I�ll make a mess on your bed if you�re not careful.� 

His big grin almost melted my heart but
it turned to ice when I heard Roger muttering and caught the word �slut.�

�Silence,� I shouted to him in annoyance,
�Had you been more careful treating me, I would have put cream on you too. Now
you can just sit there and watch. Play with yourself.� He looked shocked at the
suggestion. �That�s right, get hold of your prick and wank yourself off. I�ve
no doubt you�ve done it many times before. Go on do it. That�s an order!� I
watched him give a few tentative rubs and returned my attention to Sumala�s
more substantial weapon. It was already leaking fluid, so I placed it in mouth
ran my tongue around the rim and into the eye. Sumala carefully pulled my body
alongside his and inserted his tongue into my slit and my arousal escalated. I
sucked him vigorously and soon I tasted his sperm while he too brought me to
another climax.

We lay relaxing in that sixty-nine
position for a little while until I noticed that it would soon be lunchtime.
When I pulled away I said loudly enough for Roger to hear, �Thanks Suma, that
was delightful. I take it that part of your new job will be showing me the
things a Tumali woman must do to satisfy a man. There�s a lot I need to learn.�

�It�ll be a pleasure to teach you Miss
Ellie.�

We cleaned up and went for lunch. Roger�s
hands were sticky so I knew he�d masturbated himself too. I knew also that
somehow I had to get him back on my side again but everything I did at the
moment only caused a widening of the rift between us.

&nbsp;

Chapter nine. We start work

Shelumba collected us for lunch. I stood
to eat and so did Roger. There was no way I dared sit on the hard chairs even
if it did make us even more conspicuous but I suspected he could if he wanted
as his bad welts were across his shoulders. Sumala tried to be a macho man and
sat but he found it very uncomfortable and soon he stood alongside me. Part way
through the meal Shelumba waved at a portly middle-aged woman carrying a tray.
She wore a bluestone too and placing her food on our table, introduced herself,
�Hi I�m Riku, head of IT so I�m more or less your boss at work. You must be
Elaine� and Roger� and you are?� She shook hands with all of us and Sumala
introduced himself. �Will you be fit enough for the grand tour this afternoon?�
Riku asked knowing why we were standing even though she hadn�t yet seen our backs.

�As long as we don�t have to sit on hard
seats and can rest when we need to.�

We spent an hour or so looking round our
work place. It wasn�t that much different to home. The computer still ran Word.
Excel and PhotoShop and various other programmes I was familiar with. When I
saw the email icon, I wondered if I would be able to contact Ted or my friends
but Riku quickly told me that she�d had to disable the Internet connection on
our machine. �If you need to do searches or to send an email, I have to do it.
Orders from the big boss,� she said. Roger I noticed had begun to perk up
again. Perhaps it was being in a work environment but I thought Riku was the
more likely cause. Even at that first meeting he seemed to have a rapport with
her albeit she was at least old enough to be his mother.

Tzarma called for me early in the evening
and we went to a smaller restaurant where waitresses served us. I wore a skirt
but no top thinking that the skirt might provide a little protection if the
chairs were hard. Roger was obliged to tag along and I insisted that he wore a
pair of shorts. My not wearing a top wasn�t commented on and in fact, I wasn�t
the only topless woman there but the state of my back certainly brought looks
of horror and even disgust. Of course a fair haired, light skinned woman also
made me the centre of attention, especially with male customers. There was no
doubt in my mind that they were mentally raping me but I felt safe with the
Major.

Later, back in my room, Tzarma removed my
skirt and undressed himself. I was no longer afraid of his prick but I did
worry that he might get carried away and fuck me hard and disturb the fragile
healing of my stripes. �You�re learning fast Ellie,� he commented when I rubbed
his semi-hard prick to a full erection.

�Please take it easy Sir. Try not to hit
my arse too hard.� I needn�t have worried. He laid me bent over the side of the
bed, spread my legs and carefully entered. Each of his thrusts seemed to stop a
hair�s breadth from my bottom flesh and I soon began to enjoy the experience.
In later conversations I found out that he was more concerned with impregnating
me than giving himself or me pleasure. It didn�t bring me to a climax either
but I wasn�t overly concerned. He stayed until a little before midnight and
before he left, had a second insemination session as I then thought of them.

�Would you like to sleep in bed with me
or continue lying on the floor?� I asked Roger when we were alone. He didn�t
answer but came into the bed.

�Mistress? Would you put some cream on my
welts please Mistress?� Roger asked after we�d lain awake for a while.

�Only if you cut the Mistress crap Roger
and only if you do me first. I don�t need you to do what Suma did, just put the
cream on carefully and I will return the favour. We�re on the same side,
remember? I�ll help you, if you cooperate with me.� He didn�t answer but he did
smooth the cream into my skin with great care and I did the same for him. When
finally we lay down again I pushed my body close alongside his and put my arm
around his neck.

We awoke early, showered and used the
toilet while in the same room. Roger had an erection when he first got up and I
was tempted to suck him but I decided that neither of us was really ready for
that. I was still a whore and a slut in his mind and to suck him would only
reinforce that belief and probably disgust him. I think that at the back of his
mind I was still innocent Elaine from London. Perhaps after he�d had a Tumalian
girl, he would think differently. He could ask her but I would also have to
give my permission. Maybe we would meet a young girl at work. They�ll all be
pregnant so he won�t be able to sire a baby.

Nurse Muniba was pleased with my progress
and I knew I could walk easier than yesterday but the sight of my back in the
mirror still horrified me. The yellow purple bruising that covered the whole of
my upper back and arse was overlaid with red stripes that bore black scabs
along much of their length. They gave me a grotesque appearance. I decided to
try the blouse but I had to leave the front completely undone and not use the
tiny cups that should uplift my tits so as not to pull the fabric on to the
welts. Roger�s back showed less severe bruising except at the top and only the
first two top stripes looked angry. I have no doubt they did hurt and if he�d
been the only one to have received the cane we�d have been more sympathetic but
all the time his wounds were compared to mine and Sumala�s which again I
suspect made him feel inferior.

I took my laptop and Riku made us
welcome. She said that we needn�t start on our work if we didn�t feel up to it
but both Roger and I decided that we needed something to occupy our minds and
we should get it into words before the experience faded. On our allotted
computer we found a folder with all the pictures of us that had been taken
since our arrival. There were over sixty Jpegs. This further reinforced our
belief that our abduction was planned long ago and everything that had happened
to us was part of a well thought out plan. �Do you think Ted knew about this
when he appointed us?� Roger surprised me by asking. �Were we selected to work
on Today�s World as a prerequisite for coming here? We always knew that only
one person was needed for much of the work we did.� 

I had to agree with him and commented,
�That raises another unanswerable question. To have recommended us, someone on
the staff at college must be on the payroll here. Who?� We ran through a list
of the staff but couldn�t think which one it could possibly be. �I think we
should start the article at the point where we left college and got jobs at the
magazine. For the first article perhaps going as far as the time we were
arrested.�

�They�ll censor it.�

�Maybe, maybe not. Ask Riku, she seems to
like you.� Roger blushed but went to the other side of the room to speak with
her. It was probably stretching the notion of a chain link but I guessed that
as long as we were in sight of each other, it would be okay. I noticed them both
smile as they talked and then she came over to see me.

�I�m to do the initial censorship and
then it has to go to Major Entembe. I�ve been told to allow everything that is
factual but to delete anything that is pure speculation or even deduction. You
are not allowed to speculate on who organised your being here. As far as your
article is concerned you were sent here in good faith but with an immunity
document that no one so far has accepted. You unwittingly broke some of our
laws and have been sentenced and punished for it. You can describe your
experiences in the most explicit and horrific detail and give full rein to your
feelings but again no speculation about who in our government is behind it
all.�

�So we can write the facts as taken at
face value. Like we were stopped at customs because I didn�t show my tits and
we were punished with the strap because of it. We were then arrested because I
had brought in contraceptive pills and certain items of clothing and Roger
brought condoms and underwear. For that we were imprisoned and flogged. We can
describe all that happened but mustn�t say that the Colonel or even the General
are behind it all?�

�That�s about right. Put in as much
detail as you like of what happened and all the titillating details of life
here especially the sex bits. By all means relate your revulsion at some of the
things we do and your feelings at the severity of the punishment. Don�t be shy
describing all the sex that goes on or I�ll send the draft back to you for a
re-write! Perhaps if you do it well enough it will cause a few of your English
readers to make a few unwanted babies. One of the purposes of your writing is
to encourage white women to come and produce babies for us but we want them to
know exactly what the conditions here are like so we wish you to write about
the bad points as well as the good. We don�t want them to be under the illusion
that they can come and have some free sex with black pricks and go home again.�
Riku laughed and gave a little wave as she left.

One computer between two is a pain so I
set up my laptop and started writing the text. I decided to keep a
password-protected file as my diary and to use it as the basis for the articles
and later for this story. In my diary I could put my thoughts and reasons
concerning the way we were brought to Tumali and happened to us and then censor
it for the articles. Roger always preferred doing the illustrations anyway and
the ones in the folder were straight downloads from the cameras and needed a
fair amount of tweaking before being acceptable for printing. He turned very
pale at times when he saw them and I could understand why. Some of the close-up
pictures were pretty horrific. Sumala came back from collecting his belongings
at the time when Roger was enhancing the pictures of us on the punishment bench
in the customs hall. �Fuck me, they really had it in for you right from the
start,� he remarked with some bitterness. 

He watched us for a while but seemed to
get bored although each new picture that came on the screen renewed his
interest. �Would you mind getting my camera from my room Suma and then you can
start to learn your job or at least the photography bit of it.�

�Yes ma�am.� He gave a mock salute. �And
bring a cushion with you. You don�t have to sit on a hard chair!� I called
after him only to receive another �Yes ma�am� and the salute. One of the good
points about Tumali is the honesty. Perhaps the punishment system, barbaric as
it seemed to me, really worked. No one locked their doors. In fact none of the
doors to any of the in Government House bedrooms had locks. This alarmed me at
first but I was assured that everything was safe and no one, but no one, went
into a room without being invited in. Not even the Major entered my room
without knocking and being told to come in. Perhaps I shouldn�t have been
surprised because every single item, apart from the confiscated ones, in my
luggage was returned and nothing appeared to have been tampered with.

I didn�t really get much writing done
that morning, what with commenting on the pictures and showing Sumala how to
use the camera but by the time lunch time came I felt exhausted. I knew Sumala
was feeling his stripes too after walking several miles to his home, or at
least the place where he last stored his stuff, and back. I gather that he had
a locker in a community house that he used to keep his few belongings in. He�d
had to carry his rucksack in front of him because he didn�t dare chafe the
stripes on his back. Riku sat alongside Roger at lunch and I could see she
fancied him even though she was much older and knew about his wimpishness and
about his prick being on the small side for Tumali. Perhaps I could get a quiet
word with her soon. I did tell her that we were going to rest for a while after
lunch and she gave me a knowing look but didn�t say anything.

I think Sumala was pretty exhausted too
and we both lay together on the bed but neither of us did much sexually except
he stroked my tits and I caressed his prick a bit. Roger lay on the other side
of the bed facing away from us. I�d given him the option of lying there with us
or sitting in the chair and he made a show of reluctance in deciding the bed
was the softer option.

That evening was a repetition of the
previous one. Dinner with the Major early on followed by an insemination
session, period of quiet where we lay close and he mainly asked about my life
and a final insemination about midnight. Roger seemed asleep in the chair so I
very quietly asked the Major if it would be possible to loan him out so that he
could experience Tumali women without being inhibited by my presence. �Have you
someone in mind?� he asked.

�Riku.�

�She�s infertile. Lost her ovaries after
her last child. She doesn�t have so many men now.� He considered my request.
�Yes,� he agreed slowly, �But for the moment, no more than three nights a week
and he is to physically chained to her like you were and be back with you by
breakfast time in the morning. Don�t be surprised if he is shocked by what he
sees.� I didn�t tell Roger.

&nbsp;

Chapter ten. I see the whipping post
again

First thing next morning it poured with
rain. Not the fairly gentle rain such as we normally have in England, but hard,
heavy stair-rods of water that flattened everything in their path. It only
lasted a little over an hour and then the sun came out but for most of the
morning the atmosphere was hot and sticky. It made the sores on my back and
bottom itch but I knew better than to scratch them. Sumala�s did too and
several times I caught him surreptitiously trying to rub his back. I reprimanded
him and received the �Yes ma�am� salute and a broad smile. 

Riku and a number of the IT staff didn�t
come into work until it was all over and things had begun to dry up so for the
first couple of hours we almost had the office to ourselves with only the
overnight staff remaining on duty. Everyone treated it as a normal occurrence
for the time of year. �The main rainy season finished in mid-April but we get
these little rains storms from time to time,� one told me. �We�re okay up here,
its those that live in the valleys that have to worry as they get the run-off
from this plateau.� 

�That was a little rain storm?� The man
smiled and nodded, �In the wet season it could last all day.� I soon noticed
the road below the window that had been awash, was rapidly drying up and after
another hour there was little to show of the downpour.

Muniba was late coming too. We�d decided
she was giving us a miss that day and were at work when she entered the office.
For a few moments she looked at what we were doing and then, in front of
everyone, made us undress and proceeded to examine us. Knowing we were being
watched still embarrassed me a little even though all of staff present had seen
me naked. Perhaps it was the way Muniba was drawing attention to my sorest places
by touching and commenting on them. A flash went off during my examination and
when I turned, Sumala had the camera in his hand and was grinning. �You�re
taking your job too seriously,� I yelled at him but that only drew laughter
from the others and the �Yes ma�am� salute from him. I got my own back when he
was examined and I held the camera.

The nurse seemed satisfied with our
progress and then dropped a minor bombshell. �We need to start you doing some
exercises to work your back and arse muscles a bit.� Many of the staff watched
with a morbid fascination at the sight of our bruised bodies although, when I
looked in the mirror earlier I thought the purple colour had faded a little but
I still walked slightly bent over and with slower steps than normal. The
exercises were like a slow motion gym class. Lifting arms sideways, upwards,
frontwards and bending from the waist and the knees. Several times I was forced
to cry out but she made me continue and several times I heard Sumala groan.
Roger, as we expected, cried out loudly until the whole office including Riku
laughed at him. The exercises made my tits wobble and I guessed that excited
the men. Sumala got an erection, which the nurse flicked painfully a couple of
times, causing him to groan but it went down. �We don�t need that getting in
the way,� she grinned. Some of the girls sniggered and I thought, �That�s worth
remembering if Roger starts getting out of hand,� but when I looked round I
noticed that several of the men in the office had the front of their shorts
pushed forward. Seeing that it was work time, they couldn�t do anything about
it. None of the girls were fazed by the sight and completely ignored it. 

I certainly didn�t feel any better for
the exercises but I suppose they did some good. At least I now knew that I
could move my arms more than I had without doing any damage to my back, even if
it was painful. Worse was to come. �At lunchtime I want you to walk around the
Market Square and back. I�m sure Riku will understand if you have a long lunch
hour. You�re working for an English magazine anyway and can call it research or
something.�

�You want us to walk there and back�?
That�s a mile or more! I can hardly get from our room to here!�

She laughed at my expression of horror.
�Well I suppose I could ask a couple of the guards to march you there at
bayonet point.�

�You�re cruel!�

�No, you might even enjoy it.� I could
hear her chuckling as she headed for the door and then she turned, �And don�t
forget to dress properly!� The rest of the staff were all highly amused and
Riku had to remind them to get back to work.

She proved right again. We did enjoy it
and after the first two or three hundred yards walking became easier and even
Roger stopped complaining. As we neared the square our progress slowed when
people recognising our white skin, stopped to talk with us. Many of them had
witnessed our whipping and frequently showed concern for our welfare,
particularly Sumala�s and mine. Roger though, was pointedly ignored I did feel
sorry for the way they shunned him. I really couldn�t understand the way their
minds worked. A few days previously they had no doubt cheered when the whipping
master laid the cane across our bodies and yet now they were concerned for our
welfare. To my mind it didn�t make sense but I came to the conclusion that they
believed the punishment was necessary but once it was over, everything should
be done to minimise its effect.

I made sure that we took a wide detour
around the whipping post but no one was being punished, even so, just the sight
of it and the surrounding stands, made my blood run cold. We dallied, or at
least I did, at the colourful market stalls and I bought a few small items.
Fortunately one of the girls in the office reminded me to take some money and
before leaving England we had obtained �200 worth of Malawian kwacha, which
were valid in Tumali although they also had their own version of the currency,
rather like Scotland has its own British pound notes. We hadn�t worked long
enough in the IT office to be paid for our supposedly �civil service� jobs.
They worked on the old British system that paid you for the first week when you
had worked the second but Shelumba had given us an advance payment so with that
and what we�d bought from home, we were comparatively rich and could have
probably bought the entire contents of the stall and still had some change. I
wondered if we would be expected to haggle over the prices like in many
middle-eastern countries but Sumala said, no. It seems honesty extended to
market traders and the price they asked was always a fair one.

Almost as we left the square and started
the return journey a woman stopped in front of me. �It�s good to see you�re
able to get about again,� she said. The voice and the face were vaguely
familiar and then it came to me. She was the kind woman who gave me a drink and
the cushion and held me while Roger was being caned. I burst into tears and
gave her a hug while the others looked on with bemused expressions. I of course
thanked her profusely and assured her that I would look for her when we came to
the market again. In turn she invited me to her home and pointed in a direction
that was away from the way we�d come. �Another day,� I told her. Sumala seemed
to delight in being in charge of my camera and took photos of us. 

�What was all that about with Wyche?�
Sumala asked when we were on the way again. I told him and asked about her.
�She�s been barren all her life but in her way she is as good at healing as
Muniba is. Uses herbs and potions she collects from the forests and many prefer
her methods to the modern ones.

Over an hour late we returned to the
office and received a good deal of ribbing as to why we were so late but it was
all very friendly. �Did Suma take you into the forest? Were you arrested for
having white tits? Can we ask the nurse to order us to walk our stiffness off
at lunchtime?� and so it went on.

�Can I ask the flogging master to stripe
your backs to match mine?� I laughed in reply but Riku soon had us working
again. I did indeed feel better for the walk, mentally perhaps more than
physically. My body ached but I felt more alive than I had done since our
arrival. Physically too, I was beginning to feel the redness where the sun caught
my face and the exposed parts of my tits and wondered what to do about it. I
would have to ask one of the girls what sort of cream to get but maybe they
wouldn�t know because they wouldn�t need any on their dark skin. 

We worked steadily after that until it
was almost time to leave. Roger downloaded the pictures from the camera and
recharged the batteries. Generally Sumala had done a good job and I was
particularly pleased with the ones of Wyche, but there were some failures and
Roger tried to show him what to do in future. At least he was becoming more
like his old self now that he was doing a job that he knew and could do well.
I�d tried to get Sumala to record details of his life on my recorder but he
pressed the wrong button and when we checked he hadn�t recorded anything. 

With a few minutes to go before everyone
except the two night duty staff left the office, I sent Roger to fetch Riku. In
a voice just loud enough for most people to hear I asked, �Would you like to
borrow Roger for the night Riku?� Her face showed her disbelief at the question
and Roger�s went from shock to panic to pleasure in bewildered random cycles.

�You can�t let him out of your sight can
you?� Riku stuttered, �The Major��

�The Major gave me permission last night.
He imposed conditions of course. I can only loan him out three nights a week
and whoever I loan him to must keep him on the same chain that I used and he
has to be back in time for breakfast. If you can obey those conditions then you
are welcome to take him with you tonight.�

�You�re telling me the truth? You�re not
joking with me? I don�t want to end up at the whipping post.�

�Check with Shelumba. I daresay the Major
told her.� Riku went to a phone and spoke for a few minutes and came back. �Are
you sure you don�t mind Ellie?�

�No, I�m taking Suma to bed with me
tonight.� There were knowing grins from the others and Sumala looked pleased
too.

�Don�t I get asked about this,� Roger
half-heartedly objected. �No!� Riku and I said together and laughed, as did
everyone else.

�You�d like to go though, wouldn�t you
Roger?� He nodded. �Well there is one condition for you too. You have to do a
written report on your experiences. A detailed unexpurgated report. We want to
know how you lost your virginity. You saw how I lost mine so I want a textual
picture of your initiation into manhood. Take your camera and use it so we can
see some of the things you get up to. Remember, you are chained to Riku just
like you were to me.� I took the cuffs from my bag and fastened one to Roger�s
right wrist and the other end of the chain to his mistress for the night. �I
know it�s not really locked but you have to keep it on all the time. I know
Roger might try and lie to me in the morning but I know you won�t Riku. You can
take it off only for the few minutes it takes to remove your blouse and his
shirt.�

�I mustn�t take it off even when I have
to use the�� Riku surprised me by looking so flabbergasted.

�No.� I hadn�t realised that, although
Tumali women were very free about having sex, they were much more reserved
about their bodily functions.

Sumala wanted to fuck me as soon as we
were in the shower but I suggested that we went to the cafeteria first and then
we could do it and not have to leave the room again until breakfast. He could
have insisted that we fuck in the shower but he acquiesced. Like me he wanted
this first time to be something special. We�d already had to wait for several
days for the ban to be lifted so another hour wouldn�t make much difference.

�Suma, I want to try it the proper way
again like the Major did the first time,� I said when we were again undressed.
�Since the caning, I�ve had to bend over the bed and he did it from the back
but after the walk and sitting on a chair in the cafeteria, I�d like to see if
I can lie on my back and feel you close to me. As long as you�re not too rough
and rub my scabs off, it should be okay.� He seemed uncertain but helped me on
the bed. It was the first time since my whipping that I had laid down that way.
There was some pain but the mattress was soft and I was determined to go
through with it.

Sumala didn�t rush things either. He
played with my tits and kissed my lips and then kissed and licked my cunt until
I was almost screaming for him to stop and fuck me properly. I spread my legs
when I saw him climb on the bed with his hard, black rod jutting from his body.
Only a few days ago I would have been scared shitless (and I would never have
used a phrase like that) at the thought of taking it inside my body. Now I
wanted it; now I craved it. My whole attitude to sex and men had undergone a
complete metamorphosis. Had I become the whore, the slut, that Roger deemed me
to be? I didn�t believe so. I had become a woman, and probably already a
pregnant one if the Major�s sperm had taken. I would have to worry about that
at some time but for now, I wanted Sumala�s prick.

�Put it in me Suma, put it in. Fuck me,�
I cried out. Slowly he entered, all the time watching my face for signs of
pain. �Fuck me,� I cried out again and tried to lift my loins a little. That
was painful and I had to lower myself back on to the bed. Quite gently at
first, Sumala started fucking me but as his fervour increased so did his
thrusts but I too was beyond caring. Yes, there were complaints from my arse,
my back and my shoulders, but in my passion, I ignored them. I knew too that
Sumala�s back was causing him problems but like me he was ignoring them. Soon I
was in the throws of a heady climax. I cried out but the prick continued to
pound the very depths of my cunt until I felt it pause and jerk a little and I
knew then he was sending another parcel of sperm in search of an unfertilised
egg if, by then, there was one.

He collapsed on me but his weight caused
me more pain and I cried out. Immediately Sumala lifted up and apologised. In
he heat of the moment he�d forgotten everything except fucking me. He�d even
forgotten the strain of keeping his own body above mine and the exercises he�d
performed were far more strenuous than those of this morning.

�I know what I am supposed to do now Suma
but give me a moment to recover please.�

�Ellie, I need a few moments too and then
we�ll have to check what damage we�ve done.�

We lay recovering alongside each other
for perhaps ten minutes. My back and arse were sore but I was afraid to move
and turn over to look at what a mess I had made of them. I saw some of Sumala�s
scabs had come off or were loose but perhaps they were ready to fall off
anyway; others, probably the deeper ones, were still firmly in place. The welts
underneath still looked raw. �Come Ellie, turn over. Let me look at you.� I
winced when I raised my body and felt him carefully touch my sorest places.
�We�d better shower again, it will wash off the loose bits and then we can see
what things are really like. The welts seem to be healing quite well but Muniba
might get annoyed in the morning though.�

�Suma, I must do as a Tumali woman would
first.� He understood that I felt obliged to do what was expected in this
country and knelt where I could take his flaccid prick in my mouth and give it
a loving suck.

&nbsp;

Chapter eleven. Roger�s report

Roger strolled into breakfast with a huge
smile on his face but when I asked how he got on, he grinned broadly and said,
�You�ll find out when you read my report and see the pictures.� I suppose as a
bluestone and in command of him, I could have demanded an answer but I didn�t
want to spoil his good mood.

�I expect you two screwed like rabbits
with me out of the way,� he jibed when we were in the bedroom, undressing ready
for the nurse.

�Of course,� I tried to sound nonchalant,
�But it was at a price.� I turned and showed him my back. �I suppose you lost
your virginity?�

�Of course, but I�m sure I won�t be as
sore as you for the next few days.� It made a change for him not to whinge
about his stripes.

Muniba berated us soundly when she came
in, particularly turning her wrath on Sumala but I tried to take my share of
the blame too. Roger stood and smirked and I felt like drawing my fingernails
all the way down his back. Actually the damage wasn�t all that severe but she
threatened to ban Sumala from my bed if he did it that way again for a few more
days. We�d fucked from the rear later that night and again in the morning and
while it was good, there wasn�t the wild ecstasy of that first time.

We weren�t permitted to miss our midday
walk either but at least she gave us the name of a cream I could use on my bare
skin to alleviate the effects of the sunburn. Sumala knew where to get it.
�It�s a local product the girls use for skin care. It�s supposed to keep their
skin soft but I�ve never used it,� he commented.

�You�d need a bucketful!� I joked and we
both laughed. Roger gave me a sour look but I turned away and ignored it.

All morning we worked at our computers
and I was glad of the break when lunchtime came. Roger wanted to carry on and
finish his report but I insisted that he take a break too. 

Sumala took us through a series of side
streets that he said was a short cut and another way to the market square and
indeed we did pass the square on the return journey. The chemist�s shop
reminded me of an old illustration of an apothecary�s abode I�d once seen. No
gaudy plastic containers but there were pots filled with various coloured
creams and liquids, large jars containing raw ingredients and herbs hanging
from the ceiling. A heady, spicy smell pervaded the shop. When I asked for the
cream he knew exactly what it was that I wanted and produced a jam-jar size pot
of it and gave it to Sumala and suggested that he apply if before the sun did
any more harm to my white skin. �It�ll soothe her welts too,� he added,
confirming what I suspected; the whole country knew about my whipping. He
couldn�t have seen my welts at that time.

Kimana, the apothecary, talked while
Sumala put the cream (which Kimana called a balm) on my face and neck and then,
proceeding to fully expose my breasts, massaged it openly into them. All the
while we talked about what the apothecary did and, with Sumala�s help, gained a
considerable amount of information, far more than I would have on my own. I
asked if he would mind if we interviewed him properly later and he agreed. I
made a mental note to take Sumala with me on all such excursions. He was far
better than me at getting people to talk. Roger insisted on having the balm put
on his exposed flesh and I did it for him, mainly to stop him whining all the
way back, but I knew his skin burned as easily as mine even if he did exaggerate
the effects.

We all knew that we were walking better
by the time we returned. Roger continued with his report and I checked and
corrected the next episode of our life here. It ended at the point where the
sentence was announced by the court. Suddenly I burst into tears and started
crying wretchedly. The others thought that it was because I was going to write
about the whipping but all at once homesickness overcame me. I longed to be
back in my safe little world. Without really knowing the cause of my problem,
Sumala lifted me on to his lap, put his arms around me and held me to his
chest. �What will become of us? What will happen to my things at home? Who will
pay the rent on my flat? Will my friends accept me when I have a black baby?�
So I babbled on, wetting Sumala�s shirt with my tears. Roger looked at me in a
helpless way several times but I found comfort in the arms of my Tumalian
friend who probably didn�t understand half of what I was saying. One of the
office girls gave him a paper towel to dry my eyes, which he did very gently,
but it was perhaps a quarter of an hour before I shook the depression off and
could once again concentrate on what was happening around me.� �Thank you Suma,� I finally stuttered. �Thank
you.�

�That�s okay Ellie. Cry as much as you
want and get it out of your system. It must seem so very strange to you but
look on the bright side, two more days and it�s a festival holiday. A special
no work day and a day to get over it.� I tried to find out what was special
about this festival but for some reason everyone just smiled and told me I
would find out on the day. In Tumali they have a most unusual system of work
periods and holidays. There is no seven-day working week, but work periods of
six to twelve days followed by one or more days �holiday.� They still named the
days the same as us but the �weekend� could be on any day. Had not my laptop
had the date and day on the screen, I would not have known which day of the
week it was in England.

Eventually Roger finished his report and
fed it into my laptop so that I could read it without looking over his
shoulder. Sumala pulled his chair close to mine and once more put his arm
around me. We both started to read.

Report to Bluestone Mistress Elaine

�Your pushing your luck Roger, maybe I ought
to put you over my knee for a spanking,� I told him when I read the title but
he knew I didn�t mean it.

�When Ellie offered me to Riku I was
pretty scared but at the same time I was pleased. Ever since the day we met in
the cafeteria, I�ve felt an affinity to her, perhaps because she has a similar
personality to my mother. Not in looks of course. Mother is short and slim
whereas Riku is a large woman in all respects but both have a genuine smile on
their faces when I go to them. Riku�s well developed breasts with their dark
areola and prominent nipples, have always stimulated my attention and I�d often
wanted to feel and suckle them. Knowing what I did already about Tumalian
women, I guessed that I might get my wish. I was scared too, because I knew I would
be taken to an unknown place, to meet people I did not know and do things that
I had only fantasised about. Here, although I resent having Ellie as a boss and
being �chained� to her, she does provide an anchor point in my life. Severing
the invisible chain would leave me vulnerable and would force me to use my own
resources. The reassurance came back when Ellie physically linked me to Riku
and she took my hand and led me out of the building.

We headed towards the market square but
long before we got there, we turned left and followed a narrow road to a
butcher�s shop where she bought a large bag of meat pieces. I�ve no idea what
sort or meat it was but later I found that it tasted very good. The woman
behind the counter chatted with Riku and then asked if I would be man enough
for her. It was an obvious reference to my poor showing at the whipping post
and from the way she looked directly at my shorts, I wondered if she�d been
there and seen that I wasn�t as well equipped as Tumali men. �Size isn�t everything,�
Riku responded, �I�m sure he�ll be more than adequate and I�ll be the first
Tumali woman to sample a white prick in the whole of our community.� She gave
me a hug that almost made me wince. We continued across town for over a mile
until we came to a clearing with a group of large, wooden houses. �This is the
community house that I live in,� Riku said as we entered. It shattered all the
concepts I had of going to a detached brick house to meet her family.

Inside, the room was larger than our
village hall but in many ways it was similar. We entered into a cloakroom area
where there was a selection of coats and muddy boots on one side and a toilet
area on the other. I needed to go but decided not to ask at that time. Riku
held my hand and almost dragged me right through the main room to the far end
where there was an open kitchen area with a large stove like I�d seen in some
restaurants, but this one was wood fired and gave out a great deal of heat.
Even with the doors open at each side of the hall and ceiling fans running it
was very hot. Two women stood at the stove cooking and Riku handed them the
meat. Unlike other women, they didn�t wear an open topped blouse and instead
covered their breasts and front with a large apron to protect their bodies from
splashes. I was introduced but they all knew of me and readily teased Riku.
�What you so old you have to chain a man to keep him now?� �What, the
government give you a toy boy to play with?� �Did you snatch him from that
white girl? Does she know you�ve kidnapped him?� Riku laughed and parried all
their remarks. For a while we were the centre of attention and I wanted nothing
more to do than take Riku to a dark, out of the way, corner.

Of course when we turned round, everyone
else was staring at us too and I started to blush with embarrassment when I
felt my prick start to rise. All talking had ceased when we came in and Riku
held up my chained arm and said, �As I�m sure you�ve guessed this is Roger the
Englishman who is working in my department at the moment and I�ve got him on
loan for the night to teach him some of our ways and for me to find out if a
white prick is any different to those of our men folk. The Major has decreed
that I can only borrow him if I ensure that he doesn�t run away and that is the
reason for the chain. I can only unlink us to remove our shirts and I am going
to do that now in front of you all so you can confirm I have done it properly.
Before work in the morning, and I will have to leave before breakfast time
because he has to be back in Government House by then, I will have to reverse
the process before leaving. At all other times the chain has to stay in place.�


�Even when you shit?� called out one
woman. Riku just nodded. 

While my shirt was being taken off I had
a little chance to look round. An assortment of tables and chairs were
scattered around the area near the stove and further towards the entrance were
a number of easy chairs, settees and office type chairs that had seen better
days but were being used by women and couples. A number of the men and girls
were completely naked but most had a covering on their lower bodies. Some of
the girls were breast feeding babies and as I looked closer, there were always
two babies? �Surely they can�t all have had twins?� No one seemed to mind me
taking pictures of them although Riku�s hand was steadier and she took most of
them.

Riku led me to one girl and on the way I
tried to ignore a well pregnant woman being fucked while bent over the back of
a settee. The girl seemed quite young but I can�t really guess the ages of
Tumalian women yet. �This is Rikub, she�s my fifth daughter and the baby
sucking her right tit is her first born, a boy,� Riku introduced me. �I don�t
know if you�ve found out yet, but we are allowed to keep our firstborn and
every fourth baby after that. I only had seven children before they had to
remove my ovaries. I had a boy first too and he is now living in another
community house. The other baby belongs to another woman but we don�t know
which one. It is a baby that will be sold for adoption and each day Rikub will
get a different second baby to feed so that she doesn�t bond with any of them.
They�ll be offered for sale when they are a few weeks old and photos have been
put on the web. You�ve seen that being done in the office.� 

As you might expect, I was pretty shocked
at that although I knew about it from the information we�d found before we left
and what I�d learned since. I remarked on how unfair it seemed but Rikub
answered, �All the girls and women know what has to happen and only show their
love to the ones they keep. Tumali would soon be over populated if all the
babies we make stayed in the country.�

I still couldn�t comprehend the
philosophy but my need to pee had become urgent and I was forced to tell Riku.
�I�m getting desperate too,� she whispered back, �And it is going to be a first
time for me to do it with a man since I was a child.� 

The toilets were all cubicles, no urinals
for men and were probably fine in size for one person but were a little cramped
for two. �Guests first,� she said. I thought that it would be better if I sat
down but even then I had some difficulty in starting mainly because after
having Riku�s tits in my face since we removed our shirts, I�d started to get
an erection and had to force it down into the pan. She too seemed to find it
difficult to start but I think for her it was more embarrassment, which seemed
a little strange.

My erection returned while she was
sitting and I stood with my loins close to her face. �We�d better go upstairs,�
she said quietly. 

Perversely my prick started to wilt at
the thought that I would have to fuck her. �Would I be able to perform? Would
it shrivel up again? Would I really be man enough for her? Did she believe that
size didn�t matter or did she just say that to placate me?� Such were my
thoughts as she led me up the stairs to the dormitory above the hall. 

It reminded me of pictures that I�ve seen
of army barracks. It was all open plan with a row of double beds along each
wall, seven on each side. On one side of each bed was a large wardrobe and on
the other, a chest of drawers. It seemed that was to hold all the possessions a
couple should need. At the foot of some beds was a child�s cot so I guessed
we�d have to put up with babies crying in the night but in fact it was
surprisingly peaceful. �The beds actually �belong�, if that is the right word
for something provided by the community, to the women,� Riku explained, �Some
men form long term attachments to a woman but even then they are not averse to
moving around. The carved wooden mandala you see hanging on the chest of
drawers was made by a man to show he is attached to the woman whose bed it is.
The younger ones tend to try a different bed each night and not infrequently
visit several beds each night before the curfew.� 

I asked, �Does everyone live in a
community house like this?�

�No. Some do live in their own houses but
it is cheaper to live within a community and I like the company.�

Several beds were already occupied with
couples and in one case two young lads and a girl, fucking or having other
forms of sex. I knew of course, that after a girl was known to be pregnant
intercourse wasn�t limited to vaginal. �This is my bed,� Riku took me to one
about three quarters of the way along the floor. �You can put your shorts and
shirt in the top drawer. That�s the traditional drawer for men and those of us
without a long-term partner, keep it empty. The men have to find a woman that
will accept them into their bed at night but of course, if she doesn�t already
have a mate, in a community house, any man can demand a woman take him in.�

�You don�t have a man wanting you all the
time?� I was genuinely surprised.

�No, but I do get my fair share of
pricks, from old men to youngsters� and now I have a white virgin!� she grinned
and hugged me. We shed our clothes and I could feel he eyes of others on me.
Some were looking at the welts on my back but I think most were checking to see
how a white prick differed from a black one. Knowing what the pricks of the
Tumali men were like, I immediately felt inferior and mine didn�t rise to the
occasion but Riku seemed to understand and pulled me down on the bed and let me
suckle her tits while she gently rubbed her mound against my prick. It had the
desired effect and before I really noticed what was happening, she�s slipped it
inside her cunt and rolled me on top of her. By then I was aroused enough to know
what to do and enjoyed my first fuck. It was pretty warm under the roof so we
both sweated profusely but we just lay there until my prick softened and it
slipped out of her. Imagine my chagrin when I opened my eyes and looked around
and saw two couples sitting on the next bed watching my performance. One had my
camera and was showing the screen to the others.

�Wow! That was a strange sight! Like a
pair of white moons bobbing up and down!� a girl commented and burst into a fit
of giggles. I guess it wasn�t all that white though because some colour still
remains from the strappings we had.� (I was tempted to delete the picture but
thought you might need evidence that I�d lost my virginity Ellie).

Riku kissed me and then unconcernedly
bent down and sucked my soft prick. �We�d better have a cold shower,� she
suggested.

The meal was semi-cafeteria style. No
choice of menu but the ladies had to collect the food from the kitchen area
while the men sat at the tables. A number of children came in and sat at the tables
with their mothers. I had to go with Riku and my standing in line caused a bit
of merriment with the girls waiting and several of them surreptitiously felt my
prick and made it rise again. They weren�t supposed to do that in the food area
and Riku reprimanded one when she saw it but that only caused more giggles.
Further laughter and good-humoured banter came when Riku was part of the
washing-up team and I had to try and keep my end of the chain out of the way. 

Even above the noise and banter, I heard
a little altercation going on in the room behind me but it wasn�t until we all
sat down on the couches that I noticed one of the girls standing beside a man
sitting in an armless office chair. All the children had gone and when I
remarked on it, Riku told me that they had their own huts to sleep in, one for
the girls and another for the boys. Two elders in each hut looked after them.
Only when they �came of age� which had more to do with sexual maturity than
physical years, were the girls given a bed in a community house and the boys
had to find a partner to sleep with. My attention returned to the girl who now
looked downcast and Riku whispered, �Zebu is getting a spanking tonight. She�s
been pushing her luck with Manwe for the last few days so I expect her arse
will smart in a bit. He�ll wait so we can all witness it.� 

For five or ten minutes we all watched as
Zebu stood and became increasingly nervous until finally everyone was settled
and she was ordered to strip off. My uneducated guess said she was several
months pregnant because her belly was beginning to bulge. I noticed a few tears
on her cheeks as she laid herself across Manwe�s lap. �Won�t spanking her harm
her baby?� I asked but Riku assured me that it wouldn�t. �And if she doesn�t
take it properly over his lap she could get worse if they bring the punishment
bench out and use the strap. All the houses have one like you became acquainted
with at the airport,� she added and grinned and me. I grimaced at the
remembrance.

Manwe didn�t spare her either. He hit
hard and it went on for a long while until I could see her arse was completely
a deep red colour over her chocolate skin and her yells had become deep sobs.
No one intervened to stop it and looking round I could see than a number of the
onlookers were sexually excited at the spectacle and were fondling their
partners. To my surprise, Riku put her hand inside my shorts and very gently,
squeezed my prick until it was hard. There was just enough slack in the chain
for me to massage her mound.

Obviously Zebu�s squirming had made Manwe
erect and he ordered her to bend over the back of the chair. In front of us all
he dropped his shorts and forced his prick into the poor girl�s arsehole.
�That�s what the spanking was for,� Riku informed me, �She�s refused him
several times but now she knows that she has to do it or she has a session on
the punishment bench first.� She yelled and cried out at every thrust but it
wasn�t long before Manwe shed his load and made the girl kneel between his legs
to clean him. The very thought of that disgusted me but every one else in the
room seem to think nothing was out of the ordinary. Riku told me afterwards
that it wasn�t compulsory for a girl to suck a prick after it had been in her
arse but she guessed Zebu didn�t want to further anger Manwe by refusing.

Riku and I joined the general exodus from
the room and I fucked her for the second time on her bed. It took me much
longer than the first time and I wasn�t so nervous so could enjoy it more. All
around me I could hear the noises of other couples fucking and no one was
paying much attention to my two white moons. After that I just lay with my head
against her tits and nibbled at her nipples for long while.

Later, we sat downstairs and talked,
mainly about my life in England but I learned something about their ways too.
Before long we were surrounded by a group of youngsters, all eager to learn
about life outside their own country. About 10:30 we went to bed again and I
did notice that it was quite often the girls who decided who was to be their
bed partner for the night. Zebu was a bit cunning. When Manwe was using the
toilet, she grabbed a younger lad and pulled him up the stairs. �Manwe�ll be a
bit upset but he�ll find another woman, probably one of the older ones to sleep
with tonight,� Riku told me, �At least they can�t separate us,� she added
giving our chain a pull. �There�s a curfew from midnight to six in the morning.
We�re allowed to fuck during that time but we must be absolutely quiet so that
we do not disturb anyone.� 

Rikub and a somewhat older man came up
with us. She placed the two babies closely side by side in the cot and the four
of us watched over them until they settled down. By the way they clung to each
other, they could almost have been twins.

Nobody bothered to wear any clothing at
all when they went to the washroom and toilet before settling down for the
night. Riku had to suffer more comments when we used the toilet together but it
was all good-natured and accompanied by much laughter. Our washing caused more
amusement especially when the chain snagged on a tap and again in the melee
around the washbasins when a woman tried to get between us.

�Can I have him before you go to work
Riku please?� A girl probably in her early twenties came to us as we walked
back to our bed. She was one of two women that wore knickers, which seemed odd
until I found out that she�d given birth a few weeks ago and her baby had
already been sold. For a while she was off limits to vaginal sex and could wear
knickers until a week after her next period if she wished but could voluntarily
remove them before then if she felt that she had healed enough. 

�As long as you come as soon as the
curfew is over. I have to get to work early in the morning. You hoping to have
a white baby Sanle?�

�Well it is just possible, I�m due to
give up my knickers shortly.� The pair went on to discus the possibility that I
might impregnate her without ever consulting me. I wasn�t sure that I wanted to
be a father and then have my child sold. I expressed my reservations to Riku.

�You won�t know if you are the father
Roger. I�ve no doubt that you�ll be back home before then and it could make a
difference to the money that she gets. Rikub gets money for her baby but that
is only about half what she will get when a baby of hers is sold. A light
skinned baby should fetch a premium so Sanle will get more if she has a white
one.� I was becoming bewildered by the strange customs and regulations or
perhaps in our terms, �codes of practice�, that kept the community running.

Riku�s comment that I would be home
before the baby was born, made me wonder if she knew more about our stay here
but wasn�t letting on. Most likely it was speculation on her part.

Sanle crawled naked into our bed as soon
as the curfew light went up. I was hardly awake but she very quickly had me
fully hard and, although she was still not as tight as Riku, I soon sent my
seed into her and wondered if I had indeed made a baby. A baby I doubted if I
would ever see. Soon after we had to get up and come back to Government House.�

�Well you certainly seemed to enjoy
yourself,� I commented when I�d finished reading it. �I guess there won�t be a
problem with you going again baby-maker!� 

&nbsp;

Chapter twelve. Raped

We spent much of the remainder of the
day, re-working Roger�s report into a draft article for the magazine. I felt we
needed more background information on the life style of those who lived in the
community and those who had houses of their own. Sumala�s knowledge provided
some of the answers but always they were from a man�s point of view. �What
would if be like if I had gone instead of Roger? Would one man have picked me
out and taken me for the night or would I have to submit to the attentions of
many of them?� These and other thoughts ran through my head and made my vaginal
juices flow uncomfortably. I thought I�d better ask Riku as well but she was
busy.

The Major sent for me late in the
afternoon and invited me to dine with him that evening. Roger had to tag along
of course and, for the first time, he was included in the conversation. It was
mainly about his experiences of the previous night. In front of the Major he
was rather shy and reticent so I had to prompt for information he�d given in
his report. Tzarma could see the thoughts of what Roger had done and what might
have happened if I had been there, were arousing me again.

We retired to his room. �I believe you
can now lie on you back and be fucked?� he stated a question. 

�Yes, but I still have to be a little
careful otherwise I�ll open the welts and Nurse Muniba will reprimand me
again.�

�I�ll be careful enough.� For the first
time since my caning he took me in the normal way and after the previous
conversations I enjoyed him and climaxed readily. I didn�t care that Roger was
watching and was mentally calling me a slut. Or perhaps after last night, he
wasn�t? Perhaps now that he was no longer a virgin, he wouldn�t consider me a
whore?

After Tzarma had come and I�d done the
routine cleaning we lay together. �Our talk at the dinner table turned you on
didn�t it Ellie?� I admitted that it did. �Were you wishing that you had gone
as well?�

�Yes and no. I�m not sure. I wouldn�t
have minded going as an observer and talking to the girls there but I�m not sure
that I would wish to be part of the community and under their rules. It would
be nice to get some more background info though.�

The Major was quiet for a long time and I
had an uneasy feeling that he was going to make me experience the life there as
it was. I was right. �Ellie, you came here to get first hand experience of our
life and I see it as part of my job to make sure you get it. However, I know
that if I just sent you to live in a community house, because you are white and
therefore different, every man in the whole community would want to have you.
You would be fucked continuously and that would not give you the right
experience of our life. Most girls do not get fucked more than three times in a
night, more likely it is once. The other thing I have to consider is your back.
I do know that most men would be considerate at least until they got carried
away, like I gather Suma did, and then you could end up with an infection or
worse especially as the beds there might not be as clean as this one.�

I had to wait for the longest time for
him to pass sentence. It was almost as bad as waiting for the judges to give
their verdict. �Tomorrow after work, you will physically chain yourself to
Roger again and go with Riku. Sumala will go with you to give you a little
protection but he won�t stop any of the men doing what they have a right to do.
No one will touch you while you are chained to Roger but they will expect the
two of you to fuck. When you get inside the building, you may transfer the
chain from your wrist to Riku�s or any other girl you wish. He must remain
chained to a girl the whole time and be in her charge, but it doesn�t have to
be the same one all the time. Once you are free of the chain, you are free to
be fucked by any male but to prevent a stampede I will ask Suma to spin the
bottle or use some other random method of choosing three men to service you.
You will not know who it is until they take you to your bed. The last one will
spend the night with you but will leave when the curfew ends in the morning and
then you can choose one out of those around you to fuck you until breakfast.
During the day, which is a holiday, you can go with Sumala and any others, to
the festivities. On your return Sumala will again arrange for three more to
fuck you until the curfew. All three of you must return here for breakfast
before work on the following morning. I may change the rules slightly when I�ve
thought them over a little more and discussed them with Riku and Sumala but
that�s the basic plan.�

Slowly the ramifications of what he said
began to sink in. We were going live in the community house for three nights
and I would be fucked by at least ten men � or I could leave the chain to Roger
on and just have him. I was beginning to feel fewer objections to him fucking
me but he could do that any time I let him. But could I be so adventurous as to
allow myself to throw myself to any man, old or young, ugly or handsome, that
was chosen by chance?

When I discussed it with Sumala he was
adamant that I let myself go. �I will be there and if it looks likes you are
suffering too much, I�ll use my position as your official protector and step in
but you need to experience a few more pricks than mine and the Major�s. You�re
probably pregnant now anyway so �play the field� I think your English
expression is.� 

Roger was also keen to sleep with Riku
again but next day when I spoke to her out of Roger�s earshot, she said, �Yes,
do that and then I will pass him on to another young girl who is desperate to
have a white baby and she�s due to have her knickers removed tomorrow.�

�Sanle?� She nodded.

The day dragged and like Fridays at home,
people started to pack up a little earlier than usual and sat around talking
and teasing me as to what might happen to me both in the community and at the
festival but in the end work finished and we set off. I�d packed a small bag
with our stuff and made Roger carry it. He didn�t seem to mind and I think he
was trying to impress Riku.

�Should we get any food or anything on
the way?� I asked Riku, �There�ll be three extra to feed tonight and tomorrow.�

�That would be appreciated. No one would
say anything if you didn�t but we are a fairly poor community. I earn more than
any of the others and the younger girls bring in an income from their babies
but we�ve quite a few older men and women too. All try and contribute either in
goods or by the work they do. Don�t try to pay anyone in the community, they
would take it as an insult. Perhaps some meat like I bought when I took Roger.
Meat is relatively expensive here although by your standards, it is extremely
cheap.�

In the end we bought a large piece of
local deer meat that Riku said would make it seem like a real festival and
which did indeed caused the cooks to give us a hug. Unfortunately one hugged a
bit too hard and I involuntarily gave a little cry. The woman apologised and
told me to remove my blouse so she could see if she�d done any damage. I think
she really only wanted to see what my back looked like. Before long my skirt
was lifted and everyone was examining my arse as well.

Again this strange dichotomy. While I was
at the whipping post they probably cheered, now they were concerned for my
well-being. Normally now I could sit and lie without too much discomfort
provided the seat was soft, but the welts were still ridged and showed clearly
red with yellow- purple bruising around them.

For the time being I kept Roger chained
to me so I wouldn�t be interfered with while I was introduced to various
people. The fact that he was chained to me and had to do my bidding seemed to
amuse them although apparently it was different when he was chained to Riku
during the last visit. Riku was an older woman and in a known position of
authority whereas little was known of me except that I had a bluestone and I�d
taken my whipping without passing out. To safeguard my position, I knew I would
have to act like I was the boss in our relationship. 

A younger girl wearing knickers I rightly
guessed was Sanle, kept close to us throughout our little tour but she didn�t
introduce herself. Sumala kept with us too although I noticed he kept looking
at the girls cleaning the tables. A twinge of jealousy went through me but I
dismissed it as he wasn�t really a true boyfriend and I was going to be fucked
anyway.

Upstairs, Riku showed me the bed I would
use and I made Roger put our stuff away before I released him to Riku who
promptly called Sanle over and fastened the chain to her. Her smile lit up the
whole room and she hugged and kissed Riku and then me. Seconds later she dragged
Roger to her bed and it wasn�t long after his �white moons� were bobbing up and
down. A look of disappointment crossed Riku�s face and I murmured, �There�ll be
other times,� and she nodded. �The dust has got into my sores again and they
are beginning to irritate me so I�ll have a quick shower and come down and help
with the preparations,� I told Riku. I didn�t want to be seen shirking whilst
everyone else was busily getting the preparations under way.

Free of the chain now and with Roger
being Sanle�s responsibility, I went and had a long shower. Much more primitive
than at Government House but I felt good to wash some of the dust and grit from
my body. Returning to my bed with just a towel around my hair suddenly I was
swept off my feet and dumped unceremoniously on the mattress, causing me to cry
out as the stripes on my arse and back felt the impact. My assailant, a rather
ugly looking man in his forties I would guess, promptly dropped his shorts and
held his prick ready for action.

�Open your legs,� he ordered, �Suma says
there is time for two or more of us to fuck you before dinner and I�ve got
first go.� I knew I had to try and do as he said but I wondered at �two before
dinner?� The Major had said, three before curfew and that was a long time yet.
Had Sumala changed it on his own initiative? Or had the Major rethought his
plans? I wasn�t given any time to prepare myself. His prick found my entrance
and forced its way into my dry channel. It hurt but he didn�t seem to care. 

�Yes you little white bitch, that�s how
women in your country should be. On your backs all the time ready to take one
cock after the other until your tight little cunt is full of spunk and
overflowing.� He rammed into me hard and forcefully without any regard for my
pleasure. I looked around to see if Sumala was at hand but only saw three other
men who appeared to be waiting their turn. Roger and Sanle had disappeared and
the bedroom door was shut. They were going to rape me - except there was no
such thing as rape in this country. Women of child bearing age are all
available for fucking.

�Go on give it to her. Give her the hard
fucking she came here for,� one of them urged. I smelt alcohol on his breath
and knew that to be an illegal substance here but didn�t have time to digest
the implications.

I screamed and struggled but that only
resulted in my mouth being stopped with some rag and my tits being squeezed
painfully hard. Something was seriously wrong. This wasn�t supposed to happen
and Sumala was supposed to oversee what happened and protect me. The man
continued to force his prick into my sore vagina as hard as he could while two
of the other men pulled my legs back to my shoulders stretching the skin around
my welts and causing to cry out. All four men were now grinning at my
predicament and encouraging the one fucking me to shoot his load so they could
have their turn. Eventually he did but there was no waiting and the next man
took his place. With my cunt lubricated with my juices that were beginning to
flow and the man�s sperm, the second prick went in easier but it seemed that he
still wanted me to hurt and rammed it home as hard as he could and made his
loins painfully hit my tender buttocks.

Meanwhile the first, still messy prick
was offered to my mouth. I resisted but two hands twisting my nipples caused me
to open my mouth so the gag could be removed and the prick pushed in. I didn�t
dare bite it. Soon the second rape was over but my ordeal was not.

�Tumali women who resist when a man wants
to fuck them are punished. You�re here to find out about our lives so you must
be punished too. Turn her over boys,� the third man ordered. �You had a nice
taste of the cane earlier and that still looks raw and tender but I guess a
good hand spanking won�t do any real harm.� They manhandled me into the
position they wanted and two of them held me kneeling on the bed with my arse
raised and my knees spread. I was totally vulnerable and at their mercy. They
had none. Even before they started spanking, I could feel the pain in my arse. The
position they held me in again stretched the skin taut and I wondered if any of
my welts would open and start bleeding again. By now I was sobbing but with my
head forced into the pillow, my cries were muffled.

SLAP!! SLAP!! SLAP!! SLAP!! SLAP!! SLAP!!
SLAP!! SLAP!! SLAP!! SLAP!! SLAP!! SLAP!!�
The blows came hard and fast and on my already tender arse. I screamed
and screamed but little was heard outside my head. I felt myself fading but
they must have realised that too because the spanking stopped and I felt
another prick enter me. The pain again was pretty horrific as the man thrust in
as deeply as he could and made a point of grinding his pubic hair on my raw
arse. Fortunately it was over quickly and he withdrew. 

They didn�t dare get me to suck them at
that moment because of the way my jaws were working and crying out but that
didn�t stop them rearranging themselves so the fourth man could have his turn.
In a hazy daze I felt his prick enter and then withdraw. �Shit, what a mess
you�ve made inside her, I guess I�ll just have to open her other hole.�

�No!� I managed to yell and move a
little.

�Oh yes white girl, time for an arse
fuck.� I felt his prick start to enter and I thought I just could not stand any
more pain. My body started to give in. Vaguely I heard a crash and shouting and
fighting going on around me but for the moment I was out of it. 

�It�s okay now, we�re here and they�ve
been taken away.� Sumala held me cradled in his arms and Riku stood by my side
holding my hand. Most of the community were around the bed and looking on. Some
of the girls were crying. �There are a few groups of bandits in the forest and
they must have come here for the festival and heard about you. We were all busy
preparing the meal and setting the lights outside so we didn�t notice them come
in. It was only when Sanle wanted to bring Roger up here again and found the
door jammed that we knew there was trouble.�

It took a little while for me to calm
down but after a drink of some painkilling liquid and for balm to be smoothed
on my arse I began to feel like facing the others. When I recovered a little
Sumala carried me to the dining area and sat me on several cushions to the
applause of the crowd. The meal was delicious although I found the meat very
rich for my taste but I ate some. My bottom once again caused me to fidget and
as soon as I could I went and lay on the bed. I told Riku and Sumala that I�d
like a little peace and quiet for a while and they agreed but Sumala insisted
on someone being in the room all the time and Riku would look in on me as well.


Rikub was upstairs breast-feeding her
baby and the other one she was wet nursing, and when she�d finished I got to
hold hers for a while. �Will my baby be a darling like this or a snotty bawling
brat?� I wondered. Almost everyone was dancing on the grass outside but I knew
that I didn�t dare try that, not with my arse as sore as it was. Luckily none
of the welts had opened until they bled but they�d swelled up. I could hear the
rhythm of the drums and music outside and was almost tempted to go down but I
didn�t wish to move again.

A little later Sumala came in with a lad,
probably less than twenty years old. �This is Maevu,� he introduced, �He won
the right to be first with you tonight but he knows you won�t be fit enough to
fuck right now so he�s asked if he can just lie and talk with you and perhaps
comfort you a bit. I�ve agreed and it will be nice for you to have a new man
for company.�

Maevu smiled broadly. �I�ll look after
you.� It didn�t seem that I had any choice in the matter, and yes, he looked a
trustworthy lad for all I could tell from outward appearances. For a little
while I lay gathered in his arms and then he half carried me into the shower
and allowed cold water to run over my arse to take some of the fire away before
he gently put more of the balm on. Of course, he had an erection but he made no
move to force it in me and in fact, carefully cuddled and kissed me. We talked
a little on what he did for a living and my life and I rubbed his back and
thighs but deliberately left his prick alone. I didn�t want anything to do with
that � or did I? Riku, Roger and others came in to see how I was and to bring
me a little juice and fruit but no one separated us.

It must have been quite late because
several older women had come to bed when I decided that I had teased poor Maevu
enough. The fire in my arse had eased and his kisses by that time had aroused
me and my cunt was wet. �You really are a slut,� I told myself, �After being
brutally raped and beaten you�re so wet you want another prick. You�re
disgusting girl!�

�Roll on to your back Maevu, I want to
lie on top of your body and maybe�� He did and slowly I worked my way down on
to his prick. For quite a while I just allowed it to rest inside me but ever so
slowly I began working myself on it. My muscles hurt but not so badly that it
would force me to stop and I didn�t, at least not until I had yet another load
of sperm inside me.

Sumala came in with a young girl and
checked on me. At the time I was resting with Maevu�s prick still inside me.
�You will make a good Tumalian one day,� he laughed. �Take good care of her
Maevu.�

&nbsp;

Chapter thirteen. The festival

I woke early but I knew breakfast would
be late. Needing to pee, I hobbled painfully to the toilet and wondered if I
would ever be free of pain again. There hadn�t been one day since I landed when
I could more freely and could run or jump without many of my muscles
protesting. My arse hurt but it was nothing like as painful as after the strap
and the cane so I suppose that was something to be grateful for. On the way
back I met Sanle dragging Roger along. She giggled when she saw me. �You can
pass him back to Riku or give him to another girl,� I said to her.

�No way. I�m keeping him until you have
to take him back! Even if I have to poop alongside him!� She smiled broadly and
Roger didn�t seem too displeased.

Maevu was awake when I returned to bed.
Tentatively I tried lying on my back and found I could do so without too much
pain. My arse was definitely very tender but it wasn�t unbearable and perhaps
one of the good things about my stay was that my sexuality had come out. �Play
with me and then fuck me Maevu, but be gentle please,� I whispered. He did and
was very careful until I became fully aroused and told him to do it properly.
Shortly afterwards I almost regretted telling him that as his thrusts rekindled
the pain in my bottom but I knew I�d withstood a lot more pain and I was only
giving Maevu what he deserved.

We showered and when I returned to the
bedroom, I was most surprised to find Nurse Muniba standing there. �So you�ve
got yourself into more trouble and I have to come all this way on a festival
day to sort you out!� She tried to make her voice sound severe but it didn�t
quite work and she�d hardly finished the sentence before she broke out into a
smile. �Not too much extra damage,� she announced when she�d examined me. �Just
don�t get yourself into any more trouble at the festival. I thought that Sumala
was supposed to be looking after you?�

�He is when he�s not chasing other
women,� I teased knowing that he was awake and listening, �But how did you find
out?�

�They brought the four men into the
prison and charged them with having consumed alcohol, which is an illegal
substance. I guess they�ll have a turn at the whipping post when the court
convenes tomorrow. They didn�t actually do anything else that was illegal.
Fucking a woman and spanking her for resisting is not a crime but as you are
sort of under the Major�s protection, I wouldn�t mind betting the court will be
pretty severe with them.� Turning to Sumala she went on, �You�d better tread
carefully with the Major too when you get back. He wasn�t too pleased with what
happened.�

It was painful to walk down the stairs to
breakfast and sitting on a hard chair caused more discomfort. �I think I�ll
give the festival a miss,� I announced to the others but they would not hear of
it and insisted that I go with them. 

Sumala was particularly insistent. �I�m
not staying behind to baby-sit you just because you�ve a bit of a sore arse.
Today is a proper festival day, not just a day off work type day and there�ll
be lots going on and things for you to see and do. You�re coming whether you
want to or not!� 

�What�s so special about this festival
then?� I asked for the umpteenth time.

�You�ll find out later.� Sanle had told
Roger but no one would tell me. With everyone ganging up on me, I had little
choice and in the end I was glad I went although I came back very sore yet
again.

About a dozen of us, mainly younger age
group people, walked slowly to Chapoti market square. At first I complained
about the pain in my arse but the others only laughed and I realised that I was
�doing a Roger� and stopped my whining. As usual, after moving for a short while,
the pain eased and as we became part of an increasing crowd, so I more or less
forgot about it.

To my surprise and delight the whipping
post, had been removed and in its place an animal, I guessed to be a wild boar,
was being roasted over an open fire. All around people were dancing, many of
them in colourful tribal costumes, to the heady rhythmic beat of drums and a
strange stringed instrument about the size of a base guitar but which was only
a box with a pole and a string. Despite the apparent crudity, it made a deep,
resonant sound. The women wore brightly decorated headwear and skirts and
danced bare breasted; the older, less firm ones flopped in all directions and
combined with the erotic movements, I rightly deduced that this was some sort
of sex festival. �It is to celebrate fertility rites and a lot of mating will
be done today so be prepared,� Sumala finally informed me.

All our feet began stamping in time with
the drums and before long we�d linked arms and were dancing and laughing, my
sore arse forgotten until I collapsed and sat down hard on the ground. I was
extremely thirsty and dying for a drink by that time but so it seems were most
of the crowd and the stall selling flavoured water was surrounded and unable to
cope with the demand. We joined those struggling for a position where we could
catch the attention of the servers but it looked a hopeless task.

�Would you like to come to my home and
have a drink with me?� I turned and came face to face with Wyche. I gave her a
hug and gratefully accepted her offer but pointed out that there were now six
of us in a little group. Besides Roger and I and our partners, Maevu had tagged
along with a slightly younger girl, N�Boro.

�That�s no problem, Ellie, I�ve my
assistant with me too. I don�t think you�ve met Veo.� She introduced us to an
attractive girl perhaps a few years older than me.

�Hello Ellie,� she smiled hugely and gave
me a hug and did the same to Roger. I expect she knew the others because she
just nodded a greeting. 

We followed her to a fair sized wooden
building to the east of the town but only about half a mile from the market
square. Inside it was cool and I was glad of the respite from the heat and once
my eyes had become accustomed to the lower light level, I saw the whole of the
ground floor was one large room. Plants hung from every conceivable space; from
the ceiling joists, from the wall studding and from frames erected across one
end of the room. The indefinable mix of smells was like a very overpowering potpourri
that pervaded the place and seemed to even enter our heads. I took a number of
photos and I noticed Roger using his camera too. Wyche gave us a quick tour. We
saw the various mortars and pestles she used to grind the dried herbs, the
little furnace for melting and breaking down minerals, the decorative clay
bowls used for mixing the ingredients and the little round wooden boxes used
when she sold balms and salves.

�I�m sorry,� she apologised, �You came
for a drink and not to learn my business. Suma and Maevu, would you mind
bringing those pitchers upstairs, and then we can drink and talk in more
comfort.�

Upstairs I found a similar miss-match of
chairs and couches to those in the community home and to everyone�s amusement,
I managed to choose a hard spot on an apparently soft seat. My little yelp
caused everyone to laugh and I had to retell the story of my rape and spanking,
although none of them considered it rape. Wyche looked thoughtful at the end
but at the time didn�t comment. I asked about Veo.

�Veo, like me, is a childless woman,�
Wyche explained, �Maybe in the past somewhere we have the same ancestor but who
can tell? Maybe if we had one of the modern DNA tests that would reveal it, but
we have the same physical defect, neither of us has ever had a menstrual
period. It seems we were born without ovaries and the ability to produce eggs
or at least our ovaries didn�t develop at puberty. My predecessor was the same
and I learned the art of making healing potions from her and now I�m training
Veo. That way we can be useful members of the community. Oh, we�ve both been
fucked often enough but without any eggs inside us, there was never any hope of
pregnancy and men only now fuck us for pleasure. Many steer clear of us
believing we are witches or have some magic but they come quickly enough when
illness takes them. Are you pregnant yet?�

�Probably. I�m several days late with my
period.�

Wyche paused and again looked
thoughtfully at me. �Will you be going into the park later?� she asked.

�Yes,� Sumala answered for me.

��I
don�t know. What happens in the park?� I caught the smiles that spread across
the faces of the natives when I gave my reply.

��I
have already told you this is a fertility festival Ellie,� Sumala could hardly
suppress his laughter, �What we didn�t tell you was there is a sort of orgy in
the park later on. We weren�t going to tell you until we were in the park and
you couldn�t chicken out.�� The others
thought it a huge joke but I wasn�t too pleased.

Sanle shared my concern but for a
different reason. �Roger and I are not going,� she stated, �I�m not having him
waste his sperm on any girl that thrusts her cunt in his face. He�s mine and
mine alone until he has to go to work the day after tomorrow.�

Sumala put his hand on my shoulder, �I�m
here to look after you Ellie and to see you experience all aspects of our
culture and I will be taking you in the park even if I have to carry you
there.�

�And we�ll help you Suma,� Maevu averred.
All the younger ones thought this a source of some merriment but Wyche was more
serious.

�Ellie, am I right in thinking that you
are already rather tender internally after your experience last night?�

�Sore, is a better word.�

�Well I can give you a lotion that will
help and maybe�� She stopped in mid sentence as though debating whether or not
to offer something else. Finally she came to a decision. �I will give you a
cream that will stimulate your clitoris. You only need the smallest amount and
it will stand out hard and make you so very aroused that you will enjoy the
fucking and not want it to stop. It should last for about four hours. It won�t
kill the pain, but it will increase your enjoyment tenfold. The downside is
that when the effect wears off you will be left with more soreness than you
have now.� She went downstairs and came back with a tiny wooden box containing
a pink cream. �Only put on a smear from your little finger and put it on
shortly before or soon after entering the park. It only takes a few minutes to
act and then you�ll feel randy enough to take on the whole town. Of course it�s
up to you whether you use it or not. Don�t let the men put it on you; they�re
much too heavy handed.� I took the tiny box and a bottle of lotion and thanked
her.

�Is there something for men that does the
same thing?� Sanle grinned.

�Yes, but it works a little differently.
Men can only produce so much sperm each day. How much depends on the man. The
cream gets a man hard and keeps him that way, however, after shooting his seed
for the first couple of times, there will be little living sperm left in his
testicles although the seminal fluid will still shoot out. I can guess why you
want it Sanle but do remember that after two or even only one fuck, you will
have drained most of his live sperm from him for a day or two. The longer you
leave it before you let him fuck you, the more sperm he will have in his
reserves. I daresay you�ve already tried to drain him as much as you can.�
Wyche smiled and Sanle nodded.

�Will you let me have some Wyche please?
I really would like a light baby like that French girl.�

�Yes, and you can pay me for it when you
get the extra premium a light baby commands.�

It was the first I�d heard of a French
girl. �I thought I was the only white girl in Tumali?� 

�Well you�re certainly the whitest as the
Frenchie has been here several years and is well tanned. Her skin was more
olive colour to start with and even if you get a tan, you�ll never be as dark
as her. She lives with a local man in a small village right on the borders with
Malawi. Maybe you should see if Suma will take you there and get her story.
It�s an interesting tale.�

�I just go red and peel, like the tops of
my tits are doing now. The skin cream I bought has only limited effect.�
Everyone stared at my tits.

�Wear a wide brimmed hat and ask Riku if
you can have some high factor sunblock sent from England. You won�t find it in
Tumali as we have no need of it. Muniba might be able to use her influence if
the Major proves an obstacle.� 

We sat and chatted for a while longer and
then returned to the market square. They were starting to carve the roasted
boar but with the crowds around we decided to wait awhile before struggling to
get our piece. N�Boro, who hadn�t spoken a great deal but who laughed a lot,
took my hand and led me to a side stall with a huge selection of hats in garish
colours. Much to the dismay of the men, it took us nearly half an hour to
decide on a suitable one, one that had a very wide brim and outlandish colours.
For a while I posed for erotic photos, some with me on my own and others with
various members of the group. Afterwards it was back to the festivities.

The dancing continued for much of the
afternoon and then towards evening, most of the younger age group and some of
the older ones too, made their way to the park. �The park was laid out when the
British ruled here,� Sumala informed me, �Supposed to be like parks in England
but they had to use different trees.� Indeed it was not unlike our parks even
to the extent of having stone pillars topped with heraldic lions on either side
of the ornate wrought iron gates. Today there were men manning the gateway to
prevent any young children entering.

Sanle and Roger returned to the square
but Sumala held my hand and almost dragged me inside, much to the amusement of
Maevu and N�Boro. Perhaps the nearest I can describe the scene is to liken it
to Brighton beach on a sunny August bank holiday, the main difference being
that the couples were actively copulating. Much of the grass area was already
taken but Sumala found us a shady spot although the size we had to ourselves
was little greater than a couple of double beds. For a few moments I sat and
reflected on the amazing changes that had occurred in me during the short time
since leaving England. A few weeks ago I would have been horrified at the
sights around me, now I willingly prepared to take part in an orgy. 

�Do you want to use Wyche�s stuff Ellie?�

�Yes, but I�m not letting you put it on
Suma!�

�I can put the lotion on though!� Sumala
grabbed the bottle and poured a little into his hand and used a finger to work
it inside my vagina. Meanwhile I massaged a small amount of the ointment around
my clit. It felt warm on the skin and soon my clit hardened and began to itch
slightly making me want to rub and finger it.

�Is it working?� N�Boro asked. Maevu had
already his prick inside her and was thrusting hard and fast. Sumala turned me
and opened my legs so she could see. �Wow! Just look at the way that sticks
out. Will you let me try some when Maevu�s done? I want to be nice and ready for
when the marauders come.�

I too could see how hard and red the
little nub was, not only that, I could feel the fire within it building up my
arousal until I could bear it no longer and yelled like some wanton slut, �Fuck
me Suma, fuck me!� I didn�t care that my vagina was still rather sore, I didn�t
care that my spanked arse was on hard ground, I didn�t care that Sumala�s
thrusts would aggravate the pain further, I just wanted, no needed, to be
fucked. He did so without the niceties of the nights we spent in Government
House. His thrusts were hard and deep and I forced my loins to meet his with
animal ferocity. I climaxed and climaxed again. Whatever was in the ointment,
it sure turned me on. I became an insatiable and shameless woman.

All too soon Sumala finished and rolled
to one side. Maevu had finished too and N�Boro was sucking him. I did the same
for Sumala but it wasn�t enough for me. I wanted another prick or two or three.
The others could see my agitation and Maevu fingered me while N�Boro put a little
of the stuff on her clit. �Don�t worry Ellie,� she said, �The marauders will be
around soon.� It was the second time she�d used the term.

�The marauders,� Sumala explained, �Are
mainly young men who come into the park soon after the men with partners have
finished their first fuck. Any woman, who doesn�t have a prick inside her, is
summarily fucked by whoever finds her. Usually a little after then, people like
me who have recovered from their first fuck, look around for another woman to
put their prick in. As you said earlier, it is an orgy. Anyone who is fertile
should get pregnant tonight.�

A loud whooping announced the arrival of
the marauders. The men, lads really, seemed young although with their painted
faces and bodies it was difficult to tell. I noticed N�Boro grabbed Sumala and
dragged him over her and managed to get him hard enough to go inside. A young
naked lad spotted me and with more whooping leapt between my open legs and
without any notice or warning began fucking me fast and furiously. Unfortunately
he didn�t last very long but Maevu was hard again and he took over and with him
I again orgasmed several times.

I blamed the ointment but for a long
while after, I wondered if I really was a whore at heart because I openly
offered myself to any man that passed by with even half an erection. I lost
count how many times I was fucked, I lost count of the number of orgasms I had,
before the crowds began to thin and the effects of the clit stimulant began to
wear off.

Sumala came to me and gently pulled me to
my feet. �It�s time we went back Ellie.� I found my hat, purse and camera, put
my arm around his waist and wearily walked back to the community house.

&nbsp;

Chapter fourteen. My pregnancy
confirmed

Our bed in Government House was much
softer than the one in which I�d spent the previous two nights and yet I
couldn�t sleep. Roger lay alongside me and even though he faced away from me, I
knew that he too was awake. He�d been quiet all day and had said almost nothing
about what happened between him and Sanle after we�d left them. Sumala was in
his own room, or at least I supposed that he was. Even after a day of rest my
cunt was far too sore to think about having him fuck me that night. I hardly
dared to wipe myself let alone take his prick inside me. I think he understood
and just lay with me in my bed the last night at the community house. I
wondered if N�Boro was in a similar state or whether she was more used to being
gang-banged. Yes, that was the right term for it. One fuck after another with
little time to recover between them. Wyche�s ointment certainly worked and I�d
had more orgasms in one evening than I had ever thought possible but now I was
paying the price. Oh God, was my cunt sore. I wanted to rub it but it was too
tender even for that even with the copious amounts of cream I�d applied. Roger
looked really disgusted with me when he watched and almost smirked when I
winced each time I touched my clit. Even after losing his virginity, he still
had a �holier than thou� attitude towards me. �Will he ever lose his
inhibitions?� I wondered. Perhaps it was just a man thing whereby he could fuck
any girl he wanted, but girls had to remain chaste.

My thoughts were disturbed when I heard
him give a little sob and I guessed his mind was reliving the events of the
other day. �What happened to make him so sad? I thought he enjoyed being with
Sanle.� More sobs. I went into mother mode and turned him to face me. �Didn�t
you want to leave Sanle and come back here?� I asked quietly. No answer. �Did
she overdo it?� I�d seen his prick and noticed it was rather red but not as raw
as it had been yesterday. No answer. Putting my arms around him and pulling him
close to my breasts, I let him cry on my shoulder until I felt his tears
trickling down my neck. Gently I pushed him away and kissed his forehead.
�Roger,� I tried to sound stern. �Tell me what happened yesterday. You�ve been
told what happened to me and although you think I�m a slut, you know what I did
and although I�m very sore, I don�t regret it. You�ve kept what happened to you
bottled up inside yourself and it�s upsetting you. Whatever you did cannot be
worse than what I did. Did Sanle offend you? Did she act like a slut too?�

I was about to give up on getting an
answer when he lifted his head. �No, it wasn�t Sanle. Yes, she did act
sluttishly but I knew the reason why she was doing it and I enjoyed fucking her
especially after she�d put that stuff on me. I almost couldn�t help myself and
it seemed that my prick was controlling my mind. No it wasn�t that.� There was
a long pause before he continued. �Ellie, I know my prick is small even
compared with some white people but they needn�t have poked fun at me like
that. Not in front of her.�

�Who Roger?�

�Those young fellows with painted bodies,
the ones you called the marauders.� Another long pause during which I wished I
had the ability to read his mind. �We stayed around the square a little while
after you left and then started back. I knew Sanle really wanted another
session with me but after what Wyche said, was trying to wait as long as she
could. We�d hardly left the square when we came across a group of those youths
getting ready to go into the park. �What are you doing with that white wimp
Sanle? You need a man with a proper prick. He�ll pass out halfway through a
fuck. That tiny little grub won�t satisfy a woman like you.� They taunted me
and I cringed and almost hid behind Sanle. I felt like I was really a sissy,
hiding behind a girl when I should have been standing in front of her and doing
my best to offer protection but I couldn�t seem to help myself. It was she that
protected me and laughed at them. �I can have pricks like yours any time but
this one can�t get away,� she showed them the chain, �And I�ve only got him for
a short while so I�m going to make the most of him. You go into the park and
have your fun with the others. You might even get to try out a white cunt.
Ellie�s there.� They continued to make disparaging remarks about me and boasted
of what they would do to you and I suppose that upset me too. I didn�t like
them talking about you like you were just a slut anyone could have at
anytime.� Sanle fielded their remarks
with comments and jokes of her own and eventually we got passed them and back
to the house.�

I didn�t have any knowledge of other white
pricks so I had no idea if Roger�s was considered small at home. All the other
pricks I�d seen were Tumalian and they were indeed larger but I thought that
was just a racial thing. �I�ll have to let him fuck me soon,� I said to myself
just to boost his ego a little, �But not tonight. I�m too sore and his prick
looks exhausted.� Out loud I asked, �You had a good time with Sanle when you
got her to bed � or she got you?�

�Yes, I suppose so. We did it for a long
while and I came more than I�d ever done before and it remained hard for hours
until it was almost too sore to use and I had to put some lotion stuff she had
on it to soothe it a bit.�

�She didn�t complain it was too small?�

�No. She seemed to like it but I don�t
know if it was just because I might give her a white baby.�

�Roger,� I spoke very quietly, �You know
that I don�t have any experience with white men but one thing I have noticed
since being here is that while the Tumalian pricks hang down and look very big,
when they�re hard, they don�t get all that much bigger. You, on the other hand,
grow considerably in length and girth. Even though the black pricks that I�ve
experienced were larger when hard, they aren�t that much bigger than yours.
Don�t put yourself down over its size.� What I�d said was perhaps an
exaggeration but I hoped it would quell some of his fears and doubts about his
performance. Sanle had undoubtedly been enjoying herself when I�d seen him
fucking her on the first evening and again last night when she tried to extract
the last of his sperm before he had to come back. For a while I lay alongside
him and cradled his head to my breasts.

&nbsp;

Despite being extremely tired I couldn�t
get to sleep. It had been a bad day. Everyone seemed worn out and just a bit
edgy. I�d hardly entered the office when one of the lads came and said, �You
were really into it at the festival. I certainly enjoyed you. Maybe we can do
it again after work?� To my horror he was one of the marauders! I hadn�t
recognised him with his body paint or perhaps, by the time it was his turn, I
was past bothering with who was in me.

Riku emailed Ted our editor to ask him to
send me a couple of tubes of sunblock. &lt;You better send a pic of her tits so
I can see if she really needs it&gt; came the reply. That annoyed me as he�d already
seen plenty of photos of me naked and being whipped and I was convinced that he
was instrumental in my being there in the first place. Roger took a pic and
enhanced it to show the redness and the peeling skin. Finally Ted agreed to
send some.

I contacted Shelumba to see if the Major
would allow us to visit the French girl. He�d taken the day off supposedly to
visit one of the military outposts. For most of the day we rather lethargically
worked on our diary/reports of the festival. Several times I had to return to
the room to put more cream on my sore cunt. Roger of course had to be with me
and he showed his distain for my suffering; his prick, while rather pink, was
tender and sensitive rather than sore and it immediately became erect when I
put a little cream on it. Now he was the one to start crying! Eventually I
drifted off to sleep.

A week later the three of us were called
into the Major�s office. We�d spent the time visiting a leather worker�s shop
and a hydroplant, which were interesting but not so unusual. I did ask Roger to
fuck me two nights later and then on the following nights, I had him before
Sumala had his turn. By then I had almost forgotten about my request to visit
Allaice, the French girl.

�Sit down please,� the Major smiled as he
indicated the seats in front of his desk but I had an uneasy feeling there was
a smirk behind the smile. I wondered if there would be another ordeal to
undergo. �I have considered your request and am inclined to agree to it� but
with certain reservations and safeguards.� 

�Here it comes,� I thought and I wasn�t
wrong.

�How long would it take you to get there
Sumala?� he asked. 

�On my own and if I was fully fit, I
would get there in a day easily. With these two, we would only make it in one
day if we had transport to the Negretti Pass, quicker still if we get a lift on
the transport road but that is a lengthy tortuous journey which goes the long
way round.�

�So the three of you should make it there
in two days, seeing there is no transport available.� Sumala nodded. �And on
foot they should get a better idea of our countryside?�

�Yes Sir, that is true,� Sumala added.

�How far will we have to walk?� I
enquired as it began to dawn on me that this would be no picnic.

Sumala answered, �As a bird flies it is
only about fifteen miles but the actual path is probably double that� and it is
not flat either and in places the track is difficult to follow. But you�re
young and getting used to using your legs again�� he paused to give me a grin, �So
you should be able to do more than half the first day and complete the journey
on the second. The last ten miles or so are the worst. The scenery is
spectacular but the going is rough.�

�But of course, we cannot have them
thinking it is an opportunity to make an escape attempt especially when they
will be so near the border,� the Major had that smirk again, �They will have to
be linked together at all times.�

�Sir, with all due respect, there are
many places on the trail where it would be dangerous, even life threatening if
they had to walk with their wrists linked.� Sumala shook his head at the
thought.

�I said they would have to be linked
Sumala. Yes for much of the way they can be chained by the wrists but on narrow
paths, link them by a rope or some such around their waists, like mountain
climbers.�

Although I am a townie whilst at college
I did go out a few times with a rambling group but I�d never done twenty miles
in one day. Twelve was my limit and I�d blisters at the end of it. I asked if
it was within the rules of his game to tie a queen to a pawn and then put my
reservations to Major Entembe. Again that smile.

�The rules are changed to suit the
circumstances Ellie and your position on the board.� I guessed he made the
rules up as he went along just to torment us. �From what I�ve heard, you are
getting to know our ways and the customs of Tumali women fairly well, No
Tumalian woman would balk at travelling that short distance but it is up to you
of course Miss Bluestone Elaine Eves. Do you wish to remain in the office or do
you wish to see more of our country? It is your decision. Roger of course will
have to abide by whatever you decide.�

During the whole interview, Roger had not
spoken and the major had not addressed him directly. No wonder he felt
downtrodden but I couldn�t alter that without lowering my leadership and I no
longer wished to be led by dithering Roger. Could I answer without belittling
my companion?

�Suma, you are going to be our guide and
I gather you know the way and what the conditions will be like. Knowing what
you do of our fitness and the fact that I, like you, frequently still feel the
pain from the whippings we had and later events, do you think I would be able
to make it without undue suffering? I guess we�ll also have to carry supplies
on our backs which won�t help our welts.�

�Yes. There would no doubt be some muscle
and foot soreness but nothing you couldn�t cope with and I�m sure you would
find the journey worthwhile. We�ll take the minimum of stuff with us.�

�Would you say the same thing for Roger?�

Sumala thought about his answer for
almost a minute. �He should find the journey worthwhile but he will complain a
good deal more on the way.� 

I had to smile at that. �Are you prepared
to put up with that Suma?� I asked.

�There�s always a gag to keep him quiet!�
We all laughed, except Roger of course. �But the real answer is yes. It will be
my pleasure to take you along and show you a little of life outside of our
town. And where you go Roger has to follow. You�re the boss.� 

Roger looked downcast. I wondered how
much it was because of the journey and how much because he would miss his
visits with Riku. He didn�t tell me even in bed that night.

Abruptly the Major changed the subject.
�I understand that you�re likely to be pregnant with my child.�

�I missed my period about ten days ago
and of course the child is likely to be yours sir, but of that we can�t be
certain.�

�Go to Muniba when you leave here and
have her test you properly. Will you keep the baby if and when you go back to
England?�

I immediately wondered if our return
might depend on my answer. �Yes, I�m not a great believer in abortion Sir and I
just can�t comprehend putting any of my babies up for adoption or sale like you
do here. Even if we�re allowed home by that time, I shall keep it and raise it
with all the care, love and attention of a good mother. Is there any news of
our being returned to England yet Sir?�

�You will care for and educate my child
in England?�

�Of course.� Again I wondered how much
that would influence our being sent home.

He nodded, �There has been nothing
officially yet but I hear that your Foreign Office has contacted the Korean
embassy on your behalf but diplomatic wheels turn slowly. In any case you will
have to await a pardon from General Cumu before you will get your passports
returned.� We left the office with much to think about.

Muniba confirmed what we already knew. I
was pregnant; I was going to have a black or at least a mixed race baby.
Fortunately in England I knew that would not be too uncommon.

The next day we spent in a flurry of
activity. Even Roger was caught up in it. We visited various places to get
supplies and Wyche to get ointment for our feet. Fortunately the sunblock had
arrived and I hoped that would help prevent further sunburn problems. The large
hat helped too, as did wearing a light, long-sleeved blouse but I had to be
ever mindful of keeping my tits on show like a true Tumalian woman. At least
the blouse protected my back and arms.

The night before we left, Sumala took
another woman to his room, which made me a little jealous, but it gave me the
opportunity to talk quietly to Roger. I cuddled him and when I felt his
erection against my stomach, I rolled him on top and asked him to fuck me. He�d
done it several times by then, usually before Sumala had me, so he was more
confident now and I used this as part of my argument. �Roger,� I started trying
to find the right words, �I know you are a bit worried about this trip but you
don�t need to be. Treat it as another new adventure. I�m sure there will be
some hardship involved but nothing like the whipping post. That changed my
life. It was hell but I got through it and came out stronger; not that I would
want to go through it again. It gave me the self-assurance to try other things,
like sex. I know you think I�ve become a whore, but it really has shown me
another side of my life and has taken away so much of my shyness. When we came,
neither of us would have dreamed of doing some of the things we already have.
How many girls have you fucked now? Three? Four? Maybe more in the community
house that you haven�t mentioned. Before we came you never had the confidence
to even put your arm around me, someone you had known for years, now you
willingly go to bed with a girl and enjoy fucking them. They enjoy it too, like
I just did. Without being forced into the situation you would never had got
that far, so look on our trip as an adventure where you can learn new things
and increase your own assurance. You can do a lot more than you give yourself
credit for and in any case Suma and I will be there to keep an eye on you.
Please, instead of looking at this trip as another trial, look at it as adding
to the richness of your life experience.� I paused wondering it I would get a
response but he said nothing but I did feel him hold me tighter. �End of
sermon,� I added. 

Sumala woke us early. I agreed that he
could just walk in my room and waken us without knocking and waking others. He
shook me by my breasts and whispered, �Five o�clock. Have a quick wash and piss
and be ready to go to breakfast at five-thirty. I want to be on the road by six
while it is still cool. Don�t bother showering, you�ll be sweaty in no time
anyway.�

He collected us soon after and we went to
the cafeteria which was closed at that time but he took us round the back and I
noticed the girl there was the same one he taken to bed that night. �I had to
work and earn our early breakfast,� he grinned.

�Oh the hardships you have to go through
on our behalf,� I responded.

�I don�t think I over worked him,� the
girl called out, �He should be fit enough to walk a mile or two without you
carrying him.�

�

Chapter fifteen. The journey to Neambu

We headed westwards at, for us, quite a
brisk pace and soon left the paved roads of Chapoti behind us. Sumala led the
way along a good, wide dirt road through an agricultural area with wide
irrigation ditches and small areas of woodland. Frequently we had to move to
one side as a horse or oxen drawn cart carrying fruit or vegetables for the
market, took most of the road width. Always we were greeted with friendly
smiles and a greeting. With the rising sun now dispersing the chill and mist of
the morning, I felt happy and free as we ambled through the undulating
landscape. Ahead of us I could see mountain peaks rising up and from what
Sumala had said, I knew we�d have to cross them before we reached Neambu, where
Allaice lived.

Sumala was in his element, striding along
bare-footed with the graceful ease of a young panther and carrying his bulky
framed rucksack like it weighed nothing. We, on the other hand, only had small
cotton rucksacks we�d bought in the market and, at Sumala�s insistence, only
brought a single change of clothing, a sweater and a few essential toiletries.
I tried to imitate his long strides and found they caused my buttock muscles to
complain but I quickly adjusted to a stride length and pace that suited me and
was soon lost in thought and admiring the scenery. It was pleasant and homely;
different to England but not a scene of forceful grandeur. Occasionally Sumala
would stop and point out things of interest but generally we walked in silence.
For a while I forgot about Roger holding my hand but gradually I noticed him
give a bit of a sigh and have to make a few hurried steps to keep up. I knew it
wouldn�t be long before he interrupted my reverie. We�d been on the move for
only an hour and a half when he gave a little moan. �Here it comes,� I thought,
�Trust him to spoil things with his whining.� 

A few minutes later he asked, �Can we
have a rest? I�m sure this pack has rubbed my welts and chafed them raw.�

�No!� I told him more forcefully than I
intended, �We need to get as far as we can while it is still relatively cool.
We�ll have a break in another hour or so.� Sumala turned and gave me a grin.

�I don�t think I can go that long without
a rest.� 

I just tugged on Roger�s hand and said,
�You can and you will. Now shut up. We�re all in the same boat. I can feel the
pack on my back too and I don�t know how Suma can take all that weight on his
whipped shoulders without complaining.�

�We could go back.�

�Don�t even think about it.�

Ten minutes later, �Ellie, we�ve got to
stop now, my feet are sore.�

�And your arse will be sore also if you
don�t shut up.� He kept dragging his feet and slowing me down and constantly I
had to pull on his hand. I was fed up. �Stop for a moment Suma please.� Roger
thought he was getting his way. �Can I have the rope please?� Out of his pack,
Sumala produced the twenty feet of so of rope that we�d intended to use when
crossing the mountains. Roger was about to slip the pack from his back when I
removed the cuff from my wrist and fastened it to his. Both his hands were then
linked in front of him by a length of chain. I tied one end of he rope to the
centre of the chain and the other around my waist. �You will keep the rope
slack at all times,� I instructed, �Otherwise I will get Suma use his big knife
to cut a switch and he can gee you up from behind like a donkey.� He called me
a cruel bitch but the threat must have had some effect because it was twenty
minutes before he started to complain again.

Rather than having the rope pull directly
on my waist, I held a bight of it in my hand. Twice it became tight enough to
pull it from my fingers but I didn�t remark on it. What annoyed me more was the
constant pathetic whimpering.

By now the agricultural landscape was
giving way to scrub and the grass road had deteriorated into a track that
climbed steadily upwards. Although we could still have walked side by side it
was preferable to me to keep my partner at a distance. Three-quarters of an
hour later we came to a small clear stream and Sumala suggested we had a
five-minute break. We dropped our packs but Roger of course, couldn�t get his
right off because of the cuffs but he could rest it when sitting on the ground.
I took the opportunity to check his back but there was only minor chafing but
to shut him up I put some cream on it. The heat of the day caused us to sweat
and the back of his shirt and my blouse was soaked.

��Don�t drink too much of the cold water,�
Sumala warned. We did have a drink and I rinsed my face and legs and then sat
in the shade of a small tree. �We�re doing quite well,� our guide informed me,
�But we�re not a far along as I planned. See that line of trees that are the
start of the mountains? A forester, Gordmu, and his family have a hut there. We
will be obliged to visit them and they will feel obliged to offer us food and
drink. You Miss Bluestone, must act as though you are in full charge of Roger
and me. Out here they are more traditional than in the town and they are old
and set in traditional ways. When they offer food accept but remember they will
not have much in stock and there is no town nearby to get more. If they offer
to refill your plate, respectfully decline. The other thing is, they will only
speak a few words of english although they will understand much of what you say
if you speak slowly. I have some difficulty with their dialect but I would
guess that I will have to interpret for them. At our pace it will take another
hour to get there and then we can have a proper rest. I think we should push on
straight away. What do you think Boss Lady?� He gave me a teasing smile.

�Fine Mr. Guide. Let�s go. On your feet
Roger.�

Ten minutes later and again in full sun I
was soaked with sweat and getting more and more irritable from the chafing of
my pack and almost having to tug Roger every step of the way. Worse was his
continual griping about the conditions. We stopped again. �Why did you have to
agree to this? If you�d agreed to fuck the Major a few times he�d have provided
transport. You�ve fucked nearly every one else and yet you drag me along and
torture me in this hell on earth.� While he was ranting I whispered to Sumala
what I wanted him to do.� From the grin
he gave I knew he agreed with what I was about to do and chuckling left the
track, cut a short stick and then ferreted in his rucksack for some string.

�You�ve turned into a mean bitch Ellie. I
just hope that I don�t get on the wrong side of you!� With Sumala�s help I
forced the stick crossways in Roger�s mouth and tied it in place with string
around his head. The ends of the stick stuck out several inches either side of
his head like a grotesque horse bit.

�Stand him up Suma please.� With Sumala
holding him upright I undid his shorts and let them fall to the ground. Neither
of them anticipated my next more. Undoing the rope from his chain, I formed the
end into a small noose, slipped it around the base of his prick and behind his balls
and lightly tightened it. Tears flowed from his eyes when he realised the
implications. It would be really painful if he didn�t keep up. My stuffing his
shorts into his backpack only added to his humiliation but we didn�t meet any
others on our journey.

�I�m leaving you like this until we get
to the forester�s place so the sooner we get there the better. I will put it
back on for the next stage of the trip if you start griping and abusing me
again. Understood?� He nodded but his eyes glared their hatred. �You might have
a lower pain threshold to us but there�s no need to act like a spoilt five-year
old, nor is there any need for you to say the vilest things about us,
especially when you know they are not true. Now I suggest you grip the rope
with your hands so there is no pressure on your balls unless you get too far
behind me.� He was mumbling something but nothing intelligible came out before
I told Sumala to lead the way again.

Not wishing to be too unkind I did keep
the pace down but deliberately didn�t look behind. Twice when he stumbled, the
rope became taut but not enough to tighten the noose. Even so it was well over
an hour before we arrived at a group of three grass huts.

Gordmu closely followed by his wife Tuva
came out to greet us. Apparently the sons were away in the forest working. He
immediately went towards Sumala who stepped aside and indicated that I should
go first. The old man hesitated for only a second and then noting my bluestone
badge came and hugged me and jabbered in his dialect. I caught the word Gordmu
and gathered it was a ritual greeting. Stepping back slightly I answered in my
best London accent, �I�m Ellie and I�m pleased to meet you Sir.� He nodded and
smiled and greeted Sumala before his wife came and greeted me. She indicated
for us to sit in the shade outside their hut. I introduced Roger and ordered
him to sit and then asked Sumala to remove the gag. �Don�t you dare say a word,
Roger, or it goes straight back in,� I warned when his gag came out.
Fortunately he only worked his jaws but kept quiet. Sumala then removed the
noose and, on my instructions, tied the rope around Roger�s waist.

Tuva through Sumala suggested that we
might like to rinse ourselves and wash the sweat out of our clothing in the
stream and then sit with them while we had some food and drink. I readily
agreed and she took us a short distance behind the hut to where a cold, fast
flowing stream from the mountains gurgled past. Without hesitation I shed my
clothes and stepped into the chilly water. Sumala did the same and when he was
close enough to me, whispered, �Order the boy to wash our clothes.� Releasing
one of his cuffs and handing the rope that was still around his waist to Tuva
to hold, gave the order in a loud voice. Tuva seemed to approve and was amused
by his efforts at washing but she didn�t intercede to help him.

Roger managed to get himself clean at the
same time although he did squeal a bit at the coldness of the water, but a look
from me and he shut up. It gave me a little pleasure to take photos of him
doing this chore without a washing machine. Tuva touched the welts on my back a
few times and asked about them and when we�d returned to Gordmu, she mentioned
it to him. Both seemed surprised at the extent of my punishment and the
whipping Sumala had. They�d heard about it of course because the boys had been
to the market since then.

While our clothes dried, we sat naked
outside the hut and talked in a stilted language with our hosts. Sumala soon
had a full erection and I wondered if I would be expected to allow him to use
it but fortunately Tuva brought out the food; flat bread with a huge pitcher of
honey. Gordmu explained that his sons had found a wild bees nest earlier in the
week. It was delicious and so different from the refined supermarket stuff that
I usually bought. This had everything in it; bits of honeycomb and even bits of
bees. I could have eaten it until I was sick but remembered to decline more
when I was offered.

Wyche�s ointment for my feet came in
useful. I didn�t have any blisters at the time but there were places between my
toes that were red. Sumala put in on for me and whispered that I was being
impolite by not asking to service his erection so after he�d treated Roger�s
feet I did so and noticed the look of satisfaction on our host�s faces when
Sumala entered and pounded me until he loosed his load. Whatever Roger thought
of it, he kept to himself. I wondered if Gordmu would fuck me as well but I
guess he was too old to get it hard enough. I almost offered Roger to Tuva but
I had already alienated him enough for one day.

All too soon Sumala suggested we ought to
move on. �The way for the next ten miles or so is a steep zig-zag uphill path
and the first part is through the forest. It will be darker and cooler under
the trees and much more humid so expect to sweat at least as much as you did
earlier. Once we get above the tree line, it will be bare rock and earth
landscape but we�ll be in the sun again. I am hoping that we can get over the
pass and down to a tiny village before nightfall so that we can have a roof
over our heads. Unfortunately Gordmu said he smelled rain in the air and at
this time of year it means a storm probably like the one we had in Chapoti some
days ago now. Storms in this area are pretty fickle so we could easily miss any
rain even though places nearby get a downpour. If it catches us in the open, it
won�t be pleasant. We need to make as much progress as we can now so we don�t
have to spend a night without shelter.�

�Okay Mr. Guide, let�s get going.� As
Sumala predicted, we were soon soaked in sweat and I wondered why we bothered
with washing our clothing. It was also dark and gloomy. Eerie. Mostly quiet,
but every so often we would be startled by a group of monkeys hurling
themselves through the trees making a loud clattering noise. We only caught
glimpses of them though.

Despite our best efforts, progress was
slow. Roger lapsed into a sullen silence but managed to keep up, no doubt
fearing further punishments from me if he didn�t. I took the cuffs off him
completely and fastened the rope around our waists so we had both hands free to
clamber over rocks and fallen trees that lay in our path. I tried to give him
words of encouragement but he more or less ignored them, preferring, I suspect,
to treat me as a wicked sadistic bitch. In several places Sumala had to hack a
path through the undergrowth and I could only admire his sense of direction. I
would have been completely lost. Each time the path seemed to disappear, after
a hundred yards or so of clearing, it reappeared again. His clearing the
pathway lost us time but eased the pressure on us. It was well into the
afternoon before the trees thinned and eventually we emerged into bright
sunshine.

�Fill your water bottles here,� Sumala
ordered, �This is the last little stream before we get well down on the other
side of the col there.� He pointed to a low place between two mountain peaks.
It looked a long way off and was at a much higher elevation than we were. I
heard Roger give a little cry of fear and I too knew the feeling. It would be a
long hard slog to get to the col and with sore feet, it would be a painful
descent. I gave him a hug and whispered, �We�ll make it. No problem.� 

The ground quickly became rough with
small boulders everywhere making walking difficult. In places we had to go
between or around large outcrops of rock. It was more like a landscape from a
science fiction film. At times, where the land fell away sharply and we were
close to cliffs several hundreds of feet high, we had superb views over the
surrounding land. I took a few photos but spectacular wide vistas like that
never seem impressive in a picture.

At four o�clock we noticed a dark cloud
coming over the peaks, heading in our direction. I looked at the col again but
it seemed almost as far away from us as it did when we came above the tree
line. The route wasn�t as tortuous or as steep as the way through the forest
but it would take a long while to reach to top of the pass. Sumala led us from
the track, if ever there was an actual path, to a huge, slightly overhanging
rock formation. �Take all your clothes off and put them inside plastic bags
inside your packs and then we�ll huddle down in what little shelter there is
here. That way at least you will have dry clothes to put on after the rain
stops. It will get pretty chilly so we�ll need to keep each other warm. Roger
had pooh-poohed the idea of using plastic bags inside our packs yesterday. �It
won�t rain now for months,� he�d declared. Only on his camera did he lavishly
encase in plastic and that was more to keep grit out. I took pity on him and
put the clothes he took off in with mine.

Hardly had we completed the task and we
heard the loud hissing which became a roar as the rain reached us.� Sumala managed to fish out a small tarpaulin
he intended to use as a ground sheet from his pack and we wrapped that around
us. The inside rapidly became wet from our moisture but it did protect our
bodies a little from the stinging bite of the raindrops. It was a frightening
sensation. There we were crouched down and sitting on our packs in the dubious
shelter of a large rock on an exposed mountainside with the rain beating on our
bodies so hard that it was almost like being stoned with fine pebbles. I must
say that Sumala took the brunt of it. Roger and I were pressed back against the
rock and he was on the outside but nevertheless we still felt a lot of its
force. Soon the chill air caused us to shiver and we hugged each other tighter
but no one spoke, not even Roger. A bright flash of lightening crept through
the cracks under the edges of the tarpaulin, immediately a tremendously loud
crack of thunder pierced our eardrums. It was a scenario that repeated itself
time and time again over the next hour. 

Several times Roger screamed in terror
but all I could do was hug him. I too was frightened but with him I knew that
his shaking was more from fear than cold. I rethought my decision to take him
on this adventure, an adventure that had turned out to be another ordeal but in
my heart I knew I would have made the same decision again. It was sheer chance
that this storm had come at this time. What if we had made better time earlier
in the day? What if we hadn�t stayed so long with the forester? Would we have
missed it then or caught it when we were in shelter? Questions without answers.


For a short while the rain eased slightly
and Sumala peered out. �Shit!� he swore. We soon found out why. The storm
rebounded from the peaks on the eastern boundary and headed back towards us.
We�d no time to change our position so we caught the full force. Fortunately it
had lost a little of its power but was still worse than any storm I�d been in
at home. For a further half an hour it battered us until we thought we couldn�t
stand it any more. The top of my head felt bruised and sore and the thunder
reverberated around inside my skull until I thought I would pass out from the
noise alone. I didn�t and surprisingly, Roger didn�t either.

Almost as though the tap had been turned
off, the rain suddenly ceased, the black clouds disappeared and the sun shone
brightly. Steam rose from the ground, the rocks and us. The noises in our heads
didn�t disappear as quickly though and it was several hours before we began to
hear properly.

The landscape took on a surreal look when
we finally started out again. Steam rose in dense clouds as the warm evening
sun dried up the surface water making it seem that we were walking through a
sauna. It didn�t matter that we�d put on dry clothing because only minutes
after leaving, we were soaked with sweat. By now I was footsore too so progress
was slow but we put in a few more miles and then called a halt to have
something to eat. �Where will we spend the night?� I asked our guide.

�Good question. To be honest with you, I
don�t know. I expected to be over the col before now and into the forest area
but we won�t do that before dark. We�ll be stuck in this rocky stuff until dawn
without wood for a fire. That storm cost us dearly in time.� I noticed that he
didn�t blame our snail�s pace walk. After we�ve had a bit of a rest we�ll go on
and keep our eyes open for a smoother patch of ground��

�Or a cave?�

He grinned, �If there is a cave it will
almost certainly be inhabited by something you won�t like Ellie. One good thing
about the storm is that there are now pools of water although I expect they
will be gone by morning.�

Actually we did have a little luck later.
A half hour after walking again, we came to a rock formation that almost formed
a little bay and in here the prevailing wind blew much of the debris from the
surrounding hills. The ground would be hard but at least we could have a fire
and rest even if we didn�t sleep too much. 

It turned cold and I put on the sweater
that I�d brought, Roger�s was still wet as was most things in his pack so we
had to erect a little rack near the fire to dry his stuff out. As the night
wore on, so the cold increased and we doubled up on our clothing and lay
huddled together on the tarpaulin, our only protection from the hard ground. 

The whining started almost as soon as we
settled down, this time though I didn�t turn on him. �Roger, just remember
we�re all in the same situation. We�re no better off than you and no worse off
either. We�ll get through it together. He groaned and started weeping but he
turned away from me and his comments stopped.

None of us slept much during what seemed
an endless night. At intervals Sumala got up and added fuel to the fire and
usually for a while after I sat on my rucksack with his arms around me watching
the flames consume the twigs. We didn�t speak but each was lost in our
thoughts.

At first light, we boiled some water and
made tea and had a couple of the thick biscuits we�d brought. I treated our
feet with the ointment and was pleasantly surprised that I hadn�t any blisters
and neither had Roger although both of us had redness between several of our
toes and on the balls of our feet.�
Shortly after we packed and set off again while the air was still cold.
The walking helped to restore our circulation and before long we made good
progress.

Two hours later and still not nine
o�clock, we crested the col and began the long and winding descent into a
valley, only to climb out of it again on to another high plateau.� At times we walked along the very edge of the
border with Malawi but the high sheer cliffs made it impossible to cross over.
I wondered if I would have done so had I been given the chance. Twice we
stopped at tiny villages and were given refreshment and at one I was given a
good fucking by two lads and both Roger and Sumala serviced a girl each. It
provided a pleasant interlude but before long, Suma indicated that we should
continue but it was nearly dark again before we reached Neambu. The day�s
journey had been a much pleasanter experience and even Roger seemed more
cheerful. Both of us though were very tired but Sumala still walked with an
easy stride.

On the outskirts of the village, a young,
light skinned girl ran up, grabbed my hand and almost dragged me through the
streets to a small wooden house. Other villagers seemed to know what was
happening as they waved and greeted me by name as I was led passed them. �News
certainly seems to travel quickly even in these remote areas,� I thought but my
guide didn�t allow me to stop.

�Welcome,� Allaice greeted our arrival in
her slightly accented english, �I expected you earlier.�

�You expected us?�

�Of course, the transport driver told us
you were coming when he brought the supplies yesterday. Why you not get a lift
with him?�

�The Major, the bloody Major! He deliberately
put us through hell again,� I fumed.

�But you did see more of our
countryside.� Sumala laughed. Roger looked angry too. He probably still thought
that I could have fucked some proper transport out of the major.

&nbsp;

Chapter sixteen. I punish Roger

�You�ve met Alicia my fifth daughter and
this giant teddy bear is JeanPaul.� The biggest man I�d seen so far in Tumali
came laughing from behind her, threw his arms around me and lifted my feet well
off the ground. �That�s a real bear hug,� Allaice grinned but I cried out from
the pain and then grinned when he set me down.

�JeanPaul is not my real name but this
Frenchie woman couldn�t say it and renamed me. Now everyone calls me JeanPaul.
I don�t mind though.� A huge grin lit up his face and as soon as my feet were
back on the floor he gave his partner a similar hug and playfully tossed his
daughter squealing in the air a couple of times. I introduced Roger and Sumala
although I guessed they already knew their names.

�Why is he tied to her mummy?� Alicia
asked.

�So he does not run away and get into
trouble,� I answered which caused more laughter from everyone except Roger.

�You would like shower I expect?� 

�We had a very good shower yesterday
afternoon,� Sumala commented, �But we�d better have another.�

�Something a little less powerful and
quieter would be nice,� I quipped and we had to explain about the storm.

�Leave us your clothes and I will wash
them so you have clean for morning. You will not need any tonight. It is warm
in house and we do not wear any in evening.�

Refreshed, we sat around the table and
ate our first proper meal in several days. The conversation was on us, and each
time I broached the subject of her being in Tumali, Allaice said we would talk
on her life tomorrow when we would be less tired.

That was true. By ten o�clock my eyes
were closing. JeanPaul had taken Alicia to the children�s house for the night
and Allaice showed us to their bedroom. It had two beds, one much bigger than
the other which I guessed was to hold the enormous bulk of JeanPaul. �You won�t
mind I think, if I take Suma to bed me tonight. The big bear will like to have
you. It is the custom in Tumali I think you know.� I smiled, more at her
phrasing than at what she said but she assumed I agreed. In fact, having seen that
his prick was in proportion to his frame, I was a little concerned that I might
not take it easily. She must have noticed my expression. �You not worry. He is
gentle. I know from first time he fuck me.�

Roger and Sumala were both sporting
erections and I didn�t want to alienate him further. �Would you like to take
Roger first?� I asked her praying that she would agree. A further slight would
flatten his self esteem even further. 

�Do I have to chain him to me too?� She
adopted the Tumalian habit of smiling widely.

�No, but I mustn�t unchain him without
fastening him to another.�

�You get to watch then.� Poor Roger�s
face went red. I don�t know why. I�d watched him before and he�d watched others
fuck me often enough. Maybe it was because JeanPaul had returned and sat with
his arms around me while we watched. Fortunately Roger�s erection kept standing
and, after some initial faltering, he gave Allaice a creditable fuck. Having
abstained for a couple of days, he wasn�t long in shooting his seed into her. From
what I could see of her belly, I guessed she was in the early stages of
pregnancy so he wouldn�t be fathering a baby with her.

I shooed him to the far side of the big
bed and readied myself for the Big Bear�s weapon. �I won�t hurt you,� he said,
�I�ve had many women now.� 

His entry did hurt a bit but it was
nothing I couldn�t withstand without crying out and soon I was thrusting back
to meet his loins. When I glanced at Roger he silently mouthed �whore� and I
felt like giving him a backhander but was too busy holding on to JeanPaul. I
almost couldn�t get his near hard prick in my mouth to clean it and had to lick
up and down the length of his shaft. My vagina once again felt tender but I
wasn�t about to mention it, nor get up for some lotion. I quickly fell asleep
snuggled in the big man�s arms.

I awoke when he moved his frame to go for
a piss. Roger was already awake and I noticed his usual morning hard-on. I
spoke, I thought, in a kindly way, �Okay Roger, come and relieve yourself.�

�Don�t patronise me bitch! You think I
wish to bring myself down to your level Miss Innocence now turned in to Miss
Bluestone Slut. No thank you!� He turned away. 

The hatred in his voice appalled me and I
almost started crying but when I moved my head I saw, all the others were
watching and they�d all heard the remark. I had to do something. I had to keep
my authority over him. �Suma, would you get the strap the Major presented to me
when he gave me the bluestone please. It�s in my backpack.� He seemed surprised
and Roger looked apprehensive but he had just a hint of a smile that in my mind
said, �She�ll only threaten me with it. She�ll never dare use it. She knows
what I�m like with pain.� �Thank you Suma. Now would you mind holding him over
the edge of the bed please?� 

Because of the chain, it took a few
minutes to get him into a suitable position and by then Roger began to realise
that he�d gone too far and that he was going to feel the strap. He started
pleading, then begging but I ignored him. �Allaice would you mind getting my
camera out and taking a few pictures of this so he can have a reminder of who
is in charge of who here?�

�JeanPaul�s better with camera than me.
He takes good pictures.� So it proved although at the time I wondered how his
huge hands would cope with the tiny controls.

�Ready?� Sumala and JeanPaul nodded,
Roger screamed �NO!� I knew I had to make my mark and do it quickly. �CRACK!
CRACK! CRACK! CRACK!� Without a pause I whipped the strap across his
backside with all the force that I could muster in the short space of time. He
gave an almighty cry and then went limp but soon came round. Despite the shame
I felt from having hurt him, there was also a sense of elation. I�d used my
power and he�d had to submit to it. Tears rolled down his face and he sobbed
and tried to rub his arse but with Sumala still pinning him he was unable to
move his arms sufficiently. Still feeling my power, I ordered, �Release him
Suma please.� Roger started to stand and massage the soreness. �Kneel!� I stood
with the strap still in my hand and indicated he should kneel at my feet. �Kiss
me.� With his face level with my pubic mound, there was no doubt as to where I
wanted to he kissed. I tried to keep a stern face but it was difficult with the
others trying to suppress their laughter. �Roger, if you ever talk to me like
that again, I�ll skin your backside even if it takes all day to do it.
Understand?� Slowly he looked up and nodded. �Now you can think up a suitable
apology, one that befits a journalist of your ability. I don�t wish to hear,
�I�m sorry Ellie�. You should be able to do better than that.� A few minutes
later he found a form of words and stuttered a suitable apology. At least the
apology seemed genuine and his voice more respectful, but I guessed he was
seething inside.

Sumala and JeanPaul both had erections by
this time and serviced us again before we showered. Allaice made a hearty
breakfast and Alicia came and picked her stuff up ready for school. The young
girl quickly spotted Roger�s striped arse and asked, �Did he try to run away?� 

�Not this time but he was very cheeky to
me.�

�And you�re a bluestone power girl! He
should know better.� We all had to laugh at that.

JeanPaul had to go to work at the timber
yard and I sent Sumala to get a few pictures of the village while I helped
Allaice clear the breakfast things and I could have a woman-to-woman chat with
her without the formality of an interview. Roger sullenly followed me around,
keeping as far away as the chain allowed. I found that she�d had seven children
but only kept the one. The first baby was sold because she couldn�t be sure
that JeanPaul or any other Tumalian man was the father. �It could be that it
was one of the pirates� baby,� she said, �I don�t think it was but there was a
remote possibility,� before turning to the topic food differences between
Tumali. England and France.

When Sumala returned and showed me the
pictures on the camera screen, I scrolled back to the ones of Roger�s strapping
and saw that JeanPaul had indeed taken some good ones. Probably his high
viewpoint helped. I didn�t show them to Roger; he was very quiet and subdued
and had hardly spoken a dozen words since I�d threatened him with the gag if he
started whining. He did, however, make a great show of walking stiffly and
sitting down with the utmost care and trying to elicit the maximum amount of
sympathy from Allaice. She just laughed and told him not to be a baby. Now the
four of us sat in easy chairs that actually matched, ready for Allaice to begin
her account. Fortunately I�d carried the little Sony recorder and it had
survived the deluge in the mountains so I didn�t really need to takes notes but
I did anyway. The speedwriting technique I learned in college, as usual, proved
a godsend. I still couldn�t trust machines to behave; like computers, they seem
to break down at the most inconvenient times.

On tape I introduced Allaice and told
Roger and Sumala that they would be free to comment and ask questions at any
time. Which they did and I was able to piece together a coherent report.

&nbsp;

Chapter seventeen. Allaice�s story

I translated her rather odd phrasing when
I typed this report.

�When I was young I was rich and
attractive enough to be part of the �in crowd�. I had a carefree life and went
to the best schools and in the winter holidays, enjoyed skiing at the best
resorts and in summer, sailing and partying at Cannes and other playgrounds of
the rich along the coast of southern France. By the time I was eighteen I�d had
many boyfriends and sex with one or more of them was no big deal. In many ways
I used my body to get what I wanted from them. They paid for me to stay with
them in the best hotels, went sailing on grandiose yachts and got invited to
private parties on a large motorboat in a secluded bay; parties that were
synonyms for an orgies. I enjoyed being fucked, whether it was a lad younger
than me, or someone old enough to be my grandfather. In a way I was a kind of
prostitute although I never actually accepted money for sex, I was given
presents and taken to places I would not otherwise had access to.�

�Would you like to come sailing with me
on Lake Nyasa?� Pierre asked. I won�t give their full names even though they
are dead now. The invitation was to Cherie and me while we were on a luxury
yacht and five other young men were taking turns to screw us. At that time I
had no idea where Lake Nyasa was and Pierre just said, �It�s in the middle of Africa.�

�Sounds like fun, I�ve never been to
Africa but I�ve had a few black men.� That shocked Cherie but she agreed to go
as well. Three weeks later four of us flew to Lilongwe and hired a car and
drove to Senga a small town on Lake Nyasa. Here we met Rikard and Marlen� who
owned the yacht. It wasn�t as big as some that I�ve sailed on but it was a
goodly size and plenty big enough for the six of us especially as we planned
sharing the sleeping berths. We partied that night and swapped partners a few
times so it was late the next morning when we hoisted the sails and headed
towards the northern end of the lake. There was a good breeze and we bowled
along at a good pace for several hours but in the late afternoon the wind died
and we crept along at a snails pace. It was all peaceful and I was laid out on
the cabin top catching the last rays of the sun, when we heard this motor boat
speeding towards us. Before we realised anything untoward was happening a burst
of automatic gunfire put a row of holes through the mainsail. The motorboat cut
its engine and two black men with guns stood up and pointed them at us. 

�Fucking Pirates!� Rikard swore. They
boarded our boat and herded us all into the bow where one kept a gun trained on
us while two more ransacked the cabin, a fourth stayed in their boat. Anything
they thought valuable or portable was put into sacks and tossed into the
motorboat. It didn�t seem to take them long and then the men were forced into
the cabin and locked down there. Rikard protested and was knocked to the deck
with a rifle butt before they almost threw him down into the cabin. The others
went quietly after one had pointed his gun at Cherie�s chest. It didn�t take a
Sherlock Holmes to deduce what they planned to do with three bikini clad ladies.
They made us take off what little we had on and throw them in the water. We�d
have given them what they wanted without too much of a problem except that we
were also afraid of contracting AIDS but no, they wanted it the rough way and
forcibly grabbed our tits and arses and bent us over the railing. I felt a cock
being pushed into my dry cunt and tried to accommodate him but to him it didn�t
matter. He just plunged on and raped me as hard as he could. 

When he pulled out, the one in the
motorboat called to them and I was thrown down to him. Without being told I
bent over the engine casing and readied myself. I hoped that would make him
hurt me less and the sperm inside me would act as a lubricant. He didn�t take
long and when he saw the men trying to break out of the cabin, he climbed on
the yacht. I took the opportunity to slip quietly into the water and dive as
deeply as I could. The boats glided on and it seemed a while before my absence
was noticed. By then it was virtually dark but I could see the lights of the
boats and I doubted if they would see me if I didn�t splash around. Slowly I
swam towards the Malawi shore. It all went very quiet and then there was some
shouts and screams before the motorboat�s engine roared into life and the craft
headed towards the Tanzanian coast. A few minutes later there was an almighty
explosion and the yacht became a ball of flame. I doubted if anyone could have
survived and by then I was a good quarter of a mile from it. Within a minute
the flames were gone and peace descended once more. I called and called but
there was no reply. I knew I was alone, tired, naked and still a long way from
the shore. 

�Just take it easy Allaice,� I said to
myself, �You�ll either make it or you won�t. Either way you are in God�s
hands.� 

�You obviously made it,� Roger commented.
We were all appalled and enthralled by her story.

�Yes but I was a long way from being
safe. It was a long tiring swim but eventually I crawled on to dry land and
just curled up in a tight ball on pebbly ground, shivering in the cold air
until the first glimmer of dawn allowed me to see what was around me. I had
indeed been fortunate in my unwitting choice of a landing place. It was a small
bay surrounded by forest and steep hillsides. A hundred yards either way and I
would not have found a place to climb ashore. Tired, sore and very depressed
over what happened and the probable death of my friends I stumbled to my feet
and tried to make my way along the shoreline. In bare feet it was a painful
process and I really had no idea which way would take me to the nearest
habitation. In the end I decided to head sort of northwest mainly because I
hadn�t seem more than a few huts as we sailed along in the afternoon. Mind you
I hadn�t been paying much attention to the landscape but I knew we were pretty
close to the northern end of the lake when the pirates came and thought there
might be a settlement near the entrance to the Songwe River. I had no idea how
far away that was.

At the end of the little bay I came to an
area of scrub, steep but walkable except that I got badly scratched from the
thorn bushes. In many places they were head high and my stumbling gait caused
me to brush against them. In only a few yards, I was covered with scratches
that dripped blood. The sun rose and it became hot and in an hour or so I was
terribly thirsty and hungry. In that time I doubted if I had walked a mile and
my feet were sore and bleeding and my body looked like I had been scourged with
a bramble twigs. Once more the animal track I was tentatively following led
back to the shore but from there I could see no way forward. Probably it was a
place where animals came to drink. I collapsed under a tree and cried at my
hopeless situation. I�d almost given up any hope of survival and wished that I had
died a quick death with my companions instead of a slow death by starvation.
There was plenty of water but I doubted that it would be clean although I�d
already swallowed a lot during my swim. I took a little in my mouth and spat it
out again. I didn�t have the energy to go on especially as it meant retracing
my steps through the thorny scrub. Tiredness and depression overcame me and I
closed my eyes and dozed for a while but was awoken by the �Putt-putt� of a
small motorboat engine. Standing up I waved and then wondered if I had done the
right thing. In the boat a huge black man stood up too and I had visions of
being raped again. For once I did the right thing. The man was JeanPaul or
J�npeloe to give him his real name although no one here uses it any more. I
must have passed out because I next remember being lifted carefully into the
boat and sipping some flavoured water. He held me in his lap until we arrived
at a landing place and I was taken in a cablecar. The next thing I remember was
being in hospital with JeanPaul alongside my bed. You should have seen his face
and how he looked blank when I spoke to him in French! He replied in English
but he spoke kindly and told me his name and when I couldn�t get my tongue
around it I gave him the French version. Gently he held my hand and I tried my
school english with a few words of my own language mixed in and found he could
understand it. When I asked he told me I was in Tumali. That was quite a shock.
I knew a bit about the ways of the people here from talking with Marlen� the
night before and Rikard had jokingly suggested that I might like to be one of
the women here and be fucked day and night by any man who could get an erection
and be permanently pregnant. Such was the misconception he had of the place. I
also knew that once in the country, it wasn�t easy to get out, as you have
found Ellie.�

I nodded and smiled as I still had no
idea if and when I would return to England.

�JeanPaul shocked me even more by saying
I was now his woman and he would look after me. I would be his mate.�

�That�s an old tradition from tribal
times,� Sumala interjected, �Young warriors would raid a neighbouring tribe and
abduct a girl to be their mate. It helped to stop inbreeding and usually after
a while the girls accepted their new home. It�s not really a law here but it is
something that is accepted. JeanPaul having captured, or rather rescued,
Allaice, had the right to her.�

�They kept me in the hospital for about a
week, even though I was fit enough to leave well before then but they waited
for the results of tests to see if I was clean especially after they knew I�d
been fucked by the Tanzanians. Fortunately I was. Officials came to see me and
there were many forms to fill but I wasn�t allowed to contact anyone and the
only embassy was the North Korean and they weren�t very concerned with my case.
It took months before I could arrange to have money sent to me from my bank in
France.

At the end of the week, JeanPaul took me
to his home, a one room shack not too far from the cablecar station. He was a
licenced fisherman then and a little up the social ladder from the poorest
workers and, unlike most of them, had his own home and didn�t live in a
community house. By then I�d witnessed and learned more of the habits of
Tumalian men and women. I�d seen women patients and nurses being fucked by male
staff and patients but I�d been given a large pair of knickers to wear to tell
everyone that I was off limits to them. That was the only clothing I had until
just before leaving JeanPaul brought me a blouse and a skirt and some soft
shoes. It seemed so strange to be visited by a doctor who had a visible
erection and as you�ve found out, they all seemed well endowed compared to
European men. JeanPaul�s is especially large and every day when I had recovered
a little, he�d sit by my bed and make me hold it for him. Several times he told
me he was hoping to give me a baby but I was a bit afraid then. I knew the
chances of being pregnant by the pirates was small because I was on the pill
and had recently had a period but there was still that possibility and the
hospital had made no attempt to clean me out.�

�Was any attempt made to catch the
pirates?� I asked.

�At the time nothing much happened. The
Malawian and French governments informed the Tanzanian but they didn�t get
anywhere. A year or more later, some of the stuff from the boat turned up and
was traced back to them and they were caught and later executed. Fortunately
the trial was in Tanzania and I wasn�t allowed to leave Tumali.�

�So you�ve been a �wife� to JeanPaul ever
since?�

�More or less Ellie, as you know, here
there is no such thing as a wife in our sense of the word but I�ve been his
main woman for eight or nine years now and having our own house keeps us
together too. Of course, he has other women and I have other men but I think
most of my babies have been his.�

�What did you think when you saw his
home? You said it was a shack and being rich, I guess you were used to having
splendid homes.� I could visualise her disgust.

�Yes, it really was a downturn in my
living arrangements but it was either that or prison accommodation. Like you, I
was detained in the country at General Cumu�s discretion but at that time it
was the present leader�s father in power. He was at least as strict. In prison
I would have been kept in a cell and fucked by off-duty guards and other
prisoners, with JeanPaul I was free to go anywhere in the country provided I
didn�t cross the border. That meant I couldn�t go fishing with him but
otherwise I was pretty much free. At first sight, the house looked almost ready
to fall down but in fact it withstood the storms of the rainy season without
many problems. The inside was cleaner than I expected and I gather the Bear had
roped in a couple of women to do some cleaning before I arrived. It wasn�t
really necessary to give me a tour of the house; I could take it in at a
glance. Only one room, with a large bed at one end, stove at the other, tables
and chairs between.�

�Better than a prison cell though. We
know what they are like,� I grimaced at the thought of spending months in one.

�And you only saw the cells of the
holding prison, not the main prison itself,� Sumala remarked, �That was a
palace compared to the crowded, several to a room main prison.�

�That�s right and I found out afterwards,
there are many more male prisoners than women so they try and put one woman in
a cell with several men who have nothing better to do than fuck her all day.
Worse still is the fact that prison is more for repeated violent offenders who�ve
probably been to the whipping post a number of times so they have little mercy
of sympathy for the woman. But to get back to my story. I was amazed when
JeanPaul picked me up outside the door and carried me in. �I saw this on a film
once,� he said and barely paused on his way to dump me on the bed and undress
me. For his size he�s very gentle and soon I was naked and very nervous
especially when he�d undressed too and I saw clearly and up close, the size of
his erect prick. I needn�t have worried. Carefully he rubbed my cunt until I
was wet and then slowly inserted his penis in me. It was big and stretched my
cunt but it felt nice and soon we fucked properly. He was the only one to have
me for the first two weeks but then we started visiting others and they visited
us and I had to service the men while he did the girls.�

�So when did you move here?� Roger asked.

�After about a year, when I finally got a
bank account in Chapoti and could access my money in France. By then I�d had
and sold my first child. The money helped to keep us and soon after I was
granted leave to return to France but I�d come to love the country, and
especially my Bear man, in a way that I hadn�t with any of my other so called
lovers. We�re as near to being man and wife as you can be here.�

�Have you been home to France? I expect
there are things you miss?� I asked.

�No. I could have but my parents
disapprove of my being a �commercial baby producer� and they disagreed strongly
with my selling of the first baby. They�re staunch Catholics and they think I
should be properly married and care for each of my babies. They tried to come
here but couldn�t get a visa but we met up in Lilongwe and it ended up with a
big argument when I wouldn�t return to France with them. Mother still keeps in
touch by letter but daddy has almost disowned me.� A tear trickled down
Allaice�s cheek as she said that.

�What about the food here?�

�I�ve got used to it and still tend to
cook in the French way apart from the fact I need to make more to feed the
Bear. Talking of food, I guess it is about time for lunch.� 

I shackled Roger to Sumala and sent them
off to look around the village while I helped Allaice prepare lunch. This gave
me the opportunity to ask, �Don�t you find it really traumatic to give up a
baby as soon as it is born? After you�ve carried it for nine months?� 

�The first one was the worst because I
actually saw it and I could have kept him but once I had agreed to sell the
child there was no going back. It still took a long while to come to terms with
my loss. Being paid for it I suppose helped in some ways in that we would have
been very poor if we only had JeanPaul�s irregular income. The others, well I
knew I couldn�t keep them so I set my mind to that before they were born but I
was determined to keep my fifth, whether it was a boy or a girl. Even knowing
you�re going to give up the child doesn�t entirely lose the sense of loss
especially when you�re in milk and have to feed the babies of others. I think
the Tumalian women are less traumatised than I am.�

We stayed two days with them and had an
enjoyable time. I slept with the Bear one night and Sumala the other. Roger
even seemed more agreeable and at least he now accepted my authority. I allowed
him to fuck me and so did Allaice. I know that he wasn�t looking forward to the
long trip back and was delighted when, on our last evening and we�d packed
everything ready for an early start, a messenger came with a note from the
Major. �A man from your Foreign Office has arrived, report back ASAP. One of
the truck drivers will bring you.�

&nbsp;

Chapter eighteen. Set up for another
ordeal

�I�ll wring the bastard�s neck. I�ll
squeeze his balls until he squeals,� I fumed as I dragged Roger up the stairs
into Government House. Sumala followed at a discrete distance. Ignoring
Shelumba I barged straight into Major Entembe�s office. He looked up in
surprise but before he could open his mouth, I started, �I didn�t think that
even you could be such a cruel bastard. Treating us like animals! Why? Haven�t
you made us suffer enough? First you make us walk all the way there and no
doubt you knew storms were forecast and we�d get battered and soaked, then you
kindly offer us transport on the way back for which I have to pay in advance by
getting fucked by the old man who is drive us and then we find our transport,
the transport that you with all your authority arranged, was a cattle truck,
with nothing to sit on except the bare shit covered boards! I hope the smell we
picked up stinks your office out and it cannot have done the baby inside me any
good. Your baby Major,� The Major opened his mouth to say something but I flew
on running sentences together and barely pausing to breathe. �And don�t say nothing
else was available. Not an hour after we�d been bumped and bruised on the road
a half empty bus passed us. You just wanted to inflict more pain and suffering
on us. Why? When you know full well we still haven�t fully recovered from the
thrashing we had at the whipping post; a whipping you could no doubt have saved
us from if you had really used your powers. Does it give you pleasure to see us
hurt and suffer? Are you just getting back at us because we�re British? For
some long forgotten reason? Or is this all part of the game we are in? The
suffering game? Does it please you to�� Roger jerked the chain linking us.

�I wouldn�t wish to be in Ted�s shoes
when she gets back.� A cultured British voice startled me. �I heard she was a
shy little thing.�

�If she gets back and doesn�t end up in
the market square again.� I turned to see Colonel Nubaro and a distinguished
looking gentleman in a suit and, incongruously for this country, wearing an
expensive tie. �May I introduce Peter Spencer from your Foreign Office.�

�Sorry Sir, I didn�t know you were there��

�Good afternoon Miss Eves and Mr. Hart. I
hope we can talk about your problems a little more calmly when you�ve cleaned
up.�

�Yes, I think that would be best,�
Colonel Nubaro smiled, �And yes, it is a bit of a game to us. I heard of your
analogy when you first came but now it is being played on two levels and you
are once again a pawn. Please do go and get cleaned up and then perhaps we can
discus this in a more civilised manner. Shelumba, please escort them out and
bring them back in thirty minutes.� 

My fury had only abated slightly. �Is he
acting on your orders?� I nodded in the direction of the Major. He didn�t
answer. �Well I hope your sadistic talents have had some satisfaction!�

�Maybe another visit to the whipping post
might do some good after all,� the Colonel muttered calmly. Roger fainted to
the floor. I glared hatred at the Colonel who only smiled. He knew he had the
whip hand in both senses of the term. I held Roger for a few moments until he
recovered and then before I could say any more and make the situation worse,
Sumala picked me up and carried me from the room.

In the shower my anger dissipated and my
fear returned. �What if the Foreign Office gent hadn�t come to take us home?
Would we be tortured again for my outburst? What did they really want with us?�
My tears were washed away by the flow of water. Shelumba came and told us to
hurry and then led us back to the Major�s office.

�Please sit down Miss Eves,� The Major
requested. There was only one hard chair in front of his desk and I knew he was
deliberately goading me. �Sumala please wait outside the door in case we need
you to take the fireball away again.� I sat and, without being told, Roger
knelt on the floor beside me. Colonel Nubaro stood to the right of the Major
and Peter Spencer sat on his left. It was Peter that opened the conversation.

�Miss Eves, Elaine, I came here hoping to
secure your release but as you guessed you are a pawn in a game, except that it
isn�t a game. It is a matter of hard negotiation between the Tumalian head of
state and the British Government. Colonel Nubaro is representing Tumali
interests and I am here of behalf of Britain. To secure your immediate release,
we would have to agree to give Tumali several million pounds in aid. So you are
a valuable commodity��

�But one that is expendable and can be
made to suffer almost unbearable punishments!�

�But, Elaine, that only makes you more
valuable. The articles in Today�s World, the underground version on DVD and
especially those on the Tumali web site showing explicit and graphic pictures
of what is being done to you is putting a great deal of public pressure on the
Prime Minister to secure your release. In a way, the more you suffer the higher
the amount they ask for in aid. However the PM is adamant about not giving in
to blackmail and I think the people here are beginning to realise that further
punishments might be counter productive. There is a growing amount of opinion
that the government should not give in to a regime that uses what they see as
inhuman methods to control its people. At the moment our negotiations have
stalled but I�m authorised to stay here a few days more to try and secure a
settlement. However, if I am honest with you, I doubt whether you will be
returning with me.� Tears flowed down my face as the hopes I�d had were dashed.
Roger openly cried too. �Sorry to disappoint you,� he went on, �What I expect
to happen is that at the end of my stay I will be able to take a fresh set of
terms back to England which the cabinet will debate and amend or reject and
then I may be sent back again. Nothing will happen quickly. As I said Elaine
and to you too Roger, I�m sorry that I cannot whisk you out of this situation
but I will do what I can for you when I see General Cumu tomorrow but, in the
meantime, you will still have to abide by the rules and laws here and not get
yourself into any further trouble.�

From way he said the last remark I
guessed that he had been in on our being sent here in the first place. Although
the meeting went on for a further fifteen minutes we didn�t gain any more
information as to when we would get home and with admonishments from the
Colonel as to our behaviour, we were dismissed.

The following day was spent in IT working
on the report of our trip. From Riku I learned that several dozen girls had,
via the web site, applied for visas to live in Tumali but the government were
going to be very strict in their vetting of the applicants. I gave Roger to her
for the night and I think he was quite pleased to get out of my sight for a
short while.

�Major Entembe wishes to see the three of
you in his office right away.� Riku gave us the news soon after we�d started
work on the third day after our return. There were no chairs in his office that
morning for us to sit on. Not a good omen. 

�Mr. Spencer left for London earlier
today. As expected he wasn�t able to take you with him.� He paused and smiled
while our hearts sank. Again I tried to puzzle out the Gent�s involvement in
the scheme to abduct us and what benefit he got out of it. We knew he�d been
given a room in Government House and each night two young girls had been sent
to his room because we�d seen them in the cafeteria but I suspected he received
a monetary handout as well but from whom? My mind was quickly brought back to
the Major when he went on, �Perhaps you thought I had forgotten about your
outburst the other day Ellie; an outburst that tried to shame me in front of my
superior. I do admire your spirit and the way you�ve changed over the few weeks
you�ve been here but I cannot allow such derogatory statements to go unpunished
and for the last few days I�ve been thinking what form that should take. The
Colonel suggested another visit to the market square�� Roger shook violently
and both Sumala and I had to hold him while he bleated out cries of �NO!�
�Don�t worry Roger, I didn�t decide on that and it might be something you will
enjoy even if Ellie doesn�t.�

I twigged immediately and groaned, �The
Mummy Boy Camp.�

�Yes Ellie. I thought it would be a
suitable punishment for you and a good subject for your next article. I know
you�ve had it up the arse a few times but there it will be done many times a
day and Roger will get to put his prick in men�s arses for the first time.
Sumala, I know you�re not in the least inclined towards boys but you can take
your feelings out on Ellie by using her like the other boys will. Her cunt will
be out of bounds while in the camp. You will spend three nights there and it�s
a two day walk each way although the terrain isn�t as rugged as the way to
Neambu so the journey shouldn�t be as taxing. After your remarks on my kindness
in providing transport last time, do not expect me to do so for this trip.�

Back in the IT room Roger muttered, �You
and your big mouth again! Why can�t you be quiet like you used to be?�

I was about to retort when Sumala stepped
in. �Arguing won�t help. Ever since you failed to take the proper caning at the
whipping post, it was always part of the plan, the game if you like, that we
were to visit the camp so don�t start blaming Ellie, and Ellie it is no good
blaming Roger either. He cannot help being how he is.� Whether what you said to the Major brought it
forward or not is just guesswork. I�ve never had a prick up my arse either or
sucked a man off but I�ve fucked a good few women that way so it will be a new
experience for me too Maybe tonight you�ll let me try you Ellie. You haven�t
had it that way many times and you know that I�ll be careful and with plenty of
cream it shouldn�t be unpleasant and may help prepare your hole for men who
won�t be as careful.� We all had visions of having our bums buggered many times
a day and none of us was looking forward to it. However, the actuality was not
as brutal as we envisioned.

Early the next morning we set off in a
northerly direction. My bottom was a little tender from Sumala�s attention the
previous evening but it was nothing that I couldn�t cope with. He even made
Roger soddomise me first so that I was already partially opened for him. Roger�s
prick was fairly easy to take but I winced a bit when Sumala started to enter
me but once he was in, it was uncomfortable but bearable. I wondered what it
would have been like if he�d fucked me hard like I anticipated would happen at
the Mummy Boy Camp. I thought I would try and get Sumala to have me that way
again before we got to the camp but I was more concerned as to how Roger would
take it. Would he just pass out? And if he did, would it annoy his rapist and
make him cause Roger more pain? I pondered these and other questions as we
plodded along.

As before, the first few miles were
across the relatively flat agricultural land but in a couple of hours the land
and forest rose up in front of us. �We have two choices now,� Sumala informed
us, �We can go on in more or less a straight line through the forest and up
over the mountain, or we can walk around the contours. The mountain way is
shorter and steeper but should be cooler in the shade. The contour route has
less climbing but is a good few miles longer. Time wise, there should be little
in it.�

�Can we go one way and come back the
other Suma?�

�Yes, of course, and I would suggest we
go the steep way and see the scenery. If our arses are sore, we may prefer to
have less climbing on the way back.��
Roger didn�t comment and I noted he was unusually quiet. He�d noticed
that I added the makeshift gag to his pack before leaving.

The path was steep and although we were
in the shade, the atmosphere was very humid and soon all our clothing was
soaked with sweat. After lunch and still on an upward path, the trees began to
thin and a further hour on, we began to cross a plateau until we came to the
rim of an extinct volcanic crater filled with crystal clear blue water. In no
time at all we were slithering down the scree to the water�s edge. Several
times the rope between Roger and I came taut as one of us slid faster than the
other could keep up but generally we ended up laughing about it. The water was
ice cold. It didn�t matter. Dropping our packs and without bothering to remove
our clothing we lowered ourselves into the refreshing water. However the cold
was too much for us to stay in long and we dried ourselves and our clothing in
the hot sun. Reluctantly an hour later we were on the move again.

The climb up the loose scree caused
further merriment and for the first time for days Roger actually laughed. It
was largely a case of two steps forward and one slide back. One such episode
when the connecting rope was nearly taut, Roger slid down and the rope pulled
me on top of him. Neither of us was hurt and both of us grinned when I found
myself cradled in his arms. On an impulse I kissed him and felt his lips on
mine for longer than an affectionate peck. We continued to laugh as we tried to
get to our feet on stones that refused to stay in one place and we ended up on
our bums again. Suddenly his face clouded and took on its usual disturbing
look. �You�re worried at what might happen?�

�I�m not really gay you know Ellie. I�m
not wanting to have sex with men.�

�I know. We�ll get through it though like
we have the rest of this trip. It will work out as long as we stick together
and don�t fight each other.� A shout from Sumala, who had already gained the
rim of the crater, broke our reverie and we started our way up the slope again.

An hour later and over another steep rise
we came to a long, narrow lake. �There is a fishing village at the end of this
lake where we should find shelter for the night. We could go on if you want and
are eager to reach the camp but we�d have to spend the night in the open.�

�We�ll stay,� Roger and I answered
together. We knew Sumala wasn�t eager to get to the camp either.

As we ambled along a good track by the
lakeside, two elderly men came to greet us. �That hat of yours obviously warned
them of our coming,� Sumala jibed. I wore the big, colourful hat I�d bought at
the festival every time I ventured out into the sun mainly because that even
with the sunblock my skin peeled continuously and I hadn�t started to tan due,
no doubt, to my fair skin and hair colour. When they approached Sumala dropped
back behind Roger so I was in the leading position. We hugged and patted each
other on the back in the traditional way and I spoke the few words of halting
greeting I had learned from Sumala and added �Good afternoon Gentlemen.� That
brought laughter to their faces. I introduced Roger and Sumala, even though
they knew him, and then we all made our way to a four grass-hut village.

Other men sat around smoking while the
women gutted and cleaned what looked to me like a good catch of fish. Some were
being filleted and hung on racks to dry. Fortunately the racks were downwind of
the huts so the smell wasn�t overpowering. With Roger now chained to my wrist
again, I was ritually introduced to the elderly men but only one of them spoke
more than one or two words of english. Two of the younger girls did and when I
enquired why, I was told that from the time they were old enough to go to
school until they were of breeding age, they lived in a community dormitory for
girls in Chapoti. The village boys were schooled in Chapoti as well, but they
hadn�t returned to the village.

That night we had a delicious fish stew
and I was able to find out more about the lives of the fishermen and we sat
talking, mainly to the girls but Sumala seemed to be filling the others in on
what was being said and he translated much of what he learned from the men for
us. I wondered what the sleeping arrangements would be and why I hadn�t been
fucked during the evening but I�d forgotten that having Roger chained to me
prevented them from asking. I remembered when I saw the English speaking man
looking intently and me and with his erection showing below his shorts. In a
whisper, I asked Sumala about the protocol and he replied, �Just ask him if he
would care to fuck a white woman.� I did and that seemed to be the signal for
others to grab a woman. I think Roger wanted one of the younger girls but the
other men beat him to it. A woman that looked very much older than him, late
fifties or early sixties I would have guessed, jumped up and grabbed his prick.
Nevertheless she got him hard but she had to wait until my partner finished
before we could get into a position where the chain didn�t get in the way. I
suppose I could have transferred the chain to her but I didn�t largely because
I doubted Roger wanted to be with her too long. The woman was old enough to be
his mother, or even his grandmother, but he didn�t take to her like he did to
Riku.

We slept in a hut with an old couple but
the man could still get an erection and he kept going for ages before he spent
his load. Roger lay on his back beside me while the woman worked herself on
him. Sumala had better luck in that he had both the younger girls during the
night. Roger was peeved when Sumala told us and I guess he blamed me again for
not giving him to one of them.

We set off late the next morning and
didn�t hurry overmuch trying to arrive, we hoped, about when dinner would be
served. Midway through the afternoon we descended to a wide dirt road which
Sumala said was the main highway between the cablecar station and the Mummy Boy
Camp. Having had Roger linked to me all day by the waist rope, both of us were
glad to exchange it for wrist cuffs and rub some cream into the chafe marks on
our bodies.

The road followed the route of the Songwe
River but several hundred feet above it so we had splendid views of the river
and across into Tanzania. This made the walk quite pleasant especially as we
didn�t have to force the pace. Several times lorries slowed down and would have
given us a lift but I waved them on. For once, Roger didn�t disapprove. After a
couple of miles we came to a roadside stall and bought flavoured water and
flatbread filled with a savoury mixture and sat in the shade to eat them. �How
much further Suma?�

�A few miles only.�

�I don�t think I�m gay,� Roger blurted
out, repeating what he�d told me earlier, �I�ve enjoyed it when I�ve fucked
women. It�s just that I was always too shy to do anything about it.�

�I know,� I said sympathetically, �And
neither is Suma, and I�m not either for that matter, but this is just another
trial they are putting us through.�

�Ted�s behind it you know.� I looked at
him in askance, �I saw an email when I went to Riku�s office the other day. I
wasn�t supposed to see it so don�t blab it to the Major or anyone so she gets
into trouble. The stories of our hardships are selling �Today�s World� and also
�The Real World Today� an underground DVD publication where there�s no
censorship. He wanted us to have more experiences that would excite the
readers. Perhaps we should just write a travel type journal with details of the
lovely scenery.�

�And annoy the Major so that we end up in
the market square again. No thank you Roger!�

We sat and talked as long as we dared,
knowing that the lorry drivers would probably have informed those at the camp
of our position. �You�re worried about this too, aren�t you Suma?� His face had
lost its cheerful smile. He nodded. �Just think, it cannot be worse than the
whipping you had.�

�No, but it will be very much more
embarrassing � and there won�t be a nice nurse to look after us afterwards
either.� He did smile at that remark.

We trudged on. Dust clung to our sweaty
bodies and clothes and we hoped we�d be able to shower when we got there. My
spirits sank when we came to the camp gate. The Mummy Boy Camp was situated on
a peninsula at the far north-western corner of Tumali and the entrance to it
was blocked with a high, razor-wire fence. It reminded me of a concentration camp
from which there was no escape. Armed guards stood by the entrance gates and I
wondered if we were actually going to be allowed out in three days or whether
this was a ruse to confine us here permanently. I half trusted the Major over
this, but I wouldn�t have put it past him to extend our stay if it suited his
schemes. However, on remembering what Ted�s email said, I guessed there were
other ordeals planned for us.

&nbsp;

Chapter nineteen. Mummy Boy Camp
welcome

Obviously our arrival had been witnessed
because we�d hardly reached the gates before they opened and two armed guards
escorted us to an office in the main building where a burly Tumalian greeted us
with a surprisingly friendly smile. �So you are the ones who wanted to sample
the delights of our camp. I�m Captain Quaro.� He extended his hand in Sumala�s
direction but I stepped forward and shook it.

��Elaine Eves, and no, we didn�t wish to come
here but the Major had other ideas.� 

�Same difference,� he grinned. I
introduced the others more or less to let him know I was in charge and he began
to accept that. He went on to explain some of the rules which basically allowed
us to have sex with anyone, and they with us, provided it didn�t interfere with
working and it wasn�t allowed in various other areas. Much like the rules for
women in the rest of Tumali. For the next few days I was to be considered as a
being man and used as though my vagina didn�t exist. �I�ll get a girl to show
you to your dormitory and give you a tour of the place and then bring you back
here so I can sample the delights of a white boy�s arse before dinner and I�ve
no doubt my sergeant will wish to sample yours Miss Ellie. After dinner you
will be given the standard welcome and at bedtime, I expect you�ll have plenty
of offers of sleeping partners. You Ellie, will be expected to suck prick and
take them up your arse, the two men, will have to do the same but can also ask
others to reciprocate. You can do it with each other too. There are plenty of
lubricants available although most of the inmates don�t need them now but you
are allowed to ask for lubrication to be used. During the daytimes, the Major
has ordered that you are allowed to visit freely with the various work groups
and interview and photograph them.�

We were dismissed and a �girl�, a
feminine looking boy wearing a skirt and false breasts showed us around and we
were able to stow our packs in a dormitory. �What did the Captain mean when he
said we�d be given the standard welcome?� I asked sensing from the way the
words had been spoken, that it would not just be a speech of introduction.

�I�m sorry,� our guide said, �If he
didn�t tell you, then I hadn�t better tell you either. I get spanked enough as
it is.� He lifted his skirt and showed us a well reddened bum. �All us girls
get spanked before being fucked but we don�t mind most of the time except when
the Captain uses the strap or cane as punishment.� We all now realised some
pain, besides being fucked in the bottom, would be involved. Roger started to
shake, and I squeezed his hand tightly to show my support but there was little
enough I could do.

The Captain and two other men were
waiting for us when we returned to his office. �Here they are men. Three
newbies ready for our pleasure, two of them seem to be arse virgins. Strip off
then and get ready. Did the girl give you some cream?�

�Yes sir,� I answered and produced it
from my handbag. 

�Okay bluestone boss lady, get them to
bend over my desk and put some around their holes and on our pricks.� Roger
stood shaking and I half expected him for pass out but he didn�t and I gently
pushed him over the desk. The pricks on the men were quite normal for Tumalian
men, and indeed were slightly smaller than Sumala�s so I wasn�t too concerned
although I knew they wouldn�t be as gentle with me as he was. Being still
linked to Roger made it a little awkward but the men soon realised they had to
come to me to have their prick treated.

�Girls get spanked before fucking.� 

�Typical of this country,� I thought, �We
get raped and beaten and the men get the pleasure.� It therefore came as a
surprise when Captain Quaro put his left hand on Roger�s back and brought his
right hand down hard on his arse. It was a surprise for Roger too and he
screamed at the top of his voice. At the third hard slap, much to the amazement
of the three men, he passed out. �His body cannot take any pain sir,� I pointed
out, �He cannot help it sir so please don�t punish him further.� Roger woke up
but the captain�s hand didn�t let him rise up. 

I watched as he pushed his prick into the
brown hole and moaned when he couldn�t enter. �Pull his bum cheeks apart
Ellie,� he ordered. I did so and tried to encourage Roger to open up but he was
shaking so much that I feared he might pass out again. Eventually the captain
gained an entrance and started to fuck properly. I could see Sumala was already
impaled and then my turn came. In a way I was glad I�d had in that way before
and knew what to expect and was able to relax enough to make it almost enjoyable.
I took the sergeant quietly and even tried to push against him a little. Roger
though, cried and bawled the whole time. The captain was disgusted and brought
his hand down on Roger�s arse again. �You will wear her skirt little baby
girl,� he seethed, �She can wear your shorts.� Fortunately there was no rule
that we had to suck them clean afterwards. I found out later there had been
disease problems some years previously and now there were a supply of tissues
always on hand for that purpose.

Our guide was again summoned to take us
to the lounge and to find Roger a padded, flesh coloured bra. I tried to uplift
his spirits a little but I wasn�t too successful. �How was it with you Suma? I
saw you had an erection afterwards.�

�Could have been worse. His prick kept
hitting my prostate so that caused me to get a hard-on and almost to shoot my
load. I suppose I can now see why some men might like it but I still prefer a
girl�s cunt.�

�Our girl� introduced us to a number of
men who questioned me about our being there, how we coped with being chained
together, and life in England until a bell summoned us to dinner. We were
surprised they made no attempt to fuck us but we rightly guessed, that would
wait until after our welcome. 

At the end of the meal the captain called
for silence and addressed every one. �Ladies,� (I could see others dressed as
girls) and gentlemen, we have three visitors sent by our government on a fact
finding mission to the Mummy Boy Camp. Two are from England and the other is a
Tumalian who is here to guide them on our customs, not that he knows much of
the customs in this camp. [Laughter] One of the English is a real woman, Ellie,
but she is to be treated like a man and in fact, she is in charge of the other
two. She has bluestone status so she is above most of you in rank. You are to
respect her. Her companion, Roger, as you can see from his dress, is a mummy�s
boy and a very timid one at that. I have already found out that she falls
asleep at the slightest pain so you may have to be a little careful in what you
do with her. Major Entembe has ordered that Ellie and Roger be kept chained
together at all times so we must work around that and make allowances for the
fact that they must be together. For two full days they are to experience life
here in the same way as you, except they will not be assigned work schedules.
Instead they will visit and see what you do. Feel free to answer factual
questions but don�t become embroiled in arguments concerning the ethics of our
government. Tell them about your work, your lives here and your lovers and of
course they will be living in the community with you. Treat them as you do each
other.�

�Hurry up and get it over with,� I
muttered to myself. No one had mentioned the welcome yet.

�As they are going to part of our
community, albeit for only two days, we must give them our traditional welcome.
Ladies and gentlemen, let us adjourn to the wall. Gentlemen, if you wish to
partake in their welcome, please take a token from the jar on the way out.�

The �wall� proved to be a long,
counter-like structure about two and a half feet high and a foot broad. There
were straps at intervals that I guessed were for restraining us. The wall was
long enough to take ten people so there was plenty of space for the three of
us. We were all made to bend over the wall and fastened down with a strap
across our backs. I could see that Roger was in a bad way again, shaking
miserably and crying, and I had to support him on the walk and try to calm him
a little by actually putting the strap over his back before letting them strap
me down. Further straps pulled our knees apart so that our holes were wide
open. Numbers were being called out as cream was inserted into our bottom holes
and as each number was called a man�s voice acknowledged and yelled with
pleasure. I found out that three were selected for each of our bottom holes and
three more for us to suck off. None of the �girls� had been allowed to take a
token. I kept squeezing Roger�s hand to reassure him but I could tell that his
fear would soon overcome his consciousness. His tears were dripping on to the
floor and he was sobbing uncontrollably. My attention was soon taken by a prick
being pushed in my arse and another offered to my mouth. Obviously they were
used to having sex in this way and easily and calmly fucked until first the one
in my arse came and then I tasted sperm in my mouth. As far as I was concerned
it was more uncomfortable than painful. With hardly a break the second and then
the third pair took me. I tried to wiggle my bottom but the straps largely
prevented that although I was able to bob my head and soon had my third quota
of sperm. They didn�t release me but I could turn my attention first to Roger
who was still resisting and who had only just started to have his second pair.
Sumala on my other side was servicing his last.

�He�s a useless girl!� I turned my head
back to Roger. The man at his rear had withdrawn and apparently was having
difficulty in reinserting his prick. SLAP, SLAP, SLAP, SLAP, SLAP. I felt
Roger�s hand go slack. His assailant took the opportunity to thrust prick in
and complete his fucking. 

Roger still hadn�t come round properly
when the third man stood ready. �No, no!� I yelled, �Use me instead. You�ll
kill him!� Roger turned his head towards me and I thought he was going to say,
�whore� but he muttered thanks and drifted off again.

My hole felt very tender and I walked a
little bow-legged afterwards but I knew I wasn�t seriously hurt. For a long
while I stood alongside the wall comforting Roger and for the most part, the
others left us alone. �Suma, are you fit enough to carry him to the dorm
please?�

�Of course Boss Lady.� He threw him
across his shoulders like a sack of corn and laid him on a bed. Vaguely I
noticed that someone had pushed two side by side so we could each have a bed
partner and still be chained together. It appeared that, like in the rest of
Tumali, my being chained to Roger marked him as mine and no one with lesser
status to me, would molest us without being granted permission. We lay and
cuddled for a while and in conversations with the others, found that many of
the gay men had loving, long-term relationships and had feelings for our
plight. They brought juice and tried to make us comfortable and when Roger at
last got an erection, probably more from my body rubbing against him than from
the naked men around us, one of them asked to suck him off. I wished one would
do the same for me but they didn�t consider my clit as being a prick
substitute.

Going to the toilet was a little painful
or perhaps rather uncomfortable would describe it better, and yet it seemed
that I had to go. Roger admitted that he needed to as well. Probably the sperm
inside us acted like an enema. Two of the younger men stopped me as I returned
and one asked, �May I spend the night in your bed?� I agreed and when the other
asked to sleep with Roger and promised several times not to hurt him, I agreed
to that too. I did have to take him up my arse but he was very gentle and
played with my tits as well so eventually I climaxed. �It�s nice to feel real
tits again, so different from the false ones the �girls� here wear.� I didn�t
hear Roger cry out and I found out that his partner had only fondled his prick
and made him return the favour.

&nbsp;

Chapter twenty. The Birthing Clinic

�How did the rest of your stay there go?�
Riku asked, �I read the part you wrote today and that seemed pretty traumatic.�

We�d arrived back late the previous day.
Shelumba told us the Major was rather annoyed as he�d sent a proper car for us
but that had perforce to go via the cablecar station and the dirt road to the
camp. We�d made an early start and had turned off that road on to the contour
track before the car reached us. �The Major wanted to see you before he went
away for a few days but I know it can wait until he returns,� Shelumba informed
us but didn�t elaborate and we were left wondering if he�d another ordeal
planned for us. We spent the first day back writing up our report and decided
to spend the night in the community house.

As soon as we arrived a young girl from a
neighbouring house came and asked, �Can I have Roger like Sanle did?� Seeing
the disappointment on Riku�s face she added, �I�ll bring him back by bedtime if
you like.� A smile lit her face when we agreed. Riku, I realised, liked to have
Roger in bed with her as a companion to cuddle and not just for his prick. Now,
after the evening meal, we sat at a table outside where it was cooler and
taking out my laptop showed her some of the pictures and began my story.

�I quickly found that the inmates were
not the brutal raping men I had envisaged. Some of the guards were, but the
others were respectful and treated us with care, almost love. My being a real
woman caused a bit of a rumpus at breakfast on the first morning. Halfway through
I yanked Roger to his feet and ran for the door. One of the guards gave chase
but I got to the toilet just in time to lean over the pan and be sick. Roger
looked worried and I seemed unduly pale when I looked in the mirror and washed
my face. All eyes were on us when the guard escorted us back to the Captain�s
table. He looked at me quizzically but I said, �Sorry, morning sickness. I�m
pregnant. I can only pretend to be a man part of the time.� For some reason the
whole table erupted in laughter.�

�I can well imagine that caused a stir in
a men only camp.�

�Yeah. The captain made me see the camp
doctor but he didn�t have much experience of women�s problems either.�

For the rest of the evening I went
through the life at the camp as I saw it. How it was like a self-contained
village with trained craftsmen doing woodwork, plumbing, and electrics and
other doing what would be considered household chores cooking and cleaning. By
now a small crowd had gathered around my table, staring at the pictures on the
screen and listening to my tale. �Did they bum fuck you often?� one asked.

�Not during the day except when a guard
decided he had more authority than me. Suma had to take more but he also had to
put his prick in a good few too. I didn�t have that problem,� 

�How did you feel about that Suma?� Riku
asked. After my �rape� at the community house, Sumala hardly left my side when
I was away from Government House.

�I still would rather put my prick in a
girl�s cunt, or even her arse, but I began to get some idea of the satisfaction
they got out of it. You girls know what it is like to have a prick in your
bumhole and what it was like the first few times, well it was like that for me
but also the prick stimulated my prostate and I got one hellava hard-on. The
feeling when I fucked a boy was not much different to when I�ve fucked a girl�s
arse except the boys there were more open and easier to get my prick in. I
wouldn�t want to be limited to that one way of fucking though but I think I am
more tolerant of gay boys now. I hated being kissed by them. That seemed so
much more revolting and utterly repulsive especially when they hadn�t shaved.�
Suma adjusted the girl on his knee and played with her breasts.

�So it wasn�t one big orgy then Ellie?�
an unknown girl asked.

�No more than here. Most work during the
day and so are not available. The worst were the guards but fortunately there
wasn�t too many of them. They had the power to use a strap on anyone shirking
and several times we witnessed a boy being forced to bend over and take six or
eight hard whacks with the strap and usually the guard would fuck them
afterwards and they did it really hard.�

�What was the journey back like?�

�Actually it was remarkably pleasant. The
route was hilly rather than mountainous and we stayed overnight at quite a
large village, about a dozen huts. Suma and Roger were spoilt for choice of
young females and there were to be several young lads too and I tried a couple
of them. Roger�s humour began to come back when I chained him to a young girl
that he seemed to fancy. The village had a hut put aside for visitors because
the route was fairly well used, indeed we met various other people on the way,
and so we were able to take our choices back to the hut for the night. Nothing
abnormal for this country happened.�

*****

�The Major says you are to go to the
Birthing Clinic for a check-up,� Shelumba informed me when we arrived for work
the next day, �And you can spend the day there to do a piece on it.� I must
have looked surprised as I hadn�t seen the Major since our return and thought
we�d pissed him off over not getting back earlier in the car he�d sent. That
wasn�t our fault but that wouldn�t matter to him. �He heard about your morning
sickness at the camp,� Shelumba went on to explain.

Roger looked a little pale at the thought
and asked if I could chain him to Riku for the day but that request was refused
on the grounds that she had access to information that we shouldn�t see. What
surprised me more was that Sumala wasn�t keen on going either but I told both
of them bluntly, �You are coming with me. It will do you good to see what us
women have to go through after you�ve had your pleasure with us.�

Really I didn�t know what to expect
either. Having slept in grass huts and seen Wyche�s form of medicine, I half
expected something fairly primitive. Instead I found a modern maternity
hospital that would have put our London teaching hospitals to shame but when I
thought about it, baby sales and adoption were the main source of income for
the country and therefore they needed to get as many healthy babies for sale as
possible. There was also the fact that with almost forced unprotected sex,
there was a far higher proportion of babies per population to deal with.

The hospital was clean, light and
air-conditioned and the staff too all looked clean and efficiently dealt with
my routine check-up in the attached clinic. Two main differences became
immediately apparent; the patients and visitors (including us soon after our
arrival) were all naked � �It saves a lot of time and is more hygienic than
often unwashed clothes,� the matron informed me and then told us to have a
shower and to use the special germicidal soap. The other noticeable difference
was that there were no private rooms or cubicles where the birthing took place.
Most of the nurses too were in various stages of pregnancy. Roger had a little
smile on his face and the start of an erection at the sight of the women with
grossly extended bellies, waddling around the ward. They took it in good humour
and tried to tease him by wriggling their bodies suggestively and laughingly
offered to take him to bed. I guess the sight didn�t stimulate Sumala because
his prick remained flaccid.

�Roger�s working,� I informed them,
�Maybe later after we�ve seen the sights and he�s freaked out at seeing a baby
born, I�ll chain him to one of you for comfort.�

�We�ll hold you to that,� a large woman
who looked to be near the end of her fertile life chuckled, �He can even have a
soothing suckle and some milk he hasn�t had since he was born.�

Matron re-joined us. �Sorry,� she
apologised, �I got called away. Don�t take too much notice of the ladies; they
haven�t seen a man for a couple of days or so. We don�t normally allow men on
the wards mainly because they get in the way and they seem to have problems
with seeing the blood and stuff when a baby is born. Looks like yours might
have trouble too after the way he went pale when I took your blood sample. By
all means chain him to one of the other women. Suma may be okay but if he�s a
problem we can send him outside to watch through the observation window. We�re
expecting two births today. One�s a first timer so you will get an idea of what
you might go through and the other will be her eighth and should be much
easier. We have a fully equipped operating theatre and surgeons on call if
there are problems or if a caesarean is necessary.� 

For half an hour we toured the facility
and we were most impressed by the cleanliness and standard of hygiene. I
reckoned it was far higher than in any NHS hospital and because all the nurses
were women, and most were pregnant, they had a far greater empathy with their
patients. The mothers-to-be quickly noticed the slight swelling of my stomach
and accepted me �as one of them� and chatted to me without the reserve an
outsider, and a white woman at that, would normally receive.

At first it was more of the good natured
banter about having a slave boy that I had learned to field from most women and
Roger tried to ignore but then one of the older women asked about my stripes
which still showed on my back and arse although I only felt them now when I sat
down hard or put pressure on my shoulders. A number of them had seem my
thrashing and told me that a week later the whipping master had felt his own
whip but it wasn�t as hard as the flogging Sumala received. My bluestone came
in for much comment too and even though, in theory at least, I was above them
in status, I was treated as an equal.

Suddenly, N�lla the young, first time
mother-to-be, asked, �Do you know who is the father of your baby?�

�Major Entembe.�

She nodded in an understanding way and I
sensed a story especially when she said, �Colonel Nubaro.�

�How do you know?�

For a short while she hesitated to answer
and seemingly making up her mind, went on, �The top people in government are
informed by the community house supervisors when a girl is ready for breeding
and the prettiest ones are taken to Government House. The others are fucked and
bred by any men that are around or who are chosen. Often the supervisors are
given a present to allow the richer men to breed a virgin. Two of us were ready
at the same time and I was pleased that I was considered pretty enough to be
taken to Government House. General Cumu and the Colonel inspected us and spent
some time talking and asking questions. I was a bit tongue-tied at being with
such high-ranking people but the other girl chatted freely and laughed a lot.
The General chose her and I went with the Colonel. He bred me for seventeen
days��

�Much the same as the Major did with me
except that I was with him only a few days and had my whipping then too,� I
interrupted.

�You hadn�t been bred before?� N�lla�s
voice showed her surprise and the others echoed her.

This led to a long discussion and in
general, the women preferred their system where they were free to have many
different men. �� like that�� one of them laughed and nodded to a bed further
along the ward and I saw Sumala had a young woman bent over the side of the bed
and was fucking hard. She must have aroused him pretty quickly and I found out
later the pair knew each other and had spent a number of nights together in the
past.

�You�re supposed to be working Suma!� I
called out and everyone laughed. Even the matron didn�t stop him.

For a while I tried to discus how they
felt about giving up the babies and most believed it to be a part of life but
it seemed to me there was an inner sense of loss that they shut out and were
elated when they were allowed to keep a child.

Later that morning I witnessed my first
birth. It was the woman�s eighth and she had little trouble. As it was a �for
sale� baby, a curtain was drawn across the top half of her so she could not
even glimpse her baby before it was taken away. To me that was very sad but
practical in that there would be no bond between the mother and child. Most of
the other mothers-to-be stood around and watched while the nurses did their
job. I had some idea of what to expect from a film we were shown in sex
education at school but I was hardly prepared for the reality of the pain and
mess and to a certain extent, the smell that accompanied it. The sight
fascinated and excited me and it wasn�t until I felt the pull on my wrist
chain, that I remembered Roger. He�d passed out.

One of the others helped him up and I took
him to a motherly woman and clipped the chain to her. Before I returned to the
birthing, she�d cuddled him closely and he was suckling her breast.

�Would you mind if I sent Suma out?� a
nurse asked. He was looking a bit sick too.

�Yeah, of course. He�s only of any use at
conception; at delivering the goods he�s useless.� That amused the others.

During lunch, which Suma and I had with
the staff, a nurse came in and informed us, �N�lla, the first timer is going
into labour.� Roger was still cuddled to the woman I�d chained him to and was
doing his best not to hear the noises emanating from the nearby bed. N�lla was
obviously in pain but the nurses didn�t look concerned. After a quick
examination, the matron said all was normal. �Shall I give her a wiffle stick?�
asked the nurse and when the matron nodded a piece of round wood about as thick
as my thumb and six inches long, was produced and N�lla gripped this with her
teeth. It reminded me of the makeshift gag we�d used on Roger. 

At first I thought it was only something
for the girl to bite on but the matron said, �It is the wood from a special
tree that Wyche knows and the substances it produces have a relaxing and
calming effect.� She gave me one to take back with me. I sniffed it and found
the smell aromatic but it is not a smell that I recognised or can really
describe. �Wyche says there is just one small tree that she knows of so we have
to wash each stick after each use and store them for another woman�s birth.
They�re not always required for the second and later births though, as you saw
with the older woman.� I found it a strange admixture of modern technology with
what was almost witchcraft.

N�lla�s labour lasted most of the
afternoon and she underwent a good deal more pain before a little baby girl
finally emerged. The wholesome smile of satisfaction on N�lla�s face as the
baby fed from her breast was enough to make me feel broody and long for the
time when my baby was born although seeing what she went through, caused me to
think of the labour pains and I wondered if at a London hospital, I would be
given drugs to induce my baby. Much to Roger�s disgust, I promised to return
the next day to see how N�lla was.

�The wiffle stick does make a great deal
of difference,� N�lla told me next day as I held her darling baby. �It reduces
the pain and almost takes you out of your body so it feels sort of like you are
watching yourself.� I guessed it contained a natural hallucinogenic drug

�I don�t think I could ever give away a
baby of mine.� The tiny baby tried to suckle my breast and wriggled in my arms
when no milk was forthcoming.

�It is difficult for some mothers here
too but I suppose we are conditioned to it and if you never see it and never have
it against your breast, it is not such a great miss. We do get to feed other
babies too for six weeks or so but never your own.� We talked for a long while
to her and the woman whose baby had been taken away but left when we found that
talking about giving away her child upset the woman. I guessed there was always
an underlying desire for the women to keep and raise their children that the
conditioning couldn�t completely eradicate.

&nbsp;

�How would you feel about having your
baby here?� the Major asked when we were summoned to his office. My mind went
into overdrive. Was he hinting that we would be kept here until after my child
was born? Did he intend to take my baby and raise it as his own? To sell it?
Seeing the look of horror on my face he went on, �It�s okay Ellie, you will be
going home when the General�s pardon comes through but the negotiations seemed
to be stalled at the moment. No I was really asking about the treatment you
might get here as compared to Britain.�

I knew the answer to that. �I would be
better having the baby here rather than an impersonal maternity block in a
large hospital.� I paused for a long while, �But it might take six months
before I got home again- if I ever did!�

�No, Ellie. If you came back as a special
visitor, you would be given a proper visa and would return at the end of your
visit with your baby. You know the rules here now and conforming to them
doesn�t seem to be a problem and you would still have your bluestone status.
Only the court can take that away from you and you wouldn�t have Roger chained
to you all the time, even if you brought him. Perhaps you�d like to do a follow
up series of articles?�

I wouldn�t commit myself but that night I
lay awake for a long time wondering just how much longer we would be kept in Tumali.
For some time now, I had begun to enjoy much of my life here but still I
yearned to see my friends at home. �But you don�t have many of them, do you?� I
told myself, �You have more friends in Chapoti than in London. You were too shy
to even go into a pub then, now look at you. You talk to anyone, show you body
freely and allow yourself to be publicly fucked. How you�ve changed. Do you
really want to go back?� In the end I decided that I did but might consider
returning to have the baby. If only I could get a cast iron guarantee that I
would be allowed to go home afterwards and take my baby with me.

&nbsp;

Chapter twenty-one. Roger deflowers a
virgin

�Hi all of ya,� Pelo, a woman I knew from
a previous visit as being the �mother� in charge of the girls� home greeted us.
We were sitting at a table outside Riku�s the community house and had just
finished eating. �Ellie, one of my girls, Waunu, is due to become a woman in a
few days and has asked that Roger be the one to perform the ceremony and in
fact she wishes to be linked to him for a few days until she is likely to be
pregnant. Would you allow that? Is it possible?� 

I turned to Riku sitting across the table
from me. �She wants a light baby like Sanle? I can give permission for her to
use Roger but if they are linked for more than a night, she would have to be
with him at work or we would have to give him time off, and that might not be
allowed.�

�You could send him on an assignment to
find out how girls become women here. In fact that could work out quite well.
We have three more work days and then a two day holiday. We could send him on
the evening before the last working day and she could have him for three days
in a row with no work problems. If she�s fertile, that should be long enough.�

�How would you feel about going on an
outside assignment on your own Roger?� Since Sanle I knew he�d had a number of
different girls but he�d never had a virgin. I saw him hesitate and made his
mind up for him. He seemed to expect that. �Yes, if we can work out details, he�ll
do it.� Roger�s eyes opened wide and the three of us women laughed.

�Perhaps he should also compare the way
he makes the girl a woman to how it is done to most girls,� Riku suggested.
�There�ll be a good deal of difference because of the chain. If she wants,
Waunu will have him for her exclusive use whereas other girls are inseminated
three times by different men without a break that first time and several men
will have her on the following days. She may not be able to choose who does it
although quite often she arranges a boy she likes to do the deed.�

�That will work out fine too,� Pelo
confirmed, �There�s another girl due at about the same time and I doubt she is
pretty enough for the government people to want her. I�ll let people know so
they will witness it on Wednesday evening, Thursday is a school day for her but
she can drag him along and show him to her friends, and I expect the teacher
will get him talking to the classes. Friday and Saturday are holidays and she
can release him for work on Sunday. I�ll arrange for the other girl to become a
woman on Saturday.�

Chaining Roger to Riku I went with Pelo
to the girls� home and was introduced to Waunu. Sanle was with her and it was
obvious they were friends and had discussed Roger. Sanle greeted me and patted
her stomach. �I�m over a week late so I guess Roger�s baby has started
growing.� Her face lit up with the huge smile so characteristic of Tumalians. I
gave her a hug and then one to Waunu. The girl was shorter and plumper than
Sanle and already had a more motherly appearance. �She�ll do nicely for Roger,�
I thought, �He always seems to be more in tune with the less outwardly
attractive girls; the model types. Perhaps that is why he is attracted to Riku
� and me!�

�Waunu, and you too Pelo, has Sanle told
you about Roger�s shyness?� They both indicated that she had, �Well I suggest
that you keep the number of witnesses to the very minimum otherwise he might
fail to perform.�

�Don�t worry, Ellie,� Sanle exclaimed, �I
kept some of Wyche�s cream from the festival. He�ll perform all night!�

&nbsp;

Roger guessed I�d something up my sleeve
when I chained him to me as we left Government House after work on Wednesday. I
hadn�t done that for ages. He was even more perplexed when we called at a stall
and I bought enough savoury filled flatbread for two people and put them in his
pack. Knowing I wouldn�t tell him anything, he asked Riku but she could
honestly say, �I don�t know either Roger. Ellie hasn�t planned anything with
me.� I think he began to have some idea when Waunu met us and I introduced her
to him. Fortunately after the initial shock he seemed to take a liking to her
and didn�t demure when a few hundred yards further on I clipped his chain to
her left wrist. �He�s all yours,� I told her, �But make sure he keeps his prick
in his trousers until later!� 

It was nearly 7:30 when Waunu led him
into �our� community hut. �You two get along okay?� I asked and Roger nodded
and surprisingly added, �Thanks.� They�d sat in the park and talked while they
ate their flatbread and then petted for a while.

The reception he had at the neighbouring
community house where Waunu had been given a bed, was less pleasant, almost
hostile. I know it brought back memories of the festival and his dealings with
the marauders but this time there was no Sanle to protect him. Waunu being much
younger, had no experience in dealing with the adolescent boys who mocked them
both. Roger was in tears again and Waunu had wet eyes. I didn�t want to
interfere but in the end I soundly berated the boys until they turned on me but
with Sumala and other adults from the house by my side, there was never likely
to be any trouble. However, as they moved away, one of them called back, �If
your boyfriend can have our girl, we should be able to have his.�

�Later,� I laughed and then realised I
had given them an open invitation to fuck me. Sumala�s arm wrapped around my
shoulders and I knew that was to let them know that I was his for the time
being and that I was under his protection. We ignored the three teenagers while
we prepared the bed for Waunu�s nuptials. I wondered if it was normal, but a
fairly large crowd gathered around the bed, Pelo explained, �It�s your white
boyfriend, they�re curious to see how he performs.� I hoped Roger didn�t hear
that otherwise it would put even more pressure on him. 

�I thought you didn�t allow children to
witness these events?� I queried after seeing a young girl standing close to
the bed.

�Not as a general rule but Resu there, is
due to become a woman in a few days so she gets to see what happens. Most
children will have seen people naked and fucking many times even when they�re
not supposed to. They also get sex instruction in school so they know what it
is all about.� To my embarrassment, Pelo went on with a grin on her face, �Some
even saw you in the park during the festival and were telling the others
exactly what you got up to when I overheard them.� 

My face went very red. �I thought
children weren�t allowed in��

�They�re not, but children being what
they are, find ways of getting into things that are forbidden to them. Mind
you, they all had a dose of the strap when we found out.�

At this point it was obvious that Roger
wasn�t going to get hard, indeed he was very nervous and shaking at the thought
of performing the ceremony in front of everyone but Sanle must have briefed
Waunu well. I only caught a glimpse of the cream on her finger when she cuddled
Roger on top of her and began to fondle his prick. For long minutes it seemed
as if nothing would happen and I began to wonder if it was outdated, but slowly
his cock began to grow and soon it was fiercely hard. He knew what to do and it
only took a couple of thrusts before he was fully entered and fucking like
normal. �It seemed very little different to having a non virgin,� he told me
later, �I felt her hymen but it gave way easily. I don�t think many of the
onlookers knew I�d done it and Waunu didn�t feel any real pain and, as you saw,
she didn�t bleed much. Perhaps Tumalian women are like that.�

To everyone�s amazement, except those of
us who knew the reason, Roger continued fucking even after shooting his seed
twice. Waunu appeared to be in ecstasy but, knowing what Roger�s prick was like
after using the cream at the festival, I wondered how sore she would be in the
morning. After a good half an hour of watching the performance, couples started
drifting away or using the nearby beds. The three youths kept eyeing me and I
knew I would have to make good my promise but I wanted it to be on my own home
ground. �Take me back to Riku�s, Suma please,� I whispered, �I want you first
and then they can have the left-overs.� Raising my eyebrows at the boys, I
indicated for them to follow. Fortunately Roger didn�t notice otherwise I guess
he would have called me a slut or a whore again.� 

Sumala sensed that I wanted to keep the
boys waiting and took his time. Perhaps that wasn�t a good idea because they
were very aggressive by the time I was ready for them and ploughed into me hard
and furiously, but for all their waiting, they didn�t last long. One apparently
had me in the park and decided this time he wanted my arse but after my
experience in the Mummy Boy Camp, it wasn�t a real problem.

However sore Waunu was in the morning,
she carted him off to school with her while I had to return to work for the
day.

Saturday evening we gathered in another
community hut to witness the initiation of Resu, a much taller and skinnier
girl than Waunu and one whose breasts were still hardly developed and yet she
looked older. She also looked very apprehensive. A late developer I concluded.
�A business man has paid to fuck her the first time,� Pelo told me, �And then
she chose two men from her father�s farm. She knows them but I think it was her
father that really made the choice. She�ll have a rougher time than Waunu.�

So it proved. The business man was always
on he lookout for thin girls particularly, because they were often so much
tighter than the plumper ones and he liked to hear them squeal when he forced
his prick into them. �Does the money go to the girl?� I asked.

�No. We all get a third, the girl, the
house for its upkeep and a third for me for arranging it.� Well at least there
was some compensation for the girl. This seemed akin to prostitution, not only
illegal in Tumali but also unnecessary, but I kept my thoughts to myself.

The man was tall and slim and, compared
with his countrymen, was not overly well endowed. �Perhaps that is why he wants
virgins,� I thought. His prick was still as big as Roger�s though.

Resu�s defloration was not a tender
affair. On the man�s instructions, no one prepared the girl for her ordeal; she
lay shaking slightly on the bed surrounded by a small group on onlookers. I had
no doubt that under the knickers she still wore, her vagina was still dry and
entry would be painful. Later, I found out that is what was ordered and paid
for.

While a few men called out encouragement,
the man just walked into the room and removed his trousers.� Without a word he ripped Resu�s knickers off,
spread her legs and thrust his prick into her tight opening. She gave a loud
scream. Some of the men grinned but most of the women looked sad or upset;
they, like me, knew that the trauma could affect the way she viewed sex for the
rest of her life. A pleasant experience first time would most likely encourage
her to give pleasure in the future but I wasn�t sure that would happen with
Risu. She bled considerably and that didn�t help matters especially as the next
man had to wait until she�d been cleaned up a little. I was very glad the Major
took his time with me even if it had changed me into a slut.

Risu still sobbed pitifully when the
second man pushed his prick into her. He was a little more considerate but the
previous sight must have over aroused him because he came very quickly. Her
last inseminator was much older and took his time and at least tried to cause
the least amount of pain. Had he been the only one to fuck her, she could well
have enjoyed it but after the earlier hurtful entries, her face showed nothing
but revulsion. Perhaps after the man spent the night with her, things would
improve. As Sumala led me away, I reminded myself how lucky I was to have been
taken by an experienced and careful lover.

Chapter twenty-two. In prison

We stood in front of the Major�s desk
like errant school children. There were no chairs so we knew we were in trouble
and he was clearly not in a good mood. The summons came a few days after a
holiday, a holiday that we�d spent in the children�s community homes. We�d
written a piece on them and were impressed with the welfare and care the
children received and the standard of their schooling. Two boys had been
chastised while we were there but we didn�t consider the punishment excessive
considering the country that we were in. It was no more than children received
in England thirty years previously. I tried to think of anything we could have
done wrong but nothing came to mind.

�Colonel Nubaro has received a complaint
from your editor about the last few articles you�ve written and he reprimanded
me because I approved them. They were considered, in Ted�s words, to be too
�vanilla� which I assume means that there wasn�t enough sex or punishment in
them.� He threw the email to me.

&lt;Colonel Nubaro

Colonel,

The last few articles I�ve received from
my reporters in your country have been well written and have kept the interest
of the women here but the men, who mainly are the ones buying the uncensored
DVD, are complaining that the subject matter of the last few have been too
vanilla in content and sales have dropped. In view of this I would appreciate
it if they could be sent to report on something a little more �challenging�.

Yours

Ted&gt;

I read the email twice before passing it
to Roger. I guessed it was similar to the previous one from Ted that Roger saw
in Riku�s office. His face fell and it took on that scared look that I�d become
to know so well. With shaking hands he passed it to Sumala who read it without
commenting. We waited in suspense for the Major to tell us our fate but he
seemed to be taking a great delight in prolonging our agony. �I�m sending the
two of you to prison, the main prison. Sumala who has nothing to do with the
writing and will not have to guide you there, can stay behind,� he finally
announced with a smile. The tone of his voice made it sound as if we were to be
incarcerated, possibly for an unknown length of time. Incarcerated without
Sumala�s protection.

�But why Major? What have we done that
was really wrong? We�ve only reported on the things we�ve seen and done. Mainly
things you�ve sent us to see. The email says they were well written and the
women liked them and they are the ones you want to come here. You�re surely not
going to have us whipped again and put away just so we can experience prison
life first hand?�

�The most popular DVD�s are the ones
showing you being strapped at the airport and caned at the whipping post.�

�But� but I�m pregnant now� with your
baby�� I heard Roger hit the floor but didn�t make any attempt to pick him up
this time.

�Many girls who�ve been flogged, even in
the more advanced stages of pregnancy, go on to have healthy babies.� At that
moment I guessed he was playing cat and mouse with me. He grinned widely.

�You want us to witness the execution and
report on it?� 

The case had made the headlines of the
local paper. S�naya, an ugly brute of a man, had dragged a young girl from the
field where she was working and raped her. Because she struggled and resisted,
he afterwards thrust a knife into her belly. Surgeons were able to save the
life of the girl but not the baby. Worse, the girl would not be able to have
any further children. The court had decided it was rape because the girl was at
work at the time and took a severe stance over the fact that not only had the
girl nearly died, she would no longer be able to perform the manual work she�d
been doing to provide for herself nor would she have any more children and
contribute to the country�s economy. Public opinion made much of the fact that
it was the girl�s fifth child, one that she would have kept. The execution by firing
squad was scheduled for three days time.

�Please Major, don�t do this to us. You
know capital punishment is abhorrent to our way of life. I don�t think I could
stand the sight of seeing someone killed in cold blood. Please Major don�t send
us there.� I begged and pleaded but he still just smiled. I knew he already
made the decision.

�You will witness it just as will all the
other inmates of the prison.� From his use of the words �as will all the other
inmates of the prison�, I was half afraid we were all going to be sentenced to
a term of imprisonment there to fully understand the regime but his words were
ambiguous and again I felt he was playing a game with us. �You will report to
the holding prison at ten o�clock tomorrow morning ready for transporting to
the prison with another woman who is to start her sentence. You will lock the
link between you and leave the key with Sumala. The guards at the prison will
open the link if required.�

�How long will they be kept there Sir?�
Sumala asked.

�That I will decide after I have talked
with the governor� and that might depend on their behaviour.� The Major turned
to me, �Get out now and make what arrangements you need for a stay in prison.
Take your laptop and cameras and whatever else you need to do an in depth
report, and make sure you use them.�

Despondently we sat in the IT office and
discussed the situation. Roger was convinced that we were going to be kept in
until the Tumali government received the aid they wanted. Neither Sumala nor I
believed that to be the case. �Are we being sent in as reporters or taken and
kept as prisoners and subjected to the punishments other prisoners received and
then have to write a story on them?� I asked Riku.

�Colonel Nubaro gets emails direct from
your boss, Ellie, they don�t come through our office so I haven�t even seen it
and until you told me, I had no idea this was to happen.� She genuinely didn�t
seem to know but she cuddled Roger like a very concerned mother as though to
protect him.

As you can imagine, we didn�t get much
sleep that night. Even with Sumala�s attentions, my thoughts continually
worried about the next few days� or weeks.

Promptly at nine-thirty two local guards
appeared. We knew them of course but that day they had serious expressions.
�Sorry Miss Ellie, but we�re here to arrest you. Are you ready?�

�Almost. Do you know�� My voice broke.

�Sorry,� the guard replied, �They only
told us to come and get you and to march you to the holding prison. Has Sumala
got the key?�

I nodded and Sumala came and gave me a
hug and a kiss. It would be the first time for months we�d be separated. When I
thought back to that first night in the cell and what I thought of his
behaviour then and what I thought of him now, I realised just how much I had
changed. �Walk tall Bluestone girl. Don�t let them see you cowed.� Somehow that
boosted my morale and I knew, even if it was for Sumala�s sake, I would have to
look as though I was in charge.

�Shall we go gentlemen?� I remarked to
the guards and received a smile from them in return and a scowl from Roger.
Several times he stumbled and we had to wait for him to pick himself up before
continuing. Nevertheless we arrived before our appointed time.

Nurse Muniba checked us over but didn�t
say much. Her face wore a worried expression especially when she examined
Roger. �How many times has he passed out from pain now?� she enquired.

�I don�t know nurse, lots. Is that a
problem?�

�Is he able to withstand more pain now
before he fades?�

�Less if anything. Sometimes he only has
to think it is going to be painful.�

�Keep a close watch on him.� She wrote a
lengthy note on her board and left us without further explanation. I wondered
if she knew what was to happen to us or whether she surmised that we would be
treated like other Tumalian prisoners. The guards locked us in a cell. Further
along, I heard a woman crying but I couldn�t see her properly because she lay
curled up on her bed with her back to us.

�That�s Shenau,� Zulam, who I recognised
from our first visit, informed us, �She�s going with you. We�re waiting on the
van now. She�s had twenty lashes of the whip and has been given seven days in
prison. You might have to be careful with her. Loses her temper quickly and
when her main man wouldn�t leave, she hit him with a pan and broke his arm.
She�s still in a lot of pain although the new whipmaster doesn�t strike as hard
as the old one. Even so, twenty for a woman is plenty and she�ll get more
punishment in the other place�� I thought he was going to add, �and so will
you,� but he didn�t and I guess that made me all the more worried. Roger looked
sick but didn�t actually vomit.

For over an hour we sat side-by-side and
waited. Roger, I knew was very fearful of what was to happen to us. I was too
but I thought that I could see behind the plan; because we weren�t being told
of our fate, I suspected all we were going through now, was to make us feel
like we were real prisoners and would be dealt with in the same way. However,
the fact we had brought our reporting equipment meant we would have to have
some free time to use it. How much? How free? They were questions I couldn�t
answer.

Eventually our cell was unlocked and we
were led out. Near the door, Muniba appeared again and thrust a sealed envelope
in my hand. �Give that to the staff there and try and make sure they read it.�
With that she left and I had the impression that she was doing more than was
called for in her line of duty. This worried me greatly and it probably did
Roger too but before we could discus it, they hustled us into the police van
and shackled us to the rear seats. These guards were definitely more brutal
than the ones at the holding prison and went out of their way to make things
difficult for us. Their straps were continually in their hands and used to
chivvy us into the positions they wanted.

Shenau hobbled in after us and when she
wasn�t quick enough the guard gave her a push, causing her to stumble and cry
out as she pulled the muscles in her back. This didn�t deter him from thrusting
her hard into the seat opposite us and making her scream as her arse hit the
hard wood. We only glimpsed the welts on her back as she was twisted round but
what we saw horrified us and then to treat the poor woman with such brutality
seemed almost inhuman. We could foresee our having a rough time in prison and
Roger was already shaking with fear but from the way we were shackled, I
couldn�t even hold his hand. From the attitude of the guard we rightly guessed
that prisoners there wouldn�t be treated as kindly as in the holding prison. Shenau
bowed her head and sobbed as he guard shackled her in place.

To my surprise he then came to me, lifted
my skirt high and stared at my crotch for a short while. �We should all get to
try out a bit of white cunt now,� he grunted and pushed a finger into my dry
opening. I gave a little cry but his efforts to feel me were short lived
because the driver called out and told him to lock the doors so they could get
going.

It was with a real sense of foreboding I
heard the doors slammed and the locks sliding loudly into place. We were
confined in a dark, hot, metal box with small, deeply tinted windows set so
high up that we couldn�t see out. That in itself was enough to send shivers of
fear through us. Shenau cried as the van bounced us around and aggravated her
welts but I could do nothing to help. Shackled, I couldn�t cuddle Roger to give
him a little comfort.

Inside the van the heat became stifling
and soon my clothes were soaked with sweat. Shenau, I could see in the dim
light, was glistening with sweat too and as the journey progressed I wondered
if we were going to make it before were passed out but we did and it was a
great relief to feel the fresh air when the doors were opened. They unshackled
Shenau and for the first time we clearly saw the deep welts across her back and
arse. I suppose they weren�t any worse than those Sumala had when he was
returned from the whipping post but any healing Muniba had done was nullified
by the rubbing and chafe of the slatted wooden seats during the journey. I was
appalled at the cruelty but the guards didn�t seem affected by the sight and
when she didn�t move quickly enough for them one used his strap on her already
tortured arse. The poor woman gave a tremendous scream and fell to the ground,
only to be hauled roughly to her feet and pushed towards the main door. 

Both Roger and I felt the strap too when
our chain snagged and we were brought to a sudden halt but the blow wasn�t hard
enough for Roger to pass out. We�d hardly gone five steps across the courtyard
when the guard deliberately and forcefully lashed Roger again. This time he
went out like a light and lay still on the flagstones. �I�d heard you was a
mummy boy but I didn�t believe you were as tender as that,� the guard grinned
and then kicked Roger on the rear and ordered him up. When he didn�t move he
kicked again.

�No!� I yelled, �You�ll kill him!� I
knelt down to give him some protection and received a hard lash with the strap
across my back. This was pure sadistic cruelty. 

�Get up and get him inside,� I was ordered.


It took a great deal of effort to lift
him, especially as the chain continually got in the way but I managed it and
dragged him into the main building. In front of a desk, I sat him on the floor.
Roger was still unconscious and showing no signs of life. I was becoming
increasingly worried.

�Stand up!� the woman behind the desk
shouted. During my efforts to lift him, the chain had become entangled so both
of us would have to stand. Even using all my strength I was barely able to hold
him and when my foot slipped we both fell to the floor. Fortunately Roger
started to come round and howled and cried but I was able to get us both to our
feet. �Undress and be quick about it. We need to examine you,� the woman
snapped.

To one side I could see Shenau being
examined, mauled would have been a better term. I dropped my skirt and Roger
managed eventually to get his shorts down but of course we couldn�t take our
shirts off properly because of the chain. �You will have to unlink us first�please.�

�Criminals do not tell us what to do
bitch,� the woman screamed in my face.

�We�re not criminals,� I protested.

�Maybe, maybe not. The letter from
Colonel Nubaro says you are to be treated like them. Give them another couple
Zard, perhaps they will realise their position then.�

Almost before the strap touched Roger, he
was on the floor. For a while he lay still and then his body started shaking
and his limbs went out in all directions. Zard raised his strap. �No! Don�t be
a stupid fool! You�ll kill him and then there will be hell to pay.� I screamed
as the strap hit me instead. Roger continued to thrash about on the floor and
with the chain linkage, my arm was being thrown around too. Suddenly I
remembered the envelope. �Here read the notes the nurse sent. Don�t kill him.
Don�t.� My words must have had some effect because Zard stopped and the woman
picked up the envelope but didn�t look inside. She just stared at the pair of
us, seemingly not knowing what to do.

�What�s going on here?� A man wearing a
decent looking uniform entered. I rightly guessed he was the governor.

�Please Sir, he�s having a fit. He can�t
help it Sir. His body cannot stand pain. Please ask them to stop Sir.� 

To my surprise he immediately ordered a
warder, �Get a medic�pronto.� I quickly noted the difference between guards and
warders. Guards wore a camouflaged uniform, were armed with a pistol and
carried a leather strap; warders wore a blue uniform but only had a strap.

In the short time it took for the medic
to arrive, Roger began to quieten but it was still some time before he really
awoke and then he seemed very dazed. The medic did examine him and declared
that there was nothing wrong with his heart but Roger probably had a
dehabilitating syndrome that was triggered by pain but that was totally outside
of his experience. I wondered if we would be released but that thought was
quickly dashed. 

The governor turned to the woman at the
desk. �Process them but strictly heed the Colonel�s instructions. His letter
said if I remember correctly, �As far as practical, treat them like they are
criminals having been sentenced to a term inside here.� It isn�t practical to
punish them in quite the same way as usual. Reserve any severe punishments for
major breaches of discipline. Remember, they will undoubtedly tell the world of
their experiences here. Be strict with them but don�t overdo it, especially
with the boy. Have them brought to my office in one hour.�

�Yes Sir,� the woman responded but I
could see she resented the order. It only took a few moments for them to remove
our shirts and refasten the chain. We were both completely naked, except that I
was still allowed to wear my bluestone, when they made us stand with our hands
spread high on the wall for our examination. �We have to check that you are not
carrying drugs or anything in your body cavities,� the woman grinned and
proceeded to frisk Roger. Her idea of frisking meant kneading his flesh and
particularly his prick and balls. I received similar treatment from a male
guard. It was definitely a sexual examination although not a very painful one
except when the areas caught by the strap were squeezed and twisted.

This over we joined up with Shenau again
and were marched naked along stone corridors to what was labelled the shower
room. Our clothing was not given back to us but my backpack with the laptop and
cameras were and from that I deduced that we were going to have to record our
experiences. We weren�t the only one recording our experiences. At one point,
Roger tripped and when I turned I noticed a man surreptitiously filming us.
This frightened me as I guessed we would be treated harshly so the DVD would
find a ready market. Shenau was allowed nothing at all. The poor girl walked
bent over like an old woman and was in considerable pain. I tried to support
her a little by wrapping her arm around my shoulder and received what was
almost a smile in return. Although we tried to hurry along, it wasn�t fast
enough for the guard, (I suspect that if we�d run like athletes that wouldn�t
have been fast enough) and we received more stinging slaps from the strap. 

On entering the room, the first thing I
noticed was the lack of showerheads. The room was virtually bare. Three tiled
walls and a floor with a large central drain. We soon found out why when the
warder pulled a hose from the wall and sprayed us with the high-pressure jet.
The force knocked us all to the floor but the jet continued to play over our
bodies, particularly our sexual parts. The pounding water caused us to scream
in pain and in the end the three of us managed to huddle in a heap. �On your
feet.� The order came as soon as he turned the water off and before we had time
to recover. Again we were inspected and my vagina came in for special attention
but I wasn�t fucked. I guessed the rule about not doing it while on duty
applied there too. Dripping and still spluttering and coughing from the water that
had forced its way up our nostrils, he led us outside into the sunshine to dry
and then to the governor�s office where we nervously stood in front of his
desk.

�Stand up straight!� Our warder escort
barked the order and I did my best to comply. Shenau had difficulty in
standing, let alone standing upright. The strap hit her already sore shoulders
and she collapsed. Immediately I took it upon myself to help the wailing woman
to her feet and tried to support her. To his credit, Roger moved so she was between
us and helped to support her too. The warder raised his strap again but
fortunately the governor signalled him to retire to the doorway. The three of
us stood, shaking and fearful, while the governor circled round and inspected
us. Finally he returned to his desk.

�Shenau, you are here for seven days,
Eves and Hart, you are to stay until Colonel Nubaro orders your release.� I
long ago noticed that the Tumalians rarely used their family name so it didn�t
come as a surprise that we alone were so addressed. �All three of you will be
subject to the prison rules, punishments and work schedules. Life here is not
easy and is not intended to be. I�ve heard about the way they coddle prisoners
in England but here we treat criminals severely, as you will find out.� I
wanted to point out that we weren�t criminals but thought that might provoke
him. �You English people will follow the same schedule as Shenau but the
Colonel has decreed that you will be allowed, indeed he insists that you do,
carry your cameras at all times and you are to photograph whatever you need for
your report. The warders have been informed of this. You are also to write a
daily report on your laptop. This will be sent without editing directly to the
Colonel via our intranet link. As I understand it, your editor complained that
you last reports were not gruesome enough and that is why you are here.�

�Sir,� I ventured, �Are we being put in a
Catch 22 situation whereby if we don�t write graphically enough of our
experiences here, we will be forced to stay longer and if we do, the prison
staff will punish us for saying how cruel they are?�

To my surprised he answered civilly and
carefully. �The Colonel will be the only person to see your reports, but I
wouldn�t be surprised if you�re kept here until sufficient material has been
gathered to satisfy your boss. Now Bluestone Eves, your status here is such
that you will have authority over other prisoners, male or female, but not over
the guards and warders and you will not be able to refuse any man access to
your body when they and you are not working. Being a white woman, you must
expect the staff particularly to want to put their pricks in you even if it is
only for the novelty of it. I shall be doing so in a few moments. Other
prisoners will have limited access to you but we try to rotate the cell in
which all female prisoners sleep so all the men get some satisfaction. Hart,
from the letter the nurse sent I see that for medical reasons, the punishment
we can give you is limited but I expect the warders will device other ways to
punish you and it may well be that your bluestone partner will have to take
your share of the punishments as well as her own.�

�Oh No!� I cried out but it had no
effect. I pleaded that I was pregnant with the Major�s baby but that didn�t
have any effect either. 

�Thrashing your arse or back won�t affect
the baby�s development and nor will having my prick and many others in your
cunt. Now untangle yourself and lay across my desk.� The way Roger had moved to
support Shenau, caused our chain to wrap round her body. She had recovered
sufficiently to stand if not properly upright. So far during this interview
she�d hardly said a word but stood to one side while the governor fucked me. It
was a short fuck and afterwards a female orderly, who from the stripes on her
uniform was senior to the other warder, took us to the cells. Like everyone,
she carried a strap and didn�t hesitate to use it to hurry us along. 

To delay the inevitable, I asked to
photograph her, Shenau and other things as we went along, and reluctantly, she
allowed it. I guessed that I was walking a fine line between delaying the
inevitable and provoking her anger at the delays.

The cells were almost identical to the
ones in the holding prison except there were two beds in each cell, one against
each wall and, although they were no bigger, the beds were for two people. That
was going to be awkward for us if I had to service other prisoners and Roger
had to be in the same bed. At the time all the cells were empty. Shenau was put
into one and we were shown into the next and told that would be ours for that
night, however, we were taken further on to a room used by the warders. �You
will use this room to do your reports because there are no power points in the
cells. The warders have been told not to interfere with you will you are
working here and they are not to read what you write. That table in the corner
is for you. You may start now.� She left abruptly leaving us with the one
warder in the room.

I plugged in the laptop and whispered to
Roger because I wasn�t sure if we could talk but the warder seemed friendlier
or at least less abusive, and said, �It�s okay, you�re allowed to speak here �
provided you are nice to me.� Of course I guessed what being nice to him meant
and as soon as he saw that Roger was downloading the camera pictures and I
wasn�t actually working he had me between his legs sucking his prick.

Some time later we heard sounds of the
other prisoners returning punctuated by sounds of leather striking flesh and
yelps from the recipients. Warders herded us into line with them and took us to
the canteen where they served a thin tasteless soup in a plastic bowl and a
chunk of hard bread. Our fellow prisoners looked a strange and forbidding bunch
especially as they all bore the stripes of whippings and the marks of the
strap. All talked in hushed voices but I know much of the conversation and all
their eyes centred on me. My white skin and my blonde hair stood out and I
wished I could make myself invisible. Everyone knew who we were so I had no
need to introduce us but the buxom woman sitting opposite did ask why I was in.
�Just a whim of the Colonel�s,� I whispered back and she nodded knowingly.

In the cell that evening, an almost
continuous stream of warders and guards came and fucked me until I was so sore
I hardly dared touch my cunt and my mouth tasted like a sewer. Roger did try to
ease my soreness by cleaning my crotch with wet paper towels but there was
little he could do. In the other bed, one of the two naked men force fucked the
other and I wondered if he came from the Mummy Boy Camp but at least he didn�t
seem to want to have me. Neither Roger nor I got any sleep that night. Shenau
was fucked by her cellmates but the warders didn�t bother with her. I cursed my
appearance, I cursed the Colonel and above all I cursed Ted and it was then I
made up my mind that his balls would suffer when and if we ever got home.

I won�t bore you with a recital of the
hardships of the next two days. They were a blur of pain and humiliation except
for the hour twice a day when we were allowed in the warder�s room to do our
report. Roger not being able to take his fair share of the punishment made my
situation worse. It was not really his fault but it made my life so much more
painful. Our work was scrubbing the stone floors of the prison and being
chained meant he had to work left-handed. The first morning set the scene for
the next two days. The warder on duty was a well-built woman who delighted in
flicking her strap over our exposed arses. Half an hour into the work, she
decided that we weren�t working hard enough and thought she might get away with
lashing the soles of Roger�s feet. Even though she didn�t hit them all that
hard, he blacked out straightaway. I of course, started screaming at her not to
kill him and that she wasn�t allowed to hit him. He came round fairly quickly
this time and then the evil woman made me push my arse in the air and I knew
what to expect but not the ferocity of it. The first blow knocked me down to
the floor. I screamed at the top of my voice but she ordered me into position
again. Somehow I managed it only to be knocked down again by the force of the
leather. Abruptly she ordered me up again and with a grin said, �Get used to
it, you haven�t had part of his yet and then there�s yours to come.� The pain
was horrendous but I knew from speaking to my cellmate the previous night, that
refusal usually led to a session with the cane at the whipping post in the
courtyard. After the fourth hit I couldn�t get to my knees and the pain was so
bad I felt sick. Another warder came by and hauled me in position. I prayed
that I would pass out but I didn�t. After the sixth, she said, �That�s for your
boyfriend�s share, now for yours.� Some of the strokes went lower and caught me
across my thighs but the last one, and I don�t know if it was deliberate or
not, the end caught me fully on my cunt and clit. For a while, I was past
caring about what she said but just writhed in agony on the ground. Vaguely I
heard Roger pleading for her to stop but she ordered us to continue with our
scrubbing. I physically couldn�t but Roger sort of got me on my knees and the
woman left us alone for a while. For much of the rest of the day, Roger kept
apologising but I knew there was little he could do about it. The bitch just
wanted to see me suffer. Perhaps she hated bluestone women.

The fact that I�d had a severe thrashing
didn�t stop me getting further doses and by the end of the morning I couldn�t
stand without the help of another prisoner who half carried me to the communal
shower where two warders sprayed us with high-pressure hoses. Fortunately after
a meagre lunch, we were allowed to write a report but this time Roger had to do
most of the typing because the pain was too great to even think straight. I
hadn�t used my camera at all that morning but Roger had used his several times
as an excuse to get us a break from scrubbing. One he�d taken of my arse almost
made me vomit to look at it. �I hope it pleases bloody Ted to see that!� 

When we�d finished our rough draft, the
warder took us to the governor�s office where we connected the laptop to the
intranet and sent the report to Colonel Nubaro. �It seems you are finding
things a little difficult here,� the Governor observed.

�Of course we are!� I retorted, �So would
you if you were expected to work with one hand chained and then take the
punishment for two people.� The bastard just grinned and I had a feeling this
was all part of the game plan.

�Well let�s see if you are warm inside
too.� He dropped his shorts and I draped myself across his desk. The first
touch of his prick in my opening had me screaming again and he pulled out in
disgust. �Take them back to their work,� he yelled at the warder.

By the end of the second day I could only
stand with difficulty but for some reason I wasn�t molested in my cell. Kulu,
one of my cellmates that night, was the huge fellow that had helped me to the
shower after my thrashing of the previous day and he took me under his wing and
made sure none of he others interfered with me. He�d been flogged with a whip
for repeated drink violations and was in for 30 days. By then he�d served over
half his time and yet his back still hadn�t healed because of the treatment
with the strap kept opening the welts. The more I saw and heard of the cruelty
in this prison, the more I hated the system that allowed it. Did those in
charge of the country know what went on in that place? I resolved they would by
the time I left � if I left.

Near noon on the third day everyone
assembled in the courtyard. My big friend Kulu supported me and we were made to
stand in the front so we had a good view and our cameras were ready in our
hands. The governor had instructed us, on pain of further punishment to make
sure we obtained pictures of the execution and when I complained about the
disgust I felt about the whole event he said, �You�re reporters, or supposed to
be, it will be a scoop for you. No other reporters in the world will get to see
it. Not even the local papers are allowed in. Make sure you get good pictures.
They will be seen around the world. If not there is always the post in the
courtyard�� I knew that wasn�t quite true because of the man filming us was
around all the time.

S�naya was led out between two warders
and with an armed guard escort. Roger was shaking more than I was but I hissed,
�Take pictures.� Watching through the viewfinder, seemed to take our minds away
from the reality somewhat but even so I felt very sick as we photographed him
being tied to the stake and memories of my being tied to the whipping post came
back vividly in my mind. I looked at the man. He might be an ugly brute, he
might have killed a baby and seriously injured a woman but I wondered if he deserved
to die. But if the alternative was to be kept in this prison for a long period,
perhaps death was the kindest option. At that moment S�naya didn�t think so and
yelled obscenities at his captors and evoked the spirits of some god unknown to
me and threatened everyone with curses on their families if they went ahead and
killed him. It made no difference. At the stroke of twelve, the order came for
the five man firing squad to raise their riffles. Roger had his camera trained
on them, I pointed mine at S�naya.

�Fire!� Five shots rang out. I clicked
the shutter several times. Screams came from the whipping post. S�naya was not
dead. Blood poured from his genitals. 

The governor�s voice came over the
address system. �That is for the death of the baby he killed. He will now die
for all the unborn babies the girl cannot have and the injuries he gave her.� I
vomited and it seems that held proceedings up for a few minutes. Kulu hissed,
�Get ready to take more pictures. Don�t make him wait any longer than necessary.�
My hands shook as I raised the camera again and heard the order to fire. Almost
automatically I pressed the shutter. The man slumped. Five bullets found their
way into his chest. I sagged to the ground. The next thing I remember was Kulu
carrying me to the warder�s room. Roger was walking but his face was ashen
neither of us felt like writing but the governor was alongside us and urging us
to send in our report. Physically and mentally we were drained and vaguely I
remember the medic coming and giving us an injection. Some sort of stimulant, I
guess, because we both suddenly awoke from the haze and were able to start the
work they wanted. Even so it was two hours before we sent the report down the
line. Some of the delay was caused by my not being able to sit properly to type
and only having one computer to download the photos and do the writing, but
much of it was due to the objectionable nature of the material and also the
fact that I felt it was necessary to put the horror of it all in the most
graphic words possible. I wanted the whole world to know just how barbaric the
system was. It was my duty to those inside and to those outside who might
influence and make changes to the system. I know Roger was fearful that we
might be incarcerated for a longer period but at the back of my mind, I
believed the reverse would be the case. In my mind, the General himself wanted
the world to know just how strictly he controlled the country and again that
was to deter the wrong people coming and those that didn�t really want to stay
for good.

I must have been right. Two hours after
sending the report, to our great surprise and relief, an ambulance took us back
to Chapoti and our room in Government House. Muniba came and almost cried when
she treated me and for a little while I was blissfully free of pain. We didn�t
even get an apology from the Major when he visited us in my room after learning
that I wouldn�t be able to work for several days at least. Sumala though was
most concerned and angry at the way my body had been marked again and Riku and
the IT staff we utterly horrified at what I had been through, just to get a
story. I gather their views filtered back to the Major via Shelumba but he
never mentioned it.

Chapter twenty-three. Home and back?

Nine weeks after our visit to the prison
the major summoned us to his office. We�d been away for a week visiting with
Allaice and JeanPaul again and seeing the forestry industry in her area. This
time I didn�t even ask for transport; just for permission to go there. Roger didn�t
object too much either especially as the non-physical link we had in the IT
office was extended to outside with the exception that if I passed him on to
another girl, he had to be linked to her. In any case I had largely recovered
from my ordeal in prison, although there was still residual pain, and we were
both much fitter now than when we came, thus the journey proved far less
gruelling. Even being pregnant didn�t seem to tire me too much and we easily
made the journey to the forest huts on the first day.

�You can go home at the end of the week,�
the Major shocked me with his opening remark. �Peter Spencer was here while you
were in Neambu and completed the negotiations for your release. You are a very
valuable girl, Ellie. We obtained 3.2 million dollars worth of aid for you.� I
calculated that as being nearly 2 million pounds but I found out later the
claim as to it being my value was somewhat of an exaggeration. The figure was
correct but it really wasn�t a ransom payment for me. When the aid agreement
was signed, the following day General Cumu granted our pardon �as a gesture of
good will.� I was so overwhelmed that I cried and so did Roger. After six
months we were going home, and yet there was going to be a good deal of sadness
when we left too. Sumala didn�t look too pleased and I gave him a hug knowing
that I would miss him immensely. Several times I wondered if I could take him
with me but I knew he would never be happy with the restrictions our society
imposes on sex with women and he probably wouldn�t survive our weather.

In the few days left, I tried to see as
many of our friends as I could and to say good-bye. To each I promised to try
and return but I had no way of knowing whether that would really be possible. 

Through Riku I learned that no public
announcement had been made of General Cumu�s pardon and Peter Spencer had only
been told the General would consider it now but was given no firm assurance.
Our editor and the staff on Today�s World probably wouldn�t know of our
release. I decided, and Roger finally agreed, that we would just walk in on
them the day after we arrived back. Hence we sent in a report of our trip to
Neambu as normal and then lied by saying we were going to a remote area and
would be out of contact for a week.

Roger was very quiet on the flight home
but I managed to get him to talk while the film was being shown. �I will miss
being with you Ellie. A few months ago I would have been glad to have gone home
without you but now I�m not looking forward to living alone and not having you
there beside me.�

�Or Riku or Sanle or one of the other
girls,� I smiled at him and held his hand.

�Yes, them too but you were the one that
was always there. I know I�m a weak spirited person and I don�t have the
strength of Suma but you looked after me. Sometimes I know I thought of you as
a real bitch dragging me around, making me do things I didn�t want to do but
afterwards, there was the caring you; the woman who tried to protect me and
allowed me to make love to her. I shall miss all that Ellie, miss it so much.�
I could see he was nearly in tears.

After waiting a little while to see if he
would go on and ask what I knew was on his mind, I took the initiative. �Roger,
you will spend the weekend with me and as we are not at work, we will live under
Tumalian rules as far as possible and then on Monday we will go into the office
together.

As it turned out, there was a lot to do
to put my place in order, to get supplies and generally air out and clean the
place after such a long absence but I did let him fuck me when we had �free�
time and we slept together in my small bed. I knew I liked Roger but it was
more akin to having a baby boy to look after and to me that wasn�t love. �But
will love come in time?� I asked myself as I lay with him cradled in my arms.
There was no immediate answer to that question.

Monday came and Roger looked appalled
when I put on my Tumali dress. �You can�t go out like that! Not here,� he
yelled but I ignored his protestations. It was early October and still quite
warm but I put a light shawl around my shoulders to cover my indecency and made
Roger wear his shorts and gaudy shirt. At the last minute I remembered my
colourful, oversized hat. In London though, amid the other tourists, our
appearance hardly rated a second look. Poor Roger was shaking a little
especially as he�d perceived I was planning something and wouldn�t let him in
on it. By ten o�clock when I knew the office would be in full swing, I dragged
him into the reception area. Rebecca gasped and greeted us and was about to
announce our arrival when I told her to keep quiet. Slipping off my shawl so my
tits were on show with the bluestone nestling prominently between them, I
pulled out the chain cuffs and the strap I begged the Major to be allowed to
keep and fastened Roger to me.

�You can�t go in there like that, not
with all those men�� Rebecca too looked horrified. 

�This is how I�ve had to dress for the
last six months as you should know from our reports.�

�But this is London��

To say we caused a stir in the office
would be a gross understatement. As so many times in the past, I hauled an
unwilling Roger behind me and strode into the office and loudly proclaimed, �Hi
All, we�re back!� Work stopped but I didn�t. Ted�s office was at the far end
and he�d just poked his head out to see what was going on as we reached his
door. �Morning Ted, you bastard, we�re here to negotiate a rise in pay to make
up for the hardships we�ve been through because of you!� For once he seemed at
a loss for words but whether it was from the sight of my tits or my arrogant
statement, I didn�t know. He flopped back in his chair and I could see the
bulge in his trousers. �Does a sight of the real thing make you more horny than
the pictures?� As I spoke, I reached down and felt his erection and then slid
my hand inside his zipper. A wide smile flashed across his face but it only
lasted a few seconds, just long enough for me to grip his balls and to squeeze
them as hard as I could.

�AAAAAHHHH!!!� He screamed and the office
staff came running. Tears rolled down Ted�s face and it looked as if he would
be sick but I didn�t let go.

�Is this enough pain for your perverted
taste Ted? Or perhaps you want to know what the strap feels like?� I lashed it
across his arse but unlike when we�d received it, he still had his trousers on.
He must have felt it though. �AAAAAHHHH!!!� He screamed again and tried to move
from my grasp. �Remember what it is like when you think about having others
thrashed. This is a very small payment for the pain you caused us so remember
it and remember it well.� I let go and for a few minutes he writhed on the
floor and it was some time before he felt like sitting and facing me again. At
least every one in the office now knew that Ellie was no longer a shy little
mouse. 

�I�ll sack you, you bitch!�

�Think of the publicity Ted. Perhaps we
should have captured your ordeal and printed it. Yes, you can sack us but I
think we will easily get another job, perhaps one where we can reveal the
inside story of our abduction and unjust punishments. Private Eye will no doubt
pay handsomely to know your collusion with Peter Spencer and Colonel Nubaro to
have us shipped to Tumali where you well knew we�d be tortured and raped.�

Half an hour later we left his office
with our pay rise and a two week holiday. It wasn�t much of a holiday. The TV
people got to hear of our return and we had to do a couple of programmes for
them as well and the more mundane things like clearing up Roger�s place and
visiting parents and answering questions from people we hardly knew or didn�t
know at all. Fortunately it soon died down and work became more and more
routine. Through the wonders of email I was able to keep in touch with Riku and
through her with the Major, Sumala and others so we knew what was going on and
many times wondered if I should return but always I remembered the whipping
post as well as the good times. Still as Sumala was fond of telling me, very
few women in Tumali ever had much more than a spanking, so unless I did
something stupid, I shouldn�t be punished.

I paid several visits to prenatal clinics
but wasn�t impressed and about a month before the baby was due, applied for a
visa to visit Tumali. It was granted and two weeks later Roger and I boarded
the plane. This time in Lilongwe airport, I once more donned my Tumalian blouse
for the flight to Chapoti. I wasn�t taking a chance on being improperly dressed
when we arrived at our destination.
