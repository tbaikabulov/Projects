 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�We should just burn the entire village to the ground.&nbsp; Set an example for those who would dare defy our Queen.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I turned my eyes to Luther.&nbsp; His insane grin terrified me, but I kept my poise.&nbsp; �Sir Luther, you know that was not what the queen ordered of us.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Heh.&nbsp; Trust me, you&#8217;d be a lot better off if we skip this entire damn town and leave it in smoldering ruins.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; �What do you mean?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Luther laughed menacingly.&nbsp; �You know the reason were here, right?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Blasphemy, according to her Majesty.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Exactly.&nbsp; The town is filled with a bunch of misogynistic religious fanatics.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I could see why my Queen sent me.&nbsp; She was always on my side, supportive of the kingdom&#8217;s first female knight.&nbsp; Religious fanatics such as those were the type of scum she wanted purged from her kingdom, and I would fulfill her wish.&nbsp; These simple folk had no idea what was coming their way.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Luther trotted ahead on his horse.&nbsp; �You coming, Gwyn?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Together, we rode down from the overlooking hill towards the tiny village.&nbsp; The sky was cloudless, and the grass glowed with a late spring green.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; However, as they neared the village, the terrain got darker and dirtier, the townsfolk having paid no attention to the impact of their filth and pollution on the surrounding terrain.

The village was comprised of a patchwork of wooden huts and few genuinely carpentered houses, organized without any clear plan.&nbsp; The streets seemed to randomly twist and turn in directions determined solely by the builders&#8217; whims.&nbsp; I was surprised there even was a path to the center at all.&nbsp; The men and women of the small hamlet parted to allow our passage, but they never took their eyes off us.&nbsp; We were outsiders, and their religious zealotry no doubt spurred xenophobia in addition to misogyny.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I wish to speak with your ruling council,� I demanded from atop my white horse.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Gasps and murmurs erupted from the crowd.

  &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I looked to Luther, who was sitting atop his horse with a foolish grin across his face.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I said, &#8216;I wish to speak with your ruling council.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Still, nobody spoke.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I drew my sword and pointed it at the crowd.&nbsp; �Shall I ask again?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�That is enough!�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Who said that?� I asked as I scanned the crowd for the man that dare speak against me.&nbsp; Rarely had a man used such a tone against me and kept his head.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The crowded hurried from the town square to reveal a single elderly man with a long white beard.&nbsp; He huddled over towards us, supporting himself with a rudimentary wooden cane.&nbsp; �It was I.&nbsp; I am the leader of this town.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Our Queen demanded we deliver a message.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Silence, wench!�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Luther began to chuckle.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What did you call me?�&nbsp; My blood boiled.&nbsp; Nobody speaks to me like that, nobody!&nbsp; I was the finest knight in the Queen&#8217;s service, and the only woman to ever be knighted, and the youngest squire to ever get promoted.&nbsp; Nobody calls me wench, especially not elderly religious fanatics.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The elder turned to Luther.&nbsp; �Why have you not silenced her?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Sorry, sir, but she is a hard one to control.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Does she know what she does?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes, she knows.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Luther, what is going on?� I asked, completely baffled by the exchange between the two men.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Let us go inside,� offered the elder. �We have things to discuss.&nbsp; And not a word from the wench.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I was about to kill the man right then and there, but Luther placed his hand against my armlet and forced it down.&nbsp; It was not the time to kill, but I hoped for the chance.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You&#8217;ve made a grave mistake coming to our town, and even graver one allowing the whore to speak out of turn.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I am not a whore!�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�You will be, you will be.&nbsp; Now, sir knight, why have you intruded upon us?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Our Queen wishes to make an offer of peace.&nbsp; She knows that your people have harassing our caravans of late, and she demands that it stops.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�And why would we comply after you allow her to break our sacred rules?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Luther smirked.&nbsp; �We are offering her as a tribute.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Instantly my hand reached to my sheath, but it was too late; the tip of Luther&#8217;s sword was already pressing against my throat.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Luther, how could you?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I will do anything that my Queen demands of me.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My heart froze.&nbsp; The Queen desired this?&nbsp; What had I done to offend her?&nbsp; I had spent my entire life as her prized servant and loyal lapdog, willing to anything to please her.&nbsp; And now this?&nbsp; �What trickery is this, Luther?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It isn&#8217;t much of a trick, Mi&#8217;Lady.&nbsp; The Queen wants you out of her castle, and she knows how much the kind people of this town would appreciate your company.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Why would she request this of me?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He chuckled, mockingly, and I wanted nothing more than to reach for my blade and take his head. However, I knew he would beat me to it.&nbsp; He pressed harder with his sword but not enough to break my skin.&nbsp; �Can you really not figure out her reason?&nbsp; I&#8217;d much rather see you deduce that yourself.&nbsp; Now, good sir, where shall I place her?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�I think we shall begin with the stocks.&nbsp; Take her outside.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Luther moved behind me and grabbed my shoulder.&nbsp; I could tell what he wanted of me by his grasp, and we exited the elder&#8217;s tiny house with me as Luther&#8217;s prisoner.&nbsp; The village elder led us to the East, through a small alley to another, smaller plaza.&nbsp; Where as the main square was for general business, the smaller one had a distinctly different purpose: the punishment of women.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I immediately understood the degree of misogyny that Luther had warned me about.&nbsp; In a cage that hung ten feet above the center of the square dangled a small blond woman.&nbsp; She mumbled to herself quietly, begging for food, and from her emaciated look, I could tell it had been days since she had last eaten.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Besides her was another woman, this one middle aged.&nbsp; Like the emaciated girl next to her, she was naked, but she hanged by her wrists to a large wooden pole.&nbsp; Her arms looked stretched and sore, but I could tell she was alive from the heaving of her chest as she struggled to breath.&nbsp; Though tears streamed down her face, she suffered without verbal protests, a likely answer to the village&#8217;s rules.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My blood began to run cold. �Luther� please, you can&#8217;t do this to me.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�It is our Queen&#8217;s wish.&nbsp; Did you not take a vow to serve her will at all times?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I knew what he was going to say, and I didn&#8217;t like it.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�If our queen wishes you to be a good will emissary to these townsfolk, shouldn&#8217;t you oblige?&nbsp; &#8216;There is no higher honor than service to the queen,&#8217; right?&nbsp; Isn&#8217;t that what you always say?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I had no response other than my rationalizations for my own self interest.&nbsp; There was nothing for me to say.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Place her to the stocks,� commanded the elder.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Luther followed the orders and led me up short steps onto a wooden platform where the stocks were placed.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Good, good,� he mumbled.&nbsp; �Henry!� he yelled. A teenage boy soon appeared from a nearby alley.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Yes, sir?&nbsp; You called for me sir?� asked the boy.&nbsp; He was a street rat.&nbsp; I had seen many during my time.&nbsp; Dirty, smelly, and wearing whatever scraps he could find. 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Please, assist that witch into the pillory.�&nbsp; He reached into his pocket and pulled a large iron key.&nbsp; �If you do this for me, I promise you a shot at her.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�For me, good sir?&nbsp; Thank you!�&nbsp; The boy grinned with a childish enthusiasm.&nbsp; I couldn&#8217;t tell how old he was, but his foolish smirk belonged on a mere pup that received more than coal on Christmas morning for the first time in his life.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Luther beckoned the kid as he hurried towards the pillory.&nbsp; �Do you mind taking her equipment?&nbsp; Wouldn&#8217;t want it getting in the way of your ceremonies, now would we.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The teenager turned to his elder, who nodded in permission.&nbsp; He then unlatched the belt that kept my sheath in place.&nbsp; It fell to the wooden floor panels.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Next were my leggings.&nbsp; He unfastened the straps behind my calves, and they too fell to the floor in a pile.&nbsp; My greaves, my chest plate, my armlets, almost everything I counted on for protection was pried off of me, leaving me naked save for my shoulder guards, chainmail tunic, leather skirt, and white undergarments.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�My, my,� taunted Luther.&nbsp; �Is that why you always wear such heavy armor?&nbsp; To prevent men from gazing upon your pure and supple skin?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I wanted teach to reach over and tear out his throat, but his sword to my own calmed my fury.&nbsp; Someday his throat would be mine, I thought, but I had no idea how unattainable that dream would soon become.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The teenager unlocked and opened the pillory.&nbsp; Luther pushed me down all the while holding his sword against my neck until my hip reached a ninety-degree angle.&nbsp; It was as if the pillory was at a perfect height for the average woman.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Now, your legs, witch,� asked the teenage boy.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�What?�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The elder jabbed his staff against my cheek.&nbsp; �Silence!� he yelled.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I gazed at him with contempt, but there was no use in mouthing off needlessly.&nbsp; I didn&#8217;t know what the teenager wanted, but I loosed up and let him do what he pleased.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He grabbed my ankles, one by one, and pressed them against a wooden bar.&nbsp; Once he was done, I realized the intent-- to force my legs apart and to allow greater access to my lower regions.&nbsp; Is that what they did to woman?&nbsp; In the Queen&#8217;s land, such tactics were a grave sin.&nbsp; Did the queen know this is what they would require of me?&nbsp; What had I done to cross her so?

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The elder bent over near my head and supported himself with his cane.&nbsp; He grabbed a handful of dirt and pebbles from the ground and held the rubble to my face.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�This,� he said, �is your punishment for speaking out of turn.&nbsp;&nbsp; For the next six hours, you are to know and be your role in life.&nbsp; To that end, you must hold these stones in your mouth and quietly accept whatever we do to you.&nbsp; Should a single pebble but fall to the ground, your time in the square is renewed.�

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I opened my mouth to speak, to protest against the injustice, my betrayal, and their misogyny.&nbsp; He viewed my mouth with a different purpose, and used my imminent cries as an opportunity to jam my mouth full of the stones.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;My punishment had begun.

I&#8217;ll never forget the warmth of the first man&#8217;s legs against my rear and thighs.&nbsp; It had been over a decade since my life was defined by the cold, smooth touch of armor. His heat felt great against my skin; a small solace to the piercing pain my vagina.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He didn&#8217;t even pause to make sure I was ready.&nbsp; The sudden shock pushed me to scream and the pebbles fell out of my mouth.&nbsp; I let out a pained cry.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;�Silence!� yelled the town elder.&nbsp; �You will learn not to make noise unless given permission.�&nbsp; He reared back his cane and snapped it onto my back.&nbsp; 

Even against my chainmail tunic, the cane hurt.&nbsp; Once again, I screamed, this time louder and more horrendous.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The man at my rear did not stop.&nbsp; I screamed and squirmed but he just dug his hands deeper into my waist.&nbsp; He slammed his thing into me over and over, sending waves across my body that clanked my shoulder plates against the wooden stocks.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I had vowed to live a life of celibacy in service to the King and Queen.&nbsp; There was no higher honor in life than fulfilling the role of chaste Knight Maiden, and my family had been so proud of the many honors I received.&nbsp; 

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But now, that dream was shattered.&nbsp; I could feel the warm cum overflowing from my vault and down my pale smooth thighs, and I had no choice but to endure their punishments, for without a weapon I was truly defenseless.&nbsp; And, even if I did escape, where would I go?&nbsp; The Queendom of Aluane extended hundreds of miles in each direction, ensuring I would receive no harbor no matter where I ran.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;No, this was it.&nbsp; This was my new life.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The town hoodlum that had helped me into the stocks bent over, recovered the spilt stones and returned them to my mouth.&nbsp; Another man stepped forward and shoved his cock inside me.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I wanted to scream, to cry, to reject the filth that filled my mouth, but I refrained, suppressing the urge and swallowing my pride.&nbsp; The rapist continued to ram into my rear, but I accepted it, for there was no other way for the nightmare to ever end.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Man after man continued to use my soar holes, but I thought I could make it.&nbsp;&nbsp; But just after sunset, I began to nod off.&nbsp; And, not from pain, but from exhaustion, a single pebble slipped from my mouth.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The foolish looking street rat quickly pounced and raised the pebble into the air with a look of absolute pride.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was going to be a long night.

-

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I wish it ended then.&nbsp; I wish I held out, but that was just the beginning of my plight.&nbsp; 

Once during the lantern lit night I cried out and spilled the stones.&nbsp; By then I could feel the cum pooling around my feet.&nbsp; The townsfolk must have each had their tries and been moved onto seconds.&nbsp; They all laughed and taunted me while the women stood at edges of the square and stared.&nbsp; I wondered how many of them had been sentenced to this same unspeakable horror.

From vacant looks on many of their faces, I knew the answer.

--

Again, just before dawn, I slipped into slumber and spilt the stones.&nbsp; And, after that, I remembered nothing.

---


I awoke in a horse&#8217;s stall.&nbsp; It reeked of equine stench, presumably from a horse that stared at me from across the stables.&nbsp; Hay stuck to my skin, adhered by the unclean cum that still lingered to my body after the night of brutal assault.&nbsp; Had I made it, or did they grant mercy on me?&nbsp; I tried to stand but collapsed back onto the ground with a thump.

They told me I had passed out from exhaustion and failed my trial.&nbsp; I would have to repeat it over, but not immediately.&nbsp; Even a lowly woman was given time to care for their wounds.&nbsp;&nbsp; And so, I rested in that horse&#8217;s stall, a chain wrapped around my neck and my arms cuffed together behind my back.

I was allowed that one day to reflect on my life.&nbsp; From a young girl fighting boys in the city square, to a teenage girl disguising herself as a boy to become a squire, to full acceptance into her majesty&#8217;s service, my existence was one of pride and valor.&nbsp; I did everything I could to serve my Queen, and I had no reason to believe that I crossed her.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But, in that day of peaceful solitude among the neighing horses, I realized the moment where everything went wrong.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;It was his visit.&nbsp; The Regent of a neighboring kingdom came to discuss matters with the Queen.&nbsp; He was young, smooth, and attractive, and I loved being in his presence.&nbsp; It was innocent, and led nowhere; he was just a young power monger trying to make an in with our military to get information.

 &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;I gave him nothing but empty, flattering words, but he took so much more.&nbsp; The night after his visit, the Queen spoke to me with an unfamiliar coldness.&nbsp; I thought nothing of it at the time, but now I realize what I had done. I had offended the Queen.&nbsp; Her young, prized knight had stepped in and stolen the affection of a noble, the only breed of mates the queen would ever allow herself.&nbsp; She had wanted him, but my beauty stole him from her grasp.

And, for that single mistake, I am faced with this.&nbsp; A life I never imagined, being everything that I never wanted to be.

Here I am facing down the pillory once again, no longer armored or chaste.

This time I will succeed.&nbsp; As a knight, I mastered my mind and body to push myself past the limits.&nbsp; Today, I will do the same, but for a distinctly different purpose.

Though I am now a slave, I will not die one.&nbsp; I will be free.

And when I am� revenge will be mine.&nbsp; 

Against these villagers.&nbsp; 

Against Luther.

And, above all, against the Queen.
